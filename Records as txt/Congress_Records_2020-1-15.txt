HONORING THE LIFE OF TIM 
STAPLES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. AGUILAR) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to honor the life of Tim Staples, a 
devoted husband, brother, son, and 
teacher. Tim gave his life working to 
save the life of another. 
As a volunteer for search and rescue 
team of the San Bernardino County 
Sheriff’s Department, Tim joined the 
search for a missing hiker last month 
on California’s Mount Baldy. Trag-
ically, this would be Tim’s final rescue 
operation. 
Despite the risks, Tim’s endless dedi-
cation to serving others guided him 
through 9 years as a volunteer with the 
search and rescue team, where he as-
sisted countless operations to help save 
the lives of fellow San Bernardino 
County residents. 
But his passion for search and rescue 
was not the extent of Tim’s desire to 
serve his community. Tim’s desire to 
serve the community spanned across 
education and community and civic ac-
tivities. 
He grew up in San Bernardino Coun-
ty, attending Damien High School in 
La Verne before getting his college 
education at Gonzaga University in 
Spokane, Washington. 
Tim was a Cub Scout and Boy Scout 
before becoming an Eagle Scout. He 
completed the Buckskin Leadership 
training and dedicated his time to 
training other Scouts. 
Tim was an educator, spending his 
career as a teacher and coach at both 
St. Lucy’s High School in Glendora and 
at his alma mater in Damien. 
He is remembered by his family and 
friends for his love of helping others 
and often helping complete strangers. 
From stopping traffic to help push a 
car through a crowded intersection to 
driving over 2,000 miles to help a friend 
move, Tim was always willing to put 
his full energy and effort behind help-
ing other people, including on his last 
day. 
He is survived by his two sisters, his 
parents, and his loving wife, Katie. 
Tim’s 
students, 
athletes, 
friends, 
family, and all of San Bernardino 
County are better off as the result of 
Tim’s endless compassion and drive to 
serve others. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF 
SERGEANT HARRY AMIGH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
and honor Sergeant Harry Amigh, a 
resident of Ebensburg, Pennsylvania, 
and a Korean war veteran. 
Sergeant 
Amigh 
enlisted 
in 
the 
United States Army in 1948 and would 
go on to serve in the Battle of Chosin 
Reservoir, one of the Korean war’s 
greatest battles. Sergeant Amigh was 
killed in action during that battle at 
just 20 years old. 
Though his military career ended far 
too soon, Sergeant Harry Amigh left an 
incredible legacy behind. I am humbled 
to be joining the Amigh family this 
Friday, January 17, to honor his legacy 
and present the family with seven mili-
tary awards and medals in his memory. 
Sergeant Amigh is the recipient of a: 
Purple Heart; 
National Defense Service Medal; 
Korean 
Service 
Medal 
with 
one 
Bronze Star; 
Combat Infantryman Badge; 
United Nations Service Medal; 
Republic of Korea-Korean War Serv-
ice Medal; and. 
Republic of Korea Presidential Unit 
Citation. 
The men and women who have chosen 
to dedicate their lives to defending the 
United States are among the most cou-
rageous citizens. 
Sergeant Amigh loved his country, 
and he fought valiantly for his coun-
try. For that, we are forever indebted 
to Sergeant Amigh and the many men 
and women like him who made the ul-
timate sacrifice. 
IN SUPPORT OF IRANIAN PROTESTERS 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
and as a cosponsor of House Republican 
Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY’s H. Res. 791, 
supporting the protesters in Iran. H. 
Res. 791 serves notice to the Iranian re-
gime that the United States is watch-
ing and the world is watching.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H242 
January 15, 2020 
Sadly, yesterday, my Democratic col-
leagues blocked a vote on this resolu-
tion 
that 
expressed 
support 
of 
antigovernment protestors in Iran and 
condemned Iran’s role in the downing 
of a Ukrainian civilian aircraft last 
week. 
So what was in this resolution that 
motivated my Democratic colleagues 
to prevent consideration? 
The 
resolution 
would 
have 
con-
demned the Government of Iran for 
killing 1,500 Iranian citizens who were 
protesting their government as well as 
condemned the Government of Iran for 
shooting down Ukraine International 
Airlines flight 752, killing 176 people. 
In addition, the resolution, in section 
3, ‘‘condemns the Government of Iran 
for repeatedly lying to its people and 
to the world about its responsibility 
for the downing of Ukraine Inter-
national Airlines flight 752’’; section 4, 
‘‘calls on the Government of Iran to, A, 
refrain from the use of violence, and, B, 
protect the rights of freedom of expres-
sion and peaceful assembly; and,’’ sec-
tion 5, ‘‘supports the protestors in Iran, 
their demands for accountability, and 
their desire for the Government of Iran 
to respect freedom and human rights.’’ 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
am 
deeply 
dis-
appointed that my Democratic col-
leagues would block a measure express-
ing support of freedom and human 
rights, principles that should be af-
forded to all persons. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ENEDINA 
CELIZ RAPAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to re-
member and recognize the incredible 
life of Enedina Celiz Rapan, who passed 
away this month at the age of 93. 
I was raised in a farmworker commu-
nity with farmworker parents in the 
eastern Coachella Valley, where, for 
many of us, hardship and injustice can 
feel like the norm; and if it weren’t for 
women like Enedina Rapan, many of us 
would still believe that it is true, and 
we would not be standing where we are 
today. 
Enedina came to America at a young 
age to work hard, earn her living, and 
give her children a better life. And 
while she was working away in the 
fields, sweating in 120-degree heat with 
calloused hands, she witnessed the mis-
treatment of her fellow farmworkers 
and she saw their suffering. 
If there is one thing about Enedina, 
it is that, when she saw injustice, she 
would speak up and get to work to fix 
it. So, when she saw farmworkers la-
boring for hours on end with no bath-
rooms nearby, she fought to bring rest-
rooms to the fields. And when she saw 
seniors in the community going hun-
gry, she organized, asking for dona-
tions and cooking meals so they could 
have dinner to eat. 
And Enedina devoted her life to 
standing up for people who were mis-
treated, discriminated against, and 
vulnerable. There was no voice too soft 
that Enedina didn’t hear and elevate. 
Enedina was a giant for our commu-
nity, working with the United Farm 
Workers of America, Cesar Chavez, and 
Lideres Campesinas to stand up for the 
rights of farmworkers. She used her 
tireless will and unmatched strength to 
pick people up, fight for what is right, 
and make the Coachella Valley a bet-
ter place for everyone who lives there. 
I am better off because of Enedina’s 
work. My family and the entire farm-
worker community of the Coachella 
Valley, we are all better off because of 
Enedina’s work. 
And she would not be happy with me 
for being up here talking about her, be-
cause she was so humble. A woman who 
elevated everyone’s voice around her, 
she would never seek this type of rec-
ognition. 
Mr. Speaker, today, I want to make 
sure the country knows Enedina’s 
story. I want to make sure you know 
about her contributions to our commu-
nity and her unrelenting pursuit of jus-
tice. 
Enedina will be sorely missed, but 
her presence will be felt and her life, an 
inspiration for years to come. 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF PETRA 
RUIZ OF COACHELLA VALLEY 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to tell the Nation about the life and 
legacy of Petra Ruiz of the Coachella 
Valley. 
Petra Ruiz was an organizer, activist, 
and leader who used her life to stand 
up for farmworking women across Cali-
fornia. 
As the son of farmworkers in the 
eastern Coachella Valley, I am all too 
familiar with the social, economic, and 
political hardships the farmworking 
community faces on a daily basis. The 
struggles can often be so great that 
you have to have someone or some-
thing to look to for inspiration. For 
me, and for so many of us in the 
Coachella Valley, Petra Ruiz was one 
such inspiration. 
Petra was a fierce and loving leader 
who was held in high esteem, even by 
the people who didn’t agree with what 
she had to say. But it was hard not to 
agree with what she had to say. You 
see, 
Petra 
believed 
in 
helping 
farmworking women across California 
advocate for themselves, for their fam-
ilies, and for their communities in the 
struggle for equality and their basic 
human rights. 
Petra got involved in the union 
movement in the 1970s and was a war-
rior for justice and equality within the 
farmworking community through her 
final days. 
A phrase that I have heard repeat-
edly in talking with members of the 
community and with her family is ‘‘she 
was always there.’’ Petra was always 
there. 
Even as a mother and a grandmother 
to a big family, she worked with the 
United Farm Workers of America and 
as a member of Lideres Campesinas to 
advocate for the rights of the farm-
worker community. Petra led marches; 
she attended meetings; she would even 
go door-to-door with flyers making 
sure that farmworkers knew their 
rights. 
Petra was a remarkable woman, re-
vered, admired, a mover and shaker, an 
effective leader who led with her ac-
tions as much as she did by her words. 
She inspired me to never say no to my 
dreams, to pursue justice at every 
turn, and to always believe I could 
make a difference. 
Mr. Speaker, while she is missed 
dearly, Petra’s legacy didn’t end with 
her passing. Her impact is felt today 
and will continue in the lives of gen-
erations to come.

TIME TO BURN THE BEETLE IN 
NORTH DAKOTA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, this weekend will be time to 
burn the beetle. I am talking about the 
mountain pine beetle and the damage 
it has done to the majestic Black Hills 
National Forest. In recent years, that 
pine beetle has infected 430,000 acres in 
the Black Hills, leaving millions of 
dead trees. 
Now, the pine beetle thrives in an 
overly crowded forest. It craves den-
sity. So to tackle this problem, Fed-
eral, State, and local governments and 
private citizens have set to work 
thinning the forest. 
Initially, from the very beginning, it 
has been the State and local partners 
that have been most proactive and ag-
gressive; but, in recent years, Federal 
policies have helped as well. 
The Forest Service started utilizing 
the categorical exclusions in the 2014 
and the 2018 farm bills, allowing them 
to more quickly utilize sound forest 
management 
practices 
like 
tree 
thinning and controlled burns. 
This picture tells the story well. In 
areas where the forest has been ac-
tively managed, the trees live; in areas 
where they have not been, they die. 
And now, today, after years of battle, 
it seems as though we are nearing the 
end of this particular outbreak. 
That is good news, but it is no time 
to take our foot off the gas. One key 
action needed is to continue working 
with the timber industry to set and 
meet good harvest targets so we can 
get that excess timber out of the for-
est. 
Mr. Speaker, I started my comments 
by noting that it was time to burn the 
beetle, and in Custer, South Dakota, 
this weekend, that is exactly what 
they will do at their Burning Beetle 
arts festival. 
It is a good opportunity for us to re-
member the damage that has been 
done—430,000 acres—but also to remem-
ber the importance of good manage-
ment, of good stewardship, and of good

AMERICAN HERO RETURNING TO 
INDIANA’S SIXTH DISTRICT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor an American hero, PFC Louis 
Wiesehan, Jr., of Richmond, Indiana, 
and celebrate his return home to the 
Sixth District of Indiana. 
PFC Wiesehan was a fellow marine 
who gave the ultimate sacrifice while 
fighting on the island of Betio in the 
Pacific Ocean during World War II. 
After 77 years, PFC Wiesehan is finally 
coming home. His remains will be bur-
ied in his hometown. 
Thank you, PFC Wiesehan, for your 
service and sacrifice. You will never be 
forgotten. Semper Fi. 
MARCH FOR LIFE 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to give my wholehearted support for 
the upcoming March for Life rallies 
taking place across the Nation next 
week. 
I am a passionately pro-life Amer-
ican and I will always fight for unborn 
children. It is our duty to protect the 
most vulnerable and speak for those 
who cannot speak for themselves. 
As millions of Americans march 
across the Nation next week, I pledge 
to always stand with their cause. 
GREENFIELD-CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL RADIO 
STATION 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate the Greenfield-Central 
High School Radio Station WRGF for 
being on air for 20 years. The high 
school station was established in 1999 
and is now a 24/7 on-air public radio 
station run completely by students and 
their teacher, Jonathan Hudson. 
Greenfield-Central’s radio/TV classes 
draw 70 students a semester who are 
able to learn and gain professional ex-
perience before they enter college or 
the workforce. I was able to witness 
the advantages that these students are 
able to gain while visiting the facility 
last fall. 
Happy anniversary to WRGF and all 
the students who participate in the 
program. 
CONGRATULATING NEW PALESTINE COACH KYLE 
RALPH 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate New Palestine football 
coach, Kyle Ralph. 
Coach Ralph is among the list of only 
32 coaches nationwide who are finalists 
for the 2019 Don Shula NFL High 
School Coach of the Year Award. In his 
7 years as head coach at New Palestine, 
Coach Ralph has built a program that 
has become a statewide powerhouse. 
Throughout his tenure, Coach Ralph 
has amassed an amazing 88–4 record 
and has brought three State champion-
ships home to New Palestine. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish Coach Ralph the 
best of luck during the ceremony at 
the NFL Pro Bowl. 
NEPA UPDATE 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I applaud 
the Trump administration for pro-
posing to update the totally outdated 
National Environmental Policy Act 
regulations. 
These policies haven’t seen reform in 
over 4 decades. As a result countless in-
frastructure projects have been back-
logged for years. 
It is time to roll back burdensome 
regulations that stifle growth. 
Modernizing NEPA regulations will 
allow schools, bridges, and other vital 
projects to finally move forward safely 
and efficiently. 
I pledge my support for these updates 
and look forward to the continued im-
provement of America’s infrastructure. 
f 
TRADE WITH CHINA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Iowa (Mr. KING) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is 
my honor to be recognized to address 
you here on the floor of the United 
States House of Representatives. 
I come to the floor today to raise the 
issue and be thankful of the progress 
that we have made with regard to 
trade. We have been through a year and 
a half or more of intense trade negotia-
tions. I have watched as our markets 
took a hard hit and tailspinned down 
for a couple of days, down the limit 
awhile back, and slowly creep back in 
again. 
We produce a lot of corn, soybeans, 
cattle, hogs, eggs, and renewable en-
ergy in the Fourth Congressional Dis-
trict of Iowa. In fact, it is the number 
one egg-producing congressional dis-
trict in all of America. 
We saw a publication on the part of 
Bloomberg that when the tariffs were 
put onto Chinese goods coming into the 
United States by President Trump, the 
Chinese retaliated with tariffs on prod-
ucts 
like 
pork 
and 
soybeans. 
Bloomberg just showed a map of the 
United States where that hit the hard-
est and it happened to hit exactly over 
the red counties in America that 
produce a lot of corn and soybeans, and 
you could add to that the other prod-
ucts I mentioned, Mr. Speaker. 
The situation that we are dealing 
with now is that we have gotten a long 
way through these trade negotiations, 
and we are coming around to the other 
side of it with China. In spite of all of 
this difficulty in all these markets that 
have been suppressed over this period 
of time, we found some new trade out-
lets. 
For one thing, instead of having one 
big pipe going to China, we have got 
multiple, smaller pipes going to other 
locations in the world. And today the 
President signed phase 1 of the trade 
agreement that will increase by about 
$16 billion a year our egg product ex-
ports to China. That includes a lot of 
soybeans, it includes a lot of pork, and 
it fixes that component. 
It also addresses the intellectual 
property issue that has been a big bar-
rier for the trade negotiations with 
China. The value of U.S. intellectual 
property—the creation that comes out 
of the minds of Americans—is pirated 
by the Chinese somewhere between $500 
and $600 billion a year. That gets ad-
dressed to a degree in this agreement 
and it gets addressed again in the next 
phase of the agreement. 
U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer 
has spoken on that issue to me, and he 
seems to be, I will say, fairly confident 
that we are going to get at least a rea-
sonable beginning to something that is 
awfully hard to fix. 
I would add also that it isn’t just 
China. We are waiting now for the U.S. 
Senate to pass the USMCA Agreement. 
It is only the impeachment trial that 
stands in the way of getting that done. 
That will happen soon, within about a 
month or so, or perhaps less. 
Further we have Japan, we have 
South Korea, and by the end of this 
month the United Kingdom will be out 
of the E.U., and the door is open for a 
bilateral trade agreement with the 
British. 
If we could get that all done, as I said 
to the President the other day, we may 
find ourselves in the very best position 
we have ever been in, at least in our 
lifetime, with regard to trade in mul-
tiple locations, so that we are diversi-
fied in our markets so that we can send 
out to multiple countries and at the 
same time have a strong relationship 
with China and other countries. 
We are moving into an excellent posi-
tion here. We have got a strong econ-
omy, and we have got a strong Dow. 
This really is a great time to make in-
vestments in America, and they are 
doing that from around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the 
President today.

Let us commit to working every day 
9 to 5 on delivering real results on the 
issues that matter to our constituents 
and our country. 
These include working to reduce the 
cost of healthcare, including ending 
surprise billing, decreasing the cost of 
prescription drugs, ending prohibitions 
on association health plans, and ensur-
ing there is no loss of insurance for 
preexisting conditions. 
Also, continuing to ensure that vet-
erans receive the care they deserve and

have earned. As well as having the 
backs of our troops by keeping our 
forces strong and prepared. 
Fixing our broken illegal immigra-
tion process, first by securing our bor-
der and then reforming our laws with a 
focus on high fences and wide gates. 
Making the 2017 Trump tax cuts per-
manent for families and small busi-
nesses. Driving workforce development 
by partnering with the private sector, 
our schools, career and technical cen-
ters, and apprenticeship programs. 
Supporting trade agreements that 
create reciprocal trade and open mar-
kets for our U.S.-made products and 
agricultural goods. 
Help assure our students have afford-
able and accountable educational op-
portunities. 
Continue to grow our domestic en-
ergy 
industry 
including 
all-of-the- 
above and all-of-the-below: clean coal, 
low-carbon natural gas, and regulated 
and responsible oil production. We can 
accomplish this like no other nation on 
Earth. 
We will work to develop and pass a 
transportation infrastructure bill to 
keep our roads and bridges safe, to 
modernize our highway system, and 
build America for the 21st century. 
Finally, we will be fiscally respon-
sible with the people’s money on all 
spending and work to reduce our def-
icit. 
On the district level, we plan to 
maximize Opportunity Zones to revi-
talize our small cities, focus on work-
force development to match the en-
hanced demands of the 21st century 
workplace, maximize the economic op-
portunities of our area which will cre-
ate good-paying jobs, improve our flood 
mitigation without putting it on the 
backs of our taxpayers, supporting po-
lice and first responders to maintain a 
high level of public safety, and con-
tinue to work to wipe out the terrible 
epidemic of drug addiction. 
Mr. Speaker, if we can accomplish 
these goals, we will have an incredibly 
successful 2020 and pave the way for a 
great American decade. 
Let’s stop confusing activity with ac-
complishment. Let’s keep our eyes on 
the prize with clear 20/20 vision to get 
things done for the American people.

IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. And still I rise, 
Mr. Speaker, because I love my coun-
try. I rise today to address the trial 
that will start in the Senate, the trial 
to impeach the President of the United 
States of America. 
This trial, Mr. Speaker, will not end 
until the last person has testified. In a 
sense it is like an opera, and, as you 
know, Mr. Speaker, the opera isn’t over 
until there is a song that is sung; and 
until the last witness sings, the opera 
isn’t over, this political opera as it 
were. 
There are witnesses who must be 
heard. I believe that there are 51 Sen-
ators who will find agreement with 
what I have said. I believe that there 
are Senators who understand that 
when they take that oath, they have to 
step outside of the normal rhetoric 
that they may have espoused. I think 
they have to stand on the Constitution, 
and I think the Constitution requires 
them to hear all of the relevant and 
material evidence. 
There are documents that should be 
heard. There are witnesses that must 
be heard. I believe that the Senators 
will vote such that documents and wit-
nesses that have not been produced will 
be produced and the witnesses will be 
heard. 
I believe that this is one of the sem-
inal moments in time for the Members 
of the Senate, and I think they will un-
derstand that this is not just about 
this time, it is about all time. It is 
about what historians will say about 
this date, about the days that will fol-
low. 
It really is about who we are and 
what we stand for in the eyes of the 
world. Because it is not just about the 
Members of the House examining what 
is going on; the people of our country, 
and, indeed, the people of the planet 
Earth are viewing this, and they are 
doing so with great anticipation. They 
fully expect that the United States 
that has been a champion for liberty 
and justice for all, the United States 
that has the Statue of Liberty, the 
United States of America that stands 
for freedom around the world, that the 
United States of America will live up 
to its billing, will live up to what we 
have said, will live up to what we have 
done in the past, and will allow all evi-
dence to be presented. I believe this. 
I also believe that if all of the evi-
dence is properly presented, no one can 
say that there wasn’t a fair trial. The 
verdict may not be something that I 
would agree with, but there will have 
been a fair trial. If you don’t do this, 
then it is not a fair trial. It is just a 
fake trial. 
If you don’t do this, there is no need 
to have the Chief Justice of the Su-
preme Court present if all you are 
going to do is receive reports from the 
House, that is just a briefing. You don’t 
need the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court there with all of the majesty of 
the court. You don’t need it. 
I say have a trial, not a briefing. If 
we only have a briefing, this will be 
justice delayed if not denied. There is a 
court of appeals and that court of ap-
peals will assemble in November of this 
year because the Senate itself is on 
trial. The court of appeals in November 
will make decisions as to whether or 
not the Senate has governed itself 
under the Constitution and has pre-
sented itself such that it should con-
tinue with its current makeup. The 
people of this country will have the 
last word.

FARMERS TO BENEFIT FROM 
CHINA TRADE DEAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of President Trump’s 
effort to hold China accountable for its 
unfair trade practices, and I commend 
him and Ambassador Lighthizer on 
achieving the first phase of resetting 
that relationship. 
For years, China has been taking ad-
vantage of American manufacturers 
and producers through currency manip-
ulation, state ownership, stealing our 
intellectual property, and other unfair 
and unseemly behavior. 
The bottom line is this, Mr. Speaker: 
They have been cheating Americans, 
and politicians have let them get away 
with it for far too long. 
Joining me in this historic gallery 
today are 27 of the hardest working, 
God-fearing farmers in west Texas. 
Cochran, Lubbock, and Bailey Counties 
are represented here today. They know 
all too well the disastrous results of 
this trade imbalance with China. 
President Trump loves the American 
farmer, and thanks to his hard-fought 
negotiations, producers from the South 
Plains and across the country will reap 
the benefit of China’s new commitment 
to purchase up to $50 billion in U.S. ag-
riculture products. That is nearly 
twice the amount ever purchased by 
China. 
These farmers can attest that the 
pain from China’s retaliatory tariffs is 
real, resulting in higher input costs, 
lower commodity prices, and a signifi-
cant decline in market share in one of 
our largest export markets. 
All of this has come on the heels of 
record bankruptcies and the steepest 
decline in farm income since the Great 
Depression, but our farmers stand with 
this President because they know he is 
doing the right thing. They know he is 
fighting for them, and they also under-
stand that when we get to the other 
side of this deal, there will be greener 
pastures for the next generation of 
farmers and ranchers. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent 
the food, fuel, and fiber capital of the 
world in west Texas. These cowboys 
and plowboys who feed and clothe the 
American people, and fuel the Amer-
ican economy, are a picture of Amer-
ica’s traditional values of hard work, 
faith in God, and love for their families 
and fellow man, which, by the way, is 
the real substance of what makes 
America great. 
Mr. Speaker, on behalf of them, I 
thank the American people for their 
support through these tough times, and 
I thank President Trump for putting 
America first and fighting for a better 
future for the American farmer. 
God bless, and go west Texas.

west Texans. On Saturday morning, 
west Texas lost two of our finest and 
bravest first responders. 
Lieutenant David Hill of Lubbock 
Fire Rescue and 27-year-old Lubbock 
Police Officer Nicholas Reyna were re-
sponding to a rollover accident when 
they lost their lives in the line of duty. 
A 30-year-old firefighter and para-
medic, Matt Dawson, was also injured 
and remains in critical condition. 
This is a tragic reminder that our he-
roic first responders wake up every sin-
gle day and risk their lives to keep us 
safe. These men understood the sacred 
call to service. They gave the ultimate 
sacrifice and demonstrated the great-
est love for their fellow man. 
The Holy Scripture says this: ‘‘There 
is no greater love than this, than to lay 
down your life for your friends.’’ May 
God welcome these earthly heroes into 
His heavenly kingdom. May He comfort 
the Reyna and Hill families. May He 
grant Matt a speedy and full recovery. 
May He continue to bless and keep 
those who keep watch over us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will remind Members that the

COMMEMORATING MARTIN 
LUTHER KING JR. DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
and his life of service to our Nation. 
Next week, on January 20, we will ob-
serve Martin Luther King’s birthday. 
We know that Dr. King was the most 
influential civil rights leader in our 
Nation’s history among so many great 
civil rights leaders, such as our own 
Congressman JOHN LEWIS. 
Dr. King’s commitment to public 
service brought historic change to our 
Nation, affected our entire country and 
society, and reshaped the way we inter-
act. So it is fitting that we observe the 
25th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day as ‘‘A Day On, Not a Day 
Off.’’ 
It serves to remind us to ask our-
selves: What are we doing for others? 
Dr. King called this ‘‘life’s most per-
sistent and urgent question.’’ What are 
we doing for others in our country? 
As a public servant for the past 40 
years, I firmly believe that every indi-
vidual has an ability and an oppor-
tunity to make a change. Communities 
across the United States will host 
events to commemorate Dr. King’s 
achievements and give back to the 
community, including in my own dis-
trict in the San Joaquin Valley. 
I will proudly participate in the Mar-
tin 
Luther 
King 
Day 
Community 
March in Fresno and Merced, as well. 
My office will join the city of Fresno at 
an awards ceremony to recognize indi-
viduals and organizations for their out-
standing service to give back to our 
communities in the spirit of Dr. King. 
I urge all Americans to find ways to 
help others in communities on Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King’s birthday. You can 
find 
those 
options 
at 
NationalService.gov, a way for us all to 
give back. Because in the words of Dr. 
King: ‘‘The time is always right to do 
what is right.’’ 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL SLAVERY AND HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING PREVENTION MONTH 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
also to recognize National Slavery and 
Human Trafficking Prevention Month 
to raise awareness about this atrocity 
that plagues our Nation and the world. 
There are estimated to be more than 
40 million victims of trafficking across 
the planet. It happens in all of our 
communities here, and because of the 
geographic location that I represent in 
California’s San Joaquin Valley, my 
district sees a disproportionately high 
amount of human trafficking. 
The fighting of this atrocity requires 
all of us to be involved, and we must do 
more. Every year, I work hard to se-
cure additional funding for the Crime 
Victims Fund and to strengthen our ef-
forts to stop human trafficking. 
We were successful in getting an ad-
ditional $2 billion to support investiga-
tions and operations to prevent human 
trafficking and another $2.6 billion to 
improve services for these victims in 
the spending bill that passed just last 
month. This helps organizations like 
Breaking the Chains in Fresno, which 
is crucial to survivors. 
We must understand that these traf-
ficking victims are just that; they are 
victims of crime. We also need to bol-
ster our efforts to prevent this from 
continuing to occur, from supporting 
law enforcement efforts to holding per-
petrators accountable to educating our 
children about the dangers, especially 
in this day and age, when the internet, 
sadly, is oftentimes a tool for traf-
fickers. 
It is estimated that less than 1 per-
cent of the survivors of human traf-
ficking cases are identified. That is an 
astounding number, I think: less than 1 
percent of the survivors of human traf-
ficking are actually identified. 
Last year, as co-chairs of the bipar-
tisan Crime Survivors and Justice Cau-
cus, which I helped found with Con-
gressman Ted Poe, Congressman PETE 
OLSON and I introduced a resolution in 
the House to prevent, eradicate, and 
raise the awareness of human traf-
ficking as today’s modern slavery. It 
calls for the Federal Government to co-
ordinate efforts to fight human traf-
ficking between agencies and with 
State and local governments and other 
organizations that are out there trying 
their best. 
Just yesterday, I met with John Cot-
ton Richmond, the State Department’s 
Ambassador-at-Large to Monitor and 
Combat Trafficking in Persons, both 
here and abroad, to discuss how we can 
work together to fight this injustice. 
I promise you, we must fight this in-
justice. As a member and a co-chair of 
the Victims’ Rights Caucus, for sur-
vivors of these kinds of crimes, we will 
continue to put this among our highest 
priorities. The Crime Survivors and 
Justice Caucus will continue to lead 
this bipartisan fight to end modern 
slavery and human trafficking in all its 
forms.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF COLONEL 
LEE FRANKLIN WITTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, Thurs-
day and Friday of next week, I plan to 
visit my alma mater, the United States 
Military Academy at West Point. I 
hope to spend time with the Depart-
ment of Social Sciences and thank 
them for their service to our country 
and for their current job of training 
our next generation of warriors. 
I am sure that many of the faculty 
also mentor individual cadets. During 
my era, we called it sponsoring. This is 
a critical part of the job that I want to 
continue to encourage them to do. 
You see, I am headed back to West 
Point to attend the burial of my spon-
sor, Colonel Witter. I met the Witter 
family during my first free Sunday 
morning of Beast Barracks. We met at 
the Lutheran service in the Old Cadet 
Chapel in the cemetery. 
Colonel Witter and his wife, Mary 
Ellen, and children, Nanette, Dorinda, 
and Mathew, welcomed me into their 
home. They provided a safe haven away 
from the constant scrutiny of the 
upper class. They provided a full meal 
now and then when full meals during 
my era as a plebe were not always as-
sured. 
Having been raised in a large family, 
they provided a second family, a 
younger brother that I never had and 
two younger sisters that I already had 
plenty of. 
As in any family, sometimes I was 
helpful and sometimes maybe a burden. 
The Witter family was always there for 
me, in good times and bad. Whether I 
was breaking the porch swing or kitch-
en chairs, seriously burning Mathew, 
or spending the night when I was told 
not to, I was also forgiven. 
Colonel Witter took a special focus 
on my school performance. I was on the 
other dean’s list, the list academic 
deans pay closer attention to. Gradua-
tion for me was not a slam dunk. Colo-
nel Witter would summon me to his of-
fice to encourage me and help motivate 
me academically. When I told him I 
thought I was doing okay, he re-
sponded: ‘‘I get your grades.’’ 
I could not have graduated from West 
Point without the love and support 
from the Witter family. For this, I will 
be eternally grateful. 
Colonel Witter, 84, passed away Mon-
day, January 6, 2020, in South Carolina. 
This is a picture of him at the military 
academy as an instructor. I was blessed 
to have a chance to be able to visit 
with him and Mary Ellen a year ago 
last March.

CELEBRATING MONROE COUNTY 
BICENTENNIAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. COMER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my beloved Monroe 
County as we enter the 200th year of 
our county’s rich and storied history. 
A small rural county in south central 
Kentucky, Monroe County is home to 
communities steeped in history and 
tradition. 
Whether 
you 
are 
from 
Tompkinsville, Gamaliel, or Fountain 
Run, you have a shared Monroe County 
identity. 
If you are a Monroe Countian, you 
more than likely enjoy our legendary 
barbecue and probably have countless 
stories to tell about our county’s rich 
history, especially our political his-
tory. 
This Sunday, January 19, hundreds of 
us will gather to celebrate Monroe 
County’s 200th birthday. As we meet at 
the Tompkinsville National Guard Ar-
mory for this proud occasion, I will be 
seeing many of the friendly faces that 
shaped my upbringing and remain good 
friends to this day. 
Monroe County holds a special place 
in my heart; and now, more than ever, 
I am proud to serve as a voice for our 
citizens right here in our Nation’s Cap-
itol.

TAKING A STAND AGAINST SANCTUARY CITIES 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to express my concern about the 
upturn of sanctuary cities across the 
United States and push for action to 
enhance public safety by further crack-
ing down on illegal immigration. 
There should be consequences for not 
following the law. Local governments 
that choose not to enforce immigration 
laws recklessly put lives at risk. Sense-
less deaths occasionally result from 
crimes committed by criminal illegal 
aliens who take refuge in sanctuary 
cities. 
Action is needed to prevent more 
harm from cities refusing to cooperate 
with Federal immigration officials. Al-
lowing cities to tie the hands of our 
brave law enforcement officers and ig-
nore the law should not be tolerated. I 
am calling on Congress to strengthen 
the safety of our communities by pass-
ing legislation banning sanctuary cit-
ies. 
But while we continue to await ac-
tion on this important issue, States are 
stepping up and making this a top pri-
ority. I want to commend the leaders 
in my home State of Kentucky who are 
taking proactive action to ban sanc-
tuary cities and strengthen public safe-
ty. The leadership they are showing on 
this issue is an important step toward 
giving law enforcement more tools to 
go after major problems like drug traf-
ficking and will benefit all Kentuck-
ians. 
DELAYED TRANSMISSION OF IMPEACHMENT 
ARTICLES 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, as of 
today, it has been 4 weeks since House 
Democrats voted, in a historically par-
tisan manner, to impeach President 
Donald Trump. 
In voting to silence the will of 63 mil-
lion Americans, they made clear that 
they were not here to work for the 
American people but to carry out a 
personal vendetta. Even a few House 
Democrats realized that impeachment 
was not in the best interest of our 
country, joining Republicans to oppose 
this baseless crusade. 
But after their vote, Speaker PELOSI 
realized they had made a grave mis-
take. Their sham process and evidence- 
free case went against the wishes of the 
American people. 
Knowing their case was baseless, 
Speaker PELOSI and House Democrats 
sat on these articles for 1 month. After 
originally claiming that impeachment 
was an urgent crisis and insisting that 
President Trump was a threat to na-
tional security, Democrats sat on their 
hands and delayed a timely trial on 
their own shoddy work product. 
But the day has finally come where 
they are sending their weak case over 
to the Senate. I look forward to the 
day where Congress may finally move 
on from this partisan impeachment 
process that has wasted an amazing 
amount of time and resources and dis-
tracted from issues that matter most 
to the American people. 
While I am disappointed that we have 
reached this sad point in this congres-
sional body, I look forward to seeing a 
more fair and responsible hearing in 
the Senate. 
f 
ROE V. WADE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, the Supreme 
Court decision in Roe v. Wade was de-
cided 47 years ago this month. Since 
abortion was made legal, more than 60 
million unborn children have had their 
lives prematurely ended. 
This is a matter of conscience, and 
just like the plurality of American peo-
ple, I believe that life begins at concep-
tion. 
In recent years, advances in science 
and medicine have given us an increas-
ingly vivid picture of what life in the 
womb is like. A child has a heartbeat 
at just 6 weeks. A child feels pain at 
just 20 weeks. Science makes it clear 
that life exists in the womb, and, 
therefore, an unborn child is entitled 
to the most fundamental of human 
rights, and that is the right to live. 
Even the plaintiff in that landmark 
case, Norma McCorvey, who at that 
time went by the name Jane Roe, 
changed her view and worked on behalf 
of the pro-life movement. She said: I 
think I have always been pro-life, but I 
just didn’t know it. 
Roe v. Wade is not only a human 
tragedy but a constitutional one as 
well. 
In our Constitution, power is divided 
among three branches: Article I, Con-
gress; Article II, the Presidency; and 
Article III, the courts. Congress makes 
the laws, the Executive enforces them, 
and the courts apply them. 
Courts should not be in the business 
of striking down acts of Congress or 
State statutes simply because the indi-
vidual judges have political disagree-
ments with what the people’s rep-
resentatives have decided. In our con-
stitutional system, judges may strike 
down laws only if those laws conflict 
with the Constitution, our country’s 
supreme law. 
But that is not what happened in Roe 
v. Wade. Five Justices created a right 
to abortion by reinterpreting the Due 
Process Clause of the Constitution. 
That clause says that no State may de-
prive anyone of life, liberty, or prop-
erty without due process of law. 
But even supporters of the decision 
have cast doubt on this justification. 
Harvard Law School’s Laurence Tribe 
wrote: ‘‘One of the most curious things

about Roe is that, behind its own 
verbal smokescreen, the substantive 
judgment on which it rests is nowhere 
to be found.’’ And even Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsberg had called the decision 
‘‘heavyhanded judicial intervention’’ 
that was ‘‘difficult to justify.’’ 
Essentially, the Court went out of its 
way to commit one of the most dra-
matic cases of judicial overreach in 
history. Instead of letting each State 
decide the issues for themselves, five 
Justices circumvented the system and 
created a decades-long human tragedy 
that continues to this day. 
Since Roe, individual States have 
been valiantly trying to impose some 
sort of moral and legal safeguards on 
abortion. They have enacted laws pro-
hibiting racial and gender discrimina-
tion 
in 
abortions; 
laws 
requiring 
women to see ultrasounds of their ba-
bies before committing to ending the 
unborn child’s life; laws prohibiting 
abortion after a fetal heartbeat has 
been detected; and laws banning dis-
memberment abortions, where the doc-
tor would have to physically tear the 
baby apart. Sadly, all of these laws 
have been struck down by judges 
claiming to follow the precedent of Roe 
v. Wade. 
The human toll of this tragic over-
reach is staggering. Not only have over 
60 million innocent children lost their 
lives, but the mothers of these children 
have had to live with the lasting psy-
chological impacts that these abor-
tions have had on them. Scientific 
studies have shown that women who 
have had abortions have a higher risk 
of mental health conditions like de-
pression. 
How could anyone turn a deaf ear and 
blind eye to the suffering of these vul-
nerable children and mothers? This 
issue transcends what it means to be 
an American and goes to the core of 
what makes us human. 
Complex issues like this one are 
often fraught with controversy and, 
yes, heated tempers; but at the heart of 
that complexity and emotion lies a 
simple fundamental truth, and that is 
that unborn children deserve human 
rights. 
I hope that one day soon the Su-
preme Court corrects their constitu-
tional error so that the American peo-
ple can reassert their voice in deter-
mining the moral question of our time. 
f 
HONORING THE SERVICE AND 
LEGACY OF DR. DEBORAH FRANK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today 
I am here to recognize the career of a 
colleague whose work has always been 
an inspiration, not just to me, but to 
countless healthcare providers, stu-
dents, advocates, and patients alike, 
Dr. Deborah Frank. 
Dr. Frank is a woman of many tal-
ents and passions. Notably, she has 
served as a professor of pediatrics at 
Boston University School of Medicine. 
One of Dr. Frank’s most impactful 
community 
contributions 
began 
in 
1984, when she founded the Grow Clinic 
for Children at Boston Medical Center. 
The Grow Clinic is an outpatient clinic 
that produces comprehensive specialty 
medical, nutritional, developmental, 
social services, and dietary assistance 
to children. 
She is also the founder and principal 
investigator 
of 
Children’s 
Health 
Watch, the Grow Clinic’s outreach and 
research arm, which is a network of pe-
diatric and public health researchers 
who, like Dr. Frank, are committed to 
improving child health in America. 
The Grow Clinic serves a diverse pa-
tient population of mostly low-income 
families from some of Greater Boston’s 
poorest communities. But what made 
the Grow Clinic an essential part of the 
community is not just its dedication to 
the underserved and underprivileged; it 
was Dr. Frank’s commitment to gain-
ing a deeper understanding about the 
social determinants of her patients’ 
health. 
Her patients knew that they could go 
to her for their needs beyond physical 
health. She cared about whether they 
had housing or warm clothing. She 
cared about whether they had healthy 
and nutritious food to eat and whether 
they were getting enough of it. She 
even started a food pantry at Boston 
Medical Center to address her patients’ 
needs. 
Dr. Frank knew that there is more to 
health than metrics and vitals. It is 
also your environment and support sys-
tem. Part of what makes Dr. Frank’s 
legacy remarkable is that she found a 
way to become part of that support 
system. 
She came into this line of work with 
a vision and purpose and, in the proc-
ess, has changed countless lives in Mas-
sachusetts and beyond. 
Dr. Frank has testified many times 
before Congress on numerous occa-
sions, raising awareness on the growing 
problem of national hunger and its ef-
fects on children. She has literally spo-
ken truth to power. Her work will con-
tinue to shape the way that healthcare 
professionals and policymakers under-
stand the correlation between chil-
dren’s nutrition and health. 
Whether she is teaching medical stu-
dents about ‘‘failure to thrive,’’ mak-
ing sure her patients have food, or ad-
vocating against the criminalization 
and stigmatization of addicted moth-
ers, Dr. Frank is a true fighter. 
She may say she retired, but, hon-
estly, I don’t believe it. Her life’s work 
of enriching the health and well-being 
of those around her will not only con-
tinue through the organizations that 
she has worked in her entire life and 
her entire career, but also through the 
lives of the children and the families 
for whom she has advocated. I am sure 
that she will continue to stand up for 
what she believes in, and I thank her 
for her service to her community and 
to our country. 
Finally, I also thank her for her 
friendship. She is one of my heroes. 
She is an inspiration to me and to so 
many other people, and she is a be-
liever that we can change the world. 
With her leadership and her inspira-
tion, I believe we can do great things 
like end hunger in this country once 
and for all. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I want to say to Dr. 
Frank, on behalf of all my colleagues, 
thank you for the incredible work that 
you have done, and we look forward to 
continuing to work with you and to be 
guided by your values and your pas-
sion.

HONORING THE SERVICE AND 
LEGACY OF CARL ADRIAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, Presi-
dent Eisenhower said: ‘‘The supreme 
quality for leadership is unquestion-
able integrity. Without it, no real suc-
cess is possible.’’ Today, I rise to recog-
nize a man of integrity, a friend, and a 
true community leader. 
Carl Adrian has served as president 
and CEO of the Tri-Cities Economic 
Development Council for 16 years. Dur-
ing his tenure, Tri-Cities has added 
more than 35,000 jobs, over 1,300 new 
businesses, and nearly 90,000 new resi-
dents, which is a 30 percent increase in 
population. 
Tri-Cities is a national leader in agri-
cultural food processing and viticul-
ture, cutting-edge science and tech-
nology advancements, and energy sec-
tor development—in countless ways, 
due to Carl’s advocacy and vision. 
From 
his 
service 
on 
numerous 
boards, including Visit Tri-Cities and 
Benton-Franklin Council of Govern-
ments, and his efforts co-chairing the 
search for a new WSU Tri-Cities chan-
cellor to his lasting commitment for 
the cleanup at Hanford, Carl Adrian 
demonstrates the best of what it means 
to be a public servant. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Carl and 
Rheta on his much-deserved retire-
ment. Our sincere thanks for all of his 
service to the Tri-Cities. 
CONGRATULATING KAYLA BARRON 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, when 
Kayla 
Barron, 
of 
Richland, 
Wash-
ington, graduated from high school, 
she attended the Naval Academy, com-
missioning as a Navy officer, and was 
among the first class of women com-
missioned to be a submarine officer. 
Now she is one of just 48 NASA astro-
nauts in the Nation and could be the 
first woman to land on the Moon. 
Kayla was chosen as one of more than 
18,000 applicants for NASA’s astronaut 
basic training program, graduating 
with her 12 classmates on January 10. 
As she works to design the spacesuit 
for NASA’s Artemis program, she and 
her classmates will prepare to com-
plete the program’s mission: return hu-
mans to the Moon by 2024 and send peo-
ple to Mars.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H248 
January 15, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Kayla on 
her remarkable accomplishments. I ap-
plaud her ability and willingness to go 
above and beyond to set an example for 
women of all ages who may be inter-
ested in going where no woman has 
gone before. She has made, and con-
tinues to make, our community proud. 
Central Washington is rooting for her.

CENTRAL WASHINGTON FIREFIGHTERS AIDING IN 
AUSTRALIA 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, over 
the past month, devastating bushfires 
have burned over 12.5 million acres of 
land in Australia. More than 200 Amer-
ican firefighters have been dispatched 
to Australia to help combat and con-
tain these devastating fires, including 
two firefighters from central Wash-
ington. 
In the West, we recognize the cata-
strophic impact wildfires have on local 
communities, on ecosystems, and on 
environments. My congressional dis-
trict recently experienced some of the 
worst wildfires in our State’s history. 
When we were in need, Australian fire-
fighters were eager to help, and now 
our local heroes are returning the 
favor. 
As we work to improve land manage-
ment here at home, I am proud to co-
sponsor a resolution introduced by my 
friends Representatives PANETTA and 
LAMALFA of California to support the 
longstanding partnership between the 
U.S. and Australia as we share fire-
fighting resources in times of crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join me in applauding the 
firefighters, both American and Aus-
tralian, who put their lives on the line 
to protect our land, our wildlife, and 
our loved ones. 
f 
TODAY IS A GREAT DAY FOR 
AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, today 
is a great day for America. It is great 
day 
for 
American 
agriculture 
and 
American manufacturing. 
Today, the President signs phase one 
of the China trade deal. But this news, 
the most important news of the day, 
won’t be covered much by the national 
media. Instead, the story, the photo of 
the day will be Speaker PELOSI parad-
ing her tardy Articles of Impeachment 
to the Senate with pomp and cir-
cumstance. America can only hope this 
is the last chapter on this side of the 
capitol of this made-for-TV impeach-
ment charade. 
Why won’t the national media cover 
this trade agreement story? Because it 
is another example of a promise made, 
promise kept by our President. It is an-
other example of our President’s poli-
cies working. 
Once the Chinese trade agreement is 
completed, the President will have re-
negotiated over half of our country’s 
export-import business. Now, that is 
making America great again. That is 
the art of the deal. 
As part of the phase one agreement, 
China will buy $200 billion worth of 
American goods and services over the 
next 2 years, nearly doubling our U.S. 
exports to the country and further nar-
rowing the gap of our longstanding 
trade agreements and deficits. Agri-
culture goods will account for nearly 
$100 billion of these purchases, pro-
viding a much-needed boost to the in-
dustry that accounts for more than 40 
percent of our Kansas State’s economy. 
All this increase in exports only adds 
to our Nation’s GDP. 
In the near term, this deal brings an 
end to the threat of additional tariffs 
that have caused commodity prices to 
fluctuate, giving producers more cer-
tainty and the ability to better plan 
for the upcoming growing seasons. Our 
farmers and ranchers have borne the 
brunt of the effects of this trade battle, 
and I am happy to say things will get 
better soon. The patriotism our Kansas 
producers have shown has been nothing 
short of honorable. 
Now, concerns about China upholding 
its end of the phase one agreement are 
indeed legitimate. Decades of China re-
neging on commitments aren’t lost on 
me, but thankfully our negotiation 
team, led by our trade representative 
Bob Lighthizer and a fellow Kansan, 
Gregg Doud, require that this deal in-
clude the authority for the President 
to swiftly reinstate all tariffs and im-
pose new ones, if needed, and thus 
avoid the long, drawn-out decisions by 
the WTO. 
Global trade disputes don’t end over-
night, and as the President and his 
team have acknowledged, there is still 
a lot of work to be done on China. 
Phase two negotiations are already 
well under way, and I will continue to 
advocate for Kansas agriculture and 
manufacturing directly to this admin-
istration. 
President Trump’s efforts to solidify 
deals with our four largest export mar-
kets, Mexico, Canada, Japan, and now 
China will give Kansans the confidence 
needed to move into the next decade 
and beyond. These four countries, 
along with the completed trade deal 
with South Korea, represent over half 
of our country’s trade. This sets the 
stage for the rest of our trade agree-
ments. 
We made it through this hard pass, 
and better days of fair and reciprocal 
trade lie ahead for many generations. 
I thank the President and our entire 
trade team at USTR for their efforts to 
protect and grow American jobs, to im-
prove wages, for their commitment to 
make and keep America great. Keep up 
the good work. 
f 
RECOGNIZING ZENA CARDMAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. 
Zena Cardman, a recent graduate of 
NASA’s 
Astronaut 
Candidate 
Class 
XXII, and a native of Urbana, Illinois. 
Zena was selected in 2017 from a pool 
of more than 18,000 applicants as some 
of the brightest and most skilled minds 
in the country. The past 2 years of 
training and her graduation from can-
didate school earned her the title of as-
tronaut, and she is now eligible for 
spaceflight. 
As a new grad, Zena will support 
NASA’s current missions, such as the 
work aboard the International Space 
Station, the Commercial Crew Pro-
gram, and the Artemis Program, which 
has set a goal of sending humans back 
to the Moon by 2024. 
I am proud to recognize Zena today 
as one of the best minds in space explo-
ration. I know she will be an invaluable 
asset to NASA. I extend a well-de-
served congratulations to Zena and 
congratulate her on her graduation. I 
thank her for all she has done. 
REMEMBERING FRANK MITCHELL 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to remember 
Frank Mitchell, a native of Springfield, 
Illinois, and the first African American 
House of Representatives page since 
Reconstruction. 
As 
a 
student 
at 
Feitshans High School, Frank was 
asked to interview for a position as a 
page for then-Congressman Paul Fin-
dley. When the school principal, my 
good friend, Irv Smith, called to say 
they had selected Frank, according to 
articles just recently, Frank said he 
went out and he bought some suits, got 
a haircut, and headed for Washington. 
After his year-long stint as a House 
page, Frank graduated from Feitshans 
in 1967 and went on to work as a news-
paper and TV reporter before accepting 
positions with the Illinois Attorney 
General’s Office and eventually Cook 
County’s Stroger Hospital. He is well- 
known across the State for his work 
with the Illinois Fatherhood Initiative. 
Congressman 
Paul 
Findley’s 
son, 
Craig, who now chairs the Illinois Pris-
on Review Board, said Frank’s appoint-
ment to the House as a page was one of 
his father’s proudest accomplishments. 
Frank brought credit to the page sys-
tem, Craig said, and I admired him for 
his service and his friendship for dec-
ades. 
Almost everyone that knew Frank 
felt that way. They admired him for 
his service and his friendship. Frank 
was a well-loved part of the Springfield 
community for years. I had the oppor-
tunity to meet many of his family 
members and also those who helped 
Frank, and who Frank helped through 
his career in public service when I went 
to his services in Springfield just a few 
weeks ago. 
For so many, Frank was a role 
model, he was a mentor, and he is part 
of the history in this institution that 
so many of us have had the opportunity 
to serve in this great Nation in the 
House of Representatives.

ever we are doing—to heal and to help, 
to give strength and make us whole. 
On this day, the House and the Sen-
ate draw our Nation’s attention as the 
process of impeachment moves for-
ward. Bless all Members of Congress 
with wisdom; give them the courage to

goodwill and respect. 
May all that is done this day, and in 
the days to come, be for Your greater 
honor and glory. 
Amen.

Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, pursu-
ant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

the ayes appeared to have it. 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I object 
to the vote on the ground that a

point of order that a quorum is not 
present. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8, rule XX, further pro-

The point of no quorum is considered 
withdrawn.

Mr. TED LIEU of California led the

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

HONORING CLIFFORD BELL 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, today, on the birthday of 
Martin Luther King, I rise to recognize 
a Buffalo, New York, resident born the 
same year as Dr. King, who continues 
to serve as a local church, community, 
and business leader, my good friend, 
Clifford Bell. 
Brother Bell, as he is known in west-
ern New York for the love he brings to 
all of those around him, has served as 
a senior business advisor to Buffalo 
State’s Small Business Development 
Center. 
He was a colleague of mine in the 
city of Buffalo Common Council and he 
has led the Martin Luther King, Jr., 
celebration in Buffalo for three dec-
ades. As a council member Brother Bell 
was known for the line: ‘‘For whom the 
bell tolls. This Bell tolls for you,’’ a 
quote that historically references the 
interconnectedness of humanity and 
his commitment to service. 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in his 
‘‘Where Do We Go From Here?’’ address 
said: ‘‘Hate is too great a burden to 
bear. I have decided to love.’’ 
Brother Bell has lived a life of love, 
representing the best of our commu-
nity and our country. We, as a Nation, 
can learn from his example.

CONGRATULATING GENERAL JOHN 
RAYMOND 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Gen-
eral John W. Raymond, who was sworn 
in yesterday as the first Chief of Space 
Operations for the newly established 
U.S. Space Force. 
As a senior Member of the House 
Armed 
Services 
Committee, 
I 
am 
grateful to President Donald Trump for 
General Raymond’s confirmation and 
for being able to attend the National 
Defense 
Authorization 
Act 
signing 
which officially established the U.S. 
Space Force. 
General Raymond is a Clemson Uni-
versity alumnus and has over 30 years 
of military experience. ‘‘This establish-
ment is absolutely critical to our na-
tional security,’’ he said during his re-
marks after being sworn in. 
I am grateful that the U.S. Space 
Force is in strong, capable hands. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th, defeating terrorists overseas, in 
the global war on terrorism with the 
courageous 
leadership 
of 
President 
Donald Trump.

ALPHA KAPPA ALPHA FOUNDER’S 
DAY 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
we should take a moment to honor an 
outstanding organization, Alpha Kappa 
Alpha. This is their Founders Day—112 
years old. 
Isn’t 
it 
interesting 
that 
young 
women who were in the shadow of the 
Emancipation Proclamation and the 
shadow of slavery, in the midst of Jim 
Crow-ism and on the precipice of World 
War I, organized at Howard University 
to be able to give African American 
women a place for leadership and civic- 
mindedness? 
As we are on the precipice of a great 
historic moment dealing with pro-
tecting the Constitution here in the 
United States Congress and the United 
States Senate, I am glad to honor these 
women that included Ethel Hedgeman, 
Margaret Flagg Holmes, Marjorie Hill, 
Lillie Burke, Beulah Elizabeth Burke, 
Anna Easter Brown, and many other 
young women who decided to take a 
stand for what is right in this Nation 
and the opportunities of diversity and 
leadership. 
Congratulations 
to 
our 
national 
president, Dr. Glover, and congratula-
tions to all of our Alpha Kappa Alpha 
members throughout the United States 
of America. Happy Founders Day 112.

IMPEACHMENT COLLAPSE 
(Mr. BYRNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1

Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, after a 
long, embarrassing month, the House 
will finally transmit the Articles of 
Impeachment against President Trump 
to the United States Senate. Yet I un-
derstand Speaker PELOSI and her man-
agers will continue to push for wit-
nesses in the Senate trial because, in 
their words, they want the facts. 
That claim is nonsense. House Demo-
crats blocked the testimony of the

whistleblower, DNC staffer Alexandra 
Chalupa, Nellie Ohr with Fusion GPS, 
and, of course, the two gentlemen pic-
tured to my left, Devon Archer and 
Hunter Biden. 
In reality, the Democrats’ entire case 
depended on hiding the facts. As more 
facts emerged last year, their case col-
lapsed. Public support for their im-
peachment fell as the weakness of their 
case was exposed. 
I remind my majority that what is 
good for the goose is good for the gan-

fare as well blocking these witnesses in 
MITCH MCCONNELL’s United States Sen-
ate. 
f 
FULL AND FAIR TRIAL REQUIRED 
IN U.S. SENATE 
(Mr. TED LIEU of California asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam 
Speaker, yesterday the House released 
additional documents and new text 
messages from Lev Parnas. He is an as-
sociate of Donald Trump’s personal at-
torney, Rudy Giuliani. He has also 
been indicted. These documents and 
text messages show a chilling picture 
of surveillance, both physical and elec-
tronic, of the U.S. Ambassador to 
Ukraine. This is all the more reason 
why we need to have a full and fair 
trial in the United States Senate. 
The House today is going to transmit 
the Articles of Impeachment to the 
Senate. Donald Trump was impeached 
for abusing his power and for soliciting 
interference in our elections from a 
foreign government. He will be branded 
for the rest of his life. It is permanent, 
it will not go away, and now we need 
the Senate to act and have a fair trial. 
That means witnesses and documents. 
If they do not do that, it will be the 
equivalent of a coverup. 
f 
RECOGNIZING DANIELLE HOUSER 
(Mr. DUNN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an outstanding 
member of my staff who is moving on 
to a career in the defense sector, 
Danielle Houser. 
Danielle graduated from UF in 2015 
with a degree in international and 
global studies. She then moved to D.C. 
to begin her career on Capitol Hill. In 
January of 2017 she helped open our 
D.C. office as my executive assistant, 
later moving into a legislative role and 
becoming my legislative aide for mili-
tary and defense affairs. 
After Hurricane Michael devastated 
the panhandle, DJ played a key role in 
ensuring Tyndall Air Force Base and 
all of our bases had the resources they 
needed to begin recovery. DJ is a force 
of 
nature. 
She 
is 
ambitious, 
dis-
ciplined, hardworking, cheerful, and a 
joy to work with. She has been an inte-
gral part of my office since its incep-
tion, and we will miss her greatly. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in 
recognizing Danielle Houser for all 
that she has done for north Florida and 
our Nation and wish her luck in all her 
future endeavors. 
f 
THE 19TH AMENDMENT 
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, this 
weekend I will join hundreds of activ-
ists and supporters for the Women’s 
March in Seneca Falls, New York, 
home of the historic 1848 Women’s 
Rights Convention that sparked the 
suffrage movement. 
We will celebrate the incredible 
strides we have made in the fight for 
women’s rights and the many strong, 
courageous women who have shattered 
glass ceilings to achieve progress. 
The year 2020 marks the 100th anni-
versary of the passage of the 19th 
Amendment, guaranteeing and pro-
tecting women’s constitutional right 
to vote. Now more than ever as we face 
new barriers threatening to roll back 
the rights of women, we must take up 
the mantle of Susan B. Anthony and 
the suffragists who came before us to 
continue to fight for the full equality 
that all women deserve. Together we 
will keep persisting.

CONGRATULATING RICHARD N. 
REILLY 
(Mr. RUTHERFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate Richard N. 
Reilly on a well-deserved retirement 
after many years of service to the 
United States of America. 
Richard has been a U.S. State De-
partment Pearson Fellow in my Wash-
ington, D.C., office over this past year 
and has provided invaluable guidance 
and assistance to both my staff and my 
constituents. 
A native of Minnesota, Rich began 
his service to our Nation as an Army 
infantryman and then he continued on 
later with a 20-year career as a naval 
officer. Following his time in the mili-
tary, Rich joined the State Department 
as a Foreign Service officer advocating 
for America’s interests abroad. 
On behalf of the Fourth District of 
Florida and a grateful Nation, I offer 
my heartfelt thanks to Rich for his 
many contributions to our country and 
wish him a relaxing and fulfilling re-
tirement enjoyed with wife, Susan; his 
children; and their new granddaughter, 
Peyton. 
Congratulations, Rich. 
ENOUGH ALREADY: IT IS TIME TO 
FREE RAIF BADAWI 
(Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
speak today for Raif Badawi, a Saudi 
Arabian human rights blogger unjustly 
imprisoned since 2012 for exercising his 
right to freedom of expression. 
His supposed crime? 
Criticizing Islam and the religious 
police. 
His sentence? 
Ten years in prison, 1,000 lashes, and 
a huge fine. 
Monday, January 13, was Raif’s 36th 
birthday—the eighth he spent in prison 
away from his wife and three children. 
January 9 was the fifth anniversary 
of the day that Raif endured the first 
50 of those 1,000 lashes. That the flog-
ging has not continued is a small 
mercy, but the prolonged imprison-
ment and harsh conditions is taking a 
terrible physical and mental toll. 
The Saudi authorities must end this 
egregious injustice. 
Madam Speaker, I again demand the 
immediate and unconditional release of 
prisoner of conscience, Raif Badawi. 
I renew my call for a halt to all 
weapons sales and military aid until 
the Saudi regime cleans up its human 
rights record which is appalling. 
f 
CELEBRATING THE RIGHT TO LIFE 
(Ms. FOXX of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, life is the most precious gift 
from God. From conception until nat-
ural death and every moment in be-
tween, we must recognize, celebrate, 
and bear witness to the sanctity of life. 
Next Friday tens of thousands of peo-
ple from across the country will come 
to Washington and participate in the 
March for Life. This event serves as a 
clear reminder that preserving and pro-
tecting the lives of the most vulnerable 
is not simply an option, it is a mandate 
that we all must uphold. 
Madam Speaker, I refuse to stand 
idly by as the unborn are brazenly tar-
geted. Amidst the shroud of rancor and 
divisiveness that hangs over this House 
at present, I will continue to fight for 
their right to life. They deserve noth-
ing less than unwavering advocates.

JUNE PARKINSON REMEMBRANCE 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my constituent and 
friend, June Parkinson. June passed 
away on January 4 at the age of 64. 
June was a loving wife, mother, and 
grandmother, a gifted artist and spe-
cial education teacher, and a true com-
munity leader. She devoted her life in

service to others sharing her talents 
for the betterment of us all. 
June was a longtime committee-per-
son of the Greater Glenside Patriotic 
Association and chairperson of the 
Glenside Fourth of July Parade. The 
annual parade is the longest contin-
uous 
Independence 
Day 
parade 
in 
America and the pride of our home-
town of Glenside. June made it her 
mission each year to ensure this treas-
ured tradition continued. 
June was an environmental activist 
best remembered for spearheading the 
yearly Earth Day clean-up of Keswick 
Avenue. 
Even though June was born in Boston 
and was a Red Sox fan, all of us Phil-
lies fans in Glenside embraced and 
thanked her for her kind heart, her giv-
ing spirit, and her dedication to com-
munity. 
I join June’s friends, family, and the 
wider Glenside community in mourn-
ing her loss. I am thankful for June’s 
example of quiet acts of service, and I 
am better for having known June.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL 
MENTORING MONTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize January as National Mentoring 
Month, when we volunteer our time to 
provide support and guidance for our 
Nation’s young people so they are bet-
ter equipped to tackle personal and 
professional challenges. 
A good mentor could be a friend, a 
family member, a boss, or a school 
counselor. Effective counseling prior to 
graduation can assist students in mak-
ing better informed decisions about 
their educational options and career 
prospects. 
That is why Congressman JIM LAN-
GEVIN and I introduced the Counseling 
for Career Choice Act. Despite a great 
deal of money being invested to im-
prove education, very little has been 
spent to address career development 
specifically. This bill authorizes a 
grant program to give States and local 
education agencies access to current 
counseling programs or the means to 
implement 
new 
counseling 
frame-
works. 
Additionally, the bill provides re-
sources to ensure counselors can sup-
port their students to the best of their 
abilities. When we equip students with 
the tools that they need to succeed, 
they embark on educational journeys 
that lead to rewarding careers. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to join Congressman LANGEVIN 
and I in support of H.R. 5092, the Coun-
seling for Career Choice Act. 
SUPPORT RELIEF FOR NUCLEAR 
DISTRICTS 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today for our Nation’s commu-
nities saddled with stranded nuclear 
waste stockpiles because the Federal 
Government has failed to meet its obli-
gation to find a permanent repository. 
My constituents in Zion understand 
this all too well. After its nuclear plant 
closed in 1998, 2 million pounds of spent 
nuclear fuel remains. 
Literally sitting on the shores of 
Lake Michigan, the more than 50 casks 
severely affect the quality of life of the 
residents of Zion. It deters economic 
investment, depresses home values, 
drives up property taxes, and stretches 
the city’s already-thin budget. 
Today, I am proud to reintroduce the 
STRANDED Act to, at last, provide 
some compensation for these affected 
communities. Zion is not alone. Across 
the country, there are more than a 
dozen communities with nuclear plants 
at various stages of decommissioning, 
with more to come. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for 
the support and leadership of Com-
mittee on Appropriations Chairwoman 
NITA LOWEY and Subcommittee on En-
ergy and Water Development, and Re-
lated Agencies Chairwoman MARCY 
KAPTUR in reintroducing this bill. 
Together, we are fighting to make 
the Federal Government do right for 
communities like Zion, and I urge my 
colleagues to join us.

HONORING THE LIFE OF WILLIE 
BELTON 
(Mr. ABRAHAM asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam Speaker, the 
people of Louisiana recently lost a re-
spected political leader, a businessman, 
a war veteran, and a civil rights leader, 
Mr. Willie Belton. 
Mr. Belton had a life of a service to 
others. He was awarded the Bronze 
Star and the Purple Heart under fire, 
heroically, during the Korean war. 
He marched with Dr. Martin Luther 
King in Washington, Alabama, Ten-
nessee, and Mississippi. Like Dr. King, 
Mr. Belton always advocated Christian 
values and nonviolent protests. He also 
led his local NAACP chapter in Lou-
isiana. In February 2019, he was award-
ed the Louisiana Medal of Honor. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in 
honoring his lifetime of service to Lou-
isiana and a Louisiana treasure, Mr. 
Willie Belton, whose memory will, for-
tunately, live with us forever. 
f 
HONORING JULIE BORNSTEIN 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Julie Bornstein 
on her retirement from the Coachella 
Valley Housing Coalition. 
For more than 30 years, Julie has 
worked tirelessly as an advocate for af-
fordable 
housing 
throughout 
the 
Coachella Valley. She has dedicated 
her career to making a difference in 
the lives of thousands of individuals in 
Riverside and Imperial Counties. 
Her leadership has been instrumental 
in raising awareness about the home-
lessness issue so many members of our 
communities face. Through her efforts, 
we have seen an increase in the avail-
ability of affordable housing through-
out the Inland Empire. 
Apart from her work in the Coachella 
Valley Housing Coalition, Julie served 
in the California State Assembly and 
was chosen to serve as the chair of the 
Democratic Caucus. 
She went on to serve as director of 
the California Department of Housing 
and Community Development. Later, 
Julie was appointed CEO and president 
of the Campaign for Affordable Hous-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, Julie’s work has not 
gone unnoticed, and the Coachella Val-
ley is a better place because of her. We 
wish her a happy retirement.

CELEBRATING MARTIN LUTHER 
KING JR. DAY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Dr. Martin Luther King, today being 
his actual birthday, 91 years ago, in 
1929. 
Dr. King has become synonymous 
with the civil rights movement and the 
right to ensure each and every one of 
us is treated equally, regardless of our 
background and upbringing. 
His strong Christian beliefs helped 
him inspire positive social change 
through peaceful protests and dem-
onstrations. 
In a nation plagued by identity poli-
tics, his pursuit of liberty is as rel-
evant now as it was during the 1960s. 
Dr. King demonstrated to the world 
that it is not the color of a person’s 
skin that mattered but, rather, the na-
ture of their character. Indeed, it is 
one of my favorite quotes and one to 
live by. 
The work of Dr. King is not yet done. 
He remains a shining example of the 
right way to lead, the right way to 
peacefully protest, and the right way 
to inspire. 
I look forward to joining the celebra-
tion at the Southside Community Cen-
ter in Oroville, California, this coming 
Monday, where his legacy is celebrated 
and even brought forward by scholar-
ships for the young people who will be 
there.

HONORING MARTIN LUTHER KING 
JR. DAY 
(Mr. DELGADO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. DELGADO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor one of my heroes, 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who was 
born on this day, 91 years ago. 
Next Monday, the Nation will pay 
tribute to this incredible man and his 
life, as well as his enduring legacy, a 
legacy rooted in unconditional love. 
In these difficult and divided times 
plagued by the rise of hate, I can’t 
think of a better legacy to reflect upon 
as we embark upon this year. 
The road ahead will be difficult for 
our Nation, but I am encouraged by 
and find great hope in the following 
words once spoke by Dr. King: ‘‘We can 
no longer afford to worship the god of 
hate or bow before the altar of retalia-
tion. The oceans of history are made 
turbulent by the ever-rising tides of 
hate. History is cluttered with the 
wreckage of nations and individuals 
that pursued the self-defeating path of 
hate. . . . ‘Love is the ultimate force 
that makes for the saving choice of life 
and good against the damming choice 
of death and evil. Therefore, the first 
hope in our inventory must be the hope 
that love is going to have the last 
word.’ ’’

STOP IMPEACHMENT AND 
SUPPORT PRESIDENT TRUMP 
(Mr. BANKS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, during 
the President’s upcoming State of the 
Union Address, he has the opportunity 
to deliver a strong message of unity, 
peace, and hope to all of those who 
tune in, both Americans and all who 
are watching abroad. 
Just in the last few months, we have 
seen that America is the beacon of 
hope for the people of Hong Kong and 
Taipei, who are suffering under pres-
sure from Beijing. We have seen that 
America is the lifeline for people in 
Beirut and Tehran who find themselves 
under the thumb of the Iranian regime. 
This is a critical moment in world 
history. People are looking to the 
United States and our President for 
leadership more than ever. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues in the majority party to re-
frain the impeachment antics and cha-
rades. Don’t be petty. Rise above your 
worst impulses and support our Presi-
dent. The world is watching. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.

PROVIDE CONSUMER 
PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENTS 
(Mrs. HAYES asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. HAYES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.J. Res. 76, a resolution 
of disapproval of the Secretary of Edu-
cation’s new borrower defense rule. 
This rule guts consumer protections 
for students and taxpayers and makes 
it more difficult for students to access 
relief for loans obtained for degrees 
that have no value. 
Over 1,200 students in Connecticut 
have been defrauded by predatory for- 
profit colleges like Corinthian and ITT 
Tech and still await relief. The Depart-
ment has made the approval process 
more difficult, leaving hundreds of 
thousands 
of 
students 
desperately 
waiting for answers. 
Too many first-generation, low-in-
come students, student veterans, and 
students of color are lured into these 
fraudulent schools that prioritize prof-
its over helping students advance their 
education. 
The DeVos rule eliminates automatic 
closed school discharges and weakens 
the early warning system that forces 
institutions to invest in the potential 
debt relief. It puts a greater burden of 
proof on students, barring them from 
relief if they cannot file their claims 
fast enough. 
As a career educator who truly un-
derstands the equalizing power of edu-
cation, I say it is unconscionable that 
the Department of Education and the 
Secretary do not feel a moral impera-
tive to protect students. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this resolution.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF PRESTON 
COPE AND BAILEY HOLT 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in remembrance of the precious 
lives of Preston Cope and Bailey Holt, 
two victims of a tragic school shooting 
at Marshall County High School in 
Benton, Kentucky, 2 years ago. This 
tragic event devastated the Benton 
community and took two lives away 
from us far too soon. 
Preston and Bailey continue to be 
dearly missed by their families and the 
Marshall County community, which 
has shown incredible resilience in the 
face of trying circumstances. Preston 
Cope and Bailey Holt remain in our 
hearts and minds to this day.

APPOINTING 
AND 
AUTHORIZING 
MANAGERS FOR IMPEACHMENT 
TRIAL OF DONALD JOHN TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 767, I send 
to the desk the resolution (H. Res. 798) 
appointing and authorizing managers 
for the impeachment trial of Donald 
John Trump, President of the United 
States, and ask for its immediate con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the resolution. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 798 
Resolved, That Mr. Schiff, Mr. Nadler, Ms. 
Lofgren, Mr. Jeffries, Mrs. Demings, Mr. 
Crow, and Ms. Garcia of Texas are appointed 
managers to conduct the impeachment trial 
against Donald John Trump, President of the 
United States, that a message be sent to the 
Senate to inform the Senate of these ap-
pointments, and that the managers so ap-
pointed may, in connection with the prepara-
tion and the conduct of the trial, exhibit the 
articles of impeachment to the Senate and 
take all other actions necessary, which may 
include the following: 
(1) Employing legal, clerical, and other 
necessary assistants and incurring such 
other expenses as may be necessary, to be 
paid from amounts available to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary under applicable ex-
pense resolutions or from the applicable ac-
counts of the House of Representatives. 
(2) Sending for persons and papers, and fil-
ing with the Secretary of the Senate, on the 
part of the House of Representatives, any 
pleadings, in conjunction with or subsequent 
to, the exhibition of the articles of impeach-
ment that the managers consider necessary. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 767, the resolu-
tion is debatable for 10 minutes equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. COLLINS) each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
b 1230 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 2 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, the resolution be-
fore us today appoints managers to 
prosecute the Senate impeachment 
trial of President Trump. 
This trial is necessary because Presi-
dent Trump gravely abused the power 
of his office when he strong-armed a 
foreign government to announce inves-
tigations into his domestic political 
rival. He betrayed our country when he 
used powers of his office, including 
withholding vital U.S. military assist-
ance, to pressure that government to 
help him win reelection. 
He invited foreign interference into 
our elections again. He jeopardized our 
national security. He did all of this for 
his personal political gain. 
And then he violated the Constitu-
tion by stonewalling Congress’ efforts 
to investigate, ordering an absolute 
blockade of evidence. Despite that, the 
House was able to uncover powerful 
evidence that demonstrates, beyond a 
doubt, the President’s betrayal and 
violations of the Constitution. 
But we still have not heard the whole 
truth because the President has refused 
to allow a single document to be 
turned over to the House in response to 
our impeachment subpoenas, and he

January 15, 2020 
has prevented us from hearing key wit-
nesses as well. This is unprecedented. 
Our Speaker has led our fight to a 
fair trial in the Senate. Above all, a 
fair trial must include additional docu-
ments and all relevant witnesses. 
The American people have common 
sense. They know that any trial that 
does not allow witnesses is not a trial; 
it is a coverup. 
The Speaker’s insistence on this 
point has gotten results. Just yester-
day, we received critical new evidence 
from the President’s former associate, 
Lev Parnas, that further proves Mr. 
Trump’s scheme to pressure Ukraine to 
go after his personal political oppo-
nents. 
New witness testimony has become 
available 
as 
well, 
including 
John 
Bolton’s announcement that he would 
honor a Senate subpoena. 
Under today’s resolution, the man-
agers also have broad authority to sub-
mit to the Senate any additional evi-
dence the House may acquire on its 
own, and we will do so. 
The Senate is on trial. We will see 
whether they conduct a fair trial and 
allow the witnesses or conduct a cover-
up. Today’s resolution is the next step 
in this serious and solemn constitu-
tional process. I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the resolution, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
This impeachment process has been 
flawed from the outset. It resembles 
not a congressional action; it resem-
bles, more, a Dr. Seuss book, knowing 
not which way it goes. 
On September 24, the Speaker de-
clared at a press conference the House 
was conducting an impeachment in-
quiry. However, contrary to the Speak-
er’s decree that we were all of a sudden 
in an impeachment inquiry, the House 
did not authorize the impeachment in-
quiry until October 30 by adopting H. 
Res. 660. 
It was said just a moment ago that 
the Speaker has been leading the fight 
for a fair trial in the Senate. I wish the 
Speaker had been leading for a fair 
hearing 
in 
the 
House 
instead 
of 
trashing our rules. 
For those 71 out of 78 days, from the 
time it was announced at a press con-
ference to the time we finished, the 
President was not permitted to partici-
pate in these meetings. Think of that: 
71 days out of 78 in which we actually 
did something on impeachment, he was 
not presented the ability to cross-ex-
amine fact witnesses, present counter-
arguments, no due process at all in 
those 71 days. 
When presented with the oppor-
tunity, when it came to the Judiciary 
Committee, instead of the Judiciary 
Committee stepping up and actually 
acting like the Judiciary Committee, 
the committee of impeachment, we 
punted. 
We had some law professors who al-
ready had their basic talking points. 
He could have cross-examined them. 
That would have done a lot of good. 
Then we could have had witnesses of 
staffers who testified—again, a lot of 
good. 
Where were the fact witnesses? In-
stead of the rubber stamp that we were 
warned about 20 years ago by the cur-
rent chairman, we became the rubber 
stamp. 
Democrats repeatedly violated House 
rules and blatantly abused the rules 
they wrote in H. Res. 660. Even to this 
day, we will pass this out in violation 
of H. Res. 660. 
They used inflammatory rhetoric 
haunting them because this is what 
they had to do. 
One Democrat said: I call for im-
peachment today because it is one heck 
of an emergency. 
Another said: We have a crime in 
progress. We have an emergency in our 
national election that is going on right 
now. 
But my favorite, in December: It is a 
crime spree in progress. 
Oh, the hyperbole just reeks in this 
room. 
When we understand this, if it was 
such an emergency, if it was in lieu to 
finding a 911 call, then why did we hold 
this for almost a month? Well, we have 
been told that it is to help have a Sen-
ate fair trial—be damned the House in-
appropriate process we had. 
But even now that the process was 
bad, I am going to go back, and let’s 
make sure the facts are here because 
they still haven’t changed: 
A phone call that was put out in a 
transcript in which no pressure was ap-
plied, there was no conditionality on 
anything given in that call or since to 
do that. 
There was also nothing given by the 
Ukrainians to actually get this money 
that was released, by the way, before— 
it was actually a statutory deadline of 
September 31. They did nothing. They 
got the money anyway. 
But the problem is they want the 
Senate to do their job for them. But 
that is not how it works. You see, the 
Speaker—and what I have heard today 
even 
from 
folks 
giving 
1-minutes, 
Madam Speaker, is this was all they 
wanted. It was a political impeach-
ment. They have said he is impeached 
for life. 
This shows the true motivation, I be-
lieve, of the other side. It is their dis-
like for this President and the good 
work he is doing. 
So, Madam Speaker, before I reserve 
here for a moment, this has always 
been a political impeachment. Even 
today, on the floor, the talk of the 
President being forever impeached and 
this always being a stain forgets the 
Senate trial. 
I hope this ends this political im-
peachment and this body never sees it 
again. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SCHIFF), the distin-
guished chairman of the Intelligence 
Committee. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the resolution. 
The task before us is a grave one, but 
one demanded by our oath. 
The 
impeachment 
inquiry 
under-
taken by the House of Representatives 
found that President Donald J. Trump 
abused his power and sought to cover it 
up with an unprecedented campaign of 
obstruction. 
He withheld hundreds of millions of 
U.S. dollars in vital military aid to 
Ukraine, a close ally at war with Rus-
sia, and withheld a coveted White 
House meeting critical to the Ukrain-
ian leader’s international legitimacy 
until Ukraine would commit to help 
President Trump cheat—cheat—in the 
next election. 
President Trump put his own per-
sonal interests above the national in-
terests, above our national security, 
and, if not stopped, he will do it again. 
For that reason, he was impeached. 
And for that reason, the House man-
agers will take the case to the Senate 
and to the American people, because 
the appropriate remedy—indeed, the 
only remedy—is the conviction and re-
moval from office of President Donald 
Trump. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCAR-
THY). 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, 
back when this national nightmare 
began, Speaker PELOSI laid bare her in-
tentions and purely partisan agenda. 
She told her Caucus that they needed 
to ‘‘strike while the iron is hot.’’ 
This was always an exercise in raw 
partisan politics, contrary to the warn-
ings of our Founders. And over the last 
month, we saw the justification for 
running the fastest, thinnest, and 
weakest impeachment in American his-
tory crumble. 
Instead of sending the Articles of Im-
peachment to the Senate for trial, 
Speaker PELOSI held them hostage in a 
failed play to gain leverage that she 
did not—and would never—have. 
In terms of concessions, she got noth-
ing: no control, no moral victories—in 
other words, another failed strategy. 
After a month of counterproductive 
and harmful delays, I have three ques-
tions for my friends on the other side 
of the aisle, the Democrats: 
What 
happened 
to 
impeachment 
being urgent? 
What happened to Congress being ‘‘on 
the clock’’? 
What happened to saying the House 
would be ‘‘derelict in our duty’’ if we 
did not act immediately? 
These were all the assertions Demo-
crats made over the past several 
months. I guess it turns out none of 
them are true. 
These delay tactics were self-serving, 
hypocritical, 
and 
discrediting. 
But 
they made an important admission, 
some might even call it a concession.

H254 
January 15, 2020 
They proved a very big point: Demo-
crats do not even believe their case was 
robust enough to win in a trial. 
Even the Speaker’s allies admit the 
delays undermined their case. Some 
have gone as far as describing it as a 
‘‘failed’’ strategy. These are those who 
are closest to her. 
Senator FEINSTEIN, the senior Demo-
crat from our State of California and 
the hometown of the Speaker, said: 
‘‘The longer it goes on, the less urgent 
it becomes.’’ 
And Chairman ADAM SMITH, a con-
fidant of the Speaker, said ‘‘it was 
time’’ to transmit the articles to the 
Senate. 
Both these statements were made 
last week, before the Speaker relented. 
They are significant because they were 
public and they were honest. 
I am disappointed these individuals 
did not have the courage to stand by 
their initial comments. If impeach-
ment was truly as urgent as Democrats 
claimed, the majority should not have 
waited for the Speaker to choose a po-
litically convenient time. 
Anyone could have recognized this 
ploy would not work. The House and 
the Senate are different institutions 
and, at this point in time, controlled 
by different parties. 
As James Madison wrote in the Fed-
eralist Papers, the purpose of bicamer-
alism is to guard against the dangers of 
encroachment and to stop toxic resolu-
tions from taking effect. 
We saw separation of powers prevail 
against an abuse of power, just as the 
Constitution intends. 
The idea of withholding a sloppy im-
peachment case to force the Senate to 
change its rules is constitutionally and 
politically unheard of. Frankly, it is 
just ridiculous. 
In Article I, section 5, the Constitu-
tion clearly states: ‘‘Each House may 
determine 
the 
Rules 
of 
its 
Pro-
ceedings.’’ It doesn’t say the House 
may determine the rules of proceedings 
in the Senate. 
If anything, the Speaker’s actions 
have only further persuaded Members 
of the Senate that the evidence of im-
peachment was neither thorough nor 
satisfactory. 
But do you know what? Let’s be hon-
est. This was never about persuasion. It 
was never about the rule of law. It was 
what Alexander Hamilton warned us, 
that one party would get control and, 
just because of their animosity, de-
mean the process of impeachment. 
And by selecting this particular 
batch of managers, the Speaker has 
further proven she is not interested in 
winning minds and hearts or even fol-
lowing the Constitution. 
Let’s take a look at the first three 
names Speaker PELOSI announced in 
her anticipated announcement earlier 
today: 
Chairman SCHIFF, a man who has al-
ready taken on the role of judge, jury, 
and fact witness throughout the entire 
House impeachment process. 
Chairman 
NADLER, 
someone 
who 
campaigned for the chairmanship of 
the Judiciary Committee that is re-
sponsible for impeachment, beginning 
as far back as December 2017, before 
they were even in the majority, on the 
notion that he would be the best person 
to lead the charge on potential im-
peachment against the President. 
You see, you get a chairmanship by 
your conference voting for you. You 
campaign for it. You put your best 
ideas out there as to why you should be 
the chairman. In 2017, that was the 
campaign. 
Congressman HAKEEM
JEFFRIES, a 
Member who, almost 2 years ago to 
this date, voted in support of impeach-
ment. That was more than a year be-
fore the Ukraine call even took place. 
Those are just some of the managers. 
If you think about the Members, 
there are people who, on the day they 
were sworn in to this body, told those 
who supported them that they were 
going to impeach him. 
As I have said in the past, there is an 
issue with fairness; but instead of look-
ing to the Senate, Speaker PELOSI 
should be looking within her own Cau-
cus. From the beginning, this inves-
tigation was marred by selective leaks 
to the media, a completely predeter-
mined process. 
Yes, we have been through impeach-
ment before, but it was much different. 
We believed in the rule of law back 
then: that you could face your accuser, 
that you could cross-examine, that the 
minority could actually ask for wit-
nesses. 
The day that impeachment was asked 
to come forward, I sent a letter to the 
Speaker asking 10 items, none that 
were made up. Do you know what they 
were? The fair process we have always 
used in the past. The answer was no. 
Because they have been working on 
this for 21⁄2 years, they could not let 
fairness determine the outcome. 
Any other prosecutor would be dis-
barred for such blatant bias, especially 
if that prosecutor was a fact witness in 
the case. 
The reason for this impeachment is 
the same reason it has taken Demo-
crats 30 days to send the articles to the 
Senate: just spite. They wanted to 
stain the President’s record without 
giving him a fair chance to clear his 
name. 
Last year, we saw House Democrats 
invert the burden of proof during their 
fair investigation. 
For every American watching, take, 
for instance, if this was your govern-
ment, if they switched the burden of 
proof on you. 
b 1245 
We have Congressman MAX ROSE, a 
new freshman of the majority, who 
characterized it this way: ‘‘The Presi-
dent says he is innocent, so all we are 
saying is ‘prove it’.’’ 
God forbid the government accuses 
you of something as an average Amer-
ican and says you have to prove it. We 
just switched a fundamental belief of 
America, but only in this House do we 
do that. 
This ‘‘guilty until proven innocent’’ 
mentality was an admission that im-
peachment was not about upholding 
justice or protecting the rule of law. 
Now Democrats have invented an even 
more destructive standard: you are 
guilty because they say so. 
Our Founders feared this day. Alex-
ander Hamilton warned us of this day. 
I hoped this day would not come. I 
would hope those that uphold the Con-
stitution would believe in the rule of 
law, instead of the spite or the dislike 
of an individual. Like the kangaroo 
courts on college campuses where an 
accusation is enough for a conviction. 
Even as early as last Sunday in an 
interview, Speaker PELOSI made that 
point very clear to all of us. Asked 
what a Senate acquittal would mean, 
she said it didn’t matter, the President 
is impeached forever. 
Is that what this is all about? Just a 
personality, just an abuse of power 
that you have within the House that 
we all feared this country would never 
do. You could almost see the Speaker 
smile as she spoke about this new 
standard. How incredibly solemn she 
was. 
Madam Speaker, when Americans 
look back on this sad saga, they will 
see a rigged process that forever dam-
aged the remedy of impeachment. 
Speaker PELOSI got nothing from the 
Senate, but the American people got 
worse than nothing. They got stuck 
with the bill for a costly never-ending 
investigation. 
The old saying that you get what you 
pay for does not apply here. Congress 
wasted time and millions of dollars on 
partisan impeachment. In return, tax-
payers get nothing. Democrats’ mis-
aligned priorities have cost the people 
solutions that could have improved the 
quality of their life. 
There is no greater contrast than 
what we are doing right here today 
than what is happening down Pennsyl-
vania Avenue, the President sitting 
down with a leader of another country 
and signing a trade agreement—some-
thing people said we could never get 
done—to make this country stronger, 
to make the next century in America 
ours. 
But what are we doing here? We are 
doing what this majority has worked 
their entire time for. Before they were 
even sworn in they campaigned for the 
position of chairman for this moment, 
for this time, for the millions of dollars 
that are spent so they could say the 
President is impeached. That is a lofty 
history. Those are lofty goals that you 
now have authored more subpoenas 
than you have created laws. 
Thank God we have got a President 
in the White House that does not sit 
back. 
Yes, the President got the United 
States-Mexico-Canada 
Trade 
Agree-
ment done with, our top two traders. 
He is signing a trade agreement with 
China today, but think about how 
much stronger his hand would have 
been had that agreement taken place

earlier, when he got it. No, it was held. 
Why? Because we were impeaching. 
That is an amazing agenda, but you 
promised people you would do it. 
This is not a moment this body 
should be proud of. If Speaker PELOSI 
likes to say impeachment is a national 
civics lesson, let’s use this blunder as a 
teachable moment. 
I will make this promise to the 
American public, because the day will 
come that the majority will switch. We 
will uphold the Constitution. We will 
listen to the words of Alexander Ham-
ilton. And just because somebody else 
is in an office that we may not like, we 
will not change the rule of law. We will 
not accuse them of breaking it and say 
they have to prove it. 
We believe America is more than a 
country. America is an idea, an idea 
that, yes, would make students in Iran 
rise up for the freedom of what they 
know America to be. That the rule of 
law was so powerful. This is a moment 
and a civics lesson we should learn. 
This is a moment that will teach our 
grandchildren that, yes, more than 200 
years ago the Founders crafted an 
amazing country, but they warned us 
what abuse of power would look like. 
The sad part is we are witnessing it. 
What a contrast in a day and time. 
Moving forward, we must not redo 
these same mistakes in Congress, and 
my promise to you is: if power were to 
change, the rule of law would come 
back. We would have an agenda focused 
on people, not politics. We would have 
a voice that you are innocent until 
proven guilty. We would not abuse our 
power just for the sheer sake of poli-
tics, to say you are impeached forever 
because I dislike you. 
We are better than this. It is a sad 
day, but the great thing about Amer-
ica, it will all change because the peo-
ple have the voice. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are once again reminded to ad-
dress their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 1 minute. 
Madam Speaker, two points. 
First, my colleagues in the minority 
would rather talk about anything than 
try to defend what President Trump 
actually did, because they can’t. 
There is overwhelming evidence that 
the President pressured the Ukrainian 
Government to interfere in our elec-
tion on his behalf then he covered it 
up. These are high crimes and mis-
demeanors, and we will prove that in 
the Senate. 
Second, 
our 
minority 
colleagues 
don’t like our ongoing fight for a fair 
trial because it got results. New docu-
ments and additional witnesses have 
emerged that unmistakably point to 
the President’s guilt, and we have ex-
posed the efforts of some in the Senate 
majority to put on a sham trial. 
The 
American 
people 
understand 
that a trial without evidence, without 
witnesses is no trial at all but a cover-
up, and that will not stand. We must 
protect the Constitution and the integ-
rity of our elections. That is what this 
is about. We must remove this Presi-
dent to protect our country. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 30 seconds re-
maining. The gentleman from New 
York has 1 minute remaining, and the 
gentleman from New York has the 
right to close. 
The gentleman from Georgia is rec-
ognized. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate that. Madam 
Speaker, is the gentleman from New 
York ready to close? 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I am 
ready to close. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, there are no other speakers? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia is recognized. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, there are no speakers? A clos-
ing is no other speakers. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
have one more speaker, and she will 
close. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, then the gentleman is not 
ready to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is incorrect. The gentleman 
from New York has one remaining 
speaker who will close. 
The gentleman from Georgia is rec-
ognized for 30 seconds. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I will take it back. Madam 
Speaker, give me the time one more 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 30 seconds re-
maining. The gentleman from New 
York has 1 minute remaining. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, two facts just came out right 
here, and again, we are going to hear in 
just a moment, but they are facts. Un-
doubtedly the mics are not working on 
the other side, on the majority side. We 
have talked about the facts. There is 
not overwhelming evidence. We have 
discussed this over and over until we 
are blue in the face, but it doesn’t mat-
ter because this is a political impeach-
ment. 
This has nothing to do with the facts. 
We have shown that there was nothing 
done wrong, but that does not matter. 
When the train is on the tracks, the 
whistle is blowing, impeachment mat-
ters, and the only thing that matters 
on the timeline, the only real emer-
gency here is that there is a 2020 elec-
tion in which the Democrats can’t 
stand to see the fact this President is 
going to win again. They can’t stand 
the fact of who they have got running, 
so what do we do? We impeach him, as 
they said, for life. That is wrong. Vote 
‘‘no.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
NADLER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
again, no defense. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of 
the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his exceptional custodianship of the 
Constitution of the United States, for 
13 years the top Democrat on the Con-
stitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Jus-
tice Subcommittee of the Judiciary 
Committee. I thank you for your lead-
ership in protecting and defending the 
Constitution, the oath that we take as 
Members of Congress. 
As I enter into the conversation, I 
thank the distinguished 
gentleman 
from Georgia for his apology for his ri-
diculous remarks about me and House 
Democrats. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Mr. COLLINS and accept his apology. 
Now, I want to go to the purpose of 
why we are on the floor today. My col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle, we 
are here today to cross a very impor-
tant threshold in American history. On 
December 18, the House of Representa-
tives passed Articles of Impeachment 
of Donald Trump, Articles of Impeach-
ment for Abuse of Power and Obstruc-
tion of Congress. 
By his own admission, the President 
stated that, yes, he had had that con-
versation 
with 
the 
President 
of 
Ukraine, but he didn’t see anything 
wrong with it. Well, we don’t agree 
with that assessment. 
And, yes, it is a fact when someone is 
impeached, they are always impeached. 
It cannot be erased, so I stand by that 
comment, although I know you don’t 
like hearing it. I stand by this picture 
of the American flag, as I did the day 
that we introduced the Articles of Im-
peachment onto the floor because 
every day all over America in class-
rooms as well as courtrooms and in 
this Congress of the United States 
when we meet, we pledge allegiance to 
the flag of the United States of Amer-
ica and to the republic for which it 
stands—and to the republic for which it 
stands, that is what our Nation is. 
That is the genius, the beautiful, ex-
quisite genius of the Constitution, that 
we are a republic. That was a decision 
of our Founders, their vision. They 
didn’t want a monarchy, they wanted a 
republic. 
When Benjamin Franklin came out of 
Independence Hall and was asked what 
do we have, Mr. Franklin, a monarchy 
or a republic, he said: ‘‘A republic, if 
we can keep it.’’ I have often wondered 
why he said that, why that would be in 
doubt. But we see why it is in doubt 
right now when the President of the 
United States has said Article II says I 
can do whatever I want. That is a mon-
archy, that is not a republic that we 
pledge our allegiance to every single 
day. 
Here we are today with the Articles 
of Impeachment about to be trans-
mitted to the United States Senate. 
I was thinking this morning and I 
mentioned it in a previous public

event, the midnight ride of Paul Re-
vere: ‘‘Listen, my children, and you 
shall hear of the midnight ride of Paul 
Revere.’’ Listen, my children, and you 
will hear about an assault on the Con-
stitution of the United States, under-
mining the Republic for which our flag 
stands by the President of the United 
States in using appropriated funds en-
acted in a bipartisan way by this Con-
gress, funds that were meant to help 
Ukraine fight the Russians. The Presi-
dent considered that his private ATM 
machine, I guess, and thought he could 
say to the President, ‘‘Do me a favor.’’ 
Do me a favor? Do you paint houses, 
too? What is this? Do me a favor. 
So we have a situation that is very 
sad. Don’t talk to me about my timing. 
For a long time I resisted the calls 
from across the country for impeach-
ment of the President for obvious vio-
lations of the Constitution that he 
committed. But recognizing the divi-
siveness of impeachment, I held back. 
Frankly, I said this President isn’t 
worth it. But when he acted the way he 
did in relationship to withholding 
funds from Ukraine in return for a ben-
efit to him that was personal and polit-
ical, he crossed a threshold. He gave us 
no choice. 
So, children, our Constitution is the 
vision of our Founders. They were so 
brave 
they 
declared 
independence. 
They did it in a timeframe when in the 
course of human events it becomes nec-
essary. They declared independence. 
They fought a war of independence and 
bravely succeeded. They wrote docu-
ments, our founding documents, the 
Constitution. Thank God they made it 
amendable so we could ever be expand-
ing freedom in our country. 
And that, my children, is what you 
pledge allegiance to, the flag of the 
United States of America and to the 
Republic contained in that Constitu-
tion of the United States. 
b 1300 
We take that oath. When we become 
Members of Congress or other public 
office, we take an oath to protect and 
defend the Constitution of the United 
States. 
The President of the United States 
takes an oath to preserve, protect, and 
defend the Constitution of the United 
States, an oath that he has blatantly 
violated. For this reason, he was im-
peached by the House of Representa-
tives. 
For this reason, we thought it would 
be helpful to have not only the strong 
case for impeachment and removal 
that was put forth in this House, but to 
know that more was to come. We didn’t 
make it come because we said that we 
were going to wait until after Christ-
mas to send this over. They would like 
to have had us send it over on Christ-
mas Eve so they could dismiss it. 
Perhaps they don’t realize that dis-
missal is coverup, but that has been 
one of their trains of thought. 
Dismissal is coverup. 
I was so disappointed the other day, 
last Friday, I guess, or last Thursday, 
when the leader of the United States 
Senate, rather than strengthening the 
institution in which he serves, became 
subservient and signed on to a resolu-
tion that would dismiss charges. 
Dismissal is coverup. 
In the course of the time since we 
passed the resolution, and not because 
of the time—we passed it on December 
18—on December 20, new emails showed 
that 91 minutes after Trump’s phone 
call with the Ukrainian President, a 
top Office of Management and Budget 
aide asked the Department of Defense 
to ‘‘hold off’’ on sending military aid to 
Ukraine. 
On December 29, revelations emerged 
about OMB Director and Acting Chief 
of Staff Mulvaney’s role in the delay of 
aid; the effort by lawyers in the admin-
istration to justify the delay; and, 
most importantly, the alarm that the 
delay caused within the administra-
tion. 
On January 2, newly unredacted Pen-
tagon emails, which the House subpoe-
naed and the President blocked, raised 
serious concerns by Trump administra-
tion officials about the legality of the 
President’s hold on the aid to Ukraine. 
On January 6, former Trump Na-
tional Security Advisor John Bolton 
said he would comply with a subpoena 
compelling his testimony. His lawyer 
stated he has new relevant informa-
tion. 
On January 13, reports emerged that 
the Russian Government hacked the 
Ukrainian gas company Burisma as 
part of their ongoing effort to influence 
the U.S. election in support of Trump. 
Yesterday, House committees—Mr. 
NADLER, Mr. SCHIFF, Mr. ENGEL, and 
Madam Chair MALONEY—released new 
evidence, pursuant to a House sub-
poena, from Lev Parnas—recently pho-
tographed with the Republican leader— 
an associate of Rudy Giuliani, that fur-
ther proves that the President was a 
central player in the scheme to pres-
sure Ukraine for his own benefit in the 
2020 election. 
The Senate leader and the President 
are afraid of more facts coming to 
light. That is why the leader signed 
that dismissal resolution. 
A dismissal, again, is a coverup. 
The American people will fully un-
derstand the Senate’s move to begin 
the trial without witnesses and docu-
ments as a pure political coverup. 
Whatever the outcome, the American 
people want a fair trial, fair to the 
President, fair to the American people. 
The American people deserve the truth. 
The Constitution requires a trial, a 
fair trial. 
The House is now moving forward 
with a vote to transmit the articles 
and appoint managers. 
As Speaker, I am proud to appoint 
outstanding American patriots to serve 
on the impeachment panel: 
Chairman SCHIFF; 
Chairman NADLER; 
Chairwoman ZOE
LOFGREN—this is 
her third impeachment, as a staffer to 
a House Judiciary Committee member 
in the Nixon impeachment, as a mem-
ber of the Judiciary Committee on the 
Clinton impeachment, and now as a 
House manager; 
HAKEEM JEFFRIES, the chair of our 
Caucus, a serious, respected litigator; 
VAL DEMINGS, a member of the police 
force in Orlando for 27 years and, for 
part of that time, the first woman and 
African American police chief of Or-
lando, so she knows her way around the 
courtroom; 
JASON CROW from Colorado, an Army 
Ranger who served our country in the 
military in Iraq and Afghanistan and 
now in the Congress of the United 
States, and he too is a respected liti-
gator; and, 
SYLVIA GARCIA from Texas, a judge in 
a number of capacities in Texas and a 
member of the Judiciary Committee. 
We are very honored that you have 
taken the responsibility, all of you, to 
bring the Articles of Impeachment over 
to the United States Senate with a 
case for the Constitution. 
So, back to the children. We don’t 
want this President or any President 
to ever violate the Constitution. It is 
very, very important that we see that 
that Constitution is central to who we 
are as a country, our system of govern-
ment, our Constitution, so valued, so 
respected, hopefully, so honored by ev-
eryone who takes an oath of office to 
support and defend it. 
We see the Russians now hacking in 
Ukraine. It just came out yesterday or 
the day before. It just reminds me that 
I think most Americans would think 
that voters in America should decide 
who our President is, not Vladimir 
Putin and Russia deciding who our 
President is. 
I am very concerned that in all of 
this, whether it is withholding funds 
for the Ukrainian Government to fight 
the Russians, whether it is under-
mining our commitment to NATO, 
whether it is, again, making decisions 
of what happens in Syria vis-a-vis Tur-
key favoring the Russians, that all 
roads lead to Russia, all roads lead to 
Putin. 
While some in the administration 
may think that is okay, I don’t, but we 
do insist and wonder why this Presi-
dent and some in this Congress will not 
come to the defense of our electoral 
system by allowing that to happen, de-
nying that it is happening, placing the 
blame elsewhere. 
This is as serious as it gets for any of 
us. Only the vote to declare war would 
be something more serious than this. 
We take it very seriously. 
It is not personal. It is not political. 
It is not partisan. It is patriotic. 
Again, I thank our distinguished 
managers for their courage and their 
dedication, for being willing to spend 
the time to do the job to honor the 
oath that we take and honor the pledge 
that our children take of allegiance to 
the flag and to the Republic for which 
it stands. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H257 
January 15, 2020 
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this par-
tisan impeachment spectacle that seeks to ac-
complish what President Trump’s opponents 
failed to do at the ballot box in 2016. The bed-
rock of this country is our Constitution. Article 
II of the United States Constitution grants our 
President the necessary authority to deal with 
other nations and their leaders. 
This President was lawfully elected by the 
American people. When President Trump was 
sworn into office, he assumed the role of our 
nation’s Commander in Chief. And, as Com-
mander in Chief, he has done absolutely noth-
ing illegal. The impeachment vote today is a 
sad continuation of the partisan political efforts 
to undercut President Trump since he was 
elected in 2016, if not before. 
The House majority has wrongly denied 
President Trump the fair process that was af-
forded to President Clinton and President 
Nixon at every stage of their investigations. I 
am also profoundly disappointed that the 
House Judiciary Committee refused to hold a 
minority day hearing in compliance with 
Clause 2(j)(1) of Rule XI of the Rules of the 
House, which the Democratic Majority earlier 
voted to approve. 
It should also greatly concern all Americans 
that co-equal subpoena authority was not 
granted to the minority during this hyper-par-
tisan process. Co-equal subpoena authority for 
both the minority and majority has been the 
backbone of past impeachment investigations. 
My bill, House Resolution 667, would have 
granted this co-equal subpoena authority to 
the minority and majority, and l am dis-
appointed that the Speaker never let it be con-
sidered by the House. 
House Democrats said that it was critical to 
move forward in an historically fast, hasty 
manner. Yet, after passing both Articles of Im-
peachment on December 18, 2019, their 
sense of urgency died. The House Democratic 
Majority has waited nearly a month to transmit 
the ‘‘urgent’’ Articles of Impeachment to the 
Senate. This change in tone only underscores 
what Tennesseans knew all along: this is a 
partisan stunt, motivated purely by political 
reasons, that mocks our Founding Fathers’ 
great caution in undertaking decisions of this 
magnitude and the safeguards they designed 
for our Republic. 
It is shameful that the majority has waited 
nearly a month to bring House Resolution 798 
up for a vote. I am deeply alarmed that this 
delay by House Democrats was a thinly veiled 
power grab. Our Founding Fathers envisioned 
this scenario during the dawn of our Republic: 
one chamber of Congress trying to control the 
other. In our Founders’ wisdom, a system of 
checks and balances was put into place to 
prevent the coup d’e´tat that House Democrats 
attempted. Because of these safeguards, 
House Democrats ultimately failed. I applaud 
the Senators from both sides of the aisle who 
stood against this grave injustice and de-
manded that the House send over the Articles 
of Impeachment to the Senate without delay. 
Instead of working to secure our southern 
border, protect religious freedom, and rein in 
out-of-control government spending, my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle have 
been laser-focused on removing President 
Trump from office for purely political reasons. 
I want to remind those who are leading this 
ridiculous waste of taxpayer resources that 
there will be another election in 2020. The 
next election is the avenue for deciding a new 
president, not this. Throughout the history of 
this country, impeachment has been a rare 
process. With this impeachment, I worry that 
in the next 230 years of our Republic, it will be 
rare that a president is not impeached. 
On behalf of my fellow Tennesseans, and 
on behalf of my constituents in the Sixth Dis-
trict of Tennessee, I stand with our President 
and Commander in Chief and will vote ‘‘no’’ to 
appoint and authorize managers for the im-
peachment trial of President Trump.

PROTECTING OLDER WORKERS 
AGAINST DISCRIMINATION ACT 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and insert extraneous material 
on H.R. 1230, the Protecting Older 
Workers Against Discrimination Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 790 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in 
the Committee of the Whole House on 
the state of the Union for the consider-
ation of the bill, H.R. 1230. 
The Chair appoints the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR) to preside 
over the Committee of the Whole. 
b 1339 
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 
Accordingly, 
the 
House 
resolved 
itself into the Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union for the 
consideration of the bill (H.R. 1230) to 
amend the Age Discrimination in Em-
ployment Act of 1967 and other laws to 
clarify appropriate standards for Fed-
eral employment discrimination and 
retaliation claims, and for other pur-
poses, with Mr. CUELLAR in the chair. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the 
bill is considered read for the first 
time. 
General debate shall be confined to 
the bill and shall not exceed 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the 
Committee 
on 
Education 
and 
Labor. 
The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT), and the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of 
H.R. 1230, the Protecting Older Work-
ers Against Discrimination Act, or 
POWADA. 
I want to thank my colleagues, par-
ticularly the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. SENSENBRENNER), for work-
ing to pass this bipartisan proposal to 
restore workplace protections for older 
workers. 
In 1967, Congress passed the Age Dis-
crimination in Employment Act, or 
ADEA, which recognizes the Federal 
Government’s role in preventing older 
workers from being forced out of jobs 
or denied work opportunities because 
of their age. 
Importantly, the ADEA was enforced 
using an evidentiary standard that 
gave older workers a fair shot at hold-
ing employers accountable for age dis-
crimination. 
Under 
this 
standard, 
workers seeking to challenge age dis-
crimination in employment only had to 
prove that age was a motivating factor 
or one of many motivating factors be-
hind an employer’s discriminatory ac-
tion. 
For 
decades, 
this 
mixed-motive 
standard was consistent with the evi-
dentiary standard in title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, which covers 
claims of unlawful discrimination on 
the basis of race, sex, national origin, 
or religion. 
Unfortunately, in 2009, in the Gross v. 
FBL Financial Services case, the Su-
preme Court upended decades of prece-
dent, significantly raising the burden 
of proof for older workers. 
In its 5-to-4 decision, the Court held 
that plaintiffs must prove that age was 
the decisive and determinative moti-
vating factor for the employer’s con-
duct. Under this altered framework, 
older workers cannot prevail unless 
they can show that the adverse action 
would not have occurred but for the 
employee’s age. 
This higher threshold not only makes 
it harder for workers who have suffered

January 15, 2020 
discrimination to achieve redress, it 
also sends a message to employers that 
they need not treat age discrimination 
as seriously as other forms of discrimi-
nation. 
By amending the ADEA to clarify 
that the mixed-motive standard is the 
evidentiary standard for evaluating 
claims, the Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act would re-
store workers’ protections and reestab-
lish a consistent burden of proof for 
claims alleging discrimination on the 
basis of age. 
The 2009 Gross decision also opened 
the door for the courts to apply the 
but-for standard to other civil rights 
laws, including the Americans with 
Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation 
Act of 1973, and the antiretaliation pro-
visions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
The bill before us clarifies that the 
mixed-motive standard also applies to 
those three civil rights acts as well. 
Despite the bipartisan support in 
both Chambers for this bill, I am dis-
appointed that the White House has al-
ready threatened to veto this legisla-
tion. In reality, the administration has 
a troubling pattern of blocking legisla-
tion to help the very forgotten workers 
it promised to support. 
In addition to this legislation, the 
administration has placed veto threats 
on the Raise the Wage Act, which 
would gradually increase the minimum 
wage to $15 an hour by 2025, and the 
Workplace 
Violence 
Prevention 
for 
Healthcare and Social Service Workers 
Act, which would support the safety of 
healthcare and social service workers. 
b 1345 
Mr. Chairman, today the House has a 
chance to be on record and stand up for 
the average American worker. I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on the Protecting Older 
Workers Against Discrimination Act, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 1230, the Protecting Older 
Workers Against Discrimination Act. 
Let me be clear: every worker, in-
cluding older workers, should be pro-
tected from workplace discrimination 
at his or her job. This is why Congress 
has passed a number of laws to protect 
Americans of all ages against discrimi-
nation in the workplace. The Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, CRA; the Age Dis-
crimination in Employment Act of 
1967, ADEA; the Rehabilitation Act of 
1973, the Rehab Act; and the Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990, ADA, 
makes employment discrimination be-
cause of an individual’s race, color, re-
ligion, sex, national origin, age, or dis-
ability unlawful. 
Although I appreciate the stated pur-
pose behind H.R. 1230, the rushed ap-
proach taken by committee Democrats 
and the lack of evidence and data to 
prove that this legislation is needed 
have led to a seriously flawed bill. 
Careful examination and scrutiny of 
any legislative proposal is necessary to 
determine whether it is needed and 
whether it appropriately and effec-
tively addresses the relevant issues. 
Unfortunately, in developing H.R. 1230, 
the committee majority failed miser-
ably in this regard. 
Committee Democrats chose not to 
hold a single hearing solely dedicated 
to examining either age discrimination 
or H.R. 1230; rather, they examined this 
bill during a hearing that covered mul-
tiple topics and several other pieces of 
legislation completely unrelated to the 
bill. 
As we have seen many times during 
the 116th Congress with other legisla-
tion, H.R. 1230 was rushed through the 
Education and Labor Committee with-
out necessary examination, discussion, 
or consideration. As a result, we are 
here debating yet another one-size-fits- 
all ‘‘government knows best’’ mandate 
that rewards special interests and dis-
regards real-world workplace experi-
ence and decades of Supreme Court 
precedent. 
However, the flawed process is far 
from the only issue with this legisla-
tion. The committee also has no evi-
dence or data indicating this bill is 
necessary. In fact, the lone Democrat- 
invited witness who testified on H.R. 
1230 at a committee hearing covering 
many bills and topics admitted the im-
pact of the Supreme Court’s 2009 deci-
sion in Gross v. FBL Financial Serv-
ices, Inc. is unknown. She also admit-
ted there is no data indicating workers 
have been discouraged from filing age 
discrimination charges with the EEOC 
or bringing cases. 
The data simply does not indicate 
workers have been discouraged from 
filing 
discrimination 
or 
retaliation 
charges with the EEOC. Additionally, 
according to the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, employment numbers for older 
workers have trended upwards in re-
cent decades. 
In 2018 older workers earned 7 per-
cent more than the median for all 
workers, a large increase from 20 years 
ago. For workers age 65 and older, em-
ployment tripled from 1988 to 2018, 
while 
employment 
among 
younger 
workers grew by about one-third. Like-
wise, over the past 20 years, the num-
ber of older workers on full-time work 
schedules grew 21⁄2 times faster than 
the number working part-time. 
Rather than considering misguided 
proposals such as H.R. 1230 which fur-
thers 
government 
intervention, 
we 
ought to be empowering all workers, 
including older workers, to continue 
participating and thriving in America’s 
workforce to build upon, not stifle, 
these 
impressive 
trends. 
Unfortu-
nately, H.R. 1230 does the opposite. 
This legislation will actually harm 
older workers while simultaneously en-
riching trial lawyers. 
H.R. 1230 overturns Supreme Court 
precedent by allowing a plaintiff to 
argue that age was only a motivating, 
not decisive, factor that led to an em-
ployer’s unfavorable employment ac-
tion, and it allows these kinds of 
mixed-motive claims across four com-
pletely 
different 
nondiscrimination 
laws. Moreover, allowing mixed-motive 
claims in cases alleging retaliation 
puts employers in an untenable posi-
tion of trying to prove that a legiti-
mate employment decision was not in 
response to a prior complaint. The only 
party who will be paid in nearly all 
mixed-motive cases is the plaintiffs’ 
attorneys because most employers will 
be able to demonstrate that they would 
have taken the same action in the ab-
sence of the impermissible motivating 
factor. So the very people this legisla-
tion is intended to help will not receive 
any monetary damages under H.R. 1230. 
H.R. 1230 will also increase frivolous 
legal claims against businessowners. 
Such undeserving claims will take val-
uable resources away from efforts to 
prevent workplace harassment and dis-
crimination. 
Finally, committee Republicans of-
fered amendments to advance impor-
tant priorities and practical solutions 
for older workers and highlight funda-
mental flaws in H.R. 1230. Unfortu-
nately, our commonsense amendments 
were defeated on a party-line vote in 
committee. 
Mr. Chairman, all workers should be 
protected from workplace discrimina-
tion, but by rushing today’s legislation 
to the House floor in an attempt to 
make up for an abysmal first year in 
the majority, Democrats have failed 
older workers. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no’’ on H.R. 1230, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume just to respond to the idea 
that this has been rushed. 
There have been several committee 
hearings over the last 10 years in the 
House and one of the Senate, and that 
information is recorded in the com-
mittee report. 
I also would like to point out that 
the burden of but for that the Gross de-
cision has saddled older workers with 
now requires them to show not only 
that they have been discriminated 
against but also that they would have 
gotten the job or wouldn’t have been 
fired but for the fact that they are old. 
All the older person knows is that 
when they applied for the job they were 
told: We don’t hire old people. 
Well, that is not enough, because now 
you also have to show that you would 
have gotten the job anyway. You don’t 
know who got hired, and you don’t 
know what their qualifications were, 
and it is an almost impossible burden 
to prove that not only were you dis-
criminated against but you know the 
action would not have been taken but 
for that action. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. 
BONAMICI), who is the chair of the Sub-
committee on Civil Rights and Human 
Services on the Education and Labor 
Committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

January 15, 2020 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I 
thank Chairman SCOTT for yielding. 
Mr. Chairman, today, by supporting 
the bipartisan Protecting Older Work-
ers Against Discrimination Act, we can 
protect the civil rights of older work-
ers who are striving to provide for 
themselves and their families. 
According to recent data from the 
Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, the percentage of retire-
ment-age Americans in the labor force 
has doubled since 1985. Unfortunately, 
age discrimination in the workplace re-
mains disturbingly pervasive. Accord-
ing to the AARP, three in five workers 
over the age of 45 reported seeing or ex-
periencing age discrimination on the 
job. Americans are living and working 
longer, and we must do all we can to 
protect them from discrimination. 
My home State of Oregon has one of 
the most rapidly aging populations in 
this country. I have heard from work-
ers, many in the technology industry, 
who believe they have been dismissed 
or denied employment because of their 
age. My office has helped older workers 
who have filed age discrimination com-
plaints at the Equal Employment Op-
portunity Commission, but the burden 
and the outcomes are very uncertain. 
In 1967 Congress passed the Age Dis-
crimination in Employment Act, or 
ADEA, to prohibit age discrimination 
in the workplace and to promote the 
employment of older workers. Then in 
2009 the Supreme Court in the Gross 
case changed the burden of proof for 
workers and made it much harder for 
workers to prove age discrimination. 
This bipartisan bill simply returns the 
burden of proof to what it was for dec-
ades before the Gross case. 
I joined Chairman SCOTT and Con-
gressman SENSENBRENNER in reintro-
ducing the bipartisan Protecting Older 
Workers Against Discrimination Act to 
amend the ADEA and our other core 
civil rights laws: the anti-retaliation 
provision of Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act, the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act, and the Rehabilitation 
Act of 1973. We need to make our laws 
clear. Unlawful discrimination in the 
workplace is unacceptable. 
Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman 
SCOTT
and 
Congressman 
SENSEN-
BRENNER for their work on this impor-
tant issue, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 1230. 
Let’s be clear. All of us are against 
workplace discrimination of any kind, 
and, Mr. Chairman, at my age I am cer-
tainly against age discrimination. 
All of us want to protect all Amer-
ican workers from discrimination, but 
contrary to the bill’s title, this legisla-
tion will end up harming workers. It is 
a payout to trial lawyers by muddying 
legal standards under the guise of a 
nice-sounding bill. Any plaintiff who 
files a discrimination lawsuit under 
this bill is extremely unlikely to re-
ceive any monetary awards, but the 
trial lawyers will still get paid for 
their time. 
Right now we have an economy that 
is booming. More than 7 million jobs 
are unfilled across this country—that 
is 7 million jobs going wanting right 
now. The pro-growth policies we put in 
place are working. Our focus should be 
on protecting workers and encouraging 
greater workforce participation and 
not rewarding lawyers through in-
creased opportunities to garner legal 
fees. 
Sadly, this legislation was rushed 
through the Education and Labor Com-
mittee for partisan purposes. It did not 
receive a thoughtful consideration of 
bipartisan ideas. We can do better but, 
once again, we are using precious time 
to debate political messaging bills in-
stead of solving problems. 
Mr. Chairman, protecting our older 
workers and encouraging appropriate 
job training are outcomes we can all 
agree on. But the crux of this bill is de-
signed to help attorneys, not workers. 
I urge my colleagues to look beyond 
the title and vote ‘‘no’’ on this payout 
to trial lawyers. We can do better, and 
we can protect all workers, including 
those of age, from age discrimination.

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LAN-
GEVIN), who is the co-chair of the Bi-
partisan Disabilities Caucus. 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for his 
exceptional leadership in bringing this 
bill to the floor. 
Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Pro-
tecting Older Workers Against Dis-
crimination Act. 
Age is just a number. We hear that 
all the time, and there is so much 
truth to it. Yet, each year, too many 
Americans over the age of 40 face dis-
crimination at the office. In fact, 
AARP reports that over half of older 
workers have seen or experienced age 
discrimination. 
Congress outlawed workplace dis-
crimination against older Americans 
over 50 years ago in the Age Discrimi-
nation in Employment Act. However, 
due to a misguided 2009 Supreme Court 
ruling, older Americans still face nega-
tive employment actions. 
As the U.S. Equal Employment Op-
portunity Commission acknowledged 
in 2018, ‘‘Age discrimination remains a 
significant and costly problem for 
workers, their families, and our econ-
omy.’’ This is simply unacceptable, and 
it is wrong. 
Employees over the age of 40 bring 
talent, experience, and wisdom to an 
office. Additionally, these workers are 
more likely to stay at their companies. 
On average, Americans between the 
ages of 55 and 64 stick with their em-
ployers three times as long as employ-
ees aged 25 to 34. Even more disheart-
ening is the effect age discrimination 
has on disabled workers. 
Mr. Chairman, I include in the 
RECORD a letter from the Consortium 
for Citizens with Disabilities in support 
of the bill.

Hon. BOBBY SCOTT, 
Chair, Education and Labor Committee, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. VIRGINIA FOXX, 
Ranking Member, Education and Labor Com-
mittee, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN SCOTT AND RANKING MEM-
BER FOXX: As co-chairs of the Consortium for 
Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) Rights Task 
Force, we write to express our strong support 
for the Protecting Older Workers Against 
Discrimination Act (POWADA) (H.R. 1230) 
and the Transformation to Competitive Em-
ployment Act (H.R. 873). CCD is the largest 
coalition of national organizations working 
together to advocate for federal public policy 
that ensures the self-determination, inde-
pendence, integration, and inclusion of chil-
dren and adults with disabilities in all as-
pects of society. 
POWADA would correct a Supreme Court 
decision, Gross v. FBL Financial Services, 
Inc., that narrowly interpreted the Age Dis-
crimination in Employment Act to require 
that unlawful discrimination be the ‘‘but- 
for’’ cause of an employer’s conduct in order 
to be actionable. Some courts have also ap-
plied this but-for cause requirement to 
claims of disability-based employment dis-
crimination under the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act (ADA), making it harder for 
people with disabilities to prevail on work-
place discrimination claims. 
POWADA is an important opportunity to 
restore workplace rights for people with dis-
abilities. People with disabilities have the 
lowest employment rates of any group 
tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
and their labor force participation rate has 
consistently been less than half of that of 
people without disabilities. Attitudinal bar-
riers among employers are among the top 
reasons for these low rates. It is critically 
important to address barriers to employment 
for people with disabilities, and POWADA 
would help do that.

We also support the Transformation to 
Competitive Employment Act, which was 
discussed along with POWADA in your May 
21, 2019 hearing on Eliminating Barriers to 
Employment. This bill would provide incen-
tives to assist providers of subminimum 
wage employment for people with disabil-
ities to transform the services that they pro-
vide to focus instead on competitive inte-
grated employment, and would make grants 
available to state agencies to collaborate in 
developing the services needed to support the 
individuals served by these providers to se-
cure and maintain competitive integrated 
employment. 
The Transformation to Competitive Em-
ployment Act represents an important step 
toward ending the practice of paying sub-
minimum wages to employees with disabil-
ities under Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor 
Standards Act and expanding the supported 
employment services needed to ensure that 
people with disabilities who are served in 
subminimum wage sheltered workshops to 
receive the services they need to secure and 
maintain competitive integrated employ-
ment. This bill is another important meas-
ure that would bring needed expansion of 
real employment opportunities for people 
with disabilities. 
We stand ready to work with you to help 
secure passage of H.R. 1230 and H.R. 873, both 
of which are important steps to address bar-
riers to full and meaningful employment of 
people with disabilities.

HEATHER ANSLEY,

Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chair, as it out-
lines, people with disabilities already 
face significant barriers to competi-
tive, integrated employment, and we 
cannot allow another barrier to remain 
in their way. 
Mr. Chair, I am proud to vote in 
favor of strengthening the Age Dis-
crimination in Employment Act, and I 
thank 
my 
good 
friend, 
Chairman 
SCOTT, for championing this effort. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in restoring justice for Amer-
ican workers and voting in favor of 
final passage. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD), a dis-
tinguished member of the Committee 
on Education and Labor. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Chair, I thank the 
gentleman from Virginia for yielding. 
Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this 
bill, the Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act. 
Older workers who bring suit for age 
discrimination are often ostracized at 
their workplace. They open their lives 
to invasive probes by defense counsel 
through written discovery, by deposi-
tion, and, ultimately, testifying at a 
trial. 
These probes are often meant to em-
barrass rather than seek the truth. 
When our older workers finally reach 
the courthouse door, it is often almost 
closed before they even get to the 
courtroom. 
As a former civil litigator, I have 
brought and defended multiple age dis-
crimination cases. These are very emo-
tional and difficult claims. 
No one likes getting older, but when 
one has to put one’s age in full view of 
all because of perceived discrimination 
at work, an older worker then has to 
experience the scrutiny of lawyers, 
judges, and juries to prove that he or 
she was discriminated against because 
of age. 
But worse, our older workers are, 
again, discriminated against when they 
seek redress from the courts. That is 
because the Supreme Court, in the 2009 
case of Gross v. FBL Financial Serv-
ices, ruled that an older worker bring-
ing an ADEA claim must prove that 
age was the ‘‘but for’’ cause, the sole 
determining cause of an adverse em-
ployment decision. 
That Supreme Court decision sent a 
message of impunity to employers 
looking to discriminate on the basis of 
age, and it set a precedent for denying 
justice to older workers across our 
country. That is not the standard used 
in other discrimination claims. 
We must condemn employment dis-
crimination in every form it takes. 
Yet, our employment laws treat age 
discrimination claims under the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act dif-
ferently, more harshly, than other em-
ployment discrimination claims. 
We have an opportunity to restore 
fairness in our legal system. 
The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Chair, H.R. 1230, the 
Protecting Older Workers Against Dis-
crimination Act, will ensure equal ac-
cess to justice for those who have suf-
fered age discrimination. It will create 
uniformity in our laws that a worker 
need prove only that age discrimina-
tion was one of any number of moti-
vating factors for an employer’s action. 
Older workers like Mr. Gross, the vic-
tim of workplace discrimination and a 
misguided Supreme Court decision, de-
serve this bill. 
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this 
bill. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Chair, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle contend that the 
2009 Supreme Court decision in Gross v. 
FBL Financial Services has weakened 
age discrimination protections. They 
also contend the decision had deterred 
workers from seeking relief from age 
bias. Let’s look at the data. 
In the 9 years preceding the 2009 Su-
preme Court decision in Gross, the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission, the EEOC, the primary agency 
that enforces Federal laws that make 
it illegal to discriminate, received an 
average of 19,320 charges of discrimina-
tion per year relating to age discrimi-
nation—19,320. 
An EEOC charge is a signed state-
ment asserting employment discrimi-
nation. In the 9 years following Gross, 
the EEOC received an average 20,973 
charges per year relating to age dis-
crimination, a slight uptick from the 
previous 9 years. 
There is clearly no evidence workers 
have been discouraged from filing age 
discrimination charges with the EEOC 
since the 2009 Supreme Court decision. 
We also found that age discrimina-
tion charges as a percentage of all 
charges filed with the EEOC are ap-
proximately the same for the 9 years 
before and after the Gross decision, 23.2 
percent before and 22.8 percent after-
ward. 
Again, this does not indicate workers 
are discouraged from filing age dis-
crimination charges. Congress should 
make fact-based decisions. In this case, 
the facts do not support what H.R. 
1230’s proponents have asserted. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), the co- 
chair of the Democratic Caucus Task 
Force on Aging and Families. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chair, I 
thank Chairman SCOTT for yielding to 
me, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 
1230, the Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act. 
This month, House Democrats are 
taking historic action to fight for our 
older Americans across the country. As 
cofounder and co-chair of the Demo-
cratic Caucus Task Force on Aging and 
Families, I am proud to announce that 
our Older Americans Bill of Rights, 
which we will introduce in the coming 
weeks, already has over 100 cosponsors. 
That resolution reflects a covenant 
with senior citizens and urges the Con-
gress to uphold the dignity of older 
Americans and their families. 
Through 
that 
resolution, 
House 
Democrats are affirming that seniors 
have the right to live with dignity and 
with independence, including the right 
to high-quality healthcare, the right to 
age in place, and the right to financial 
security, including protecting against 
age discrimination in the workplace. 
The bill that we are voting on today 
signals that we are taking those rights 
so seriously that we are not just mak-
ing statements about it, but we are 
taking bold action. The bill before us 
ensures that senior citizens who have 
been victims of age discrimination can 
have their claims adjudicated fairly 
without having to jump through all 
kinds of arbitrary hoops created by a 
misguided court decision. 
Protecting older workers is about 
more than just adjudicating claims of 
discrimination. It is about ensuring

older workers have the dignity that 
they deserve. 
Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues 
to support this measure. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Chair, older workers are doing 
quite well in today’s modern economy. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, BLS, employment for workers 
age 65 and older tripled from 1988 to 
2018, while employment for younger 
workers grew by a third. The number 
of employed people age 75 and older 
nearly quadrupled from 461,000 in 1988 
to 1.8 million in 2018. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle paint a bleak picture of these 
valued workers standing in the work-
force, 
when, 
in 
fact, 
employment 
trends for older workers are positive in 
recent decades. 
According to BLS, in 1998, the me-
dian weekly earnings of older full-time 
employees was 77 percent of the median 
for workers age 16 and up. In 2018, older 
workers earned 7 percent more than 
the median for all workers. 
The labor force participation rate for 
older workers has been rising steadily 
since the late 1990s. Participation rates 
for younger age groups either declined 
or flattened over this period. 
Over the past 20 years, the number of 
older workers on full-time work sched-
ules grew 21⁄2 times faster than the 
number working part time. 
As I said, the picture is bright. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL). 
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Chair, I thank 
the gentleman from Virginia and my 
colleagues for their work on this bill. 
Mr. Chair, Ben Franklin signed the 
Declaration of Independence at age 70. 
Grandma Moses started painting at age 
76. We should never, ever put an age 
limit on our dreams or the ability to 
make a living. 
But here is the thing, Mr. Chair: You 
can be a dedicated employee, having 
spent decades building a career that 
you are proud of, taking care of your 
family, putting your kids through col-
lege, saving for your future. You need 
and want to work and, one day, when 
you are ready, retire with dignity. But 
then, out of nowhere, your life is shat-
tered. Your bosses say: ‘‘You are fired.’’ 
They list their reasons. However, you 
know the truth. You have been let go 
to make way for a younger employee. 
Now you are without a salary, without 
your health insurance. You know your 
odds of getting a new job are slim when 
you are competing with 20-year-olds 
and 30-year-olds who are willing to 
work for lower wages and fewer bene-
fits. 
For too many seniors, Mr. Chair, this 
is a reality. 
Nearly three in five workers have ex-
perienced 
age-based 
discrimination, 
not only unfairly depriving the worker 
of a paycheck but taking valuable 
workers out of the workforce. 
Now, a Supreme Court decision has 
made it even harder to prove age dis-
crimination. 
Mr. 
Chair, 
the 
Protecting 
Older 
Workers Against Discrimination Act 
would give senior workers the protec-
tion they deserve and society the work-
ers that we need. 
The 
poet 
Robert 
Browning 
said: 
‘‘Grow old with me, the best is yet to 
be.’’ 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support this very, very good bill. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Chair, I really find it puzzling 
that our colleagues paint such a dismal 
picture of employers. We hear this over 
and over and over again from the other 
side of the aisle. 
As my colleague from Michigan said 
a little while ago, we have 7 million un-
filled jobs in the country right now. 
Every employer I know, before I came 
to Congress and since I have been in 
Congress, cherishes his or her employ-
ees. They don’t dismiss employees out 
of hand just because of their age. They 
just don’t do that. They value their 
employees. 
b 1415 
But the other side of the aisle has a 
real distorted picture of what happens 
in the private sector. 
I want to say that H.R. 1230 doesn’t 
achieve the goals espoused by the bill’s 
sponsors, and let me provide much- 
needed truth in advertising about this 
bill. 
Under the bill as written, most plain-
tiffs, even if they are successful, will 
not be entitled to receive any mone-
tary damages, payments, or reinstate-
ment. Here is why. 
Generally, a victim of discrimination 
is entitled to be made whole, to be put 
in the position the individual would 
have been in without the discrimina-
tion. This can include monetary dam-
ages, back pay, reinstatement, attor-
ney’s fees, and court costs. 
The Supreme Court, in the 2009 Gross 
case, eliminated the defense that al-
lows an employer to demonstrate it 
would have taken the same employ-
ment action regardless of age. H.R. 1230 
restores this employer defense. 
An overwhelming majority of em-
ployers will be able to make this dem-
onstration to the court, and when they 
make that demonstration, under H.R. 
1230, the plaintiff will not be entitled 
to receive any monetary damages, pay-
ments, or reinstatement, although the 
plaintiffs’ attorneys will be entitled to 
fees. So the only party who wins in 
these cases are the trial lawyers. 
In addition, H.R. 1230 is specifically 
written to allow plaintiffs to survive a 
summary judgment motion that would 
end their case. But the plaintiff is in 
for a surprise later when, after going to 
court, he or she receives no monetary 
damages, and the only one getting paid 
is his or her attorney. To add insult to 
injury, the employee may have to pay 
income taxes on the fees that are 
awarded to his or her attorney. 
The bill’s sponsors never explain how 
adding the provisions that include 
mixed-motive claims and restoring the 
employer defense allowing employers 
to demonstrate they would have taken 
the same action regardless of the im-
permissible factor, such as age, will 
benefit employees. In fact, these provi-
sions will only help trial lawyers. 
H.R. 1230’s title and provisions are 
yet another case of false advertising 
and empty promises for older workers. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. STEFANIK), a dis-
tinguished member of the Committee 
on Education and Labor. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, in my dis-
trict, older Americans are staying in 
the workforce longer than previous 
generations, making significant con-
tributions to our growing economy; yet 
these later years of a worker’s career 
are becoming increasingly unstable. 
Over half of the workers over the age 
of 50 are pushed out of longtime jobs 
before they are ready to retire. 
The consequences of age discrimina-
tion are particularly harmful because, 
once older workers are removed from 
the workforce, they are more likely to 
remain 
unemployed. 
The 
economic 
strain that this can cause for them and 
their families is significant. 
But losing a career is bigger than 
just 
financial 
security. 
Separating 
adults from the dignity of work has a 
broader impact on the well-being of 
communities like my district, where I 
serve one of the largest constituencies 
of older Americans in the entire coun-
try. 
This bill strengthens the ADEA by 
reaffirming the pre-2009 standard, sim-
ply, that age discrimination cannot be 
a motivating factor in employment de-
cisions. 
I am proud to support H.R. 1230 on 
behalf of the many constituents of the 
21st District who have advocated for 
this bill for over a decade. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
It is encouraging to see more and 
more older Americans continue to 
make invaluable contributions in the 
workplace, and committee Republicans 
are committed to eliminating discrimi-
nation in the workplace to ensure a 
productive and competitive workforce. 
Unfortunately, H.R. 1230 is an unnec-
essary and misleading bill that does 
not ‘‘protect older workers’’ and is yet 
another case of false advertising and 
empty promises. 
Committee Democrats failed to allow 
a proper examination of H.R. 1230, de-
priving Members of the opportunity to 
review the legislation appropriately be-
fore it was considered by the com-
mittee, and, as a result, we are left

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H263 
January 15, 2020 
with the ill-advised bill before us 
today. 
This 
one-size-fits-all, 
government- 
knows-best approach is not the answer 
and will significantly benefit trial law-
yers at the cost of older American 
workers. 
I strongly encourage a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
H.R. 1230, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Chair, it has been more than a 
decade 
since 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
heightened the burden of proof for 
workers seeking to legally challenge 
age discrimination in the workplace; 
however, our responsibility to ensure 
that no older Americans are forced out 
of a job or denied a work opportunity 
because of age has not changed. 
At a time when Americans are work-
ing longer into their lives, we need pol-
icy solutions that empower older work-
ers to challenge workplace discrimina-
tion. We know that a 2018 survey by the 
AARP showed that three out of five 
workers age 45 or older had seen or ex-
perienced age discrimination in the 
workplace. 
Some of my colleagues contend that 
this bill was rushed to the floor; how-
ever, we must remember that this is a 
bipartisan proposal that has undergone 
substantial debate since it was first in-
troduced in 2009. Over the past 10 years, 
Congress has deliberated on this legis-
lation through four hearings, including 
two hearings in the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. 
Both the House and Senate have in-
troduced and gradually improved this 
legislation in the 111th, 112th, 113th, 
114th, 115th, and the current 116th Con-
gress. It is long overdue. 
The 
Protecting 
Older 
Workers 
Against Discrimination Act is a bipar-
tisan, bicameral solution that restores 
protections for older workers and en-
sures that we treat all workers facing 
discrimination, whether it is on the 
basis of sex, race, religion, national or-
igin, or age, with consistency and fair-
ness. 
I want to thank Congressman SEN-
SENBRENNER
for working with us to 
bring this important legislation to the 
floor. 
I want to remind everyone exactly 
what this bill does. 
Under the bill and before 2009, if a 
person could prove discrimination, that 
was the beginning of the case. The de-
fendant would be able to show that 
they would have been fired or not hired 
anyway, but that is on the defendant to 
show. If they don’t show that, then it is 
proven discrimination, entitling the 
plaintiff to damages. If the defendant 
can show that it would have done it 
anyway, 
discrimination 
is 
already 
proved, and, as the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina pointed out, attorney’s 
fees would be available. 
Under the new law, after 2009, not 
only do you have to prove that you 
were discriminated against, told we 
don’t higher old people, you also have 
to prove that you would have gotten 
the job anyway. 
Well, you don’t have that informa-
tion. You can’t show that you would 
have gotten the job. You don’t know 
the qualifications of the person who 
was hired. 
So, Mr. Chair, we know that this leg-
islation is extremely important. Older 
workers want this legislation, as evi-
denced by a letter of support from the 
Leadership Council of Aging Organiza-
tions, over two dozen organizations 
representing senior citizens; another 
letter, joined by 26 advocacy organiza-
tions supporting the bill; and, finally, a 
letter of support from AARP. 
Mr. Chair, I include these letters in 
the RECORD.

DEAR MAJORITY LEADER MCCONNELL, MI-
NORITY LEADER SCHUMER, SPEAKER PELOSI, 
AND MINORITY LEADER MCCARTHY: The Lead-
ership 
Council 
of 
Aging 
Organizations 
(LCAO) is a coalition of 69 national nonprofit 
organizations concerned with the well-being 
of America’s older population and com-
mitted to representing their interests in the 
policy-making arena. 
We are writing to urge you to vote for pas-
sage 
of 
the 
Protecting 
Older 
Workers 
Against Discrimination Act (S. 485, H.R. 
1230). The Protecting Older Workers Against 
Discrimination Act (POWADA) is bipartisan 
and bicameral legislation sponsored in the 
Senate by Senators Bob Casey (D–PA) and 
Chuck Grassley (R–IA). The House version is 
sponsored by Representatives Bobby Scott 
(D–VA) and Jim Sensenbrenner (R–Wl). The 
House Education and Labor Committee 
voted on June 11, 2019 to approve POWADA. 
Age discrimination is pervasive and stub-
bornly entrenched. Six in 10 older workers 
have experienced age discrimination and 90% 
of them say it is common. It is even more 
pervasive among older women and African 
American workers; nearly two thirds of 
women and three-fourths of African Ameri-
cans say they have seen or experienced work-
place age discrimination. 
Courts have not taken age discrimination 
as seriously as other forms of discrimination 
and older workers have fewer protections as 
a result. Ten years ago, in Gross v. FBL Fi-
nancial Services Inc., the Supreme Court set 
a higher standard of proof for age discrimi-
nation than previously applied and much 
higher than for other forms of discrimina-
tion. Since Gross, court decisions have con-
tinued to chip away at protections. As a re-
sult, plaintiffs now have to prove that age 
was a determinative, ‘‘but-for’’ cause for 
their employers’ adverse treatment of them. 
Before the Gross case, it was enough for 
plaintiffs to prove that age was one of the 
motivating factors. POWADA would restore 
the standard of proof in age discrimination 
cases to the pre-2009 level, and treat age dis-
crimination as just as wrong as other forms 
of employment discrimination. Moreover, be-
cause courts have applied Gross’ higher bur-
den of proof to retaliation charges and to 
disability 
discrimination, 
it 
would 
also 
amend the Age Discrimination in Employ-
ment Act, Title VII’s provision on retalia-
tion, the Americans with Disabilities Act, 
and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 
Please vote to restore fairness for older 
workers by passing the Protecting Older 
Workers Against Discrimination Act (S. 485, 
H.R. 1230).

Hon. BOBBY SCOTT, 
Chairman, Committee on Education and Labor, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
Hon. VIRGINIA FOXX, 
Ranking Member, Committee on Education and 
Labor, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN SCOTT AND RANKING MEM-
BER FOXX: On behalf of the undersigned orga-
nizations and the millions of workers we rep-
resent, we urge all Committee Members to 
vote to support H.R. 1230, the Protecting 
Older Workers Against Discrimination Act 
(POWADA), sponsored by Chairman Scott 
and 
Rep. 
Jim 
Sensenbrenner 
(R–WI). 
POWADA is bipartisan, limited legislation 
to restore fairness and well-established legal 
standards on workplace discrimination that 
were undermined by certain court decisions. 
To ensure equal treatment and equal op-
portunity in employment, the civil rights 
laws make clear that discrimination in the 
workplace ‘‘because of’’ a protected char-
acteristic or activity is unlawful. For dec-
ades, this meant that discrimination may 
not play any role in employment practices. 
Yet, 10 years ago this month, the Supreme 
Court erected a new and substantial legal 
barrier in the path of equal opportunity for 
older workers. In Gross v. FBL Financial 
Services, Inc. (2009), the Court imposed a 
much higher burden of proof on workers who 
allege age discrimination than is required of 
those who allege discrimination based on 
race, sex, national origin, or religion. Prov-
ing that discrimination tainted the employ-
er’s conduct was no longer enough; after 
Gross, older workers must prove that dis-
crimination played a decisive role in the em-
ployer’s action. 
Since the Gross decision, the Supreme 
Court and lower courts have extended this 
same unreasonably difficult burden of proof 
to other types of civil rights complaints: 
Retaliation—In Title VII cases in which an 
employer retaliates against a worker who 
challenges workplace discrimination based 
on race, sex, or other grounds, the worker

must now prove that retaliation was the de-
cisive cause for their adverse treatment. 
University of Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center v. Nassar (2013). 
Disability discrimination—The Supreme 
Court has not yet ruled on whether workers 
subjected to disability discrimination must 
also meet this much higher standard of cau-
sation, but four federal circuit courts of ap-
peal have ruled that disability-based employ-
ment discrimination must be established 
under the higher, ‘‘but-for’’ causation stand-
ard. 
This line of court decisions has made it ex-
ponentially more difficult for workers who 
have experienced discrimination to have 
their day in court and prove their case. 
These decisions have also sent a terrible 
message to employers and the courts that 
some types of discrimination are not as 
wrong, or as unlawful, as other forms of dis-
crimination. 
POWADA would restore the causation 
standard that was in effect and consistently 
applied by the courts before 2009, and make 
Congress’ intent clear that discrimination in 
the workplace is never acceptable. Please 
support H.R. 1230 and swiftly pass this bipar-
tisan legislation.

Hon. ROBERT C. SCOTT, 
Chairman, Education and Labor Committee, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
SCOTT: 
On 
behalf 
of 
AARP’s nearly 38 million members, includ-
ing the approximately 91,000 AARP members 
in Virginia’s Third Congressional District, I 
extend our sincere thanks for leading efforts 
to introduce and move the Protecting Older 
Workers Against Discrimination Act. 
Older workers are a valuable asset to their 
employers and to the nation’s economy. Yet, 
AARP polling shows that over 60% of older 
workers believe they have seen or experi-
enced age discrimination in the workplace. 
Discrimination 
is 
especially 
devastating 
when workers are terminated from long-time 
jobs, and face entrenched age bias in hiring. 
H.R. 1230 will correct the 2009 Supreme 
Court decision in Gross v. FBL Financial 
Services, Inc. (and subsequent discrimina-
tion cases that followed its reasoning) that 
made it much more difficult to prove job dis-
crimination, and will clarify that proven dis-
crimination may not play any role in em-
ployment decisions. We think the Commit-
tee’s May hearing helped to highlight the 
need for POWADA, and thank you for draw-
ing attention to Jack Gross’ presence there. 
We look forward to the June 11th mark- 
up—as you may know, this will be the first 
time that POWADA has been marked up and 
voted on in committee—and to working with 
you and your staff to shepherd this legisla-
tion through the House of Representatives 
before the August recess. Thank you again 
for your leadership and support. 
Sincerely, 
NANCY LEAMOND, 
Executive Vice President, 
Chief Advocacy & Engagement Officer. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, today, 
I rise in support of H.R. 1230, the Protecting 
Older Workers Against Discrimination Act, 
which will restore protections for older Ameri-
cans against age discrimination in the work-
place. This legislation will ensure that older 
workers will once again have the same legal 
protections against age discrimination as 
those that exist for discrimination based on 
race, religion, sex, or national origin. 
As the cost of living rises and retirement 
savings shrink, Americans now more than 
ever before are faced with the necessity of 
working later into their lives. It is critical that 
we, as members of this body, enact protec-
tions for older workers because if older work-
ers lose their jobs, they are far more likely to 
face long-term unemployment. We must guar-
antee that age discrimination should be treat-
ed just as seriously as any other form of work-
place discrimination. 
This bill amends four laws—the Age Dis-
crimination in Employment Act, Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with 
Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. It 
ensures that the higher burden of proof for 
age discrimination claims are lowered to in-
clude mixed-motive claims. This equates to 
standard practices for workplace discrimination 
claims based on race, religion, sex, or national 
origin. 
As a member of the House Democratic 
Caucus Task Force on Aging & Families, I am 
proud to support our seniors and their families 
in communities across our country through the 
Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimina-
tion Act. 
The CHAIR. All time for general de-
bate has expired. 
Pursuant to rule, the bill shall be 
considered for amendment under the 5- 
minute rule. 
In lieu of the amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute recommended by 
the 
Committee 
on 
Education 
and 
Labor, printed in the bill, an amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute con-
sisting of the text of Rules Committee 
Print 116–46, shall be considered as 
adopted. 
The bill, as amended, shall be consid-
ered as the original bill for the purpose 
of further amendment under the 5- 
minute rule and shall be considered as 
read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as 
follows: 
H.R. 1230

resentatives of the United States of America in

fornia (Mr. DESAULNIER) and a Member 
opposed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chair, the 
American workforce is getting older 
and working longer than ever before. In 
fact, by 2024, the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics estimated that 25 percent of the 
U.S. workforce will be composed of 
workers over the age of 55, and a third 
of those workers will be older than 65. 
At the same time, complaints of age 
discrimination are on the rise. Accord-
ing 
to 
enforcement 
statistics, 
the 
EEOC received over 20,000 complaints 
of age discrimination in 2017, account-
ing for 23 percent of all discrimination 
charges filed that year. That is a jump 
of 4,000 charges of age discrimination 
since the year 2000 and is likely a se-
vere underestimate, as cases of age dis-
crimination often go unreported. 
More so, a 2018 study published by 
the AARP found that more than 60 per-
cent of workers age 45 and older have 
seen or experienced age discrimination, 
and 76 percent say that they consider 
age discrimination to be a major obsta-
cle to finding a new job. 
The 
Protecting 
Older 
Workers 
Against Discrimination Act would help 
address this problem by making the 
burden of proof for age discrimination 
claims more equitable and more in line 
with other forms of discrimination. 
This has important implications for 
older workers. Fewer cases could be 
thrown out or settled before trial, 
meaning long overdue justice for older 
Americans. It would also have impor-
tant implications for the EEOC, ush-
ering in a significant increase to the 
number of age discrimination claims 
and, therefore, EEOC’s workload. 
My amendment goes one step further 
and ensures that Congress has a full 
picture of the scope of age discrimina-
tion in the American workforce and a 
better understanding of existing gaps 
in the EEOC’s ability to address and 
prevent workplace age discrimination. 
This would allow Congress to better 
support the EEOC in its work, mean-
ingfully address age discrimination in 
the American workforce, and empower 
millions of older Americans. 
I would like to thank my colleague, 
Congressman DAVIS, for his bipartisan 
partnership, and I urge support for this 
amendment. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The CHAIR. The gentlewoman is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, as my colleague from California 
and my colleague from Illinois know, I 
respect both of them greatly, and I 
would have thought that they would 
have come up with an amendment that 
would have helped us understand this 
issue before we pass such a bill instead 
of after we pass it. 
As I understand it, this amendment 
requires the GAO to report on the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission’s ability to investigate and 
process age discrimination cases after 
H.R. 1230 unnecessarily reduces the 
burden of proof in these cases and nul-
lifies decades of Supreme Court prece-
dent. 
This amendment is not needed. The 
EEOC already reports on its workload 
management and ability to respond to 
age discrimination charges in the agen-
cy’s annual budget request and recur-
ring strategic plans. We should not 
mandate that GAO waste resources on 
an unnecessary, redundant report. 
b 1430 
In addition, assuming this GAO re-
port discovers new information, such 
information would be useful before the 
House votes to expand liability in four 
employment statutes. The new law will 
be in place, and the horse will have al-
ready left the barn by the time we re-
ceive the information.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H266 
January 15, 2020 
We all agree, American workers 
should be protected from discrimina-
tion in the workplace in every form 
possible. It is already against the law 
to discriminate based on a workers’ 
age, as it should be. Congress has en-
acted separate nondiscrimination stat-
utes, including the Age Discrimination 
in Employment Act because age dis-
crimination includes issues that are 
different from other forms of discrimi-
nation addressed in other statutes. 
Under H.R. 1230, a plaintiff can argue 
that age was only a motivating, not a 
decisive factor that led to an employ-
er’s unfavorable employment action. 
Allowing such mixed-motive claims 
will lead to more frivolous litigation 
and upset the careful balance Congress 
enacted in the Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act. 
Unfortunately, H.R. 1230 will not help 
workers. Under the bill, a plaintiff is 
very unlikely to receive any monetary 
damages from a defendant because 
most employers would be able to show 
to the Court that they would have 
taken the same employment action, re-
gardless of the worker’s age. The only 
parties who will win in nearly all cases 
in H.R. 1230 are trial lawyers. 
Disappointingly, 
Democrats 
have 
chosen to further their pro-trial-lawyer 
agenda by bringing H.R. 1230 up for 
consideration, a bill falsely advertised 
as a protection for workers. H.R. 1230 is 
yet another one-size-fits-all mandate 
that fails to address the purported 
problem, ignores real world experi-
ences, and disregards decades of Su-
preme Court decisions. 
This amendment does nothing to ad-
dress the fundamental flaws in H.R. 
1230, is redundant with other govern-
ment reports, and will not provide the 
House with timely information. I urge 
my colleagues to oppose it. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS), my friend. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Chairman, I thank my good friend Mr. 
DESAULNIER from California for yield-
ing. I also thank my good friend Ms. 
FOXX, the ranking member of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee and also 
Chairman SCOTT for your work on this. 
I rise in support of Mr. DESAULNIER’s 
amendment of which I am a cosponsor. 
This amendment will require the GAO 
to report on the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission’s ability to 
meet the demands of its workload in 
terms of the number of cases they re-
ceive. 
If this important bill is enacted, the 
EEOC will inevitably be required to re-
view an increasing number of mixed- 
motive 
age 
discrimination 
claims, 
which are worthy of review. This 
amendment is important because to 
adequately address workplace discrimi-
nation that relates to age or any other 
factor, we must have the resources to 
address and correct the problem. 
Mr. Chairman, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amend-
ment. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I simply will say again that 
I think we should vote ‘‘no’’ on this 
amendment. I think it is redundant 
and unnecessary. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I 
appreciate the comments by the rank-
ing member, and I hope we will con-
tinue our respect and friendship even 
though we are in disagreement on this. 
I urge support of this amendment, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The CHAIR. The question is on the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from California (Mr. DESAULNIER). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. RODNEY 
DAVIS OF ILLINOIS 
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 2 printed in 
House Report 116–377. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Chairman, I have an amendment at the 
desk. 
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate 
the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end, add the following: 
SEC. 5. STUDY AND REPORT TO CONGRESS. 
Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
Labor and the Equal Opportunity Employ-
ment Commission shall jointly conduct a 
study to determine the number of claims 
pending or filed, in addition to cases closed, 
by women who may have been adversely im-
pacted by age discrimination as a moti-
vating factor in workplace discrimination or 
employment termination. The Secretary of 
Labor and Chairman of the Commission shall 
jointly submit to the Congress, and make 
available to the public, a report that con-
tains the results of the study, including rec-
ommendations for best practices to prevent 
and to combat gender and age discrimination 
as it relates to women in the workplace. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 790, the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Illinois. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume. 
I rise in support of my bipartisan 
amendment to H.R. 1230, the Pro-
tecting Older Workers Against Dis-
crimination Act. 
I would like to thank my friends on 
both sides of the aisle for their cospon-
sorship of my amendment, including 
Representatives

TUR,

SPANBERGER, 
BETTY 
MCCOLLUM, MARK DESAULNIER, DAVID 
TRONE, CHRIS SMITH, PETE STAUBER, 
WILL HURD, and my colleague from the 
great State of Illinois, MIKE BOST. I 
also thank Chairman SCOTT for his sup-
port for this amendment. 
I was proud to cosponsor this bill, 
which provides an important fix caused 
by the 2009 Gross v. FBL Financial 
Services, Inc. Supreme Court decision. 
This bill will ensure that older workers 
can seek the justice they deserve when 
they face age discrimination in the 
workplace on a level playing field. 
My amendment highlights the dis-
crimination that women face in the 
workplace based not only on gender 
but on age, as well. 
According to a 2018 report from the 
EEOC, women, especially older women, 
but also those at middle age, were sub-
jected to more age discrimination than 
most older men. In fact, some research 
suggests that ageism at work begins at 
age 40 for women, 5 years earlier than 
men. This is unacceptable, and we 
must find ways to correct the problem. 
This amendment would require the 
Department of Labor and the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission 
to conduct a comprehensive study on 
these age discrimination cases. DOL 
and the EEOC would then be required 
to make recommendations for best 
practices to combat age discrimination 
of women in the workplace. 
The challenges that women face are 
not partisan issues, and together we 
can and should, Mr. Chairman, make 
every effort to address them. Employ-
ers should make, and have the right 
tools to make, conscious efforts to en-
sure that women have equal rights and 
opportunities in the workplace regard-
less of their age. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
my amendment to protect older adults 
from age discrimination. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I claim the time in opposition to 
the amendment, even though I am not 
opposed to it. 
The CHAIR. Without objection, the 
gentleman from Virginia is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Maine (Ms. PINGREE), who 
worked hard with the sponsor of this 
amendment. 
Ms. 
PINGREE. 
Mr. 
Chairman, 
I 
thank Mr. SCOTT for yielding and also 
his leadership on the bill we are consid-
ering this afternoon, the Protecting 
Older Workers Against Discrimination 
Act. 
Maine is the oldest State in the 
union 
by 
median 
age, 
and 
older 
Mainers are an important part of our 
workforce. As we experience a tight 
labor market with low unemployment, 
it is natural to think that this work-
force would have more opportunities 
available to them, and yet we often 
hear about constituents who struggle 
to find and keep work that supports 
themselves and their families. 
When age discrimination is a factor, 
these workers deserve fair treatment 
under the law. I am proud to be a co-
sponsor of the underlying bill and urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’

I am also proud to offer this impor-
tant amendment with my colleague, 
Congressman DAVIS, that addresses the 
connection between age and gender dis-
crimination. Countless studies have 
shown that women are hired less and 
paid less in many fields. Compounded 
by the real effects of age discrimina-
tion, that means older women are dis-
proportionately impacted by bias in 
the workplace. 
The National Bureau of Economic 
Research backs this up. In a 2015 field 
experiment, resumes from older women 
got substantially fewer call backs from 
employers than those from older men, 
younger men, and younger women. Our 
amendment would direct the Depart-
ment of Labor and the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission to col-
lect data on the disproportionate im-
pact of age discrimination on older 
women and make recommendations for 
how to address that impact. 
Women 
are 
deeply, 
materially 
harmed by inequities in our economy. 
On average, they take home lower sala-
ries, are able to save less for retire-
ment, and receive less in Social Secu-
rity benefits. 
In tandem with age discrimination, 
all this means that we are leaving 
older women vulnerable. Addressing 
this intersection is about economic se-
curity, making sure that older women 
have the chance to work in fair envi-
ronments for equitable pay. 
I ask my colleagues to support this 
amendment. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Chairman, may I inquire how much 
time I have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Illinois has 3 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield as much time as she 
may consume to the gentlewoman from 
Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N), 
my good friend. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Mr. Chair-
man, I thank Congressman DAVIS for 
yielding to allow me to speak on this 
bipartisan amendment. And thank you 
for allowing me to be a cosponsor of 
this amendment. 
The Age Discrimination in Employ-
ment Act of 1967 was signed into law 
more than 52 years ago. Yet, according 
to the American Association of Retired 
Persons, AARP, three in five older 
workers have seen or experienced age 
discrimination. Between 1997 and 2018, 
423,000 workers filed an age discrimina-
tion complaint averaging 20,142 claims 
per year. This figure is 22 percent of all 
workplace discrimination claims 
Furthermore, AARP reports that 76 
percent see age discrimination as a 
barrier to finding a new job. The Puer-
to Rico Department of Labor and 
Human Resources states that there are 
more than 300,000 women age 35 or 
older in the labor force on the island. 
This population represents 28.8 percent 
of all workers in an economy that has 
experienced a structured downturn for 
more than a decade. 
This amendment simply requires the 
labor secretary and the chair of the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission to submit a report determining 
the number of women who may have 
been discriminated against because of 
their age. 
As vice chair of the Congressional 
Caucus for Women’s Issues, I am proud 
to support this measure to assist aging 
women in the workforce. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I 
thank the gentleman from Virginia for 
yielding. And I thank the sponsors of 
this very important amendment, Mr. 
DAVIS and Ms. PINGREE. 
I rise to support the underlying bill, 
the Protecting Older Workers Against 
Discrimination Act that I am very 
proud to have been a cosponsor of. 
What kind of thanks are we giving to 
hardworking Americans who, because 
of the growth of this population senior 
citizens, older Americans, they are 
ready to work in the workforce and 
provide 
their 
experience, 
their 
thoughtfulness, and their leadership. 
Unfortunately, a Supreme Court de-
cision in the 2000s turned this upside 
down by requiring those older Ameri-
cans to be burdened by the responsi-
bility of saying, it is only the fact that 
we are old or that there are not mul-
tiple reasons why I could have been 
fired. How dangerous that is when an 
older American feels vulnerable? 
The underlying amendment is also 
very important, dealing with women 
who may have had to get out of the 
workforce to raise their children or to 
not get promotions so they can tend to 
their children or other matters or be a 
caretaker for other family members. 
This is an important initiative to 
equalize the playing field, to value 
those older Americans with experience 
who are ready to work, who have been 
giving their best, and who are ready to 
be the kind of experienced mentors in 
the workplace that really make Amer-
ica great. 
I rise to support this legislation. It is 
vital to both impact and correct a very 
bad decision by the United States Su-
preme Court, and I believe that this 
will give the kind of affirmation to the 
value of all Americans, and particu-
larly our older Americans. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Chairman, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this 
bipartisan amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself the balance of my

this Act and the amendments made by this 
Act shall not take effect until the date the 
Government Accountability Office reports to 
the Congress the results of a study such Of-
fice carries out to determine whether— 
(1) the Supreme Court’s decisions in Gross 
v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 557 U.S. 167 
(2009), and Texas Southwestern Medical Center 
v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338 (2013), have discouraged

uals from filing age discrimination cases and 
title VII cases, and 
(3) the success rates of age discrimination 
cases and title VII cases brought has de-
creased.

carried out under subsection (a) show that 
individuals have not been discouraged as de-
scribed in such subsection and that the suc-
cess rate of cases described in such sub-
section has not decreased, then this Act and 
the amendments made by this Act shall not 
take effect.

When considering any legislation, the 
House should first determine whether 
the legislation is needed and, next, 
whether the bill under consideration 
will adequately address or improve the 
situation. 
The Committee on Education and 
Labor, unfortunately, did not have a 
full hearing on H.R. 1230 and heard 
from only one witness, invited by the 
Democrats, about the bill at a general 
hearing on multiple topics. 
This legislation, at the very least, de-
served a standalone hearing so that 
committee members and the House 
could get more information to make a 
considered decision regarding this leg-
islation. 
Publicly available data does not show 
the Supreme Court decisions in Gross 
v. FBL Financial Services or Nassar v. 
University of Texas Southwestern Med-
ical Center have discouraged individ-
uals from filing discrimination charges 
with the EEOC, which is the primary 
agency that enforces Federal laws that 
make it illegal to discriminate. A dis-
crimination charge is a signed state-
ment asserting employment discrimi-
nation.

several topics and bills, acknowledged 
that it is difficult to quantify the im-
pact that the Gross decision has had on 
the number of older workers who bring 
cases and the number of those who win 
them. 
This witness also acknowledged that 
when we might have expected a drop in 
charges due to Gross-inspired discour-
agement from employment attorneys, 
there was a sizeable jump in the num-
ber of ADEA charges filed at EEOC. 
EEOC data shows that the rate of 
EEOC age discrimination charges as a 
percentage of all charges filed is ap-
proximately the same for the 9 years 
before and after the Gross decision. 
There has been a slight uptick in 
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act retal-
iation charges as a percentage of all 
charges filed in the 4 years following 
the Nassar decision, which does not in-
dicate individuals have been discour-
aged from filing these charges. 
Court decisions show that the plain-
tiffs have continued to win age dis-
crimination and Title VII retaliation 
cases in the wake of the Supreme 
Court’s decisions in Gross and Nassar. 
This amendment will provide Con-
gress much-needed data on the impact 
of the two Supreme Court cases at 
issue in H.R. 1230. 
If the GAO report indicates Gross and 
Nassar have not discouraged individ-
uals from seeking relief or from achiev-
ing it, the bill would not go into effect. 
The House should look before it 
leaps, and Members should vote in 
favor of this amendment to ensure this 
happens. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
The CHAIR. The gentleman is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise today to speak in opposi-
tion to Mr. ALLEN’s amendment to 
delay the effects of this bill. 
We do not need a study to tell us that 
a substantially higher burden of proof 
for 
some 
forms 
of 
discrimination 
makes it far more difficult for workers 
to get their day in court and to prevail. 
People may be winning cases, but they 
are not going to court in the first place 
in huge numbers. 
When cases become materially more 
difficult to win, attorneys become 
much less willing and able to represent 
workers in those cases. 
We have already had a 10-year delay 
in restoring justice. No more delays are 
necessary or warranted. 
Age discrimination in the workplace 
is disturbingly pervasive. According to 
an AARP study released last year, 
three in five older workers report that 
they have seen or experienced age dis-
crimination on the job. That is 60 per-
cent. 
Nearly two-thirds of women and 
more than three-fourths of African 
American workers age 45 and older say 
they have seen or experienced age dis-
crimination in the workplace. Three- 
fourths of workers age 45 and older 
blame age discrimination for their own 
lack of confidence in finding a job. 
Mr. Chairman, I ran the workforce 
system in the State of Michigan for 4 
years. Over and over again, I met work-
ers who had lost their jobs because of 
age 
discrimination. 
Most 
of 
them 
weren’t even contemplating taking 
legal action. They were just seeking 
help to find a new job. 
I remember a gentleman from Bay 
City in Michigan who had been in col-
lege years earlier when his dad died of 
a heart attack suddenly. His mom said 
to him: ‘‘Sorry, son. You know every-
body has to help keep the family 
afloat.’’ So he dropped out of college, 
and he went to work in retail. 
I met him 30 years later. He had been 
a manager at a sporting goods store, 
and the corporation looked at him and 
said: ‘‘We can get somebody way 
younger than that to run this store for 
half the money,’’ and they fired him. 
Thankfully, we had the No Worker 
Left Behind program in the State of 
Michigan, and he was able to go back 
and finish his bachelor’s degree. But he 
wasn’t even contemplating taking legal 
action under this statute. 
I ran into those cases over and over, 
Mr. Chairman. 
The enactment of the Age Discrimi-
nation in Employment Act, or ADEA, 
in 1967 was an important part of Con-
gress’ work to define and protect civil 
rights in the 1960s. Over the years, the 
courts have failed to interpret the 
ADEA as a civil rights statute and, in-
stead, have narrowly interpreted these 
protections and broadly construed the 
statute’s exceptions, compounding the 
barriers facing older workers. 
The 
Protecting 
Older 
Workers 
Against Discrimination Act is a bipar-
tisan proposal that realigns the legal 
standard for proving age discrimina-
tion, to simplify the requirement so 
employees have a genuine mechanism 
to fight back under the law, just like 
with the standards for proving dis-
crimination based on sex, race, or na-
tional origin. It is that simple. 
This amendment is designed to keep 
this bill from going into effect indefi-
nitely. There is no deadline for GAO to 
conduct the study this amendment re-
quires and report back to Congress. It 
is a delay tactic when we already have 
mountains of evidence telling us that 
older workers are facing discrimina-
tion at work. They need protection 
now. 
Finally, this Congress has been hold-
ing hearings on this issue for years. We 
have had four hearings over the last 9 
years. It is time to act. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in opposing this amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chairman, again I 
repeat, the lone witness, a Democratic 
witness at the Committee of Education 
and Labor’s hearing in May on H.R. 
1230, acknowledged that it is difficult 
to quantify the impact that the Gross 
decision had on the number of older 
workers who bring cases and the num-
bers of those who win them. 
This witness also acknowledged that 
we might have expected a drop in 
charges due to the Gross-inspired dis-
couragement from employment attor-
neys, but that there was a sizeable 
jump in ADEA charges filed with the 
EEOC. 
I merely present this amendment to 
make sure that the committee and this 
House look at the data before we have 
some law here that is going to create, 
really, fewer opportunities for people 
to file these charges. 
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on my 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair-
man, I remind everybody that this is a 
bipartisan proposal, and it has under-
gone substantial debate since it was 
first introduced over a decade ago. 
Over the past 10 years, Congress has 
deliberated on this bill through four 
legislative 
hearings, 
including 
two 
hearings in the Education and Labor 
Committee. Both the House and the 
Senate have introduced and gradually 
improved this legislation in the 111th, 
112th, 113th, 114th, 115th, and now the 
116th Congress. It is long overdue that 
we take action. 
Mr. Chair, I urge all colleagues to op-
pose this amendment, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The CHAIR. The question is on the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
The question was taken; and the 
Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chair, I demand a 
recorded vote. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of 
rule XVIII, further proceedings on the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Georgia will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 4 OFFERED BY MR. BROWN OF 
MARYLAND 
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 4 printed in 
House Report 116–377. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair, 
I have an amendment at the desk. 
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate 
the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end, add the following: 
SEC. 5. REPORTS. 
For the 5-year period beginning on the date 
of the enactment of this Act, the Chairman 
of Equal Employment Opportunity Commis-
sion shall submit to the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor of the House of Representa-
tives and the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate a 
report at 1-year intervals on the number of 
age discrimination in employment claims 
brought under this Act with the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission in the pe-
riod for which such report is submitted. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 790, the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. BROWN) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H269 
January 15, 2020 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair, 
I yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 
I would like first to recognize the 
leadership of Chairman BOBBY SCOTT, 
my Potomac partner from Virginia, 
chairman of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor, and the hard work 
and the bipartisan work done in that 
committee to bring this important bill 
to the floor. 
Mr. Chair, older workers are critical 
to our economy and workplaces. How-
ever, 6 in 10 older Americans report 
seeing or experiencing age discrimina-
tion on the job. More than half of older 
workers are fired from their jobs before 
they retire. If they find a new job, 9 in 
10 never match their prior earnings. 
A 2009 Supreme Court decision cre-
ated a higher burden of proof for work-
ers claiming age discrimination than 
any other form of discrimination. 
Enforcement 
statistics 
from 
the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission show the number of age dis-
crimination complaints has been ris-
ing. 
In the year 2000, the EEOC received 
roughly 16,000 age discrimination com-
plaints. That number climbed to over 
20,000 complaints in 2017, or 23 percent 
of all discrimination claims filed. 
Mr. Chairman, my amendment would 
require the EEOC to submit an annual 
report to Congress on the number of 
age discrimination claims under this 
act. 
It is important that Congress re-
ceives this information in a timely and 
transparent way to ensure our older 
workers are being properly protected 
and heard. 
Discrimination 
is 
discrimination, 
whether it is age, race, gender, faith, 
gender identity, or sexual orientation, 
and all should be treated fairly under 
the law. 
My amendment and the underlying 
bill are commonsense pieces of legisla-
tion that would restore fairness for all 
workers. 
Mr. Chair, I strongly encourage my 
colleagues to support my amendment 
and the underlying proposed legisla-
tion. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The CHAIR. The gentlewoman is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, as I understand it, this amend-
ment requires the Chair of the EEOC, 
the primary agency that enforces Fed-
eral laws that make it illegal to dis-
criminate, to submit five annual re-
ports to congressional committees on 
the 
number 
of 
age 
discrimination 
claims brought to the EEOC under this 
act. 
These reports will come after H.R. 
1230 unnecessarily reduces the burden 
of proof in these cases and nullifies 
decades of Supreme Court precedent. 
Before discussing my concerns with 
this amendment, I admit I am puzzled 
that it requires a study on how this 
legislation will affect future age dis-
crimination claims when evidence is 
sorely lacking that there is a need for 
H.R. 1230 in the first place. 
The lone witness who testified on 
H.R. 1230 before the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor acknowledged that 
EEOC data has not shown workers are 
discouraged from filing age discrimina-
tion charges with the EEOC following 
the Supreme Court’s 2009 decision in 
Gross v. FBL Financial Services. 
b 1500 
This witness testified that: ‘‘It is dif-
ficult to quantify the impact that the 
Gross decision has had on the number 
of older workers who bring cases and 
the number of those who win them.’’ 
More information on whether H.R. 
1230 is needed would have been useful, 
but Democrats were unable to provide 
it. 
With respect to this amendment, I 
have concerns about the feasibility of 
the mandated reports. The amendment 
requires the EEOC to report each year 
for 5 years on charges filed with the 
EEOC under H.R. 1230. 
H.R. 1230 expands liability by allow-
ing mixed-motive claims in cases in-
volving the Age Discrimination in Em-
ployment Act, ADEA, and three other 
statutes. However, when a worker files 
charges with the EEOC, the worker 
will likely not indicate whether the 
charge involves mixed motives, nor is 
the EEOC likely to be able to classify 
charges as mixed motive or not. The 
EEOC, therefore, will be unable to de-
termine whether charges have been 
filed pursuant to H.R. 1230. 
I am very doubtful the EEOC would 
be able to comply with this amend-
ment’s 
requirements, 
and 
Congress 
should not include an unrealistic man-
date on an agency. 
As I said before, we don’t need to be 
doing studies after the bill is passed, 
Mr. Chair. We need to know whether 
this bill is necessary. We don’t think it 
is necessary, and doing the studies 
afterward seems a little ridiculous. 
The amendment does nothing to ad-
dress the fundamental flaws in H.R. 
1230 and places an unrealistic mandate 
on the EEOC. Therefore, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose it. 
Since the gentleman has yielded 
back, I believe, I will yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The CHAIR. The question is on the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. BROWN). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 5 OFFERED BY MS. TLAIB 
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 5 printed in 
House Report 116–377. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chair, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate 
the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end, add the following: 
SEC. 5. REPORT BY THE UNITED STATES COMMIS-
SION ON CIVIL RIGHTS. 
(a) REPORT.—With funds appropriated in 
advance to carry out this section, and con-
sistent with the operational and procedural 
requirements of the United States Commis-
sion on Civil Rights, the Commission shall 
submit to the appropriate committees of the 
Congress a report containing an analysis of 
the status of Federal mixed motive age dis-
crimination in employment claims made 
against Federal agencies, including— 
(1) the number of such claims, specified by 
the Federal agency against which such 
claims are made; and 
(2) other related information the Commis-
sion determines to be appropriate. 
(b) SUBMISSION OF REPORT.—The report re-
quired by subsection (a) shall be submitted 
not later that 5 years after the date of the 
enactment of this Act. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 
790, 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chair, I would like to 
begin 
by 
thanking 
our 
chairman, 
Chairman BOBBY SCOTT, and his staff 
for working with me on this and for 
their bipartisan leadership on this bill. 
I appreciate the chairman’s help in al-
lowing me to better serve what I lov-
ingly call Michigan’s 13th District 
strong. 
Before us is an amendment that re-
quires, within 5 years, the United 
States Commission on Civil Rights to 
submit a comprehensive analysis and 
review of Federal mixed-motive age 
discrimination in employment claims 
made against Federal agencies. 
Unfortunately, the Supreme Court 
has made it harder for older workers to 
prove that they were discriminated 
against at their job based on age. 
This bill will strengthen protections 
against age discrimination for our resi-
dents by placing greater accountability 
on the hiring practices of large cor-
porations rather than placing it on the 
shoulders of our older working-class 
residents. 
We know that when an older resident 
and worker loses their job, they are far 
more likely to join the ranks of the 
long-term unemployed community and 
that their age plays a significant role 
in this. I heard countless stories back 
in my district of older residents who 
had significant struggles landing other 
jobs after they were laid off during the 
auto bailout in Michigan. 
One of my residents, Lena, was laid 
off at 55 years old after 22 years with 
Ford Motor Company. She tried for 6 
months to get a similar position, to no 
avail. She told me: ‘‘When they see 22 
years with a company, they know how 
old you are.’’ Since then, she had to re-
locate her family after her 9 months of 
severance pay ran out. 
Passing this bill means that we will 
be 
safeguarding 
our 
older 
Federal 
workers from having to go through 
similar challenges. 
My amendment is a protection meas-
ure that requires the U.S. Commission 
on Civil Rights to submit an analysis

January 15, 2020 
of mixed-motive age discrimination in 
Federal employment claims. We have 
to fight back against these motivating 
factors that have nothing to do with a 
person’s experience or ability. 
It is important that when we pass 
legislation, we ensure that it has pub-
lic data on the outcome in order to be 
transparent and accountable to the 
residents who we serve back home. 
For the sake of our residents and to 
protect our older workforce, Congress 
must ensure that age is not again a 
motivating factor in employment deci-
sions. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I claim time in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The CHAIR. The gentlewoman is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, 
this amendment requires the U.S. Com-
mission on Civil Rights to produce a 
report on mixed-motive claims in age 
discrimination cases filed by Federal 
employees against their Federal agen-
cy employers. I have several concerns 
with this amendment. 
First, the U.S. Commission on Civil 
Rights is a small agency that is not 
well equipped to undertake such a 
study. This amendment requires ‘‘funds 
appropriated in advance,’’ otherwise 
known as taxpayer dollars, to be spent 
to do the report, which means the 
agency doesn’t have the resources to 
take on this mandate. 
Second, while H.R. 1230 was only re-
ferred to the Committee on Education 
and Labor, this amendment involves 
the interests of two other committees 
that are not represented in this debate. 
The Judiciary Committee has jurisdic-
tion over the U.S. Commission on Civil 
Rights, which is tasked with doing the 
report directed by the amendment, and 
the Oversight and Reform Committee 
has jurisdiction over the employment 
relationships between Federal agencies 
and their employees. 
Third, this report will be submitted 
to Congress no later than 5 years after 
the bill goes into effect. I am not sure 
what good a report published 5 years 
from now will do for us who are being 
asked to vote on H.R. 1230 now. 
Fourth, perhaps most importantly, 
there is a lack of evidence that a report 
is needed on age discrimination claims 
in Federal agencies. The Committee on 
Education and Labor received no evi-
dence on this matter. 
With H.R. 1230, Democrats have cho-
sen to further their pro-trial lawyer 
agenda with legislation that masquer-
ades as a protection for workers. 
H.R. 1230 is yet another one-size-fits- 
all approach that fails to address the 
purported problem, neglects the experi-
ence of workers and employers, and 
disregards decades of Supreme Court 
precedent. 
This amendment does nothing to ad-
dress the fundamental flaws in H.R. 
1230, and it directs a small agency to 
conduct a study without a clear basis 
of the need for that study. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose the amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chairman, I think it 
is really important to note that this 
came about because the last report 
that we could find on age discrimina-
tion in this particular area is from the 
1970s. It is about time that we bring 
this forward. 
We could not find anything anywhere 
that specifically looked at this par-
ticular Federal mixed-motive age dis-
crimination kind of study, again, since 
the 1970s. 
The burden of proof is just too high 
on Federal employees. We need to go 
back and be very centered around mak-
ing sure that there is equal access to 
proving a discrimination case of this 
type. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, this is a solution in search of a 
problem. 
We all know that it is almost impos-
sible to fire a Federal employee. In 
fact, I think the number is less than 1 
percent who are fired each year. 
Maybe the reason we haven’t had an 
updated report is because there hasn’t 
been the need for an updated report. I 
think, again, this is a totally unneces-
sary amendment, and I am totally op-
posed to it. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The CHAIR. The question is on the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I move that the Committee do 
now rise. 
The motion was agreed to. 
Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. 
TLAIB) having assumed the chair, Mr. 
CUELLAR, Chair of the Committee of 
the Whole House on the state of the 
Union, reported that that Committee, 
having had under consideration the bill 
(H.R. 1230) to amend the Age Discrimi-
nation in Employment Act of 1967 and 
other laws to clarify appropriate stand-
ards for Federal employment discrimi-
nation and retaliation claims, and for 
other purposes, had come to no resolu-
tion thereon.

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 
Accordingly, 
the 
House 
resolved 
itself into the Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union for the 
further consideration of the bill (H.R.

in Employment Act of 1967 and other 
laws to clarify appropriate standards 
for Federal employment discrimination 
and retaliation claims, and for other 
purposes, with Mr. CUELLAR

chair. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The CHAIR. When the Committee of 
the Whole rose earlier today, amend-
ment No. 5 printed in House Report 
116–377 offered by the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) had been 
disposed of. 
AMENDMENT NO. 3 OFFERED BY MR. ALLEN 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of 
rule XVIII, the unfinished business is 
the demand for a recorded vote on 
amendment No. 3 printed in House Re-
port 116–790 offered by the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN) on which 
further proceedings were postponed and 
on which the noes prevailed by voice 
vote.

Ms. 
DEAN, 
Messrs. 
HECK, 
CUNNINGHAM, Ms. BASS, Mr. ROY, 
Ms. DELAURO, Messrs. GROTHMAN, 
MEADOWS, 
WALDEN, 
SUOZZI, 
PAYNE, and NADLER changed their 
vote from ‘‘aye’’ to ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. KUSTOFF of Tennessee changed 
his vote from ‘‘no’’ to ‘‘aye.’’ 
So the amendment was rejected. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Chair, I was unavoid-
ably detained. Had I been present, I would 
have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 19. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. CICILLINE). 
There being no further amendments 
under the rule, the Committee rises. 
Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR) having assumed the chair, 
Mr. CICILLINE, Acting Chair of the 
Committee of the Whole House on the 
state of the Union, reported that that 
Committee, having had under consider-
ation the bill (H.R. 1230) to amend the 
Age Discrimination in Employment 
Act of 1967 and other laws to clarify ap-
propriate standards for Federal em-
ployment discrimination and retalia-
tion claims, and for other purposes, 
and, pursuant to House Resolution 790, 
he reported the bill, as amended by 
that resolution, back to the House with 
sundry further amendments adopted in 
the Committee of the Whole. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered. 
Is a separate vote demanded on any 
further amendment reported from the 
Committee of the Whole? If not, the 
Chair will put them en gros. 
The amendments were agreed to. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the engrossment and 
third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
motion to recommit at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman opposed to the bill? 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I am in 
its current form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Smucker moves to recommit the bill 
(H.R. 1230) to the Committee on Education 
and Labor, with instructions to report the 
bill back to the House forthwith with the fol-
lowing amendment: 
At the end of the bill, add the following: 
SEC. ll. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. 
Nothing in this Act shall be construed to 
alter the status of a truck driver as an inde-
pendent contractor if the truck driver is cur-
rently considered to be an independent con-
tractor under Federal law. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 min-
utes in support of his motion. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, this 
motion to recommit ensures that noth-
ing in H.R. 1230 shall be construed to 
alter the status of a truck driver who 
is an independent contractor if the 
truck driver is currently considered to 
be an independent contractor under 
Federal law. 
Mr. Speaker, Democrats in Congress 
and in State legislatures across the 
country are currently working to enact 
an unnecessary, backward-looking, and 
confusing legal standard for deter-
mining employee status. Their stand-
ard would deprive millions of Ameri-
cans of the opportunity to work inde-
pendently and to start their own busi-
nesses. 
It seems like bad ideas like this often 
start off in California, and the Demo-
crats’ desire to all but eliminate inde-
pendent contracting is no exception. A 
California law, known as Assembly Bill 
5, is wreaking havoc on workers in in-
dustries ranging from freelance jour-
nalism to ride-sharing and many more. 
The result is heart-wrenching stories 
from workers whose livelihoods have 
been 
turned 
upside 
down 
because 
Democrats have pushed through a rad-
ical leftwing policy. 
Interestingly, California Democrats 
carved out some of their favorite 
friends, but truck drivers were not ex-
empted, despite their opposition, de-
spite their rally at the State Capitol, 
which included blaring their truck 
horns and all. 
Fortunately for truck drivers, a dis-
trict court has recently issued a tem-
porary restraining order blocking en-
forcement of the law against inde-
pendent truck drivers in the State. 
But it doesn’t end there. Democrats 
right here in Congress continue this as-
sault on independent contractors. 
Mr. Speaker, 215 House Democrats 
have cosponsored the PRO Act, legisla-
tion that would take the text of Cali-
fornia’s 
anti-independent 
contractor 
law and make it Federal law, with no 
exemptions for truck drivers, or any-
one else, for that matter.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H272 
January 15, 2020 
Let me say this again. The Demo-
crats’ legislation pending in the House, 
on which, by the way, the majority 
leader promised a vote by President’s 
Day, would impose California’s anti- 
independent contractor law on every 
business in America. 
Independent contracting today al-
lows millions of American families the 
opportunity to live their own American 
Dream. 
I started my own career as an inde-
pendent contractor operating my own 
drywall company at the age of 17. The 
flexibility this status offered allowed 
me to grow the business, building a 
team of hundreds of employees with 
family-sustaining jobs over the course 
of 25 years. 
Independent truck drivers specifi-
cally are able to invest in their own ca-
reers and work for themselves on their 
own schedules while powering the 
American economy across the country. 
Mr. Speaker, according to the Owner- 
Operator Independent Drivers Associa-
tion, there are over 350,000 owner-oper-
ator independent truck drivers in the 
United States. Their average net in-
come in 2018 was well over $50,000, more 
than their professional employee-driv-
er counterparts. 
Last August, I participated in a ride 
with my constituent Randy Martin, 
who is owner-operator of Peachey 
Transport in Denver, Pennsylvania. 
Randy has grown a successful business 
hauling 
premier 
Lancaster 
County 
farm products. 
He has been driving trucks since 1984 
and shared with me that this career 
has allowed him to provide for his fam-
ily while becoming a successful entre-
preneur. It has allowed him and his 
family to achieve their own American 
Dream. 
Randy isn’t the only one. In 2017, a 
company collected stories from drivers 
on why they love trucking. One driver, 
Susan Couch, said: 
I never knew a trucking job would become 
a passion and how much this career would 
change my life. It has allowed me to be inde-
pendent and support my son alone. It has 
given me strength I never knew I had. 
Tu Ngo told the San Francisco 
Chronicle that owning his own truck 
allows him to pursue the American 
Dream he was seeking when he fled 
Vietnam in 1982. 
Eduardo Rangel values the flexibility 
he has to attend his young son’s soccer 
games. 
The stories are endless. 
Independent truck driving provides a 
steady, stable, rewarding, and pros-
perous livelihood for thousands of 
American workers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support these American workers. I urge 
them to support this motion to recom-
mit. A ‘‘yes’’ vote is a vote to support 
prosperity and to support free enter-
prise. 
Don’t let hardworking Americans be-
come victims of a misguided labor 
scheme cooked up by socialist Demo-
crats in California and right here in 
the U.S. Congress. Rather, vote ‘‘yes’’ 
to allow workers all across the country 
to prosper and to live their own Amer-
ican Dream. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-
position to this motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Pennsylvania is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I am not 
sure that my colleague and friend from 
Pennsylvania has read the same bill 
that I did that we are voting on to-
night. 
This bill, the Protecting Older Work-
ers Against Discrimination Act, has 
nothing to do with truck drivers, and it 
has nothing to do with independent 
contractors. 
This motion to recommit is nothing 
more than a distraction from the very 
important legislation that is embodied 
in this bill. This MTR has nothing to 
do with discrimination against older 
workers, which is what we are seeking 
to protect against. 
Why do my friends and colleagues 
across the aisle want to hurt older 
working Americans? This legislation, 
H.R. 1230, was drawn up to fix the dam-
age that has been done by the Supreme 
Court decision in Gross v. FBL in 2009, 
which severely weakened age discrimi-
nation protections. 
Since that decision was made, both 
the Supreme Court and the lower 
courts have relied on it and applied the 
Gross reasoning to the other civil 
rights laws so that it doesn’t just hurt 
older working Americans who are the 
focus of this legislation, but other peo-
ple who suffer from employment dis-
crimination. 
The bill we are considering today is 
the bare bones of what is needed to rec-
tify the damage caused by that deci-
sion. This bill represents a bipartisan, 
bicameral effort that has been 10 years 
in the making. 
H.R. 1230 amends the Nation’s core 
civil rights laws to expressly allow for 
mixed-motive claims, meaning, when 
an employer claims multiple motives 
for terminating an employee, one of 
which is age discrimination, that that 
will not be permitted. 
Since the Gross decision in 2009, age 
discrimination continues to be a sig-
nificant barrier to job opportunities. 
When older workers lose their jobs, 
they are far more likely than other 
workers to join the ranks of the long- 
term or permanent unemployed. 
Significantly, approximately 61 per-
cent of older workers have either seen 
or experienced age discrimination in 
the workplace. 
In 2018, the EEOC received nearly 
17,000 age discrimination complaints, 
accounting for more than 20 percent of 
all discrimination charges filed. While 
most older workers say they have seen 
or experienced age discrimination, only 
3 percent report having made a formal 
complaint. These trends have a pro-
found impact on the economic security 
of older workers and their families. 
This law has nothing to do with 
truckers and nothing to do with inde-
pendent contractors. This motion to 
recommit is a mockery of this impor-
tant legislation that is designed to pro-
tect older working Americans. 
I urge my colleagues to stand up for 
older workers and the protections that 
they need and deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), the chair-
man of the committee. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
this is, as my colleague has indicated, 
a distraction. This has nothing to do 
with truck drivers or the PRO Act. We 
are 
talking 
about 
discrimination 
against older workers. We are talking 
about victims of discrimination, not 
who gets to discriminate against them. 
We have a problem that older work-
ers are facing discrimination, and ev-
erybody knows it. National organiza-
tions representing senior citizens, ad-
vocacy groups, and civil rights groups, 
including the AARP, have all written 
letters asking us to protect workers 
against discrimination. 
We are correcting the Supreme Court 
case and the Gross decision, which 
makes it very difficult, if not impos-
sible, for older workers to prove their 
cases. We need to defeat this distrac-
tion and pass the bill to protect older 
workers against discrimination. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope we can defeat the 
motion and pass the bill. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
RECORDED VOTE 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I de-
mand a recorded vote. 
A recorded vote was ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5- 
minute vote on the motion to recom-
mit will be followed by a 5-minute vote 
on the passage of the bill, if ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—ayes 196, noes 220, 
not voting 13, as follows:

RESIGNATION AS MEMBER OF 
JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
PHILLIPS) laid before the House the fol-
lowing resignation as a member of the 
Joint Economic Committee: 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, January 8, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: I am writing to sub-
mit my formal resignation as Vice Chair of 
the Joint Economic Committee, effective im-
mediately. It has been an honor to serve in 
this position and I look forward to my new 
role as Chair of the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform. 
With my deepest appreciation, 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY, 
Member of Congress. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the resignation is accepted. 
There was no objection. 
f 
HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that when the 
House adjourns today, it adjourn to 
meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
f 
HONORING BRICK CITY LIONS 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a national champion 
from my district, the Brick City Lions. 
Brick City is the nickname of Newark, 
New Jersey, and the football team, the 
Brick City Lions, beat the Arizona Far 
West Jets 34–24 to win the 2019 Pop 
Warner Division I Junior Varsity na-
tional championship last month. 
Lions coach Nasir Gains should be 
very proud of the work of his team. He 
founded the Lions, also known as the 
Newark Youth Athletic Foundation, in 
2012. In that short time, his teams have 
succeeded at every level. 
But Coach Gains wants them to excel 
in the classroom as well. He provides 
reading and math tutors plus standard-
ized test classes to all his players. He 
wants to build teams with character, 
confidence, comradery, and brother-
hood. Clearly, he is succeeding on and 
off the field and deserves this recogni-
tion. 
Coach Gains and his teams represent 
the best of Newark, and they are a 
point of pride in our community. 
f 
HONORING HAROLD MEEK 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of 
Harold Meek, a community leader and 
devoted family man, who, sadly, passed 
away on December 24, 2019. 
To many of us, Harold was more than 
a neighbor. We considered him family, 
and his legacy will live on through 
those who knew him. 
Harold had a wonderful life with his 
wife, Kay, and recently celebrated 48 
years of marriage. He will be dearly 
missed by his loving wife, Kay; chil-
dren Mark, Joi, and Vivienne; and 
grandchildren Cody, Clint, Jordan, and 
Julia. 
Harold moved to Bakersfield in 1958 
to work with his brother, Leo, in what 
would be the beginning of a lifelong ca-
reer in the automotive industry. After 
17 years working at his brother’s deal-
ership, Harold joined Three-Way Chev-
rolet, which later became Three-Way 
Automotive Group, in 1973. 
Under Harold’s leadership, the Three- 
Way Automotive Group experienced 
years of prosperity, gaining national 
recognition and receiving multiple in-
dustry awards. 
Known as one of the greats among 
Bakersfield car dealers, Harold led 
Three-Way to various accolades, in-
cluding seven consecutive titles as the 
number one retail volume Chevrolet 
dealer in California, as well as being 
named the top retail Chevy dealer in 
the world in June and July of 2005. 
Harold was also recognized with the 
2003 Time Magazine Quality Dealer 
Award, a true testament to his com-
mitment to exceptional sales perform-
ance and customer service. 
This welcoming attitude extended to 
his personal life and philanthropic en-
deavors. He was involved in more than 
250 civic and charitable organizations, 
including the American Cancer Soci-
ety, the Bakersfield Women’s Business 
Conference, and Make-A-Wish Founda-
tion, just to name a few. 
A dedicated Republican, Harold was 
also active in local, State, and national 
politics. He served on the steering com-
mittee of numerous Gubernatorial and 
Presidential campaigns in California 
and managed campaigns for city coun-
cil, county supervisor, and State as-
sembly candidates. 
After retiring, Harold enjoyed cheer-
ing on his Oklahoma Sooner football 
team, Friday night dinners with his 
close-knit family, afternoons with his 
granddaughter, and watching NASCAR 
races on television with his son. 
Harold truly embodied what it means 
to be a community leader and, above 
all, a family man. On behalf of Califor-
nia’s 23rd Congressional District, Judy 
and I extend our deepest condolences to 
the Meek family, and we join them in 
honoring the life of Harold Meek. 
f 
KEEPING ROE V. WADE THE LAW 
OF THE LAND 
(Ms. PINGREE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, on Janu-
ary 22, 1973, the Supreme Court ruled, 
7–2, that women have the right to 
make their own healthcare decisions 
and to legally access abortion care. 
Forty-seven years later, our country 
has seen significant social and eco-
nomic progress since Roe v. Wade. 
Seventy-three percent of Americans 
support keeping Roe v. Wade the law of 
the land. They agree we can’t go back. 
And yet, nearly 50 years after Roe be-
came settled law, abortion is still 
under attack by extreme politicians 
who believe the government should dic-
tate whether and when to have a child. 
From 2011 to 2018, States across our 
country enacted 424 separate restric-
tions on abortion. In 2016, Donald 
Trump campaigned on a promise of ap-
pointing Justices who will overturn 
Roe v. Wade, and he has appointed 
more than one-quarter of all active 
judges to date. 
His administration has pushed a do-
mestic gag rule to prohibit doctors 
from telling women about their legal 
right to access abortion and slashed ac-
cess to family planning funding in the 
process. 
As we honor the anniversary of Roe 
v. Wade, we must expand abortion ac-
cess for women across the country and 
stand up to the senseless attacks on 
women’s health. 
f 
ADDRESSING THE TRAGEDY OF 
OUR NATIONAL DEBT 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to address the 
tragedy of our national debt. 
Out-of-control spending is the single 
greatest nonviolent threat to our Na-
tion. This year alone, the Federal def-
icit increase exceeded $1 trillion. 
Just to give some perspective, a tril-
lion $1 bills stacked from the ground 
would reach 60,000 miles into space. 
The International Space Station is 
only at 200 miles. This stack would 
reach one-quarter of the distance to 
the Moon.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H275 
January 15, 2020 
The current debt is at $23 trillion, 
which amounts to $70,000 per American. 
It continues to compound year after 
year after year without any relief in 
sight. 
It is estimated that the national debt 
will rise to 93 percent of GDP in the 
next 10 years. That means that for 
every $100 that this Nation makes, $93 
would have to go toward servicing our 
debt. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a national trag-
edy. We are bankrupting our children 
and our children’s children’s future. We 
must stop this impending disaster. I 
urge my colleagues and associates to 
help us address real solutions. 
f 
TEXAS 
HAS 
HISTORICALLY 
LED 
NATION IN REFUGEE RESETTLE-
MENT 
(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to take a stand against Governor 
Abbott of Texas and his decision to end 
our refugee resettlement in my home 
State of Texas. This decision is going 
to welcome xenophobia and bigotry and 
is contrary to the values that we hold 
dear in Texas. 
Texas, as some of you may or may 
not know, has historically led our Na-
tion in refugee resettlement. Our State 
has always opened its doors to people 
in need and welcomed refugees with 
open arms to provide an opportunity 
for refugees to contribute to the gen-
eral common good of all Texans. 
Texas has now become the first 
State—I say that with shame—to bar 
resettlement of those fleeing violence 
and religious persecution. This isn’t 
what we stand for in Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the Governor to 
look at Tarrant County, which is the 
county that I live in, and the decision 
that they made to continue taking ref-
ugees. 
As of today, the courts have stayed 
this heinous order. This decision still 
sets a dangerous precedent. 
I urge him to reverse his decision and 
show the rest of the Nation that Texas 
stands for inclusion, and let these 
churches—evangelical churches, liberal 
churches, 
Black 
churches, 
White 
churches—work together on these ref-
ugee programs. Let’s let them continue 
to work together for the greater good 
of the country.

b 1715 
IRAN PROTESTERS 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, the people 
of Iran are protesting the current Ira-
nian regime that has for decades sup-
pressed the Iranian people and denied 
them the freedoms that we as Ameri-
cans hold near and dear. The Iranian 
people are protesting to hold the Ira-
nian Government responsible for the 
history of brutality against its own 
citizens and the world. 
They are marching in the streets for 
the 1,500 Iranians killed by the Islamic 
Revolutionary Guard in December of 
2019. They are marching in the streets 
for the deaths of 82 Iranians, 63 Cana-
dians, 20 Ukrainians, 4 Afghans, 4 Brit-
ons, and 3 Germans when the Iranian 
military destroyed the passenger plane 
upon which they were flying. They are 
marching in the streets against years 
of brutality at the hands of the Su-
preme Leader and the terrorist Iranian 
Revolutionary Guard. 
Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, these 
people are marching for their freedom 
and the future of their country. 
President Ronald Reagan in his fare-
well address to our Nation described 
our country as a bright, shining city on 
a hill that served as a beacon for free-
dom-loving people everywhere. As that 
beacon, we must stand with the pro-
testers who seek freedom from this 
brutal regime. 
f 
HEALTHCARE 
(Ms. WEXTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. WEXTON. Mr. Speaker, before 
coming to Congress, I served for 5 years 
in the Virginia General Assembly, and 
the proudest vote I ever took in Rich-
mond was to pass Medicaid expansion 
in Virginia. 
Today, as a result of that expansion, 
more than 375,000 Virginians now have 
coverage under Medicaid. It has been a 
win-win 
for 
everyone 
involved—for 
those who would otherwise go uncov-
ered 
and 
for 
the 
hospitals 
and 
healthcare providers who often provide 
service to the uninsured without com-
pensation. A recent study has even sug-
gested that Medicaid expansion has 
saved thousands from opioid overdoses. 
Medicaid expansion saves lives, and 
the success we have seen in Virginia is 
thanks to the Affordable Care Act. 
Americans need to know that while 
my colleagues and I are fighting to pro-
tect and strengthen the ACA, Donald 
Trump and the congressional Repub-
licans are in court right now working 
to strike down the ACA with no plan or 
replacement. 
Without the ACA, Medicaid expan-
sion, which covers 17 million Ameri-
cans, is in jeopardy, and so is coverage 
for more than 130 million Americans 
with preexisting conditions. With so 
much at stake, I urge my Republican 
colleagues to end their attacks. In the 
meantime I will continue to fight back. 
f 
KERRY MCCOY PRESERVE 
ARKANSAS AWARD 
(Mr. HILL of Arkansas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Ms. Kerry 
McCoy who is being honored with the 
2019 
Special 
Recognition 
for 
Out-
standing Stewardship from Preserve 
Arkansas. 
In 1975 Kerry founded her successful 
business, Arkansas Flag and Banner, 
with $400 in savings, and to start she 
sold flags door to door. 
In 1990 she expanded the business by 
purchasing the famed, yet neglected, 
historic Taborian Hall in Little Rock, 
Arkansas. Built in 1916, Taborian Hall 
once hosted legendary entertainers 
like Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, 
B.B. King, and Etta James. 
Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, 
Kerry slowly and meticulously ren-
ovated Taborian Hall. In 2009 she 
founded the nonprofit Friends of the 
Dreamland Ballroom to save and pro-
tect the space that had once been the 
centerpiece of the hall. Kerry has since 
produced a documentary and published 
a book about the building. And I was 
proud to support her grant for a Civil 
Rights Preservation Grant from the 
National Park Service in 2018. 
I applaud Kerry for the efforts to pre-
serve Taborian Hall and the Dreamland 
Ballroom, and I congratulate her on 
this special recognition from Preserve 
Arkansas. 
f 
CONGRATULATING THE NDSU 
BISON 
(Mr. ARMSTRONG asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. 
ARMSTRONG. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
today I rise to congratulate the NDSU 
Bison football team for winning the 
FCS National Championship. 
On January 11, NDSU defeated James 
Madison University 28–20 in a thrilling 
game that came down to the final sec-
onds. Bison quarterback Trey Lance 
racked up 166 yards on the ground dur-
ing the game and finished the season 
with 28 touchdowns and zero intercep-
tions. He is the first freshman ever to 
win the Walter Payton Player of the 
Year Award and the Jerry Rice Na-
tional Freshman of the Year Award. 
Bison safety James Hendricks inter-
cepted a pass on the goal line to ice the 
game and ensure another Bison Na-
tional Championship. 
They finished the season 16–0, the 
first NCAA team to do so since Yale in 
1884. During this unprecedented run, 
NDSU has won eight championships in 
9 years and compiled a record of 128–8. 
They have lost only eight games in 9 
years, and they have defeated five FBS 
schools along the way, two of which 
were ranked at the time they played 
NDSU. 
Congratulations 
to 
the 
players, 
coaches, and fans of the most dominant 
college football program in this coun-
try. 
And a special happy birthday to 
Bison fan Jessica Unruh.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to celebrate the life of Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. 
Dr. King lived a life dedicated to 
serving and being a voice for the op-
pressed across our Nation. His message 
of nonviolence resonated with many 
Americans during a tumultuous period 
of our history when basic civil rights 
were being denied to many based on 
the color of their skin. 
Drawing inspiration from his Chris-
tian faith, Dr. King believed his pro-
tests were the strongest weapon to 
achieve freedom and equality. In the 
end he paid the ultimate price, choos-
ing courage over fear to overcome ha-
tred and ignorance. 
He famously preached: ‘‘Darkness 
cannot drive out darkness; only light 
can do that. Hate cannot drive out 
hate; only love can do that.’’ 
Because of Dr. King’s influence, all 
Americans can gather together to cele-
brate diversity and the growth of 
human rights for each of us. I hope 
that everyone will join me in com-
memorating and remembering Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, Jr., for his leadership, 
his sacrifices, and his legacy.

because of Roe v. Wade, we are killing 
a baby a minute. 
Mr. Speaker, another baby just lost

JOHN WALCZAK’S RETIREMENT 
FROM FAA 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, today 
I 
would 
like 
to 
recognize 
John 
Walczak. He is retiring after an impres-
sive 37 years and 2 months at the FAA. 
He started working at the FAA in 1982 
as a student through Stockton State 
College now called Stockton Univer-
sity. 
He 
learned 
three 
computer 
lan-
guages: Ultra, JOVIAL, and Basic As-
sembly Language. He started working 
full-time in 1984 as a computer pro-
grammer and worked his way up the 
ranks over the years to become STARS 
DT&E Test Director, which eventually 
would become IDQT Test Director. He 
was also the application lead for re-
quirements. John retired on January 3, 
2020. 
I thank John, his community thanks 
him, and his country thanks him for 
his service. Our world is safer because 
of John and the work that he has done. 
We are so unbelievably proud of your 
accomplishments, John. Congratula-
tions, and may God bless you. 
f 
CONGRESSIONAL PROGRESSIVE 
CAUCUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I am very 
proud to represent the Congressional 
Progressive Caucus where we have 
close to 100 members all across the 
country that are pushing forward our 
progressive values that I think are ex-
tremely important, especially in a dis-
trict like mine, frontline communities 
and many communities of color that 
are suffering from issues around pov-
erty, jobs, environment, education, dis-
investment, and so forth. So I am very 
honored to be representing our caucus 
today with the Special Order. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from New Jersey (Mrs. WATSON 
COLEMAN), who is my good colleague 
from New Jersey. 
Mrs. 
WATSON 
COLEMAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the gentle-
woman for yielding. 
I rise in support of the resolutions 
presented by my friends from Cali-
fornia, Congresswoman LEE and Con-
gressman KHANNA. They are long over-
due. 
The actions of this President over 
the last few weeks are an escalation of 
the reckless, arrogant, and ignorant 
foreign policy of this White House, if 
you can even call these hasty decisions 
a policy. The President’s actions lack a 
coherent strategy. He lacks an under-
standing of history, and he lacks the 
foresight to see the consequences of his 
actions. 
Last week, the House and the Senate 
received briefings that failed to answer 
our questions about the basic facts be-
hind the decision to kill Major General 
Qasem Soleimani. Republican Senators 
themselves said the briefing was so 
poorly presented that they left more 
opposed to the President’s actions than 
before they were briefed. 
In other words, the more we learn 
about this debacle, the less faith any-
one has in the White House’s ability to 
make these decisions. 
Some of the questions asked by Mem-
bers of Congress in that briefing went 
unanswered for so-called security rea-
sons. Yet they were later addressed in 
interviews and press conferences by 
members of the administration as they 
tried to cover for the President’s lies 
and obfuscations. 
That is why I will join Democrats, 
and hopefully any Member of the House 
unwilling to watch us enter another 
endless war, in voting for these bills to 
limit the President’s ability to engage 
in further aggression with Iran and 
keep American troops out of harm’s 
way. 
The President has spent the days 
since his ill-advised attack blustering 
to reporters and on twitter, including 
threatening to attack cultural sites, a 
war crime of which the only outcome 
would be maiming and killing civil-
ians. 
Just last week he ticked off a list of 
Iranian aggressions that he claimed 
were the result of the Iran deal. In fact, 
each event he cited occurred only after 
his foolish decision to pull out of the 
deal. These resolutions are critical to 
curtailing any further misguided ac-
tion by President Trump. 
The fact is, this action that he has 
taken makes Americans less safe. It 
threatens our diplomats abroad with 
retribution, it threatens our military 
personnel in the region, and it threat-
ens Americans working in the region. 
Many, 
many 
years 
ago, 
Senator 
George McGovern said: ‘‘I am fed up to 
the ears with old men dreaming up 
wars for young men to die in.’’ Well, I 
am fed up too, and so are the American 
people. 
Reports 
suggest 
the 
President 
thought this move would be celebrated 
by Americans. But I speak for myself 
and the hundreds of constituents who 
have messaged me when I say: No 
more, Mr. Trump. We don’t want this 
war. We don’t want war with Iran. No 
continuing 
escalation, 
no 
more 
killings, and no more sending our 
daughters and sons into harm’s way to 
appease the fragile egos of the men in 
the White House. 
I call on all my colleagues to support 
the resolutions of my colleagues, Ms. 
LEE and Mr. KHANNA. 
And I send a clear message to the 
White House: Your days of reckless 
misadventures with the lives of Ameri-
cans are over.

Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE), my colleague and good 
friend. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for organizing this 
Special Order on this really important 
topic. 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, we held a 
hearing in the House Committee on 
Foreign Affairs on the administration’s 
actions in Iran. Over the past few 
weeks, the United States and Iran have 
come closer to outright war than any 
time in our history. However, despite 
the seriousness of the situation, Sec-
retary of State Mike Pompeo refused 
to appear. 
The Framers of the Constitution 
gave the power to declare war solely to 
the Congress of the United States, the 
elected representatives of the people. 
The reason they did that is they want-
ed to prevent a President from making 
the decision to take the country to war 
without the support of the American 
people. 
As we think about the President’s de-
cision, the only lens through which we

January 15, 2020 
should view it is whether or not those 
actions made Americans safer and 
strengthened America’s national secu-
rity interests in the region and around 
the world. 
The fact that Soleimani got what he 
deserved does not mean that this deci-
sion was strategically wise or that it 
enhanced American security. 
I, frankly, have been shocked by 
some of the arguments being put forth 
by my colleagues in support of the 
President’s actions and the criticism 
being directed at Members of Congress 
for taking our war powers responsi-
bility seriously. 
Have we become so completely par-
tisan that Members of Congress no 
longer care at all about the checks and 
balances put in place to protect our de-
mocracy? I heard Members on the 
other side describe the idea of even 
holding a hearing on the administra-
tion’s actions against Iran as absurd. 
The idea that we, as Congress, would 
sit back and allow this administration 
or any administration to take our 
country to the brink of war and just 
trust them, despite conflicting expla-
nations, obvious falsehoods, and a com-
plete lack of strategy and planning, is 
what is absurd. 
What is absurd is the Secretary of 
State spending nearly 2 years agitating 
for armed conflict with Iran and then 
refusing to come to explain himself 
after he succeeds in convincing the 
President to engage in military action. 
If you are Secretary of State while 
the country enters into a tense mili-
tary conflict, you should expect to 
clear your schedule and get up to Con-
gress to make your case. Yet, the Sec-
retary had somewhere more important 
to be yesterday. 
That is a shocking abrogation of his 
duty to report to this body, which has 
the sole power to declare war on behalf 
of the American people. 
One would think that if the Sec-
retary was so confident in his intel-
ligence, so confident in his justifica-
tion, and so confident in his strategy 
that he would be eager to present it 
and defend it to Congress. 
We know he has been making the 
rounds on television, yet he fails to ap-
pear under oath where he can be held 
accountable. Perhaps that has some-
thing to do with the conflicting stories 
that have been coming out of the ad-
ministration 
concerning 
their 
jus-
tification for the strike against Qasem 
Soleimani. 
First, we were told that there was an 
imminent threat against the United 
States, but Secretary Pompeo couldn’t 
say when or where that attack might 
occur and presented no underlying or 
raw intelligence to support that con-
clusion. 
Then, the President said Soleimani 
was plotting to attack up to four 
American Embassies in the region. Yet, 
this was not mentioned in briefings to 
Congress, and other senior officials in 
the administration were unaware of 
such a plot. 
Other 
officials 
have 
linked 
the 
Soleimani killing to past and future 
attacks Soleimani might have been 
plotting with no specificity, while oth-
ers have reported that the killing was 
first planned as long as 7 months ago. 
The conflicting explanations coming 
out of this administration, combined 
with their unwillingness to share de-
tails with Congress or the American 
people, leave us no choice but to con-
clude that the President acted outside 
of the authority under the War Powers 
Resolution and took unilateral mili-
tary action against a senior govern-
ment official without proper authoriza-
tion. 
I have heard others make the argu-
ment 
that 
none 
of 
this 
matters. 
Soleimani is a bad guy and got what he 
deserved. The Iranians have backed off 
so it is all fine. 
That is today. What about the next 
time? When an administration believes 
it can launch a military strike that 
might lead to war with no information- 
sharing, no legal justification, and no 
oversight, who knows what they will do 
next. 
Nearly every step taken over the past 
2 years by President Trump and Sec-
retary Pompeo has seemed designed to 
create conflict with Iran by asserting 
maximum pressure. Without any op-
tion or plan for a negotiated solution, 
armed conflict became more and more 
likely. 
There is no evidence that we are 
safer today than we were before the 
killing of Soleimani. In fact, we know 
we are less safe. 
We have stopped the training of 
Iraqis in the fight against ISIS. There 
are more American troops that have 
been sent to the region. We have now 
suffered two attacks on bases that 
house American and allied forces. This 
notion that we are safer today is sim-
ply belied by the facts. 
So we are here today, and it doesn’t 
appear that the administration has any 
strategy or plan for next steps, other 
than the farfetched wish that Iran will 
be so cowed in the face of their bluster 
that it will agree to all of their de-
mands. 
That 
seems 
unlikely 
and 
doesn’t represent any thoughtful or co-
herent planning. 
Forgive me if I don’t want to repeat 
the mistakes of the past and put my 
trust in officials when they march us 
to war and claim: ‘‘Trust us. This is 
necessary.’’ 
I will not be responsible for sending 
the men and women of Rhode Island— 
or any other State, for that matter— 
into harm’s way so that the President 
can feel like a big shot and his advisers 
can finally achieve the war they seem 
to have been building toward since he 
took office. 
I am disgusted by the Secretary’s ab-
sence yesterday. He should appear be-
fore the committee as soon as possible, 
and that means within days, to explain 
himself, the administration’s position, 
and their plan for preventing Iran from 
obtaining a nuclear weapon and pro-
moting America’s national security 
and keeping America safe. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding me time. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
SCHAKOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman TLAIB for lead-
ing this conversation today. I am see-
ing some of my colleagues on the floor 
today who remember the story that I 
want to tell. 
This was the fall of 2002, and there 
was a vigorous debate going on wheth-
er or not we should be sending our 
troops to declare war on Iraq and take 
out Saddam Hussein. The story went 
that there were weapons of mass de-
struction. 
Yes, we had briefings. They were in 
the north. They were in the south, the 
west, and the east. They were there all 
right, we were told. 
A vote was going to come up on the 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force, AUMF, in Iraq. There was one 
voice in particular that stood out and 
still stands out to me, a woman who 
was the ranking Democrat on the In-
telligence Committee. Her name was 
NANCY PELOSI. She stood up at our 
meetings and said, no, there is no intel-
ligence to justify that we go to war in 
Iraq. 
A group of us got together. I see Con-
gresswoman BARBARA
LEE, the only 
Member who, because we were already 
in Afghanistan, voted against that war, 
who put together a group called the 
Out of Iraq Caucus. We went door-to- 
door, literally, and asked our Demo-
cratic friends in the House to say no to 
this war because it was not necessary. 
At the end of the day, even though 
the press story had already been writ-
ten that somehow it was almost a 
unanimous vote, 60 percent of the 
Democrats in the House of Representa-
tives voted against that war in Iraq. 
That was over 17 years ago. We still 
have troops in Iraq. We spent trillions, 
literally trillions of dollars, and the 
loss of life on all sides, including our 
precious American soldiers that we 
sent—most Americans today agree that 
that war was a disaster and that we 
shouldn’t have done it. We learned a 
lesson. 
When it came time to talk about the 
threat that we knew was there, the nu-
clear weapons program in Iran, we 
worked with President Barack Obama 
in a diplomatic way to pass the Iran 
agreement that actually stopped Iran 
from developing nuclear weapons that 
would threaten not only the United 
States and the region but the rest of 
the world. And it was working. There 
were inspectors that would report to 
us. Every month, we got a report that 
said it was working. 
Along comes Donald Trump, who had 
said even in the campaign that this is 
a really bad idea, that this is a terrible 
agreement. Lo and behold, just a few 
weeks ago, he decided—it seems like a 
long time. Not long ago, he decides, all

of a sudden, that it is a really impor-
tant thing for us to go after Iran while 
Soleimani, the general, who is part of 
the government, is in Iraq. 
No one is crying over the death of 
Soleimani. The question is: Is the 
United States safer now than it was? 
The answer is a resounding no. 
That is why I am in strong support of 
the legislation by BARBARA LEE that 
says we will sunset that 2002 Author-
ization for Use of Military Force in 
Iraq and the legislation by RO KHANNA 
that will prohibit the use of Federal 
funds for military action in or against 
Iran unless Congress specifically au-
thorizes it or declares war or such ac-
tions are undertaken consistent with 
the War Powers Resolution of 1973. 
In other words, come to Congress. 
That is who we are. That is our job. We 
are the ones who are supposed to say 
war or peace. The most important 
thing we could do is decide whether we 
send our young men and women into 
harm’s way to sacrifice their lives. 
We have to exert our authority. We 
have to exert our authority right now. 
I stand in support of that legislation. 
We don’t need, and the American peo-
ple don’t want, another endless war in 
Iran or anywhere in the Middle East. It 
is time to say no, to say that Congress 
is going to make those decisions, and 
to do it now. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
my colleague from California (Ms. 
LEE), my mentor. The original squad 
member is what I like to call her. I so 
appreciate the leadership role that she 
plays in the Congressional Progressive 
Caucus, especially in trying to suspend 
and stop all war efforts by our country. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
first, I thank my colleague, who is a 
bold and brilliant progressive here, 
Congresswoman 
RASHIDA
TLAIB. 
I 
thank her for organizing this Special 
Order tonight, but I also thank her for 
her leadership and for hitting the 
ground running in the House of Rep-
resentatives. It has been quite remark-
able to work with her and to see how 
she understands the issues around 
peace and justice, that peace and jus-
tice go together. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman 
SCHAKOWSKY for her speech tonight and 
for her presentation, for laying out the 
chronology and historical record for 
how we got here and how we, unfortu-
nately, were misled by the lies of the 
Bush administration into this tragic, 
endless war. I thank her very much for 
her leadership, for her friendship, and 
for staying the course because this has 
been, what, 19 years now? We have to 
repeal this authorization. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just say to Rep-
resentatives 
PRAMILA
JAYAPAL
and 
MARK POCAN, who co-chair our Progres-
sive Caucus, their tireless leadership in 
the Progressive Caucus has really 
helped with making sure that the pub-
lic understands all the issues that we 
are dealing with as it relates to global 
peace and security. 
I chair the Progressive Caucus’ Glob-
al Peace and Security Task Force, and 
we are very clear on why we must stop 
a possible catastrophic war with Iran 
and reassert our constitutional duty 
over matters of war and peace. 
Mr. Speaker, I invite all of my col-
leagues and the rest of the CPC to sup-
port the repeal of the 2001 and 2002 Au-
thorizations for Use of Military Force. 
I am pleased that the House leadership 
has agreed to bring my repeal of the 
2002 AUMF to the floor in 2 weeks, and 
I encourage Members on both sides of 
the aisle to cosponsor that legislation. 
First, with regard to the 2001 author-
ization, 19 years ago, Congress passed a 
2001 Authorization for Use of Military 
Force, 
AUMF. 
It 
was 
supposedly 
against Afghanistan, as it relates to 
the horrific events of 9/11. 
b 1745 
It was a blank check, however, for 
endless war. It was a 60-word authoriza-
tion. It was totally open-ended. 
Now we have a Congress where—or at 
least the House—less than 25 percent of 
current Members actually voted on 
that authorization, which, of course, I 
adamantly opposed. 
This authorization gives any Presi-
dent authority to wage limitless war at 
any time, anywhere, for any reason, in 
perpetuity. According to the Congres-
sional Research Service, the AUMF has 
been used as a blank check by three ad-
ministrations to justify military force 
more than 40 times in 18 countries. 
Mr. Speaker, I include the CRS re-
port in the RECORD.

MEMORANDUM 
Subject: Presidential References to the 2001 
Authorization for Use of Military Force 
in Publicly Available Executive Actions 
and Reports to Congress. 
From: Matthew Weed, Specialist in Foreign 
Policy Legislation, 7–4589. 
This memorandum was prepared to enable 
distribution to more than one congressional 
office. 
This memorandum sets out information 
and analysis concerning presidential ref-
erences in public official notifications and 
records to the Authorization for Use of Mili-
tary Force (2001 AUMF; Public Law 107–40; 50 
U.S.C. § 1541 note), enacted in response to the 
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the 
United States, in relation to military and 
other action. It contains very brief discus-
sions of the relevant provisions of the 2001 
AUMF, and the uses of U.S. armed forces 
connected with 2001 AUMF authority, as well 
as excerpted language and other information 
from the notifications. 
USE OF MILITARY FORCE AUTHORIZATION 
LANGUAGE IN THE 2001 AUMF 
Section 2(a) of the 2001 AUMF authorizes 
the use of force in response to the September 
11 attacks: 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED 
STATES ARMED FORCES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—That the President is au-
thorized to use all necessary and appropriate 
force against those nations, organizations, or 
persons he determines planned, authorized, 
committed, or aided the terrorist attacks 
that occurred on September 11, 2001, or har-
bored such organizations or persons, in order 
to prevent any future acts of international 
terrorism against the United States by such 
nations, organizations or persons. 
The 2001 AUMF does not include a specified 
congressional reporting requirement, but 
states that the authorization is not intended 
to supersede any requirement of the War 
Powers Resolution, which does require con-
gressional reporting for initial and con-
tinuing deployments of U.S. armed forces 
into imminent or ongoing hostilities. 
EXECUTIVE BRANCH POLICY CONCERNING 
UTILIZATION OF 2001 AUMF AUTHORIZATION 
Prior to the U.S. military campaign 
against the Islamic State that began in sum-
mer 2014, executive branch officials made 
statements that included certain interpreta-
tions concerning the 2001 AUMF, including 
the following: 
The 2001 AUMF is primarily an authoriza-
tion to enter into and prosecute an armed 
conflict against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in 
Afghanistan. 
The 2001 AUMF authorizes the President to 
use military force against Al Qaeda and the 
Taliban outside Afghanistan, but such uses 
of force must meet a higher standard of 
threat to the United States and must use 
limited, precise methods against specific in-
dividual targets rather than general military 
action against enemy forces. 
Because the 2001 AUMF authorizes U.S. in-
volvement in an international armed con-
flict, the international law of armed conflict 
informs the authority within the 2001 AUMF. 
This law permits the use of military force 
against forces associated with Al Qaeda and 
the Taliban as co-belligerents; such forces 
must be operating in some sort of coordina-
tion and cooperation with Al Qaeda and/or 
the Taliban, not just share similar goals, ob-
jectives, or ideologies. 
This interpretation of the scope of 2001 
AUMF authority can be seen to fit within 
the overall framework of presidential power 
to use military force against those posing a 
threat to U.S. national security and U.S. in-
terests. In situations where the 2001 AUMF 
or other relevant legislation does not seem 
to authorize a given use of military force or 
related activity, the executive branch will 
determine whether the President’s Article II 
powers as Commander in Chief and Chief Ex-
ecutive, as interpreted by the executive 
branch itself, might authorize such actions. 
In this way, similar U.S. military action to 
meet U.S. counterterrorism objectives might 
be interpreted to fall under different au-
thorities, of which the 2001 AUMF is just 
one, albeit important, example. 
DECEMBER 2016 LEGAL FRAMEWORK REPORT ON 
USE OF MILITARY FORCE 
President Obama issued a report in Decem-
ber 2016 entitled, ‘‘Report on the Legal and 
Policy Frameworks Guiding the United 
States’ Use of Military Force, and Related 
National Security Operations.’’ Among other 
matters, the Report deals with the legal jus-
tification for the United States’ ongoing use 
of military force against the Islamic State, 
which according to the Report has taken 
place in the form of airstrikes, military ad-
vising and training of Iraqi security forces 
and Syrian rebel groups, and military activi-
ties of U.S. special operations forces in Iraq, 
Syria, and Libya. The Report asserts that 
such use of force is authorized by the 2001 
AUMF, arguing certain factors as determina-
tive: 
1. The 2001 AUMF authorizes the President 
to use military force ‘‘in order to prevent 
any future acts of international terrorism 
against the United States by such nations, 
organizations, or persons’’ who perpetrated 
or harbored those who perpetrated the Sep-
tember 11, 2001 terror attacks against the 
United States.

2. Al Qaeda was identified as the primary 
organization responsible for the September 
11, 2001 attacks. 
3. Organized, armed groups that are co-bel-
ligerent with Al Qaeda against the United 
States are targetable under the 2001 AUMF 
pursuant to the law of international armed 
conflicts as ‘‘associated forces.’’ 
4. With specific regard to the Islamic 
State, the United States determined in 2004 
that Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), the predecessor 
organization of the Islamic State, was either 
part of Al Qaeda itself or an associated force 
in 2004 and has used force against the group 
under 2001 AUMF authority since that time, 
including after AQI changed its name to the 
Islamic State (or ISIL or ISIS). 
5. The fact that the Islamic State has as-
serted a split between itself and Al Qaeda 
does not divest the President of his previous 
authority to use force against the Islamic 
State, as the Islamic State’s conflict with 
the United States and its allies has contin-
ued. 
6. Congress has supported military action 
against the Islamic State by specifically 
funding the military campaign and providing 
authority to assist groups fighting the Is-
lamic State in Iraq and Syria.

REF-
ERENCING THE 2001 AUMF 
Since 2001, Presidents George W. Bush, 
Barack Obama, and Donald Trump have ref-
erenced in public notifications the 2001 
AUMF in connection with initiating or con-
tinuing certain military or related actions 
(including 
non-lethal 
military 
activities 
such as detentions and military trials), as 
U.S. armed forces continue to counter Al 
Qaeda, the Taliban, and violent extremist 
and terrorist groups designated as associated 
with those two organizations. The notifica-
tions reference both statutory and constitu-
tional authority for the President to take 
such action, as well as statutory provisions 
requiring congressional notification, includ-
ing reference to provisions in the 2001 AUMF. 
As will be discussed in detail below, the man-
ner in which Presidents have presented infor-
mation on military deployments and actions 
in these notifications, the constitutional and 
statutory authority for such actions, and the 
reporting requirements for such actions, 
have changed over time, making it difficult 
to aggregate such information.

IN-
VOLVING REFERENCE TO THE 2001 AUMF 
Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump have 
provided formal notifications of military de-
ployments and/or action to Congress at var-
ious times since enactment of the 2001 
AUMF, referring to that authorization to 
various degrees and ends. While presidential 
reports to Congress concerning the use of 
military force and other activities under-
taken by the U.S. armed forces initially pro-
vided a fairly simple and straightforward 
discussion of actions and related authorities, 
over time these reports became increasingly 
detailed, complicated, and difficult to deci-
pher with regard to determining applicable 
presidential authority. At all times, both 
Presidents have relied primarily on their 
constitutional Article II powers as Com-
mander in Chief and Chief Executive. In 
many instances, reference to 2001 AUMF au-
thority has been supplementary and indirect; 
in only a few cases has a President relied di-
rectly on 2001 AUMF authority as justifica-
tion for a military operation, deployment, or 
other action. 
Below are provided several tables of infor-
mation concerning presidential notifications 
and records of other executive action ref-
erencing the 2001 AUMF. Each table pro-
vides: 
a date of each notification or record; 
the relevant military activity, location, 
and/or purpose of such activities, as avail-
able; 
the constitutional and statutory authority 
provided in the notification or record as pro-
vided; and 
the reference to applicable reporting re-
quirements precipitating each respective no-
tification or record. 
For Tables 1–8, each set out in its own sec-
tion with accompanying analysis, each table 
includes a group of notifications that are 
similar in composition and content. Each 
subsequent table and section, therefore, de-
notes a change in composition of the notifi-
cations referencing the 2001 AUMF in some 
way. 
INITIAL REPORTING IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE 
SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 ATTACKS 
President Bush’s reports to Congress con-
cerning military deployments in the weeks 
following the September 11, 2001 terror at-
tacks were relatively concise, focusing on 
the need to address the terrorist threat in 
the immediate aftermath of the attacks, and 
the deployments and actions taken in re-
sponse to such threat. The first notification 
on September 24, 2001 references deployments 
to ‘‘a number of foreign nations’’ in the 
‘‘Central and Pacific Command areas of oper-
ations.’’ Major military operations in Af-
ghanistan had not yet commenced. The sec-
ond notification on October 9, 2001 includes 
similar information but also notifies Con-
gress of the commencement of combat 
against Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghani-
stan. In these two notifications, President 
Bush stated that he had taken the actions 
described pursuant to his constitutional au-
thority as Commander in Chief and Chief Ex-
ecutive. In both notifications, he referred to 
the 2001 AUMF as evidencing the continuing 
support of Congress, but did not specifically 
state he had taken such action pursuant to 
2001 AUMF authority. The President stated 
in these notifications that he was reporting 
on these actions to Congress consistent with 
both the War Powers Resolution and the 2001 
AUMF. It is possible to conclude that report-
ing action consistent with the 2001 AUMF 
would mean that the action was considered 
taken pursuant to 2001 AUMF authority. See 
Table 1 below for more information and pre-
cise language related to 2001 AUMF ref-
erences in these notifications. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
hope you look at this map, and you 
will see exactly where the 2001 author-
ization has been used for military 
strikes and force. 
Two decades later, as outlined in the 
Afghanistan Papers, which I hope the 
Speaker has read, published in The 
Washington Post, I believe this was in 
December, the false justifications and 
inconsistencies led to a 19-year, endless 
war—Washington 
Post, 
Afghanistan 
Papers. 
The Pentagon consistently misled 
and lied to the American people about 
our progress in Afghanistan. This end-
less war has caused countless deaths of 
servicemembers, innocent civilians. It 
has cost trillions of dollars. It has cre-
ated repercussions throughout the re-
gion and the world. 
It is truly concerning, and I urge my 
colleagues to read through the details 
of this report. Our own generals and 
ambassadors did not know then, and 
still do not know what our strategy 
was or why we are still involved in this 
war. 
We must ask ourselves: Why are we 
putting 
our 
servicemembers 
into 
harm’s way? 
Why are innocent civilians’ lives in 
flux? 
Why are we making our country less 
safe? 
But it wasn’t just in 2001 when we 
passed an open-ended authorization. 
Next, in 2002, I stood here with my col-
leagues to urge us not to rush to war in 
Iraq based on false intelligence, most-
ly, weapons of mass destruction, and to 
vote against the 2002 AUMF. 
I offered then an amendment to this 
authorization that would have pre-
vented this war by requiring that the 
inspectors go to verify that there were 
weapons of mass destruction before 
military action. That seemed reason-
able. At least we should have had the 
data and the information to justify the 
use of force. 
But, of course, my amendment only 
received, I believe it was, 72 votes. 
Shame on us. 
But if it had passed, it would have ex-
posed the lie that the war was based 
on. There were no weapons of mass de-
struction in Iraq. 
So it is time to repeal that outdated 
authorization. And as I stand here, as I 
have stood here so many times to say, 
the American people do not want an-
other catastrophic war of choice in the 
Middle East. 
Make no mistake: The dangerous and 
reckless actions taken by President 
Trump have brought us to the brink of 
an all-out war with Iran. Since day 
one, Trump and his warmongering ad-
ministration have inched us closer to 
war with Iran. They have completely 
neglected diplomacy at every turn. 
Secretary Pompeo is the Secretary of 
State and should be our chief diplomat. 
Instead, we see our chief diplomat pro-
moting the use of force in the Middle 
East. 
Ending the effective and successful 
Iran 
nuclear 
deal, 
known 
as 
the 
JCPOA, once again, this administra-
tion has made us less safe and has al-
lowed Iran to move forward to begin to 
look at how to develop a nuclear weap-
on. That is outrageous, when we had 
verified the fact that they had stopped 
this. 
We have also, unfortunately, in-
creased troop presence in the Middle 
East and promoted a dangerous and 
maximum pressure campaign with Iran 
and increasing economic sanctions. 
This administration is giving Mem-
bers of Congress and the American peo-
ple conflicting and contradictory infor-
mation. We were told the President au-
thorized the assassination of General 
Soleimani 
due 
to 
an 
‘‘imminent 
threat,’’ as permitted by the War Pow-
ers Act. 
Now 
Secretary 
of 
Defense 
Mark 
Esper is saying that he has seen no evi-
dence of an ‘‘imminent threat’’ and 
conducted the strike for ‘‘deterrence.’’ 
Unfortunately, they can’t even keep 
up with their lies. 
Now, more than ever, Congress needs 
to exercise our constitutional responsi-
bility to stop these endless wars. That

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H280 
January 15, 2020 
is why I am proud to have voted last 
week in support of Congresswoman 
SLOTKIN’s War Powers Resolution to 
limit the President’s military action 
regarding Iran and prevent this crisis 
from spiraling out of control. 
I am also pleased that my bipartisan 
bill, H.R. 2456, would repeal the 2002 au-
thorization. That is going to be taken 
up in 2 weeks. 
The 
administration 
has 
falsely 
claimed that they can justify the use of 
force against Iran by conducting assas-
sinations and strikes in Iraq. It doesn’t 
make any sense. 
My amendment to repeal the 2002 
AUMF was included in the House- 
passed fiscal 2020 NDAA, National De-
fense Authorization Act, and voted on 
a bipartisan basis, but it was stripped 
by Republicans from the final bill. And 
now, unfortunately, we know why Sen-
ator MCCONNELL and the Trump admin-
istration took that out of the NDAA. 
We understand their strategy now as it 
relates to that and what happened in 
Iraq. 
When Congress passed the 2002 AUMF 
before the invasion of Iraq, many of us 
did not support it. It was intended, 
again, to address the perceived threat 
posed by Saddam Hussein as it related 
to weapons of mass destruction. U.S. 
military deployments and operations 
carried out pursuant to the 2002 AUMF, 
dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom—re-
member that?—officially concluded in 
2011, no more. 
Almost 18 years after the resolution’s 
passage, we still have this authoriza-
tion on the books, and that isn’t even 
being used in any current military op-
erations, and it shouldn’t be used. 
In 2 weeks, we will take up Congress-
man KHANNA’s bill, which I am proud 
to cosponsor, to prohibit funds from 
being used for a war with Iran absent 
explicit congressional authorization. 
We must do our job. 
Mr. Speaker, we have known for 
years that there is no military solution 
in the Middle East, and it is past time 
to return to a diplomatic strategy with 
our allies. 
We cannot allow this President’s ir-
responsible and irrational decision-
making to drag us into an unnecessary 
and catastrophic war in the Middle 
East. We must protect our national se-
curity, our brave troops, our allies, 
people in the region, Iraqis, Iranians, 
everyone who lives in the midst of 
harm’s way, and we must protect the 
American people. 
So we ask the question each and 
every day now: Are we safer or less safe 
than before this assassination and mili-
tary strike? I suggest that we are less 
safe, and we need to repeal the 2002 au-
thorization to use force. 
We 
need 
to 
pass 
Congressman 
KHANNA’s resolution, and we also need 
to look at a strategy and insist that 
this administration come to Congress 
if, in fact, they intend to use force any-
where in the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman 
TLAIB for her leadership and for this 
Special Order. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentlewoman’s courtesy 
in permitting me to speak on this and 
bringing us together, and I have en-
joyed listening to my colleagues walk 
us down memory lane. 
BARBARA
LEE, 
JAN
SCHAKOWSKY, 
these are painful memories, but we 
were here when the United States made 
the single biggest foreign policy blun-
der in our history, costing hundreds of 
thousands of lives in the Middle East— 
not just thousands of Americans—cost-
ing trillions of dollars. 
We are watching every day in Amer-
ica the price being paid by men and 
women who come back with injuries, 
both visible and those that aren’t: 
PTSD, missing limbs, lost opportuni-
ties, and troubled families. 
Three 
days 
ago, 
there 
was 
a 
quotation describing what was going 
on with Boeing’s design of the 737 
MAX, where one of their engineers said 
it was designed by clowns and super-
vised by monkeys. I think that act, 
sadly, is what we are looking at, the 
clown act that is going on now, trying 
to sort out a rationale for another rash 
act that has, in fact, left us less safe. 
Now, Donald Trump campaigned tap-
ping into the antiwar sentiment and 
professed to be against endless wars. 
He professed to have been against the 
war in Iraq. Of course, an examination 
of his record finds out, like most 
things, he is on both sides of that ques-
tion. 
But he has taken a step that puts us 
in harm’s way again. It recalls the Bei-
rut tragedy, where there was the larg-
est loss of life since World War II in a 
single day, October 23, 1983. 241 marines 
were lost in that car bombing in the 
barracks in Beirut. 
But that was preceded by what some, 
at this point, would, I think, fairly as-
sess reckless action on behalf of the 
United States in terms of heavy shell-
ing of Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, 
things that we could have done many 
times before but cooler heads prevailed 
because of some of the potential back-
lash. That was, indeed, a serious back-
lash, and we ended up not only having 
the loss of Marine lives; we had to 
withdraw and further unsettle that 
troubled area of the country. 
Well, what we have seen now is that, 
with one reckless act—the execution, 
the assassination of General Soleimani 
is something that we could have done. 
Prior Presidents knew his location. 
They could have assassinated him, and 
they certainly had no love lost for a 
truly reprehensible human being. But 
they knew that they needed to exercise 
restraint because the consequences 
could be grave. 
The one act of assassination has been 
fascinating to watch because what we 
have seen now is that the Iraqis, in 
their Parliament, have disinvited us, 
told us to leave. 
We have watched in Iran where just 
weeks before there were violent dem-
onstrations that were put down by that 
repressive regime against their own 
people. People were demonstrating at 
great personal peril as the forces for re-
form were bubbling up. 
But wasn’t it interesting. Imme-
diately after that assassination by the 
United States in Iraq, not only did it 
consolidate Iraqis wanting us to leave, 
but it—at least, temporarily—united 
the Iranian people against us. 
But for the tragedy of shooting down 
a civilian airliner which was mistaken 
for an American bomber, there would 
have been—that has generated more 
hostility toward the regime, and it was 
their own ineptness that did that, no 
thanks to this administration. 
Watch what has been happening late-
ly. We had a series of briefings that 
were scheduled to finally give informa-
tion to some of the committees. I am 
under no illusion that they would be 
detailed, but at least they would have 
gone through the motions. 
They have been canceled, a series of 
them, with no good reason, after they 
had been scheduled, and people were 
looking forward to that conversation. 
b 1800 
Perhaps it is because this adminis-
tration can’t get its act together, can’t 
get its stories straight. For the last 10 
days, we have watched late night come-
dians use film clips of the Secretary of 
Defense, of the Secretary of State, of 
Donald Trump dissembling, tripping 
over themselves in not just fractured 
rhetoric and syntax but contradicting 
what, in fact, was their rationale, why, 
when, and where. It makes for good 
comedy, but unfortunately, this is seri-
ous. We are talking about a very frag-
ile state in the Middle East. 
I was in the White House being 
briefed by Secretary of State Condi 
Rice and George Tenet, head of the 
CIA, telling us about an imminent dan-
ger then, but at least we had White 
House briefings, at least they went 
through the pretext. They were wrong, 
and they didn’t persuade me or a num-
ber of my colleagues, some of whom 
you have heard from tonight, who 
voted 
against 
their 
authorization, 
voted against their reckless efforts. We 
have seen this movie before. I hope it 
doesn’t spiral out of control again. 
It is important, Mr. Speaker, that 
Americans understand the stakes that 
are involved. It is important for Con-
gress to finally reassert itself. I think 
knowing what we know now, those of 
us who opposed the Iraq war would 
have been overwhelmingly supported, 
and we would have rejected it. But we 
have had the benefit of history to be 
able to hopefully learn from our mis-
takes. 
We have legislation coming forward 
when we return to Washington in 2 
weeks. H.R. 5543, the No War Against 
Iran Act sponsored by Representative 
RO KHANNA, a number of us are original 
cosponsors, agitating for this moving 
forward. It would prevent any funds 
from being used for military force

against 
Iran, 
unless 
legislation 
is 
passed to specifically authorize such 
military action and clarify that Con-
gress has not already authorized the 
use of force against Iran, specifically 
indicating those 2001 and 2002 Author-
izations for Use of Military Force do 
not authorize war with Iran. We need 
to pass that. 
The bill’s text matches an amend-
ment that passed on the House floor 
with 251 votes just last summer. And I 
would hope that we would find mem-
bers of the House in both parties who 
voted for it last summer to add their 
voice and urge their Republican col-
leagues in the Senate to join us to per-
mit a vote. 
We have H.R. 2456 to repeal the Au-
thorization for Use of Military Force 
Against Iraq, the resolution of 2002 led 
by Congresswoman BARBARA LEE, who 
spoke so eloquently here a few mo-
ments ago. Again, I am proud to co-
sponsor and support it. It would elimi-
nate the authorization for the use of 
force against Iraq resolution of 2002. 
And again, this matches a bipartisan 
amendment passed last summer with 
242 votes in the House. 
These are simple, commonsense, bi-
partisan, and it is time for us to enact 
them into law. These were stripped out 
in the process of the budget that Re-
publicans in the Senate and the admin-
istration would not go along with, but 
it is time, especially given the reckless 
acts of this administration recently, to 
go back, revisit, and approve each of 
these elements when we are given an 
opportunity on the floor of the House. 
I am absolutely convinced, based on 
conversations I have had with friends 
of mine, well-meaning Members of Con-
gress at the time, who voted for that 
authorization, who voted for the war 
who felt that that was one of the worst 
votes they ever cast. We have an oppor-
tunity to unwind some of that now 
when we come back by approving those 
two pieces of legislation. 
I deeply appreciate my colleague or-
ganizing this conversation tonight. For 
some people it may seem like it is 
beating a dead horse. I think not. 
These are lessons that we learn too 
slowly. These are lessons that we have 
paid for in blood, in treasure, in upset 
in our communities, in pain and suf-
fering in the United States and around 
the world. I hope that Congresswoman 
TLAIB will continue in her effort at 
being such a strong voice for peace and 
rationality, because we have to con-
tinue to amplify this message for the 
American people. 
I thank the congresswoman again for 
allowing me to participate in this con-
versation this evening. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for his incredible leader-
ship. It is a blessing here. 
This administration’s rogue attempt 
to start a war with Iran has endangered 
countless lives around the world. We 
are farther away from global peace and 
bringing our troops home. 
Just as the wars in Iraq and Afghani-
stan have been disastrous, resulting in 
deaths of millions of people and costing 
trillions of dollars, a war with Iran and 
Iraqi Shia militias would destabilize 
the region and cause untold human suf-
fering. 
Congress must act swiftly to reclaim 
our authority over declarations of war 
and uphold the will of the American 
people who loudly say no to war with 
Iran. 
Our residents want us focused on en-
suring everyone in America has the op-
portunity to thrive. Trillions of dollars 
have been spent on death and destruc-
tion instead of on education and 
healthcare 
that 
communities 
like 
Michigan’s 13th District Strong so des-
perately need. Instead we have wars 
now that have become political cam-
paign moves. 
I represent the third poorest congres-
sional district in the country. My resi-
dents don’t want more endless wars in 
the Middle East. They want good jobs, 
affordable healthcare, and good schools 
for their children. 
We must reclaim our government 
from those who pushed the war, and we 
must dismantle the military industrial 
complex once and for all. 
From day one this administration 
has antagonized Iran, tearing up the 
successful nuclear deal, imposing crip-
pling unilateral sanctions that hurt ev-
eryday people a lot more than they 
hurt the Iran leadership. 
Our foreign policy has been driven by 
warmongers 
obsessed 
with 
regime 
change, despite a long and bloody 
American track record of failed regime 
changes across the globe. Fueled by a 
military industrial complex that de-
mands new targets for its weapons, we 
have roamed from continent to con-
tinent destabilizing governments and 
learning no lessons. We have made it 
actually so much worse. 
The American people have seen what 
happens when we in Congress fail to 
live up to our duty as their representa-
tives. When we don’t ask the tough 
questions of those hungry for war, our 
soldiers, our men and women are sent 
to fight and die in Iraq for weapons of 
mass destruction that do not exist. 
Families from Vietnam to Libya are 
torn apart by bombs and bullets, and 
children across Southeast Asia are 
born without arms and legs because 
weapons like Agent Orange poison in-
nocent civilians to this day. 
Let us finally, mercifully learn our 
lesson now. We must solve our dif-
ferences with diplomacy, not missiles. 
No war with Iran not now, not ever. We 
live in a country where endless wars 
have been normalized, but it is not nor-
mal. It shouldn’t be normal. 
When we demand a debt-free college 
education or healthcare for all, the es-
tablishment, folks in this Chamber ask 
how much will it cost and who will pay 
for it? However, we throw billions of 
dollars away on broken weapons sys-
tems. We spend trillions on sending our 
Armed Forces to die in rich people’s 
wars. 
When we demand basic dignity and 
opportunity to thrive, that is when the 
establishment starts pretending to care 
about deficits and debt. 
We are awake to this game, and we 
are not playing it anymore. We must 
dismantle our war economy and rein-
vest in the people’s economy. 
Last week’s vote on the War Powers 
Resolution is a great first step toward 
reigning in the war machine, but we 
must go further. We need to pass Rep-
resentative LEE’s bill to repeal the 2002 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force, which this administration is 
pretending authorizes their military 
maneuvers. And we need to pass Rep-
resentative KHANNA’s bill to prohibit 
military spending on a war with Iran, 
right now, before another attack is or-
dered. 
We must all keep up the pressure and 
ask those tough questions and keep up 
the fight for the American people who 
are still to this day saying: Stop lying 
to us before you go to war. Stop using 
our men and women as campaign 
moves, rather than trying to keep our 
Nation safe. 
We can stop this march to war, but it 
is going to take all of us and take cour-
age in this Chamber. 
I thank my good colleagues from the 
Congressional Progressive Caucus for 
their amazing and incredible courage 
to stand up and tell the truth that is 
sometimes lacking in this Chamber. 
We must do that. And sometimes stay-
ing silent or not asking those tough 
questions is the same as lying. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the 13th Dis-
trict for their faith and support in the 
work that I am doing in this Chamber. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President and to address their remarks 
to the Chair. 
f 
THE 47TH ANNUAL MARCH FOR 
LIFE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. SMITH) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, next week tens of thousands 
of women and men from around the 
country will March For Life, making 
clear to the country and to the world 
that women and unborn babies deserve 
the utmost respect, love, and protec-
tion from the violence of abortion. 
Sadly, Mr. Speaker, since 1973 over 61 
million unborn babies have been killed 
by either dismemberment, a procedure 
where the child is decapitated and torn 
apart arms, legs, and torso or by chem-
ical poisoning. The loss of children’s 
lives in America is staggering, a death 
toll that equates with the entire popu-
lation of Italy. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distin-
guished gentleman from Indiana, Con-
gressman JIM BANKS, who has been a 
leader in defending the innocent and 
most vulnerable.

January 15, 2020 
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for his 
tireless efforts on behalf of the unborn. 
Mr. Speaker, although the ruling in 
Roe v. Wade significantly altered the 
fabric of our Nation, Hoosiers will 
never stop marching in defense of the 
fundamental right to life. 
In my corner of the State of Indiana 
in the northeast corner of the State, 
we have one of the most active and ro-
bust pro-life organizations in the coun-
try, the Allen County Right To Life. 
Mr. Speaker, the Allen County Right 
To Life works every day to advance the 
cause of life at our State house in Indi-
anapolis and the courts and in our own 
community. I am excited to share 
today that they will soon be incor-
porating 
the 
counties 
of 
Adams, 
DeKalb, LaGrange, Noble, Steuben, and 
Wells Counties to join forces under the 
name Right to Life of Northeast Indi-
ana. 
Indiana is now considered the sixth 
pro-life State in the country. The re-
markable progress in Indiana over 
these last 4 decades would not have 
been possible without the steadfast 
support of this organization and pro- 
life champions like Cathie Humbarger. 
Mr. Speaker, each year the Allen 
County Right To Life leads an annual 
bus trip to Washington for the Na-
tional March for Life, and this year 
they will be descending on our Nation’s 
capitol with a record-breaking 650 pro- 
life students and advocates from north-
east Indiana, and I could not be 
prouder. 
Mr. Speaker, this incredible organi-
zation is also expecting a record-break-
ing 2,500 Hoosiers at the 2020 Northeast 
Indiana March for Life in Fort Wayne 
this coming Saturday. And I will be 
marching alongside those 2,500 Hoo-
siers back home in Fort Wayne to 
honor those of whom never had the 
chance to march for themselves. 
I believe that all life is sacred, and I 
ask that all Americans wherever you 
are in the country to join me in march-
ing to reaffirm this principle. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
eloquent comments and reminding us 
of the great progress being made at the 
State level where so many laws and 
policies have been enacted, and we are 
trying to do that on the Federal level. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Alabama, MARTHA ROBY, a 
member of the Appropriations Com-
mittee and the Judiciary Committee. 
b 1815 
Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative SMITH for leading this 
Special Order. 
The topic that we are here to discuss 
tonight is one of the utmost impor-
tance. Of course, next week, we ap-
proach the 47th anniversary of the infa-
mous Roe v. Wade decision. With this 
single ruling by the Supreme Court, 
abortion was legalized across the coun-
try. 
While many abortion activists cele-
brate this time as a victory for so- 
called women’s health, it represents a 
somber occasion for those of us who ad-
vocate for life. 
It 
is 
no 
secret 
that 
I 
am 
unapologetically pro-life. I believe life 
begins at conception, and I am opposed 
to abortion at any stage. 
While not everyone in this body 
shares my convictions about life or on 
certain policies surrounding the rights 
of unborn children, our pro-life agenda 
has momentum, and it is strong. 
Next week, thousands of Americans 
will gather in our Nation’s Capital to 
participate in this year’s March for 
Life. This is an annual event where the 
pro-life community joins together to 
advocate for the protection of unborn 
children. 
I know that some pro-life supporters 
will be traveling from Alabama’s Sec-
ond District, almost 900 miles, to de-
fend the unborn. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to take this op-
portunity to send a message to the 
thousands of marchers who are gath-
ering to show their support for the pro- 
life movement: Thank you. Thank you 
for your dedication to this most wor-
thy cause, and know that you are not 
alone in this fight. As you continue to 
stand up for those who cannot stand up 
for themselves, remember that my pro- 
life colleagues and I stand with you. 
I promise to use this platform here in 
Congress, and beyond, to be a vocal ad-
vocate for the unborn. I will not stop 
fighting until our laws and policies 
protect life at every stage, and I hope 
you won’t either. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Congresswoman ROBY 
for her very powerful statement and 
her leadership here in the U.S. House. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HARRIS), my dis-
tinguished friend and colleague, the co- 
chairman of the Congressional Pro-Life 
Caucus. Dr. ANDY HARRIS is a board- 
certified 
anesthesiologist 
who 
has 
served so ably at Johns Hopkins and 
elsewhere. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. SMITH, the co-chair of the Pro-Life 
Caucus, for the work he has done over 
the decades to protect unborn life. 
Next week, I am going to have a 
birthday, but 61 million Americans 
aren’t. Now, let that thought sink in 
for a second because that is the popu-
lation of California and Florida to-
gether. That is the number of Ameri-
cans who didn’t get a chance to be born 
since Roe v. Wade was passed. 
I have spent over 30 years as an anes-
thesiologist on the labor and delivery 
suite. I was in charge of the labor and 
delivery anesthesia at Hopkins for dec-
ades, seeing the birth of literally thou-
sands of babies, not even beginning to 
comprehend the magnitude of the 61 
million lives that never had that op-
portunity to be born. 
Next week, we are going to have the 
March for Life. Mr. Speaker, I urge all 
Americans who are watching to tune in 
to one of those channels that shows 
that March for Life because what you 
will be struck by are the number of 
young people who have not believed the 
lie about abortion, the lie that it is a 
blob of tissue, that it is not a human 
life, that somehow that human life 
does not have the right to life. 
I believe there are a lot of young peo-
ple who march because this is the gen-
eration that knows that it was legal 
for them to be aborted. I think they ap-
preciate the fact that they weren’t. 
Like Mrs. ROBY, I am on the Appro-
priations Committee, and I am glad to 
have fought to get Planned Parenthood 
defunded 
by 
tax 
dollars 
because 
Planned Parenthood is the largest 
abortion provider in the United States. 
That means it is responsible for the 
taking of tens of millions of lives over 
the years. Not only that but they actu-
ally promote using American tax dol-
lars to provide abortions overseas as 
well. 
I am proud of our President because 
our President reestablished what we 
call the Mexico City policy, which is 
very simple, Mr. Speaker. It says that 
American 
tax 
dollars, 
hardworking 
American taxpayer dollars, should not 
be spent on providing abortions in for-
eign countries. 
Oh, my gosh. It is bad enough that we 
still fund Planned Parenthood here in 
this country, but, my gosh, spending 
tax dollars to pay for abortions in for-
eign countries? Thank goodness our 
President stands firmly pro-life, some 
people suggest the most pro-life Presi-
dent we have ever had, and at such a 
good time to be the most pro-life Presi-
dent. 
As the death toll climbs to over 60 
million, it is rapidly approaching the 
time to say enough is enough. This is 
the largest and most important human 
rights issue we face. This country has 
faced human rights issues before. We 
have to face this challenge, and we 
have to turn back the legalization of 
the killing of millions of Americans be-
fore they are even born. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Dr. HARRIS so very 
much for his comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN), a 
distinguished Member. He is also the 
sponsor of the Ensuring Accurate and 
Complete Data Reporting Act. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman SMITH for his hard work and 
for what he does on a daily basis to 
protect the lives of the unborn. 
Mr. Speaker, I solemnly stand before 
you today on the 47th anniversary of 
Roe v. Wade, a decision that has cor-
rupted the very foundation of our 
unalienable right to life as citizens of 
this great country. 
Life is a precious gift from our cre-
ator, from conception to natural death. 
I have been dedicated to protecting the 
rights of the unborn since the day I was 
sworn into Congress. It is a fight that 
I vow to continue until the last day 
that I serve in this body. 
As a proud grandfather of 17 beau-
tiful grandchildren, the sanctity of life

January 15, 2020 
is cherished and personal. Let me give 
an example. 
Just a few months ago, September 25, 
our 17th grandchild was born 3 months 
premature. His name is Warren, and we 
were unsure if he would survive. But it 
is by the grace of God, the love and 
support of family and friends, and the 
heroic work of the great doctors and 
nurses that Warren is still with us 
today. 
After more than 100 days in the neo-
natal intensive care unit, Warren was 
finally able to leave the hospital last 
week. Each moment we spend with him 
is a true miracle that I will never take 
for granted. 
Warren was, to give an example, 1 
pound, 15 ounces when he was born. 
You could see the elements of his per-
sonality from the very beginning. He 
was a fighter. 
It is a daily reminder that the lives 
of millions of other children, the same 
size as Warren when he was born, have 
been allowed to be cut short due to the 
ruling of Roe v. Wade. It is truly 
unfathomable to think that the rule of 
law in this great country permits the 
intentional killing of the most vulner-
able population. 
While most Americans agree it is 
morally wrong to end an unborn 
human life by abortion, it is also mor-
ally wrong to take taxpayer dollars to 
promote abortion at home or abroad, 
as has been stated. Yet in their re-
cently released annual report, Planned 
Parenthood boasts spending $617 mil-
lion on the mass murder of over 345,000 
children in this country in just 1 year. 
That 
is 
roughly 
947 
premeditated 
killings each day by the billion-dollar 
abortion business. 
These statistics are not only alarm-
ing but, quite frankly, they are gro-
tesque. They are among the many rea-
sons why I will not only continue to 
support commonsense pro-life legisla-
tion, such as the bipartisan Born-Alive 
Abortion Survivors Protection Act, but 
will also march in solidarity with mil-
lions of Americans nationwide and 
hundreds of South Carolinians from the 
district I serve in honor of those who 
weren’t given that chance that so 
many of us have been given. 
On this dark anniversary, let us unite 
and rededicate ourselves to protecting 
the unborn. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
sharing that beautiful story of his 
grandchild. What a tenacious spirit, 
and our prayers are with him as he 
prospers and thrives. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BABIN), my good friend 
and colleague. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
very, very much my friend and col-
league from New Jersey, CHRIS SMITH, 
for having this Special Order, which is 
so very important. There is no greater 
champion for life than our colleague 
CHRIS SMITH. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank every one 
of my colleagues who are surrounding 
me tonight or are here speaking for 
those who are voiceless. 
I rise solemnly today, Mr. Speaker, 
in memory of the Supreme Court’s 
tragic decision in Roe v. Wade 47 years 
ago, this appalling decision. Since that 
time, more than 60 million innocent 
human beings have been killed in the 
name of abortion and convenience. 
Throughout our history, Americans 
have been the very first to protect the 
defenseless around the world repeat-
edly through the centuries, yet here at 
home, we have allowed our very most 
vulnerable to come under vicious at-
tack. 
As the father of five children and the 
grandfather of 16 beautiful grand-
children, I have no more important 
duty personally than to protect the 
lives of all Americans. 
As Members of Congress, we have 
that same duty to protect all Ameri-
cans, especially the ones who have no 
voice. 
I have been very proud to support the 
steps taken by President Trump and 
his administration, who is the most 
pro-life President in the history of this 
country, in his fight to save innocent 
lives from abortion. We are so very 
grateful for his bold executive efforts 
to protect the lives of the unborn, 
which have been so very, very effective. 
As thousands of Americans gather 
once again here in Washington, D.C., 
next week to stand up for life, let us be 
renewed in our purpose to end abor-
tion. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman very 
much for his comments tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Speak-
er, for almost half a century, we have 
watched our Nation dehumanize an en-
tire group of people based on their age 
with the Roe decision allowing the 
killing of 60 million unborn children. 
This is the largest human rights viola-
tion of our time. 
As Martin Luther King, Jr., said: 
‘‘There is no graded scale of essential 
worth’’ among people. 
This truth is something the evil or-
ganization Planned Parenthood delib-
erately chooses not to see, ending lives 
and selling baby parts for the sake of 
science. As America’s largest abortion 
provider, it performs over 320,000 every 
single year, all in the name of freedom. 
But there is quite obviously absolutely 
no such thing as a right or freedom to 
end someone else’s life. 
As Ronald Reagan said, isn’t it inter-
esting that all who support abortion 
have already been born? 
b 1830 
We must defend the equal right to 
life for everyone. If we can’t do that, 
what are we even doing here? 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. BAIRD), a Bronze Star win-
ner and a Purple Heart recipient. I 
thank him for his service and thank 
him for his witness for life. 
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for having this Special Order. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect 
on the 47th anniversary of the Roe v. 
Wade Supreme Court decision which 
has had a devastating effect on pro-
tecting the sanctity of life and advanc-
ing the rights of the unborn. 
This ill-fated decision has had dras-
tic, negative consequences and has ex-
panded the abhorrent practice of abor-
tion across this country. 
But despite the devastating effects 
Roe v. Wade has had on the sanctity of 
life, I am inspired to see so many of my 
fellow Members of Congress join me in 
continuing the fight for the unborn. 
Whether it be by signing the discharge 
petition to bring the Born-Alive Abor-
tion Survivors Protection Act to the 
floor for a vote, or by cosponsoring leg-
islation to prohibit the use of taxpayer 
funding in abortions, my House col-
leagues and I will continue to fight to 
protect life. 
Just a couple of weeks ago, I was 
proud to join 206 of my congressional 
colleagues in signing an amicus brief 
filed with the U.S. Supreme Court con-
cerning the Louisiana case of June 
Medical Services v. Gee. 
I look forward to seeing the court re-
view this case and others in hopes that 
they may issue a decision that reflects 
the will of the majority of Americans 
to protect the unborn. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. CHABOT), my good friend and 
colleague. The gentleman was the 
prime author of the law to save born- 
alive children, a law that we are look-
ing now to strengthen with 199 cospon-
sors which is Representative ANN WAG-
NER’s bill. I thank the gentleman for 
his leadership. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank CHRIS SMITH for his leadership 
and his commitment to advancing pro- 
life legislation for literally decades 
now. He has been a leader for many of 
us, and we have watched and followed 
in his footsteps in many ways. 
A previous speaker, ANDY
HARRIS, 
mentioned that his birthday is next 
week, and I share something with him 
because my birthday happens to be 
next week as well. Not only is it next 
week, but it is on January 22, which is 
the very day that the horrific Roe v. 
Wade decision was issued. 
For decades now, I literally, on my 
birthday, with all of the joy that you 
have with your family or with friends 
and colleagues in celebrating your 
birthday, I can’t help but think of 
those millions and millions of little, 
innocent, unborn babies that were not 
born, that have never experienced life 
because of a tragic decision that was 
made that they had no part in making, 
but their life was ended before they 
were able to share the blessing that life 
is. 
That is why we need to overturn that 
horrific Roe v. Wade decision. Many of 
us have been working for years and

January 15, 2020 
years now to do that, or to do every-
thing we can up to that point until, ul-
timately, the court makes that deci-
sion. 
We have a responsibility, I believe, to 
protect the most vulnerable among us, 
and that is innocent, unborn babies. It 
was one of the principal reasons that I 
wanted to come to Congress. It was one 
of the principal reasons that I wanted 
to be on the Judiciary Committee. 
I was blessed to be chosen by one of 
the legends in the pro-life community, 
probably the father of the pro-life 
movement here in the House, and that 
was the late Henry Hyde who chaired 
the Judiciary Committee. 
Next to Henry, CHRIS SMITH certainly 
is the leader since Henry. But as the 
gentleman mentioned, as a member of 
the Judiciary Committee, it took me a 
number of years and I was able to work 
my way up to the chair of that com-
mittee and did successfully pass the 
Born-Alive 
Infants 
Protection 
Act 
which saved babies that they were lit-
erally finding in soiled utility closets. 
We had nurses who had formerly 
worked in abortion clinics and they 
came and told terrible stories of what 
had happened. That is now no longer 
the law, but we need to go beyond that. 
After that, we went on to pass prob-
ably what is the most significant pro- 
life legislation since Roe v. Wade and 
that is the ban on partial-birth abor-
tion, which I offered along with many 
other Members. 
We fought for 8 years—STEVE KING 
and so many other folks—and went all 
the way to the U.S. Supreme Court 
twice. 
I remember when that decision came 
down. I was in the Judiciary Com-
mittee when we all heard about it and 
we were so excited. We don’t know ex-
actly how many babies—we think tens 
of thousands every year—that that has 
saved, but we are still losing so many 
other innocent, unborn lives here in 
this Nation. There have been 61 million 
since Roe v. Wade that we know of. 
I want to thank all of my colleagues 
who are here this evening and spending 
their time to do something, I think, 
which is probably one of the most wor-
thy things we can do with our time 
here in the House, and that is to try to 
protect 
those 
who 
cannot 
protect 
themselves. 
I thank everyone that is here. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. HICE). 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague, CHRIS SMITH, for 
leading this Special Order as we memo-
rialize countless lives that have been 
lost in the last 47 years to the Roe v. 
Wade decision. 
The gentleman and all of my col-
leagues here are champions for life, 
and I want to thank them for their 
commitment and their resolve to ad-
dress this issue. 
The March for Life is a unique event 
in American culture. It is the only 
march where 100 percent of the partici-
pants are marching on behalf of some-
one else; marching on behalf of the 
most vulnerable among us, as has al-
ready been mentioned, those who have 
not yet had the opportunity to take 
their first breath of life. 
This Special Order annually com-
memorating the March for Life stands 
as a memorial to those lives who have 
been lost to abortion. And it is time for 
this Chamber to mark that dreadful de-
cision of the Supreme Court and to 
mourn the results of that decision. 
This is a time for us to carefully con-
sider the choices of our Nation and the 
realization that those choices have dire 
consequences. 
This is our time to learn from those 
past decisions and to, with fresh deter-
mination, do all we can to make sure 
that we don’t repeat the mistakes of 
the past. 
It is for that reason that I introduced 
H. Res. 50, which would memorialize 
the unborn by lowering the flag of the 
United States to half-staff on the 22nd 
of every January. It would be known as 
a day of tears, memorializing the ocean 
of tears that have been lost and shed 
for the millions, countless children 
who have never had a chance to live. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe every human 
life is sacred. I believe that life begins 
at conception, and if we don’t stand on 
behalf of the unborn, who will? That is 
the question. 
So it is on their behalf that each of 
us here, we will never waiver, we will 
never quit. We will continue fighting 
with everything we have for life. No 
matter how long the battle is, no mat-
ter how intense it may become, we will 
not cease our effort until every child is 
given the gift of life that only God 
gives. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman so 
much and thank him for reminding the 
Members, as well as those who might 
be watching on C–SPAN, of the selfless-
ness of the pro-life movement. 
The people who will be marching are 
doing it for others, and, increasingly, 
at every march, there are more women 
who are postabortive who now speak 
out on behalf of their lost child. And 
they admonish and encourage others 
not to make that same terrible, irre-
versible mistake. 
I yield to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. FORTENBERRY), my good 
friend and colleague. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Congressman SMITH for yielding. 
First of all, let me acknowledge the 
gentleman’s tireless work on behalf of 
human rights, justice, and human dig-
nity. The gentleman is authentically 
the conscience of this Congress, and I 
am so grateful for his leadership and 
deep friendship. 
Mr. Speaker, as you walk down this 
aisle as I just did, if you will notice 
this beautiful rostrum in this well 
where we speak, along the sides of the 
rostrum here are a couple of words. 
They express the deepest, noble senti-
ments of what it means to be an Amer-
ican: union, justice and peace. But 
there is another word that is often 
overlooked and it is right here. It says: 
‘‘Tolerance.’’ 
We are living in a very interesting 
age. We are living, in a certain sense, 
in a divided age. We seem to be strug-
gling with our narrative as a nation, 
particularly politically. But something 
beautiful is happening. 
There is a new momentum among 
this new generation that is coming up 
that is wrestling with these deeper 
questions as to how you build a more 
just nation; how you include people 
who have been left out. How do you 
struggle for peace? How do you find au-
thentic freedom, liberty? 
Tolerance creates the space for pro-
tection of that sacred space of con-
science, of deliberation that we have in 
this body that is built upon a funda-
mental foundation of life: the protec-
tion of the ideals of life. 
We cannot say that we are going to 
include everybody and celebrate diver-
sity except for them, the littlest ones, 
the smallest ones, the most vulnerable 
ones, the unborn child and the mothers 
that carried them in their womb. We 
have to do better. 
The young people cannot reconcile 
this paradox. They can’t. That is why 
tens of thousands of them are going to 
come here next week—and a number of 
them are from my home State of Ne-
braska, and I am very proud of them— 
and they are going to do the American 
thing. They are going to exercise their 
civil rights for the noblest of senti-
ments; namely, tolerance for the most 
innocent, for the most vulnerable. 
They are going to say to us who are 
older, who have to shepherd this Na-
tion: Please, please open your hearts 
and minds. We have to do better. We 
must do better. 
No matter how deep the problem, no 
matter how severe the circumstance, 
we should be loving enough, caring 
enough, big enough, and we certainly 
have resources enough to be a commu-
nity that cares and loves and helps no 
matter 
how 
difficult 
the 
cir-
cumstances. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman very 
much for his very eloquent remarks 
and for his clarity as well. He has al-
ways been such a clear speaker, and I 
thank him so much. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL), and I 
would like to point out to the Chair 
that we have so many doctors, M.D.s, 
who are speaking on behalf of unborn 
children and their moms. I want to 
thank the gentleman, Dr. MARSHALL, 
for that as well. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, to-
night, we mourn the 47th anniversary 
of Roe v. Wade. Today, we mourn the 
loss of over 50 million American lives. 
Mr. Speaker, my good friend and col-
league from New Jersey, and my col-
leagues here tonight all know that I 
dedicated my professional life to deliv-
ering babies. Every day, every other

January 15, 2020 
day for 30 years, I had the honor to de-
liver a baby. Sometimes it was one. I 
delivered as many as 12 babies in a day. 
But a subject I have never talked 
about up here, a subject that few 
Americans talk about, is infertility 
and recurrent miscarriages. Hundreds 
of thousands of women have these 
problems, and for whatever reason, 
when I took care of women with mis-
carriages, women who so desperately 
wanted to have a baby—it might be her 
third, 
her 
fourth, 
her 
fifth 
mis-
carriage—and who were unable to have 
a baby, it was at moments like that 
that I thought about Roe v. Wade. 
It never made sense to me. This 
morning, I read from the Book of Ec-
clesiastes trying to make some sense of 
life up here. Still, here I am, 50-some 
years of age, and I haven’t found the 
answer. How can I live in a country 
where in one hospital I am fighting to 
help a woman keep a baby, and 100 
miles away, the largest abortion clinic 
in the country is taking life away? 
How can we live in that type of a 
country? Tonight I pledge, I recommit 
my support and my efforts to protect 
life. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman so 
much for his words. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding a moment. 
Mr. Speaker, here we are again, 
marking this tragic anniversary as we 
do every year. The reason we have such 
sorrow and such a burden is because it 
is such an unspeakable sorrow what 
has happened to nearly 60 million inno-
cent, unborn children in this country. 
Our Nation’s birth certificate is the 
Declaration of Independence, and it 
states succinctly what has been known 
as the American creed, and we know it 
by heart: ‘‘We hold these truths to be 
self-evident, that all men are created 
equal, that they are endowed by their 
creator 
with 
certain 
unalienable 
rights, that among these are life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness.’’ 
b 1845 
The Founders recognized life first 
among those inalienable rights because 
they acknowledged that we are made in 
the image of a holy God, and because of 
that, there are some very serious im-
plications that follow. 
It means every single human life has 
inestimable dignity and value. And our 
value is not related in any way to our 
socioeconomic status, the color of our 
skin, what ZIP Code we live in, how 
talented we may be, or what we can 
contribute to society. Our value is in-
herent, because, as our Founders ac-
knowledged, it is given to us by our 
creator. 
Roe v. Wade tragically defied that 
American creed, and it has resulted, as 
we said, in the murder of more than 60 
million innocent American children. 
How can we stand by and allow this 
to happen? We can’t, and we will not. 
And I will just say this in the very 
brief moment that I have. Tonight we 
will continue to pray, we will continue 
to work, we will continue to legislate, 
we will continue to litigate, and we 
will continue to march and stand for 
women and children and the sanctity of 
every single human life until the prom-
ise of our Nation’s birth certificate is 
realized. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield now to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. LATTA). 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the right to life for 
every unborn child. 
But before I start, I want to thank 
the gentleman from Jersey for his tire-
less work and efforts to reverse this de-
cision and to make sure that life is 
what we are about in this country, be-
cause, tragically, in the 47 years since 
Roe v. Wade, there have been more 
than 60 million abortions in our coun-
try. 
This is more than a statistic. These 
are innocent lives lost. Even if this de-
cision is brought back before the Su-
preme Court, abortions can still be 
prevalent due to the increasing use of 
chemical abortion pills. That is why 
my bill, the SAVE Moms and Babies 
Act, is necessary, to ensure that the 
current FDA policy regulating these 
dangerous pills will stay in place—pre-
venting expanded use—to protect the 
health and safety of women. 
I am a committed advocate for pro- 
life policies, for the protection of the 
sanctity of life. I appreciate and thank 
those who offer an unwavering dedica-
tion to defending the unborn, despite a 
culture that often marginalizes pro-life 
values. Such perseverance is incredibly 
inspiring. It is an important reminder 
that we must all be a voice for the 
voiceless. 
The fight for life must continue. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Ohio for his leadership on that bill and 
all of the other pro-life pieces of legis-
lation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. JOHN W. ROSE). 
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, today, on behalf of the tens of 
millions of voices forever lost to abor-
tion since Roe v. Wade, I come before 
this body to mourn the tragic loss of 
life our country has experienced in this 
last 47 years. 
The Tennesseeans I represent over-
whelmingly support the right to life; 
and like most folks in Tennessee’s 
Sixth Congressional District, I firmly 
believe that life begins at conception. 
Throughout my first term in Congress, 
I have been proud to fight for the chil-
dren still to come who cannot speak for 
themselves. 
As a father, I am especially touched 
by the solemn and joyous responsi-
bility our Heavenly Father entrusts to 
us through the blessing of little ones. 
Even one child’s life shortened before 
reaching his or her own God-given po-
tential is a tragedy, and yet that has 
happened tens of millions of times in 
the last 47 years since Roe v. Wade was 
decided in the Supreme Court. 
Heartbreakingly, Norma McCorvey, 
also known as Jane Roe, was a real 
mother, and, ultimately, she was a real 
advocate for the unborn. Later in her 
life, Ms. McCorvey came to faith in 
God and joined the pro-life community 
in believing that every child’s life is 
worth protecting. 
Ms. McCorvey is no longer with us, 
but her story lives on. Today I call on 
my colleagues to search their souls, 
just as Ms. McCorvey—Jane Roe—did 
and choose life. 
Who are we to decide which precious 
children designed by God have the 
chance to live on this Earth and which 
do not? 
Our country was founded with this 
belief underscored: ‘‘that all men are 
created equal, that they are endowed 
by 
their 
creator 
with 
certain 
unalienable rights, that among these 
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness.’’ 
With the words of the Declaration of 
Independence in mind, I signed onto an 
amicus brief supporting life in the up-
coming June Medical Services v. Gee 
Supreme Court case. It is well past 
time for the Supreme Court to uphold 
the right to life and overrule Roe v. 
Wade. 
Ms. 
McCorvey—Jane 
Roe—agreed, 
and, overwhelmingly, so do the Ten-
nesseans that I represent. 
In this new decade, may our coun-
try’s legacy be of life and a new genera-
tion of hope. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. WALBERG), my good 
friend and colleague. 
Mr. 
WALBERG. 
Mr. 
Speaker: 
‘‘Around her neck hung a gold necklace 
that said ‘Best Mom,’ a Christmas 
present from her two daughters. 
‘‘Stefanie closed her eyes, just as she 
does at the dentist. ‘That way I don’t 
have to see what’s going on,’ she said. 
‘‘Ten minutes later, the sleepless 
nights, the tighter jeans, the third 
child that she said would have strained 
the family’s finances, were a memory.’’ 
That shocking article was in the Chi-
cago Tribune 17 years ago, 2003. That 
child who would have strained the fam-
ily’s finances would have been a senior 
high school student and who knows 
what more. 
Back then, 40 million babies had been 
aborted since Roe v. Wade. Today, 61 
million. January 22 marks the 47th ig-
nominy of Roe v. Wade. 
As recently as yesterday, in com-
mittee, I heard abortion defended as a 
‘‘woman’s 
constitutional 
right 
to 
choose what is best for her own body 
and interests.’’ 
Now, someone decried the fact that 
there are so many men standing and 
speaking today, but we men have al-
ways stood to defend the innocent and 
to defend our families. So, proudly, 
today, we do the same. 
Charles Darwin said, ‘‘great is the 
power of steady misrepresentation.’’

And so we have created a lie. We have 
chosen a lie. We have been sold a lie. 
We have lived a lie. We have even tried 
to make it the truth, but it is still a 
lie. 
And 
children, 
innocents, 
and 
women have been hurt because of it; 
and, ultimately, all life has been 
cheapened and diminished. 
May God change our hearts. 
Our children are not our burdens; 
they are our hope. Our children are to-
morrow’s dreams and ideas and imagi-
nation. Our children are the pioneers 
who unlock more secrets of God’s uni-
verse, harness new technologies for 
peace, strive to create a world freer 
from want, and bring forth long-await-
ed cures for dreaded diseases. They are 
our artists, our poets, who will make 
life more vivid and colorful, and the 
faithful who will serve God and their 
fellow beings. 
Babies aren’t a choice once they are 
conceived; they are a gift from our lov-
ing creator, God. Thomas Jefferson 
wisely stated: ‘‘The God who gave us 
life, gave us liberty at the same time.’’ 
And so I end by saying human liberty 
is inseparably linked to human life. 
God help us as a nation to choose life 
and liberty. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. FLORES). 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. SMITH for all his great work to pro-
tect life and to reflect the values that 
this country holds dear. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remem-
brance of the millions of innocent lives 
lost in the 47 years since the tragic Su-
preme Court decision, Roe v. Wade. 
Since 1973, freely accessible abortion 
has fostered a culture of death in 
America, and the expansion of clinics 
like Planned Parenthood have normal-
ized abortion and stolen the futures of 
over 50 million innocent lives. 
Here 
are 
some 
statistics 
from 
Planned Parenthood’s own annual re-
port: 
In 2019 alone, they aborted 345,670 in-
nocent, defenseless lives. Think about 
that from a personal perspective. That 
is over 100,000 more persons than the 
population of Waco and McLennan 
County, Texas, the largest county in 
Texas District 17, which has over 
250,000-plus Texans. 
This genocide constitutes over 96 per-
cent of their pregnancy resolution 
services, as they call them; whereas, 
prenatal and adoption referral services 
accounted for less than 4 percent of 
pregnancy resolution services. 
While they may seek to mask their 
intentions under the banner of wom-
en’s health, make no mistake, Planned 
Parenthood is an abortion factory dedi-
cated to providing, protecting, and ex-
panding access to abortion. 
Moreover, something else to think 
about is that at least 50 percent of 
those babies killed are girls. Recent re-
ports indicate that over 50 percent are 
children of color. Think about the mi-
sogyny and the racism of those geno-
cidal numbers. 
I strongly believe that life begins at 
conception, and as a father and a Chris-
tian, I am deeply committed to pro-
tecting the sanctity of life. In the 116th 
Congress, I have sought to be a voice 
for those who cannot speak for them-
selves and have cosponsored over 20 
bills to protect life. 
I am also proud to have joined 206 
other pro-life Members of Congress in 
signing a recent amicus brief to the Su-
preme Court. If successful and this so- 
called right to abortion, as outlined in 
Roe v. Wade, is considered unworkable 
by the courts, then it is time to over-
turn that tragic decision. 
Mr. Speaker, I close with this: Mil-
lions of Americans believe that life be-
gins at conception and must be pro-
tected. I stand with those Americans to 
fight for the lives that may be snuffed 
out before they have even begun. We 
must continue to fight for those who 
have been denied the opportunity to 
grow, to flourish, and to make an im-
pact on our world. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN). 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to mark, with sadness, the 47th an-
niversary of Roe v. Wade. This tragic 
Supreme Court decision has resulted in 
the loss of over 60 million unborn ba-
bies’ lives. This surpasses the number 
killed by Stalin and Hitler, combined. 
In a country, today, where so many 
social and technological advancements 
have been achieved, how is it that we 
still fail to value the most funda-
mental 
part 
of 
human 
society—a 
human life? 
The repercussions of Roe have been 
disastrous. Over 60 million children 
have lost their lives because of Roe. 
I am dismayed by the arguments I 
hear coming from those who call them-
selves pro-choice. Those 60 million un-
born were not given a choice. 
I have two wonderful and lovely 
daughters-in-law who are expecting ba-
bies as we speak right now. I am so 
glad that these two principled women 
and their husbands value life. 
Now, our choice is to be the voice for 
the voiceless. I am proud to stand here 
with my colleagues in Congress for the 
cause of life. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, may I inquire how much time 
we have left. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 14 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Georgia. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I have 4 
children and 13 grandchildren, and I 
can’t imagine life without them and 
the love that we have for each other. In 
fact, every human life from the mo-
ment of conception is precious, worthy 
of dignity and respect. 
The right to life should not be a po-
litical debate. 
b 1900 
As a society, we should be united in 
the understanding that killing another 
human being, a baby, an unborn child, 
is immoral and unconstitutional. But 
in 1973 the Supreme Court ruled to 
make abortion available throughout 
pregnancy for nearly any reason. 
Mr. Speaker, there are only five 
countries in the world that allow abor-
tion after the first 5 months, and, un-
fortunately, the U.S. is one of them. 
But Americans want better: 82 percent 
of Americans believe that abortion 
should be restricted. However, radicals 
on the left are taking abortion to a 
new extreme trying to justify killing a 
healthy, 7-pound baby up until the 
point of birth. 
Can you imagine? 
Some even try to justify killing a 
baby who survives an abortion at-
tempt. In fact, we have a petition on 
this floor called the Born-Alive Abor-
tion Survivors Protection Act, and 
there are 240 Members of this body who 
refuse to sign that petition. This is re-
pugnant. 
Can you imagine, as the Virginia 
Governor described, a baby born in a 
botched abortion: What we do is make 
the child comfortable and then talk 
with the mother and the other stake-
holders to decide whether we kill the 
baby. 
That is un-American. 
In the 47 years since Roe v. Wade, we 
killed over 60 million of these children. 
That is why I am proud to cosponsor 
H.R. 50 which will memorialize the un-
born by lowering the United States flag 
to half-staff on the 22nd of January 
each year. 
Mr. Speaker, I pray that the hearts 
and minds of every person in this coun-
try, particularly those who are Mem-
bers of this body, will change and vote 
for life. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate my good friend 
and colleague for his very eloquent 
statement. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. YOHO). 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to tell Congressman CHRIS SMITH how 
proud I am, that he is one of my heroes 
for doing what he is doing. The gen-
tleman has never wavered on this. 
Mr. Speaker, as we approach the an-
niversary of Roe v. Wade, it is a solemn 
reminder of the tragedy that continues 
to befall some of our Nation’s unborn 
children. We should repeat this again 
on Mother’s Day. 
For 47 years the Nation has allowed 
the sanctity of life to be questioned 
and infringed upon. All of us in this 
Chamber are here because we were 
granted the blessing of life. We were al-
lowed to live our lives and decide what 
path we wished to embark upon. Unfor-
tunately, not all Americans are al-
lowed this choice. Some children are 
stopped before they can even defend 
themselves. 
I, along with many of my colleagues, 
cannot and will not accept that reality. 
A reality where we as a nation provide 
more protection for an unhatched bald 
eagle or a turtle embryo, i.e, an egg,

than we do the children of our own spe-
cies. 
It is my hope that on this anniver-
sary we can pray for the souls of those 
children lost and work towards a fu-
ture where all children are allowed to 
decide their own future in this blessed 
Nation of ours. Our Founding Fathers 
were grounded in the Christian prin-
ciples this Nation was founded on. 
2 Chronicles 7:14: ‘‘If my people, who 
are called by my name, will humble 
themselves and pray and seek my face 
and turn from their wicked ways; then 
I will hear from heaven, and I will for-
give their sin, and will heal their 
land.’’ 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, again I point out to my col-
leagues that there are so many medical 
doctors who are part of this pro-life ef-
fort. Hopefully, their views, like all of 
ours, but theirs especially, will be 
weighed and, hopefully, people will 
agree to the great work that Dr. Joyce 
is doing. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. And I want to acknowledge 
Mr. SMITH from New Jersey for taking 
such courageous leadership on this 
very important issue. We as a body 
thank the gentleman. 
Mr. Speaker, 47 years of the amoral 
destruction of life is 47 years too long. 
As a physician, my pro-life conviction 
is rooted in the Hippocratic oath’s 
commitment to protecting human life. 
In the medical community, each of us 
is called to do everything in our power 
to protect the patients to whom we are 
assigned. Each of us pledges to do no 
harm. 
Mr. Speaker, Roe v. Wade directly 
contradicts this oath. Each life is a 
precious gift that is truly worthy of 
our protection. 
As our Nation marks another tragic 
anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I remain 
committed to serving as a steadfast 
voice for the voiceless. As we continue 
this fight, I remain eternally hopeful 
that our Nation will someday value all 
human life for its inherent worth and 
its dignity. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. WATKINS), who represents 
the Second Congressional District. 
Mr. WATKINS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from New Jersey for his 
leadership on this. This Congress is 
better because of it, and this Nation is 
better because of the gentleman’s ef-
forts. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to be a voice for 
the voiceless. There is no effort more 
important than our protecting the 
sanctity of life. As a true political 
freshman, new to Congress and new to 
politics, I was so proud that the first 
bill I put my name on was to defund 
Planned Parenthood. 
Most recently I introduced H.R. 4800, 
the Pro-LIFE Act. My bill would close 
the ‘‘valuable consideration’’ loophole 
by prohibiting the sale of human fetal 
issues. These are unborn babies’ hearts, 
livers, bones, and brains that are used 
in experiments. I urge my colleagues to 
please sign on to my Pro-LIFE Act, 
H.R. 4800. 
May God bless the unborn, and may 
God have mercy on us all. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CLOUD), who is my friend 
and colleague. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, January 22 
marks the 47th anniversary of the 
United States Supreme Court decision, 
Roe v. Wade. On that day, in a historic 
moment of judicial overreach and with-
out legislative action, the Supreme 
Court declared abortion legal in our 
country. Since then 61 million babies 
have been robbed of their right to life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
Today we know much more than we 
did when Roe v. Wade was handed 
down. Decades of scientific advance-
ments have revealed much about the 
development and vitality of the unborn 
child. We know, for example, beyond 
any shadow of a doubt that unborn ba-
bies feel and react to pain at just 20 
weeks, which means, yes, they do feel 
the pain of an abortion. 
Fetal heart rate monitors and 3D 
ultrasounds are commonly used by ex-
pectant mothers today. The use of this 
technology was very limited in 1973, 
but now we know that the sounds of 
heartbeats and images of a moving 
baby reveal one thing to us, and that is 
life. Continued scientific discovery and 
the technological advancements have 
only strengthened the case that the life 
of a child yet to be born is precious. 
I do believe that everyone has a right 
to life and equal protection under the 
law. Thomas Jefferson once said: ‘‘In-
deed I tremble for my country when I 
reflect that God is just, that His jus-
tice cannot sleep forever.’’ 
I pray for God’s mercy on this Na-
tion. And I pray that we in this Cham-
ber and those across our Nation will 
continue to work together to end this 
injustice. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to another gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. WRIGHT), and I thank 
him for sponsoring the Teleabortion 
Prevention Act and the Child Custody 
Protection Act. 
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank Congressman SMITH for his in-
credible leadership on the life issue in 
the Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, 47 years ago the moral 
and religious fabric of the United 
States was tragically torn. As a result 
of the Roe v. Wade decision, 61 million 
unborn children have lost their lives, 
and millions of women and families 
have been torn apart by abortion. I 
promised my constituents that I would 
be a voice for the voiceless in Wash-
ington, and I have no intention of 
breaking that promise. 
Over the past year my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle have time 
and time again blocked legislation that 
protects 
the 
unborn 
and 
women’s 
health. Last year we saw lawmakers 
block the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act over 80 times, ex-
plicitly endorsing infanticide. 
A number of important pro-life bills 
have been introduced in this Congress, 
including, as Mr. SMITH mentioned, my 
Teleabortion Prevention Act and the 
Child Custody Protection Act that pro-
tects young women who are being 
taken across State lines for an abor-
tion. Both have been stalled by par-
tisan politics. 
We also saw lawmakers in New York 
and Virginia cheer legislation that 
would allow abortions in the ninth 
month of pregnancy when most babies 
are viable. This is an outrage. Pro-
tecting the voiceless unborn is one of 
the most significant contributions we 
can make in our lives, and we, as a na-
tion, need to get back to protecting it. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
GUEST), 
who 
rep-
resents the Third Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, Jeremiah 
1:5 states: ‘‘Before I formed you in the 
womb I knew you, before you were born 
I set you apart.’’ 
In the 47 years that have passed since 
Roe v. Wade, over 45 million Americans 
have tragically been robbed of their 
lives through abortion. The fight to 
protect the lives of our unborn chil-
dren, however, has grown stronger 
since Roe v. Wade. 
As we have developed a better under-
standing of the immense consequences 
that abortion inflicts on the mother, 
our society, and, most importantly, the 
child in the womb, individual States, 
including my home State of Mis-
sissippi, have enacted more than 1,000 
preventive laws to protect the unborn. 
As a pro-life Member I am proud to 
join the bipartisan group of Represent-
atives and Senators who have filed an 
amicus brief that outlines the argu-
ments of why Roe v. Wade should be 
overturned. 
I am grateful for the tremendous 
leadership of President Trump and his 
administration to ensure the Federal 
Government’s regulatory efforts to pre-
serve life. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
encourage 
every 
American to join the movement to pro-
tect our unborn children and support 
efforts to defend the right to life.

January 15, 2020 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. WILSON). 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Congressman CHRIS 
SMITH for his dedication and leader-
ship, 
and 
I 
thank 
Congressman 
GROTHMAN from Wisconsin for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, on January 22, 1973, the 
Supreme Court struck down State and 
Federal right-to-life laws in their deci-
sion on Roe v. Wade. Since then over 61 
million unborn children have been 
stripped of their right to life, and our 
country has denied itself future teach-
ers, 
doctors, 
farmers, 
neighbors, 
friends, and loved ones. 
I am grateful to stand with my col-
leagues in Congress to defend the right 
to life for the unborn. In the House we 
have worked to pass commonsense pro- 
life legislation such as H.R. 962, the 
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protec-
tion Act. This bill would give a child 
the right to live if he or she is born 
alive following an abortion or at-
tempted abortion. With over 191 co-
sponsors, this bill has been shamefully 
dropped by House Democrats for a vote 
80 different times. 
Last weekend I attended the Right to 
Life Dinner featuring Governor Henry 
McMaster 
and 
First 
Lady 
Peggy 
McMaster 
and 
appreciated 
partici-
pating 
with 
thousands 
of 
citizens 
across the State for a program emceed 
by Attorney General Alan Wilson at 
the Statehouse in Columbia. 
South Carolina Citizens for Life work 
tirelessly to protect innocent human 
lives, and I appreciate the leadership of 
Lisa Van Riper, Holly Gatling, Alexia 
Newman, 
Karen 
Iacovelli 
Forster, 
Brenda Hucks, and Sally Zaleski for 
their hard work and dedication. 
I look forward to welcoming next 
weekend the participants for the March 
for Life in Washington. Each year tens 
of thousands of students from across 
America will show their appreciation 
of life. 
This year is special in that my oldest 
grandson and namesake, Addison Wil-
son III, will attend with a delegation 
from Holy Trinity Classical Christian 
School of Beaufort, South Carolina. 
b 1915 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
GROTHMAN), my colleague, and also 
CHRIS SMITH for his tireless leadership 
on this. 
In the 47 years since Roe v. Wade, 
more than 60 million unborn children’s 
lives have ended too soon. Life is the 
most fundamental human right, and I 
believe that life begins at conception. 
Science continues to build a case for 
this, 
and 
as 
technology 
develops, 
women are getting a clearer view of the 
lives of their babies when they go to 
the doctor’s office. At just 6 weeks, an 
ultrasound can detect a child’s heart-
beat. At 20 weeks, a baby, we know, can 
feel pain in the womb. Unfortunately, 
many States still allow abortions after 
this stage. 
There is no fooling anyone anymore 
on this. These are true lives inside the 
womb, not just clumps of cells. Science 
and medicine make clear that life ex-
ists in the womb. If this is true, as I be-
lieve it is, those 60 million unborn ba-
bies deserved to have the most basic 
right, the right to live. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank all those pro- 
life freedom fighters who will be here 
this month at the March for Life and 
those who are doing it at home in their 
communities, at those clinics, at those 
pro-life centers. They have to endure a 
lot of harsh rhetoric from people on the 
other side of this. They, indeed, are 
doing the Lord’s work. May God bless 
them, and I thank them for being part 
of this. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. BIGGS), my friend. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the gentleman for yielding and appre-
ciate him sharing his time with us, and 
Representative SMITH for his tireless 
work on this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I am immensely grate-
ful to live in Arizona, a State that 
prioritizes the protection of the un-
born. During my tenure in the Arizona 
State Legislature, we passed dozens of 
pro-life bills. In fact, Arizona was re-
cently named one of the top three pro- 
life States in the Union by Americans 
United for Life. 
I appreciate the efforts of pro-life ad-
vocates across my district who have 
worked tirelessly to help countless 
women choose life for their unborn ba-
bies. The Arizona March for Life is tak-
ing place this weekend in Phoenix, and 
I wish them great success. 
You see, pro-abortion advocates are 
the Luddites of our time. They deny 
the reality of what science has repeat-
edly demonstrated about the unborn. 
There is nothing that we do in Con-
gress that will have efficacy if we 
choose to and fail to protect the most 
innocent among us. 
This Congress, I introduced H.R. 2742, 
the Abortion Is Not Health Care Act, to 
prevent abortions from being consid-
ered a tax-deductible medical expense. 
I have also cosponsored nearly two 
dozen bills seeking to protect the un-
born, including the Pain-Capable Un-
born Child Protection Act, Born-Alive 
Abortion Survivors Protection Act, the 
Defund Planned Parenthood Act, and 
the Heartbeat Protection Act. 
As we are here tonight, I can’t help 
but think of when my wife was preg-
nant and we expected each of our chil-
dren. Even without today’s technology, 
we knew that each of those children 
was special, a unique individual, alive 
and helpless, dependent upon us, and 
that we had a responsibility for their 
safety and well-being. 
How can this Nation, founded under 
the principles and understanding of 
God’s direction and hand in the forma-
tion of this country, how can we expect 
the affirming and continued blessings 
of the Deity, whom we all revere, if we 
continue to sacrifice on the altar of 
selfishness these unborn children? 
Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues 
to end this practice. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I am 
grateful to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN) and the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH) 
for their work in this area. 
Mr. Speaker, there was a time not 
long ago when STEVE KING at the Con-
servative Opportunity Society had a 
young lady named Ramona Trevino 
who came and spoke to us. An extraor-
dinary woman, she was top in her class, 
as I recall, and became pregnant at 16. 
She was encouraged by some to abort 
the child, but she didn’t. She didn’t go 
on to college, and eventually, there 
was an opening for director at a 
Planned Parenthood facility in Sher-
man, Texas, for which she would apply. 
She was thrilled when she had the 
chance to be director. But she had that 
daughter who meant and means so 
much to her, and she was surprised at 
the monthly meetings that the thing 
that was pushed most was not to get 
the number of abortions up, but if they 
would push taking birth control pills 
to the younger girls, then that would 
ensure that they would have revenue 
up from abortions, that the key was 
getting birth control pills to the 
youngest girls. They were more likely 
to miss days and get pregnant, and 
they would come back in for an abor-
tion. 
That was the way they were trained. 
They were trained to encourage the 
young girls that came in: We will keep 
this between us. Your mom can’t be 
trusted, but we can. We will keep your 
secrets, and you can have a very open 
lifestyle and enjoy yourself. If there 
are problems, you come back to me. 
You don’t have to tell your parents. 
That is so destructive to the family. 
It is destructive to the mother-child re-
lationship. It has led to the millions of 
abortions that have been performed, as 
sanctioned by Planned Parenthood. 
One other thing I have to mention 
that struck me so harshly, in the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary, we had a doc-
tor that did late-term abortion. He said 
he did over a thousand of them and 
never thought about it. The mom’s cer-
vix was not dilated so for a late-term 
abortion—and he was very graphic 
about the manner in which you went 
in. 
You 
would 
find 
something 
that 
seemed linear, and it was either an arm 
or a leg. You had to pull it off. Once 
you had done that four times, you had 
to feel for something bulbous, he said, 
and then that had to be crushed. Then, 
you could remove the child. 
After his daughter was tragically 
killed in an accident, he couldn’t do it 
anymore. The thought of pulling a lit-
tle child apart was more than he could 
bear.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H289 
January 15, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, it ought to be more 
than Americans could bear, coming be-
tween a mother and daughter, the 
mother who wants the best for her 
child. It should be unthinkable for a 
loving, 
caring, 
nonabusive 
mother. 
That ought to be unthinkable, but that 
is what is going on. That is what Roe v. 
Wade has led to. 
You may say: Well, you are just a 
guy. What do you know? 
I have defended what some people 
said were indefensible people, and it is 
an honor to stand up and defend a child 
that can’t speak. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
DAVIDSON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. I 
thank my colleagues who have taken 
the time tonight to speak in defense of 
life. 
Next week, a beautiful, peaceful pro-
test will take place here in Wash-
ington, D.C., the March for Life, in 
which not tens but hundreds of thou-
sands of Americans will gather, includ-
ing many from the Eighth District of 
Ohio. 
When I have looked across that vast 
crowd in the past on the National Mall, 
I have been filled with hope for our fu-
ture because the faces in that crowd 
are overwhelmingly young people. The 
younger generations are increasingly 
pro-life. They feel the effects of more 
than 60 million elective abortions car-
ried out in America since 1973. 
These 60 million lives had so much 
potential. They could have been some-
one’s spouse, brother, sister. They 
would have been mothers and fathers 
in their own right, but their lives were 
snuffed out by abortion. 
We should, of course, have compas-
sion for the women whose babies’ lives 
have ended through abortion. Too 
often, they lacked support, been pres-
sured or deceived into a fateful choice 
to end their baby’s life. 
Mr. Speaker, I especially want to 
honor and encourage women like Mya, 
the mother of Ohio State running back 
J.K. Dobbins, who chose life coura-
geously. 
Next week is different. We celebrate 
a different vision, a hopeful, optimistic 
vision. The youth will rise up, and by 
the grace of God, I will be there with 
them to say: It is time to end the abor-
tion culture in America and defend the 
right to life. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from New Jer-
sey (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, in a Florida abortion clinic, 
Sycloria Williams delivered a live baby 
girl at 23 weeks. The clinic owner took 
the baby, who was gasping for air, cut 
her umbilical cord, threw her into a 
biohazard bag, and put the bag in the 
trash. Heartbroken, Sycloria later had 
a funeral for her baby girl, who she 
named Shanice. 
In Sycloria’s home State of Florida, 
in just 1 year, in 2017, 11 babies were 
born 
alive 
during 
abortions. 
Shockingly, only 6 States—Florida, Ar-
izona, Michigan, Minnesota, Oklahoma, 
and Texas—currently require reporting 
of children born alive who survive 
abortion. 
Why the coverup? Dr. Willard Cates, 
the former head of the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention’s Abortion 
Surveillance Unit, said live births ‘‘are 
little known because organized medi-
cine, from fear of public clamor and 
legal action, treats them more as an 
embarrassment to be hushed up than a 
problem to be solved. It is like turning 
yourself in to the IRS,’’ he goes on, 
‘‘for an audit. What is there to gain? 
The tendency is not to report because 
there are only negative incentives.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I would remind my col-
leagues that Philadelphia abortionist 
Kermit Gosnell, one of the few who got 
caught, was convicted for murder, for 
killing children who were born alive 
after attempting abortions. 
The grand jury described it this way: 
‘‘Gosnell had a simple solution for un-
wanted babies he delivered: He killed 
them. He didn’t call it that. He called 
it ‘ensuring fetal demise.’ The way he 
ensured fetal demise was by sticking 
scissors into the back of the baby’s 
neck and cutting the spinal cord. He 
called that ‘snipping.’ ’’ 
Mr. Speaker, we have tried the whole 
year to bring the Born-Alive Abortion 
Survivors Protection Act introduced 
by ANN WAGNER and 191 of us to a vote 
here in this House. I, again, with my 
colleagues, appeal to the leadership: 
These children need protection. The 
unborn children need protection. 
Congressmen ANDY BIGGS and DOUG 
LAMALFA said it so well a few moments 
ago, that we have such a clearer pic-
ture of the unborn as well. Andy said, 
even without today’s technology, he 
and his wife knew there was a baby. 
Ultrasound shatters the myth that an 
unborn child is anything but human, 
alive, and extremely vulnerable. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s protect the chil-
dren. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will 
address a few topics tonight, but before 
I start on these other topics, I, as well, 
will address the March for Life. 
As has been mentioned, we are deal-
ing with the 47th anniversary of Roe v. 
Wade. Hopefully, over 200,000 people 
will be here in Washington next week, 
and I feel bad it is a week where we are 
doing our work back in the district so 
I won’t be able to be here for it. 
It is still kind of amazing that, in 
1973, I think it was seven out of nine 
judges, which is kind of a bad testi-
mony to the law schools of this Nation, 
felt that when our forefathers put to-
gether the Constitution, they felt that 
it, of necessity, made abortion legal in 
this country. I am sure they were not 
talking about it at all at the time, and 
throughout much of our history, abor-
tion has been legal in the vast majority 
of States. 
At the time that Roe v. Wade came 
down, I believe abortion was illegal in 
48 of the 50 States. If not, it was almost 
48 States, and it was just an outlandish 
decision. 
Since the decision has come down, we 
have had over 45 million lives cut short 
because of abortion in this country. 
When you think about 45 million, think 
how large that is. If they were alive 
today, it would be something on the 
order of about one-seventh of the cur-
rent population of this country. But 
our people have voluntarily snuffed out 
that many lives. 
I remember when ultrasounds came 
out and became common. I had as-
sumed that when people began to look 
at ultrasounds, they would see what 
they were dealing with here and abor-
tion would have quickly become ille-
gal. 
b 1930 
It says something about the callous-
ness of our country and the ineffective-
ness of our clergy that, despite the gift 
of ultrasound—so, unlike 60 years ago, 
we all know exactly what is going on— 
our country continues to allow this 
slaughter to continue. 
Even worse, America, which I do be-
lieve should be a shining light on the 
hill, is one of only seven countries 
which allow late-term abortions: our-
selves, Singapore, Canada, Holland, 
Red 
China, 
Vietnam, 
and 
North 
Korea—largely, a pretty embarrassing 
set of countries to be with. 
I hope all Americans stop and ponder 
how America still winds up on such a 
ridiculous list, particularly such a 
wealthy country and a country in 
which so many people have access to 
see exactly what is going on. 
As a matter of fact, recently, things 
have even gotten worse. I am sure my 
colleagues have talked about the bill 
recently signed into law in New York, 
which, in essence, a goal appears to be 
to allow you to snuff out the life of a 
newborn baby right before it is born. 
There is danger that a similar law is 
soon going to pass in Virginia. 
I challenge the clergy in this coun-
try. And I know some of them don’t 
like to say uncomfortable truths, ap-
parently, but I challenge them to do 
something here. 
Somebody just mentioned the movie 
‘‘Gosnell,’’ and there is another movie, 
‘‘Unplanned.’’ I think these are movies 
that would be wise for the clergy in 
this country to make sure people were 
aware of so they saw exactly what was 
going on. 
Obviously, what we have here is kind 
of a silent ending of millions of lives. 
Most people do not know it is going on. 
It doesn’t affect them on a daily basis. 
But it is time for the clergy and 
churches of this country to step up to 
the plate. 
I wish well for all the people who are 
going to come from all over the coun-
try and attend the March for Life. 
KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, there 
are other things I am going to address 
right now, one a little bit related. I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H290 
January 15, 2020 
would like to talk a little bit about the 
Knights of Columbus. 
We live in a society that claims to 
value diversity and tolerance; however, 
sometimes things bubble up in this 
town. It is apparent that some people 
are hated and the intolerance applies 
to them. 
I am speaking, of course, of the fact 
that, about 2 years ago, a little over 2 
years ago now, a U.S. Senator from 
California, in part of a confirmation 
hearing on a Federal judge, decided to 
weigh in and felt that, if you were a 
member of the Knights of Columbus, 
perhaps you shouldn’t become a Fed-
eral judge. 
Recently, rereading the statements 
made there and the lack of outrage at 
what, apparently, was a religious test, 
or close to a religious test, to become 
a Federal judge, I thought I would like 
to talk a little bit about the Knights of 
Columbus, which is very active in my 
district. 
The Knights were founded as a 
Catholic group in 1882, in Connecticut, 
and, currently, there are about 2 mil-
lion Knights, almost exclusive to the 
United States, but there are also some 
in Canada, New Zealand, England—or 
Britain—and a few other countries. 
They have been active during that 
time, and they do a lot to help people. 
They seem almost ubiquitous in my 
district with all the fundraisers they 
have. 
A few weeks ago, I attended a meat 
raffle for the Princeton Knights of Co-
lumbus in which they were helping out 
a Vietnam veteran who had cancer. 
I want to point out that the Knights 
will help out not just Catholic people, 
but people who aren’t Catholic as well. 
The Princeton Knights were also 
doing a chili fundraiser to help a gen-
tleman with prostate cancer. 
Other groups I see around, can be 
seen: the Cedarburg Knights selling 
Tootsie Rolls for Special Olympics or 
pregnancy health centers; the Fond du 
Lac Knights having fish fries for youth 
hockey and handicapped children. 
You see the Neenah Knights running 
concession 
stands 
at 
the 
Packers 
games, the Mayville Knights doing a 
calendar fundraiser for the local food 
pantry, the Oshkosh Knights doing a 
bowling fundraiser for coats for kids, 
or Men for Christ. I mean, you see the 
good works that the Knights are doing 
everywhere. 
I wish I had time to go through all 
the other organizations and list ex-
actly the fundraisers they have. The 
Two Rivers, Manitowoc, Sheboygan, 
Fredonia, Horicon, wherever I go, I see 
the Knights are active helping people 
out. 
I always kind of consider the Knights 
of Columbus kind of like mom and 
apple pie. You know, you could stand 
here in Congress, and Congressmen 
would go out of their way to praise 
groups like the Knights of Columbus 
and be seen with the Knights of Colum-
bus. 
But, apparently, they are not so 
much like mom and apple pie anymore. 
We have had Members of this body, and 
not from small, insignificant States, 
Members of this body apparently now 
feeling that that is something to be at-
tacked for. And, of course, it is not. 
They are helping out at the Special 
Olympics or helping out at youth hock-
ey that has caused them to be hated or 
feel that they shouldn’t be part of the 
public square. It is, of course, that they 
are active in the Catholic church, a 
church that is pro-life, that apparently 
some Members around here feel that 
the Knights of Columbus, therefore, 
should step aside and can’t be trusted 
to make decisions as far as where we 
are going in the United States of Amer-
ica. 
Recently, Joe Biden came out, actu-
ally, and even said that the Senator 
from California would make a great 
Vice President. I mean, can you imag-
ine that? 
Can you imagine, 40 years ago, in 
this country, somebody saying that the 
Knights of Columbus, that a member of 
the Knights maybe shouldn’t be a Fed-
eral judge? 
That is a great thing she says. Let’s 
make her a Vice President. I think 
that is a great thing. 
In any event, speaking on behalf of 
myself, I would like to thank the 
Knights for all they do around the 
Sixth Congressional District. I hope 
they continue to speak out on Chris-
tian issues, on Catholic issues. 
I hope the other clergy, clergy who 
may not be Catholic themselves, real-
ize that they could be next to be tar-
geted by these Members of Congress. 
But, again, I thank the Knights of Co-
lumbus for all they do. 
Mr. Speaker, I guess I have a few 
minutes more here. I have, what, 5 
more minutes? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Wisconsin has 5 minutes 
remaining. 
IMPEACHMENT AND IMMIGRATION 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, we 
spent a lot of time up here, too much 
time on this impeachment thing. I 
think the reason people want to talk 
about impeachment is they don’t like 
to talk about all the things that ought 
to be getting done that Congress isn’t 
doing when they are talking about im-
peachment. 
I want to, one more time, talk about 
what I think is the number one issue 
that is going to destroy America, and 
that is the immigration situation. We 
continue to have people come across 
the border. 
President Trump, on his own, has 
dropped the number of people coming 
in this country from over 50,000 allowed 
in this country and placed in this coun-
try last May to under 1,000 by the Bor-
der Patrol in December. 
Nevertheless, laws should be changed 
quickly to make sure that this does 
not continue, or should be changed 
quickly before some of these Federal 
judges decide to stop President Trump 
from trying to do what he is doing. 
The Congress should be brought in to 
change the credible fear standard to 
make sure everybody under the Sun 
can’t say that they should be a refugee. 
We want to change the laws with re-
gard to the Traffic Victim Protection 
Reparations Act. Right now, so people 
understand, if we get somebody under 
age 18 from Canada or Mexico—from 
Canada or Mexico—we can send them 
back; from other countries, we are 
forced to keep families apart. 
I know President Trump would des-
perately like to return a minor from 
Honduras or Venezuela or Cuba back to 
their parents, but right now he is for-
bidden from doing that because Con-
gress refuses to act. 
We should be cracking down on wel-
fare for illegal immigrants right now, 
which serves as an inducement for the 
most irresponsible of people to come to 
the United States, but Congress doesn’t 
act. 
We have built, or we are soon going 
to build, 100 miles toward the wall, but 
we still need more money. We hope we 
have enough money to get to 450 miles 
by the end of the year. But that is not 
going to be enough, particularly when 
you consider that, right now, the DEA 
thinks that 95 percent of the fentanyl, 
cocaine, heroin, or meth in this coun-
try is coming across our borders. 
I will guarantee you there are people 
who are going back to their districts 
next week and, at their townhalls, are 
claiming that they care about the over 
60,000 people who died last year from 
these drugs, but they aren’t doing any-
thing to enforce that border where 95 
percent of these drugs—fentanyl, co-
caine, heroin, and meth—are coming 
are cross. 
It is time we act there, as well. We 
need more money for what we call non-
intrusive technology so we can deter-
mine when these drugs are coming 
across in cars or otherwise, as well as 
it would be a good thing to get more 
dogs. 
I have been down at the border my-
self and seen how effective they are at 
preventing these drugs from coming 
across that are killing so many people. 
In any event, I hope the rest of the 
public and our mainstream media, as 
well as our conservative media, don’t 
fall apart and don’t fall into the trap of 
being all impeachment all the time 
over the next 3 or 4 months. 
Remember all the people who are 
dying because of the drugs coming 
across the border. Remember the huge 
burden on the United States as more 
people come across the border for 
things such as welfare-type benefits, 
and imagine what type of future Amer-
ica has if we don’t begin to enforce our 
laws. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

AMERICA IS BECOMING MORE 
PRO-LIFE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is 
my privilege and honor to address you 
here on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives. And given that we have 
had some serious discussion here this 
evening, I really appreciate my col-
leagues, CHRIS SMITH and others, who 
have spent an hour addressing the life 
issue here. 
As we come up on the anniversary of 
Roe v. Wade, January 22—I believe that 
is a date that will live in infamy— 
America is becoming a more and more 
pro-life country. And as we watch the 
transition that is taking place in this 
country, that has to do with the March 
for Life that comes out here every 
year, when thousands of people, many, 
many young people ride from my 
neighborhood about 18 or 20 hours on a 
bus to get here, and they gather on The 
Mall for the events and the speeches 
and the rally and then march to the 
Supreme Court building. We often host 
them here with some hot chocolate. 
Each of these years that go by, I 
meet more and more young people that 
have become part of the pro-life net-
work. So the network that is here, it 
strengthens people. They look around 
and they see that they are not alone. 
They come from churches; they come 
from schools; they come from families; 
they come from neighborhoods; and 
they understand that they are not 
alone, that there is a patchwork of peo-
ple that are active across this country 
that is emerging into the majority in 
America. 
I will submit that we are now a ma-
jority pro-life nation, and that would 
be consistent with polling, the Barna 
poll that we did about, I suppose, a 
year and a half ago or a little more 
that showed that, just on the Heart-
beat bill alone, which I happen to be 
the author of, H.R. 490, that we saw 61 
percent support for the Heartbeat bill, 
without exceptions. Republicans were 
up at about 85 or 86 percent; independ-
ents were around in the 60th percentile; 
and Democrats are even in support of 
it, in the majority, at 59 percent of 
Democrats. 
So it may have been that America 
was a little bit ignorant about the be-
ginning of life and the science of life 
and the moment that life begins, but 
we all knew that in our hearts when, in 
1973, it was one thing, and it was a po-
litical agenda that was driven. 
And Norma McCorvey regretted that 
she happened to be Jane Roe. So she 
actually didn’t get an abortion, and she 
became pro-life in her later years and 
became a pro-life activist. 
So it didn’t serve her, and it surely 
didn’t serve America. But some number 
of over 61 million American babies 
have been aborted since that period of 
time. 
And there have been struggles in this 
city. There have been women that 
come to this city and march for abor-
tion, and so many women who come 
and march for life. 
But here is what I see. In 1976, Mr. 
Speaker, our firstborn child came into 
the world; and, of course I anticipated 
that with eager and nervous anticipa-
tion. 
But when that little boy—actually, 
not so little. He was almost 9 pounds. 
When he went into my hands and my 
arms and I looked at him and I held 
him in awe at the miracle that he was 
and is today, it was just stunning to 
me that, from my wife, Marilyn, and I 
came this little baby, this miracle. 
To look at him, to look in his eyes, 
to see his dark hair, and he turned out 
to be a blue-eyed, dark-haired little 
guy, and he had a lot of hair on his 
head, and it was just such a miracle to 
see and count the fingers and toes and 
look how perfectly they were formed. 
b 1945 
As he lay in his crib, I would sit and 
look at him, and there was an aura 
about that little baby boy. There was 
an aura about him. And you could have 
convinced me that he was the second 
coming of Jesus Christ, that is how 
strong that was to me, that little boy 
miracle. 
As I looked at that, I thought this 
little guy here, how could anybody 
take his life now in these first minutes 
of his life or how could someone take 
his life the minute before he was born 
or the hour before or the day before he 
was born or the week or the month or 
the trimester, the first, second, or 
third trimester? 
And I just thought that through as I 
held that little miracle in my hands, 
and I knew that this life was precious 
and a miracle the moment that I could 
hold him and touch him and see him 
and feel that warmth and smell that 
fresh baby smell on him. And within 
minutes I went back through this proc-
ess of development of this miracle from 
the moment of conception until birth. 
And at that moment I knew that you 
couldn’t take that little baby’s life at 
any point in this stage. I knew that his 
life began at the moment of concep-
tion. And from that moment on this 
miracle and millions and millions of 
other miracles needed to be protected 
from that moment on, that life begins 
at the moment of conception. That was 
1976. 
Twenty years later I went out to San 
Diego to the Republican National Con-
vention, and certainly I had all of my 
colors on and all the things that are at-
tached to your lapels and your delega-
tion credentials that are out there. 
And on a Thursday afternoon at 3:00 I 
see on the tri-fold schedule there that 
said Christian Women for Choice are 
gathering there in San Diego at a loca-
tion about a block and a half away 
from the convention center. 
Something called me internally and 
said, you have to go down there and see 
what is going on. I was curious. What 
scripture would be quoted to me from 
Christian Women for Choice? I took a 
friend with me and we went down and 
found this area. It was about an acre, I 
suppose, in size, maybe a little less, 
chain-link fence all the way around, 
stage in the middle, big old speakers up 
there and microphones. There were 
people still milling around, but there 
wasn’t a program going on on the stage 
at that point. 
I went to an individual that looked 
like he was at least associated with 
somebody in charge and I asked him 
who was the leader of this and who is 
the head of the Christian Women for 
Choice. And he said, that is my wife, 
and he pointed to her and took me over 
and introduced me. We ended up on the 
stage. And as that conversation began, 
it became a debate. 
And I remember there in San Diego, 
for every delegate—I remember the 
number they told me—there was as 
many as 15,000 press in that city to 
cover the convention. 
So we had quite a lot of press in that 
protest zone where they would be look-
ing for controversy. So the leader of 
Christian Women for Choice and I went 
at it in kind of a no-holds barred de-
bate that just clashed back and forth 
between us. And several of the others 
would chime in for her, and every once 
in a while her husband would put his 
chin up over her shoulder, and he 
would bark some things at me, too. 
Mr. Speaker, I was far enough from 
home and convicted enough, having 
enough conviction for those that don’t 
understand what that means, that I 
could just unload all of the things that 
needed to be said in the middle of that 
debate. 
She began to demand that we go out 
and collect the billions of dollars in 
child support that is owed by deadbeat 
dads is what she called them. And I 
said, I am happy to do that. I think 
they need to pay their child support, 
and I will be working to do that—it 
turned out in the Iowa Senate for 
starters—but you can’t make that

claim because that father doesn’t have 
anything to say about whether that 
child is going to be born or not. If the 
mother is the only one that has any-
thing to say, then when that child is 
born you don’t have the claim that the 
father needs to pay the child support. 
Save the baby’s life, protect this baby, 
and then we can hold the father to this. 
I am happy to do that. You don’t have 
any claim to that, because you don’t 
give the father any say in whether that 
baby is going to be born or not. 
And what I didn’t hear anybody say 
here in this pro-life discussion that we 
had is the pain that a father goes 
through when the mother decides to 
abort the baby. I know people who have 
gone through that pain and that agony, 
and they were helpless to do anything 
about it. They want the baby. They 
say, I will raise the baby. It is mine. 
This is my flesh and blood. Give birth 
to this baby and I will take care of this 
baby for life. And when the mother 
says no, sometimes it is even a spiteful 
act. And I have had that happen close 
enough to me that I know that to be 
fact as well, Mr. Speaker. 
But in that debate with the head of 
Christian Women for Choice in San 
Diego in 1996 two things came out of 
that. Sometimes when you are tested 
under fire you get to a place where the 
principles are tempered to a point 
where they are no longer negotiable 
and they are as rock solid as they can 
be. 
Now 
I 
stand 
in 
auditoriums 
in 
schools K through 12, wherever the sit-
uation might be, and I will say to 
them, ‘‘One day in your lives you will 
have this question come up around 
you, whether it is you asking the ques-
tion or whether it is a friend of yours, 
acquaintance, or a relation, and it will 
be the question of abortion. Here are 
the two things you need to know’’—and 
I will ask this question first, I will say, 
‘‘Is human life sacred in all of its 
forms?’’ And they look a little bit 
slightly confused about what does ‘‘all 
of its forms’’ mean. And I say, ‘‘Look 
at the person next to you. You are sit-
ting next to one of your friends. Is that 
person’s life sacred?’’ And they are 
looking at you, Is your life sacred? And 
they will nod their heads and say, 
‘‘Yes, our lives are sacred.’’ I say, ‘‘So 
if you believe that human life is sacred, 
then is there any form of human life 
that is not sacred?’’ How about some-
one that is a paraplegic, a quadriplegic, 
someone who is incapable of func-
tioning verbally or getting up and mov-
ing in any way; is that person’s life sa-
cred? I say, yes, and so do they. They 
recognize that we have to have passion 
and compassion for all human beings. 
And so then once you establish that 
human life is sacred in all of its forms, 
then I say to them: Now you only have 
to ask one other question and that is, 
at what moment does life begin? Does 
it begin a week after birth? Does it 
begin the day after birth? Does it begin 
the minute after birth? That doesn’t 
make sense to anybody in that gym-
nasium. These are young people, but 
they understand some things that seem 
to be confused over here some days, 
Mr. Speaker. 
I say to them, ‘‘What about that baby 
a minute before the baby is born, is 
that life?’’ And some of them might 
look a little confused, but most of 
them know it is life. But I will say, But 
how about the week before? How about 
the month before? How about if that 
baby is born by cesarean, when does 
that baby become alive? Is it the mo-
ment the mother is opened up by the 
surgeon in cesarean and that baby is 
brought forward? How could that be? 
We take it back to the moment of 
conception. We say even more accu-
rately, the moment of fertilization, but 
the moment of conception. 
We get to this place where most 
every young person in that gathering 
understands human life is sacred in all 
of its forms. It has to be the highest 
value that we have, and that it begins 
at a moment and the only moment 
that exists is the moment of concep-
tion. From there on out it is a matter 
of continuum and continual growth 
and continual cell division, continual 
metabolism getting to the point where 
that baby is in a condition to be able to 
live outside the womb. And then we 
nurture that baby, up on that baby’s 
feet, we nurture that baby all the way 
through until that baby is in a condi-
tion where they can take care of them-
selves and eventually take care of their 
own parents and their own children. 
That is life. It is precious. 
If you sit around in a household in a 
family, especially when we go through 
the 
holidays 
that 
we 
have 
gone 
through, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and 
New Year’s, where families gather to-
gether and you watch with joy as they 
interact with each other, and you know 
there might be in some of these 
homes—you know there are—there is 
grandpa’s empty chair over in the cor-
ner, he is gone now. He is missed. 
There is a vacancy in the chair and 
there is a vacuum in the family be-
cause maybe grandpa or grandma has 
been such a big part of that family, but 
they still cherish the joy that they 
have shared. They don’t often lay an 
empty cradle there in the living room 
for that baby that was aborted, but 
that is also the soul and the spirit that 
is not there to share in that family joy 
as well. 
This Nation has aborted 61-plus mil-
lion babies. The back of the envelope 
calculation says that if half of them 
were girls and you look at the fre-
quency of abortion going back to 1973 
in the years that these women would 
be having babies you can easily get to 
the place where we are not just missing 
61 million—I say that; it sounds odd 
even as I say it—we are not missing 61 
million, as appalling and as ghastly as 
that is, we are probably missing an-
other 61 million of the babies that were 
never born because their mothers were 
aborted. Add it up. Call it 120 million. 
Round it back to 100 million. 
Here we are in this country, we have 
aborted a workforce of 100 million. And 
I hear over here, well, we have to im-
port people into America. We have to 
have cheap foreign labor because, after 
all, the total fertility rate is low 
enough in America. We are not replac-
ing ourselves, and we are not raising 
enough workers to fill the gap. 
I recall in the Iowa Senate there was 
a bill to require each health insurance 
policy to cover contraceptives and the 
female State Senators made this argu-
ment—back then we were at a full em-
ployment 
workforce 
as 
well, 
Mr. 
Speaker, as full as it is right now. 
Right now we are kind of knocking on 
the door of the lowest unemployment 
we have had in Iowa. Well, we had that 
back in about 1997 or 1998, as well. 
Some of the State Senators went off to 
the women’s State legislators gath-
ering, and they came back with this 
idea that was going to spread all over 
the country: every health insurance 
policy has to cover contraceptives. 
Here is the argument they made: They 
said, with this short workforce that we 
have, this full employment economy 
we have, we can’t afford to have women 
missing work because they are preg-
nant and having babies and taking care 
of babies. And back then I said, Who is 
going to do the work in the next gen-
eration or two if we don’t have babies 
being born now? How do you fill that 
gap? It seemed to me to be a simple 
equation that I had raised, but yet 
their agenda worked opposite it. 
We need to remember, this Nation 
has sinned, and this sin of abortion 
weighs on the conscience of a country, 
a country that could well have 100 mil-
lion more American babies born here, 
raised here, learning our civilization, 
learning our culture, learning our his-
tory, learning our language, sharing 
and growing an even greater Nation 
than we are today. And the recovery of 
that is heavy. 
Even when we end this ghastly prac-
tice of aborting babies, innocent, un-
born human life, we have a long way to 
go to ever get back to where nature 
would have had us if we hadn’t inter-
fered with abortion. 
It troubles me a great deal. And one 
of the things I have done is drafted and 
introduced the Heartbeat Protection 
Act. That is H.R. 490. What it does is it 
protects any baby with a heartbeat. In 
fact, it says this: If a heartbeat can be 
detected, the baby is protected. It is 
really that simple. And so it requires 
that if an abortionist is preparing to 
perform his trade, he must first do an 
ultrasound. If that ultrasound produces 
a heartbeat, then that is the first cer-
tain physical sign of life in the womb, 
a heartbeat, and that is about 6 weeks 
into pregnancy. We don’t punish the 
mother. We do punish the so-called 
physician, the abortionist. If a heart-
beat can be detected, the baby is pro-
tected. And in the last Congress we 
took it to 174 cosponsors. 
Mr. Speaker, it protects every baby 
because it is innocent, unborn human

life. These sacred souls, and I believe 
that God places a soul in that little 
baby at the moment of conception. But 
their sacred, little souls, we protect all 
of them. 
There has been some discussion here 
in this Congress and around the coun-
try about exceptions for rape and in-
cest. This bill doesn’t have exceptions 
for rape and incest. We had the votes to 
pass it off the floor of the House in the 
previous Congress a little more than a 
year ago, and we had the votes to sus-
tain it going through the Judiciary 
Committee in the previous Congress a 
little more than a year ago. We didn’t 
get this to the markup in Judiciary. 
We had a hearing, we didn’t get it to 
markup, and therefore, we didn’t get it 
to the floor. I fear that we have failed 
an opportunity that we could have sent 
a very strong message over to the Sen-
ate, which likely would not have taken 
it up. 
But to the rest of America, that hav-
ing exceptions for rape or incest says 
that those babies are not precious. I 
argue that they are as precious to God 
as my own grandchildren are precious 
to me. There cannot be a legal distinc-
tion between a baby that is born as a 
result of conception that comes from 
rape or that comes from incest. In fact, 
they are as precious as any others. 
In this legislation, H.R. 490, if we 
were to incorporate exceptions for rape 
and incest what we would have instead 
would be exceptions that the Court 
could look at and say, Just a minute. 
What about equal protection under the 
law? If there is going to be equal pro-
tections for all persons, whether born 
or unborn, then if there are exceptions 
for unborn persons that are the result 
of the act of rape or incest, then 
doesn’t the Court look at that and con-
clude that we are inconsistent and that 
the equal protection clause really 
doesn’t apply and that Congress didn’t 
apply the equal protection clause to all 
of the unborn? 
b 2000 
We must protect all of them, Mr. 
Speaker. 
From a moral standpoint, it is the 
right thing to do. From a legal and an-
alytical standpoint, and with an antici-
pation of a court that would one day 
see this legislation—I would never sue 
on this, but you know the other side 
will—we have to make sure that we are 
consistent and that we are legally 
sound without exceptions for rape and 
incest. 
Furthermore, if you have incest that 
is taking place in a family, if you allow 
abortions for incest, that means that 
the family member that is perpetrating 
incest on usually the innocent young 
girl gets a pass each time there is an 
abortion because there is not evidence 
of his crime. 
But if you prohibit abortions for the 
sake of incest, you are likely to un-
cover the crime of the family member 
that is abusing, generally, the young 
lady within the family. 
So I am grateful for my colleagues, 
that they came here and each one of 
them spoke up with passion for inno-
cent, unborn human life. 
We will get there one day. Just like 
Dr. Martin Luther King said: I may not 
get there with you, but we are going to 
get there. 
We will be a pro-life nation by law, 
and we will recognize these lives from 
the moment they are conceived within 
the womb. 
Mr. Speaker, I will conclude the com-
ponent of this discussion on the life 
issue. Again, I thank my colleagues for 
the work that they do. 
CORRECT THE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I just 
wanted to make a short comment here 
on another circumstance that has 
taken place in this Congress, and it 
works out like this, that a year ago 
last week, an unprecedented action 
took place in this Congress, and that 
was I did an interview with The New 
York Times, and I was misquoted in 
The New York Times. 
That quote, some people would say 
that, well, it was an organic, sponta-
neous eruption of social media and 
print media. I say, instead, no, it was 
an organized effort to set this up and 
create a railroaded firestorm against 
me. 
I knew that that was going to take 
place, and I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, 
why I know that. And that is, even 
though there was a nearly perfect 
storm created against me in the pre-
vious election, and we emerged from 
that with a victory, after the election 
and before Christmas of 2018, a very 
highly placed and respected political 
operative said to me they are going to 
try again. They have chosen a mes-
senger to go to the President, and this 
messenger has the President’s ear. 
The messenger is to convince the 
President to send out a negative tweet 
on me, and that negative tweet is sup-
posedly going to trigger the worst 
firestorm of media assault on me that 
could possibly be unleashed, and that 
they would make that try again in that 
way. 
Well, I preempted that at the White 
House to the extent I could, and I be-
lieve that was successful. In fact, I 
have no doubt that that was successful. 
Then, by January 8 of last year, I was 
able to get a meeting with that mes-
senger, who said, ‘‘I would never do 
that to you, Steve,’’ but that also let 
the messenger know that I knew what 
the strategy was and what the attempt 
would be. I let them know that I am 
going to blow this thing wide open and 
tell the public what was going on if 
they made that effort. 
That was on January 8. That sent the 
message through, perhaps, to any plan-
ners and strategists that I knew what 
was up. 
The very next day, a State senator 
announced that he would challenge me 
in a primary. That was at 11:23 a.m. He 
had no media planned. He had no 
website. He had no activities or any 
kind of evidence that he was planning 
to run that was at least on paper. Still, 
he announced by Twitter that he was 
going to run against me. 
He was also scheduled to swear in to 
the next General Assembly, the Iowa 
General Assembly, on the following 
Monday, about 4 days later. The most 
improbable time for anyone to an-
nounce they are going to run in a pri-
mary against a seated Member of Con-
gress was that day, but he did that that 
day anyway. 
I let the messenger know I knew 
what was up. The next day, I get a pri-
mary opponent. The following day, The 
New York Times story came out, and 
the rest is history, Mr. Speaker, The 
New York Times with the misquote in 
it. 
There is no tape. It is his word 
against mine. He has notes, he says. He 
admits there is no tape. He has notes, 
he says, but he won’t divulge even the 
question that he would say that he 
asked me. 
So I made the point here on the floor, 
that if I had uttered those words, it 
would have been in repetition to a 
question he asked me. But I often de-
fend Western civilization. I never have 
uttered those words, those two odious 
ideologies. One of them is on this chart 
right here. 
When I gave the answer that ques-
tioned the definition here of what is 
this, white nationalism, what is it, I 
said: It might have meant something 
different 1 or 2 or 3 years ago, but 
today it implies racist. 
Well, what did it mean before that? 
We 
went 
back 
to 
the 
year 
2000, 
LexisNexis, and it was virtually un-
used. You can see all the way along 
here. 
Mr. Speaker, I will describe it be-
cause you can’t actually see it, but I 
can. 
All the way along here, you can see 
that it is virtually unused until you 
get to 2016, and then this term was used 
10,000-plus times, then 30,000. It is still 
up at 20,000 times, so 2016, 2017, and 
2018. 
I could not have been more accurate 
when I said: It might have meant some-
thing different 1, 2, or 3 years ago. 
This is in 2018: 1, 2, or 3 years ago. 
What did it mean here, when nobody 
was using it? That is a hard definition 
to come up with because it is not in 
this big dictionary over here. You can’t 
look up two words together and find 
out what they mean by looking in a 
dictionary. 
That is the annual records, Mr. 
Speaker. So we looked into 2016 and 
asked the question: When did this jump 
up? Well, it jumped up right here in the 
month of November and then up there 
pretty high yet in December 2016. 
What happened in November? Two 
things: Donald Trump was elected 
President and the Democrats gathered 
at the Mandarin Occidental Hotel to 
plan a strategy and what they were 
going to do to prevent him from being 
an effective President.

H294 
January 15, 2020 
Then we broke the month down, and 
here is what we have. November 14 and 
15, the time that George Soros and the 
Democratic leaders were in the Man-
darin Occidental Hotel planning a 
strategy. Well, was it a weaponization 
strategy of the term ‘‘white nation-
alism’’? You bet, right there. 
That is what happened, Mr. Speaker. 
So 
they 
launched 
that 
as 
a 
weaponization, and they used it as a 
weapon against me. 
When I stated those words here on 
the floor of the House of Representa-
tives, I said there is a pause between 
the two odious ideologies and ‘‘Western 
civilization.’’ I made that case, and 
then I demonstrated that significant 
pause. 
Even though we have the best stenog-
raphers, I believe, in the world here, 
and they have been great for me to 
work with, it came out with exactly 
the same mispunctuation that The New 
York Times had. 
So I have introduced the bill called 
H. Res. 789 to correct the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD to at least reflect what 
the C–SPAN video shows that I said. 
Now, it also demonstrates that if 
these excellent people here can end up 
with that punctuation, it is pretty easy 
to explain what happened to The New 
York Times. 
Meanwhile, there have been only four 
people in the history of the United 
States Congress who have been re-
moved from their committees. Three of 
them are either Federal felons or con-
fessed Federal—they have been con-
victed of Federal felonies or confessed 
to Federal felonies, three of them. 
And me? There is not even a rule 
that I violated. It is just simply the 
will and the whim and the bloodlust of 
a political lynch mob, and that has 
been going on for over a year now 
today. And it is going to end, and I am 
not going to wait until this next year 
goes by and have to win another elec-
tion and make a case. 
Furthermore, the term ‘‘white na-
tionalist’’ had never been consciously 
even uttered on the floor of the House 
of Representatives since 1789 all the 
way up until the time that Donald 
Trump was elected President or George 
Soros led this situation at the Man-
darin Occidental Hotel. 
So this resolution, H. Res. 789, is filed 
and cosponsors are signing on to it. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
an article from Politico. 
[From POLITICO, Nov. 14, 2016] 
SOROS BANDS WITH DONORS TO RESIST 
TRUMP, ‘TAKE BACK POWER’ 
(By Kenneth P. Vogel) 
MAJOR
LIBERAL
FUNDERS
HUDDLE
BEHIND 
CLOSED DOORS WITH PELOSI, WARREN, ELLI-
SON, AND UNION BOSSES TO LICK WOUNDS, RE-
TRENCH. 
George Soros and other rich liberals who 
spent tens of millions of dollars trying to 
elect Hillary Clinton are gathering in Wash-
ington for a three-day, closed door meeting 
to retool the big-money left to fight back 
against Donald Trump. 
The conference, which kicked off Sunday 
night at Washington’s pricey Mandarin Ori-
ental hotel, is sponsored by the influential 
Democracy Alliance donor club, and will in-
clude appearances by leaders of most leading 
unions and liberal groups, as well as darlings 
of the left such as House Democratic leader 
Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and 
Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair-
man Keith Ellison, according to an agenda 
and other documents obtained by POLITICO. 
The meeting is the first major gathering of 
the institutional left since Trump’s shocking 
victory over Hillary Clinton in last week’s 
presidential election, and, if the agenda is 
any indication, liberals plan full-on trench 
warfare against Trump from Day One. Some 
sessions deal with gearing up for 2017 and 
2018 elections, while others focus on thwart-
ing President-elect Trump’s 100-day plan, 
which the agenda calls ‘‘a terrifying assault 
on President Obama’s achievements—and 
our progressive vision for an equitable and 
just nation.’’ 
Yet the meeting also comes as many lib-
erals are reassessing their approach to poli-
tics—and the role of the Democracy Alli-
ance, or DA, as the club is known in Demo-
cratic finance circles. The DA, its donors and 
beneficiary groups over the last decade have 
had a major hand in shaping the institutions 
of the left, including by orienting some of its 
key organizations around Clinton, and by 
basing their strategy around the idea that 
minorities and women constituted a so- 
called ‘‘rising American electorate’’ that 
could tip elections to Democrats. 
That didn’t happen in the presidential elec-
tion, where Trump won largely on the 
strength of his support from working-class 
whites. Additionally, exit polls suggested 
that issues like fighting climate change and 
the role of money in politics—which the 
DA’s beneficiary groups have used to try to 
turn out voters—didn’t resonate as much 
with the voters who carried Trump to vic-
tory. 
‘‘The DA itself should be called into ques-
tion,’’ said one Democratic strategist who 
has been active in the group and is attending 
the meeting. ‘‘You can make a very good 
case it’s nothing more than a social club for 
a handful wealthy white donors and labor 
union officials to drink wine and read 
memos, as the Democratic Party burns down 
around them.’’ 
Another liberal operative who has been ac-
tive in the DA since its founding rejected the 
notion that the group—or the left, more gen-
erally—needed to completely retool its ap-
proach to politics. 
‘‘We should not learn the wrong lesson 
from this election,’’ said the operative, 
pointing out that Clinton is on track to win 
the popular vote and that Trump got fewer 
votes than the last GOP presidential nomi-
nee, Mitt Romney. ‘‘We need our people to 
vote in greater numbers. For that to happen, 
we need candidates who inspire them to go 
to the polls on Election Day.’’ 
But Gara LaMarche, the president of the 
DA, on Sunday evening told donors gathered 
at the Mandarin for a welcome dinner that 
some reassessment was in order. According 
to prepared remarks he provided to POLIT-
ICO, he said, ‘‘You don’t lose an election you 
were supposed to win, with so much at stake, 
without making some big mistakes, in as-
sumptions, strategy and tactics.’’ 
LaMarche added that the reassessment 
‘‘must take place without recrimination and 
fingerpointing, 
whatever 
frustration 
and 
anger some of us feel about our own allies in 
these efforts,’’ and he said ‘‘It is a process we 
should not rush, even as we gear up to resist 
the Trump administration.’’ 
LaMarche emailed the donors last week 
that the meeting would begin the process of 
assessing ‘‘what steps we will take together 
to resist the assaults that are coming and 
take back power, beginning in the states in 
2017 and 2018.’’ 
In addition to sessions focusing on pro-
tecting Obamacare and other pillars of 
Obama’s 
legacy 
against 
dismantling 
by 
President-elect Trump, the agenda includes 
panels on rethinking polling and the left’s 
approach to winning the working-class vote, 
as well as sessions stressing the importance 
of channeling cash to state legislative policy 
battles and races, where Republicans won big 
victories last week. 
Democrats need to invest more in training 
officials and developing policies in the 
states, argued Rep. Ellison (D–Minn.) on a 
Friday afternoon donor conference call, ac-
cording to someone on the call. The call was 
organized by a DA-endorsed group called the 
State Innovation Exchange (or SiX), which 
Ellison urged the donors to support. 
Ellison, who is scheduled to speak on a 
Monday afternoon panel at the DA meeting 
on the challenge Democrats face in winning 
working-class votes, has been a leading lib-
eral voice for a form of economic populism 
that Trump at times channeled more than 
Clinton. 
As liberals look to rebuild the post-Clinton 
Democratic Party on a more aggressively 
liberal bearing, Ellison has emerged as a top 
candidate to take over the Democratic Na-
tional Committee, and he figures to be in 
high demand at the DA meeting. An Ellison 
spokesman did not immediately respond to a 
request for comment on Sunday evening. Nor 
did a Trump spokesman. 
Raj Goyle, a New York Democratic activist 
who previously served in the Kansas state 
legislature and now sits on SiX’s board, ar-
gued that many liberal activists and donors 
are ‘‘disconnected from working class voters’ 
concerns’’ because they’re cluster in coastal 
cities. ‘‘And that hurt us this election,’’ said 
Goyle, who is involved in the DA, and said 
its donors would do well to steer more cash 
to groups on the ground in landlocked states. 
‘‘Progressive donors and organizations need 
to immediately correct the lack of invest-
ment in state and local strategies.’’ 
The Democracy Alliance was launched 
after the 2004 election by Soros, the late in-
surance mogul Peter Lewis, and a handful of 
fellow Democratic mega-donors who had 
combined to spend tens of millions trying to 
boost then-Sen. John Kerry’s ultimately un-
successful 
challenge 
to 
then-President 
George W. Bush. 
The donors’ goal was to seed a set of advo-
cacy groups and think tanks outside the 
Democratic Party that could push the party 
and its politicians to the left while also de-
fending them against attack from the right. 
The group requires its members—a group 
that now numbers more than 100 and in-
cludes finance titans like Soros, Tom Steyer 
and Donald Sussman, as well as major labor 
unions and liberal foundations—to con-
tribute a total of at least $200,000 a year to 
recommended groups. Members also pay an-
nual dues of $30,000 to fund the DA staff and 
its meetings, which include catered meals 
and entertainment (on Sunday, interested 
donors were treated to a VIP tour of the re-
cently opened National Museum of African 
American History and Culture). 
Since its inception in 2005, the DA has 
steered upward of $500 million to a range of 
groups, including pillars of the political left 
such as the watchdog group Media Matters, 
the policy advocacy outfit Center for Amer-
ican Progress and the data firm Catalist—all 
of which are run by Clinton allies who are 
expected to send representatives to the DA 
meeting. 
The degree to which those groups will be 
able to adapt to the post-Clinton Democratic 
Party is not entirely clear, though some of 
the key DA donors have given generously to 
them for years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H295 
January 15, 2020 
That includes Soros, who, after stepping 
back a bit from campaign-related giving in 
recent years, had committed or donated $25 
million to boosting Clinton and other Demo-
cratic candidates and causes in 2016. During 
the presidential primaries, Soros had argued 
that Trump and his GOP rival Ted Cruz were 
‘‘doing the work of ISIS.’’ 
A Soros spokesman declined to comment 
for this story. 
But, given that the billionaire financier 
only periodically attends DA meetings and is 
seldom a part of the formal proceedings, his 
scheduled Tuesday morning appearance as a 
speaker suggests that he’s committed to in-
vesting in opposing President Trump. 
The agenda item for a Tuesday morning 
‘‘conversation with George Soros’’ invokes 
Soros’ personal experience living through 
the Holocaust and Soviet Communism in the 
context of preparing for a Trump presidency. 
The agenda notes that the billionaire cur-
rency trader, who grew up in Hungary, ‘‘has 
lived through Nazism and Communism, and 
has devoted his foundations to protecting 
the kinds of open societies around the world 
that are now threatened in the United States 
itself.’’ 
LaMarche, who for years worked for 
Soros’s Open Society foundations, told PO-
LITICO that the references to Nazism and 
Communism are ‘‘part of his standard bio.’’ 
LaMarche, who is set to moderate the dis-
cussion with Soros, said the donor ‘‘does not 
plan to compare whatever we face under 
Trump to Nazism, I can tell you that.’’ 
LaMarche he also said, ‘‘I don’t think there 
is anyone who has looked at Trump, includ-
ing 
many 
respected 
conservatives, 
who 
doesn’t think the experience of authoritarian 
states would not be important to learn from 
here. And to the extent that Soros and his 
foundations have experience with xeno-
phobia in Europe, Brexit, etc., we want to 
learn from that as well.’’ 
The Soros conversation was added to the 
agenda after Election Day. It was just one of 
many changes made on the fly to adjust for 
last week’s jarring result and the stark new 
reality facing liberals, who went from dis-
cussing ways to push an incoming President 
Clinton leftward, to instead discussing how 
to play defense. 
A pre-election working draft of the DA’s 
agenda, obtained by POLITICO, featured a 
session on Clinton’s first 100 days and an-
other on ‘‘moving a progressive national pol-
icy agenda in 2017.’’ Those sessions were re-
branded so that the first instead will exam-
ine ‘‘what happened’’ on the ‘‘cataclysm of 
Election Day,’’ while the second will focus 
on ‘‘combating the massive threats from 
Trump and Congress in 2017.’’ 
A session that before the election had been 
titled ‘‘Can Our Elections Be Hacked,’’ after 
the election was renamed ‘‘Was the 2016 Elec-
tion Hacked’’—a theory that has percolated 
without evidence on the left to explain the 
surprising result. 
In his post-election emails to donors and 
operatives, 
LaMarche 
acknowledged 
the 
group had to ‘‘scrap many of the original 
plans for the conference,’’ explaining ‘‘while 
we made no explicit assumptions about the 
outcome, the conference we planned, and the 
agenda you have seen, made more sense in 
the event of a Hillary Clinton victory.’’ 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I will 
conclude my remarks, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.

PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY 
MATERIAL 
STATUS REPORT ON CURRENT LEVELS OF ON- 
BUDGET SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR FY 2020 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, 
Washington, DC, January 15, 2020. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: To facilitate appli-
cation of sections 302 and 311 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974, I am transmitting 
an updated status report on the current lev-
els of on-budget spending and revenues for 
fiscal year 2020. This status report is current 
through January 3, 2020, the end of the first 
session of the 116th Congress. The term ‘‘cur-
rent level’’ refers to the amounts of spending 
and revenues estimated for each fiscal year 
based on laws enacted or awaiting the Presi-
dent’s signature. 
Table 1 compares the current levels of 
total budget authority, outlays, and reve-
nues to the overall limits filed in the Con-
gressional Record on May 3, 2019, as ad-
justed, for fiscal year 2020 and for the 10-year 
period of fiscal years 2020 through 2029. These 
comparisons are needed to implement sec-
tion 311(a) of the Congressional Budget Act 
of 1974, which establishes a rule enforceable 
with a point of order against measures that 
would breach the budget resolution’s aggre-
gate levels. The table does not show budget 
authority and outlays for years after fiscal 
year 2020 because appropriations for those 
years have not yet been completed. 
Table 2 compares the current levels of 
budget authority and outlays for legislative 
action completed by each authorizing com-
mittee with the limits filed in the Congres-
sional Record on May 3, 2019, for fiscal year 
2020, and for the 10-year period of fiscal years 
2020 through 2029. These comparisons are 
needed to enforce the point of order under 
section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget 
Act of 1974, which prohibits the consider-
ation of measures that would breach the sec-
tion 302(a) allocation of new budget author-
ity for the committee that reported the 
measure. It is also needed to implement sec-
tion 311(c), which provides an exception for 
committees that comply with their alloca-
tions from the point of order under section 
311(a). 
Table 3 compares the current status of dis-
cretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2020 
with the section 302(b) suballocations of dis-
cretionary budget authority and outlays 
among Appropriations subcommittees. The 
comparison is needed to enforce section 
302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 
because the point of order under that section 
equally applies to measures that would 
breach the applicable section 302(b) sub-
allocation. The table also provides supple-
mentary information on spending authorized 
in excess of the base discretionary spending 
limits under section 251(b) of the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act 
of 1985. 
Table 4 displays the current level of ad-
vance appropriations in fiscal year 2020 ap-
propriations bills. This table is needed to en-
force a rule against appropriations bills con-
taining advance appropriations that: (i) are 
not identified in the statement of the Chair-
man published in the Congressional Record 
on May 3, 2019 or (ii) would cause the aggre-
gate amount of such appropriations to ex-
ceed the level specified in section 2 of H. Res. 
293. 
In addition, a letter from the Congres-
sional Budget Office is attached that sum-
marizes and compares the budget impact of 
legislation enacted after the adoption of the 
budget resolution against the budget resolu-
tion aggregate in force. 
If you have any questions, please contact 
Jennifer Wheelock or Raquel Spencer. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN YARMUTH, 
Chairman.

a Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and 
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $567 million in budget authority and $798 million in estimated outlays. 
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the House, the resolution, as approved by the House of Representatives, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a 
result, amounts in this current level report do not include those items. 
c In the House of Representatives, and pursuant to section 314(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, amounts designated as an emergency requirement shall not count for purposes of title III and title IV of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974, and are excluded from current level totals. In addition, emergency funding that was not designated pursuant to the Deficit Control Act does not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes. Those amounts, which 
are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:

S201 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 15, 2020 
No. 9 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, we whisper our prayer 
boldly before Your throne of grace. You 
have invited us to come to You with all 
our needs. We thank You for our re-
quests that You have already an-
swered. We have sought and found. We 
have knocked and walked through open 
doors. 
Lord, with Your grace and mercy, 
strengthen our lawmakers for their 
journey. Prepare them for the ravages 
of the valley and the chill of the moun-
tain summits. Guide them, great Re-
deemer. They are pilgrims on this 
Earth. They are weak, but You are 
mighty. Inspire them to keep their 
eyes on You and not the problems that 
seem too difficult to solve. 
We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to address the Sen-
ate for 1 minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
IRAN 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, when 
President Obama signed the Iran deal, 
we were led to believe that this rap-
prochement with the Iranian regime 
would induce Iran to moderate its ag-
gressive foreign policy and that Iran 
would likely spend the money made 
available through that deal on eco-
nomic development for the good of its 
people. Instead, under the direction of 
General Soleimani, Iran accelerated its 
effort at regional domination, funding 
terrorist organizations like Hamas and 
Hezbollah in the Palestinian territories 
and Lebanon, pro-Iranian militias in 
Iraq, the Assad regime in Syria, and 
the Houthi rebels fomenting civil war 
in Yemen. Iran did all of that with 
money from the Iran agreement. 
Meanwhile, the suffering Iranian peo-
ple staged widespread demonstrations 
against their government, which were 
met with a violent crackdown that 
killed hundreds. Years of appeasement 
didn’t work, but it looks like President 
Trump’s deterrence is having positive 
effect. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today it appears that the House Demo-
crat majority will finally stand behind 
its decision to impeach the President 
of the United States. Last year, the 
House 
of 
Representatives 
rushed 
through the least thorough and most 
unclear impeachment inquiry in Amer-
ican history. They took just 12 weeks— 
12 weeks. 
There was more than a year of hear-
ings before the impeachment of Presi-
dent Nixon. There were multiple years 
of investigation for President Clinton. 
When people are serious about com-
piling evidence and proving a case, 
these things take time. 
That is not what happened this time. 
House Democrats performed a pale imi-
tation of a real inquiry. They did not 
pursue their own subpoenas through 
the courts. They declined to litigate 
potential questions of privilege. They 
pulled the plug as soon as Speaker 
PELOSI realized she had enough Demo-
crat votes to achieve a political out-
come. 
This isn’t really about Ukraine pol-
icy or military assistance money. It 
can’t be because, for one thing, promi-
nent Democrats were promising to im-
peach President Trump years—years— 
before those events even happened. 
The day this President was inaugu-
rated, the Washington Post said: ‘‘The 
campaign to impeach President Trump 
has begun.’’ That was the day he was 
inaugurated, stated in the Washington 
Post. 
More than 2 years ago, Congressman 
JERRY NADLER was campaigning to be 
the top Democrat on the House Judici-
ary Committee, specifically because he 
was an impeachment expert. 
Just a few weeks ago, when a re-
porter asked Speaker PELOSI why the 
Democrats were in such a hurry, here 
is her response: 
Speed? It’s been going on for 22 months. 
Two and a half years, actually. 
That is really interesting—really, 
really interesting. The events over 
which the Democrats want to impeach 
happened just 6 months ago—just 6 
months ago—not 21⁄2 years ago. 
So how has impeachment been under-
way for 21⁄2 years? The Speaker tried to 
say she was referring to the Mueller in-
vestigation, except the House couldn’t 
impeach on the Mueller investigation 
because the facts let them down; re-
member? 
The House impeached over events in 
Ukraine, events that happened only 6 
months ago, but they still admit this 
was years in the making. It was not 
some earnest factfinding mission that 
brought us to where we are. This is not 
about the nuances of foreign assistance 
to Eastern Europe. This has been 
naked partisanship all along—naked 
partisanship all along.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S202 
January 15, 2020 
If that weren’t already obvious, our 
colleague the Senate Democratic lead-
er helpfully removed any shred of 
doubt just this past weekend. Here is 
what he said: He told reporters that as 
long as he can try to use the trial to 
hurt some Republican Senators’ reelec-
tion chances, then whatever happens, 
‘‘it’s a win-win.’’ That is what the 
Democratic leader said. This is a stun-
ning statement. 
Presidential impeachment may be 
the gravest process our Constitution 
contemplates. It undoes the people’s 
decision in a national election. Going 
about it in this subjective, unfair, and 
rushed way is corrosive to our institu-
tions. It hurts national unity, and it 
virtually guarantees—guarantees—that 
future Houses of either party will feel 
free—free—to 
impeach 
any 
future 
President because they don’t like him. 
If you don’t like him, impeach him. 
That is the message coming out of this. 
But as long as our colleague the 
Democratic leader can weaponize this 
process in the next election, he thinks 
‘‘it’s a win-win.’’ That really says it 
all; doesn’t it? That really sums it up. 
This partisanship led House Demo-
crats to cross a rubicon that every 
other House of Representatives had 
avoided for 230 years. They passed the 
first Presidential impeachment that 
does not even allege an actual crime 
under our laws. We had a 230-year tra-
dition of rejecting purely political im-
peachments, and it died last month in 
this House of Representatives. 
So Speaker PELOSI and the House 
have taken our Nation down a dan-
gerous road. If the Senate blesses this 
unprecedented and dangerous House 
process by agreeing that an incomplete 
case and a subjective basis are enough 
to impeach a President, we will almost 
guarantee the impeachment of every 
future President of either party when 
the House doesn’t like that President. 
This grave process of last constitu-
tional resort will be watered down into 
the kind of anti-democratic recall 
measure that the Founding Fathers ex-
plicitly—explicitly—did not want. 
The Senate was designed to stabilize 
our institutions, to break partisan fe-
vers, and to stop short-term passions 
from destroying our long-term future. 
House Democrats may have descended 
into pure factionalism, but the U.S. 
Senate must not. 
This is the only body that can con-
sider all factors presented by the 
House, decide what has or has not been 
proven, and choose what outcome best 
serves the Nation. This is what we 
must do. 
f 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, for 
the information of all Senators, with 
the House signaling that they will 
move forward later today, Members 
can expect to receive further guidance 
about the logistics and practicalities of 
the next several session days in short 
order. 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA 
TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
an entirely different matter, before the 
Senate shifts into the trial, we hope to 
complete an enormous accomplishment 
for this administration and, most im-
portantly, for American families. It 
has now been more than 1 year—1 
year—since 
President 
Trump 
ham-
mered out the USMCA with the Gov-
ernments of Mexico and Canada. 
These two neighbors buy more than 
$5 billion of American goods and serv-
ices every single year. They buy nearly 
30 percent of all the food and agricul-
tural products we export to the entire 
world, and for 90 percent of our manu-
facturing sectors, Mexico or Canada 
rank as the No. 1 or No. 2 export des-
tination. 
Over the past quarter of a century, 12 
million U.S. jobs have come to depend 
on U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada. 
That includes many livelihoods in my 
home State of Kentucky, from agri-
culture to manufacturing, to aerospace 
and motor vehicles, to our signature 
industries, like distilled spirits. 
That is why workers, families, and 
small businesses in Kentucky and 
around the Nation have been clamoring 
to get this deal done for a year now. In 
addition to all the American liveli-
hoods that this commerce already sup-
ports, experts predict the USMCA will 
create 176,000 new jobs as well. 
On behalf of all of these Americans, 
we were troubled to see Speaker PELOSI 
slow walk this agreement for the bet-
ter part of a year. But, finally, late last 
year, 
the 
overwhelming 
bipartisan 
pressure to move forward made an im-
pact on the House. So we are finally on 
the threshold of approving this agree-
ment and sending it to President 
Trump’s desk to become law. 
Our colleagues on the Finance Com-
mittee have already approved it by an 
overwhelming margin. Other commit-
tees of jurisdiction are wrapping up 
their consideration as we speak. Very 
soon, we hope the Senate will be able 
to vote on the floor and put this land-
mark accomplishment right on the 
President’s desk. 
It will be a major win for Kentucky 
and for all 50 States, a major win for 
our country, a major win for the 
Trump administration, and a major 
win for those of us who are already 
ready to move past this season of toxic 
political noise and get back to doing 
even more of the American people’s 
business. 
f 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 3193 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
understand that there is a bill at the 
desk that is due for a second reading. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the title of the bill for 
the second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3193) to amend the Controlled 
Substances Act to list fentanyl-related sub-
stances as schedule I controlled substances, 
and for other purposes. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. In order to place 
the bill on the calendar under the pro-
visions of rule XIV, I object to further 
proceedings. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bill will be 
placed on the calendar. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will be 
in a period of morning business, with 
Senators permitted to speak therein 
for up to 10 minutes each. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, before I 
make remarks on a different issue, I 
would like to address comments made 
this morning by the majority leader, 
the Senator from Kentucky. The first 
related, as most of his comments re-
cently, to the pending impeachment 
trial in the U.S. Senate. 
I listened carefully to his arguments 
that the House and the Senate have 
moved too quickly on this matter. It is 
true that they moved with dispatch, 
and I think it reflects the fact that the 
charges that have been made were 
timely, important, and relevant to the 
election campaign cycle which we now 
face. 
The charges in the Articles of Im-
peachment suggest the President, in 
conversation with the President of 
Ukraine, asked for help in the cam-
paign that is about to ensue, asking 
specifically for investigative material 
on the son of former Vice President Jo-
seph Biden. At the same time, the 
President was withholding military as-
sistance voted by the Appropriations 
Committee in Congress to Ukraine as 
they continue to battle with Russia. 
These are serious charges, and they 
were based on a telephone conversation 
last July. 
It is true that the effort by the House 
of Representatives has been timely 
and, by measurement of previous im-
peachment investigations, much faster, 
but I believe that the timeliness is one 
of the important elements here because 
we are facing this campaign.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S203 
January 15, 2020 
Secondly, there was an argument 
made by the majority leader that the 
Articles of Impeachment which we are 
about to receive in the Senate do not 
state that a crime was committed. I 
would refer the majority leader to the 
Constitution as well as to precedent in 
the U.S. Senate. The actual allegation 
of a crime is not required for an im-
peachment. I think the Senator from 
Kentucky knows that. 
The last point he makes is one that I 
think is very important, and that is 
that there has been some delay by 
Speaker PELOSI in sending the Articles 
of Impeachment to the U.S. Senate. I 
would say, during the course of the pe-
riod since they were first voted on last 
December in the House and their ar-
rival in the Senate this week, we have 
seen several things of importance un-
fold, not the least of which was a re-
cent disclosure of new witnesses and 
new evidence that has have been col-
lected since the House voted on the Ar-
ticles of Impeachment. In the eyes of 
many, it is relevant evidence, and the 
fact that that information is now 
available to the Senate means we have 
a better chance of arriving at the truth 
after deliberation. 
Secondly, I might add it is encour-
aging that some Republican Members 
of the U.S. Senate have made it clear 
that they oppose the notion of a mo-
tion 
to 
dismiss 
the 
impeachment 
charges as soon as they arrive. That 
might have been the dream of some in 
the White House—and perhaps even 
some in the U.S. Senate—but cooler 
heads have prevailed, and I salute my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
who believe we have a special responsi-
bility to treat this constitutional as-
signment with independence and dig-
nity. That means we don’t prejudge by 
coming to the floor and announcing, in 
some critical terms, that the Articles 
of Impeachment should not be taken 
seriously. We should take them seri-
ously. It is a serious matter. I hope col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle will 
do that. 
f 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA 
TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the ma-
jority leader, Senator MCCONNELL, also 
addressed the USMCA. This is charac-
terized as the NAFTA–2 or ‘‘the new 
trade agreement’’ between the United 
States, Canada, and Mexico. As he 
noted, trade among our three countries 
is critically important to all of us and, 
certainly, to the American economy 
and to my home State of Illinois. Our 
trade with Mexico and Canada eclipses 
all the other trade around the world 
and is important, especially, to our ag-
ricultural sector. 
Just last weekend, in my hometown 
of Springfield, IL, I held a historic 
press conference. I brought together 
the President of the Illinois State 
AFL–CIO, Tim Drea of Christian Coun-
ty 
in 
Central 
Illinois, 
and 
Dick 
Guebert, who is the president of the Il-
linois Farm Bureau, both of whom, 
through their organizations, support 
the USMCA trade agreement that is 
about to come before Congress. There 
were a lot of smiles and laughter in the 
room as these two friends of mine 
noted that it is the very first time they 
have ever come together at a press con-
ference: organized labor and the farm-
ers of the State of Illinois. They both 
agree that this USMCA trade agree-
ment is a step forward, an improve-
ment over the original NAFTA. They 
both endorse it, and I do too. 
I also want to add that the sugges-
tion that somehow Speaker PELOSI, in 
the words of the majority leader, slow- 
walked the USMCA really, in a way, ig-
nores the obvious. In the period of time 
between the original submission of the 
USMCA and the vote that will take 
place soon in the U.S. Senate, changes 
have been made to the trade agreement 
which the President submitted to Con-
gress—important changes. For exam-
ple, there was a provision in the trade 
agreement submitted by the President 
to Congress that was a dream come 
true for the pharmaceutical industry of 
the United States. It extended the pe-
riod of time of exclusivity for certain 
biological drugs in that treaty. What it 
meant was that these pharmaceutical 
companies could continue to charge 
the highest prices on Earth to Amer-
ican consumers while delaying any 
competition from generic drugs. 
That was a deal-breaker, as far as I 
was concerned. I told everyone in-
volved I would not support the Presi-
dent’s 
original 
USMCA 
with 
that 
sweetheart deal for the pharmaceutical 
industry. Thank goodness, because of 
Speaker PELOSI; our leader on the Sen-
ate side, Senator SCHUMER; and many 
others, we had that provision removed. 
Now the majority leader is criticizing 
Speaker PELOSI
for slow-walking. I 
don’t see it as slow-walking. I see it as 
bargaining, negotiating, and coming up 
with the result which made this trade 
agreement more acceptable to people 
on both sides of the aisle. 
There was also language which the 
Democrats insisted on ultimately in-
cluded in the USMCA, which provides 
additional protection for workers in 
the United States when it comes to the 
competition with workers in Mexico 
and Canada, which provides for addi-
tional inspections of production facili-
ties in those other countries if there is 
a suspicion that they are engaging in 
the treatment of workers in an unac-
ceptable manner. In other words, we 
put more enforcement provisions in the 
treaty over the last year while it has 
been before Congress, as we should—ex-
actly what the American people want. 
For the Senator to come to the floor 
and criticize this as somehow negative 
and political and slow-walking—I think 
those two things I have just mentioned 
are substantive and important and go 
to the heart of why this agreement now 
has strong bipartisan support, which it 
should have had. I think we have added 
to this process by making it truly bi-
partisan. 
FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES AND 
UNIVERSITIES 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week the House of Representatives will 
have the opportunity to stand up for 
student borrowers who have been de-
frauded by the schools they attended. 
The House of Representatives will be 
voting on a resolution introduced by 
Representative SUSIE LEE of Nevada 
which will allow defrauded student 
loan borrowers relief from their stu-
dent debt. 
Under the Higher Education Act, cur-
rently the law of the land, when a stu-
dent borrower is defrauded by their 
school, they are entitled to have their 
Federal student loans to attend that 
school discharged. That is what Con-
gress intended. Why? The logic behind 
it is very straightforward. 
Consider the following: The Federal 
Government recognizes the accredita-
tion of these schools, colleges, and uni-
versities. That accreditation author-
izes these schools to offer loans from 
the Federal Government to pay for the 
cost of attending. It is a very straight-
forward process. The schools are ac-
credited. The U.S. Government recog-
nizes the accreditation which author-
izes the school to offer courses to stu-
dents, and then it goes on to say that 
students attending those colleges and 
universities will qualify for Federal 
student loans. Now, that is where this 
particular statement I am about to 
make becomes particularly relevant. 
The school makes promises about the 
education they are going to offer to the 
students to entice them to attend and 
to borrow money to attend. For exam-
ple, the school may tell the students 
that the credits they earn at this 
school can be transferred to other 
schools, but sometimes that turns out 
to be untrue and false. These schools 
may tell the students there are jobs 
waiting for them in the fields that they 
want them to study at the schools. 
They tell them that, after graduation, 
there are plenty of employment oppor-
tunities, and oftentimes that turns out 
to be untrue. In fact, in the case of 
some of these schools, they have delib-
erately misrepresented the job place-
ment of graduates to create the im-
pression of success if you complete a 
course. The schools are lying to the 
students. 
The school may also promise that, if 
you complete a course at the school, 
you will automatically be qualified for 
certain certifications under State law. 
Sometimes that turns out to be a lie. 
They may also tell the students there 
are certain teachers and courses avail-
able to them if they pay their tuition, 
and that may turn out to be untrue as 
well. 
The law I referred to earlier is in-
tended, when these types of lies and 
misrepresentations occur and the stu-
dent is misled into borrowing Federal 
student loans based on these misrepre-
sentations, to give the defrauded stu-
dent the right to be relieved of the stu-
dent loan responsibility under the law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S204 
January 15, 2020 
It makes sense. If the student is lied 
to, takes out a Federal loan, and it 
turns out the school lied to them and 
defrauded them, we don’t want the stu-
dents saddled with a loan from that 
school that could literally change their 
lives. 
Now we have a new Secretary of Edu-
cation under President Trump, Betsy 
DeVos. She has decided to rewrite the 
rules when it comes to these students 
receiving relief from the fraud I have 
just described. She places burdens on 
these students that we have not seen 
before. Basically, she is saying to the 
students: Lawyer up. You just can’t 
make your plea to the Department of 
Education that you, along with a group 
of other students, were defrauded by 
representations in the materials they 
distributed or the statements they 
made—not good enough under the new 
rule written by Secretary DeVos. What 
she has basically said is that each one 
of these students now has an individual 
responsibility to prove that that stu-
dent was defrauded, that there was a 
representation to that student as op-
posed to it being made by the school to 
all of the students or in its publica-
tions and the like. 
The burdens which Secretary DeVos 
now places on defrauded students have 
led to estimates that only 3 percent of 
the students who have been defrauded 
can possibly expect to receive relief 
from their student debt—3 percent. 
You might say: Well, these things hap-
pen. It is a ‘‘buyer beware’’ market. 
Students ought to know better. Really? 
When the Federal Government recog-
nizes an accredited school and says to 
that school: You can offer Federal stu-
dent loans, do we not bear some re-
sponsibility to the student and the 
family if that school lies and misrepre-
sents facts to the students? Well, 78 
percent of Americans happen to think, 
yes, we don’t want to have students in 
a predicament where their own futures 
are going to be somehow compromised 
because of the fraud by the school. 
How many students are affected by 
this? A handful? No. It turns out, a dra-
matically large number. Over the last 
decade, tens of thousands of college 
students in America have been de-
frauded in ways I just described, lured 
into enrolling in classes with false 
promises and aggressive tactics, only 
to be left with massive student debt 
and a worthless education and no job. 
Sadly, it is a common occurrence in 
the for-profit college industry. That in-
dustry, the for-profit college industry, 
is an industry that can be best de-
scribed by two numbers. Nine percent 
of postsecondary students are enrolled 
in for-profit colleges and universities 
in America. Think about the Univer-
sity of Phoenix, DeVry, and others. 
Nine percent of students end up in 
schools like that. Yet 33 percent of all 
the federal student loan defaults are 
students from these for-profit colleges 
and universities—9 percent of the stu-
dents, 33 percent of the student loan 
defaults. Why? The tuition is too high; 
the education is virtually worthless; 
and there are no jobs at the end of the 
rainbow. 
Some of these schools—for-profit col-
leges 
like 
Corinthian, 
ITT 
Tech, 
Westwood, Dream Center—preyed on 
students, reaped huge profits, and then 
conveniently went bankrupt. They may 
be gone, legally gone, but the debts for 
the students still live. Others, such as 
Ashford, University of Phoenix, Career 
Education Corporation, are still out 
there doing business. Virtually, all of 
these notorious schools have been the 
subject of multiple State and local in-
vestigations or lawsuits for unfair, de-
ceptive, and abusive practices. Unfor-
tunately, they continue to create more 
student victims due to the lack of en-
forcement by our own U.S. Department 
of Education and loopholes in the laws, 
which, sadly, Congress has been unable 
or unwilling to close. 
Currently, 
there 
are 
more 
than 
223,000 claims made by students of 
being defrauded and seeking relief 
under the Higher Education Act—over 
200,000 student borrowers whose lives 
have been collared by student loan debt 
from 
these 
worthless, 
defrauding 
schools. 
The claims—223,000 of them—come 
from every State in the Union, big and 
small, red, blue, and purple. There are 
over 11,000 from my State of Illinois; 
over 19,000 from the State of Florida; 
7,800 from Ohio; 6,100 from North Caro-
lina; 3,800 from Colorado; 1,000 from the 
State of West Virginia; 385 in Maine; 
and more than 200 in Alaska. 
The American people believe these 
defrauded student borrowers and future 
defrauded borrowers deserve help. Ac-
cording to a poll by New America, 78 
percent of Americans believe students 
should have their Federal student 
loans forgiven if their schools de-
frauded them. That includes 87 percent 
of Democrats and 71 percent of Repub-
licans who feel that way. 
This new rule by Secretary DeVos 
would not allow borrowers to receive 
the Federal student loan discharge cur-
rently in the law. It is why more than 
60 organizations are supporting the res-
olution, which the House will vote on 
this week, and the companion resolu-
tion I have introduced in the Senate. 
Among those supporting our effort 
are the American Federation of Teach-
ers, the National Education Associa-
tion, the Student Veterans of Amer-
ica—and one that I want to highlight. 
I see there are others on the floor 
preparing to speak, so I am going to 
abbreviate my remarks, but I want to 
make one last point. 
Among the groups supporting our ef-
forts to undo the borrower defense rule, 
promulgated by Secretary of Education 
DeVos, is the American Legion. The 
American Legion sent me a letter last 
month, and, in support of our effort to 
undo the DeVos rule, they said, among 
other things, that the rule is fun-
damentally unfair to veterans. Listen 
to what they say about the plight of 
veterans having been defrauded by 
schools, trying to get relief from their 
loans. This is from James ‘‘Bill’’ Ox-
ford, national commander of the Amer-
ican Legion. He writes: 
Thousands of student veterans have been 
defrauded over the years—promised their 
credits would transfer when they wouldn’t, 
given false or misleading job placement rates 
in marketing, promised one educational ex-
perience when they were recruited, but given 
something completely different. This type of 
deception against our veterans and service-
members has been a lucrative scam for un-
scrupulous actors. 
As veterans are aggressively targeted due 
to their service to our country, they must be 
afforded the right to group relief. The De-
partment of Education’s ‘‘Borrower Defense’’ 
rule eliminates this right. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD the 
letter dated December 18, 2019. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
THE AMERICAN LEGION, 
Washington, DC, December 18, 2019. 
Hon. RICHARD DURBIN, 
Senate Dirksen Office Building, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR DURBIN: On behalf of the 
nearly 2 million members of The American 
Legion, I write to express our support for 
Joint Resolution 56, providing for congres-
sional disapproval of the rule submitted by 
the Department of Education relating to, 
‘‘Borrower Defense Institutional Account-
ability.’’ The rule, as currently written, is 
fundamentally rigged against defrauded bor-
rowers of student loans, depriving them of 
the opportunity for debt relief that Congress 
intended to afford them under the Higher 
Education Act. Affirming this position is 
American Legion Resolution No. 82: Preserve 
Veteran and Servicemember Rights to Gain-
ful Employment and Borrower Defense Pro-
tections, adopted in our National Convention 
2017. 
Thousands of student veterans have been 
defrauded over the years—promised their 
credits would transfer when they wouldn’t, 
given false or misleading job placement rates 
in marketing, promised one educational ex-
perience when they were recruited, but given 
something completely different. This type of 
deception 
against 
our 
veterans 
and 
servicemembers has been a lucrative scam 
for unscrupulous actors. 
As veterans are aggressively targeted due 
to their service to our country, they must be 
afforded the right to group relief. The De-
partment of Education’s ‘‘Borrower Defense’’ 
rule eliminates this right, forcing veterans 
to individually prove their claim, share the 
specific type of financial harm they suffered, 
and prove the school knowingly made sub-
stantial misrepresentations. The preponder-
ance of evidence required for this process is 
so onerous that the Department of Edu-
cation itself estimated that only 3 percent of 
applicants would get relief. 
Until every veteran’s application for stu-
dent loan forgiveness has been processed, we 
will continue to demand fair and timely de-
cisions. The rule that the Department of 
Education has promulgated flagrantly denies 
defrauded veterans these dignities, and The 
American Legion calls on Congress to over-
turn this regulatory action. 
Senator Durbin, The American Legion ap-
plauds your leadership in addressing this 
critical issue facing our nation’s veterans 
and their families. 
For God & Country, 
JAMES W. ‘‘BILL’’ OXFORD, 
National Commander, The American Legion.

January 15, 2020 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have 
an additional letter from 20 State at-
torneys general led by the Common-
wealth of Massachusetts Office of the 
Attorney General. I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
the letter dated January 14, 2020. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHU-
SETTS, OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY 
GENERAL, 
Boston, MA, January 14, 2020. 
Senator DICK DURBIN, 
Washington, DC. 
Representative SUSIE LEE, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR DURBIN
AND REPRESENTA-
TIVE
LEE: We, the undersigned Attorneys 
General of Massachusetts, California, Dela-
ware, the District of Columbia, Hawai’i, Illi-
nois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Min-
nesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, 
North 
Carolina, 
Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, 
Vermont, Virginia, and Washington write to 
express our support for the resolution of dis-
approval that you have introduced regarding 
the U.S. Department of Education’s (‘‘De-
partment’’) 2019 Borrower Defense Rule 
(‘‘2019 Rule’’) pursuant to the Congressional 
Review Act. In issuing the 2019 Rule, the De-
partment has abdicated its Congressionally- 
mandated responsibility to protect students 
and taxpayers from the misconduct of un-
scrupulous schools. The rule provides no re-
alistic prospect for borrowers to discharge 
their loans when they have been defrauded 
by predatory for-profit schools, and it elimi-
nates financial responsibility requirements 
for those same institutions. If this rule goes 
into effect, the result will be disastrous for 
students while providing a windfall to abu-
sive schools. 
The 2019 Rule squanders and reverses re-
cent progress the Department has made in 
protecting students from fraud and abuse. 
Three years ago, the Department completed 
a thorough rulemaking process addressing 
borrower defense and financial responsi-
bility, in which the views of numerous 
schools, 
stakeholders, 
and 
public 
com-
menters were considered and incorporated 
into a comprehensive set of regulations. The 
regulations, promulgated by the Department 
in November 20l6 (‘‘2016 Rule’’), made sub-
stantial progress toward achieving the De-
partment’s then-stated goal of providing de-
frauded borrowers with a consistent, clear, 
fair, and transparent process to seek debt re-
lief. At the same time, the 2016 Rule pro-
tected taxpayers by holding schools account-
able that engage in misconduct and ensuring 
that financially troubled schools provide the 
government with protection against the 
risks they create. 
The Department’s new rule would simply 
rescind and replace its 2016 Rule, reversing 
all of its enhanced protections for students 
and its accountability measures for for-prof-
it schools. The Department’s 2019 Rule pro-
vides an entirely unfair and unworkable 
process for defrauded students to obtain loan 
relief and will do nothing to deter and hold 
accountable schools that cheat their stu-
dents. Among its numerous flaws, the De-
partment’s new rule places insurmountable 
evidentiary burdens on student borrowers 
with meritorious claims. The rule requires 
student borrowers to prove intentional or 
reckless misconduct on the part of their 
schools, an extraordinarily demanding stand-
ard not consistent with state laws governing 
liability for unfair and deceptive conduct. 
Moreover, even where a school has inten-
tionally or recklessly harmed its students, it 
is difficult to imagine how students would be 
able to obtain the evidence necessary to 
prove intent or recklessness for an adminis-
trative application to the Department. The 
rule also inappropriately requires student 
borrowers to prove financial harm beyond 
the intrinsic harm caused by incurring fed-
eral student loan debt as a result of fraud, 
and establishes a three-year time bar on bor-
rower defense claims, even though students 
typicaJiy do not learn until years later that 
they 
were 
defrauded 
by 
their 
schools. 
Compounding these obstacles, the rule arbi-
trarily eliminates the process by which relief 
can be sought on a group level, permitting 
those schools that have committed the most 
egregious and systemic misconduct to ben-
efit from their wrongdoing at the expense of 
borrowers with meritorious claims who are 
unaware of or unable to access relief. 
We are uniquely well-situated to under-
stand the devastating effects that the 2019 
Rule would have on the lives of student bor-
rowers and their families. State attorneys 
general serve an important role in the regu-
lation of private, postsecondary institutions. 
Our investigations and enforcement actions 
have repeatedly revealed that numerous for- 
profit schools have deceived and defrauded 
students, and employed other unlawful tac-
tics to line their coffers with federal student- 
loan funds. We have witnessed firsthand the 
heartbreaking devastation to borrowers and 
their families. Recently, for example, state 
attorneys general played a critical role in 
uncovering widespread misconduct at Career 
Education Corporation, Education Manage-
ment Corporation, the Art Institute and Ar-
gosy schools operated by the Dream Center, 
ITT Technical Institute, Corinthian Col-
leges, American Career Institute and others, 
and then working with the Department to 
secure borrower-defense relief for tens of 
thousands of defrauded students. Though 
this work, we have spoken with numerous 
students who, while seeking new opportuni-
ties for themselves and their families, were 
lured into programs with the promise of em-
ployment opportunities and higher earnings, 
only to be left with little to show for their 
efforts aside from unaffordable debt. 
A robust and fair borrower defense rule is 
critical for ensuring that student borrowers 
and taxpayers are not left bearing the costs 
of institutional misconduct. The Depart-
ment’s new rule instead empowers predatory 
for-profit schools and cuts off relief to vic-
timized students. During the comment pe-
riod on the 2019 Rule, we submitted these and 
other objections to the Department. Rather 
than engaging with our offices, the Depart-
ment ignored our comments and left our con-
cerns unaddressed. We commend and support 
your efforts to disapprove the 2019 Rule to 
protect students and taxpayers. Congress 
must hold predatory institutions account-
able for their misconduct and provide relief 
to defrauded student borrowers and, by en-
acting your resolution of disapproval, ensure 
that the 2016 Rule remains the operative bor-
rower defense regulation.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, along 
with Attorney General Kwame Raoul 
of Illinois and others, signers include 
the attorneys general of Maine, Iowa, 
Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. In 
their letter, these chief state law en-
forcement officers write: 
In issuing the 2019 rule, the Department 
has abdicated its Congressionally-mandated 
responsibility to protect students and tax-
payers from the misconduct of unscrupulous 
schools. The rule provides no realistic pros-
pect for borrowers to discharge their loans 
when they have been defrauded by predatory 
for-profit schools . . . if this rule goes into 
effect, the result will be disastrous for stu-
dents while providing a windfall to abusive 
schools. 
Senators are going to get a chance— 
Democrats and Republicans—to undo 
the mess created by the Secretary of 
Education. Senators will get a chance 
to stand up for the student loan bor-
rowers who have been defrauded and, 
equally important, a chance to stand 
up for our veterans. How many speech-
es have been delivered on this floor 
about the men and women in uniform 
and those who have served and how 
much we honor them? Honor them by 
standing with the American Legion 
and vote to undo the borrower defense

TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, later 
today, the President will sign phase 
one of the trade agreement we are ne-
gotiating with China. Of particular im-
portance to my State, phase one in-
cludes a pledge from China to substan-
tially increase its imports of American 
agriculture products. 
That is good news for South Dakota. 
It is good news for farmers and ranch-
ers who have been struggling in a 
tough ag economy. Low commodity 
and livestock prices, natural disasters, 
and protracted trade disputes have 
made the last few years challenging 
ones for farmers and ranchers around 
the country. 
I spend a lot of time in South Da-
kota, talking to our farmers and ranch-
ers. One thing they always emphasize 
is the need for trade deals that will 
open up new markets or expand current 
markets for their products. 
The China deal should significantly 
increase demand for American agricul-
tural products and boost the farm 
economy. But while this agreement is 
excellent news, we do need to make 
sure that China will actually live up to 
its commitments. China doesn’t have

January 15, 2020 
the best record in this regard, so it is 
important the United States make 
clear that any agreements must be 
honored. 
As we wait for the China deal to take 
effect, one piece of definite good news 
on the trade front is the arrival in the 
Senate of the United States-Mexico- 
Canada Agreement. After months of 
delay by House Democrats, USMCA is 
finally—finally—moving through Con-
gress. Here in the Senate, it is advanc-
ing rapidly through the required com-
mittees, and I expect it will be received 
for final Senate consideration in the 
next few days. 
Last week, I voted in support of this 
agreement in the Senate Finance Com-
mittee, and just this morning—a few 
minutes ago, in fact—I voted for this 
agreement in a meeting of the Senate 
Committee on Commerce. The United 
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement has 
been a big priority of mine over the 
past year, in particular because of the 
ways the agreement would benefit 
farmers and ranchers. 
Canada and Mexico are the No. 1 and 
No. 2 markets for American agriculture 
products, and this agreement will pre-
serve and expand farmers’ access to 
these two critical export markets and 
give farmers certainty about what 
these markets are going to look like 
going forward. 
I am particularly pleased about the 
ways that USMCA will benefit dairy 
farmers. If you drive the I–29 corridor 
north of Brookings, SD, you can see 
firsthand the major dairy expansion 
South Dakota has experienced over the 
past several years. 
The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement 
will preserve U.S. dairy farmers’ role 
as a key dairy supplier to Mexico, and 
it will substantially expand market ac-
cess to Canada. The U.S. International 
Trade Commission estimates that the 
agreement will boost U.S. dairy ex-
ports by more than $277 million. The 
agreement will also expand market ac-
cess for U.S. poultry and egg producers. 
It will make it easier for American 
producers to export wheat to Canada 
and much more. 
Of course, the benefits of this agree-
ment are not limited to farmers and 
ranchers. The United States-Mexico- 
Canada Agreement will benefit vir-
tually every sector of the economy, 
from manufacturing to digital services 
to the automotive industry. It will cre-
ate hundreds of thousands of new jobs, 
boost our economic output, and in-
crease wages for workers. 
The 
agreement 
also 
breaks 
new 
ground by including a chapter specifi-
cally focused on small and medium- 
sized businesses—the first time a U.S. 
trade agreement has ever included a 
dedicated chapter on this topic. 
Roughly, 120,000 small and medium- 
sized businesses around our country ex-
port goods and services to Mexico and 
Canada, including a number of busi-
nesses in my home State of South Da-
kota. The United States-Mexico- Can-
ada Agreement will make it easier for 
these businesses to successfully export 
their products. South Dakota busi-
nesses and consumers will also benefit 
from the fact that the agreement main-
tains the current U.S. de minimis 
threshold, which is something I fought 
hard to protect. 
It is too bad farmers and ranchers 
had to wait so long for the USMCA 
trade agreement. This agreement was 
concluded well over a year ago, and it 
could have been taken up much sooner. 
But House Democrats have, unfortu-
nately, been more focused on playing 
political games than on working with 
Republicans to do the American peo-
ple’s business. 
I am very glad we are taking up this 
agreement now, though, and I look for-
ward to voting for final passage of 
USMCA in the very near future. We 
should get this agreement to the Presi-
dent’s desk without delay.

IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today 
is a momentous, historic, and solemn 
day in the history of the U.S. Senate 
and in the history of our Republic. The 
House of Representatives will send Ar-
ticles of Impeachment against Presi-
dent Trump to the Senate, and the 
Speaker will appoint the House man-
agers of the impeachment case. 
Two articles will be delivered. The 
first charges the President with abuse 
of power—of coercing a foreign leader 
into interfering in our elections and of 
using the powers of the Presidency, the 
most powerful public office in the Na-
tion, to benefit himself. The second 
charges the President with obstruction 
of 
Congress 
for 
an 
unprecedented 
blockade of the legislature’s authority 
to oversee and investigate the execu-
tive branch. 
Let’s put it a different way. 
The House of Representatives has ac-
cused the President of trying to shake 
down a foreign leader for personal gain 
to help him in his campaign, and he 
has done everything possible to cover 
it up. This administration is unprece-
dented in its not being open, in its de-
sire for secrecy, in its desire to prevent 
the public from knowing what it is 
doing, and it is worst of all when it 
comes in an impeachment trial. 
The two offenses are the types of of-
fenses the Founders had in mind when 
they designed the impeachment powers 
of Congress. Americans and the Found-
ing Fathers, in particular, from the 
very founding day of the Republic, 
have feared the ability of a foreign 
power to interfere in our elections. 
Americans have never wanted a foreign 
power to have sway over our elections, 
but that is what President Trump is 
accused 
of 
doing—of 
soliciting—in 
these articles. 
I would ask my colleagues, and I 
would ask the American people: Do we 
want a foreign power determining who 
our President is or do we want the 
American voters to determine it? It is 
that serious. That is the central ques-
tion: Who should determine who our 
President and our other elected offi-
cials are? 
From the early days of the Republic, 
foreigners have tried to interfere, and 
from the early days of the Republic, we 
have resisted. Yet, according to these 
articles and other things he has done, 
President Trump seems to aid and abet 
it. His view is, if it is good for him, 
then, that is good enough. That is not 
America. We are a nation of laws—of 
the rule of law, not of the rule of one 
man. 
So now the Senate’s job is to try the 
case—to conduct a fair trial on these 
very severe charges of letting, aiding, 
abetting, and encouraging a foreign 
power to interfere in our elections and 
of threatening them with the cutoff of 
aid—and to determine if the Presi-
dent’s offenses merit, if they are prov-
en, the most severe punishment our 
Constitution imagines. 
The House has made a very strong 
case, but, clearly, the Senators have to 
see that case and watch it firsthand. A 
fair trial means the prosecutors who 
make the case and the President’s 
counsel who provide the defense have 
all of the evidence available. It means 
that Senators have all of the facts to 
make 
an 
informed 
decision. 
That 
means relevant witnesses, and that 
means relevant documents. We all 
know that. We all know—every Mem-
ber of this body, Democrat or Repub-
lican—that you can’t have a fair, open 
trial, particularly on something as 
weighty as impeachment, when we 
don’t have the evidence and the facts. 
The precedents of the Senate are 
clear. Leader MCCONNELL is constantly 
citing precedent. Here is one: The Sen-
ate has always heard from witnesses in 
impeachment trials. There have been 15 
completed impeachment trials in the 
history of this country. In every single 
one of them, the Senate has heard from 
witnesses. Let me repeat that for Lead-
er MCCONNELL’s benefit since he is al-
ways citing the precedent of 1999. 
There have been 15 completed impeach-
ment trials, including the one in 1999. 
In the history of this country, in every 
single one of them, the Senate has 
heard from witnesses. It would be un-
precedented not to. President John-
son’s 
impeachment 
trial

nesses—41 of them. President Clinton’s

trial had witnesses. Several of my col-
leagues, including the Republican lead-
er, voted for them. Conducting an im-
peachment trial of the President of the 
United States and having no witnesses 
would be without precedent and, frank-
ly, a new low for the majority in this 
body that history will not look kindly 
on. 
Each day that goes by, the case for 
witnesses and documents gains force 
and gains momentum. Last night, a 
new cache of documents, including doz-
ens of pages of notes, text messages, 
and other records, shed light on the ac-
tivities of the President’s associates in 
Ukraine. The documents paint a sordid 
picture of the efforts by the President’s 
personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and 
his associate, Lev Parnas, to remove a 
sitting U.S. Ambassador and to pres-
sure Ukraine President Zelensky to an-
nounce an investigation of one of the 
President’s political rivals. Part of the 
plot 
to 
remove 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch involved hiring a cheap 
Republican operative to follow her 
around and monitor her movements. 
How low can they go? 
Just when you think that President 
Trump and his network couldn’t pos-
sibly get any more into the muck, re-
ports suggest they are even dirtier 
than you could imagine. I saw a nov-
elist on TV this morning. He said: If I 
had brought this plot to my publisher, 
he would have rejected it. He would 
have said it was absurd, that it could 
never happen, and that people will not 
believe it. 
Well, here it is, led by President 
Trump, who, again, cares not for the 
morals, ethics, and honor of this coun-
try as much as he cares about himself. 
To allegedly have some cut-rate po-
litical operative stalk an American 
Ambassador at the direction of the 
President’s lawyer, potentially with 
the President’s ‘‘knowledge and con-
sent’’—that is what one of the emails 
read—I mean, how much more can 
America take in the decline of our 
morals, our values, and our standing in 
the world? 
I don’t care who you are—Democrat, 
Republican, 
liberal, 
conservative. 
Doesn’t this kind of thing bother you if 
anyone does it, let alone the President 
of the United States? 
I don’t know how any Member of this 
body could pick up the newspaper this 
morning, read this new revelation, and 
not conclude that the Senate needs ac-
cess to relevant documents like these 
in the trial of President Trump. The re-
lease of this new information dramati-
cally underscores the need for wit-
nesses and for documents. 
The Republican leader has, so far, op-
posed Democratic requests to call for 
factfinding witnesses and to subpoena 
three specific sets of relevant docu-
ments. Despite their having no argu-
ment against them, the Republicans’ 
position at the moment is to punt the 
question of witnesses and documents 
until after both sides finish their pres-
entations. Then, they say they will 
consider documents and witnesses with 
an open mind. 
The Democrats have requested four 
fact witnesses. They are the Presi-
dent’s top advisers, like Mr. Mulvaney. 
They are not the Democrats’ men. 
They are the President’s men. They are 
not Democratic witnesses. They are 
not our witnesses. They are just wit-
nesses, plain and simple. Each of them 
has firsthand information about the 
charges against the President. 
So, as the House prepares to send the 
articles to the Senate today, it is time 
for us—all of us—to turn to the serious 
job of conducting a fair trial, one that 
the American people will accept as 
fair, not as a coverup and not as some-
thing that has hidden the evidence. 
The focus of Senators on both sides 
must fall on the question of witnesses 
and documents. 
f 
CHINA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on 
China, later this morning the President 
is expected to take part in the signing 
ceremony for the so-called phase 1 
trade agreement with China. 
Now, I have commended the Presi-
dent for his instincts when it has come 
to China. At one point, his instincts 
were to be strong and tough. I have 
compared his stances previously to 
those of previous administrations. I 
was rooting for the President to suc-
ceed for the sake of jobs and wealth 
and the economy in this country, and I 
told him that personally. So this phase 
1 deal is an extreme disappointment to 
me and to millions and millions of 
Americans who want to see us make 
China play fairly. President Trump’s 
phase 1 trade deal with China is a his-
toric blunder. Several harmful policies 
and 
practices 
are 
reportedly 
unaddressed. 
First, there appear to be no commit-
ments to end China’s subsidy program 
that continues to hurt U.S. industries 
and workers at all levels. 
Second, there appear to be no com-
mitments to reform the Chinese policy 
of state-owned enterprises, which un-
fairly compete with American enter-
prises and take American jobs away 
while they are allowed to freely sell 
here and while our best companies 
can’t sell there. 
Third, there appear to be no commit-
ments to curtail the illegal dumping of 
Chinese products into our markets, 
which puts American firms out of busi-
ness and workers out of jobs. 
Fourth, glaringly, there appear to be 
no significant commitments to defi-
nitely end China’s predatory and fla-
grant cyber theft of American intellec-
tual property, which has stolen a gen-
eration of American jobs and American 
wealth. 
Fifth, 
concerning 
what 
the 
deal 
achieves in terms of agricultural pur-
chases, it appears the Trump adminis-
tration has not addressed the fact that 
China has existing contracts with 
countries like Brazil and Argentina. It 
doesn’t need any more of our products, 
certainly not in the numbers that have 
been talked about, and the agreement 
does not grapple with the fact that 
American farmers have already lost 
billions, have watched their markets 
disappear, and have gone bankrupt in 
the time it has taken the President to 
reach the deal. 
Reading the reporting of phase one of 
the trade deal feels like watching a bad 
rerun of the past 10 years of botched 
trade negotiations with China. I fear 
that President Xi is laughing at us be-
hind our backs for having gained so 
much at our expense. The United 
States concedes our leverage, and in 
exchange, China makes vague, unen-
forceable promises it never intends to 
fulfill. We have seen this over and over 
again. China agrees to something, and 
they don’t do it. 
President Trump complained about 
President Obama and President Bush 
and others when they signed these 
deals and nothing happened, and he is 
doing the same darn thing—the same 
darn thing. It is no wonder they 
haven’t made it public. They are afraid 
that when people actually read it, they 
will see that it is not good for America 
and that the Chinese took us hook, 
line, and sinker. 
If I sound frustrated and angry, it is 
because I am. Even today, an hour be-
fore the deal is signed by the President, 
I have to use phrases like ‘‘appear to’’ 
and ‘‘according to reports’’ because the 
administration has shrouded the de-
tails of the agreement in secrecy and 
kept the text of the deal under lock 
and key. The Trump administration 
doesn’t want the details of the agree-
ment to come out before they can spin 
it because it knows that once the de-
tails come out, everyone will see that 
China has taken President Trump to 
the cleaners. President Trump, the 
great negotiator, has been totally out- 
negotiated by President Xi. 
Just like on impeachment, the Presi-
dent and his team are afraid of the 
truth. They don’t want anyone to see 
the facts or the truth; they just want 
to spin. If the Trump administration 
were proud of this deal, they would 
hold it up to the world and shout it 
from the mountaintops. Instead, they 
have kept it hidden. They want to spin 
it, but they can’t spin away the fact 
that this deal is a bad deal for Amer-
ican workers, American companies, 
American jobs, and American wealth. 
Even today—the day the agreement 
will be signed—we have been told we 
may not get all the details. 
Given the absurd secrecy surrounding 
President Trump’s phase one trade 
deal, I expect that once everyone gets 
to take a look at it in the light of day, 
they will find that the administration 
has signed one of the most tragically 
one-sided agreements in recent mem-
ory. 
Even the farmers—President Trump 
sold out the structural changes to try 
to help the farmers—when they look at 
the specifics, they are going to see that

they are a lot less than meets the eye 
and that our farmers will continue to 
suffer. 
It was an opportunity to secure real 
reforms to China’s rapacious trade and 
industrial 
policy. 
President 
Trump 
may have just squandered it indefi-
nitely—a severe and potentially irrep-
arable loss for the American people, 
American businesses, American work-
ers. 
Given how poorly trade deal one was 
executed with China, I have virtually 
no faith that trade deal two, if it ever 
comes about, will be any better. In 
fact, most Americans should fear it if 
it is anything like this one. 
f 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on the 
wall, yesterday the Washington Post 
reported that the Trump administra-
tion is planning to divert $7.2 billion in 
funding from the Defense Department 
to fund his border wall with Mexico. 
Once again, the administration pro-
poses stealing this funding from mili-
tary families and counterdrug pro-
grams, bringing the total amount that 
the President has stolen—stolen—from 
our troops and our families to over $13 
billion. 
The last time the President took 
money away from military construc-
tion, serious military projects suf-
fered—schools in Kentucky, medical fa-
cilities in North Carolina, and hurri-
cane recovery projects in Florida. Now 
the President wants to take even more 
money away from these projects for a 
border wall that he promised Mexico 
would pay for. This is another slap in 
the face to our Armed Forces, their 
families, and all of the places through-
out America that have military bases 
that need new construction funding. 
Some Senate Democrats strongly op-
pose this action. We will continue to 
oppose the transfer of counterdrug 
funding for the wall, and we will force 
yet another vote to terminate the 
President’s bogus national emergency 
declaration and return these much 
needed military construction funds 
back to the military, to the men and 
women in our Armed Forces, and to 
their families. Our Republican friends, 
hopefully, will join us in that vote. 
President Trump is once again sub-
verting the will of Congress—once 
again thumbing his nose at the Con-
stitution. The Founders gave Congress 
the power of the purse, not the Presi-
dent, and this Chamber has refused re-
peatedly to fund the President’s wall. 
But whether it is to Federal appropria-
tions, foreign policy, or our oversight 
authority, President Trump seems to 
have 
little 
regard 
for 
constraints 
placed on the Executive. He seems to 
view the Constitution as merely a nui-
sance, some inconvenient obstacle in 
the way of his personal and political 
interests. It is time for Democrats and 
Republicans to say: Enough. 
I would say one final thing to my 
conservative friends. The true founda-
tion of conservatism is to minimize the 
powers of government, particularly the 
Executive, because they believe it pro-
vides more room for the individual. 
Where are our conservative voices 
when Donald Trump, in issue after 
issue—one of the most egregious being 
this border wall—takes the power away 
from Congress, away from the Amer-
ican people, and arrogates it onto his 
own personal wishes? 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

f 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA 
TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, it ap-
pears that we are likely to be consid-
ering some version of the USMCA, im-
plementing legislation this week, so I 
want to address this agreement, but in 
order to do that, I think we have to 
start with the underlying NAFTA 
agreement, which has been in place for 
some years, and ask a question, which 
is, Why did we go down the path of re-
negotiating NAFTA in the first place? 
Let’s start there. 
As I can imagine, one reason that one 
might want to renegotiate a trade 
agreement is if the trade agreement in 
question were not a reciprocal agree-
ment. If it treated one party dif-
ferently than it treated the other par-
ties, then you might question whether 
that is a fair arrangement and might 
decide that if it is not, it needs to be 
revisited. That certainly would not de-
scribe NAFTA. NAFTA is entirely re-
ciprocal. 
Another reason one might decide to 
renegotiate a trade agreement is if 
there were tariffs—meaning it wasn’t 
really a free-trade agreement; it was an 
agreement that maybe changed the 
terms of trade. But if you still had tar-
iffs, you might decide, as a free-trader 
like me, that it would be a good idea to 
renegotiate so that we can eliminate 
the remaining tariffs. 
Well, that certainly isn’t the motiva-
tion, either, because with NAFTA, 
there are zero tariffs on 100 percent of 
manufactured goods that cross the bor-
ders of any of the three countries that 
are parties and zero tariffs on 97.5 per-
cent of agricultural goods. So really 
there is not much more to do on the 
tariff side. 
By the way, that is true about any 
other kinds of restrictions on trade. 
There are no quotas, no obstacles. This 
is a free-trade agreement. That is what 
it is. It is fair, it is free, and it is recip-
rocal among the three countries. As a 
matter of fact, since NAFTA was 
adopted, U.S. exports to Mexico, for in-
stance, have increased 500 percent. 
That is true of Pennsylvania exports to 
Mexico, as it is on average for all 50 
States. 
I will state that modernizing the 
agreement always made sense, right? 
We now have this huge digital economy 
that did not exist back in the early 
nineties when NAFTA was adopted, so 
it definitely makes sense—it always 
makes sense to modernize, to update. 
But I think it is very clear that mod-
ernizing and updating were not the 
driving motivations for renegotiating 
NAFTA and adopting USMCA. The fun-
damental reason was that we have a 
trade deficit with Mexico. It is pretty 
persistent every year. It is not a huge 
deficit, but we have a trade deficit with 
Mexico, and that was deemed to be un-
acceptable to the administration. 
So the fundamental purpose of re-
negotiating NAFTA and the reason 
Mexico and Canada had to be coerced 
into this new agreement was so that we 
could diminish exports from Mexico. 
Despite the fact that economists uni-
versally understand that a trade deficit 
with a country like Mexico is a mean-
ingless measure, nevertheless, that is 
the goal. 
Since trade in cars and car parts is 
the source of the trade deficit with 
Mexico, it is the auto sector that bears 
the brunt of the restrictions. 
Let me suggest that one useful way 
to think about USMCA is that it is 
NAFTA 
with 
two 
categories 
of 
changes. The first category is the mod-
est constructive modernizations I al-
luded to. They are mostly taken from 
the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agree-
ment that had been negotiated by a 
previous administration. Examples in-
clude requiring that there be free dig-
ital trade. So you can’t impose a tax on 
a data transfer, for instance, or you 
can’t impose a tariff on software, and 
you can’t require that data be stored 
locally. These are good things. 
It is important to note they are codi-
fying existing practices. Canada, Mex-
ico, and the United States do not cur-
rently impose obstacles and tariffs on 
this kind of economic activity. Under 
USMCA, they won’t be able to; it will 
be codified. So we will make perma-
nent that which is already the prac-
tice. There is a very, very tiny reduc-
tion in Canadian protectionism with 
respect to dairy products. 
For the most part, these modernizing 
features are modest, they come from 
TPP, but most importantly, they could 
have been achieved without the second 
category of changes I am about to de-
scribe. They could have been achieved 
because they weren’t really controver-
sial. 
The other important category of 
changes to NAFTA that USMCA con-
tains is a full series of protectionist 
measures that are designed to diminish 
trade and/or investment. So for the 
first time in certainly modern times, 
we are going to consider a trade agree-
ment that is designed to diminish 
trade, which should be very disturbing 
for those of us who understand how

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S209 
January 15, 2020 
much economic growth comes from 
trade. 
What are some of the specifics? Well, 
the specific changes that are meant to 
diminish trade—as I said, the auto sec-
tor bears the brunt of it. It really is the 
end of free trade in automobiles and 
auto parts with respect to Mexico. The 
agreement imposes minimum wage re-
quirements that are designed to be im-
possible for Mexican factories to meet, 
and when they don’t meet them, Mexi-
can autos and auto parts will be sub-
ject to a tax. So Americans who buy 
these cars will have to pay a tax on 
them. This is designed to make Mexico 
and Mexican factories less productive. 
We have folks who think that is 
somehow a good thing for the United 
States. It is not. This minimum wage 
requirement and the tariffs that will 
follow from it will simply make the en-
tire North American auto industry less 
competitive because we have inte-
grated supply chains, and American do-
mestic manufacturers use parts that 
originate in Mexico. Those parts will 
now be more expensive. It will mean 
higher prices for American consumers, 
who will have to pay more money for a 
car and therefore will have less money 
available for any of the other things 
they would like to consume. It will 
probably lead to an increase or accel-
eration in the shift to automation be-
cause when you artificially establish 
an 
arbitrary 
wage 
rate 
that 
is 
unaffordable, it creates an incentive to 
avoid labor costs entirely with automa-
tion. All of that means fewer jobs. 
We are already seeing a reduction. 
We have a terrific economy generally, 
but the manufacturing sector is actu-
ally not participating in this tremen-
dous expansion. We have been losing 
jobs in manufacturing as a result of 
tariffs we have been imposing. 
With the full anticipation of this 
agreement coming, the auto sector in 
the United States of America has been 
shedding jobs. We have been losing jobs 
as employers in this sector see where 
we are heading on this policy. That is 
one item. 
Another way we are restricting trade 
is by arbitrarily putting an expiration 
date on this trade agreement. It ex-
pires 16 years from the date of enact-
ment. There is a mechanism by which, 
if all three parties unanimously and si-
multaneously agree, they can extend 
it, but the default setting is for this 
thing to go away, for this to expire. 
We have never put a termination 
date on a trade agreement. On all of 
the trade agreements we have done— 
and there are dozens—we have never 
had an expiration, and there is a good 
reason. The reason is, as you get any-
where close toward that expiration 
date, an uncertainty emerges about 
what the trade regime would be like if 
the agreement is not extended. That 
has a chilling effect on trade and in-
vestment, so it is a very bad idea. 
Our Trade Rep has argued that, well, 
these trade agreements ought to be re-
negotiated periodically anyway. First 
of all, not necessarily—a free and fair 
and reciprocal trade agreement that 
has no barriers to trade doesn’t nec-
essarily need to be renegotiated with 
any specific frequency, and secondly, it 
can be renegotiated without an expira-
tion. The question is, What is the de-
fault setting? Do we assume the ar-
rangement continues, or do we assume 
the arrangement ends? Unfortunately, 
in USMCA, it all comes to an end. 
There is another provision that is 
very disturbing, and that is the almost 
complete destruction of what is known 
as the investor-state dispute mecha-
nism. This is the mechanism by which 
American investors in Canada and 
Mexico, in this case, can adjudicate a 
dispute because sometimes the local 
court in those countries does not treat 
the foreign investor—the American in-
vestor—in that country fairly. That 
happens sometimes. 
So 50 or more of our bilateral invest-
ment treaties and trade agreements 
have this mechanism, the investor- 
state dispute settlement mechanism, 
so that if an American investor or an 
American employer with an invest-
ment overseas in one of these countries 
is being treated unfairly, they have a 
place to go to get a fair adjudication of 
their dispute. 
In March of 2018, 22 currently serving 
Republican Senators sent a letter to 
the Trade Representative. It says: 
‘‘ISDS provisions at least as strong as 
those contained in the existing NAFTA 
must be included in the modernized 
agreement to win congressional sup-
port.’’ 
There is actually a broad consensus 
about its importance, which is why it 
is in every other trade agreement we 
have ever had. But USMCA completely 
guts these investor protections. It lim-
its it very narrowly to just several sec-
tors in Mexico and eliminates it en-
tirely in Canada. The irony of this is, 
in the 30 years that we have had these 
investor-state dispute settlement pro-
visions, every time the United States 
was a litigant, the United States won. 
This has been a jurisdiction that has 
been very, very helpful to the United 
States, and we have given it away. It is 
out the door. That is because there are 
some, I think, advocates for elimi-
nating this who think, in a classic pro-
tectionist mindset, that an investment 
in another country necessarily comes 
at an expense to investment in Amer-
ica. That is completely wrong. Most in-
vestment overseas is meant to serve 
overseas markets, and it results in jobs 
in the United States in management 
and supervision and accounting and 
planning and all kinds of aspects of 
overseeing that investment overseas. 
But now we are going to have a chill 
imposed on this activity. 
Well, those provisions I just de-
scribed were the deal as it was reached 
back in May, and at that point, our 
Democratic colleagues said that the 
agreement was not acceptable. So our 
Trade Rep and a number of House 
Members, in particular, entered into a 
whole new series of negotiations, and 
from there, the agreement got worse. 
What happened there—let me talk 
about just a couple of categories. One 
is a whole set of labor provisions. Basi-
cally, the United States forced Mexico 
to pass labor laws designed to facilitate 
the unionization of their factories. It is 
none of our business what the labor 
laws are in Mexico, but we forced them 
to pass these laws. 
Then it gets worse. The USMCA cre-
ates this elaborate mechanism by 
which American taxpayers are forced 
to pay to enforce Mexican labor laws. 
Richard Trumka, from the AFL–CIO, 
said: ‘‘For the first time there truly 
will be enforceable labor standards—in-
cluding a process that allows for the 
inspections of factories and facilities 
that are not living up to their obliga-
tions.’’ 
So he is alluding to the mechanism 
that is established in USMCA to allow 
site inspections. I remind my col-
leagues that this agreement is fully re-
ciprocal. I wonder how much American 
businesses are going to appreciate hav-
ing Mexican inspectors come in to in-
spect their facilities to see if they are 
in compliance with American labor 
law. This is there because it is per-
ceived to be in organized labor’s eco-
nomic interests. 
First, it increases the expense and di-
minishes the productivity of Mexican 
plants, which some people think is a 
good thing. I think it is a bad thing for 
American consumers to have to pay 
more than necessary. But in any case, 
American taxpayers are going to pay 
hundreds of millions of dollars over 
years to enforce another country’s 
labor laws. 
Another provision that was insisted 
on in the latter parts of the negotia-
tion is the removal of intellectual 
property protection for biologics. As 
you know, biologics are complex new 
medicines derived from living cells. It 
is one of the most exciting things in 
medicine because it has allowed sci-
entists to use living organisms—or 
these cells from living organisms—to 
produce wonderful, wonderful curative 
medicines. It is very exciting. 
Under U.S. law, when a business de-
velops such a new medicine, which 
comes at enormous cost to get it to 
market, we provide 12 years’ worth of 
what we call data exclusivity. It is the 
exclusive ability to market that medi-
cine so that the company can recoup 
the billions of dollars that are spent 
developing it. 
Well, 12 years is the period of protec-
tion we provide for that intellectual 
property. When the Trans-Pacific Part-
nership 
was 
being 
negotiated, 
the 
Obama administration insisted on at 
least 8 years. We are the only country 
that is, by far, the leading country in 
developing this new category of medi-
cine. We are the ones who have the in-
centive to protect this intellectual 
property. 
Other 
countries—such 
as 
Mexico, Canada, and other countries 
around the world—don’t really care

about protecting it because it is not 
theirs. They argue for less intellectual 
property protection; we argue for more. 
That is the general nature of the con-
text. 
As I said, under the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership, everybody had agreed on 8 
years. Not in USMCA. In USMCA, we 
agreed to zero—zero—no period of data 
exclusivity to protect the intellectual 
property of this very exciting, new 
kind of medicine. This is so ironic be-
cause right now—as an aside—we are in 
this ongoing, protracted, tough battle 
with China over a number of their eco-
nomic practices. Chief among them is 
their theft of intellectual property. We 
are rightly insisting that we are going 
to defend and protect our intellectual 
property because it is the crown jewel 
of the American economy. The most 
precious thing we have is the cre-
ativity of the American people. So we 
are insisting that we have robust pro-
tection for intellectual property. Here, 
in USMCA, we give it away. We just 
give it away. 
There is another aspect of this that 
is important to consider, and that is 
that there is not going to be any boost 
to economic growth as a result of swap-
ping out NAFTA for USMCA. The U.S. 
International 
Trade 
Commission, 
which is an independent agency, part of 
the U.S. Federal Government, did a 
big, extensive study, and they did a re-
port. 
Their report said that USMCA will 
create a net of 176,000 jobs. Well, if that 
were true, it would be trivial in the 
context of our economy. Our economy 
has been creating more than that num-
ber of jobs every month for years now. 
It is a tiny number for 72 months when 
we have been producing more jobs than 
that each and every month—not over 72 
months. But worse than being a very 
small number, it is just not true. The 
study says that, on balance, the trade 
restrictive provisions, some of which I 
alluded to, will diminish trade and 
cause U.S. growth to decline, and any 
offsetting growth just comes from re-
ducing the uncertainty about whether 
the free trade and digital trade that I 
alluded to continues. 
However, the ITC cost-benefit anal-
ysis explicitly chose not to attempt to 
quantify the sunset clause. There is no 
question that is a negative. They didn’t 
even attempt to quantify it. They did 
their analysis before these new labor 
provisions and before the abandonment 
of protection for intellectual property 
of biologics—before that even emerged 
on the scene. We know those have a 
negative effect on growth. The bottom 
line is, there is going to be no addi-
tional economic growth from this 
agreement. 
But there is a tax increase. The Con-
gressional Budget Office did their anal-
ysis, and they concluded—rightly—that 
there will be tariffs added to the sales 
of cars. American consumers will be 
paying a tax increase in the form of 
this tariff on autos and auto parts. 
That is definitely part of this agree-
ment. 
To conclude on the substantive mat-
ters, we took a true free trade agree-
ment, and we added some constructive 
features. We did some modernizing 
from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, 
which was constructive, but then we 
slapped on an expiration date. We im-
posed costly new restrictions on one of 
our trading partners. We eliminated 
the dispute settlement mechanism for 
U.S. investors. We dropped the intellec-
tual property protection for the most 
innovative medicines we have. We sad-
dled American taxpayers with $84 mil-
lion over 4 years to enforce Mexican 
labor and environmental laws. For all 
of this, we get basically no additional 
economic growth—probably a little bit. 
It is worth noting that the Members 
of this body who have proudly and 
openly opposed every trade agreement 
they have ever been asked to cast a 
vote on—they voted no. On this, they 
are going to vote yes. For the first 
time in two decades, the AFL–CIO is 
supporting a trade deal when they have 
opposed all free trade agreements. 
There is a reason. It is because we are 
going backward on trade. It is because 
this agreement is designed to limit 
trade. 
A quick word on process here—this is 
important. The implementing legisla-
tion that is going to get to the floor 
one way or another sometime soon is 
not compliant with trade promotion 
authority. What that means is, it 
should not get the expedited treatment 
and the protection from all amend-
ments that trade promotion authority 
confers on a narrow category of legisla-
tion that conforms completely—com-
pletely—with the trade promotion au-
thority law. 
Let’s remember a few fundamental 
things here. Trade policy is the respon-
sibility of Congress. The Constitution 
assigns it to the U.S. Congress to es-
tablish trade policy, including the es-
tablishment of tariffs, the management 
of tariffs, and everything to do with 
trade. 
With TPA, we delegate the responsi-
bility that is ours to the executive 
branch with a lot of conditions at-
tached, and if they don’t comply with 
those conditions, then this legislation 
shouldn’t be whisked through Congress 
on a simple majority vote with no 
amendments, which is meant, under 
TPA, to be limited only to those pieces 
of legislation that comply entirely 
with the trade promotion act legisla-
tion. 
Here are a couple of specific ways in 
which this agreement violates the 
trade promotion authority. First of all, 
Congress did not receive the final 
agreement according to the timeframe 
contemplated by TPA. We are supposed 
to get the final agreement 30 days be-
fore there is a vote in committee or on 
the floor on the implementing lan-
guage. The reason that is important is 
so that Congress can give some feed-
back to the administration. This is a 
draft that is meant to be a draft of the 
implementing legislation submitted to 
Congress so that Congress can then 
consider how it might want to make 
changes since this is, after all, our re-
sponsibility. The administration chose 
not to do that at all. They finalized 
this agreement in early to mid-Decem-
ber, and there was a vote on the House 
floor on the final version of the imple-
menting language within a week or 
so—nothing close to the 30-day period 
that is meant to enable Congress to in-
fluence its own product. 
There is another provision in the 
trade promotion authority legislation 
that requires that the implementing 
legislation must contain only provi-
sions ‘‘strictly necessary or appro-
priate to implement such trade agree-
ment.’’ Why is that important? It is be-
cause we passed this legislation with a 
51-vote 
threshold—simple 
majority 
threshold. Almost everything else in 
the Senate requires 60 votes. So we are 
saying that if you want to use the ex-
pedited process and if you want to be 
able to pass this legislation with a sim-
ple majority, you have to limit it only 
to that which is absolutely strictly 
necessary and appropriate for imple-
menting this trade agreement; other-
wise, obviously, people could stick in 
any old thing they want that they 
think there is a majority vote for if 
there are not 60 votes for it. In other 
words, abusing this narrow construct 
really dramatically underlines the 60- 
vote threshold for legislation in the 
Senate. 
Well, let me give you a few examples 
of cases where it is clearly being 
abused in this agreement. One is that 
there are appropriations in the imple-
menting legislation. This is a complete 
first. In all of our trade agreements in 
the past, there has been a necessity for 
some spending. The appropriations bill 
to spend that money has always been a 
separate legislative vehicle precisely so 
that it would be open to scrutiny, sub-
ject to amendment, and subject to a 60- 
vote threshold. Not this time. The hun-
dreds of millions of dollars of spending 
in this bill include, for instance, $50 
million in salaries and expenses for the 
office of the U.S. Trade Rep. Well, 
maybe the folks at the U.S. Trade Rep 
all deserve a big raise; maybe that is 
true. But that should be done in a sepa-
rate piece of legislation because it is 
not necessary and appropriate for the 
implementation of USMCA. Not only 
that, but they have taken all of this 
spending and imposed an emergency 
designation on it. There is an emer-
gency designation on it. So, appar-
ently, it is an emergency that the folks 
over at the U.S. Trade Rep’s office get 
a pay raise. Apparently it is an emer-
gency that all this money be spent. 
That is ridiculous; of course it is not. 
The reason they put the emergency 
designation on it is that spending in 
this body—spending in Congress that 
gets an emergency designation doesn’t 
have to be offset. So if it exceeds the 
permissible 
maximum 
spending 
we 
have all agreed to and if you slap on an 
emergency designation, then that is

OK. If you don’t have the emergency 
designation, then new spending has to 
be offset with reduction in spending 
somewhere else. 
The reason we have the emergency 
designation is that emergencies actu-
ally can occur. There are earthquakes; 
there are fires; there are floods; and 
those happen. But I am sorry, a pay 
raise for staffers at the U.S. Trade Rep 
does not qualify. 
So, for a variety of reasons, this leg-
islation we are going to be considering 
is not compliant with trade promotion 
authority. That doesn’t mean it can’t 
move. It simply means it needs to 
move under the regular order. It should 
be an ordinary bill on the floor as any 
ordinary legislation, and, sadly, from 
my point of view, I am pretty sure the 
votes are there to pass it. There are 
probably going to be the votes to pass 
what I think is a badly flawed agree-
ment—an 
agreement 
that 
restricts 
trade rather than expanding trade. I 
certainly hope we will do it under the 
regular order because it does abuse 
trade promotion authority. 
The last point I would make is that I 
certainly hope this does not become a 
template for future trade agreements. 
We have an opportunity to do wonders 
for our constituents, our consumers, 
and our workers by reaching new and 
additional trade agreements with the 
UK, Japan, Vietnam, and all kinds of 
countries that have tremendous growth 
potential, and our economy will grow if 
we can work out mutual free trade 
agreements with these countries. I am 
very much in favor of that. I wouldn’t 
want these protectionist, restrictionist 
policies that found their way into this 
agreement to be part of future agree-
ments. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, about 4 
weeks after the House voted on the Ar-
ticles of Impeachment, the House will 
name impeachment managers, and we 
will see those Impeachment Articles 
delivered here to the Senate, but for 
the impeachment managers’ role in the 
Senate, that will conclude the House’s 
participation in the impeachment proc-
ess, and ours—the Senate’s responsibil-
ities—will begin. 
As I said, this vote occurs 4 weeks 
after the House concluded its whirl-
wind impeachment investigation. As I 
look more and more closely at this, it 
strikes me as a potential case of im-
peachment malpractice, and I will ex-
plain. 
Four weeks after they passed these 
two Articles of Impeachment, 4 weeks 
after they concluded the President has 
acted in a way to invoke our most ex-
treme constitutional sanction that he 
should be removed from office, they fi-
nally will send these Impeachment Ar-
ticles to us. 
As I look at the Impeachment Arti-
cles, I am astonished that even though 
we heard discussions of quid pro quo, 
bribery, and other crimes, the House of 
Representatives chose not to charge 
President Trump with a crime. How 
you then go on to prove a violation of 
the constitutional standard of high 
crimes and misdemeanors when you 
don’t even charge the President with a 
crime, I am looking forward to having 
the impeachment managers and the 
President’s lawyers address that. At 
least at first blush, it does not appear 
to meet the constitutional standard of 
bribery, treason, high crimes, and mis-
demeanors. 
President Clinton was charged with a 
crime—the crime of perjury—but, here, 
President Trump has not been accused 
of a crime. The vague allegation is that 
he abused his office. That can mean 
anything to anybody. Just think, if we 
dumb down the standard for impeach-
ment below the constitutional stand-
ard, what that does is it opens up the 
next President, who may have a House 
majority composed of the other party, 
vulnerable to charges of impeachment 
based on the allegation that he abused 
his office, even if they did not commit 
a high crime or misdemeanor. So im-
peachment becomes a political weapon, 
which is what this appears to be, rather 
than a constitutional obligation for the 
House and the Senate. 
Last month, the chairman of the 
House Judiciary Committee, JERRY 
NADLER, said on national television it 
was a ‘‘rock-solid case’’ against the 
President—‘‘rock-solid,’’ but in the mo-
ments after the House voted to im-
peach the President, there seemed to 
be a lot of doubt about whether there 
was sufficient evidence to convict the 
President of high crimes and mis-
demeanors; so much doubt, in fact, 
that it led the Speaker of the House to 
withhold the articles until the Senate 
promised to fill in the gaps left by the 
House’s inadequate record. 
She sought promises from Senator 
MCCONNELL, the majority leader, that 
the Senate would continue the House’s 
investigation—continue the House’s in-
vestigation—the one which only a few 
weeks prior one of her top Members 
said was a rock-solid case. Well, it ei-
ther is or isn’t. 
I would say that the Speaker’s ac-
tions and her cold feet and her reluc-
tance to send the Impeachment Arti-
cles here for the last month indicate to 
me that she is less than confident that 
the House has done their job. 
As a matter of fact, in the second Ar-
ticle of Impeachment, they charged the 
President with obstruction of Congress. 
Here is the factual underpinning of 
that 
allegation: 
Chairman 
SCHIFF 
would issue a subpoena to somebody 
who works at the White House. They 
would say: Well, I have to go to court 
to get the judge to direct me because I 
have conflicting obligations—a sub-
poena from Congress and perhaps a 
claim of some privilege based on con-
fidential 
communications 
with 
the 
President. Rather than pursue that in 
court, which is what happened in the 
Clinton impeachment and what should 
happen in any dispute over executive 
privilege, Chairman ADAM
SCHIFF
of 
the 
House 
Intelligence 
Committee 
dropped them like a hot potato, and 
they simply moved on in their rush to 
impeach without that testimony and 
without that evidence. So now they 
want the Senate to make up for their 
failure here by calling additional wit-
nesses. 
I sometimes joke that I am a recov-
ering lawyer and a recovering judge. I 
spent 20 years or more of my life either 
in courtrooms trying cases or presiding 
over those cases or reviewing the cases 
that had been tried based on an appel-
late record in the Texas Supreme 
Court. 
Our system of justice is based on an 
adversary system. You have the pros-
ecutor who charges a crime—that is ba-
sically what the Articles of Impeach-
ment are analogous to—and then you 
have a jury and a judge who try the 
case presented by the prosecution. We 
have a strange, even bizarre, sugges-
tion by the Democratic leader in the 
Senate that somehow the jury ought to 
call additional witnesses before we 
even listen to the arguments of the 
President, his lawyers, and the im-
peachment managers who spent 12 
weeks getting 100 hours or more worth 
of testimony from 17 different wit-
nesses. 
So this discussion about whether 
there will be witnesses or no witnesses 
is kind of maddening to me. Of course, 
there 
will 
be 
witnesses—witnesses 
whom 
the 
impeachment 
managers 
choose to present, maybe through their 
sworn testimony and not live in the 
well of the Senate, but it is no different 
in terms of its legal effect, or witnesses 
and evidence, documentary evidence, 
that the President’s lawyers choose to 
present. 
I think the majority leader has wise-
ly proposed—and now it looks like 53 
Senators have agreed—that we defer 
this whole issue of additional witnesses 
until after both sides have had the 
chance to present their case and Sen-
ators have a chance to ask questions in 
writing. 
This is going to be a very difficult 
process for people who make their liv-
ing talking all the time, which is what 
Senators do. Sitting here and being 
forced to listen and let other people do 
the talking is going to be a challenge, 
but we will have a chance to ask ques-
tions in writing, and the Chief Justice 
will direct those questions to the ap-
propriate party—either the impeach-
ment managers or the President’s law-
yers—and they will attempt to answer 
those questions. 
As I look at this record more, I am 
beginning to wonder whether the basic

January 15, 2020 
facts are really disputed. So when peo-
ple talk about calling additional wit-
nesses, I think what they are more in-
terested in is a show trial and getting 
cameras and media coverage rather 
than actually resolving any disputed 
facts and applying the legal standard— 
which is what the Constitution pro-
vides—in order to decide whether the 
President should be acquitted or con-
victed. That should be the role of the 
Senate sitting as a jury. 
The House, it seems, was under no 
deadline—other than an internally im-
posed deadline—to complete their im-
peachment investigation. They could 
have subpoenaed more witnesses. They 
could have waited for those subpoenas 
to play their way out in court and held 
a vote once they truly believed they 
had sufficient evidence to impeach the 
President, enough evidence that they 
felt confident presenting at a Senate 
trial. 
If a prosecutor were to do in a court 
of law what the House impeachment in-
quiry did, they would be justly accused 
of malpractice. To drop the witnesses 
rather than to actually go to court to 
try to get the testimony you need in 
order to support the Articles of Im-
peachment, that is malpractice be-
cause you know if this were a court of 
law, in all likelihood, the judge would 
summarily dismiss the case, saying: 
You haven’t shown the evidence to sup-
port the charges that the grand jury— 
in this case, the House—has made 
under the Articles of Impeachment. 
We know that rather than develop 
the record that would be sufficient to 
prove their case, Members of the House 
gave themselves an arbitrary deadline 
for their investigation and made speed 
their top priority. Now finding them-
selves with the short end of the stick, 
they are trying to pin their regrets and 
their malpractice on Members of the 
Senate. 
Our Democratic colleagues are trying 
to paint the picture in a way that 
makes it look like Senate Republicans 
are failing in their duties, but we will 
fulfill our constitutional role and du-
ties. The only question is, did the 
House perform their constitutional du-
ties in an adequate way to meet the 
constitutional standard? 
Speaker PELOSI went so far as to say 
that failing to allow additional wit-
nesses would result in a ‘‘coverup.’’ I 
think I have heard that same charge by 
the Democratic leader here. I don’t 
really understand the logic of that one. 
It seems like the only coverup hap-
pening is when the Speaker is covering 
up her caucus’s shoddy and insufficient 
investigation. 
She is trying to distract from the 
fact that there is very little, if any, 
evidence to support the Articles of Im-
peachment. She is trying to place the 
blame on the Senate—a strategy you 
don’t have to have x-ray vision to see 
through. 
The Speaker went so far as to say 
last Sunday that Senators will ‘‘pay a 
price’’ for not calling witnesses, but I 
think they are now beginning to take 
the mask off and expose their true mo-
tivation. Based on what we know now, 
this is no longer about 67 votes to con-
vict and remove President Trump; this 
is about forcing Senators who are run-
ning for election in 2020 to take tough 
political votes that can be then ex-
ploited in TV ads. That seems to me to 
demean this whole impeachment affair. 
This is a thermonuclear weapon in a 
constitutional sense. To accuse some-
one of high crimes and misdemeanors 
and to seek to convict them in a court 
and remove them from office is a very 
serious matter, but it has been treated 
and is being treated like a trivial polit-
ical matter, a political football. 
Based on the way that Speaker 
PELOSI and others have characterized 
the need for additional witnesses, you 
would think no one had testified before 
or had been deposed. But that would be 
to ignore the House Intelligence Com-
mittee’s 298-page report—a 298-page re-
port—detailing their impeachment in-
quiry. It details the actions of the com-
mittee, including dozens of subpoenas 
and the taking of more than 100 hours 
of testimony from 17 witnesses. So 
when somebody says this is a question 
of witnesses or no witnesses, I say that 
is not true. Those are not the facts. We 
already have 100 hours of testimony 
that could be presented in the Senate if 
it is actually relevant to the Articles 
of Impeachment, to what is charged. 
To be clear, all the information will 
be available to the Senate, and the tes-
timony of 17 of those witnesses will 
likely be presented by the impeach-
ment managers. 
Again, our Democratic friends in the 
House apparently are having a little 
bit of buyer’s remorse, cold feet. Pick 
your metaphor. With 4 weeks of deep 
contemplation separating them from 
the impeachment vote they took, they 
no longer believe, apparently, that 
they have enough evidence to prove a 
high crime and misdemeanor, which is 
the constitutional standard. As for 
that 298-page report that they were 
once so proud of, apparently now they 
concede by their actions that it falls 
short of that rock-solid case they 
promised. So rather than taking re-
sponsibility for their own impeachment 
malpractice, rather than admitting 
that they rushed through the inves-
tigation, skipped over witnesses whom 
they now deem critical to the inquiry, 
they try now to blame the Senate and 
put the burden of proof on our shoul-
ders. Well, as I said earlier, there is no 
question whether witnesses will be pre-
sented. Some of them will be presented 
who testified in the House of Rep-
resentatives—the 17 witnesses who tes-
tified over 100 hours. 
I think the Senate, based on the vote 
of 53 Senators, has wisely deferred 
whether additional witnesses will be 
subpoenaed until after we have had a 
chance to hear from the parties to the 
impeachment and an opportunity by 
Senators to actually ask clarification 
questions. 
Leader MCCONNELL
has been con-
sistent in saying that we wouldn’t be 
naming witnesses before the start of 
the trial, in line with the precedent set 
by the Clinton impeachment trial. 
Ironically, the Democratic leader was 
in a position during the Clinton im-
peachment trial that no additional wit-
nesses should be offered and now finds 
himself, ironically enough, in the oppo-
site posture based on nothing more 
than the difference in the identity of 
the President being impeached. 
To reiterate, we will have a chance to 
hear the arguments from both sides, 
along with any documents they choose 
to present. We will move to the Sen-
ators’ questions, and then we will de-
cide whether more evidence is required. 
I personally am disinclined to have the 
jury conduct the trial by demanding 
additional evidence. I think that is the 
role of the impeachment managers and 
of the President’s lawyers. I know fair- 
minded people can differ, and if 51 Sen-
ators want additional witnesses under 
this resolution, they will have an op-
portunity to have them subpoenaed. 
This is going to be a fair process, un-
like the House process, which has 
been—well, I was going to say ‘‘a three- 
ring circus,’’ but that is not fair to the 
circus. We are going to have a dig-
nified, sober, and deliberate process 
here, befitting the gravity of what we 
have been asked to decide. No one, nei-
ther the prosecution nor the defense, 
will be precluded from participating. 
As a matter of fact, they will drive the 
process. That is the way trials are con-
ducted in every courthouse in America, 
and that is the process we should adopt 
here. 
In stark contrast to the partisan 
chaos that consumed the impeachment 
inquiry in the House, we are going to 
restore order, civility, and fairness. 
Over the last 4 weeks, there has been a 
whole lot of talk but not much action 
from our colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle in the House. They have 
taken what should be a serious and sol-
emn responsibility in Congress and 
turned it into a partisan playground 
less than a year before the next elec-
tion, when tens of millions of Ameri-
cans will be voting on their choice for 
President of the United States. 
By needlessly withholding the Arti-
cles of Impeachment for 4 weeks, the 
Speaker has all but ensured that the 
Senate’s impeachment trial will over-
lap with the Iowa caucuses. That is 
where our Democratic friends will 
choose their Presidential primary win-
ner, starting with the Iowa caucuses. 
This trial could even stretch into the 
New Hampshire primary or the Nevada 
caucuses. I find it curious that the 
Speaker’s decision will force four Sen-
ators who are actually running for 
President in those primary contests to 
leave the campaign trail in these bat-
tleground States and come back to 
Washington, DC, and be glued to their 
seats, sitting as jurors during this 
trial, when I am sure they would rather 
be out on the hustings. Rather than

shaking hands with voters, they will be 
sitting here like the rest of us. That 
will be a big blow to their election. 
Based on what we have seen in the 
press, these four Senators aren’t what I 
would call ‘‘happy campers,’’ and I 
don’t blame them. 
You had better believe, though, that 
their competitors are celebrating. They 
are going to have the Iowa caucuses, 
perhaps, and maybe New Hampshire 
and Nevada all to themselves while 
these four Senators who are running 
for President in the Democratic pri-
mary will have to be here like the rest 
of us. 
So, in holding the articles for 4 
weeks, the Speaker just cleared out 
some of the top contenders in the Pres-
idential primaries—the early ones—and 
it is pretty clear that the candidate 
who stands the most to gain from their 
absence 
is 
former 
Vice 
President 
Biden. 
The politics of this impeachment cir-
cus show that it was never a serious 
one. A constitutional issue? Wrong. It 
was a political exercise from the start, 
meant to hurt this President and help 
the Speaker’s party elect a Democrat 
in his stead in November—or at least 
NANCY PELOSI’s friends in the Demo-
cratic Party. 
Over these last 4 weeks, we have been 
standing by, waiting to do our duty, 
wasting 
valuable 
time, 
while 
the 
Democrats in the House try to come to 
terms with their embarrassing and in-
adequate investigation, and watching 
them as they try to figure out how 
they could possibly get themselves out 
of this embarrassing box canyon they 
have walked into. 
I know we are all eager for the proc-
ess to finally shift from the House’s 
hands to the Senate, and I am hopeful 
that later this evening we will finally 
be free from Speaker PELOSI’s manipu-
lative games when it comes to im-
peachment. 
f 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA 
TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, finally 
there is some good news here in Wash-
ington that we will actually get some 
important things done, and, particu-
larly, I am talking about the USMCA, 
or the United States-Mexico-Canada 
Trade Agreement. I am hopeful that we 
can get that voted out of the Senate by 
tomorrow and get it onto the Presi-
dent’s desk. This is a top priority for 
my constituents, who are farmers, 
ranchers, and manufacturers, as well as 
consumers, whose daily lives are im-
pacted by trade with our neighbors to 
the north and south. We will soon be 
able to mark it as yet another win for 
Texas under this administration. 
For more than a quarter of a century, 
NAFTA, or the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, the predecessor to 
the USMCA, has been the guiding force 
in our trading relationships with Mex-
ico and Canada. By virtually any meas-
ure, it has been a great success. The 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates 
that 13 million American jobs have 
been created and are dependent on 
trade with Mexico and Canada. That is 
a big deal. 
A lot has changed over the last 25 
years. In fact, then, the internet was in 
its infancy, smartphones didn’t exist, 
and the only shopping you did was at a 
brick-and-mortar store. The way busi-
ness is conducted today has evolved 
significantly. It is time we bring our 
trade agreements up to date. 
That is where the USMCA comes in. 
It preserves the basic hallmark provi-
sions of NAFTA, like duty-free access 
to Mexican and Canadian markets, and 
it adds measures to modernize the 
agreement. Additionally, the USMCA 
includes strong protections for intel-
lectual property, which is critical to 
protecting the incredible innovation 
that Americans create right here at 
home. It also cuts the redtape that has 
been preventing countless small busi-
nesses from tapping into foreign mar-
kets. 
It also accounts for e-commerce and 
digital products at a time when govern-
ments around the world are proposing 
all kinds of new taxes on e-commerce. 
It is actually the first free-trade agree-
ment with a digital trade chapter. That 
is why a lot of folks call the USMCA 
‘‘NAFTA–2.0.’’ It is better, it is strong-
er, and it is up to date. 
I have no doubt that this agreement 
will be a boon to both our national and 
Texas economies, but I do have some 
concerns about the path it has taken to 
ratification. This product was essen-
tially negotiated with the House and 
given to the Senate as a fait accompli, 
and I worry that that can set a dan-
gerous 
precedent 
for 
future 
trade 
agreements. I hope that is not some-
thing we will allow to become a habit, 
but it doesn’t diminish the fact that 
this trade agreement will bring serious 
benefits to my constituents and my 
State and continue to strengthen our 
national economy. 
I appreciate the President’s commit-
ment to strengthening our trading 
agreements with our neighbors and bol-
stering a stronger North America. The 
USMCA is a big win for all three coun-
tries involved, and it is a big win for 
the State of Texas. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
f 
IRAN 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, last 
week we were very close to an act of 
war between the United States and 
Iran. I must tell you, we have been 
talking about this potential threat for 
a long time. I am a member of the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee. We 
have held numerous meetings in our 
discussion about the fact that there is 
no authorization for the use of military 
force by the United States against Iran 
that has been approved by Congress. I 
remember, during hearings, listening 
to administrative witnesses who said: 
Well, there is no intent to use force 
against Iran. 
Well, Congress did not act. Even 
though, I must tell you, several of our 
colleagues, including this Senator, had 
urged us to take up an authorization 
for the use of military force in regards 
to the problems in the Middle East, 
there was no action taken. I want to 
applaud Senator KAINE, who has been 
working on this for several years, and 
our former colleague Senator Flake, 
who did everything they could to bring 
a bipartisan discussion and action in 
regards to exercising congressional re-
sponsibility on the use of force by our 
military. 
Well, we now know that this is a real 
threat, that we may be going to war 
without Congress’s involvement, which 
is contrary not only to our Constitu-
tion but to the laws passed by the U.S. 
Congress. So I want to thank Senator 
KAINE and Senator LEE for filing S.J. 
Res. 68, a bipartisan resolution. I hope 
it will receive the expedited process 
that is envisioned in the War Powers 
Resolution, and I hope that we will 
have a chance to act on this in the next 
few days. It is our responsibility— 
Congress’s responsibility—to commit 
our troops to combat, and it rests 
squarely with the legislative branch of 
government. 
Let me first cite the Constitution of 
the United States. You hear a lot of 
discussion about the Constitution here 
on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Article 
I, section 8, of the Constitution says 
that Congress has the power to declare 
war. 
Now, that was challenged in the 
1970s, after Congress had passed the 
Gulf of Tonkin resolution in regards to 
our presence in Vietnam. 
It was passed in an innocent way to 
protect American troops and ships that 
were in that region, but as we know, 
that resolution was used as justifica-
tion by President Johnson and others 
to expand our involvement in Vietnam 
and, ultimately, led to a very active 
and costly war for the United States— 
and lengthy war, I might add. 
In 1973, Congress passed the War Pow-
ers Act. It wasn’t easy. President 
Nixon vetoed it. We overrode the veto 
in a bipartisan vote in the U.S. Con-
gress. We did that because of the abuse 
of power during the Vietnam war. 
Let me read what the War Powers 
Act provides because it is very telling 
in regard to what we saw last week in 
regard to Iran, a little over a week ago 
now. It requires consultation with Con-
gress by the President ‘‘in every pos-
sible 
instance 
before 
committing 
troops to war.’’ No. 1, it requires the 
President to consult with us before he 
commits any of our troops to an en-
gagement. No. 2, the President is re-
quired to report within 48 hours ‘‘into 
hostilities or into situations where im-
minent involvement in hostilities is 
clearly 
indicated 
by 
the 
cir-
cumstances.’’ So it provides for the im-
minent involvement or threat to the 
United States.

No. 3, the President is ‘‘required to 
end foreign military action after 60 
days unless Congress provides a dec-
laration of war or an authorization for 
the operation to continue.’’ 
We now know that to be an AUMF, 
an authorization for the use of military 
force. 
Let’s fast forward from the passage 
of that bill in 1973 to rein in the abuse 
of power by the Executive during the 
Vietnam war. Let’s fast forward to 
what happened in early January, on 
January 2, when President Trump or-
dered the action against Soleimani in 
Baghdad and took out his life. 
Let me start off by saying, none of us 
has any sorrow over the loss of General 
Soleimani. He was a bad guy. He was 
responsible for the deaths of hundreds 
of people. He was very much a person 
who should have been held accountable 
for his activities, but there is a reason 
for our constitutional protections of 
checks and balances as it relates to the 
use of military force by the United 
States. 
The Commander in Chief has certain 
powers. Congress has certain powers. 
The Framers of our Constitution inten-
tionally provided for there to be a ro-
bust discussion and debate between the 
legislature and the Executive on war 
and peace; that we should have that 
open discussion; and that, in many 
cases, diplomacy needs to be pursued 
much more aggressively before we use 
our military might; that our national 
security interest in keeping America 
safe rests with these checks and bal-
ances. Again, to bring it to current 
times in regard to the circumstances 
with Iran, every witness I have listened 
to, every expert I have talked to with 
regard to the Middle East, says it is in 
the U.S. national security interest to 
find a diplomatic way to handle our 
issues in regard to Iran; that a military 
option would be very costly, a long 
time, 
and, 
most 
likely, 
counter-
productive with the United States hav-
ing to keep its troops in that region for 
a very long time. 
Diplomacy is clearly the preferred 
path. These constitutional provisions 
provide us with an opportunity to be 
able to make sure we do what is in the 
best interest of American national se-
curity. 
Trump ordered this attack, and the 
Senate now needs to act, as we saw in 
the 1970s when Congress did act. Let 
me start with the War Powers Act and 
how President Trump had violated the 
War Powers Act in all three of the pro-
visions I mentioned earlier. 
First, was there an imminent in-
volvement or threat? We have all now 
heard the explanations given by this 
administration. It was short on detail. 
It was basically the general concerns. 
What is most disturbing, we now read 
press accounts that the President had 
been planning for months—or the gen-
erals had been planning and going over 
with the President for months whether 
they 
should 
take 
out 
General 
Soleimani. 
If they had been planning for months, 
why didn’t they consult with Congress, 
as required under the War Powers Act? 
Violation No. 1 to the War Powers Act: 
Congress was not consulted by Presi-
dent Trump. 
No. 2, there are two violations so far; 
the fact that there wasn’t an imminent 
threat and the fact that there was no 
consultation with Congress—two viola-
tions of the War Powers Act. Then, if 
he continues to use force beyond the 60 
days, he has to come to Congress and 
get authorization or he has to remove 
the troops. 
Does anyone here believe the Presi-
dent will not hesitate again to use 
force against Iran? Yet there are no in-
tentions to submit a resolution. 
We find the President has violated 
the War Powers Act in three ways: 
first, by having no evidence of immi-
nent threat; second, by not consulting 
with Congress before the attack; and 
third, by not submitting to us an au-
thorization for the use of military 
force. 
There are some who say the Presi-
dent already has that authority under 
the authorizations for the use of mili-
tary force that were passed by Con-
gress after the attack on our country 
on September 11, 2001. 
We are getting to 18 years beyond 
when that attack took place and those 
authorizations passed, but let me go 
through them. The one that is cited 
the most by the President is the 2002, 
which is to ‘‘defend the national secu-
rity of the United States against the 
continuing threat posed by Iraq.’’ 
First, let me say, I voted against 
that resolution, and I believe that was 
the correct vote, but I think almost ev-
erybody in this body would say that 
authorization is no longer relevant. 
Since that resolution was passed, the 
United States has worked with Iraq 
and has worked with the Government 
of Iraq. This is a country we try to do 
business 
with, 
so 
they 
no 
longer 
present the threat that was supposedly 
present 
when 
this 
resolution 
was 
passed. Even to get beyond that, what 
does Iran have to do with Iraq? I under-
stand they may start with the first let-
ter ‘‘I,’’ but there is no relationship 
here. Under any stretch of the imagina-
tion, there is no way you can use the 
2002 resolution. 
Let’s go to the 2001 resolution that 
was passed on the authorization for use 
of military force. That was imme-
diately after the attack on September 
11: ‘‘ . . . to use all necessary and ap-
propriate force against those nations, 
organizations, or persons he deter-
mines planned, authorized, committed, 
or aided the terrorist attacks that oc-
curred on September 11, 2001, or har-
bored such organizations or persons.’’ 
There is absolutely zero connection 
between that language and General 
Soleimani or Iran as it relates to 9/11, 
and I think no one could make that 
connection. 
I understand that 2001 has been mis-
used by many administrations. There 
is no question, I would concur in that 
conclusion, but in all of those cases, 
they tried to connect dots. There is no 
connection of dots here whatsoever. 
As we saw in the late 1960s and 1970s 
in Vietnam, when we had the Gulf of 
Tonkin resolution that was passed to 
defend our assets in the Vietnam 
area—in the Gulf of Tonkin—how it 
was used by administrations to commit 
us to a long, engaged military oper-
ations. Here, one cannot argue that 
there is even a semblance of authoriza-
tion that has been passed by Congress 
as it relates to Iran. 
We also know the President is vio-
lating the War Powers Act, and he is 
likely to use force again in violation of 
our Constitution and the War Powers 
Act. 
It was my generation that paid a 
very heavy price because of the Viet-
nam war. I lost a lot of my high school 
classmates in the Vietnam war. Let us 
not exceed our responsibility under the 
Constitution or allow the President to 
exceed his. We need to act. The Senate 
needs to act. We don’t need another 
endless war. 
The resolution before us allows us to 
do what is responsible. I am going to 
quote from the resolution that Senator 
KAINE has filed, S.J. Res. 68: ‘‘ . . . the 
President to terminate the use of 
United States Armed Forces for hos-
tilities against . . . Iran or any part of 
its government or military, unless ex-
plicitly authorized by a declaration of 
war or specific authorization for use of 
military force against Iran.’’ 
By the way, the resolution also pro-
vides that we always have the right to 
defend ourselves from an imminent 
threat, provided that it is an imminent 
threat, and that we comply with the 
War Powers Act—I am adding this— 
that was passed by Congress. 
The President has a long track 
record of exceeding his constitutional 
authority on matters of foreign policy. 
We cannot afford to become accus-
tomed or complacent in the face of 
those excesses. It is our responsibility 
to carry out our constitutional respon-
sibility. 
I urge my colleagues to strongly sup-
port S.J. Res. 68 when we have a chance 
to vote on that, I hope, within the next 
few days. 
With that, I suggest the absence of a 
quorum.

PRESIDING

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

importance of trade, what it means to 
our markets, what it means to exports, 
and what it means to States like mine, 
that being Colorado. The USMCA is in-
credibly important as we turn to that 
debate this week. 
NAFTA and what it meant to Colo-
rado was incredibly significant and the 
number of jobs that it created as was 
the United States-Korea Free Trade 
Agreement and the number of jobs that 
its agreement created. We have seen 
the benefits of trade in a State like 
Colorado for a number of years, and we 
see the opportunity for additional 
trade agreements in the future. This 
past year and this past Congress, we 
adopted the Asia Reassurance Initia-
tive Act, which created U.S.-Asia trade 
partnership opportunities in energy— 
renewable energy and traditional en-
ergy. 
This week, Congress turns its entire 
focus to the USMCA and its moderniza-
tion of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. We have to continue look-
ing for new trade opportunities—ways 
to open up trade around the globe. It is 
vitally important to agriculture, to our 
electronic sector, and to our service 
sector. People of all walks of life and 
business in Colorado understand the 
importance of trade and what it means 
to our industry. If we don’t seek out 
new trade opportunities—it is not like 
we operate just by ourselves—we know 
what will happen. We will see China, 
India, and other countries displace us. 
We will see them build new supply 
chains and go around the United 
States, and we will end up losing those 
market opportunities, those invest-
ment opportunities, and the jobs that 
go along with them. 
If we don’t open up new trade oppor-
tunities, farmers and ranchers in my 
home State will suffer. We have al-
ready seen incredibly low commodity 
prices hurt our agricultural commu-
nities. One way to overcome that is to 
open up new markets and create value- 
added opportunities in those new mar-
kets. That is how we can add one more 
potential tool to our ag economy to 
help make it survive and thrive. We 
have new product flows all the time 
out of our State, and this USMCA 
agreement is one more way we can cre-
ate that new flow of opportunity. The 
North American Free Trade Agreement 
supports, really, 14 million jobs around 
the United States. Those are thousands 
of jobs in all 50 States. 
Despite its benefits, however, we can 
always do a better job of making sure 
it meets the needs of our modern-day 
economy by modernizing NAFTA. Mod-
ernizing NAFTA to increase market ac-
cess, to expand energy exports, to 
maximize domestic energy production, 
including having provisions on intel-
lectual property and e-commerce, will 
make this agreement even more bene-
ficial to the United States. If you think 
back to 1994 and the timeframe of pre- 
iPhones and pre-iPads and of so much 
of the technology that we have today, 
this agreement was in place before 
that. That is why modernizing this 
agreement makes sense. 
As I mentioned, the United States- 
Mexico-Canada Agreement is incred-
ibly important to the State of Colo-
rado. Out of 750,000 trade-related jobs, 
there are nearly 220,000 jobs in Colo-
rado—a great pro-trade State—that are 
directly related to the USMCA. Canada 
and Mexico are our State’s largest 
trading 
partners. 
Obviously, 
that 
makes sense, for right in the middle is 
our State. Amongst Colorado, Canada, 
and Mexico, we trade more than $2.7 
billion worth of goods and support the 
220,000 jobs that I just talked about. 
Colorado’s farmers produce nearly 
half of all of the potatoes that Mexico 
imports from the United States. We 
also supply about 97 percent of all U.S. 
beverages to Mexico. Mexico has cer-
tainly been able to tap the Rockies 
when it comes to our beverage produc-
tion in Colorado. Our biggest export— 
beef—accounts for more than $880 mil-
lion worth of goods that are shipped to 
Mexico and Canada. 
In 2018, Colorado exported to Mexico 
more than $45 million worth of milk, 
cream, cheese, and related dairy prod-
ucts. Meanwhile, we have exported 
about $2.2 million worth of those prod-
ucts to Canada. The USMCA will re-
form Canada’s protectionist dairy poli-
cies and help American dairy farmers 
access the dairy markets in Canada so 
that we can increase our exports to 
Canada in cream, milk, cheese, and 
other dairy areas. We sent more than 
$31 million worth of cereals, like 
wheat, to Mexico in 2018 and more than 
$2 million worth to Canada. 
Even our sugar and candy manufac-
turers benefit from trade with Mexico 
and Canada. I just had a meeting with 
the Western Sugar Cooperative of Colo-
rado. We talked about the importance 
of trade and about getting this trade 
agreement right. Both countries have 
received more than $14 million a piece 
worth of Colorado’s sugar and confec-
tionery exports. 
Increased trade with these countries 
will also benefit the beverage industry 
in Colorado. As I mentioned, 97 percent 
of the beverages that Mexico imports 
are from Colorado, and we shipped 
more than $63 million worth of bev-
erages to Canada in 2018. Beyond com-
modities like wheat, dairy, and sugar, 
Colorado’s 
electronic 
manufacturers 
shipped to Canada more than $105 mil-
lion worth of its goods in 2018, and 
Mexico received about $60 million 
worth of our electronic goods. 
The 
United 
States-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement includes new digital provi-
sions to account for our changing land-
scape of new technologies, advanced 
manufacturing products, and it tackles 
the issue of cross-border dataflow, 
which is something that was just, basi-
cally, in its very infancy when NAFTA 
was enacted. 
We know that the USMCA is a better 
opportunity for us to gain even more 
jobs, more income, and more oppor-
tunity for the State of Colorado. We 
know that these trade agreements add 
to the household incomes across our 
State and that it benefits our economy. 
This agreement brings opportunity to 
all four corners of our State. 
New customs and trade rules will cut 
redtape and make it easier for Colo-
rado’s startups and entrepreneurs to 
sell their products into Canada and 
Mexico. U.S. agricultural and food ex-
ports are expected to rise more than $2 
billion every year if the USMCA is 
adopted. So many goods in Colorado 
that are in our top 10 exported items 
are ag related. This $2 billion-a-year 
increase will mean there will be signifi-
cant opportunities for Colorado’s agri-
culture. 
Obviously, I am very encouraged by 
the Senate Committee on Finance in 
its reporting the agreement out favor-
ably last week. I was honored to sup-
port the USMCA this morning by vot-
ing for the agreement—voting it out of 
the Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation and out of the Sen-
ate Committee on Foreign Relations, 
which are two of the committees on 
which I serve. I look forward to its ex-
peditious passage here in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
I live in rural Colorado. I am sur-
rounded by wheat farms, corn farms, 
hog producers, feed lots, and I know 
how important trade is to our State. 
This agreement to modernize and con-
tinue our agreement with Canada and 
Mexico is critical to the survival of ag-
riculture in Colorado and this country. 
I know, with new markets opening 
around the world, this agreement will 
continue to be the keystone of Colo-
rado’s trade. We stand to benefit tre-
mendously, enormously from this up-
date. Our farmers and ranchers are 
counting on us to get this done, and 
our manufacturers are counting on us 
to get this done. Our economy depends 
on our getting this done. 
I yield the floor.

IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, at 
this particular moment in our history, 
we are witnessing the convergence of 
three events. 
The Senate will likely be sworn in to-
morrow for the impeachment trial of 
President Trump. One of the Articles of 
Impeachment that will be coming over 
from the House relates to the Presi-
dent’s abuse of power—the charge that 
he has used the power and prestige of 
the Office of the Presidency to, among 
other things, withhold vital U.S. secu-
rity assistance to Ukraine in order to 
pressure it to announce an investiga-
tion into Burisma, Hunter Biden, and, 
possibly, Joe Biden in an attempt to 
get Ukraine to interfere in the upcom-
ing 2020 election on behalf of President 
Trump. 
Now, I am not here today to go into 
issues directly related to that trial. It 
is vitally important that we get rel-
evant witnesses, that we get relevant

January 15, 2020 
documents, and that we have a fair 
trial and get to the truth. 
The second event that we learned 
about just this week that relates to the 
impeachment trial was that Russian 
military 
hackers 
broke 
into 
the 
Burisma computers in Ukraine and 
that they used the same phishing tech-
niques that the GRU used—the Russian 
military intelligence—to break into 
the Democratic National Committee 
headquarters’ servers during the 2016 
Presidential elections. All of the evi-
dence points to another attempt by 
Vladimir Putin to use his military 
GRU hackers to interfere in an Amer-
ican election—this time in the 2020 
election. 
I don’t know what is going to happen 
during the election on November 3 of 
this year. Obviously, each of us has his 
hopes as to what the result will be, but 
that is not the purpose of my being 
here on the floor today. My focus is on 
what should unite all of us in this 
body—that should unite all 100 U.S. 
Senators—and that is that we should 
all agree that it is outrageous for any 
foreign power to interfere in an Amer-
ican election the way Russia interfered 
in our election in 2016 and that it would 
be equally outrageous for us, in our 
knowing that this is Russia’s intent in 
2020, to sit here and not do anything to 
protect the integrity of our democracy. 
Look, we all know what happened in 
2016. Just to refresh our memories, it 
was the unanimous conclusion of all 
U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia 
interfered in the 2016 Presidential elec-
tion. That was the unanimous conclu-
sion of the leaders of intelligence agen-
cies appointed by President Trump. It 
was also the bipartisan verdict of the 
Senate Intelligence Committee, which 
painstakingly 
documented 
the 
fact 
that elections systems in all 50 of our 
States were targeted to one degree or 
another by Russian hackers in the 2016 
elections. In fact, we know this from 
the outcome of the Mueller investiga-
tion that led to the indictment of 12 
Russian military intelligence individ-
uals, members of the GRU. They were 
indicted because of their interference 
in the 2016 elections. 
We also know that Vladimir Putin 
and the Russians intend to interfere in 
our elections again in 2020. We know 
that because of the revelations this 
week about the actions the GRU is tak-
ing with respect to Burisma—same fin-
gerprint, same techniques—but we also 
know that from our own U.S. intel-
ligence agencies, which, in November 
of last year, all got together to issue a 
warning that Russia was going to 
interfere again in 2020. 
I am holding in my hand a joint 
statement from the leaders of U.S. in-
telligence and law enforcement agen-
cies, and what they say is that our ad-
versaries—and they point to Russia— 
will seek to interfere in the voting 
process or influence voter perceptions. 
This document is not about the past. 
This document is not about 2016. This 
document is about the here and now 
and the November 2020 elections. And 
this is, again, from the heads of our in-
telligence agencies and law enforce-
ment agencies who have been ap-
pointed by President Trump. 
Now we have overwhelming evidence 
that Russia interfered in 2016, we have 
overwhelming evidence and predictions 
that Russia will interfere again in our 
elections in 2020, and so we clearly are 
facing an immediate danger to the in-
tegrity of our elections and our democ-
racy. It is like we have a Russian mis-
sile in the air right now headed toward 
our election integrity systems and our 
electoral process. That is what the in-
telligence agencies are telling us right 
now. 
We learned the hard way in 2016, and 
now it is happening all over again. So 
the question for this body is, When you 
know something is happening, what are 
you going to do about it? There are two 
things we should be doing about it. We 
should be working to strengthen our 
elections systems here at home, to 
harden them, to make it more difficult 
for Russian military intelligence to 
hack into them. We should be working 
with social media companies to pre-
vent the Russian Government and their 
agents from spending money on adver-
tising on social media or using other 
techniques on social media to influence 
American voters. We need to be doing 
all that. We have appropriated some 
funds to do that. 
We should be doing more than we 
have, but the best defense is a good of-
fense. We can and should spend money 
to strengthen and protect our elections 
systems, but that is not enough be-
cause it is kind of like the arms race. 
We will work to try to better strength-
en and protect those systems, and the 
hackers who are trying to get in will 
develop new techniques to try to get 
around them. It is an endless cycle. 
That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t harden 
them—we 
should—but 
that 
is 
not 
enough to protect the integrity of our 
elections. 
We have to apply the principle that 
the best defense is a good offense and 
make it clear up front to Vladimir 
Putin and Russia that the costs of 
interfering in another American elec-
tion far outweigh the benefits. That is 
what we need to do because right now 
it is absolutely cost-free to Vladimir 
Putin to mess around in our elections. 
In fact, it is a big benefit to Vladimir 
Putin and the Russians. That is why 
they do it. 
What do they accomplish? Well, first 
of all, they succeed in dividing Ameri-
cans against one another. They succeed 
in undermining public confidence in 
the outcome of our elections, and that 
is part of their overall strategy—to try 
to undermine democracies, whether 
here in the United States or in Europe 
or other places around the world. 
Maybe they also succeed, ultimately, 
in weighing in and helping their pre-
ferred candidate in an election. 
But the point is, right now, if you are 
Putin, there is zero cost to getting 
caught interfering in our elections and 
lots of perceived benefits by Vladimir 
Putin. So that is why, more than 2 
years ago, Senator MARCO RUBIO and I 
introduced the bipartisan DETER Act, 
and there are many other Senators, 
both Democrats and Republicans, who 
were on that bill. The DETER Act is 
very straightforward. It would enact 
into law a very straightforward propo-
sition. It says to Russia—and also to 
other countries, but the main attack 
seems to be coming from Russia—it 
says to Putin and Russia: If we catch 
you again interfering in our elections, 
there will be immediate and very harsh 
penalties for you to pay. 
This will happen virtually automati-
cally. So Vladimir Putin will know up 
front that if our intelligence agencies 
catch them again, which they are like-
ly to do, then he will finally pay a 
price for interfering in our elections 
and trying to undermine our demo-
cratic processes. These are not sanc-
tions against a couple of Putin’s pals. 
These are not sanctions against a cou-
ple oligarchs. These would be sanctions 
against major sectors of the Russian 
economy—state-owned 
banks, 
state- 
owned parts of their energy industry— 
so their economy will take a big hit if 
we catch them attacking our democ-
racy once again. 
That is absolutely appropriate be-
cause what Putin is doing is under-
mining faith and confidence in our 
democratic process, and we need to 
make it clear up front that there is a 
big price to pay—not because we want 
those sanctions to go into effect but 
because we don’t. That, of course, is 
the entire idea behind deterrence. You 
raise the cost, you raise the price on 
Putin and Russia to the point it is no 
longer worth it to interfere in our elec-
tions. 
That is why Senator RUBIO and I in-
troduced this legislation 2 years ago. 
We hoped it would be in place before 
the 2018 midterm elections, but that 
date has passed, and still here we are in 
the U.S. Senate having failed to adopt 
this bipartisan legislation. 
I was right here on the floor of the 
Senate just a few months ago when we 
were debating the NDAA, the National 
Defense Authorization Act. I asked for 
a vote to include the essential provi-
sion of the DETER Act in the Defense 
authorization bill because it makes a 
lot of sense that in a bill that is sup-
posed to defend the United States, we 
include a provision to defend the integ-
rity of our democracy and electoral 
system against Russian attack or any 
other attack. Apparently every single 
Senator in this body agreed because it 
passed unanimously. 
The Senate went on record unani-
mously saying we should include provi-
sions like the DETER Act in the NDAA 
to deter Russian interference in our 
elections. Then we were in negotiations 
on the NDAA, and it turned out that in 
the back rooms, behind closed doors, 
the Trump administration got Repub-
lican Senators to insist on throwing 
that provision out of the NDAA bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S217 
January 15, 2020 
This was one of the matters that was 
discussed until the final stages of nego-
tiations on the NDAA, and apparently 
the majority leader and other Repub-
lican Senators, at the behest of the 
Trump administration, said no—said 
no to a provision that had been agreed 
to unanimously by this body to help 
protect our elections by deterring Rus-
sian interference. The question is, 
Why? Why, when our own intelligence 
agencies are telling us that Russia is 
planning to do in 2020 what they did in 
2016, would Republican Senate leaders 
block a provision that lets Putin know 
‘‘You will be punished if you do that 
again. You will be punished if you at-
tack our democracy’’? And I haven’t 
gotten a straight answer to that ques-
tion. Why not? Why not include that 
provision? Clearly, there are Senators 
who don’t want to build up our defenses 
and deterrence again Russian inter-
ference in our elections. 
When we failed to get that into the 
NDAA, I came to the Senate floor, and 
I asked for unanimous consent to bring 
up the bipartisan DETER Act. Because 
every one of the Senators in this body 
had voted or said through lack of ob-
jection that they wanted the DETER 
Act in the NDAA, I brought up the bill 
for unanimous consent passing here. 
Well, the chairman of the Senate 
Banking Committee came to the floor 
and objected, and we had a back-and- 
forth conversation about the DETER 
Act. 
Yesterday, I was planning to come to 
this floor and again ask for unanimous 
consent to take up the DETER Act, but 
we heard from the chairman of the 
Banking Committee that he wanted to 
find a way to get this done. So I am 
going to take the chairman of the 
Banking Committee up on that offer, 
and I hope we can get it done. But I 
want to be really clear. If we are not 
able to work this out in a smart, 
straightforward way, which is what the 
bill does right now—as I said, it has 
strong bipartisan support right now— 
then I will be back on the Senate floor 
regularly to ask for unanimous con-
sent, and any other Senator who wants 
to come down here and object can do 
that. That is their right. But I am 
going to keep pushing this issue be-
cause the clock is ticking. Every day 
that passes while we know from our 
own intelligence agencies that Russia 
plans to interfere in the 2020 election 
and we don’t do anything about it—we 
are grossly negligent. 
I want Senators who are not going to 
support that to come here in the light 
of day and let the American public 
know they are blocking that effort. I 
hope we don’t have to do that. I hope 
we can work this out. I hope we can 
pass the bipartisan legislation that has 
been sitting in the Senate for over 2 
years now as we get warning after 
warning after warning that Vladimir 
Putin, the GRU, and the Russians in-
tend to interfere in our democratic 
process again and attack the integrity 
of our electoral system. 
Let’s get this done. Let’s protect our 
democracy. Let’s make it clear in ad-
vance to Putin that the price he will 
pay for trying to interfere in our de-
mocracy will be much higher than any 
benefit he expects to gain. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as in 
morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
IRAN 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to discuss U.S. policy regarding 
Iran. We know that in 2009 the new 
Obama administration came into office 
at a time when the Iranian regime was 
racing to develop a nuclear weapon. 
The prospect of the Iranian regime 
with a nuclear weapon would present a 
substantial threat to America and to 
our allies. At the same time, Iran was 
engaged in a host of other malign ac-
tivities, but the most urgent and sig-
nificant threat was nuclear. 
In 2013, Iran was 2 to 3 months from 
being able to build a nuclear weapon. 
The Obama administration decided to 
use hard-nosed diplomacy resulting in 
the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
Action, known by the acronym JCPOA. 
This agreement was entered into with 
a number of countries, three of them 
our 
allies—the 
United 
Kingdom, 
France and Germany. We also had two 
partner 
countries—countries 
with 
which we have a lot of tensions and 
conflict. We were partners with China 
and 
Russia. 
So 
this 
agreement 
stretched from one end of the world to 
the other. 
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Ac-
tion prevented Iran from acquiring a 
nuclear weapon by, among other steps, 
authorizing some of the most intrusive 
inspections that have ever been put 
into 
place. 
This 
agreement, 
the 
JCPOA, did not cover several other 
nonnuclear malign activities that the 
Iranian regime was and is engaged in. 
The JCPOA isolated and largely solved 
the most dire threat, that of a nuclear- 
armed Iran in the near future. 
This agreement, from its signing in 
2015 through 2018, worked. Until re-
cently, Iran was complying with the 
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. 
That is the considered judgment of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency, 
known as IAEA. The considered judg-
ment of the U.S. intelligence commu-
nity was that Iran was complying with 
the agreement. It was also the judg-
ment made by the U.S. Department of 
State and the U.S. Department of De-
fense in both the Obama administra-
tion and the Trump administration. 
The determination that Iran was 
complying with the agreement is also 
the assessment of our allies and part-
ners with whom the Obama administra-
tion worked to bring into a coalition. 
Here is a sampling of assessments 
prior to recent events. In September 
2017, 
then-Secretary 
of 
State 
Rex 
Tillerson stated that Iran is in ‘‘tech-
nical compliance’’ with the JCPOA. 
Second, in October 2017, then-Defense 
Secretary Jim Mattis stated that Iran 
was ‘‘fundamentally’’ in compliance 
with the JCPOA. ‘‘Overall our intel-
ligence community believes that they 
have been compliant and the IAEA also 
says so,’’ said General Mattis, then 
Secretary of Defense. 
In March 2018, IAEA Director Amano 
stated: ‘‘Iran is implementing its nu-
clear-related commitments. . . . If the 
JCPOA were to fail, it would be a great 
loss for nuclear verification and for 
multilateralism.’’ 
Finally, No. 4, in January 2019, 
former Director of National Intel-
ligence Dan Coats, a former Republican 
Senator from the State of Indiana, 
said: ‘‘We continue to assess that Iran 
is not currently undertaking the key 
nuclear weapons development activi-
ties we judge necessary to produce a 
nuclear device.’’ 
Three of the four officials—Secretary 
of State Tillerson, Secretary of De-
fense Mattis, and Director of National 
Intelligence Coats—all three were ap-
pointed by President Trump. 
President Trump came into office de-
termined to pull out of this agreement, 
despite the fact that it was working. 
He surrounded himself with advisers 
who supported a policy of regime 
change. Of course, the words ‘‘regime 
change’’ are words that they will not 
say out loud—the President or his ad-
ministration—but that is the policy. 
The American people, after nearly two 
decades of conflict, know that regime- 
change policy is a march to war. 
This administration calls their re-
gime change policy a ‘‘maximum pres-
sure campaign.’’ Its stated goal was to 
force Iran to negotiate a new agree-
ment that would include a host of 
other nonnuclear issues. Despite the 
stated goal, an examination of the 
methods used to achieve it make it ob-
vious that the administration was en-
gaged in a policy that would most like-
ly lead to war instead of a new agree-
ment. The administration pulled out of 
the nuclear agreement, which was 
working, and while it was in effect, it 
took the threat of a nuclear-armed 
Iran off the table. 
The administration reimposed sanc-
tions which were lifted as part of the 
nuclear agreement. They engaged in a 
host of other activities that resulted in 
increased risks and moved us further 
away from a diplomatic resolution. 
The administration’s regime change 
policy was supposed to deter the Ira-
nian regime from threatening our Na-
tion and its allies. This policy has not 
done that. This policy was supposed to 
bring Iran to the bargaining table. It 
has not. It was supposed to cajole Iran 
to behave like a ‘‘normal nation.’’ Once 
again, it has not. 
Tensions have increased. Threats to 
our servicemembers, our citizens, and 
allies have increased, not decreased. 
The region—the Middle East—is less

stable. Iran is closer—closer—to ob-
taining a nuclear weapon. 
The terrible results of this policy 
were predictable. The administration, 
including 
Secretary 
Pompeo 
and 
former National Security Advisor John 
Bolton, never had any intention of 
forging a new diplomatic agreement 
with Iran. All of this is how our Nation 
has found itself on the brink of war 
with Iran, facing the potential of an-
other bloody conflict in the Middle 
East. 
Americans across our country are 
well aware of the events leading up to 
the killing of Iranian General Qasem 
Soleimani, the leader of Iran’s Quds 
Force on January 2. Following the kill-
ing of an American contractor at a 
U.S. military compound in Kirkuk, 
Iraq, on December 27, the U.S. military 
retaliated with a strike against the 
Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah ter-
rorist group, killing at least 25 mem-
bers of the militia and wounding oth-
ers. 
In response, the Iranian Government 
orchestrated 
protests 
in 
Baghdad, 
which led hundreds of pro-Iranian pro-
testers to storm the U.S. Embassy in 
Baghdad on New Year’s Eve. The strike 
against the Quds Force Commander 
Qasem Soleimani followed. 
Soleimani was a military figure who 
inflicted terror and killed thousands in 
Israel, Iraq, and Syria as well. You can 
add other places to that. He killed 
thousands. He worked to prop up 
Bashar al-Assad in Syria. He aided Shi-
ite forces that killed hundreds of 
Americans in Iraq. We have been told 
that he was behind the attacks on the 
U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on New 
Year’s Eve. Qasem Soleimani was di-
rectly responsible for the killing of 
hundreds of American soldiers and ci-
vilians and wounding many more. He 
was a despicable person who was the 
leader of an entity designated as a ter-
rorist organization. 
Across the international stage, there 
are many committed enemies of Amer-
ica who plot every day to do our Na-
tion and our allies harm—every single 
day. Those entrusted with the national 
security of our Nation have to assess 
whether taking direct action against 
one of those individual enemies in-
creases or decreases risks over time 
and whether taking actions against 
those individuals is consistent with our 
values and our commitment to the rule 
of law. 
This is a high standard, and it should 
be. We are the United States of Amer-
ica, and we believe that conflicts have 
rules and limits. We strive for a higher 
standard that both honors our values 
and protects our security. Because we 
have high standards and because we ex-
pect our leaders to act prudently and 
with deliberation, the Constitution re-
quires substantial consultation with 
Congress regarding matters of war ex-
cept in limited, urgent circumstances. 
Acting 
with 
disregard 
for 
these 
standards, President Trump took this 
unilateral action. The President may 
have endangered the lives of U.S. serv-
icemembers in the Middle East. He 
may have also prompted near-lethal re-
taliation from Iran. 
Iran’s 
retaliatory 
strikes 
against 
U.S. bases at Al-Asad and Erbil on Jan-
uary 7 thankfully did not claim any 
American lives. However, conflicting 
reports 
continue 
to 
emerge 
about 
whether Iran intentionally avoided hit-
ting U.S. personnel, and that raises 
questions about whether Iran sought to 
escalate or de-escalate its conflict with 
the United States. 
Video evidence has emerged in recent 
days showing that the Iranians actu-
ally decimated housing units for sol-
diers on the base. Without having re-
ceived a classified briefing from the ad-
ministration about this incident—as 
opposed to the briefing we had on the 
killing of Soleimani, which I will get 
to later—without having that classified 
briefing, we can rely upon press reports 
for some information. Press reports in-
dicate that the Iranians were aiming to 
take American lives. 
The 
fallout 
from 
the 
Soleimani 
strike didn’t end there. On January 8, 
the Iranian Government covered up the 
fact that it mistakenly shot down a ci-
vilian aircraft killing 176 people on-
board. The Iranian people have since 
taken to the streets in protest of the 
coverup. I strongly condemn the Ira-
nian Government’s crackdown on pro-
testers and support the Iranian peo-
ple’s right to rise up and demand 
human rights and democratic govern-
ance in their country. 
But let’s not lose focus on a very im-
portant matter: President Trump or-
dered a targeted killing of a high-rank-
ing military official of a country with 
which we are not in a declared or au-
thorized conflict. This is a serious step 
which required both a rigorous exam-
ination as well as an explanation from 
the administration. Thus far, the ex-
planations we have received from this 
administration have been woefully in-
adequate and inconsistent—and I think 
that is an understatement. 
We have been told that this strike 
was in response to an ‘‘imminent 
threat’’ 
that 
four 
U.S. 
Embassies 
abroad were being targeted, which De-
fense Secretary Esper almost imme-
diately contradicted. 
The word ‘‘imminence’’ is important 
here. Imminence derives from the doc-
trine of self-defense, which under arti-
cle 51 of the United Nations Charter 
and the broader ‘‘laws of war,’’ immi-
nence justifies use of force in another 
state’s territory when an armed attack 
occurs—occurs—or when an armed at-
tack is imminent. Some national secu-
rity scholars define ‘‘imminence’’ as 
‘‘leaving no reasonable time for non-
forceful measures to obviate such a 
threat.’’ 
I will speak for myself only, but this 
is true of a number of Senators, I be-
lieve. I have yet to see clear evidence 
that there was ‘‘no reasonable time’’ to 
seek 
nonlethal, 
diplomatic 
options 
prior to killing Soleimani. The admin-
istration has failed to disclose suffi-
cient detail regarding the imminence 
of this threat. When asked on Friday, 
Secretary Pompeo said he did not know 
when this asserted imminent threat 
was supposed to take place. 
The American people have also heard 
from Secretary Pompeo and President 
Trump that the attack was a matter of 
retribution from events that occurred 
in the past. We have heard from Sec-
retary Pompeo that this attack was de-
signed to ‘‘restore deterrence,’’ but it 
is unclear that he coordinated with his 
national security colleagues across the 
interagency. 
We know from reporting from the 
New 
York 
Times 
that 
Secretary 
Pompeo was among the ‘‘most hawkish 
voices arguing for a response to Iranian 
aggression.’’ The article also goes on to 
say: ‘‘Top Pentagon officials were 
stunned’’ in reference to the strike. 
So the question of why this strike 
was launched and when it was launched 
remains unanswered. Both Democratic 
Senators 
and 
Republican 
Senators 
asked this question in a classified 
briefing last week and few received a 
satisfactory answer. We still lack an-
swers on the ‘‘imminent threat.’’ 
The President has spent the last 
week at rallies and other appearances 
triumphantly marking the killing and 
indicating that the Iranian threat is 
behind us. The strike authorized by 
President Trump may have been reck-
less, taken without appropriate plan-
ning for the consequences and after-
math, and done without serious con-
sultation with Congress and—and— 
within the administration. Contrary to 
the President’s boast, I am gravely 
concerned we will feel the adverse con-
sequences of this administration’s ac-
tions across the Iran policy landscape 
for years to come. 
If we think the attacks on the Al- 
Asad and Kirkuk bases last Tuesday 
were the end of Iranian retaliation for 
Soleimani’s death, we are likely mis-
taken, due to the continued threat of 
the 
Iranian 
regime’s 
proxy 
forces 
throughout the Middle East. Let’s ex-
amine the potential negative con-
sequences of the strike. I hope this is 
something that the administration en-
gaged in before the strike, but it is im-
portant to review this. 
On January 5, Iran announced that it 
is no longer bound by the restrictions 
of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Ac-
tion as it relates to uranium enrich-
ment. This agreement unequivocally 
extended Iran’s breakout time, which 
is the time it would take to obtain 
enough highly enriched uranium for a 
nuclear bomb. The agreement extended 
the breakout time to 12 months—1 
year. Again, before the agreement, 
Iran’s breakout time was 2 to 3 months. 
So the agreement extended that time, 
meaning making the world safer by ex-
tending that time from 2 to 3 months 
to 1 year. That is where we were with 
the implementation of the agreement. 
Without 
this 
agreement—the 
JCPOA—without that agreement in

place, Iran could reach the requisite 
uranium stockpile in as little as 6 
months, if not sooner. Iran is closer 
today to a nuclear weapon than it was 
a week or so ago, and certainly it is 
closer to a nuclear weapon since 2018, 
when 
the 
administration 
withdrew 
from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of 
Action. That is one consequence we 
have to consider. Iran is closer to a nu-
clear weapon. 
No. 2 is ISIS. If the President’s Octo-
ber 2019 withdrawal of U.S. forces from 
Syria and the concurrent abandonment 
of our Kurdish allies—if that did not 
create space for the resurgence of ISIS 
in the Middle East, the President’s re-
cent action will almost certainly allow 
for ISIS to regain a foothold in the re-
gion. Just 3 days after the Soleimani 
strike, the New York Times reported 
that, and here is the headline, ‘‘U.S.- 
Led Coalition Halts ISIS Fight as it 
Steels for Iranian Attacks’’—halts ISIS 
fight. NATO has already suspended its 
operations against ISIS. We have to 
consider, how does that outcome make 
us safer? 
Next, No. 3, we have to consider what 
is happening in Iraq. Iraq voted to 
expel U.S. troops from their country as 
a result of the strike. If we fully with-
draw from Iraq, where are we going to 
launch counter-ISIS operations in both 
Iraq and Syria from? How do we do 
that—from where? Where was the ef-
fort to work with the Iraqi Govern-
ment in quashing Kataib Hezbollah and 
countering Iranian influence in Iraq? 
Now that the Iraqi Government op-
poses U.S. troop presence in its coun-
try, what is the plan? How does the ad-
ministration plan to restart conversa-
tions with Iran to negotiate a ‘‘better’’ 
nuclear deal that will ensure Iran 
never has a nuclear bomb? How do they 
restart those negotiations? This strike 
looks more like another step forward 
in a policy of regime change rather 
than a coherent strategy designed to 
keep our Nation safe by using tough di-
plomacy and alliance-building to con-
front Iran. 
I have been one of the most deter-
mined advocates of being tough on 
Iran, especially regarding sanctions. 
Since I came to the Senate in 2007, I 
have been part of almost every sanc-
tions push in efforts to so-call tighten 
the screws on the Iranian regime and 
hold them fully accountable for their 
actions. All those steps that I have 
been a part of, and people of both par-
ties have been a part of, were part of a 
strategy to get the results we saw when 
the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Ac-
tion was signed. 
Now, 2 years and after one particu-
larly dangerous week, President Trump 
has 
badly 
undermined 
all 
that 
progress. The advocates of regime 
change in Iran are closer than ever to 
getting the United States into a shoot-
ing war with Iran. 
The events of the last few weeks re-
mind me of the lead-up to the U.S. in-
vasion of Iraq in 2003. Across both the 
House and the Senate, Congress held 
only seven hearings that dealt directly 
with the proposed 2002 authorization 
for the use of military force to author-
ize the Iraq war. AUMF is the acronym 
for that. Are seven hearings, over a pe-
riod of 3 weeks between the House and 
the Senate, sufficient discussion and 
debate prior to voting to go to war 
with Iraq? No. No, that is not sufficient 
time and not a sufficient number of 
hearings. 
At last count, 201 Pennsylvanians 
were killed in Iraq and over 1,200 were 
wounded. Have we learned from the 
mistakes of 2002 and 2003 that led to 
those deaths and all those Pennsylva-
nians being wounded and many thou-
sands beyond that killed and wounded 
in the Iraq war? Have we learned? Have 
we learned those lessons yet? We have 
a duty—an abiding obligation—not to 
repeat the mistakes of the past and to 
constrain the actions of a President 
who may endanger the lives of U.S. 
servicemembers and Americans abroad. 
Before we get too far down this path, 
Congress must reassert its constitu-
tional duty to debate and authorize 
war. Prior to authorizing a strike, we 
must assess—and I hope the adminis-
tration did this—whether such an ac-
tion would have an adverse impact on 
our national security. Before we march 
our sons and daughters off to fight an-
other war, we need to make sure we are 
doing everything possible to prevent 
the loss of American lives. 
I have been clear in opposing a direct 
confrontation with Iran without—with-
out a clear authorization from Con-
gress. The Trump administration acted 
without a congressionally approved au-
thorization for the use of military 
force last week. That is why I and 
many others have cosponsored Senator 
TIM KAINE’s bipartisan S.J. Res. 68 to 
prevent the President from going to 
war with Iran without congressional 
authorization. If you want to go to war 
with Iran, you ought to be compelled 
to vote for it, up or down—vote for or 
against as a Member of Congress. Spe-
cifically, this resolution, S.J. Res. 68, 
requires the President to ‘‘terminate 
the use of the United States Armed 
Forces for hostilities against the Is-
lamic Republican of Iran or any part of 
its government or military unless ex-
plicitly authorized by a declaration of 
war or a specific authorization for the 
use of military force’’ as enacted by 
Congress. Nothing in this resolution 
prevents the United States from ‘‘de-
fending itself against imminent at-
tack.’’ Those are the exact words. 
It is authorization or declaration be-
fore you go to war with Iran. I think a 
lot of Americans—most Americans—be-
lieve that is not just the right thing to 
do but that is our duty, no matter who 
is President. 
When the administration fails to 
brief Congress on threats we face and 
concurrently takes unilateral actions 
that could lead to all-out war, we must 
act quickly and decisively to prevent 
further escalation and demand a strat-
egy. We owe it to Pennsylvanians, and 
we owe it to all Americans, especially 
our men and women in uniform and 
their families, to engage in a substan-
tial, robust public debate on what en-
gaging in hostilities with Iran would 
mean for U.S. national security and 
how it could endanger American lives. 
The House vote of last Thursday was to 
reassert this congressional authority, 
and the Senate will vote this week. I 
urge a vote in support of S.J. Res. 68, 
which has several bipartisan cospon-
sors. 
This is a dark time, and I cannot 
overstate my level of concern. I know 
that concern is shared widely here in 
Congress but also across the country. 
As to Iran, we are headed down a path 
to war, one which could be more 
bloody, more complicated, and more 
protracted than any in my lifetime. We 
have been walking down this path since 
President Trump pulled out of the 
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. 
Every week since, we are a little closer 
to an armed conflict, and the events of 
these 
past 
weeks 
have 
likely 
turbocharged the dangerous path we 
are on. 
Going back to the time of the Viet-
nam war and thereafter, elected leaders 
of both political parties have lied to 
the American people. The American 
people were told we were making 
progress, when we weren’t. The Amer-
ican people were told that insurgencies 
were in their ‘‘last throes,’’ when the 
opposite was true. The American peo-
ple demand that politicians don’t make 
serious mistakes that lead to war. 
The good news is, we still have time. 
We have time to get it right. We have 
time to engage in hard-nosed diplo-
macy. We have time to reject a policy 
of regime change regarding Iran. There 
is time for this administration to out-
line and implement an effective Iran 
strategy that substantially reduces the 
likelihood of war in a nuclear-armed 
Iran, but time is running short. 
The administration may be com-
mitted to a policy of regime change, 
but the Senate can act. We can pass 
the bipartisan S.J. Res. 68 and other 
measures to make sure this adminis-
tration cannot take us recklessly to 
war with Iran without congressional 
authorization or a declaration of war. 
We owe it to the American people and 
to our servicemembers to do this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S220 
January 15, 2020 
today I want to draw attention to a 
truly great economic and foreign pol-
icy victory negotiated with one of our 
adversaries. In fact, it was signed just 
a few hours ago. 
When it comes to trade, we have de-
voted most of our energy to drafting 
and promoting the benefits of the 
USMCA, but we have also gotten a 
great start on two other trade deals— 
those that were negotiated with Japan 
that went into effect January 1 and 
also with China, signed today. We are 
looking forward to this Chamber pass-
ing the USMCA this week and sending 
it to the President’s desk. 
Back home in Tennessee, what I hear 
from our agriculture community is, we 
want trade—consistent, dependable, re-
spectful, and fair trade. Entrepreneurs 
depend on consistent, productive trade 
relations to keep their businesses up 
and running and to put food on their 
employees’ tables. 
These Tennesseans play a special role 
in the U.S. relationship with China. In 
2017, we exported $2.7 billion worth of 
goods to China. That is from the State 
of Tennessee. Imports from China ac-
counted for 7.3 percent of Tennessee’s 
GDP in 2018. They are our third largest 
trading partner, after Canada and Mex-
ico. 
Let me tell you, when things go 
south with the Chinese, Tennesseans 
feel the heat because of our ag trade. 
They are really paying attention to the 
ins and outs of our dealings with 
China, the good and the bad. They see 
the news stories about China’s behav-
ior in Hong Kong and Taiwan, about 
spying, 
about 
intellectual property 
theft, and about those shady apps that 
children have probably downloaded 
onto their phones and their tablets. 
Yes, indeed, they are rightfully con-
cerned. They are concerned because 
they see all of this in the context of 
their day-to-day lives, and they know 
that diplomatic tensions have just as 
much potential to derail their oper-
ations as economic tensions. 
Make no mistake—today’s signed 
deal with China is critical because it 
couples desperately needed relief with 
backstops that will help to keep our 
friends in Beijing in line. What does 
that look like? China agreed to in-
crease purchases of American products 
and services by at least $200 billion 
over the next 2 years, which will reduce 
our trade deficit and take care of our 
farmers, our energy producers, and our 
manufacturers. They committed to re-
ducing nontariff barriers to agriculture 
products and ease restrictions on the 
approval of new biotechnology. 
American producers are covered in 
terms of free-flowing goods and when it 
comes to the nuts and bolts of the busi-
ness of innovation. The phase one deal 
includes stronger Chinese legal protec-
tions for patents, trademarks, and 
copyrights. We wrote in improved 
criminal and civil procedures to com-
bat online infringement and the ex-
change 
of 
pirated 
and 
counterfeit 
goods. These are good signs for our cre-
ative community in Tennessee. It con-
tains commitments by China to follow 
through on pledges to eliminate pres-
sure on foreign companies to transfer 
technology to Chinese firms before 
they are given market access. 
I will tell you, we are going to be 
keeping an eagle eye on this one as we 
move to the phase two negotiations. It 
also includes new pledges by China to 
refrain from competitive currency de-
valuations and exchange rate manipu-
lation. All of this is covered by enforce-
ment measures U.S. officials can trig-
ger if we discover Beijing is acting in 
bad faith. 
I will tell you, so many in our agri-
culture community have said of these 
enforcement mechanisms that this is 
what is going to make a difference in 
their ability to count on trade. Now, 
these protections are more than just an 
ace up our sleeve; it is peace of mind 
for every American who depends on 
trade to support their family. 
So phase one is in the books. What is 
next? More of the nuts and bolts that I 
just talked about. 
If you have been following the past 
few years of our relations with China, 
you know that businesses trying to 
deal with Beijing run the constant risk 
of losing control over their own inven-
tions. Intellectual property theft and 
forced technology transfers have de-
fined China’s relationship with foreign 
businesses. This is what they complain 
about. They steal those inventions and 
sometimes 
actually 
beat 
them 
or 
match them moving into the market-
place. 
In phase two, we will be negotiating 
a deal that ensures participation in the 
Chinese market is not dependent on 
these unbalanced arrangements. Our 
efforts will be backed by previously 
passed legislation that enhanced our 
controls on the export of new tech-
nology—like advanced robotics and ar-
tificial intelligence—and strengthened 
reviews of foreign investment in the 
United States. We know it is an uphill 
battle. We certainly believe it can be 
done. 
I want to make it clear that no trade 
deal is ever going to be perfect. It is 
impossible. However, the first phase of 
this is a good, solid first step. We are 
taking care of our producers, taking 
care of our workers, and opening up the 
flow of goods and services. We are pro-
tecting our innovators in a way that 
will allow them to prospect in one of 
the globe’s most competitive markets 
without risking the loss of their intel-
lectual property. We are giving busi-
ness owners and families peace of mind 
in the form of enforcement mecha-
nisms that will kick in the moment of-
ficials determine our relationship with 
China is about to go off the rails. 
Today, our President signed this deal 
on behalf of the American people, and I 
encourage my colleagues to get in-
volved now as we move forward with 
discussions for phase two. 
I yield the floor.

is happening right now across our 
country and in Washington, DC, and in 
the House and the Senate—and across 
the globe, for that matter. There are a 
lot of issues. There is one that has not 
received the attention it should, which 
is about a group of Americans who 
have suffered enormous calamity in the 
last few days who deserve our atten-
tion and our focus. 
I am speaking, of course, about the 
devastation in Puerto Rico. Seismolo-
gists report that over 1,200 tremors, 
earthquakes, 
and 
aftershocks 
have 
struck the island since January 1. More

than 70 of these were of a magnitude 3.5 
or greater. Residents on the island 
have felt at least 100 of these earth-
quakes. The largest of the quakes, a 
magnitude 6.4, struck last Tuesday, 
taking one life and injuring many oth-
ers. 
More than 2 weeks after the Earth 
started shaking, these quakes and 
aftershocks are still going on. In fact, 
this last weekend, the island was 
struck by an earthquake with a 5.9 
magnitude. Yesterday morning, a 4.6- 
magnitude tremor could be felt. This 
morning, there was a 5.1-magnitude 
quake. 
The damage from these quakes is so 
severe, it can be seen from space. Ac-
cording to NASA, the satellite shows 
the land in parts of Southern Puerto 
Rico, near the epicenter of the quake, 
has moved 51⁄2 inches. That is a very 
dramatic change in the landscape. 
You don’t have to be in space; you 
don’t have to have those images or be 
orbiting the planet and looking down 
to see the damage because the damage 
is everywhere. There is $110 million in 
damages estimated by the Governor’s 
office. Other estimates from the Geo-
logical Survey now have the damage 
approaching $1 billion. 
Power has been restored to most of 
the island, but periodic outages are 
still happening in different parts of the 
island, and severe energy conservation 
is in place. 
The Costa Sur plant in the town of 
Guayanilla was so severely damaged, 
they are telling us that it will take 
over a year to get it up and running. 
That island needs 500 megawatts of 
emergency generation until that plant 
is fixed. 
As of last Thursday, hundreds of 
thousands were without water. The 
world-renowned chef Jose Andres’ re-
lief organization World Central Kitch-
en has served tens of thousands of 
meals in just the last few days. Build-
ings and homes have collapsed and 
been destroyed. Thousands are living 
outside of their homes, both with the 
damage done and the damage feared. 
It is reported that a total of 559 
structures are affected. Look at this 
picture. Look at this pile of rubble 
lined up and crossing the street of col-
lapsed buildings, hundreds of piles like 
that where building, or parts of build-
ings, once stood. There are 4,000 to 6,000 
residents in shelters, thousands sleep-
ing in hammocks or inflatable mat-
tresses and in tents because they are 
afraid to sleep in their homes. 
My heart goes out to the people of 
Puerto Rico who are enduring yet an-
other natural disaster, while they still 
have been fighting to rebuild their 
homes and their lives after the destruc-
tion of Hurricane Maria 3 years ago. 
The truth is, we haven’t done nearly 
enough to help them. Not nearly 
enough from the last disaster has made 
it to the island to help them repair all 
of that damage done. The aid that has 
come has not come quickly enough. 
Indeed, just today, we are hearing 
that the aid that was supposed to be re-
leased no later than last September—$8 
billion related to Hurricane Maria—is 
being released, or at least put in the 
Federal Register so it can be prepared 
to be released years after the disaster, 
when that aid was needed immediately 
after the disaster to rebuild. 
The citizens of Puerto Rico are 
American citizens. They don’t have a 
vote in this Chamber, and that is a 
problem we should remedy. What we 
see is, when citizens don’t have a Sen-
ator who represents them, there is no 
one to stand up and advocate with the 
same ferocity and determination and 
passion as somebody who is elected by 
those individuals, so the rest of us need 
to stand in—Democrats and Repub-
licans, Senators from the South and 
the North and the East and West—we 
need to stand in together on behalf of 
our fellow Americans in this dev-
astated landscape of Puerto Rico. 
This neglect of the citizens of Puerto 
Rico, of this island that is part of 
America, is staggering. That is why I 
have joined with Senator SCHUMER and 
31 of my Democratic colleagues in a 
letter to President Trump supporting 
the Governor of Puerto Rico’s request 
for a major disaster declaration, but 
this shouldn’t be a partisan letter. 
Let’s all join together—Democrats and 
Republicans together—to fight for the 
aid that is needed by our fellow citi-
zens. 
President Trump signed a declaration 
that provides only $5 million for imme-
diate emergency services. Five million 
dollars isn’t close to addressing what 
the Geological Survey says is close to 
$1 billion in damage. That $5 million is 
useful, but far more is going to be 
needed—far more—for removing debris, 
building temporary shelters, providing 
electric generators, distributing food 
and water, providing immediate emer-
gency lifesaving medical care. They are 
going to need a lot of help, in addition, 
for long-term rebuilding. A major dis-
aster declaration can help in that. 
That has not happened. It has been sit-
ting on the desk in the Oval Office 
since last Saturday. 
Let’s join together—Democrats and 
Republicans together—and say: Mr. 
President, sign that declaration that 
brings along with it crisis counseling, 
help rebuilding homes, help repairing 
roads, help restoring bridges, water 
control, water supply. Clean water sup-
ply is so important to health. Water 
treatment, which is so important in 
preventing cholera, job training, aid 
for businesses—that is the type of thor-
ough, significant assistance the people 
of Puerto Rico need, and they need it 
right now, not tomorrow and not a 
month from now, not years from now. 
They need it now. I say, let’s join to-
gether and call on President Trump to 
sign that major disaster declaration 
that unleashes this help. 
There is a lot going on in the world, 
a lot here in Washington. We prepare 
for one of the rare moments in Amer-
ican history where we will be con-
ducting a trial related to Articles of 
Impeachment. Just a week ago Tues-
day, 8 days ago, I was sitting in front of 
a television very worried about esca-
lation to major war with Iran. There 
are big issues going on, absolutely, but 
don’t let these big issues prevent us 
from addressing the plight of our fellow 
Americans. Let’s pay attention. Let’s 
make sure the people of Puerto Rico 
are neither ignored nor neglected. 
Swift action is needed. Let’s join to-
gether and make it happen. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
REMEMBERING CHRIS ALLEN 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last 
week, the Senate Finance Committee 
and the entire Senate lost a dedicated 
public servant—and, by the way, an all- 
around wonderful man—with the unex-
pected passing of Chris Allen. 
Chris had been a member of the Fi-
nance Committee tax team since 2018. I 
was fortunate that he was willing to 
continue in that role when I reclaimed 
the gavel last year after the retirement 
of my friend, and former chairman, 
Orrin Hatch. 
As Members, we are blessed with 
dedicated people like Chris, who come 
to Capitol Hill to perform public serv-
ice. They come here to make a dif-
ference, no matter what their party or 
ideology. They come from all walks of 
life, religious backgrounds, and from 
all over the country. They work long 
hours, and sometimes their work is 
stymied by the political headwinds we 
know about in the Congress of the 
United States. But when an idea is a 
good one and the people pursuing it do 
so with a full heart and focused mind, 
it will eventually become law. 
Last year proved to be a year when a 
number of good ideas finally became 
law in the area of retirement security, 
in no small part because of Chris’ hard 
work and dedication. 
After more than 3 years, we were fi-
nally able to pass the Finance Commit-
tee’s Retirement Enhancement and 
Savings Act. We use acronyms around 
here, and that is RESA. RESA became 
law after it was incorporated into the 
Setting Every Community Up for Re-
tirement Enhancement Act, and that 
acronym is the SECURE Act. 
Chris was very instrumental in help-
ing navigate the long and, at times, 
very contentious process that cul-
minated in this important package of 
retirement provisions being enacted 
just before last Christmas. 
Possibly even more important, Chris 
brought a very deep knowledge of mul-
tiemployer pensions to bear over the 
past several years to help us move for-
ward on important reforms. 
In the last Congress, Chris served as 
the staff director of the Joint Select 
Committee on Solvency of Multiem-
ployer Pension Plans. Congress formed 
this committee for the very important 
job of addressing the impending insol-
vency of a number of multiemployer 
plans and the projected insolvency of 
the multiemployer fund of the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corporation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S222 
January 15, 2020 
With Chris’ steady hand and his tire-
less efforts, the Joint Select Com-
mittee laid a critical foundation in 2018 
for addressing the multiemployer pen-
sion crisis. 
Throughout 2019, Chris carried that 
work forward as a member of my Fi-
nance 
Committee 
staff. 
Through 
months of work with Finance Com-
mittee member offices, and also work-
ing with the HELP Committee, work-
ing with the PBGC, and, most impor-
tantly, stakeholder groups that are af-
fected by any reform we do, Chris was 
the one leading the effort to build on 
the Joint Select Committee’s work of 
the previous year. That effort led to 
the development of the Multiemployer 
Pension Recapitalization and Reform 
Plan that Chairman ALEXANDER and I 
released in November. Resolving the 
multiemployer pension crisis remains a 
top priority, and now there is another 
important reason to see it done in 
Chris’ memory because he put so much 
effort into where we are at this point. 
While Chris has been a key asset to 
the Finance Committee on retirement 
and pension policy, his depth of knowl-
edge was much deeper than just that 
issue. Prior to joining the committee, 
Chris served as Senator ROBERTS’ sen-
ior tax policy adviser for 7 years. Chris 
played a key role in helping us develop 
and pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 
2017. In that effort, he focused heavily 
on the tax rules affecting farmers and 
ranchers across the Nation. Farmers 
and ranchers are a key interest of Sen-
ator ROBERTS and the State of Kansas. 
A close look at Chris’ resume shows 
that he was very successful in working 
for the National Association of State 
Treasurers and then with another orga-
nization, 
the 
Financial Accounting 
Foundation. He also worked at other 
firms linked to his expertise in finan-
cial services, regulation, and legisla-
tion. 
What stands out about Chris is his 
ability to bring folks with very dif-
ferent views together in the classic leg-
islative process. And boy, I watched 
him in meetings on the multiemployer 
pension issues and how he navigated all 
that, and I thought to myself: Without 
Chris, this couldn’t be done. 
He had great ability with numbers 
and great dedication to public policy. 
That is what made Chris stand out. I 
am confident that had the Good Lord 
not taken Chris last week, he would 
have remained a fixture on the Finance 
Committee staff for many years to 
come. Public service was very simply 
at the core of Chris’ identity as a pro-
fessional. 
A key to Chris’ success was his genial 
nature. You might not know it by 
looking at him, but he had a very 
quick wit. It seems like everybody felt 
comfortable with Chris, and Chris was 
comfortable with them. He had a lot of 
contentious meetings. I had a chance 
to observe some of them and his work-
ing with the stakeholders on multiem-
ployer pensions. I saw the comfort they 
had with him, even when he was trying 
to go in just a little different direction 
than certain interest groups might 
have wanted to go because Chris knew 
that to get anything done in this body, 
you have to compromise. As you can 
tell, policy work was fun for Chris. Pol-
icy work was important, and he saw 
policy work as sustaining over a long 
period of time. 
I hope I am pointing out that this 
type of goodwill and dedication was in-
fectious. Every day was meaningful. 
Every day was a source of joy. 
As I said in my statement on Friday 
night after I learned of Chris’ passing, 
Chris was a public servant who brought 
a deep well of knowledge to his work. 
We all know he is going to leave behind 
a legacy of impact on so many lives 
that he was able to improve with his 
expertise, with his confidence, and the 
example he set with his hard work. But 
he never let that keep him from living 
life to the fullest, especially where his 
family was concerned. 
You learn these things about a staff 
member’s family with the crisis of a 
passing, but Chris was a devoted father 
to two wonderful daughters, Lucie and 
Sophie. Chris was a loving husband for 
nearly 30 years to his wife, Lynda- 
Marie. Chris was a thoughtful and com-
passionate son and brother. Chris was a 
fierce friend to so many who came to 
know him during his 58 years. Chris 
knew how to live life. 
Losing Chris is extremely difficult 
for all of us. At times, the finger of God 
reaches down and takes a person who 
we know and love. It is not for us to 
know why that happened. What we 
know is we all got to know Chris and 
got to know him well. He was part of 
our lives, and we all benefited from the 
time that we had with him. We are all 
blessed to have that. 
For his family and the countless oth-
ers who had the good fortune to know 
and work with Chris Allen, a piece of 
him will live on with each of us in 
every memory of him. Whether it was 
of Chris’ positivity and sincerity, or 
the endless way he could inject humor 
into a very difficult situation, Chris 
was a blessing to those who were fortu-
nate enough to know him. 
Rest in peace, my friend, Chris Allen. 
God bless Chris’ family and may He 
show them His grace as they take these 
next steps in their own life’s path. 
Chris will be greatly missed. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor after Speaker PELOSI 
has ended her delay of the Senate im-
peachment trial today. 
For the past month, the American 
people have watched the Speaker, I be-
lieve, make a spectacle of herself. They 
talked about the need to pass this in a 
way that was rushed, that was par-
tisan, that was sloppy, but they had to 
get it done. Their key word from the 
Speaker and from so many in the 
House was ‘‘urgency.’’ We have to get 
this done, they said—urgency, urgency, 
urgency. So they took the vote in the 
House before Christmas. Then the 
Speaker decided to sit on this for 4 
long weeks. She blocked the moving of 
the articles from the House to the Sen-
ate by refusing to send over the nec-
essary papers. 
In the end, the American people, in-
cluding key Members of the Democrats 
in the Senate, realized that this was 
just a political stunt. Even the Senate 
Democrats lost patience with her cyn-
ical scheming. The American people 
saw what this was. A Harvard-Harris 
poll cites that 56 percent of Americans 
say that what she was doing was just a 
political stunt. We are talking about 
the impeachment of the President of 
the United States, but it was just a po-
litical stunt. She should have done her 
job. She should have delivered the arti-
cles in a timely manner. 
Nevertheless, the Senate Republicans 
are ready to move forward today. We 
have the majority’s support to adopt 
the rules that were used in the im-
peachment trial of President Clinton. 
President Trump deserves the same 
treatment. In 1999, all 100 Senators—all 
100—including the Democratic leader, 
Senator SCHUMER, voted for these 
rules, and 77 percent of the American 
public says: Hey, if it is good enough 
for Clinton, we ought to do the same 
thing today. So, after making his own, 
unreasonable demands for weeks, Sen-
ator SCHUMER now says he is ready to 
begin the trial. 
The truth is that the Democrats have 
already made a mockery of impeach-
ment. What they really want is a show 
trial, not a fair trial, and that is what 
happened in the House of Representa-
tives. It was all for show. What do I 
mean by that? Let’s take a look at 
what happened in the House. 
First of all, their hearings were in se-
cret, behind closed doors, in the base-
ment of the Capitol. Then they selec-
tively released misleading information. 
They denied the President due process, 
and they denied the President the op-
portunity to face his accusers and to 
face the whistleblower. Even though 
there was immediate interest and, at 
first, they said ‘‘Oh, the whistleblower 
will testify,’’ they then said ‘‘No, no, 
no. We don’t want you to even know 
who the whistleblower is or what rea-
son or personal issues related to the 
whistleblower may have brought forth 
the reason for that person to come for-
ward. We don’t want you to know 
where the whistleblower’s alliances 
may lie.’’ 
The Democrats have always known 
they cannot remove this President.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S223 
January 15, 2020 
Their real agenda is the 2020 Presi-
dential election and the Senate elec-
tions. Thankfully, the Democrats’ 3- 
year-long partisan impeachment ef-
fort—their goal being to impeach from 
day No. 1—is finally nearing an end. It 
was from day No. 1. We saw ELIZABETH 
WARREN, candidate for President, on 
the debate stage last night. Yet, in De-
cember of 2016, after Donald Trump had 
been elected but before he had even 
been sworn in, she had held a press con-
ference and had talked about impeach-
ing him. 
On the day the President took the 
oath of office, there was a headline in 
the Washington Post that read: ‘‘The 
campaign to impeach President Trump 
has begun.’’ 
Here we are now, over 3 years since 
election day of 2016, and we are getting 
ready to have votes in Iowa in less 
than 3 weeks. So this isn’t really about 
trying to remove President Trump 
from office; it is about trying to influ-
ence the vote of 2020. With voting in 
Iowa being 3 weeks away and the gen-
eral election’s not being far away—No-
vember 3—voters, not Congress, are 
going to decide whether to keep Presi-
dent Trump in office. 
The President has a terrific record to 
stand on. There have been 7 million 
new jobs created since he has been 
elected. The President has cut taxes 
and gutted regulations that have been 
punishing to the economy. There have 
been trade deals. He is signing one with 
China today, and there are additional 
trade deals. We are going to pass the 
USMCA tomorrow. There is a new 
trade deal with Japan. Unemployment 
is at an all-time low. There is a 50-year 
low in unemployment in this country, 
and wages are going up. 
It is time for the Democrats to stop 
wasting the time of the American peo-
ple. There are jobs that need to be 
done. Congress needs to get its job 
done, which is to focus on the issues 
that the American public care about— 
roads, highways, bridges, tunnels, in-
frastructure. There is key legislation 
we need to be advancing, like lowering 
the costs of prescription drugs—helping 
people get insulin that is cheaper for 
them. We need to help those families. 
We need to secure the border. That is 
what is going on. 
To think that we are going to spend 
the amount of time that we are going 
to spend on impeachment as a result of 
what the House has been doing and the 
Democrats have been doing since day 
No. 1 is a misuse of taxpayer money 
and is a misuse of Congress’s time to 
do the job that we were elected to do— 
to help the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
WAR POWERS RESOLUTION 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise 
in support of S.J. Res. 68, to prevent an 
unnecessary 
and 
unauthorized 
war 
against Iran. 
I thank my friend from Virginia, 
Senator KAINE, as well as Senators 
DICK
DURBIN, MIKE
LEE, and RAND 
PAUL, for standing up for our laws and 
for the U.S. Constitution, which gives 
Congress, not the President, the power 
to make war and to authorize the use 
of military force. 
The assassination of Iranian General 
Soleimani was a massive, deliberate, 
and dangerous escalation of conflict 
with Iran by Donald Trump. Rather 
than deterring new attacks on Amer-
ican interests, as the administration 
insists, Soleimani’s assassination in-
vited them, and they came in the form 
of airstrikes on U.S. air bases in Iraq. 
But instead of sharing with Congress 
and the American people information 
and 
intelligence 
that 
justify 
the 
Soleimani attack, President Trump 
and his counselors have deflected, fab-
ricated, and just plain refused to tell 
the truth about the so-called imminent 
threat that was prevented. 
We now have press reports con-
firming that President Trump author-
ized the killing of General Soleimani 7 
months 
ago. 
The 
administration 
doesn’t just look to be misrepresenting 
the imminent threat of Soleimani, it 
appears to be fabricating information 
intended to bypass Congress’s constitu-
tional role to authorize war. 
Last week, President Trump revealed 
more information on the killing to a 
FOX News personality, and he gave 
more information to that personality 
on FOX than he did in a 75-minute 
briefing to the entire U.S. Senate. That 
is completely and totally unacceptable. 
FOX News should not know more about 
our national security interests than 
the 100 Senators who sit here and have 
the responsibility to ensure that we are 
a check and balance on the executive 
branch. 
No evidence has yet been presented 
to support President Trump’s out-
landish claim that Iran would ‘‘prob-
ably’’ target four U.S. Embassies—an 
assertion that was contradicted days 
later by his own Secretary of Defense. 
Perhaps that is why President Trump’s 
latest defense is just to simply throw 
up his hands and say: I am sorry; I am 
not giving you the information that 
you need. He tweets that the immi-
nence test ‘‘doesn’t really matter be-
cause of [Soleimani’s] horrible past.’’ 
So it is no longer imminent threat, 
from his perspective, because he says it 
really doesn’t matter. He decides, and 
he decides without consultation with 
the Congress. 
Here is the lesson Donald Trump 
seems unwilling or unable to learn: The 
truth does matter. In matters of war 
and peace, the truth is nonnegotiable. 
Trump’s reckless actions have put 
tens of thousands of American Armed 
Forces, diplomats, and civilians at 
greater risk, and his continued fabrica-
tions about intelligence threaten to 
draw the United States into an illegal 
war with the country of Iran. 
Look at what has happened as a re-
sult of Trump’s escalation: Our Iraqi 
strategic partners are demanding that 
U.S. troops leave bases in Iraq pre-
maturely, increasing the chance that 
ISIS will reconstitute itself in the re-
gion. The truth matters. 
Iran has announced that it is no 
longer bound by enrichment restric-
tions under the deal. This only makes 
it more likely that Iran will hasten its 
quest for a nuclear bomb. The truth 
matters. 
Despite Donald Trump’s best efforts, 
the United States is a country that 
abides by the rule of law. Our laws say 
Congress has the sole authority to 
make and to authorize war. Neither the 
2001 nor the 2002 authorizations for the 
use of military force can be used to 
provide legal cover for a war with Iran, 
and we owe it to the American people 
to repeal these obsolete authorizations, 
which Presidents of both political par-
ties have abused to justify military 
campaigns in far-flung parts of the 
planet. 
To guard against another quagmire 
as we experienced in Vietnam, Con-
gress acted, through the War Powers 
Resolution of 1973, to rein in Presi-
dential overreach when it came to war. 
That resolution, which informs our de-
bate on the Senate floor today, makes 
it clear that the President cannot put 
our brave men and women in harm’s 
way without a vote by Congress or if 
there is an armed attack on the United 
States. 
Neither the 2001 nor the 2002 author-
ization for the use of military force 
provides legal cover for the killing of 
Soleimani or any other future attacks 
against the country of Iran. 
It bears repeating that a possible war 
with Iran did not begin with Iran’s at-
tack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, 
nor did it begin with the President’s 
decision to select the extreme option of 
assassinating Soleimani. The uptick in 
Iran’s attacks in the region and that of 
its proxies can be traced to President 
Trump’s unilateral and irresponsible 
exit from the Iran nuclear deal—the 
deal to put inspectors in every one of 
the Iranian nuclear facilities. The Iran 
deal was working. It was the best tool 
we have to ensure Iran never obtains a 
nuclear 
weapon—that 
was 
until 
Trump’s capricious decision to pull out 
of 
the 
deal 
and 
crush 
Iran 
by 
ratcheting up American sanctions. 
Trump is now doubling down on his 
failed approach by ratcheting up sanc-
tions on new sectors of the Iranian 
economy. This escalation will make 
the Trump deal that he says he wants 
all the more elusive. 
Before the United States backed out 
of the Iran deal, the President’s own 
CIA Director, Director of National In-
telligence, and the United Nation’s 
international watchdog agency all said 
Iran was upholding its end of the deal. 
Iran was upholding its end of the nu-
clear deal. Since then, however, Iran

has moved away from its nuclear-re-
lated commitments in phases. Most 
worrisome was Iran’s announcement 
last week that it was no longer bound 
by enrichment restrictions under the 
deal. 
But we can still salvage a diplomatic 
outcome. All of Iran’s steps are revers-
ible. For one, Iran remains party to the 
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, re-
quiring it to foreswear acquisition of a 
nuclear 
bomb. 
Additionally, 
inter-
national inspectors from the Inter-
national Atomic Energy Agency main-
tain access to Iranian nuclear sites to 
detect and deter any ramp-up in en-
richment or reprocessing. 
But pulling the United States back 
into a position where we are not going 
to war will require a change in strat-
egy by the President of the United 
States. It means a commitment from 
the President to, one, cease any further 
military action, as today’s resolution 
calls for; two, engage in talks with Ira-
nian President Hasan Ruhani or other 
senior leaders to defuse the crisis and 
to support our allies as they work in 
good faith to preserve the Iran nuclear 
deal; three, make clear that the United 
States does not seek to impose regime 
change in Iran—the future of Iran must 
be decided by the Iranian people alone; 
and four, cease any and all threats 
against Iranian cultural sites and civil-
ians. These would be war crimes. De-
stroying cultural sites is what ISIS 
does. It is what the Taliban does. It is 
what the Chinese Government does. 
That is not who we are in the United 
States of America. Finally, we must re-
peal the 2001 and 2002 authorizations 
for the use of military force imme-
diately. 
Americans strongly reject President 
Trump’s deliberate and escalatory ac-
tion against Iran. They do so not just 
because it is wrong, but they do not 
want to get embroiled into another 
costly war in the Middle East without 
end. A poll last week shows that Amer-
icans by more than 2 to 1 say that the 
killing of General Soleimani has made 
the United States less safe. Sadly, they 
are right. 
In passing Senator KAINE’s resolu-
tion, this body has a chance to reclaim 
our Founders’ vision for the proper role 
of Congress. We are the direct rep-
resentatives of the people. Congress 
must express the will of the people to 
determine when, where, and against 
whom our country decides to go to war. 
We cannot and must not get pulled 
into war with Iran, and we cannot 
allow Trump to start a war all on his 
own. 
I thank Senator KAINE for his leader-
ship on this resolution that I call upon 
all of my colleagues here on the Senate 
floor to support. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, what is 
the business now before the Senate? 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
pending question is H.R. 5430, the 
USMCA bill. 
H.R. 5430 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this 
afternoon, the Finance Committee is 
kicking off this debate. I will have 
some remarks, and then the distin-
guished chairman of the committee, 
Senator GRASSLEY, will have some re-
marks, and Senator BROWN, who has 
played such a key role in the enforce-
ment issues, will follow. 
I am glad we are getting on this de-
bate. There is a lot to say about this 
topic, and I want to talk first about 
how the new NAFTA got to this point. 
In the 2016 Presidential campaign, 
then-candidate Trump said he was 
going to pull the United States out of 
NAFTA. He said it was ‘‘the worst 
trade deal maybe ever signed any-
where, but certainly ever signed in this 
country.’’ 
As President, Donald Trump went in 
a different direction. After negotiating 
with Canada and Mexico, the Trump 
administration announced a deal in 
2018 that actually doubled down on sev-
eral key mistakes of the original 
NAFTA. The new NAFTA the Trump 
administration came up with was way, 
way too weak on enforcement of the 
trade laws. Here in the Senate, we 
Democrats 
said 
it 
wasn’t 
good 
enough—not even close—to get through 
the Congress. So we got down to work 
and we fixed it. 
The bill we will be considering is the 
end product of all that work. This leg-
islation is now the first real measure of 
certainty and predictability on the cru-
cial issue of trade which American 
workers, our businesses, and families 
have. It is the first real measure of cer-
tainty and predictability since the be-
ginning of the Trump administration. 
It now has the strongest trade en-
forcement system ever written into a 
trade agreement. There are significant 
new resources put into protecting 
American 
workers. 
Unfortunately, 
there has been an effort by a few on the 
other side to strip the crucial enforce-
ment resources for enforcing the rights 
of workers and protecting the environ-
ment. It is masquerading under a whole 
lot of procedural lingo, but it is really 
a trojan horse to go back to business as 
usual with weak enforcement of trade 
laws that doesn’t get the job done. 
Over the last week—and I see the dis-
tinguished chairman of the committee 
here—these procedural gimmicks have 
been opposed by the chairman and my-
self. I want to thank the chairman this 
afternoon for doing so. For decades, 
there has been a lot of happy talk in 
Washington 
about 
enforcing 
trade 
laws, but the government just moved 
too slowly and did too little to protect 
American workers when trade cheats 
came after their jobs. Workers and 
businesses were forced to wait for years 
for the government to crack down on 
the rip-off artists, and so often it was 
too late. Workers were laid off, fac-
tories were shuttered, and commu-
nities were left without a beating eco-
nomic heart. 
The original NAFTA was a part of 
the problem. It made strong enforce-
ment almost impossible and was par-
ticularly a problem with labor rights in 
Mexico. The same government that al-
lowed corporations to undercut Amer-
ican jobs by paying rock bottom wages 
and abusing rights in Mexico had the 
power to actually block our country 
from fighting back for the workers. So 
it was a head-scratcher when the 
Trump administration proposed essen-
tially a new NAFTA that kept the old 
NAFTA enforcement system. It ought 
to have been the first part of the origi-
nal NAFTA that they threw in the 
trash can, but, sure enough, in 2018, the 
Trump administration agreed to lan-
guage on trade enforcement that really 
did not enforce anything. 
So Senator BROWN, who has fought 
for years for tough trade law enforce-
ment, said: We are going to get to-
gether, and we are going to change 
this. We put together a proposal that 
makes the U.S. enforcement system 
faster, tougher, and directly responsive 
to American workers and businesses 
that are targeted by the trade cheats. 
Our approach puts trade enforcement 
boots on the ground to identify when 
factories in Mexico break the labor 
standards we should insist on. It will 
be a lot easier to penalize the violators 
and protect the jobs they threaten to 
undercut. Senator BROWN and I worked 
with our colleagues, Democratic col-
leagues on the Finance Committee, but 
we talked to plenty of Republicans as 
well. We took our ideas to the House 
leadership. We got their input and sup-
port. We told the Trump administra-
tion that tough enforcement with what 
has come to be known as the Brown- 
Wyden proposal was going to be a pre-
requisite to getting the new NAFTA 
through Congress. As I said, I think 
this is the toughest labor enforcement 
measure that our country has seen, and 
that is a big reason why the AFL–CIO 
has endorsed the bill. 
When you combine this all-in ap-
proach to enforcement with significant 
new standards on labor and environ-
mental protection, you also get the 
benefit of beginning to stop the race to 
the bottom. You raise other countries 
to the standards set by our country in-
stead of forcing American workers to 
compete in a game that is rigged 
against them. 
These have been core Democratic 
trade policies for a long time. Commit-
ments on labor and the environment 
weren’t a part of the original NAFTA. 
Those issues were just pushed aside 
into what was essentially called a side 
letter. They were the trade policy 
equivalent of a pinky swear and about 
as easy to enforce. Now they are going 
to be at the heart of the agreement. 
The United States will have more 
power than ever to hold Mexico and 
Canada to the commitments made in 
this legislation. 
On technology and digital trade, 
something that I put an enormous 
amount of my time into, the new 
NAFTA redefines what trade policy 
will be about. Digital trade wasn’t even

a part of the original NAFTA because, 
by 
and 
large, 
it 
didn’t 
exist. 
Smartphones were science fiction. The 
internet was still years away. 
Senator GRASSLEY has heard me say 
this many times. The internet was 
years away from becoming the shipping 
lane of the 21st century. The problem 
has been that our trade laws were still 
stuck in the Betamax mindset. 
Technology and digital trade are ob-
viously at the core of a modern econ-
omy. They account for millions of 
good-paying jobs. They are woven into 
every major American industry you 
can think of—healthcare, education, 
manufacturing, agriculture, and the 
list goes on. So when the United States 
fights for strong rules on digital trade, 
it is fighting to protect ‘‘red, white, 
and blue’’ jobs. 
That is why the new NAFTA helps to 
protect our intellectual property and 
prevent shakedowns of American busi-
nesses for their valuable ideas. It also 
includes something that I felt very 
strongly about, and that is it estab-
lished U.S. law that protects small 
technology entrepreneurs that want to 
build successful lasting businesses in a 
field that is now dominated by just a 
few Goliaths. 
It is long past time for the United 
States to bring its trade policy into the 
modern digital world. Getting smart 
digital trade laws on the books is not 
just about boosting exports. What the 
internet looks like in 10, 20, or 50 years 
is going to be an open question. Will it 
be an open venue for communication 
among people around the world or will 
more governments follow the lead of 
China, Russia, Turkey, and Iran, be-
cause what they are talking about 
could fracture the internet around na-
tional borders. Will the internet be a 
platform for free speech or will Chinese 
officials and corporations find new 
ways to reach across the ocean and 
trample on the rights of the American 
people? 
These are just a few of the important 
questions the United States will have 
to confront when it comes to tech-
nology. 
In my view, locking in digital trade 
rules that protect our jobs and promote 
free speech and commerce online is a 
good place to start. Labor rights, envi-
ronmental protection, rules on tech-
nology and digital trade, and aggres-
sive enforcement to protect American 
workers are all areas where there has 
been significant improvement in the 
new NAFTA. I call this ‘‘trade done 
right.’’ 
My State, along with Senator GRASS-
LEY’s State, is so dependent on trade. 
One out of four jobs in Oregon revolves 
around international trade. They often 
pay better than do the non-trade jobs 
because they have a higher value-added 
component. Most of them are small 
businesses, and they export. Agri-
culture is a big part of our economy. 
The new NAFTA will put more of our 
wine on shelves outside the United 
States. It will increase dairy exports. 
It will end unfair practices that dis-
criminate 
against 
American-grown 
wheat. 
Oregon companies that sell services 
like apps and engineering plans to cus-
tomers overseas will have new protec-
tions under the digital trade rules. It 
will help our manufacturers because 
the new NAFTA raises the bar and in-
cludes 
those 
protections 
on 
labor 
rights I have described. 
There are a lot of Members to thank 
who pitched in. We are going to hear 
from a number of them on the floor, 
and I am going to thank them before 
we wrap up. 
I will close with this. The last few 
years have delivered one trade gut 
punch after another to our farmers, our 
shippers, our manufacturers, and our 
exporters. The administration has driv-
en away traditional economic allies. A 
lot of manufacturers are hurting. Farm 
bankruptcies 
have 
surged. 
Foreign 
markets are more closed off—many of 
them to American exports—than they 
were before the Trump administration 
began. With this legislation we have an 
opportunity to begin—and I want to 
underline that, to begin—to change 
that. 
I particularly want to thank Senator 
BROWN for his laser focus and leader-
ship on the issue of enforcement. I 
think Senator CANTWELL, who will 
speak on this issue soon, has done a 
particularly good job about trying to 
build an infrastructure for enforcing 
our trade laws. I think it is only appro-
priate to have a special Senate shout- 
out for Ambassador Lighthizer, who 
has been straight with members of our 
committee. I know the chairman will 
speak on that next. I call him the hard-
est working man in the trade agree-
ment debate. 
I support this bill. I hope my col-
leagues will do it. I know the chairman 
will have remarks, and Senator BROWN 
will be here. Other colleagues will be 
here. I know Chairman GRASSLEY is 
glad we are getting at this. I share his 
views. 
We have plenty to do on healthcare 
and other issues, and we look forward 
to working with him. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
President pro tempore is recognized. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, be-
fore I start my remarks, I think it is 
important for all Senators to know 
that when there were negotiations 
going on between the White House and 
the Democrats in the House of Rep-
resentatives, one of the real sticking 
points was enforcement. I think every-
body expects a trade agreement to be 
enforced, but a lot more had to be done 
than what was originally agreed to 
when the agreement was signed. 
I want to recognize Senator WYDEN 
and Senator BROWN because months be-
fore, maybe even years before—I don’t 
want to take away from how hard they 
were working on some ways of improv-
ing enforcement—but at least they had 
an idea out there that was salable to 
both sides. I don’t know whether it was 
100 percent or 90 percent or 80 percent 
that was incorporated in this bill, but 
their laying the groundwork was the 
basis for getting an agreement between 
the White House and the House of Rep-
resentatives so we could move this to 
the point where the Senate is going to 
pass it tomorrow, I hope. So I thank 
Senator WYDEN
and Senator BROWN, 
who is not here, but maybe you can tell 
him I said thank you. 
Mr. WYDEN. I will. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. It is said that good 
things come to those who wait. Others 
say it is better late than never. Either 
way, we can agree that this day has 
been a long time coming. 
With the passage of the United 
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement by 
what will be an overwhelming margin 
here in the U.S. Senate, America’s 
economy will continue to thrive and 
drive 
prosperity 
for 
hard-working 
American farmers, workers, and tax-
payers all across our economy. 
You have heard the old saying: ‘‘A 
rising tide lifts all boats.’’ The new 
NAFTA, the bill that we are working 
on, puts a bigger oar in the water for 
our trilateral trade relationship with 
our northern and southern neighbors. 
It is important to point out that we 
wouldn’t be here without the bold lead-
ership and the determination of Presi-
dent Trump. The President is doing ex-
actly what he said he would do. 
So many people running for Presi-
dent run on a platform, but they don’t 
stand on that platform. He ran on a 
platform of doing something about 
what he considered were bad trade 
agreements, and, of course, he is stand-
ing on that platform. 
Undaunted by those who set to throw 
him out of office since day one, Presi-
dent Trump forged ahead for the good 
of the American people. He forged 
ahead to update and improve NAFTA 
for Americans. We heard, during the 
campaign, that it was the President’s 
opinion that it is the worst agreement 
that has ever been made. I might not 
agree with the extreme of that, but I 
do know, as Senator WYDEN has point-
ed out, that there were a lot of things 
that weren’t even negotiable 30 years 
ago when we first sought NAFTA, and 
at least an updating needed to be done. 
The President has done more than 
update. As the President promised dur-
ing his campaign, at the end of the day, 
President Trump successfully steered 
that final trade pact into the 21st cen-
tury. He did so with a tireless and te-
nacious team of advisers, especially 
the leadership of the U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative, Bob Lighthizer. Senator 
WYDEN just gave more adjectives to 
Bob Lighthizer’s work, and I associate 
myself with the remarks and the de-
scription that Senator WYDEN gave to 
Bob Lighthizer’s heavy lift to get this 
job 
done 
because 
Bob 
Lighthizer 
worked in good faith to broker and 
fine-tune the USMCA. 
Mr. Lighthizer built a strong and 
sweeping coalition to strengthen and

expand markets for U.S. agriculture, 
manufacturing, and service exports. 
Mr. Lighthizer built a broad and sweep-
ing coalition to improve labor and en-
vironmental protections in a balanced 
fashion, and Mr. Lighthizer built a 
broad and sweeping coalition that will 
end up growing wages for our workers. 
He ensured that all of this would be 
subject to strong enforcement, which is 
the bedrock of any good trade agree-
ment, and it is in that enforcement 
that he took good ideas from Wyden 
and Brown. 
Unfortunately, these efforts that I 
just described to you became entangled 
in a time-wasting partisan roadblock 
from the House of Representatives. It 
is unfortunate for the American people, 
especially our farmers, ranchers, and 
workers, 
that 
public 
policymaking 
took a back seat to a partisan obses-
sion of impeaching the 45th President. 
That is a shame. 
The President is upholding his prom-
ise to put America and Americans first. 
His message resonates with tens of mil-
lions of Americans who want to restore 
the American dream for their children 
and grandchildren. These Americans 
want the next generation to have the 
same opportunity to lay claim to the 
American dream that nine generations 
before, going back to the Colonies, 
have built upon so that each genera-
tion can live better than the preceding 
generation. 
That American dream is that if you 
work hard and play by the rules, you 
can earn a good living, get ahead, and 
stay ahead. A big plank in President 
Trump’s platform is fixing broken 
trade agreements. USMCA is not the 
first of it because he has worked with 
Japan, and he has worked with Korea, 
and today we saw the signing of phase 
one of the Chinese agreement, so he is 
making great progress. 
The President is determined to stop 
America’s farmers and manufacturers 
and workers and consumers from being 
taken for a ride. When it comes to un-
fair trade agreements, we are finding 
out now that the buck stops with 
President Trump. I am not sure, 3 
years ago, I would have said that, but 
I think after 3 years and USMCA, the 
Chinese agreement, the Korean agree-
ment, the Japanese agreement, and 
some other things he has done in trade, 
he ought to wake everybody up that 
what he ran on in his platform he has 
carried out. 
With NAFTA, when it took effect 26 
years ago this month, the digital econ-
omy and the commercialization of the 
internet didn’t even exist. The USMCA 
creates the first U.S. free trade agree-
ment with a digital trade chapter. 
These important measures will help 
the $1.3 trillion U.S. digital economy to 
flourish and grow faster. It improves 
efforts to stop importers of counterfeit 
goods from ripping off consumers, pro-
ducers, and content creators. It pro-
vides for copyright and patent protec-
tions to uphold trade secrets and to se-
cure data rights so that American inge-
nuity and innovation will drive eco-
nomic growth, create jobs, drive up 
consumer choices, and drive down 
prices for goods and services our con-
sumers need. 
The USMCA levels the playing field 
for the U.S. auto industry by encour-
aging companies to use more North 
American content and higher wage 
labor. USMCA also fixes enforcement 
flaws that hog-tied NAFTA from keep-
ing everyone accountable to their com-
mitments. 
Speaking of hogs, the new NAFTA is 
good news for American farmers and 
ranchers. My State of Iowa happens to 
benefit from this to a great extent be-
cause my State is the Nation’s No. 1 
pork producer. In 2018, Canada and 
Mexico bought more than 40 percent of 
U.S. pork exports. These exports sup-
port 16,000 U.S. jobs. 
USMCA preserves critical, duty-free 
access to Mexico and Canada. It re-
moves unfair restrictions on U.S. farm 
and food products. For the first time 
ever, U.S. eggs and dairy exports will 
be sold in Canada. This is very good 
news. It means an additional $227 mil-
lion for dairy exports to Canada and 
$50.6 million of exports into Mexico. 
My home State of Iowa also is the No. 
1 egg producer in the country. USMCA 
will increase U.S. exports of poultry 
and eggs to Canada by $207 million. It 
also addresses restrictions that kept 
U.S. wheat and wine out of Canada. 
I thank the former Iowa Governor 
and previous Agriculture Secretary, 
Tom Vilsack, because, as the leading 
Democrat in the State of Iowa, he set 
aside partisan motives embraced by 
other Members of his party to work to-
gether with Senator ERNST, Governor 
Kim Reynolds, and me to champion 
USMCA. 
According to the U.S. International 
Trade Commission, the USMCA will 
raise real GDP by more than $68 bil-
lion, and USMCA will create nearly 
176,000 jobs. So, all told, the trade pact 
is forecast to boost farm and food ex-
ports by at least $2.2 billion. Consid-
ering the slump in the farm economy, 
it is really shameful that passage of 
the USMCA was stalled for over a year 
and nearly derailed by a partisan agen-
da, including the impeachment. 
Under 
the 
Trump 
economy, 
the 
United States is enjoying the longest 
economic expansion in U.S. history. 
Ratification of the USMCA will help 
America’s economic engine fire on all 
cylinders and refuel prosperity in rural 
America. 
If you remember, I mentioned at the 
beginning of my remarks that passage 
of the USMCA is better late than 
never, and while I am looking forward, 
I also take this opportunity to call on 
Canada to quickly ratify the agree-
ment. Now that Mexico has ratified 
and the United States will soon be done 
with our ratification, all eyes will be 
on Canada to get the job done quickly 
so that we can all work together to im-
plement this agreement. I don’t have 
any doubt that Canada is going to do 
that because I had opportunities ear-
lier last year, several times, to visit 
with the Canadian Foreign Minister, 
and she was very certain that they 
would be passing this. 
Let’s not delay the people’s business 
on other important matters before us, 
such as drug pricing and retirement 
and pension legislation that would pro-
vide peace of mind for Americans for 
their healthcare and financial security. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The clerk will call the 
roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, to-
morrow I will do something I have 
never done in my time in the House 
and Senate. I will vote for a trade 
agreement for the first time in my ca-
reer. I am voting for that trade agree-
ment because of the work my colleague 
from Oregon Senator WYDEN and I did 
to fix President Trump’s deal and se-
cure new protections for American 
workers for the first time ever, in spite 
of the President’s intransigence, in 
spite of the President’s lining up, as he 
always does, with corporate interests. 
Our trade agreement, for the first 
time ever—ever—put workers at the 
center of this agreement. Every trade 
agreement I have seen in my time in 
Congress—the North American Free 
Trade Agreement, the Central America 
Free 
Trade 
Agreement, 
the 
trade 
agreements 
with 
Colombia, 
South 
Korea, and Panama, the permanent 
normal trade relation with China—one 
after another, every one of these trade 
agreements, every one of these trade 
actions were written fundamentally in 
secret by corporate interests to serve 
corporate 
interests. 
Workers 
were 
never at the center of these trade 
agreements. 
One of my proudest votes in the 
House was against the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. I have voted no 
ever since. Again, it is because all of 
these trade agreements were written 
by corporations to maximize profits 
and compensation for executives and to 
enrich stockholders, always at the ex-
pense of workers and at the expense of 
communities like Mansfield, Ports-
mouth, Toledo, and Youngstown, OH. 
I was talking to a friend of mine in 
Trumbull 
County, 
former 
Senator 
Cafaro. She knows what has happened 
with these trade agreements. We all 
know how they undermine commu-
nities and hurt workers, always, again, 
because these trade agreements were 
written by corporations in secret. 
We have watched the spread of the 
corporate business model because of 
NAFTA and these trade agreements 
and because of the Trump tax policies, 
where you pay a lower tax rate if you

move overseas than you pay in the 
United States, and in spite of, in those 
days, Ranking Member WYDEN’s efforts 
to stop those kinds of tax breaks that 
go to the richest people in the country. 
With those business models, you shut 
down production in Lima or in Zanes-
ville or in Cleveland, OH. You get a tax 
break, you move overseas, and then 
you sell your products back in the 
United States. That has been the busi-
ness model based on our trade policy 
for years. 
Candidate Trump promised some-
thing different. He promised to renego-
tiate NAFTA. The problem is, when he 
put his agreement in front of us, it was 
the same old, same old. They were the 
same old economic policies that, again, 
put corporate interests in the center of 
this trade agreement. It was a trade 
policy that was like all of our trade 
policies in the past. 
Over and over again, this President 
has betrayed workers, from tax give-
aways to corporations, to his judges 
who put their thumbs on the scale, al-
ways supporting corporate interests 
and putting corporations over workers 
and always supporting Wall Street over 
consumers. 
As we know, down the hall, where 
Senator MCCONNELL’s office is—almost 
every day he walks down here to try to 
confirm far-right extremist judges, al-
ways young judges who do that same 
thing: put their thumb on the scales of 
justice, always supporting corporations 
over workers. 
As I said, last year, we got an initial 
draft of President Trump’s agreement. 
It was another betrayal. His first 
NAFTA draft was nowhere near the 
good deal that the President promised. 
He had negotiated, pure and simple, an-
other corporate trade deal. It meant 
nothing for workers, and it was a sell-
out to drug companies. In fact, the 
White House looks like a retreat for 
Wall Street executives, except on Tues-
days and Fridays, when the White 
House looks like a retreat for drug 
company executives. 
It 
took 
us—Senator 
WYDEN
and 
Speaker PELOSI
and unions—months 
and months and months working to-
gether to improve this deal. The Presi-
dent resisted and resisted and resisted, 
but we finally approved a deal to put 
workers at the center of our trade pol-
icy. 
We have a provision that Senator 
WYDEN and I will talk about that says 
violence against workers is a violation 
of the agreement. It might sound obvi-
ous, but it has never been in a trade 
deal before. For the first time ever, we 
spell out workers’ right to strike. 
Again, it should be obvious, but it was 
never included before. 
If the workers don’t have that right 
to strike—not something workers want 
to do very often, if ever. My wife, 
whose dad was a utility worker in the 
union for 35 years, talks about growing 
up. They went on strike twice when she 
was a kid. Workers never really recover 
from a strike, but sometimes they have 
to. It needs to be in trade agreements 
to make sure workers’ rights are pro-
tected. 
We have improved some of the 
legalese that, since the beginning, has 
been included in our trade agreements 
to make it nearly impossible to win a 
case when a country violates its labor 
commitments. 
Most importantly, we secured our 
Brown-Wyden provision that amounts 
to the strongest ever labor enforce-
ment—ever—in a U.S. trade deal. The 
provision Senator WYDEN and I wrote 
and fought for is the first improvement 
to enforcing the labor standards in our 
trade agreements since we have been 
negotiating them. 
We know why companies close fac-
tories in Ohio, in Oregon, and open 
them in Mexico. They pay lower wages, 
and they take advantage of workers 
who don’t have rights. They have 
weaker and nonexistent environmental 
laws. 
American 
workers 
can’t 
compete 
when companies move overseas and ex-
ploit low-wage workers. We essentially 
get a race to the bottom on wages. The 
only way to stop this is by raising 
labor standards in every country we 
buy and sell to and in every country 
with which we trade and export and 
import, raising labor standards, mak-
ing sure those standards are actually 
enforced. 
If corporations are forced to pay 
workers a living wage and treat them 
with dignity and really honor the dig-
nity of work no matter where those 
workers are located, then we take 
away the incentives to move jobs over-
seas. 
Think about this. The missions of 
companies in the United States state— 
it is sort of the business practice of 
shutting down production in Niles, OH, 
and moving it overseas. They will be 
less likely to do that if the workers 
overseas are paid decent wages. Then 
those workers will be able to buy our 
products because they are more likely 
to be in the middle class. 
That is what Brown-Wyden is all 
about. It is a completely new way of 
holding corporations accountable. A 
worker in Mexico will be able to report 
if a company violated their rights. 
Within months, we can determine 
whether workers’ rights have been vio-
lated, and we take action against that 
company. 
We apply punitive damages when 
companies cheat, break the law, stop 
workers from organizing, and if they 
keep doing it, the final strong enforce-
ment is we stop their goods from com-
ing into the United States. In essence, 
we say: OK. You are cheating. You are 
breaking the law. You are violating 
your workers’ rights. You are not going 
to have access to the U.S. market. 
That is enforcement. 
When Mexican workers have the 
power to form real unions and nego-
tiate for higher wages, it helps our 
workers. Mexican workers right now 
can be paid as little as $6.50 a day. The 
minimum wage per hour in our coun-
try—in Tennessee, Oregon, and Ohio— 
is higher than that. This is $6.50 a day. 
We have been asking American workers 
to compete with that. 
We have already heard some critics 
say Brown-Wyden will force Mexican 
wages to rise. I know a lot of CEOs who 
make $7 million, $8 million year who 
want to keep wages low in other coun-
tries. They accuse us of forcing Mexi-
can wages to rise. That is kind of the 
point. That is what we want to do be-
cause it takes away incentives for 
those CEOs—those $7 million, $8 mil-
lion, $9 million-a-year CEOs in Amer-
ica—from looking abroad to hire cheap 
labor and to exploit workers and make 
more money for themselves. 
I want to especially thank Senator 
WYDEN and his staff. Without his en-
dorsing the proposal and without his 
pushing aggressively, we would not be 
here. 
I want to be clear, though. We will be 
straight with American workers. It is 
not a perfect agreement. One trade deal 
that the Democrats fixed, over the 
President’s opposition, is not going to 
bring back auto plants like the Presi-
dent promises. 
I have real concerns that the auto 
rules of origin are much weaker than 
the administration says they are. We 
know the administration always exag-
gerates its successes and doesn’t tell 
the truth about many of the things it 
does. 
We know that this trade agreement 
was a corporate trade agreement and 
not a worker trade agreement. Now 
workers are at the center. We will be 
watching the President. He needs to 
ensure companies actually comply with 
these rules. I will demand we strength-
en them if we need to. 
One trade deal the Democrats fixed 
also will not undo the rest of President 
Trump’s economic policies. It is a pol-
icy that, as I said, put corporations 
over workers. We haven’t raised the 
minimum wage because the President 
is opposed. The President took over-
time pay away from 50,000 Ohioans by 
changing the rule on how overtime is 
paid. This deal is not going to fix all 
that. 
This USMCA is not going to stop out-
sourcing 
when 
we 
have 
President 
Trump’s tax plan that gives companies 
a tax break to send jobs overseas. 
I am going to keep fighting President 
Trump’s corporate trade policies and 
tax policy, just as we did with this 
agreement. We have more work to do 
to make our trade agreements more 
pro-worker. 
I will vote yes. As I said at the out-
set, I will vote yes for the first time 
ever on a trade agreement because, by 
including 
Brown-Wyden, 
Democrats 
have taken another corporate trade 
deal brought to us by President Trump 
and Democrats have made this agree-
ment much more pro-worker. As the 
Senator from Oregon knows, we have 
set 
an 
important 
precedent 
that 
Brown-Wyden will be included—must

be included—in every future trade 
agreement. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to pose some ques-
tions to my colleague from Ohio. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WYDEN. He has done so much 
work on these issues—not just in the 
last few months but for years and 
years. I want to thank him for his ex-
traordinary commitment to the rights 
of workers and to all these commu-
nities that, he has pointed out, essen-
tially lose their economic heartbeat by 
trade policies that cheat workers. 
I want to ask the gentleman about 
this. I have heard this, and I have 
heard this in lots of places. People have 
said: These ideas seem good, but are 
they really that consequential? 
Mr. BROWN has been at this for more 
than a quarter of a century. We have 
watched him out on the floor year after 
year after year. Let me give my cal-
culation of what this package which we 
have worked on and which he deserves 
so much credit for consists of. 
As far as I can tell—and we have 
worked on it with the staff—this is the 
fastest enforcement process by more 
than 300 percent because of what the 
Senator has done to speed up the 
timeline for protecting workers. It is 
the toughest because for the first time 
it allows our country to hit the worst 
actor the hardest by stopping rip-off 
artists at the individual factory level. 
It is the strongest because it allows us 
to hit companies that repeatedly vio-
late the law. We are able to stop the 
products of exploitive labor at the bor-
der. 
I want to ask the Senator a couple of 
questions, but I wanted to give this 
overview first. Having been at this for 
more than a quarter of a century, is 
there any trade enforcement regime 
that, in terms of those specifics, comes 
close to what that new regime would 
consist of? 
Mr. BROWN. I thank Senator WYDEN. 
I thank him for his help in putting this 
all together. 
Not even close. We have seen trade 
agreement after trade agreement that 
simply is not—even when labor stand-
ards look fairly strong, they are not 
ever really enforceable. Part of what 
we 
recognized—we 
went 
back 
and 
looked at what happened after NAFTA 
was passed, and not just what people 
promised but what happened with 
NAFTA 
and 
what 
happened 
with 
CAFTA. We have seen that, with any 
attempts at labor enforcement, the 
companies or the governments that 
don’t want to enforce labor laws find a 
way, as lawyers are very good at doing, 
of just taking forever. They slow-walk. 
So whenever you push them to do 
something, they end up staying in 
court. 
There was a Central American case 
in Guatemala, I believe, that went on 
for 7 or 8 years. You know the old say-
ing: Justice delayed is justice denied. 
You can’t really get enforcement if the 
people who have done the violation, 
who have committed the violation, 
take forever. 
So speed is one of the things. Mr. 
WYDEN mentioned at the outset how 
important that is. Another part of it is 
and one of the things we knew would 
speed it up, No. 1, and would mean that 
enforcement would work was that the 
workers would have an ability to kick 
off the investigation, to literally call a 
toll-free number. They can register 
that they have seen child labor viola-
tions; that they have seen workers at-
tacked, violence aimed against work-
ers; that they have seen wages denied 
for all kinds of illegal reasons. So 
workers can speak out and band to-
gether and go to a panel and get quick 
action. 
If a company keeps doing it—we 
found cases where a company would get 
a little slap on the wrist. They would 
do it again and get a slap on the wrist 
and then do it again. So what we did 
was we increased the penalties. The 
first time, they get fined. The fine is 
proportional to the violation, so it is 
not a huge penalty. The second time, it 
is more. The third time, we can deny 
that company NAFTA benefits if they 
sell in the United States. 
Essentially, if you break the law, if 
you attack workers, if you keep out 
the union illegally, if you deny pay to 
workers who have earned it, you are 
going to see your market dry up in the 
United States. That is the best incen-
tive to stop. We literally keep the prod-
uct out of the market, out of the 
United States, if you are a serial cheat-
er and a company that does that to its 
workers. 
Mr. 
WYDEN. 
I 
appreciate 
Mr. 
BROWN’s taking us through this. It is 
faster. It is tougher because it gets at 
the individual factory level. It is 
stronger because it stops those repeat 
offenders who come up with products 
using exploitive labor. 
I want people to know and have it 
highlighted in the RECORD
that my 
take is that this, given what we have 
seen over the last 25 years, is far better 
than anything we have seen before. 
Look, the Senator and I have worked 
on a lot of enforcement efforts over the 
years. He will recall that at one point 
I chaired the Trade Subcommittee, and 
we found people tripping over them-
selves to cheat because they were mer-
chandise laundering. It was a little bit 
different from this. We set up a dummy 
website just to try to keep tabs on all 
the people who were cheating. We 
would remember—and we didn’t know 
whether to laugh or cry—that all over 
the world, people were coming forward 
to cheat. That was useful. It didn’t 
come close to the breadth of what has 
been done here. 
Let me just ask a couple more spe-
cific questions because I have heard 
lots of people in all the campaigns and 
the like talking about whether this 
was modest or really a bold set of 
changes. Now we have just walked 
through how much stronger this is 
than anything we have seen in the last 
quarter-century. 
The gentleman mentioned how work-
ers can use this hotline to enforce their 
rights. If a worker reports violations of 
their rights at a call center and the 
government believes the complaint has 
merit, my understanding is that the 
government is obligated under the law 
to send labor inspectors to that facil-
ity. Is that correct? 
Mr. BROWN. Yes. Whether it is a call 
center or an auto factory, if the viola-
tions occur and there is evidence that 
there are violations—and in many 
cases, we know about them because 
workers have spoken out—then inspec-
tors can go into those factories. 
One of the outcomes of this: We know 
corporations don’t want that kind of 
punishment. We know corporations 
don’t want to see inspectors there 
looking at their businesses because 
there have been legitimate, reasonable 
accusations of lawbreaking. So that is 
going to mean that corporations will 
probably quit breaking the law. 
Those corporations that have decided 
to move to Mexico because it is easy to 
evade labor laws and they can pay low 
wages, when they see we mean busi-
ness, when they see the USMCA—Sen-
ator WYDEN and I took an agreement 
that 
was 
another 
corporate 
trade 
agreement handed down by President 
Trump and fixed it, so it has these 
strong labor provisions. When they see 
that we mean business, that we are 
going to enforce these labor laws, and 
that we are going to pass an agreement 
that works for workers, some compa-
nies are going to think twice about 
shutting down production in Youngs-
town, Marietta, Toledo, or Dayton and 
moving overseas. That is part of the 
goal of this enforcement too. 
Mr. WYDEN. If you would, Senator 
BROWN, take us through what kinds of 
actions can be taken against a facility. 
In other words, my understanding is, if 
the labor inspectors find violations 
when they inspect it, they have a host 
of remedies. The gentleman touched on 
this in the committee, but what kinds 
of actions can be taken against that 
particular facility? 
Mr. BROWN. First let me talk for a 
second about a sector that is very im-
portant in my part of the country: the 
auto sector. If a company cheats in an 
auto facility in a Mexican community 
and we find labor violations and we 
take action against that company, the 
action is not against just that com-
pany’s facility in that community. If a 
company cheats its workers and has 
broken the law on any number of labor 
violations, that applies to any product 
that company ultimately sends in from 
any one of its factories in Mexico. It 
addresses sort of the Whac-A-Mole kind 
of attempts companies might have: 
Well, they cheat there, but they bring 
in products from somewhere else. 
We look at that in a pretty broad 
way. Fundamentally, it works this

way: If we find a violation, first, there 
is a fine, and the fine is essentially pro-
portionate to the violation, meaning 
that it is not as punitive. The first of-
fense is not especially punitive. The 
second and the third offense get more 
serious. For the second offense, the fine 
is much greater—beyond proportion-
ality, if you will. The third offense is 
when we step in and deny them NAFTA 
benefits, deny them access to our mar-
kets, and deny them the breaks they 
get under NAFTA at the border on the 
tariffs. So if it is a violation of labor 
law, by the third violation, the enforce-
ment and the penalties are such that 
the companies are going to quit doing 
it. 
I mean, that is the whole point. I 
don’t want to levy these fines. I want 
companies to obey the labor law that 
the Mexican Government has passed in 
their new labor law and that are under 
the NAFTA agreement. 
Mr. 
WYDEN. 
So 
would 
Senator 
BROWN be saying that if it is found that 
there were labor violations at a car fac-
tory, the penalties could apply to any 
car that might come into the United 
States from that factory throughout 
the investigation, not just going for-
ward? 
Mr. BROWN. Correct, from that fac-
tory and also from other factories 
owned by the same automaker, so that 
you can’t cheat one place and expect to 
get all your autos into the United 
States without tariffs. 
We thought a lot about this. Over the 
last 20 years, we looked at what has 
happened. We looked back over the last 
couple of decades, working with the 
very good Democratic staff of the Fi-
nance Committee and with our office, 
and found every possible example we 
could on how violations occur and how 
you stop those violations. So we built 
in a process. It is pretty complicated, 
and it took a while. 
As I said, the President handed down 
another 
corporate trade agreement 
that helps corporations at the expense 
of workers, and we weren’t going to let 
that happen this time. That is why the 
Trump USMCA took a long time to 
pass—because for a whole year, they 
were resistant to good labor enforce-
ment. They wanted to help their cor-
porate buddies. 
Senator WYDEN will remember that 
there was a provision in there to help 
the drug companies, a big giveaway to 
the drug companies. We said no to 
that. Speaker PELOSI said no to that. 
We stripped that out of the agreement. 
We wanted this agreement to center on 
workers—not to help the drug compa-
nies, not to help Wall Street, not to 
help and encourage those companies 
that outsource jobs. 
Mr. WYDEN. I have appreciated this 
colloquy with Senator BROWN. 
I have a couple of town meetings at 
home 
this 
weekend, 
working-class 
neighborhoods, where trade has been 
really important. One out of four jobs 
in my State revolves around trade, and 
those jobs often pay better than do the 
nontrade jobs. If anybody says ‘‘Well, 
Ron, do you think anything is really 
going to be accomplished with what 
you and Senator BROWN are talking 
about?’’ I am going to say that I went 
through the entire enforcement process 
in terms of the key provisions, and we 
laid out for the country and the Senate 
that you have led an effort to speed up 
by more than 300 percent the timeline 
for an enforcement action. I mean, it 
used to take years and years some-
times. You have shortened that by lit-
erally more than 300 percent. You have 
been part of an effort that is tougher 
because you can go after the individual 
factories. 
Then, finally, I think this enforce-
ment proposal gets to the heart of 
what we need to be doing because it 
means if you rip off workers, we are 
going to stop products those workers 
have produced at the border. 
My guess is, there will be a lot more 
discussion. I see we have another valu-
able colleague from the Finance Com-
mittee who has been heavily involved 
in these issues for a lot of years. But I 
want to say again that this didn’t hap-
pen by osmosis, because when we got 
that flawed bill, I think everybody 
said: Well, they will probably have 
some discussions about it, and that 
will be pretty much it. 
Mr. BROWN. I saw this when Senator 
WYDEN and I announced the success of 
getting Brown-Wyden into the bill. I 
heard from a lot of—shall we say—pro- 
Trump, pro-corporate lawmakers in 
this body, mostly on that side of the 
aisle but all over. They were pretty 
angry because they thought this was 
going to be another trade agreement— 
USMCA was going to be another trade 
agreement written by corporations, 
mostly written in secret, that will 
serve corporate interests, that will pad 
the bottom line, that will help million- 
dollar-a-year executives make multi-
million dollars a year, that will help 
their major stockholders and will ig-
nore workers. 
They were fine with that because 
that is too often what this body does. 
They found that—oh, my gosh—this 
trade agreement actually puts workers 
at the center. That was, I know, your 
goal and my goal. That is why people 
at your town meetings in Eugene and 
Portland and Bend and all over Oregon 
are going to hear from you about how 
this will help the middle class, fun-
damentally. 
I appreciate the time. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I 
think this has been central to what we 
will be debating and we will be voting 
on tomorrow morning. 
I want to thank Senator BROWN. This 
bill would not have happened without 
tough trade enforcement led by Sen-
ator BROWN. This bill would not have 
happened, period, full stop. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, be-
fore the senior Democrat, the ranking 
member of the Finance Committee, 
leaves the floor and before the Senator, 
my colleague from Ohio, leaves the 
floor, I want to thank them both. We 
would not be here on this day without 
them and without their leadership— 
both of them. 
When SHERROD BROWN says that he 
has never met a trade agreement he 
wanted to even think about sup-
porting—thank you for making this 
one that virtually all of us can support. 
My highest regards. 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA TRADE 
AGREEMENT 
Madam President, I have a speech 
here that starts off with ‘‘Mr. Presi-
dent’’ over and over again, but I am 
going to say ‘‘Madam President.’’ I rise 
today to discuss the new treaty to re-
place the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, affectionately known as 
NAFTA. 
Last week, those of us who serve on 
the Finance Committee had an oppor-
tunity to evaluate the new NAFTA. In 
fact, about a half dozen or so commit-
tees have been given different jurisdic-
tions to do that, with respect to this 
trade agreement. 
As you know, trade deals are often 
dense agreements that have hundreds 
of provisions relating to any number of 
issues. Ultimately, trade agreements 
and trade legislation move through the 
Senate Finance Committee. We just 
heard from two of our senior members. 
As another senior member of that 
committee for many years now, I have 
considered many trade bills and looked 
at what impact those bills would have 
on American consumers, producers, 
manufacturers, 
farmers, 
and 
busi-
nesses—citizens. After all, our econ-
omy depends on making sure that 
other countries can sell to us and that 
we can sell to other countries, espe-
cially close allies like Canada to our 
north and Mexico to our south. 
Following 
years 
of 
uncertainty, 
thanks to the President’s haphazard 
trade wars, I believe this agreement 
will provide a measure of certainty for 
those who help drive our economy. Pro-
visions included in the new NAFTA 
will help in our State, on the Delmarva 
Peninsula, our poultry producers gain 
better access to Canadian markets. It 
is not just important to Delaware; it is 
important to Delaware, Maryland, Vir-
ginia, and other places where they 
raise chickens. 
Further, the new trade deal increases 
market access for dairy farmers in 
Delaware, and those across the coun-
try, to sell their milk products—prod-
ucts like powdered milk—to Canada. 
The International Trade Commission 
estimates that this will allow for an 
additional $315 million in exports annu-
ally. That is a $315 million increase in 
exports just under the milk side, the 
dairy side, in sales to Canada every 
year. 
When we evaluate the new NAFTA as 
what it is—a trade deal—I believe that 
it makes significant improvements on 
past trade agreements, including the

original NAFTA. New NAFTA adds 
stronger language to ensure that the 
obligations to all three counties under 
multilateral 
environmental 
agree-
ments, including the Kigali Amend-
ment to the Montreal Protocol, can be 
fully enforced. I will come back and 
talk more about that in a short while. 
Thanks 
primarily 
to 
Democrats, 
though, it is no longer the case that 
the failure of one NAFTA country to 
ratify an environmental agreement can 
be used to prevent the others from 
being held accountable for failing to 
honor their obligations. New NAFTA 
also includes new provisions that have 
never been included in trade agree-
ments before. 
Environmental violations will now be 
treated as trade violations, so when the 
United States does bring cases under 
the new NAFTA’s environmental obli-
gations, those cases will be easier to 
win going forward. 
This agreement also includes signifi-
cant new wins for coastal States, in-
cluding binding provisions around over-
fishing, around conservation of marine 
species, and marine debris. When we 
talk about marine debris, just keep 
this in mind: There is, floating out in 
the oceans of the world, something 
called 
the 
Great 
Pacific 
Garbage 
Patch. It is largely plastics. It is twice 
the size of Texas—not twice the size of 
Delaware, not twice the size of Mary-
land; it is twice the size of Texas. 
In addition to the $88 million for en-
vironmental monitoring, cooperation 
and enforcement, the new NAFTA cre-
ates an enforcement mechanism that 
gives environmental stakeholders an 
expanded role in enforcement matters. 
This will go a long way toward ensur-
ing that environmental violations can 
be investigated and remedied in a sub-
stantive and timely manner. 
My colleagues have heard me say be-
fore that I have a friend who, when you 
ask him how he is doing, he replies: 
Compared to what? 
Well, compared to all the previous 
trade agreements that this body has 
considered, new NAFTA and its imple-
menting legislation have the strongest 
environmental enforcement provisions 
we have seen to date, period. That is 
good news, especially for a trade deal 
put forth under this administration. 
Does the new NAFTA include every-
thing that my Democratic colleagues 
and 
I—and 
some 
Republican 
col-
leagues—would have liked to see with 
regard to environmental protection? 
No, it does not. 
This new NAFTA fails to recommit 
the United States, for example, to the 
Paris accord. It fails to ratify the 
Kigali amendment that I mentioned 
earlier to the Montreal protocol, which 
could bring the global community to-
gether to reduce the use of something 
called HFCs, hydrofluorocarbons, found 
in products like air conditioners and 
freezers, and prevent, by the use of 
those follow-on products to HFCs, up 
to a half-degree Celsius increase in 
global warming by the end of this cen-
tury, just for doing this one thing—one 
thing. 
Like so many of the Trump adminis-
tration’s proposals, the new NAFTA 
fails to even mention the words ‘‘cli-
mate change.’’ This trade agreement 
does add important tools and resources 
that were primarily negotiated by 
Democrats to strengthen the deal, hold 
the administration accountable to en-
force NAFTA countries’ obligations, 
and help ensure that those who break 
the rules are actually held account-
able. 
As the senior top Democrat on the 
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee in the Senate, I am especially 
aware of the extreme and destructive 
environmental policies put forth by the 
current administration. 
Week after week, I have helped to 
lead the fight against some reckless 
rollbacks, too many unbelievably un-
qualified candidates, and their relent-
less attempts to chip away at our Na-
tion’s bedrock environmental protec-
tions. We know what to expect from 
this administration when it comes to 
environmental policies. 
As a result, I know that the environ-
mental provisions in new NAFTA— 
thanks to the hard work from Demo-
crats in both the House and the Senate, 
and some Republicans too—are far 
stronger than where we started. It is 
certainly not perfect, and we can, and 
we must, do more going forward. But it 
is better than we have ever done be-
fore, and that must be recognized. 
I want to pause for a moment to 
thank Ambassador Robert Lighthizer 
and his staff—the Trade Ambassador, 
Trade Rep’s office—for their hard work 
and their willingness to engage with 
my colleagues and with me. It has been 
an extraordinary outreach, great re-
sponsiveness. I just want to say thank 
you to the Ambassador and to his 
team. It reminds me of what we had 
with Michael Froman when he was the 
Trade Rep in the last administration. 
Let me end it with this, if I could: 
While it is good news that we were able 
to reach an agreement on the new 
NAFTA, I want to caution my col-
leagues that the uncertainty caused by 
President Trump’s haphazard approach 
to trade is far from over. President 
Trump’s multifront trade war with our 
allies and our trading partners is ap-
proaching 2 years now. That is 2 years 
of American farmers, American manu-
facturers, retailers, and small busi-
nesses experiencing increased costs 
from President Trump’s tariffs while 
simultaneously being locked out of 
overseas markets due to retaliatory 
tariffs. 
That is 2 years of uncertainty and 
disruption for American business that 
have had to put investments and hiring 
decisions on hold and 2 years of uncer-
tainty for the American workers who 
are not sure if their jobs will continue 
to exist as trade wars drag on. 
Where has that gotten us? A limited 
trade agreement with Japan, which 
may be better than nothing, but it is 
largely an attempt to cover up some of 
the negative effects that withdrawal 
from the transpacific trade partner-
ship, TPP, has had on our economy and 
our global competitors. 
For those who don’t remember, TPP, 
Trans-Pacific Partnership, as you will 
recall, negotiated in the last adminis-
tration, was a 12-nation trading bloc, 
negotiated primarily by the U.S. Trade 
Representative, Michael Froman, and 
his staff. That included 40 percent of 
the world’s economy in one trading 
bloc, 12 nations. Guess who led it: We 
did. Guess who was excluded: China, for 
the bad behavior they sometimes fol-
low. On the outside, they were looking 
in. And somehow we walked away from 
that. What we have come up with in its 
place is something that is, in my view, 
not nearly as bold and, unfortunately, 
not the path we have taken. 
I am still reviewing the text of the 
‘‘phase 
one’’—I 
will 
put 
that 
in 
quotes—China trade deal that was 
signed, I think, today. But from what I 
have seen, the agreement falls far short 
of the structural reforms to China’s 
planned 
economy 
that 
President 
Trump has ‘‘trumpeted’’ for some time. 
As best as I can tell, the structural re-
forms in China’s economy did not make 
the final cut. 
As we enter this new year and a new 
decade, I sincerely hope our President 
will rethink what many believe are 
senseless approaches to trade and re-
turn to a multilateral approach—much 
as we had on the Trans-Pacific Part-
nership—where 
the 
United 
States 
works with our allies and trading part-
ners to constructively write the global 
rules of trade. 
With that, I see one of my colleagues, 
also from Ohio, rising to address a wel-
coming audience. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
appreciate my colleague from Delaware 
and his comments on trade. 
I ask unanimous consent that my 
colleague from Ohio, SHERROD BROWN, 
be permitted to address the Chamber 
for a brief tribute following my re-
marks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PORTMAN. I am on the floor 
today to talk about international 
trade. What a week it has been. In the 
same few days, we are seeing the cul-
mination of nearly 3 years of effort by 
this administration to deliver wins for 
American workers, for businesses, for 
farmers, and for consumers with regard 
to our three biggest trading partners, 
China, Canada, and Mexico. 
This is a big week. While the media is 
focused on impeachment—and I can say 
that because as I walked in that is all 
the reporters wanted to talk about— 
here we are on the floor talking about 
something that directly affects the 
constituents we represent. I think it is 
very positive in all three areas—China, 
Canada, and Mexico. In a way, it is like

the World Series and the Super Bowl of 
trade all in the same week because 
these are big agreements that make a 
big difference. 
The U.S.-Mexico agreement is being 
finalized, and it will be voted on tomor-
row. 
Second today is the signing of phase 
one of the China agreement, something 
many of us have been focused on over 
the past few years and wondered 
whether we would get here, and here 
we are. 
As a former trade lawyer and as a 
former 
U.S. 
Trade 
Representative 
under George W. Bush and as someone 
on the Trade Committee, which is the 
Finance Committee here, I follow these 
issues closely. Most significantly, I 
come from Ohio, which is a State that 
depends on trade and depends on that 
trade being fair to our workers, our 
farmers, our service providers, and our 
small businesses. We have a lot of man-
ufacturing and a lot of agriculture. In 
fact, 25 percent of our State’s factory 
workers have export jobs. One out of 
every three acres planted in Ohio is 
planted for export. Think about that. 
When you drive through our beautiful 
State and you see the corn and the soy-
beans out there in the field, one out of 
every three acres is being planted to be 
exported somewhere else. That is great 
for our farmers. It gives them markets, 
and it raises prices for their product at 
a time when they really need it. By the 
way, these trade jobs are good jobs too. 
Jobs dependent on trade pay, on aver-
age, about 16 percent more than other 
jobs, and they have better benefits. We 
like to be able to send more to the rest 
of the world. 
We have about 5 percent of the 
world’s population in this country. We 
have to be sure that with 25 percent of 
the world’s economy here and 5 percent 
of the people, that we are selling stuff 
overseas to the other 95 percent. It is 
always in our interest to open up over-
seas markets for our workers, our 
farmers, our services, and our service 
providers. While promoting those ex-
ports, we need to ensure that we are 
protecting American jobs from unfair 
trade and from imports that would un-
fairly undercut our workers and our 
farmers. 
Simply put, we want a level playing 
field. With that level playing field, 
where you get fair and reciprocal treat-
ment from other countries, we will do 
just fine. 
American workers and businesses can 
compete, and they can win if it is fair. 
That is all we are asking for. To me, 
the sweet spot is balanced trade, where 
we are able to send our exports over-
seas without high tariffs and other bar-
riers, and we are able to see imports 
coming in fairly traded into the United 
States. If we do that, we will be fine. 
The good thing about this week is 
that both of these agreements—the 
new USMCA, which replaces NAFTA, 
and this phase one of the China agree-
ment—are exactly focused on how to 
have balanced trade. At times, re-
cently, other countries have been won-
dering whether the United States was 
going to make progress on trade, to be 
frank, so this week is also important 
because the world is watching. What 
the world is seeing is that we can fulfill 
our stated interest in renegotiating 
and improving trade agreements and 
trade relationships. 
Concluding these two agreements 
proves that the United States can get 
to ‘‘yes’’ on these very big issues. We 
are able to work through our partisan 
differences here at home. We just saw 
this on the floor this afternoon where 
Democrats and Republicans alike are 
talking 
about 
their 
support 
for 
USMCA. In tough negotiations with 
our trading partners—we had some 
tough negotiations with Canada, Mex-
ico, and China—we can reach outcomes 
that benefit our country and help to 
create that more effective balance for 
American workers. 
There is, perhaps, no better example 
of this balance than USMCA. Without 
it, by the way, we go back to the status 
quo, which would be NAFTA. That is a 
25-year-old agreement that had to be 
updated. It just doesn’t reflect the re-
alities of a modern economy. Thanks 
to important measures designed to 
strengthen our economy, create jobs, 
and increase market access for Amer-
ican exports, this new USMCA will help 
level that playing field we talked 
about. 
First of all, USMCA means American 
jobs and economic growth. The inde-
pendent International Trade Commis-
sion has studied it. They have said this 
new agreement will create at least 
176,000 new jobs and will grow our econ-
omy. It also says that with regard to 
the auto industry, it will create tens of 
thousands of jobs. That is, again, very 
important to Ohio. We are a big State 
for auto production. These jobs are 
going to mean a lot to workers in my 
State. 
Part of the way it is going to create 
jobs is by leveling the playing field 
with enforceable labor standards. We 
just heard about this from the Senator 
from Oregon and the Senator from 
Ohio, about how this agreement has 
new enforceable standards with regard 
to labor. 
It also, though, has higher content 
requirements for U.S.-made steel and 
auto parts. This is important. I will 
give you an example. USMCA requires 
that 70 percent of the steel and 75 per-
cent of overall content in USMCA-com-
pliant vehicles come from USMCA 
countries. In other words, other coun-
tries can’t come in and take advantage 
of the lower tariffs that we are pro-
viding under USMCA by adding too 
much to the content of those vehicles. 
The 75-percent overall content require-
ment is up from 62.5 percent in NAFTA. 
That makes that 75 percent the highest 
percentage of any trade agreement we 
have. It means more jobs in the United 
States, in particular, and fewer im-
ports from countries like China, coun-
tries like Germany, countries like 
Japan that otherwise would come in 
and take advantage of this. 
Some have criticized these content 
provisions as being somehow protec-
tionist. I disagree. We are saying to 
these countries that if you want freer 
trade with us, enter into a trade agree-
ment, lower your barriers, and give us 
access to your markets as we are giv-
ing Mexico and Canada access to our 
markets. That is what a trade agree-
ment is all about. If you don’t want to 
do that, you shouldn’t be able to free 
ride on our USMCA. I think this makes 
sense. Why should Japan or China or 
Germany be a free rider on our agree-
ment with Canada and Mexico? 
This will incentivize good jobs in 
America, but it also incentivizes these 
other countries to enter into trade 
agreements with us. They can see that 
if you do an agreement with the United 
States, it is balanced and fair. You will 
have some benefit as well. The Inter-
national Trade Commission expects 
that USMC will grow our economy by 
double the gross domestic product of 
that projected to be increased under 
what is called the Trans-Pacific Part-
nership. I tell you that because TPP, 
Trans-Pacific Partnership, is one that 
Members on the other side of the aisle 
have talked about as being such a great 
agreement. This grows the economy by 
more than double based on the ITPF 
estimate. Again, this is a big deal. 
USMCA also means important new 
rules of the road for online sales. So 
much of our commerce today takes 
place over the internet, but there is 
nothing to protect it or promote it in 
NAFTA. Because it was done 25 years 
ago when there was hardly any inter-
net business, it doesn’t have any pro-
tection. 
This USMCA was written to fix that. 
It does. It prohibits data localization 
requirements by banning tariffs on 
data online and by raising the de mini-
mis level on customs duties for sales to 
Mexico and Canada. This means they 
can’t require the servers to be in Can-
ada or Mexico, as an example, for our 
digital economy here in the United 
States, which is one of our great ad-
vantages. For a lot of small companies 
in Ohio and around the country and for 
startups that do business online and 
rely on smaller shipments, this is very 
important. The relief from the customs 
burdens and also the data localization 
requirements and the inability for 
other countries to put tariffs on data is 
really important. This is great for us 
as a country. 
The third thing I want to mention is 
that American farmers are going to see 
unprecedented levels of access to new 
markets in Canada and Mexico under 
USMCA. Between bad weather, low 
prices even going into the bad weather, 
and the tariffs that were in place to get 
to this agreement with China, in par-
ticular, farmers have been hit pretty 
hard. So this is the light at the end of 
the tunnel. This gives them a chance, 
under USMCA, to get some new mar-
kets. That is why nearly 1,000 farm

S232 
January 15, 2020 
groups around the country have an-
nounced publicly that they strongly 
support this agreement. 
A lot of politicians and pundits have 
their views on who won the negotia-
tions over USMCA that we will vote on 
here tomorrow on the floor. You can go 
back and forth on that, but in my view, 
thanks to the hard work of U.S. Trade 
Representative Robert Lighthizer and 
thanks to President Trump pushing on 
this, the winner here is the American 
people. That is who I think benefits the 
most. They are going to benefit from a 
new, more modernized trade agreement 
that will replace an agreement that 
has shown its age with unenforceable 
labor and environmental standards, 
nonexistent digital economy provi-
sions, and outdated rules of origin pro-
visions that allow more automobiles 
and more auto parts to be manufac-
tured overseas rather than being manu-
factured here in the United States. 
I think the American people benefit. 
We all benefit. I am glad we are going 
to finally have a chance to vote on this 
landmark trade agreement. I urge that 
tomorrow we pass it on a bipartisan 
basis, and I think we will. Getting this 
to the finish line is a significant 
achievement but to also do it signing 
onto the phase one agreement with 
China today is really incredible. 
Again, it has been a strong week. I 
want to congratulate Bob Lighthizer, 
the Trade Rep, President Trump, and 
others who worked to bring this win to 
the finish line. 
When I was U.S. Trade Rep for 
George W. Bush, we conducted the 
first-ever economic relationship review 
with China. We issued a report, and it 
concluded that our trade relationship 
with China lacked equity, durability, 
and balance. Well, 13 years later, China 
still doesn’t play by the rules. So much 
of that continues. One reason the trade 
deficit with China is going to be the 
largest in the world is because of that. 
In 2018, we sent China about $180 billion 
in exports, and they sent us about $560 
billion in exports. That means we had a 
resulting trade deficit of about $380 bil-
lion—the biggest trade deficit in the 
history of the world. That is a problem, 
but it is more than just the trade def-
icit. That isn’t the only way to meas-
ure trade. 
Beijing 
routinely 
uses 
subsidies, 
state-owned enterprises, and a lack of 
transparency by government control 
on their own economy in order to sur-
pass the United States as the world’s 
economic and innovation leader. Chi-
na’s current policies undercut critical 
commitments China made, both to the 
WTO, the World Trade Organization, 
and to us and other countries—agree-
ments that they would open up their 
market, protect intellectual property 
rights, adhere to international recog-
nized labor rights, and meet its WTO 
commitments on unfair trade practices 
such as subsidies, which they provide. 
I encourage you to read the U.S. 
Trade Representative’s section 301 re-
port on China. That is its basis for this 
phase one agreement and the basis for 
the administration putting those high-
er tariffs in place on Chinese products 
over the past couple of years. The re-
port notes that in 2016, the multilat-
eral Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development, OECD, 
ranked China the fourth most restric-
tive investment climate in the world, 
despite them being the second largest 
economy in the world. Based on this 
OECD report, China’s investment cli-
mate is nearly four times more restric-
tive than that of the United States. 
That is why we needed to take some 
action and have a negotiation with 
China to come up with something that 
was mutually beneficial. 
I have supported these 301 actions by 
President Trump to create this more 
level playing field for American work-
ers, farmers, and business owners. The 
only significant leverage we had to be 
able to do that, by the way, was by 
controlling access to our own market 
by raising tariffs. Higher tariffs had 
collateral consequences, and we have 
seen that for our consumers and other 
countries. They have been a necessary 
evil to hold China’s feet to the fire and 
force them to the negotiating table and 
to get the result we have seen today. 
These tough measures are now pay-
ing off. Think about it in terms of what 
I said before—equity, durability, and 
balance. In the interests of a more bal-
anced relationship, phase one directly 
addresses that $380 billion trade deficit 
we talked about. China has agreed to 
increase its purchases of American 
products by at least $200 billion over 
the next 2 years, with additional in-
creases likely in the future. That is 
going to help reduce our trade deficit 
and provide some relief, particularly in 
the agricultural, manufacturing, and 
energy sectors. 
The agreement includes provisions to 
make our relationship more equitable. 
That includes new commitments on in-
tellectual property protection, new ob-
ligations on tech transfer, and a dis-
cipline 
on 
currency 
manipulation, 
similar to that which is in the U.S.- 
Mexico-Canada 
Agreement. 
Specifi-
cally, Beijing committed to eliminate 
pressure on U.S. companies to transfer 
their intellectual property to Chinese 
firms as a condition of doing business 
in China. This is a big deal, and it is a 
critical step in addressing the IP theft 
China has used to fuel its economic 
rise. Chinese companies aren’t forced 
to hand over their patents as a condi-
tion of doing business here in America 
and American companies shouldn’t be 
forced to do the same in China. 
We will also be able to keep a closer 
eye on China’s currency manipulation. 
When the Treasury Department found 
evidence of manipulation to boost Chi-
nese exports, they labeled Chinese a 
currency manipulator for the first time 
since 1994. That designation was just 
lifted because of phase 1. This new 
agreement contains new transparency 
and accountability commitments to 
ensure that American trade enforcers 
can better monitor future manipula-
tion. 
The phase 1 agreement is a first good 
step toward creating a more balanced 
and equitable relationship between our 
two countries, but our trade relation-
ship will remain durable only if we en-
force these agreements. That is why it 
is also very significant that this agree-
ment includes the option to reimpose 
tariffs should China fail to live up to 
the commitments it has made. 
Enforcement is critical. Just as the 
rest of the world is watching our suc-
cess at getting to ‘‘yes’’ on these trade 
agreements, it is also watching how ag-
gressively we are going to enforce 
these commitments. That is why it is 
imperative that the United States uti-
lize this enforcement process asser-
tively and swiftly should we find evi-
dence that China has violated its com-
mitments. Congress is watching. 
With such a big day for trade, espe-
cially only a couple of weeks into the 
new year, it would be easy to ask if 
anything else is left for the rest of the 
year. My answer is, yes, there is a lot. 
We should celebrate our accomplish-
ments tonight, but tomorrow continues 
to bring a host of challenges and oppor-
tunities to advance a bold trade agen-
da. 
Most importantly, the next step is to 
negotiate the phase 2 agreement with 
China that will address the additional 
structural issues I mentioned earlier— 
the subsidies, the state-owned enter-
prises, and the lack of transparency— 
that make doing business in China an 
uphill battle. Resolving these issues 
will be critical to ensuring that our 
two economies are playing by the same 
set of rules, not different sets of rules. 
Between the USMCA and this phase 1 
agreement, 2020 has already been a sig-
nificant year for trade, but there is 
even more progress we are set to make. 
I look forward to phase 2 negotiations 
with Japan this spring, especially re-
garding new market access for ‘‘Made 
in America’’ automobiles. I look for-
ward to potential FTA talks with Swit-
zerland and with the United Kingdom 
post-Brexit—new trade agreements to 
open up more market access. We also 
want to ensure that the extension of 
the WTO moratorium of tariffs on data 
continues, and I hope we will see re-
newed efforts at WTO reform. We need 
to address America’s longstanding fun-
damental concerns about the appellate 
body, special and differential status, 
and the decline of the WTO’s negoti-
ating function. We have lots to do. 
I hope Congress will consider new 
legislation to toughen our anti-dump-
ing and countervailing duty laws this 
year to crack down on trade cheats, 
and I hope we will pass the Trade Secu-
rity Act to return section 232 to its 
original purpose of protecting genuine 
national security threats. 
Clearly, there is a lot of work we can 
do in 2020, and I look forward to it. Yet 
we should pause today and congratu-
late the Trump administration on 
these two successes we have talked

about. I have long advocated for bal-
anced trade that prioritizes market 
opening and tough enforcement, and I 
believe that both the USMCA and the 
China agreement embody this philos-
ophy of balanced trade. Most impor-
tantly, I believe our country is better 
off because of it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Ohio. 
REMEMBERING CHRIS ALLEN 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to 
honor a dedicated public servant whom 
we tragically lost last week, Chris 
Allen. 
Chris served in the Senate for nearly 
a decade, most recently on Senator 
GRASSLEY’s staff. I appreciate that 
Senator GRASSLEY happens to be pre-
siding right now as the President pro 
tem of the Senate. Chris was a leader 
in our efforts to solve the pension cri-
sis that threatens the retirement secu-
rity of more than a million Americans, 
including a number of people in the 
Galleries today. 
My staff and I got to know him well 
while working together to find a bipar-
tisan solution. He was part of what we 
consider to be a sort of pensions family 
in the Senate. We didn’t always agree, 
but 
Chris 
always 
understood 
the 
stakes. He took this crisis seriously. 
He knew it affected people’s lives in 
the most central way. He understood 
what collective bargaining was about— 
meaning, you give money up today in 
wages to protect your future. He was 
committed to finding a solution. Most 
importantly, 
as 
Senator 
GRASSLEY 
knows, he always treated the retirees 
with dignity, and he respected their 
work. He understood what this retire-
ment crisis meant to those families 
and the pressures they were under. 
In 2018, when we worked together 
with him and Senator GRASSLEY’s staff 
and 
Chairman 
Hatch 
and 
Senator 
PORTMAN on our bipartisan pensions 
committee, we held a field hearing in 
Columbus in order to hear directly 
from current workers, retirees, and 
small businesses. Chris came to Ohio 
for the entire field hearing. He didn’t 
have to, and a lot of staff members 
didn’t. Yet he understood how impor-
tant it was to talk to the people whose 
livelihoods were at stake in this crisis. 
Workers and retirees came from all 
over Ohio. Companies that had often 
been in business for 100 years came 
from all over the region for that hear-
ing. We had a 25,000-person rally out-
side the Ohio State Capitol. I would 
add again that a number of people in 
the Galleries today were at that rally. 
Our staff was a little nervous about 
how Chris might react when he saw 
that, for his boss had had some dis-
agreements with these folks in the best 
way to find a solution. Yet Chris just 
looked at that sea of people and said: 
‘‘That’s cool.’’ 
That empathy was a part of who he 
was. He was responsive. He was kind 
and thoughtful. He embodied the deco-
rum of what the Senate should be. He 
wasn’t interested in partisan warfare. 
At a time when too many people re-
treat to their partisan corners, that 
was not Chris Allen. That spirit of co-
operation and of mutual respect will be 
missed more than ever. He was dedi-
cated to his work. He was dedicated to 
the people whom our work affects. 
He would meet for hours and do 
whatever it took to work toward a so-
lution. The only thing he stopped for 
was his family. Chris was a devoted fa-
ther to his two daughters, Lucie and 
Sophie. Connie’s and my hearts go out 
to them and to Lynda, Chris’ wife. I 
know nothing we can say could erase 
the pain of the sudden death of a father 
and a husband so young. I hope they 
take some comfort in knowing how 
many lives, starting with Senator 
GRASSLEY’s, Chris touched. We miss 
him. We will continue to fight for a bi-
partisan solution that honors Chris’ 
memory and protects the pensions that 
American workers have earned over a 
lifetime of work. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from Washington State. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague for mentioning and 
honoring Chris Allen, and our sym-
pathies to the Grassley family. Thank 
you so much for talking about the hard 
work that so many of our staff do 
around the Capitol that people don’t 
realize. While we have lost some on our 
side, too, it is important to remember 
those who give so much of their time 
and energy to make our country bet-
ter. 
H.R. 5430 
Mr. President, I rise to support the 
US-Mexico-Canada Agreement we are 
going to be voting on tomorrow, and I 
want to thank all the people who 
worked on it, including Senator GRASS-
LEY, Senator WYDEN, Senator BROWN, 
Speaker PELOSI, and many other people 
to get us a final product that I think 
we all believe should move forward. 
It is very important to me, coming 
from one of the most trade-dependent 
States, that we continue to open up 
trade markets, but I hope my col-
leagues will also realize that the world 
economy has reached a tipping point. 
Over half of the world is now either 
middle class or wealthier. So that 
means that we have more people to sell 
more U.S. products to. That means big-
ger market opportunities for U.S. man-
ufactured goods, for agriculture prod-
ucts, and a way for us to continue to 
compete in some of our most important 
industries. That is why I have always 
supported making sure that we con-
tinue to open up trade markets in a 
fair way. And for us in Washington 
State, the North American Free Trade 
Agreement was a positive move. In the 
context, prior to the NAFTA agree-
ment for Washington, in Mexico, there 
was $300 million of Washington exports. 
Now there is more than $2 billion, and 
they are our largest export market for 
Washington apples. 
Today, Canada, you can see a similar 
story. Prior to the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, our products 
into that country were roughly about 
$2 billion; today, they are more than $9 
billion. So continuing to modernize the 
North American Free Trade Agreement 
is an important step for Washington 
and for our economy. The important 
aspects of this deal help us open and 
get a fair playing field for wheat, for 
making sure that digital trade con-
tinues in a fair way, and that dairy 
products are accessed into Canada in a 
fair way and that our wine industry— 
believe it or not, Canadians drink a lot 
of wine, particularly in British Colum-
bia, and they have not always given us 
fair access to that market. So it is very 
important that it will increase access 
to Washington wines into Canada, 
which is the largest market for Wash-
ington wines, buying about $10 million 
in exports a year. But as I mentioned, 
USMCA will maintain a duty-free ac-
cess for our dairy products to Mexico; 
it will certainly make sure that our 
wheat products are on a level playing 
field and continue the access to digital 
trade. 
I want to thank my colleagues Sen-
ator BROWN and Senator WYDEN and 
Speaker PELOSI and all those in the 
labor movement who worked hard with 
getting an enforcement and capacity- 
building provision in this legislation. 
But what we are doing here that I 
know of for the first time is business 
and labor coming together and saying 
‘‘we need to build the capacity within a 
country so that they can enforce trade 
agreements.’’ This is a positive step, 
not just for Mexico, but a positive step 
for what we need to do around the 
globe. I wish we could just say to every 
country, ‘‘Yes, put up the regime to en-
force these laws, and make it happen 
tomorrow, and we can help you and 
your economy.’’ But it just doesn’t 
work like that. And when you retreat 
from trade—and, trust me, I believe 
this administration has retreated from 
trade when it starts with a tariff-first 
approach. You cannot start the discus-
sion with throwing out tariffs and then 
penalizing our farmers and then think-
ing that we are going to get the door 
open. So I am all ears to hear how we 
are going to get a real agreement with 
China. 
But I thank my colleagues who did 
the hard work on this USMCA agree-
ment to make enforcement and capac-
ity building real for the first time. 
Why? Because as we look at that world 
economy outside the United States, it 
is one of the biggest economic opportu-
nities we will see. That is, we know 
how to grow things. We know how to 
make things. We should make sure we 
are opening up markets in a fair trade 
regime to those products. So I will con-
tinue to work with our colleagues here 
to make sure that that is achieved. I 
hope the President will stop the tariff- 
first approach, stop the continuation of 
the tariffs and the impacts that we are 
seeing now, and get down to continuing 
to negotiations with our being a leader 
for opening up markets.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S234 
January 15, 2020 
The United States can’t lose shelf 
space to very, very competitive mar-
kets and then come back years later 
and try to regain it. Let’s be a world 
leader in establishing the rules for fair 
trade and pushing for provisions like 
we see in the USMCA agreement so we 
can move forward, making sure Wash-
ington products, U.S. Products, Amer-
ican-made products, get delivered to a 
growing, wealthier world. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
CHINA TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise 
in opposition to the NAFTA 2.0 trade 
agreement negotiated by President 
Trump. 
This agreement is opposed by labor 
unions like the International Associa-
tion 
of 
Machinists 
and 
Aerospace 
Workers, as well as by the United Food 
and Commercial Workers International 
Union. It is opposed by numerous envi-
ronmental organizations, including the 
Sunrise Movement, the Sierra Club, 
Friends of the Earth, the League of 
Conservation 
Voters, 
and 
virtually 
every major environmental organiza-
tion in the country. Further, it is op-
posed by the National Family Farm 
Coalition, which believes it will lock in 
rules that have devastated family- 
based agriculture and expand corporate 
control 
over 
agriculture 
in 
North 
America. 
I am proud to stand with these labor 
unions, with the environmental groups, 
and family farmers against President 
Trump’s NAFTA 2.0. 
I not only voted against NAFTA in 
1993, but I marched against it. In 2000 I 
voted against permanent normal trade 
relations with China. I opposed the 
U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement and 
other trade agreements. 
The bottom line is that we need trade 
agreements in this country that work 
for workers, that work for farmers, and 
not just the CEOs of large multi-
national corporations. 
There is no doubt in my mind that we 
need to fundamentally rewrite our dis-
astrous trade agreements and create 
and 
protect 
good-paying 
American 
jobs, and that we need trade agree-
ments that will improve the environ-
ment and combat climate change, and 
we need trade agreements that end the 
destructive race to the bottom, where 
workers are forced to work for lower, 
lower wages. 
Unfortunately, 
this 
revised 
trade 
agreement with Mexico and Canada 
does none of these things. It must be 
rewritten. 
While NAFTA has led to the loss of 
nearly 1 million American jobs, this 
agreement does virtually nothing to 
stop the outsourcing of jobs to Mexico. 
Under this agreement, large multi-
national corporations will still be able 
to shut down factories in America, 
where workers are paid some $28 an 
hour, and move to Mexico, where work-
ers there are paid less than $2 an hour. 
When Donald Trump was a candidate 
for President, he promised that he 
would stop the outsourcing of Amer-
ican jobs to Mexico, China, and other 
low-wage countries. That has not hap-
pened. 
The truth is, since Trump took of-
fice, over 170,000 American jobs have 
been shipped overseas. In 2018, we had a 
recordbreaking $891 billion trade def-
icit in goods, a $419 billion trade deficit 
with China, and an $81 billion trade 
deficit with Mexico. 
In 2018, for the first time in our his-
tory, manufacturing workers began 
getting paid less than workers overall. 
It used to be that manufacturing work-
ers made really good wages compared 
to the rest of the workforce. It is not 
the case anymore. 
Today, manufacturing workers get 
$28.15 an hour, while the average work-
er makes 15 cents an hour more. Last 
month we lost 12,000 factory jobs, and 
despite Trump’s rhetoric, we are in a 
manufacturing recession. 
There is a reason why virtually every 
major environmental group is opposed 
to Trump’s NAFTA 2.0. This agreement 
does nothing to stop fossil fuel compa-
nies like ExxonMobil and Chevron from 
dumping their waste and pollution into 
Mexico and destroying the environ-
ment. In fact, it makes it easier for fos-
sil fuel companies to bring tar sands oil 
into the United States through dan-
gerous pipelines like the Keystone XL. 
This proposal does not even mention 
the word ‘‘climate change.’’ Imagine in 
the year 2020 that we have a major 
trade agreement that does not even 
mention the words ‘‘climate change,’’ 
the existential threat facing not only 
our country but the entire planet. 
This deal preserves the disastrous in-
vestor-state dispute settlement system 
for oil and gas companies, allowing 
them to continue to put corporate prof-
its ahead of our air, water, climate, 
and health. 
At this pivotal moment in American 
history, it is not good enough to tinker 
around the edges. The scientific com-
munity has been very clear. If we do 
not act boldly and aggressively to 
transform our energy system away 
from fossil fuel and into energy effi-
ciency and sustainable energy, the fu-
ture of this planet is in doubt, and 
there is no question but that the Na-
tion and planet we leave to our chil-
dren and to our grandchildren will be 
increasingly unhealthy and uninhabit-
able. 
We have a major climate crisis and 
no trade deal should be passed that 
does not address that issue. 
In my view, we need to rewrite this 
trade agreement to stop the outsourc-
ing of American jobs, to combat cli-
mate change, to protect the environ-
ment, and to stop the destructive race 
to the bottom. 
We have to stop large, profitable cor-
porations that are outsourcing Amer-
ican jobs overseas from receiving lu-
crative Federal contracts. It makes no 
sense to me that you have large cor-
porations shut down in America, go to 
cheap labor countries abroad, and then 
they get online and receive very large 
Federal contacts. We have to stop that. 
Further, we have to repeal Trump’s 
tax giveaways to the wealthy, which 
have provided huge tax breaks to com-
panies that shut down manufacturing 
plants in the United States and move 
abroad. 
Trade is a good thing done well, but 
this trade agreement does not accom-
plish that end.

White House of our pending trial and 
summon the President to answer the 
articles and send his counsel. 
So the trial will commence in earnest 
on Tuesday. 
First, Mr. President, some important 
good news for the country. We antici-
pate the Senate will finish the USMCA 
tomorrow and send this landmark 
trade deal to President Trump for his 
signature. This is a major victory for 
the administration, but more impor-
tantly, for American families. 
Let me close with this: This is a dif-
ficult time for our country, but this is 
precisely the kind of time for which 
the Framers created the Senate. I am 
confident this body can rise above 
short-termism and factional fever and 
serve the long-term best interests of 
our Nation. We can do this, and we 
must. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

dered.

ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that all debate 
time on H.R. 5430 expire at 11 a.m. to-
morrow; further, that prior to the expi-
ration of debate time, it be in order for 
Senator TOOMEY, or his designee, to 
raise a budget point of order; and that 
if a point of order is raised, it be in 
order for Senator GRASSLEY, or his des-
ignee, to make a motion to waive the 
point of order. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, for 
the information of all Senators, this 
means we will have two rollcall votes 
tomorrow morning at 11 a.m. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate be in a period of morning business, 
with Senators permitted to speak for 
up to 10 minutes each.

objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to 
submit to the Senate the budget 
scorekeeping report for January 2020. 
This is my third scorekeeping report 
since I filed the deemed budget resolu-
tion for fiscal year 2020 on September 9, 
2019, as required by the Bipartisan 
Budget Act of 2019, BBA19. The report 
compares current-law levels of spend-
ing and revenues with the amounts 
agreed to in BBA19. In the Senate, this 
information 
is 
used 
to 
determine 
whether budgetary points of order lie 
against pending legislation. The Re-
publican staff of the Budget Committee 
and the Congressional Budget Office, 
CBO, prepared this report pursuant to 
section 308(b) of the Congressional 
Budget Act CBA. The information in-
cluded in this report is current through 
January 7, 2020. 
Since I filed the last scorekeeping re-
port on December 4, 2019, four measures 
with significant enforceable budgetary 
effects have been enacted. 
The first measure enacted this re-
porting period, H.R. 5363, the Fostering 
Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking 
Resources for Education Act, FUTURE 
Act, cleared the Senate by voice vote 
and became P.L. 116–91. The bill in-
cluded two provisions with significant 
cost over the 10-year period: a perma-
nent extension of mandatory funding 
for historically Black colleges and uni-
versities and additional mandatory 
funding for the Pell Grant program. To 
offset these provisions, the measure al-
lows the Department of Education to 
access taxpayer data when admin-
istering Federal student aid programs. 
Overall, CBO estimates that the FU-
TURE Act would reduce outlays by $997 
million in the first year, $835 million 
over 5 years, and $435 million over 10 
years. This measure was charged to the 
Health, Education, Labor and Pensions 
Committee. 
The second measure enacted this re-
porting period was the conference re-
port to accompany S. 1790, the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2020. This measure, which 
became P.L. 116–92 and was charged to 
the Armed Services Committee, au-
thorized appropriations for the Na-
tion’s national defense apparatus for 
the current fiscal year. In addition to 
the authorization of funds, the con-
ference report included changes in law, 
notably to the Survivor Benefit Pro-
gram, that would affect direct spending 
and revenues. According to CBO’s esti-
mate, the measure would increase di-
rect spending by $5.6 billion over the 
2020 to 2029 period. 
The third measure, H.R. 1158, the 
Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, 
became P.L. 116–93. This bill provided 
funding for fiscal year 2020 programs 
within the jurisdictions of four Senate 
appropriations subcommittees, includ-
ing 
Defense, 
Commerce-Justice- 
Science, Financial Services and Gen-
eral Government, and Homeland Secu-
rity. CBO estimated that the bill would 
bring total budget authority provided 
for programs covered by these four sub-
committees to $860.3 billion in fiscal 
year 2020. Of the amounts provided, 
$767.6 billion was considered regular ap-
propriations and $92.6 billion qualified 
for cap adjustments under existing law. 
The final measure with significant 
effects enacted this reporting period 
was H.R. 1865, the Further Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2020. This bill, 
which became P.L. 116–94, provided ap-
propriations for fiscal year 2020 for the 
remaining eight Senate appropriations 
subcommittees, extended numerous ex-
piring programs and tax provisions, re-
pealed several healthcare taxes, ex-
panded access to retirement plans, pro-
vided additional resources for pensions 
for miners, and contained several pro-
visions related to various foreign pol-
icy initiatives. CBO estimated that di-
visions A-H of the bill, which provided 
discretionary 
appropriations, 
would 
bring total appropriated budget au-
thority for covered programs to $539.9 
billion in fiscal year 2020. Of the 
amount provided, $520.4 billion was pro-
vided as regular appropriations and 
$19.5 billion qualified for cap adjust-
ments under existing law. CBO further 
estimated that divisions I—Q of the bill 
would increase deficits by $408.9 billion 
over the 2020 through 2029 period. Divi-
sions A—H were charged to the Appro-
priations Committee; divisions I and K 
were charged to the Banking Com-
mittee; division J was charged to the 
Foreign Relations Committee; division 
L was charged to the Homeland Secu-
rity and Governmental Affairs Com-
mittee; divisions M, N, O, and Q were 
charged to the Finance Committee; and 
division P was charged to the Com-
merce Committee. The measure passed 
the Senate by a vote of 71 to 23. 
Budget Committee Republican staff 
prepared tables A-D. 
Table A gives the amount by which 
each Senate authorizing committee ex-
ceeds or is below its allocation for 
budget authority and outlays under the 
fiscal year 2020 deemed budget resolu-
tion. This information is used for en-
forcing committee allocations pursu-
ant to section 302 of the CBA. Legisla-
tion enacted to date has resulted in six 
authorizing 
committees 
breaching 
their allocations provided by BBA19. In 
total 
authorizing 
committees 
have 
breached outlay limitations by more 
than $29.1 billion over the 2020 through 
2029 period. 
Table B provides the amount by 
which the Senate Committee on Appro-
priations is below or exceeds the statu-
tory spending limits. This information 
is used to determine points of order re-
lated to the spending caps found in sec-
tions 312 and 314 of the CBA. The table 
shows that the Appropriations Com-
mittee is compliant with spending lim-
its for current the fiscal year. Those 
limits for regular discretionary spend-
ing are $666.5 billion for accounts in the 
defense category and $621.5 billion for 
accounts in the nondefense category of 
spending. 
The 2018 budget resolution contained 
points of order limiting the use of 
changes 
in 
mandatory 
programs, 
CHIMPs, in appropriations bills. Table 
C, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15 
billion for 2020, shows the Appropria-
tions Committee has complied with the 
CHIMP limit for this fiscal year. 
CHIMPs enacted as part of the 2020 ap-
propriations cycle include $5.7 billion 
from changes to the Crime Victims 
Fund and $9.3 billion in changes to ac-
counts related to the Children’s Health 
Insurance Program.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S237 
January 15, 2020 
Table D provides the amount of budg-
et authority enacted for 2020 that has 
been designated as either for an emer-
gency or for overseas contingency oper-
ations pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) 
of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. 
Funding that receives either of these 
designations results in cap adjustments 
to enforceable discretionary spending 
limits. There is no limit on either 
emergency or overseas contingency op-
erations spending; however, any Sen-
ator may challenge the designation 
with a point of order to strike the des-
ignation on the floor. To date, more 
than $88.0 billion has been enacted with 
either the emergency or overseas con-
tingency operations designations for 
the 2020 appropriations cycle. 
In addition to the tables provided by 
Budget Committee Republican staff, I 
am submitting CBO tables, which I will 
use to enforce budget totals approved 
by Congress. 
CBO provided a spending and revenue 
report for 2020, table 1, which helps en-
force aggregate spending levels in 
budget resolutions under CBA section 
311. Following the enactment of the 
two minibus appropriations bills in De-
cember and the continued spending of 
authorizing committees, the current 
level is now in excess of allowable lev-
els by $15.4 billion for budget authority 
and $1.7 billion for outlays in 2020. De-
tails on 2020 levels can be found in 
CBO’s second table. 
Current-law revenues are currently 
below enforceable levels for all enforce-
ment periods. Due to the enactment of 
the Further Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2020, and to a lesser extent 
this year’s national defense authoriza-
tion bill, revenues are currently $34.4 
billion, $150.7 billion, and $386.2 billion 
lower than assumed in the deemed 
budget resolution for 2020, 2020 through 
2024, and 2020 through 2029, respec-
tively. Social Security spending levels 
are consistent with the budget resolu-
tion’s figures for 2020; however, Social 
Security revenue levels are $15 million 
below assumed levels. 
CBO’s report also provides informa-
tion needed to enforce the Senate pay- 
as-you-go, pay-go, rule table 3. This 
rule was established under section 4106 
of the 2018 budget resolution. The Sen-
ate pay-go scorecard currently shows a 
credit of $965 million in 2020 but deficit 
increases of $1.1 billion and $5.2 billion 
over the 2019–2024 and 2019–2029 periods, 
respectively. Please note that the def-
icit effects of division I through divi-
sion Q of the Further Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act, 2020 are excluded 
from the Senate’s pay-go scorecard 
pursuant to title X of division I of that 
law. 
This submission also includes a table 
tracking the Senate’s budget enforce-
ment activity on the floor since the en-
forcement filing on September 9, 2019. I 
raised two points of order during this 
reporting period. On December 17, 2019, 
I raised the long-term deficits point of 
order against the national defense au-
thorization conference report for in-
creasing deficits by more than $5 bil-
lion in years following the current 
budget window. That point of order was 
waived by a vote of 82 to 12. On Decem-
ber 19, 2019, I raised the same point of 
order against the Further Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2020, but that was 
also waived with a vote of 64 to 30. 
All years in the accompanying tables 
are fiscal years. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S238 
January 15, 2020 
U.S. CONGRESS, 
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, 
Washington, DC, January 15, 2020. 
Hon. MIKE ENZI, 
Chairman, Committee on the Budget, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The enclosed report 
shows the effects of Congressional action on 
the fiscal year 2020 budget and is current 
through January 7, 2020. This report is sub-
mitted under section 308(b) and in aid of sec-
tion 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, as 
amended. 
The estimates of budget authority, out-
lays, and revenues are consistent with the 
allocations, aggregates, and other budgetary 
levels printed in the Congressional Record on 
September 9, 2019, pursuant to section 204 of 
the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (Public 
Law 116–37). 
Since our last letter dated December 4, 
2020, the Congress has cleared and the Presi-
dent has signed the following legislation 
that has significant effects on budget au-
thority and outlays in fiscal year 2020: Fos-
tering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking 
Resources for Education Act (Public Law 
116–91); National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116–92); Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Public 
Law 116–93); and Further Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act, 2020 (Public Law 116–94). 
Sincerely, 
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL, 
Director.

a Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and 
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $567 million in budget authority and $798 million in estimated outlays. 
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in 
this current level report do not include those items. 
c Section 124 of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020 (division A of P.L. 116–59), appropriated funding for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (within the jurisdiction of the Subcommittee on Defense) and designated those 
amounts as funding for overseas contingency operations. That provision took effect upon enactment on September 27, 2019. 
d In consultation with the House and Senate Committees on the Budget and the Office of Management and Budget, rescissions of emergency funding that was not designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 
251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 shall not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes. These amounts, which are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:

e Section 204 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 requires the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget to publish the aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2020; those aggregate levels were first published 
in the Congressional Record on September 9, 2019. The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget has the authority to revise the budgetary aggregates for the budgetary effects of certain revenue and spending measures pursuant 
to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and H. Con. Res. 71 (115th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018, as updated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019.

BUDGET ENFORCEMENT LEVELS 
FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 251 
of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, 
establishes statutory limits on discre-
tionary spending and allows for various 
adjustments to those limits. In addi-
tion, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974 allow the 
chairman of the Budget Committee to 
establish and make revisions to alloca-
tions, aggregates, and levels consistent 
with those adjustments. 
The Senate will soon consider H.R. 
5430, 
United 
States-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement Implementation Act. This 
measure provides supplemental appro-
priations 
to 
implement 
the 
trade 
agreement that qualify for cap adjust-
ments under current statute. 
This measure includes $843 million in 
budget authority that is designated as 
being for emergency purposes pursuant 
to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. 
The entirety of this budget authority 
falls within the revised nonsecurity 
category. The Congressional Budget Of-
fice estimates that these appropria-
tions will result in $334 million in out-
lays in fiscal year 2020. 
As a result of the emergency designa-
tions, I am revising the budget author-
ity and outlay allocations to the Com-
mittee on Appropriations by increasing 
revised nonsecurity budget authority 
by $843 million and outlays by $334 mil-
lion in fiscal year 2020. Further, I am 
increasing the budgetary aggregate for 
fiscal year 2020 by equivalent amounts. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustment, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA 
TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, in addi-
tion to my strong and unequivocal sup-
port for the USMCA, I note that my 
committee is about to undertake a 
yearlong review of the Digital Millen-
nium Copyright Act, with the goal of 
modernizing it. 
Back in 1998, the internet was still a 
fledgling industry, so much so that it 
is difficult to recall a time when email 
was a novel form of communication 
and you could go take a coffee break in

hopes that the web page you wanted 
would have fully loaded on your com-
puter by the time you returned. It was 
in this era that the DMCA attempted 
to strike a reasonable balance between 
content creators and the operators of 
online billboards. The DMCA offered 
immunity to new, emerging platforms 
in exchange for reasonable enforce-
ment efforts, including quickly taking 
down 
copyrighted 
materials 
they 
learned about violations. In 1998, there 
were 
no 
iPhones. 
There 
was 
no 
Facebook and no YouTube. Netflix 
opened that year as a mail-order DVD 
store. For a time, the DMCA worked. 
President Trump has led the way to 
establish a new paradigm for trade 
agreements that protect American in-
terests, and the USMCA provides for 
long overdue updates to NAFTA, but 
the mechanisms of the DMCA to deter 
copyright infringement need to be up-
dated. Technology has changed faster 
than anyone could have ever imagined, 
and the existing DMCA simply isn’t 
able to address these new develop-
ments. The original DMCA was simply 
not designed for the kind of global data 
and advertising platforms that we have 
seen develop over time. As is so often 
the case, the technology has outpaced 
the law. 
I intend to hold a series of hearings 
this year to explore whether the DMCA 
needs updating in order to promote the 
creative economy in the 21st century. 
This work is critical to North Carolina 
jobs in the creative sector. For exam-
ple, the motion picture and television 
industry is directly responsible for 
more than 19,000 jobs in North Caro-
lina, representing more than $1 billion 
in wages in the State. Productions like 
the series ‘‘Reprisal’’ and the upcoming 
film Uncle Frank were made in North 
Carolina in 2019. The good, high-wage 
jobs in the film and television indus-
try, from directors, musicians, and ac-
tors, to drivers, makeup artists, paint-
ers, and set decorators, are at risk if 
the products they make lose money 
due to internet theft. 
Without prejudging what changes 
may be necessary to the DMCA, it is 
important that our future trade agree-
ments can keep up with the advances 
of U.S. copyright law. I look forward to 
working together with my colleagues 
in the House and Senate and with the 
White House to ensure we improve the 
DMCA and create more export opportu-
nities for U.S. businesses and workers 
in the process. As always, our trade 
agreements and our copyright law 
should do all they can to create good 
incentives and empower market forces 
to solve problems. 
Mr. President, I applaud the inclu-
sion of national treatment language in 
this agreement, requiring nondiscrim-
inatory treatment of American cre-
ators and their goods. 
This protects many American goods, 
of course, but I want to make special 
note that the inclusion of this provi-
sion in USMCA will help undo one par-
ticular instance of discrimination/un-
fair treatment against American cre-
ators. It will help ensure that Amer-
ican music creators are fairly com-
pensated when their recordings are 
played in Canada and Mexico. 
Our expectation is that American 
performers will see an increase in roy-
alty compensation as a result. As it 
stands today, Canadian artists receive 
all royalties due under U.S. law for the 
use of sound recordings here. Those 
royalties totaled nearly a billion dol-
lars last year for all recordings. 
We afford the recordings of all for-
eign nationals with the same rights 
due for the recordings of American art-
ists. In Canada, however, royalties col-
lected for radio airplay and other non-
digital public performances of sound 
recordings made by Americans cur-
rently are NOT shared with the Amer-
ican performers who create them. 
I encourage the administration to en-
sure inclusion of this protection for 
American creators in all trade agree-
ments going forward. American music 
is by far the most listened to in the 
world, and we should do all we can to 
ensure our American music creators 
are treated fairly by our trade part-
ners.

RECOGNIZING THE UNITED 
STATES COAST GUARD 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
rise today to commend the Coast 
Guard men and women who serve in 
Kodiak, AK, a designated Coast Guard 
City. On February 7, Kodiak’s Chamber 
of Commerce will hold a community- 
wide celebration called ‘‘We Applaud 
You.’’ I want to take a moment to join 
in applauding the Coast Guard as a 
whole and all the Coast Guard per-
sonnel serving in Alaska, but espe-
cially those based in Kodiak who help 
make our great State a safe place to 
live and work. 
Kodiak is a robust Coast Guard City: 
it is homeport for three cutters, fifteen 
aircraft, a communications detach-
ment, the North Pacific Regional Fish-
eries Training Center, the Aids to 
Navigation Team, and of course, Base 
Kodiak. Each of these components 
serve and protect Alaskans on a daily 
basis, and I would like to highlight 
some particularly important examples 
of their contributions and service to 
Alaska. 
Personnel from the Marine Safety 
Detachment in Kodiak helped oversee 
and coordinate multiple pollution re-
sponses on Kodiak Island last year, in-
cluding responding to a diesel spill in 
the Buskin River, and a separate spill 
of Fuel Oil at Kitoi Bay Hatchery. The 
Marine Safety Detachment’s prompt 
actions and clean-up expertise helped 
keep the island of Kodiak’s rivers and 
coastline beautiful and safe. My sin-
cere thanks to Marine Safety Detach-
ment Kodiak. 
On New Year’s Eve, the search and 
rescue team, including Air Station Ko-
diak and the Coast Guard Cutter Mel-
lon responded to a sinking fishing ves-
sel, the F/V Scandies Rose. The crews 
faced 40-knot winds, 15–30 foot seas and 
significantly reduced visibility at the 
scene of the sinking. The search and 
rescue team successfully recovered two 
survivors from a life raft but the five 
remaining crew members were lost. My 
heart goes out to the families and 
friends of those lost at sea. The crew of 
the Scandies Rose is in my prayers; this 
accident has hit especially close to 
home for Kodiak, which is a tight-knit 
fishing community, as well as a Coast 
Guard City. 
As we mourn the loss of the Scandies 
Rose, we are incredibly grateful for the 
efforts of the Coast Guard to rescue the 
survivors in the face of extremely dan-
gerous conditions. We see these type of 
heroic actions in movies, but the Coast 
Guard in Alaska operates in dangerous, 
life-threatening conditions every day 
in order to keep Alaskans safe. To the 
entire search and rescue team, we ap-
plaud you, and Alaska thanks you. 
Now, I also want to sincerely thank 
Base Kodiak, the home of ‘‘Rock Solid 
Support.’’ Your work behind the scenes 
provides the foundation for all of the 
ready and responsive work done by 
those on the front lines. You truly are 
the rock solid support that keeps 
things moving, whether it is the med-
ical and dental clinics keeping over a 
thousand people healthy; the Morale 
Welfare and Recreation team keeping 
the crew happy and energized—and in 
shape—the personnel support staff who 
recently completed a 5-year effort to 
increase salaries and close a long over-
due pay gap for wage grade members 
across Alaska; or the facilities engi-
neering department, who have im-
proved living conditions for Kodiak’s 
most junior Coast Guard members by 
converting housing units to allow two 
single members to share them. 
It is so important to me that our jun-
ior Coast Guard men and women are 
able to enjoy improved housing ar-
rangements while away from home, 
maybe for the first time. Maybe they 
will be so comfortable in Kodiak that 
they want to come back to Alaska and 
call it home. I applaud all 450 personnel 
of Base Kodiak who keep the Coast 
Guard operations going. 
Finally, I want to take a minute to 
speak to the contributions and sac-
rifice of our Coast Guard families, part-
ners, and spouses. So much of the de-
manding work that our Coast Guard

men and women do each day is made 
possible by the love and support of 
their families. This is especially true 
when additional burdens are placed on 
Coast Guard personnel, like we experi-
enced this time last year, when the 
Coast Guard was left unpaid during the 
35-day government shutdown. Here in 
Congress, I will continue to work with 
Senator Sullivan to pass the Pay Our 
Coast Guard Act, which will ensure 
that a lapse in pay from a government 
shutdown never happens again. Our 
Coast Guard families deserve nothing 
less. 
Thank you to the Kodiak Chamber of 
Commerce for their work to honor our 
Coast Guard members in Alaska. I ap-
plaud you as well for your support for 
those who serve and for taking the 
time to say thank you and well done to 
our Coast Guard Family.

20TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
NEW 
HAMPSHIRE’S FIRST MARTIN LU-
THER KING JR. DAY CELEBRA-
TION 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today in observance of the 20th anni-
versary of New Hampshire’s first Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. Day. After legisla-
tion was enacted the previous summer, 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day in the year 
2000 was the culmination of a years- 
long struggle to add Dr. King’s name to 
the State’s official Civil Rights Day 
holiday. I ask my colleagues and all 
Americans to join me in celebrating 
this recognition of such an influential 
figure and saluting the men and women 
who prompted this important and per-
manent change. 
This anniversary is personal for me. I 
fought alongside so many when I 
served in the New Hampshire State 
Senate for an appropriate way to honor 
Dr. King, the preeminent leader of the 
civil rights movement. Years later, as 
Governor, I was proud to sign the bill 
into law that ended New Hampshire’s 
status as the only State not to recog-
nize his birthday as an official holiday. 
There were setbacks leading up to that 
triumphant June day, including many 
failed votes in the State legislature; 
yet with a sense of resilience typical of 
the movement that Dr. King inspired, 
we persevered and kicked off the new 
millennium in the Granite State by 
celebrating our first Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day on January 17, 2000. 
It was an exciting time that reflected 
the positive change that many of us 
had seen in our lifetimes. As a child 
growing up in southern Missouri and 
attending segregated schools, I saw the 
daily injustices of life under Jim Crow 
segregation. 
We 
have 
made 
great 
strides since then in the march toward 
full equality, and these advancements 
are the product of Dr. King’s leadership 
and the peaceful, nonviolent protest 
movements that he championed. 
Whether writing from inside a jail 
cell or speaking from the steps of the 
Lincoln Memorial, Dr. King delivered a 
stirring message with hope that Ameri-
cans could come together and fully re-
alize one of our country’s founding 
principles, that all are created equal. 
He pledged himself and inspired others 
to work toward a more perfect union 
and embrace a belief in freedom and 
opportunity for all. He held a faith 
that engaged citizens—from the thou-
sands who stood with him on the Na-
tional Mall in 1963 to the many who 
worked tirelessly years later to estab-
lish a holiday in his name—are the 
most powerful promoters of positive so-
cial and economic change. 
One of those engaged citizens was 
Rev. Dr. Arthur Hilson of New Hope 
Baptist Church in Portsmouth, NH. A 
beacon of wisdom and grace, Reverend 
Hilson was instrumental in garnering 
the public support to establish Martin 
Luther King Jr. Day. He understood 
that the people we choose to revere can 
send a powerful message to future gen-
erations and that the lifework and 
message of Dr. King must be a part of 
the heritage we leave to our children. 
We lost Reverend Hilson last year, but 
we still hold on to cherished memories 
of a man who, when asked how he was 
doing, would always answer, ‘‘Too 
blessed to complain.’’ We are all 
blessed to have known such a loving 
neighbor, determined activist and liv-
ing embodiment of Dr. King’s teach-
ings. 
On behalf of the people of New Hamp-
shire, I ask my colleagues and all 
Americans to join in celebrating Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day and in rec-
ognizing Reverend Hilson who was so 
dedicated to building Dr. King’s ‘‘Be-
loved Community’’ of justice, equality 
and love for all.

RECOGNIZING INDIANA WOMEN’S 
SUFFRAGE CENTENNIAL 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I rise to 
formally recognize an important event 
that will be occurring in my home 
State of Indiana this week. 
On Thursday, January 16, the Indiana 
Women’s Suffrage Centennial Commis-
sion will be hosting a celebration at 
the Indiana Statehouse to commemo-
rate the 100th anniversary of Indiana 
ratifying the 19th Amendment. More-
over, the Indiana General Assembly 
will present a resolution honoring this 
historic milestone and the Hoosiers 
who led the way to ensure equal rep-
resentation for women in their govern-
ment. 
As we celebrate the anniversary, it is 
important we acknowledge that the 
record of Hoosiers seeking equal voting 
rights for women goes back to the 
1850s, when Amanda Way, a Winchester 
native, organized the Indiana Woman’s 
Rights Association and called for its 
first convention. This act of passionate 
leadership was just the beginning of a 
generation-spanning story of deter-
mination, 
sacrifice, 
and 
advocacy. 
Countless women and men followed in 
Amanda’s footsteps and continued to 
campaign for the betterment of their 
society and government. Nearly 70 
years later, these Hoosiers’ tireless ef-
forts led to Indiana becoming the 26th 
State in the Union to ratify the 19th 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, 
prohibiting States from denying the 
right to vote on the basis of sex. 
The centennial of women’s suffrage is 
an opportunity to highlight Indiana’s 
leadership in uniting communities, 
tearing down barriers to better rela-
tionships, and promoting representa-
tive governance. On behalf of all Hoo-
siers, I wish Indiana continued success 
as it commemorates and recognizes a 
proud history of supporting equality 
and constitutional freedom.

TRIBUTE TO DR. JAMES J. 
NARAMORE 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the outstanding career 
of Dr. James J. Naramore. For over 40 
years, Jim Naramore dedicated his life 
to caring for the people of Campbell 
County. 
Born and raised in Gillette, he is a 
graduate of Campbell County High 
School. He earned an undergraduate 
degree from John Brown University 
and earned his medical degree from the 
University of Utah. He completed his 
training in family medicine at the Uni-
versity of Nebraska. 
Gillette was fortunate when Dr. 
Naramore came home in 1978 for a tem-
porary position in the emergency de-
partment at Campbell County Memo-
rial Hospital. He returned permanently 
in 1980 and spent the rest of his career 
practicing at Family Health in Gil-
lette, while also serving on the medical 
staff of the hospital. 
In addition, Dr. Naramore understood 
the importance of helping others enter 
the medical profession. Throughout his 
career, he taught and mentored the 
next generation of Wyoming physi-
cians. He served as an instructor for 
the Department of Human Medicine at

the University of Wyoming Family 
Practice residency, a preceptor for the 
Creighton University School of Medi-
cine, and a preceptor for the physician 
assistant training program for both 
Creighton University and the Univer-
sity of Washington. He has also been 
active in teaching emergency medical 
technician 
classes. 
Finally, 
Dr. 
Naramore also has served as president 
of the Campbell County Medical Soci-
ety, as well as serving on the Physician 
Advisory Council to the Wyoming 
Board of Medicine. 
For Dr. Naramore, practicing family 
medicine in Gillette was more than a 
profession. As a Gillette native, he un-
derstood the importance of giving back 
to his community. Throughout his ca-
reer, he dedicated countless hours to 
making a real difference in his home-
town. Dr. Naramore participated in the 
Gillette 
Area 
Leadership 
Institute, 
served on the board of directors of the 
Campbell County Chamber of Com-
merce, and was president of the Razor 
City Toast Masters. 
Finally, Dr. Naramore has served as 
president of Campbell County Medical 
Society, as well as serving on the Phy-
sician Advisory Council to the Wyo-
ming Board of Medicine. In addition, 
he held numinous positions at Camp-
bell County Memorial Hospital, includ-
ing chairman of the Bylaws Com-
mittee, chief of the Family Practice 
Department, chief of the Department 
of Medicine, a member of the Creden-
tials Committee, the Critical Care 
Committee. 
Most 
importantly 
he 
served as the hospital’s chief of staff. 
In 2019, Campbell County Healthcare 
Foundation recognized Jim’s contribu-
tions 
with 
their 
Outstanding 
Healthcare Award. Certainly, Jim’s 
years of service to the health of Gil-
lette and Campbell County made him 
an outstanding choice for this honor. 
With that being said, Jim Naramore 
is most proud of his outstanding fam-
ily. His wife Karen has been at his side 
for over 47 years. Together they raised 
four children: Lindsay, Marissa, Jes-
sica, and Marcus. Now they are enjoy-
ing their six grandchildren. 
Mr. President, it is my honor to rec-
ognize the outstanding career of Dr. 
James Naramore. Wyoming is fortu-
nate to have physicians like Jim who 
go above and beyond to improve the 
health of their community.

House of Representatives, delivered by 
Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, an-
nounced that pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 
629(b), and the order of the House of 
January 3, 2019, the Speaker appoints 
the following individuals to the Board 
of the Federal Judicial Center Founda-
tion on the part of the House of Rep-
resentatives for a term of 5 years: Ms. 
Elizabeth J. Cabraser of Sebastopol, 
California and Mr. Peter A. Kraus of 
Dallas, Texas. 
At 5:36 p.m., a message from the 
House of Representatives, delivered by 
Ms. Johnson, the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives, announced that the 
House 
of 
Representatives 
has 
im-
peached for high crimes and mis-
demeanors Donald John Trump, Presi-
dent of the United States; the House of 
Representatives adopted articles of im-
peachment 
against 
Donald 
John 
Trump, which the managers on the 
part of the House of Representatives 
have been directed to carry to the Sen-
ate; and Mr. SCHIFF, Mr. NADLER, Ms. 
LOFGREN, Mr. JEFFRIES, Mrs. DEMINGS, 
Mr. CROW, and Ms. GARCIA of Texas, 
have been appointed such managers. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION 755, IN THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES, DECEMBER 18, 2019 
Resolved, That Donald John Trump, Presi-
dent of the United States, is impeached for 
high crimes and misdemeanors and that the 
following articles of impeachment be exhib-
ited to the United States Senate: 
Articles of impeachment exhibited by the 
House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in the name of itself and 
of the people of the United States of Amer-
ica, against Donald John Trump, President 
of the United States of America, in mainte-
nance and support of its impeachment 
against him for high crimes and mis-
demeanors. 
ARTICLE I: ABUSE OF POWER 
The Constitution provides that the House 
of Representatives ‘‘shall have the sole 
Power of Impeachment’’ and that the Presi-
dent ‘‘shall be removed from Office on Im-
peachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, 
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’. In his conduct of the office of 
President of the United States—and in viola-
tion of his constitutional oath faithfully to 
execute the office of President of the United 
States and, to the best of his ability, pre-
serve, protect, and defend the Constitution 
of the United States, and in violation of his 
constitutional duty to take care that the 
laws 
be 
faithfully 
executed—Donald 
J. 
Trump has abused the powers of the Presi-
dency, in that: 
Using the powers of his high office, Presi-
dent Trump solicited the interference of a 
foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 
United States Presidential election. He did 
so through a scheme or course of conduct 
that included soliciting the Government of 
Ukraine to publicly announce investigations 
that would benefit his reelection, harm the 
election prospects of a political opponent, 
and influence the 2020 United States Presi-
dential election to his advantage. President 
Trump also sought to pressure the Govern-
ment of Ukraine to take these steps by con-
ditioning official United States Government 
acts of significant value to Ukraine on its 
public announcement of the investigations. 
President Trump engaged in this scheme or 
course of conduct for corrupt purposes in 
pursuit of personal political benefit. In so 
doing, President Trump used the powers of 
the Presidency in a manner that com-
promised the national security of the United 
States and undermined the integrity of the 
United States democratic process. He thus 
ignored and injured the interests of the Na-
tion. 
President Trump engaged in this scheme or 
course of conduct through the following 
means: 
(1) President Trump—acting both directly 
and through his agents within and outside 
the United States Government—corruptly 
solicited the Government of Ukraine to pub-
licly announce investigations into— 
(A) a political opponent, former Vice Presi-
dent Joseph R. Biden, Jr.; and 
(B) a discredited theory promoted by Rus-
sia alleging that Ukraine—rather than Rus-
sia—interfered in the 2016 United States 
Presidential election. 
(2) With the same corrupt motives, Presi-
dent 
Trump—acting 
both 
directly 
and 
through his agents within and outside the 
United States Government—conditioned two 
official acts on the public announcements 
that he had requested— 
(A) the release of $391 million of United 
States taxpayer funds that Congress had ap-
propriated on a bipartisan basis for the pur-
pose of providing vital military and security 
assistance to Ukraine to oppose Russian ag-
gression and which President Trump had or-
dered suspended; and 
(B) a head of state meeting at the White 
House, which the President of Ukraine 
sought to demonstrate continued United 
States 
support 
for 
the 
Government 
of 
Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. 
(3) Faced with the public revelation of his 
actions, President Trump ultimately re-
leased the military and security assistance 
to the Government of Ukraine, but has per-
sisted in openly and corruptly urging and so-
liciting Ukraine to undertake investigations 
for his personal political benefit. 
These actions were consistent with Presi-
dent Trump’s previous imitations of foreign 
interference in United States elections. 
In all of this, President Trump abused the 
powers of the Presidency by ignoring and in-
juring national security and other vital na-
tional interests to obtain an improper per-
sonal political benefit. He has also betrayed 
the Nation by abusing his high office to en-
list a foreign power in corrupting democratic 
elections. 
Wherefore President Trump, by such con-
duct, has demonstrated that he will remain a 
threat to national security and the Constitu-
tion if allowed to remain in office, and has 
acted in a manner grossly incompatible with 
self-governance and the rule of law. Presi-
dent Trump thus warrants impeachment and 
trial, removal from office, and disqualifica-
tion to hold and enjoy any office of honor, 
trust, or profit under the United States. 
ARTICLE II: OBSTRUCTION OF CONGRESS 
The Constitution provides that the House 
of Representatives ‘‘shall have the sole 
Power of Impeachment’’ and that the Presi-
dent ‘‘shall be removed from Office on Im-
peachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, 
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’. In his conduct of the office of 
President of the United States—and in viola-
tion of his constitutional oath faithfully to 
execute the office of President of the United 
States and, to the best of his ability, pre-
serve, protect, and defend the Constitution 
of the United States, and in violation of his 
constitutional duty to take care that the 
laws 
be 
faithfully 
executed—Donald 
J. 
Trump has directed the unprecedented, cat-
egorical, and indiscriminate defiance of sub-
poenas issued by the House of Representa-
tives pursuant to its ‘‘sole Power of Im-
peachment’’. President Trump has abused 
the powers of the Presidency in a manner of-
fensive to, and subversive of, the Constitu-
tion, in that: 
The House of Representatives has engaged 
in an impeachment inquiry focused on Presi-
dent Trump’s corrupt solicitation of the 
Government of Ukraine to interfere in the 
2020 United States Presidential election. As 
part of this impeachment inquiry, the Com-
mittees 
undertaking 
the 
investigation 
served subpoenas seeking documents and tes-
timony deemed vital to the inquiry from var-
ious Executive Branch agencies and offices, 
and current and former officials. 
In response, without lawful cause or ex-
cuse, President rump directed Executive

Branch agencies, offices, and officials not to 
comply with those subpoenas. President 
Trump thus interposed the powers of the 
Presidency against the lawful subpoenas of 
the House of Representatives, and assumed 
to himself functions and judgments nec-
essary to the exercise of the ‘‘sole Power of 
Impeachment’’ vested by the Constitution in 
the House of Representatives. 
President Trump abused the powers of his 
high office through the following means: 
(1) Directing the White House to defy a 
lawful subpoena by withholding the produc-
tion of documents sought therein by the 
Committees. 
(2) Directing other Executive Branch agen-
cies and offices to defy lawful subpoenas and 
withhold the production of documents and 
records from the Committees—in response to 
which the Department of State, Office of 
Management and Budget, Department of En-
ergy, and Department of Defense refused to 
produce a single document or record. 
(3) Directing current and former Executive 
Branch officials not to cooperate with the 
Committees—in response to which nine Ad-
ministration officials defied subpoenas for 
testimony, namely John Michael ‘‘Mick’’ 
Mulvaney, 
Robert 
B. 
Blair, 
John 
A. 
Eisenberg, Michael Ellis, Preston Wells Grif-
fith, Russell T. Vought, Michael Duffey, 
Brian McCormack, and T. Ulrich Brechbuhl. 
These actions were consistent with Presi-
dent Trump’s previous efforts to undermine 
United States Government investigations 
into foreign interference in United States 
elections. 
Through these actions, President Trump 
sought to arrogate to himself the right to de-
termine the propriety, scope, and nature of 
an impeachment inquiry into his own con-
duct, as well as the unilateral prerogative to 
deny any and all information to the House of 
Representatives in the exercise of its ‘‘sole 
Power of Impeachment’’. In the history of 
the Republic, no President has ever ordered 
the complete defiance of an impeachment in-
quiry or sought to obstruct and impede so 
comprehensively the ability of the House of 
Representatives to investigate ‘‘high Crimes 
and Misdemeanors’’. This abuse of office 
served to cover up the President’s own re-
peated misconduct and to seize and control 
the power of impeachment—and thus to nul-
lify a vital constitutional safeguard vested 
solely in the House of Representatives. 
In all of this, President Trump has acted in 
a manner contrary to his trust as President 
and subversive of constitutional government, 
to the great prejudice of the cause of law and 
justice, and to the manifest injury of the 
people of the United States. 
Wherefore; President Trump, by such con-
duct, has demonstrated that he will remain a 
threat to the Constitution if allowed to re-
main in office, and has acted in a manner 
grossly incompatible with self-governance 
and the rule of law. President Trump thus 
warrants impeachment and trial, removal 
from office, and disqualification to hold and 
enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit 
under the United States. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION 798, IN THE HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES, JANUARY 15, 2020 
Resolved, That Mr. Schiff, Mr. Nadler, Ms. 
Lofgren, Mr. Jeffries, Mrs. Demings, Mr. 
Crow, and Ms. Garcia of Texas are appointed 
managers to conduct the impeachment trial 
against Donald John Trump, President of the 
United States, that a message be sent to the 
Senate to inform the Senate of these ap-
pointments, and that the managers so ap-
pointed may, in connection with the prepara-
tion and the conduct of the trial, exhibit the 
articles of impeachment to the Senate and 
take all other actions necessary, which may 
include the following: 
(1) Employing legal, clerical and other nec-
essary assistants and incurring such other 
expenses as may be necessary, to be paid 
from amounts available to the Committee on 
the Judiciary under applicable expense reso-
lutions or from the applicable accounts of 
the House of Representatives. 
(2) Sending for persons and papers, and fil-
ing with the Secretary of the Senate, on the 
part of the House of Representatives, any 
pleadings, in conjunction with or subsequent 
to, the exhibition of the articles of impeach-
ment that the managers consider necessary.

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–175. A resolution adopted by the Gen-
eral Assembly of the State of New Jersey 
urging the United States Congress and the 
President of the United States to enact legis-
lation prohibiting airlines from counting 
breast milk or breast pumps against the air-
line’s carry-on limit and prohibiting airlines 
from restricting passengers from carrying 
breast milk onto the aircraft; to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation. 
ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION NO. 244 
Whereas, More than 80 percent of mothers 
breastfeed their infants during the first six 
months of the child’s life; and 
Whereas, No matter what they are doing or 
where they are, breastfeeding mothers need 
to express milk every few hours in order to 
keep up their milk supply and to prevent in-
fection known as mastitis; and 
Whereas, On October 5, 2018, the President 
of the United States signed into law a five- 
year reauthorization of the Federal Aviation 
Administration, which included language 
that requires airports to provide lactation 
rooms that are accessible to the public; and 
Whereas, In spite of this federal law and 
laws in all 50 states that specifically allow 
breastfeeding in any public or private loca-
tion, breastfeeding mothers have continued 
to face barriers, even harassment, when 
breastfeeding or attempting to breastfeed in 
public places; and 
Whereas, The Transportation Security Ad-
ministration (TSA) permits breast pumps 
and breast milk for infants or toddlers in 
reasonable quantities to pass through the se-
curity checkpoint in airports; and 
Whereas, TSA also permits ice packs, 
freezer packs, frozen gel packs, and other ac-
cessories required to cool breast milk to pass 
through the security checkpoint in airports; 
and 
Whereas, In spite of these TSA policies, 
some airlines still prevent passengers from 
carrying breast milk onto aircraft or prevent 
breastfeeding mothers from carrying breast 
pumps onto aircraft by counting breast 
pumps against the airline’s carry-on limits; 
and 
Whereas, There is no federal law that pro-
hibits an airline from counting breast milk 
or breast pumps against the airline’s carry- 
on limit or restricting passengers from car-

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. REED (for himself and 
Mr. KENNEDY): 
S. 3198. A bill to authorize a pilot 
program to expand and intensify sur-
veillance of self-harm in partnership 
with State and local public health de-
partments, to establish a grant pro-
gram to provide self-harm and suicide 
prevention services in hospital emer-
gency departments, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, as we all 
know too well rates of suicide have 
risen to epidemic levels in the United 
States, with suicide now the 10th lead-
ing cause of death in the country. On 
average, there are 129 suicides every 
day, roughly one every 11 minutes—a 
staggering statistic. That is why I am 
pleased to be introducing bipartisan, 
bicameral legislation to provide new 
resources to help turn the tide on this 
increasingly dire situation. I am joined 
in introducing the Suicide Prevention 
Act by Senator KENNEDY, with Rep-
resentatives CHRIS STEWART and DORIS 
MATSUI introducing companion legisla-
tion in the House of Representatives. 
This legislation would authorize new 
funding for the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, CDC, to part-
ner with the State and local health de-
partments to improve surveillance of 
suicide attempts and other incidences 
of self-harm. Current data collection 
efforts regarding suicide are often 
years after the fact, which limits the 
ability of State and local health de-
partments, as well as community orga-
nizations, to recognize trends early and 
intervene. This new effort would en-
hance data collection and sharing, as 
appropriate, in real time to help save 
lives. 
Recognizing 
that 
emergency 
healthcare 
providers 
are 
at 
the 
frontlines of responding to suicide at-
tempts, this bill would authorize fund-
ing for a grant program within the 
Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration, SAMHSA, to 
fund suicide prevention programs in 
emergency departments, ED, to better 
train staff in suicide prevention strate-
gies, screen at-risk patients, and refer 
patients to appropriate followup care. 
The legislation would also require 
SAMHSA to develop best practices for 
such programs, so that healthcare pro-
viders are able to provide their pa-
tients with the best possible care and 
advice. Approximately 37 percent of in-
dividuals without a previous history of 
mental health or substance abuse who 
die by suicide make an ED visit within 
the year before their death. According 
to the Suicide Prevention Resource 
Center, the risk of suicide is greatest 
within a month of discharge from the 
hospital. 
In 2017, 47,173 Americans lost their 
lives to suicide. That same year, there 
were 1.4 million suicide attempts. We 
must renew our efforts on suicide pre-
vention. In 2004, working with my col-
league Senator GORDON SMITH of Or-
egon, we authored the Garrett Lee 
Smith Memorial Act. This law author-
ized new youth suicide prevention pro-
grams in honor of Senator SMITH’s, 
son, who tragically died by suicide just 
a couple of weeks short of his 22nd 
birthday. For over a decade, these pro-
grams have funded college campus, 
State, and Tribal efforts to prevent sui-
cide among our youth and young adult 
populations, who are particularly at 
risk of suicide. During this time, youth 
suicide rates have decreased signifi-
cantly in my home State of Rhode Is-
land, 
however, 
nationwide, 
suicide 
rates have skyrocketed over the last 
decade. That is why we must renew our 
attention and focus on suicide preven-
tion, including by increasing funding 
for and access to the National Suicide 
Prevention Lifeline. This effort is crit-
ical to ensuring that when people in 
crisis call looking for help, someone 
will be there on the other end of the 
line to offer hope and counseling. I 
have also worked with my colleagues 
Senators 
GARDNER, 
BALDWIN, 
and 
MORAN on legislation to designate the 
Lifeline as an easy to remember, 3- 
digit number, 9-8-8. This common sense 
legislation would make it easier for 
people across the country to access the 
Lifeline when they really need it. I am 
glad 
the 
Federal 
Communications 
Commission, FCC, taking steps to 
make the 9-8-8 number a reality, which 
makes increasing funding for the Life-
line all the more vital. 
I am pleased to have the opportunity 
to partner with Senator KENNEDY once 
again by introducing the Suicide Pre-
vention Act today. I look forward to 
working together with our other spon-
sors and colleagues, as well as stake-
holders supporting these efforts, to 
pass this critical legislation.

PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE THAT THE PRESIDENT 
AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE 
SHOULD 
ENSURE 
THAT 
THE 
GOVERNMENT OF CANADA DOES 
NOT PERMANENTLY STORE NU-
CLEAR WASTE IN THE GREAT 
LAKE BASIN 
Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. 
PETERS, Ms. BALDWIN, Mr. BROWN, Mr. 
DURBIN, Ms. DUCKWORTH, Mrs. GILLI-
BRAND, and Ms. KLOBUCHAR) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 470 
Whereas the water resources of the Great 
Lakes Basin are precious public natural re-
sources shared by the Great Lakes States 
and the Provinces of Canada; 
Whereas, since 1909, the United States and 
Canada have worked to maintain and im-
prove the water quality of the Great Lakes 
through water quality agreements; 
Whereas more than 40,000,000 individuals in 
both Canada and the United States depend 
on the fresh water from the Great Lakes for 
drinking water; 
Whereas Ontario Power Generation is pro-
posing to build a permanent deep geological 
repository for nuclear waste less than 1 mile 
from Lake Huron in Kincardine, Ontario, 
Canada; 
Whereas the Government of Canada is pro-
posing to build a permanent deep geological 
repository for high-level nuclear waste in the 
Great Lakes Basin; 
Whereas nuclear waste is highly toxic and 
can take tens of thousands of years to de-
compose to safe levels; 
Whereas a spill of nuclear waste into the 
Great Lakes, including during transit to a 
permanent deep geological repository for nu-
clear waste, could have lasting and severely 
adverse environmental, health, and eco-
nomic impacts on the Great Lakes and the 
individuals who depend on the Great Lakes 
for their livelihoods; 
Whereas more than 187 local, county, 
State, and Tribal governments have passed 
resolutions in opposition to the proposed nu-
clear waste repository of Ontario Power Gen-
eration; 
Whereas Tribes and First Nations’ citizens 
have a strong spiritual and cultural connec-
tion to the Great Lakes; 
Whereas the protection of the Great Lakes 
is fundamental to treaty rights; and 
Whereas, during the 1980s, when the De-
partment of Energy was studying potential 
sites for a permanent nuclear waste reposi-
tory in the United States in accordance with 
the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (42 
U.S.C. 10101 et seq.), the Government of Can-
ada expressed concern with locating a per-
manent nuclear waste repository within 
shared water basins of the 2 countries: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the Government of Canada should not 
allow a permanent nuclear waste repository 
to be built within the Great Lakes Basin; 
(2) the President and the Secretary of 
State should take appropriate action to 
work with the Government of Canada to pre-
vent a permanent nuclear waste repository 
from being built within the Great Lakes 
Basin; and 
(3) the President and the Secretary of 
State should work together with their coun-
terparts in the Government of Canada on a 
solution for the long-term storage of nuclear 
waste that— 
(A) is safe and responsible; and 
(B) does not pose a threat to the Great 
Lakes.

(2) religious freedom was established by 
the founders of the United States ‘‘in law, as 
a fundamental right and as a pillar of our 
Nation’’; 
Whereas the role of religion in society and 
public life in the United States has a long 
and robust tradition; 
Whereas individuals who have studied the 
democracy of the United States from an 
international perspective, such as Alexis de 
Tocqueville, have noted that religion plays a 
central role in preserving the Government of 
the United States because religion provides 
the moral base required for democracy to 
succeed; 
Whereas, in Town of Greece v. Galloway, 
134 S. Ct. 1811 (2014), the Supreme Court of 
the United States affirmed that ‘‘people of 
many faiths may be united in a community 
of tolerance and devotion’’; 
Whereas the principle of religious freedom 
‘‘has guided our Nation forward’’, as ex-
pressed by the 44th President of the United 
States in a Presidential proclamation on Re-
ligious Freedom Day in 2011, and freedom of 
religion ‘‘is a universal human right to be 
protected here at home and across the 
globe’’, as expressed by that President of the 
United States on Religious Freedom Day in 
2013; 
Whereas ‘‘[f]reedom of religion is a funda-
mental human right that must be upheld by 
every nation and guaranteed by every gov-
ernment’’, as expressed by the 42nd President 
of the United States in a Presidential procla-
mation on Religious Freedom Day in 1999; 
Whereas the First Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States protects— 
(1) the right of individuals to freely express 
and act on the religious beliefs of those indi-
viduals; and 
(2) individuals from coercion to profess or 
act on a religious belief to which those indi-
viduals do not adhere; 
Whereas ‘‘our laws and institutions should 
not impede or hinder but rather should pro-
tect and preserve fundamental religious lib-
erties’’, as expressed by the 42nd President of 
the United States in remarks accompanying 
the signing of the Religious Freedom Res-
toration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.); 
Whereas, for countless people of the United 
States, faith is an integral part of every as-
pect of daily life and is not limited to the 
homes, houses of worship, or doctrinal creeds 
of those individuals; 
Whereas ‘‘religious faith has inspired many 
of our fellow citizens to help build a better 
Nation’’ in which ‘‘people of faith continue 
to wage a determined campaign to meet 
needs and fight suffering’’, as expressed by 
the 43rd President of the United States in a 
Presidential proclamation on Religious Free-
dom Day in 2003;

S250 
January 15, 2020 
Whereas, ‘‘[f]rom its birth to this day, the 
United States has prized this legacy of reli-
gious freedom and honored this heritage by 
standing for religious freedom and offering 
refuge to those suffering religious persecu-
tion’’, as noted in section 2(a) of the Inter-
national Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 
U.S.C. 6401(a)); 
Whereas Thomas Jefferson wrote— 
(1) in 1798 that each right encompassed in 
the First Amendment to the Constitution of 
the United States is dependent on the other 
rights described in that Amendment, ‘‘there-
by guarding in the same sentence, and under 
the same words, the freedom of religion, of 
speech, and of the press: insomuch, that 
whatever violated either, throws down the 
sanctuary which covers the others’’; and 
(2) in 1822 that the constitutional freedom 
of religion is ‘‘the most inalienable and sa-
cred of all human rights’’; 
Whereas religious freedom ‘‘has been inte-
gral to the preservation and development of 
the United States’’, and ‘‘the free exercise of 
religion goes hand in hand with the preserva-
tion of our other rights’’, as expressed by the 
41st President of the United States in a Pres-
idential proclamation on Religious Freedom 
Day in 1993; and 
Whereas we ‘‘continue to proclaim the fun-
damental right of all peoples to believe and 
worship according to their own conscience, 
to affirm their beliefs openly and freely, and 
to practice their faith without fear or in-
timidation’’, as expressed by the 42nd Presi-
dent of the United States in a Presidential 
proclamation on Religious Freedom Day in 
1998: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), That Congress— 
(1) on Religious Freedom Day on January 
16, 2020, honors the 234th anniversary of the 
enactment of the Virginia Statute for Reli-
gious Freedom; and 
(2) affirms that— 
(A) for individuals of any faith and individ-
uals of no faith, religious freedom includes 
the right of an individual to live, work, asso-
ciate, and worship in accordance with the be-
liefs of the individual; 
(B) all people of the United States can be 
unified in supporting religious freedom, re-
gardless of differing individual beliefs, be-
cause religious freedom is a fundamental 
human right; and 
(C) ‘‘the American people will remain for-
ever unshackled in matters of faith’’, as ex-
pressed by the 44th President of the United 
States in a Presidential proclamation on Re-
ligious Freedom Day in 2012.

UNITED STATES-MEXICO 
ECONOMIC PARTNERSHIP ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 336, H.R. 133. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 133) to promote economic part-
nership and cooperation between the United 
States and Mexico. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Foreign Relations, with an amend-
ment to strike all after the enacting 
clause and insert in lieu thereof the 
following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United States- 
Mexico Economic Partnership Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The United States and Mexico have bene-
fitted from a bilateral, mutually beneficial part-
nership focused on advancing the economic in-
terests of both countries. 
(2) In 2013, Mexico adopted major energy re-
forms that opened its energy sector to private in-
vestment, increasing energy cooperation be-
tween Mexico and the United States and open-
ing new opportunities for United States energy 
engagement. 
(3) On January 18, 2018, the Principal Deputy 
Assistant Secretary for Educational and Cul-
tural Affairs at the Department of State stated, 
‘‘Our exchange programs build enduring rela-
tionships and networks to advance U.S. na-
tional interests and foreign policy goals . . . 
The role of our exchanges . . . in advancing 
U.S. national security and economic interests 
enjoys broad bipartisan support from Congress 
and other stakeholders, and provides a strong 
return on investment.’’. 
(4) According to the Institute of International 
Education, in the 2015–2016 academic year, more 
than 56,000 United States students studied in 
other countries in the Western Hemisphere re-
gion while more than 84,000 non-United States 
students from the region studied in the United 
States, but only 5,000 of those United States stu-
dents studied in Mexico and only 16,000 of those 
non-United States students were from Mexico. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to continue deepening economic coopera-
tion between the United States and Mexico; 
(2) to seek to prioritize and expand edu-
cational and professional exchange programs 
with Mexico, including through frameworks 
such as the 100,000 Strong in the Americas Ini-
tiative, the Young Leaders of the Americas Ini-
tiative, Jo´venes en Accio´n (Youth in Action), 
the Fulbright Foreign Student Program, and the 
Fulbright Visiting Scholar Program; and 
(3) to promote positive cross-border relations 
as a priority for advancing United States for-
eign policy and programs.

EDUCATIONAL AND PROFESSIONAL 
EXCHANGE PROGRAMS WITH MEX-
ICO. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of State shall 
develop a strategy to carry out the policy de-
scribed in section 3, to include prioritizing and 
expanding educational and professional ex-

(b) ELEMENTS.—The strategy required under 
subsection (a) shall— 
(1) encourage more academic exchanges be-
tween the United States and Mexico at the sec-
ondary, post-secondary, and post-graduate lev-
els;

demic institutions and businesses to collaborate 
to assist prospective and developing entre-
preneurs in strengthening their business skills 
and promoting cooperation and joint business 
initiatives across the United States and Mexico; 
(3) promote energy infrastructure coordina-
tion and cooperation through support of voca-
tional-level education, internships, and ex-
changes between the United States and Mexico; 
and 
(4) assess the feasibility of fostering partner-
ships between universities in the United States 
and medical school and nursing programs in 
Mexico to ensure that medical school and nurs-
ing programs in Mexico have comparable ac-
creditation standards as medical school and

REAFFIRMING THE SUPPORT OF 
THE UNITED STATES FOR THE 
PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF 
SOUTH SUDAN AND CALLING ON 
ALL PARTIES TO UPHOLD THEIR 
COMMITMENTS TO PEACE AND 
DIALOGUE AS OUTLINED IN THE 
2018 REVITALIZED PEACE AGREE-
MENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 338, S. Res. 371. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the resolution by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 371) reaffirming the 
support of the United States for the people of 
the Republic of South Sudan and calling on 
all parties to uphold their commitments to 
peace and dialogue as outlined in the 2018 re-
vitalized peace agreement. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution, 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, with an 
amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part 
printed in italic and an amendment to 
the preamble to strike the preamble 
and insert the part printed in italic: 
Whereas the people and Government of the 
United States have a deep and abiding interest 
in South Sudan’s democratic development and 
post-conflict stabilization; 
Whereas the United States was a critical part-
ner in the drafting and implementation of the 
2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement that laid 
the groundwork for the 2011 referendum on self- 
determination, through which the people of 
South Sudan overwhelmingly voted for inde-
pendence; 
Whereas the United States recognized South 
Sudan as a sovereign, independent state on July 
9, 2011; 
Whereas, since the onset of the civil war in 
South Sudan in December 2013, nearly 400,000 
South Sudanese citizens are estimated to have 
been killed, 1,900,000 have been internally dis-
placed, and 2,300,000 have fled the country and 
registered as refugees; 
Whereas violence erupted in Juba in July 2016 
and spread throughout the country in violation 
of the August 17, 2015, Agreement on the Resolu-
tion of the Conflict in the Republic of South 
Sudan (ARCSS); 
Whereas the Revitalized Agreement on the 
Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of 
South Sudan (R-ARCSS), signed on September 
12, 2018, affirmed the Parties’ commitment to the 
permanent ceasefire, humanitarian access, and 
respect for human rights, and established two 
phases of implementation, an 8-month Pre- 
Transitional Period followed by a 36 month 
Transitional Period that includes the establish-
ment of a Revitalized Transitional Government 
of National Unity (RTGoNU), and calls for elec-
tions 60 days prior to the end of the Transi-
tional Period to establish a democratic govern-
ment; 
Whereas the R-ARCSS stipulates that the sig-
natories will create an enabling political, ad-
ministrative, operational, and legal environment 
for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and 
civilian protection; 
Whereas two extensions to the deadline to 
form the RTGoNU have been granted to allow 
additional time to complete critical Pre-Transi-
tional tasks, including agreement on the number 
and boundaries of states and important security 
arrangements; 
Whereas the United States Department of 
State 2018 Country Report on Human Rights 
Practices in South Sudan states that both the 
government and opposition forces engaged in se-
rious human rights abuses by perpetrating 
extrajudicial killings, including ethnically based 
targeted killings of civilians, and by engaging in 
arbitrary detentions, torture, rape, beatings, 
and looting of property; 
Whereas, on March 15, 2019, the United Na-
tions Security Council extended the mandate of 
the United Nations Mission in South Sudan 
(UNMISS) for one year and authorized UNMISS 
to use all necessary means to deter violence 
against civilians, to prevent and respond to sex-
ual and gender-based violence, and to foster a 
secure environment for the return or relocation 
of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refu-
gees; 
Whereas the people of South Sudan continue 
to suffer from a humanitarian crisis, despite 
over $4,500,000,000 in United States humani-
tarian aid provided since the conflict began, 
with more than half the population experi-
encing acute food insecurity at the peak of the 
lean season in 2019, and humanitarian organi-
zations are providing more than 5,300,000 people 
with lifesaving assistance and other vital sup-
port services, such as medical care to survivors 
of sexual violence and facilitating access to edu-
cation to over 690,000 children; 
Whereas South Sudan has been at the lowest 
tier of the Department of State’s Trafficking in 
Persons rankings since 2015, indicating that its 
government does not fully meet the minimum 
standards for the elimination of trafficking and 
is not making significant efforts to do so; 
Whereas impunity for past atrocities, corrup-
tion, and capture of key sectors of the national 
economy, such as the oil and mining sectors, 
continues to drive violence in South Sudan, and 
signatories to the R-ARCSS committed to the es-
tablishment of transitional justice and economic 
and resource management measures; 
Whereas the United Nations Security Council 
adopted resolution 2471 on May 30, 2019, to ex-
tend its sanctions regime in South Sudan and 
renew the prohibition of the supply, sale, or 
transfer to South Sudan of arms and related 
material or the provision of training, technical, 
and financial assistance related to military ac-
tivities or materials until May 31, 2020; and 
Whereas peace and security in South Sudan is 
critical to peace and security in East Africa: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, 
That the Senate— 
(1) supports a sustainable peace and democ-
racy in South Sudan; 
(2) calls on the incumbent government and all 
other signatories of the R-ARCSS to— 
(A) take concrete and meaningful steps to cre-
ate an enabling environment, to include security 
arrangements for Juba and the unification of 
forces, for all relevant stakeholders to partici-
pate actively in the formation of the RTGoNU 
and South Sudan’s democratic development and 
post-conflict stabilization; 
(B) take immediate action to resolve peace-
fully the remaining political issues for negotia-
tion during the Pre-Transitional Period, includ-
ing agreement on the number and boundaries of 
states; 
(C) adhere to the cessation of hostilities and 
ensure humanitarian access; 
(D) immediately release all political prisoners 
and fulfill their responsibility to protect civil-
ians; 
(E) ensure respect for the right to freedom of 
expression, association, and peaceful assembly; 
and 
(F) cease recruitment and immediately release 
all child soldiers under the command or influ-
ence of the South Sudan People’s Defense 
Forces (SSPDF) and its associated militias; 
(3) calls on heads of state of member countries 
of the Intergovernmental Authority on Develop-
ment in East Africa to engage South Sudanese 
leaders and parties to uphold their commitments 
to the peace agreement, including maintaining 
the cease-fire, to make good-faith progress to-
ward peacefully forming the RTGoNU, and to 
resolve other key issues; 
(4) calls on the Secretary of State and the Ad-
ministrator of the United States Agency for 
International Development (USAID) to— 
(A) intensify bilateral and multilateral diplo-
matic efforts to demonstrate the commitment of 
the United States to helping achieve a perma-
nent and sustainable peace in South Sudan on 
par with its commitment to ameliorate the suf-
fering of the South Sudanese people; 
(B) elevate and consult additional voices in 
South Sudan to broaden the constituency and 
shared responsibility for maintaining peace and 
fulfilling the commitments of the Pre-Transi-
tional and Transitional periods; and 
(C) continue to support civilians, particularly 
women and children, who have been adversely 
affected by the civil war, and provide assistance 
to meet humanitarian needs and support 
peacebuilding, conflict prevention, transitional 
justice, and reconciliation efforts led by local 
civil society; 
(5) urges the Secretary of State and the 
United States Permanent Representative to the 
United Nations to monitor implementation of the 
UNMISS mandate authorized by United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 2459 (2019) and en-
sure that any return or relocation of IDPs from 
United Nations Protection of Civilian sites are 
safe, informed, voluntary, dignified, and con-
ducted in coordination with humanitarian ac-
tors; 
(6) urges the Secretary of State, in conjunc-
tion with the Secretary of the Treasury to con-
tinue to monitor human rights abuses and cor-
ruption in South Sudan and take decisive action 
using authorities granted under the Global 
Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act

RECOGNIZING THE NORTH DAKOTA 
STATE UNIVERSITY BISON FOOT-
BALL TEAM 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to talk about the North Dakota 
State University Bison football team, 
and I am really excited to be able to do 
that. Last weekend, the Bison capped 
another impressive football season by 
winning their eighth FCS national title 
in 9 years. The Bison broke their own 
record for the most FCS titles of all 
time, eight in the last 9 years—an un-
believable accomplishment. 
They have now won 16 NCAA football 
championships. NDSU just had a truly 
impressive team this year, and they 
just have a tremendous program, as 
they have demonstrated year after 
year. 
I had the chance to be in Frisco last 
weekend with Bison Nation. They have 
an incredible following. We call them 
‘‘Bison Nation’’ because they go wher-
ever the football team goes, and they 
make a lot of noise. I had the oppor-
tunity to be there with them and cheer 
on the team as they faced off against 
James Madison University, the Dukes. 
It was a hard-fought win for the Bison, 
and the Dukes should also be congratu-
lated. They have a great program—a 
first-class program—and great fans. I 
talked to a lot of them. They could not 
have been not only more supportive of 
their team, but they could not have 
been more complimentary of the Bison 
and their great program. Again I just 
want to say: James Madison, a real 
great program and a real class act— 
their team, their program, and their 
fans. Kudos to them as well. 
It was just a great effort by our team 
all around. Just a few stats: The win by 
the Bison on Saturday capped off an 
unbeaten season of 16–0. That is the 
first time a Division I team has gone 
16–0, unbeaten, since Yale did it in 
1894—pretty 
remarkable, 
a 
pretty 
amazing accomplishment. 
You also have to realize that that 
brings their current winning streak to 
37 consecutive games, so they finished 
the year unbeaten, and they are now up 
to a 37-game winning streak. 
Next year, the second game of the 
season, we go to Oregon and play Or-
egon at Oregon. That should be a really 
exciting game. It just shows the caliber 
of football this team plays and just 
how great these student athletes are. 
They are great young men as well. I am 
very pleased that I was joined by my 
colleague Senator CRAMER
in spon-
soring this resolution, so I certainly 
want to express my appreciation to 
him as well. 
We recognize and we congratulate 
the players, including freshman quar-
terback Trey Lance, who became the 
first player in the history of the North 
Dakota State Bison football team and 
the first freshman player in history— 
the first freshman player—to win the 
Walter Payton Award. It is the first 
time a freshman has ever done so, 
which just shows you what a great 
player he is and is just indicative of 
the kind of athletes we have on that 
team. 
We want to congratulate and honor 
the whole team. It was truly a team ef-
fort, a great team, led by Coach Matt

Entz and his staff. This is Matt Entz’s 
first year as head coach—what a way 
to start off for Matt and what a great 
guy and what a great coach. Also, the 
athletic director, Matt Larsen, again, 
just runs a class program of not only 
football but all of the athletics at 
North Dakota State University, as well 
as, of course, the fine leadership of 
NDSU president Dean Bresciani at the 
university there, a good friend and 
somebody who has done a great job 
leading the university. 
Again, I also want to honor Bison Na-
tion. The game was nationally tele-
vised on Saturday at noon eastern time 
here on ABC. It wasn’t just our great 
team; it was Bison Nation, all the fans 
being there and showing up in such a 
great way, too, with not only wearing 
the green and yellow and Bison regalia 
but cheering and just doing a great job 
like Bison Nation always does. 
We are so proud of the program, so 
proud of the student athletes, the 
coaches, and Bison Nation as a whole. 
We want to congratulate everybody on 
another incredible year and an unbe-
lievable achievement: eight champion-
ships in 9 years. 
With that, there is only one other 
thing to say: Go Bison. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HOEVEN). The Senator from North Da-
kota. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE NORTH DAKOTA 
STATE UNIVERSITY BISON FOOT-
BALL TEAM 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I thank 
the President for yielding the floor and 
thank you for your previous speech. It 
is a great honor for me to follow the 
senior Senator from North Dakota, 
Senator HOEVEN, in congratulating this 
remarkable, singular accomplishment 
by this remarkable, singular football 
team: the North Dakota State Univer-
sity Bison. 
Senator HOEVEN did a great job of 
highlighting the highlights of this sin-
gularly great team as, last weekend, 
they did win their eighth out of nine 
FCS national championships; that is, 
NCAA Division I Football Champion-
ship Subdivision. 
He went through the statistics that 
are very impressive: the stretch of 37 
victories in a row; the 16–0 season; the 
singular 
accomplishment 
of 
Trey 
Lance, this redshirt freshman from 
Marshall, MN, who threw, by the way, 
in the course of the season, 29 touch-
down passes and a grand total of 0 
interceptions—remarkable to say the 
least. He was just named, in fact, the 
2019 FCS National Performer of the 
Year. 
Senator HOEVEN paid tribute appro-
priately 
to 
Coach 
Entz. 
Senator 
HOEVEN is exactly right—an incredible 
individual; an incredible, undefeated 
head coach. Not only was he named the 
Missouri Valley coach of the year, he 
was just named the AFCA FCS coach of 
the year—a tremendous person. 
We can talk about all the great 
things that the Bison football team 
does, and it is appropriate that we do 
that and that we celebrate them in 
North Dakota and Fargo and the region 
and all of Bison Nation, as Senator 
HOEVEN said. There is something they 
don’t do that I appreciate so much. I 
watched the game on ABC, as we have 
watched lots of football games lately 
on the national networks, and the one 
thing they don’t do that I love is they 
never point to the name on the back of 
their jersey because they don’t put 
their names on the backs of the jerseys 
because this is always a team effort. 
This is a legacy of a team. It is a cul-
ture of a team. It is the equality of a 
team. As great as every performer is, 
they are a team. That is the way they 
win; and, if they ever lose, that is the 
way they lose, but they don’t do that 
much. 
They really have defined—redefined— 
excellence, but their excellence doesn’t 
end on the field. I don’t think it should 
surprise anybody to learn of a few 
other statistics of North Dakota State 
University. For example, just last year, 
for just the second time in our Division 
I history, all NDSU athletic teams 
reached a cumulative grade point aver-
age of 3.0. Let me say that again: All 
NDSU athletic teams reached a cumu-
lative grade point average of 3.0 or 
greater, while also achieving our high-
est overall student athlete GPA of 3.43. 
Over 280 student athletes at NDSU 
scored a 3.0 or better, with 72—72—of 
their student athletes receiving a 4.0— 
earning, I should say, a 4.0. 
As you can tell, Senator HOEVEN and 
I are proud Senators. We are proud of 
our team. We are proud of our univer-
sity. We are proud of the entire univer-
sity system in our State for lots of rea-
sons. I think what the excellence of the 
North Dakota State University foot-
ball team has illustrated is an excel-
lence that can be achieved and can be 
applied not only to the gridiron, not 
only to the fields of athletic competi-
tion, but to life. As the Presiding Offi-
cer knows, their motto is that the 
strength of the herd is in the bison and 
the strength of the bison is in the herd. 
It is a good lesson in athletics and a 
good lesson in life. 
I join Senator HOEVEN in congratu-
lating the Bison. 
Go Bison. 
I yield the floor.

HONORING LUKE BROWN 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Luke Brown. 
Luke is a very special young man who has ex-
emplified the finest qualities of citizenship and 
leadership by taking an active part in the Boy 
Scouts of America, Troop 314, and earning 
the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Luke has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Luke has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Luke 
has contributed to his community through his 
Eagle Scout project. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Luke Brown for his accom-
plishments with the Boy Scouts of America 
and for his efforts put forth in achieving the 
highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

REMEMBERING DR. ROOSEVELT J. 
STALLINGS 
HON. RICK W. ALLEN 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
remember the life of Dr. Roosevelt J. Stallings. 
Ron was a remarkable man who served his 
country for 15 years as a Lt. Colonel in the 
U.S. Army. He continued to serve his fellow 
Americans as a successful physician for three 
decades. 
Ron was a trailblazer in the medical field, 
reaching many great milestones and being the 
recipient of many distinguished awards. He 
was the first African American to graduate 
from the University of South Carolina School 
of Pharmacy as well as being one of the first 
African American surgical oncologists in the 
world. 
While he will be deeply missed, especially 
by his beloved family, his legacy will live on 
through the lives he touched as a mentor to 
the youth in the community and as a leader in 
his church. 
Ron’s passion for service has made our 
community a better place and should serve as 
an inspiration to us all.

HONORING THE LOUISIANA STATE 
UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL TEAM 
HON. STEVE SCALISE 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate the Louisiana State University 
football team for winning the 2020 College 
Football Playoff National Championship. On 
January 13, 2020, the undefeated LSU Tigers 
took to the field as the No. 1 ranked team in 
all of college football and defeated the defend-
ing National Champions and No. 3 ranked 
Clemson Tigers by 42–25 in the Louisiana Su-
perdome. The LSU Tigers displayed deter-
mination and explosiveness throughout this 
entire historic season, never taking their foot 
off of the gas and beating an unprecedented 
seven Top-10 teams during their ascent to a 
perfect 15–0 record. 
The Fighting Tigers, led by Louisiana-native, 
Coach Ed Orgeron, amassed impressive indi-
vidual, team, school, and conference records 
on their march to the championship. LSU is 
the first team in Southeastern Conference his-
tory to go 15–0. The Tigers are also the first 
team to ever beat each of the top four teams 
in the AP preseason poll. Their high-flying, No. 
1 offense was led by Quarterback Joe Burrow, 
the 2019 Heisman Trophy Winner, who also 
set the record for the most total touchdowns 
by a player in a single season. Wide Receiver 
Ja’Marr Chase, winner of the 2019 Biletnikoff 
award and graduate of my alma mater 
Rummel High School, set the record for the 
most receiving yards in a BCS/CFP national 
championship game with 221 yards and two 
touchdowns. Coach Orgeron, winner of the 
Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year award and 
famously known as ‘‘Coach Oeaux,’’ fearlessly 
led his men throughout this magical season 
with the motto ‘‘One team, one heartbeat.’’ 
This national championship is LSU’s fourth 
in school history, and it is perfectly fitting that 
the championship game was held only an hour 
away from campus in the great City of New 
Orleans. The 2019 LSU Tigers have staked 
their claim as one of the all-time best teams 
in the history of college football. And Heisman- 
winner Joe Burrow just finished one of the 
greatest seasons played by a college quarter-
back. 
As Coach O said, this is a team for the 
ages and they have made the entire State of 
Louisiana very proud. Geaux Tigers.

THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
DEPUTY WARDEN ROBERT F. BO-
LOGNA 
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the service of Deputy Warden of 
the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office’s Correc-
tions Division, Robert F. Bologna, as he cul-
minates 28 years serving our community with 
the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Office. 
Beginning his civil service career with the 
Sheriff’s Office in January of 1992 as a Cor-
rection Officer, Officer Bologna went above 
and beyond the call of duty, quickly rising 
through the ranks thanks to his unparalleled 
skill set and leadership. 
Promoted to Deputy Warden in 2016, he 
commanded correctional facilities in Yaphank 
and Riverhead, responsible for several hun-
dred law enforcement officers, the safety of 
thousands of individuals in the custody of the 
Sheriff and the safety and security of commu-
nities across Long Island. 
From his time as a United States Navy Op-
erations Specialist in the Persian Gulf to his 
time serving in the Suffolk County Sheriff’s Of-
fice, Deputy Warden has never hesitated to 
put the safety of his fellow Long Islanders 
above his own. 
On behalf of our entire community and na-
tion, I thank Deputy Warden Bologna for his 
service and wish him the best in his well- 
earned retirement.

HONORING STEPHEN THOMAS 
COVINGTON 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
my constituent, Stephen Thomas Covington, 
who passed away on December 21, 2019. 
Steve was an incredible activist who sought to 
better our community from the ground up. 
With his creativity, innovation, and entrepre-
neurship, Steve worked to fulfill his vision to 
positively impact the community of Hemet. 
As the owner of the Downtown Deli & Cof-
fee Company, Steve sought to rebuild Hemet’s 
historic Downtown District. Since the Down-
town Deli opened its doors in 2014, it quickly 
became a local favorite and neighborhood 
landmark, as well as one ofmy favorite lunch 
spots. With Steve’s passion for his community 
and his excellence in his craft, he fostered a 
warm and welcoming atmosphere that cele-
brated Hemet’s history and culture. 
Steve’s presence in the community tran-
scended the Downtown Deli. As a board mem-
ber of the City of Hemet’s Traffic Commission, 
Steve served as a local leader committed to 
uplifting Hemet. He constantly gave of himself 
to better the lives of his neighbors as he 
worked with numerous local community initia-
tives, such as the Ramona Bowl and Tinsel 
Triathlon and the restoration of Hemet’s His-
toric Theater. 
A devoted family man, Steve was known for 
his passion, honesty, and loyalty by friends 
and loved ones. As the Hemet community 
grieves his loss, my heart is with wife Karen, 
his mother Diana, and grandparents Tom and 
Sally. Steve’s legacy will be felt for years to 
come, and his memory will live on in the 
hearts of the lives he touched.

Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, Cen-
tral Virginia is home to some of the most com-
munity-centered and service-minded students 
in the country, and today I am fortunate to rec-
ognize one of these students as a recipient of 
the Congressional Award. 
Anneliese Mabie, a constituent of mine from

for her work in community service, personal 
development, physical fitness, and exploration 
of the world around her. 
Anneliese’s community service centered on 
volunteering for Four County Players, a com-
munity theater in my district. She ensured the 
productions ran smoothly by serving as a 
spotlight operator, sound board operator, as-
sistant stage manager, and stage manager. 
Anneliese has demonstrated an ability to set 
goals, make a strategy, and see it through to 
the end. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Anneliese 
on her accomplishments. I look forward to 
seeing how she will continue contributing to 
our Seventh District communities in the future.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
PRO-
MOTING NATIONAL SERVICE AND 
REDUCING UNEMPLOYMENT ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to introduce the Promoting National Service 
and Reducing Unemployment Act to address 
one of the greatest workforce tragedies result-
ing from today’s economy—our unemployed 
young people—and to spur economic growth 
and to alleviate strain on state and local gov-
ernments. This tragedy is not only harming our 
young people, but it is also costing our gov-
ernment billions of dollars each year in lost 
productivity, lost tax revenue and other costs. 
Although total unemployment has reached a 
relative low (3.5 percent), the unemployment 
rate for young people is eight percent. These 
young people have not had a fair chance to 
use the high school or college education we 
strongly urged them to obtain. 
What is particularly disappointing, particu-
larly in today’s low unemployment economy, is 
the high unemployment rate for young people 
who heeded our advice to graduate from high 
school and college. The total unemployment 
rate is currently eight percent for people 16 to 
24 years old, 4.5 points higher than the overall 
employment rate, and hundreds of thousands 
of them now compete for unpaid internships 
wherever they can find them. By significantly 
expanding AmeriCorps, my bill would need no 
new administrative structure or bureaucracy 
but would allow unemployed young people to 
earn a stipend, obtain work experience and 
develop a good work history to help secure fu-
ture employment. The net cost of the expan-
sion would be low because these young peo-
ple would be providing urgently needed local 
services that are being eliminated or curtailed 
because of state and local budget cuts, such 
as after-school programs, tutoring and assist-
ance for the elderly. 
The bill would significantly expand job op-
portunities for young people who have done 
what they could to enter into the job market, 
but, despite their best efforts, remain unem-
ployed in this economy. AmeriCorps partici-
pants receive a living allowance and are also 
eligible for an education award equal to the 
value of a Pell grant, school-loan forbearance, 
health care benefits and child care assistance. 
By expanding AmeriCorps, we would reduce 
the number of unemployed young people, pro-
vide them with work skills and experience and 
help cash-strapped state and local govern-
ments provide services that they would other-
wise have to cut or eliminate altogether. 
For some time, it has been clear that poli-
cies to address the most stubborn forms of 
unemployment need to be targeted in order to 
be effective. Without significant targeting, 
many young graduates will continue to face 
their first years as adults without jobs and with 
no way to acquire necessary work experience. 
They deserve a better start in life as adults. I 
ask my colleagues to support this urgently 
needed, targeted assistance for young, unem-
ployed Americans. 
IN HONOR OF THE LIFE OF LILIJA 
GRUMULAITIS 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor the remarkable life of Lilija Grumulaitis 
and recognize her unwavering dedication to 
her community and causes closest to her 
heart. 
Although a devoted American, Lilija was not 
born in the United States. Born on February 
15, 1938 in Marijampole, Lithuania, Lilija mi-
grated to Germany and Australia before calling 
America home. Her journey began during 
World War II when Russian forces attacked 
Lithuanian cities—making it impossible to live 
peacefully under communist rule. In 1944, her 
family sought refuge in Berlin, Germany for 
four weeks. At the young age of six, Lilija viv-
idly recalls uttering her first words in English to 
an America soldier at a refugee camp in Wies-
baden, Germany, ‘‘Thank you for my free-
dom.’’ Lilija’s family dreamed of moving to 
America—where she could practice faith and 
support candidates freely—but at the time, her 
family had the option to safely relocate to Aus-
tralia through the United Nations Relief and 
Rehabilitation Administration (UNRAA). 
Many years later, Lilija was able to fulfill her 
dream to come to America when she married 
Leonas Grumulaitis. In 1958, the couple ar-
rived at Ellis Island in New York. The pair 
would go on to live in New Jersey, Illinois and 
Florida before making their permanent home 
in Conroe, Texas in 1979. It was in Texas 
where Lilija would establish a lifelong legacy 
of service. Seeing a need for representation, 
Lilija helped establish several civic organiza-
tions and was an honorary member of Rotary 
Club Lake Conroe. With a strong sense of 
civic duty, she went on to be a strong sup-
porter of both President Reagan and President 
George H.W. Bush. She was entrusted to 
gather diverse crowds and encourage others 
to use their freedom to vote. 
One of Lilija’s proudest moments was on 
July 26, 1972—the day she became a U.S. 
citizen. For decades after obtaining her citi-
zenship, the joy of liberty never left her, once 
stating how inexpressible it was to see the 
Statue of Liberty years later. Anyone who 
knows her, knows she never failed to take ad-
vantage of the opportunity to thank veterans 
for her freedom as she had done as a six- 
year-old in Germany. For years, she ex-
pressed her gratitude through Christmas cards 
to over 200 veterans each year and was a 
guardian on two of the Lone Star Honors 
Flights. Lilija is a remarkable patriot and ex-
ample of how we can best serve our commu-
nity. 
While we mourn with Lilija’s family, we also 
celebrate the life, service, and legacy that will 
live throughout our community. I am proud to 
join her family, friends, and the Eighth District 
of Texas in honoring her life and steadfast de-
votion to the United States of America. 
HONORING AVERY DOGGETT 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Avery Doggett. 
Avery is a very special young man who has 
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship 
and leadership by taking an active part in the 
Boy Scouts of America, Troop 314, and earn-
ing the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Avery has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Avery has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Avery 
has contributed to his community through his 
Eagle Scout project. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Avery Doggett for his ac-
complishments with the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica and for his efforts put forth in achieving the 
highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
2020 
NA-
TIONAL 
CATHOLIC 
SCHOOLS 
WEEK 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, today, I rec-
ognize Catholic schools and parishes in our 
nation as we celebrate National Catholic 
Schools Week. As we approach this celebra-
tion, I am excited to announce that this year’s 
theme is ‘‘Catholic School: Learn, Serve, 
Lead, Succeed’’ which resonates with my Dis-
trict which is home to thirty-five Catholic 
schools. Parochial education strives to instill 
faith, community involvement, and commit-
ment in the classroom to shape each genera-
tion of students into well-educated, compas-
sionate members of our communities. For 
forty-six years, Catholic schools have taken 
part in this tradition, which provides a time to 
reflect on and commemorate their contribu-
tions to education. 
Due to the National Catholic Educational 
Association’s (NCEA) leadership, 99.2 percent 
of all students at Catholic schools graduate 
high school and 86.2 percent go on to four- 
year college. The NCEA’s legacy of success is 
a testament to the quality education and guid-
ance through faith that each student receives 
through their time in Catholic schools. 
As a proud graduate of St. Anne Grade 
School in East Moline, Illinois and Spalding 
Catholic High School in Peoria, Illinois, I am 
honored to co-sponsor legislation supporting 
National Catholic Schools Week. The religious 
values and foundation of faith instilled through 
Catholic schools guides my daily life and con-
tinues to strengthen my relationship with God. 
My wife and I are thankful that our three sons 
have the opportunity to attend Catholic 
schools, allowing them to be immersed in the 
Catholic faith, endure a quality education, and 
participate in community service. 
During National Catholic Schools Week, I 
extend my sincere blessings to Catholic

to reflect and celebrate on all the contributions 
that the National Catholic Education Associa-

our communities. I look forward to continuing 
to support Catholic schools and carrying out 
God’s mission of faith, service, and knowl-
edge.

TRIBUTE TO TOM WILSON PAGE, 
JR. 
HON. DENVER RIGGLEMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, today I 
wish to observe and mourn the passing of 
Tom Wilson Page, Jr. who was called home 
unexpectedly this past week. A devoted hus-
band, father, grandfather, and friend, Tom was 
a pillar of our Nelson County community and 
his loss will be felt throughout our district. 
A small business owner, Tom was always 
ready to lend a helping hand to anyone who 
needed it. His passion and love of community 
were evident in where he spent his time; at his 
church and on the baseball field. Tom was an 
instrumental part of the Nelson County Youth 
Baseball Association, where he mentored 
young players and taught them the fundamen-
tals of the pastime he loved. 
He leaves behind his beloved wife of 43 
years, Esther W. Page; his sons, Prennis 
‘‘Lamonte’’ Page and Brandon S. Page; and 
two grandchildren. I join all of Nelson County 
in mourning his loss, and extend my thoughts, 
prayers, and deepest sympathies to the Page 
family.

CONGRATULATING CHIEF DANIEL 
STEERE ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. BILL HUIZENGA 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the exemplary career of 
Daniel Steere, Chief of Police at the Grandville 
City Police Department. I would like to express 
my appreciation to Chief Steere for over 37 
years of dedicated services to West Michigan 
and our nation. 
Chief Steere’s career in law enforcement 
began in 1982 when he entered the Tampa 
Police Department Recruit Academy. After 
graduation, he quickly rose to become a Field 
Training Officer. Wanting to be closer to fam-
ily, he moved back to Michigan in 1985, and 
soon after, found his professional home in the 
Grandville Police Department. In 1989, Chief 
Steere became the department’s first vice de-
tective and later would serve as the depart-
ment’s first officer assigned to a collaborative 
drug team. 
In 1993, Dan was promoted to Sergeant 
and was tasked with overseeing the training 
program for new officers. Beginning in 1996, 
he became the department’s Detective Ser-
geant and served in that position until his ele-
vation to Deputy Chief in 2008. He served with 
distinction as Deputy Chief until being pro-
moted to Chief in 2012. 
Under Chief Steere’s leadership, the depart-
ment expanded to 26 sworn officers and 
added a second School Resource Officer posi-
tion. Additionally, Chief Steere oversaw a de-
partment-wide rebrand, including new uniforms 
and patches for all officers. Exemplifying his 
successes, Chief Steere spent countless 
hours each year with the City Parks and 
Recreation Board to ensure the well-known 
July 4th celebrations occurred safely and suc-
cessfully year after year. 
Throughout his distinguished career, Chief 
Steere served with impeccable integrity even 
when it proved difficult. Aside from dedicating 
his life to public service, Chief Steere has 
proudly served as an active participant in our 
West Michigan community. He gives back by 
volunteering his time with Rotary International, 
the YMCA, the Grand Rapids Community Col-
lege Police Academy Advisory Board, and the 
Kent Country Corrections Board. None of the 
above would be possible without the support 
of his wife Julie, and now adult children Eliza-
beth, Adam and Emily. 
It is because of the leadership and dedica-
tion of community members such as Chief 
Daniel Steere that I am especially proud to 
serve Michigan’s 2nd Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally 
congratulate Chief Steere on his well-deserved 
retirement and thank him for his service to 
West Michigan and our nation.

HONORING SUSAN RITTER FOR 37 
YEARS 
OF 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
HOME BUILDING INDUSTRY 
HON. SCOTT DesJARLAIS 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Mr. DESJARLAIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the accomplishments of Mrs. 
Susan Ritter, who is retiring from her position 
as Executive Vice President of the Home 
Builders Association of Tennessee (HBAT) 
after 37 years of service to the home building 
industry. 
Susan has been a tireless advocate for the 
home building industry—one of the key pri-
mary drivers of the American economy. Home 
ownership has long been one of the linchpins 
of the American dream, and the home building 
industry in Tennessee has long been in tune 
with the housing needs of local communities. 
I can personally speak of Susan’s effective-
ness in working on behalf of these goals. 
Susan has served as the executive vice 
president of the Home Builders Association of 
Tennessee since August 2000, serving as the 
point person for navigating the complex policy 
and regulatory world that members of the in-
dustry deal with as part of their day to day op-
erations. It is not coincidental that a good 
number of these business leaders happen to 
be cornerstones of the communities they 
serve. All of these individuals that I have had 
the privilege of meeting and ask difficult ques-
tions say the same thing: ‘‘Susan Ritter is the 
person to who you need to talk.’’ 
There have been many accolades for Su-
san’s service over the years, and her service 
was appropriately honored by the National As-
sociation of Home Builders when they named 
her the State Executive Officer of the Year. 
She was also a recipient of HBAT Past Presi-
dents’ Special Award for her ‘‘dedication and 
loyalty to the home building industry’’ in 2005. 
As the chief officer in charge of Tennessee’s 
association, she ran the daily operations of an 
association that includes 2,500 members while 
also monitoring the political and regulatory en-
vironments for the industry both in Nashville 
and Washington. 
In addition to being an effective voice for the 
industry—whether through communicating with 
Members of Congress or state legislators or 
with members of the media, Susan also guid-
ed their charitable endeavors. She also served 
as chairman of the Executive Officers Council 
in 2009, co-chair of the NAHB National Mem-
bership Committee in 2000, and was a mem-
ber of the NAHB Executive Committee in 2000 
and in 2009, also serving as a founding mem-
ber of the EO 20 Club. 
Susan has been a successful and profes-
sional leader for many years, and while I know 
the industry will continue to be successful for 
many years to come, I also know that the 
home builders of Tennessee will miss her 
guidance. I would ask all of the Members of 
Congress to join me in congratulating Susan 
Ritter for her excellent work and sending best 
wishes to her and her family in their future en-
deavors.

HONORING BRONSON FRIELING 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Bronson Frieling. 
Bronson is a very special young man who has 
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship 
and leadership by taking an active part in the 
Boy Scouts of America, Troop 60, and earning 
the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Bronson has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Bronson has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, 
Bronson has contributed to his community 
through his Eagle Scout project. Bronson 
fundraised, designed, and organized commu-
nity volunteers to install an 8 foot by 10 foot 
road sign for the Andrew County Museum in 
Savannah, Missouri. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Bronson Frieling for his 
accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of 
America and for his efforts put forth in achiev-
ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

January 15, 2020 
Over the past six and a half decades, Hex-
agon has brought laughter and music to the 
District. This non-profit, volunteer-based com-
pany was founded in 1965 by several mem-
bers of the Princeton all-male Triangle Club, 
who changed the group’s name to Hexagon, 
representing the group’s growth and inclusion 
of women. 
Each year, Hexagon puts on a show and 
donates proceeds, sometimes as large as 
$30,000, to charities, many located in D.C. 
Last year, the company donated to Dancing 
Classrooms of Washington, D.C., a local arts 
education program focused on teaching social- 
emotional skills to fifth graders through dance. 
The proceeds of this year’s 65th anniversary 
show, entitled ‘‘One State Two State Red 
State Blue State,’’ will go to SMYL, a non-prof-
it organization serving LGBTQ youth in D.C. 
Although all the performers are volunteers, 
Hexagon is a show of professional quality that 
sells out to packed-houses of residents from 
D.C. and the region. I have had the honor of 
performing with the company, along with sev-
eral other Members of Congress, over the 
years, including Senator CHRIS VAN HOLLEN 
and Congresswoman DONNA SHALALA. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask the 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring Hexagon for working to improve the lives 
of D.C. and regional residents through laugh-
ter and charity. As we honor the company’s 65 
years in District of Columbia, we can only wish 
for many more.

RECOGNIZING MR. RAY WALKER 
FOR AN OUTSTANDING COACH-
ING CAREER 
HON. MO BROOKS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate Mr. Ray Walker for 
his induction into the Alabama Baseball 
Coaching Association Hall of Fame. 
Ray was born in 1946 in Anniston, Ala-
bama. At two years old, his family moved to 
Huntsville. Ray was a part of the first grad-
uating class at Lee High School, in 1964. At 
Lee, Ray played baseball, basketball, and 
football. Upon graduation, Ray attended Wil-
liam Carey College before transferring to Flor-
ence State (UNA), where he earned a Bach-
elor of Science degree in 1968. In 1970, Ray 
received a master’s degree in Physical Edu-
cation (PE) and Administration from Athens 
State College. 
In 1968, Ray began teaching Biology and 
PE at Chapman Junior High School, where he 
coached baseball, basketball, and football. In 
1975, Ray transferred to Grissom High School 
to become a driving instructor. At Grissom, 
Ray took on two head coaching positions: 
baseball and freshman football. Ray remained 
in these two positions until his retirement in 
2000. 
As the head Freshman Football Coach, 
Ray’s teams won 102 games and eight city 
championships. Ray served as Grissom’s 
Head Baseball Coach for 25 years, where he 
led his team to 389 wins. Sixty-eight of the 
players from his program went on to play in 
college and three went into the minor leagues. 
In total, Ray’s teams won nine city champion-
ship titles and advanced to the final four dur-
ing the state baseball playoffs in 1982 and 
1991. Ray’s Grissom High Baseball team won 
the 6A State Baseball Championship in 1989. 
Ray was chosen several times as Huntsville 
City Coach of the Year in baseball. In 1989, 
Ray was chosen as Coach of the Year for the 
State of Alabama. During the last 20 years of 
his baseball coaching career at Grissom High 
School, his team made the state playoffs 18 
times. In 2004, Ray was inducted into the 
Huntsville Madison County Sports Hall of 
Fame for his many achievements. 
Ray served in the Army Reserve from 1970 
to 1998 and retired as a Master Sergeant. He 
recalls that as a young man many people had 
significant influences in his life but none great-
er than his uncle, Oba Belcher. Ray followed 
his uncle’s career at Athens College with in-
tense interest as he coached many out-
standing basketball teams. Ray observed that 
his uncle always set his standards high, out- 
worked other teams, and projected a positive 
attitude through his coaching. Oba was a won-
derful role model and mentor, especially when 
Ray began his coaching career. 
After teaching and coaching for 46 years in 
the Huntsville City Schools, Ray retired, or so 
one thought. Ray’s retirement from the school 
system led to what was the beginning of his 
new career as the owner and operator of 
Coach Walker’s Driving School. Ray jokes that 
because the word ‘‘retirement’’ is not in the 
Bible, you need to keep on working. Truth be 
told, he loves what he has felt he was lead to 
do, and is continuing to fulfill his life’s work by 
teaching and coaching today’s young people.

HONORING MR. JUAN LINO 
RAMIREZ 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 15, 2020 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to wish Mr. Juan Lino Ramirez, a 
beloved public servant and successful busi-
nessman from South Texas, a very special 
85th birthday. 
Mr. Ramirez was born on January 20, 1935, 
and dedicated his life to serving others while 
successfully 
creating 
multiple 
businesses. 
Juan Lino’s contributions to Jim Hogg County 
and South Texas have been significant, and I 
am honored to be able to stand here today 
and share those achievements with my col-
leagues and the citizens of the United States 
of America. 
Juan Lino started his career like many other 
Americans, with a small business. When Juan 
Lino was in his mid-twenties, he opened up 
his first business, a small car repair shop 
called T&R Auto Repair Shop. He ran and 
worked at the shop until he was able to move 
onto more lucrative business opportunities. In 
1967, Juan Lino decided to obtain a Used Car 
Business Dealer License, which he later used 
to become one of the best salesmen in South 
Texas, winning the ‘‘Dealer of the Month’’ 
award from the San Antonio Auto Auction. 
Juan Lino acknowledged his business acumen 
but humbly decided to take a different career 
path and serve the people of South Texas. 
In his twenties, Juan Lino took an interest in 
Jim Hogg County’s public education system 
and served on the Independent School District 
Board. There, he expanded educational oppor-
tunities for all students in the district, facilitated 
a vision for the future of the Jim Hogg Inde-
pendent School District, and served as a role 
model to all that knew him in the community. 
After serving on the Jim Hogg County Inde-
pendent School District Board, Juan Lino de-
cided to serve his community in a new capac-
ity by taking on the highest law enforcement 
post in Jim Hogg County: Sheriff. Juan Lino 
served as the Jim Hogg County Sheriff twice, 
first from 1970 to 1973 and then again from 
1976 to 1980. During his time as Sheriff, he 
hired the first female Sheriff Deputy in Jim 
Hogg County’s history, Vila Martinez, acquired 
the first computer for the Sheriff’s Department, 
and introduced standardized Sheriff Deputy 
uniforms. 
These 
accomplishments 
helped 
transform the Jim Hogg Sheriff’s Department 
into the modem and professional unit it is 
today. Juan Lino also successfully created 
one-way streets in school zones to ensure the 
safety of students on their commutes to and 
from school as the Sheriff of Jim Hogg. 
Juan Lino continued to give back to Jim 
Hogg County in the 21st Century, serving as 
the County Commissioner for Precinct 4 for 
two terms. The first term was from 2002 to 
2006, and the second term was from 2011 to 
2015. During his time as County Commis-
sioner for Precinct 4, Juan Lino worked to bet-
ter the lives of people on a daily basis through 
infrastructure, economic development, and 
housing projects. I cannot imagine Jim Hogg 
County without Mr. Ramirez. He helped shep-
herd the Sheriff’s Department into a new era, 
expanded women’s opportunities, enhanced 
student safety, successfully grew his busi-
nesses, and accomplished many more mile-
stones. 
Madam Speaker, on January 20, 2020, Mr. 
Juan Lino Ramirez turns 85. I stand here 
today to acknowledge the decades of service 
Mr. Ramirez has given to Jim Hogg County. 
Mr. Juan Lino Ramirez serves as a leader in 
our community, and I wish him a very happy 
birthday.
