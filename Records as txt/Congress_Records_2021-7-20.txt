RECOGNIZING BRENDAN BRIDGES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. PENCE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize the hard work and 
dedication of Brendan Bridges as he re-
tires from service as Greensburg Police 
Chief. 
First joining the department in 2001, 
Chief Bridges served as a patrol officer 
and detective before being promoted as 
police chief in 2014. 
Chief Bridges is turning a chapter 
and becoming the resource officer in 
Greensburg Community Schools sys-
tem. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chief 
Bridges for his service to our commu-
nity, and on behalf of Indiana’s Sixth 
District I would like to wish him the 
best of luck in his future endeavors. 
SHELBY COUNTY’S BICENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Shelby County, 
Indiana, on the bicentennial anniver-
sary of its founding. 
Created in 1821 by the Indiana Gen-
eral Assembly, Shelby County is a 
doughnut county of the greater Indian-
apolis area. 
With a population of around 45,000 
people, Shelby County is the home of 
the 21st Vice President of the United 
States, Thomas Hendricks. 
Shelby 
County 
is 
predominantly 
built around its manufacturing and ag-
riculture communities that continue to 
attract investment from companies 
around the globe. 
Congratulations to Shelby County on 
your 200th anniversary, and I wish you 
the best of luck for the next 200 years. 
UNION COUNTY BICENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Union County, 
Indiana, on the bicentennial anniver-
sary of its founding. 
Two hundred years ago, the Indiana 
State legislature authorized the cre-
ation of Union County by ceding land 
from Fayette, Franklin, and Wayne 
Counties. 
With a small population of around 
7,000 people, Union County is a commu-
nity based on agriculture and farming. 
Union County also attracts tens of 
thousands of visitors annually to visit 
the picturesque Whitewater Memorial 
State 
Park 
and 
the 
beautiful 
Brookville Lake. 
Congratulations to Union County for 
its bicentennial anniversary, and I 
wish them the best of luck for the next 
200 years. 
IN MEMORY OF LARRY JACKSON 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of my very dear 
friend, Larry Jackson. Larry was an 
honest, hardworking Hoosier who al-
ways put family first. 
Larry leaves behind his wonderful 
wife of 56 years, Judy Jackson, and his 
five children and grandchildren. 
Larry was a devoted member of the 
St. Bartholomew Catholic Church and 
a dedicated man of faith. 
My condolences and prayers go out to 
Judy and the entire Jackson family. 
God bless them. 
A BIG VICTORY FOR HOOSIERS 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the favorable out-
come we were able to secure for Indi-
ana’s Sixth District regarding the OMB 
MSA core population threshold. 
Had a revised policy been adopted, 
Federal funding opportunities for Hoo-
siers in Indiana would have been se-
verely reduced. 
This is a big victory for midsized 
communities. 
Hoosier cities and countless others 
across the Nation would have unneces-
sarily lost out on Federal reserves be-
cause 
of 
Washington’s 
short- 
sightedness. 
I am proud to have led my colleagues 
on a commonsense issue like this. 
STAND FOR LIFE 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to implore my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle to reconsider 
their mission to defeat the Hyde 
amendment. 
The greatness of a free society can 
best be measured by how it cares for 
the most vulnerable, especially the un-
born. 
This legislative body has had a long-
standing and bipartisan provision that 
prevents American taxpayer dollars 
from being used to fund abortions, and 
we cannot end this practice now. 
Furthermore, it is why I signed on to 
cosponsor H.R. 18.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3674 
July 20, 2021 
I am again urging my colleagues 
today to join me in always standing for 
life. 
INFLATION IS TAXATION 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the growing infla-
tion crisis that threatens our Hoosier 
way of life back home in Indiana’s 
Sixth District. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are now trying to ram 
through a bipartisan $3.5 trillion pack-
age that will stick middle-class fami-
lies with higher taxes and lower wages. 
This hyper-partisan spending spree is 
a tax hike and a pay cut for every 
American. 
It is simple: Inflation is taxation.

HONORING THE LIFE OF LEONA 
JANE 
BROWN 
FERNANDER 
SAMUDA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I am 
honored today to stand on the floor of 
the House of Representatives to pay 
tribute to and to honor the life of a 
trusted friend of 4 decades, a cherished 
mentor, and an extraordinary woman 
of faith, Mrs. Leona Jane Brown 
Fernander Samuda. 
Rosie, as I knew her and she was 
fondly referred to by her family and 
friends, passed away on June 14, 2021. 
I extend my sympathy and condo-
lences and prayers along with the more 
than 700,000 citizens of North Caro-
lina’s Twelfth Congressional District 
to the Brown, Fernander, Samuda fam-
ilies during this difficult time. 
Born in Alice Town, Eleuthera, Baha-
mas, Rosie was a woman who spoke her 
mind, never mincing words, always 
genuinely wise in thought and deeds. 
A mother, grandmother, great-grand-
mother who raised six children, five 
boys and one girl, she was the rock and 
fortress of her family. 
A matriarch to family and commu-
nity, Rosie shared her many talents, 
including cooking her favorite mac and 
cheese to the love she and I both had 
for wearing hats. 
Rosie’s glowing smile, the infectious 
personality that she had, and always a 
few jokes, made her a lover of people 
who loved her back. 
A global citizen, she never met a 
stranger and was genuinely interested 
in the politics of every community 
where she lived, from the Parliament 
in her native Bahamas to the Black 
community politics in Charlotte, North 
Carolina. 
Always engaging, interacting with 
political leaders, advocating for human 
and civil rights, Rosie never ceased to 
make her opinions known. 
Rosie’s contributions were extensive 
and her lessons invaluable. Rosie loved 
children and she became an entre-
preneur and a businesswoman who 
owned and operated Aunt Jane’s Edu 
Care for preschoolers. 
Widely traveled, living in places such 
as Switzerland, Chippingham, and as a 
resident in my district in Charlotte, 
she studied and earned her degree from 
the University of North Carolina at 
Charlotte. 
Small in stature, Rosie was a mighty 
little giant who made an indelible im-
pact on so many people for more than 
eight decades, and I was blessed to 
have known her and have her as a 
friend. 
Mrs. Leona Jane Brown Fernander 
Samuda, dedicated woman of faith, 
gained the respect of men, women, and 
little children, and she made this world 
much better than she found it. 
She served to fulfill the scripture in 
Psalm 84:10, which says: ‘‘Better is one 
day in your courts than a thousand 
elsewhere; I would rather be a door-
keeper in the house of my God than 
dwell in the tents of the wicked.’’ 
Rest in peace, Rosie. We love you. We 
miss you.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND HON-
ORING THE MEMORY OF TONY 
LEE DILL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the life and 
honor the memory of Tony Lee Dill, a 
west Texas farmer, who I had the privi-
lege of representing and the great 
blessing of calling my friend. 
Tony was born on June 3, 1960, to 
G.W. and Sue Dill in Terry County, 
Texas. Tony had a lifelong passion for 
the land and a love for people that was 
second to none. 
Tony wasn’t just a great farmer, he 
was a great leader, dedicating much of 
his life to being a voice for agriculture 
in rural America. He was absolutely 
committed to public service for his 
community, for his industry, and for 
the country he loved. 
When I first met Tony, he was presi-
dent of the Western Peanut Growers 
Association. 
Tony was the epitome of a west 
Texan and a great American farmer. 
Tony was honest, humble, and hard-
working. Tony was a gentleman, a man 
of great faith and love for the Lord, 
and he was happiest when he was with 
his family, his beloved wife, Donna, 
five children, and eight grandchildren. 
I know they miss Tony something 
fierce, and I do, too, but I am confident 
that Tony is in the presence of the 
great farmer, the Creator of Heaven 
and Earth, and all that share Tony’s 
faith will be with him for all eternity. 
God bless and go west Texas. 
HONORING JOSH BARTLETT 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
last week west Texas witnessed an un-
speakable tragedy. One of Lubbock 
County’s true heroes, Sergeant Josh 
Bartlett, lost his life in the line of 
duty. Our hearts are heavy with grief 
for the Bartlett family, and our pray-
ers are with them along with the in-
jured officers and their families, espe-
cially including Sergeant Shawn Wil-
son. 
Sergeant Bartlett dedicated his life 
to the sacred calling of wearing the 
uniform in defense of his country and 
community, honorably protecting and 
serving his fellow Americans. We are 
all heartbroken for his wife Rebecca 
and their children, Zachary, Christian, 
Logan and Kasidy. Like so many in law 
enforcement, Josh watched over our 
families while taking care of his own as 
a husband and a father. 
We must never forget that the men 
and women in blue represent the very 
best of our Nation, the bravest and 
most dedicated among our citizens. We 
all owe them the highest respect and 
deepest gratitude for their willingness 
to sacrifice their lives to protect ours. 
West Texas, Madam Speaker, is a 
family, 
and 
west 
Texans 
unapologetically, 
unreservedly 
love 
and respect our brothers and sisters in 
law enforcement. We know they stand 
between us and the bad guys, and we 
stand with them and their families, es-
pecially in these times of sorrow and 
loss. 
May God comfort all the families af-
fected in this tragedy, and may He pro-
tect and keep those who keep watch 
over us along the thin blue line. 
CONGRATULATING THE NEW DEAL LIONS 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate the New 
Deal Lions on winning their first 2A 
baseball State championship. 
The Lions’ State championship win 
comes after a playoff loss in regionals 
and a 2020 season where they canceled 
six games due to COVID. Fueled by 
those setbacks, the New Deal Lions 
took head coach Jason Ybarra’s motto, 
‘‘Unfinished Business,’’ to heart during 
the 2021 season. 
Led by Kyler Reed, Harley Patterson, 
and Noah Rodriguez as team captains, 
the New Deal Lions season included 
not only a State championship, Madam 
Speaker, but a 13 and 0 record district 
play. 
Kyler Reed retained district MVP, 
Harley Patterson was named offensive 
MVP, Tanner Seeley was awarded de-
fensive MVP, and Noah Rodriguez was 
recognized as the Newcomer of the 
Year. 
So congratulations to Lion Nation. 
This team of young men, along with 
their coach, represent the west Texas 
value of hard work and dedication and 
the west Texas spirit of excellence in 
all things. 
God bless and go west Texas.

the movie theater shooting in Aurora, 
Colorado, on July 20, 2012, and all of 
the everyday heroes who make sac-
rifices for their community, including 
those heroes we have seen during this 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Nine years ago today, 12 lives were 
taken, 70 were wounded, and hundreds 
more suffered emotional trauma. 
Yet even in this tragedy, we saw in-
credible heroism, those who carried the 
wounded to safety, and the first re-
sponders, 
law 
enforcement, 
fire-
fighters, and medical teams whose tire-
less efforts saved many lives. 
I would like to recognize those who 
lost their lives that night: AJ Boik; 
Jesse Childress; Gordon Cowden, whose 
two teenage children were in the the-
ater when he was killed; Jessica Ghawi; 
Micayla Medek; Veronica Moser-Sul-
livan, age six, whose mother was shot 
in the chest and miscarried a week 
after the attack; Rebecca Wingo; and 
Alex Sullivan, who was celebrating his 
27th birthday and was 1 week away 
from his first wedding anniversary. 
I would also like to recognize the 
four who died while saving and shield-
ing others: Jonathan Blunk, John 
Larimer, Matt McQuinn, and Alex 
Teves. 
During trying times, it is important 
to remember the heroes among us who, 
on a daily basis, answer the call to step 
up for their community and especially 
on July 20, a day we think of as Na-
tional Heroes Day. 
These 
everyday 
heroes 
such 
as 
healthcare workers, frontline workers, 
essential personnel, and those who 
helped develop and administer the 
COVID–19 vaccines, among others, have 
been particularly visible during this 
coronavirus pandemic, and I would like 
to recognize their tremendous acts of 
selflessness and bravery. 
Join me in saying ‘‘thank you’’ to 
the hero in your life. Let’s exhibit the 
same spirit of courage and service 
today and throughout the year.

47TH ANNIVERSARY OF MILITARY 
INVASION OF CYPRUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. MALLIOTAKIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today on the 47th anniversary of 
the Republic of Turkey’s deadly and 
unprovoked military invasion of Cy-
prus. 
This is a dark time in the history of 
the Greek Cypriot people and a stark 
reminder that we must never forget 
Turkey’s ethnic cleansing of 200,000 
Greek Cypriot people less than 50 years 
ago. 
The tragedy that is the illegal Turk-
ish occupation of Cyprus that occurred 
on July 20, 1974, continues to this very 
day. I speak before you at a time when 
the Republic of Turkey is actively en-
gaged in an aggressive, illegal, and uni-
lateral reopening of Varosha, a once- 
bustling Greek Cypriot resort town and 
international tourist destination in the 
Famagusta District of the island. 
Following the Turkish approach to 
Varosha in August 1974, the town’s na-
tive Greek Cypriot population fled for 
their lives, only to later be denied the 
right to return by the occupying Turk-
ish Armed Forces. Many of the Varosha 
refugees are still alive today, yearning 
to go back to their homes, while Presi-
dent Erdogan has moved to reopen 
Varosha to tourists. 
The suffering in Cyprus is not just 
limited 
to 
Varosha. 
The 
Turkish 
Armed Forces have illegally occupied 
more than one-third of the island. They 
have destroyed and converted over 500 
Greek Orthodox churches to mosques 
in the course of their invasion. They 
stole over 60,000 archaeological treas-
ures, part of Greek civilization’s cul-
tural heritage. Their violence led to 
the disappearance of over 20,000 Chris-
tian icons, and even worse, 1,130 people 
who remain missing since 1974—five of 
them, American citizens. 
Madam Speaker, over the years, the 
United Nations has taken a stand 
against Turkey’s illegal occupation of 
Cyprus, going so far as to deploy thou-
sands of U.N. Peacekeepers to prevent 
further Turkish incursions into the 
southern half of the island. In addition, 
the U.N. Security Council gathered in 
1984 and 1992 to pass Resolution 550 and 
Resolution 789, respectively, to draw 
red lines when it comes to Turkish ac-
tivity in sensitive areas like Varosha. 
Specifically, these resolutions state 
that the Council ‘‘considers attempts 
to settle any part of Varosha by people 
other than its inhabitants as inadmis-
sible, and calls for the transfer of that 
area to the administration of the 
United Nations,’’ and that, ‘‘the area at 
present under the control of the United 
Nations peacekeeping force in Cyprus 
be extended to include Varosha.’’ 
As we grow one year closer to the 
50th anniversary of Turkey’s illegal in-
vasion of Cyprus, the United States 
must take a strong stand at the United 
Nations and other international fora to 
address the growing threat posed by 
Turkey, its increased aggression, and 
to ensure the eventual return of homes 
and land to its native Greek Cypriot 
inhabitants and reunification of this is-
land nation. 
If we, as a governing body, truly 
claim to stand for liberty and justice 
for all, we must speak in a unified 
voice on this issue. And it is a bipar-
tisan issue. When he was chairman of 
the Senate Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs, then-Senator Joe Biden promised 
the Greek Cypriot refugee community 
that they would return to their home-
land, if he was ever elected President. 
During our first Committee on Foreign 
Affairs hearing with Secretary of State 
Blinken, he committed to me and my 
colleagues from both sides of the aisle 
that brought up this concern that the 
reunification of Cyprus would be a pri-
ority for this administration. 
Yet, we saw our President meet with 
President Erdogan, and we don’t even 
believe the issue was brought up, so we 
will continue to speak out against this. 
I encourage my colleagues to speak 
out, call for action, and take a stand 
for our Greek Cypriot friends who need 
our support now more than ever. 
If we are to see the end of this occu-
pation in our lifetimes, the United 
States must lead the way. 
f 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF KATE 
JENNINGS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Mrs. BUSTOS) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker in 
2016, my deputy chief of staff, Kate 
Jennings, first joined our office. After 
working with political greats like 
then-Senator Barack Obama and Sen-
ator DICK DURBIN, our team was lucky 
that Kate would be bringing her pas-
sion and her dedication to our work. 
Over the next 5-plus years, there 
would not be one day when Kate didn’t 
put the people who we serve at the very 
heart of everything she did. When 
COVID–19 hit Illinois last year, our of-
fice learned of a family sheltering in a 
hotel, unable to feed themselves or feed 
their children. So in the middle of this 
spreading pandemic, what did Kate do? 
She put herself at risk, went to the 
grocery, packed a box full of food, and 
delivered it to the door at the hotel 
where this family was sheltering so the 
children would not go hungry. 
And every year, Kate would take Val-
entines to our veterans to make sure 
that they knew that they were appre-
ciated and that they were loved. She 
would travel thousands of miles across 
our vast Congressional district, and 
was unwavering in her hard work for 
all 14 counties in our district. She 
never tired and always worked to lift 
up the voices of the people that were 
fortunate enough to be able to serve. 
Madam Speaker, Kate recently began 
her next chapter, and our entire team 
and our office and I wish her well on 
her new adventure. This week, as we 
continue to strive to always deliver for 
the people, I can think of no better 
celebration than to thank the person 
who spent nearly 2,000 days in our of-
fice putting the people we serve first. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Kate for her 
dedicated service, her hard work, and 
her friendship for so many years. Ev-
eryone on our team knows that she 
will continue to deliver for the people 
of Illinois.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3676 
July 20, 2021 
Ray began his career with the Rich 
Products Corporation, working for the 
SeaPak Shrimp and Seafood division in 
Saint Simons Island. Over the next 
three decades, he would have a positive 
impact on the seafood industry and on 
our community. Ray was a genuine ad-
vocate for seafood sustainability and a 
trusted voice in meeting with Members 
of Congress. Ray served as chairman of 
the National Fisheries Institute’s tech-
nical committee from 1994 to 1996, and 
was the technical chairman of the Na-
tional Shrimp Industry Association 
from 1998 to 2005. 
In 2017, he was recognized as the sea-
food industry leader for his decades of 
commitment to seafood sustainability 
and quality. Despite Ray’s countless 
career achievements, his proudest role 
was as a father and grandfather. 
Madam Speaker, my thoughts and 
prayers are with his family, friends, 
and all who knew him during this most 
difficult time. 
RECOGNIZING PASTOR BILL LIGON 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor Pastor Bill Ligon of Brunswick, 
Georgia, for his 90th birthday. 
Pastor Ligon experienced the call of 
God at 18 years old. Since then, he 
founded the Christian Renewal Church 
in Brunswick, Georgia, and has served 
as its pastor for over 40 years. Pastor 
Ligon has served throughout the south-
east, but the impact of his outreach re-
mains immeasurable. 
He is one of the founders of the Fel-
lowship of Churches and Ministers 
International, with churches in eight 
States and three foreign countries. 
Alongside his wife, Pastor Ligon served 
for 6 years as Southern Baptist mis-
sionaries in Spain where they served 
churches and taught the gospel. 
Madam Speaker, with his passion to 
share and teach the gospel, I know Pas-
tor Ligon will continue his tremendous 
work at Christian Renewal Church. He 
has dedicated his life to spreading the 
word of God, and I thank him for his 
decades of service. 
RECOGNIZING REAR ADMIRAL ERIC JONES 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor Rear Admiral Eric Jones for his 
outstanding career and service as Com-
mander of the Seventh Coast Guard 
District. 
Rear Admiral Jones has dedicated his 
life to protecting our country. As Dis-
trict Commander, he is responsible for 
all Coast Guard operations throughout 
the Southeast and the Caribbean Basin, 
which includes Georgia’s First Con-
gressional District. 
Notably, under his command, Coast 
Guard members responded when a 
cargo ship capsized in the Saint Si-
mons Sound. This rescue effort was he-
roic and saved all 24 people on the ship. 
During his time, Rear Admiral Jones 
has provided extraordinary leadership 
and management to the United States 
Coast Guard. His service has been 
marked by excellence and has received 
significant recognition, including four 
Coast Guard Commendation Medals, 
the Coast Guard Achievement Medal, 
and various service and unit awards. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate Rear 
Admiral Jones on his next duty assign-
ment and thank him for his years of 
service to Georgia’s First Congres-
sional District. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF BOBBY CARPENTER 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor Mr. Bobby Carpenter, who passed 
away on June 25 at the age of 89. 
Bobby graduated from Richmond Hill 
High School in 1948. Following gradua-
tion, he served in the U.S. Navy for 4 
years. Once back home, Bobby served 
as the postmaster of the Richmond Hill 
Post Office and received his official 
commission from President Lyndon B. 
Johnson. 
Bobby also served as the president of 
Bryan Neck Cemetery Association for 
50 years, church treasurer for 25 years, 
and a member of the Bryan County 
Board of Education. He enriched the 
lives of all who knew him and loved 
him, and he leaves behind a legacy of 
kindness, faith, and love. 
Bobby’s dedication to improving the 
lives of others will never be forgotten. 
Richmond Hill sorely misses him. My 
thoughts and prayers are with Bobby’s 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during this most difficult time.

NATIONAL HEROES DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. CROW) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, 9 years 
ago today, Aurora, Colorado, faced an 
unbelievable tragedy when a shooter 
opened fire in a movie theater. 
Madam Speaker, 12 people lost their 
lives, 70 were injured, and countless 
others are still impacted by the trauma 
of that day. 
Every year, Aurora and the greater 
Colorado community come together to 
remember the lives lost and the trau-
ma. We also come together to recog-
nize the everyday heroes that stepped 
up to help their neighbors and loved 
ones. Their heroism saved lives. 
I thank my friend and colleague, 
Representative ED
PERLMUTTER
for, 
again, offering a resolution to des-
ignate July 28 as National Heroes Day. 
This year, in particular, we recognize 
the everyday heroes that have helped 
us withstand this pandemic, our front-
line workers, scientists, and healthcare 
professionals, and the first responders 
who stand on the front lines every day. 
As we reflect today, let us also be 
galvanized into action. In the 9 years 
since the Aurora tragedy, little has 
been done at the Federal level to re-
duce gun violence and mass shootings. 
Enough is enough. I am here, in part, 
because I have been inspired by my 
constituents who endured incredible 
tragedy 9 years ago and have directed 
that pain to fight for change. Let us 
not grow numb to the pain of this day, 
but let’s continue to work toward 
meaningful and lasting change. 
NATIONAL PENNSYLVANIA DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize July 20 as National Pennsylvania 
Day. Pennsylvania’s nickname, the 
Keystone State, represents the central 
role we played in shaping our Nation. 
Our great Commonwealth was the sec-
ond State to join the Union and contin-
ued to lead the way in making history. 
As the first capitol of our Nation, 
many great decisions were made in 
Philadelphia. It was there our Found-
ing Fathers authored the Declaration 
of Independence and the Constitution 
forming this great Nation. Pennsyl-
vania served in an important role in 
key military operations. Valley Forge 
tells a story of sacrifice, leadership, 
grit, and determination when our rag- 
tag military was attempting to defy 
history and defeat a global superpower. 
The Battle of Gettysburg marked a 
turning point of the Civil War, pro-
viding the Union with the momentum 
to bring our great Nation back to-
gether. Our State continues to carry 
the legacy of many firsts, from the 
first American flag sewn by Betsy Ross 
to the first commercial oil well. 
Our inventor spirit continues to 
weave through history, from Benjamin 
Franklin, Robert Fulton, and Jonas 
Salk. We continue to bring new and ex-
citing ideas forward. Our legacy of 
American 
craftsmanship 
and 
work 
ethic runs deep, from our steel mills 
and coal mines to our farmlands and 
forests. 
Madam Speaker, as a lifelong resi-
dent of Pennsylvania, I am encouraged 
each and every day by the industrious 
spirit of our residents as we continue 
to build a bright path forward for our 
commonwealth and our country. 
Happy Pennsylvania Day! I am proud 
to be from our great Keystone State.

HOT FERC SUMMER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. CASTEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CASTEN. Madam Speaker, I 
trust most of my colleagues have heard 
of ‘‘Hot Girl Summer’’ and the broader 
Megan Thee Stallion oeuvre. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to de-
clare the start of ‘‘Hot FERC Sum-
mer,’’ with FERC, of course, being the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commis-
sion. Why, you might ask? Well, to par-
aphrase Ms. Stallion, because now that 
FERC has put in all that work, it is 
time for them to be the MVP. 
Now, some might say that FERC 
isn’t, dare I say, hot enough to warrant 
that attention. But for those of us who 
are serious about fighting the climate 
crisis, they sure should be. 
The Commission ensures our energy 
markets, generation, and transmission

are operating and providing us with af-
fordable, reliable energy. But the best 
kept secret of all is that FERC is abso-
lutely key to achieving our clean en-
ergy goals and a zero carbon economy. 
For the last few decades, FERC’s big-
gest push has been to encourage com-
petition in the power sector. FERC 
Order 888, which just celebrated its 
25th birthday a few months ago, may 
not have cracked the Billboard Top 100, 
but it has been almost singularly re-
sponsible for decarbonizing our electric 
sector. The order, like most things 
FERC-related, 
was, 
frankly, 
pretty 
wonky. But by incentivizing lower-cost 
gas, nuclear, and renewable energy, it 
drove the private sector to drastically 
lower their greenhouse gas emissions 
and slash electricity costs. 
From the perspective of anyone who 
pays for electricity, that is fantastic 
news. You pay less for cleaner power. 
From the perspective of someone who 
cares about climate change, it is also 
amazing because once a clean energy 
plant is built, you don’t need to pay 
the wind to blow or the Sun to shine. 
Clean energy is the cheapest source of 
energy out there, and those old, dirty 
plants just can’t compete. 
In my home State of Illinois, a recent 
study found that it would be cheaper to 
sell a coal plant that was just built a 
decade ago for scrap and procure clean-
er replacement power through those 
FERC-organized markets. Thank you, 
FERC. 
To kick off ‘‘Hot FERC Summer,’’ I 
have introduced bills that will help 
FERC build on this success. The first of 
these was the Interregional Trans-
mission Planning Improvement Act, 
which I introduced with Senator HEIN-
RICH, that will ensure that our grid op-
erators are thinking properly about the 
benefits of building transmission wires 
across the country. 
The second, the Energy PRICE Act, 
which I introduced just today with 
Representatives LEVIN, HUFFMAN, and 
BONAMICI, 
would 
help 
ensure 
that 
FERC lives up to its legal responsi-
bility to protect the public welfare by 
not approving electricity rates that 
don’t account for the cost of green-
house gas emissions. 
I will be dropping a third ‘‘Hot FERC 
Summer’’ bill—I am sorry, a third hot 
jam next week. 
But right now, FERC is at a cross-
roads. For the first time in years, 
President Biden has an opportunity to 
create a Democratic majority at FERC; 
a majority that will ensure that these 
incentives are in place to build an elec-
tric grid for our 21st century economy; 
a majority that will ensure that State 
renewable energy rules are respected 
and integrated into regional markets, a 
majority that will ensure that uneco-
nomic fossil fuel plants are subjected 
to the competitive pressures of a free 
market that have given us an explosion 
in solar and wind energy over the past 
decade; a majority that will ensure 
that we make further progress in our 
clean energy goals rather than trying 
to fight against it. 
But in order to do any of that in time 
to prevent more climate devastation, 
the President must nominate a Com-
missioner to FERC, and the Senate 
must confirm that individual. I urge 
both to do so as soon as possible to en-
sure that FERC stays at its full power 
and that it will be able to continue to 
be the most important clean energy 
agency that most of us have never 
heard of. 
As you, of course know, Madam 
Speaker, ‘‘Hot Girl Summer’’ ain’t 
about degrees, but ‘‘Hot FERC Sum-
mer’’ most definitely is. The record 
temperatures from Portland to Death 
Valley, the wildfires, and the coming 
hurricane season are all the direct re-
sult of our failure to decarbonize as 
quickly as we must. 
While this summer is the hottest 
FERC summer yet, it is coming on the 
heels of 2020, which was the hottest 
summer North America has ever seen 
for as long as we have records. In point 
of fact, the 10 warmest summers on 
record have occurred since 1998. If we 
fail to act, they will be nothing com-
pared to the summers we will experi-
ence over the coming decades because 
while the best chance to take action on 
climate was 30 years ago, the last 
chance is now. 
f 
EMPOWERING THE FREE MARKET 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. NEHLS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, the 
Consumer Price Index rose 5.4 percent 
in the last year, the highest inflation 
in 13 years. 
Americans are paying more for near-
ly everything. According to the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics, the price of milk is 
up 5.6 percent; the price of fruit is up 
7.3 percent; and the price of gas is up a 
whopping 45 percent. 
Americans are paying more for goods 
and services because of the Democrats’ 
out-of-control spending. Despite the 
dire economic state Democrats’ reck-
less spending has put us in, they are 
now trying to ram through a partisan 
$3.5 trillion package that will raise 
taxes on the middle class and job cre-
ators. 
What are Democrats telling Amer-
ican businesses to do when they are 
going to raise taxes and impose regula-
tions on them as they try to rebuild in 
the aftermath of a pandemic? They are 
telling them to take their business 
overseas. 
To bounce back from the Biden ad-
ministration’s dismal job reports in 
consecutive months, we need to be 
stimulating economic opportunity and 
growth with less taxes and less regula-
tion. Doing so will help spur the cre-
ation of good-paying jobs that encour-
age people to get back in the work-
force. 
What won’t fix it is continuing to 
throw money at the economy, which 
seems to be all the Washington swamp 
knows how to do. The Democrats’ lib-
eral tax-and-spend model is failing our 
economy and failing the American peo-
ple. 
We are not going to spend our way 
out of this mess with trillion-dollar 
programs that do nothing but serve lib-
eral special interests. We do it by let-
ting the free market flourish through 
lower taxes, lower regulation, and 
more economic freedom. 
It worked under President Trump 
when he set records in unemployment, 
and it will work again if only the Fed-
eral Government would get out of the 
way and empower the people and the 
free market. 
f 
GETTING VACCINATED TO 
PROTECT OUR FAMILIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Mrs. LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today as COVID cases surge in 
my home State of Nevada and across 
this country. 
In fact, in the past 3 days, Nevada 
has added over 2,000 new cases, and our 
2-week positivity rate has rapidly 
grown to more than 12 percent. Hos-
pitalizations are up, too, with the vast 
majority being among, you guessed it, 
the unvaccinated. 
Unfortunately, just over half of Ne-
vadans are fully or partially vac-
cinated. We must all do our part to end 
this pandemic. The best thing you can 
do to protect yourself, your family, the 
ones you care about most is to get vac-
cinated. 
Getting your vaccine is safe and, 
now, easier than ever. Believe it or not, 
back home in Nevada, it comes with 
the chance to win more than $5 million 
in prizes. That is how desperate we are 
to make sure that everyone is moti-
vated to go get a vaccine. 
Please, go to vaccines.gov to find a 
clinic. For those who are already vac-
cinated, please take the time this week 
to reach out and encourage your peers 
to do their part, too. 
Together, we can stop the spread and 
get our lives back to normal.

REPORTING ON MISSING BLACK 
CHILDREN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
this first speech that I am going to 
give today is, as we used to say in 
church, something that the Lord spoke 
on my heart. He speaks to me, just not 
in an audible voice. This is something 
that has kind of been a burden with me 
for quite some time. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise to ex-
press my great concern for the dis-
proportionate number of missing Black 
children in our country and the way 
they are treated by our national media. 
Every 
child 
is 
precious, 
Madam 
Speaker, and it is a tragedy whenever a

child goes missing. The sad truth is 
that it happens to Black kids far more 
often. Missing Black children made up 
over one-third of the missing child 
cases in 2019—over one-third. Yet, it 
has also been shown these children re-
ceive much less media coverage than 
their counterparts from other demo-
graphics. 
The media dedicates an enormous 
amount of time to discuss racism in 
Congress, schools, police departments, 
and various other American institu-
tions, so why is it acceptable for the 
media to dedicate less attention to 
missing Black kids? 
We all know this is not okay, Madam 
Speaker, but the American public 
doesn’t know this is happening because 
our media is failing to cover this story. 
Every child is made in the image of 
God and legally equal under the U.S. 
Constitution. We need to dedicate all 
the time and resources we can to re-
cover missing kids, regardless of the 
color of their skin. 
HONORING TECHNICAL SERGEANT DURWARD B. 
SWANSON 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor Technical Sergeant Dur-
ward B. Swanson, a World War II vet-
eran and survivor of the Pearl Harbor 
attacks, as the Tennessee Second Dis-
trict’s Veteran of the Month. 
Swanson joined the Army Air Corps 
in 1939 and was sent to Hickam Field, 
adjacent to the Pearl Harbor Naval 
Base. He originally signed up to do 
bomber maintenance, but a sergeant 
noticed he had skills on a Harley-Da-
vidson and asked if he would head the 
air police motorcycle unit instead. He 
accepted that position, Madam Speak-
er. 
On December 7, 1941, when Japanese 
bombers attacked the airbase, Swanson 
jumped onto his motorcycle to search 
for his best friend, Albert Jackson 
‘‘Stud’’ Lloyd, who was standing in the 
middle of a ballfield shooting at the 
planes and cussing up a storm. Swan-
son drove onto the field and brought 
his friend back to safety. 
After the attack, Swanson and Lloyd 
removed the damaged flag from the 
Hickam Field flagpole and folded it to 
prevent it from being flown overnight. 
Following 
his 
service, 
Swanson 
played guitar for country music legend 
Hank Williams before deciding the 
music business wasn’t for him. That 
would be Hank Williams, Sr., if anyone 
is wondering. 
He went on to speak to schools across 
the United States and travel with 
groups to Pearl Harbor and the World 
War II Memorial in Washington. 
In June, he celebrated his 100th 
birthday at the Ben Atchley veterans’ 
home. 
There are true heroes in our country, 
and they aren’t famous athletes or 
movie stars. They are the brave men 
and women of our Armed Forces, like 
Durward Swanson. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Durward for 
his service. 
BUILD BACK BETTER THROUGH 
COMMUNITY PROJECT FUNDING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to share with you some of 
the important projects we have nomi-
nated as part of the community project 
funding process, 10 projects that will 
bring more than $8.4 million in critical 
funding to my district and which have 
now been included in the House Appro-
priations Committee’s fiscal year 2022 
funding bill. 
It is my honor to represent the resi-
dents of PA–05 in Congress, and I am 
thrilled to have secured funding for 
these projects that were submitted by 
nonprofit and government agencies in 
our region and that met the rigorous 
funding criteria laid out by Congress. 
The projects our office nominated for 
inclusion address some of the most 
pressing needs in our region: economic 
development, climate resilience, treat-
ment for opioid use disorder, and ex-
panding mental health resources. 
Each of these projects will also help 
deliver on House Democrats’ and Presi-
dent Biden’s promise to build back bet-
ter, to set the table for success for the 
American people, now and in the fu-
ture. 
Today, I would like to shine the spot-
light on two projects I am particularly 
proud of. 
The Delaware County Mobile Crisis 
teams project will provide an alter-
native response for emergency calls in-
volving people suffering from mental 
illness. For too long, our mental health 
system has been woefully underfunded. 
As a result, all too frequently, people 
living with mental illness or cognitive 
disabilities have ended up in our crimi-
nal justice system, often with fatal 
consequences. We can do better. 
Around the country, communities 
have begun to address this dearth of 
mental health resources and overreli-
ance on the criminal justice system by 
developing programs to provide alter-
natives to and diversion from arrest, 
abuse, and incarceration. 
At the Federal level, I am proud to 
have introduced the Mental Health 
Justice Act, which would make it easi-
er for State and local governments to 
develop 
these 
programs 
and 
send 
trained mental health professionals in-
stead of police when someone calls 911 
because an individual is experiencing a 
mental health crisis. 
At the local level, I am proud to sup-
port Delaware County’s application to 
fund just such a project in this year’s 
appropriations bill, a project to address 
the mental and behavioral health chal-
lenges of residents who might other-
wise find themselves in the criminal 
justice system. 
b 1045 
The county proposal will create mo-
bile crisis teams stationed with the 
county’s Emergency Services Depart-
ment. These teams will be dispatched 
in conjunction with law enforcement in 
response to requests for help for per-
sons known or suspected to be suffering 
from mental illness with the goal of di-
verting them from the criminal justice 
system into treatment with access to 
prioritized admission and to properly 
address their underlying needs. 
This 
program 
is 
a 
collaboration 
among Delaware County’s human serv-
ices, health adviser, district attorney, 
and public defender. I commend these 
county leaders for looking forward, and 
I look forward to seeing the positive 
impact mobile crisis teams can have on 
our community. 
Another project that I was proud to 
secure funding for in the fiscal year ‘22 
appropriations bill is for the restora-
tion and reopening of the historic 
Lansdowne Theater. 
The 1927 Lansdowne Theater is an 
Art Deco gem that will be rehabilitated 
into a regional concert hall and spur 
investment in the surrounding commu-
nity. The $1.5 million in Federal fund-
ing we have secured in the appropria-
tions bill will be the final dollars for 
this $15 million project so that it can 
immediately 
start 
the 
restoration 
needed to bring this community treas-
ure back to life. 
We anticipate the project will create 
51 jobs to operate the theater and 100 
permanent jobs in businesses nearby, 
in addition to over 100 jobs for the 
trades during construction. Once com-
pleted, the theater will breathe new 
economic life into the community and 
attract more arts and culture to PA–5. 
It will create opportunities for en-
hanced educational programs for area 
students through internships and ac-
cess to different genres of music. 
This transformational investment is 
integral to a broader plan to create an 
anchor in the community to restore, 
enhance, and spur economic activity in 
this part of the Baltimore Pike com-
mercial district. 
The community project funding pro-
gram is a win for the American people. 
It gives our communities the oppor-
tunity to make their case directly to 
Congress for funding to make bold, pro-
gressive investments that are exactly 
what our community and communities 
across the country need to recover and 
rebuild. 
This is what keeping a promise looks 
like. I look forward to continuing to 
fight for the people with these new in-
vestments.

Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Speaker, I

the brave men and women of Cuba.

inalienable rights. They demand free-
dom. They chant: ‘‘Libertad.’’ They 
chant: ‘‘Patria y vida.’’ And they con-
verged on the Communist Party head-
quarters responsible for 60 years of 
misery, abuse, and torture of the 
Cuban people. 
Cubans have rejected the failed ide-
ology forced upon three generations— 
the failed ideology of Marxism that has 
brought suffering to hundreds of mil-
lions around the world, the failed ide-
ology that deserves to be sent to the 
ash heap of history once and for all. 
As Communists often do, they con-
cocted a conspiracy theory to explain 
the people’s protests. The Communist 
dictator 
Miguel 
Diaz-Canel 
even 
claimed it was a U.S. plot. This is what 
Marxists do, of course. They lie. They 
will lie, they will commit violence 
against their own people, and they will 
try to suffocate the calls for freedom. 
But this movement will not be si-
lenced. It cannot. It mustn’t. For too 
long this once flourishing island has 
suffered under Communist rule, and 
now the calls for freedom must be 
heeded: freedom from oppression, free-
dom from abuse, and freedom from tyr-
anny. The downfall of this regime has 
been a long time coming. No more is it 
patria o muerte—country or death— 
but as the people across Cuba know, it 
is patria y vida—country and life. 
As Americans—as a people who have 
inherited the greatest gifts of freedom 
the world has ever known—we must 
speak with one voice against the evils 
of Marxism. We must speak truth, a 
truth that not enough Americans are 
used to hearing. Instead, we have 
American politicians who openly advo-
cate for the very same Marxist ide-
ology that Cubans would die to escape 
from. This ignorant and foolish flirta-
tion with Marxism must end, and we 
must make it clear that we will always 
support freedom-loving people around 
the world. 
Our message will be one of empower-
ment: empower the brave Cuban people 
as they begin to throw off the chains of 
Communism and seek their inalien-
able, God-given rights of life, liberty, 
personal property, and the right to pur-
sue their happiness. 
So to the men and women of Cuba, I 
say this: 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
We see you. We hear you. We are with 
you. Let us no longer shout homeland 
or death but homeland and life. And 
begin to build what we dream of. What 
they destroyed with their hands. 
Te vemos. Te oimos. Estamos con 
ustedes. Ya no gritemos patria o 
muerte sino patria y vida. Y empezar a 
construir lo que sonamos. Lo que 
destruyeron con sus manos. 
Madam Speaker, to the Communist 
regime in Cuba, I say this: Your lies 
are exposed, your foundations are 
shaken to the core, and your days are 
numbered.

Almighty God, we lift up our hearts

promise of Your endless love is better 
than the ephemeral thread of life we 
hold on to so dearly. So long as we live, 
may we praise You. 
When we gaze on Your handiwork, we 
are overwhelmed with Your glory; we 
are humbled by the span of Your exten-
sive reach. 
From Your temple, hear our voice. 
As we approach You in the sanctuary 
of Your extraordinary creation, draw 
near to You in these hallowed halls of 
freedom and justice, or discover You in 
the precious intimacy of our time with 
friends and loved ones, everywhere we 
are, we find ourselves in Your compas-
sionate presence. Give us faith to see 
Your involvement in all areas of our 
lives. And receive us with mercy when 
we 
acknowledge 
our 
powerlessness 
without You. Encourage us when our 
souls are wearied with longing for the 
peace of mind only You can provide. 
Strengthen us when our bodies are 
faint with thirst and yearning for the 
sureness found in You. 
We lift up our hands in prayer and 
call upon Your name that You would 
satisfy our needs this day.

was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, for the past 16 months, the 
United States’ border with Canada has 
been closed to nonessential travel, 
tearing loved ones apart, preventing 
people from accessing cottages that 
they own, devastating businesses and 
local economies on both sides of the 
border. 
This week, the Canadian Government 
announced plans to reopen the border 
to fully vaccinated Americans on Au-
gust 9. On January 21 of this year, we 
were promised a plan would be devel-
oped by the United States to address 
travel to Canada within 14 days. 
Madam Speaker, 180 days have now 
passed. We are still waiting for that 
plan. The United States Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention pub-
licly advised that fully vaccinated 
Americans are free to safely resume all 
pre-pandemic activity. It is time for 
the United States to align its border 
policy with the science, with the facts, 
and with the data. Action is long over-
due. Open the U.S. border to our Cana-
dian neighbors.

REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. BOST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, as a fa-
ther of three and a grandfather of 11, I 
know what the love of family feels like 
and how we love our children and when 
that child takes its first breath. 
For over 40 years, the Hyde Amend-
ment has prohibited taxpayer dollars 
from being used to fund abortion. Both 
Republicans and Democrats have sup-
ported it. However, President Biden’s 
budget plan will remove this vitally 
important protection. That is why I am 
proud to cosponsor H.R. 18, the No Tax-
payer Funding for Abortion and Abor-
tion Insurance Full Disclosure Act. 
This bill will make the Hyde Amend-
ment permanent. Today, tomorrow, 
and every day, I am proud to stand for 
life. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committees on En-
ergy and Commerce, Ways and Means, 
and the Judiciary be discharged from 
further consideration of H.R. 18 and 
ask for its immediate consideration in 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
DINGELL). Under guidelines consist-
ently issued by successive Speakers, as 
recorded in section 956 of the House 
Rules and Manual, the Chair is con-
strained not to entertain the request 
unless it has been cleared by the bipar-
tisan floor and committee leaderships.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3680 
July 20, 2021 
CHILD TAX CREDIT 
(Mr. LIEU asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, 5 days 
ago, millions of American families 
with children received Child Tax Credit 
refunds deposited directly into their 
bank account. This is hundreds of dol-
lars that they could use for childcare 
expenses, to put gas in their cars to go 
to work, and to help fuel our economy. 
This is going to happen again next 
month, and again in the middle of Sep-
tember. And these payments go out 
again the middle of October, and again 
the middle of November, and again the 
middle of December. This is critical 
lifesaving money. These are tax cuts 
directly to the American people. 
And how did this happen? It hap-
pened because every Democrat voted 
for the Child Tax Credit. Every Repub-
lican voted ‘‘no.’’ We want to give Re-
publicans another chance at this. We 
are going to try to make this Child Tax 
Credit permanent. We want this tax 
cut to the American people permanent, 
and the contrast could not be clearer. 
When Democrats are in control, we 
give tax cuts to the middle class. 
f 
BIDEN INFLATION TAX 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, inflation threatens 
American families due to the out-of- 
control spending by President Joe 
Biden. 
Biden inflation directly impacts the 
day-to-day 
well-being 
of 
American 
families. Inflation is currently rising 
at the fastest pace in 13 years. And 
Biden has proposed an irresponsible 
$3.5 trillion deal that will increase 
taxes. 
Last month, consumer prices jumped 
5.4 percent. Gas prices are up a huge 
45.1 percent, and milk is up 5.6 percent. 
What Biden doesn’t seem to realize is 
that these costs negatively affect the 
lower and middle class more than any-
one else. Wasteful spending and taxes 
will only make matters worse. Infla-
tion is Biden taxation, and the Amer-
ican families deserve better. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
God bless the courageous citizens of 
Cuba standing up for freedom and lib-
erty from the failed socialist oppres-
sors.

REMEMBERING RAMSES O. 
AGUINAGA 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, today 
I rise to remember the life of Santa 
Ana Police Officer Ramses Aguinaga, 
who was tragically taken from his fam-
ily by cancer. Ramses was a leader in 
the community where he grew up. He 
was a smart and caring person who al-
ways made an effort to understand 
each and every individual in his com-
munity. 
In high school, he played football for 
Mater Dei High School where he was a 
key player in making sure that Mater 
Dei won the Southern Section Division 
championship. 
In college, Ramses became interested 
in criminal justice and spent 16 years 
as a police officer. But his greatest ac-
complishment was the birth of his son, 
Mateus Aguinaga, and Ramses loved 
this child, loved him to death. 
Ramses passed away in peace. His 
family mourns him and will never for-
get how he brightened the lives of so 
many of his friends and neighbors 
where he grew up. He was a loving fa-
ther, a thoughtful son, a caring broth-
er, and a role model for our commu-
nity.

CONGRATULATING LUMBEE TRIB-
AL COUNCILMAN TERRY HUNT 
(Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, today I rise to con-
gratulate Lumbee Tribal Council mem-
ber, Terry Hunt, who during July’s 
council meeting was honored for nearly 
three decades of service in the U.S. 
Army and the North Carolina National 
Guard where he served as a Command 
Sergeant Major. 
During 
the 
meeting, 
Councilman 
Hunt was bestowed with the Old North 
State Award, which honors guard mem-
bers who have served at least 20 years 
and who have shown a dedication of 
service beyond expectation. He was 
also awarded the North Carolina Asso-
ciation Certificate, which honors Na-
tional Guard retirees. 
Councilman Hunt was elected to the 
Tribal Council in 2018, representing 
District 14, which includes commu-
nities in Eastern Robeson County. I am 
proud to work alongside him and the 
other members of the council as we 
pursue long-overdue Federal recogni-
tion for the Lumbee. 
Congratulations to Councilman Hunt 
on this great honor. The people of 
North Carolina are grateful for his 
service. 
f 
RISE IN CRIME 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, Amer-
ica is a nation of laws, but in many 
parts of our country, the rule of law is 
under attack. At a time when the Na-
tion should be reopening and healing, 
we see rising crime in many cities 
across America. And where this rise of 
crime is most prevalent is in cities 
that have decreased funding for its offi-
cers. 
In 2020, we saw the highest number of 
murders in over 25 years. And now in 
2021, we have seen a spike in violent 
crime and attacks against law enforce-
ment officers. The Defund the Police 
movement has been the catalyst behind 
this rise in crime and attacks on our 
law enforcement. It has fueled hatred 
against our fellow citizens who risk 
their lives to protect us from crime. 
And sadly, there are many progressive 
members in this Chamber who have 
supported this dangerous movement. 
The first step in addressing the in-
crease in crime is not banning guns 
from law-abiding citizens as proposed 
by the President. Rather, we must re-
ject the Defund the Police movement 
and ask those that support it to recog-
nize its disastrous impacts on our com-
munities. 
f 
TRANSATLANTIC ENERGY 
SECURITY 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, as co-
chair of the bipartisan Congressional 
Ukraine Caucus, I rise to express my 
deep concern on the issue of trans-
atlantic energy security. The Kremlin 
and complicit European nations are 
seeking to complete the Nord Stream 2 
Pipeline. This Russian malign influ-
ence project will increase Vladimir 
Putin’s leverage in Europe and disrupt 
the NATO alliance. 
Current news reports indicate that a 
deal between the Biden administration 
and Germany is imminent. According 
to these reports, there is little in the 
deal that will prevent Russia’s capac-
ity to coerce our allies. Congress un-
derstands history’s key lesson: When 
Germany and Russia collude, the peo-
ple of Central and Eastern Europe pay 
the price. 
Congress has now voted twice on an 
overwhelming bipartisan basis to sanc-
tion the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. These 
sanctions are mandatory, not discre-
tionary. Given the administration’s 
abuse of the sanctions waiver, I was 
pleased the Committee on Appropria-
tions unanimously adopted my bipar-
tisan amendment to repeal the waivers 
moving forward. While I look forward 
to reviewing the deal, the Congress—as 
Article I of the Constitution man-
dates—must reject any deal that fails 
to prioritize energy security in the 
transatlantic alliance.

COMMUNITY SERVICE BLOCK 
GRANTS 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1

block grants have been vital to pro-
viding

needed to address poverty and expand 
opportunities for children and families. 
CSBG is a targeted program with 
strong oversight and a solid track 
record of success. And because no two 
communities are the same, CSBG gives 
organizations the flexibility to create 
new and locally tailored solutions. 
CSBG is also bipartisan. This year, I 
was honored to join with more than 100 
House Members from both sides of the 
aisle to advocate for an increase in 
funding to the program. More resources 
will allow great organizations in my 
community, like the Mohawk Valley 
Community Action Agency, to improve 
and increase their services. 
For over 50 years, MVCAA has served 
the residents of Oneida, Herkimer, and 
Madison Counties providing important 
services, and supporting education, em-
ployment, childcare, and family needs. 
In 2018 alone, they assisted 9,210 indi-
viduals, including 3,649 children. 
I am so grateful that the Committee 
on Appropriations met our fiscal year 
2021 requests of $800 million for CSBG, 
which will ensure that even more fami-
lies and children have access to the 
tools they need to realize their poten-
tial. 
I thank my good friend, ranking 
member of the Committee on Appro-
priations, TOM COLE, as well as Chair-
woman ROSA DELAURO for their leader-
ship and commitment to this program.

RECOGNIZING THOMAS GILMAN 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
young man in my district who will rep-
resent Iowa on the world stage. 
Thomas Gilman, a University of Iowa 
alumni, has qualified for the U.S. 
Olympic team for freestyle wrestling 
and will be competing in this summer’s 
Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, later 
this month. 
As a former Hawkeye, Thomas was a 
force to be reckoned with in the 125- 
pound weight division, finishing his ca-
reer in Iowa City with an impressive 
record of 107–12 and a Big Ten Con-
ference title. He was also named the 
Outstanding Wrestler of the 2017 Mid-
lands Championships. 
His other athletic accomplishments 
include a silver medal at the World 
Wrestling Championships in Paris in 
2017 and another silver medal at the 
U.S. National Championships in Las 
Vegas in 2019. 
I wish Thomas the best of luck as he 
goes on to represent the great State of 
Iowa and the United States in the 
Olympic Games. Bring home the gold. 
f 
HELP CUBAN PEOPLE ORGANIZE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, the 
Communist Party is afraid. They are 
seeing their ideas collapse. They are 
seeing that people will no longer wait 
for the countless empty promises of the 
Castro years to be fulfilled. 
This is why we are seeing thousands 
of unarmed protesters being arrested, 
beaten, and killed all across the island 
of Cuba. 
If the Communist Party of Cuba had 
their way, if they were successful in 
blocking the communications of their 
people as they intended to do with 
their power outages and censorship, 
then we wouldn’t even be able to see 
these abuses. 
Cuba’s Communist Government has 
had 62 years to prove that it could pro-
vide health, housing, education, work, 
food, and security to its people. In-
stead, we see buildings collapsing on 
the heads of Cuban citizens. We see 
that the government provided food full 
of gravel. We see security forces firing 
live rounds into crowds that are not al-
lowed to be armed. 
The White House needs to act soon to 
help the Cuban people organize and 
communicate freely, and let the rest of 
the world know what is really hap-
pening only 90 miles from our border. 
Where is the United Nations? 
I call on President Biden to unblock 
and expand uncensored internet access. 
We have the technology to do it now 
and guarantee cellular service to their 
island. 
The embargo is not the problem. Peo-
ple need to be liberated. They are polit-
ical prisoners. Provide independent and 
free press. 
Madam Speaker, which of these do 
the Cuban people not deserve? 
f 
VOTING RIGHTS SHOULD NOT BE 
DENIED 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I want to rise today to inform everyone 
who might be listening that the fili-
buster is not in this little book that 
has governed this great Nation, the 
Constitution of the United States. 
In fact, the 15th Amendment, as it re-
lates to voting, says: ‘‘The right of citi-
zens of the United States to vote 
should not be denied or abridged by the 
United States or any State on account 
of race, color, or previous condition of 
servitude,’’ which means we should 
move forward with certain things. 
One, we need to move forward with 
the infrastructure bill. We must move 
forward with the budget and budget 
reconciliation. We must ensure that 
voting rights are protected in this Na-
tion. Again, the filibuster is not a con-
stitutional provision, and therefore, we 
must govern. 
Madam Speaker, I want to express 
my knowledge and concern of the 
crime and violence across America. It 
is facing us in Houston as well. I was 
delighted to bring almost a million dol-
lars to help our victims of crimes and 
the victim advocates program for HPD. 
It is time now to stand up for America.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BARRAGA´ N) and the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1870, the Strengthening 
Local Transportation Security Capa-
bilities Act of 2021. 
This legislation I introduced seeks to 
improve information sharing between 
the Department of Homeland Security 
and State and local law enforcement in 
areas with high-risk surface transpor-
tation assets. 
This bill will enhance security in two 
key ways. 
First, it requires DHS to prioritize 
the assignment of officers and intel-
ligence analysts to State, local, and re-
gional fusion centers in jurisdictions 
with a high-risk surface transportation 
asset. To mitigate threats to our crit-
ical surface transportation assets, we 
must ensure that intelligence regard-
ing threats to surface transportation 
are shared with appropriate stake-
holders in a timely manner. This im-
portant provision meets that mission, 
improving the chances of preventing 
the next attack. 
Second, the bill authorizes DHS to 
develop a training program to enhance 
the protection, preparedness, and re-
sponse capabilities of law enforcement 
agencies that operate at surface trans-
portation 
assets. 
Surface 
transpor-
tation systems are unique in their lay-
outs and use, and this training would 
improve law enforcement capabilities 
in these settings in a manner that pro-
tects civil rights and liberties. 
Considering the increase in terrorist 
attacks in recent years against mass 
transit systems, bus stations, and pas-
senger rail systems, it is crucial that 
timely information be shared with 
local law enforcement and security 
personnel at transit centers. These sur-
face transportation systems are crit-
ical to our way of life, and an attack 
against one could be devastating. 
Enactment of H.R. 1870 would be a 
significant step toward ensuring we are 
prepared to mitigate such risk by sup-
plying DHS and State and local law en-
forcement with the resources they need 
to meet this homeland security chal-
lenge. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1870, the Strengthening 
Local Transportation Security Capa-
bilities Act of 2021. 
It is simply not enough for our Fed-
eral Government to be prepared for an 
attempted terrorist attack. We must 
ensure that our State and local part-
ners are prepared as well. 
Nowhere else is this more apparent 
than in the case of surface transpor-
tation. This legislation ensures that 
the Federal Government is providing 
sufficient 
information, 
intelligence, 
and training to State and local part-
ners to better defend surface transpor-
tation assets. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to join me in supporting H.R. 1870, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
have no more speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close after the gentleman 
from New York closes. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers. I urge Members to 
support this bill, and I congratulate 
my colleague on it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1870 is a timely 
measure, as attackers remain intent on 
targeting surface transportation sys-
tems at this time of heightened threat. 
Enacting H.R. 1870 will improve in-
formation sharing among DHS and 
State and local law enforcement agen-
cies, increasing our ability to stop or 
significantly decrease the harm caused 
by such attacks. 
Madam Speaker, for this reason, I 
urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
1870, and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 1893, the Trans-
portation Security Preparedness Act of 
2021. 
Since the start of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, more than 8,200 TSA employees 
have contracted coronavirus. Trag-
ically, 17 hardworking frontline work-
ers have lost their lives. 
While TSA has taken steps to shield 
its workers and adjust security oper-
ations 
during 
the 
pandemic, 
its 
COVID–19 response was ranked low in 
employee surveys. More must be done 
to make sure TSA is adequately pre-
pared for future disease outbreaks. 
H.R. 1893 directs TSA to apply the 
lessons learned from the COVID–19 pan-
demic to protect its workforce and the 
traveling public during future disease 
outbreaks. 
To do so, TSA is required to survey 
its workforce in more detail regarding 
pandemic response to ascertain areas 
for improvement that can be inte-
grated into a transportation security 
preparedness 
plan 
for 
future 
pandemics. Specifically, the survey 
will examine TSA’s efforts to commu-
nicate clearly with its workforce, pro-
tect employees with personal protec-
tive equipment, adjust workplace poli-
cies, engage in contact tracing, and fa-
cilitate 
COVID–19 
vaccinations 
for 
workers. 
TSA is then directed to integrate the 
information it collects into a transpor-
tation security preparedness plan that 
sets forth how TSA will respond to fu-
ture pandemics, including how it will 
protect its workforce, communicate 
and collaborate with public and private 
entities, and adjust checkpoint oper-
ations to maintain security without 
compromising health and safety. 
TSA is also required to assess what 
barriers remain to its ability to re-
spond to the next disease outbreak. 
H.R. 1893 will ensure that TSA will be 
able to respond quickly and effectively 
to prevent the next disease outbreak. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1893, the Transportation 
Security Preparedness Act of 2021. 
Our dedicated TSA workforce is crit-
ical in protecting our Nation’s trans-
portation system. This legislation will 
ensure that the voices of those front-
line workers who have served tirelessly 
during the COVID–19 pandemic are 
heard as TSA improves its prepared-
ness and protection of the transpor-
tation system in the face of future pub-
lic health threats. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to join me in supporting H.R. 1893. 
Madam Speaker, I have no further 
speakers. I urge Members to support 
the bill of my good friend, BONNIE WAT-
SON COLEMAN, the sponsor of the bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, as the American 
people return to air travel in greater 
numbers, it is essential that TSA plan 
for the future and use the lessons we 
have learned during COVID–19 to en-
sure that TSA responds more quickly 
and effectively to the next major pub-
lic health crisis. 
H.R. 1893 will allow TSA to reflect on 
the successes and the missteps of the 
past year and a half and create a con-
crete plan of action to protect workers 
and passengers. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1893, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
BARRAGA´ N) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1893. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 1895, the Trans-
portation 
Security 
Public 
Health 
Threat Preparedness Act of 2021. 
Protecting our Nation’s transpor-
tation workforce and the traveling 
public is front of mind as we attempt 
to emerge from the COVID–19 pandemic 
with 
the 
looming 
threat 
of 
new 
variants of the virus. 
H.R. 1895 seeks to ensure U.S. trans-
portation systems are better prepared 
for public health threats by having 
TSA conduct a study on public health 
risks in concert with other agencies 
within the Department of Homeland 
Security, the Department of Health 
and Human Services, and industry 
stakeholders. 
Specifically, this bill enhances these 
efforts, requiring TSA to assess the 
risk of public health threats to the Na-
tion’s transportation security systems 
and analyze the agency’s preparedness 
to respond to them. 
The bill also allows TSA to reassign 
personnel not engaged in frontline 
transportation security efforts to other 
government agencies to improve inter-
governmental 
coordination 
and 
re-
sponse efforts. 
I applaud my colleague from Florida 
(Mr. GIMENEZ) for this timely legisla-
tion that prioritizes the health and 
safety of the traveling public and 
frontline transportation workers, and I 
urge my colleagues to support this leg-
islation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 1895, the Trans-
portation 
Security 
Public 
Health 
Threat Preparedness Act of 2021. 
The COVID–19 pandemic tested every 
aspect of our Nation’s infrastructure. 
The nature of a global pandemic has 
brought into focus the impact that 
transportation systems can have on 
the 
spread 
or 
control 
of 
such 
pandemics. 
This legislation, sponsored by my 
friend and colleague, Mr. GIMENEZ, en-
sures that the risks of the COVID–19 
pandemic are analyzed by TSA and 
that it takes the appropriate steps to 
be prepared should another public 
health emergency ever occur. 
Given the importance of the trans-
portation system in the economy and 
everyday life of this country, it is para-
mount that the Federal Government 
ensure better preparedness and resil-
ience of the system. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to join me in support of H.R. 1895. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
GIMENEZ). 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my legislation, 
H.R. 1895, the Transportation Security 
Public 
Health 
Threat 
Preparedness 
Act. This is an important piece of leg-
islation that will help ensure Amer-
ica’s transportation systems are better 
prepared 
for 
future 
public 
health 
threats. The current COVID–19 pan-
demic has only further underscored the 
importance of keeping our TSA officers 
safe. 
Specifically, this bill directs TSA to 
conduct an analysis of looming public 
health risks to all components of our 
transportation systems, working with 
the Chief Medical Officer at the De-
partment of Homeland Security, the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services, and its transportation stake-
holders. The analysis will describe 
TSA’s security checkpoint policies and 
procedures to protect TSA personnel, 
passengers, aviation workers, and air-
port personnel from public health 
threats. 
Additionally, this bill instructs TSA 
to brief Congress on this analysis fol-
lowing its conclusion so that we may 
rectify or codify any important rec-
ommendations so we can protect our 
officers and our transportation systems 
from public health risks. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues who joined me on this legisla-
tion, and I urge the House to swiftly 
pass this bill. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, I urge Members to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, enactment of H.R. 
1895 will support our efforts to mitigate 
future public health threats to our Na-
tion’s transportation systems. 
We have witnessed the daunting ef-
fects of the pandemic over the past 
year and must be prepared for future 
public health threats to avoid repeat-
ing the same tragedies again. 
Ensuring TSA is equipped with the 
right information on public health 
threats and prepared to combat them 
with interagency coordination will be 
essential to protecting our transpor-
tation system, transportation workers, 
and the traveling public. This bill fur-
thers that effort. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1895, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 1877, the Secu-
rity Screening During COVID–19 Act. 
This legislation, introduced by my 
colleague from Missouri (Mr. CLEAVER), 
directs the Transportation Security 
Administration to issue a plan to re-
duce the spread of the COVID–19 virus 
at passenger screening checkpoints and 
among the TSA workforce. 
To date, over 8,200 TSA employees 
have 
tested 
positive 
for 
the 
coronavirus, and tragically, 17 workers 
have died from the disease. 
As Americans begin to travel again, 
we must take steps to guarantee the 
safety of critical frontline workers and 
air passengers from the dangers posed 
by the virus, including the delta vari-
ant and other variants that could come 
our way. 
Under H.R. 1877, the TSA Adminis-
trator would coordinate with the De-
partment of Homeland Security’s Chief 
Medical Officer, the Department of 
Health and Human Services, and the 
CDC to develop a plan that identifies 
best practices among foreign govern-
ments, airports, air carriers, and other 
Federal agencies regarding COVID–19. 
Together, they will pinpoint specific 
operational challenges that TSA can 
make to further reduce the spread of 
the coronavirus at airports across the 
Nation, building on the actions TSA 
has taken over the past year. 
COVID–19 has made it clear that pub-
lic health is a global issue that re-
quires a global response. That is why 
the United States must work with our 
international partners on how best to 
stop the spread of disease in transpor-
tation security settings, end this pan-
demic, and prevent future outbreaks. 
TSA routinely participates in the 
international exchange of information 
to enhance global aviation security, 
share its expertise, and reduce threats 
across the globe. 
Given the unprecedented challenge of 
the COVID–19 pandemic to today’s air 
travel environment, TSA must cap-
italize on its international partner-
ships to identify new ways to enhance 
its security operations and contain this 
virus. H.R. 1877 will push TSA to do 
just that to protect the workforce and 
passengers. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1877, the Security Screen-
ing During COVID–19 Act. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has tested 
our Nation’s preparedness on many 
fronts. Like in so many other areas, it 
is important that we emerge from this 
pandemic stronger than when it start-
ed. This legislation seeks to make our 
aviation security more resilient by re-
quiring TSA to develop a plan for 
screening operations during the pan-
demic. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
join me in supporting H.R. 1877. I con-
gratulate my colleague and friend from 
Missouri (Mr. CLEAVER). 
Madam Speaker, I have no further 
speakers, I urge Members to support 
this bill and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1877 received 
unanimous support in our committee 
because it is a commonsense legisla-
tion that will keep Americans safe. The 
coronavirus pandemic is not yet over, 
and TSA must work with national and 
international partners to implement 
new strategies to stop the spread of 
disease and prepare for the future. 
The 
Security 
Screening 
During 
COVID–19 Act will push TSA to build 
upon its current efforts to ensure the 
agency is doing everything possible to 
protect the workforce and passengers. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1877, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
BARRAGA´ N) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1877, as 
amended. 
The question was taken.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1871, the Transportation 
Security Transparency Improvement 
Act. This bipartisan legislation, as in-
troduced by my colleague from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP), will ensure con-
sistent standards and improve proce-
dures for designating sensitive security 
information at TSA. 
Sensitive 
security 
information, 
known as SSI, is information that if 
publicly released would be detrimental 
to transportation security. Just like 
with classified information, those who 
are granted access to SSI have a spe-
cial obligation to safeguard it and face 
penalties if they fail to do so. Given 
these stakes, it is important that TSA 
apply consistent standards when desig-
nating SSI. This bill will not only re-
quire TSA to maintain those clear 
standards, but also develop a schedule 
to regularly review its SSI guidelines, 
develop a tracking mechanism for SSI 
redaction challenges, and conduct addi-
tional outreach with aviation stake-
holders on SSI guidelines. These re-
forms will improve transparency at 
TSA. 
H.R. 1871 has the potential to en-
hance TSA’s work to secure last- 
points-of-departure airports by requir-
ing TSA to include air carriers and 
other stakeholders in the development 
of security directives and emergency 
amendments affecting such airports 
and to engage with foreign partners on 
their implementation. 
By including industry and inter-
national perspectives in this process, 
H.R. 1871 will ensure TSA’s efforts to 
secure flights from foreign airports are 
effective. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 1871, the Trans-
portation Security Transparency Im-
provement Act. Clarity and trans-
parency are important everywhere in 
government, and the TSA is no excep-
tion. This bill will ensure that TSA 
creates a more consistent and trans-
parent system for determining what 
qualifies as sensitive security informa-
tion, or SSI. It further requires TSA to 
work 
closely 
with 
transportation 
stakeholders in the development, re-
view, and implementation of new re-
quirements, known as security direc-
tives, or SDs, and emergency amend-
ments, or EAs. 
It is critical that TSA works hand in 
glove with our transportation industry 
to ensure the safest, most efficient 
travel for all Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to join me in supporting H.R. 1871, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
have no other speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close after the gentleman 
from New York closes. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
The Transportation Security Trans-
parency Improvement Act is a com-
monsense solution to strengthen na-
tional security and promote commu-
nication with stakeholders. Involving 
stakeholders in policymaking is the 
most effective way to implement trust-
worthy and efficient decisions. As any 
stakeholder will tell you, information 
sharing is critical. 
My bill will improve consistency in 
TSA’s designation and redaction of ma-
terials as sensitive security informa-
tion, as well as address the security di-
rective 
and 
emergency 
amendment 
process and its impacts on inter-
national aviation security. My bill will 
also ensure clear and consistent des-
ignations and emphasize TSA’s out-
reach with carriers and local law en-
forcement 
to 
promote 
information 
sharing. 
Finally, the Transportation Security 
Transparency Improvement Act will 
instruct the TSA Administrator to im-
plement guidelines to ensure all secu-
rity and safety measures are being 
met. This legislation will undoubtedly 
improve aviation security by ensuring 
TSA clearly communicates critical se-
curity information to transportation 
security stakeholders. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I urge Mem-
bers to support this bill. I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
The Transportation Security Trans-
parency Improvement Act is a bipar-
tisan and commonsense bill that will 
improve TSA’s operations. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1871, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I

vise and extend their remarks and to

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

There was no objection. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the Department of 
Homeland Security’s Blue Campaign is 
dedicated to raising awareness about 
the often-concealed crime of human 
trafficking. Each year, there are thou-
sands of victims of human trafficking 
in the U.S. with numbers steadily in-
creasing over the last 20 years. Traf-
fickers subject their victims to forced 
labor, debt bondage, or sexual exploi-
tation by using violence, manipulation, 
or false promises. 
The DHS Blue Campaign works to 
combat this crime by educating law en-
forcement and the public on how to 
recognize the signs of human traf-
ficking. Through outreach to local 
communities, industry partners, and 
law enforcement authorities, the Blue 
Campaign seeks to build on a founda-
tion of human trafficking prevention 
and protection. 
The tactics and techniques that 
human traffickers use are evolving. It 
is crucial for the Federal Government 
to foster awareness in a sustained way 
and educate Americans on the indica-
tors of human trafficking to identify 
victims. 
H.R. 2795, the DHS Blue Campaign 
Enhancement Act, would build upon 
the existing Blue Campaign by focusing 
on enhancing human trafficking pre-
vention training opportunities and im-
proving 
the 
development 
of 
such 
trainings and material. Specifically, 
H.R. 2795 would create an advisory 
board which brings together represent-
atives throughout DHS to provide guid-
ance on recruitment tactics used by 
human traffickers and inform the de-
velopment of awareness tools. 
It would also require the Blue Cam-
paign to create web-based training vid-
eos to reach the widest possible audi-
ence of law enforcement officers and 
correction system personnel, among 
others. H.R. 2795 has bipartisan support 
and was reported out of committee by 
unanimous consent. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time.

COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 
Washington, DC, May 18, 2021. 
Hon. BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: This letter is 
to advise you that the Committee on the Ju-
diciary has now had an opportunity to re-
view the provisions in H.R. 2795, the ‘‘DHS 
Blue Campaign Enhancement Act,’’ that fall 
within our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate 
your consulting with us on those provisions. 
The Judiciary Committee has no objection 
to your including them in the bill for consid-
eration on the House floor, and to expedite 
that consideration is willing to forgo action 
on H.R. 2795, with the understanding that we 
do not thereby waive any future jurisdic-
tional claim over those provisions or their 
subject matters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees. 
Sincerely,

DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: Thank you for 
your letter regarding H.R. 2795, the ‘‘DHS 
Blue Campaign Enhancement Act.’’ I recog-
nize that the Committee on the Judiciary 
has a jurisdictional interest in H.R. 2795, and 
I appreciate your effort to allow this bill to 
be considered on the House floor. 
I concur with you that forgoing action on 
the bill does not in any way prejudice the

its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or 
similar legislation in the future, and I would 
support your effort to seek appointment of 
an appropriate number of conferees to any 
House-Senate conference involving this leg-
islation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3689 
July 20, 2021 
with you on this legislation and other mat-
ters of great importance to this Nation. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman, 
Committee on Homeland Security. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2795, the DHS Blue Cam-
paign Enhancement Act. As vice-rank-
ing member of the Homeland Security 
Committee, I know how important it is 
for us to approach protecting this great 
Nation in a comprehensive manner by 
tackling all types of threats, including: 
hackers, terrorists, violent criminals, 
and human traffickers. 
Criminal organizations use human 
trafficking to fund their operations by 
defrauding, coercing, and exploiting 
both adults and children, forcing them 
into labor and commercial sex acts. 
The DHS Blue Campaign enables and 
empowers the DHS workforce and cus-
tomer-facing 
industries 
they 
work 
with—industries such as airlines—to 
recognize the indicators of human traf-
ficking and take the proper steps to 
alert authorities. 
H.R. 2795 enhances the Department’s 
existing training opportunities by de-
veloping internet-based training pro-
grams to train Federal, State, local, 
Tribal law enforcement officers, and 
others as part of the Department’s 
Blue Campaign. This important piece 
of legislation also established the Blue 
Campaign Advisory Board within the 
Department to coordinate Blue Cam-
paign efforts and work cohesively to 
combat human trafficking. 
Empowering State and local law en-
forcement 
to 
recognize 
potential 
human trafficking is the first step in 
helping them assist these victims, 
many of whom have been told that 
they have broken the law and can’t 
seek police assistance by their traf-
fickers. H.R. 2795 does this and helps 
disrupt these criminal networks, which 
is an important component in disman-
tling criminals and the terrorists fi-
nancing their acts around the world. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
MEIJER for his leadership, and Chair-
man THOMPSON for moving this legisla-
tion out of committee, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this important 
bill to further secure the homeland. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
have no more speakers, and I am pre-
pared to close after the gentleman 
from Mississippi closes. I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. MEIJER). 
Mr. MEIJER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 2795, the DHS Blue 
Campaign Enhancement Act. This bill, 
which I am proud to have introduced 
with my colleague, the chairman of the 
Homeland Security Subcommittee on 
Oversight, Management, and Account-
ability, Representative CORREA, has 
one very specific goal, to combat 
human trafficking. 
According to the Department of 
State’s Trafficking in Persons Report, 
every year, around the world tens of 
thousands of men, women, and children 
are trafficked, including far too many 
right here in the United States. Human 
traffickers use fraud and coercion to 
compel people into situations of forced 
labor or sexual exploitation. False 
promises of well-paying jobs, romantic 
relationships, and violence are all 
methods used by human traffickers. 
Victims can be any age, race, gender, 
or nationality and from any socio-
economic background. 
To curb this horrific practice, we 
must use a multipronged approach, and 
a critical component to this strategy is 
ensuring that law enforcement per-
sonnel and employees in customer-fac-
ing industries are trained to identify a 
potential victim of human trafficking 
by recognizing key indicators and tak-
ing appropriate action. 
DHS started the Blue Campaign in 
2010 to do just that; to unify and co-
ordinate Department efforts to address 
human trafficking. The Blue Campaign 
enables and empowers the DHS work-
force and the industries they work 
with—including airlines and the pub-
lic—to recognize the indicators of 
human trafficking and take steps to 
alert the appropriate authorities. 
My bill, the DHS Blue Campaign En-
hancement Act, bolsters these efforts 
by creating an advisory board to in-
form and coordinate training among 
the DHS components to increase the ef-
ficiency and effectiveness of the train-
ing that DHS provides for its per-
sonnel, its industries, and State and 
local law enforcement partners. 
This legislation also increases the 
online trainings that DHS will provide, 
enabling the Department to reach a 
broader audience more quickly. 
I would like to thank my good friend 
from California (Mr. CORREA) for join-
ing me in this effort and supporting 
this important piece of legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to approve this bill and help 
DHS do its part to combat human traf-
ficking. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I urge Mem-
bers to support this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, DHS is uniquely po-
sitioned to address human trafficking 
through the Blue Campaign. H.R. 2795 
seeks to build upon the success of the 
Blue Campaign, which was first estab-
lished in August 2010, and to bolster 
human trafficking awareness by ensur-
ing that public-facing materials re-
main as current and accessible as pos-
sible. This is a worthwhile endeavor. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage of 
the bill, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
BARRAGA´ N) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2795, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I

Madam Speaker, the recent Colonial 
Pipeline, JBS, and Kaseya ransomware 
attacks have brought the Nation’s at-
tention to the tremendous national se-
curity threat posed by ransomware. 
The Colonial Pipeline breach alone

large portion of the Nation and con-
tributed to gas shortages across much 
of the Southeast. It also spurred con-
versations about how much of our Na-
tion’s critical infrastructure is pri-
vately owned and operated. 
Lost on many Americans is how 
much vulnerable critical infrastructure 
is actually in the public sector. Today, 
emergency services, public schools, 
hospitals, and agencies involved in pro-
viding essential services or regulating 
important industries are all housed in 
our State and local governments. In re-
cent years, we have seen communities, 
big and small, that lacked dedicated 
cybersecurity resources fall victim to 
ransomware attacks. 
The types of incidents we have seen 
include a ransomware attack on Balti-
more that cost city taxpayers $18 mil-
lion; a hack on the D.C. police depart-
ment that resulted in leaked sensitive 
personnel files; and a cyberattack 
against a Massachusetts school district 
that forced it to cancel its first day of 
in-person instruction earlier this year. 
In May, my subcommittee held a 
hearing 
on 
the 
ransomware 
crisis 
where experts shared their views on the 
policy solutions that the Federal Gov-
ernment can consider to address this 
challenge. Our witnesses uniformly 
urged greater investment in preven-
tion, particularly at the State and 
local levels. 
We cannot just focus on responding 
to cyber incidents. We must help our 
communities reduce their vulnerability 
and better mitigate incidents when 
they occur. 
In the long term, front-end cyberse-
curity investments save money, pro-
tect infrastructure, and prevent disrup-
tion to our economy and in our com-
munities. 
That is why I introduced the State 
and Local Cybersecurity Improvement 
Act. It authorizes $500 million annually 
for grants to State, local, territorial, 
and Tribal governments to upgrade 
their cybersecurity. It requires States 
to pay a graduated cost share to 
incentivize them to budget better for 
cybersecurity, and it requires them to 
develop cybersecurity plans so we en-
sure these funds are well-spent. 
My bill also requires DHS to create a 
plan to improve the cybersecurity pos-
ture of State and local governments to 
ensure that States have goals and ob-
jectives to which they align their own 
cybersecurity plans. 
We have spent considerable resources 
enhancing the security of our Federal 
networks, and President Biden’s recent 
executive order, along with invest-
ments included in the American Rescue 
Plan, demonstrate a continued com-
mitment to strengthening Federal cy-
bersecurity. 
These actions are incredibly impor-
tant, but we need to do more to address 
the vulnerabilities at the State and 
local levels, where there has been inad-
equate investment in cybersecurity for 
years. 
It is essential for the Federal Govern-
ment to be a partner in protecting 
State and local digital infrastructure. 
As Congress considers ways to invest in 
our Nation’s infrastructure, State and 
local digital infrastructure must be a 
part of that conversation. 
As we have seen in recent months, 
the gap between the digital world and 
the physical one is smaller than ever. I 
appreciate the bipartisan recognition 
of that and the strong support this in-
vestment in our infrastructure security 
received in the Homeland Security 
Committee. 
In particular, I want to thank Chair-
man 
THOMPSON, 
Ranking 
Member 
KATKO, Ranking Member GARBARINO, 
and 
Representatives 
MCCAUL, 
RUP-
PERSBERGER, KILMER, and SLOTKIN for 
cosponsoring this legislation. 
By passing the State and Local Cy-
bersecurity Improvement Act today, 
we can demonstrate to the American 
people that Congress can work in a bi-
partisan way to make a meaningful dif-
ference in addressing our Nation’s cy-
bersecurity risk. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this important bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 3138, the State and Local 
Cybersecurity 
Improvement 
Act 
of 
2021. 
I thank Chairwoman CLARKE, Chair-
man 
THOMPSON, 
Ranking 
Member 
GARBARINO, and my other committee 
colleagues for their leadership on H.R. 
3138. 
Over the past year, we have seen the 
devastating impact a ransomware at-
tack can have on our Nation’s most 
critical infrastructure. But we must 
not forget that no one is immune from 
cyber criminals, including our State 
and local governments. 
I am pleased today that the House is 
taking action to give our State and 
local partners, and CISA, a leg up 
against these cyber criminals. 
This bill will have a tremendous im-
pact on the cybersecurity posture of 
State and local governments by focus-
ing important funding and expertise on 
the front lines, the State and local lev-
els. 
I urge all Members to join me in sup-
porting H.R. 3138, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman from New 
York for her leadership on the Sub-
committee on Cybersecurity, Infra-
structure Protection, and Innovation. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to support the 
State and Local Cybersecurity Im-
provement Act. 
I particularly emphasize the fact 
that we are the United States of Amer-
ica, but the cyberattacks occur in our 
neighborhoods, our hamlets, our cities, 
our counties, and our States. They 
occur right under our noses, and they 
impact our constituents by taking 
their personal records from the Texas 
Medical Center, for example, impacting 
the medical care of people, interfering 
with various diagnostic machines, and 
dealing with the energy infrastructure, 
such as the Colonial Pipeline incident. 
These are happening in our neighbor-
hoods. 
The State and Local Cybersecurity 
Improvement Act will make $500 mil-
lion available in grants from the De-
partment of Homeland Security to 
State, local, and Tribal entities over 
the next 4 years as they address crit-
ical cybersecurity risks facing infor-
mation systems. 
I will soon rise to the floor on legisla-
tion that I have authored, and I will 
make this point, Madam Speaker: It is 
crucial that the other body begins to 
address the legislation that this House 
is able to pass because we are passing 
innovative, corrective, and needed leg-
islation. 
Cyber is not a joke, if I can say that. 
Neither are the attacks on our cyber 
infrastructure. 
However, the Department of Home-
land Security was created in 2002 to 
bring together the expertise of several 
different government entities to pro-
tect against foreign threats. At that 
time, the Nation’s main concern was 
protecting our citizens and residents 
from another large-scale terrorist at-
tack, one that we had never seen be-
fore: attacking tall buildings with air-
planes. We had never seen it. 
But, today, 2021, is not 2001. It is not 
20 years ago, and the landscape of ter-
rorism has changed enormously. With 
rapid advancement in technology and 
malign foreign cyber aggression in na-
tion-states that are not engaged, this 
bill is important. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to support this bipartisan legislation, 
H.R. 3138, that will provide us a way to 
address this issue. 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I urge 
Members to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, while cybersecurity 
threats are not new, this year has high-
lighted the serious impact cyber inci-
dents can have on our national secu-
rity. 
The United States has as much cy-
bersecurity expertise as any country. 
But without adequate resources, State 
and local governments cannot imple-
ment the policies and practices we 
know will make their digital infra-
structure more secure. 
Enactment of the State and Local 
Cybersecurity Improvement Act will 
ensure that they have the funding, 
planning, and support to adequately in-
vest in securing government networks 
and reducing risk. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 3138, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1833, the DHS Industrial Control 
Systems 
Capabilities 
Enhancement 
Act. 
This bill seeks to give the Cybersecu-
rity and Infrastructure Security Agen-
cy, or CISA, a stronger hand in secur-
ing industrial control systems and 
would help to clarify its central coordi-
nation role across the Federal Govern-
ment. 
b 1315 
The importance of securing indus-
trial control systems cannot be over-
stated. We rely on these systems to 
provide vital services, like water treat-
ment, energy distribution, and critical 
manufacturing. 
As control systems have grown more 
and more connected to business and IT 
networks that rely on the internet, we 
have seen systems become more vul-
nerable to cyberattacks. 
Industrial control systems have been 
targeted by groups closely aligned with 
nation-states like China and Russia 
who seek to undermine the United 
States and advance their own geo-
political interests. 
We have also seen criminal groups, 
like 
the 
perpetrators 
of 
the 
ransomware attack on the Colonial 
Pipeline, create great economic disrup-
tion while extorting companies. 
It doesn’t take a criminal master-
mind to infiltrate an industrial envi-
ronment, either. Earlier this year, an 
unsophisticated, unknown perpetrator 
was able to breach a water treatment 
plant in Oldsmar, Florida, and manipu-
late chemical levels in ways that could 
have poisoned nearby residents. 
H.R. 1833 will strengthen CISA’s au-
thority as the lead Federal coordinator 
for securing industrial control systems 
and empower CISA to hunt for threats, 
respond to incidents, and to promote 
strong cybersecurity for critical infra-
structure. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity has been working on control sys-
tem security since 2004. H.R. 1833 rec-
ognizes that role at a pivotal time as 
cyber threats to critical infrastructure 
reach new heights. 
Importantly, this bill also includes a 
GAO review of whether CISA has the 
resources, staffing, and authorities it 
needs to effectively implement these 
provisions. Such oversight will be key, 
given that these systems are complex, 
diverse, and there are a limited number 
of skilled cyber experts capable of se-
curing them. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 1833, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I want to thank my colleague from 
New York for supporting my bill, H.R.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3696 
July 20, 2021 
1833, the DHS Industrial Control Sys-
tems Capabilities Enhancement Act of 
2021. 
As I have said from day one as rank-
ing member of this committee, we need 
to continue to bolster cybersecurity 
capabilities at CISA to defend our Fed-
eral networks and the Nation’s critical 
infrastructure from cyber threats. 
The volume of cyberattacks and 
ransomware 
attacks 
in 
2021 
alone 
shows that no one is immune from na-
tion-state cyber actors or cyber crimi-
nals. 
Cyber 
threats, 
particularly 
ransomware, are the preeminent na-
tional security threat facing our Na-
tion today. From Colonial Pipeline to a 
local water facility in Florida, we have 
witnessed the real-world consequences 
cyberattacks can have on our critical 
infrastructure. 
In the cyberattack against a water 
treatment plant in Florida, hackers 
were able to gain access to industrial 
control systems, or ICS for short, and 
attempted to alter the mixture of 
water chemicals to what could have 
been catastrophic fatal levels. 
Cyber incidents are very rarely sec-
tor specific. CISA is a central agency 
that can quickly connect the dots when 
a malicious cyber campaign spans mul-
tiple sectors. It is vital that we con-
tinue to enhance its visibility across 
the critical infrastructure ecosystem. 
This bill requires the CISA director 
to maintain capabilities to detect and 
mitigate threats and vulnerabilities af-
fecting automated control of critical 
infrastructure, particularly industrial 
control systems. 
This includes maintaining cross-sec-
tor incident response capabilities to re-
spond to cybersecurity incidents and 
providing cybersecurity technical as-
sistance to stakeholders. 
We must continue to solidify CISA’s 
lead role in protecting our Nation’s 
critical 
infrastructure 
from 
cyber 
threats, 
particularly 
the 
industrial 
control systems that underpin vital 
components of our daily lives. 
This bill is one step in the commit-
tee’s continued efforts to build up 
CISA’s authorities and resources to ef-
fectively carry out its mission, and it 
is a resounding statement to have such 
heavy-hitting, bipartisan support. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to join me in supporting H.R. 1833, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, 
and I am prepared to close after the 
gentleman from New York closes. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers. I urge Members to 
support this bill. I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time to close. 
I would like to start by thanking the 
gentleman from New York for his out-
standing leadership in this regard. 
Industrial control systems are a rich 
target for cyber adversaries looking to 
disrupt, extort, and simply wreak 
havoc. These systems underpin the 
functions and services we rely on for 
our day-to-day lives, and the threats 
they face have never been higher. 
Successful disruption of one of these 
systems could have dire consequences 
for public health and safety, public 
confidence, and even the national and 
economic 
security 
of 
the 
United 
States. 
CISA is well-positioned to help own-
ers and operators better understand 
risks to operational technology and 
work with them to close security gaps. 
I again want to congratulate the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO), 
my committee colleague and ranking 
member, on authoring this bill to cod-
ify the role that CISA plays in leading 
Federal efforts to secure industrial 
control systems. 
Enactment of H.R. 1833 will help to 
raise our cybersecurity posture across 
the board. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
CLARKE) that the House suspend the

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. CLARKE) and the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, 5 years ago a Gov-
ernment Accountability Office survey 
found that 12 out of 12 Federal agencies 
used obsolete information technology. 
In other words, 12 out of 12 Federal 
agencies were using software or hard-
ware for which vendors no longer pro-
vided support, updates, or patches. 
The Federal Government is hardly 
alone. It has been widely reported that 
State and local governments and crit-
ical infrastructure owners and opera-
tors across the country rely on legacy 
technology. 
We have seen malicious cyber actors 
wreak havoc by exploiting known vul-
nerabilities. 
H.R. 2980 would authorize CISA to de-
velop and distribute playbooks to pro-
vide procedures and mitigation strate-
gies for the most critical, known vul-
nerabilities, especially those affecting 
software or hardware that is no longer 
supported by a vendor. The playbooks 
would be available to Federal agencies, 
industry, and other stakeholders. 
The bill, as introduced by the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE), 
also authorizes the Department of 
Homeland Security Science and Tech-
nology Directorate, in consultation 
with CISA, to establish a competition 
program for industry, individuals, aca-
demia, and others to provide remedi-
ation solutions for cybersecurity vul-
nerabilities that are no longer sup-
ported. 
Importantly, in response to recent 
cyberattacks, H.R. 2980 prioritizes ef-
forts to address vulnerabilities of in-
dustrial control systems of critical in-
frastructure that may be targeted, like 
water systems and pipelines. 
H.R. 2980 is no substitute for invest-
ing in new technology, but it will pro-
vide important support to government 
and private sector entities that cannot 
replace legacy technology or rapidly 
patch known vulnerabilities because of 
resource limitations or other system 
complications. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support H.R. 2980, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 2980, the Cybersecurity 
Vulnerability 
Remediation 
Act. 
I 
would like to thank the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON
LEE), my 
friend, for being a staunch advocate of 
CISA and these important cybersecu-
rity issues. I look forward to con-
tinuing to work with her and my other 
colleagues on the preeminent national 
security 
threat 
facing 
our 
Nation 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
join me in supporting H.R. 2980, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman from New 
York for her leadership, and I thank 
the ranking member of the full com-
mittee and the chair of the full com-
mittee for bringing these matters to 
the attention of the Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
my bill, H.R. 2980, the Cybersecurity 
Vulnerability Remediation Act, which 
authorizes the Department of Home-
land Security to take actions to 
counter cybersecurity vulnerabilities 
in our Nation’s critical infrastructure. 
Interestingly enough, when we intro-
duced this bill some years ago, we 
called it the zero-day bill, which was to 
presuppose what would happen when 
everything collapsed. When we intro-
duced it, it was before the Colonial 
Pipeline, it was before the Solaris at-
tack, it was before knowing about the 
gangs in Russia, cyber gangs that pro-
liferate before the activity of China. 
I thank Chairman THOMPSON
and 
Ranking Member KATKO for their lead-
ership in putting the security of our 
Nation’s cyber access first, whether 
they are computing resources used in 
voting technology or industrial control 
systems that support delivery of elec-
tricity, oil, and gas, or management of 
transportation systems that are vital 
to our Nation’s economic health. 
The Cybersecurity Vulnerability Re-
mediation Act was introduced, as I 
said, and passed the House during the 
115th and 116th Congresses and has 
been updated again in the 117th Con-
gress to meet the ever-evolving nature 
of cyber threats faced by Federal and 
private sector information systems and 
our Nation’s critical infrastructure. 
As I said before, it will be very im-
portant that the other body seriously 
considers the cyber threats against 
this Nation. This bill goes significantly 
further than the first cybersecurity 
vulnerability act that I introduced in 
the 115th Congress to address the in-
stance of zero-day events that can lead 
to catastrophic cybersecurity failures 
of information and computing systems. 
It is estimated that 85 percent of 
critical infrastructure is owned by the 
private sector, and for far too long this 
fact has hampered efforts to establish 
stronger requirements for cybersecu-
rity by owners and operators. 
Private sector critical infrastructure 
failure due to a cyberattack is no 
longer a private matter when it can 
have massive impacts on the public, 
such as disruption of gasoline flowing 
to filling stations, which we saw re-
cently. 
My bill, the Cybersecurity Vulner-
ability Remediation Act, will expand

b 1330 
H.R. 2980 bolsters the efforts to en-
gage critical infrastructure owners and 
operators in communicating cybersecu-
rity threats and lays the foundation for 
greater 
transparency 
on 
the 
real 
threats posed by cyberterrorists to pri-
vate and government sector critical in-
frastructure and information systems, 
which impact the people of this Nation. 
This legislation allows the science 
and technology director, in consulta-
tion with CISA, to establish an incen-
tive-based program that allows indus-
try, individuals, academia, and others 
to compete in identifying remediation 
solutions for cybersecurity vulnerabili-
ties to information systems and indus-
trial control systems, including super-
visory control and data acquisition 
systems. 
This bill, when it becomes law, will 
put our Nation’s best minds to work on 
closing the vulnerabilities that cyber 
thieves and terrorists use to access, 
disrupt, corrupt, or take control of 
critical infrastructure information sys-
tems. 
In addition to these changes, the bill 
requires a report to Congress that may 
contain a classified annex. 
The report will provide information 
on how DHS coordinates cybersecurity 
vulnerability disclosures and dissemi-
nates actionable protocols to mitigate 
cybersecurity vulnerabilities involving 
information systems and industrial 
systems. 
Congress needs to know how preva-
lent 
and 
persistent 
cybersecurity 
threats targeting critical infrastruc-
ture and information systems might 
be, especially if those threats result in 
a payment of ransom. They need to 
know about a payment of ransom. 
Paying a ransom for ransomware 
emboldens and encourages bad cyber 
actors and places everyone at greater 
risk for the financial and societal costs 
of increases in threats as others seek 
payouts. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an 
additional 1 minute. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
as long as there is silence about 
cyberattacks 
like 
ransomware, 
the 
criminals and terrorists will remain 
out of reach and continue to feel safe 
and emboldened in carrying out these 
attacks, often from the soil of our en-
emies or peer competitors. 
I applaud and thank the Biden ad-
ministration for its quick action in re-
sponding to the attack against Colo-
nial Pipeline, but it did shut down the 
whole East Coast, and he did it by an 
executive order. 
Today, our Nation is in a cybersecu-
rity crisis. The attacks against Fed-
eral, State, local, territorial, and Trib-
al Governments, as well as threats 
posed to private information systems 
and critical information systems make 
this bill necessary. 
So I am hoping, along with those who 
have been attacked, like the Metropoli-
tan Police Department, the medical 
system in Houston—the gang known as 
the Babuk group released thousands of 
Metropolitan Police sensitive docu-
ments, and it goes on and on. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD
four articles regarding this 
issue.

TURNING UP THE HEAT: A RANSOMWARE AT-
TACK ON CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS
A 
NIGHTMARE SCENARIO 
(By Richard Tracy, Forbes Councils Member) 
Ransomware attacks in 2020 were up more 
than 150% compared to the previous year, 
while ransomware payments were up over 
300%. 
Over the past six months, we’ve seen a 
number of ransomware attacks against crit-
ical infrastructure—from a water treatment 
facility to a gas pipeline and multiple food 
distribution companies—all of which present 
clear and present danger to society. The im-
pact was so dire—with recent research find-
ing over seven ransomware attacks per 
hour—that the Department of Justice ele-
vated ransomware attacks to a similar pri-
ority as terrorism. 
The recent Colonial Pipeline hack, in par-
ticular, appears to have struck a nerve, as 
there is finally discussion about cybersecu-
rity standards for the pipeline industry. 
That would be a good start and one that is 
long overdue considering the importance of 
fuel distribution for our economy and overall 
way of life. 
However, the oil and gas industry is just 
one element in a single critical infrastruc-
ture sector—the energy sector. DHS has de-
fined sixteen critical infrastructure sectors, 
and each is deemed critical for the proper 
functioning of our society. Due to the con-
nected nature of everything these days, each 
sector is a potential cyber target. Disruption 
to any critical infrastructure segment has 
potentially dire economic, safety and na-
tional security consequences. As such, it 
only makes sense to address cybersecurity 
risk management for all sectors, not just oil 
and gas. 
The threat goes beyond the pipeline. 
To better understand the need to focus on 
all critical infrastructure, let’s look at the 
power grid. Imagine a ransomware attack 
against the power grid that services highly 
populated areas in the desert southwest. 
Now, imagine this attack takes place during 
the hottest part of the summer. 
Think about the heat-related deaths that 
would likely occur and the impact on med-
ical supplies that require refrigeration. Yes, 
there are generator backups in hospitals 
where supplies are stored, but we already 
know from the pipeline hack that the fuel 
needed to run these generators can be dis-
rupted too. It’s also important to note that 
hospitals, also considered critical infrastruc-
ture, have also suffered from ransomware at-
tacks. In fact, hospitals have had an even 
bigger target on their backs in recent 
months. The connected nature of our critical 
infrastructure compounds the problem and 
potential impacts. 
To further illustrate how important the 
power grid is to our citizens, Protect Our 
Power, an independent, non-profit advocacy 
and educational organization focused solely 
on driving increased resilience of the U.S. 
electric grid to attacks, recently conducted 
a public opinion poll of 1,095 Americans. 
Most notably, the study found: 
86 percent of Americans are concerned that 
the 
grid 
is 
vulnerable 
to 
a 
serious 
cyberattack. 
70 percent say they would feel unsafe in 
the event of an extended power outage of two 
weeks or more. 
66 percent believe their quality of life will 
suffer from an outage lasting more than 
seven days. 
64 percent say they are unprepared for an 
extended power outage that will last more 
than two weeks. 
70 percent say the infrastructure bill 
should include funding to address this impor-
tant issue. 
Only 16 percent believe the federal govern-
ment is doing all it can to prevent an attack 
on the grid. 
As most Americans agree, the federal gov-
ernment can and should do more to help se-
cure all of our critical infrastructures. 
Recent ransomware attacks against crit-
ical infrastructure help us understand stand-
ards and practices that would have helped. 
For example, multi-factor authentication 
(MFA), a widely recognized best practice, 
may have prevented the Colonial Pipeline 
hack. According to GAO, greater and more 
consistent adoption of the NIST CSF, which 
was specifically developed to help critical in-
frastructure manage cyber risk, would ben-
efit cyber risk management efforts across all 
critical infrastructure sectors. 
In summary, we need to secure all critical 
infrastructure sectors. The power grid exam-
ple used here illustrates how dire the con-
sequences could be. It’s time to move. Sum-
mer is upon us, and the desert southwest is 
getting hot.

U.S. FORMALLY ACCUSES CHINA OF HACKING 
MICROSOFT 
(By Zolan Kanno-Youngs, David E. Sanger) 
WASHINGTON.—The Biden administration 
on Monday formally accused the Chinese 
government of breaching Microsoft email 
systems used by many of the world’s largest 
companies, governments and military con-
tractors, as the United States joined a broad 
group of allies, including all NATO members, 
to condemn Beijing for cyberattacks around 
the world. 
The United States accused China for the 
first time of paying criminal groups to con-
duct 
large-scale 
hackings, 
including 
ransomware attacks to extort companies for 
millions of dollars, according to a statement 
from the White House. Microsoft had pointed 
to hackers linked to the Chinese Ministry of 
State Security for exploiting holes in the 
company’s email systems in March; the U.S. 
announcement on Monday morning was the 
first suggestion that the Chinese government 
hired criminal groups to hack tens of thou-
sands of computers and networks around the

world for ‘‘significant remediation costs for 
its mostly private sector victims,’’ according 
to the White House. 
Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said 
in a statement on Monday that China’s Min-
istry of State Security ‘‘has fostered an eco-
system of criminal contract hackers who 
carry out both state-sponsored activities and 
cybercrime for their own financial gain.’’ 
‘‘These contract hackers cost governments 
and businesses billions of dollars in stolen 
intellectual property, ransom payments, and 
cybersecurity mitigation efforts, all while 
the MSS had them on its payroll,’’ Mr. 
Blinken said. 
Condemnation from NATO and the Euro-
pean Union is unusual, because most of their 
member countries have been deeply reluc-
tant to publicly criticize China, a major 
trading partner. But even Germany, whose 
companies were hit hard by the hacking of 
Microsoft Exchange—email systems that 
companies maintain on their own, rather 
than putting them in the cloud—cited the 
Chinese government for its work. 
‘‘We call on all states, including China, to 
uphold their international commitments and 
obligations and to act responsibly in the 
international system, including in cyber-
space,’’ according to a statement from 
NATO. 
Despite the broadside, the announcement 
lacked sanctions similar to ones that the 
White House imposed on Russia in April, 
when it blamed the country for the extensive 
SolarWinds attack that affected U.S. govern-
ment agencies and more than 100 companies. 
(The Justice Department on Friday did 
unseal an indictment from May charging for 
Chinese residents with a campaign to hack 
computer systems of dozens of companies, 
universities and government entities in the 
United States between 2011 and 2018. The 
hackers developed front companies to hide 
any role the Chinese government had in 
backing the operation, according to the Jus-
tice Department.) 
By imposing sanctions on Russia and orga-
nizing allies to condemn China, the Biden ad-
ministration has delved deeper into a digital 
Cold War with its two main geopolitical ad-
versaries than at any time in modern his-
tory. 
While there is nothing new about digital 
espionage from Russia and China—and ef-
forts by Washington to block it—the Biden 
administration has been surprisingly aggres-
sive in calling out both countries and orga-
nizing a coordinated response. 
But so far, it has not yet found the right 
mix of defensive and offensive actions to cre-
ate effective deterrence, most outside ex-
perts say. And the Russians and the Chinese 
have grown bolder. The SolarWinds attack, 
one of the most sophisticated ever detected 
in the United States, was an effort by Rus-
sia’s lead intelligence service to alter code in 
widely used network-management software 
to gain access to more than 18,000 businesses, 
federal agencies and think tanks. 
China’s effort was not as sophisticated, but 
it took advantage of a vulnerability that 
Microsoft had not discovered and used it to 
conduct espionage and undercut confidence 
in the security of systems that companies 
use for their primary communications. It 
took the Biden administration months to de-
velop what officials say is ‘‘high confidence’’ 
that the hacking of the Microsoft email sys-
tem was done at the behest of the Ministry 
of State Security, the senior administration 
official said, and abetted by private actors 
who had been hired by Chinese intelligence. 
The last time China was caught in such 
broad-scale surveillance was in 2014, when it 
stole more than 22 million security-clear-
ance files from the Office of Personnel Man-
agement, allowing a deep understanding of 
the lives of Americans who are cleared to 
keep the nation’s secrets. 
President Biden has promised to fortify the 
government, making cybersecurity a focus of 
his summit meeting in Geneva with Presi-
dent Vladimir V. Putin of Russia last month. 
But his administration has faced questions 
about how it will also address the growing 
threat from China, particularly after the 
public exposure of the Microsoft hacking. 
Speaking to reporters on Sunday, the sen-
ior administration official acknowledged 
that the public condemnation of China would 
only do so much to prevent future attacks. 
‘‘No one action can change China’s behav-
ior in cyberspace,’’ the official said. ‘‘And 
neither could just one country acting on its 
own.’’ 
But the decision not to impose sanctions 
on China was also telling: It was a step many 
allies would not agree to take. 
Instead, the Biden administration settled 
on corralling enough allies to join the public 
denunciation of China to maximize pressure 
on Beijing to curtail the cyberattacks, the 
official said. 
The joint statement criticizing China, to 
be issued by the United States, Australia, 
Britain, Canada, the European Union, Japan 
and New Zealand, is unusually broad. It is 
also the first such statement from NATO 
publicly targeting Beijing for cybercrimes. 
The European Union condemned on Mon-
day ‘‘malicious cyberactivities’’ undertaken 
from the Chinese territory but stopped short 
of denouncing the responsibility of the Chi-
nese government. 
‘‘This irresponsible and harmful behavior 
resulted in security risks and significant 
economic our loss for government institu-
tions and private companies, and has shown 
significant spillover and systemic effects for 
our security, economy and society at large,’’ 
Josep Borrell Fontelles, the E.U.’s foreign 
policy chief, said in a statement. ‘‘These ac-
tivities can be linked to the hacker groups,’’ 
the statement added. 
Mr. Borrell called on Chinese authorities 
not to allow ‘‘its territory to be used’’ for 
such activities, and to ‘‘take all appropriate 
measures and reasonably available and fea-
sible steps to detect, investigate and address 
the situation.’’ 
The National Security Agency, F.B.I. and 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Agency also issued an advisory on Monday 
warning that Chinese hacking presented a 
‘‘major threat’’ to the United States and its 
allies. China’s targets include ‘‘political, 
economic, military, and educational institu-
tions, as well as critical infrastructure.’’ 
Criminal groups hired by the government 
aim to steal sensitive data, critical tech-
nologies and intellectual properties, accord-
ing to the advisory. 
The F.B.I. took an unusual step in the 
Microsoft hacking: In addition to inves-
tigating the attacks, the agency obtained a 
court order that allowed it to go into 
unpatched corporate systems and remove 
elements of code left by the Chinese hackers 
that could allow follow-up attacks. It was 
the first time that the F.B.I. acted to reme-
diate an attack as well as investigate its per-
petrators.

PIPELINE ATTACK YIELDS URGENT LESSONS 
ABOUT U.S. CYBERSECURITY 
(By David E. Sanger, Nicole Perlroth) 
For years, government officials and indus-
try executives have run elaborate simula-
tions of a targeted cyberattack on the power 
grid or gas pipelines in the United States, 
imagining how the country would respond. 
But when the real, this-is-not-a-drill mo-
ment arrived, it didn’t look anything like 
the war games. 
The attacker was not a terror group or a 
hostile state like Russia, China or Iran, as 
had been assumed in the simulations. It was 
a criminal extortion ring. The goal was not 
to disrupt the economy by taking a pipeline 
offline but to hold corporate data for ran-
som. 
The most visible effects—long lines of 
nervous motorists at gas stations—stemmed 
not from a government response but from a 
decision by the victim, Colonial Pipeline, 
which controls nearly half the gasoline, jet 
fuel and diesel flowing along the East Coast, 
to turn off the spigot. It did so out of con-
cern that the malware that had infected its 
back-office functions could make it difficult 
to bill for fuel delivered along the pipeline or 
even spread into the pipeline’s operating sys-
tem. 
What happened next was a vivid example of 
the difference between tabletop simulations 
and the cascade of consequences that can fol-
low even a relatively unsophisticated attack. 
The aftereffects of the episode are still play-
ing out, but some of the lessons are already 
clear, and demonstrate how far the govern-
ment and private industry have to go in pre-
venting and dealing with cyberattacks and 
in creating rapid backup systems for when 
critical infrastructure goes down. 
In this case, the long-held belief that the 
pipeline’s operations were totally isolated 
from the data systems that were locked up 
by DarkSide, a ransomware gang believed to 
be operating out of Russia, turned out to be 
false. And the company’s decision to turn off 
the pipeline touched off a series of dominoes 
including panic buying at the pumps and a 
quiet fear inside the government that the 
damage could spread quickly. 
A confidential assessment prepared by the 
Energy and Homeland Security Departments 
found that the country could only afford an-
other three to five days with the Colonial 
pipeline shut down before buses and other 
mass transit would have to limit operations 
because of a lack of diesel fuel. Chemical fac-
tories and refinery operations would also 
shut down because there would be no way to 
distribute what they produced, the report 
said. 
And while President Biden’s aides an-
nounced efforts to find alternative ways to 
haul gasoline and jet fuel up the East Coast, 
none were immediately in place. There was a 
shortage of truck drivers, and of tanker cars 
for trains. 
‘‘Every fragility was exposed,’’ Dmitri 
Alperovitch, a co-founder of CrowdStrike, a 
cybersecurity firm, and now chairman of the 
think tank Silverado Policy Accelerator. 
‘‘We learned a lot about what could go 
wrong. Unfortunately, so did our adver-
saries.’’ 
The list of lessons is long. Colonial, a pri-
vate company, may have thought it had an 
impermeable wall of protections, but it was 
easily breached. Even after it paid the extor-
tionists nearly $5 million in digital currency 
to recover its data, the company found that 
the process of decrypting its data and turn-
ing the pipeline back on again was agoniz-
ingly slow, meaning it will still be days be-
fore the East Coast gets back to normal. 
‘‘This is not like flicking on a light 
switch,’’ Mr. Biden said Thursday, noting 
that the 5,500-mile pipeline had never before 
been shut down. 
For the administration, the event proved a 
perilous week in crisis management. Mr. 
Biden told aides, one recalled, that nothing 
could wreak political damage faster than tel-
evision images of gas lines and rising prices, 
with the inevitable comparison to Jimmy 
Carter’s worse moments as president. 
Mr. Biden feared that, unless the pipeline 
resumed operations, panic receded and price 
gouging was nipped in the bud, the situation

would feed concerns that the economic re-
covery is still fragile and that inflation is 
rising. 
Beyond the flurry of actions to get oil 
moving on trucks, trains and ships, Mr. 
Biden published a long-gestating executive 
order that, for the first time, seeks to man-
date changes in cybersecurity. 
And he suggested that he was willing to 
take steps that the Obama administration 
hesitated to take during the 2016 election 
hacks—direct action to strike back at the 
attackers. 
‘‘We’re also going to pursue a measure to 
disrupt their ability to operate,’’ Mr. Biden 
said, a line that seemed to hint that United 
States 
Cyber 
Command, 
the 
military’s 
cyberwarfare force, was being authorized to 
kick DarkSide off line, much as it did to an-
other ransomware group in the fall ahead of 
the presidential election. 
Hours later, the group’s internet sites went 
dark. By early Friday, DarkSide, and several 
other ransomware groups, including Babuk, 
which has hacked Washington D.C.’s police 
department, announced they were getting 
out of the game. 
DarkSide alluded to disruptive action by 
an unspecified law enforcement agency, 
though it was not clear if that was the result 
of U.S. action or pressure from Russia ahead 
of Mr. Biden’s expected summit with Presi-
dent Vladimir V. Putin. And going quiet 
might simply have reflected a decision by 
the ransomware gang to frustrate retaliation 
efforts by shutting down its operations, per-
haps temporarily. 
The Pentagon’s Cyber Command referred 
questions to the National Security Council, 
which declined to comment. 
The episode underscored the emergence of 
a new ‘‘blended threat,’’ one that may come 
from cybercriminals, but is often tolerated, 
and sometimes encouraged, by a nation that 
sees the attacks as serving its interests. 
That is why Mr. Biden singled out Russia— 
not as the culprit, but as the nation that 
harbors more ransomware groups than any 
other country. 
‘‘We do not believe the Russian govern-
ment was involved in this attack, but we do 
have strong reason to believe the criminals 
who did this attack are living in Russia,’’ 
Mr. Biden said. ‘‘We have been in direct com-
munication with Moscow about the impera-
tive for responsible countries to take action 
against these ransomware networks.’’ 
With DarkSide’s systems down, it is un-
clear how Mr. Biden’s administration would 
retaliate further, beyond possible indict-
ments and sanctions, which have not de-
terred Russian cybercriminals before. Strik-
ing back with a cyberattack also carries its 
own risks of escalation. 
The administration also has to reckon 
with the fact that so much of America’s crit-
ical infrastructure is owned and operated by 
the private sector and remains ripe for at-
tack. 
‘‘This attack has exposed just how poor our 
resilience is,’’ said Kiersten E. Todt, the 
managing director of the nonprofit Cyber 
Readiness Institute. ‘‘We are overthinking 
the threat, when we’re still not doing the 
bare basics to secure our critical infrastruc-
ture.’’ 
The good news, some officials said, was 
that Americans got a wake-up call. Congress 
came face-to-face with the reality that the 
federal government lacks the authority to 
require the companies that control more 
than 80 percent of the nation’s critical infra-
structure adopt minimal levels of cybersecu-
rity. 
The bad news, they said, was that Amer-
ican adversaries—not only superpowers but 
terrorists and cybercriminals—learned just 
how little it takes to incite chaos across a 
large part of the country, even if they do not 
break into the core of the electric grid, or 
the operational control systems that move 
gasoline, water and propane around the 
country. 
Something as basic as a well-designed 
ransomware attack may easily do the trick, 
while offering plausible deniability to states 
like Russia, China and Iran that often tap 
outsiders for sensitive cyberoperations. 
It remains a mystery how DarkSide first 
broke into Colonial’s business network. The 
privately held company has said virtually 
nothing about how the attack unfolded, at 
least in public. It waited four days before 
having any substantive discussions with the 
administration, 
an 
eternity 
during 
a 
cyberattack. 
Cybersecurity experts also note that Colo-
nial Pipeline would never have had to shut 
down its pipeline if it had more confidence in 
the separation between its business network 
and pipeline operations. 
‘‘There should absolutely be separation be-
tween data management and the actual oper-
ational technology,’’ Ms. Todt said. ‘‘Not 
doing the basics is frankly inexcusable for a 
company that carries 45 percent of gas to the 
East Coast.’’ 
Other pipeline operators in the United 
States deploy advanced firewalls between 
their data and their operations that only 
allow data to flow one direction, out of the 
pipeline, and would prevent a ransomware 
attack from spreading in. 
Colonial Pipeline has not said whether it 
deployed that level of security on its pipe-
line. Industry analysts say many critical in-
frastructure operators say installing such 
unidirectional gateways along a 5,500-mile 
pipeline can be complicated or prohibitively 
expensive. Others say the cost to deploy 
those safeguards are still cheaper than the 
losses from potential downtime. 
Deterring ransomware criminals, which 
have been growing in number and brazenness 
over the past few years, will certainly be 
more difficult than deterring nations. But 
this week made the urgency clear. 
‘‘It’s all fun and games when we are steal-
ing each other’s money,’’ said Sue Gordon, a 
former principal deputy director of national 
intelligence, and a longtime C.I.A. analyst 
with a specialty in cyber issues, said at a 
conference held by The Cipher Brief, an on-
line intelligence newsletter. ‘‘When we are 
messing with a society’s ability to operate, 
we can’t tolerate it.’’

Government IT, May 20, 2021] 
HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE 
ADVANCES SLATE OF CYBERSECURITY BILLS 
(By Lamar Johnson) 
The House Homeland Security Committee 
voted May 18 to advance five bills that would 
look to improve the nation’s cybersecurity 
in several areas, including protecting pipe-
line infrastructure, testing cybersecurity 
readiness, and improving state and local cy-
bersecurity, among others. 
The bills to advance out of committee in-
cluded the Pipeline Security Act, the CISA 
(Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
Agency) Cyber Exercise Act, and the State 
and Local Cybersecurity Improvement Act. 
Also advanced out of committee were the Cy-
bersecurity Vulnerability Remediation Act, 
introduced by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D- 
Tex., and the Domains Critical to Homeland 
Security Act, introduced by Rep. John 
Katko, R-N.Y., the ranking member on the 
committee. 
‘‘Since the beginning of this Congress, this 
Committee has engaged in extensive over-
sight of these events and how the Federal 
government partners with others to defend 
our networks,’’ Chairman Bennie Thompson, 
D-Miss., said in a release. ‘‘The legislation 
we reported today was the result of this 
oversight. I am pleased that they received 
broad bipartisan support and hope they are 
considered on the House floor in short 
order.’’ 
The Pipeline Security Act was reintro-
duced by Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver, D-Mo. just 
a day before advancing out of committee, 
with the Colonial Pipeline ransomware at-
tack still top of mind. If passed, it will cod-
ify CISA and the Transportation Security 
Agency’s responsibilities in protecting pipe-
lines from cyberattacks and terrorist at-
tacks. 
‘‘The Colonial Pipeline ransom ware at-
tack that shut down one [of] our nation’s 
largest pipelines and triggered fuel shortages 
across the northeast has brought new ur-
gency to our work to protect the country’s 
critical infrastructure. This attack also fol-
lows a string of disturbing cyberattacks 
against government entities and the private 
sector,’’ Thompson said. 
The CISA Cyber Exercise Act would au-
thorize and require CISA to establish a Na-
tional Cyber Exercise Program responsible 
for testing the nation’s cyber readiness. The 
bill was introduced by Elissa Slotkin, D- 
Mich., and would direct the agency to create 
a set of exercises that states, local govern-
ments, and private sector businesses could 
use to test their cyber readiness. 
State and local governments get a win 
with the advancement of the State and Local 
Cybersecurity Improvement Act. The bill 
was reintroduced by Rep. Yvette Clarke, D- 
N.Y., on May 12, and a similar version passed 
in the House in the last Congress. The bill 
would direct the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS) to create a $500 million-per- 
year grant program to incentivize state and 
local governments to work to improve their 
cybersecurity. 
The committee also advanced two bills 
aimed at protecting critical infrastructure 
and the supply chain after a recent spate of 
cyberattacks exposed vulnerabilities in the 
cybersecurity of each. 
Rep. Lee’s Cybersecurity Vulnerability Re-
mediation Act would authorize CISA to work 
with the owners and operators of critical in-
frastructure on mitigation strategies around 
known and critical vulnerabilities. Rep. 
Katko’s Domains Critical to Homeland Secu-
rity Act would direct DHS to do research and 
development around supply chain risks in 
domains that are critical to the nation’s 
economy. It would then be required to sub-
mit that report to Congress. 
The next step for all these bills is a vote on 
the full House floor. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I ask my colleagues to support this leg-
islation because there is a known list 
of these attacks from the ISS World to 
the $50 million paid. I ask my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I ask my friends in the other body, to 
pass this legislation so it becomes law. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2980, ‘‘The Cybersecurity Vulnerability Reme-
diation Act,’’ which authorizes the Department 
of Homeland Security to take actions to 
counter cybersecurity vulnerabilities in our na-
tion’s critical infrastructure. 
I thank Chairman THOMPSON and Ranking 
Member KATKO for their leadership in putting 
the security of our nation’s cyber assets first, 
whether they are computing resources used in 
voting technology or industrial control systems 
that support the delivery of electricity, oil and 
gas, or management of transportation systems 
that are vital to our nation’s economic health.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3701 
July 20, 2021 
The Cybersecurity Vulnerability Remediation 
Act was introduced and passed the House 
during the 115th and 116th Congresses and 
has been updated again in the 117th Con-
gress to meet the ever-evolving nature of 
cyber threats faced by federal and private sec-
tor information systems and our nation’s crit-
ical infrastructure. 
This bill goes significantly further than the 
first Cybersecurity Vulnerability bill that I intro-
duced in the 115th Congress, to address the 
instance of Zero Day Events that can lead to 
catastrophic cybersecurity failures of informa-
tion and computing systems. 
It is estimated that eighty-five percent of crit-
ical infrastructure is owned by the private sec-
tor and for far too long this fact has hampered 
efforts to establish stronger requirements for 
cybersecurity by owners and operators. 
Private sector critical infrastructure failure 
due to a cyberattack is no longer a private 
matter when it can have massive impacts on 
the public such as the disruption of gasoline 
flowing to filling stations. 
The Jackson Lee Cybersecurity Vulnerability 
Remediation Act will: 
Expand the definition of security vulnerability 
to include cybersecurity vulnerability; 
Adds sharing mitigation protocols to counter 
cybersecurity vulnerabilities; 
Establish protocols to counter cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities involving information systems 
and industrial control systems, which will in-
clude vulnerabilities related to software, or 
hardware that is no longer supported by a 
vendor; 
Direct the Under Secretary for the DHS Of-
fice of Science and Technology to standup a 
competition to find solutions to known cyber-
security vulnerabilities; and 
Provide greater transparency on how the 
Department of Homeland Security’s Cyberse-
curity and Information Security Agency (CISA) 
is coordinating cybersecurity vulnerability dis-
closures through the sharing of actionable pro-
tocols to mitigate cybersecurity vulnerabilities 
with information systems and industrial control 
systems owners and operators. 
H.R. 2890 bolsters the efforts to engage 
critical infrastructure owners and operators in 
communicating cybersecurity threats; and lays 
the foundation for greater transparency on the 
real threats posed by cyberterrorist to private 
and government sector critical infrastructure 
and information systems. 
The legislation allows the Science the Tech-
nology Directorate in consultation with CISA to 
establish an incentive based program that al-
lows industry, individuals, academia, and oth-
ers to compete in identifying remediation solu-
tions for cybersecurity vulnerabilities to infor-
mation systems and industrial control systems 
including supervisory control and data acquisi-
tion systems. 
This bill when it becomes law would put our 
nation’s best minds to work on closing the 
vulnerabilities that cyber-thieves and terrorists 
to use them to access, disrupt, corrupt, or take 
control of critical infrastructure and information 
systems. 
In addition to these changes, the bill re-
quires a report to Congress that may contain 
a classified annex. 
The report will provide information on how 
DHS: 
Coordinates cybersecurity vulnerability dis-
closures; and 
Disseminates actionable protocols to miti-
gate cybersecurity vulnerabilities involving in-
formation system and industrial systems. 
Congress needs to know how prevalent and 
persistent cybersecurity threats targeting crit-
ical infrastructure and information systems 
might be, especially if those threats result in a 
payment of ransom. 
Paying 
a 
ransom 
for 
ransomware 
emboldens and encourages bad cyber actors 
and places everyone at greater risk for the fi-
nancial and societal costs of increases in 
threats as other seek payouts. 
As long as there is silence about cyber-at-
tacks like ransomware the criminals and ter-
rorists will remain out of reach and continue to 
feel safe in carrying out these attacks often 
from the soil of our enemies or peer competi-
tors. 
A company cannot stand up to Russia or 
China, but the United States can and has 
done so to protect our national interest. 
I applaud and thank the Biden Administra-
tion for its quick action to respond to the at-
tack against Colonial Pipeline in issuing a new 
Executive Order. 
Today, our nation is in a cybersecurity cri-
sis. 
My concern regarding the security of infor-
mation networks began in 2015 when the Of-
fice of Personnel Management’s data breach 
resulted in the theft of millions of sensitive per-
sonnel records on federal employees. 
The attacks against federal, state, local, ter-
ritorial, and tribal governments, as well as 
threats posed to private information systems, 
and critical infrastructure systems makes this 
bill necessary. 
On May 13, 2021 it was reported that the 
DC Metropolitan Police Department had expe-
rienced the worst reported cyberattack against 
a police department in the United States. 
The gang, known as the Babuk group, re-
leased thousands of the Metropolitan Police 
Department’s sensitive documents on the dark 
web because the department would not pay. 
Cyberthreats are not limited to information 
related to government employees. 
In February 2021, a cyberattack on an 
Oldsmar, Florida water treatment facility in-
volved increasing the levels of sodium hydrox-
ide from 100 parts per million to 11,100 parts 
per million in drinking water. 
However, the levels of this chemical in the 
water produced by Oldsmar, Florida was in-
creased to levels that would cause harm to 
people if they drank or used it. 
This is just one example of how terrorists 
can attack critical infrastructure and cause 
threats to health, safety and life. 
Cyber terrorists and cyber criminals are also 
motivated to attack information networks in ex-
change for money. 
The sources of revenue from cyberattacks 
has moved from demands of payment for 
thieves not to release information—to the sale 
of stolen information on the dark web and now 
to a sophisticated denial of service attack in 
the form of ransomware that locks a system 
using encryption until the victim pays. 
A list of known ransomware attacks in 2020 
that are suspected of paying ransoms, in-
cluded: 
ISS World (Denmark) paid an estimated 
cost: $74 million; 
Cognizant (US) paid an estimated $50 mil-
lion; 
Sopra Steria (French) paid estimated $50 
million; 
Redcar and Cleveland Council (UK) paid an 
estimated $14 million; and 
University of California San Francisco (US) 
paid an estimated $1.14 million. 
There are likely many other attacks that are 
not publicly known and this must change if we 
are to defeat this threat. 
Ransomware is becoming the tool of choice 
for those seeking a payout because it can be 
carried out against anyone or any entity by 
perpetrators who are far from U.S. shores. 
The Colonial Pipeline incident is just one in 
a long line of successful attacks or infiltrations 
carried out against domestic information sys-
tems and critical infrastructure with increasing 
consequences for the life, health, safety, and 
economic security of our citizens. 
CEO Joseph Blount testified before the U.S. 
Senate that the attack occurred using a legacy 
Virtual Private Network (VPN) system that did 
not have multifactor authentication. 
In other words, hackers were able to gain 
access to this critical infrastructure as a result 
of a single compromised password. 
There would be no need for the Cybersecu-
rity Vulnerability Remediation Act if owners 
and operators were succeeding in meeting the 
cybersecurity needs of critical infrastructure. 
I know that there is more that should and 
ought to be done to address the issue of 
cybercrime and I will be pursuing this avenue 
under the jurisdiction of the House Judiciary 
Committee, as the chair of the Subcommittee 
on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
vote in support of H.R. 2890. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I urge Mem-
bers to support this bill. I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, our adversaries are 
showing no signs of slowing their ef-
forts to undermine U.S. interests in 
cyberspace. 
Most often, hackers exploit known 
vulnerabilities. The Federal Govern-
ment can and should support efforts to 
address and mitigate known vulnera-
bilities. 
H.R. 2980 would do just that. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Texas 
for her foresight, and I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
CLARKE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2980, as 
amended. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, as Americans pre-
pared for their 4th of July holiday 
weekends, a Russian-based cybercrime 
crime group launched a ransomware at-
tack that would affect up to 1,500 
small- and medium-sized businesses 
and local governments. 
The Kaseya ransomware attacks fol-
lowed a series of cyberattacks, includ-
ing one that resulted in the shutdown 
of 5,500 miles of pipeline on the East 
Coast. 
The unfortunate reality is that the 
rate and ferocity of cyberattacks show 
no signs of ebbing. 
State 
actors 
and 
cybercriminals 
alike use cyber tools to advance their 
goals, regardless of whether they are 
driven by geopolitical considerations 
or profiteering. 
Together, the Federal Government 
and its State, local, and private sector 
partners must do everything in their 
power to defend our networks while de-
terring 
and 
raising 
the 
cost 
of 
cyberattacks. 
At the same time, we must have test-
ed, exercised cyber-incident response 
plans in place in the event a malicious 
hacker successfully gains access to a 
victim network. 
Last year’s National Defense Author-
ization Act included language directing 
DHS, in coordination with interagency 
partners, to conduct four exercises over 
the next 12 years to test the resiliency, 
response, and recovery of the U.S. to a 
significant cyber incident impacting 
critical infrastructure. 
Such exercises are critical to under-
standing our national resilience to 
cyberattacks and where we need to in-
vest in improving capability. 
H.R. 3223 would complement the cap-
stone exercise program authorized last 
year. 
It directs the Cybersecurity and In-
frastructure Security Agency, or CISA, 
together with sector risk management 
agencies, to develop an exercise pro-
gram that is designed to more regu-
larly test and assess systemic pre-
paredness 
and 
resilience 
to 
cyberattacks against critical infra-
structure. 
The authorization includes require-
ments for the development of model ex-
ercises that State and local govern-
ments or private sector entities could 
readily adapt. 
Our 
collective 
resilience 
to 
cyberattacks demands that we regu-
larly assess and improve our ability to 
respond to cyberattacks. 
The exercise program authorized by 
H.R. 3223 will help State and local gov-
ernments and private sector critical in-
frastructure entities to do just that. 
So I urge my colleagues to support 
H.R. 3223, and I reserve the balance of 
my time 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 3223, 
the CISA Cyber Exercise Act. I thank 
my friend and colleague, Ms. SLOTKIN, 
for her leadership on this bill, which 
establishes a cyber exercise program

within CISA to elevate the National 
Cyber Incident Response Plan. 
As cyberattacks affecting our Na-
tion’s critical infrastructure continue 
to rise, it is imperative that State and 
local governments and the private sec-
tor leverage the free services CISA of-
fers to help prevent and mitigate the 
scourge 
of 
ransomware 
and 
other 
cyberattacks facing our Nation. 
I am pleased that this legislation will 
authorize another vital tool in CISA’s 
arsenal. 
I urge Members to join me in sup-
porting H.R. 3223, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Ms. 
SLOTKIN). 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to urge my colleagues to support the 
CISA Cyber Exercise Act, a bipartisan 
bill to strengthen our preparation for 
cyber threats, which I introduced fol-
lowing the ransomware attacks on the 
Colonial Pipeline. 
Last month, I happened to have the 
Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Vilsack 
join me in Ingham County in my dis-
trict to talk to farmers about pro-
tecting family farms, a very important 
topic in a rural community like mine. 
And when we went to open Q and A 
what I think shocked everybody was 
that the first man to stand up, the first 
farmer that stood up in his John Deere 
hat and his overalls wanted to know 
about cybersecurity. That was the first 
thing on his mind. 
I never imagined that, as a Member 
of Congress, I would find myself stand-
ing in a barn talking with local farm-
ers about ransomware, cyberattacks, 
and how we are going to protect our-
selves but, in fact, I have been having 
that conversation over and over again 
in my community. And that is because 
the last few months have made clear to 
all Americans that cybersecurity is not 
just a tech issue, it has gone main-
stream. It is at the very heart of pro-
tecting our critical infrastructure, en-
ergy, food, water, and healthcare that 
drives our daily lives, and it affects 
every single one of us. That is why just 
a week after a ransomware attack 
struck the world’s largest meat proc-
essor, these Ingham County farmers 
wanted to know how cyberattacks 
would affect their family farms, their 
livelihood. 
What would happen if we were struck 
by ransomware in Michigan? Who could 
they turn to to call for help? And above 
all, what is our government doing to 
protect citizens who are on the front 
lines of this threat? 
I introduced the CISA Cyber Exercise 
Act to help answer exactly those ques-
tions. 
This bill will make sure that our gov-
ernment is preparing for the full range 
of cyber threats and that we are giving 
our communities and businesses the 
tools they need to be secure and resil-
ient. 
It strengthens CISA, which is lit-
erally America’s 911 call for cybersecu-
rity, by formally establishing a Na-
tional Cyber Exercise Program to test 
our Nation’s response plans for major 
cyberattacks. 
It also directs CISA to build and ex-
pand a set of model cyber exercises 
that can be used by our State and local 
governments. 
By passing this legislation today, we 
are helping to ensure our Nation and 
our communities are protected. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I urge Mem-
bers to support this fine bill. I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, the country is expe-
riencing an unprecedented number of 
significant cyberattacks. 
From hospitals to schools to pipe-
lines and a meat processing plant, 
nothing is immune. 
The key to ensuring we are resilient 
to cyberattacks is to ensure that we 
have trained and tested cyber incident 
response plans. 
H.R. 3223, the CISA Cyber Exercise 
Act, is critical in that effort. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
3223, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
CLARKE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3223. 
The question was taken.

Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 3264) to amend 
the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to sup-
port H.R. 3264, the Domains Critical to 
Homeland 
Security 
Act. 
America’s 
economy depends on diverse and resil-
ient supply chains that ensure an unin-
terrupted flow of goods and services to 
the Nation. 
Disruptions, whether caused by nat-
ural disasters or manmade events, can 
reduce the availability and integrity of 
critical supplies. This has significant 
Homeland Security implications. 
For example, the COVID–19 pandemic 
revealed vulnerabilities in the Nation’s 
medical supply chains, which caused 
persistent shortages for personal pro-
tective equipment and testing supplies; 
most of which is manufactured over-
seas. And the recent ransomware at-
tack on Colonial Pipeline showed how a 
brief shutdown of a major gas pipeline 
can drive up prices and lead to gas 
shortages. 
H.R. 3264 would authorize DHS to 
conduct research and development into 
supply chain risks for critical domains 
of the U.S. economy. The research 
would include a risk analysis for each 
critical domain to identify weaknesses 
that pose a substantial homeland secu-
rity threat. 
The bill would also require DHS to 
report on the results of its research an-
nually through fiscal year 2026. This re-
port will allow the public and private 
sectors to take meaningful action to 
mitigate risk and to ensure the long- 
term economic security of the United 
States. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league from New York for her words in 
support of H.R. 3264, a bill I introduced 
called the Domains Critical to Home-
land Security Act. We are now a year 
and a half into the COVID pandemic 
and, as a country, have yet to make 
substantial progress in making our 
supply chains more secure and resil-
ient. 
America’s economic and homeland 
security depends on the flow of goods, 
services, information, and technology 
across our physical and virtual borders. 
And as we all know, COVID–19 exposed 
many risks and flaws to our critical 
supply chains; flaws that we now must 
address. 
Over the past year and a half, we 
painfully discovered that China was a 
world leader in the production of per-
sonal protective equipment. And de-
spite being the epicenter of the pan-
demic, China was in a privileged posi-
tion, blocking the rest of the world’s 
access to PPE at a time of maximum 
need. 
China selfishly was able to plan 
ahead with its asymmetrical knowl-
edge of what would be needed, choosing 
to put the U.S. and the rest of the 
world at risk. It has become clear that 
the United States is overly reliant on 
many important goods from China, 
such as semiconductors, rare earth 
minerals used in electronics, and ac-
tive ingredients in pharmaceuticals, all 
of which could put Americans’ security 
and resilience at risk. It has become 
clear that many future supply chain 
vulnerabilities are likely unknown to 
us, even now. 
With COVID, we learned these les-
sons the hard way. Now is the time to 
act by proactively identifying these 
risks. We can’t allow ourselves to be 
behind the curve in the next national 
or global disaster. We need to take ac-
tion and get ahead of the curve and do 
our best to serve our country. That 
means we need to stop talking about it 
and finally put pen to paper. 
To do this—to keep our supply chain 
secure—and to prevent similar disrup-
tions from crippling our economy and 
jeopardizing our resiliency posture, 
Homeland Security needs to identify 
and analyze weak links in the U.S. 
global supply chains and work to 
prioritize where efforts need to be fo-
cused to strengthen those most critical 
to our homeland. 
My bill requires Homeland Security 
to do just that; to look at critical sup-
ply chains, identify weaknesses, and 
prioritize vulnerabilities in a way that 
allows for meaningful action in years 
ahead to address them. This is really 
just commonsense legislation. It is 
about being prepared. 
Requiring Homeland Security to re-
port on these vulnerabilities to our 
economic security annually to Con-
gress and the public will allow for the 
first time a unifying document that ac-
counts for the security implications of 
current and future economic decisions, 
and enable a prioritized policy response 
to spur action. 
It is crucial that Homeland Security 
lean into its unique position as the 
only executive department that deals 
with both the national security and 
economic prosperity of the Nation, and 
lead the United States Government as 
a preeminent economic security agen-
cy in the decades to come. 
This is a natural maturation of 
Homeland Security’s unique vantage 
point sitting on top of 16 critical infra-
structure sectors where it stitches to-
gether a holistic national risk picture. 
We can no longer take for granted 
the resiliency of our economy. We need 
to work to ensure that all modes of 
travel are safe, to facilitate trade 
through our ports of entry, and to keep 
our networks free from cyberattacks. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, 
Chairman THOMPSON, for being an 
original cosponsor, as well as all my 
committee colleagues for unanimously 
supporting this bipartisan legislation 
in committee. Economic security is 
homeland security, and I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill.

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1850, the Supporting Re-
search and Development for First Re-
sponders Act. 
First responders across the Nation 
are facing unprecedented challenges. 
Over the past year, the unrelenting de-
mands of COVID–19 have placed great 
strain on our hometown heroes. In the 
West, first responders have had the 
added challenge of battling devastating 
wildfires; and in the East, they are in 
the midst of a dangerous hurricane sea-
son. 
Compounding these challenges is a 
terrorism threat landscape that, ac-
cording to the Department of Home-
land Security, has ‘‘evolved signifi-
cantly and become increasingly com-
plex and volatile in 2021.’’ 
Given the complexity of the chal-
lenges our men and women on the front 
lines face, it is critical that they have 
the most reliable and effective tech-
nology and equipment to respond. 
When it comes to delivering innovative 
technological solutions, the first re-
sponder community looks to the Na-
tional Urban Security Technology Lab-
oratory in New York City. 
NUSTL, as it has come to be known, 
serves a unique mission in the Federal 
Government. It is the only Federal lab 
that is solely dedicated to researching 
and developing technology to help first 
responders safely and effectively re-
spond to emergencies that range from 
natural disasters and industrial inci-
dents to active shooters and terrorist 
attacks. 
New innovative emergency response 
technologies are constantly being de-
ployed, but to keep our first responders 
safe, they must first be tried and test-
ed. 
Enactment of H.R. 1850 would ensure 
that NUSTL can continue to carry out 
this vital role in Homeland Security. 
Specifically, 
it 
would 
ensure 
that 
NUSTL could continue to conduct sim-
ulated scenarios with first responders 
to test new emergency systems, sup-
port research for innovative tech-
nology, and assist first responders in 
evaluating new tools. 
In recent years, despite NUSTL’s rec-
ognized value to the Nation, we saw 
the Trump administration repeatedly 
propose shuttering it. Thankfully, Con-
gress rejected those shortsighted pro-
posals and redoubled its support for 
this vital institution. 
Looking ahead, we must not only 
permanently authorize NUSTL by en-
acting H.R. 1850, but we must also con-
tinue to prioritize funding for the lab 
so it can continue its critical work. 
Once again, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND 
TECHNOLOGY, 
Washington, DC, July 8, 2021. 
Hon. BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN THOMPSON: I am writing to 
address the jurisdictional interests of the 
Committee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology (‘‘Science Committee’’) in H.R. 1850, 
the ‘‘Supporting Research and Development 
for First Responders Act.’’ 
While the Science Committee has claimed 
jurisdiction over versions of this bill intro-
duced in previous Congresses, I recognize and 
appreciate your desire to bring this legisla-
tion before the House in an expeditious man-
ner, and, accordingly agree not to insist on a 
sequential referral. This is, of course, condi-
tional on our mutual understanding that 
nothing in this legislation or my decision to 
forgo sequential referral waives, reduces, or 
otherwise affects the jurisdiction of the 
Science Committee, and that a copy of this 
letter and your response will be included in 
the bill report to be filed by the Committee 
on Homeland Security and included in the 
Congressional Record when the bill is consid-
ered on the House Floor. 
Finally, I ask that you support the ap-
pointment of Science Committee conferees 
during any House-Senate conference con-
vened on this, or similar legislation. Thank 
you for your attention on this matter. 
Sincerely, 
EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, 
Chairwoman.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3706 
July 20, 2021 
I will include our letters on H.R. 1850 in the 
Congressional Record during floor consider-
ation of this bill. I look forward to working 
with you on this legislation and other mat-
ters of great importance to this Nation. 
Sincerely, 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 1850, the Supporting Research and 
Development for First Responders Act. 
H.R. 
1850 
authorizes 
the 
National 
Urban Security Technology Laboratory 
within the Department of Homeland 
Security’s Science and Technology di-
rectorate. 
This important lab tests and evalu-
ates emerging technologies and con-
ducts research and development to as-
sist emergency response providers in 
preparing for and protecting against 
Homeland Security threats. 
The lab also works to enhance first 
responder capabilities by partnering 
with stakeholders to develop viable so-
lutions to radiological and nuclear 
threats and by acting as a technical ad-
viser to the first responder community. 
The National Urban Security Tech-
nology Laboratory has assisted in 
training thousands of State and local 
first responders during more than 130 
training events with State and local 
agencies throughout the New York 
City metropolitan area. With New 
York still serving as a top target for 
terrorist and other security threats, 
now is the time to support our front 
line emergency response providers. 
Madam Speaker, I commend my fel-
low New York colleagues, Representa-
tives RICE and GARBARINO, for leading 
on this issue. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members 
to join me in supporting H.R. 1850, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Miss RICE). 
Miss RICE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of my legisla-
tion, H.R. 1850, the Supporting Re-
search and Development for First Re-
sponders Act. 
This bipartisan bill would perma-
nently authorize the New York City- 
based National Urban Security Tech-
nology Laboratory, which has been 
commonly referred to as NUSTL. 
b 1400 
NUSTL’s mission is to develop and 
test new tools for our first responders 
to utilize in response to terrorist at-
tacks, natural disasters, accidents, and 
other large-scale events. 
There is no other lab in the country 
doing this critical counterterrorism 
and emergency response work, and it is 
more important now than ever before. 
From the rise in domestic extremism 
to stronger and more frequent storms 
as a result of climate change, the 
threats facing our Nation are pressing. 
We must make sure our first respond-
ers are best equipped to handle any po-
tential emergency, and providing sup-
port for NUSTL will help us accom-
plish that goal. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank Congressman GARBARINO, my 
colleague on Long Island, for co-lead-
ing this legislation with me, and I 
would also like to thank Chairman 
THOMPSON and Ranking Member KATKO 
for their help in getting it on the floor. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this bill. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
adopt a comment of my colleague from 
New York (Ms. CLARKE) about the 
great State of New York. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no further speak-
ers. I urge Members to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1850 is a bill to 
protect our protectors. At the very 
least, those on the front lines deserve 
to go to work with the certainty that 
their equipment will work when they 
need it the most. They should not have 
to ask themselves: Will it function 
under pressure? Can it take the heat? 
We owe it to the nearly 2 million 
Americans who put their lives on the 
line to protect us to ensure that 
NUSTL is operational and resourced to 
test their equipment. 
This fall, we will be observing the 
20th anniversary of the September 11 
terrorist attacks that shook this Na-
tion to its core. The 9/11 attack was not 
only the single deadliest terrorist at-
tack in human history, but it was the 
deadliest incident ever for firefighters 
and law enforcement officers in the 
United States. 
Mr. Speaker, 343 New York City fire-
fighters, 23 NYPD officers, and 37 Port 
Authority officers died that day. By 
enacting H.R. 1850, we can ensure that 
as 
threats 
continue 
to 
grow 
and 
change, NUSTL will be there to provide 
critical technical support to our first 
responder community. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from New York (Miss RICE) for 
this legislation, and I ask that my col-
leagues support this bipartisan legisla-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MCNERNEY). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. CLARKE) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 1850. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
DHS MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURES 
ACT 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I move to suspend the rules 
and pass the bill (H.R. 3263) to amend 
the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to 
establish in the Department of Home-
land 
Security 
a

counter-
measures program, and for other pur-
poses. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

‘‘Sec. 1932. Medical countermeasures.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. CLARKE) and the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 3263, the DHS Medical 
Countermeasures Act. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3263 seeks to estab-
lish a medical countermeasures pro-
gram to facilitate the readiness and 
protection of personnel and working 
animals in the event of a chemical, bio-
logical, radiological, nuclear, or explo-
sives attack; disease outbreak; or pan-
demic. 
H.R. 3263 requires DHS’ chief medical 
officer, 
or 
CMO, 
to 
provide 
pro-
grammatic oversight of the medical 
countermeasures program and estab-
lish a medical countermeasures work-
ing group comprised of relevant DHS 
components. 
Additionally, the bill requires the 
CMO to utilize DHS chemical, biologi-
cal, radiological, and nuclear risk as-
sessments, and CDC guidance, to deter-
mine the types and quantities of med-
ical countermeasures to stockpile. 
H.R. 3263, first introduced in the 
114th Congress, was developed due to 
concerns about the possibility of a se-
vere pandemic that could cause ill-
nesses and fatalities and destabilize the 
operations of DHS. The COVID–19 pan-
demic has brought these concerns to 
the forefront. 
DHS is responsible for protecting our 
homeland, but the Department can 
only do that if it has a safe workforce. 
Many of the more than 240,000 employ-
ees are out on the front lines due to the 
nature of their responsibilities. 
Furthermore, critical supply short-
ages of personal protective equipment 
earlier in the pandemic, which affected 
the Federal Government and State and 
local governments, also severely im-
pacted DHS operations. 
H.R. 3263 is informed by an August 
2014 DHS inspector general report. It is 
also informed by testimony provided 
during multiple House Homeland Secu-
rity Committee hearings. 
Enactment of this bill will improve 
DHS’ ability to protect the well-being 
of DHS personnel so they can fulfill 
their mission: protecting our home-
land. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3263, the DHS Medical Counter-
measures Act offered by my colleague 
and friend, Representative MILLER- 
MEEKS. 
This bill establishes a critical med-
ical countermeasures program within 
the Department of Homeland Security 
to protect the workforce from chem-
ical, biological, radiological, and other 
public health threats. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has shown 
us the importance of preparation and 
risk mitigation in the face of the un-
known. At the Department of Home-
land Security, where many components 
have 
high-risk, 
public-facing 
oper-
ations, a medical countermeasures pro-
gram and stockpile are crucial for en-
suring mission continuity. 
Like the rest of the country, the De-
partment struggled to maintain suffi-
cient supplies throughout the pan-
demic. That, combined with the reli-
ance on foreign-made personal protec-
tive equipment and other medical sup-
plies, highlights the need for this im-
portant legislation. 
This bill requires the Homeland Se-
curity chief medical officer to main-
tain a medical countermeasures stock-
pile and develop standards for its stor-
age, security, and maintenance. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend Representa-
tive MILLER-MEEKS for her leadership 
on this timely bill. I urge all Members 
to join me in supporting H.R. 3263, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no more speakers, and 
I am prepared to close after the gen-
tleman from New York closes. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS). 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in strong support of my 
bill, H.R. 3263, the DHS Medical Coun-
termeasures Act. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has wreaked 
havoc all over the world, causing 
countless deaths, both from COVID and 
from unexpected causes unrelated to 
COVID, businesses shuttering, job loss, 
and our everyday way of life almost 
coming to a halt. While I am pleased 
that the United States is heading back 
to normalcy with three excellent and 
widely available vaccines, we cannot 
forget the great struggles that we en-
countered just last year. 
Every day, countless Americans put 
their lives on the line for others, in-
cluding the men and women in the De-
partment 
of 
Homeland 
Security. 
Throughout the pandemic, the agencies 
and officers at CBP continued to pro-
tect our borders; TSA officers secured 
our transportation system; and rep-
resentatives from FEMA, who took a 
lead role in the government’s response 
to the pandemic, still had to deploy 
when disaster struck in other areas. 
My bill, the DHS Medical Counter-
measures Act, supports the DHS work-
force and Department mission con-
tinuity by requiring the Secretary to 
establish a medical countermeasures 
program to protect employees and 
working animals in the event of a 
chemical, biological, radiological, nu-
clear, or explosives attack; naturally 
occurring disease outbreak; or pan-
demic. 
This legislation requires the chief 
medical officer of the Department to 
maintain a stockpile of medical coun-
termeasures and to develop Depart-
ment-wide standards for storage, secu-
rity, placement, dispensing, supply di-
versity, and documentation of counter-
measures. 
This bill requires the establishment 
of a medical countermeasures working 
group 
comprised 
of 
representatives 
from relevant Department components 
and offices to ensure medical counter-
measure standards are maintained and 
guidance is consistent. 
Finally, the bill requires the chief 
medical officer to develop an inte-
grated logistics support plan for med-
ical countermeasures that includes a 
methodology for determining types and 
quantities of countermeasures, inven-
tory tracking, and a replenishment 
plan for existing stockpiles. 
Mr. Speaker, as a doctor, former di-
rector of the Iowa Department of Pub-
lic Health, and military veteran, I can 
assure you I know full well the neces-
sity of medical countermeasures for 
treatment, diagnosis, and maintaining 
the safety of our community. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity has over 240,000 employees tasked 
with jobs ranging from border and 
aviation security to emergency re-
sponse and cybersecurity, with one 
common goal: keeping America safe. It 
is imperative that materials and proc-
esses are put in place to protect the 
safety and welfare of employees and to

Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
join me in supporting this common-
sense bill, H.R. 3263. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I urge Members 
to support this bill.

Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of

Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3263 is a measure 
that this country needs. 
I believe all of us in this body can 
agree that protecting the health and 
safety of DHS personnel is critical to 
homeland security, and to that end, we 
must pass this bill. 
Enactment 
of 
H.R. 
3263 
would 
strengthen 
medical 
countermeasure 
protocols within the Department and 
help DHS prepare for and respond to 
homeland threats.

hour of general debate on the bill 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce or their designees and provides 
one motion to recommit. 
The rule further provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 3985, the ALLIES Act of 
2021, under a closed rule. The rule self- 
executes a manager’s amendment from 
Chairman NADLER, provides for 1 hour 
of general debate on the bill equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary or their des-
ignees, and provides one motion to re-
commit. 
Finally, the rule provides the major-
ity leader or his designee the ability to 
en bloc requested roll call votes on sus-
pension bills considered on July 19 and 
July 20, 2021. This authority lasts 
through July 22. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the three bills in this rule: H.R. 2467, 
the PFAS Action Act of 2021; H.R. 2668, 
the Consumer Protection and Recovery 
Act; and H.R. 3985, the ALLIES Act of 
2021. 
H.R. 2467 will require comprehensive 
regulation of PFAS under our Nation’s 
landmark environmental laws. 
PFAS compounds—dangerous, man-
made chemicals which do not break 
down easily and are known as forever 
chemicals—have 
contaminated 
our 
water, soil, and air for decades. The 
CDC estimates that nearly every Amer-
ican has been exposed to them, espe-
cially our brave firefighters, service-
members, and their families. 
In my home State of North Carolina, 
we know this issue too well. Chemical 
companies have polluted the Cape Fear 
River with PFAS for years. Tests of 
drinking water systems in my district, 
including in Raleigh and Cary, have de-
tected PFAS. 
This bill would accomplish multiple 
goals, including directing the EPA to 
establish standards to protect our 
drinking water from contamination 
and authorizing grants to drinking 
water utilities treating PFAS contami-
nation. 
Some utilities are already investing 
millions of dollars to upgrade their 
water treatment technology. I was 
proud to offer a bipartisan amendment 
with Congressman ROUZER to clarify 
the requirements for this grant pro-
gram, helping to ensure that commu-
nities 
that 
are 
already 
investing 
money to address this problem can still 
benefit from the funding included in 
this bill. 
H.R. 2467 is a strong step forward to 
protect the health of our water, air, 
soil, and our people. I am thrilled that 
we are bringing this bipartisan legisla-
tion to the House floor. 
I also rise in support of H.R. 2668. For 
over 100 years, the FTC has been 
tasked with protecting consumers from 
fraud and deception in the market-
place. Until the Supreme Court’s re-
cent ruling, the FTC used a provision 
of the FTC Act to recover and return 
billions of dollars to victims of fraud. 
Senior citizens, military families, and 
immigrants are particularly vulnerable 
to scammers and deceptive business 
practices. 
H.R. 2668 will ensure that the FTC 
has the tools it needs to protect hard-
working families and small businesses 
and to make victims of fraud whole. 
Lastly, I rise in support of H.R. 3985. 
I come from a military State, and I am 
proud to advocate on behalf of all those 
who have risked their lives to protect 
our country. As we draw down our 
forces in Afghanistan, the very least 
we can do for our Afghan allies—in-
cluding interpreters, contractors, and 
security personnel—is to protect them 
from the Taliban and provide them 
with the opportunity to rebuild their 
lives in safety here in the United 
States. 
North Carolina is fortunate to be 
home to many courageous Afghans who 
relocated to the United States through 
the Afghan Special Immigration Visa 
program, and I know that my commu-
nity will benefit from allowing more of 
these heroes to take refuge in our 
State. 
By increasing the Afghan Special Im-
migration Visa cap and easing require-
ments for applicants, this bill will en-
sure that our Nation keeps its promises 
to those allies who stood shoulder to 
shoulder with American forces on the 
battlefield. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time to pass all 
three of these bills, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
for yielding me the customary 30 min-
utes, and I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s rule provides 
for consideration of a bill to designate 
perfluorooctanoic acid, also known as 
PFOA, 
and 
perfluorooctanesulfonic 
acid, also known as PFOS, as haz-
ardous substances under the Com-
prehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act, out-
side the regular rulemaking process. 
This rule also includes a bill to over-
turn a recent Supreme Court decision 
on the Federal Trade Commission’s au-
thority to seek monetary relief for con-
sumers, and a bill to ease restrictions 
and increase the cap on Special Immi-
grant Visas for Afghans. 
H.R. 2467, the PFAS Action Act, has 
a laudable goal to address the negative 
impacts of PFOA and PFAS. These are 
manmade chemicals and have proven 
useful but potentially harmful. While 
they 
are 
often 
used 
in 
products 
throughout our world, there is evidence 
that certain types of PFAS lead to neg-
ative health consequences. Although 
there is bipartisan agreement that 
Congress needs to address PFAS con-
tamination, this bill does not achieve 
that goal. 
The PFAS Action Act would require 
the Environmental Protection Agency 
to designate PFAS and PFOA as haz-
ardous substances under the Com-
prehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act of 
1980, known as CERCLA, within 1 year 
of the bill’s passage and then to con-
sider designating the remaining 9,000- 
plus PFAS chemicals as hazardous sub-
stances within 5 years. 
The reality is just over 800 com-
pounds have been categorized as haz-
ardous substances since the passage of 
CERCLA in 1980. Now, we are going to 
add over 9,000 chemicals in just 5 years, 
and I submit it will be nearly impos-
sible for the Environmental Protection 
Agency to implement this. 
The agency is actively engaged in in-
vestigating the prevalence of PFAS 
chemicals 
and 
has 
undertaken 
rulemakings to address some of the 
provisions in this bill, so undercutting 
this process by establishing unrealistic 
requirements on a shortened timeline 
sets 
the 
Environmental 
Protection 
Agency up for failure. 
CERCLA is an incredibly complex 
body of law that triggers significant li-
ability if a cleanup is necessary. Cre-
ating a blanket designation of all of 
the 9,252 PFAS chemicals would create 
a massive problem for consumers who 
live with FDA-approved PFAS devices. 
For example, 40 million Americans are 
currently living with a PFAS-based 
heart stent. 
Are they to be designated as Super-
fund sites or to have those stents re-
moved? 
b 1430 
A 
blanket 
CERCLA 
designation 
would also hinder innovation in new 
products. The coronavirus pandemic 
has revealed the vulnerabilities in our 
supply chain. It doesn’t seem like the 
correct time to limit the materials 
available for innovation when the des-
ignation as hazardous, for largely use-
ful compounds, is based on rushed 
science. 
This bill also requires the EPA to 
issue a rule on toxicity testing for 
PFAS, a rule on PFAS contamination 
of drinking water, and a rule to des-
ignate all PFAS chemicals as haz-
ardous air pollutants under the Clean 
Air Act. 
Furthermore, 
this 
legislation 
re-
quires the Environmental Protection 
Agency to establish grants for commu-
nities to implement PFAS water treat-
ment technologies. 
Republicans offered amendments in 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
and at the Rules Committee that were 
rejected for various procedural reasons. 
The Rules Committee did not receive a 
score from the Congressional Budget 
Office for this bill until an hour before 
our Rules meeting yesterday, and the 
CBO score was indeterminate. 
The administration of this bill would 
cost the Federal Government $280 mil-
lion over 10 years. It is impossible to 
know how this impacts Federal spend-
ing over the next 10 years. No one 
knows how much PFAS contamination 
exists, so no one knows how much li-
ability this bill creates for taxpayers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3710 
July 20, 2021 
Because the amendments offered by 
Republicans were based on the under-
lying bill, the amendments were also 
problematic from a budget perspective. 
There is no reason to limit consider-
ation of these amendments that affect 
consumer safety based on the inability 
to achieve a budget score because the 
underlying bill is budgetarily suspect. 
Ultimately, this bill ignores the soci-
etal good that some fluorinated com-
pounds demand. PFAS are in medical 
devices that save lives. They are used 
in firefighting foams to put out the 
worst of blazes, including jet fuel fires. 
They are in advanced energy products 
like solar panels and pipelines. They 
are even in piano keys and dental floss. 
These compounds are risky if used im-
properly or irresponsibly, but they are 
essential when used correctly. 
Our second bill, the Consumer Pro-
tection and Recovery Act seeks to 
overturn the Supreme Court’s decision 
in the case of AMG Capital v. Federal 
Trade Commission. In this decision, 
the Supreme Court ruled unanimously 
that section 13(b) of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act does not grant the 
Federal Trade Commission the author-
ity to seek monetary relief as an equi-
table remedy when engaging in en-
forcement actions. 
Unfortunately, this bill was rushed 
through the Energy and Commerce 
Committee without addressing any of 
the Republican concerns. First, this 
bill reinstates the Federal Trade Com-
mission’s authority to seek monetary 
relief under section 13(b) and expands 
the scope to apply broadly to all FTC 
enforcement authority. This will likely 
make monetary relief the go-to remedy 
for every alleged FTC violation. 
The Federal Trade Commission al-
ready has authority to seek monetary 
relief for fraudulent and dishonest con-
duct under section 19 of the Federal 
Trade Commission Act. 
Second, this bill includes a statute of 
limitations of 10 years, but a 5-year 
statute of limitations is in line with 
the rest of the Federal Trade Commis-
sion Act, and, in fact, would be more 
appropriate. It does not make sense for 
courts to go back for a full decade to 
calculate monetary relief. 
During the Rules meeting yesterday, 
Ranking Member BILIRAKIS offered an 
amendment that would have addressed 
these two issues. Unfortunately, com-
mittee Democrats would not even 
allow a debate on these amendments on 
the floor of this House. 
Additionally, the expanded scope of 
the bill would give the Federal Trade 
Commission new authority to seek 
monetary relief in antitrust cases. This 
remedy is currently not needed, be-
cause antitrust cases can be brought 
through private rights of action or, in 
fact, treble damages, a tripling of the 
compensatory damages, can be award-
ed. 
This bill is a missed opportunity to 
develop Federal privacy legislation 
that is needed to overcome a patch-
work of State laws. A key part of pro-
tecting consumers is ensuring that the 
Federal Trade Commission has the 
tools to enforce a Federal privacy 
standard. It is disappointing that the 
Democrats refused to work with Re-
publicans to make this bill actually 
useful and effective for real consumers. 
Republicans support ensuring that 
the Federal Trade Commission has the 
necessary tools to protect consumers 
from bad actors. But it also recognizes 
that guardrails are necessary to pre-
vent the Federal Trade Commission 
from exceeding its authority. 
The final bill, the ALLIES Act, ex-
pands the number of special immigrant 
visas by 8,000 and eases requirements 
for Afghan requirements. To qualify, 
an individual must have been employed 
in Afghanistan by or on behalf of the 
United States Government, the Inter-
national Security Assistance Force, or 
the Resolute Support Mission. 
This bill removes the current re-
quirement that the International Secu-
rity Assistance Force or Resolute Sup-
port employees had been engaged in 
sensitive and trusted positions. This 
will make it easier for Afghans who 
served alongside our Armed Forces to 
qualify. 
Americans first entered Afghanistan 
in October 2001. Most of us were not in 
Congress in October of 2001. And this, 
of course, followed the terrorist at-
tacks on September 11 of that year. 
Once the Taliban was defeated and 
Osama bin Laden was caught, the 
United States worked to establish a le-
gitimate and strong central govern-
ment in Afghanistan. Now, after 20 
years, Americans are ready for their 
brave sons and daughters to come 
home. 
Despite our efforts and bloodshed, Af-
ghanistan remains plagued by a resur-
gent Taliban, by dangerous militias, 
and by a weak central government. The 
Pentagon recently stated that, for all 
intents and purposes, the United States 
withdrawal is, in fact, already com-
plete. Unfortunately, many Afghans 
who served alongside our Armed Forces 
and security personnel remain in Af-
ghanistan under serious threat due to 
their employment by or on behalf of 
the United States’ missions. 
We must ensure that we are not put-
ting Americans at risk by not properly 
vetting applicants as they are brought 
to this country, but we also must do 
right by those Afghans who risked 
their lives to aid Americans through-
out the last 20 years. 
Mr. Speaker, it will come as no sur-
prise to you that I am going to urge op-
position to the rule, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
rule. PFAS water contamination is 
personal for all of us. Nearly all of us 
have been contaminated without our 
consent, without our knowledge. We all 
have PFAS in our blood, the forever 
chemical. High levels of this toxin have 
dangerous and damaging health effects. 
The EPA’s website describes the ef-
fects: ‘‘low infant birth weights, effects 
on the immune system, cancer . . . and 
thyroid hormone disruption.’’ 
And manufacturers knew. They knew 
the dangers of PFAS my entire life. It 
wasn’t until the turn of this century 
and the heroic work of Attorney Rob 
Bilott that they were forced to admit 
what they knew. They knew that PFAS 
was toxic in the 1960s. They knew it 
was building up in our bodies, in our 
blood, by the 1970s. They knew it was 
contaminating our water by the 1980s. 
They knew that it was poisoning our 
own workers by the 1990s. But they hid 
the truth from their own workers, from 
their neighbors, from you and me. 
We have a responsibility to protect 
everyone from PFAS contamination 
and the PFAS Action Act is a step in 
the right direction in ensuring every-
one has clean water. The PFAS Action 
Act would: require the EPA to estab-
lish a national drinking water stand-
ard; designate PFOA and PFOS chemi-
cals as hazardous substances; require 
EPA to regulate PFAS discharge; and 
provide 
$200 
million 
annually 
for 
wastewater treatment; place a morato-
rium on the introduction of new PFAS; 
and 
require 
comprehensive 
PFAS 
health testing. 
All of this would set a standard and 
provide protections. I am grateful to 
see a requirement for EPA to develop 
necessary rules for safe disposal of 
PFAS. That is included in this legisla-
tion. 
We cannot continue to allow manu-
facturers to recklessly poison our com-
munities. As we move forward, remem-
ber, it is our responsibility as legisla-
tors to educate, litigate, legislate, and 
finally hold polluters accountable. 
I thank Representative DINGELL for 
her tenacity in drafting and passing 
this legislation, and I urge my col-
leagues to support this rule and the un-
derlying bill as well as the other two 
bills in the rule. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to immediately con-
sider S. 1867, the COVID–19 Origin Act, 
introduced by Senator HAWLEY. It has 
been 55 days since the Senate passed 
this critical bill without a single dis-
senting vote. 
Declassifying 
intelligence 
sur-
rounding the origin of COVID–19 is im-
perative and key to the House Repub-
lican plan to hold China accountable 
for the pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment into the RECORD, along with ex-
traneous material, immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3711 
July 20, 2021 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, to fur-
ther explain the amendment, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. WENSTRUP), a valuable member of 
the Doctors Caucus. 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of the pre-
vious question so we can immediately 
consider S. 1867, the COVID–19 Origin 
Act of 2021. 
The coronavirus pandemic has been 
marred by fear, confusion, and mis-
trust, and it appears very possible that 
this virus was genetically engineered 
through gain-of-function research in a 
lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, 
making the virus more contagious to 
human beings. 
It is absolutely true that there has 
been political engineering, including 
even speaking on the facts of its origin 
and its initial spread. I am sure each 
and every one of us has talked to con-
stituents who have said they just don’t 
know what to believe is true when it 
comes to COVID. Well, we are in a posi-
tion today to help, to provide some 
transparency and accountability. The 
best disinfectant is sunlight and that is 
what we can provide today. 
I could stand up here for hours walk-
ing through the specific details of the 
report that I helped conduct with some 
of my colleagues on the Intelligence 
Committee, or by rehashing the find-
ings from the hearings that our Repub-
lican colleagues on the Select Com-
mittee conducted, but I only have a few 
minutes, so here are a few key facts 
and pieces of information that our bill 
establishes. 
Right now, what we do know is that, 
according to the Department of State, 
we have ‘‘reason to believe that several 
researchers in the Wuhan Institute of 
Virology became sick in the autumn of 
2019 . . . with symptoms consistent 
with both COVID–19 and common sea-
sonal illnesses.’’ 
We also know Wuhan researchers, in-
cluding Dr. Shi Zheng-Li, also known 
colloquially as the ‘‘bat lady,’’ con-
ducted experiments involving a par-
ticular bat virus which showed an in-
credibly similar genetic makeup to 
SARS-CoV–2, the virus that causes 
COVID–19. 
We also know from publications that 
Dr. Shi was conducting dangerous gain- 
of-function research. 
Further, we know that the Wuhan In-
stitute, which presents itself as a civil-
ian institution, has received U.S. tax-
payer dollars through grants to the 
EcoHealth Alliance. The lab has col-
laborated on projects for China’s mili-
tary. 
Finally, there is no animal inter-
mediary found. As scientists have stat-
ed, COVID–19 in its present form would 
have taken years to develop naturally 
in its infectious state, yet it did not. 
Rather, it was seemingly immediate. 
When I was on the Cincinnati Board 
of 
Health, 
we 
investigated 
health 
issues, and we provided our findings to 
the public. We never saw anything like 
this pandemic, but we played a key 
role in keeping our community healthy 
by preventing smaller outbreaks from 
happening again. 
That is why, given these facts, the 
bill calls for three things. The bill first 
establishes that we must identify the 
precise origins of COVID–19 because it 
is critical for preventing a similar pan-
demic in the future. 
Earlier this year, CDC Director Rob-
ert Redfield stated, ‘‘the most likely 
etiology of this pathogen in Wuhan was 
from a laboratory.’’ 
Even Director-General Tedros of the 
World Health Organization acknowl-
edges that COVID–19 may have origi-
nated in a lab and thought it was worth 
investigating. 
Second, given these scientific opin-
ions and a whole slew of evidence, in-
cluding what I noted earlier, the bill 
establishes that we have reason to be-
lieve that the COVID–19 pandemic may 
have originated in the Wuhan Institute 
of Virology in their lab. 
Finally—and this goes back to my 
original point about transparency—the 
bill requires the Director of National 
Intelligence to declassify as much evi-
dence as possible that they can of what 
they know about the origin of COVID– 
19; what activity the Wuhan lab was 
conducting; and what we know about 
the researchers who reportedly fell ill 
back in 2019. 
The bill is about accountability for 
Americans who want to know, who de-
serve to know what caused this hor-
rible scourge that took the lives of so 
many of our families and loved ones; 
that destroyed our businesses and live-
lihoods; that robbed them of years of 
their lives. Actually, the whole world 
wants to know. 
b 1445 
It is critical to inform Congress so we 
can better prepare to stave off the next 
pandemic. I know some of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
have recently asked our leaders to es-
tablish a committee to do just that. I 
think it is a laudable goal, and this bill 
would help those efforts. 
I can’t stress enough that this bill is 
not controversial by any means. In 
fact, it passed the Senate in May with 
unanimous consent. Not one Senator 
objected, not Senators CRUZ or RAND 
PAUL, not BERNIE SANDERS or ELIZA-
BETH WARREN. If those four Senators 
can get on board with this bill, should 
not we be able to do the same? 
Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of the pre-
vious question and for immediate con-
sideration of S. 1867. It is for trans-
parency. It is for accountability. It is 
for truth. It is for doing the right thing 
on behalf of humankind. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON), a distin-
guished member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the rule under con-
sideration today. 
Well before coming to Congress, I 
provided legal services for Iraqis and 
Afghans who had put their lives at risk 
as drivers, translators, and contractors 
to help our military abroad. They need-
ed help to obtain the Special Immi-
grant Visas they were promised in re-
turn. 
From that experience, I know first-
hand that the process is rigorous and 
time-consuming. Even before the pan-
demic, it could take years for these 
critical allies to receive the special 
visas they were promised. During that 
time, they and their families faced con-
tinual threats of injury and death. 
Many died, had to go into hiding, or 
had their relatives killed because they 
had assisted U.S. forces. 
As the U.S. leaves Afghanistan after 
almost two decades of unending war, 
we need to streamline the SIV process 
so that we can make good on America’s 
promise to our Afghan allies who 
risked their lives to protect our troops. 
The ALLIES Act would ensure that 
the U.S. keeps its promise to protect 
those allies who worked with U.S. 
troops in Afghanistan. We must pass 
this bill quickly so that no one is left 
behind. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to state my 
support for the other two bills in to-
day’s rule. 
My region knows just how pervasive 
and dangerous the PFAS chemicals 
are. Pennsylvania has multiple PFAS- 
contaminated sites, and my district is 
downstream from a couple of them. 
Uncontaminated 
drinking 
water 
should not be a debatable topic. For 
the health and safety our families, 
friends, and neighborhoods, we need to 
properly regulate and remediate PFAS 
chemicals, and this bill would do just 
that. 
Finally, we need to pass the Con-
sumer Protection and Recovery Act to 
restore the ability of the FTC to pro-
tect consumers by forcing bad actors to 
return funds to consumers who have 
been defrauded, in the wake of a Su-
preme Court decision that took away 
that power from the FTC. 
It is estimated that Pennsylvania 
seniors lose about $1.2 billion a year to 
scammers. 
Forcing 
reimbursements 
has been a key tool in the FTC toolbox 
for almost 40 years, and it is probably 
the most important tool for the indi-
vidual consumer. This bill will make 
clear Congress’ intent to restore that 
power to the FTC. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this 
rule and its underlying legislation, and 
I call on all my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, again, I 
am going to urge defeat of the previous 
question 
and 
consideration 
of 
the 
amendment as previously discussed by 
Dr. WENSTRUP. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LAHOOD) 
to further explain the amendment. 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Dr. BURGESS
for yielding and Dr. 
WENSTRUP for leading this effort.

July 20, 2021 
If the previous question is defeated, 
we will amend the rule to immediately 
consider S. 1867, the COVID–19 Origin 
Act of 2021. This legislation, which 
passed the Senate by unanimous con-
sent, is simple. If passed, the bill would 
require the Biden administration’s Di-
rector of National Intelligence to de-
classify intelligence information re-
lated to any potential links between 
the Wuhan Institute of Virology, also 
known as the Wuhan lab, and the ori-
gins of COVID–19 in order to better pre-
pare for and avoid future pandemics. 
Let’s remember the devastating ef-
fect that this pandemic has had in this 
country with over 600,000 deaths and 4 
million deaths worldwide. 
In May, Republicans on the House In-
telligence Committee released an in-
terim report outlining the growing evi-
dence of a possible lab leak of the 
COVID–19 virus. 
Here are the facts. Number one, we 
know, based on numerous reports, that 
the researchers at the Wuhan lab fell 
sick with COVID-related symptoms in 
the fall of 2019. Number two, we also 
know that there was active engage-
ment by the Chinese military at the 
Wuhan lab. And, number three, we 
know that the Chinese Government has 
continued to hinder efforts for data 
collection and transparency in this in-
vestigation. Essentially, Mr. Speaker, 
they have been nontransparent and 
noncooperative. 
The bottom line is, the American 
people deserve a full accounting of the 
origins of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
which has resulted in shutting down 
our economy, massive deaths across 
the world, and millions out of work. 
Mr. Speaker, how can we prevent a 
future pandemic if we don’t know the 
genesis of this one? 
This vote today will help answer 
those questions and get to the origins 
of the pandemic. I am proud to join my 
friend, Congressman WENSTRUP, in this 
effort for transparency, and I urge my 
colleagues to defeat the previous ques-
tion. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. MORELLE), another distin-
guished member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my distinguished colleague and friend, 
my colleague from the Rules Com-
mittee, the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina (Ms. ROSS). 
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support 
of the rule in favor of the ALLIES Act. 
This bill would protect our Afghan 
partners who risked their lives as 
translators and navigators to U.S. 
military personnel by expediting the 
Afghan Special Immigrant Visa process 
and approving an additional 8,000 visas 
so that they can come to America as 
soon as possible. 
The withdrawal of U.S. troops from 
Afghanistan has placed thousands of 
these allies and their families at risk 
of retribution. 
If not for the contributions of these 
Afghan partners, the United States 
military losses could have been greater 
than already endured during this pro-
longed conflict. 
For 20 years, their courage and sac-
rifice protected our troops, and they 
were an invaluable asset to our forces 
in Afghanistan. We have a duty to en-
sure both they and their families are 
safe from retaliation from the Taliban 
and other terrorist organizations. 
In my district of Rochester, New 
York, my office hears multiple times 
per week from SIV advocates, like 
Keeping Our Promise and the Associa-
tion of Wartime Allies. The stories 
they share are heartbreaking: brave 
men and women stuck in bureaucratic 
limbo, waiting for the visas they were 
promised so they can start a new life in 
America. 
We need to pass this bill and honor 
the promise we made to our allies. If 
we leave these people behind, who will 
ever be willing to assist U.S. forces 
around the world, knowing that we 
lacked the moral resolve to protect our 
allies? 
That is not what we stand for. The 
United States leads from the front. 
Now is the time to take charge of the 
situation and ensure we keep our prom-
ise and leave no one behind. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the rule and pass H.R. 3985. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Ari-
zona (Mrs. LESKO), a former member of 
the Rules Committee and a valuable 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the rule. Although there 
are parts of the rule that I agree with, 
I am going to talk today about the 
PFAS Action Act and why I think it is 
a problem. 
Republicans and Democrats alike are 
concerned about our water quality. Of 
course, we want to make sure that we 
have good-quality drinking water. 
Unfortunately, the PFAS Action Act 
goes too far. It classifies over 9,000 
chemicals as hazardous. This is a huge 
problem because there are a lot of ma-
terials that are made with PFAS 
chemicals that aren’t harmful to hu-
mans. 
In one case in point, in my district, 
there is a company called W. L. Gore. 
Most of you know about it because 
they make GORE-TEX, but they also 
make medical devices. They have 2,000 
employees in Flagstaff, Arizona, and 
they have 1,000 employees in my dis-
trict. They make heart stents. 
I went on a tour of their company. 
They make all kinds of medical devices 
that are implanted in human beings 
that we rely on to save lives. Yet, 
those medical devices have a form of 
PFAS in them. If this legislation is 
passed, you are basically going to 
cause them to be called hazardous ma-
terials, and we won’t be able to im-
plant these in people. 
This is a huge problem, and I think 
that my Democratic friends just need 
to think this through a little bit more. 
All of us want clean drinking water. 
But there are so many different uses of 
these PFAS chemicals, over 9,000 of 
them, and some of them are for really 
good uses, like these medical devices, 
the heart stents. 
That is why I oppose this rule. I ask 
my Democrat colleagues to reconsider. 
We had an amendment in the Energy 
and Commerce Committee that was re-
jected by the Democrats, although one 
of the members said they would like to 
revisit and fix it. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina as she manages this 
rule and does it in an excellent man-
ner. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the un-
derlying rule and to mention that H.R. 
2467, known as the PFAS Action Act, is 
an important step in the right direc-
tion in providing safe and proper use of 
these chemicals. 
As well, I rise in support of H.R. 2668, 
which is dealing with reinforcing the 
authority of the Federal Trade Com-
mission. 
Likewise, I rise in support of H.R. 
3985, and I thank JASON CROW for his 
leadership. That is, of course, expand-
ing the Afghan Allies Protection Act of 
2009 to expedite the Special Immigrant 
Visa process for certain Afghan allies, 
and for other purposes. 
Mr. Speaker, we could not be making 
a more important statement and doing 
a more important act. We are making a 
statement that says that we do not for-
get our friends, our allies. 
As a Member of the United States 
Congress since before 9/11, and having 
interacted with the Afghanistan Gov-
ernment during the early years, the 
creation of that government in Kabul, 
going to Kabul and talking to the be-
ginning, the embryonic parliamentar-
ians, where there were any number of 
women there in those early years after 
the war as they began to set up their 
government, being a part of looking at 
their constitution and having input 
into its democratic ideals, I know what 
can happen when America leaves. 
What happened when America left 
after the Iraq war? Schools with girls 
were burned. Parliamentarians that 
were women lost their lives. 
This is a dangerous condition, sadly. 
Those allies who provided us services, 
who were translators, who provided the 
civilian services, they are in danger. 
This is the right direction. I thank 
the administration for working with us 
and working with Mr. CROW. I am a co-
sponsor of this legislation. It is time to 
move this now. I really hope the other 
body seriously takes into account that 
we are saving lives. 
As the co-chair of the Afghan Caucus, 
I think it is crucial for us to save lives. 
This is an important initiative. We 
need to do more. I think there are 8,000 
visas. We need to do more, but this is 
an excellent step. I really support the

efforts of Mr. CROW and thank him for 
his leadership. 
We are going to be monitoring this. 
We must monitor what the Taliban is 
doing, and we must make sure that 
lives are saved. 
b 1500 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how many additional 
speakers the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina has. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I have no ad-
ditional speakers. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, Republicans agree that 
PFAS 
contamination 
must 
be 
ad-
dressed, and it must be addressed 
quickly. 
But 
requiring 
a 
blanket 
CERCLA designation for a family of 
over 9,000 compounds is not only unten-
able; it circumvents the science and 
the ongoing work at the Environ-
mental Protection Agency. 
I do want to point out that yesterday 
I had posed a question in the Rules 
Committee if there had been a hearing 
in the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. I was assured that there had 
been. But, in fact, those hearings oc-
curred in the previous Congress. 
There was a reference to PFAS in the 
budgetary hearing for the Environ-
mental Protection Agency, and there 
was likewise a tangential reference in 
a reauthorization of a water bill, but 
for an issue that is this involved, it 
seems that this required its own sepa-
rate hearing within the committee. 
The Chair, who is on the Energy and 
Commerce 
Committee, 
knows 
that 
sometimes these things run together. 
We have worked on this problem for so 
many Congresses that I asked the ques-
tion simply because I couldn’t remem-
ber if there had been an actual hearing 
on this bill in this Congress. But, in 
fact, there has not, and I just want the 
RECORD to accurately reflect that. 
The reason that that is important is 
there are many Members in this Con-
gress who were not Members of the pre-
vious Congress, and we are asking 
them to take a vote today on a terribly 
important piece of legislation. We need 
to provide our colleagues with all the 
facts, and the way we do that in reg-
ular order is through the regular hear-
ing process in an authorizing com-
mittee, like the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
Unfortunately, in spite of the assur-
ances from the chair of the Rules Com-
mittee, that has not happened with 
this bill. 
Another thing really was concerning 
to me yesterday in the Rules Com-
mittee. I had two amendments. I was 
told: Oh, we can’t do those because we 
don’t really know the budgetary im-
pacts of that. 
My gosh, you don’t know the budg-
etary impacts of the entire bill. 
We got a CBO score right at the hear-
ing time yesterday, and the CBO score 
says $280 million of direct expenses 
over the next 10 years. But it has no 
idea of the downstream effects of pass-
ing this legislation or what the result-
ing expenditures would be for Federal 
and State governments. We have no 
earthly idea what the actual cost of 
this is. 
I would just simply submit, to reject 
amendments brought in good faith by 
Republicans because you don’t have all 
the budgetary information at hand 
when the Congressional Budget Office 
really cannot provide us the proper 
budgetary direction on the underlying 
bill, you begin to see the discrepancy 
and why that yields so much frustra-
tion. 
As a result, no Republican amend-
ments to try to improve the bill were 
considered because of the indetermi-
nate budgetary effects. It seems to me 
that a bill focused on consumer safety 
should not be limited by procedural 
issues. 
Those very same procedural issues, 
Mr. Speaker, can be waived by the 
Committee on Rules. That is what we 
do. We waive things all the time. But 
in this case, we couldn’t find the addi-
tional energy to be able to do that. 
Additionally, the rushed bill to over-
turn the Supreme Court’s decision on 
the Federal Trade Commission’s sec-
tion 13(b) authority to seek monetary 
relief will only make monetary relief 
the go-to remedy for every FTC viola-
tion, with no guardrails. 
Creating new agency authority that 
affects consumers should not be under-
taken so lightly and should not be 
rushed through committee without full 
consideration of the issue. This bill 
does nothing to advance Federal pri-
vacy standards that are needed to over-
come the patchwork of State laws and 
increase our ability to negotiate a new 
data-sharing agreement with the Euro-
pean Union. 
Again, I would just stress that an 
amendment offered by Mr. BILIRAKIS in 
committee—and I offered it again yes-
terday in the Rules Committee—to try 
to make this a more bipartisan and 
reasonable approach was rejected on 
party lines. That is not the way that 
we should be governing. 
Finally, the ALLIES Act will in-
crease the ability of certain Afghans to 
obtain Special Immigrant Visas. These 
Afghans worked alongside our troops 
for years to make their country a bet-
ter place, often at significant risk to 
their own lives and their families’ 
lives. We must ensure that they are 
properly and thoroughly vetted so that 
the Taliban and jihadist militias can-
not exploit our generosity. We must 
also not leave behind those who risked 
their lives to aid our Armed Forces. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the previous question, and I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on the rule. I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
It is long overdue for Congress to 
take comprehensive action to address 
the PFAS contamination of our envi-
ronment and its health impacts on 
Americans. I have seen this in North 
Carolina. 
Industry has known of the danger of 
PFAS contamination for decades, yet 
we still lack significant Federal pro-
tections. 
We cannot continue to let these man-
made chemicals endanger the health of 
our people and our planet. 
H.R. 2467 will protect Americans and 
our environment by setting standards 
for our drinking water, instituting 
comprehensive PFAS testing require-
ments, providing grants to utilities 
that are treating contamination, and 
so much more. 
I also support H.R. 2668 to solidify 
the FTC’s ability to retrieve money for 
victims of frauds and scams. We cannot 
allow American consumers and busi-
nesses to fall victim to fraud without 
holding scammers and bad actors fi-
nancially accountable. This emergency 
legislation will help make Americans 
who have fallen victim to fraud whole. 
Lastly, I support H.R. 3985 to keep 
our Nation’s promises to our Afghan 
allies and protect those who helped 
protect us. We owe it to those who put 
their lives on the line for our Armed 
Forces. We also owe it to our service-
members, who will continue to rely in 
the future on allied interpreters, con-
tractors, and security personnel in for-
eign lands. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the rule governing debate 
of H.R. 2668, the ‘‘Consumer Protection and 
Recovery Act’’, which will ensure that the Fed-
eral Trade Commission (FTC) can protect 
American consumers and put money back in 
the pockets of consumers who have been the 
victims of fraud and other scams by amending 
the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) 
to explicitly provide the FTC the ability to ob-
tain both injunctive and monetary equitable re-
lief for all violations of the laws it enforces. 
Specifically, this bill would: 
Add a new subsection (e) to section 13 of 
the FTC Act that specifies types of equitable 
relief the FTC may pursue: restitution for 
losses, contract reformation and recission, 
money refunds, and the return of property; 
Provide the FTC disgorgement authority to 
seek court orders requiring bad actors repay 
unjust gains acquired in violation of the law. 
Clarify that the FTC may seek temporary re-
straining orders and preliminary injunctions 
without bond and that any relief sought under 
section 13(b) may be for past violations in ad-
dition to ongoing and imminent violations. 
As the Nation’s premier consumer protection 
agency, the FTC is directed to enforce numer-
ous statutes: the core of which is section 5 of 
the FTC Act mandating the agency to prevent 
unfair or deceptive acts or practices and unfair 
methods of competition. 
Section 13(b) of the FTC Act authorizes the 
FTC to bring suit in federal courts seeking re-
lief for consumers and is a critical enforcement 
tool the FTC uses to combat fraud and scams 
under section 5. 
In 2020 alone, the FTC returned more than 
$482 million to over 1.6 million consumer vic-
tims of fraud or illegal business practices. 
The FTC’s restitution authority under section 
13(b) was settled law for over 40 years, but

July 20, 2021 
beginning in 2017, the Seventh Circuit Court 
of Appeals reversed its own precedent to 
overturn FTC authority under section 13(b) to 
obtain monetary relief and the Third Circuit 
soon followed. 
Because of these decisions, close to 48 mil-
lion Americans in six states became unable to 
obtain monetary redress under 13(b). 
Then, on April 22, 2021, the Supreme Court 
held in AMG Capital Management v. FTC that 
section 13(b) does not allow the FTC to seek 
monetary relief or require bad actors to return 
money earned through illegal activity. 
According to Acting Chairwoman Slaughter, 
the Supreme Court decision ‘‘deprived the 
FTC of the strongest tool [the FTC] had to 
help consumers.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, all five FTC Commissioners 
have repeatedly urged Congress to take quick 
action to pass legislation reaffirming FTC au-
thority under section 13(b). 
H.R. 2668 does exactly that, by restoring 
nearly forty years of precedent and giving the 
FTC the ability to protect Americans from 
scams and unethical business practices. 
Americans need this protection, because 
every day, and far too often, individuals in 
Texas and across the country fall victim to fi-
nancial scammers. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has given rise to 
an increase of scams and fraud that prey on 
consumers’ fears and financial insecurities, 
and inaction on this issue is not an option as 
it will only embolden bad actors. 
H.R. 2668 will ensure that the FTC main-
tains its ability to return money to the victims 
of scams. 
Seniors especially need this protection, be-
cause they have worked their entire lives with 
the promise of a safe and secure retirement, 
but scammers and unscrupulous businesses 
are taking advantage of uncertainty sur-
rounding the pandemic and working overtime 
to target them. 
Retirement accounts are not the only dam-
age these scams cause—they damage the 
independence and trust of a vulnerable com-
munity. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, we have 
seen instances of fraud rise in unprecedented 
numbers, as scammers attempt to take advan-
tage of senior citizens and deprive them of 
their hard-earned savings. 
Bad actors preying on older Americans is, 
unfortunately, nothing new, but in the midst of 
a global pandemic impacting Americans’ lives 
and livelihoods, cracking down on those 
scams must be a priority. 
One such scam was thwarted by Houston 
police and the Harris County District Attorney, 
who made an arrest in February in an inter-
national cyber-scam that bilked unsuspecting, 
mostly elderly victims out of more than $1 mil-
lion. 
One victim of the scam, Asuncion Peppers, 
74, a retired medical technician knows that 
first hand; She was bilked out of her life sav-
ings. 
Hackers 
contacted 
Ms. 
Peppers 
on 
Facebook, pretending to be one of her 
Facebook friends. 
She was told she was eligible for a govern-
ment grant of almost one million dollars and 
all she had to do was send a check to pay 
taxes. 
Investigators believes the scammers were 
operating from Nigeria, defrauding senior citi-
zens in the U.S. and around the world. 
Before Ms. Peppers realized she was being 
conned, she sent checks totaling $87,000 
hard-earned money. 
She said that she worked three jobs to build 
her life savings. 
Ms. Peppers and her husband are just two 
of 38 victims bilked out of more than $1.3 mil-
lion before the fraud was discovered. 
This story is not an isolated incident: al-
though 1 in 20 seniors in the U.S. is a target 
of fraud schemes, the National Adult Protec-
tive Services Association has found that only 
1 in 44 seniors report that they are victims of 
a fraud scheme. 
During these unprecedented times, it is im-
perative that Congress pass legislation that 
protects U.S. consumers and honest busi-
nesses from wrongdoers who steal money 
through fraud and deception. 
Mr. Speaker, we need to strengthen federal 
prevention efforts and ensure leaders in the 
public and private sectors are collaborating on 
effective safeguards. 
This begins with ensuring that the FTC has 
the explicit authority to obtain both injunctive 
and monetary relief for all violations of the 
laws it enforces. 
I urge all members to join me in voting for 
the rule and the underlying legislation, H.R. 
2668, the ‘‘Consumer Protection and Recovery 
Act.’’ 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. BURGESS is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 535 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 8 Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (S. 
1867) to require the Director of National In-
telligence to declassify information relating 
to the origin of COVID–19, and for other pur-
poses. All points of order against consider-
ation of the bill are waived. The bill shall be 
considered as read. All points of order 
against provisions in the bill are waived. The 
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the bill and on any amendment 
thereto to final passage without intervening 
motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Permanent Se-
lect Committee on Intelligence; and (2) one 
motion to commit. 
SEC. 9 Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of S. 1867. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time, and I move the 
previous question on the resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 216, nays 
207, not voting 7, as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-

Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Preserving

munications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 251(e)) is 
amended by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(5) MORATORIUM ON NUMBER REASSIGNMENT 
AFTER DISASTER DECLARATION.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—In the case of a number 
assigned to a subscriber for the provision of 
fixed wireline voice service at a location in a 
designated area during a covered period— 
‘‘(i) the number may not be reassigned, ex-
cept at the request of the subscriber; and 
‘‘(ii) the assignment of the number may 
not be rescinded or otherwise modified, ex-
cept at the request of the subscriber. 
‘‘(B)

riod expires. 
‘‘(C) SUBSCRIBER RIGHT TO CANCEL AND RE-
SUBSCRIBE.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—In the case of a number

onstrates to the provider of the service (or, 
under subclause (II), any other provider of 
fixed wireline voice service that serves the 
local area) that the residence where the 
number is located is inaccessible or uninhab-
itable— 
‘‘(I) the provider may not charge the sub-
scriber an early termination or other fee in 
connection with the cancellation of such 
service, if cancelled during the covered pe-
riod or the extension of the period described 
in subparagraph (B); and 
‘‘(II) if the subscriber cancels the service 
during the covered period or the extension of 
the period described in subparagraph (B), the

such number is available in the location of 
such different residence); and 
‘‘(bb) may not charge the subscriber a con-
nection fee or any other fee relating to the 
initiation of fixed wireline voice service. 
‘‘(ii) CANCELLATION
WITHOUT
DEMONSTRA-
TION

not demonstrate to the provider of such serv-
ice that the residence where the number is

DESERT LOCUST CONTROL ACT 
H.R. 1079 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Desert Lo-
cust Control Act’’. 
SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States to 
prioritize efforts to control the ongoing 
desert locust outbreak in East Africa and 
other affected regions, mitigate the impacts 
on food security, economic productivity, and 
political stability, improve interagency co-
ordination to prevent future outbreaks, and 
promote resilience in affected countries. 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The United States Agency for Inter-
national Development reports that countries 
in East Africa are currently suffering the 
worst desert locust outbreak in decades, 
which will devour crops and pasture and de-
stroy local livelihoods across the region. 
(2) As of December 2020, the Food and Agri-
culture Organization reported that there 
were 42 million people experiencing acute 
food insecurity in East Africa, which num-
bers are projected to increase if the desert 
locust outbreak is not controlled. 
(3) The desert locust outbreak in East Afri-
ca, particularly in Kenya, Ethiopia, and So-
malia, is negatively impacting food security, 
local livelihoods and economic productivity, 
and may threaten political stability in the 
region. 
(4) Proactive investments now to control 
the desert locust outbreak could reduce the 
need for a much larger United States human-
itarian response effort later, as well as sup-
port economic and political stability and 
build resilience in affected countries. 
(5) In order to optimize the United States 
response to the desert locust outbreak, an 
interagency working group should be estab-
lished to develop and implement a com-
prehensive, strategic plan to control the 
desert locust outbreak in East Africa and 
other affected regions, mitigate impacts on 
food security, economic productivity, and 
political stability and prevent future out-
breaks.

SECURING AMERICA FROM EPIDEMICS ACT 
H.R. 2118 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Securing 
America From Epidemics Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Due to increasing population and popu-
lation density, human mobility, and ecologi-
cal change, emerging infectious diseases pose 
a real and growing threat to global health 
security. 
(2) While vaccines can be the most effec-
tive tools to protect against infectious dis-
ease, the absence of vaccines for a new or 
emerging infectious disease with epidemic 
potential is a major health security threat 
globally, 
posing 
catastrophic 
potential 
human and economic costs. 
(3) The COVID–19 pandemic has infected 
more than 119,960,700 individuals and has 
killed at least 2,656,822 people worldwide, and 
it is likely that unreported cases and deaths 
are significant. 
(4) Even regional outbreaks can have enor-
mous human costs and substantially disrupt 
the global economy and cripple regional 
economies. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West 
Africa killed more than 11,000 and cost 
$2,800,000,000 in losses in the affected coun-
tries alone. 
(5) While the need for vaccines to address 
emerging epidemic threats is acute, markets 
to drive the necessary development of vac-
cines to address them—a complex and expen-
sive undertaking—are very often critically 
absent. Also absent are mechanisms to en-
sure access to those vaccines by those who 
need them when they need them. 
(6) To address this global vulnerability and 
the deficit of political commitment, institu-
tional capacity, and funding, in 2017, several 
countries and private partners launched the 
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innova-
tions (CEPI). CEPI’s mission is to stimulate, 
finance, and coordinate development of vac-
cines for high-priority, epidemic-potential 
threats in cases where traditional markets 
do not exist or cannot create sufficient de-
mand. 
(7) Through funding of partnerships, CEPI 
seeks to bring priority vaccines candidates 
through the end of phase II clinical trials, as 
well as support vaccine platforms that can 
be rapidly deployed against emerging patho-
gens. 
(8) CEPI supported the manufacturing of 
the 
United 
States-developed 
Moderna 
COVID–19 vaccine during its Phase 1 clinical 
trial, and CEPI has initiated at least 12 part-
nerships to develop vaccines against COVID– 
19. 
(9) CEPI is co-leading COVAX, the vaccines 
pillar of the ACT–Accelerator, which is a 
global collaboration to quickly produce and 
equitably distribute safe and effective vac-
cines and therapeutics for COVID–19. 
(10) Support for and participation in CEPI 
is an important part of the United States 
own health security and biodefense and is in 
the national interest, complementing the 
work of many Federal agencies and pro-
viding significant value through global part-
nership and burden-sharing. 
SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR UNITED STATES

REAFFIRMING COMMITMENT TO MEDIA 
DIVERSITY 
H. RES. 277 
Whereas the principle that an informed 
and engaged electorate is critical to a vi-
brant democracy is deeply rooted in our laws 
of free speech and underpins the virtues on 
which we established our Constitution, ‘‘in 
Order to form a more perfect Union, estab-
lish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, 
provide for the common defence, promote 
the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings 
of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity 
. . .’’; 
Whereas having independent, diverse, and 
local media that provide exposure to a broad 
range of viewpoints and the ability to con-
tribute to the political debate is central to 
sustaining that informed engagement; 
Whereas it is in the public interest to en-
courage source, content, and audience diver-
sity on our Nation’s shared telecommuni-
cations and media platforms; 
Whereas the survival 
of 
small, 
inde-
pendent, and diverse media outlets that 
serve diverse audiences and local media mar-
kets is essential to preserving local culture 
and building understanding on important 
community issues that impact the daily 
lives of residents; 
Whereas research by the American Society 
of News Editors, the Radio Television Digital 
News Association, the Pew Research Center, 
and others has documented the continued 
challenges of increasing diversity among all 
types of media entities; 
Whereas with increasing media experience 
and sophistication, it is even more impor-
tant to have minority participation in local 
media to ensure a diverse range of informa-
tion sources are available and different ideas 
and viewpoints are expressed to strengthen 
social cohesion among different commu-
nities; and 
Whereas the constriction in small, inde-
pendent, and diverse media outlets and lim-
ited participation of diverse populations in 
media ownership and decision making are 
combining to negatively impact our goal of 
increasing local civic engagement and civic 
knowledge through increased voter partici-
pation, membership in civic groups, and 
knowledge of local political and civil infor-
mation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) reaffirms its commitment to diversity 
as a core tenet of the public interest stand-
ard in media policy; and 
(2) pledges to work with media entities and 
diverse stakeholders to develop common 
ground solutions to eliminate barriers to 
media diversity. 
ENCOURAGING REUNIONS OF DIVIDED KOREAN- 
AMERICAN FAMILIES 
H. RES. 294 
Whereas the Korean Peninsula, with the 
Republic of Korea (in this resolution referred 
to as ‘‘South Korea’’) in the South and the 
Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (in 
this resolution referred to as ‘‘North Korea’’) 
in the North, remains divided following the 
signing of the Korean War Armistice Agree-
ment on July 27, 1953; 
Whereas the division of the Korean Penin-
sula separated more than 10,000,000 Korean 
family members, including some who are 
now citizens of the United States; 
Whereas there have been 21 rounds of fam-
ily reunions between South Koreans and 
North Koreans along the border since 2000; 
Whereas Congress signaled its support for 
family reunions between United States citi-
zens and their relatives in North Korea in 
section 1265 of the National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 
110–181), signed into law by President George 
W. Bush on January 28, 2008; 
Whereas most of the population of divided 
family members in the United States, ini-
tially estimated at 100,000 in 2001, has signifi-
cantly dwindled as many of the individuals 
have passed away; 
Whereas the summit between North Korea 
and South Korea on April 27, 2018, has 
prioritized family reunions; 
Whereas the United States and North 
Korea have engaged in talks during 2 his-
toric summits in June 2018 in Singapore and 
February 2019 in Hanoi; and 
Whereas many Korean Americans are wait-
ing for a chance to meet their relatives in 
North Korea for the first time in more than 
60 years: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) calls on the United States and North 
Korea to begin the process of reuniting Ko-
rean-American divided family members with 
their immediate relatives through ways such 
as— 
(A) identifying divided families in the 
United States and North Korea who are will-
ing and able to participate in a pilot pro-
gram for family reunions; 
(B) finding matches for members of such 
families through organizations such as the 
Red Cross; and 
(C) working with the Government of South 
Korea to include American citizens in inter- 
Korean video reunions; 
(2) reaffirms the institution of family as 
inalienable and, accordingly, urges the res-
toration of contact between divided families 
physically, literarily, or virtually; and 
(3) calls on the United States and North 
Korea to pursue reunions as a humanitarian 
priority of immediate concern. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 7 of House Resolution 
535, the ordering of the yeas and nays 
on postponed motions to suspend the 
rules with respect to such measures is 
vacated to the end that all such mo-
tions are considered as withdrawn. 
The question is on the motion offered 
by the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bills and agree to 
the resolutions. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 319, nays

A message in writing from the Presi-
dent of the United States was commu-
nicated to the House by Ms. Kaitlyn 
Roberts, one of his secretaries. 
f 
CONSUMER PROTECTION AND 
RECOVERY ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, pursu-
ant to House Resolution 535, I call up 
the bill (H.R. 2668) to amend the Fed-
eral Trade Commission Act to affirma-
tively confirm the authority of the 
Federal Trade Commission to seek per-
manent injunctions and other equi-
table relief for violations of any provi-
sion of law enforced by the Commis-
sion, and ask for its immediate consid-
eration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). Pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 535, in lieu of the amendment in 
the

the bill, as amended, is considered 
read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as

OF
PROP-
ERTY.—In a suit brought under subsection

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2668. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 2668, the Consumer Protection 
and Recovery Act. 
This legislation is essential to pro-
tect consumers and honest businesses 
across the country. It restores a crit-
ical tool of the Federal Trade Commis-
sion to go to court to get victimized 
consumers their money back and make 
lawbreakers return their illegal profits. 
The tool is section 13(b) of the Federal 
Trade Commission Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3731 
July 20, 2021 
For over 40 years, section 13(b) has 
been the FTC’s primary and most effec-
tive means to obtain relief for con-
sumers and businesses. Over just the 
last 5 years alone, the FTC returned 
over $11.2 billion to nearly 10 million 
Americans who had been scammed. 
As one example, the FTC used this 
authority to help relieve veterans and 
servicemembers from crushing student 
debt after they were scammed by the 
University of Phoenix and DeVry. The 
agency has also returned money to sen-
iors and other vulnerable groups often 
targeted by fraud. None of this would 
have been possible without 13(b). 
Congress must act now because, in 
April, the Supreme Court ruled that 
13(b) did not allow the FTC to seek res-
titution for consumers. Instead, the 
Court ruled that the FTC could only 
seek injunctions to stop bad actors 
from violating the law. In the case be-
fore the Court, a criminal payday lend-
er was found to have defrauded con-
sumers of $1.3 billion, but that money 
could not legally be returned to the 
victims. 
Without this legislation, that unjust 
result remains the law of the land. 
That is why this legislation has such 
broad support, including military and 
veterans groups, business organiza-
tions, consumer advocates, unions, and 
the attorneys general of 28 States, in-
cluding both Republican- and Demo-
cratic-led States. That is why the FTC, 
during both the Trump and Biden ad-
ministrations, 
has 
repeatedly 
and 
unanimously begged Congress to act to 
save the consumer protections afforded 
by 13(b). 
The opponents of the bill have mis-
represented and mischaracterized what 
this bill does, in my opinion, Mr. 
Speaker. The Consumer Protection and 
Recovery 
Act 
simply 
restores 
the 
FTC’s ability to seek equitable mone-
tary relief for violations of all the laws 
it enforces, exactly as it has done for 
over 40 years. 
Some say these authorities are ripe 
for abuse. But under this bill, the FTC 
would not be able to bring more cases 
or enact more rules. The bill does not 
allow for civil penalties, fines, or puni-
tive damages. Consumers can only get 
back what they lost, and lawbreakers 
only have to give up their illegal prof-
its. 
Nothing in current law can replace 
the authorities that the FTC has lost. 
The suggested alternative, section 19 of 
the FTC Act, does not protect con-
sumers in all cases and requires proce-
dural hurdles that take far too long for 
any meaningful relief, or any relief at 
all, to reach our constituents. 
This bill ensures consumers are not 
left holding the bag when bad guys 
break the law. The money they get 
back allows hardworking families to 
pay rent, feed their children, buy 
clothes, and make ends meet. 
I thank Representative CA´ RDENAS for 
his leadership on this bill as well as 
Consumer Protection and Commerce 
Subcommittee Chair Jan Schakowsky 
for all her hard work in helping us get 
this bill to the floor today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to put their constituents first 
and support the Consumer Protection 
and Recovery Act, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I had hoped to stand be-
fore you today urging my colleagues to 
support this legislation. Sadly, I must 
oppose because the expansive authority 
included here goes way beyond the new 
agency power I and my colleagues were 
willing to put into statute to ensure 
the FTC has the ability to get financial 
restitution to constituents who were 
victimized by scams as quickly as pos-
sible. So, we do agree on the concept 
but not the details. 
Instead, this bill before us will pro-
vide the FTC with new authorities that 
far outpace the need supported by a 
consensus of the FTC Commissioners. 
Even more concerning, Mr. Speaker, 
as we heard from the former head of 
the FTC’s Consumer Protection Bu-
reau, who testified before our sub-
committee, it signals a return to the 
broad overreach we saw with the FTC 
in previous decades, a situation so bad 
that a Democratic Congress crippled 
the FTC’s funding and stripped it of its 
authority at that particular time. But, 
alas, here we go again. History is re-
peating itself if this piece of legislation 
is passed. 
Separately, H.R. 2668 has been riddled 
with process fouls and has ignored 
well-founded 
concerns 
from 
Repub-
licans, including the lack of needed 
transparency reform and the lack of a 
national privacy standard, which will 
protect consumers. We are overdue for 
this, and we must have a national pri-
vacy standard as soon as possible, Mr. 
Speaker. 
I have heard from my colleagues. 
They claim this bill only establishes a 
statute of limitations, but that simply 
is not the case. In fact, if you listened 
to the rhetoric from my Democratic 
colleagues, you would believe this bill 
was narrowly targeted at fraudsters 
and scammers, but that is not the case. 
Under this bill, the FTC could obtain 
billions in penalties without ever prov-
ing that the alleged company ever 
knew or intended to mislead at all. 
The Supreme Court ruled 9–0, a unan-
imous decision, that the FTC never had 
the authority to grant monetary relief 
under 13(b). Even the liberal Justices of 
the Court, Mr. Speaker, said that 13(b) 
was only designed for injunctive relief. 
We all agree on that. 
So, let’s fix it for the benefit of our 
consumers and any future victims. 
Let’s make sure that they get the res-
titution they deserve. 
An important principle of the Amer-
ican justice system is that the harsher 
the penalty is, the more due process is 
needed. So while I do agree with my 
Democratic colleagues that 13(b) pro-
vides sufficient due process for injunc-
tive relief, the new authorities this leg-
islation bestows on section 13(b) does 
not, however, provide enough due proc-
ess if the penalty is monetary relief. 
Perhaps therein lies my colleagues’ 
true intent. This legislation is not real-
ly to fix a problem or restore a power 
but instead aims to grant the FTC with 
brand-new and unchecked authorities, 
rivaling those of the 1970s, to seek fi-
nancial penalties for what it alleges is 
fraud and anticompetitive acts through 
section 13(b) of the FTC Act. 
To those listening today, do not be 
fooled by the title of this bill. I believe 
it is irresponsible that the Consumer 
Protection and Recovery Act grants 
these new authorities without any 
guardrails to ensure due process re-
mains a foundational American prin-
ciple or to protect American companies 
from egregious enforcements that are 
not intended to protect consumers or 
help them recover from the harm of 
bad actors. 
We all want to go after the bad ac-
tors, Mr. Speaker, but there must be 
due process. 
Now, if it is a clear-cut case of fraud, 
like Volkswagen, then I agree that we 
should be able to use 13(b) to seek mon-
etary relief, and my amendment cap-
tures such acts. That is the exception 
to the legal standard. 
But if the FTC has to look back 10 
years—and that is what we do with this 
particular piece of legislation, if it 
passes—and not have to prove there 
was deceptive intent, as there was in 
Volkswagen, then we need to ensure 
due process before the FTC can take 
money from small businesses and en-
trepreneurs. 
I feel that that is only fair. That is 
why I was proud to offer a compromise 
during our Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee markup, which was the only 
portion of the markup that received bi-
partisan support. My amendment was 
the only one that received bipartisan 
support, and I believe it is fair and rea-
sonable. 
My amendment struck the right bal-
ance between providing the FTC with 
the new authorities to go after bad ac-
tors 
but 
also 
placed 
much-needed 
guardrails to keep the FTC from short- 
circuiting due process and seeking 
disgorgement from small businesses 
unaware of any potential violation. 
Our small businesses are struggling, 
and those that conduct bad acts should 
be punished, absolutely should be pun-
ished. There should be restitution for 
the victims. But our innocent small 
businesses are having a hard time as it 
is. 
b 1645 
One of my Democratic colleagues 
even commented that to go from 5 
years to 10 years will increase the cost 
of businesses’ errors-and-omissions in-
surance policies. We must consider 
that as well. 
Now, combine that with no standards 
attached to the behavior in question,

and we will see even more inflation, ul-
timately hurting our small businesses 
and allowing the big guys to pass on 
the cost to constituents, which they 
most likely will do. They have the law-
yers on their side, so they will pass the 
costs on to the constituents. We can’t 
have that. 
Without these guardrails, the FTC 
will create a ripple effect that will kill 
small businesses, unfortunately, inno-
vation and ingenuity, while raising 
prices in our economy. 
My amendment found the right bal-
ance, I believe, on the statute of limi-
tations to ensure businesses are not 
blindsided by the assertion of claims 
long after the potential conduct, when 
evidence may no longer be available or 
is stale, and it is only right. Five 
years—I would even compromise and go 
a little higher, but the information 
must not be stale. I would say in most 
States, and also DOJ in some criminal 
cases, the statute is roughly 5 years. In 
most States, approximately 5 to maybe 
7 years, at the most. 
While shortening the statute, it also 
provides the FTC with a unique, equi-
table tolling period to allow the FTC 
the ability to seek monetary relief be-
yond the 5-year statute of limitations 
in the case of intentionally deceptive 
or fraudulent conduct. This addresses 
examples of the fraudulent behavior 
you will hear from my Democratic col-
leagues, when the FTC failed to act in 
a timely fashion. The tolling language 
is in my amendment. 
Despite receiving bipartisan support, 
the majority rejected this amendment. 
One can only wonder if this is because 
it stands in the way of remaking our 
entire country into a managed econ-
omy and one that, again, strips due 
process rights from its citizens. I hope 
that is not the case. 
Mr. Speaker, as I have said before, 
Republicans and Democrats both want 
to protect consumers. We were in Rules 
yesterday, and we both agreed on that; 
we want to protect our consumers, and 
we want to make sure that they get the 
restitution that they deserve. 
I have stayed at the table to nego-
tiate this and even offered an amend-
ment that went a step further than the 
one I offered in committee. Unfortu-
nately, it fell on deaf ears. The Rules 
Committee did not make my or any 
other Republican amendment in order 
today, ignoring our serious concerns. 
We were concerned about pending 
cases, to make sure that the FTC had 
the time to look at all the pending 
cases, and that would make an excep-
tion to the statute of limitations, the 5 
years. I think we thought of every-
thing. 
To my colleagues, let’s work to-
gether and properly empower the FTC 
to protect constituents and pass a na-
tional privacy standard. This is our op-
portunity. As a matter of fact, the Sen-
ate is working on a bill that includes a 
privacy standard; a 13(b) fix, but also a 
privacy standard. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this particular 
piece of legislation. I want to get back 
to the table and get this right. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), the chairman 
of our Consumer Protection and Com-
merce Subcommittee. She has worked 
long and hard on this legislation. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for all of his hard 
work. I appreciate it. 
It is not every day that we get to 
vote for something that will have an 
immediate and positive impact on our 
constituents like the legislation that 
we have before us today. 
The Consumer Protection and Recov-
ery Act, introduced by TONY CA´ RDENAS, 
is urgently needed right now to ensure 
that the Federal Trade Commission 
can protect consumers by putting 
money back into the pockets of vic-
tims of fraud and scams and other ille-
gal activities. 
The restitution authority under sec-
tion 13(b) of the Federal Trade Com-
mission Act has been the FTC’s most 
effective law enforcement tool. But, 
unfortunately, just a few months ago, 
the United States Supreme Court said 
that somehow the law wasn’t exactly 
written right, and if you wanted to re-
tain that restitution authority, you 
had to go back and fix the law. 
I do want to say that there is not a 
single change in the authorities to the 
FTC, not one. Actually, I take it back, 
there is one. Before there was no stat-
ute of limitations at all, and we did im-
pose a statute of limitations. 
What we know is, for 40 years when 
the FTC had this authority, it was able 
to do such fabulous things, like get 
back almost $62 million for delivery 
drivers in its remarkable settlement 
with Amazon over Amazon’s systemic 
stealing of drivers’ tips. 
It enabled the Federal Trade Com-
mission to recover more than $9.5 bil-
lion from Volkswagen and Porsche for 
consumers who were deceived by false 
advertising about vehicles fitted with 
illegal emissions defeat devices. 
Honest businesses want this legisla-
tion because they don’t want to have 
to 
compete 
with 
fraudsters 
and 
scammers. 
This can’t wait. We have seen new 
bad actors cropping up all over the 
country and taking money out of peo-
ple’s pockets. It is open season right 
now for scammers. Every single day 
that we wait, they get away with the 
scams and not have to put money back 
into people’s pockets. 
I urge my colleagues, join us. There 
are no secrets here. It is the same bill. 
Join us to protect consumers. There 
are plenty of guardrails that have gone 
on for 40 years, and it is time to pass 
this bill now. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. WALBERG), my good 
friend and a great Member. Michigan is 
the home of Tom Brady; at least he 
went to college there, a great Amer-
ican. Mr. WALBERG
is also a great 
American. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman, and we are glad that 
Brady is there. Go blue. 
Mr. Speaker, I have long championed 
bipartisan legislation to increase con-
sumer protections from fraud and 
scams, particularly for our Nation’s 
seniors and vulnerable populations. 
In April, the House passed by an 
overwhelming majority H.R. 1215, the 
Fraud and Scam Reduction Act, which 
I led with my friend and colleague, 
Representative LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER. 
Our bill creates the Senior Scams 
Prevention Advisory Group and the 
Senior Fraud Advisory Office within 
the FTC to better assist the agency 
and employers with monitoring, identi-
fying, and preventing mail, telephone, 
and internet fraud. 
I have also championed legislation 
that cracks down on robocall scams 
and Medicaid patient abuse and fraud. 
These efforts are particularly impor-
tant, as we saw scams increase at an 
alarming rate during the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
But I cannot support H.R. 2668, the 
deceptively mis-advertised bill before 
us today. This bill was rushed through 
an entirely partisan process without 
addressing significant concerns from 
Republicans to protect fundamental 
due process rights and prevent the FTC 
from operating unchecked, as it did in 
the 1970s. 
I hoped the Energy and Commerce 
Committee would have had the oppor-
tunity to hear from the full slate of 
FTC commissioners on this bill, the 
same commissioners who testified in 
the Senate one week prior to our legis-
lative hearing and commented on what 
should be included in any legislative 
fix to 13(b). 
Make no mistake, I fully support giv-
ing the FTC necessary tools to bring 
just 
enforcement 
actions 
against 
fraudsters and scammers, including 
restitution 
for 
harmed 
consumers. 
However, H.R. 2668 gives the FTC these 
new expansive tools without much- 
needed guardrails, all under the guise 
of protecting our constituents. 
Just this past April, in a rare 9–0 
unanimous 
decision, 
the 
Supreme 
Court ruled that section 13(b) of the 
FTC Act does not authorize the Com-
mission to seek, or the Court to award, 
monetary 
relief 
including 
disgorgement or restitution. 
The Court stated that the Commis-
sion grossly misused its authority and 
encouraged Congress to address the 
issue with a bipartisan—and that was 
their term—bipartisan legislative solu-
tion. 
But the bill before us today is any-
thing but bipartisan. This bill would 
grant the FTC a 10-year statute of lim-
itations for this newfound authority, 
allowing the FTC the ability to go 
after conduct that is no longer occur-
ring in the marketplace.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3733 
July 20, 2021 
There is a reason that a 5-year stat-
ute of limitations or less is standard in 
many Federal and State statutes. As 
the committee learned from the former 
head of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer 
Protection, shorter statutes protect 
against surprises through the assertion 
of claims long after the conduct, when 
evidence may be stale or no longer 
available, and encourage the timely fil-
ing of claims by regulatory agencies. 
Republicans on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee tried countless times 
to work with Democrats on a com-
promise solution to these issues, all to 
no avail. 
My good friend, the Republican lead-
er of the Consumer Protection and 
Commerce Subcommittee, Representa-
tive BILIRAKIS, proposed a compromise 
amendment that would allow the FTC 
to go after bad actors while also re-
specting due process rights. His amend-
ment even addressed the concern raised 
from my friends in the majority on the 
statute of limitations. 
This was a sincere offer from Repub-
licans to address Democrats’ concerns 
and meet them halfway, and it even re-
ceived 
bipartisan 
support 
in 
com-
mittee. 
But instead of coming to the floor 
with a bipartisan bill, Democrats re-
jected our efforts and jammed through 
this partisan bill without consideration 
for its consequences. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
H.R. 2668. Come back to the table and 
work with Republicans to find a com-
promise solution that provides the FTC 
the tools to actually protect our con-
stituents. That is what we must ask 
and that is what I ask. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
31⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CA´ RDENAS), the sponsor 
of this legislation. 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Chairman FRANK PALLONE for 
this opportunity to bring the culmina-
tion of over 2 years of working on both 
sides of the aisle to bring this bill to 
fruition. 
It is unfortunate that we weren’t able 
to negotiate more into this bill and 
make it bipartisan, but there will be 
other opportunities, as we are a two- 
Chamber legislature, and I am sure 
that the Senate has some ideas about 
how to make this bill better, and we 
are all open to that opportunity. 
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to 
thank 
Subcommittee 
Chairwoman 
SCHAKOWSKY
for doing an extraor-
dinary job, making sure that we shep-
herd this bill through the process and 
making sure that we keep open lines of 
communication on both sides of the 
aisle so that we can get to this point. 
It is important for us to understand 
that this bill is about the Federal 
Trade Commission’s ability to protect 
consumers 
from 
fraudsters 
and 
scammers. This means that right now 
scammers remain free to steal money 
from hardworking Americans, seniors 
who are falling prey every minute of 
the day to scams on the Internet, to 
veterans who people knock on their 
door and appeal to them and rip them 
off and give them nothing for their 
hard-earned money after defending our 
honor in the military, to single moms 
who sign up to get a higher education 
so they can provide for their children, 
and then end up empty-handed, with 
nothing to show for their hard-earned 
money. Those are the people that 13(b), 
through the FTC, is going to go after 
and restore those funds. 
b 1700 
For example, since 2016, they have re-
stored over $11 billion to American 
families from fraudsters and scammers. 
Yes, it is happening every single day. 
And it is only getting worse. And today 
the United States people stand naked 
with the ability to be able to defend 
themselves. 
The average American family cannot 
afford to hire a lawyer. What the FTC 
does is they appeal to a Federal court 
and they say we have found a bad 
actor. We are ready to take them to 
task. We are ready to restore the 
American families that they are trying 
to destroy and get them their money 
back. That is what 13(b) is. 
We have a balance of power in this 
country. The FTC is part of the admin-
istration. That is one balance of power. 
The United States Supreme Court said 
through a technicality, well, 13(b) 
should not be made available right now 
for the FTC to protect the American 
people. 
And they pointed to Congress and 
said, well, as long as Congress will pass 
the law then they can do their job and 
protect the American people. That is 
what this bill is. 
This bill is simply an opportunity to 
restore the faith of the American peo-
ple in our system that when they get 
ripped off, whether it is in person, or 
on the internet or in whatever manner 
that some scammer is taking advan-
tage of our American people, the FTC 
is going to be there to speak up for 
them, to defend them, and take that 
money back and put it in the pockets 
of those individuals who have been 
ripped off. That is what 13(b) is. 
Today, I am very proud, as an Amer-
ican-born citizen, the son of immi-
grants, to be a Member of Congress, to 
be able to do the work that we are 
doing today to get this bill out of the 
House of Representatives. I urge every 
Member of this House to please help re-
store the faith of the American people 
in us and our system and make sure 
that they understand that we speak for 
them, we hear them, and we know how 
they feel when they get ripped off. And 
the FTC is going to be there through 
13(b) to restore the American people 
and give them the money that was sto-
len from them. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Indi-
ana (Mr. PENCE), a great member of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
H.R. 2668. I agree with my Democratic 
colleagues that the FTC should be rea-
sonably equipped with tools to protect 
consumers. Today, the FTC has been 
able to return $25 million to Hoosiers 
that have fallen victim to fraudulent 
schemes. 
However, as currently written the 
bill before the House today goes beyond 
the FTC’s previous use of 13(b). 
The bill lacks sufficient guardrails 
that would provide checks and balances 
to the Commission’s expanded author-
ity. 
Meanwhile, we haven’t had the op-
portunity to discuss this legislation 
with the full Commission in an open 
and transparent hearing. 
During the markup process we of-
fered 
several 
commonsense 
amend-
ments in a good faith effort to improve 
the bill. 
These amendments would have cre-
ated thresholds of FTC authority and 
clarifying definitions to ensure provi-
sions in this bill could not be abused. 
Unfortunately, these reforms were 
not supported by the majority. 
I am concerned that rushing this leg-
islation through the House may lead to 
higher costs for small businesses with-
out improving protections for the con-
sumers, which is what we all want to 
do. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
underlying bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. CASTOR). 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 
our neighbors back home are tired of 
the scam artists ripping them off, so I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 2668, the 
Consumer Protection and Recovery 
Act. I thank Representative CA´ RDENAS, 
Chair SCHAKOWSKY, and Chair PALLONE 
for moving this bill swiftly to the floor. 
H.R. 2668 fixes a glitch in the laws 
governing the Federal Trade Commis-
sion. Now the FTC is one of our most 
important consumer watchdog agen-
cies, and for 40 years the FTC has been 
able to recover ill-gotten gains and res-
titution for consumers, but a recent 
Supreme Court decision kind of threw 
it back to Congress for us to clarify the 
FTC’s authority. 
This is very important. This is the 
authority that allows the FTC to right-
fully recover moneys for consumers 
when fraudsters cheat them out of it. 
And this is especially important for 
seniors, folks in the Active Duty mili-
tary, veterans, and others because they 
are often targeted by scams like tele-
marketer credit card scams, those 
scam artists that claim that we are 
working for a charitable organization 
that is going to help disabled police of-
ficers or disabled military, these false, 
fake cures that say, pay us this money 
and you are going to be cured of your 
Type 2 diabetes or you won’t be in pain 
anymore. It is so wrong. 
The FTC is working overtime. They 
have particularly been working over-
time during the COVID pandemic be-
cause there have been so many scams 
and frauds.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3734 
July 20, 2021 
We have got to pass this bill so that 
we can empower the FTC to get peo-
ple’s money back. It is that simple. 
In fact, in my home State of Florida, 
just since July 2018, the FTC helped re-
cover over $81 million for over 540,000 
Floridians. 
So if Members don’t support this leg-
islation, you are just giving a green 
light to the fraudsters to steal from 
consumers without penalty. 
That is wrong. We can’t let that hap-
pen. 
I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 
2668. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. 
RODGERS), our great ranking member 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding and for his leadership on the 
subcommittee. 
I rise today, unfortunately, in strong 
opposition to H.R. 2668, the Consumer 
Protection and Recovery Act, which 
represents a missed opportunity for 
both our committee and this Chamber. 
Energy and Commerce has histori-
cally been the committee of bipartisan-
ship and compromise. Unfortunately, 
this bill fails to meet that standard in 
the committee’s rich history. 
The legislation before us today is an-
other go-it-alone approach that we 
have come to expect from House Demo-
crat leadership. 
In all my time on the committee, I 
am not sure I have seen so many proc-
ess fouls or so much disregard for the 
minority as I have with H.R. 2668. 
It fails to include an amendment put 
forward by Representative GUS BILI-
RAKIS, our fearless leader and ranking 
member on the subcommittee that re-
ceived bipartisan support in our com-
mittee markup. 
H.R. 2668 has been shadowed by a se-
ries of procedural fouls beginning with 
the intentional exclusion of Republican 
FTC commissioners from Energy and 
Commerce’s hearing on this legislation 
as opposed to the Senate Commerce 
Committee hearing where they were in-
vited to discuss 13(b) authority at 
length 1 week before. 
Perhaps 
the 
Republican 
commis-
sioners were excluded from our hearing 
because the majority did not want to 
hear the truth about their bill. 
If the majority had led a better, more 
fair process, this legislation would 
have been significantly improved or at 
least built on the trust that we could 
come together on solutions crafted 
around sound legal arguments and 
analysis by all the proper experts. 
To be clear, I share the goal of H.R. 
2668, to protect people from scammers. 
But this bill is missing much-needed 
guardrails that the committee Repub-
licans offered as amendments. 
My biggest concern with this legisla-
tion, it fails to prioritize due process 
and ensuring proper analysis. This bill 
was pushed through a subcommittee 
markup without a good-faith effort to 
address the real concerns that we were 
raising. 
We were given less than a week’s no-
tice late on Friday before the markup, 
and shortly before that DOJ sent us in-
complete answers to a letter addressing 
the legitimate concerns raised by our 
members. This was followed by what 
seemed like a coordinated response to 
our questions for the record from FTC 
Acting Chair Slaughter shortly there-
after. 
Mr. Speaker, committee members on 
both sides of the aisle received just 38 
hours of notice regarding the inclusion 
of this legislation during a full com-
mittee markup resulting in criticism 
from both sides of the aisle. 
I doubt many Members of this House 
believe Congress should operate in this 
manner. I do think we can all agree 
that both Republicans and Democrats 
want to protect people from malicious 
actors and that the FTC must have the 
necessary tools to do so. 
H.R. 2668 grants FTC brand-new au-
thorities under section 13(b) of the FTC 
Act, to seek financial penalties for 
what it alleges is fraud and anti-
competitive behavior. It does so with-
out the inclusion of guardrails to pro-
tect due process. This is a huge, missed 
opportunity to enact a national pri-
vacy standard. 
Last Congress, Senator WICKER right-
fully identified privacy and 13(b) re-
form as policies that could be easily 
legislated together and should. Even 
this 
bill’s 
prime 
sponsor, 
Mr. 
CA´ RDENAS, acknowledged his effort to 
include a national privacy standard 
with a legislative fix for 13(b). 
We must do our job. We cannot have 
California dictating policy for the 
other 49 States. 
If my colleagues are so concerned 
about urgently granting the FTC with 
new authorities to protect people, why 
aren’t we urgently passing a national 
standard, which we all agree will pro-
tect their data privacy? 
This 
legislation 
fails 
to 
address 
much-needed FTC reforms, to increase 
transparency, establish a national pri-
vacy framework, and ensure due proc-
ess. There should be no lack of will to 
take on fraudsters, scammers, and 
abusers of our personal information. 
We need to sit down, work it out, and 
move comprehensive FTC reform legis-
lation forward together. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
We can do better. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCNERNEY). 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 2668, the Con-
sumer Protection and Recovery Act, 
and I am going to urge quick passage of 
this legislation. 
H.R. 2668 would restore the Federal 
Trade Commission’s authority under 
section 13(b) to go after those who have 
stolen money from consumers and en-
able the agency to get this money back 
to the consumers. 
Restoring this authority is in line 
with bipartisan FTC leadership re-
quests, congressional intent, and over 
40 years of practice. 
And restoring this authority is espe-
cially important for congressional dis-
tricts like mine where many are strug-
gling to pay the rent and put food on 
the table. 
Prior to the Supreme Court decision, 
the FTC had used this essential author-
ity to return more than $11 billion to 
consumers who had fallen victim to un-
fair, deceptive, and fraudulent prac-
tices; and that is just since 2016. 
The FTC currently has pending be-
fore it investigations that could result 
in returning $2 billion to consumers if 
this is restored. 
Furthermore, 
the 
COVID–19 
pan-
demic has made the need for this legis-
lation even more urgent. During the 
pandemic, we have seen a rise in scams 
that prey on consumers’ fears and fi-
nancial insecurities. 
Consumers who have been defrauded 
deserve to get their money back. We 
owe it to them to move quickly and 
pass H.R. 2668. 
I thank Representative CA´ RDENAS for 
his hard work and leadership on this 
legislation 
and 
Chairwoman 
SCHA-
KOWSKY
and Chairman PALLONE
for 
moving this piece of legislation today. 
I also thank the Democratic staff of 
the House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee for all their hard work on this 
bill. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this legislation. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. SCHRADER). 
b 1715 
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
that Chairman PALLONE engage in a 
colloquy with me on the effect of this 
bill on small businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, I support the purpose of 
the Consumer Protection and Recovery 
Act to allow the FTC to get money 
back for consumers who have been 
harmed by violations of FTC laws. 
I am concerned that small business 
owners who inadvertently harm cus-
tomers will, on top of paying restitu-
tion, however, get hit with unreason-
able penalties for what was essentially 
an honest mistake. 
As a small business owner, I know 
how difficult it can be to keep up with 
all the rules and regulations that small 
businesses must abide by. And I think 
we should only allow civil penalties for 
punitive damages where bad actors 
knowingly violate the law. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the chairman to 
clarify the extent of this bill with re-
spect to small businesses. 
Mr. PALLONE. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. SCHRADER. I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Oregon for the 
question.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3735 
July 20, 2021 
The intent of this bill is to restore 
the FTC’s authority to secure restitu-
tion not to pile penalties onto small 
businesses that make an honest mis-
take. 
We want to allow the FTC to ensure 
consumers who are harmed by a viola-
tion of the law are made whole. So let 
me be clear. This bill does not allow 
the FTC to impose civil penalties or 
punitive damages. It only allows for eq-
uitable remedies, putting everything 
back the way it was before the viola-
tion occurred. 
When the FTC is going after truly 
bad actors who intentionally preyed on 
consumers, it would need to use the au-
thority under a different part of its 
statute to seek penalties and also meet 
the burden of proof required under that 
additional authority. 
And another important point is that 
this bill actually protects honest small 
businesses from having to compete 
against unscrupulous companies that 
break the law to give themselves an 
unfair advantage. So this bill gives the 
FTC back the tools it needs to ensure 
a level playing field in the market-
place. 
I thank the gentleman from Oregon 
for engaging on this bill and working 
with us on our shared goal of pro-
tecting American consumers. 
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his assurances 
that the intent of this bill is to protect 
consumers and not to hurt honest 
small businesses by subjecting them to 
excessive penalties. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Miss RICE). 
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 2668, the 
Consumer Protection and Recovery 
Act. 
This legislation would restore a key 
authority of the Federal Trade Com-
mission, which allows it to return 
money to consumers who have been de-
frauded by scammers. The FTC has 
used this authority to protect con-
sumers for the past 40-plus years. It is 
often senior citizens, veterans, and 
other vulnerable members of society 
who tend to be victims of scams, that 
benefit most from the FTC’s ability to 
return money. 
But as a result of the Supreme 
Court’s decision, defrauded consumers 
are no longer being protected. Instead, 
they are being left out in the cold at 
one of the worst possible times. 
Around 327,000 people have filed a 
fraud complaint linked to the COVID– 
19 pandemic, according to FTC data. 
And those victims have lost a com-
bined $488 million. Scammers are tak-
ing advantage of the public health cri-
sis and the Court’s decision is ham-
pering the FTC’s efforts to combat this 
fraud. 
That is why it is critical that we pass 
H.R. 2668 to restore the FTC’s author-
ity to seek equitable relief by amend-
ing section 13(b) of the Federal Trade 
Commission Act to provide the FTC 
with express authority to obtain both 
injunctive and monetary equitable re-
lief. 
I thank my colleague on the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce, Rep-
resentative CA´ RDENAS, for introducing 
this bill, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. NADLER), who is the chair-
man of the Committee on the Judici-
ary, and I thank him, also, for working 
with us on this legislation. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the Consumer Protection and Recov-
ery Act. 
This legislation is essential to pro-
moting the Federal Trade Commis-
sion’s mission to enforce antitrust law 
and to protect consumers. For decades, 
the commission has secured monetary 
relief for victims of unfair, deceptive, 
and anticompetitive conduct, such as 
pharmaceutical companies blocking ac-
cess to lower-cost drugs. 
In a recent example, the FTC re-
turned nearly $60 million to patients 
suffering from opioid addiction. But a 
few months ago, the Supreme Court se-
verely weakened one of the FTC’s most 
vital tools for protecting consumers 
and deterring bad conduct by ruling 
that the FTC could not seek monetary 
relief under one of the key statutes 
that it enforces. This legislation would 
reverse the Court’s decision and would 
restore one of the Commission’s crit-
ical tools for fighting monopolists and 
protecting consumers. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the bill’s 
sponsor, Mr. CA´ RDENAS, and I thank 
Chairman PALLONE
and Chairwoman 
SCHAKOWSKY for their leadership to ad-
dress this urgent problem, and I urge 
my colleagues to support this impor-
tant legislation. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I will 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE), who is the chair-
man of the Judiciary Subcommittee on 
Antitrust, Commercial and Adminis-
trative Law. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 2668, the Consumer Protection 
and Recovery Act. 
This critical legislation restores the 
authority of the Federal Trade Com-
mission to hold wrongdoers account-
able under section 13(b) of the FTC Act. 
Until recently, this statute author-
ized the Commission to obtain mone-
tary relief when a corporation has 
harmed consumers or businesses by 
breaking the law. For more than four 
decades, the FTC used this critical en-
forcement tool to secure billions of dol-
lars in relief for consumers that were 
harmed by anticompetitive conduct or 
unfair or deceptive practices. 
In the past 5 years alone, the FTC 
has secured $11.2 billion in refunds to 
consumers through this enforcement 
tool. As Commissioner Rebecca Kelly 
Slaughter recently testified, these im-
portant cases involved combating anti-
competitive 
practices 
by 
pharma-
ceutical companies that contribute to 
the soaring costs of prescription drugs, 
abusive scams targeting veterans and 
older Americans, and numerous other 
examples of harmful conduct. However, 
the Supreme Court severely weakened 
this tool in a recent decision where it 
narrowed the scope of section 13(b) to 
cases involving ongoing harms. 
H.R. 2668 will reverse this disastrous 
ruling by reinstating FTC’s authority 
to obtain both injunctive and mone-
tary relief for all violations of the law 
that it enforces. And what is really in-
teresting when I listened to my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, 
every single speaker said, of course, 
consumers should get their money 
back. Of course, the FTC should have 
this power. And then they express their 
intention to vote against the bill to do 
exactly that—restore the power of the 
FTC to in fact provide that kind of re-
lief. 
I thank Congressman CA´ RDENAS for 
sponsoring this bill. I thank Chairman 
PALLONE and Chairwoman SCHAKOWSKY 
for their extraordinary leadership. This 
bill is about protecting competition 
across our economy from Big Tech to 
Big Pharma. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
stand with consumers and those that 
have been harmed by deceptive, unfair, 
anticompetitive 
practices, 
and 
let 
those consumers and small businesses 
be made whole. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this 
bill. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I will 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PORTER), who is a strong 
advocate for consumers. 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, when I 
was a law professor at U.C. Irvine, I 
wrote a 600-page textbook on consumer 
protection. And luckily for everyone, 
you do not need to read the book to un-
derstand one fundamental truth: No-
body likes to get cheated; not Repub-
licans, not Democrats; not young, not 
old; not White, not Brown, not Black. 
Nobody likes to get cheated. 
But when consumers do get cheated, 
the only way they get justice is if they 
get their money back. The Federal 
Trade Commission has used its author-
ity under section 13(b) of the FTC Act 
to return literally billions of dollars to 
victims of a wide range of scams; ev-
erything from telemarketing fraud to 
companies lying about how their prod-
ucts can be used to prevent or treat 
COVID.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3736 
July 20, 2021 
If a wrongdoer steals from you, it is 
the FTC’s job to put your money back 
into your pocket. The Consumer Pro-
tection and Recovery Act lets the FTC 
return to doing just that. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we need due process in 
this particular bill. I believe that this 
bill is incomplete. We do have to pro-
tect the honest small businesses in this 
country. As a matter of fact, I heard 
just yesterday, from over 100 small 
businesses, and they have real serious 
concerns, legitimate concerns about 
this particular bill. This bill is not 
ready for prime time at this particular 
time. As I said, it is incomplete. 
Mr. Speaker, we must go after the 
bad actors. There must be restitution 
for our victims—there is no question— 
but it has to be fair, with a fair and 
reasonable legal standard. 
Mr. Speaker, on that particular note, 
with regard to the legal standard, 
former head of the FTC Consumer Pro-
tection Bureau and committee witness, 
Dr. Howard Beales stated that a rea-
sonable person standard was an appro-
priate standard to include in any res-
titution or disgorgement legislation. 
He testified that this will ensure that 
the FTC focuses its efforts on bad ac-
tors, not honest small business people, 
but bad actors when using its limited 
resources to bring these claims. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of 
my time to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my good friend, Mr. 
BILIRAKIS, for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1, the Democrats’ 
so-called For the People Act, would 
create a public money slush fund using 
corporate fines to fund political cam-
paigns, including their own. 
Based on numbers from the last elec-
tion cycle, H.R. 1 would add up to an 
average of $7.2 million into each Con-
gressional candidate’s campaign. 
My motion would ensure any fines 
collected by the Federal Trade Com-
mission under this bill would go to the 
victims of fraud and not be used as a 
pathway to fund Congressional cam-
paign coffers—victims, like the thou-
sands of students that were cheated out 
of $62 million by a debt relief scam re-
cently prosecuted by the FTC; or the 
patients with liver disease who spent 
thousands on a supplement that was 
deceptively marketed as a treatment; 
or those struggling with opioid abuse 
who were part of a scheme that over-
charged them for medication to help 
minimize withdrawal symptoms. 
The FTC has worked to ensure these 
victims are compensated. But if H.R. 1 
were to become law, many of these fine 
structures would be weaponized to 
boost public funds given to candidates 
to pay for their campaign mailers, po-
litical consultants, and even attack 
ads. Our focus should be on assisting 
victims, not using public dollars to 
fund our own campaigns. Again, based 
on numbers from the 2020 cycle, that is 
up to $7.2 million per Congressional 
candidate. 
H.R. 1 is often touted by my Demo-
crat colleagues and the media as voting 
rights legislation. This is the furthest 
thing 
from 
the 
truth. 
How 
does 
weaponizing our victim compensation 
system to line the pockets of politi-
cians help people vote, or really help 
people at all? 
Mr. Speaker, if we adopt this motion 
to recommit, we will instruct the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce to 
consider my amendment to H.R. 2668 
that would prevent any public funds 
collected because of this bill from 
going into the campaign coffers of 
Members of Congress or Congressional 
candidates, and instead, keep the fines’ 
process focused on helping the victims 
of fraud. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of the amend-
ment into the RECORD
immediately 
prior to the vote on the motion to re-
commit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Illinois? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge support for the motion 
to recommit at the appropriate time 
and a ‘‘no’’ vote on the underlying bill. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
a ‘‘no’’ vote on the underlying bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, to go back to this bill, 
I know my colleague from Illinois— 
who I like a lot—was talking about 
H.R. 1, but let’s go back to this bill. 
I know that there have been a lot of 
statements on the other side of the 
aisle about, why this bill? They didn’t 
like the process; they didn’t like what 
we were doing. But, look, the bottom 
line is very simple here. For many 
years, the FTC was going after bad ac-
tors and those who were committing 
fraud and scamming consumers, and 
they were basically getting the money 
back that was stolen from the con-
sumers and giving it back to those con-
sumers in a form of restitution. 
The 
Supreme 
Court 
ruled 
they 
couldn’t continue to do that, not be-
cause the Court thought it was a bad 
idea, but they just didn’t think the 
statutory language allowed it. And 
since that time, the FTC—both under 
Democrat and Republican administra-
tions—is asking us to restore that abil-
ity of the FTC to seek restitution and 
give money back to the consumers who 
were defrauded. 
b 1730 
There is nothing else here. That is 
exactly what we are doing. Nothing 
more. 
I don’t really understand the opposi-
tion that is coming from the Repub-
lican side of the aisle because we are 
just making it possible for the FTC to 
do its job effectively, which they were 
doing for so many years when they re-
covered billions and billions of dollars 
for consumers. 
I would say look at the language, 
look at what we are actually doing 
here, and please support this bill be-
cause this is good for everybody in this 
country, regardless of whether they are 
Democrat or Republican, or their ide-
ology. This is not ideological. This is a 
practical way to help the average per-
son. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 2668, the Consumer Protec-
tion and Recovery Act. This legislation re-
stores the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) 
authority to protect consumers and businesses 
from scammers. 
In April 2021, the Supreme Court ruled that 
the FTC can no longer use section 13(b) of 
the FTC Act to ensure monetary relief to 
Americans who have fallen victim to fraudsters 
and scammers. This ruling gutted the FTC’s 
authority and we must act quickly to restore it. 
The FTC has returned $11.2 billion to con-
sumers in the last five years alone, and since 
2018, the FTC has recovered more than $171 
million dollars for almost one million Califor-
nians. Section 13(b) has also helped veterans 
who have been defrauded by for-profit col-
leges and provided relief to low-income fami-
lies gouged by payday lenders. 
The FTC has relied on this authority for four 
decades, and if Congress does not act with 
urgency, millions more Americans will fall vic-
tim to fraudsters with no pathway to reprieve. 
The urgency of this situation cannot be under-
scored enough. There is more than $2 billion 
dollars in 24 pending cases that are currently 
threatened by the FTC no longer having this 
authority. 
If Congress is to protect consumers across 
every state in every district, then we must act 
now. I urge my colleagues to support this bill 
and vote yes. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 535, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I have a motion to recommit 
at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois moves to re-
commit the bill H.R. 2668 to the Committee 
on Energy and Commerce. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois is as 
follows: 
At the end of the committee print, insert 
the following: 
SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR 
CAMPAIGN FINANCE. 
No amounts may be assessed on funds col-
lected pursuant to the amendments made by 
section 2 for purposes of making payments in 
support of a campaign for election for the of-
fice of Senator or Representative in, or Dele-
gate or Resident Commissioner to, Congress.

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H. RES. 289 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that Representa-
tive OBERNOLTE’s name be withdrawn 
as a cosponsor of H. Res. 289. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARTER of Louisiana). Is there objec-
tion to the request of the gentleman 
from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
f 
ALLOW MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE 
DRUG PRICES 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, we hear a lot 
of talk about the soaring costs of pre-
scription drugs, but we seldom hear 
about the sad fact that Medicare is not 
allowed to negotiate prescription drug 
prices. 
Earlier this month, drug companies 
announced yet another painful price 
hike on critical medications. The soar-
ing price of prescription drugs is crush-
ing 
Americans 
at 
the 
pharmacy 
counter, driving up health insurance 
premiums and creating unaffordable 
costs for taxpayers, who finance Medi-
care. That is right. We, the people, 
fund Medicare. Yet, due to an anti-
quated law, Medicare has to pay drug 
prices without the right to negotiate. 
That is why, last week, I led a group 
of my colleagues in sending a letter to 
leadership, demanding that Medicare 
negotiation of drug prices be included 
in the upcoming reconciliation bill. 
This is common sense, and it is long 
overdue. 
According to the CBO, allowing Medi-
care to negotiate drug prices would 
save American taxpayers $456 billion in 
just the first 10 years alone, with those 
savings heading right back into the 
pockets of American families. And it 
would bring down drug prices for all 
Americans, not just Medicare recipi-
ents. Together, we can get this done. 
f 
REQUEST TO CONSIDER H.R. 18, NO 
TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABOR-
TION ACT 
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of taxpayers and, im-
portantly, 
in 
support 
of 
life, 
an 
unalienable right endowed by our Cre-
ator. 
For over 40 years, Democrats and Re-
publicans have come together to in-
clude the commonsense prohibition on 
taxpayer-funded 
abortions, 
better 
known as the Hyde amendment. 
President Biden himself was a vocal 
backer of the Hyde amendment during 
his decades in the Senate. 
Because of Hyde, 2.5 million lives 
have been saved and afforded the 
chance to reach their God-given poten-
tial. 
Yet, as we stand here today, House 
Democrats are advancing an annual 
funding bill that shockingly abandons 
the longstanding Hyde amendment. 
It shouldn’t be controversial to spare 
precious babies and give taxpayers the 
assurance 
that 
their 
hard-earned 
money is not used for abortions. 
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Committees on 
Energy 
and 
Commerce, 
Ways 
and 
Means, and the Judiciary be discharged 
from further consideration of H.R. 18, 
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation in the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
guidelines consistently issued by suc-
cessive Speakers, as recorded in sec-
tion 956 of the House Rules and Man-
ual, the Chair is constrained not to en-
tertain the request unless it has been 
cleared by the bipartisan floor and 
committee leaderships. 
f 
b 1830 
SAVE OAK FLAT 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to save Oak Flat. 
Oak Flat is a sacred land for the San 
Carlos Apache Tribe, a land deserving 
of protection under our Historic Pres-
ervation Act. 
The Resolution Copper Mine, a Chi-
nese company, will completely destroy 
the sacred area and leave behind 1.4 bil-
lion tons of mine tailings waste and 
create a crater 1.8 miles long and 1,000 
feet deep. 
We have to ask ourselves, will we 
allow a foreign-owned mining company 
to create such destruction? Will we 
allow them to devastate a sacred land 
so they can export American natural 
resources to China for their profit? 
No. 
This project would use enormous 
amounts of water and will produce 
toxic waste that will destroy eco-
systems in the area and change the 
landscape forever. 
We must stand against foreign com-
panies destroying traditional cultural 
landscapes. We should not grant China 
this competitive edge. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
1884, the Save Oak Flat Act, so we can 
protect this Tribal sacred area.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3739 
July 20, 2021 
REMEMBERING PATRICIA 
WILKINSON 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
remember 
and 
honor 
Patricia 
Wilkinson of Jackson, Mississippi, who 
recently passed away at the age of 73. 
Pat and her husband, Joe, retired to 
St. Simons Island in my district. 
I had the pleasure of serving with Joe 
in the Georgia General Assembly and 
the greater pleasure of calling Pat and 
him friends. 
Following graduation from the Uni-
versity of Mississippi, Pat followed in 
her older sister’s footsteps to become a 
flight attendant with Delta Airlines. 
She spent 50 years as a highly re-
spected 
senior 
international 
Delta 
flight attendant. 
Outside of work, Pat was an active 
member of the Sandy Springs Society 
and the Woodward Academy Parents 
Council. 
Pat’s love for life and travel was con-
tagious. While she loved flying, noth-
ing could compare to the love she had 
for her family. Her family was the cen-
ter of her world, and she brought joy 
and unconditional love to all. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
her family, friends, and all who knew 
her during this most difficult time. 
f 
CHILD TAX CREDIT LIFTS UP 
FAMILIES 
(Mrs. MCBATH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, there is 
a special place in every parent’s heart 
for summer with our children. My son, 
Jordan, used to put on his little cleats 
and a big hat and run out onto the field 
to play tee-ball with his friends on Sat-
urday mornings. After that, we would 
go to the pool to cool off; eat lunch 
under a shady tree; play in the back-
yard as the day turned to dusk; and 
read a story together as he drifted off 
to sleep. 
Truly, summer is for hardworking 
parents to spend time with the little 
ones that they love most. It is for our 
children to grow and live and learn and 
play. 
That is why I am so proud that we 
just passed the child tax credit into 
law. It means more money in the pock-
ets of middle-class families. Now, over 
680,000 families in my home State of 
Georgia will receive a tax cut, and 
these credits will raise over 160,000 
children in Georgia out of poverty. 
This is more funding for Georgia fam-
ilies to protect our children and to lift 
up our communities. 
f 
MARY WALLACE ‘‘WALLY’’ FUNK 
HAS LED AN AMAZING LIFE 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the former Flying 
Aggie, 
Oklahoma 
State 
University 
graduate, and my Alpha Chi Omega so-
rority sister, Mary Wallace ‘‘Wally’’ 
Funk, who today became the oldest 
woman to have traveled to space. At 82 
years old, Funk has led an amazing 
life, from breaking down gender bar-
riers to careers in aviation, and now 
space travel. 
In my home State of Oklahoma at 
Fort Sill, Funk achieved many firsts, 
including the first female civilian 
flight instructor, first female air safety 
investigator, and the first female FAA 
inspector. 
Persistence is just one of the many 
wonderful qualities to describe Funk. 
When NASA began accepting women to 
go to space in the late 1970s, she ap-
plied three times. 
As a pioneer of the aviation and 
space exploration, Funk’s courage, per-
severance, and leadership has posi-
tively impacted the science industry, 
especially for women. Mr. Speaker, I 
am truly honored to recognize Wally 
Funk for her vast achievements. 
f 
AN EMOTIONAL DAY 
(Mr. CA´ RDENAS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, today 
is a very emotional day for me. I am so 
proud to be a Member of the House of 
Representatives, equally proud to be an 
American-born citizen, and equally 
proud to be raised by my two immi-
grant parents, who always believed 
that in this country, the United States 
of America, you can be the best that 
you can be, and you can do the kinds of 
things that in many parts of the world 
a child of parents with a first- and sec-
ond-grade education doesn’t have the 
opportunity to do. 
Today we passed a bill, with the sup-
port of our staff and colleagues in the 
House of Representatives, to help pro-
tect consumers, to put billions of dol-
lars back in the pockets of individuals 
who have been and unfortunately will 
be ripped off by bad actors across this 
country, but they will be protected. 
The faith of our government to work 
for our people is being restored by re-
storing section 13(b) to the Federal 
Trade Commission. 
Again, this is a very emotional day 
for me because my parents came to 
this country, working in the fields, 
harvesting fruits and vegetables to 
help Americans eat, and I get to be a 
Member of this House, harvesting votes 
to help restore the confidence and faith 
of the American people in our system. 
f 
CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF 
DR. BRIAN TOTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
the career of Dr. Brian Toth. Brian has 
spent a total of 38 years in education. 
He is a passionate and dedicated edu-
cation professional. Dr. Toth started 
his career in 1983 as a math and com-
puter teacher in the Altoona Johns-
town Diocese system. Over the years, 
Brian taught in five different school 
districts, 
eventually 
reaching 
the 
ranks of superintendent. 
He is a proud graduate of Penn State 
University, 
St. 
Francis 
University, 
California University of Pennsylvania, 
and the Indiana University of Pennsyl-
vania. 
His dedication to his students and 
the communities in which he worked is 
admirable. Aside from serving for 18 
years as a superintendent, Dr. Toth is 
the former president of the Pennsyl-
vania Association of School Adminis-
trators and a former PASA governing 
board member where he represented 
IU8 and IU9. 
He also served as a former vice presi-
dent of PA Local Government Invest-
ment Trust, a former PA representa-
tive on the American Association of 
School 
Administrators 
governing 
board, the former president of the 
Pennsylvania School Study Council, 
and the vice chair of the Community 
Education Council. 
I thank Brian for his continued serv-
ice in education and for his dedication 
to his students. May he enjoy his re-
tirement. 
f 
BROADBAND FOR RURAL AMERICA 
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, Congress 
has appropriated well over $300 billion 
to State and local governments over 
the past 14 months to help provide 
broadband access, but we must ensure 
these funds are being utilized to meet 
the needs of rural America. 
This is only possible if Federal 
broadband maps are accurate. Last 
Congress I supported the Broadband 
DATA Act, which was signed into law 
and directed the Federal Communica-
tions Commission, or FCC, to allow 
independent third-party data to chal-
lenge these maps. 
Many States, including Georgia, have 
already done their own work to iden-
tify areas with immediate broadband 
needs. 
I recently sent a bipartisan, bi-
cameral letter to the FCC urging them 
to 
utilize 
data 
from 
the 
Georgia 
Broadband Map program in their new 
mapping program and insisting that 
regular updates be provided to Con-
gress. 
House Agriculture Republicans have 
also marked up the Broadband for 
Rural America Act, which will provide 
targeted assistance to the least-con-
nected residents. 
I look forward to working on bipar-
tisan solutions to ensure every house-
hold has broadband access while being 
good stewards of taxpayer dollars.

gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to the 
situation in Mali declared in Executive 
Order 13882 of July 26, 2019, is to con-
tinue in effect beyond July 26, 2021. 
The situation in Mali, including re-
peated violations of ceasefire arrange-
ments made pursuant to the 2015 
Agreement on Peace and Reconcili-
ation in Mali; the expansion of ter-
rorist activities into southern and cen-
tral Mali; the intensification of drug 
trafficking and trafficking in persons, 
human rights abuses, and hostage-tak-
ing; and the intensification of attacks 
against civilians, the Malian defense 
and security forces, the United Nations 
Multidimensional Integrated Stabiliza-
tion Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), and 
international security presences, con-
tinues to pose an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13882 with respect to the situation in 
Mali.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
LEBANON—MESSAGE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–50) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Leb-
anon declared in Executive Order 13441 
of August 1, 2007, is to continue in ef-
fect beyond August 1, 2021. 
Certain ongoing activities, such as 
Iran’s continuing arms transfers to 
Hizballah—which include increasingly 
sophisticated weapons systems—serve 
to undermine Lebanese sovereignty, 
contribute to political and economic 
instability in the region, and continue 
to constitute an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States. 
For this reason, I have determined that 
it is necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13441 with respect to Lebanon.

47TH ANNIVERSARY OF INVASION 
OF CYPRUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise for this Special Order to com-
memorate the 47th anniversary of the 
invasion of Cyprus by Turkey, and to 
further call attention and demand ac-
tion on the continued Turkish settle-
ment of Varosha. 
On July 20, 1974, a very sad day, Tur-
key invaded the Republic of Cyprus and 
violently captured the northern part of 
the island and established a heavily 
armed occupation force that continues 
to control nearly 37 percent of Cyprus’ 
territory. 
As a result of this flagrant violation 
of international law, 160,000 Greek Cyp-
riots, 70 percent of the population of 
the occupied area, were forcibly ex-
pelled from their homes. In addition, 
approximately 
5,000 
Cypriots 
were 
killed, including five Americans, Mr. 
Speaker, of Cypriot descent. 
b 1845 
More than 1,400 Greek Cypriots re-
main missing since the Turkish inva-
sion, and their fate is still unknown. 
Greek and Turkish Cypriots were 
forcibly divided along ethnic lines and 
remain so to this day. It is utterly baf-
fling why over the past 47 years the 
U.S., the E.U., the U.N. and the inter-
national community writ large have 
failed 
to 
take 
meaningful 
action 
against Turkey for the invasion and 
subsequent occupation of Cyprus. 
Indeed, 
lack 
of 
action 
has 
emboldened Turkey to treat the occu-
pied north of Cyprus as an unannexed 
province of Turkey where Erdogan 
seeks to, among other things, build a 
presidential palace, presumably as a 
precursor to the caliphate he expects 
to lead. 
Decades of failed reunification at-
tempts have jaded even the most opti-
mistic of us. 
Today, after President Erdogan de-
fied warnings from the U.S. and the 
international community, as well as 
U.N. Security Council resolutions and 
went ahead and changed the status of 
Varosha, there can no longer be any 
doubt that with Erdogan leading Tur-
key and Ersin Tatar leading the Turk-
ish Cypriot community, there will be 
no Cyprus solutions, sadly. 
The tragic story of Varosha is per-
haps the true embodiment of the per-
manent harm Turkey’s direct inter-
ference has had on the island. Once 
holding international renown as a pre-
mier tourist destination, it has fallen 
into a state of dilapidation—sadly, Mr. 
Speaker, and I did witness it myself— 
after its lawful inhabitants were forced 
to flee in the face of the Turkish inva-
sion. 
Varosha, particularly the resettle-
ment of its lawful inhabitants, has long 
been a central issue in the negotiations 
for Cypriot reunification. However, 
Turkey 
continues 
to 
unilaterally 
threaten the noble dream of one people, 
one border, one Cyprus. 
Unfortunately, it was not by coinci-
dence that Erdogan chose this day—the 
anniversary of the fateful Turkish in-
vasion of Cyprus—to take this illegal 
action. 
I 
emphasize 
‘‘illegal,’’ 
Mr. 
Speaker. 
Although the events of the Turkish 
invasion 47 years ago are not new, I 
feel it is important that the severity of 
the invasion and its lasting effects are 
not understated or forgotten. We must 
never forget. 
It was then, the Turkish forces eth-
nically cleansed and then fenced off the 
beautiful area of Varosha, holding it 
hostage for decades as a bargaining 
chip in reunification negotiations. All 
despite the two Cypriot communities’ 
intention to reach an agreement on the 
resettlement of its lawful inhabitants. 
The 1979 High Level Agreement made it 
clear that the resettlement of Varosha 
was a unified Cypriot priority, that 
both sides were open to such acts of 
goodwill, and that the United Nations 
should play a role in the resolution of 
the Cyprus problem. 
However, the status quo radically 
changed in 2019 when the Turkish occu-
pation authorities announced their in-
tention, sadly, to open Varosha to 
Turkish settlement, directly contra-
dicting the United Nation’s role and le-
gitimacy on the issue, specifically U.N. 
Security Council Resolutions 482, 550, 
789, and 2483. 
Back in October of 2019, I even wrote 
that 
the 
Turkish 
settlement 
of 
Varosha would be a step in the com-
pletely wrong direction of what the 
Cypriot people want—and I have spo-
ken to the Cypriot people—which is the 
eventual reunification of Cyprus. 
The Republic of Cyprus continues to 
maintain the return of Varosha as a

cornerstone 
of 
confidence 
building 
measures with the Turkish Cypriots, 
including joint ventures seeking to re-
store the dilapidated city. 
Indeed, the present government of 
the Republic of Cyprus proposed a con-
fidence building measure that would 
have turned Varosha over to U.N. con-
trol and allowed the Turkish-Cypriot 
port Famagusta to trade with the 
world under E.U. designation. 
And Famagusta is a wonderful place. 
I had relatives that had to leave during 
the invasion in 1974, Mr. Speaker. They 
lost their homes, they lost their liveli-
hoods, and they moved to Athens. But, 
again, a beautiful place, and it is a 
very sad situation. And it is action we 
need, not words, and that is why I am 
here tonight, Mr. Speaker, to educate 
the American public and the Members 
of Congress. 
So the Erdogan government, Mr. 
Speaker, and the Turkish occupation 
authorities in Cyprus rejected this win- 
win proposal and decided to keep this 
one time jewel—and it is a jewel—of 
the eastern Mediterranean sadly, a 
ghost town. 
Turkish Cypriots, in particular, want 
to be part of the E.U. and share in all 
the economic benefits that their com-
patriots, the Greek Cypriots, enjoy. We 
support them in their efforts and con-
demn Erdogan for using Turkish Cyp-
riots as pawns. That is exactly what he 
is doing. He is using them as pawns to 
help bolster his dismal record on Tur-
key’s economy. 
The world knows that Erdogan is des-
perate and trying to distract from his 
failed leadership in Turkey. With his 
sinking poll numbers, Erdogan must 
shore up his nationalist base ahead of 
Turkey’s 2023 election. That is what 
this is all about. That is why he has 
converted his rhetoric into action and 
moved to reopen parts of Varosha for 
Turkish recreation and tourism. It is 
outrageous, and it must be stopped. 
We need to speak up now before it is 
too late, and fight for the dream and 
hope of an eventual Cypriot reunifica-
tion. These are our allies. These are 
great allies, Mr. Speaker. 
The United States, the U.N., the E.U. 
cannot simply continue to just simply 
offer its sentiments and vocal dis-
pleasure. They must match their dis-
pleasure with action, not limited to 
U.N. management of Varosha as out-
lined in U.N. Security Council Resolu-
tion 550, diplomatic isolation, or sanc-
tions, not limited to just that. 
The permanent Turkish settlement 
of Varosha without justice to the Cyp-
riots who had their homes unlawfully 
taken from them should be the final 
red line for the international commu-
nity that cannot be crossed. We, the 
international community, have an op-
portunity and an obligation to stand 
and fight for justice for our ally, the 
Cypriot people. 
The Cypriot people have a right to 
their dream of a united Cyprus without 
direct interference from the Turks, and 
the displaced Cypriots are entitled to 
return to their homes in beautiful 
Varosha. 
The United States must take real ac-
tion and let Erdogan know in very 
clear terms that the U.S. will no longer 
put up with the blatant exploitation of 
the Cypriot people. And that is what it 
has been all these years. 
Last week, a bipartisan group of U.S. 
Senators led in part by my good friend, 
MARCO RUBIO, called for the Biden ad-
ministration to pursue multilateral 
sanctions if Turkey changes the status 
of Varosha. Senator MENENDEZ has also 
been a great leader in this area, too. 
Turkey crossed that Rubicon today. 
And like it did when we warned them 
not to go ahead with the Russian S400 
purchases, they thumbed their nose at 
the United States Congress, the State 
Department, and the White House. 
It is time that Turkey be held ac-
countable for acting contrary to U.S. 
policy, U.S. interests, and U.S. law. 
And I ask this House to echo the call 
by the Senators asking the Biden ad-
ministration to pursue multilateral 
sanctions in response to Turkey’s fla-
grant violations of international law. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

200 DAYS OF DELIVERING FOR THE 
PEOPLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. NEGUSE) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, Wednes-
day, tomorrow, marks 200 days of this 
Congress and 200 days of House Demo-
crats delivering for the people. 
Together, with President Biden we 
have created millions of jobs since he 
took office at a faster pace than any 
President in U.S. history. Economic 
growth projections are up. Wages are 
up. And unemployment is down. 
With the passage of the American 
Rescue Plan, we have brought needed 
relief to families across the country. 
More than 160 million Americans are 
now fully vaccinated against COVID– 
19. And nearly 70 percent of adults in 
the United States have received at 
least one shot. 
We invested in helping schools reopen 
safely and to make up for lost learning 
time. We sent money to States and to 
local 
communities 
to 
help 
keep 
childcare providers on the job and to 
lower costs for working families. And 
we got more than 163 million economic 
impact payments into the hands of 
hardworking Americans in 2021. 
And last week, child tax credit 
monthly payments began hitting the 
bank accounts of roughly 39 million 
households, covering almost 90 percent 
of children nationwide. That is historic 
tax relief for nearly every working 
family across the United States. 
And behind each of those numbers is 
a family member, a neighbor, a col-
league 
faced 
with 
untenable 
cir-
cumstances, getting the support that 
they need. 
Last week I had a chance to sit down, 
Mr. Speaker, with families in my dis-
trict. I represent northern Colorado. It 
is a wonderful place. Many of these 
families shared with me exactly what 
these child tax credit payments will 
mean for them and for their families. 
Annie in Boulder, a woman that I 
met last Wednesday, is 8 months preg-
nant, and her child tax credit payment 
is helping her pay for healthcare while 
she is on maternity leave until she is 
able to return to work full time. 
Johanna from Fort Collins, already 
received her credit on July 15, and she 
will use that credit to pay for a sum-
mer camp for her son. 
Others shared how these payments 
will help pay for their childcare, for 
food, or rent payments. Child tax cred-
it payments for many Colorado fami-
lies, for many California families, for 
many Texas families, for many Mon-
tana families, for many American fam-
ilies is a lifeline because the payments 
mean money in the pockets of hard-
working parents that will ultimately 
help strengthen our economy and build 
better lives for their families. 
The bottom line is that with the 
child tax credit and with the American 
Rescue Plan, help is here for so many. 
I recently had an opportunity to take 
a road trip across my district to see 
what the American Rescue Plan has 
meant for families in northern Colo-
rado from Boulder County to Larimer 
County up to the Wyoming border from 
Vail to Grand Lake to Bailey, Ever-
green, and many places in between, vis-
iting with families and small business 
owners, childcare workers, and commu-
nities. 
And we heard story after story about 
how these funds are helping our com-
munities, providing support to local 
food banks who have seen skyrocketing 
demands, providing a needed lifeline to 
small business owners and renters, and 
supporting, as I said, our cities and 
counties amidst the unprecedented mo-
ment that we are all experiencing. 
b 1900 
We have always said that at this 
time of unprecedented challenge, we 
could not leave our families or our 
communities to weather this moment 
alone. Well, we have not. President 
Biden has not. House Democrats have 
not. Senate Democrats have not. And 
we will not. 
Mr. Speaker, 200 days—200 days of 
shots in arms, money in pockets, chil-
dren in schools, people in jobs. And our 
work is just getting started, because

we will continue to deliver for the 
American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LIEU), my good 
friend, the co-chair of the Democratic 
Policy 
and 
Communications 
Com-
mittee, someone who has been deliv-
ering for the people in his district in 
California and for the people of our 
country for many years. 
Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, I would ask 
to engage Representative NEGUSE in a 
colloquy to ask a question. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I would 
be happy to entertain the gentleman’s 
question. 
Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, that wonder-
ful tax cut for American families with 
children, did any Republican congress-
man vote for it? 
Mr. NEGUSE. It is funny that you 
ask that question, Mr. LIEU, because 
not a single Republican, not one, voted 
for the child tax credit; no laughing 
matter, as it were. 
Mr. LIEU. That’s right. It was Demo-
crats in the House, Democrats in the 
Senate that got the American Rescue 
Plan signed into law, and President 
Biden enacted it. 
Some of you may wonder, well, what 
else is in this American Rescue Plan. 
So we have this amazing tax cut for 
millions and millions of American fam-
ilies with children, but in addition, the 
American Rescue Plan was designed to 
do four things: To get shots into arms, 
children into schools, people back on 
their jobs, and cash in their pockets. 
And it is doing all four of those. 
We know that since January 20, there 
has been over 3 million jobs created 
under the Biden-Harris administration. 
We know that jobless claims have been 
cut in half. The American Rescue Plan 
had stimulus checks go out to millions 
of Americans who needed cash in their 
pockets. It also provided billions of 
dollars to schools across our country so 
they could reopen safely, and it also 
had money for restaurants and small 
businesses. It had additional economic 
injury disaster grants. It also had shut-
tered venue grants to help those shut-
tered venues. It was so full of programs 
to help the American people that we 
now have projections that our GDP is 
now going to skyrocket. 
We see people coming back into jobs, 
and we see America back on track, and 
not a single Republican voted for that 
American Rescue Plan. 
You know what else was in that plan? 
Funding for local government. I served 
in local government. I was on the Tor-
rance City Council; I loved that job. It 
is very clear to me that one of the big 
aspects of local government funding is 
funding for public safety, funding for 
our firefighters, funding for police offi-
cers. Not a single Republican voted for 
that local funding for public safety. 
This American Rescue Plan was a 
transformative law and it is still con-
tinuing to provide benefits to the 
American people. 
Just a few days ago, as Representa-
tive NEGUSE mentioned, on July 15, 
most American families got a tax re-
fund—hundreds of dollars. This is going 
to happen again the middle of next 
month; they are going to get hundreds 
of dollars again. And then it is going to 
happen again on the 15th of September, 
and again on the 15th of October, and 
again on the 15th of November, and 
again on December 15. 
This is transforming the lives of 
Americans. It is allowing hardworking 
parents 
to 
have 
cash 
to 
provide 
childcare, cash to get gas for their car, 
to go to work, to get back into our 
economy, get back into the labor mar-
ket; and again, not a single Republican 
in the House or in the Senate voted for 
the American Rescue Plan. And this 
was just the first 6 months of Demo-
crats in control. 
What did the Republicans do when 
they were in control? Well, they also 
did give tax cuts, except it went to the 
top 1 percent. It went to billionaires. 
And all of you know that, because you 
didn’t get a tax cut. You would have 
remembered if you did, but you didn’t. 
The American people actually did not 
get this, because it went mostly to bil-
lionaires. 
Democrats and Republicans, very 
starkly different. The first 6 months in 
office, we chose to give a tax cut to the 
middle class, to families with children, 
and we are not done. Now we are work-
ing on the American Jobs Plan that is 
going to have an infrastructure compo-
nent. It is going to have money for 
elder care. It is going to have work-
force retraining. It is going to help re-
store the millions of jobs that were lost 
during this pandemic. We are working 
on the American Families Plan, be-
cause this amazing tax cut for families 
with children, we want to make it per-
manent. We want to give Republicans 
another chance to vote for it, because 
we want to make this tax cut for fami-
lies with children permanent. Hope-
fully, we are going to get bipartisan 
support for that. 
What else is going to be in the Amer-
ican Jobs Plan and the American Fam-
ilies Plan? It is going to have funding 
also for education. Studies show that 
in terms of education, the most impact 
it can have on a human being’s life is 
under the age of five. So we are going 
to have funding to have universal pre-
school for three- and four-year-olds. 
This is when their brains are devel-
oping. This is when you can have tre-
mendous impact that is going to affect 
them for the rest of their lives. 
We are going to extend higher edu-
cation funding to provide free commu-
nity college for anyone who wants it. 
We are in the 21st century now. We 
simply have to expand our education. 
People have to learn more skills so 
they can prepare for the economy of 
the 21st century. 
Hopefully, Republicans will join us. 
Hopefully, we will get bipartisan sup-
port, and we will continue to make 
America as great as we want it to be 
and to move forward on a bipartisan 
basis. We ask Republicans to join us, 
but for now, we do know not a single 
one of them voted for the American 
Rescue Plan. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished gentleman from Cali-
fornia. 
If the distinguished gentleman from 
California might be willing to engage 
in a brief colloquy with me, I would be 
interested in yielding to him. 
I was fully aware that the House Re-
publicans didn’t vote in favor of the 
child tax credit, but you mentioned a 
litany of other programs that have 
come to pass over the course of the last 
200 days that have had a dramatic im-
pact on the American people. 
Is it your understanding that no Re-
publicans voted for, for example, the 
Restaurant Revitalization Fund as part 
of the American Rescue Plan? 
Mr. LIEU. That is correct. Even 
though a number of them took credit 
for that program, they actually didn’t 
vote for it. So I don’t want the Amer-
ican people to be confused. If your Re-
publican Member of Congress claims 
credit for the American Rescue Plan, 
they did not vote for it. But hey, if 
they want to talk good things about it, 
we are happy to accept it, but your Re-
publican Member of Congress did not 
vote for the American Rescue Plan. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Well, Mr. LIEU, I 
couldn’t agree with you more. And you 
make a very interesting and salient 
point, because as we reflect on the 200 
days with House Democrats leading the 
charge here in the Congress, pushing to 
get money in pockets and restaurant 
revitalization funds and funds for small 
businesses and the child tax credit pay-
ments, and funds for our schools and 
funds for firefighting departments and 
local 
communities, 
we 
know 
that 
House Democrats have been working 
for the people. 
And while it is unfortunate that the 
House Republican Caucus has been un-
willing to partner with us in this ef-
fort, we certainly hope that they will 
come around. 
Mr. Speaker, as you know, one of the 
privileges of serving in this august 
body is meeting giants. The Speaker, of 
course, is familiar with the refrain that 
we stand on the shoulders of giants, 
and that is certainly the case in the in-
stance of the colleague of whom I have 
the honor of recognizing, someone who 
has been a voice for the voiceless, who 
has been a champion for working fami-
lies in our country, for doing every-
thing that she can possibly do to eradi-
cate poverty, not just in the State of 
California, but across the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LEE), my 
distinguished colleague and friend. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
first, let me thank my colleague and 
the gentleman from Colorado for his 
gracious comments, remarks, and lead-
ership. And just know that we are in 
this together, and we have been in this 
together for a long, long time. And this 
is really working for the American peo-
ple. It is in our blood. We have no op-
tion. And you certainly—in the short

time you have been here—you cer-
tainly have hit the ground running and 
have shown who you are and whose you 
are. So thank you, again, so much. 
And to, of course, our co-chair, Mr. 
LIEU, let me just say thank you for 
your clarity of purpose and making 
sure that—yourself and Mr. NEGUSE— 
making sure that the truth is told. And 
oftentimes, we forget that the truth 
shall set you free. But I always marvel 
at you, Congressman LIEU, and Mr. 
NEGUSE, especially when you are on the 
media. You don’t pull any punches. 
You tell the truth; you cut through all 
the noise. And I think the American 
people deserve that. Thank you both 
for that, and thank you for giving us a 
chance to be with you this evening. 
Mr. Speaker I rise also with my col-
leagues to highlight the fact that 
House Democrats have delivered for 
the people in the first 200 days of this 
Congress. House Democrats and the 
Biden administration have begun build-
ing back bolder. We have helped tackle 
this virus head on by putting shots in 
people’s arms, and money in people’s 
pockets. 
And, yes, to address the crisis of pov-
erty in this country, the American 
Rescue Plan expanded and improved 
the child tax credit, which I had the 
honor of working with my colleagues, 
Congresswoman 
LUCILLE
ROYBAL- 
ALLARD, and our chair of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations, Congress-
woman ROSA DELAURO, to establish the 
foundation for this. 
This benefit has made a significant 
impact on the lives of hundreds of 
thousands of struggling families, espe-
cially for communities of color. In my 
district alone, the newly improved tax 
credit will directly benefit 108,600 chil-
dren. That’s in the Golden State of 
California. Child poverty is about the 
highest in the country. And it will lift 
over 10,000 children out of poverty. 
Now, for the people, we must make it 
permanent. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just say that 
Democrats, we rescued Republicans. 
There were zero—mind you—zero Re-
publican votes, as my colleagues have 
said over and over again, for the cre-
ation, for example, of 3 million jobs, 
for 
investing 
$130 
billion 
to 
help 
schools reopen safely. There were zero 
Republican votes for the child tax cred-
it and for putting money into the pock-
ets of American families who, through 
no fault of their own, have been living 
on the edge, struggling to survive, beg-
ging for help. 
Well guess what? Democrats deliv-
ered for everyone; everyone, regardless 
of their party affiliation, regardless of 
who they voted for, or even if they 
didn’t vote. And, yes, some Repub-
licans, they have the audacity to tout 
these benefits as if they supported 
them. But you know what? That is 
okay. That is okay. We are delivering 
for the people regardless. 
And, yes, African Americans and peo-
ple of color were disproportionately 
impacted by the coronavirus, and we 
made certain that equity and funding 
for low-income and vulnerable commu-
nities and low-wealth populations were 
targeted and included. 
Now, last time I looked, Republicans 
also have many constituents who face 
socioeconomic and racial bias and have 
had a difficult time just surviving be-
cause of systemic racism and economic 
inequality. Republicans have constitu-
ents who have faced these adversities; 
we do also. But guess what? Repub-
licans did not step up. We did. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope now that the 
public understands who is on their side. 
You all are making it very clear. I hope 
the public really understands what this 
is about and really who is standing 
with them. 
Mr. Speaker, we must continue to 
build back better and bolder, and I sin-
cerely hope that these efforts will be 
bipartisan. For after all, we were elect-
ed to represent and support our con-
stituents. Not abandon them, mind 
you, in the time of need. 
So, yes, I am proud to have helped 
minority leader, for instance, MCCAR-
THY’s constituents. I am proud to have 
helped Senator MCCONNELL’s constitu-
ents. But I hope that they recognize 
that the benefits that extended to 
them during this unprecedented pan-
demic, I hope they will recognize and 
rethink the importance of working for 
the people. 
Again, I am very proud to have sup-
ported the American Rescue Plan re-
gardless of party affiliation. And I am 
very pleased that we were able to take 
care of our colleagues’ constituents 
when they wouldn’t. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I, again, 
thank the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia, and I certainly could not have 
said it any better, because we were 
proud to take the steps that were nec-
essary to help constituents across the 
country. 
The problems, the challenges that we 
face as a country don’t discriminate on 
political lines or jurisdictional lines. 
We don’t focus on helping Republican 
communities or Democratic commu-
nities. American communities, that is 
who we are here to help; American 
families, the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, Social Security was 
created over 80 years ago. And I was at 
an event earlier today. As we talked 
about the child tax credit, I was joined 
by my colleague, Mr. LIEU. And Sen-
ator BOOKER was so eloquent as he de-
scribed the child tax credit program, in 
particular, as a new Social Security for 
kids, for children. 
b 1915 
So that every child in the United 
States has the opportunity to succeed 
and live the American Dream, that is 
what it is all about. The stories that 
you heard from my colleagues today, 
that is who we are helping. The single 
mother in Broomfield, Colorado, who is 
trying to make ends meet. The work-
ing family in Texas, California, Iowa, 
Nebraska, Seattle, or Florida trying to 
find the resources to pay for childcare, 
to put food on the table, to pay their 
mortgage, that is what the child tax 
credit is all about. 
Mr. Speaker, 200 days, 200 days of 
progress. I am proud of the work. My 
colleague, Mr. LIEU, is proud of the 
work that House Democrats have done 
in partnership with President Biden; 
the work that Representative AXNE has 
done to fight for farmers in Iowa; the 
work that Representative HARDER has 
done to increase appropriations for 
firefighting in the Western United 
States, as we are besieged by wildfires; 
the work that Representative DELGADO 
did to secure local community support 
for the smallest cities, towns, and mu-
nicipalities in rural America. 
Money in pockets, shots in arms, 
children in schools, and people in jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, 200 days, and we are just 
getting started. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

ADDRESSING SOUTHERN BORDER 
CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to address the crisis we have 
on our southern border. 
Last week, I was fortunate enough to 
go with three other Congressmen to see 
the Rio Grande Valley sector, and I 
want to educate the American public, 
as well as my colleagues, as to what I 
saw down there. It is my personal be-
lief that it is the biggest crisis that we 
are facing today. 
First of all, let’s just look at the raw 
numbers. In June, we have had contact 
with 190,000 people at the border. Now, 
a lot of those are turned around. We do 
not know, because the numbers are not 
yet available, how many are let in the 
country, but we believe about 16,000 
children who were unaccompanied by 
an adult are let in; we believe about 
24,000 other family members are let in; 
and we believe about 30,000 people who 
are not touched by the Border Patrol 
and who are sneaking across the line 
are let in. 
So, we believe that more than 70,000 
people, who we did not pick and did not 
vet, were let in America in June, as op-
posed to about 6,000 people last June. 
That is kind of a dramatic change, 6,000 
to 70,000 people. 
Normally, this time of year, by the 
way, those numbers are falling, but 
they went up in June compared to 
May. Why? Normally, it is hot this 
time of year, and people are less likely 
to travel south of the border, but more 
people are coming up here. 
I have been down to the border four 
times this year, and things are dif-
ferent from sector to sector. The Rio 
Grande Valley sector is that which bor-
ders the Gulf of Mexico. I want to point 
out that, there, people are coming from

July 20, 2021 
countries you would expect, primarily 
Honduras, then Guatemala, then Mex-
ico, then El Salvador, although other 
countries like Haiti, Ecuador, or Cuba 
are also in the top 10, a little bit dif-
ferent than other regions where Brazil 
led the way or where Russia was very 
close to the top. 
I want to point out that according to 
the Border Patrol agents I talked to, 
frequently, these people are not nec-
essarily starving or poor, with the ex-
ception of Venezuela and Cuba, where 
they have had to put up with socialist 
Marxist governments. They appear well 
fed. Some of them, particularly from 
Cuba or Europe, are actually, judging 
by their clothes or the purses they 
have, relatively well off. 
I stood on the border in a path be-
tween the Rio Grande River and where 
you check in with the Border Patrol. 
During the 45 minutes I stood there, 
again and again and again clumps of 
people, 15 people, 45 people, 25 people, 
were coming across. They were rather 
jolly, despite the fact that I was stand-
ing next to a Border Patrol agent. That 
did not intimidate them. They knew 
that, under our new laws, they would 
be escorted in. They just smiled, 
waved, and were completely happy. 
They knew that they would wind up 
being looked at, at the border. That is 
why people just kept coming, until 3 
o’clock in the morning, as one of my 
colleagues saw. 
What other comments can I make 
about watching this huge sea of hu-
manity cross the border? It is strength-
ening the cartels. I do not know if I be-
lieve it, but a Border Patrol agent told 
me that he felt the Mexican cartels are 
now making more money escorting 
people across the American border 
than they are from drugs. I can’t docu-
ment that. That is just what I was told. 
If you have to come across the bor-
der, if you come across the Rio Grande, 
people have to realize, you do not get 
to come across unless you deal with 
the drug cartels. They will charge 
someone from Mexico about $3,000; 
from Central America, about $5,000; 
from Brazil—and these are all abouts— 
you negotiate your own price with the 
cartels, maybe $10,000. 
I didn’t see anybody coming from 
China, but our tour guides at the Rio 
Grande Valley said it was not uncom-
mon to get people from China. They 
may be paying up to $20,000. 
You get different trips. When you 
come up from Central America, first of 
all, you are escorted toward a place 
near the border between Mexico and 
Central America. Then, you pay to get 
from a gathering place there to a gath-
ering place just south of the American 
border. Then, you are escorted to the 
Rio Grande River and over the Rio 
Grande River. Maybe for a higher qual-
ity trip, it might cost you $12,000 to get 
a better boat, that sort of thing, as you 
worked your way north. 
You have to pay. We recently heard a 
story from the Border Patrol in which 
somebody from Ecuador refused to pay. 
He felt like he could just come across 
the border. The gangs just killed him 
on the spot, boom. That is the type of 
thing you are dealing with. 
A lot of sexual assaults, so as our 
Border Patrol interviews people, they 
try to do something about it. But, ob-
viously, given the hodgepodge nature 
of the border, I think very rarely are 
they able to catch the assailant. 
To give you a further idea of how dif-
ficult it is, people might say: Why does 
the Border Patrol not intercept the 
boat coming across the Rio Grande? 
Because what the drug cartels will do if 
there is a little child on the boat, and 
there is frequently a little child, they 
will just throw that child in the river, 
knowing full well that the U.S. Border 
Patrol, being compassionate Ameri-
cans, will help that 1-year-old or 3- 
year-old child to safety rather than go 
after the drug cartel or the person 
working for the drug cartel, escorting 
people across the border. I was told 
again today, talking to our Border Pa-
trol, that is very common, that they 
would throw a little child in the river. 
Kind of an interesting thing, if you 
watch these people come across, it is so 
automatic that, nowadays, they get a 
little wristband, like you might get at 
a county fair. That wristband varies 
depending upon the quality of trip you 
are going to get, as well as which gang 
is escorting you across. It is just done 
automatically. 
Like I said, you come to the southern 
border of Mexico. Then, you take a 
plane, train, or bus through Mexico and 
enter another gathering place just 
south of the border. You are escorted 
to the river, and then escorted on a 
boat across. Like I said, depending on 
the quality of the trip, $3,000, or from 
Asia, $20,000—a very difficult thing. 
The next thing we learned down 
there, you might think: What does 
Mexico think about the new policies 
implemented by the United States? Of 
course, the biggest policy is that we 
got rid of the migrant protection pro-
gram, where people who were going to 
ask for asylum had to stay south of the 
border. For whatever reason, the Biden 
administration decided to get rid of 
that. 
Since then, the Border Patrol agents 
I talked to felt they were getting less 
cooperation with Mexico. They are still 
getting cooperation, but it frayed the 
very good cooperation we had with the 
Mexican border patrol 6 months ago be-
cause the attitude of the Mexican bor-
der patrol themselves or the police 
themselves is: Why should I risk my 
life taking on the drug gangs when the 
Americans on the other side don’t real-
ly seem to care about protecting their 
own border? 
The next thing to point out, that I 
didn’t know looking at TV, is it is not 
unusual at all to have people come here 
without their own ID. Without their 
own ID, of course, you have to take 
their word for it, as to who they are. 
You can’t do criminal background 
checks like you want to do. 
Bizarrely, even without an ID, the 
wonderful American taxpayer will fly 
you or bus you wherever you want to 
go in the United States. When I left 
that area, in the McAllen airport, I saw 
people with manila envelopes. On the 
envelope, it says: ‘‘I do not speak 
English,’’ but it gives directions as to 
where you should go. 
As we talked to some of the immi-
grants coming across, they knew where 
they wanted to go. ‘‘I want to go to 
Chicago.’’ ‘‘I want to go to New York.’’ 
‘‘I want to go to Louisiana.’’ So, we du-
tifully put the instructions on the ma-
nila envelope, without ID, and they are 
allowed to get on the airlines without 
ID, something that none of us could do, 
and we take them wherever they want 
to go. 
The next comment I will have is peo-
ple talk about keeping families to-
gether. Under the current system, as 
we open up the border, we see not a 
small number of children all alone in 
what I can only describe as cages. I 
would say they are maybe 20 feet by 20 
feet with maybe eight kids in there all 
under the age of 5, or another fencing 
area with kids who are older than that 
crowded together, maybe 10 to 13. They 
are, obviously, kids. We do let kids in 
who claim to be under 18 who almost 
certainly aren’t. But in any event, it is 
kind of heartbreaking to see these lit-
tle kids under the age of 5 sitting on 
mats, asleep at 10 in the morning with-
out any adults to accompany them, 
without their parents to accompany 
them. 
Now, you might say: What are they 
doing here? Bizarrely, I think, parents 
will send their kids north to live with 
an aunt and uncle or gram or grandpa 
or whatever, and they put the address 
and the name of the people on their T- 
shirts or with something the kids are 
carrying. Then, the kids show the Bor-
der Patrol their T-shirts, and the 
United States sends the kids to a non-
profit organization that takes them to 
New York, Baltimore, or wherever. 
It frustrates the Border Patrol be-
cause, of course, in the United States, 
if we knew parents who just wrote on a 
3-year-old’s shirt ‘‘take Johnny to 123 
Elm Street in Los Angeles, California,’’ 
and dropped him off at the airport, 
those parents would be getting a call 
from social services. 
But here, in dealing with immi-
grants, we don’t consider that unusual 
at all. ‘‘Oh, Johnny, we are supposed to 
find a way to take you from McAllen to 
123 Elm Street in West Bend, Wis-
consin.’’ Why? We have no problem 
doing that. It is just something that 
bothers the Border Patrol and bothers 
me as well. 
The next thing to think about, some-
thing new that the Border Patrol sees, 
and I am a big advocate for those peo-
ple who are born with different abili-
ties, but it is apparent to the Border 
Patrol that, more recently, they are 
getting kids who they wonder if they 
are coming from orphanages, who have 
different abilities than the rest of us—

July 20, 2021 
you could say special needs. We are 
seeing more of that come across the 
border. 
Of course, America is a very wonder-
ful country, and we do take these kids 
in. I am sure we will find special pro-
grams for them. But I think it ought to 
be openly discussed if we are seeing a 
new trend of countries south of the 
border feeling that it is up to the 
United States to care for this popu-
lation. 
b 1930 
I am going to comment a little bit on 
the people they call got-aways. Obvi-
ously, if you have so many young kids 
who are being processed here, Mr. 
Speaker, the Border Patrol has to 
spend a lot of time filling out paper-
work and interviewing these folks. 
What happens when the Border Pa-
trol is filling out paperwork and chang-
ing diapers? They don’t have time to 
guard the border. 
As a result, we have heard in certain 
sectors the Border Patrol is at one half 
the number of people they want on the 
border, which is why this time last 
year they had about 6,000 got-aways 
sneaking in every month, and now 
there are 30,000 got-aways sneaking in 
every month. 
A discussion of what I learned at the 
border is incomplete without talking 
about the drugs that are coming across 
the border. Ever since I have had this 
job, we have talked about the number 
of people who are dying in this country 
by illegal drug overdoses. I think after 
a while people’s eyes tend to glaze 
over, and they may not be aware that 
in the last 6 or 7 years the number of 
people dying in this country has dou-
bled. 
When I first got this job, it was about 
45,000 a year, and I was just stunned at 
45,000. It is not that far away from the 
number of people who died fighting in 
Vietnam, and every year that many 
people die of drug overdoses in this 
country. It has doubled. It is now up to 
90,000 a year. 
When I talked to the local DEA agent 
in Milwaukee, he told me that he felt 
the drugs from all of the overdoses in 
Milwaukee County—which at the time 
was 540 a year—probably came across 
the southern border. Just like every 
other member of law enforcement in 
Wisconsin, they wonder what we are 
doing in Washington to prevent these 
drugs from coming across the southern 
border. 
Why is there such a big increase? 
I think two things: First of all, more 
drugs are coming across the border. As 
marijuana becomes legalized in more 
and more States and grown legally in 
more States, there is a speculation 
that the drug gangs who, after all, 
make money selling drugs, are shifting 
from marijuana to harder drugs. 
Secondly, the current drug of choice, 
the drug that is being used by these 
horrible cartels—and by the way, we 
ought to put more of these people in 
prison, not less—the type of drugs that 
are being brought across by these car-
tels is fentanyl. 
I had always thought that heroin was 
about the most dangerous thing you 
could take, Mr. Speaker. Fentanyl is 
much more dangerous than heroin, 
which is why I recently talked to a dis-
trict attorney in my district, and in his 
area there were as many people who 
died from drug overdoses last year as 
the 3 prior years combined. It is what 
we see as the young people shift or 
older people shift from heroin to 
fentanyl on purpose or not on purpose, 
because frequently the fentanyl is put 
in with the heroin. 
So if we care about the 90,000 people 
who are dying every year in this coun-
try of illegal overdoses and we think 
about the poor families who lose their 
loved ones and wonder what we are 
going to do, it seems that a minimum 
part of the response has to be to re-
spond at the border. 
One more time, it seems like we are 
going in the opposite direction. We are 
doing less at the border. More people 
are coming across, and more people 
coming across means more fentanyl; 
more fentanyl coming across means 
more fentanyl-laced heroin; and more 
fentanyl-laced heroin means more peo-
ple dying and more broken hearts of 
the families of the people who are 
dying. 
So what can I recommend to the 
wonderful Congressman in the Chair? 
First of all, I will ask the Biden ad-
ministration not to get rid of title 42. 
That is the section that allows the Bor-
der Patrol to turn people around be-
cause of fear of COVID. There are ru-
mors that the use of title 42 is soon 
going to be dropped by the Biden ad-
ministration. Perhaps the uptick in 
COVID will cause them not to do it. 
But as I said, already we have 70,000 
people a month crossing the border, 
and if the word gets out that we are no 
longer going to turn away single adults 
or families with kids over the age of 7 
who are right now being turned around 
because of COVID, that 70,000-a-month 
figure is going to shoot up even more. 
Secondly, with regard to COVID 
right now, the Border Patrol checks 
people, but they only check people if 
they have a temperature of at least 99; 
otherwise, they just send them on— 
which includes a lot of asymptomatic 
people—to the nongovernmental orga-
nizations who take these people next. 
If they test positive there, then these 
organizations put them up in hotels or 
apartments. 
But because they are here illegally 
and they want to get inland to Amer-
ica, what do the people with COVID do 
once they are placed in a hotel or 
placed in an apartment? 
They leave right away. So, right now, 
as a practical matter the policy of the 
Biden administration of people who 
come here—I am not talking about 
unvaccinated people, I am talking 
about 
people 
who 
literally 
have 
COVID—the response of this country is 
we let them in. I would beg the Biden 
administration to do something about 
that concern. 
So keep or expand title 42 so people 
can’t get here because of COVID. And, 
secondly, when people test positive for 
COVID, don’t let them out. That is 
kind of opposite of the whole story we 
are getting from the President. 
The third thing I would like to ask 
the President to do—and I made this 
request, I think it was 3 weeks ago 
now—please put someone other than 
Vice President HARRIS in charge of the 
border. She went down to the El Paso 
sector. She did a few-hour perfunctory 
check. 
I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, I learn so 
much more every time I am down 
there, and usually I stay down there a 
couple days each. Every sector of the 
southern border is different, and there 
are nine sectors there. I happened to be 
in the Rio Grande sector this time. It 
is very different from what you learn 
in the Tucson sector, Mr. Speaker, and 
very different from what you learn in 
the San Diego sector. 
Please, President Biden, pick some-
one who either has a zeal to control the 
southern border or at least is person-
ally responsible enough to go down 
there and do something. Because I will 
tell you, Mr. Speaker, that 70,000 figure 
now up from 6,000 a year ago is going to 
do nothing but grow; and if you ever 
get rid of title 42, it is going to rocket 
up through the roof. I don’t think there 
is any country—particularly a country 
with a generous welfare state like we 
have—who can survive purely open bor-
ders. 
So there is your primer, Mr. Speaker, 
for all the people fortunate enough to 
be in the room and fortunate to be lis-
tening at all. 
I beg President Biden to take the 
border more seriously, and I beg the 
media of this country to take the bor-
der more seriously. I do not think any-
thing that the government does or does 
not do is more significant than what 
happens with the 70,000 people who are 
coming across the border today, and 
what I believe will happen as soon as 
the weather gets a little cooler and it 
becomes 
more 
apparent 
to 
people 
around the world, soon that number is 
going to go from 70 to 80 to 90 to 100 
and maybe significantly more than 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the 
time, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.

from Maryland (Mr. SARBANES) who 
will start with a discussion on a long-
standing and well-known historic vio-
lations of human rights. 
Mr. 
SARBANES. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the Congresswoman for yielding. 
I appreciate it very much. 
I want to speak today about the 47th 
anniversary of the Turkish invasion 
and occupation of the tiny island of Cy-
prus. For the last 47 years, Turkish 
troops have occupied the north of that 
island which is a direct violation of 
human rights. They have taken that 
opportunity to engage in disruption 
and desecration of cultural and reli-
gious sites. 
Today, President Erdogan of Turkey 
visited Cyprus on this day, the 47th an-
niversary of the Turkish occupation. 
Why did he come? 
Was it to negotiate in good faith for 
a solution to the division of the island? 
No. 
Did he come to apologize for the con-
tinued occupation of the island? 
No. 
He came to announce the reopening 
of the beach town of Varosha in direct 
contravention of the United Nations 
Security Council Resolution 550 which 
‘‘considers attempts to settle any part 
of Varosha by people other than its in-
habitants as inadmissible.’’ 
Varosha was a once-bustling resort 
town. It was an international tourist 
destination in the Famagusta district 
of the Republic of Cyprus. But with the 
advance of Turkey’s invading forces to 
the town in August of 1974, Varosha’s 
native Greek Cypriot population fled 
for their lives. 
Erdogan’s visit is a cynical and 
shameful act designed to mock the 
rightful inhabitants of Varosha and to 
advance Turkey’s agenda of dividing 
Cypress into two separate states in-
stead 
of 
pursuing 
a 
bizonal, 
bicommunal federation that all parties 
of good faith have endorsed. 
I urge the Biden administration to 
use all means at its disposal to resist 
Turkey’s creeping partition of Cyprus 
and to bring international condemna-
tion to these outrageous steps that 
President Erdogan is taking which dis-
respect and violate the rights and 
human dignity of the refugees of 
Varosha. 
One day Cyprus will be reunited, but 
that can only come with the forceful 
leadership of the American Govern-
ment, deployed consistently, morally, 
and with an abiding sense of justice. 
I want to thank the Congresswoman 
for yielding to me so I could address an 
important issue of human rights, and I 
want to thank her for her incredible 
work over decades and certainly during 
her service here in Congress to make 
sure that in this country we are recog-
nizing human rights and the dignity of 
every individual. I want to thank her 
for her leadership on H.R. 40, this very, 
very important commission, and thank 
her for being part of the conscience of 
this Congress. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his leadership. 
We must always remember that human 
rights are equal to human dignity. 
So it is my privilege tonight to stand 
to discuss the value of recognizing 
human dignity. As I do so, let me add 
to an earlier discussion that reflects on 
giving our children human dignity. 
Isn’t it amazing how children have 
suffered in the course of the most re-
cent history depredation of wealth, and 
so they have been ensconced in pov-
erty, they have been hungry, and they 
have been without a good education? 
These are children in America. We can 
speak about children around the world. 
They 
have 
had 
little 
access 
to 
broadband technology, and they have 
suffered in their housing provisions, if 
you will. 
So I am very proud to just start out 
by, again, applauding the American 
Rescue Act and also the life-changing 
impact of the child tax credit. I don’t 
think we can do that enough. And chil-
dren of color have been at the front of 
the line and we are able to help with 
food and childcare, diapers, healthcare, 
clothing, taxes. 
Poor, working, and middle class fam-
ilies are able to receive the same 
amount. You will see, Mr. Speaker, 
where I am going on this because we 
don’t do this in anger. We don’t do this 
because we are mad. We do this because 
it is righting the wrong, as one of my 
colleagues said. 
This will provide $250 per month, per 
child and $300 per month for every 
young child. That means children 
under 5. All families in my district will 
be able to feel more secure. Let me run 
through these numbers because they 
are stunning. 
The 18th Congressional District in 
Houston, Texas, Mr. Speaker, 91.7 per-
cent of children in my district will gain 
from the expanded and improved child 
tax credit. I know that because I have 
been immersed in childcare education 
events. 
We have been in a church, we have 
been at my Federal building, we have 
been up and down on the radio, we have 
been everywhere we could be to ensure 
that we did it with humor, with seri-
ousness, with compassion, being out on 
the street corners along with trying to 
encourage people to get vaccinated. We 
have been saying: Get ready for the 
child tax credit President Biden and 
the Democratic Congress worked so 
hard on. 
Mr. Speaker, 91.7 percent of the chil-
dren will gain in my district. That is 
202,800 children. 
I have schools in my district that are 
100 percent at risk, and they eat break-
fast, lunch, and dinner. There is no 
shame to helping children. Behind 
those children are parents who are suf-
fering. These dollars will help these 
parents have dignity, their children 
have dignity, and their children have 
resources. 
The average benefit for 56,700 house-
holds in my district—Houston, I hope 
you are listening—is $3,500. 
If you have not filed your taxes in 
the 2019 year, you can immediately get 
help from my office at 713–655–0050 or 
the IRS tax advocacy team, also in my 
building of 1919 Smith Street in Hous-
ton, Texas. 
Don’t miss the opportunity for your 
own human dignity. It is not a hand-
out. It is a hand up. The expanded and 
improved child tax credit lifts 21,800 
children in my district out of poverty. 
Because of the larger benefits for the 
youngest, 8,400 kids under the age of 6 
are raised out of poverty. That has ex-
panded across America where millions 
of children face a new day. 
b 1945 
Families with children in poverty re-
ceive $5,300 on average, and they are 
getting some 6,500 children in my dis-
trict out of deep poverty. We know now 
that we are engaged in the appropria-
tions process. I thank Chairwoman 
DELAURO and all of the appropriators 
for their work. We know how impor-
tant it is if you are going to do some-
thing in life, this year, 2021, in the 
aftermath of COVID–19, this is the year 
to do it with the appropriations bill. 
This is the year to do it. Again, my 
theme: a sense of dignity. 
And where does that take me now? 
Well, I must deviate for a moment, Mr. 
Speaker, to just indicate that I think 
the Biden-Harris team has brought to 
America a sense of compassion. It has 
turned anger and ugly words into 
reaching out to people where they are. 
That could mean people who oppose 
them. But they reach out to them 
where they are, and they reach them 
with a sense of understanding and ac-
ceptance that they must cast leader-
ship for all of America, even if people 
disagree with them. 
So my good friend was here on the 
floor—I am sorry that he has left—but 
I want to emphasize that Vice Presi-
dent KAMALA HARRIS is doing an excel-
lent job on some very tough issues. She 
is meeting on voting rights and meet-
ing with any number of persons. I want 
to remind America that Texas Demo-
cratic State representatives who had 
some medical mishaps here or medical 
circumstances with COVID–19—no one 
is immune—are still here fighting so 
that we can have voting rights. 
She has met with all of them. She is 
deeply engaged in making sure that we 
work together as a Congress to get vot-
ing rights done along with the Congres-
sional 
Black 
Caucus 
Chairwoman 
BEATTY and all of us as Members who 
are standing ready. So she is doing an 
excellent job. And I will tell you, living 
on the border myself, living in Texas, 
in the region, having gone to the bor-
der over and over again, she is doing a 
job that should be done that others are 
not doing, getting into the weeds and 
understanding what the President’s

path should be as we go forward on im-
migration reform. 
She has been to the Northern Tri-
angle. That is the heart of where the 
issues start, and they are working to 
discern how they can best stop the 
massive flow of migrants, immigrants, 
who are in fear of their lives living in 
the countries that they are living in. 
These are tough issues, and I just want 
to say thank you to Vice President 
KAMALA HARRIS, because some people 
misunderstand and think that it is just 
an easy thing to do. 
My word from Texas on her trip was 
excellent, and that people were recep-
tive to her intellect, her compassion, 
and her willingness to get the job done. 
And the job will be done. 
So as I say that, I indicated this will 
be a night about human rights. And so 
I want to give you a little education 
about legislation that we are so pleased 
about. Can you imagine, H.R. 40, the 
Commission to Study and Develop Rep-
aration Proposals for African-Ameri-
cans having nearly 200 sponsors, co-
sponsors of individuals who have come 
from many parts of the country. And so 
I am speaking to my colleagues who 
happen to be Republicans, and I want 
to give them the opportunity to realize 
just what this bill is. 
I heard someone say ‘‘restoration,’’ 
and I heard someone say ‘‘repair,’’ and 
they are right. My good friend, the 
Honorable BARBARA LEE, we are work-
ing in tandem together, working in 
tandem on H. Res. 19, which is rec-
onciliation and restoration, and then 
the bill, H.R. 40, legislation to create a 
commission that would study effec-
tively slavery, and as well then develop 
reparation proposals. Again, restora-
tion, repair. 
Let us remove ourselves from any 
sort of shackle on the question of rep-
arations. Let us be understanding of 
someone else’s pain, someone else’s 
history; that is, in fact, American his-
tory. So I hold up this bill, because I 
said I would do show and tell, H.R. 40. 
Look at the pile of Members here as 
original cosponsors, and they have 
been coming on and on, and I want to 
just say thank you to my friends and 
colleagues who have thoughtfully felt 
the need to say how do we heal Amer-
ica’s systemic racism; and how do we 
heal institutional racism; how do we 
ignore what is, in fact, truth. 
Now, I think most of you know I 
could not stand here without saying 
thank you to the 415 Members of Con-
gress who voted along with the United 
States Senate on Juneteenth. Do you 
realize that Juneteenth is the first 
time America has acknowledged the 
history of slavery? In 1865, those of us 
west of the Mississippi just got the 
word from the Union soldiers with Gen-
eral Granger that we were free by Gen-
eral Order No. 3. 
Juneteenth is a commemoration of 
that. And I want everyone to know 
that, frankly, 47 States have already 
been celebrating in their own way 
Juneteenth. After 38 years, we have a 
new Federal holiday called Juneteenth, 
which gives America and little school-
children the opportunity to ask their 
dad 
or 
their 
teacher: 
What 
is 
Juneteenth? That was holding people 
in bondage, but it was setting them 
free. 
After the bloodiest war, brothers 
against brothers, the Civil War, where 
Abraham Lincoln so emotionally indi-
cated: ‘‘A house divided cannot stand,’’ 
but General Granger came and Sam 
Collins held a magnificent celebration 
on June 19 in Houston, in Galveston, in 
that region where I represent, and the 
mural was unveiled by a magnificent 
artistic team led by Reginald Adams 
out of Third Ward, Texas, which is 
Houston, which is where my congres-
sional district is, and it told the story 
of the freedom of these slaves. And we 
repeated General Order No. 3 which 
says, ‘‘equality of personal rights’’ but 
the biggest thing it said was, ‘‘the 
slaves are free.’’ And that we insist 
upon equality of rights. That is all that 
H.R. 40 is about. 
Are we to deny equality of rights? 
That was in General Order No. 3. That 
is what the President, unfortunately, 
being assassinated, President Abraham 
Lincoln sent General Granger down to 
read to the slaves who had worked and 
been beaten for 21⁄2 more years. 
It is important that we not ignore 
what slavery was all about. This is the 
whelped and beaten back and scarred 
back of a slave. Let us be clear. Bond-
age, we are the only group of Ameri-
cans that have been held in bondage in 
this Nation, and we have been held or 
were held in bondage longer than this 
country has been a nation. For 246 
years, we were held in bondage, and we 
only celebrated our 245th birthday. 
So I am here to be able to, very brief-
ly, run you through a brief history. Let 
me do this. Let me first of all talk 
about the words of Gary Abernathy, 
who proudly says that he is a conserv-
ative. 
And Mr. Speaker, how much time do 
I have remaining, please? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 14 minutes remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate it, only to make sure that I 
can now flow with the concept of the 
time. 
But the headline reads: ‘‘Why I sup-
port reparations—and all conservatives 
should.’’ 
I know my friends are listening here 
on the other side. Gary Abernathy. And 
I will take some excerpts from this. He 
acknowledges that he is a conservative. 
And I can venture to say that his cre-
dentials can be documented. 
But he says, in spite of the bill that 
I have offered—has an apology—he 
takes note of that, he even indicates 
that he may not be that enthusiastic 
about that. But he says, ‘‘In fact, it 
could be argued that the idea fits with-
in the conservative philosophy,’’ mean-
ing that the notion of reparations is 
worth discussing because he says, ‘‘In 
fact, it could be argued that the idea 
fits the conservative philosophy.’’ 
He goes on to say, ‘‘But it is undeni-
able that White people have dispropor-
tionately benefited from both the labor 
and the legacy of slavery, and—cru-
cially—will continue to do so for gen-
erations to come.’’ 
None of this is said with anger. It is 
only setting forth facts. When slavery 
was abolished after a bloody Civil War, 
African Americans were dispersed into 
a world that was overtly hostile to 
them. ‘‘Reconstruction efforts were 
bitterly resisted by most Southern 
Whites, and attempts to educate and 
employ former slaves happened only in 
fits and starts.’’ 
Remember, this is a group of people 
in the millions who simply were set 
free. Freedom is precious. We cannot 
deny how precious freedom was, how 
sweet it was, but they were given noth-
ing; nothing to start their lives, and 
they came into the hostility of people 
who really didn’t want them to be free. 
That was the bulk of the South, and 
many parts of the North. ‘‘The govern-
ment even reneged on its ‘40 acres and 
a mule’ pledge. After slavery, prejudice 
and indifference continued to fuel so-
cial and economic disparity.’’ 
Be reminded of the whipped back of 
this Black man, this slave. And there 
were whipped backs of women and chil-
dren. They lived through this through 
no fault of their own. They worked and 
toiled in the fields. They made cotton 
king. They built the economic engine 
of this Nation. They created a trans-
atlantic slave trade. They sent millions 
of dollars from the South to the Wall 
Street banks, and we built America. 
They built this place where I stand, 
the United States Capitol, with their 
bare hands, and they built the White 
House. What else could they have 
built? 
And so when slavery was abolished, 
there was silence. It has been rep-
resented that there is a gap of $17,600 
shows the median Black household net 
worth, to a $174,000 wage of the average 
American or White family. 
When parents offered gifts to help 
children buy a home, avoid student 
debt, or start a business, those children 
are more able to retain and build on 
their wealth over their lifetimes. I 
think we just saw a very unique occa-
sion today regarding space. I would not 
in any way say anything but congratu-
lations, but one of those persons paid 
$27 million to be on that historic mo-
ment. Calculate that. It is a personal 
payment. It wasn’t government. 
And, again, I celebrate the occasion, 
but juxtapose that against where we 
are or where African Americans are. 
Randall Robinson made the point that 
even affirmative action would never 
close the economic gap. ‘‘Blacks, even 
middle-class Blacks, have no paper as-
sets to speak of. They may be salaried, 
but they’re only a few months away 
from poverty if they should lose those 
jobs . . . ’’ 
And many times the ravages of dis-
crimination and segregation are inter-
twined in law, and they may lose their 
jobs.

And so this conservative author be-
lieves in reparations. And he believes 
that this can be done with a fair 
amount of dollars, but there is more to 
it, as you will hear me say, because it 
is not about money. 
He concludes by saying: ‘‘It is a tenet 
of conservatism that a level playing 
field is all we should guarantee. But 
that’s meaningless if one team starts 
with an unsurmountable lead before 
play even begins.’’ 
I think LBJ said: If you want to tell 
people about a fair race, meaning a 
running race, and one fellow or lady 
has shackles around their ankles and 
the whistle blows, get ready, go, it is 
not a fair race because one runner is 
freed and has all of the elements of 
freedom, and the ability to do great 
things, and one is running with leg 
irons on. 
So as we look at how we can as a na-
tion, a community come together, I 
don’t know how many times I want to 
raise the question that we are not 
doing this in anger. H.R. 40, first intro-
duced by John Conyers, is an inter-
national concept. It just means repair. 
It means doing the right thing, heal-
ing, dealing with injustices. It will not 
be painful. 
But let me tell you why this legisla-
tion is not painful, because it is a 
study that will give us a roadmap and 
it will be done with academicians and 
those who are appointed by govern-
ment leaders, and they will be balanced 
and they will be responsible and they 
will be thorough. 
b 2000 
Why do we think we need it? 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the 
article 
from 
Gary 
Abernathy, 
Washington 
Post 
contributing 
col-
umnist. 
[From the Washington Post, Apr. 22, 2021] 
OPINION: WHY I SUPPORT REPARATIONS—AND 
ALL CONSERVATIVES SHOULD 
(By Gary Abernathy, Contributing 
columnist) 
Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D–Wash.) is among 
the progressive lawmakers whose blunt, lib-
eral outspokenness regularly annoys me. Re-
cently, she particularly upset me while dis-
cussing the latest congressional study of rep-
arations for descendants of enslaved people, 
when she said, ‘‘If you through your history 
benefited from that wrong that was done, 
then you must be willing to commit yourself 
to righting that wrong.’’ Only this time I 
was bothered because her comments hit 
home. Like most conservatives, I’ve scoffed 
at the idea of reparations or a formal apol-
ogy for slavery. I did not own slaves, so why 
would I support my government using my 
tax dollars for reparations or issuing an 
apology? Further, no one in the United 
States has been legally enslaved since 1865, 
so why are Black people today owed any-
thing more than the same freedoms and op-
portunities that I enjoy? 
I remain unconvinced that an apology 
would have much real value, but the more 
substantive notion of reparations is worth 
discussing. In fact, it could be argued that 
the idea fits within the conservative philos-
ophy. We’ll come back to that. But it is un-
deniable that White people have dispropor-
tionately benefitted from both the labor and 
the legacy of slavery, and—crucially—will 
continue to do so for generations to come. 
When slavery was abolished after a bloody 
civil war, African Americans were dispersed 
into a world that was overtly hostile to 
them. Reconstruction efforts were bitterly 
resisted by most Southern Whites, and at-
tempts to educate and employ former slaves 
happened only in fits and starts. The govern-
ment even reneged on its ‘‘40 acres and a 
mule’’ pledge. After slavery, prejudice and 
indifference continued to fuel social and eco-
nomic disparity. 
The result is unsurprising. As noted by 
scholars A. Kirsten Mullen and William A. 
Darity Jr., co-authors of ‘‘From Here to 
Equality: Reparations for Black Americans 
in the Twenty-First Century,’’ data from the 
2016 Survey of Consumer Finances showed 
that median Black household net worth 
averaged $17,600—a little more than one- 
tenth of median White net worth. As Mullen 
and Darity write, ‘‘white parents, on aver-
age, can provide their children with wealth- 
related intergenerational advantages to a far 
greater degree than black parents. When par-
ents offer gifts to help children buy a home, 
avoid student debt, or start a business, those 
children are more able to retain and build on 
their wealth over their own lifetimes.’’ 
Black author and activist Randall Robin-
son has argued that even laws such as those 
on affirmative action ‘‘will never close the 
economic gap. This gap is structural. . . . 
blacks, even middle-class blacks, have no 
paper assets to speak of. They may be sala-
ried, but they’re only a few months away 
from poverty if they should lose those jobs, 
because . . . they’ve had nothing to hand 
down from generation to generation because 
of the ravages of discrimination and segrega-
tion, which were based in law until re-
cently.’’ 
In addition to the discrepancy in inherited 
wealth, even conservatives should be able to 
acknowledge that Whites enjoy generational 
associations in the business world, where 
who you know often counts more than what 
you know—a reality based not so much on 
overt racism as on employment and pro-
motion patterns within old-school networks 
that Blacks lack the traditional contacts to 
consistently intersect. 
For now, support for reparations is anemic. 
A House Judiciary Committee bill creating a 
commission to merely study the idea was op-
posed last week by 17 Republicans, though 
all 25 Democrats on the committee voted for 
it; and just 1 in 5 respondents in a Reuters/ 
Ipsos poll last June agreed that the United 
States should use tax dollars for repara-
tions—not shocking, when a price tag of $10 
trillion has been suggested. 
The cost can be debated, along with the 
mechanics of a compensation package. But 
in the current drunken haze of government 
spending, appropriating trillions for the 
noble purpose of bringing Black Americans 
who remain economically penalized by the 
enslavement of their ancestors closer to the 
fiscal universe of White citizens surely seems 
less objectionable than some recent spending 
proposals. 
It is a tenent of conservatism that a level 
playing field is all we should guarantee. But 
that’s meaningless if one team starts with 
an unsurmountable lead before play even be-
gins. 
It’s not necessary to experience ‘‘White 
guilt’’ or buy into the notion of ‘‘White 
privilege,’’ a pejorative that to me suggests 
Whites possess something they should lose, 
when in fact such benefits should extend to 
all. Supporting reparations simply requires a 
universal agreement to work toward, as 
Jayapal said, ‘‘righting that wrong.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD a Washington 
Post article, ‘‘U.N. rights chief: Rep-
arations needed for people facing rac-
ism.’’ 
[From the Washington Post, June 28, 2021] 
UN RIGHTS CHIEF: REPARATIONS NEEDED FOR 
PEOPLE FACING RACISM 
(By Jamey Keaten) 
GENEVA
(AP)—The U.N. human rights 
chief, in a landmark report launched after 
the killing of George Floyd in the United 
States, is urging countries worldwide to do 
more to help end discrimination, violence 
and ) systemic racism against people of Afri-
can descent and ‘‘make amends’’ to them— 
including through reparations. 
The report from Michelle Bachelet, the 
U.N. High Commissioner for Human rights, 
offers a sweeping look at the roots of cen-
turies of mistreatment faced by Africans and 
people of African descent, notably from the 
transatlantic slave trade. It seeks a ‘‘trans-
formative’’ approach to address its continued 
impact today. 
The report, a year in the making, hopes to 
build on momentum around the recent, in-
tensified scrutiny worldwide about the blight 
of racism and its impact on people of African 
descent as epitomized by the high-profile 
killings of unarmed Black people in the 
United States and elsewhere. 
‘‘There is today a momentous opportunity 
to achieve a turning point for racial equality 
and justice,’’ the report said. 
The report aims to speed up action by 
countries to end racial injustice; end impu-
nity for rights violations by police; ensure 
that people of African descent and those who 
speak out against racism are heard; and face 
up to past wrongs through accountability 
and redress. 
I am calling on all states to stop denying— 
and start dismantling—racism; to end impu-
nity and build trust; to listen to the voices 
of people of African descent; and to confront 
past legacies and deliver redress,’’ Bachelet 
said in a video statement. 
While broaching the issue of reparation in 
her most explicit way yet, Bachelet sug-
gested that monetary compensation alone is 
not enough and would be part of an array of 
measures to help rectify or make up for the 
injustices. 
‘‘Reparations should not only be equated 
with financial compensation,’’ she wrote, 
adding that it should include restitution, re-
habilitation, acknowledgement of injustices, 
apologies, memorialization, educational re-
forms and ‘‘guarantees’’ that such injustices 
won’t happen again. 
Bachelet, a former president of Chile, 
hailed the efforts of advocacy groups like the 
Black Lives Matter movement, saying they 
helped 
provide 
‘‘grassroots 
leadership 
through listening to communities’’ and that 
they should receive ‘‘funding, public recogni-
tion and support.’’ 
The U.N.-backed Human Rights Council 
commissioned the report during a special 
session last year following the murder of 
Floyd, a Black American who was killed by 
a white police officer in Minneapolis in May 
2020. The officer, Derek Chauvin, was sen-

Protests erupted after excruciating by-

The report was based on discussions with 
over 340 people—mostly of African descent— 
and experts; more than 100 contributions in

rarely held accountable for rights violations 
and crimes against people of African descent, 
and it noted similar patterns of mistreat-
ment by police across many countries. 
The report ultimately aims to transform 
those opportunities into a more systemic re-
sponse by governments to address racism, 
and not just in the United States—although 
the injustices and legacy of slavery, racism 
and violence faced by African Americans was 
clearly a major theme. 
The report also laid out cases, concerns 
and the situation in roughly 60 countries in-
cluding Belgium, Brazil, Britain, Canada, Co-
lombia and France among others. 
‘‘We could not find a single example of a 
state that has fully reckoned with the past 
or comprehensively accounted for the im-
pacts of the lives of people of African descent 
today,’’ Mona Rishmawi, who heads a unit on 
non-discrimination in Bachelet’s office. ‘‘Our 
message, therefore, is that this situation is 
untenable.’’ 
Compensation should be considered at the 
‘‘collective 
and 
the 
individual 
level,’’ 
Rishmawi said, while adding that any such 
process ‘‘starts with acknowledgment’’ of 
past wrongs and ‘‘it’s not one-size-fits-all.’’ 
She said countries must look at their own 
pasts and practices to assess how to proceed. 
Rishmawi said Bachelet’s team found ‘‘a 
main part of the problem is that many peo-
ple believe the misconceptions that the abo-
lition of slavery, the end of the transatlantic 
trade and colonialism have removed the ra-
cially discriminatory structures built by 
those practices. 
‘‘We found that this is not true,’’ said 
Rishmawi, also denouncing an idea among 
some ‘‘associating blackness with crimi-
nality . . . there is a need to address this.’’ 
The report called on countries to ‘‘make 
amends for centuries of violence and, dis-
crimination’’ such as through ‘‘formal ac-
knowledgment and apologies, truth-telling 
processes and reparations in various forms.’’ 
It also decried the ‘‘dehumanization of peo-
ple of African descent’’ that was ‘‘rooted in 
false social constructions of race’’ in the 
past to justify enslavement, racial stereo-
types and harmful practices as well as toler-
ance for racial discrimination, inequality 
and violence. 
People of African descent face inequalities 
and ‘‘stark socioeconomic 
and 
political 
marginalization’’ in many countries, the re-
port said, including unfair access to edu-
cation, health care, jobs, housing and clean 
water. 
‘‘We believe very strongly that we only 
touched the tip of the iceberg,’’ Rishmawi 
said, referring to the report. ‘‘We really be-
lieve that there is a lot more work that 
needs to be done.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. This report came 
from the United Nations because rep-
arations is a universal concept of re-
pair, repairing, and human rights. This 
report from the U.N. High Commis-
sioner for Human Rights is big stuff. It 
‘‘offers a sweeping look at the roots of 
centuries of mistreatment faced by Af-
ricans and people of African descent, 
notably from the transatlantic slave 
trade.’’ 
Does that sound familiar? Back and 
forth across the ocean. 
‘‘It seeks a ‘transformative’ approach 
to 
address 
its 
continued 
impact 
today.’’ 
In its report, it says: ‘‘I am calling on 
all states to stop denying, and start 
dismantling, racism; to end impunity 
and build trust; to listen to the voices 
of people of African descent; and to 
confront past legacies and deliver re-
dress.’’ 
This is what this report from the 
United Nations has said. 
It goes on to say: ‘‘Reparations 
should not only be equated with finan-
cial compensation.’’ 
This is what I have been saying. I say 
that when I go on the floor and ask for 
my colleagues to support it. Thank 
goodness we understand it. We get it. I 
am looking for my Republican friends 
to join us. 
‘‘Adding that it should include res-
titution, rehabilitation, acknowledg-
ment of injustices, apologies, memori-
alization, education reforms, and ‘guar-
antees’ that such injustices won’t hap-
pen again.’’ 
Does that sound unfair? 
‘‘We could not find a single example 
of a state that has fully reckoned with 
the past or comprehensively accounted 
for the impacts on the lives of people of 
African descent.’’ 
This individual, who was head of the 
unit on nondiscrimination, said: ‘‘Our 
message, therefore, is that this situa-
tion is untenable.’’ 
This is the report from the U.N. 
‘‘A main part of the problem is that 
many people believe the misconcep-
tions that the abolition of slavery, the 
end of the transatlantic trade, and co-
lonialism have removed the racially 
discriminatory 
structures 
built 
by 
those practices.’’ 
Absolutely wrong. The report found 
that this is not true, ‘‘also denouncing 
an idea among some ‘associating black-
ness with criminality.’’’ That has gone 
on in many places around the world, 
including the United States. 
This report also ‘‘decried the ‘dehu-
manization of people of African de-
scent’ that was ‘rooted in false social 
constructions of race’ in the past to 
justify 
enslavement, 
racial 
stereo-
types, and harmful practices as well as 
tolerance for racial discrimination, in-
equality, and violence.’’ 
Do we realize that that hurts all of 
our children? Children who are White 
and non-White are hurt by the defini-
tions of color and Africans and people 
of African descent. 
We face inequalities, meaning those 
of African descent, and ‘‘’stark socio-
economic 
and 
political 
marginalization’ in many countries, 
the report said, including unfair access 
to education, healthcare, jobs, housing, 
and clean water.’’ 
What the commission could do is to 
give peace and understanding of the 
very fact of what would be a positive 
response to this question of discrimina-
tion. 
I want to add some real scientific 
evidence that I am not here on the 
floor complaining. I am giving an op-
portunity, along with the infrastruc-
ture bill, along with the budget rec-
onciliation, because I am on the Budg-
et 
Committee, 
along 
with 
voting 
rights, after 30-some years when this 
bill was first introduced in 1989, after 
the Japanese received reparations in 
1988, of which we supported. 
Thank you to the Japanese American 
Association. 
They 
are 
strong 
sup-
porters of H.R. 40. They got reparations 
for their false and unfair internment in 
the 1940s during World War II. We cele-
brated it. We worked with them and 
helped them construct that, those who 
were in Congress at that time. 
John Conyers filed this bill shortly 
after 1989, and I am honored to have 
been given this challenge and oppor-
tunity by him upon his retirement. I 
will not let the Nation down. I say the 
Nation because a definitive study is 
worthy. It I might show you that the 
idea of reparations is to suggest a con-
tinued, systemic impact, a continued, 
systemic impact that is going on, even 
in this moment. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
this article that is part of the Harvard 
Medical School’s continuing coverage

it.

ANTI-RACIST EPIDEMIOLOGY—RESEARCH SUG-
GESTS REPARATIONS
FOR SLAVERY COULD 
HAVE REDUCED COVID–19 INFECTIONS
AND 
DEATHS IN U.S. 
(By Jake Miller) 
This article is part of Harvard Medical 
School’s continuing coverage of medicine, 
biomedical research, medical education and 
policy related to the SARS-Co V–2 pandemic 
and the disease COVID–19. 
Civil rights activists have long called for 
monetary reparations to the Black descend-
ants of Africans enslaved in the United 
States as a financial, moral, and ethical 
form of restitution for the injustices of slav-
ery. 
Now, a study led by Harvard Medical 
School 
researchers 
suggests 
reparations 
could also have surprising public health ben-
efits for Black individuals and the entire na-
tion. 
To estimate the impact of structura in-
equities between Black and white individ-
uals, the researchers set out to capture the 
effect of reparation payments on the Black- 
white wealth gap in the state of Louisiana. 
Their analysis, published online on Feb. 9 
in Social Science & Medicine. suggests that 
if reparations had teen made before the 
COVID–19 pandemic, transmission of SARS– 
CoV–2 in the state’s overall population could 
have been reduced by anywhere from 31 per-
cent to 68 percent. 
The work was done in collaboration with 
the Lancet Commission on Reparations and 
Redistributive Justice. 
‘‘While there are compelling moral and his-
torical arguments for racial-injustice inter-
ventions such as reparations, our study dem-
onstrates that repairing the damage caused 
by the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow rac-
ism would have enormous benefits to the en-
tire population of tbe United States,’’ said 
study senior author Eugene Richardson. as-
sistant professor of global health and social 
medicine in the Blavatnik Institute at Har-
vard Medical School. 
The disproportionate effects of COVID–19 
on racial minorities—Black individuals in 
particular—have 
been 
well 
documented. 
Black people get COVID–19 at a rate nearly 
one and a half times higher than that of 
white people, are hospitalized at a rate near-
ly four times higher, and are three times as 
likely to die from the disease, according to 
the latest estimates from the U.S. Centers 
for Disease Control. 
The greater disease burden among Black 
people has caused tremendous loss of life and

unspeakable suffering across these already 
vulnerable and disadvantaged communities. 
Notably, these effects have also spilled over 
and are driving transmission rates of the 
virus in the overall population, the study au-
thors said. 
Addressing the structural inequalities at 
the roots of this disparity through monetary 
reparations would not only radically de-
crease the impact of COVID–19 among the 
people who received reparations, tbe authors 
said, but would reduce the overall toll of the 
disease on a broader scale, benefiting the en-
tire population. The findings, the researchers 
said, powerfully underscores the truly global 
nature of the pandemic and the notion that 
a society is only as strong as its most vul-
nerable members. 
‘‘If we extrapolate these results to the en-
tire United States, we can imagine that tens 
or hundreds of thousands of lives would have 
been spared, and the entire nation would 
have been saved much of the hardship it has 
endured in the last year,’’ said Richardson, 
who is also the chair of the Lancet Commis-
sion on Reparations and Redistributive Jus-
tice. 
For their analysis, tbe researchers paired 
sophisticated data analytics and computa-
tional tools with commonly used epidemio-
logic modeling methods to calculate the im-
pact of structural racism on infection rates 
among Black and white populations in Lou-
isiana. They chose Louisiana as an exemplar 
of the impacts of structural racism in the 
U.S. because it was one of the few states that 
reported infection rates by race in the early 
stages of the pandemic. For a control group, 
the researchers chose the relatively egali-
tarian population of South Korea. 
The researchers noted that although mod-
eling is used to understand many factors in 
the spread of an infectious disease, such as 
differences in infection risk based on wheth-
er passengers on a train sit with windows 
open or closed or individual variations in 
mask-wearinq habits, it has rarely been used 
to capture the effects of social factors that 
can create vast disparities between popu-
lations, such as those seen between Blacks 
and whites in the U.S. 
Richardson’s recent book Epidemic illu-
sions explores the ways conventional epide-
miology is constrained from proposing solu-
tions that address the root causes of health 
disparities derived from the combined weight 
of 
centuries 
of 
racism, 
imperialism, 
neoliberal politics, and economic exploi-
tation. One of the goals of the paper is to 
challenge the narrow ways people who work 
in medicine and public health measure and 
think about problems and solutions and to 
broaden the public imagination, thus open-
ing new conversations about what challenges 
and opportunities are worth considering in 
global health and social science, Richardson 
said. 
The study examined the initial period of 
the outbreak, before infection control meas-
ures were implemented, so any differences in 
infection rates between populations at that 
time would have been driven mainly by dif-
ferences in the social structures, the re-
searchers said. 
For example, Louisiana has a population 
heavily segregated by race, with Black peo-
ple having higher levels of overcrowded hous-
ing and working jobs that are more likely to 
expose them to SARS–CoV–2 than white peo-
ple. In comparison, South Korea has a more 
homogenous population with far less seg-
regation. 
To probe how such structural inequities 
impact transmission of SARS–CoV–2, the re-
searchers examined infection rates over time 
for the first two months of the epidemic in 
each location. During the initial phase of the 
outbreak in Louisiana, each infected person 
spread the virus to 13 to 2.5 more people than 
an infected individual durinq the same phase 
of the outbreak in South Korea, the analysis 
showed. The study also showed it took Lou-
isiana more than twice as long to bring the 
early wave of the epidemic under control as 
South Korea. 
Next, the researchers used next-generation 
matrices to gauge how overcrowding, seg-
regation, and the wealth gap between Blacks 
and whites in Louisiana could have driven 
higher infection rates and how monetary 
reparations would affect viral transmission. 
The model showed that greater equity be-
tween Blacks and whites might have reduced 
infection transmission rates by anywhere 
from 31 percent to 68 percent for every per-
son in the state. 
This research comes at a time when many 
Americans are already thinking about the 
larger societal costs of structural racism, 
the researchers said. They noted, for exam-
ple, that the nationwide movement to pro-
test police brutality against Black people 
has been fueled by many of the inequitable 
outcomes exemplified so painfully by the 
coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. 
‘‘This moment has made it possible for a 
lot of people who had no reason to think 
about these inequalities to be very aware of 
them,’’ said study co-author and Lancet rep-
arations commissioner Kirsten Mullen, who 
was a member of concept development team 
for the National Museum of African Amer-
ican History and Culture. 
ANTI-RACISM IN ACTION 
Richardson said that the research was de-
signed to explore how reparations payments 
might have altered the trajectory of the 
coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. and how a 
different response to the disease could have 
helped mitigate the disparities fueled by so-
cial conditions that are vestiges of slavery. 
Such conditions, Richardson noted, include 
ongoing discrimination and structural rac-
ism in the form of redlining, overcrowding, 
over-incarceration, and the heightened use of 
lethal force in policing experienced by Black 
people. 
Richardson said that historian and anti- 
racist scholar Ibram X. Kendi’s description 
of the differences between racism and anti- 
racism were helpful in designing the study. 
According to Kendi, a racist policy is any 
policy that produces or sustains inequality 
or promotes the power of one racial group 
over another, whereas an anti-racist policy 
is any measure that produces or sustains eq-
uity between racial groups. 
Richardson said that one important goal of 
the project was to attempt to harness the 
power of mathematical modeling for an anti- 
racist response to the coronavirus and be-
yond. 
‘‘When you look at a formula for trans-
missibility, it looks like an objective cal-
culation,’’ he said. ‘‘But where is lethal po-
licing in that formula?’’ 
Richardson noted that it was important to 
call attention to the systemic and structural 
elements of racism that can get lost in sim-
plified models of disease. 
WHAT ARE REPARATIONS? 
Mullen 
and 
study 
co-author 
William 
Darity, who recently published a book on 
reparations and have written in the press 
about the case for using reparation pay-
ments to fight COVID–19, defined reparations 
as a program of acknowledgement, redress, 
and closure for a grievous injustice. In this 
case, Mullen said, the atrocities are associ-
ated with periods of enslavement, legal seg-
regation and white terrorism during the Jim 
Crow era, and racial strife and violence of 
the post-Civil Rights Act era, including on-
going inequities in the form of over-policing, 
police executions of unarmed Black people, 
ongoing discrimination in regard to incar-
ceration, access to housing, and, possibly 
most important, the Black-white gulf in 
wealth. 
Successful reparations programs include 
three elements: admission of culpability on 
behalf of the perpetrators of the atrocity; re-
dress, in the form of an act of restitution; 
and closure, wherein the victims agree that 
the debt is paid and no further claims are to 
be made unless new harms are inflicted. 
In this case, Mullen said, reparations 
would take the form of financial restitution 
for living Black individuals who can show 
that they are descended from at least one an-
cestor who was enslaved in the U.S. and that 
they self-identified as Black on a legal docu-
ment at some point during the 12 years prior. 
The financial restitution is designed to 
help close the Black-white wealth gap. 
Darity noted that it is important to distin-
guish wealth from income. Wealth is how 
much you own, and income is how much you 
earn. Greater wealth translates to greater 
stability for individuals and families across 
time. Greater wealth is also more strongly 
associated with greater well-being than 
greater income, Darity said, and disparities 
in wealth manifest as health disparities. 
Wealth is more strongly associated with 
familial 
or 
individual 
well-being,’’ 
said 
Darity, who is the Samuel DuBois Cook Dis-
tinguished Professor of Public Policy at 
Duke University and a Lancet reparations 
commissioner. He noted that, according to 
the Federal Reserve Board 2016 Survey of 
Consumer 
Finances, 
the 
average 
Black 
household had a net worth $800,000 lower 
than the average white household, and that 
Black people, who represent 13 percent of the 
U.S. population, only own 3 percent of the 
nation’s wealth. 
‘‘This dramatically restricts the ability of 
Black Americans to survive and thrive,’’ 
Darity said. 
To assess the effect of reparation payments 
on the trajectory of the pandemic, the re-
searchers based their calculations on a 
model that would pay $250,000 per person or 
$800,000 per household to descendants of 
enslaved individuals—one of several proposed 
reparation models. 
EVERY TRANSMISSION IS A SOCIAL 
TRANSMISSION 
‘‘Every transmission has a social cause,’’ 
said study co-author and Lancet reparations 
commissioner James Jones, associate pro-
fessor of Earth System Science and a senior 
fellow at the Woods Institute for the Envi-
ronment at Stanford University. 
For a brief moment when AIDS was in the 
spotlight during the late 80s and early 90s, 
people interested in social behavior became 
interested in mathematical modeling of dis-
ease, Jones said. While that interest largely 
waned, the COVID–19 crisis has highlighted 
the need to think about social science, in-
equality, social structure, behavior patterns, 
and behavior change, as well as how they fit 
together with how we understand and re-
spond to epidemics, Jones said. 
Even the simplest model must account for 
a rudimentary social structure, Jones said. 
At its most basic, this can be represented 
with a generalized estimate of how likely an 
infected person is to come into contact with 
a susceptible person. He explained that this 
number, R0 or ‘‘R-naught,’’ is the average 
number of people an infected individual 
transmits the virus to. When R0 is less than 
one, no epidemic is possible because the 
number of people infected decreases. When 
R0 is greater than 1 an epidemic is possible. 
R0 also determines the total number of peo-
ple who could potentially become infected or 
how many people would need to be vac-
cinated to end the epidemic. It can also be

used to calculate the so-called endemic equi-
librium—which determines whether a disease 
will continue to exist within a population, 
simmering constantly in the background or 
bubbling up seasonally, like influenza. 
‘‘That’s the theory of infectious disease 
control in a single parameter,’’ Jones said. 
That seeming simplicity can make it hard 
to focus on the complex ways that infectious 
diseases move through the real world, the re-
searchers said. 
‘‘It’s important to highlight that R0 is not 
simply a function of the pathogen,’’ Jones 
said. ‘‘It’s a function of the society.’’ Social 
and environmental factors like mobility, 
segregation, and the nature of the built envi-
ronment help determine rates of infection, 
he said. 
This is one important reason that diseases 
don’t hit all people the same. Global R0 is an 
average of very different R0s for different 
groups of people. Some groups are more like-
ly to interact only with members of their 
own group, some groups are more likely to 
come in contact with infected people, and 
some are more susceptible to the disease for 
other reasons, Jones said. 
In this case, the researchers used mathe-
matical models to help understand the dif-
ferences in R0 for Black people and white 
people in Louisiana and to help think about 
how things would change if racism were less 
prevalent in America. 
Absent those interventions, the research-
ers noted that Black Americans remain at an 
elevated and inequitable risk of becoming in-
fected and dying during the COVID–19 pan-
demic and that this inequity will continue to 
fuel the pandemic for all Americans. 
‘‘Increasing equality would have huge ben-
efits on infection rates for everyone,’’ said 
co-author Momin Malik, who was a data 
science postdoctoral fellow at the Berkman 
Klein Center for Internet & Society at Har-
vard University at the time the study was 
conducted.

Ms. JACKSON LEE. It states: ‘‘Civil

this 
report 
opens up. This is a scientific, vetted re-
port from the Harvard University Med-
ical School. It is titled ‘‘Anti-Racist 
Epidemiology: Research suggests rep-
arations for slavery could have reduced 
COVID–19 infections and deaths in the 
U.S.’’ This was published online on 
February 10. 
It says: ‘‘To estimate the impact of 
structural inequities between Black 
and White individuals, the researchers 
set out to capture the effect of repara-
tion payments on the Black-White 
wealth gap in the State of Louisiana.’’ 
This is an important report. 
‘‘The

individuals in particular—have been 
well documented. Black people get 
COVID–19 at a rate nearly one-and-a-

according to the latest estimates from

‘‘The greater disease burden among 
Black people has caused tremendous 
loss of life and unspeakable suffering 
across these already vulnerable and 
disadvantaged communities. Notably, 
these effects have also spilled over and 
are driving transmission rates of the 
virus in the overall population.’’ 
They did their study in many places, 
but I will read a portion. ‘‘The study 
examined the initial period of the out-
break, before infection control meas-
ures were implemented, so any dif-
ferences in infection rates between 
populations at the time would have 
been driven mainly by differences in 
the social structures.’’ 
‘‘Louisiana has a population heavily 
segregated by race, with Black people 
having higher levels of overcrowded 
housing and working jobs that are 
more likely to expose them,’’ and they 
found that if reparations had been 
given, they would have done better. 
I conclude, Mr. Speaker, by just say-
ing that you see a picture of the Tulsa 
race riot. That is why I stand here 
today to say that Tulsa Greenwood 
needs reparation. H.R. 40 needs to pass. 
Why don’t we do it together? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance

S4953 
Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JULY 20, 2021 
No. 127 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Honorable RAPH-
AEL G. WARNOCK, a Senator from the 
State of Georgia. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, who has ordained the seasons 
of our lives, thank You for the stead-
fastness of Your mercy and long suf-
fering. 
Today, inspire our lawmakers to 
open themselves to the gift of Your 
presence, remembering that You are al-
ways with them. Where there is fear, 
give courage. Where there is anxiety, 
give peace. Where there is despair, give 
hope. Where there is sadness, give joy. 
May our Senators joyfully encounter 
You on a daily basis. Lord, inspire 
them to hear Your words and obey 
Your precepts. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge 
of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the following letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, July 20, 2021. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
appoint the Honorable RAPHAEL G. WARNOCK, 
a Senator from the State of Georgia, to per-
form the duties of the Chair. 
PATRICK J. LEAHY, 
President pro tempore. 
Mr. WARNOCK thereupon assumed 
the Chair as Acting President pro tem-
pore. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, for 
decades, both parties have shared a de-
sire to invest in our Nation’s infra-
structure. It is one of the few issues 
here in Washington where our two par-
ties can consistently work together, 
and it has been years since Congress 
passed a significant stand-alone invest-
ment. We are hoping to change that 
this year. 
Nearly a month ago—a month ago—a 
bipartisan group of Senators came to-
gether, along with the White House, 
and agreed on a framework for a bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill. So last night 
I moved to set up a process for the Sen-
ate to consider that bipartisan frame-
work. 
On Wednesday, the Senate will take 
the first procedural vote on a shell bill, 
merely a vehicle to get the whole proc-
ess started. It is not a final deadline for 
legislative text. It is not a cynical 
ploy. It is not a fish-or-cut-bait mo-
ment. It is not an attempt to jam any-
one. It is only a signal that the Senate 
is ready to get the process started, 
something the Senate has routinely 
done on other bipartisan bills this 
year. 
All a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the motion to 
proceed means is simply that the Sen-
ate is ready to begin debating a bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill—no more, no 
less. We have waited a month. It is 
time to move forward. 
My colleagues have heard me speak 
for months about making progress on 
two different tracks of infrastructure. 
After the group of Senators reached a 
deal with the White House, I endorsed 
it and I announced I wanted to put 
their agreement on the floor of the 
Senate in July. This week’s vote is an 
honest attempt to get something done, 
to get the ball rolling on the Senate 
floor. 
That is why I am giving the max-
imum amount of flexibility to our Sen-
ate colleagues who are negotiating this 
bill. If the bipartisan group can finalize 
the text of their agreement by Thurs-
day, I will offer it as the pending sub-
stitute amendment. If, for whatever 
reason, the bipartisan group isn’t ready 
with their final text by Thursday, I 
will offer an amendment consisting 
only of the bipartisan infrastructure 
bills that have already gone through 
our Senate committees and are actu-
ally the core of the bipartisan infra-
structure framework. They are the 
water bill, the highway bill, the rail 
and safety bill, and the energy bill. 
All of them are bipartisan, all of 
them have gone through committee, 
and all of them received overwhelming 
Republican votes. Why wouldn’t our 
Republican colleagues want to move to 
proceed to debate that bill, at the very 
minimum, even if we don’t have agree-
ment on the broader bipartisan bill? 
Just to go over the record, the Envi-
ronment and Public Works Committee 
reported the water bill, passed by voice 
vote, unanimous, in committee and 
then 89 to 2 on the Senate floor. The 
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee 
reported 
the 
highway 
bill, 
passed by 20 to 0. The Commerce Com-
mittee reported the rail and safety bill, 
passed by 25 to 3. And the Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee report of 
the energy bill passed 13 to 7. 
So once again, to repeat, this week’s 
vote is an honest attempt to get some-
thing done, to get the ball rolling on

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4954 
July 20, 2021 
the Senate floor, after a month, after 
the agreement was reached by the bi-
partisan group and the White House. 
That is why I am giving the maximum 
amount of flexibility to our Senate col-
leagues who are negotiating the bill. If 
the bipartisan group can finalize their 
agreement by Thursday, I will offer it 
as the pending substitute amendment, 
as I mentioned before. I just wanted to 
repeat that so people hear it loud and 
clear. 
The bills I mentioned are the lowest 
common denominator and the most 
agreeable starting point, a package of 
bipartisan bills that nearly all the Sen-
ators have already supported this year, 
a package of bills that the bipartisan 
group is using as the basis of their 
framework. And once it is on the floor, 
we can then debate, amend, and work 
from there. It is not the final word. 
There will be no doubt many Sen-
ators would want to offer additional 
items from the bipartisan framework 
or 
other 
issues: 
from 
transit 
to 
broadband, to resiliency, and more. 
And, of course, if the bipartisan group 
finalizes their product over the week-
end, Senators can offer it as an amend-
ment at that point, and I will make 
sure that that amendment is in order. 
Let me repeat. Even if the text of the 
bipartisan framework isn’t ready by 
Thursday and we agree to make the 
package of bipartisan bills that I men-
tioned the starting point, Senators can 
still work on the bipartisan framework 
and offer it as an amendment later on. 
The bottom line is very simple. If 
Senators agree to start debate, there 
will be many, many opportunities for 
the bipartisan group to make their 
agreement the base of the bill. But if 
Republican Senators refuse to start de-
bate, they would be denying the Senate 
an opportunity to consider the bipar-
tisan amendment. 
And this is not a new process. We 
have used it regularly here in the Sen-
ate, on the anti-Asian hate crimes bill, 
the U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act. On both of those, the Senate 
agreed to start debate, just to proceed 
on a base bill, a shell bill. It took sev-
eral weeks of amendments before ev-
eryone was ready to move forward, 
eventually 
and 
successfully. 
Both 
measures passed with significant bipar-
tisan support. 
If we did it there—on the anti-Asian 
hate bill, on the U.S. Innovation and 
Competition Act—we can do it here. 
There is no reason we can’t do it here 
with infrastructure. 
Look, Senators of good will on both 
sides want to finish the bipartisan in-
frastructure bill before the August re-
cess. That is certainly my goal. But in 
order to finish the bill, we first need to 
agree to start. Let me repeat that. But 
in order to finish the bill, we first need 
to agree to start. That is the first step. 
Let’s all agree to start. That is what 
this week’s vote is about, and I hope 
my Republican colleagues will join us 
in beginning debate. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on an-
other matter, right now, there is a fire 
burning in Oregon the size of New York 
City. A heat wave recently rolled 
through the Pacific Northwest that 
melted power lines and cracked road-
ways in two. Hurricanes and flooding 
in the East have battered one commu-
nity after the other. Earlier this year, 
a snowstorm engulfed the typically 
scorching State of Texas and claimed 
the lives of hundreds—hundreds—of 
people. And, of course, we saw what 
happened in Europe with the flooding. 
These 
extreme, 
once-in-a-century 
weather events are now commonplace. 
The dangers of climate change are 
here, and they are real. Fighting cli-
mate change will take not only new 
technologies and new ways of thinking 
but something more basic: It will take 
people—people, lots of people—working 
together to fight climate change from 
the ground up. 
This morning, I joined with my 
Democratic colleagues from the House 
and Senate to push a bold, new ap-
proach to fighting climate change that 
will help create thousands of good-pay-
ing jobs in the process: the Civilian Cli-
mate Corps, CCC. 
The idea at the core of the Civilian 
Climate Corps harkens back to the New 
Deal, when hundreds of thousands of 
Americans were put to work on con-
servation and infrastructure projects 
across the country. During the Great 
Depression, President Roosevelt needed 
ways to put Americans to work and to 
do it fast, and he found a way to do it 
while having those workers do some-
thing enormously productive for their 
country: building public works and 
dams and bridges and airfields and 
flood and forest-fire prevention. 
The Civilian Conservation Corps, as 
it was called at the time, was a bril-
liant idea—a success—that should be 
harnessed once again, this time to 
fight climate change. 
The bottom line: We need a CCC for 
the 21st century. We can put Ameri-
cans to work on climate and resiliency 
projects. We can put Americans to 
work on clean energy initiatives across 
the country. We can put Americans to 
work helping poorer and more discon-
nected communities handle the chal-
lenge of climate change. And we can 
create hundreds of thousands of good- 
paying jobs, particularly focusing on 
the poorer communities, the commu-
nities of color that have been left out 
in the past. 
The Civilian Climate Corps can be 
one of the largest employment projects 
and one of the largest environmental 
projects at the same time. I believe the 
Senate should work to make this a re-
ality this year. I believe the CCC, the 
Civilian Climate Corps, should be one 
of the pillars of the American Jobs and 
Family Plan. As majority leader, I will 
ensure that CCC will be included in the 
upcoming budget reconciliation pack-
age in as big and bold a way as pos-
sible. 
VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, fi-
nally, later, the Senate will pass a 
long-overdue fix to the Crime Victims 
Fund to help Americans stitch back 
their lives after falling victim to vio-
lent crime. 
As hard as it is to suffer the trauma 
of a violent crime, survivors almost al-
ways face enormous financial hardship 
in the immediate aftermath. Just 
think about healthcare or mental 
health services for victims of human 
trafficking or sexual assault, emer-
gency housing for victims of serious 
domestic abuse, legal fees for those 
who try to pursue justice for the crime 
committed against them. Those serv-
ices can cost tens of thousands of dol-
lars. So for nearly 35 years, the Justice 
Department has operated a Crime Vic-
tims Fund that uses money from Fed-
eral convictions and fines to help sur-
vivors of violent crime. It is a simple 
idea. It has helped thousands and thou-
sands of Americans during the most 
challenging moments of their lives. 
But today, this popular and effective 
program is in danger of going into the 
red. Compared to 5 years ago, the 
Crime Victims Fund could fall to less 
than one-twentieth—one-twentieth—of 
its former size by the end of the next 
fiscal year. Well, the Senate is not 
going to abandon Americans who sur-
vived violent crimes. Today, the Sen-
ate will pass legislation to replenish 
the Crime Victims Fund and set it on a 
path toward long-term stability. The 
Crime Victims Fund has been a beacon 
of hope and healing for countless sur-
vivors over the decades. With today’s 
vote, survivors of violent crime can 
rest assured that it will continue to be 
that beacon of hope and healing for 
decades more to come.

f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-

f 
NOMINATION OF JENNIFER ANN 
ABRUZZO 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
later today, the Senate will vote on 
President Biden’s nominee to serve as 
general counsel for the National Labor 
Relations Board. 
There actually shouldn’t be a va-
cancy in this position. When President 
Biden took office, the person serving as 
the NLRB’s top lawyer was still in the 
middle of a term to which the Senate 
had confirmed him. He was doing his 
job, serving the country, and had no in-
tention to skip out of his responsibil-
ities early. 
But less than 30 minutes after pledg-
ing to heal and unify the country in his 
inaugural 
address, 
President 
Biden 
broke precedent and threatened to fire 
Peter Robb unless he resigned pre-
maturely that very day. 
At the very first instant that the new 
President’s statements about norms, 
institutions, and governance ran up 
against the demands of the far left— 
well, the decision didn’t take very 
long. Where Senate confirmation and 
fixed terms were supposed to create 
independence, this administration just 
wanted partisan loyalty. 
Unfortunately, this was not an iso-
lated incident. It has actually been a 
pattern. This small world of inde-
pendent agencies has offered us actu-
ally a case study in the gap between 
the administration’s unifying rhetoric 
on the one hand and its divisive actions 
on the other. 
Back in March, the Biden adminis-
tration took aim at another Senate- 
confirmed official, the general counsel 
for the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission. This time, a full 2 years 
before her term was set to expire. Shar-
on Gustafson had been engaged in im-
portant work, particularly in defense 
of religious freedom in the workplace. 
But the President didn’t want to wait 
for our system to play out properly. He 
broke with norms and he fired her. 
Just this month, we witnessed the 
firing of Andrew Saul, the head of the 
Social Security Administration. Listen 
to this. He was just 2 years into a 
6-year term. Mr. Saul had kept a crit-
ical agency functioning through a his-
torically challenging year. He was not 
some partisan hack. We are talking 
about someone the Senate confirmed 
with 77 votes—77 votes—a bipartisan 
supermajority for Mr. Saul. 
But powerful liberal interests got the 
President’s ear. They wanted their own 
hand-picked insider. Norms and prece-
dents had to go out the window. Now, 
the American people deserve to trust in 
the independence of crucial watchdog 
agencies like these, but with these 
firings, this administration has instead 
decided to explore frontiers in partisan 
hardball. 
We just spent years listening to the 
left and the media express outrage over 
personnel 
decisions 
and 
dismissals, 
many of which amounted to a heck of 
a lot less than the three I just men-
tioned. 
f 
VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
an entirely different matter, later 
today, the Senate is set to do some bi-
partisan legislating. 
Back in 1984, Congress passed a Vic-
tims of Crime Act, which includes an 
important Federal program called a 
Crime Victims Fund. When criminals 
who 
commit 
Federal 
crimes 
are 
charged fines and penalties, some of 
that money flows into this fund. It 
goes to State-level programs that help 
crime victims with services, like coun-
seling and emergency shelters. It also 
helps compensate the victims directly 
with their expenses, like medical costs, 
mental health, funeral expenses, and 
lost wages. Some of the money also 
goes specifically to fight child abuse. 
This fund needs to rest on firm finan-
cial footing, but right now it doesn’t 
have that firm footing. Its balance has 
been shrinking fast. Congress needs to 
act to prevent big cuts to victims’ serv-
ices, particularly in rural areas. 
A number of Senators on both sides 
have come together and produced bi-
partisan reforms that will strengthen 
the program and keep assistance flow-
ing to the survivors of Federal crimes. 
The junior Senator from Pennsyl-
vania has a further amendment to 
make sure the program can’t be used as 
part of budgetary shell games that de-
liberately cloud Federal accounting. I 
will support both Senator TOOMEY’s 
amendment and our colleagues’ legisla-
tion later today. 
But on this subject, for goodness’ 
sake, elected officials should not just 
be racing to replenish the Crime Vic-
tims Fund before it runs out. Leaders 
at local, State, and Federal levels 
should be acting to confront the surge 
in violent crime that is plaguing our 
Nation. 
For about a year now, the political 
left has grown obsessed with the notion 
that police officers are inherently bad, 
policing is inherently evil, and what 
vulnerable neighborhoods really need 
is less enforcement of the laws. 
As one House Member has informed 
us: 
Defunding police means defunding police. 
Another put it this way: 
Defunding the police isn’t radical, it is 
real. 
Well, academic research has con-
firmed something troubling. The broad 
anti-police backlash that sometimes 
follows high-profile, police-involved in-
cidents subsequently leads to less safe-
ty, more crime, and more murders. 
Sure enough, murders have shot up in 
cities and communities all across our 
country. 
My hometown of Louisville has seen 
66 percent more homicides than we had 
seen by this time last year—66 percent 
more. Last year was a record year for 
carjackings and yet Louisville is on 
pace to match it once again. The city’s 
police department is short more than 
200 sworn officers due to low recruit-
ment, low morale, and resignations. 
Leaders should be working to contain 
this damage, but instead of delivering a 
sober, responsible message, many of 
the most prominent Democratic politi-
cians instead grabbed their mega-
phones and amplified the anti-police 
sentiment as loud as possible. 
As I have noted before, attacking and 
insulting the police is not just a bad 
strategy for public safety across the 
board; the data shows it is an espe-
cially disruptive approach to advanc-
ing racial justice. 
The truth is this: 
Larger police forces save lives and the 
lives saved are disproportionately Black 
lives. 
That is another expert study. 
So I am glad the Senate will take the 
important step today of reforming and 
strengthening the Crime Victims Fund. 
It certainly belies any notion that we 
can’t legislate in a bipartisan way. We 
absolutely can and we do. When a bi-
partisan outcome is what the Demo-
cratic majority leader truly wants, it 
actually makes it possible. 
But I wish anti-crime, pro-police, 
pro-public safety attitudes and policies 
could be just as bipartisan at the 
State, local, and Federal levels as to-
day’s vote will likely be. Standing up 
for law enforcement and the innocent 
people they protect should never be 
limited to one side of the aisle.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4956 
July 20, 2021 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I heard 
the Republican leader on the floor just 
moments ago talking about the dis-
missal of some individuals by the Biden 
administration and their replacement, 
and his complaint that this violated 
the norms and the precedents of the 
U.S. Senate. 
There are certainly two words I 
would offer in response to that asser-
tion: Merrick Garland. 
I would offer those words to the Re-
publican leader as a reminder of what 
he did when there was a vacancy on the 
highest Court in the land, the U.S. Su-
preme Court. Antonin Scalia passed 
away, and a vacancy occurred. It was 
the last year of the Obama administra-
tion. 
Tradition suggested that that Presi-
dent of the United States, duly elected 
and in office, had the responsibility 
and the opportunity to fill the va-
cancy, and so he offered as his nominee 
Merrick Garland from the DC Circuit 
court. 
What happened to Merrick Garland’s 
nomination? What was the norm and 
precedent? Well, there would be a hear-
ing and a consideration of that nomi-
nation and a vote in the U.S. Senate. 
That process was stopped in its 
tracks by one leader, the Republican 
leader of the U.S. Senate from Ken-
tucky. 
So when he talks about norms and 
precedents and creating and filling va-
cancies, he has forgotten that he made 
history in a very unusual way: by vio-
lating the most basic norm and prece-
dent that the U.S. Senate had the re-
sponsibility to fill a vacancy on the Su-
preme Court. And the President of the 
United States, duly elected, was not a 
lameduck in the last year of his admin-
istration. 
The second issue which was raised by 
the Republican leader this morning 
dealt with the phrase ‘‘defunding the 
police.’’ I have rejected that phrase 
from the first time I heard it. I 
couldn’t imagine anyone thinking that 
this was a sensible policy to follow 
when it came to the security of our 
homes and our communities. 
I can’t speak for anybody else in the 
Senate, but in the awful circumstance 
when one is called on to dial 911, you 
certainly hope that the police will an-
swer and that they will be there if they 
are needed. Defunding them lessens 
that possibility, and I am not a person 
who supports that. 
I want the very best police and law 
enforcement. I want them well trained, 
and I want them to follow norms and 
conduct that are respectful of Amer-
ican values. But defunding the police is 
not something I have ever embraced or 
ever will. 
But it is interesting to hear that ar-
gument from the Senator from Ken-
tucky. He said that, in a way, you 
would be insulting and attacking the 
police by taking that position. One 
could argue that, but I would suggest 
to him that, in his position, stopping 
the creation of a commission to inves-
tigate what happened in this Chamber 
on January 6 and what happened to 140 
members of law enforcement in the 
Halls of the U.S. Capitol on the same 
day is not respectful of the police 
itself. 
We have had a plea—a direct plea 
from the men and women in uniform 
who guard us in this building to have 
an investigative commission determine 
what was behind that insurrectionist 
mob of January 6 and what we need to 
do to avoid it in the future. That com-
mission and its prospects were stopped 
cold by the Republican leader from 
Kentucky. That is a fact. 
In terms of being respectful of law 
enforcement, allowing that commis-
sion to be created—a bipartisan com-
mission—to get to the bottom of that 
horrible incident, that embarrassing 
incident in the history of the United 
States, is the least we can do to re-
spond to what the police who guard us 
have asked for. 
I might add one other element while 
we are on the discussion of law enforce-
ment and protecting America. We have 
a special security supplemental appro-
priation that was created by Senator 
PATRICK LEAHY of Vermont, the chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Ap-
propriations, which appropriates the 
funds to pay the National Guard units 
who left their families and came here 
to protect us, and to pay the Capitol 
Police for the expenses they incurred 
on January 6 to fortify this Capitol 
against any future insurrectionist mob. 
That supplemental appropriations bill, 
which should have been passed rou-
tinely weeks ago, is still languishing 
for lack of agreement on the Repub-
lican side. 
If you want to be respectful of law 
enforcement, whether they are men 
and women in uniform, in police units, 
or the National Guard, wouldn’t you 
pay them for the services they have 
rendered to protect this Capitol and to 
protect the United States of America? 
I call on the Republican leader: In-
stead of making a speech on the floor, 
call the Republican ranking member 
on the Senate Committee on Appro-
priations and ask him to waste no time 
in showing respect for law enforcement 
and to pass that security supplemental. 
NOMINATION OF KENNETH ALLEN POLITE, JR. 
Mr. President, on another topic, this 
week, the Senate will vote on the nom-
ination of Kenneth Polite. President 
Biden has nominated him to serve as 
Assistant Attorney General for the 
Justice Department’s Criminal Divi-
sion. 
As an experienced prosecutor who 
has served his community throughout 
his career, Mr. Polite is certainly 
qualified for this important position. 
From 2013 to 2017, Mr. Polite served as 
the U.S. attorney for the Eastern Dis-
trict of Louisiana. While in this role, 
Mr. Polite’s office prosecuted several 
large, violent, criminal organizations. 
He held local corrupt politicians ac-
countable and stopped more human 
traffickers than during any prior U.S. 
attorney’s term in office. 
Prior to serving the people of Lou-
isiana, Mr. Polite served as an assist-
ant U.S. attorney in the Southern Dis-
trict of New York, which is a very busy 
and important office. There, he took on 
organized crime, fought corruption, 
healthcare fraud, and identity theft. 
In addition to his extensive experi-
ence as a public servant, Mr. Polite 
also has a remarkable personal story. 
Born to teenage parents, he spent his 
youth in public housing projects in 
New Orleans before moving to the 
Lower Ninth Ward as a child. He grad-
uated high school as the valedictorian 
of his class, and he went on to earn his 
undergraduate degree from Harvard 
and his law degree from the well-re-
spected Georgetown University. After 
law school, Mr. Polite initially went 
into private practice, but he was in-
spired to become a prosecutor after his 
half brother was tragically killed by 
gun violence. 
Throughout his career, Mr. Polite 
has always given back to the commu-
nity that raised him. He has served on 
the boards of numerous community or-
ganizations and schools in New Orle-
ans, and Mr. Polite’s track record as an 
even-handed public servant has earned 
him support from across the aisle. 
In 2011, he was appointed by a Repub-
lican Governor of Louisiana, Bobby 
Jindal, to serve on the Louisiana Civil 
Service Commission. 
Then, last month, the Republican At-
torney 
General 
of 
Louisiana, 
Jeff 
Landry, publicly voiced his support for 
Mr. Polite’s nomination to this posi-
tion in the Department of Justice. In a 
letter to the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, Mr. Landry wrote that, while 
serving as U.S. attorney, ‘‘Mr. Polite 
was not only an effective crime fighter, 
but he was also an invaluable member 
of the community.’’ 
Mr. Polite is an outstanding nominee 
for this critical role at the Justice De-
partment. You should have been in the 
Judiciary Committee, which the Pre-
siding Officer serves on, when his nomi-
nation came up. The praise that he won 
from the two Republican Senators of 
Louisiana is an indication of this 
man’s popularity and of his value to 
Louisiana and to our country. I hope 
that he will receive the same broad bi-
partisan support in the full Senate, and 
I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting Mr. Polite’s nomination.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4957 
July 20, 2021 
went into effect on July 15, and many 
were awakened to the good news that 
their checking and savings accounts 
had been increased because of this new 
child tax credit. 
It was part of the American Rescue 
Plan, the proposal by President Biden 
to get America back on its feet. You 
remember that plan, almost $2 trillion. 
It was an important infusion into our 
economy. Money within that plan was 
being spent on the administration of 
vaccines across America. In addition to 
that, money was available for small 
businesses to receive forgivable loans. 
And this provision, that of enhancing 
the child tax credit, was an important 
part of it as well. 
We have had tax credits in the past 
for families with children, but this was 
an especially important one because it 
was fully refundable, which meant it 
went to the lower-income families who 
might not have had enough income to 
merit a tax responsibility. This now is 
fully refundable, so there is no tax re-
sponsibility necessary to receive the 
payment. It also was a benefit that ex-
tended beyond poor and low-income 
families 
to 
middle-income 
families 
across America. Some of these families 
with this payment of $300 a month for 
each child under the age of 6 and $250 a 
month for those between 6 and 17 would 
receive 
resources 
which 
they 
des-
perately need to make certain that 
their children have a fighting chance. 
We are especially proud of the fact 
that this infusion of cash into the 
hands of many families will literally 
mean it will lift them above the pov-
erty line in America. Almost half of 
the kids in poverty will be spared that 
by this tax credit. So it has a direct 
and important impact. 
I had a press conference last Friday 
in Chicago with one of the parents who 
will be benefited by this. Her name is 
Susana Salgado. She is a mother of 
three—an 11-year-old, a 16-year-old, 
and a 23-year-old. Her family relies on 
her husband’s income. He works as a 
restaurant worker in Chicago to pay 
the bills, but when the pandemic hit, 
his hours were cut drastically. A return 
to normal remains elusive for people 
like Susana Salgado because, at the 
same time the family’s livelihood van-
ished, their cost of living increased. 
During the pandemic, as parents 
know well, schooling moved into the 
home and the high-speed internet con-
nection became an absolute necessity 
for her kids to keep up in school. 
Thanks to the enhanced child tax cred-
it, 
Susana 
can 
finally 
afford 
her 
monthly internet bill. It sounds like a 
small thing, but if the alternative is a 
child falling behind a grade in school, 
it is a critical family decision. That 
means her two younger children can 
keep up with their studies and her old-
est son can remain in college. Some-
thing as basic as that can mean the dif-
ference in a young child’s progress in 
his life. 
So I salute President Biden for the 
American Rescue Plan, which helped to 
distribute vaccines across America, 
helped small businesses get back on 
their feet, and is helping millions of 
Americans and children and families as 
of this day. I am sorry that there was 
not one single Republican vote in sup-
port of that proposal, but I believe it 
was money well spent and continues to 
benefit this country. We have a lot of 
work to do in this country. 
I will close by saying this: I was on 
radio shows this morning in downstate 
Illinois. Chicago, and the Chicagoland, 
area have been able to get vaccinated 
to a level where they are starting to 
breathe a little easier in anticipating 
children going back to school in the 
fall, businesses reopening, and people 
getting out and about. You can just 
feel it in the air. Yet that is not the 
case all over the United States. 
The City of Los Angeles, I under-
stand, is opposed to a new mask re-
quirement, which, unfortunately, evi-
dences the fact that there are still too 
many infections these days related to 
COVID–19. Unfortunately, as Dr. Fauci 
and others have said, these infections 
are reflected in people who have not 
yet been vaccinated, by and large, and 
it is an indication that we can’t let up 
on our effort to continue vaccinations 
across America. It is the only way to 
successfully put this pandemic to rest 
and return to normal life in America. 
To those who are not vaccinated, I 
am sure they are not watching C–SPAN 
for advice, but I hope they will turn to 
a doctor or a nurse or to someone they 
trust in the community and hear about 
the safety of these vaccines, which 
have been safely administered to mil-
lions of people across the United 
States. 
If each and every one of us accepts 
our personal responsibility to get vac-
cinated to protect ourselves, our fami-
lies, those we love, and those all 
around us, we will finally bring this 
pandemic to an end. At this point, 
there are many, many who are still 
holding back. I hope they will recon-
sider that position. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Republican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that Senators COR-
NYN, GRASSLEY, and I be allowed to 
complete our remarks before the sched-
uled rollcall votes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, it has 
been all political theater all the time 
lately as the Democrats attempt to 
manufacture a crisis that will allow 
them to pass their partisan Federal 
takeover of State election law. 
There was President Biden’s over-
wrought speech in Philadelphia last 
week warning that election laws being 
passed in various States are ‘‘the most 
dangerous threat to voting and the in-
tegrity of free and fair elections in our 
history.’’ 
That is right, in our Nation’s history. 
Apparently, post-Civil War voter sup-
pression laws and poll taxes and other 
atrocities don’t hold a candle to what 
is happening today in places like Geor-
gia, where—the horror—only election 
officials will be able to hand out water 
to those in line at the polls. 
Then, of course, there were the Texas 
Democrats’ antics as they flew to 
Washington via a private jet to shut 
down the Texas Legislature and pre-
vent election legislation from being 
passed there, and the Senate Demo-
crats’ field hearing in Georgia yester-
day to highlight the supposed horrors 
of Georgia’s mainstream election law. 
In his speech last week, President 
Biden mentioned stopping the spread of 
disinformation, which is an ironic 
statement when the Democrats are en-
gaging in one of the most massive cam-
paigns of disinformation we have ever 
seen, because—and let’s be very clear— 
the narrative the Democrats are ped-
dling, which is that States are engag-
ing in a massive campaign of voter sup-
pression, is simply false. 
In other years, I doubt whether any 
of the State voting laws that have been 
passed would have been more than a 
blip in the national news because they 
are nothing more than ordinary, main-
stream updates to State voting guide-
lines. The Georgia law that has pro-
voked so much Democratic hysteria is 
not only squarely in the mainstream 
when it comes to State election laws, 
but it is actually, in some ways, more 
permissive than voting laws in some 
Democratic-led States. 
A piece in the New York Times, hard-
ly a newspaper that carries water for 
Republicans, concluded that the voting 
provisions of the Georgia law are ‘‘un-
likely to significantly affect turnout or 
Democratic chances.’’ 
In fact, the piece notes that Geor-
gia’s law could ‘‘plausibly even in-
crease turnout.’’ 
Meanwhile, 
the 
Washington 
Post 
Fact Checker column noted again: 
‘‘The law does not put up roadblocks to 
Black Americans registering to vote.’’ 
That from the Washington Post Fact 
Checker. 
And yet Democrats have repeatedly 
asked us to believe that this law is 
‘‘Jim Crow on steroids’’ and part of 
‘‘the most significant test of our de-
mocracy since the Civil War.’’ Those 
are quotes, actual quotes, from Demo-
crats. 
That is right, since the Civil War. 
Apparently, segregation and the hor-
rors of Jim Crow are nothing compared 
to Georgia’s adjustment of its regula-
tions on no-excuse absentee voting, 
which isn’t even allowed in some Dem-
ocrat-led States like New York. 
It is almost comical, except that it is 
not, because there is nothing funny 
about Democrats irresponsibly evoking 
the horrors of Jim Crow to convince 
Americans that reasonable reforms to 
election laws are really a dastardly 
plot to suppress votes.

July 20, 2021 
American people in order to pass their 
election legislation because that is ex-
actly—exactly—what 
Democrats 
are 
doing. 
Democrats have been determined to 
pass H.R. 1, their Federal takeover of 
State election law, since 2019. Back in 
2019, of course, they told us we needed 
it because our democracy was broken, 
but then the 2020 elections happened 
and, lo and behold, Democrats won, and 
all of a sudden our democracy was 
working 
fine—a 
record 
turnout, 
I 
might add, in the 2020 election, the 
largest since the year 1900. 
But Democrats still want to pass 
H.R. 1, now because, as both the Speak-
er of the House and the House Demo-
cratic whip have openly admitted, they 
think it will improve their electoral 
chances, and so they have manufac-
tured a crisis in the hope of convincing 
the American people of the need to 
pass Democratic legislation. 
There is a reason that Senate Demo-
crats haven’t managed to pass H.R. 1 so 
far, and that is because it is a terrible 
bill. The bill would seize power from 
States when it comes to regulating and 
administering elections, an authority 
that States have held, literally, since 
the founding. 
It would implement public funding of 
political campaigns, which would mean 
that billions of government dollars, 
money that belongs to the American 
taxpayer, would go to funding yard 
signs and attack ads—I am sure some-
thing the American taxpayers would be 
really happy to see. 
It would impose onerous new require-
ments and restrictions on political 
speech. It would open up private Amer-
icans to retaliation and intimidation 
simply for making a donation to sup-
port a cause that they believe in. 
It would effectively eliminate States’ 
voter ID requirements. It would politi-
cize the IRS by allowing the IRS to 
consider organizations’ beliefs when 
deciding whether or not to grant them 
tax-exempt status, and the list goes on. 
No less an organization than the 
American Civil Liberties Union op-
posed—opposed—H.R. 1 in the last Con-
gress because the bill would ‘‘unconsti-
tutionally 
burden 
speech 
and 
associational rights.’’ 
Let me just repeat that for emphasis. 
The American Civil Liberties Union op-
posed this legislation because it would 
‘‘unconstitutionally burden speech and 
associational rights.’’ 
In his speech last week, President 
Biden expressed concern about States 
like 
Georgia 
‘‘moving 
from 
inde-
pendent election administrators who 
work for the people to polarized state 
legislatures and partisan actors who 
work for political parties.’’ 
It made me wonder if the President 
even knows what is in H.R. 1 because 
H.R. 1 would make the Federal Elec-
tion Commission, the primary enforcer 
of election law in this country, into a 
partisan body. 
Instead of an independent Commis-
sion, evenly divided between Demo-
crats and Republicans, the FEC would 
become, to borrow the President’s 
words, a partisan actor that works for 
political parties. 
If the President is concerned about 
independent 
election 
administrators 
becoming partisan actors, perhaps he 
should take a look at revising his par-
ty’s legislation. 
Since they have so far been unable to 
get their partisan election takeover 
through the Senate, Democrats are 
now threatening to include election 
measures in the partisan tax-and- 
spending bill that they are planning to 
force through Congress using rules 
which allow them to evade objections 
from the Senate minority. 
Their idea is to provide financial in-
centives for States to adopt Demo-
crats’ preferred election standards. I 
suspect it is an abuse of Senate budget 
rules that will hopefully not make it 
through the legislative process. But it 
is another disturbing sign of how com-
mitted 
Democrats 
are 
to 
shoving 
through their partisan election meas-
ure. 
For the sake of our democracy, let’s 
hope that they will continue to be un-
successful. 
While I am mentioning free speech 
and troubling narratives coming from 
the White House, I want to mention 
the White House Press Secretary’s 
comments last week. 
The Press Secretary noted that the 
Biden administration is ‘‘flagging prob-
lematic posts for Facebook that spread 
disinformation’’ and later stated that 
if individuals are banned on one social 
media platform, they should be banned 
on all platforms. Wow. 
Now, there is no question that pri-
vate companies have the right to mod-
erate activity and content on their 
platforms—although, for the sake of 
the free exchange of ideas and a culture 
of freedom of speech, they should be 
very transparent, principled, and ac-
countable about doing so. 
We all remember the backpedaling 
that recently occurred when media and 
social media realized that they might 
have too hastily censored the theory 
that the coronavirus originated in a 
Wuhan lab. 
But while private companies have a 
right to police information on their 
sites, the government cannot be in the 
middle of colluding with social media 
platforms to censor Americans’ speech. 
And the Biden administration has no 
business telling Facebook or Twitter 
whom they should ban from their plat-
forms. 
We condemn governments in other 
countries, like the Chinese Communist 
Party, that do exactly this. We con-
demned the Cuban Government just 
last week for shutting down their popu-
lation’s access to the internet in the 
face of widespread protests. 
If the government gets into censoring 
disinformation on social media, as 
compared to, say, terrorist propaganda, 
where does it end? 
As 
we 
are 
rapidly 
finding 
out, 
‘‘disinformation’’ tends to mean what-
ever those with censorship power want 
it to mean. 
Is the Biden administration going to 
start pushing social media companies 
to censor anything that contradicts its 
narrative on the supposed voting rights 
crisis? Is it going to suggest that any-
one defending States’ election laws is 
spreading misinformation? 
The best way to counter misinforma-
tion about lifesaving vaccines is not 
censorship; it is broadly sharing more 
persuasive and more accurate informa-
tion. 
The White House Press Secretary’s 
casual admission of a Presidential ad-
ministration 
actively 
monitoring 
Americans and colluding with social 
media companies to censor information 
is deeply troubling, and I am concerned 
that the Biden administration is mov-
ing us down the road toward govern-
ment control of Americans’ speech. 
I would like to see the White House 
worrying about its own campaign of 
disinformation on State voting laws. 
That would be a better use of its time 
than trampling on freedom of speech 
by censoring Americans’ activities on 
social media. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yester-
day, the majority leader teed up the 
first procedural vote on an infrastruc-
ture bill that no one has seen yet. 
Our colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle have been hard at work for weeks 
negotiating in good faith to get a bal-
anced agreement on an issue that vir-
tually everyone supports. Infrastruc-
ture is not a partisan issue. 
But at this time, we have no details 
about how this deal would achieve our 
common goals. There is no bill text. We 
don’t know what is in and what is out, 
no information about how it will be 
paid for and no score from the Congres-
sional Budget Office to tell us whether 
the proposed pay-fors are credible. 
Now, we have been through an ex-
traordinary pandemic, during which we 
have done some pretty extraordinary 
things when it comes to spending at 
the Federal level. 
I think the closest equivalent to the 
pandemic is World War II. Of course, 
this was a domestic war or battle 
against the virus, trying to deal with 
the public health consequences and the 
economic consequences as well. 
I voted for trillions of dollars of Fed-
eral 
spending, 
something 
I 
never 
thought I would do in the face of an 
emergency, a global emergency. 
But there is no emergency that exists 
for an infrastructure bill. This is part 
of the bread and butter of what govern-
ments do at the local level, the State 
level, and at the Federal level, and it is 
simply irresponsible and reckless to 
borrow more money from future gen-
erations and to throw gasoline on the 
fire that is already burning when it 
comes to inflation in pursuit of a bill

that everybody will probably, ulti-
mately, if given enough and oppor-
tunity, will ultimately come up with a 
negotiated bipartisan outcome. 
I also am not going to vote to pro-
ceed to a bill that my constituents, the 
29 million people I represent—they 
don’t know what is in the bill either. 
Well, all this doesn’t sound like a 
recipe for success. These are the types 
of things that typically would be 
ironed out before you bring a bill to 
the floor. It is obvious this legislation 
is not ready for prime time, not even 
close. 
As I said, the specifics of the bill are 
still being negotiated by our col-
leagues, of course, with the White 
House. We are days away from having 
the opportunity to read a bill, let alone 
provide the Congressional Budget Of-
fice the opportunity to calculate the 
cost. 
Republicans and Democrats may dis-
agree on a lot these days, but I hope we 
could all agree that it is not wise to ad-
vance legislation before you know what 
is in it. 
That is why it is so baffling to me 
that the majority leader, the Senator 
from New York, is forcing a vote on 
this bill before it is even ready. 
Of course, that raises a very signifi-
cant question. Why in the world would 
he do that? Why is he rushing through 
with the final stage of what has been a 
productive bipartisan process? 
The only logical conclusion I can 
come up with is he wants this bill and 
this bipartisan effort to fail. 
Why else would he push forward with 
a vote when he knows it is doomed 
from the start? 
I believe the Senator from New York 
wants this vote to fail because he real-
ly wants to go the partisan route; 
namely, the big, ugly, multitrillion 
dollar spending spree that BERNIE 
SANDERS and others have been advo-
cating. 
He doesn’t need Republican votes to 
do that, and he can implement some of 
the most radical policies on the far 
left’s wish list, things like the Green 
New Deal, massive tax hikes, crippling 
new economic regulations. 
It is pretty obvious that has been the 
goal all along. Why else would the 
President himself say, once he nego-
tiated a bipartisan deal: Well, I am not 
going to sign this bipartisan deal until 
we pass our partisan wish list. There is 
now $3 trillion proposed. It is for the 
same reason NANCY PELOSI said she is 
not going to let the bipartisan bill, 
even were we to pass it, see the light of 
day until she knows that the $3 trillion 
tax-and-spending spree is successful, 
which will require all 50 Democratic 
Senators plus the Vice President. 
It is just strange to me to see a de-
signed-to-fail strategy, unless it is for 
some political purpose. 
So, Senator SCHUMER, if you are lis-
tening, please don’t do it. Call off the 
vote. Let the bipartisan group finish 
their work. Don’t set up a vote that 
will fail just because you want to ap-
pease the far left of your party, be-
cause if the vote happens and we don’t 
have bill text or a cost estimate by the 
time it rolls around, it will necessarily 
fail. 
VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT 
Mr. President, on another matter, for 
more than four decades, the Crime Vic-
tims Fund has provided critical fund-
ing for survivors, victims, and their 
families. In Texas and across the coun-
try, this funding provides lifesaving 
support and services for survivors. It 
supports shelters that provide refuge to 
victims of domestic violence. It enables 
critical programming at rape crisis 
centers and legal services at child ad-
vocacy centers. It provides direct com-
pensation for victims and their fami-
lies in the wake of serious trauma. 
I could go on and on naming the 
countless ways that the Crime Victims 
Fund supports vital services in our 
communities, but one of the most re-
markable aspects about the Crime Vic-
tims Fund is that none of it comes 
from taxpayers. It is all covered by 
criminal fines and penalties. 
The only downside of this funding 
stream is that it comes with a fair 
amount of uncertainty. There is no 
guaranteed amount that will be depos-
ited into the fund each year, and recent 
years have brought far less money than 
is needed by the demand. 
In fiscal year 2020, for example, the 
funding disbursement decreased by 25 
percent, and crime victims service or-
ganizations have been told to expect 
even more cuts. We can’t let that hap-
pen. It is time to address these short-
falls in the Crime Victims Fund and 
safeguard critical resources for victims 
and survivors. 
I have been proud to work on a bipar-
tisan basis with Senators GRAHAM, 
DURBIN, and a long list of colleagues to 
restore this critical funding through 
the VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime 
Victims Fund Act. This legislation 
brings critical new funding sources to 
the Crime Victims Fund without ask-
ing the American taxpayer to do more. 
It makes important changes to the 
Crime Victims Act which will send 
more money to the States for crime 
victim compensation programs and 
gives States more flexibility to spend 
the money when and where needed. 
As I said, this legislation has broad 
bipartisan support. More than 60 Sen-
ators have cosponsored the bill, and it 
has been endorsed by 1,700 organiza-
tions, including 120 in Texas alone. 
These absolutely outstanding organiza-
tions and law enforcement stand be-
hind the crucial commonsense reforms 
of the VOCA Fix Act and have called 
on Congress to pass the bill. So I hope 
we can deliver soon. 
This afternoon, I expect the Senate 
to vote on the VOCA Fix Act to protect 
the solvency of this vital funding. The 
Crime Victims Fund brings justice to 
survivors, victims, and families in the 
wake of serious trauma. This legisla-
tion will protect the solvency and lon-
gevity of that fund and reverse the dev-
astating funding cuts we have seen in 
recent years. 
I hope we can send this legislation to 
the President’s desk as soon as possible 
so critical programs across the country 
can continue to serve our communities. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I come to the floor to discuss an 
issue that I have raised during the 
course of multiple Republican and 
Democrat administrations. This is a 
problem that crosses political bound-
aries, whether you have a Republican 
or Democrat President. That issue is 
responding to legitimate and valid con-
gressional oversight requests. 
In my time as a public servant, I 
have seen my fair share of unrespon-
sive government, sometimes downright 
obstructive government. I have seen it 
rear its ugly head from decade to dec-
ade. There is nothing more eroding to 
public faith than an unresponsive exec-
utive branch that believes that it only 
answers to the President and not to the 
U.S Congress and perhaps, most impor-
tantly, we the people. 
Based on my interactions with the 
Biden administration’s Justice Depart-
ment and its component Agencies—spe-
cifically, the FBI—the current officials 
in charge of those Agencies are, at 
best, 
unresponsive 
public 
servants. 
That goes all the way to the top, to the 
President, because the buck stops 
there. 
As I say to many nominees, either 
you are going to run your Department 
or the Department runs you. Right 
now, it looks like the Justice Depart-
ment is running the Attorney Gen-
eral’s office, and that is a great big 
shame. 
I voted to confirm the Attorney Gen-
eral. I had high hopes he would follow 
through on his public statements of 
ridding the Department of political in-
fection. Instead, I fear he has taken the 
Justice Department to new politically 
charged heights. 
To date, I haven’t received a full or 
complete response to a single oversight 
request from the Justice Department. 
As one example, on February 3 of this 
year and March 9 of this year, Senator 
JOHNSON and I asked the Department 
about Nicholas McQuaid. Mr. McQuaid 
is the Acting Assistant Attorney Gen-
eral for the Criminal Division, of which 
Mr. Polite will be taking his place upon 
confirmation. 
McQuaid was employed by a law firm 
until January 20 of this year and 
worked with Christopher Clark, whom 
Hunter Biden reportedly hired to work 
on his Federal criminal case.

July 20, 2021 
This arrangement poses a clear po-
tential conflict. 
A core function of congressional 
oversight is to ensure that govern-
mental Departments and Agencies are 
free of conflicts of interest. That is es-
pecially so with the Justice Depart-
ment and the FBI. If conflict infects 
them, those investigations and pros-
ecutions, the very purpose of the De-
partment’s existence, could be under-
mined. 
So I have requested a recusal memo 
for McQuaid. I have also requested to 
know, as a threshold issue, whether 
one even exists. Attorney General Gar-
land won’t answer. 
Now, can you believe that? Here we 
have a Federal criminal case that im-
plicates the President’s son, and the 
Attorney General won’t even answer 
Congress as to whether or not an em-
ployee of his Department who has an 
apparent conflict is recused from that 
matter? 
It certainly looks like the Garland 
Justice Department is doing all that it 
can to protect the President’s son. 
Let me remind the Attorney General 
that I was the one who led a tran-
scribed 
interview 
with 
President 
Trump’s son. For all of the grief that 
Trump and his family got from the 
Democrats, at least that family showed 
up and answered the questions of le-
gitimate congressional oversight. 
Early on in the Attorney General’s 
tenure, I instructed my oversight staff 
to work diligently and, of course, in 
good faith with their counterparts at 
the Justice Department. My staff have 
done the phone calls. They have had 
the meetings. They have sent emails, 
many of which go unanswered. My staff 
has done this all in good faith. 
At my level, I have made every effort 
to get the Attorney General on the 
phone to discuss my oversight re-
quests. It took him 2 months to get on 
the phone with me for a one-on-one 
call. I found out just the other week 
that Attorney General Garland’s staff 
never told him of my request to speak 
with him. This omission is a derelic-
tion of duty by the Department staff, 
to keep something like that from the 
Attorney General. Like I said, either 
you run the Department, or the De-
partment runs you. 
This type of unresponsive conduct 
has consequences. These consequences 
might not be immediate, but eventu-
ally, as I have seen over the years, ulti-
mately the consequences arrive. The 
more their government tries to hide 
from them, the more the American 
people lose faith in government insti-
tutions. With such bad government 
conduct, I don’t blame the people for 
losing faith. The fault is with the gov-
ernment, not the American people. 
After all, we work for the American 
people; they don’t work for us. It is sad 
to say, but many in Washington, DC, 
don’t understand that very funda-
mental precept of our constitutional 
Republic. 
My fellow Senators, this type of con-
duct from the Biden administration 
and the Justice Department is unac-
ceptable. But it isn’t just this adminis-
tration or this Justice Department; it 
is something I have seen too long under 
both Republican and Democratic Presi-
dents, and it will have long-term con-
sequences for the integrity of our gov-
ernmental institutions. 
In light of the Department’s con-
sistent failure to respond to my over-
sight requests, I will object to any 
unanimous consent request that Ken-
neth Polite be confirmed as Assistant 
Attorney General for the Criminal Di-
vision. I do not do so on the basis of his 
credentials, which I don’t question; I 
do it as a message to the Attorney 
General that he needs to improve 
DOJ’s interaction with the Congress. 
VICTIMS OF CRIME ACT 
Mr. President, on another matter, we 
will soon be voting on the Victims of 
Crime Act. I was an original cosponsor 
of that act when the Senate Judiciary 
Committee developed the legislation 
years ago. I appreciate the opportunity 
to work with Senators DURBIN, GRA-
HAM, and other Judiciary Committee 
colleagues this year on amendments to 
this landmark law. 
The principle behind this statute is 
very simple. It is that fines and pen-
alties collected by the Department of 
Justice from those who are convicted 
of committing Federal crimes should 
be used to help those who are victims 
of the crimes. 
Because the fund relies solely upon 
fines and other assessments paid by 
Federal criminals, not from the tax-
payers, it does not add to the deficit. 
So any of these expenditures are very 
fiscally responsible. 
The money in this fund helps at least 
6,800 local organizations, examples like 
rape crisis centers and child advocacy 
centers. So this money provides needed 
services to millions of crime victims 
across the country each year. The fund 
supports crisis hotline counseling or 
medical care or other services to these 
crime survivors, but it also does things 
like providing lost wages, courtroom 
advocacy, 
temporary 
housing, 
and 
there are a lot of other services that 
come from this money. 
Since its enactment, billions of dol-
lars have flowed through the Crime 
Victims Fund to our States and our 
communities to help support victim as-
sistance programs. More than three 
decades after its inception, the fund is 
still working, but deposits into the 
fund have declined significantly in re-
cent years. So obviously the continu-
ation of some of these programs is less 
effective or even in doubt when the 
money available for them is not cer-
tain to be there. This is an issue of why 
this bill is before us, the VOCA Fix 
Act. This bill would resolve this prob-
lem of not enough money going into 
the fund. 
Why is the money not going into the 
fund? The issue stems from Federal 
prosecutors’ increasing reliance upon 
no- or deferred-prosecution agreements 
rather 
than 
upon 
conviction. 
The 
money collected by the Department of 
Justice in these settlement agree-
ments, then, is not attributed to the 
Crime Victims Fund the same way as if 
it had gone through the court process 
and people had been convicted. 
Among other provisions, the bill 
makes a deposits fix to preserve the 
Crime Victims Fund; in other words, to 
overcome the fact that these no- or de-
ferred-prosecution 
agreements—that 
money doesn’t now go into those funds. 
It requires that the money from the 
no- or deferred-prosecution agreements 
must go into the fund rather than the 
General Fund. The bill also changes 
the match requirements for State and 
local grant programs that rely on this 
statute. 
Providing this fix will enable crime 
survivors in my State of Iowa and 
across the Nation to continue to have 
these services available in their com-
munities. I encourage my colleagues to 
support the legislation. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. President, the last point I want 
to make is a very short one. 
According to the nonpartisan Con-
gressional Research Service, the defini-
tion of ‘‘filibustering’’ is this: ‘‘Filibus-
tering includes any use of dilatory or 
obstructive tactics to block a measure 
by preventing it from coming to a 
vote.’’ 
Now, this is exactly what Texas 
Democrats are doing by fleeing their 
State to avoid a majority vote on an 
election reform bill. This group of 
Texas legislators flew to Washington, 
DC, where they are hypocritically de-
manding that the Senate abolish its 
tradition of extended debate so na-
tional legislation can be passed on the 
slimmest of majorities. And you can’t 
get any slimmer than a 50–50 Senate. 
The Senate majority leader called 
these legislators brave and courageous 
for their dishonest filibuster in the 
Texas Legislature, while they denounce 
the filibuster at the national level. 
Texas is a very large and diverse 
State, but the United States is made 
up of 50 different States, plus terri-
tories, spread over a great distance. If 
the majority ought to not be allowed 
to rule in Texas, then how can they 
justify breaking the rules and tradi-
tions of the Senate to impose the will 
of 50 percent of the country on the 
other 50 percent? 
So let’s be very clear. As I have said 
before, the false, evidence-free claims 
of widespread voter suppression are as 
damaging as false claims of widespread 
voter fraud and thus need to stop. The 
reality is that each State is different, 
so it makes sense that States will have 
different voting processes. 
Discrimination in voting is illegal. It 
is a Federal crime, and thank God it is 
a Federal crime. Beyond that, diversity 
in our Nation is a strength, not a weak-
ness. 
I yield the floor.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
VOCA FIX TO SUSTAIN THE CRIME 
VICTIMS FUND ACT OF 2021 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate re-
sume legislative session and the Senate 
begin consideration of H.R. 1652, under 
the previous order. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 1652) to deposit certain funds 
into the Crime Victims Fund, to waive 
matching requirements, and for other pur-
poses. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2121, AS MODIFIED 
Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Toomey amendment be 
called up, as modified with the changes 
at the desk, and that it be reported by 
number. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, the clerk will report the 
amendment by number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Illinois [Mr. DURBIN], for 
Mr. TOOMEY, proposes an amendment num-
bered 2121, as modified. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To ensure adequate funding in the 
Crime Victims Fund is disbursed to vic-
tims, their families, and their advocates 
each year) 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. ll. POINT OF ORDER. 
Section 1402 of the Victims of Crime Act of 
1984 (34 U.S.C. 20101) is amended by striking 
subsection (c) and inserting the following: 
‘‘(c)(1) Sums deposited in the Fund shall 
remain in the Fund and be available for ex-
penditure under this chapter for grants 
under this chapter without fiscal year limi-
tation, in accordance with paragraph (2). 
Notwithstanding subsection (d)(5), all sums 
deposited in the Fund in any fiscal year that 
are not made available for obligation by 
Congress in the subsequent fiscal year shall 
remain in the Fund for obligation in future 
fiscal years, without fiscal year limitation. 
‘‘(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph 
(C), it shall not be in order in the Senate or 
the House of Representatives to consider a 
provision in a bill or joint resolution making 
appropriations for all or a portion of a fiscal 
year, or an amendment thereto, amendment 
between the Houses in relation thereto, con-
ference report thereon, or motion thereon, 
that would cause the amount of annual 
disbursals from the Fund to be below the an-
nual average amount that was deposited into 
the Fund during the 3-fiscal-year period be-
ginning on October 1 of the fourth fiscal year 
before the fiscal year to which the disbursal 
level applies. 
‘‘(B) If a point of order is raised by a Mem-
ber under subparagraph (A), and the point of 
order is sustained by the Chair, the provision 
shall be stricken from the measure and may 
not be offered as an amendment from the 
floor. 
‘‘(C) A point of order shall not lie in the 
Senate or the House of Representatives 
under this paragraph if the difference be-
tween the amount in the Fund as of Sep-
tember 30 of the fiscal year immediately pre-
ceding the fiscal year to which the annual 
disbursals described in subparagraph (A) re-
lates and the amount available for obligation 
through the annual disbursals described in 
subparagraph 
(A) 
is 
not 
more 
than 
$2,000,000,000. 
‘‘(3) Paragraph (2) may be waived or sus-
pended in the Senate only by the affirmative 
vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly 
chosen and sworn. An affirmative vote of 
three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and 
sworn, shall be required in the Senate to sus-
tain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on 
a point of order raised under paragraph (2). 
‘‘(4) This subsection is enacted by Con-
gress— 
‘‘(A) as an exercise of the rulemaking 
power of the House of Representatives and 
the Senate, respectively, and as such it is 
deemed a part of the rules of each House, re-
spectively, but applicable only with respect 
to the procedure to be followed in that House 
in the case of a joint resolution, and it super-
sedes other rules only to the extent that it is 
inconsistent with those rules; and 
‘‘(B) with full recognition of the constitu-
tional right of either House to change the 
rules (so far as relating to the procedure of 
that House) at any time, in the same manner 
and to the same extent as in the case of any 
other rule of that House.’’. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that at 5:15 today 
the Senate vote on the Toomey amend-
ment and on the passage of the bill, as 
amended, if amended, as provided for 
under the previous order. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Montana. 
NOMINATION OF TRACY STONE-MANNING 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today, I 
rise to bring attention to new revela-
tions about President Biden’s nominee 
to head the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, Tracy Stone-Manning’s involve-
ment in a tree-spiking incident in 
Idaho, and to share why I oppose her 
confirmation. 
I would have welcomed having a 
nominee with such strong ties to Mon-
tana to be the Director of the Bureau 
of Land Management, and, until re-
cently, I believed, as did most Mon-
tanans, based on her testimony before 
the Montana State Legislature, back in 
2013, that her role in the tree-spiking 
crime was minimal, her actions were 
helpful, and she helped bring criminals 
to justice. 
Unfortunately, new information has 
revealed that this simply was not the 
case. In fact, rather than bringing 
criminals to justice, Ms. Stone-Man-
ning assisted in helping them evade 
justice for years—for years. 
I am going to lay this out because I 
think it is important that the facts are 
shared before this body. First, it re-
veals that she withheld the truth from 
investigators for several years. Second, 
it reveals that she harshly criticized 
Federal law enforcement at the very 
same time she was refusing to tell 
them the truth. And, third, it reveals 
that she has not taken responsibility 
or expressed remorse for not speaking 
the truth much, much sooner. 
I know many of my colleagues are 
probably just tuning into Ms. Stone- 
Manning’s involvement in a tree-spik-
ing crime committed in 1989 while she 
was a member of an ecoterrorist group 
called Earth First! 
The picture that she and her advo-
cates have painted about her involve-
ment in this crime is that she was the 
innocent hero who helped put bad peo-
ple in jail. Well, in recent weeks, we 
have learned there is a lot more to this 
story. It is very alarming. It is very 
disturbing on many levels. 
Ms. Stone-Manning stated to the 
Montana State Legislature that a rath-
er frightening man approached her 
with a letter while she was on campus. 
Come to find out, that man wasn’t a 
stranger. It was her roommate and 
someone whom she described to the 
court during the 1993 trial as someone 
who was in her main circle of friends. 
Ms. Stone-Manning stated that she 
simply mailed the anonymous letter— 
that she simply mailed it. But in re-
ality, and as we have since found out 
and as we have explored court records 
in Idaho, this information had not 
come out, except in the last 45 days. 
The investigation later revealed that 
this letter had not only been collabo-
ratively composed, but after waiting 
for a few days, it was typed by Ms. 
Stone-Manning on a rented typewriter, 
which, according to her very own testi-
mony, was because she wanted to avoid 
having it on her own computer and 
avoid having any fingerprints that 
could be traced back to her. 
The words that Ms. Stone-Manning 
typed and mailed are explicit. It is not 
what you type and send to protect peo-
ple. They are what you say to frighten 
people. 
I am going to read this letter—it is 
not very long—that Ms. Stone-Manning 
typed on a rented typewriter and per-
sonally mailed. It says: 
To Whom It May Concern: 
This letter is being sent to notify you that 
the Post Office Sale— 
If I can add, the Post Office Sale was 
a timber sale. They labeled it the 
‘‘Post Office Sale.’’— 
in Idaho has been spiked heavily. 
The reasoning for this action is that this 
piece of land is very special to the earth. It 
is home to the Elk, Deer, Mountain Lions, 
Birds, and especially the Trees. 
The project required that eleven of us 
spend nine days in God awful weather condi-
tions spiking trees. We unloaded a total of 
five hundred pounds of spikes measuring 8 to 
10 inches in length. The sales were marked so 
that no workers will be injured and so that 
you assholes know that they are spiked. The 
majority of trees were spiked within the first 
ten feet, but many, many others were spiked 
as high as a hundred and fifty feet. 
I would be more than willing to pay you a 
dollar for the sale, but you would have to 
find me first and that could be your WORST 
nightmare. 
Sincerely, George Hayduke 
P.S. You bastards go in there anyway and 
a lot of people could get hurt. 
The text of that letter was never 
made public until very recently, just in 
the last 45 days. Montanans never had 
the opportunity to read what Ms. 
Stone-Manning typed on the rented 
typewriter and sent until just a few 
weeks ago.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4963 
July 20, 2021 
The letter is chilling and it makes 
you think that, if Ms. Stone-Manning 
was really concerned about the tree 
spiking, she could have gone to the au-
thorities immediately in 1989, when 
this occurred. 
We also now know she had firsthand 
knowledge about the perpetrators. She 
knew who did it. She knew all of the 
details about the crime. She knew who 
spiked the trees. 
By the way, why do you spike trees? 
Why do you put these great big spikes 
in the trees? That is because, if a 
logger comes in with a saw and their 
blade hits it, they could be severely in-
jured. If one of these logs comes 
through a sawmill, the sawmill oper-
ator can be severely injured, as has ac-
tually happened. We have had some se-
verely injured individuals because of 
the 
tree 
spiking. 
This 
was 
the 
ecoterrorism going on several years 
ago. 
But she withheld this information 
from law enforcement in 1989, even 
after she was subpoenaed by a grand 
jury for her hair, her handwriting, and 
fingerprint samples. She didn’t report 
it to law enforcement in 1990, not in 
1991, not in 1992. In fact, she condemned 
the FBI for investigating her in the 
first place, despite the fact that she 
knew all the details of the crime. In 
fact, she claimed being investigated by 
the FBI was ‘‘degrading’’ and that the 
‘‘government does do bad things.’’ She 
compared her treatment to how the 
Government of Panama would treat 
someone. 
Ms. Stone-Manning said all of these 
things and played the victim, despite 
knowing all the details and players of 
the crime, despite having had the op-
portunity for 4 years to put bad people 
behind bars. What Ms. Stone-Manning 
did was actively obstruct an investiga-
tion. 
At no time, by the way, did Ms. 
Stone-Manning 
ever 
come 
forward 
from her own volition. Now, she only 
came forward after there was a break 
in the investigation. This is now in 
1993, after another suspect identified 
her involvement and after her attorney 
struck an immunity deal, not before 
she was caught. 
In fact, one of the men she had the 
opportunity to put behind bars during 
the time she remained silent went on 
to commit an act of—this man that she 
remained silent on went on to commit 
an act of domestic violence. Her co-
operation with law enforcement could 
have prevented this. 
None of her actions show any kind of 
remorse. They didn’t then and they 
still don’t now. Ms. Stone-Manning has 
not expressed regret for her false and 
disparaging characterization of Federal 
investigators. 
This deception and misrepresentation 
of her involvement, coupled with her 
clear violation of Senate Ethics rules 
while she served as a U.S. Senate staff-
er, leave the public with no reason to 
trust her judgment, her leadership ca-
pabilities, or her ability to remain 
pragmatic when making decisions on 
behalf of the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment. 
Ms. Stone-Manning has lost her 
credibility, and to move forward with 
her nomination would cause more con-
troversy and distrust for the leadership 
at the Bureau of Land Management, 
the U.S. Senate, and the Biden admin-
istration. 
You see, there are 10,000 employees at 
the Bureau of Land Management who 
report to the Director and they need to 
have that trust, as well. 
President Obama’s former Director of 
the Bureau of Land Management, Bob 
Abbey, 
has 
concluded 
that 
Stone- 
Manning’s ‘‘questionable past’’ brings 
what he said ‘‘needless controversy’’ to 
the Agency. Obama’s very own Direc-
tor of the Bureau of Land Management 
said that her involvement in the tree- 
spiking crime should disqualify Stone- 
Manning and the Biden administration 
needs a new nominee. 
I agree with Mr. Abbey because, in 
Montana and the West and all America, 
we need a Director of the Bureau of 
Land Management who can garner pub-
lic trust, bring folks together, and lead 
with integrity. 
Throughout the confirmation proc-
ess, I have given Ms. Stone-Manning a 
fair shake, an opportunity to answer 
questions 
about 
important 
policies 
that impact our Montana way of life. 
However, over the course of the last 
few weeks, this new information has 
come to light and has led me to now 
actively and publicly oppose her nomi-
nation. 
The controversy surrounding this 
nomination is not and should not be 
about party-line politics. Montanans 
care about trusting those in public 
service, about integrity. The public 
trust surrounding Ms. Stone-Manning 
has been wrecked. Her ability to be the 
Director that the Bureau of Land Man-
agement needs has been compromised 
beyond repair. 
As this nomination draws more at-
tention and some continue to contend 
that her actions were commendable, I 
hope all my colleagues will give full 
consideration to the facts laid out here 
today. I urge my colleagues, especially 
those who represent western States, to 
join me opposing this nomination. I 
would urge the Biden administration to 
pull Ms. Stone-Manning’s nomination. 
Nominate someone to lead the Agency 
who can garner the public trust and 
one who can lead the Agency without 
the significant controversy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
CRIME VICTIMS FUND ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when 
the pandemic began last year, Ameri-
cans across the country were faced 
with more than one public health cri-
sis. While we all feared contracting 
COVID–19 outside of our homes, the 
most vulnerable members of our com-
munity feared a danger lurking within 
the home or, certainly, in the neigh-
borhood—violent crime. 
During the first several weeks of the 
pandemic, police departments across 
America reported a significant increase 
in arrests or calls related to domestic 
violence. And reports of hate incidents 
and crimes increased, as well, particu-
larly those targeting Asian American 
and Pacific Islander, or what is known 
as the AAPI community. 
Nearly 4,000 of these hate incidents 
were reported during the first year of 
the COVID–19 pandemic. AAPI women 
comprised the majority of the victims. 
In my home State of Illinois, some of 
these victims of violent crimes have an 
indispensable resource they can turn 
to. It is known as KAN-WIN, a non-
profit that supports survivors of vio-
lence, particularly women and mem-
bers of the immigrant community. 
KAN-WIN offers a 24-hour hotline, legal 
advocacy, transitional housing, sexual 
assault services, and many more re-
sources to survivors of violent crimes. 
They also offer programming to sup-
port children who have grown up in a 
traumatic environment. 
During the pandemic, organizations 
like KAN-WIN have been a beacon of 
hope for some of the most vulnerable 
members of our community. But these 
beacons of hope are at the risk of grow-
ing dark, unless we in this Senate 
today take immediate action by pass-
ing the VOCA Fix to Sustain the Crime 
Victims Fund Act. This legislation, 
which I am proud to have introduced 
with Republican Senator LINDSEY GRA-
HAM, will replenish the Crime Victims 
Fund, which Congress established in 
1984 with the passage of the Victims of 
Crime Act, known as VOCA. 
The 
Crime 
Victims 
Fund 
helps 
abused children, survivors of domestic 
violence, and other victims of violent 
crime access the professional services 
they desperately need. It also assists 
victims with expenses like medical 
bills, counseling, funeral costs, loss of 
wages. And, importantly, the Crime 
Victims Fund supplies grants to thou-
sands, literally thousands of victim 
service providers across the Nation, 
like KAN-WIN. 
In KAN-WIN’s case, the Crime Vic-
tims Fund pays for the salary of their 
Children’s Advocate. That advocate 
reached out to my office and wrote the 
following: ‘‘The entire Children’s Pro-
gram at KAN-WIN will have to be 
eliminated’’ if the VOCA Fix to sustain 
the Crime Victims Fund does not pass 
the Senate. Without this legislation, 
‘‘linguistically and culturally sensitive 
services and counseling, education as-
sistance, economic assistance, medical 
assistance, art activities that help reg-
ulate children’s emotions, parent-child 
relationship assistance, and other case 
management services’’ will be cut. 
The kids who receive help from KAN- 
WIN are far from the only people who 
would be hurt if the Crime Victims 
Fund runs dry. Children’s Advocacy 
Centers in Illinois report that a signifi-
cant cut in VOCA funding would result 
in more than 1,500 children being de-
prived of services they need to over-
come trauma.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4964 
July 20, 2021 
The Chicago Children’s Advocacy 
Center writes: ‘‘One of the most impor-
tant uses of VOCA funds is for mental 
health therapy for sexually abused 
children.’’ Without that funding, they 
will have to ‘‘cut the number of chil-
dren we provide therapy to and more 
children would go without life-chang-
ing treatment to heal from their abuse. 
Even a small cut in VOCA would mean 
up to 100 children would go without 
healing services.’’ 
We have a serious problem across 
America—and I have seen in Illinois, 
particularly in the city of Chicago—of 
gun violence. There are so many guns. 
The city is awash in guns. Too many 
young people get their hands on them 
every day. 
The Fourth of July weekend, 104 peo-
ple were shot in the city of Chicago. 
104; 19 died. Last weekend, 50. The 
numbers are staggering. We have a 
mass shooting in the city of Chicago 
every weekend. It has become, sadly, 
expected. It breaks your heart. 
I went to the juvenile facility of 
Cook County several years ago and 
talked to the counselors who are meet-
ing with the adolescents who have been 
charged in these gun crimes. Some of 
these adolescents spend a year or two 
in that facility waiting for trial. I 
asked these counselors: Who are these 
kids? What has happened to them to 
the point where they can take a gun 
and just shoot wantonly into a crowd, 
killing infants and children and grand-
mothers and innocent people? 
The counselor said to me: There are 
many things. There are hardly any se-
rious mental illnesses that you can 
think of that we don’t find in these 
kids. But the one thing we find, Sen-
ator, consistently is they are the vic-
tims of trauma. 
Now, by classic definition, trauma is 
some 
physical 
injury, 
but 
trauma 
today is viewed in a much larger con-
text. It goes back to a template that 
was established by Kaiser Permanente 
and the CDC called adverse childhood 
experiences—ACEs for short. Most psy-
chologists and child counselors know 
exactly what I am talking about. 
ACEs, these adverse childhood expe-
riences, can be as simple as witnessing 
a violent crime or returning to a home 
where the parent is not a positive 
force—perhaps the only parent is drug- 
addicted or an alcoholic or not home at 
all—or having a situation in which you 
are never sure where home is. So many 
kids in school talk about moving back 
and forth from one relative to another. 
All of these things take their toll on 
little kids. It is part of the traumatic 
experience. 
These counselors of these gun-toting 
adolescents at the Cook County facil-
ity say that over 90 percent of them are 
victims of trauma. Stop and think: Is 
it possible that that simple thing that 
happened in a child’s life could have 
that kind of impact? Well, I am afraid 
it is. For many of us, just to think 
back on your childhood, of the most 
memorable moment in your child-
hood—I hope it is a good memory, one 
that you smile with, but it could be a 
terrible memory, too, the loss of some-
one you love or some other tragic 
event. Well, that is what has happened 
to these kids. This trauma in their 
lives runs the risk of changing them 
and even making them potentially dan-
gerous to the innocent people they live 
around. 
That is why, when we talk about the 
Victims of Crime Act and giving these 
kids counseling, a child who witnesses 
a domestic violence incident in the 
home, where their mother is being 
beaten or worse, how in the world do 
you erase that from your memory? You 
only hope that you can find someone— 
some mentor, some counselor—who can 
talk you through it. That is what the 
VOCA does. The victims of crime have 
an opportunity to access those profes-
sional services before they do the dam-
age that they do. 
So how did we get to this point where 
we are even debating whether to fund 
this? Why is the Crime Victims Fund 
so dangerously close to running out of 
money when we know we need it so 
much? 
It comes down to how the fund is 
funded. See, the money for the victims 
of crime doesn’t come from taxpayer 
dollars. Traditionally, it comes from 
criminal fines, penalties, forfeited bail 
bonds, and special assessments col-
lected by the Federal Government. His-
torically, these criminal fines have ac-
counted for the largest portion of the 
funding, but in recent years, deposits 
in the Crime Victims Fund have 
dropped significantly as the Justice 
Department has increasingly used de-
ferred prosecution and nonprosecution 
agreements. Monetary penalties from 
these deferred prosecutions and non-
prosecution agreements are currently 
deposited into the General Treasury, 
not into the Crime Victims Fund. As a 
result, the shift in sentencing has re-
sulted in a devastating impact on the 
fund. 
That is why the bipartisan, bi-
cameral coalition of lawmakers has 
worked with advocacy organizations to 
write a fix to the VOCA law to sustain 
the Crime Victims Fund. Our bill 
would stabilize the Crime Victims 
Fund by redirecting monetary pen-
alties from deferred prosecutions and 
nonprosecution agreements to the vic-
tims and service providers that des-
perately need the financial support. 
If you think that is an easy and obvi-
ous fix, you don’t understand Congress. 
To have all of the different committees 
of jurisdiction take a look at it and all 
of the Members take a look at it and to 
come up with a solution, it doesn’t 
happen every day. One of the reasons it 
happened here in the Senate is that one 
of my colleagues, whom I want to put 
in the RECORD
as a major positive 
force, Senator TAMMY BALDWIN of the 
State of Wisconsin. She took a real 
personal interest in this, and I thank 
her for it. She brought us together and 
came up with a solution and worked 
out the details—and there were many— 
until we could all agree. I thank her 
personally and specifically during the 
course of this opening remark. 
The reduced deposits into the fund 
have had a devastating impact. She 
knew it. I knew it. Everyone does. As 
of this year, victim assistance grants 
have been reduced by more than $600 
million nationwide, and even more cat-
astrophic cuts are looming if we don’t 
fix it today. So far in 2021, this Crime 
Victims Fund has already missed out 
on nearly $550 million in deposits. We 
are not even halfway through the year. 
Imagine how much more money this 
fund is going to lose if we don’t pass 
this bill. 
There is no time to waste. Every day 
that goes by, we miss an opportunity 
to help replenish this fund. More im-
portantly, we miss an opportunity to 
help a crime victim. It may be a med-
ical bill. It could be a funeral cost. It 
could be counseling for that child 
whom I described earlier. Missing that 
opportunity may mean that the life of 
that child will never quite be the same. 
The Senate must immediately pass 
this bill. The House already did it in 
March—in March. It is time for us to 
get around to it. So, with broad bipar-
tisan support in the House, we should 
be inspired in the Senate by our bipar-
tisan coalition backing the bill. Sixty- 
three Senators—forty-two Dems, twen-
ty-one Republicans—not bad. We have 
all come together for the VOCA fix. 
Over the past few months, an objec-
tion has prevented us from moving for-
ward on this legislation. We have been 
literally waiting for weeks to pass this 
bill. Today, we have a chance to do it 
and to send it to the President’s desk. 
That is why, this afternoon, we are 
going to take two votes. The first is on 
an amendment from Senator TOOMEY. 
It doesn’t address the substance of the 
programs that I mentioned; it address-
es the budget process. There is men-
tion, of course, in this bill, but his 
change would reach far beyond any sin-
gle piece of legislation. We will con-
sider it. I will be opposing it, and oth-
ers will get their chance to vote. Then 
we will face final passage on the House- 
passed bill. 
A broad coalition of victims’ rights 
advocates, service providers, and law 
enforcement organizations are urging 
the vote I just described against the 
Toomey amendment and for the final 
bill. They recently wrote to us, saying: 
‘‘The VOCA Fix Act is a narrowly tai-
lored, carefully negotiated, technical 
fix bill to address the immediate needs 
of survivors, and the Senate must act 
now to pass this critical legislation 
without any amendments. . . . Every 
delay 
allows 
potential 
funds 
that 
should be deposited into the Crime Vic-
tims Fund to serve victims to instead 
be deposited into the General Treasury. 
The House passed the VOCA Fix Act 
more than four months ago with over-
whelming bipartisan support; we urge 
the Senate to similarly pass the House- 
passed VOCA Fix Act, as is, imme-
diately.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4965 
July 20, 2021 
More than 1,700 national, regional, 
State, Tribal, and local organizations 
are begging us to do this and do it 
today so we can send it to the Presi-
dent and ensure that the victims are 
able to maintain access to the services 
they desperately need. We owe it to the 
victims to get this done. 
I see my colleague on the floor who is 
the cosponsor of this bill with me. He 
was the Senate Judiciary Committee’s 
chairman in the previous Congress, and 
I have that honor in this Congress. I 
am glad that we could get together, a 
Democrat and a Republican, again. We 
have cosponsored things before, and we 
will continue to. I want to thank Sen-
ator GRAHAM for his leadership and in 
joining on this effort. I think it is a 
good one, and we need more of them. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRAHAM. I thank Senator DUR-
BIN. 
Madam President, it has been a 
pleasure working with Senator DURBIN 
on this to, hopefully, get it over the 
line this afternoon. I think most Amer-
icans, if they understood what we were 
trying to do, would be enthusiastically 
behind the effort. 
As for the deferred prosecution and 
nonprosecution agreements, the reve-
nues from those procedures—for lack of 
a better word—go into the General 
Treasury, not the Crime Victims Fund, 
and we are fixing that. We have had a 
reduction in funds available in South 
Carolina. We have lost $3.2 million for 
VOCA crime victims funding for the 
South Carolina Network of Children’s 
Advocacy Centers’ 27 members. Be-
cause of this quirk in the law, the 
Crime Victims Fund is at a historic 
low, and it is affecting operations in 
the field. 
Attorney General Alan Wilson has 
been great to work with. With Senators 
FEINSTEIN and GRASSLEY, we have been 
a team on this on the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Senator DURBIN went through the ins 
and outs of what we are doing here. I 
just want to add this: This was not 
easy. There are a lot of stakeholders in 
this, and there are a lot of committees 
of jurisdiction. 
I want to thank Senator BALDWIN, 
who has been a driving force behind it. 
That is absolutely true. All of the com-
mittees could have easily said no, but 
this is one time we wanted to get to 
yes because the lack of funding is be-
ginning to affect the operations of 
groups that are just indispensable 
when it comes to providing relief to 
crime victims. 
I would urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. This has 
been a bipartisan process from day one. 
It has been going on about a year. It is 
now time to correct the quirk in the 
law to get these funds over to the 
Crime Victims Fund from the General 
Treasury. 
Senator TOOMEY’s amendment, I will 
oppose. I appreciate Senator TOOMEY 
very much, but I think that most of 
the groups and all of the law enforce-
ment 
groups 
are 
opposed 
to 
the 
Toomey amendment, and I will reluc-
tantly do so. 
I hope we can get a really big vote on 
final passage because we need to prove 
to the American people that we can do 
things together. There is nothing that 
should bring us together more than 
helping victims of crime and making 
sure this fund has the resources it de-
serves to provide the treatment needed. 
This rise in crime has made this more 
relevant, not less. 
As for Senator DURBIN, as always, I 
have enjoyed working with him, and we 
will continue to find common ground 
where we can. So I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on its final passage here in a couple of 
hours. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
The Senator from Indiana. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise 
today because, in a practical place like 
the State of Indiana, believe it or not, 
we actually balance our budget every 
year. We have commonsense things in 
place that if you are going to receive 
some benefits of some sort, maybe you 
do something where we can help to get 
you to where you do not need the bene-
fits. 
In this case, this is again something 
that was not broken and is now being 
fixed in a way that takes enterprising 
States like the State of Indiana, like 
Texas, like Arizona, places that wanted 
the ability in administering their share 
of Medicaid, to have ways to try to get 
folks into a position where they could 
get back on their feet, seek work, and 
do things that would make sense for 
trying to maybe earn their way into 
that benefit somewhat. 
Do we believe Washington has all the 
answers? I think that is what you be-
lieve when you get rid of something 
that was working in many places. 
I am in the camp that, as much as I 
know the Federal Government has to 
weigh in and do things, but if the argu-
ment is that we have been knocking it 
out of the park here, that we have been 
getting things done that really work, if 
it wasn’t done in the context that of 
every dollar we spend here, we borrow 
23 cents—and in the time I have been 
here, 2 and a half years, have been 
probably the loudest voice on trying to 
fix healthcare. 
Part of that issue is in my own party, 
where I think we are apologists for a 
broken healthcare industry. The other 
side of the aisle wants to just spend 
money to try to fix it without fixing 
the underlying issues that drive so 
many of the problems in this country, 
where we deal with them in a sustain-
able way in our State governments, in 
our local governments. If we take away 
that flexibility, then we are defaulting 
to a system that has not been solving 
the problems. 
Today, we are here specifically talk-
ing about the Medicaid Program. The 
way it works currently, the Federal 
Government pays for half the benefits, 
and the States pay for half the bene-
fits. The Social Security Act author-
izes a framework of flexibility so enter-
prising, innovative States can maybe 
do something to bring down the cost of 
these programs and wean us off the 
need for them primarily in the long 
run. 
Since President Biden has taken of-
fice, several State waivers that were 
previously approved under the Trump 
administration have been revoked. It 
has happened in Texas. It has happened 
in Arkansas. It has happened in Ari-
zona. And now they are coming after a 
place like Indiana that has a system 
that works so well that we are even in 
the process of giving some revenues 
back to our citizens this coming year, 
where revenues were so far above fore-
cast, we are still taking care of issues 
at the State level and doing what we 
ought to be considering: returning re-
sources to the taxpayer. 
This isn’t even that. This is trying to 
retain the flexibility where it has been 
working. It is called the Gateway to 
Work Program, and it is not like it is 
overbearing. It just requires 20 hours 
per month of work, job searching, 
school, or community service. It was 
designed in a way that engages the in-
dividual needing the benefit and that 
can improve their quality of life over 
the long run. 
It has had a long history. The pilot 
was first approved by CMS in 2007. It 
has been renewed as recently as 2018. 
Yet the Biden administration, right 
now, by taking these actions—these 
flexibilities would have been in place 
until 2025. It is stopping prematurely 
what I believe is essential if we are 
going to ever live within our means 
here, finding better ways to do it and 
more sustainable ways to pay for it. We 
should have that flexibility. 
With this in mind, I will introduce 
the Let States Set Medicaid Require-
ments Act. This legislation will em-
power States to have the flexibility 
that they have had that has been mak-
ing progress. It will encourage behav-
iors that will improve healthcare out-
comes. It has precedence in other Fed-
eral programs when it comes to earn-
ing unemployment benefits or food as-
sistance. This bill is commonsense pol-
icy that I think needs to be put into 
place so that flexibility cannot arbi-
trarily be taken away. 
I yield to my colleague. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, for ev-
erything from emergency room visits 
to mental health care, Medicaid fund-
ing is vital to the health of our most

S4966 
July 20, 2021 
vulnerable citizens. More than 4 mil-
lion of my constituents, including half 
of all the children in the State, depend 
on the stability of the State’s Medicaid 
Program. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion has put the healthcare of these in-
dividuals in jeopardy by rescinding a 
previous approval of Texas’s 1115 waiv-
er extension. Basically, that waiver 
would allow the State to manage the 
program in a way that maximizes the 
benefit and save money where possible, 
mainly through managed care. 
Now, those are some pretty bureau-
cratic terms, the 1115 waiver, but here 
is the short of it: Texas stands to lose 
$11 billion to provide healthcare for un-
derserved patients as a result of this 
unilateral and unjustified rescission by 
the Biden administration. All of this 
was done for an unconstitutional pur-
pose: to force Texas to accept the Af-
fordable Care Act’s Medicaid expan-
sion—something the Supreme Court of 
the United States has said they cannot 
constitutionally force. Two anonymous 
Federal officials, in a Washington Post 
story, reported as much in a recent 
story. 
I said earlier, when this happened to 
Texas, that if the administration can 
do it to Texas, they can do it to any-
one, any State in this Chamber. My 
friend Senator BRAUN’s home State of 
Indiana and Senator YOUNG’s State of 
Indiana now is the latest victim, and I 
appreciate their commitment to ending 
this game of political chicken. 
These actions not only unjustifiably 
jeopardize the health of millions of vul-
nerable people, they also erode the 
trust States have when they negotiate 
with the Federal Government, where 
apparently a deal is not a deal. States 
will never view their Federal partners 
as working in good faith if these agree-
ments are invalidated by a successor 
administration. 
If we don’t stand up against these 
reckless actions now, which State will 
be next? It may not be a Medicaid 1115 
extension. It may be some other policy 
by the Biden administration. But how 
far in this case will this administration 
go to commandeer State resources in 
forcing a Medicaid expansion? 
I am proud to stand alongside of Sen-
ator BRAUN and Senator YOUNG in the 
fight to protect the healthcare of the 
most vulnerable Americans in my 
State and across the country. 
I yield to the junior Senator from In-
diana. I beg your pardon, Mr. Presi-
dent; maybe the senior Senator or— 
never mind. 
Mr. YOUNG. I thank my colleague 
very much for his reflections on what 
is really at stake here, Mr. President. 
Last month, the Biden administra-
tion’s Centers for Medicare and Med-
icaid Services notified the State of In-
diana that it was withdrawing approval 
of the State’s Gateway to Work Pro-
gram. So what does this actually mean 
to rank-and-file Hoosiers? Well, it 
means that the Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services has decided to 
revoke Indiana’s ability to determine 
appropriate work requirements and ap-
propriate community engagement ex-
pectations for Medicaid recipients in 
our State. It means that this adminis-
tration regards work as some form of 
punishment, and efforts to transition 
to a position of self-reliance are some-
how inappropriate. 
Now, we Republicans believe in peo-
ple. We believe in people. We believe in 
self-reliance. We believe that the vast 
majority of Americans, Americans of 
modest 
means, 
don’t 
want 
to 
be 
trapped in Government programs. 
Medicaid should ideally be a service 
which is a temporary support for peo-
ple who really need it. The goal should 
be to prepare individuals for a life of 
dignity, and that includes securing a 
vocation, finding a measure of self-reli-
ance in life. 
Now, Indiana wasn’t the only State 
to receive this bad news. Arizona offi-
cials also received word that their 
Medicaid work expectations were being 
revoked. Just a few months ago, this 
administration 
likewise 
pulled 
all 
work expectations from the States of 
Arkansas, New Hampshire, Michigan, 
and Wisconsin. 
Indiana’s Gateway to Work Program, 
again revoked by CMS, would have 
merely asked Medicaid recipients to re-
port 20 hours of work or volunteer or 
school or other activities every month. 
This is really important. These com-
munity engagement activities are de-
signed to improve quality of life, to im-
prove the quality of the recipient’s life 
over the long-term and to help Hoo-
siers transition from Medicaid to full 
employment. This is what people want. 
When we think of the American 
dream, we think of the ability to go 
out and start a family and be part of a 
larger community and to be able to 
meaningfully participate in a nation’s 
civic life and to secure a vocation. 
Most would regard the goals of Indi-
ana’s Gateway to Work program as 
commendable. However, according to 
CMS, this program would result in sig-
nificant coverage losses and harm to 
beneficiaries—harm to beneficiaries—a 
misleading statement that ignores the 
extensive list of individuals exempt 
from this requirement: students, preg-
nant women, the medically frail or the 
incapacitated, those with disabilities, 
and a bunch of others. 
Now, luckily for Hoosiers, the State 
of Indiana had not yet implemented 
the Gateway to Work program at the 
time of CMS’s notice because of the 
unique challenges presented by the 
pandemic; meaning that Medicaid re-
cipients would not face immediate dis-
ruption of their benefits. 
Unfortunately, the same cannot be 
said for other Americans across the 
country. And we are here to fight for 
them. This includes Texas, where the 
administration’s decision to revoke 
that State’s waiver put in jeopardy 
healthcare for 4 million Americans. 
That doesn’t sound very compassionate 
to me. 
Up to this point, Medicaid waivers 
have allowed the States the ability, the 
freedom—the freedom under our fed-
eralist system—to test new policy ap-
proaches within the Medicaid Program, 
allowing them to design and improve 
their programs in ways that best fit 
their own populations and maybe serve 
as models for other States where suc-
cesses are elicited and proven. 
But with the Biden administration’s 
recent actions, with their one-size-fits- 
all mandates and mindset, States will 
now need to be on guard. CMS may de-
cide to revoke its waiver authority at 
any given time. This means any at-
tempt by a State to improve its Med-
icaid Program carries a serious risk of 
disrupting healthcare for the program’s 
beneficiaries if that innovation could 
ultimately be revoked. God forbid we 
try and improve a government pro-
gram. But I guess Medicaid is perfect, 
and we can’t find room for improve-
ment. Certainly, we can’t rely on the 
States to come up with improvements. 
Any improvements that might be made 
would have to come from Washington, 
DC. This is the sort of mindset we seem 
to be dealing with. 
But for a nation that has always val-
ued 
quality 
and 
innovation 
in 
healthcare, for Americans who believe 
we should empower all of our citizens, 
and for leaders who believe we have a 
responsibility to provide the least 
among us the necessary tools to stand 
on their own two feet, this is an 
unsustainable situation. 
So I urge my colleagues to act now 
and stand up for their State’s ability to 
set their own Medicaid requirements 
that meet the needs of their own citi-
zens. 
And with that, I yield to my es-
teemed colleague from Indiana, who 
has been working very hard on this 
issue, Senator BRAUN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of my bill, which is at the desk. 
Further, I ask that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed, and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, first of 
all, I want to say about my two col-
leagues, I have very much enjoyed 
talking healthcare with the Senator 
from Indiana, the lead sponsor of this. 
We have had a lot of very productive 
discussions 
about 
the 
role 
of 
healthcare in America. 
I strongly support the proposition 
that the Federal Government doesn’t 
know all the answers here. Sometimes 
my friends say I am the Senator from 
innovation because I am always trying 
to promote innovation. That is what 
section 1332 is all about.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4967 
July 20, 2021 
My other colleague from Indiana is a 
very valued member of the Finance 
Committee. So I want it understood 
that I think Indiana Senators, they are 
100 percent straight shooters who I 
enjoy talking healthcare with. 
Let me say, respectfully, why I have 
a difference of opinion with respect to 
this issue. 
My sense is that what my colleagues 
from Indiana want to do is based on a 
premise that comes from the Trump 
administration, 
which 
I 
think 
is 
flawed. The premise is that those on 
Medicaid really don’t work and don’t 
want to work. 
Having run the legal aid program for 
the elderly before I came to the Senate 
and was codirector of the Oregon Gray 
Panthers—and, again, it is a good dis-
cussion. People have differences of 
opinion. I think those on Medicaid 
overwhelmingly—overwhelmingly 
would like to be able to work and do 
work, and that is what the difference of 
opinion is here. 
As I understand it, Senator BRAUN 
wants States to have the authority to 
condition access to Medicaid on work. 
Now, his colleague from Indiana noted 
some exceptions and the like, which 
sounds like it is of some value, but the 
basic proposition is conditioning access 
to Medicaid on work. 
It has been my experience—and I 
have made a practice of it over the 
years, having been in public life, to go 
back and talk to people on Medicaid. I 
think overwhelmingly they want to 
and do work. 
It seems to me, as we emerge from 
the economic effects of the COVID cri-
sis—and my colleague and I are going 
to work, for example, on unemploy-
ment insurance, where I hope, again, to 
bring flexibility to the States. For ex-
ample, my colleague on the Finance 
Committee knows that we certainly 
had a lot of serious technology issues 
with respect to the unemployment in-
surance programs of the States. So one 
of the areas I will propose, as we con-
tinue our work this year, is that the 53 
systems should have a uniform base-
line. And I think we are going to have 
good support, Democrats and Repub-
licans, on it. The key feature will be, of 
course, giving States the flexibility to 
innovate, consistent with having a uni-
form baseline. 
So I want my colleagues, both of 
them, to understand—Senator BRAUN, 
who I have had some good conversa-
tions with, with respect to healthcare; 
and Senator YOUNG, who is on the Fi-
nance Committee—I very much look 
forward to working with both of them 
on these healthcare issues. 
For the reasons that I am describing 
today, I am objecting at this time. But 
I think there are a lot of areas where 
both parties can come together with 
respect to healthcare. For these rea-
sons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. 
BRAUN. 
Mr. 
President, 
my 
friend from Oregon, we have had a dis-
cussion not only on this particular 
issue. I respect his point of view. And I 
think we both agree, though, that when 
it comes to healthcare, it is something 
that is breaking the bank in this coun-
try. 
When it is 20 percent of our GDP, and 
it is 10 to 12 percent in most other de-
veloped countries, it has got to be a 
problem with the underlying industry 
and the way government has gone 
about trying to address it. 
I am one in my own business, 13 years 
ago, who declared that no one should 
go broke because they get sick or have 
a bad accident, and then took the tools 
that were out there with a system that 
didn’t give you many to work with, 
have found a way to make it sustain-
able, to put skin in the game for my 
own employees, to get them to get bet-
ter care for themselves, and to do 
things that weren’t the same things we 
have been doing, which have not im-
proved the situation. 
Medicaid is paid for half by States, 
half by the Federal Government. I 
think it does entitle States to have 
more flexibility on account of it. But 
what I would ask my colleagues on my 
side of the aisle is to look at holding 
the industry more accountable by 
being competitive, transparent, engag-
ing the healthcare consumer, and that 
the other side of the aisle doesn’t just 
push through for spending more Fed-
eral dollars, where the proof is in the 
pudding. Neither approach has been 
working. 
It is a tapeworm on the economy. 
Warren Buffett has got it correct. We 
need to put our heads together. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
H.R. 1652 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, 
just about a month ago, I was on the 
floor. Senator DURBIN from Illinois was 
here. We were on the floor at that time 
to ask for unanimous consent to pass 
legislation to fix a technical issue with 
the VOCA deposit. 
As my colleagues will remember, 
VOCA is designed to help sustain the 
Crime Victims Fund Act, or that is the 
legislation that we had introduced at 
that time. Just to refresh memories, I 
would like to reiterate why this fix to 
the victims fund is so essential. 
Effectively, what we are talking 
about here is stability; sustainability; 
and, really, certainty. 
I had an opportunity in late June to 
host a roundtable with members from 
the victim services groups from around 
the State. We were focused on the im-
pact of the VOCA deposit issue specific 
to Alaska and what it meant for those 
who provide the services for victims, 
whether these are the child advocacy 
centers, whether these are the domes-
tic violence shelters and the centers, 
abused women networks. But I was 
really blown away by the testimony 
from so many in these organizations. 
They were facing a 36-percent cut to 
the VOCA funds in just this past fiscal 
year. 
When you think about what the im-
pact of cuts at 36 percent means to any 
organization, it is, obviously, very, 
very limiting. But for some of these or-
ganizations, we are talking about a 
quarter of their budget. A quarter of 
their annual budget could be lost just 
like that. 
What they shared with me was that 
this was everything for them. This was 
the difference of being able to answer 
the phone from somebody who has been 
abused; is in an awful, tragic situation; 
doesn’t know where to go, and they 
phone that number and there is nobody 
to take that call, nobody to respond, 
nobody to save those lives. 
It is a matter of not just having the 
individual there to answer the phone, 
but, again, when we think about the 
types of services that are provided by 
these victim services organizations, 
they are there for, truly, the most vul-
nerable at an exceptionally vulnerable 
moment in their lives. 
I was able to hear from those who 
were gathered at this roundtable, to 
hear firsthand on the increases in vic-
timization that we have seen in my 
home State of Alaska during this past 
year, as we have seen this impact from 
COVID. But the impacts of this in-
crease on our providers have really 
been astounding. 
Alaska CARES, for example, saw a 
173-percent increase in children hos-
pitalized in the pediatric ICU for seri-
ous physical abuse and fatal neglect. 
Think about that. They had a 173-per-
cent increase in these kids who are 
being hospitalized, and they have said 
they were seeing significant brain trau-
ma, significant brain injury. I heard 
about unprecedented increases that we 
are seeing in child torture, which our 
child advocacy centers are witnessing 
firsthand. Really, when you think 
about that, it has to just haunt you to 
the core. 
The Alaska chapter of Volunteers of 
America, which receives VOCA funds to 
provide at-risk youth and children with 
vital mental health services, shared a 
story. They introduced me to Alice. 
Alice is a teen who experienced nu-
merous traumatic events in her young 
life, including child sexual assault and 
neglect. By receiving services through 
VOCA, she is pulling her life together. 
She is learning coping skills, learning 
to make those positive choices. 
So when we think about the role that 
these victim services play, these pro-
viders who, again, are there for truly 
the most vulnerable at the most vul-
nerable times that they may face, it 
should make us want to do everything 
we can to ensure that they have the re-
sources available for them. 
The longer Congress delays this inev-
itable fix, the larger cuts victim serv-
ices in Alaska and in every State in 
our Nation are going to face. I think

we all recognize this has been a dif-
ficult time, but for those who are try-
ing to serve victims through a global 
pandemic, it has really been so much 
harder. It has been 10 times harder. Our 
providers are exhausted. They are 
burned out. And now they are faced 
with massive cuts. 
Now, my colleague from Pennsyl-
vania has some legitimate budget con-
cerns that he hopes to address through 
an amendment we will take up later 
today. His concerns with changes in 
mandatory spending are valid, and I re-
spect that, but this VOCA fix legisla-
tion is not the mechanism to address 
these concerns. I fear that if his 
amendment should pass, it will delay 
and perhaps derail this much needed 
fix. 
Again, we are hearing from victims. 
We are hearing from survivors. We are 
hearing from victim service organiza-
tions. They are asking us—they are 
asking us—they are begging us for a fix 
now to the VOCA deposit. I am not 
hearing too many of them ask for 
CHIMP reform. The use of CHIMPs is 
controversial. Our legislation, which 
would fix the VOCA deposit, is not. 
We cannot fail the many who dedi-
cate their lives to serving victims and 
survivors. There was an Alaska organi-
zation at the VOCA roundtable who 
said it very neatly. She said: It is a 
representation of our values as a soci-
ety how we help those who are most 
vulnerable. 
We have the ability today to do what 
is right, so I would urge my colleagues 
to vote aye on the VOCA Fix Act. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that Senator HYDE- 
SMITH and I be allowed to use a prop or 
two during our next presentation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY 
BASEBALL TEAM 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, thank 
you very much. 
My first prop is a front-page story 
from the Northeast Mississippi Daily 
Journal on Thursday, July 1, 2021. It 
says: 
Hail State! Bulldogs are national cham-
pions. Mississippi State celebrates after win-
ning the College World Series 9–0 against 
Vanderbilt after the deciding Game 3 on 
Wednesday in Omaha. See full coverage: 
Sports, 1B. 
That is my other prop, and that head-
line says: 
Best in Show. Decisive win delivers first 
national title for the Mississippi State Bull-
dogs. 
Senator HYDE-SMITH and I could not 
be more delighted to rise this after-
noon and recognize Mississippi State 
University and their baseball team on 
their first national championship in 
school history in any sport. 
The Bulldogs had been to the College 
World Series 11 times in the past, and 
that in itself is a remarkable achieve-
ment. They even got to the champion-
ship series once in 2013. But this year 
was the year it all finally came to-
gether 
under 
Head 
Coach 
Chris 
Lemonis. 
They say good pitching wins baseball 
games, and in this case, it certainly 
helped Mississippi State win the Col-
lege World Series. 
The hype had been building around 
MSU by the time they arrived in 
Omaha in mid-June. After beating 
Texas and then Virginia and then again 
beating Texas on a walk-off hit in the 
bottom of the ninth, the Dawgs ad-
vanced to the championship round to 
face Vanderbilt. 
The Bulldogs dropped the season 
opener, but the next day, on the 
strength of pitching from Houston Har-
ding and Preston Johnson, who com-
bined to throw a four-hitter, State 
bounced back with a 13-to-2 victory. 
They carried that momentum into 
game 3, where Will Bednar and Landon 
Sims took the mound and held Vandy 
to one single hit. The Bulldogs won in 
a 9-to-0 shutout to bring the national 
title home for the first time ever to 
Starkville, MS. 
I want to offer my congratulations to 
Mississippi State Head Coach Chris 
Lemonis, who was named Coach of the 
Year by Collegiate Baseball Newspaper. 
Congratulations are also in order for 
Will Bednar, who won Most Out-
standing Player at the College World 
Series and outfielder Tanner Allen, the 
SEC Player of the Year. He was also 
named the American Baseball Coaches 
Association National Player of the 
Year. 
In addition, six Bulldogs were named 
to this year’s College World Series All- 
Tournament 
Team: 
Logan 
Tanner, 
Luke Hancock, Lane Forsythe, Tanner 
Allen, 
Rowdey 
Jordan, 
and 
Will 
Bednar. 
I want to commend the Mississippi 
State Bulldogs team for their tireless 
work throughout this season and for 
their outstanding achievement. They 
have made Mississippi State and the 
entire Magnolia State of Mississippi 
proud. 
In the words of the late Jack Cristil, 
the voice of the Bulldogs for many, 
many years, you can wrap this one up 
in the maroon and white. 
I yield to my colleague from Mis-
sissippi. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
am so pleased to join my colleague in 
congratulating Mississippi State Uni-
versity’s baseball team on its recent 
2021 NCAA College World Series cham-
pionship, the first NCAA championship 
in school history. 
Mississippi State capped off its ex-
traordinary season by defeating an in-
credibly talented Vanderbilt Univer-
sity team 9 to 0 in game 3. My house 
was full. We were all cheering. Their 
impressive 
and 
remarkable 
run 
through this year’s College World Se-
ries is a testament to the rich tradition 
of the MSU baseball program, which 
has now appeared in 12 NCAA College 
World Series in its history, including 
most recently 3 consecutive series. The 
inspiring performance of this baseball 
team continues to be celebrated all 
over our State. Maroon is everywhere. 
I truly appreciate the hard work, 
skill, and dedication that earned these 
athletes the first NCAA Division I 
baseball championship for Mississippi 
State, which are aptly described in the 
accompanying resolution. 
We take pride in the legacy and in-
spiring example of these young men 
and their coaches. Thank you for such 
a wonderful and historic season. Hail 
State. 
(Rings cowbell.) 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to oppose 
Democrats’ latest multitrillion-dollar 
spending spree. 
It has only been 4 months since the 
Democrats passed a $1.9 trillion spend-
ing bill, and it was done through Con-
gress on a party-line vote. Not a single 
Republican voted for the bill. The 
Democrats put the whole thing on a 
credit card. The bill is going to be paid 
for by our kids and our grandkids, and 
they are going to have to pay for it 
with interest. 
To me, that bill was completely un-
necessary. It was a big payoff to the 
people who run the Democratic Party— 
$86 billion for union bosses, hundreds of 
billions for bankrupt blue States, and 
free vacation time for DC bureaucrats. 
There was a big expansion of Medicaid. 
There was an even bigger expansion of 
ObamaCare. Millions of dollars went 
for so-called climate justice. 
The bill flooded the country with 
cash, and it did so without adding 
goods or services to the country. So 
what happens? Well, prices go up. It is 
no wonder that prices have gone up 
since Joe Biden took office. 
Experts from both parties warned 
that the so-called stimulus bill would 
actually cause inflation, and that in-
cludes President Obama’s economic ad-
viser Larry Summers. Critics also in-
cluded former Obama economic adviser 
Jason Furman. I want to make sure I 
get the quote right. He said: ‘‘I don’t 
know any economist that was recom-
mending something the size of what 
[we passed].’’ Didn’t know a single 
economist who recommended it. 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budg-
et Office said we don’t need any stim-
ulus funding. Well, that didn’t stop the 
Democrats. The Congressional Budget 
Office said our economy would be back 
to normal, they said, this summer 
without a dime of additional spending. 
Democrats, of course, ignored the ex-
perts. They got their hands on Amer-
ica’s credit card, and they just couldn’t 
resist using it. 
One measure of inflation is now the 
highest it has been in nearly 30 years.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4969 
July 20, 2021 
Filling up a pickup truck in my home 
State of Wyoming—and I was there 
again this past weekend—is now about 
$25 more expensive than it was the day 
Joe Biden was inaugurated. For 3 
months in a row, prices have gone up 
faster than wages. In effect, the Amer-
ican people, because of the inflation ex-
ceeding wages and growth, have taken 
a pay cut. 
Two things I hear about every week-
end in Wyoming: one, the cost of 
things, and then I hear from small 
businesses trying to hire people, trying 
to get people back to work. 
We know, nationally, nearly half of 
all the unemployed people have been 
making more money by staying at 
home than they would have by going to 
work. That is because Washington 
Democrats continue to pay them un-
employment bonuses on top of the un-
employment earnings that they make 
in their own State. States have unem-
ployment programs to compensate peo-
ple who are out of work, but Wash-
ington Democrats said: Not enough. We 
are going to pay everybody a big bonus 
on top of that. 
At the end of June, a poll estimated 
that 1.8 million people were staying 
home from work because they were 
making more money not working than 
they would make by working. These 
people aren’t lazy. They are logical. 
They see what the incentives are. 
Democrats are printing money, and 
people are not going to work because 
they are getting paid to stay home. No 
wonder that we have inflation com-
bined with a record number in this 
country of unfilled jobs. 
Both inflation and worker shortages 
were created by this Democratic spend-
ing bill. It seems the Democrats still 
haven’t learned basic economics, and 
now the Democrats are getting ready 
to make the same mistake all over 
again. This time, it is even on a bigger 
scale. The Democrats are spending tax-
payer dollars like it is Monopoly 
money. 
Democrats are getting ready to cram 
another bill through Congress on an-
other party-line vote, ignoring all the 
warning signs. Even the Treasury Sec-
retary, the Secretary of the Treasury, 
Janet Yellen, admitted last week—she 
said ‘‘several more months of rapid in-
flation’’; ‘‘several more months of 
rapid inflation.’’ 
Democrats see the inflation and say: 
Don’t worry about it. We will just send 
you another government check. Demo-
crats seem to want the entire country 
getting a government check. 
The latest spending spree massively 
expands ObamaCare, just like the last 
one. This new spending spree would 
lower the age of Medicare even though 
life expectancy has gone up since Medi-
care was created. 
This reckless spending spree would 
also give amnesty to millions and mil-
lions of illegal immigrants. The am-
nesty includes nothing to strengthen 
our borders. That is where the work 
needs to be done. It just creates more 
incentives to come here illegally. No 
wonder we are seeing the highest num-
bers of illegal aliens in 20 years, right 
now. Many illegal immigrants have ad-
mitted they came here because Demo-
crats promised to give them govern-
ment benefits: free healthcare, plus the 
assurance that they could stay in this 
country. 
The spending spree is larded up with 
giveaways to the Democrats’ favorite 
groups: union bosses, trial lawyers, 
leftwing professors. It includes tax-
payer funding for full-time professional 
climate activists. 
So this morning, this very morning, 
Representative OCASIO-CORTEZ of New 
York and 80 other Members and Demo-
crats sent a letter to Senator SCHUMER 
demanding funding of these activists. 
Senator SCHUMER went straight to the 
floor, and he said he would include it. 
Now, these full-time climate activ-
ists would get a government paycheck, 
free healthcare, free childcare, free col-
lege tuition, free housing—part of the 
Democrats’ goal of replacing middle- 
class jobs with government checks. 
The majority leader came to the 
floor and talked about hiring hundreds 
of thousands of climate activists—a 
climate corps. Think about all the ac-
tivists against the Keystone Pipeline, 
against drilling in the Arctic. They 
would now be paid by the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
This bill that we are going to be con-
sidering, the budget that the Demo-
cratic Party is bringing forth, also in-
cludes supersizing the Internal Rev-
enue Service. In total, the bill is the 
single most expensive spending bill in 
the history of this Nation. It costs al-
most as much as America’s entire role 
in World War II. It might not be infra-
structure, but it is a bullet train to so-
cialism. 
This new spending bill raises taxes. 
Yet it gives carve-outs to rich people in 
blue States and owners of electric vehi-
cles. 
Let me be very clear. Not one Repub-
lican is going to vote for this budget 
bill—not one in the House, not one in 
the Senate—not for this loaded, reck-
less spending spree with all the taxes 
included. That is why all it takes is 
one Democrat in the Senate or a hand-
ful in the House to stop this freight 
train to socialism. 
This means all eyes will now be on 
the Democratic caucus. CHUCK SCHU-
MER and NANCY PELOSI want absolutely 
every one of them to walk the plank. 
One Democrat could stop this sprint to 
socialism, stop this massive amnesty, 
stop these crippling tax increases. If 
none do, every single Democrat will be 
held responsible for the consequences 
of their actions. 
The consequences mean more infla-
tion, with higher costs of gas, goods, 
groceries, more worker shortages, and 
more debt for our Nation. Democrats 
did enough damage with their last 
spending blowout. The new spending 
spree is twice as big, and the timing is 
even worse. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
H.R. 1652 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise 
this afternoon to speak about the legis-
lation we are going to be voting on 
later today, including an amendment 
that I have, and it has to do with the 
Crime Victims Fund. And I just want 
to explain and remind my colleagues 
just how important the Crime Victims 
Fund is. 
This is a very, very major funding 
source for people who do some of the 
most important work in America. I 
know. I have met these folks. I have 
toured their facilities all across Penn-
sylvania. I am referring to the advo-
cates for victims of crimes. And these 
advocates, my goodness, the heinous 
and horrendous crimes that they guide 
people’s recovery from—I am at a loss 
for words to describe what these folks 
do often for children, often for very 
vulnerable people who are victims of 
these heinous crimes. 
Well, thank God there are people who 
dedicate their lives, professionals who 
dedicate their lives to helping people 
with their recovery, to helping people 
who are victims to cope with what can 
be horrific reliving of the experience 
when they have to recount it to law en-
forcement 
or 
go 
through 
physical 
exams and on and on. It is very, very 
difficult work, and it is very, very im-
portant to help completely innocent 
victims get through what is undoubt-
edly the worst experience in their life-
time. 
So the Crime Victims Fund provides 
resources for the people who help the 
victims of crime and for victims them-
selves. It is important to point out 
that the fund is funded entirely by the 
proceeds 
from 
criminal 
penalties. 
There is no taxpayer money in this 
fund. There never has been. It is en-
tirely from criminal penalties. 
And there is a statute that created 
this account in the Federal Govern-
ment that requires the money that 
goes into it, these criminal penalties, 
to go to the victims and their advo-
cates. But it doesn’t say when the 
money has to go, and so that gave rise 
to a serious problem that developed. 
For years, it turns out that money 
that was put into this fund—money 
from criminal penalties that went into 
the fund—didn’t go to victims, didn’t 
go to the advocates for victims. It was 
intentionally withheld because we had 
these crazy budget rules that created 
an incentive to withhold it. 
The way the budget rule worked is, if 
there was money in the fund that did 
not go to the victims of crime and 
their advocates, as it is supposed to, 
under the budget rules, you could pre-
tend that that was a savings, and it 
would therefore allow you to spend 
more money in other areas. It was ef-
fectively a way to circumvent spending 
caps, and that is how it was used. 
Year in and year out, money was sys-
tematically withheld from victims of

crime and their advocates, and it was a 
big problem. I will give you a sense of 
scale. In 2014, for instance, only $745 
million was obligated, despite a bal-
ance of $9 billion. There was over $8 bil-
lion in funding that was supposed to go 
to crime victims and their advocates 
intentionally withheld. In 2013, only 
$730 million was obligated out of a lit-
tle over an $8 billion balance. There 
was over $7 billion intentionally with-
held. 
From 2001 to 2014, the value of the 
funds—the money going in—increased 
by almost 600 percent. Funding for vic-
tims of crime and their advocates in-
creased by 39 percent. 
This was wrong. It was an abuse. It 
was based on an arcane and ridiculous 
budget rule, and it had a very, very del-
eterious effect. So when I discovered 
this, I began fighting this aggressively. 
It was brought to my attention by the 
people who serve victims of crime. 
These groups came to me and asked 
me to help them in the struggle for 
them to get the resources they needed 
to meet the unmet needs of victims of 
crime all over my State and, I am sure, 
all over the country. 
For instance, in 2015, the National 
Children’s Alliance sent me a letter, 
and they said: 
The [Crime Victims Fund] caps have been 
set too low; deposits— 
Meaning the criminal penalties going 
into the fund— 
have skyrocketed while disbursements have 
remained almost flat. . . . We look forward 
to further working with you to make all of 
the statutory changes needed to update the 
VOCA Crime Victims Fund and in turn bet-
ter meet the needs of all victims and sur-
vivors of crime. 
In 2016, the Court Appointed Special 
Advocates wrote: 
Since 2000, when Congress began capping 
disbursement from the Crime Victims Fund 
to prevent fluctuations in deposits, funding 
has not kept pace with the needs of victims, 
including the growing population of child 
victims in America. 
In 2015, I got a letter from the Penn-
sylvania Coalition Against Domestic 
Violence, and they said: 
The most frustrating thing for someone 
who has done policy work is that there is 
money available for these unmet needs. 
That is all true. There was money 
available. It was because money was 
deposited into the fund. It was just 
being systematically withheld from the 
victims of crime and their advocates. 
But I got the message, and I think 
these folks were exactly right. So in re-
sponse to these groups, I began work-
ing closely with appropriators on both 
sides of the aisle to address this prob-
lem and worked extensively with Sen-
ator SHELBY and his staff. The fact is, 
since about 2015, appropriators, the 
folks who control the effective alloca-
tion of this, have voluntarily obligated 
appropriate levels of disbursements 
since 2015, and the chart illustrates 
this very clearly. 
Everything to the left of the green 
line is prior to 2015. You can see these 
very, very low levels—less than $1 bil-
lion every year—despite huge amounts 
of money being poured in; and then 
afterwards, starting in 2015, large, 
large increases in disbursements from 
the fund. Very, very important. 
This has changed the circumstances 
for advocates of crime. They have 
grown enormously. I know this. In 
Pennsylvania, they have been able to 
hire more counselors. They have been 
able to open more facilities to treat 
and to help these victims of crime. 
This is tremendous progress, but 
there is no guarantee that it is going 
to continue. So I have sought to make 
this simple principle: The idea that the 
money flowing into the fund should 
also flow out of the fund to the vic-
tims. I have tried to make this a per-
manent arrangement. 
Now, let me be very clear. I am not 
trying to change budget rules. I am not 
trying to reopen some general budget. 
This is one egregious example of a cat-
egory of budget flaws, and I am not 
trying to change it. I would love to 
change that. I should qualify that. I am 
trying to change it in other venues, but 
not here, not today. Today, all I am 
trying to do is something very, very 
narrow and very specific, and that is to 
make sure that victims of crimes and 
their advocates get the money they are 
supposed to get. It is really and truly 
as simple as that. 
I have introduced legislation to do 
just this, repeatedly—you know, legis-
lation that would simply require that 
we appropriate the appropriate dollar 
amounts each year. It was reported fa-
vorably out of the Senate Budget Com-
mittee in 2015. It was unanimously 
adopted in the congressional Bipar-
tisan Budget Act of 2019. 
So there is broad bipartisan support 
for this idea. But we have never been 
able to get it across the finish line. 
Again, I am not trying to change all 
the budget rules, just this one fund. I 
just want to make sure that crime vic-
tims get the money that the statute 
says they are supposed to get. 
The Senator from Illinois, I believe, 
is the Senator who has introduced leg-
islation that would create a new cat-
egory of resources for the Crime Vic-
tims Fund, and that is specifically to 
add deferred and nondeferred prosecu-
tion agreement payments to the Crime 
Victims Fund. So it wouldn’t be just 
criminal judgments. It would also be 
these prosecution agreements. 
I fully support that money going into 
the Crime Victims Fund. It is a new, 
important source of revenue that can 
help to serve these victims of crime. 
There are no tax dollars involved. I 
support this goal. I support this legis-
lation. I just want to make sure that 
we don’t go back to these days, that 
weren’t so terribly long ago, when 
money going into the fund stayed in 
the fund because it served people’s pur-
poses. 
And that is a problem I have with the 
underlying legislation in its current 
form. That legislation has no require-
ment whatsoever that any increase in 
funding will actually be matched by an 
increase in outflows for victims and 
their advocates. 
You see, making the fund bigger 
doesn’t by itself guarantee that there 
will be any more money for victims of 
crime or their advocates. Ensuring 
that money goes into the fund is just 
not enough. We saw this. We need to 
ensure that more money is actually 
leaving the fund and going to victims, 
not remaining unspent so as to offset 
some other category of spending, who 
knows what. 
I was appreciative back in 2018 for 
the endorsement from the National Or-
ganization for Victim Assistance, who 
wrote: 
A permanent solution is needed. . . . There 
is no mechanism to stop Congress from di-
verting money from victims in the future, 
should it choose to do so. 
Well, my amendment solves this 
problem. It is very simple. It would 
just require a reasonable minimum 
level for victims and advocates based 
on the amounts that have been depos-
ited into the Crime Victims Fund from 
both of the sources. 
As I say, Congress has been adhering 
to this voluntarily since 2016. What my 
amendment would do is it would sim-
ply create a point of order. If legisla-
tion came to the floor that violated 
this principle and that went back to 
these 
days 
of 
withholding—inten-
tionally 
withholding—money 
that 
should be going to victims of crime, 
then that legislation would be subject 
to a point of order. Now, 60 Senators 
could override that point of order, but 
at least it would create the presump-
tion and an incentive for appropriation 
legislation to actually provide the 
funding to victims and their advocates 
that it is supposed to. 
I should also be clear. The policy 
only creates a spending floor. It would 
be at the discretion of the appropri-
ators first and Congress as a whole 
later to decide if they wanted to dis-
burse more money than what the floor 
contemplates, but the floor would at 
least prevent the worst of these abuses. 
So you can imagine my surprise 
when some of the folks who are big ad-
vocates for putting more money into 
the fund are adamantly opposed to my 
language that would actually require 
that money to also come out of the 
fund and go to the intended bene-
ficiaries. 
You have to ask yourself, Why would 
someone oppose such a requirement? It 
is hard not to think that maybe one of 
the reasons that some people are ada-
mant that they not be required to ac-
tually disburse this money is maybe 
they are thinking about going back to 
what used to happen routinely around 
here. 
Remember, if the money is withheld 
from victims, if we go back to when the 
money didn’t make it out the door to 
victims, why, that amount that is 
withheld can be spent on other things, 
and that is a powerful incentive for a

lot of folks around here. You can see 
how it was done. 
Now, I have heard people say, some of 
my opponents say: Don’t worry. We 
have no intention of diverting any of 
this money. Just trust us, they say. 
If they have no intention of diverting 
the money, then why are they so ada-
mant that they not be required to dis-
burse it to its intended beneficiaries? 
Well, we don’t really have to specu-
late anymore because the President of 
the United States, President Biden, has 
been very clear about his intentions. In 
his budget, he has explicitly called for 
withholding this money from victims. 
It is right here in black and white. You 
don’t have to be creative here. You 
don’t have to be conspiratorial. The 
President has declared to the world in 
a published budget that he wants to 
withhold the money from crime vic-
tims. In fact, he laid it out there. It is 
in table S–8 of his budget. 
I think this is a well-founded concern 
that we might go back to that practice. 
And in any case, if nobody wants to go 
back 
to 
that 
practice, 
then 
why 
wouldn’t they agree to a requirement 
that this money actually be disbursed? 
Now, over the course of debating 
this, much has been made of a letter 
that has been signed by some victims’ 
organizations. Let’s look at this for 
what it is. Organizations that depend 
overwhelmingly on congressional ap-
propriations are asked to sign a letter 
by the very people who control whether 
or not they get funding, and the letter 
is advocating against codifying the sta-
ble increased funding that would ben-
efit those folks. 
I think we know what is going on 
there. I want to thank the many groups 
that are supporting this amendment: 
the Committee for a Responsible Fed-
eral 
Budget, 
Heritage 
Action, 
FreedomWorks, the R Street Institute, 
Taxpayer Protection Alliance, Ameri-
cans for Prosperity, and others. 
But, folks, this isn’t complicated and 
it isn’t about overhauling budget rules 
and it isn’t about anything that is ter-
ribly complicated or arcane. It is about 
ensuring that crime victims and their 
advocates get the money they are sup-
posed to get. 
I urge my colleagues to stand with 
me and support this amendment and 
make sure that the neediest and some 
of the most vulnerable among us—vic-
tims of crime—receive the increased 
funding they deserve. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will op-
pose this amendment today. I base it 
on my experience as an advocate for 
victims of crime that began when I was 
a prosecutor, certainly during the time 
when I was the Vice President of the 
National District Attorneys Associa-
tion and on their executive board. 
If you look at the Victims of Crime 
Act Fix bill, it has passed the House. It 
would deposit the proceeds in deferred 
prosecution 
agreements 
and 
non-
prosecution agreements into the Crime 
Victims Fund. And I mention this be-
cause in recent years, deposits into the 
fund have shrunk significantly. They 
actually threatened the ability to sus-
tain payments to crime victims. 
Senator TOOMEY’s amendment would 
create a point of order if expenditures 
from the Crime Victims Fund fall 
below the 3-year average. The current 
3-year average is $583 million, assum-
ing the CBO estimate of collections in 
fiscal year 2021 is $750 million. 
The Commerce, Justice, Science, and 
Related Agency Subcommittee, Appro-
priations, has worked to ensure the re-
lease of the fund is more than the 3- 
year average. For example, in fiscal 
year 2021, the CJS bill allows spending 
of $2 billion—$2.015 billion out of the 
fund. Now, that is $1.5 billion more 
than the 3-year average of fiscal years 
2018, 2019, and 2020. 
I mention all of this because I sup-
port the crime victims. I spent a career 
supporting and advocating for them. I 
did that, as I said, before I was in the 
Senate, when I was a prosecutor. 
But this amendment offered by Sen-
ator TOOMEY impinges on the ability of 
the Appropriations Committee to do its 
job. If it were adopted, here is what 
would happen. It would create a point 
of order. It would delay the movement 
of any appropriations bill that the 
Crime Victims Fund is part of. 
I just put over on the—talking about 
the average—we have been releasing 
more than the 3-year average of the 
fund over the last several fiscal years, 
but then there could be a time when 
there is not enough funds to keep it 
sustainable. 
And that is why we are here to vote 
on the underlying bill, the VOCA Fix 
Act. That would direct deposits from 
nonprosecution agreements and de-
ferred prosecution agreements to go 
into the Crime Victims Fund so we can 
continue to spend out of the fund at or 
above current levels. And without it, 
the spending would continue to fall. 
Victims groups like the National Al-
liance to End Sexual Violence are ask-
ing for clean passage of this act. 
I went down through it and looked at 
the various States. I mention a couple: 
the Pennsylvania Coalition Against 
Domestic Violence, the Children’s Ad-
vocacy Centers of Pennsylvania. The 
Pennsylvania Coalition Against Rape 
authored an opinion piece on July 5. 
They ask for clean passage of the 
VOCA Fix Act. 
By the way, this bill also has nearly 
60 cosponsors, including a number of 
my Republican colleagues like Sen-
ators MURKOWSKi, GRAHAM, CORNYN, 
and GRASSLEY. And the Senate bill is 
identical to the one before us, H.R. 
1652. 
Now, if we don’t include amend-
ments, if we pass this bill, we can get 
it to the President for signature imme-
diately. We can help to ensure deposits 
into the Crime Victims Fund. That 
means all crime victims are going to be 
helped. I want that passage without an 
amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD a 
letter from the Association of Pros-
ecuting 
Attorneys, 
the 
National 
Latin@ Network for Healthy Families, 
Council of State Governments, Futures 
Without Violence, and numerous oth-
ers be placed in the RECORD at the con-
clusion of my remarks. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JULY 13, 2021. 
Hon. MEMBER, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR: The organizations below, 
comprising the national VOCA stakeholder 
workgroup, are writing today to urge you to 
support a floor vote on the House-passed 
H.R. 1652, the VOCA Fix to Sustain the 
Crime Victims Fund Act of 2021 (‘‘VOCA Fix 
Act’’) by allowing a vote on the bill. We fur-
ther urge you to vote in favor of the VOCA 
Fix Act and to oppose controversial amend-
ments. 
The bipartisan and bicameral VOCA Fix 
Act, introduced in the Senate as S. 611 by 
Senators Durbin, Graham, Baldwin, Grass-
ley, Feinstein, Cornyn, Klobuchar, and Mur-
kowski, is a narrowly-focused, carefully ne-
gotiated technical fix to address an imme-
diate crises—massive cuts to Victim of 
Crime Act (‘‘VOCA’’) victim service grants 
and insufficient funding for victim com-
pensation. 
VOCA grants are funded by monetary pen-
alties associated with Federal criminal con-
victions—they are not funded with taxpayer 
money. In recent years, deposits into the 
VOCA’s Crime Victims Fund (‘‘CVF’’ or ‘‘the 
Fund’’) have dropped dramatically, due to 
the Department of Justice’s increasing reli-
ance on deferred prosecution and non-pros-
ecution agreements (DPAs/NPAs). Unlike 
criminal convictions, monetary penalties as-
sociated with DPAs/NPAs are deposited into 
the General Fund of the Treasury—they do 
not go into the Crime Victims Fund, despite 
being outcomes based on the same crimes. 
The VOCA Fix Act fixes this discrepancy 
by making a technical fix to deposit mone-
tary penalties associated with DPAs/NPAs 
into the CVF instead of the General Fund, in 
alignment with the original intent of the 
statute. It also increases funding for state 
victim compensation programs and includes 
other provisions outlined in this letter of 
support, signed by more than 1,710 national, 
regional, state, Tribal, and local organiza-
tions and government agencies. 
The VOCA Fix Act passed the House with 
overwhelming bipartisan support, but it has 
stalled in the Senate due to attempts to use 
the non-controversial VOCA Fix Act to force 
a vote on the controversial use of Changes in 
Mandatory Programs (‘‘CHIMPs’’) in the Ap-
propriations process. Recognizing the crit-
ical need to pass the VOCA Fix Act without 
further delay, Senators are pursuing a con-
sent agreement to vote on both the VOCA 
Fix Act and an amendment by Senator 
Toomey relating to the use of the VOCA 
CHIMP. We urge you to support a floor vote 
on the VOCA Fix Act by letting the unani-
mous consent agreement to go through. 
Upon the acceptance of the consent agree-
ment, we urge you to vote in favor of the 
VOCA Fix Act. 
We also urge you to vote against Senator 
Toomey’s amendment to limit the use of the 
VOCA offset by requiring Appropriators to 
release the average of the past three years’ 
deposits from the CVF annually. We recog-
nize Senator Toomey’s desire to help sur-
vivors, but his amendment is not the best

July 20, 2021 
way to do so. While on the surface, this pro-
posal may seem reasonable, it actually has 
the potential to be harmful. The average of 
the past three years’ deposits was less than 
$500 million. If there was no balance in the 
Fund to offset the low deposits, victim serv-
ice grants would have been $200 million—a 
cut of 95% compared to four years ago. The 
cuts to grants over the last few years have 
been catastrophic, but a cut of 95% would 
completely decimate the entire victim serv-
ice infrastructure. The $2 billion balance al-
lowed by Senator Toomey’s amendment is 
less than yearly disbursement over the past 
five years and is insufficient to meet the 
needs of survivors. 
It is also important to note that funding is 
not being diverted from victims to pay for 
other programs, as stated by those seeking 
to amend the VOCA Fix Act. When the CVF 
is used as a paper offset, funds are not trans-
ferred to pay for other programs—they re-
main in the Fund. Moreover, despite claims 
to the contrary, Appropriators are not 
hoarding money in the Fund to use as an off-
set. Over the past several years, they have 
reduced the balance in the Fund from $13 bil-
lion in Fiscal Year 2017 to an anticipated $2.5 
billion at the end of this fiscal year by in-
creasing grants to victim service providers. 
While $2.5 billion may seem like a large bal-
ance, in actuality, it would only cover one 
year’s VOCA grants at Fiscal Year 2020 lev-
els, which were already at a five-year low. 
The amendment has the potential to bring 
down future funding bills and cause a gov-
ernment shutdown, and a bill with this lan-
guage would not pass the House of Rep-
resentatives. We ask that you join us in op-
posing this amendment. 
Victims, survivors, and victim service or-
ganizations are telling us that they are cut-
ting services, laying off staff, and even clos-
ing. They are asking for the VOCA Fix Act— 
they are not asking for CHIMP reform. While 
we wait for passage, survivors and advocates 
have watched criminal settlements totaling 
more than $545 million directed towards the 
General Fund rather than into the Crime 
Victims Fund this calendar year, because 
this technical fix has not passed. Ultimately, 
there may be merit in holding a conversation 
about the structure of Congressional spend-
ing bills, but the VOCA Fix Act is not the ap-
propriate forum. The use of CHIMPs is con-
troversial; the VOCA Fix Act is not. 
The VOCA Fix Act is a narrowly tailored, 
carefully negotiated technical fix bill to ad-
dress the immediate needs of survivors, and 
the Senate must act now to pass this critical 
legislation without any amendments. On be-
half of a broad and committed group of na-
tional, regional, state, Tribal, and local 
stakeholders, we urge you to support a vote 
on the VOCA Fix Act, to vote in favor of the 
VOCA Fix Act, and to vote against the 
Toomey amendment. Every delay allows po-
tential funds that should be deposited into 
the Crime Victims Fund to serve victims to 
instead be deposited into the General Treas-
ury. The House passed the VOCA Fix Act 
more than four months ago with over-
whelming bipartisan support; we urge the 
Senate to similarly pass the House-passed 
VOCA Fix Act, as is, immediately.

Mr. LEAHY. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
this amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I join 
Senator LEAHY and others who have 
come to the floor this afternoon to 
urge clean passage of the VOCA Fix 
Act so that we can secure greater de-
posits into the Crime Victims Fund 
and ensure continued support for crime 
victims. 
I am currently the chair of the Com-
merce, Justice, and Science Appropria-
tions Subcommittee. Senator MORAN 
from Kansas is my ranking member. 
Before that, Senator MORAN was chair 
of the committee, and I was the rank-
ing member. Together, we have com-
mitted to a target of spending from the 
fund at a minimum of the 3-year aver-
age of collections. That is a practice 
that was started by former Appropria-
tions Committee and CJS Chair Sen-
ator Mikulski, along with Senator 
SHELBY, back in 2015. 
All deposits made into the Crime 
Victims Fund should stay in the fund. 
Our subcommittee directs the amount 
that is released by the Justice Depart-
ment from the fund for victim services. 
But every dollar stays in the fund and 
is available in future years if it is not 
used for victim services. 
If 
Senator 
TOOMEY’s 
amendment 
passes, if appropriations bills contain 
less than the 3-year average, either the 
entire cap falls, depleting the fund in 
one fiscal year or, more likely, the ap-
propriations bill would be stopped from 
moving forward on the floor. 
Now, 
I 
appreciate 
what 
Senator 
TOOMEY is trying to do. He wants to ad-
dress budget reform and the impact of 
mandatory spending, but this is not the 
way to do that. That needs a thought-
ful process that goes through the com-
mittee that there is debate on. This 
should not be done as an amendment to 
a bill that is at a process that is crit-
ical to help the victims of crime. 
Victims groups and direct service 
providers are asking for the clean pas-
sage of this act, the VOCA Fix Act. 
They are urging us to vote no on Sen-
ator TOOMEY’s amendment. 
We have all heard from victims 
groups requesting clean passage of this 
bill. I have heard from individuals and 
organizations from across New Hamp-
shire, as Senator LEAHY said, organiza-
tions like the New Hampshire Coalition 
Against Domestic and Sexual Violence 
and the Granite State Children’s Alli-
ance which both benefit from the 
Crime Victims Fund because they get 
funding for those people who are in-
jured. 
This bill has already passed the 
House. If we pass this legislation today 
without amendment, it can be quickly 
signed into law, and we can get these 
much needed changes to shore up col-
lections into the fund so that the vic-
tims of crime can get the help that 
they need. It will make a meaningful 
impact to ensure there is adequate 
funding for survivors now and in years 
to come. 
I would urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the 
Toomey amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, be-
fore we proceed to a vote on final pas-
sage of the VOCA Fix Act, on which I 
teamed up with Senators DURBIN, GRA-
HAM, and other members of the Judici-
ary Committee, we first will turn to 
the Toomey amendment. 
This amendment is loosely based on a 
bill introduced by Senator TOOMEY in 
2015. That 2015 measure, entitled the 
‘‘Fairness for Victims of Crime Act,’’ 
would have created a budgetary point 
of order against legislation that re-
quired the Crime Victims Fund to dis-
burse less than the average amount 
collected by the Fund over the previous 
3 fiscal years. 
The Senate held a field hearing on 
this legislation, which was introduced 
by Senator Toomey, the same year. 
The Budget Committee, of which I am 
a member, then approved the legisla-
tion by unanimous voice vote. I still 
support the premise behind this bill, 
which is to promote fairness for crime 
victims and restore the original intent 
of the Victims of Crime Act. 
Some years ago, appropriators placed 
an arbitrary cap on the amount of 
money that could flow out of the Crime 
Victims Fund each year. The imposi-
tion of this cap meant not only that 
billions 
of 
dollars 
accumulated, 
unspent, in the fund in later years, but 
also that this sum could be used as an 
offset to support other projects backed 
by congressional appropriators. Mean-
while, the availability of so much 
unspent money in the Crime Victims 
Fund made it an extremely tempting 
target for budget dealmakers. On one 
occasion in 2015, during the Obama ad-
ministration, budget negotiators sim-
ply rescinded at least a billion dollars 
of the fund for a budget deal. 
As noted by Senator TOOMEY today, 
the President’s budget proposal for the 
coming fiscal year indicates that he 
proposes to rely on $26 billion in the 
Crime Victims Fund and cancellations 
in the Children’s Health Program to 
offset an equivalent amount in new dis-
cretionary spending. Table S–8 to the 
President’s budget shows that this is 
the intention. 
Every last penny brought into the 
Victims of Crime Act Fund is supposed 
to help victims rather than serve as a 
funding gimmick for other projects 
supported by appropriators and the 
White House. It is for this reason that 
I support the Toomey amendment. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is there 
a scheduled vote?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4973 
July 20, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. To the 
Senator from Illinois, it is scheduled 
for 5:15. 
Mr. DURBIN. The first vote is on the 
Toomey amendment followed by a vote 
on passage of the bill, amended or 
unamended? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is 
correct. 
Mr. DURBIN. I would just say in con-
clusion—and I thank the Senator from 
New Hampshire and the Senator from 
Vermont for their comments on this 
measure. 
If you listen carefully to the Senator 
from Pennsylvania, there is one thing 
he did not say. He did not say that any 
surplus in this fund was spent for an-
other purpose. 
He seems to worry about the alloca-
tion of the balance each year of the 
fund. I would think a fiscal conserv-
ative would want to make certain that 
the money spent is spent properly, not 
overspending in some years and under-
spending in others. 
That is exactly what the appropri-
ators are asking for here, the ability to 
moderate and to regulate the amount 
of money as it is spent, as it is needed. 
That seems like a pretty fiscally con-
servative point of view and a respon-
sible one. 
I urge my colleagues to follow the ad-
vice of the Senators from Vermont and 
New Hampshire and to oppose the 
Toomey amendment and support the 
passage of the bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, my un-
derstanding is that I would have 1 
minute to close out debate on this; is 
that correct? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 
1 minute, and the Senator is recog-
nized. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Could I claim that 
minute now? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Thank you very much. 
Listen, it is very clear that we have 
very broad agreements on a provision 
in this legislation that will dramati-
cally increase the money that goes into 
the fund. What my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle object to is a re-
quirement that the money actually go 
out of the fund to the victims and their 
advocates. 
And we know that, systemically, 
money was withheld from this fund for 
years, and we know that President 
Biden has stipulated in his current 
budget that it must happen again. 
I am simply saying, if we all agree 
that this nontaxpayer money coming 
from 
criminal 
penalties 
and 
non-
deferred agreements, if it is supposed 
to go into this account, the Crime Vic-
tims Fund, which I support, it should 
actually have to go to the victims of 
crime and their advocates. 
If my amendment passes, this bill 
could be passed by the House later that 
same day or the next day. It could be 
on the President’s desk before the end 
of the week, easily. If it were to pass 
and be signed into law, then we would 
be assured that appropriation bills 
would be brought to the floor with the 
proper allocation done. So I urge the 
support of my amendment, and then 
the adoption of the underlying bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am not 
going to read the lengthy statement 
from the coalition of victims’ rights 
advocates and law enforcement organi-
zations opposing the Toomey amend-
ment and the many organizations that 
have asked us to vote no on the amend-
ment and yes on the Victims of Crime 
Act. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD the entire state-
ment. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
JULY 13, 2021. 
Hon. MEMBER, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR: The organizations below, 
comprising the national VOCA stakeholder 
workgroup, are writing today to urge you to 
support a floor vote on the House-passed 
H.R. 1652, the VOCA Fix to Sustain the 
Crime Victims Fund Act of 2021 (‘‘VOCA Fix 
Act’’) by allowing a vote on the bill. We fur-
ther urge you to vote in favor of the VOCA 
Fix Act and to oppose controversial amend-
ments. 
The bipartisan and bicameral VOCA Fix 
Act, introduced in the Senate as S. 611 by 
Senators Durbin, Graham, Baldwin, Grass-
ley, Feinstein, Cornyn, Klobuchar, and Mur-
kowski, is a narrowly-focused, carefully ne-
gotiated technical fix to address an imme-
diate crises—massive cuts to Victim of 
Crime Act (‘‘VOCA’’) victim service grants 
and insufficient funding for victim com-
pensation. 
VOCA grants are funded by monetary pen-
alties associated with Federal criminal con-
victions—they are not funded with taxpayer 
money. In recent years, deposits into the 
VOCA’s Crime Victims Fund (‘‘CVF’’ or ‘‘the 
Fund’’) have dropped dramatically, due to 
the Department of Justice’s increasing reli-
ance on deferred prosecution and non-pros-
ecution agreements (DPAs/NPAs). Unlike 
criminal convictions, monetary penalties as-
sociated with DPAs/NPAs are deposited into 
the General Fund of the Treasury—they do 
not go into the Crime Victims Fund, despite 
being outcomes based on the same crimes. 
The VOCA Fix Act fixes this discrepancy 
by making a technical fix to deposit mone-
tary penalties associated with DPAs/NPAs 
into the CVF instead of the General Fund, in 
alignment with the original intent of the 
statute. It also increases funding for state 
victim compensation programs and includes 
other provisions outlined in this letter of 
support, signed by more than 1,710 national, 
regional, state, Tribal, and local organiza-
tions and government agencies. 
The VOCA Fix Act passed the House with 
overwhelming bipartisan support, but it has 
stalled in the Senate due to attempts to use 
the non-controversial VOCA Fix Act to force 
a vote on the controversial use of Changes in 
Mandatory Programs (‘‘CHIMPs’’) in the Ap-
propriations process. Recognizing the crit-
ical need to pass the VOCA Fix Act without 
further delay, Senators are pursuing a con-
sent agreement to vote on both the VOCA 
Fix Act and an amendment by Senator 
Toomey relating to the use of the VOCA 
CHIMP. We urge you to support a floor vote 
on the VOCA Fix Act by letting the unani-
mous consent agreement to go through. 
Upon the acceptance of the consent agree-
ment, we urge you to vote in favor of the 
VOCA Fix Act. 
We also urge you to vote against Senator 
Toomey’s amendment to limit the use of the 
VOCA offset by requiring Appropriators to 
release the average of the past three years’ 
deposits from the CVF annually. We recog-
nize Senator Toomey’s desire to help sur-
vivors, but his amendment is not the best 
way to do so. While on the surface, this pro-
posal may seem reasonable, it actually has 
the potential to be harmful. The average of 
the past three years’ deposits was less than 
$500 million. If there was no balance in the 
Fund to offset the low deposits, victim serv-
ice grants would have been $200 million—a 
cut of 95% compared to four years ago. The 
cuts to grants over the last few years have 
been catastrophic, but a cut of 95% would 
completely decimate the entire victim serv-
ice infrastructure. The $2 billion balance al-
lowed by Senator Toomey’s amendment is 
less than yearly disbursement over the past 
five years and is insufficient to meet the 
needs of survivors. 
It is also important to note that funding is 
not being diverted from victims to pay for 
other programs, as stated by those seeking 
to amend the VOCA Fix Act. When the CVF 
is used as a paper offset, funds are not trans-
ferred to pay for other programs—they re-
main in the Fund. Moreover, despite claims 
to the contrary, Appropriators are not 
hoarding money in the Fund to use as an off-
set. Over the past several years, they have 
reduced the balance in the Fund from $13 bil-
lion in Fiscal Year 2017 to an anticipated $2.5 
billion at the end of this fiscal year by in-
creasing grants to victim service providers. 
While $2.5 billion may seem like a large bal-
ance, in actuality, it would only cover one 
year’s VOCA grants at Fiscal Year 2020 lev-
els, which were already at a five-year low. 
The amendment has the potential to bring 
down future funding bills and cause a gov-
ernment shutdown, and a bill with this lan-
guage would not pass the House of Rep-
resentatives. We ask that you join us in op-
posing this amendment. 
Victims, survivors, and victim service or-
ganizations are telling us that they are cut-
ting services, laying off staff, and even clos-
ing. They are asking for the VOCA Fix Act— 
they are not asking for CHIMP reform. While 
we wait for passage, survivors and advocates 
have watched criminal settlements totaling 
more than $545 million directed towards the 
General Fund rather than into the Crime 
Victims Fund this calendar year, because 
this technical fix has not passed. Ultimately, 
there may be merit in holding a conversation 
about the structure of Congressional spend-
ing bills, but the VOCA Fix Act is not the ap-
propriate forum. The use of CHIMPs is con-
troversial; the VOCA Fix Act is not. 
The VOCA Fix Act is a narrowly tailored, 
carefully negotiated technical fix bill to ad-
dress the immediate needs of survivors, and 
the Senate must act now to pass this critical 
legislation without any amendments. On be-
half of a broad and committed group of na-
tional, regional, state, Tribal, and local 
stakeholders, we urge you to support a vote 
on the VOCA Fix Act, to vote in favor of the 
VOCA Fix Act, and to vote against the 
Toomey amendment. Every delay allows po-
tential funds that should be deposited into 
the Crime Victims Fund to serve victims to 
instead be deposited into the General Treas-
ury. The House passed the VOCA Fix Act 
more than four months ago with over-
whelming bipartisan support; we urge the 
Senate to similarly pass the House-passed 
VOCA Fix Act, as is, immediately.

TRIBUTE TO BRIAN WAGNER 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the 
U.S. Postal Service always provides 
outstanding service during every elec-
tion, but 2020 was something unseen in 
more than a century. Last year, USPS 
had to manage processing nearly 66 
million ballots, countless safety con-
cerns, and a hostile administration. 
And as expected, it met these chal-
lenges with incredible efforts and de-
termination. 
A 
big 
part 
of 
that 
strength came from the National Asso-
ciation of Postal Supervisors, or NAPS. 
What started as 50 postal supervisors 
dedicating themselves to helping their 
fellow supervisors more than a century 
ago has become a critical force during 
our election. They have kept our Na-
tion connected through the mail, and 
in 2020, they helped keep us connected 
to our democracy. 
With a membership of 27,000, NAPS 
local ballot ambassadors helped postal 
leadership process millions of ballots 
during this pivotal election. Leading 
the effort was NAPS national president 
Brian Wagner. I am grateful for his 
leadership and service. He has served in 
NAPS for more than 25 years, and in 
August, he will be retiring from his po-
sition. I would like to share his amaz-
ing story with you. 
Brian was a paperboy while growing 
up in Peoria, IL. Right out of high 
school, he joined the U.S. Postal Serv-
ice as a letter carrier. It was a perfect 
fit; Brian just enjoys people. He loves 
connecting with his neighbors and nat-
urally made friends all along his route. 
A lifelong lover of ice cream, Brian was 
happy to have The Spotted Cow ice 
cream shop on his route as well. Brian 
even met his wife Carol when he was a 
letter carrier. Carol ran the mailroom 
of a business on Brian’s route. 
While working as a letter carrier, 
Brian worked hard on his formal edu-
cation. He earned an associate’s degree 
in business from Illinois Central Junior 
College, a bachelor’s degree in finance 
from Illinois State University, and an 
MBA from Illinois State, all while still 
completing his route every day. Brian 
and Carol married after he graduated. 
In 1990, Brian joined NAPS. He joined 
NAPS because be knew that being a 
postal worker was a wonderful job with 
benefits that were worth fighting to 
keep. Others deserved to have the same 
opportunities he had. He began rep-
resenting NAPS members in 1994 when 
members elected him president of the 
Heart of IL Branch 255. Throughout the 
years, he has served as NAPS sec-
retary/treasurer, central region vice 
president, and NAPS Illinois State area 
vice president. 
In August 2016, Brian was elected 
NAPS national president and has been 
a consistent fighter for postal super-
visors. His dedication to NAPS is in-
credible. Brian even celebrated his 30th 
wedding anniversary at a NAPS con-
vention. He has been in their corner 
through these especially tough times 
in the last several years. 
This summer, Brian will retire from 
his role. He will have more time to 
travel, practice for his marathons, and 
watch his beloved St. Louis Cardinals 
play baseball. In addition, he will be 
able to spend time with his sons Justin 
and Ryan and dote on his new grand-
child. I have heard Idaho and Hawaii 
are on the docket for travel plans. I 
hope he will also find time to enjoy his 
favorite mint chocolate chip ice cream 
at The Spotted Cow. 
Wishing our best to one of our best.

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION 
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY 
THAT 
WAS 
ORIGINALLY 
DE-
CLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 
13441 OF AUGUST 1, 2007, WITH 
RESPECT TO LEBANON—PM 11 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To The Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Leb-
anon declared in Executive Order 13441 
of August 1, 2007, is to continue in ef-
fect beyond August 1, 2021. 
Certain ongoing activities, such as 
Iran’s continuing arms transfers to 
Hizballah—which include increasingly 
sophisticated weapons systems—serve 
to undermine Lebanese sovereignty, 
contribute to political and economic 
instability in the region, and continue 
to constitute an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States. 
For this reason, I have determined that 
it is necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13441 with respect to Lebanon.

CLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 
13882 OF JULY 26, 2019, WITH RE-
SPECT TO THE SITUATION IN

from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing,

To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes

tional emergency with respect to the 
situation in Mali declared in Executive 
Order 13882 of July 26, 2019, is to con-
tinue in effect beyond July 26, 2021. 
The situation in Mali, including re-
peated violations of ceasefire arrange-
ments made pursuant to the 2015 
Agreement on Peace and Reconcili-
ation in Mali; the expansion of ter-
rorist activities into southern and cen-
tral Mali; the intensification of drug 
trafficking and trafficking in persons, 
human rights abuses, and hostage-tak-
ing; and the intensification of attacks 
against civilians, the Malian defense 
and security forces, the United Nations 
Multidimensional Integrated Stabiliza-
tion Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), and 
international security presences, con-
tinues to pose an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13882 with respect to the situation in 
Mali.

f 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. TOOMEY, Mr. MENENDEZ, 
and Ms. COLLINS): 
S. 2385. A bill to amend the Clean Air 
Act to eliminate the corn ethanol man-
date for renewable fuel; to the Com-
mittee on Environment and Public 
Works. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President: I 
rise today to reintroduce bipartisan 
legislation. The ‘‘Corn Ethanol Man-
date Elimination Act of 2021’’ is co-
sponsored by Senators PAT
TOOMEY, 
BOB MENENDEZ, and SUSAN COLLINS and 
would end the corn ethanol mandate in 
the Renewable Fuel Standard. 
The mandate requires annual in-
creases in the amount of renewable fuel 
that must be blended into the total 
volume of gasoline refined and con-
sumed in the United States. 
Our bill would amend the Renewable 
Fuel Standard to remove the volume 
requirements for corn ethanol while 
leaving in place the requirement that 
oil companies use low-carbon advanced 
bio fuels, including cellulosic biofuel 
and biodiesel. 
The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) 
was initially included in the Energy 
Policy Act of 2005 and subsequently 
amended in 2007. The RFS sought to re-
duce our dependence on oil and in-
crease production of biofuels for trans-
portation. It requires gasoline and die-
sel producers to blend increasing vol-
umes of renewable biofuels in their 
supply. 
The law includes separate volume re-
quirements 
for 
four 
categories 
of 
biofuels: 1) unspecified (completely 
filled by corn ethanol, also called the 
‘‘corn ethanol mandate’’); 2) advanced 
biofuels; 3) cellulosic biofuel; and 4) 
biodiesel. 
The EPA is authorized to reduce the 
required volumes if supply does not 
match the statutory volume. Every 
year since 2014, the total production of 
all ethanol exceeded the ‘‘blend wall’’— 
the amount of ethanol that can safely 
be blended into the fuel supply, which 
is about 10% of gasoline. A blend be-
yond 10% ethanol can damage car en-
gines. 
Unfortunately, rather than encour-
age the development of more advanced 
biofuels with lower carbon emissions, 
the RFS has resulted in a market 
flooded with ethanol, which has higher 
carbon emissions than other advanced 
biofuels. 
This year oil companies will be re-
quired to use 33 billion gallons of re-
newable fuel, and next year the re-
quirement will increase to 36 billion 
gallons of renewable fuel. 
The original law requires that an in-
creasing portion of this mandate be 
met 
using 
low-carbon 
advanced 
biofuels that are not derived from corn 
starch and reduce lifecycle greenhouse 
gas emissions by at least 50 percent. 
However, last year, 15 billion gallons 
of the statutory requirement was met 
using corn ethanol. 
The corn ethanol mandate is unwise 
and unworkable for several reasons. 
First, the corn ethanol mandate re-
sults in 40% of the U.S. corn crop being 
used for fuel and not food, nearly dou-
ble the rate compared to before the 
RFS was passed. Ethanol production 
requires 38 million acres of land—an 
area larger than the state of Illinois— 
which could be used to feed 150 million 
people. 
We should prioritize our agriculture 
and land use toward feeding people and 
combating the climate crisis, not per-
petuating it, particularly when severe 
drought threatens crops throughout 
the West. 
Second, the corn ethanol mandate 
has increased the price of corn and 
products made from corn, such as live-
stock feed. This has made it more ex-
pensive for families to put food on 
their table. 
Third, 
corn 
ethanol 
production 
achieves little to no reductions in 
greenhouse gas emissions over regular 
oil and poses other environmental 
risks, including deforestation, habitat 
destruction and diminished water qual-
ity or availability due to cropland ex-
pansion. 
Finally, as fuel economy standards 
and increased vehicle electrification 
drive down gasoline consumption, the 
RFS mandate exceeds the limit at 
which ethanol can be blended safely 
into the fuel supply—roughly 10% of 
total gasoline consumption. 
According to the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency’s final 2013 rule estab-
lishing renewable fuel standards, the 
‘‘EPA does not foresee a scenario in 
which 
the 
market 
could 
consume 
enough ethanol . . . to meet the vol-
umes . . . stated in the statute.’’ 
The Congressional Budget Office con-
firmed this judgment in a June 2014 re-
port, saying that the statutory goal of 
escalating corn ethanol volumes would 
be ‘‘very hard to meet in future years.’’ 
The Corn Ethanol Mandate Elimi-
nation Act would make necessary fixes 
to the Renewable Fuel Standard, re-
ducing our reliance on corn ethanol. 
Our bill would address the blend wall 
directly, thereby allowing EPA to con-
tinue increasing volumes of lowcarbon 
advanced biofuels. 
It would also maintain important 
provisions that encourage the develop-
ment of low-carbon advanced biofuels, 
like cellulosic ethanol, algae-based fuel 
and biodiesel. 
This would increase the market for 
the innovative, nascent, domestic in-
dustry that this statute was designed 
to support. 
The Federal corn ethanol mandate no 
longer makes sense when better, lower- 
carbon alternatives exist. I urge my 
colleagues to join us in passing this im-
portant legislation to eliminate the 
corn ethanol mandate in the Renew-
able Fuel Standard. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor. 
By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Ms. 
DUCKWORTH, Mr. WICKER, Mr. 
CRAMER, Mr. LANKFORD, Mr.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
rise once again to call for every Sen-
ator to have the chance to vote on the 
Military Justice Improvement and In-
creasing Prevention Act. It is time for 
us to move serious crimes, like sexual 
assault and murder, out of the chain of 
command and put them in the hands of 
the most capable people in the military 
to do this: independent, impartial, 
highly trained uniformed prosecutors. 
I want to first acknowledge and ex-
press my gratitude to my colleagues on 
the Armed Services Subcommittee on 
Personnel who recognize the impor-
tance of this legislation and this morn-
ing voted to include it as an amend-
ment to the Senate Armed Services 
Personnel Subcommittee markup of 
the NDAA. 
The reason we are calling for this re-
form is because our current system is 
just not working for our servicemem-
bers. It is not delivering justice on the 
values of justice and equality that they 
have sacrificed so much to defend. We 
are here to serve them. Any reform 
that we should make should be made 
with their best interests in mind. 
So while I am glad that so many of 
our colleagues are now looking for 
ways to help survivors of sexual as-
sault in the military, we must help 
them by starting to listen to them and 
what they are saying about the justice 
they want delivered. 
If we move just sexual assault and re-
lated crimes out of the chain of com-
mand, we are ignoring the voices of the 
very people whom we are trying to 
help. Survivors have asked for all seri-
ous crimes to be taken out of the chain 
of command. They have told us time 
and time again that they do not want 
to be further isolated, further dimin-
ished, by being given special treat-
ment. They do not want to have a sepa-
rate judicial system. The request is 
clear: Do not create a pink court, a 
court that will be perceived by other 
servicemembers 
as 
only 
serving 
women. While we know that many sex-
ual assault survivors are men, the per-
ception in the military will be reality, 
and it will be seen as marginalizing and 
minimizing women servicemembers. 
It is our obligation to listen to the 
men and women we are serving and to 
do our job. Creating a bifurcated sys-
tem will not only silence survivors’ 
voices; it will silence the voices of the 
enlisted 
servicemembers 
who 
have 
asked us to provide basic fairness. 
Our servicemembers recognize that, 
intentionally or not, a commander who 
knows both the accuser and the victim 
cannot remove bias from decision mak-
ing. Our servicemembers have told us 
that they lack faith in the current sys-
tem, which leaves serious crimes and, 
potentially, 
serious 
sentences 
with 
commanders who are not trained law-
yers. 
We have to listen to the men and 
women in uniform who have asked us 
to ensure that their cases will be de-
cided by an independent, highly trained 
military prosecutor if they are going to 
face prosecution that can lead to more 
than a year of confinement. 
I ask my colleagues who are in favor 
of moving just sexual assault and re-
lated crimes out of the chain of com-
mand: Why should some crimes be han-
dled by better lawyers than others? 
Don’t we want all serious crimes to be 
given serious consideration by a JAG 
with criminal justice experience? Don’t 
all of our servicemembers deserve a 
professionalized judicial system? 
As Senator HAWLEY, a former pros-
ecutor, 
this 
morning 
in 
our 
sub-
committee hearing, said: 
[W]hen we have service men and women 
who have had serious crimes committed 
against them—felony crimes, as are ad-
dressed in this bill—it is absolutely impera-
tive that: justice is done to these men and 
women, is done for them; that the procedures 
and standards that they can expect are uni-
form and predictable; [and] that trained 
military prosecutors make the final call as 
to whether or not . . . these cases will go for-
ward for prosecution. And the reason for that 
is we want the evidence to be weighed by the 
prosecutor—the individual, the woman or 
the man—who is going to be presenting this 
to a jury, to a judge in the system. . . . 
That’s a predictable system. I think it is one 
that both defendants and victims can sup-
port because the rules are uniform—it’s 
across the board, it’s is analogous to our ci-
vilian system but still, of course, stays with-
in the military system of justice. 
Many of our colleagues brought re-
newed attention to the need for mili-
tary justice after the tragic murder of 
SPC Vanessa Guillen. Her case shows 
us that a bifurcated system that leaves 
some crimes with prosecutors and some 
crimes with commanders will not de-
liver justice. 
Specialist Guillen was sexually har-
assed by one soldier and then murdered 
by another. If we remove just sexual 
assault and related crimes from the 
chain of command, only her harasser’s 
case would be handled by a prosecutor. 
Her murderer’s case would not. It 
would be left in the hands of the same 
command that so deeply mishandled 
her case that her murderer was able to 
flee the base and end his own life. Her 
family, as a consequence, will never 
have justice. 
We have heard from voices inside the 
Pentagon 
who 
have 
resisted 
this 
change for far too long. We cannot let 
them continue to drown out the voices 
of the people in the military justice 
system whom they are supposed to 
serve. We must listen to the voices of 
the enlisted. They have asked us to 
make this reform and to put all serious 
crimes in the hands of highly trained, 
impartial, professional military pros-
ecutors. 
That is what the Military Justice Im-
provement and Increasing Prevention 
Act would do. Every day it is delayed is 
another 
day 
our 
servicemembers’ 
voices are silenced. It is time to listen 
to them and bring this legislation to 
the floor for a vote. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that at a time to be determined by

the majority leader in consultation 
with the Republican leader, the Senate 
Armed Services Committee be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 1520 and the Senate proceed to its 
consideration; that there be 2 hours for 
debate, equally divided in the usual 
form; and that upon the use or yielding 
back of that time, the Senate vote on 
the bill with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, I first want 
to begin by complimenting my friend 
and colleague Senator GILLIBRAND of 
New York, who has been working dili-
gently—and we all know it—for 10 
years, a decade, on this issue, particu-
larly the issue of sexual assault and 
the related crimes in our military. 
There is nobody who has been more fo-
cused on it, and I applaud her for her 
relentless efforts—relentless. And I 
have a lot of respect for her. 
She has been coming to the floor 
every night here for the last 3 or 4 
weeks and trying to move her bill. I am 
going to talk about her bill a little bit 
more and why I and others, in a bipar-
tisan way—the chairman of the Armed 
Services, the ranking member of the 
Armed Services, and others—have been 
coming to the floor to object. 
But I also want to say that I care 
deeply—deeply—about this issue for 
two very important reasons. No. 1, the 
issue of sexual assault, domestic vio-
lence, is an enormous problem in 
America but is a huge problem in my 
State, the great State of Alaska. And 
since my time as attorney general and 
now my time as a U.S. Senator, I have 
been very focused on these issues. And 
I think, again, Senator GILLIBRAND has 
done an outstanding job, not just on 
the military ones but on a whole broad- 
based number of these kinds of bills 
that focus on the issues of domestic vi-
olence and sexual assault. And I have 
been proud to work with her on a num-
ber of them—my bills, her bills—some 
of which have become law. 
So as Alaska’s Senator, I have been 
100-percent focused on this issue for 
American society, certainly for Alaska, 
which is a big, big problem that con-
tinues to impact millions of Americans 
and tens of thousands of my constitu-
ents. So we need to do something about 
it. I agree, not just for the military but 
for the country. And I am committed 
to continuing the work; for example, 
my ‘‘Choose Respect’’ series of bills 
that we have here in the U.S. Senate 
that I am working on with Senator 
GILLIBRAND. 
The other reason I care about this 
issue—and there is no monopoly, by 
the way, on people who care about the 
troops—is that I have a 28-year career 
in the U.S. Marine Corps and still serv-
ing. I have been a commander, and I 
care deeply about every single member 
in the military, the challenges of sex-
ual assault that we have, which are 
very real, which, again, Senator GILLI-
BRAND has done such a good job to 
highlight and to have good order and 
discipline in our military, which is part 
of the UCMJ, which is one of the rea-
sons why this issue has taken so long 
and has been a challenge. 
Now, the issue that Senator GILLI-
BRAND is talking about right now, we 
will be debating in the full committee 
in the Armed Services starting tomor-
row. Actually, we are starting today, 
as she mentioned, in the Personnel 
Subcommittee today. This, again, a lot 
of the credit—most of the credit—I give 
to Senator GILLIBRAND on this issue. 
We will have a fulsome debate, prob-
ably all day, on this issue tomorrow. 
And if her bill, which is often under-
stood as removing these issues of sex-
ual assault and violent crimes relating 
to sexual crimes, was the bill that will 
be passed tomorrow, I will be sup-
portive, removing that out of the chain 
of command. That is what many, many 
Senators—and I have had discussions 
with them—believe that the primary 
focus of her legislation is and has been. 
She has convinced now the Secretary 
of Defense and the President of the 
United States and the members of the 
Joint Chiefs. And if that is what the 
bill was, she would have very, very 
broad-based support. And I applaud her 
for that. That victory would be hers 
more than anyone’s. In terms of legis-
lation, of course, I think it will help 
our troops. Will it ultimately solve this 
problem, which is a problem in our 
country and in our military, a huge 
problem? I think it will help. 
My view, as someone who under-
stands the military well, is that it is 
not going to be solved until we have 
leaders who take this issue very seri-
ously. That is what we need more than 
anything, and I think our leadership in 
the military is starting to do this, but 
more needs to happen. 
So that would be what most of us 
think has been the focus of her legisla-
tion for 10 years and what would be the 
result likely to come out of committee 
as early as tomorrow, carving out 
these issues, not creating pink courts 
but creating a professional class of 
prosecutors and defense attorneys who 
know these issues, which are often 
challenging. 
Senator 
GILLIBRAND 
knows this. ‘‘He said, she said’’ kinds of 
accusations often are at the heart of 
these horrible crimes. And to have that 
for men and women—so there is no 
pink court there, by the way—to have 
that class of cases removed from the 
chain of command for all of the reasons 
she and others have been arguing, if 
that is the result tomorrow, I think it 
is going to get strong bipartisan sup-
port and support from the administra-
tion. 
Unfortunately, that is not where the 
bill is. As she is now indicating, this 
bill would remove all crimes, all felo-
nies—1 year in jail, anything; a bar 
fight, anything. In terms of the com-
mander’s ability to have good order 
and discipline, all of that under this 
legislation would be covered—1-year 
felony. And in many people’s view—in 
my view, certainly—and in the chair-
man of the committee’s view, and the 
ranking member’s view, and many oth-
ers, this is a hugely broad reworking of 
the UCMJ, probably one of the most 
dramatic reworkings of the Uniform 
Code of Military Justice ever. 
Now, why are Senator GILLIBRAND 
and others making the argument? 
What she has been doing—she didn’t 
come down here today, but I have been 
reading her speeches. She has been es-
sentially saying we need this broad 
carve-out for every crime, every felony 
in the chain of command because of ra-
cial problems in the military. 
This is a new argument. She and I 
have talked about it. This is a dra-
matic argument. This is essentially 
saying what she said in a recent 
speech: 
It 
is 
‘‘necessary’’—1 
year 
more—‘‘because the current military 
justice system is simply not delivering 
justice, especially not to servicemem-
bers of color.’’ This is a big claim. 
What Senator GILLIBRAND has been 
doing with her previous legislation—8 
to 10 years of data to back it up on the 
sexual assault issues. Again, I applaud 
her on that. She has been dogged. She 
has gotten data. She has searched for 
data herself. But this new argument 
basing this whole broad-based revamp-
ing of the whole UCMJ based on the 
fact that she is now claiming the mili-
tary justice system of the United 
States cannot serve minority members 
has not been backed up by data—has 
not been backed up by data. 
She cites three studies, recent stud-
ies. Again, this is a new argument. A 
lot of my colleagues say: Whoa. I didn’t 
sign up for that bill thinking it was 
based on some kind of broad-based sys-
temic racism in the military. But that 
is the new argument. We need to get 
that right before we claim that every 
member of the military, every com-
mander, is somehow a racist. Even the 
studies that she has now focused on are 
saying that disparity is not proof of ra-
cial discrimination. 
The U.S. Air Force—one of the stud-
ies that she has talked about says: 
While the presence of disparity alone is not 
evidence of racism, discrimination, or dis-
parate treatment, it presents a concern that 
requires more in-depth analysis. 
I fully agree with that. 
Last year, when we were debating the 
NDAA, there was an issue that came to 
my attention about how we had very 
senior 
military 
members, 
four-star 
generals, who were not making the 
rank. We have a Service Chief right 
now, General Brown, who is the first 
African-American Service Secretary, 
Indian Services. When I talked to him, 
that was disturbing to me. I put for-
ward legislation saying: Why is that? 
What is going on with our military? 
Let’s figure that out.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4986 
July 20, 2021 
What I am saying to Senator GILLI-
BRAND is and what the Air Force is say-
ing is, if this is a problem, let’s figure 
that out. 
The GAO study that she cites says 
this: 
These findings show an association for dis-
parities at particular stages of the military 
justice process, but are inconclusive regard-
ing other stages. However, GAO’s findings of 
racial disparities, taken alone, do not estab-
lish whether unlawful discrimination has oc-
curred, as that is a legal determination that 
would involve other corroborating informa-
tion and supporting statistics. 
Again, is there a challenging dis-
parity right now that Senator GILLI-
BRAND has been highlighting? I believe 
so. Is it proof that the UCMJ is some-
how systemically racist and needs this 
broad-based change? That is what she 
has been arguing on the Senate floor. 
Unlike her other argument on sexual 
assault and the crimes that we have 
seen over the years where there is 8 to 
10 years of data that we have all been 
looking at—again, a lot to her credit— 
this is something that needs much, 
much more data before we make broad- 
based claims. For example, some of 
those who are supporting her bill sent 
out this supporting blog post that they 
said was supporting the legislation, the 
broad-based legislation. This was from 
the Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Lib-
erties Law Review. This has been put 
out by staff to support her broad-based 
legislation. It says: 
Almost all military disciplinary action oc-
curs at the discretion of military officers, 
and with over 75% of the officer corps [being] 
white, systemic bias is not just a function of 
military justice, it’s a foregone conclusion. 
That is a pretty broad statement. 
That is a pretty broad statement. 
Where is the data to back that up? In 
essence, because you are a White com-
mander, you are not going to give jus-
tice to minorities? I find that offensive 
as a commander who has commanded 
all kinds of Alaska Natives, African 
Americans, Hispanics, Whites. 
So we can’t base this broad-based leg-
islation—all 
felonies—on 
this 
rel-
atively new claim that does not have 
data supporting it that somehow we 
need to revamp the entire UCMJ be-
cause White commanders are racist. I 
don’t think we should do it. 
I want to work with Senator GILLI-
BRAND on these and other issues tomor-
row. It will be an important debate. I 
am hopeful that the years of her hard 
work and data on this issue are going 
to result in a carve-out for sexual as-
sault and related crimes of violence 
that will be bipartisan. It will be sup-
ported by the Secretary of Defense, the 
Service Secretaries. Again, I think 
Senator GILLIBRAND
will deserve an 
enormous amount of credit for her de-
termination over a decade to make 
that happen. But with regard to the 
broader legislation that she has asked 
for unanimous consent on, for the rea-
sons I just discussed, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, 
my colleague has made some serious 
misstatements and allegations in his 
remarks. 
I never said White commanders are 
racist, nor would I ever. In fact, all I 
have done is cite 3 years of evidence 
published by the Department of De-
fense about disparities in sentencing 
and punishment, with the Marines, for 
example, having 2.61 times more likely 
to be punished for Black servicemem-
bers versus White servicemembers. It is 
DOD data. It is DOD information. 
As the Senator knows, this bill was 
written 8 years ago, and the reason it 
was written with a bright line was for 
three reasons. 
The first is that our allies already 
have done this. They created a bright 
line of felonies for both plaintiffs’ and 
defendants’ 
rights—the 
UK, 
Israel, 
Canada, Germany, Netherlands, and 
Australia. They did this because they 
believed servicemembers deserve basic 
civil liberties. The commander is not a 
trained lawyer. They thought a trained 
military prosecutor should make those 
decisions for serious crimes. 
We were told by every military jus-
tice expert available that to do any-
thing less than a bright line would be a 
terrible disservice to the UCMJ, that 
bright lines work, that bright lines are 
necessary, and that having the bright 
line be a punishment of more than a 
year would serve the servicemembers 
better. 
Second, we heard from servicemem-
bers, particularly female servicemem-
bers. And I know there is a lot of 
mansplaining in this body, but JONI 
ERNST is the only female combat com-
mander 
Republican 
in 
this 
body. 
TAMMY DUCKWORTH is the only female 
combat veteran Democrat in this body. 
They helped to write this legislation, 
and when they wrote it, they said this: 
They said women in the military are 
often marginalized, and the perception, 
dear colleague, is that although men 
are sexually assaulted, more often than 
not, it is the women who come forward. 
More often than not, they will asso-
ciate a sexual assault procedure and 
process that is unique to be specialized 
treatment. 
JONI ERNST is not only a combat vet-
eran, she is also a sexual assault sur-
vivor. So I don’t think you can put 
yourself in her shoes, nor should you 
try to. This is legislation that she 
worked hard over the last 6 years with 
me on to tailor it, to narrow it. 
Bar fights are excluded specifically 
because JONI ERNST knows as a com-
mander that bar fights are prevalent, 
and we don’t want to have to deal with 
bar fights when we are talking about 
serious felonies. They are carved out. 
They are carved out as to all military 
crimes. 
The reason why this bright line of 
felonies protects servicemembers is be-
cause—you know this, dear colleague. 
You know that in domestic violence 
cases, often other serious crimes are at 
play. We have a case where a boyfriend 
and girlfriend—the girlfriend breaks up 
with the boyfriend, and he shoots her 
dead. Her case would not be taken to a 
special commander—excuse me—a spe-
cial prosecutor because she was mur-
dered. 
Vanessa Guillen. Her case would not 
have the benefit of a special prosecutor 
because she was murdered. 
We have another case just published 
last week, a domestic violence case 
where a servicemember is beating his 
wife. A neighbor hears the screams and 
intervenes to try to protect her. The 
servicemember shoots the neighbor, 
who is killed. The commander decides 
that that is a stand-your-ground case, 
and he decides not to prosecute, and all 
that happens is that servicemember is 
moved. He is moved. So the next time 
he is beating his wife and she finally 
reports, that evidence of the murder 
isn’t even in his case file. It is nowhere 
to be found. So they don’t protect her. 
She doesn’t get special review. 
You need other serious crimes to be 
part of this; otherwise, they won’t nec-
essarily get the proper review. I know 
that you don’t want to include serious 
crimes like check fraud or stealing or 
arson because you are like, what does 
this have to do with sexual assault? 
The truth is, in many cases of domestic 
violence, arson is used to cover up the 
crime. In many cases, when you have a 
domestic violence victim, 99 percent of 
them, their spouse or their partner 
used money as a way to isolate them. 
They use it to create dominance. They 
will steal her money. They will steal 
her credit card. If you don’t have a spe-
cialized prosecutor look at the case, 
the commander might say: You took 
her checkbook; stop doing that. That is 
ridiculous. He won’t even know this is 
something that happens in domestic vi-
olence cases all the time. 
There are a lot of reasons. We wrote 
it this way because the military ex-
perts told us. 
The issue of race has come up re-
cently because the DOD started taking 
data. But the Air Force, you must 
know, started taking data about 20 
years ago. In 1972, the Nixon adminis-
tration had a task force specifically 
about this issue and found disparities. 
All we have done is cited the dispari-
ties as confirmation that if you fix the 
whole system, maybe you can fix other 
problems too. 
But make no mistake, it was written 
this way initially specifically to end 
sexual violence. This Commission that 
President Biden asked for and Sec-
retary Austin supports, every crime 
they looked at, every single one, they 
took and said it had to be taken out of 
the chain of command, not just sexual 
assault but sexual harassment, domes-
tic violence, child abuse, trafficking of 
children, all of these related things. 
They looked at these and said these 
kinds of cases all need to be taken out. 
They didn’t look at murder. They 
didn’t look at the other serious crimes 
because it wasn’t their mission. 
I stand ready to work with you, Sen-
ator SULLIVAN, on a bipartisan, com-
monsense solution, but to say that just

because you have the chairman and the 
ranking member, that somehow you 
have the moral authority here—I dis-
agree. I disagree because we have 66 
Members on this bill and another 5 or 
6 who would vote for this. So that is 
about 70 Members who have stated 
they want to do this bright line. 
I have been very forthright with 
every Senator whom I have spoken to 
about why this bill is written the way 
it is. We don’t want to marginalize 
women. We don’t want them to be per-
ceived as getting special treatment. We 
just want to professionalize the whole 
system. 
I can tell you, when we talk to com-
manders who are fighting wars in Iraq 
and Afghanistan and they have to do 
the analysis of a highly complex crime, 
it distracts them from the work of 
training troops and winning wars. So 
why not give these hard issues, just the 
felonies, to the smartest military pros-
ecutor we can find? 
Why not fix the system for all plain-
tiffs and all defendants? Why just draw 
out just one set of plaintiffs and one 
set of defendants? 
I know this will not undermine good 
order and discipline because Secretary 
Austin said, taking out sexual assault- 
related crimes does not undermine 
good order and discipline; it does not 
undermine 
command 
and 
control. 
When asking the Chairwoman of this 
Commission whether taking out seri-
ous crimes would undermine command 
and control, she said absolutely not. So 
I believe this is the right answer. I 
have believed it was the right answer 
for 8 years. 
Every year, I have asked my col-
leagues to look at the bill, study the 
bill, give me questions on the bill. 
When colleagues have wanted to shave 
off crimes because they thought they 
didn’t rise to the level of a serious 
crime, like a bar fight, we have taken 
it out. We took out all military crimes 
because the commander has a unique 
understanding of those crimes. We have 
worked so hard for 8 years to do this 
one solution, and to imply that it is all 
new or it is only about this one set of 
data is so inappropriate and wrong. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. HAS-
SAN). The Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
just want to again compliment my col-
league from New York, who has worked 
this issue hard. It is an emotional 
issue. I think we all have good inten-
tions on this issue. We all want to get 
to the right answer for men and women 
in the military as it relates to these 
crimes and still have a force. As she 
said, it is the best military fighting 
force in the world. 
I think we are going to have a good 
debate on this tomorrow, and I am cer-
tainly committed to continuing to 
work with Senator GILLIBRAND
on 
these issues as they relate to the mili-
tary and as they relate to the civilian 
world. They are enormously important, 
and I take them very seriously. 
Again, I want to applaud her for her 
passion, her focus, her commitment. 
We wouldn’t be this far in this debate 
at all if it weren’t for her, and I have a 
lot of respect for that. 
I yield the floor. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I just want to thank the Senator 
and my colleague for his tireless work 
on this issue, and I do stand ready to 
work with him because I know how 
much he cares about the issue. He has 
led great reforms in his State of Alas-
ka, and I believe, if his voice were lent 
to this issue, it would be unanimous. 
So I thank the Presiding Officer, and 
I thank my colleague from Alaska.

The Senator from Florida. 
f 
CUBA 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, we 
have heard more about Cuba in the last 
week than probably the 10 years that I 
have been here combined. 
And yesterday we heard from the 
White House. The White House was 
having some sort of a meeting and con-
ference call and came out and said that 
they are going to be looking at remit-
tances and increasing and making it 
easier to get money to relatives in 
Cuba. 
That is not surprising. The people in 
charge of Cuba policy at the White 
House, at the National Security Coun-
cil, and at the State Department—the 
people in charge of Cuba policy have 
long been advocates for dialogue with 
the regime and an economic opening to 
the regime. They have been for getting 
rid of the embargo and that sort of 
thing. 
I think it is important, given the fact 
that I recognize that most people in 
this country and in the Senate don’t 
follow this issue on a regular basis, 
that we address that. Because the fun-
damental question being put to us is— 
so the people of Cuba are suffering. The 
people of Cuba are going through a dif-
ficult economic time. I would argue 
that they have done so for 62 years— 
why don’t we get rid of the embargo? It 
would make life easier for them. 
And I want to address it. I want to 
address it especially to those who are 
not as familiar with this issue. 
First of all, let me begin by saying 
there are no American ships block-
ading Cuba, surrounding the island of 
Cuba. In fact, Cuba, frankly, does not 
have an embargo in the way people 
think. 
Cuba trades with the whole world. 
For example, Cuba, every year, exports 
$1.2 billion, which doesn’t sound like a 
lot, but it is a lot for an island of 11 
million people. OK? 
They export $461 million to China; 
$127 million to Spain; $65 million to the 
Netherlands; $64 million to Germany. 
This is not a country that is isolated. 
They trade with every country in the 
world. 
They import $5.3 billion a year. With 
Spain alone, they export—they import, 
I am sorry, $1 billion from Spain; an-
other $790 million from China; $327 mil-
lion from Italy; $285 million from Can-
ada and from Russia. 
So they import 5—over $5 billion. 
They export over $1.2 billion. Cuba is 
not isolated. They trade with every 
country—this regime trades with vir-
tually every country on the planet. 
You know who else they trade with? 
The United States of America. Cuba 
trades with the United States of Amer-
ica. They import almost $280 million a 
year; almost as much as they do with 
Canada and Russia. And no one accuses 
Canada and Russia of having a block-
ade on Cuba. 
Sixty-six percent of the chicken that 
is eaten in Cuba, which is the staple 
protein in Cuba, comes from the United 
States. Half their soybeans come from 
the United States. 
There is only one blockade in Cuba, 
and it is the blockade that this regime 
has imposed upon its people. 
Now, yesterday, the President an-
nounced—or 
the 
White 
House 
an-
nounced they are going to stand up 
some remittances group to try to fig-
ure out: So how do we make it easier 
for relatives to send money to their 
relatives on the island of Cuba? 
Well, that work group is going to not 
have a long time to meet. They are not 
going to have to meet for very long be-
cause U.S. law allows that now. It is 
not illegal to send money to your rel-
atives in Cuba. 
The only thing that is prohibited is 
you can’t send the money—you can’t 
send the money through this bank that 
the Cuban military set up in Panama. 
That is the only thing that is prohib-
ited. 
And to the extent money can’t reach 
the people of Cuba, it is because they 
refuse to allow anyone other than that 
bank to do these remittances. 
And, by the way, they have prohib-
ited depositing dollars. Here is how it 
works for them: You send your relative 
$100. They take 10 percent of it. Then 
they take the dollars—they don’t let 
them deposit it. They pocket the dol-
lars, and they give them this worthless 
Cuban currency. So they have the dol-
lars so they can buy things for them-
selves and on the global market. 
So the blockade, to the extent that 
there is something that is preventing 
remittances directly to the Cuban peo-
ple, it is not U.S. policy; it is regime 
policy. They are the ones who need a 
work group. 
How about this argument that there 
is a blockade on travel? If only more 
American tourists could go to Cuba. 
By the way, Cuba is already filled 
with Canadian tourists and Italian 
tourists who enjoy 5-star accommoda-
tions. And I will be frank, many of 
them go there—these sick, disgusting 
men who go there to hook up with a 16- 
or 17-year-old girl. 
But that said, they talk about travel 
to Cuba. Well, let me tell you some-
thing. Travel is allowed now. An Amer-
ican can go to Cuba. You just can’t 
stay at a military-owned hotel or eat 
at a military-owned restaurant or shop 
at a military-owned store. You can 
stay at the private homes of people 
who rent them out on Airbnb. You can 
do that. You can eat at a restaurant 
that is owned by a private person. You 
can shop at stores that are owned by 
private people. 
The reason why they have nowhere to 
stay, nowhere to eat, and nowhere to 
shop is not U.S. policy. It is that the 
Cuban regime won’t allow privately 
owned hotels, privately owned shops, 
privately owned stores. They won’t 
allow it—privately owned restaurants. 
They are the ones who have a blockade 
on travel, not the United States. 
What about medicine? That is an-
other thing they have put out there. 
This is so cruel. We don’t allow medi-
cine in. 
Do you know what the Cuban regime 
announced last week? This is what 
they announced on their national tele-
vision: We are going to lift the ban on 
the importation of medicine. 
What? You mean there was a Cuban 
ban, a regime ban on importing medi-
cine? Yes, there was. They are the ones 
who weren’t allowing medicine in. And 
to the extent they were allowing it in, 
they were putting a tariff on it. So 
there is no blockade on medicine. We 
sell them medicine. 
And you can donate medicine, unlim-
ited amounts, under U.S. law. If there 
is a blockade on medicine, it is the re-
gime’s blockade. 
The other one I hear is the internet. 
I support the internet. Why don’t we 
allow—I had somebody say this to me 
yesterday: Why don’t we allow Amer-
ican companies to go and provide inter-
net, then they would have internet? It 
is the embargo. 
And these people don’t know what 
they are talking about. They literally 
are just parroting stupid, ridiculous 
talking points, because the law in the 
U.S. on trade with Cuba specifically ex-
empts 
telecoms. 
AT&T, 
Verizon, 
Sprint, every American telecom could 
go into Cuba tomorrow and offer phone 
and internet service. 
You know why they can’t? Not our 
law. It is the Cuban regime because 
they want to control that. 
And you see a pattern here. Blockade 
on travel, blockade on private owner-
ship of business, blockade on bringing 
in medicine, blockade on bringing in 
money. Why? 
Because the Cuban regime wants to 
control people. They don’t want an in-
dividual Cuban to have a paycheck 
that they earn for themselves. They 
want what little you have to come 
from them because if you don’t do what 
they tell you, they can take it from 
you. That is what they want. 
They don’t want you to have internet 
companies offered by AT&T and Sprint

and Verizon or anybody else because 
they want to be able to shut it off when 
you are saying things they don’t like 
and things against them. 
Same with medicine. They use all of 
these things as a tool. It is hard to 
fathom because we live here, but they 
use all of it as a tool. You want medi-
cine? Are you posting stuff on the 
internet? 
Are 
you 
saying 
things 
against the regime? Are you speaking 
out? Are you not participating in these 
acts of repudiation that we force people 
to do? Because if you don’t, you are not 
going to get your medicine. 
And they certainly don’t want the 
cash flowing around. They don’t want 
independent 
ownership. 
They 
don’t 
want the people of Cuba to have lib-
erty. This is all about control, all 
about control. 
And, by the way, in the law that 
codified the embargo, it has a clause 
that automatically triggers the end of 
the embargo. And you want to know 
what this tough standard is that is in 
the law? Free the political prisoners, 
free press, free and fair elections, 
multiparty elections. If the regime 
does those three things, the embargo 
ends automatically, automatically. 
There is no embargo on Cuba. There 
is an embargo on Cuban regime, an em-
bargo on companies they own, because 
what they wanted to do is they wanted 
to take the Obama opening, funnel all 
that money through their companies— 
people say there are Spanish companies 
that own hotels. They don’t own the 
hotels in Cuba. The regime owns the 
hotels. 
These hotel chains that open in Cuba 
on the beaches, they don’t even pay 
their employees. They pay the Cuban 
Government. The Cuban Government 
pays the employees. Control. 
So the bottom line is this: Anybody 
who stands up and says there is an em-
bargo, there is a blockade by the 
United States, and it is cruel and it is 
causing all these problems is one of 
two things: They don’t know what they 
are talking about and they are just 
parroting some talking point or they 
are liars. Those are the only two op-
tions. 
This is not about an embargo. The 
people of Cuba did not take to the 
streets, did not have their heads 
cracked open, did not have their kids 
arrested and put in jail. Mothers, to-
morrow, plan to march in Cuba because 
they don’t know where their children 
are; arrested. They don’t know where 
their kids are. 
They 
broke 
into 
homes. 
They 
grabbed 16-year-old boys, they gave 
them a bat. They said: You are going 
halfway across the country to beat peo-
ple up in the street. 
They didn’t stand up against all 
those things because of an embargo or 
because they wanted remittances. They 
stood up because they wanted liberty, 
libertad. That is what they wanted. 
That is what they are telling us. 
Why don’t we listen to them? They 
have told us what they want. They 
want libertad. They want liberty. And 
if there are any people on this Earth 
that should understand that, it should 
be Americans. 
I yield the floor.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 25TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE SOUTHEAST 
MICHIGAN 
COMMUNITY 
ALLI-
ANCE 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 20, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 25th anniversary of the 
Southeast Michigan Community Alliance, a 
non-profit based in Taylor, Michigan. Their 
over two decades of service and dedication to 
southeast Michigan’s workers, businesses, 
and to the local community is worthy of com-
mendation. 
Since its founding in 1996, The Southeast 
Michigan Community Alliance (SEMCA) has 
helped countless Michigan residents find jobs 
each year. Through their partnership with local 
employers, hosting of job fairs and talent de-
velopment programs, SEMCA has given thou-
sands of job seekers the skills they need to 
succeed. Their youth programs and career 
planning tools have helped prepare the next 
generation for successful careers, and their 
veterans programs have ensured that those 
who served our country can find employment 
when their service is over and return home to 
Michigan. SEMCA has helped dozens of local 
businesses fill employment vacancies and has 
stimulated business development and encour-
aged entrepreneurship in our community. 
SEMCA has provided Michigan residents 
with the skills and training they need to suc-
ceed in an ever-changing world. Those who 
come to SEMCA for support leave possessing 
the training and knowledge needed for them to 
get employed and begin their journey towards 
a lifelong career to benefit not only them-
selves, but their whole family. SEMCA’s work 
has had a positive impact on the lives of thou-
sands of Michiganders and has contributed to 
the economic rejuvenation of southeast Michi-
gan, in the 12th district and beyond. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating the 25th anniversary 
of the Southeast Michigan Community Alli-
ance. We are grateful for their impactful work 
and wish SEMCA continued success in the 
years ahead.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. BILL HUIZENGA 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 20, 2021 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today regarding missed votes. Had I been 
present for Roll Call vote number 209, On Mo-
tion to Suspend the Rules and Pass H.R. 826 
Divided Families Reunification Act, I would 
have voted Yea. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF 
HANFORD’S 130TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 20, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the birthday of my hometown, 
the City of Hanford. 
The City of Hanford is celebrating the 130th 
birthday of its historic community. In 1877, the 
Southern Pacific Railway laid lines from the 
small towns of Goshen to Coalinga, and their 
path crossed through a Chinese sheep-
herder’s small camp. This camp was the foun-
dation of the present-day City of Hanford, 
which was named after James Madison Han-
ford, the auditor of the railroad. 
James Madison Hanford advanced the small 
community by offering sales of town lots and 
grew Hanford to more than just a settlement. 
With the contribution of the railroad, Hanford 
became the trading center of the area and 
eventually, the bustling Central Valley town it 
is today. Today, Hanford has a population of 
60,000 residents and is an agricultural and in-
dustrial hub within the region. Hanford is home 
to a diverse and growing population that not 
only honors their history but looks forward to 
the bright future. 
The City of Hanford has worked hard to up-
hold the strong traditions and unique sense of 
community throughout its growth. Beloved his-
toric sites throughout the city help citizens to 
remember the past while flourishing new en-
terprise demonstrate a promising future. It is 
an honor to represent my lifelong home and 
community, and I look forward to Hanford’s 
continued prosperity. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring the City of Hanford on its 130th birthday.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BYRON 
BERLINE 
HON. RON ESTES 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 20, 2021 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, Byron Berline, 
a genius of bluegrass music, passed away on 
July 10, 2021, after a lifetime of sharing his 
amazing talent on the fiddle and mandolin with 
millions of people worldwide. 
Byron was born on July 6, 1944 in the small 
town of Caldwell in the 4th District of Kansas 
where he began to play the fiddle at age five. 
After serving his country in the U.S. Army, 
Byron quickly rose to musical fame, winning 
three national fiddle competitions and becom-
ing a much sought-after recording artist, studio 
musician, member of the National Fiddler Hall 
of Fame, and frequent festival favorite. Berline 
performed with the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, 
The Eagles, John Denver, Willie Nelson, Elton 
John, Vince Gill, Ricky Skaggs, Bill Monroe, 
and many other notable and international mu-
sicians. His talent was also featured on TV 
and movie soundtracks including Back to the 
Future Part II and Star Trek, to name a few. 
Byron Berline’s biggest fans were the thou-
sands of people who attend the annual Walnut 
Valley Festival in Winfield, Kansas, where 
Byron was a favorite performer on stage and 
in the campgrounds. He leaves a legacy of 
five decades of live and recorded music and 
joyful memories for all those who were 
blessed to enjoy his gift of fiddling.

EMERGENCY REPORTING ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 1250, the Emergency Report-
ing Act, bipartisan legislation I co-authored to 
improve how the Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) reports on and learns from 
the impact of natural disasters on our tele-
communications networks. 
The human impacts of disasters are wors-
ened when our communications infrastructure 
is not resilient and this is an issue Californians 
know all too well. On October 28, 2019, 874 
cell towers were out in California, caused by 
wildfires and power shutoffs. My constituents 
were panicked about not being able to call 9– 
1–1 during emergencies, receive emergency 
alerts, download evacuation maps, or check-in 
on loved ones. This horrific situation led my 
good friend, Congresswoman MATSUI, and me 
to work on this legislation. 
H.R. 1250, the Emergency Reporting Act, 
requires the FCC to hold field hearings after 
disasters, issue preliminary and final reports 
about each disaster, and ensure 9–1–1 cen-
ters know when outages will impact calls they 
may receive. 
Wildfires are becoming more intense and 
more frequent because of climate change. 
Last year, the CZU Lightning Complex Fire 
burned 86,509 acres in my Congressional Dis-
trict, making it the 12th most destructive fire in 
California history. Seventy-seven thousand of 
my constituents were evacuated and the fire 
destroyed nearly 1,500 homes, businesses, 
and other buildings. 
I’ve long called on FCC leadership to visit 
California and hold field hearings following the 
wildfires and associated power shutoffs, and 
many of my colleagues from California have 
done the same. We need to learn from every 
disaster, especially by listening to and learning 
from local public safety leaders, municipal, 
county, and state officials, and members of 
the communities impacted. This should be re-
quired. 
Last Congress, the Energy and Commerce 
Committee Subcommittee on Communications 
and Technology held a hearing on February

27, 2020 on the Emergency Reporting Act. On 
March 10, 2020, the Subcommittee marked up 
the Emergency Reporting Act, and the full 
Committee did so on July 15, 2020. On Sep-
tember 21, 2020, the full House passed the 
bill via voice vote. Sadly, the Senate did not 
take up this critical bill. 
On February 25, 2021, the legislation was 
reintroduced by Reps. DORIS MATSUI, MIKE 
THOMPSON, JARED HUFFMAN, GUS BILIRAKIS, 
and myself. Senators KLOBUCHAR and BURR 
have companion legislation in the Senate. 
H.R. 1250 is critical legislation for Califor-
nians impacted by wildfires. It will also help 
those on the Gulf Coast victimized by hurri-
canes, Midwesterners who’ve had their com-
munities destroyed by tornadoes, and those in 
the Northeast who have experienced far too 
many superstorms. 
I urge my House colleagues to once again 
vote for the Emergency Reporting Act and 
urge the Senate to do so as well.

CENTENNIAL 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
VETERANS 
OF 
FOREIGN 
WARS 
(VFW) 
POST 
805 
IN 
O’FALLON, ILLINOIS 
HON. MIKE BOST 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 20, 2021 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the Centennial Anniversary of SGT. 
Charles A. Fricke VFW Post 805 in O’Fallon, 
Illinois. On July 25, 1921, 25 members of the 
United States of America VFW established the 
Erwin L. Dann VFW Post 805 in Waterloo, 
which moved to East St. Louis and consoli-
dated with two other posts in 1927. Sergeant 
Dann, a Waterloo native, was 22 years old 
when he was killed during the Meuse-Argonne 
Offensive on September 26, 1918. A genera-
tion later, a separate group of East St. Louis 
veterans returned home from World War II 
and established SGT. Charles A. Fricke VFW 
Post 8475 on October 15, 1946. Sergeant 
Charles A. ‘‘Chub’’ Fricke was one of 18 em-
ployees of the city’s Alcoa Aluminum Ore Fac-
tory who perished during the war. He was 
mortally injured by a mortar shell during the 
Battle of Anizo, passing away four days later 
at the age of 20. On April 29, 1987, the two 
posts were consolidated into one, based in 
O’Fallon. In order to preserve the legacy of 
both posts, they maintained the number from 
the longer-tenured post, 805, and carried the 
name from the other, SGT. Charles A. Fricke. 
Today, SGT. Charles A Fricke VFW Post 805 
has about 600 members and is the largest 
VFW Post in the 14th District of the Depart-
ment of Illinois. Several times over the last 
100 years, VFW Post 805 has been des-
ignated as an All-State and All-American VFW 
Post, including in 2021. In 2018–2019, Post 
805 was selected as one of 61 posts out of 
6200 worldwide to be recognized as a Na-
tional Outstanding Community Service Post. 
One of the most active and successful VFW 
Posts in Illinois, members work together to 
serve and support fellow veterans, their fami-
lies, and the community. They have organized 
blood drives and maintain one of the most ac-
tive and prestigious Honor Guard and Color 
Guard teams in the St. Louis metropolitan 
area. Madam Speaker, please join me in hon-
oring the SGT. Charles A. Fricke VFW Post 
805 on their milestone Centennial Anniversary. 
On behalf of Southern Illinois, I thank them for 
their service, and happy anniversary.

APPRECIATING DONALD 
RUMSFELD 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 20, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, America has lost a Patriot with the 
death of former Defense Secretary Donald 
Rumsfeld, the youngest Secretary when serv-
ing in the Gerald Ford Administration and the 
eldest in the George W. Bush Administration. 
His service has been successful in protecting 
American families by defeating terrorists over-
seas. The Wall Street Journal on July 1st, edi-
torialized his dedication for America: 
DONALD H. RUMSFELD 
Few men have had more consequential ca-
reers in public and private life than Donald 
Rumsfeld, the senior adviser to three Presi-
dents and business executive, who died Tues-
day at age 88. 
A conservative Midwesterner, he served in 
the Navy and won a seat in Congress from Il-
linois in 1962. Richard Nixon spotted his tal-
ent and brought him in as an adviser. His 
star rose quickly and he became chief of staff 
and then secretary of Defense for Gerald 
Ford, the youngest Pentagon chief at age 43. 
Outside of politics, Rummy, as he was 
sometimes known, was the CEO of G.D. 
Searle, the pharmaceutical firm, from 1977– 
1985 and advised Gilead Sciences in its early 
days as a director and chairman of the board. 
Rumsfeld was most controversial during 
his second stint as Defense secretary in man-
aging the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He 
pressed the military to refine its invasion 
plans that in both cases achieved their goals 
quickly and with few casualties. But he un-
derestimated the strength and nature of the 
insurgency in Iraq, and he failed to change 
strategy. President George W. Bush didn’t 
help by failing to settle disputes between 
State and Defense. Mr. Bush replaced Rums-
feld in 2006 to implement the surge that pre-
vented a U.S. defeat. 
Rumsfeld didn’t suffer naifs, or journalists, 
gladly. But we always enjoyed the give and 
take and learned a great deal listening to 
him. He was a patriot willing to challenge 
recalcitrant bureaucracies, which we need 
more of today.

ROBERT

HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 20, 2021 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to thank Springfield Township Police 
Chief Robert Browder for his service to our 
community. 
Chief Browder began his career in law en-
forcement in 1986 as a Police Dispatcher, be-
fore being sworn in as a Police Officer with 
the Golf Manor Police Department in 1988. 
After spending over two decades in law en-
forcement, he was promoted to Assistant Po-
lice Chief of Springfield Township. He served 
as Assistant Police Chief for 10 years, over-
seeing all department operations, before being 
promoted to Chief of Police in 2015. 
Throughout his distinguished career, Chief 
Browder has served the Hamilton County As-
sociation of Chiefs of Police as Treasurer in 
2016, Vice President in 2017, and President in 
2018. 
In addition to his service in law enforce-
ment, Rob is a dedicated husband and father. 
His accomplishments throughout his career at-
test to his integrity, perseverance, and moral 
strength. 
Chief Browder served with diligence and 
honor throughout his career. I thank Rob for 
his service to our community. I wish him the 
best in his retirement.

CONGRATULATING 
GARRETT 
L. 
RESSING ON HIS RETIREMENT 
FROM FEDERAL SERVICE 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 20, 2021 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to ask the House to join me in recognizing 
Garrett L. Ressing for his thirty years of out-
standing federal service as a civilian attorney 
for the Department of the Navy’s Office of the 
General Counsel (OGC). He lives in Southern 
Maryland, in the Fifth District, and I am hon-
ored to represent him and so many other tal-
ented and hardworking federal civilian employ-
ees in Congress. 
Since he began his distinguished career 
with OGC in l990, Garrett has held several at-
torney positions. Notably, he became a mem-
ber of the Senior Executive Service in Novem-
ber 2008. In April 2015, he was selected to 
serve as the Deputy General Counsel, and in 
March 2019 he was designated Principal Dep-
uty General Counsel. During his tenure in this 
last position as the Navy Department’s most 
senior career attorney, Garrett twice served as 
the Acting General Counsel of the Navy—a 
presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed po-
sition—from March 2019 to January 2020 and 
again from January 2021 to August 2021. 
Garrett excelled at advising the Secretary of 
the Navy during an unprecedented global pan-
demic. He provided steady leadership during a 
time of major change within the Department of 
the Navy and furnished crucial legal and oper-
ational advice necessary to move the Navy

forward in light of an increasingly complex 
global security environment. Garrett has distin-
guished himself as an attorney who worked 
tirelessly to provide proactive, accurate, and 
innovative legal advice on legally complex, 
sensitive issues impacting operations, procure-
ment, fiscal matters, labor, ethics issues, envi-
ronmental concerns, and intelligence law. Fur-
thermore, he has demonstrated an unmatched 
record of leadership while overseeing the pro-
vision of legal advice by more than 800 civilian 
and military attorneys within OGC, ensuring 
the successful execution of Navy and Marine 
Corps missions worldwide. 
Throughout his career, Garrett has received 
various awards for his outstanding contribu-
tions to the Navy, the Department of Defense 
(DoD), and our nation. These include the De-
partment of the Navy Meritorious and Superior 
Civilian Service Awards, the Presidential Rank 
Award of Meritorious Executive, and other per-
formance-related accolades. 
Madam Speaker, I offer Garrett my con-
gratulations on retiring from federal service 
after a career of great contribution to our Na-
tion’s defense and to the well-being of all 
those who have served in the Navy. I hope all 
of my colleagues will join me in recognizing 
Garrett L. Ressing as he reaches this mile-
stone and in wishing him all the best in the fu-

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
COMMANDER MERLE SMITH 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 20, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great sadness that I rise today in honor of the 
life of the late Commander Merle James Smith 
Jr., the first Black graduate of the United 
States Coast Guard (USCG) Academy in New 
London, CT, and the first Black officer to com-
mand a warship in close quarters combat. 
Commander Smith passed away June 16, 
2021, at the age of 76. It was an honor to 
know Commander Merle Smith and bare wit-
ness to all the incredible milestones he 
achieved in his life. He was a true patriot who 
always placed others before himself. 
Born in Greenville, South Carolina to retired 
Army Colonel Merle James Smith Sr. and Jac-
queline T. Smith, Merle grew up in many cities 
across the United States as well as Germany 
and Japan. He graduated from Aberdeen High 
School in Maryland before choosing to attend 
the Coast Guard Academy in 1962 to play 
football under the coaching of Otto Graham, 
the former professional Cleveland Browns 
quarterback player. 
Graduating with a degree in marine engi-
neering in 1966, Officer Smith’s first assign-
ment was to serve aboard the Minnetonka as 
a communication officer. He went on to com-
mand the Coast Guard Cutter, Cape Walsh, 
for two years before joining forces in Vietnam 
where he commanded the USCG Cutters 
Point Mast and Point Ellie, and made history 
serving as the first Black commanding officer 
in close quarters combat. He commanded 
these ships through more than eighty fire sup-
port missions during the successful Operation 
Market Time, which halted the movement of 
supplies into South Vietnam. For his heroic 
service, Commander Smith earned a Bronze 
star, a Navy Meritorious Unit Citation, Presi-
dential Unit Citation, Vietnamese Cross of Gal-
lantry and Vietnam Campaign Medal, among 
several other accolades. 
After returning from the war, Commander 
Smith was stationed at Coast Guard Head-
quarters in Washington, D.C. There, he at-
tended 
George 
Washington 
University’s 
School of Law where he met his wife of 47 
years, Lynda. Upon graduating with a Juris 
Doctor, Commander Smith moved back to 
Connecticut to resume his activities at the 
Academy, this time as a professor in Jaw. As 
expected, Commander Smith excelled in his 
role as a professor and gained notoriety for 
his ability to keep his students engaged. Com-
mander Smith went on to teach for 13 years 
and after enriching the minds of thousands of 
cadets—Commander Smith retired from this 
role and his active duty service in 1979. Com-
mander Smith’s service to our nation however 
continued at the Coast Guard Reserves for 
nine years as Commander of the Coast Guard 
Reserve. Commander Smith simultaneously 
was recruited by our nation’s largest sub-
marine manufacturer, General Dynamic Elec-
tric Boat, to join their legal team. Commander 
Smith worked at Electric Boat for 16 years and 
made his way up to Chief Council before offi-
cially retiring in 1995. From beginning to end, 
awe inspiring is the only way to really describe 
what was Commander Smith’s career and life. 
To memorialize all he did for our nation—the 
Coast Guard Academy announced it will re-
name its Military Officers Club in honor of him 
and here in D.C.—our very own National Mu-
seum of African American History and Culture 
proclaimed that they will set up a special ex-
hibit in honor of Commander Smith and his 
life. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to represent 
constituents who are as humble, dutiful, and 
distinguished as Commander Smith. While we 
mourn his passing, we can take pride in his 
legacy which will continue to echo through the 
United States Coast Guard community as an 
example to our future military leaders. Please 
keep Commander Smith’s family—his loving 
wife Lynda, children Merle J. Smith III, Chel-
sea, and Danielle—in your thoughts as they 
now carry his memory forward. I ask that the 
entire House join me in recognizing his life 
and service to our nation.

MORE FUNDING FOR POLICING 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 20, 2021 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce legislation that gives this House an 
opportunity to provide more funding for polic-
ing. 
My bill does this by allowing the Northern 
Mariana Islands and American Samoa to be 
treated as two separate entities for the pur-
poses of the Byrne Memorial Justice Assist-
ance Grant program. Currently, the Marianas 
and American Samoa are lumped together for 
funding, unlike the other U.S. insular areas— 
Puerto Rico, Guam, and the United States Vir-
gin Islands—which are treated as individual ju-
risdictions, as are all fifty States. 
By fixing this inequity in funding for police in 
the Northern Marianas and American Samoa, 
we can help our men and women in blue re-
ceive the necessary training and equipment 
they need to keep our communities safe. Mak-
ing this change will also provide more funding 
to support prosecutors and the courts, as well 
as justice-related initiatives aimed at crime 
prevention. 
Local law enforcement is increasingly the 
first line of defense against the evolving secu-
rity threats our country faces. We must do all 
we can to recognize the vital role of our police 
in maintaining public safety. 
The gentlelady from American Samoa, Mrs. 
RADEWAGEN, and the gentleman from Hawaii, 
Mr. KAHELE, are original cosponsors of the bill. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bipar-
tisan legislation.

THE AMERICAN IDEAL 
HON. VIRGINIA FOXX 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 20, 2021 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, recently, I re-
ceived an impassioned letter from Elizabeth 
Bradley of Bessemer City, North Carolina, 
about the American ideal. 
In her letter she writes, ‘‘The American ideal 
is the revolutionary thought that it is not by 
government, nor wealth, nor any human inter-
vention that people have rights, but by the di-
vine power of God.’’ 
Ms. Bradley is exactly right, Madam Speak-
er. 
The American ideal has withstood the test 
of time because of those who put their faith in 
God’s plan rather than their own. 
Madam Speaker, let us never forget that we 
are one nation under God, and the freedoms 
we proudly espouse are a gift that He has be-
stowed upon us. 
THE AMERICAN IDEAL 
My name is Elizabeth Bradley, and I am 18 
years old. Recently the President challenged 
anyone to define America, claiming that it 
could not be done. I felt lead to write this 
short essay, not only defining what is truly 
American and outlining the most basic steps 
towards restoring us to our former glory. I 
encourage the reader to share the ideas pre-
sented in this essay at any and every oppor-
tunity, and I thank the reader in advance for 
taking the time to read them. 
It comes upon my conscience this day, 
July 2, 2021, to make note of the American 
Ideal, which is the very thing that has been 
the cornerstone of my upbringing and second 
only in my very identity to my Lord and 
Savior Jesus Christ. I am inclined to write 
this not only for myself but for the mul-
titude like me who are filled with anguish at 
the state of the nation in which we live. I 
struggled in my younger years with the idea 
that my country is so divided against itself. 
I have many times over feared the self-divi-
sion or conquering of the U.S. by a foreign 
power. But it occurs to me now that America 
is not and never, in concept or reality, has 
been a particular plot of land. The United 
States as we call it is only the land in which 
the American Ideal has been allowed to 
flourish. And while it will be a dismal day 
when the current government and land are 
inevitably overrun, America is not a thing 
that can truly be destroyed. America is an 
idea, a rather great one, in which people are

by Providence allowed to protect and fight 
for their God given rights. 
The American ideal is the revolutionary 
thought that it is not by government, nor 
wealth, nor any human intervention that 
people have rights, but by the divine power 
of God. And it is for this very reason that we 
have been uniquely and divinely blessed thus 
far in our pursuits as a nation. It is my firm 
belief that it was no man, but God Himself 
who turned the tide of the American revolu-
tion. Through a myriad of miracles, lives im-
probably saved, and weather, God lead an 
army of untrained and largely uneducated 
patriots to the most unlikely victory in all 
of human history. God’s plan for America 
was vested in the very foundation of its 
ideals and laws. The American ideal ac-
knowledges the fact that ‘‘All men are cre-
ated equal’’ and that ‘‘They are endowed by 
their 
Creator 
with 
certain 
unalienable 
rights’’. The American ideal puts the liberty 
and responsibility of preserving life, enjoy-
ing liberty, and the pursuit of happiness on 
the people of a nation. In turn the govern-
ment respects those rights and protects 
them. It is made clear in the American Ideal 
that these certain rights; among them being 
free speech, freedom of religion, freedom to 
keep and bear arms, privacy from govern-
ment intervention and the right to a fair 
trial and fair treatment throughout any ju-
dicial proceedings, among others; are not ca-
pable of being given or taken away at the 
hands of any man but given by God alone in 
His mercies and through the provision of 
death of Jesus Christ. 
The American Ideal is one, and govern-
mentally the only one, that is constructed in 
a way that can glorify God. It is for this rea-
son that God has supported this great Amer-
ican experiment. It is my unfavorable duty 
at this point to note that the governmental 
body of these United States has long strayed 
from this ideal and its purpose. Through cen-
turies of corruption and societal changes, 
some of which were necessary and some of 
which were orchestrated by the enemy to di-
vide our people, American society has for-
gotten its foundation in Providence. The 
government, which is now lead by a people 
who are led by partisan politics, is a shell of 
what it used to and rightly should be. The 
leaders of this nation have taken to voting 
only for what they believe will get them re- 
elected. Worse than that, some leaders in 
this nation have decided to vote in accord-
ance with whatever will oppose God’s Truth 
and the Providential American Ideal. The 
enemy has not only taken hold in the gov-
ernment but in all aspects of the American 
life. Business, entertainment, and even many 
churches have fallen short of God’s plan for 
this nation. Wealthy and vicious people now 
monopolize almost all forms of communica-
tion and consumers allow themselves to be 
silenced. Churches no longer speak Gods 
Truth, but pander to a modern audience that 
insists upon the acceptance and glorification 
of sin. The doctrines of free speech and reli-
gion have been distorted and abused in a way 
that benefits those who are against the com-
mon people. The poor are intentionally kept 
down for the political gain of those who op-
press them most. And the enemy, with his 
many minions in this world are attempting 
to erase God’s name from the societal con-
science of Americans. 
The hope that we may all hold to is in this 
verse ‘‘If my people who are called by my 
name will humble themselves and pray and 
seek my face and turn from their wicked 
ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I 
will forgive their sin and I will heal their 
land.’’ 2 Chronicles 7:14. We the people, who 
believe in the American Ideal by nature are 
God’s people. We must take heed, not only of 
the hope held in this verse but also of the ef-
fort that we must put in to achieve this goal. 
We must humble ourselves. We must not be 
blinded by our pride, in ourselves, our party 
affiliation, or in our own ideas. Conversely, 
we must humble ourselves and ask only what 
God would have us do, think, say, or vote. 
We must seek God’s plan for us and our na-
tion through prayer, and we must be vigilant 
in this effort. We must pray for forgiveness 
for our collective sins, and we must turn 
from those things which we hold dear that 
we know are not morally right. We must 
turn both from personal sin and do all we can 
to hinder our national sins. If we are to hold 
onto the nation that we love, and properly 
protect the American Ideal we must, as a 
people, place our faith in the sole Almighty 
God of Israel and America. 
While it appalls and amazes me that there 
are those that do not hold this nation and 
this Ideal the way I do, I often feel that 
there are a precious few that see the Amer-
ican Ideal the way I do. In recent times 
many of those who claim the title of patriot 
are unwilling to give up even the smallest 
convenience to divest power from those who 
seek to oppress us. Our forefathers, and in 
fact many influential women of the Amer-
ican Revolution began their revolution by 
giving up their dearest luxuries. It may not 
seem so dear a cost to us now to give up the 
drinking of tea, but what if Amazon Prime 
was put in that place? How many are truly 
willing to give up something, never mind ev-
erything to make the American Ideal once 
again thrive? And, while there is much ex-
plosive drivel strewn across the internet 
about patriotism, I challenge the reader to 
find a single person who is both unwilling to 
stop buying from Google and willing to give 
their very life for the cause. 
Nevertheless, this is written not to dis-
courage the truly American people but to 
bring them hope. The essence of America is 
within the hearts and minds of those who 
know and believe the American Ideal. The 
belief in God given freedoms, personal lib-
erty and the responsibilities therein, and the 
truth that any man can become successful 
when the proper work is put in; that is the 
American Ideal. And this Ideal can not be 
lost, it can not be altered, and it can not be 
destroyed. No matter how hard the enemy 
tries, he can not destroy what God has cre-
ated and blessed. The battle is won against 
the Washington oligarchy, against the im-
moral CEOs, against those who seek to si-
lence us, against the bitter hatred among 
brothers, against the sex culture, against 
drug culture, against Satan himself. It is 
done. Therefore, I urge the reader to get on 
your knees tonight and pray over this na-
tion. Pray with confidence in the One you 
are speaking to. Pray for the leaders of our 
churches, schools, and government. Pray 
over what roll God has for you in the next 
chapter of this American experiment, put on 
the armor of Christ and stand prepared for 
the coming battle.—Elizabeth S. Bradley

PRESERVING HOME AND OFFICE 
NUMBERS IN EMERGENCIES ACT 
OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 19, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 678, the PHONE Act, a simple 
but powerful bill to ensure that Americans who 
lose their homes in natural disasters do not 
also lose their home phone numbers. 
Last year, the CZU Lightning Complex Fire 
burned 86,509 acres in my Congressional Dis-
trict, making it the 12th most destructive fire in 
California history. Seventy-seven thousand of 
my constituents were evacuated, and the fire 
destroyed nearly 1,500 homes, businesses, 
and other buildings. 
This figure includes nearly 1,000 families in 
my district who couldn’t return home because 
their home was destroyed. The PHONE Act 
helps these families and thousands of other 
American families who lose their homes in 
wildfires and other disasters. 
The PHONE Act has three parts. First, if the 
President issues a major disaster declaration 
and a governor designates a disaster area, 
phone numbers in that designated area cannot 
be reassigned for one year. Second, if some-
one in the disaster area needs more than a 
year, they can get a one-year extension be-
cause rebuilding can take years. Third, the bill 
allows consumers to cancel phone service 
without a cancellation fee if their home is inac-
cessible or uninhabitable. The bill also pro-
hibits resubscription fees if consumers get 
phone service somewhere else in the area. 
Some may ask why we need all of this for 
a simple phone number. One of the first things 
parents teach their children is their phone 
number. Many of us still remember our par-
ents’ home phone numbers. While many are 
opting to live with just cellphones, it’s impor-
tant to consider who depends on landlines: 
older Americans and retirees who often have 
multiple doctors, caregivers, and loved ones 
using long-held phone numbers. 
Congressman MIKE THOMPSON authored the 
bill to help the survivors of the Atlas and 
Tubbs fires that ravished his Congressional 
District in 2017. Thousands lost their homes 
and were further frustrated to learn they also 
lost their phone number, because phone com-
panies had given the numbers away. 
The bill is carefully drafted to plug a small 
gap in the law, but this gap means the world 
to our constituents for whom this bill is written 
to protect. 
Last Congress, the bill was marked up on 
March 10, 2020, by the Subcommittee on 
Communications and Technology and on Sep-
tember 9, 2020, by the full Energy & Com-
merce Committee. At both markups, I offered 
amendments to ensure the bill would have 
broad, bipartisan support and would be as ef-
fective as possible. On September 29, 2020, 
the House passed the bill by voice vote. 
Sadly, the Senate did not consider the meas-
ure. 
I urge my House colleagues to pass this bill 
once again and urge the Senate to take it up 
and pass the bill as well.

1993, was appointed Chief Fiscal Officer. The 
nonpartisan Joint Fiscal Office provides fiscal 
analysis, budget evaluation, performance over-
sight and fiscal policy support for the Appro-
priations, Finance, Ways & Means and Tax 
Committees and for the Vermont Legislature 
as a whole. In his capacity as Chief Fiscal Of-
ficer, Stephen has directed the budget and tax 
staff for the Vermont House and Senate for 
the past 28 years. 
With rapid fire speech, Stephen has edu-
cated generations of Vermont legislators on 
the complexities of the Vermont budget proc-
ess. As President Pro Tempore of the 
Vermont Senate, I had the pleasure of working 
with Stephen to craft budgets for the State of 
Vermont and, like many before and after me, 
marveled 
at 
his 
intricate 
knowledge 
of 
Vermont state government, tax policy, the 
budget, and the economy. Stephen has 
gained the trust of legislators through his facil-
ity with his subject matter and his generous 
willingness to explain it. 
Stephen’s contributions have extended be-
yond Vermont. He served as president of the 
National Association of Legislative Fiscal Of-
fices in 1998 to 1999 and was a member of 
National Conference of State Legislatures’ Ex-
ecutive Committee from 2002 to 2005. From 
2009 to 2017, Stephen served on the Advisory 
Board of the New England Public Policy Cen-
ter at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, 
providing advice on research content and di-
rection to policy makers in the New England 
region. From 2014 to 2017 Stephen served on 
the Government Accounting Standards Advi-
sory Committee. 
In 2013, Stephen was the recipient of the 
Steven D. Gold Award, given annually by the 
National Tax Association, the Association for 
Public 
Policy 
Analysis 
and 
Management 
(APPAM), and the National Conference of 
State Legislatures (NCSL). The 2013 award 
was presented by the NCSL. The award hon-
ors professionals who have made significant 
contributions to state and local fiscal policy. 
In addition to his professional commitments, 
Stephen has volunteered tirelessly in his com-
munity, serving on the board of the local food 
cooperative in Montpelier, as Treasurer of the 
Green Mountain Club, and as Treasurer for 
the local synagogue. Stephen also serves as 
a guest lecturer at the Vermont Law School. 
Mr. Klein attended the University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley; Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology; 
and 
Northeastern 
University 
School of Law. He served in the Peace Corps 
in the Dominican Republic and Honduras in 
the early 1970s. 
Stephen’s friendly demeanor, sage observa-
tions and ubiquitous presence have made him 
a well-known and welcome fixture under the 
Golden Dome. He will be greatly missed. I 
wish him all the best in his retirement and look 
forward to seeing him out on Vermont’s hiking 
trails.

HONORING DWANA BRADLEY 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 20, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Dwana Bradley as Iowan of the Week. 
Dwana is a mother, a business owner, an ed-
ucator, and a long-time community advocate. 
She believes education is the key to life, 
which speaks to her passion and career as a 
teacher. 
Dwana received a bachelor’s degree in child 
and family services from Iowa State Univer-
sity, a master’s degree in elementary edu-
cation and literacy from Drake University, and 
a specialist’s degree in administration. She 
went on to graduate from the Greater Des 
Moines Leadership Institute, and for almost 
seven years she worked as a reading inter-
ventionist with Des Moines Public Schools 
(DMPS) to help students reach their potential. 
In 2019, she was elected to the Des Moines 
School Board and currently serves as the 
chair of the board. 
Dwana did not let the COVID–19 pandemic 
slow her drive to educate young Iowans. As 
chairwoman, she serves in an outreach role to 
help underserved communities attain higher 
education and is working to stem the negative 
impact of COVID–19 on students, especially 
those who were already struggling in school or 
falling behind. 
Dwana also owns Iowa Urban Media, a 
community-focused publishing company, and 
is the editor-in-chief for the Urban Experience 
Magazine, a monthly publication that shares 
news in the African American community and 
seeks to empower voices through positivity. 
Her journalism promotes education, an open 
dialogue, and a space to have important con-
versations about issues affecting Iowans. She 
passionately believes that these conversations 
are a crucial step towards achieving justice. 
In addition to her commendable career in 
education, Dwana is an active advocate. She 
is the executive director of Iowa Juneteenth 
and chairs a committee for Iowa Juneteenth 
Observance, volunteers on the DMPS attend-
ance committee, and still makes time to direct 
the choir at True Bible Baptist Church. 
As executive director of Iowa Juneteenth 
and chair on a committee for Iowa Juneteenth 
Observance, she helps put on events, educate 
the public, and celebrate with Iowans across 
the state for the annual commemoration of 
Juneteenth: the date the last enslaved African 
Americans were granted freedom in 1865, 
ending slavery in the United States. Just this 
week, Congress finally passed a bill to for-
mally recognize Juneteenth National Inde-
pendence Day as a federal holiday after dec-
ades of activism from Americans. 
As 
we 
recently 
gathered 
to 
observe 
Juneteenth and join in community celebrations 
and educational events, let us thank Dwana 
and her team for their efforts to bring Iowans 
together to share stories, experiences, and 
history with one another. She is a fantastic ed-
ucator, a proud voice in the community, and a 
fervent advocate for uplifting Iowans. Please 
join me in honoring Dwana Bradley as our 
Iowan of the Week.

REMEMBERING JASON G. THOMAS 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 20, 2021 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing Jason G. 
Thomas for his ten years of service with the 
House’s Office of the Chief Administrative Offi-
cer (CAO), Logistics & Support. It is with a 
heavy heart that I share the news that he 
passed away in September 2020 at the young 
age of forty. Jason was a constituent of mine 
from Maryland’s Fifth District. 
Jason began his career with the CAO in 
January 2015, joining the Logistics & Support 
group responsible for moving furniture and 
carrying out the massive effort every two 
years of moving offices during the Congres-
sional transition. Prior to his time with the 
CAO, Jason worked with District Movers, 
where he gained a strong understanding of lo-
gistics and organization, which served him 
well in his House employment. 
Among his many hobbies, Jason had a love 
of acting, he enjoyed mechanics, he was an 
avid football fan, and he proved a very tal-
ented drummer. He was a graduate of the 
Massanutten Military Academy. Jason’s co-
workers and friends remember him for his in-
fectious smile and incessant positive attitude. 
Some of the sentiments they shared after he 
passed away included that: ‘He was always 
smiling,’ and ‘What a great guy.’ Also: ‘He 
would always greet you with a smile and a 
hello and was such a light to be around.’ 
Prior to his death, Jason was being recog-
nized for his exceptional service while con-
fronting the challenges of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. He was tasked with helping to assist 
with the enormous job of processing the dis-
tribution of thousands of laptops and elec-
tronics to House Members and staff who were 
suddenly required to work remotely. The Asset 
Management 
Department 
specifically 
re-
quested Jason by name, not only because of 
his talent but also because of his sunny dis-
position and positive attitude while performing 
his duties. He was soon to be recognized for 
his contribution to this effort by former Chief 
Administrative Officer Phil Kiko. 
Jason lived in Clinton, Maryland, and is sur-
vived by his parents, Henry and Idena Thom-
as, his three sisters—Sonya, Tanya, and Yo-
landa—and his three young children, fourteen- 
year-old Kason, thirteen-year-old Juatez, and 
ten-year-old Karen. 
Madam, Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in thanking Jason G. Thomas for his 
service and contributions to this House. I want 
to extend my heartfelt condolences to, the 
Thomas family for their tremendous loss. The 
gifts of Jason’s life and his tremendous dedi-
cation to service, family, and community will 
always be remembered.

great pillar of southern Utah, Commissioner 
Dean Cox. His years of diligent public service 
to his community and family will be felt for 
decades to come. He will be dearly missed. 
Commissioner Dean Cox devoted his life to 
serving others and set an example of meas-
ured and thoughtful leadership throughout 
his life. He gave of his time and talents gen-
erously and had a way of bringing people to-
gether to complete essential projects for the 
benefit of all in Washington County. 
Dean’s local knowledge and diverse experi-
ences secured him as a vital and trusted 
voice for the community. We revere Dean’s 
willingness to share his love of flight and 
knowledge of radio operation to protect his 
community through service as volunteer 
emergency responder. As a small business 
owner, he showed the way to invest in the fu-
ture of his community. His ever willingness 
to serve taught us compassion for, and devo-
tion to beloved neighbors, which is a legacy 
that will live on in Washington County, the 
State of Utah, and beyond. 
We are grateful to you for your sustaining 
love and support to Commissioner Dean Cox

HONORING CAPTAIN TIMOTHY 
CRONIN 
HON. JOHN H. RUTHERFORD 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 20, 2021 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
have the honor of serving Florida’s First 
Coast, with a constituency filled with our na-
tion’s heroes. It is my distinct privilege to rise 
today and speak about one of my own Coast 
Guard constituents, Captain Timothy Cronin. 
Captain Cronin currently serves as the 
Commanding Officer of the National Security 
Cutter Hamilton in North Charleston, South 
Carolina, and has served his country with dis-
tinction for 25 years. On July 23rd of this year, 
he retires and returns home to his wife Kristan 
and children Kaleigh, Connor, Cooper, Parker 
and Davis. 
Since the Coast Guard’s founding in 1790 
by Alexander Hamilton, Americans have relied 
on our guardsmen to protect our nation’s mari-
time interests. The Coast Guard has secured 
our sovereignty in times of war and peace, 
and safeguarded the American public during 
times of national catastrophe. 
Captain Tim Cronin has served on six cut-
ters, commanding three of them. He departs 
the service after leading the great crew of the 
Coast Guard Cutter Hamilton—a state of the 
art National Security Cutter bearing the name 
of the Service’s founder. In his two years com-
manding the Hamilton, Captain Cronin seized 
over 13 tons of illegal drugs worth $316 mil-
lion, removed 41 drug traffickers from the 
water, and led his crew through the Covid–19 
pandemic. 
Most recently, he took his crew over 5,000 
nautical miles from home to the Mediterranean 
Sea and Black Sea. There, he conducted 
training with NATO and Black Sea allies in the 
face of Russian aggression, enforcing the rule 
of law and the steadfast commitment of the 
United States to our friends in the region. He 
operated in a global environment and proved 
once again how powerful and important our 
Coast Guard is to the world. 
While his retirement is a loss to the Service, 
his legacy will continue to live on in the Coast 
Guard men and women he served with over 
the last 25 years. They have undoubtedly ben-
efitted from his leadership, genuine compas-
sion for others, and commitment to the Coast 
Guard’s core values of honor, respect, and de-
votion lo duty. 
Captain Cronin, those whom you’ve led now 
have the watch. I wish Captain Cronin fair 
winds and following seas as he starts a new 
chapter in his life. Bravo Zulu on a job very 
well-done. 
I ask my colleagues to please join me in 
recognizing this great American and Coast 
Guardsman for his selfless service to our Na-
tion.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RICHARD 
RAINEY 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 20, 2021 
MR. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of Richard ‘‘Dick’’ 
Rainey. 
Dick was born in Oregon in 1938. His par-
ents were loggers, so Dick grew up spending 
a lot of time outdoors. Following high school, 
Dick joined the United States Navy and served 
for four years. He then pursued a career in 
law enforcement and joined the Compton Po-
lice Department. In 1964, Dick moved to 
Contra Costa County where he joined the 
Sheriff’s Office. He spent 28 years there and 
was promoted through the ranks, but also con-
tinued his education and earned an associ-
ate’s and bachelor’s degree while working. In 
1978, Dick was elected as the Contra Costa 
County Sheriff. During his tenure as Sheriff, 
he oversaw the construction of new jails in 
Martinez and Richmond. 
When he retired as Sheriff, Dick turned to 
politics. He represented parts of Contra Costa 
and Alameda counties in both the California 
State and the California State Senate. He then 
went on to serve as a Regional Director of the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment under the George W. Bush Adminis-
tration. 
Dick is remembered as a compassionate, 
genuine man who dedicated his life to helping 
others. In his personal life, he enjoyed trav-
eling and spending quality time with his chil-
dren and grandchildren. 
Sadly, Dick passed away this month. He 
was a mentor to me, and he will be dearly 
missed. Please join me in honoring Dick 
Rainey for his leadership and many contribu-
tions to our community.
