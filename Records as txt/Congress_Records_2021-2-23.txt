Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 2021 
No. 34 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 2 p.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Eternal God, the recent numbers are 
staggering: 500,000 deaths from COVID, 
58 people who have died in the winter 
storms of the last 10 days, and at one 
point 4 million households were with-
out power in Texas. 
In the face of the enormity of these 
figures, we come to You this day at a 
loss for words, few answers, and in 
some cases no hope. 
Speak to us, O infinite Lord. How 
precious are Your thoughts, how vast is 
their sum. If we could count them, 
they would outnumber the grains of 
sand. You who have determined the 
number of the stars and call them each 
by name, great are You our Lord and 
mighty in power. Your understanding 
has no limit. 
In Your attention to us, You have 
numbered the hairs on our heads. We 
ask then that You would heal the bro-
kenhearted and bind up their wounds. 
Cover us with Your eternity. May we 
rest secure in knowing that You will 
never leave nor forsake us. 
It is in the strength of Your ever-
lasting name we pray. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
5(a)(1)(A) of House Resolution 8, the 
Journal of the last day’s proceedings is 
approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. WILSON) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina led 
the Pledge of Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ELECTING A MEMBER TO CERTAIN 
STANDING COMMITTEES OF THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, by direc-
tion of the Republican Conference, I 
offer a privileged resolution and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 146 
Resolved, That following named Member 
be, and is hereby, elected to the following 
standing committees of the House of Rep-
resentatives: 
COMMITTEE
ON
FOREIGN
AFFAIRS: 
Ms. 
Tenney (to rank immediately after Mr. 
Meuser). 
COMMITTEE
ON
SMALL
BUSINESS: 
Ms. 
Tenney (to rank immediately after Mr. 
Meuser). 
The resolution was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
GOMEZ). The Chair will entertain up to 
15 requests for 1-minute speeches on 
each side of the aisle. 
f 
EDUCATORS OWED BASIC PUBLIC 
HEALTH PROTECTION 
(Ms. BOURDEAUX asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today, as we celebrate Public 
Schools Week, to talk about the urgent 
need to protect our teachers, edu-
cational support staff, all of their fami-
lies, and the community at large in our 
schools. 
While the national debate has cen-
tered around schools that are closed, in 
many States, such as Georgia, school 
districts 
with 
high 
COVID 
trans-
mission rates are back to in-person 
teaching, but often without basic safe-
ty standards in place, such as requiring 
students to wear masks on school prop-
erty. 
Teachers and staff in Georgia do not 
enjoy the protection of strong teacher 
unions, and the State has exempted 
schools from liability around COVID. A 
teacher recognized for excellence in 
Forsyth County, in my district, chose 
to quit her job. 
She wrote me, saying: Fortunately, 
my family earns enough money for me 
not to return to teach, but there are 
some others who don’t have this bless-
ing and are forced into dangerous cir-
cumstances. They can’t speak up. They 
know their employment would be on 
the line if they did. So unless others 
like me speak up and out, this mess 
will continue. 
Mr. Speaker, I join this teacher in 
speaking out. We owe our educators 
the courtesy of basic public health pro-
tection. We owe them prioritization in 
receiving the vaccine. 
f 
PARIS ACCORD DESTROYS JOBS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, it has been estimated the 
Paris Accord adopted by President Joe 
Biden will destroy 2.7 million Amer-
ican jobs. 
The Washington Examiner, on Janu-
ary 26, exposes more dangers to Amer-
ican families: 
‘‘President Biden’s decision to rejoin 
the Paris climate accord immediately 
delivered . . . a gift to China.

‘‘It commits the United States . . . 
that will entangle American businesses 
and jobs in new lengths of red tape, and 
will also probably increase electricity 
prices. 
‘‘China, which emits twice as much 
carbon each year as we do, has given 
the rest of the world nothing but 
empty promises. 
‘‘Biden is giving away the store for 
nothing . . . he should demand external 
verification of emissions data. . . .’’ 
Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, God bless 
our troops, and we will never forget 
September the 11th in the global war 
on terrorism. 
I appreciate President Biden last 
night recognizing the lives lost by the 
Wuhan virus, joining President Trump 
last year, who took the first action to 
ban travel from China. 
f 
UNRELATED COVID RELIEF BILL 
(Mr. POSEY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I have been 
reading the COVID ‘‘unrelated’’ relief 
bill. At least when President Trump 
was borrowing money to keep the econ-
omy from crashing, he was creating 
jobs, making America energy inde-
pendent—lowering gasoline and fuel 
prices for every American family—low-
ering unemployment, protecting our 
borders, rebuilding our military, and so 
on. 
Now, however, with the assistance of 
this Chamber, this administration is 
doing just the opposite. 
It sounds like something right from 
the pages of Saul Alinsky’s book, 
‘‘Rules for Radicals,’’ how malcontents 
propose to destroy America. 
This COVID ‘‘unrelated’’ relief bill is 
more about keeping America closed 
and funding liberal policies than get-
ting past this virus, and it is out-
rageous. 
f 
RECOGNIZING LUKA GARZA 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the accom-
plishments of someone in my district 
who is not as vertically challenged as I 
am. 
This past weekend, University of 
Iowa men’s basketball player Luka 
Garza broke the University of Iowa’s 
all-time scoring record in basketball. 
The new record of 2,126 points put Luka 
ahead of the late Roy Marble, who held 
the previous record of 2,116 points for 
over 30 years. 
A native of the D.C. area, Luka was a 
star player for the Maret School, lead-
ing the Frogs to a city championship 
while being named Gatorade D.C. Play-
er of the Year and setting the school 
points record. 
Luka has been a dominant player in 
college basketball since his first game 
as a University of Iowa Hawkeye 
against Chicago State. Since then, he 
has gone on to win numerous con-
ference and national awards, including 
Big Ten Player of Year and the Sport-
ing News Player of the Year last sea-
son. 
As a former faculty member at the 
university, I was thrilled when Luka 
decided to return to Iowa City for his 
senior season instead of heading to the 
NBA draft. With four regular season 
games, the Big Ten Tournament, and 
March Madness left, I have no doubt 
that Luka will continue to break his 
own record and make Iowa proud and 
the best place to live, work, play, and 
raise a family. 
f 
PRESERVING OUR CIVIL RIGHTS 
(Mrs. GREENE of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, as we convene this week, I would 
like to ask all of my fellow colleagues 
and Members of the 117th Congress to 
reflect on the words right there on the 
wall: In God We Trust. 
God created us male and female. In 
His image, He created us. The Equality 
Act that we are to vote on this week 
destroys God’s creation. It also com-
pletely annihilates women’s rights and 
religious freedoms. 
It can be handled completely dif-
ferently to stop discrimination without 
destroying women’s rights, little girls’ 
rights in sports, and religious freedoms 
violating everything that we hold dear 
in God’s creation. 
As we are reflecting on the 500,000 
people who have died from COVID–19, I 
would like to remind everyone that 
over 62 million people have been mur-
dered in the womb in our country and 
that our tax dollars many times have 
funded it. This is an evil that should 
not exist in our land, and I ask all 
Members of Congress to stop this evil 
now. 
f 
HONORING SHARON SANDERS 
(Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, today I rise to honor the life 
of Sharon Sanders, one of Charlotte’s 
great philanthropists and the founder 
of Kids First of the Carolinas, which 
through the decades has provided es-
sentials and Christmas gifts to over 
35,000 children and families in the 
Charlotte area. Ms. Sanders died Janu-
ary 14 after a battle with cancer. 
Sharon was a wife, mother, and 
friend to all, with an extraordinary 
passion for helping others. Her love for 
children led to her founding Kids First; 
and with the assistance of legendary 
Charlotte broadcaster John Hancock, 
the organization was able to expand 
outreach, providing for more than 2,000 
children every Christmas and raising 
about $80,000 a year. 
Even as she endured treatment for 
cancer, Sharon remained devoted to 
Kids First. Despite her hospitalization, 
she was overjoyed that they were, once 
again, able to help over 1,000 families 
during the holidays past. 
Mr. Speaker, the Charlotte commu-
nity will miss Sharon greatly. It is a 
privilege to honor her memory today.

RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

proximately 4 p.m. today.

the United States Postal Service lo-
cated at 1101 Charlotte Street in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H553 
February 23, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join 
my colleagues here in the House in 
consideration of H.R. 264 to designate 
the facility of the United States Postal 
Service located at 1101 Charlotte Street 
in Georgetown, South Carolina, as the 
Joseph Hayne Rainey Memorial Post 
Office Building. 
Joseph Rainey was the first African- 
American Member of the United States 
House of Representatives and one of 14 
Black Representatives elected before 
the end of Reconstruction in 1877. 
Joseph Rainey was born into slavery 
in Georgetown, South Carolina, in 1832. 
His father was a barber and used his 
earnings to buy freedom for himself 
and his family and, yes, including Jo-
seph. Later, during the Civil War, Jo-
seph was drafted by the Confederacy, 
but he escaped to Bermuda and his wife 
and he there started a business. 
In 1866, he returned to Georgetown 
where he became the county’s Repub-
lican Party chairman. Just a few years 
later, in 1870, he was elected to the 
United 
States 
Congress 
where 
he 
served until 1879, making him the long-
est serving African-American Member 
of Congress in the 19th century. 
Following 
his 
time 
in 
Congress, 
Rainey was appointed as a Federal 
agent of the U.S. Treasury Depart-
ment. He returned to South Carolina in 
1886 and, unfortunately, passed away 
the following year in Georgetown. 
Representative Joe Rainey fought 
tirelessly for civil rights, education, 
and economic opportunity for all peo-
ple. He left behind a legacy that will 
never be forgotten. So, at the very 
least, naming a post office in his honor 
will continually help all of us to re-
member the contributions of this re-
markable trailblazer. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. RICE) for his remarks. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from the First District of South Caro-
lina for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of my bill, H.R. 264. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will suspend. Will the gen-
tleman put on his mask, please. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Oh, I 
thought you could take it off when you 
are speaking. I am sorry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman may proceed. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
bill, H.R. 264, to rename the Post Office 
in Georgetown, South Carolina, the Jo-
seph Hayne Rainey Memorial Post Of-
fice. 
A man, a trailblazer of many firsts, a 
civil rights pioneer, an American hero 
that I had never heard of before I got 
to Congress; I first learned of him be-
cause his portrait hangs on the wall in 
the halls of the House of Representa-
tives. 
Joseph Rainey was the first African- 
American Member of the United States 
House of Representatives. Rainey was 
born into slavery in Georgetown in 
1832. His father was a slave, but also a 
barber, and used his earnings to buy 
freedom for himself and his family, in-
cluding Joseph. 
During the Civil War, Joseph Rainey 
was conscripted into the Confederate 
Army, but he escaped to Bermuda with 
his family and built a prosperous busi-
ness as a barber. 
In 1866, he returned to Georgetown, 
where he became the county’s Repub-
lican Party Chairman. In 1870, he was 
elected to the United States Congress, 
where he served until 1879. Think about 
that for a moment. The first African 
American to serve in the United States 
Congress was a former slave and a Re-
publican 
from 
Georgetown, 
South 
Carolina. 
His tenure in Congress was distin-
guished by its advancement of civil 
rights, equality, and opportunity for 
all. He fought against violence and in-
timidation toward African Americans. 
In 1878, as Reconstruction was ending, 
he was defeated in his last race for 
Congress. He was one of 14 Black Rep-
resentatives elected before the end of 
Reconstruction in 1877. He was the 
longest-serving 
African-American 
Member of Congress, a record which 
stood until the 1950s. 
Following 
his 
time 
in 
Congress, 
Rainey was appointed as a Federal 
agent of the United States Treasury 
Department for the Internal Revenue 
Service in South Carolina. 
In 1866, he returned to South Caro-
lina for good and passed away the fol-
lowing year in Georgetown. Rainey 
fought tirelessly for equal rights, edu-
cation, and economic opportunity for 
all. He left behind a legacy that has 
improved the lives of generations, not 
just in South Carolina, but across the 
country. 
Representative Rainey’s house still 
stands in historic Georgetown. It is lo-
cated at 921 Prince Street. It was des-
ignated a national historic landmark 
in 1984, and I had the opportunity to 
visit just last year. The next time you 
are close by, stroll by the modest home 
in downtown Georgetown and pause for 
a moment to marvel at the life of an 
American hero; a man born a slave, a 
successful entrepreneur, escaped con-
scription in the Civil War, and served 
as a Representative in the United 
States Congress. What a remarkable 
life. 
It was a privilege to introduce this 
bill that honors a true American pa-
triot like Mr. Rainey. All South Caro-
linians, all Americans, can look up to 
Joseph Rainey as a trailblazer of civil 
rights. 
I would like to thank Lorna Rainey, 
the 
great-granddaughter 
of 
Joseph 
Rainey, for her support in this effort. 
I also want to thank Representative 
CLYBURN
and Representative MACE, 
who helped move this through com-
mittee and bring it to the floor, along 
with the entire South Carolina House 
delegation for their cosponsorship of 
this bill. 
This is a much-deserved honor for an 
accomplished American patriot from 
South Carolina, Joseph Rainey. I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yea’’. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD). 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Mr. MFUME for yielding 
time, and I thank Mr. RICE for intro-
ducing this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, when I was first 
elected to Congress, I visited Congress-
man CLYBURN’s office seeking his as-
sistance with committee assignments. 
While there, I noticed the pictures of 
eight former South Carolina Congress-
men, all African American, hanging 
prominently in his outer office. 
Among those was Joseph Rainey, the 
first African American elected to the 
U.S. House of Representatives. I was 
unaware of Mr. Rainey, and so I be-
came curious about this man. 
Joseph Rainey was born to enslaved 
parents on June 21, 1832, in George-
town, South Carolina, a community 
heavily dominated with slaves. 
As 
the 
years 
went 
on, 
Joseph 
Rainey’s father was permitted by his 
master to work independently and save 
a little money. Using his accumulated 
funds, Edward Rainey purchased free-
dom for little Joseph and his family. 
When President Lincoln was elected 
in 1860, 11 States seceded from the 
Union; South Carolina was the first. A 
civil war erupts. 
Joseph Rainey, now 28 years of age, 
was conscripted, or drafted, to work on 
fortifications in Charleston. This was 
unacceptable to Joseph, and so, with 
his family, he escaped to St. George, 
Bermuda. 
Madam Speaker, St. George is a 
small parish on the island of Bermuda. 
While there, Rainey undoubtedly be-
came acquainted with my grandfather, 
James Peter Butterfield, born 1853, who 
lived his entire life in St. George. 
On December 6, 1865, the 13th Amend-
ment was added to the Constitution, 
ending slavery in America. 400,000 
slaves in South Carolina are free: 37,000 
in Charleston, 32,000 in Beaufort, 18,000 
in Georgetown. 
The same year, the Civil War ends. 
South 
Carolina 
desires 
to 
be 
re-
admitted to the Union. As a condition, 
South Carolina was required to adopt a 
constitution that repudiated secession, 
acknowledged the end of slavery and 
repudiated debts that the State and its 
White citizens had incurred. 
The South Carolina Constitutional 
Convention convened on January 14, 
1868. A very prominent delegate to the 
convention was Joseph H. Rainey. The 
convention’s minutes, Madam Speaker, 
reflect that Rainey advocated for free 
public education for all South Carolina 
citizens. He advocated for relieving 
White landowners of their insurmount-
able debt that had accumulated during 
the war. 
The convention was successful; a new 
constitution was adopted, and on July

February 23, 2021 
9, 1868, South Carolina was readmitted 
to the Union. Joseph Rainey was recog-
nized for his brilliance during the con-
vention. 
The following year, 1869, Congress 
passed the 15th Amendment granting 
the former slaves the right to vote and 
hold office. On February 3, 1870, the 
15th Amendment was finally ratified by 
the States. 
Joseph Rainey seized the oppor-
tunity; ran for Congress in the First 
District. Elected on December 12, 1870, 
Congressman Rainey remained a Mem-
ber of this body until after President 
Rutherford B. Hayes ended Reconstruc-
tion, which gave rise to violence 
against African Americans. 
Though Rainey was reelected in 1876, 
he did not seek office again, making 
him the longest-serving African-Amer-
ican Congressman during Reconstruc-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, this is a remarkable 
story. I appreciate Mr. RICE, and Mr. 
CLYBURN, and the entire South Caro-
lina delegation for offering this legisla-
tion to name the Post Office located at 
1101 Charlotte Street in Georgetown as 
the Joseph Hayne Rainey Memorial 
Post Office Building. 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers and I am prepared 
to close. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on H.R. 
264. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
CLYBURN), the distinguished whip of 
the House of Representatives. 
b 1615 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 264, which 
will designate the post office located 
on Charlotte Street in Georgetown, 
South Carolina, as the Joseph Hayne 
Rainey Memorial Post Office Building. 
I am proud to join with the bill’s lead 
sponsor, Congressman TOM RICE, and 
the other members of the South Caro-
lina congressional delegation in co-
sponsoring this important legislation. 
This action builds on our efforts in 
the last Congress to honor the life and 
legacy of Joseph Rainey by naming H– 
150, the former House Committee on In-
dian Affairs room in the Capitol, in his 
honor. 
These are just two of the long-over-
due actions needed to amplify the his-
torical significance of the first African 
American to serve in the United States 
House of Representatives. 
Congressman Rainey was a trail-
blazer whose story and place in history 
have been overlooked. As a former his-
tory teacher who believes knowing our 
history is instructive so that we don’t 
repeat the mistakes of our past, I 
would like to share with you my fellow 
South Carolinian’s legacy. 
Joseph Rainey, as you heard, was 
born enslaved in 1832 in Georgetown, 
South Carolina. His father was able to 
buy his family’s freedom with earnings 
he made as a barber. As a freedman liv-
ing in Charleston, Rainey was con-
scripted by the Confederacy in 1862. 
Rather than fighting to preserve slav-
ery, he and his family fled to Bermuda, 
where he worked as a barber until the 
end of the war. 
Rainey returned to South Carolina 
after the Civil War and served, as you 
heard, as a delegate to the 1868 South 
Carolina 
Constitutional 
Convention. 
He was elected to the State senate in 
1870. Later that year, he was elected to 
Congress in a special election and was 
sworn into Congress on December 12, 
150 years ago, becoming the first Black 
to serve in the House of Representa-
tives. 
He was the first of several African- 
American Members of this body during 
Reconstruction, when the 13th, 14th, 
and 15th Amendments were enforced, 
however imperfectly, by the power of 
the Federal Government. 
But Reconstruction was short-lived. 
Jim Crow laws and white supremacists 
dismantled 
multiracial 
democracy 
with voter suppression, nullifications, 
and 
violent 
insurrection. 
Federal 
troops were withdrawn from the South 
following widespread white suprema-
cist violence during the 1876 election 
and the subsequent election of Ruther-
ford B. Hayes as President. 
Joseph Rainey spoke out against the 
removal of Federal protection of voting 
rights, but in 1878, he lost reelection to 
former 
Confederate 
officer 
John 
Smythe Richardson in a district that 
was, like South Carolina, majority 
Black. 
Severe gerrymandering reduced the 
number of Black South Carolinians in 
Congress to one in the 1890s. When 
George Washington Murray lost his bid 
for reelection in 1897, South Carolina’s 
representation in Congress was again 
all White and remained all White for 
the next 95 years. 
Segregation and Black disenfran-
chisement were the law of the land 
until the 1960s. But thanks to the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965 and its 1982 
amendments, I was elected to this au-
gust body in 1992. 
Today, Congress is still grappling 
with racial issues, voter suppression, 
and, as we witnessed last month, do-
mestic terrorism. 
It is fitting and proper that we are 
taking this step as we are celebrating 
Black History Month. I believe we 
would do well to learn some of the les-
sons of American history through Jo-
seph Rainey’s experiences, and I hope 
today’s action will help illuminate his 
story and cause us all to reflect on his 
legacy. We must not allow the progress 
we have made toward racial equity 
since the 1960s to retrogress, as it did 
after the 1860s. 
To truly honor the contributions of 
Joseph Rainey and all African Ameri-
cans, we must build on this progress by 
working together to address our coun-
try’s longstanding racial inequities and 
fulfill the promise of liberty and jus-
tice for all. 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers and am prepared to 
close. 
It is a real honor to be here today, 
and the distinguished whip is correct 
that this is long overdue, to recognize 
Joseph Rainey and his accomplish-
ments. 
He fought tirelessly for civil rights 
and education and opportunity. He 
fought for freedom for every working 
American in this country. To be here 
today in Black History Month to recog-
nize his legacy and his legend, he will 
not be forgotten, and we ensure that 
today. 
I hope that future generations of 
South 
Carolinians 
and 
Americans 
across the country can be inspired by 
his courageous leadership here in this 
House. I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I want 
to make sure that I mention my appre-
ciation to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD) for the way they suc-
cinctly captured a great swath of 
American history over the period of 
time that followed Lincoln’s signing of 
the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 
all the way up to the beginning of the 
Black Codes and the failing of Recon-
struction, an era that held great hope 
for this country but did not come to 
pass and really was not evidenced until 
many, many decades later, as Mr. CLY-
BURN pointed out. 
I am happy and honored to bring this 
measure forward. I want to thank the 
gentlewoman from South Carolina for 
all of her efforts and the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. RICE) for 
their work advancing this. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge the 
passage of H.R. 264. I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
MFUME) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 264. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H555 
February 23, 2021 
in Wayzata, Minnesota, as the ‘‘Jim 
Ramstad Post Office’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 772 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. JIM RAMSTAD POST OFFICE. 
(a) 
DESIGNATION.—The 
facility 
of 
the 
United States Postal Service located at 229 
Minnetonka Avenue South in Wayzata, Min-
nesota, shall be known and designated as the 
‘‘Jim Ramstad Post Office’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. MFUME) and the gentle-
woman 
from 
South 
Carolina 
(Ms. 
MACE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join 
my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 
772 to designate the facility of the 
United States Postal Service located at 
229 
Minnetonka 
Avenue 
South 
in 
Wayzata, Minnesota, and I hope I am 
pronouncing that correctly, as the Jim 
Ramstad Post Office. 
Jim Ramstad was born in James-
town, North Dakota, on May 6, 1946. He 
was a graduate of the University of 
Minnesota and the George Washington 
University Law School, as well as a 
member of the Army Reserve from 1968 
until 1974. 
Jim became a State senator in 1981. 
There, he began shaping his personal 
and political life around the principles 
of recovery, honesty, resilience, trans-
parency, and accountability. 
Jim Ramstad would then go on to 
serve in the Minnesota State Senate 
for 10 years before ultimately becom-
ing a Member of this body, the United 
States House of Representatives, rep-
resenting Minnesota’s Third District. 
In the Congress, he was a consensus 
builder, championing the bipartisan 
policies needed to reduce discrimina-
tion against those suffering from men-
tal health and addiction problems. 
His signature legislation, the Paul 
Wellstone Mental Health Treatment 
Act, was enacted in 2008 just before 
Jim retired from Congress. After retir-
ing, he served as a fellow at Harvard 
University and as an adviser to Min-
nesota’s Hazelden treatment center. 
Representative Ramstad lived the 
final 39 years of his life in absolute and 
complete sobriety. His story is the 
story of recovery, impacted in a way 
that many of us will not understand, 
but impacting the lives of Minnesotans 
and Americans. He died November 5, 
2020, after battling Parkinson’s disease 
for some time. 
Naming 
a 
post 
office 
for 
Jim 
Ramstad is an entirely appropriate 
measure, given his distinguished polit-
ical career and contributions to his 
State and to his country. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. MACE. I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 772, a bill that would name a Min-
nesota post office after Jim Ramstad. 
From 1968 to 1974, Jim Ramstad 
served as a member of the Army Re-
serve. In 1981, he was elected to the 
Minnesota State Senate, where he 
would go on to serve for 10 years. He 
was then elected to the U.S. House of 
Representatives, where he represented 
Minnesota’s Third Congressional Dis-
trict. 
During his time in Congress, he 
strove to reduce discrimination against 
those suffering from mental health and 
addiction problems. He retired from 
Congress in 2009 and went on to serve 
as a fellow at Harvard University and 
as an adviser to Minnesota’s Hazelden 
treatment center. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill honoring an inspiring American 
leader that proves that everyone de-
serves a second chance. 
Madam Speaker, I have no further 
speakers, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
distinguished gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. PHILLIPS). 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 
772, to designate the post office in 
Wayzata, Minnesota, on the shores of 
Lake Minnetonka as the Jim Ramstad 
Post Office. 
Congressman Ramstad spent 10 years 
representing the 45th District in the 
Minnesota Legislature and 18 years 
representing Minnesota’s Third Dis-
trict in this Chamber. As the current 
Representative for Minnesota’s Third, I 
am humbled to have followed in the 
footsteps of such a gentleman, public 
servant, and statesman. 
Throughout his life in public service 
and throughout his entire life, Jim led 
with principle, with compassion, and 
with grace. His battle with and recov-
ery from alcoholism gave voice to mil-
lions of Americans facing the very 
same challenge and illuminated every 
aspect of his life and his service. 
From the statehouse to this House, 
Jim embodied the spirit of honesty, re-
silience, transparency, and account-
ability. He was a noted consensus seek-
er and a champion of bipartisan poli-
cies to reduce discrimination against 
those suffering from mental health 
challenges and addiction. His signature 
legislation, the Paul Wellstone Mental 
Health Treatment Act, was enacted in 
2008 just before his retirement from 
Congress. 
b 1630 
Congressman Ramstad will go on to 
continue his service as a fellow at Har-
vard University, and as adviser to Min-
nesota’s Hazelden treatment center. He 
lived the final 39 years of his life in so-
briety. 
Congressman Ramstad passed away 
on November 5, 2020, after a battle with 
Parkinson’s disease. 
Naming a post office in Wayzata is a 
small gesture to commemorate the 
passing of a giant of Minnesota poli-
tics. But as former Minnesota State 
Senator and Jim’s former district di-
rector, Paul Anderson, told me: ‘‘Jim 
loved Wayzata, and Wayzata always 
loved Jim back.’’ 
So I send my love to Jim’s wife, 
Kathryn, and to all of his family and 
friends and colleagues who continue to 
mourn his loss. 
May his memory be for a blessing. 
May his spirit and legacy of bipartisan-
ship—and I note that Jim was a Repub-
lican and I am a Democrat—inspire 
this Congress. May his name grace the 
post office in the town he loved and the 
town that loved him back for genera-
tions to come. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Minnesota 
(Mr. PHILLIPS) for his leadership on 
this effort, for his leadership in the 
House, and for reminding me, espe-
cially, that the post office will reside 
in Wayzata, appropriately. 
Madam Speaker, I have no further 
speakers on this side. I urge passage of 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
MFUME) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 772. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

(H.R. 813) to designate the facility of

Albuquerque, New Mexico, as the ‘‘Jose

Mexico, shall be known and designated as 
the ‘‘Jose Hernandez Post Office Building’’. 
(b) REFERENCES.—Any reference in a law, 
map, regulation, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the facility re-
ferred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to 
be a reference to the ‘‘Jose Hernandez Post 
Office Building’’.

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. MFUME) and the gentle-
woman 
from 
South 
Carolina 
(Ms. 
MACE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include any extraneous material on 
this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join 
my colleagues in consideration of H.R. 
813, to designate the facility of the 
United States Postal Service at 1050 
Sunset 
Road 
Southwest 
in 
Albu-
querque, New Mexico, as the Jose Her-
nandez Post Office Building. 
Jose Hernandez was born in 1971, in 
Arizona. He enlisted in the Army after 
graduating from Arizona State Univer-
sity and was stationed in Germany. In 
2003, he deployed to Iraq for 1 year. 
When he was discharged from the 
Army, Mr. Hernandez moved to New 
Mexico with his wife and continued his 
career in public service at the U.S. 
Postal Service. 
New Mexicans on his mail route re-
member the days when they were in a 
rush and Mr. Hernandez would quickly 
go through his mailbag just to get 
them their mail before they had to 
rush on their way. And they remem-
bered the slower days when he would 
join them for a short chat or simply sit 
for a moment to enjoy the weather. 
In April of 2019, letter carrier Jose 
Hernandez was tragically killed while 
protecting a mother in an argument 
with her son. Mr. Hernandez intervened 
to try to peacefully end the dispute, 
but was, instead, shot and killed by the 
young man. 
Mailboxes along his former route 
quickly became memorials, while his 
colleagues made their own memorial at 
his former post office. 
So naming a post office after this dis-
tinguished public servant, who gave his 
life in the line of duty trying to protect 
an innocent woman, I think is the very 
least that this body can do. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 813, a bill that would name an Al-
buquerque, New Mexico, post office 
after Jose Hernandez. 
Mr. Hernandez enlisted in the Army 
after graduating from Arizona State 
University and was then stationed in 
Germany and deployed to Iraq in 2003. 
After his discharge from the Army, 
Jose Hernandez moved to New Mexico 
and began working at the U.S. Postal 
Service as a civil engineer and letter 
carrier. 
In 2009, he was tragically killed while 
protecting a mother in a domestic dis-
pute. He intervened to try to peace-
fully end the fight, but was shot by the 
woman’s son. His hometown mourns 
this tragic loss. 
I urge my colleagues today to sup-
port this legislation honoring a true 
American hero. 
Madam Speaker, I have no further 
speakers, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from New 
Mexico (Ms. HAALAND). 
Ms. HAALAND. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Maryland 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Jose Hernandez, a beloved letter 
carrier and local hero who was killed 
on the job in 2019, while trying to re-
solve an argument along his route. 
Residents who live along his route re-
member Jose as the type of letter car-
rier who would go above and beyond 
the call of duty. His shocking death 
was devastating for our community, 
and more than a year later, we con-
tinue to mourn the loss. 
To honor his legacy, I introduced a 
bill to rename his old workplace in his 
honor. 
Jose Hernandez has served proudly in 
the Army. He has four beautiful chil-
dren and a loving wife, Nikki. He 
served the Albuquerque area U.S. Post-
al Service for 12 years. 
Our letter carriers and postal work-
ers shouldn’t have to worry about their 
safety when they go to work. Those 
who will see Jose’s name on the Five 
Points Post Office will remember him 
as the hero that he was who went above 
and beyond his duty. 
For these reasons and many more, I 
am thankful first for the entire New 
Mexico delegation for their support, 
and for Chairwoman MALONEY’s and 
Chairman RASKIN’s swift work to move 
my bill that will name the post office 
at 1050 Sunset Road Southwest in Albu-
querque to the floor, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of H.R. 813 hon-
oring Mr. Hernandez. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers on this side. I 
thank the gentlewoman from New Mex-
ico for being here as the Secretary-Des-
ignate of the Interior Department. This 
is a confirmation day. So to be at both 
places at the same time is very impor-
tant, and I think it underscores her 
real heartfelt appreciation with respect 
to this legislation and its passage. 
Having said that, I urge passage of 
H.R. 813, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
MFUME) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 813. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H557 
February 23, 2021 
On April 4, 1965, just a week before 
his 36th birthday, he was on a combat 
mission over North Vietnam to bomb 
the Thanh Hoa Bridge. 
Smitty was successful in destroying 
the bridge, but his F–105 fighter plane 
was hit and Smitty was forced to bail 
out over North Vietnam. He was cap-
tured immediately and spent the next 8 
years as a prisoner of war in various 
prisons, where he was confined, mis-
treated, and tortured. 
He is credited with introducing the 
tap code to POWs so that they could 
communicate surreptitiously between 
their cell walls. 
During his distinguished Air Force 
career, Smitty earned two Silver Med-
als, three Legion of Merits, the Distin-
guished Flying Cross, two Bronze Stars 
for valor, two Purple Hearts, and two 
Air Medals as well. 
Smitty retired from the Air Force in 
August of 1979, and entered directly 
into 
the 
University 
of 
Mississippi 
School of Law, joining the Mississippi 
bar in December of 1981. His post-Air 
Force employment included banking 
law and marketing. In October of 2012, 
Colonel Harris was awarded the Life-
time Achievement Award from the Air 
Force Association. 
Tupelo, Mississippi, is the home to 
Smitty and to Louise, their two daugh-
ters, and a son who was born in Oki-
nawa shortly after Smitty was shot 
down. Their spouses, as well as others 
in their family, reside in Tupelo. 
Madam Speaker, we are urging today 
an extra honor for Smitty Harris, a 
true American, by naming this postal 
facility after him. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 208, a bill to name a Mis-
sissippi post office for Colonel Carlyle 
‘‘Smitty’’ Harris. 
Smitty Harris enlisted in the Air 
Force in 1951, and would later go on to 
serve for 28 years as a pilot instructor, 
operations officer, and faculty member 
at the Air War College. 
In 1965, while on a combat mission 
over North Vietnam, Smitty’s F–105 
was struck and he was forced to bail 
out over North Vietnam where he was 
captured. 
He spent the next 8 years as a pris-
oner of war, where he was confined in 
various prisons and tortured. During 
his time in prison, he is known for cre-
ating the tap code, which POWs used to 
communicate secretly between cells. 
After nearly 8 years as a prisoner of 
war, he returned home to the U.S. and 
to his loving family. His son called him 
his hero and role model. But the truth 
is, he is every American’s hero. 
He has earned numerous medals and 
accolades for heroic service on behalf 
our Nation. Those include: two Silver 
Star Medals, three Legion of Merits, 
the Distinguished Flying Cross, two 
Bronze Stars for valor, two Purple 
Hearts, and two Air Medals. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues today to support this legisla-
tion in recognition of this great Amer-
ican hero, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Mis-
sissippi (Mr. KELLY). 
b 1645 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
allowing me to speak today in support 
of H.R. 208 to designate a post office for 
Colonel Carlyle ‘‘Smitty’’ Harris, my 
friend. 
Madam Speaker, he served with one 
of our colleagues and friends here, Mr. 
Sam Johnson, and was in the Hanoi 
Hilton with him for much of the time 
they shared together. I have this long 
speech written, but I want to talk 
about who Carlyle Smitty Harris is. 
He is Smitty to all his friends. You 
would never know that he was a law-
yer; you would never know that he was 
a pilot; you would never know that he 
was a retired colonel. He is such a gen-
tleman and such a role model for our 
entire community. His family are key 
people in the Tupelo area. 
Smitty was shot down and spent al-
most 8 years in the Hanoi Hilton. Dur-
ing that time, he had learned many, 
many years ago, from a sergeant, about 
a tap code they used to communicate 
in World War II. Being one of the first 
10 or 12 prisoners in the Hanoi Hilton, 
they would separate them so that they 
couldn’t communicate. And Smitty 
taught this to all the other members 
when they came in so that they could 
communicate when they were sepa-
rated and segregated as prisoners. 
You would think that 8 years serving 
in the Hanoi Hilton that you would be 
bitter, that you would hate humanity, 
that when you were tortured, you 
would want to be tortured or be mean 
to others, but not Smitty Harris. Colo-
nel Harris is a gentleman of all gentle-
men. He took it, and now he uses his 
faith and all the strength that he 
gained from all those years being away 
from the people and the things that he 
loved, and he is not necessarily happy 
about it, but he is so content with his 
life, and he passes on the lessons that 
he learned. 
I think back when I went to the gov-
ernor’s mansion many years ago, and I 
had my—at the time—17-year-old son. 
Smitty spent about 21⁄2 hours on the 
tour bus with my son talking to him 
about life, about what it meant to be a 
man. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
there 
are 
not 
enough words to describe what Smitty 
Harris has done for this Nation. He is a 
true hero, just like our former col-
league and friend, Sam Johnson, was. 
These guys gave their best to this Na-
tion during the Vietnam war during 
their captivities, but he continues to 
give to his community even today. 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the distin-
guished gentleman for his remarks, and 
I thank him for his service, as well. 
The distinguished gentleman also is a 
Major General of the Army National 
Guard Element, Joint Force in Mis-
sissippi. I don’t take that lightly. I ap-
preciate all he has done, and I appre-
ciate him calling the name of Sam 
Johnson, who I served with previously 
in this body. 
Madam Speaker, I went to the Hanoi 
Hilton as a tourist, and stood there in 
pain looking at what he and Senator 
McCain, and so many others went 
through in that facility. I mean, it just 
brings you back to Earth. And some-
times we take lightly the service. 
Sometimes, we take lightly the fact 
that some of our servicemen and 
women were captured. And sometimes, 
we take lightly the fact that war can 
happen at any time. And when it does 
happen, we hope that it will continue 
to always bring out the best in all of 
us. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to 
stand here and to give these remarks 
from our side of the aisle about 
Smitty. I talk about him as if I know 
him, but when I read about him, I feel 
like I do know him. 
My thanks to the gentleman from 
Mississippi and the gentlewoman from 
South Carolina for leading this discus-
sion on the other side. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I am prepared 
to close. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues today to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
MFUME) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 208. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. CASTEN. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion will be 
postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from

tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BISHOP) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the bill under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the first thing I 
would like to do is thank our distin-
guished chair of the Democratic Cau-
cus, Mr. JEFFRIES, for working with us 
and moving forward on this bill, along 
with the chairman of the full com-
mittee, Mr. NADLER. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 546, the Effec-
tive Assistance of Counsel in the Dig-
ital Era Act requires the Federal Bu-
reau of Prisons to establish a system 
that ensures the confidentiality of all 
privileged electronic communications 
between incarcerated individuals and 
their attorneys or legal representa-
tives. 
H.R. 546 is identical to bipartisan leg-
islation sponsored by Representative 
HAKEEM JEFFRIES last Congress. Last 
September, the House approved this 
bill by voice vote. However, the Senate 
failed to take up the measure prior to 
adjournment. As we move forward 
today, I hope that the House will ap-
prove this bill with broad support, 
again, so that the Senate will take 
swift action and President Biden can 
sign this much-needed proposal into 
law. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 546 addresses 
important constitutional protections 
for criminal defendants, and all of 
these I support. The Sixth Amendment 
to the United States Constitution pro-
vides the right to counsel, to assist in 
the defense of those accused of crimi-
nal offenses. In order to represent their 
clients in an effective manner, defense 
attorneys must have the ability to 
communicate candidly with their cli-
ents. 
The attorney-client privilege, which 
keeps communications between indi-
viduals and their attorneys confiden-
tial, exists in part to foster open com-
munications. This privilege is a funda-
mental component of the effective as-
sistance of counsel guaranteed by the 
Constitution. Of course, this privilege 
does not protect communications be-
tween a client and an attorney made in 
furtherance of or in order to cover up a 
crime or fraud, also known as the 
crime-fraud exception. We understand 
that. 
Outside of any custody setting, de-
fendants are less constrained in their 
ability to have candid conversations 
with their attorneys. Generally, out-of- 
custody defendants can go to their at-
torneys’ offices, speak with them freely 
on the phone, or send written or elec-
tronic correspondence without fear of 
interference or monitoring. To an ex-
tent, in-custody defendants also have 
these protections. 
For example, in the Federal system, 
Bureau of Prisons’ regulations ensure 
that inmates can meet with their at-
torneys without auditory supervision. 
Current regulations also allow con-
fidential phone calls and letters be-
tween inmates and their attorneys. But 
these same protections do not apply to 
email communications for the nearly 
152,000 individuals currently in Federal 
custody, including those in pretrial de-
tention who have not been convicted of 
any crime. 
I know that my colleagues can see 
that that is definitively a denial of the 
civil rights, civil liberties, and the 
criminal justice rights that these indi-
viduals should have access to. 
H.R. 546 would ensure that all com-
munications between attorneys and 
their clients remain confidential, in-
cluding email. 
Madam Speaker, over a decade ago, 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons recog-
nized the growing importance of email, 
which is important in providing effi-
cient and swift communications be-
tween inmates and individuals on the 
outside. 
Since 2009, Bureau of Prisons’ in-
mates have been able to access emails

through 
a 
system 
known 
as 
TRULINCS. However, TRULINCS re-
quires inmates and their contacts to 
consent to monitoring of all commu-
nications, even email exchanges be-
tween inmates and their attorneys. 
That, I think we all understand, is un-
fair. 
Madam Speaker, during the last dec-
ade, email has grown rapidly and is the 
primary means of communication be-
tween inmates and their attorneys. 
During the current pandemic, emails 
have become even more important 
given how difficult it is for attorneys 
to meet with their clients. 
Without appropriate safeguards, the 
Bureau of Prisons risks severely hin-
dering the effective representation of 
inmates by limiting attorney-client 
privilege for electronic communica-
tions. Therefore, H.R. 546 would require 
the Bureau to implement an adequate 
system to ensure that these attorney- 
client communications remain con-
fidential—again, a constitutional pro-
vision or principle of the right to coun-
sel. 
H.R. 546 also includes additional pro-
tections, including the requirement of 
the contents of electronic communica-
tions be destroyed when an inmate is 
released from prison, as well as author-
izing the suppression of evidence ob-
tained or derived from access to infor-
mation that is in violation of the pro-
visions set forth in the bill. 
Madam Speaker, this is an important 
bill. Its time is now. I commend our 
colleague, Representative JEFFRIES, for 
his effort and leadership in developing 
this bipartisan legislation. This pro-
posal has already received broad sup-
port by the House during the last Con-
gress, and now we must act swiftly to 
see it enacted into law, moving to the 
United States Senate, and seeing the 
United States Senate act quickly for it 
to be signed by President Joe Biden. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to join us in support of this bill 
today, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Judiciary, Committee, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 546, the bipartisan ‘‘Effective Assist-
ance of Counsel in the Digital Era Act,’’ re-
introduced by Congressman JEFFRIES of New 
York, legislation that ensures that email com-
munications between people in Federal Bu-
reau of Prisons (BOP) custody and their legal 
teams are protected with the same privilege 
as legal visits, letters, and phone calls. 
This legislation was reported out of the Judi-
ciary Committee unanimously in the 116th 
Congress and was passed in the House 
twice—once as part of a COVID relief bill and 
later without objection on the House floor. 
The principles of justice, fairness, and due 
process upon which our legal system is built 
necessitate confidentiality between the ac-
cused and their defense counsel. 
Attorney client privilege is one of the oldest 
privileges for confidential communications and 
has been an important part of the American 
legal system for hundreds of years. 
This privilege is critical when clients are in 
custody, and the form of communication— 
whether it be in person, by letter, by tele-
phone, or by email—should have no bearing 
on that protection. 
Currently, individuals held in BOP facilities 
are uniformly denied the ability to have privi-
leged communications with their lawyers 
through TRULINCS, the only email system 
available to them. 
In order to use the BOP system, incarcer-
ated individuals must sign a waiver acknowl-
edging that their communications may be 
monitored. 
Without signing the waiver, they cannot use 
the email system, cutting off any opportunity to 
communicate electronically. 
The need for access to privileged email is 
long overdue, and it is more critical than ever 
today. 
As the COVID pandemic has raged across 
the country and spread through detention fa-
cilities, BOP has restricted in-person visits, 
and unmonitored calls and legal mail are more 
difficult to use. 
But incarcerated clients’ need to have ac-
cess to their lawyers is undiminished, and in 
many instances is heightened by the delays 
and fears brought on by the pandemic. 
Email is the safest and most cost-effective 
means of communicating. 
The Effective Assistance of Counsel in the 
Digital Era Act remedies many of these con-
cerns by striking the right balance between the 
government’s limited interest in accessing cer-
tain email communications with a warrant and 
the need to properly protect communications 
subject to the attorney-client privilege. 
This legislation will only require the Depart-
ment of Justice to change procedures con-
cerning attorney-client communications and 
still maintains the ability for United States At-
torneys to access other emails. 
Privileged communication is the cornerstone 
of attorney-client relationships and inseparable 
from the due process rights on which the U.S. 
legal system is founded. 
It is past time for BOP to bring its policies 
into the 21st century and ensure that elec-
tronic communications between people in cus-
tody and their legal teams are protected. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 546, the ‘‘Effective Assistance of Counsel 
in the Digital Era Act.’’ 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 546, the Effective Assist-
ance of Counsel in the Digital Era Act. 
This bill will modernize our criminal 
justice system by extending attorney- 
client privilege to electronic commu-
nication sent or received through the 
Bureau of Prisons’ email system. This 
will ensure that incarcerated individ-
uals can communicate with their attor-
neys efficiently and privately, as it 
should be. 
Under the legislation, the Bureau of 
Prisons will be prohibited from moni-
toring privileged email communica-
tions between incarcerated individuals 
and that individual’s attorney. 
The attorney-client privilege is a 
vital component of our legal system 
that ensures a criminal defendant has 
an effective advocate in the courtroom. 
Emails between incarcerated individ-
uals and their attorneys should fall 
under the attorney-client protections, 
but currently, that is not the case. 
This bill will protect the rights of in-
carcerated men and women to speak 
openly and honestly with their attor-
neys via email, without fear that the 
prosecution is monitoring those com-
munications. Other methods of commu-
nication, such as in-person meetings 
and letters, can be particularly burden-
some and time-consuming. Even if an 
attorney is near the incarcerated cli-
ent, it can take hours to travel to a de-
tention facility and visit with the cli-
ent. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 546 requires 
the Attorney General to ensure that 
BOP’s email system excludes the con-
tents of electronic communications be-
tween an incarcerated person and his 
or her attorney from the current email 
monitoring process. 
The bill stipulates that the protec-
tions and limitations associated with 
the attorney-client privilege, including 
the crime-fraud exception, apply to 
electronic communications sent or re-
ceived through the BOP email system. 
The BOP will be allowed to retain elec-
tronic communications until the incar-
cerated person is released, but the bill 
specifies that the contents may only be 
accessed 
under 
very 
limited 
cir-
cumstances. 
Finally, H.R. 546 allows a court to 
suppress evidence obtained or derived 
from access to the retained emails if 
the emails were accessed in violation 
of the act. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting H.R. 
546, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
JEFFRIES), the sponsor and author of 
this bill, the chairman of the Demo-
cratic Caucus.

Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished gentlewoman, 
my good friend from Texas (Ms. JACK-
SON LEE), for yielding and for her tre-
mendous leadership on so many dif-
ferent criminal justice issues, includ-
ing with respect to this particular 
piece of legislation. I thank the distin-
guished gentleman from North Caro-
lina (Mr. BISHOP) for his support as 
well. 
I rise to support H.R. 546, the Effec-
tive Assistance of Counsel in the Dig-
ital Era Act, a critical bipartisan bill 
to protect the constitutional right to 
effective representation. This legisla-
tion passed the House last Congress, 
and I urge my colleagues to pass it 
once again today. 
The Sixth Amendment to the Con-
stitution provides that in all criminal 
prosecutions, the accused shall have 
the assistance of counsel for his or her 
defense. An attorney must be fully in-
formed about the facts of the case in 
order to effectively represent a client

and provide the best possible legal ad-
vice and guidance. That is why con-
fidential communication between at-
torneys and their clients is so critical 
and why the attorney-client privilege 
must be protected. 
In Lanza v. New York, the Supreme 
Court stated that even in a jail, or per-
haps especially there, the relationships 
which the law has endowed with par-
ticularized confidentiality must con-
tinue to receive unceasing protection. 
There are nearly 124,000 individuals 
currently in BOP custody, many of 
whom are in pretrial detention and 
have not been convicted of a crime. In 
our system, defendants, American citi-
zens, are innocent until proven guilty. 
Like any person involved in a criminal 
proceeding, these individuals who are 
incarcerated must be able to confiden-
tially communicate with their attor-
neys. 
The bipartisan Effective Assistance 
of Counsel in the Digital Era Act would 
enable incarcerated individuals to com-
municate with their legal representa-
tives privately, safely, and efficiently 
by prohibiting the Bureau of Prisons 
from monitoring privileged electronic 
communications. 
While BOP regulations do protect the 
confidentiality of in-person attorney 
visits, phone calls, and traditional 
mail, no such protections exist in the 
context of email communications sent 
through the BOP’s electronic mail sys-
tem. 
This 
system, 
known 
as 
TRULINCS, has become the easiest, 
fastest, and most efficient method of 
communication available to incarcer-
ated individuals and their attorneys. 
Let’s consider the alternatives. Even 
a brief client visit can take hours when 
you factor in travel and wait times. 
Confidential phone calls are perhaps 
useful, but they are subject to time 
limitations and can be difficult to 
schedule even for urgent legal matters. 
Postal mail must first be opened and 
inspected by staff for physical contra-
band, which can significantly extend 
the time it takes for the communica-
tion to reach an incarcerated indi-
vidual. 
These delays should be unnecessary 
in a prison system that permits elec-
tronic communications and would be 
available if the attorney-client privi-
lege was consistently applied. 
To address this serious problem, H.R. 
546 would require the Attorney General 
to ensure that the BOP email system 
excludes from monitoring the contents 
of electronic communications between 
an incarcerated person and their attor-
ney. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I yield the gentleman from New York 
(Mr. JEFFRIES) an additional 1 minute. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. The BOP will be per-
mitted to retain the contents of these 
messages until the incarcerated person 
is released, but they would be acces-
sible only under limited circumstances. 
The bill is supported by a wide vari-
ety of groups, including the American 
Bar Association, ACLU, Americans for 
Prosperity, Dream Corps, Due Process 
Institute, National Action Network, 
Prison Fellowship, Right on Crime, 
Faith and Freedom Coalition, FAMM, 
Federal public and community defend-
ers organizations, and so many others. 
I want to thank all the sponsors of 
this bill, most particularly Representa-
tives VAN TAYLOR, JERRY NADLER, TOM 
MCCLINTOCK, DON BACON, NANCY MACE, 
and SHEILA JACKSON LEE, as well as 
DAN
CRENSHAW
and DUSTY
JOHNSON. 
This has truly been a bipartisan jour-
ney. 
Our criminal justice system depends 
on the attorney-client privilege to en-
sure effective representation. I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 546. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I have no further 
speakers, and I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
I wanted to say my compliments to 
the gentleman from New York in pur-
suit of this bill and the things he spoke 
to about the presumption of innocence 
and the right to counsel, among those 
sacred core rights that our Constitu-
tion guarantees to every individual in 
this country. This important bipar-
tisan bill is preservative of that. 
That is what we do in this Chamber. 
That is what this Congress should al-
ways do. So my compliments to the 
gentleman from New York and the co-
sponsors on this piece of legislation. I 
encourage my fellow Members to sup-
port it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Let me thank the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP) for his col-
legial response and his very important 
remarks on collaboration for impor-
tant legislation like this. 
Let me also thank the distinguished 
gentleman from New York for finding 
an Achilles’ heel that would really and 
continues to undermine the true sense 
of attorney-client privilege and to re-
spect that privilege, whether you are in 
custody or not, and also recognizes the 
increasing utilization of the digital 
world to file briefs, to make argu-
ments, and, of course, to find that di-
vide between those in-custody inmates 
incarcerated and those that are not in 
custody. We are now moving to exten-
sive virtual court proceedings. 
As we well know, individuals in cus-
tody are making a number of efforts to 
prove their innocence. They are appeal-
ing. They are seeking new trials. They, 
too, have rights that should be re-
spected under both the Criminal Code 
and the Constitution. 
So, again, I thank the gentleman for 
his thoughtfulness and all the bipar-
tisan cosponsors that he has. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 546 would en-
sure that the attorney-client privilege, 
again, is safeguarded in all commu-
nications between criminal defendants 
and their attorneys. This bipartisan 
legislation addresses an issue that is 
essential to the fair administration of 
the criminal justice system. 
During this ongoing pandemic, this 
measure has become even more urgent 
when there is even more reliance on 
electronic communications between at-
torneys and incarcerated individuals. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
bipartisan legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 546. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion will be 
postponed.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on the bill under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, as I always do, let 
me thank the sponsor of this legisla-
tion for her leadership, the gentle-
woman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ), and all of those who have 
supported this important leadership 
bill. 
H.R. 1192, the Puerto Rico Recovery 
Accuracy 
In 
Disclosures 
Act, 
or 
PRRADA, is commonsense legislation 
that would promote greater trans-
parency and integrity with respect to 
the ongoing financial reorganization of 
Puerto Rico. 
In response to dire fiscal issues fac-
ing Puerto Rico at the time, Congress 
passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Man-
agement, and Economic Stability Act, 
or PROMESA, in 2016. That legislation 
established a financial oversight and 
management board with control over 
Puerto Rico’s budget, laws, financial 
plans, and regulations and the author-
ity to retain professionals to assist the 
board in executing its responsibilities. 
Though largely patterned on Chapter 
11 of the Bankruptcy Code, PROMESA 
did not incorporate all facets of Chap-
ter 11 and other relevant provisions of 
the code. Importantly, this includes 
the code’s mandatory disclosure re-
quirements regarding actual or poten-
tial conflicts of interest that profes-
sional persons seeking to be retained in 
a bankruptcy case must make to the 
court prior to their retention. 
This bill would close that loophole by 
conditioning the compensation of pro-
fessional 
persons 
retained 
under 
PROMESA upon certain disclosures 
similar to those required under the 
Bankruptcy Code. 
Additionally, the bill would require 
the United States Trustee to review 
these disclosures and submit comments 
in response to the court and also au-
thorize the United States Trustee to 
object to compensation requested by 
the professionals. 
Finally, H.R. 1192 would allow courts 
to deny compensation for services and 
reimbursement of expenses if the pro-
fessional person did not comply with 
the disclosure requirement, was not a 
disinterested person, or represented or 
held an interest adverse to the bank-
ruptcy estate. 
I thank Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ for her lead-
ership in championing this bill and for 
her relentless dedication, which we all 
have witnessed, to ensuring that the 
people of Puerto Rico receive the fair, 
efficient, 
and 
transparent 
restruc-
turing process they deserve. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, which was passed out of the House 
last Congress by a unanimous vote. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Judiciary, Committee, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 1192, the ‘‘Puerto Rico Recovery Ac-
curacy in Disclosures Act of 2021’’ or 
‘‘PRRADA Act,’’ which conditions compensa-
tion of professional persons retained under the 
congressionally passed ‘‘Puerto Rico Over-
sight, Management, and Economic Stability 
Act’’ (‘‘PROMESA’’) upon the applicant pro-
viding certain disclosures similar to those re-
quired under Bankruptcy Code section 327. 
In response to dire fiscal issues facing Puer-
to Rico at the time, Congress passed Pub. L. 
114–187, the ‘‘Puerto Rico Oversight, Man-
agement, and Economic Stability Act’’ or 
‘‘PROMESA’’ in 2016, legislation I strongly 
supported and cosponsored. 
The Act established the Financial Oversight 
and Management Board (Board), a fiscal con-
trol board comprised of seven members that 
would have control over Puerto Rico’s budget, 
laws, financial plans, and regulations. 
It empowered the board to propose a budg-
et for Puerto Rico and restructure its obliga-
tions owed to bondholders, estimated to be 
$6.5 billion, and other creditors. 
Although largely patterned on chapter 11 of 
the Bankruptcy Code, PROMESA did not in-
corporate all facets of chapter 11 and other 
relevant provisions of the Code. 
For example, although the Board is author-
ized to retain and compensate professional 
persons in connection with its efforts to reor-
ganize Puerto Rico, PROMESA does not in-
clude certain restrictions that the Bankruptcy 
Code requires for such purposes. 
For example, Section 327 of the Bankruptcy 
Code, unlike PROMESA, authorizes profes-
sional persons, such as attorneys, financial 
advisors, appraisers, and others, to be re-
tained in connection with the administration of 
a bankruptcy case provided they meet the fol-
lowing conditions: first, such a person must 
not hold or represent an interest adverse to 
the bankruptcy estate; and second, the profes-
sional must be a ‘‘disinterested person.’’ 
As I indicated at the outset, H.R. 1192, the 
‘‘Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclo-
sures Act of 2021’’ or ‘‘PRRADA,’’ conditions 
compensation of professional persons retained 
under PROMESA upon the applicant providing 
certain disclosures similar to those required 
under Bankruptcy Code section 327. 
In addition, it would require the United 
States Trustee to review such disclosures and 
submit comments in response to the court as 
well as authorize the United States trustee to 
object to compensation requested by profes-
sionals. Further, the measure would apply 
retroactively to professionals who have pre-
viously been awarded compensation. 
Finally, H.R. 1192 would authorize the court 
to deny allowance of compensation for serv-
ices and reimbursement of expenses accruing 
after the bill’s enactment date if the profes-
sional person did not comply with the disclo-
sure requirement, was not a disinterested per-
son, or represented or held an interest ad-
verse to the bankruptcy estate. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 1192, the ‘‘Puerto Rico Recovery Accu-
racy in Disclosures Act of 2021.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. I 
yield myself as much time as I may 
consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H562 
February 23, 2021 
I rise today in support of the Puerto 
Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures 
Act. 
In 2016, Puerto Rico was experiencing 
significant financial pressures brought 
on by sizable debt and related obliga-
tions. In response to Puerto Rico’s fi-
nancial crisis, Congress enacted the 
Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, 
and Economic Stability Act of 2016. 
The 2016 law established a bankruptcy 
mechanism for Puerto Rico to address 
its obligations. 
Like the general bankruptcy law, the 
2016 law enables bankruptcy profes-
sionals, like accountants, consultants, 
and lawyers, to apply for payment for 
their services upon court approval. But 
the 2016 law omitted disclosure require-
ments that apply to compensated pro-
fessionals in proceedings under the 
general Bankruptcy Code, title 11 of 
the United States Code, pursuant to 
rule 2014(a) of the Federal Rules of 
Bankruptcy Procedure. 
Most significantly, the gap in the 
2016 law created a potential for undis-
closed compensation terms and undis-
covered conflicts of interest vis-a-vis 
parties of interest for professionals 
serving in Puerto Rico’s bankruptcy. 
To address this concern, this bill ap-
plies the disclosure requirements of 
rule 2014(a) to professionals serving in 
connection with Puerto Rico’s bank-
ruptcy and seeking compensation for 
those services. 
The bill also requires oversight of the 
disclosures that bankruptcy profes-
sionals make. 
This bill’s disclosure and oversight 
requirements increase the likelihood 
that conflicts of interest will be caught 
and timely addressed before compensa-
tion decisions are made. 
Taken as a whole, this added trans-
parency will benefit important inter-
ests, such as those of creditors and tax-
payers—and ultimately, of Puerto Rico 
itself. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1715 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ), the 
author of this legislation and also a 
champion, as all Members of the 
United States Congress know, during 
the very trying and difficult times of 
our friends in Puerto Rico. It is her 
voice that has been the most singularly 
powerful in their advocacy, along with 
her wonderful colleague, the distin-
guished representative, the Resident 
Commissioner from Puerto Rico. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 1192. I 
was proud to introduce this bill with 
bipartisan support in the House. 
I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank Speaker of the House NANCY 
PELOSI and Chairman JERRY NADLER 
for bringing this legislation to the 
floor, and Mr. BISHOP, the ranking 
member of the subcommittee, and Sen-
ator BOB MENENDEZ for introducing a 
companion bill in the Senate. 
The Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy 
in Disclosures Act of 2021, or PRRADA, 
eliminates a double standard currently 
facing Puerto Rico. Under U.S. Code 
and Federal bankruptcy procedure, any 
conflicts of interest, or even the per-
ception of such conflict, between those 
working on the bankruptcy and the 
debtor are required to be disclosed. 
However, a loophole in the current law 
prevents this requirement from being 
extended to the people of Puerto Rico. 
In 2016, Congress passed the Puerto 
Rico Oversight, Management, and Eco-
nomic Stability Act, or PROMESA, to 
set up an orderly bankruptcy process 
to restructure its debt, stimulate eco-
nomic development, and put the island 
on a path to financial recovery. This 
bill will extend current U.S. law, re-
quiring disclosures of conflicts of inter-
est to Puerto Rico, thereby improving 
transparency and restoring confidence 
in the island’s future. 
Puerto Ricans should be confident 
that the board’s bankruptcy advisers 
do not have their thumb on the scale to 
favor certain debts where they have a 
self-interest. This bipartisan bill en-
sures integrity of the PROMESA proc-
ess. 
While we can have different opinions 
on how effectively the oversight board 
is carrying out its mission, one thing 
should be clear: The island’s residents 
should be entitled to the same rights 
and protections as any debtor on the 
mainland. 
Once more, I would like to thank 
Chairman NADLER, the staff, and the 
bipartisan cosponsors of the bill. I 
strongly encourage all Members to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this critical piece of leg-
islation. I also would like to recognize 
the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico 
(Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N), who is a co-
sponsor of the bill. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico 
(Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the Puerto 
Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures 
Act, H.R. 1192. 
Representative VELA´ ZQUEZ and my-
self have proposed this bipartisan ini-
tiative in the last two Congresses, hav-
ing achieved passage in the House dur-
ing the last session. I think Congress-
woman VELA´ ZQUEZ is very thoughtful 
in terms of how important this is and 
the effects on PROMESA regarding 
this bill. 
We support this bill as an important 
component in ensuring the restruc-
turing process under PROMESA, and it 
looks out for Puerto Rico’s interests. 
This legislation requires any counsel 
and professional personnel that the fi-
nancial oversight board may hire to 
work on a title III case for the restruc-
turing of Puerto Rico’s debt to submit 
verified disclosures of their connec-
tions with the debtor, creditors, or per-
sons employed by the oversight board 
prior to being compensated. 
These provisions extend the same re-
quirements to decisions about the hir-
ing of personnel for the restructuring 
as are imposed on such personnel under 
existing bankruptcy rules. I think it is 
important to have the same kind of 
rules for those people who are going to 
be managing, as we speak, those kinds 
of negotiations. 
Our intention is not to exclude any 
people with expertise and knowledge 
about Puerto Rico’s fiscal transactions 
from being resources in the restruc-
turing process, but I think it is essen-
tial that any such connection be clear 
and known so that such persons’ quali-
fications and the role they are going to 
be playing can be better evaluated. 
Conflict of interest, or the appear-
ance of a conflict of interest, can be 
best avoided if there are accountability 
and transparency during the process. 
This bill would allow that to happen. 
This bill would require that such per-
sonnel must disclose in detail their 
participation and involvement with 
any entity involved in the issuance of 
Puerto Rico’s debt and in any claims 
involving Puerto Rico’s debt, inform-
ing the identity of each one. 
Anyone who is serving in the board— 
and I repeat, anyone who is serving in 
the board—working to inform its deci-
sions, or representing it before the title 
III court, must have the trust of all 
parties that they are committed to de-
fending the interests of Puerto Rico to 
the best of their ability in accordance 
to the law and justice. 
A lack of transparency in personnel 
decisions creates a lack of confidence 
and distrust. Learning that someone 
was involved in the business of one of 
the parties in the case, only after they 
are named and working on the case, 
does not create assurance of their com-
mitment to the best interests of Puerto 
Rico or even managing the debt. 
Our goal must be to reach the day 
that we will no longer need the provi-
sions of PROMESA or the fiscal over-
sight board, and we can dedicate our-
selves to rebuild our economy and pro-
vide for growth. But until that hap-
pens, we must demand that those in-
struments created by PROMESA be ac-
countable and transparent in their 
processes. Anything else should be un-
acceptable. 
That is the reason this bill, H.R. 1192, 
is important, and I ask my colleagues 
to support and pass this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I say thank you to 
the Congresswoman from New York 
(Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) for this bill and for al-
lowing this initiative to be a bipartisan 
one. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Puerto Rico, and I thank 
the gentlewomen from Texas and New 
York. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H563 
February 23, 2021 
Madam Speaker, let me indicate 
again, this is a very vital initiative to 
continue to help in Puerto Rico’s re-
covery. Let me thank the gentlewoman 
from New York for her leadership and, 
of course, the gentlewoman from Puer-
to Rico. This partnership and bipar-
tisan collaboration with the other co-
sponsors is very crucial as we continue 
to work as a Congress to do our job for 
the people of Puerto Rico. 
H.R. 1192 closes a loophole under cur-
rent law by establishing disclosure re-
quirements regarding actual or poten-
tial conflicts of interest in the bank-
ruptcy process under PROMESA. In 
doing so, this legislation promotes 
transparency and accountability in the 
Puerto Rico restructuring process. 
Again, I thank my colleague, Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ from New York, the author 
of the bill, for her leadership on this 
issue, and Mr. NADLER and his work. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to sup-
port this commonsense measure. This, 
of course, along with the gentlewoman 
from Puerto Rico, is helping the people 
of Puerto Rico, our neighbors and our 
fellow Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1192. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being

MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR THE 
LOSSES CAUSED BY COVID–19 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
just a few minutes ago, Members stood 
on the steps of the United States Con-
gress, reminiscent of the unity of this 
Nation and the words of our Pledge of 
Allegiance that we stand united. 
I rise to offer words of condolence 
and remembrance for the 500,000 lives 
taken by COVID–19. The Nation, over 
the last 12 months, has faced a crucible 
of suffering, death, and disease that 
has taken lives, devastated the econ-
omy, and put millions at risk of great-
er hardship due to the death of a loved 
one, unemployment, loss of healthcare 
or forgone education opportunities. 
I continue to remember the little 4- 
year-old boy in Texas who lost both of 
his parents; or those who continue to 
mourn losing a mom, dad, husband, 
wife, children, yes, and siblings. 
Yesterday, as the news broke that 
this Nation has lost 500,000—more than 
World War I, World War II, the Korean 
war, and the Vietnam war—my heart 
was heavy, and this loss is a sad mark. 
So I come today to this floor to say 
to those who have lost: You will never 
be forgotten. 
To those who remain: Your loved one 
will never be forgotten. Their lives will 
not be in vain. Their deaths will not be 
in vain. 
And though these are staggering pro-
portions, 
our 
commitment 
as 
the 
United States Congress should be to 
ensure this moment. 
Madam Speaker, I end by a quiet mo-
ment of silence at this moment. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to offer words of 
condolence and remembrance for the five 
hundred thousand lives taken by COVID–19. 
The Nation over the last twelve months has 
faced a crucible of suffering, death, and dis-
ease that has taken too many lives, dev-
astated the economy and put millions at risk of 
greater hardship due to the death of a loved 
one, unemployment, loss of health care or for-
gone education opportunities. 
Yesterday, as news broke that the Nation 
had reached the milestone of losing five hun-
dred thousand people to COVID–19, I was at 
the dedication of a Community Vaccination 
Center at the NRG Stadium located in Hous-
ton Texas. 
Today, with a heavy heart our nation sadly 
marks the loss of 500,000 American lives to 
the coronavirus: an unimaginable human toll in 
our modern era of medical and technological 
advances. 
These deaths are of staggering proportions 
and cause incomprehensible sadness, but we 
cannot think of them as the end of COVID–19. 
As we have learned COVID–19 can surge 
again claiming even more lives. 
This is why we cannot be complacent by ac-
cepting so much death without continuing to 
fight to save lives and end this pandemic. 
Every life lost is a profound tragedy and 
earth-shattering moment in the lives of fami-
lies, neighborhoods, and communities that 
touch each of us in countless ways as we 
mourn and console our family members, co-
workers, neighbors and friends. 
Today, I joined my colleagues of the House 
to observe a moment of silence on the steps 
of the Capitol for the 500,000 lives lost. 
Members of Congress will join tens of mil-
lions of Americans in prayer for the lives lost 
or devastated by this vicious virus. 
As we pray, we must commit ourselves to 
honoring those we have lost by wearing face 
coverings, observing social distance, washing 
of hands—and most important getting the vac-
cine when it is our time to do so as a pledge 
to all who have been taken from us far too 
soon that we will act swiftly to put an end to 
this pandemic and to stem the suffering felt by 
so many. 
My commitment is to save lives and also 
livelihoods through public and personal action. 
As Texans work to overcome the tragic win-
ter disaster that befell the state last week, I 
wrote to President Biden asking that he grant 
the state’s request for a Presidential Disaster 
Declaration, which he did and today FEMA is 
on the ground providing water delivery, food 
distribution, and other vital services to help 
Texans get back on their feet. 
I also encourage those who have lost health 
insurance during the economic crisis created 
by the COVID–19 pandemic to take advantage 
of the extended enrollment period for getting 
health 
insurance 
through 
healthcare.gov, 
which is open until May 15, 2021. 
Currently, 
36 
states 
are 
using 
HealthCare.gov. Since President Biden an-
nounced the creation of the Special Enroll-
ment Period for HealthCare.gov, all 14 states 
and D.C. that have their own state-based mar-
ketplaces have announced that they would 
also have Special Enrollment Periods. 
President Biden has extended a lifeline to 
struggling small businesses, to save American 
jobs and power the American economy, while 
promoting equity and fairness across Main 
Street. 
The reforms he had made will expand ac-
cess to the Paycheck Protection Program 
(PPP) to the hardest-hit businesses that an-
chor our low and middle-income and commu-
nities of color. 
Importantly, they will ensure that sole propri-
etors, which are overwhelmingly women and 
minorities, and which also serve our immigrant 
communities, are not left behind. 
My unwavering support of these Biden Ad-
ministration reforms will also build on recent 
PPP successes that increase assistance to 
businesses with ten or fewer employees in un-
derserved and rural areas. 
They also build on the work of increasing 
assistance through community-based lenders 
that specialize in serving those markets. 
As President Biden advances these actions, 
I can say with pride that I participated in the 
Budget Committee’s Markup of the American 
Rescue Plan intended to end COVID–19 pan-
demic and save the nation’s economy. 
Real Help is on the way. We will win this 
battle against COVID and save the economy 
by working together. 
I conclude with these words ‘‘Precious Lord 
take my hand’’ and lead me on. We will to-
gether win the battle. 
f 
PENN STATE THON 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to give a 
big thank-you to Penn State students 
for their commitment to an incredible 
cause. 
Each year, students spend countless 
hours raising awareness and money in 
the fight against pediatric cancer. 
Every February, these efforts cul-
minate in a 46-hour dance marathon 
known as THON. 
THON provides financial and emo-
tional support to thousands of families 
across the Commonwealth who have a 
child battling pediatric cancer. 
THON is normally a celebration of 
thousands in the Bryce Jordan Center 
on campus—an opportunity for chil-
dren with cancer to focus on simply 
being a kid even just for the weekend. 
Sadly, 
the 
pandemic 
forced 
this 
proud tradition online this year. How-
ever, despite a global pandemic, stu-
dents still managed to raise $10.6 mil-
lion this year. 
Since 1973, Penn State students have 
raised more than $180 million. Those 
figures, combined with nearly 17,000 
student volunteers, makes Penn State 
THON the largest student-run philan-
thropic effort in the world. 
I am proud of the Penn State stu-
dents who are so committed to this 
cause, and I am even more proud of the 
children and families who keep fight-
ing.

BLACK 
HISTORY 
MONTH: 
HON-
ORING COBB COUNTY SHERIFF 
CRAIG OWENS 
(Mrs. MCBATH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, as 
we celebrate Black History Month, I 
rise today in honor of a trailblazer in 
Black history, Cobb County Sheriff 
Craig Owens. 
This past November, Sheriff Owens 
made history as the first African 
American to be elected sheriff in Cobb 
County, in my district. 
Born and raised in Atlanta, Sheriff 
Owens has served over 30 years in the 
Army, Army National Guard, Army Re-
serve, and Cobb County Police Depart-
ment. His career in law enforcement 
utilizes the leadership skills that he 
gained from his experience serving in 
our Armed Forces.

Sheriff Owens leads by putting people 
first, and I am so proud of the work he 
is doing to unite Cobb County and in-
still faith and trust in its police de-
partment. As one of his constituents 
and as a partner in service to Cobb 
County, it is my honor and privilege to 
recognize Sheriff Owens today.

REMEMBERING TOM SEIPEL, JR. 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember and 
honor Tom Seipel, Jr., who passed 
away on February 13. 
Tom had a heart for enriching the 
lives of countless children, and it 
shined in all he did. 
After graduating from Ohio State 
University, he moved to Seoul, South 
Korea, to teach English to kinder-
gartners. Tom then returned to the 
U.S. to serve as a children’s minister in 
Kentucky for several years. 
He later selflessly moved to Nica-
ragua, where he opened and operated a 
children’s ministry to provide meals 
and afterschool tutoring for the poor 
children of Managua. While there, Tom 
also taught at Nicaragua Christian 
Academy. 
In his final years before losing his 
hard-fought battle with cancer, he re-
ceived treatment in Savannah, Geor-
gia. 
Tom’s legacy will surely live on for 
many years to come, and I am thankful 
for the positive impact he made on 
countless lives. My thoughts and pray-
ers go out to all who knew and loved 
him, especially the love of his life, 
Margarita, and their daughter, Mia Isa-
bella. 
f 
RECOGNIZING MACOMB AND 
OAKLAND COUNTY STUDENTS 
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
rise 
to 
recognize 
the 
Macomb and Oakland County students 
who participated in my inaugural 
Ninth District MLK Jr. Day Youth 
Conference. These students brought 
their whole brilliant, vulnerable, and 
idealistic selves to the table to zero in 
on what Dr. King’s life is really about: 
transforming society to be more just. 
COVID–19 has exposed deep inequal-
ities in every facet of life, especially 
for Black Americans, who are nearly 
two times as likely as White Ameri-
cans to die of COVID–19. Imagine what 
we could do to end these disparities if 
we honor Dr. King by emulating his 
work. 
Having 
watched 
these 
students 
sponge up lessons on the true premise 
of MLK Day—achieving social justice— 
and make plans to fight for change in 
their own lives and communities, I am 
energized and hopeful that we can bold-
ly champion justice and equality in 
Congress. I can think of no better way 
of marking Black History Month than 
that.

RECOGNIZING 
PARRY 
McCLUER 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
BOYS’ 
BASKET-
BALL TEAM 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Parry McCluer High 
School boys’ basketball team that won 
the Virginia Class 1 State champion-
ship this weekend. 
After trailing by 8 in the first quar-
ter to Altavista, the Fighting Blues 
lived up to their name and battled 
back—leading by 2 at halftime. In the 
locker room, Coach Cartolaro told his 
team to go out and attack in the third 
quarter. And attack they did. Quickly 
outscoring 10–2, the Blues opened up 
their lead and never looked back. When 
the 
final 
buzzer 
sounded, 
Parry 
McCluer had pulled off a 17-point vic-
tory, securing the school’s best-ever 
boys’ 
basketball 
championship 
and 
closing the season with an impressive 
12–1 record. 
I applaud Coach Cartolaro and the 
entire team for their fortitude and per-
severance these past few months. They 
overcame every obstacle presented to 
them and brought home the trophy to 
Buena Vista. 
Congratulations to the Blues. This 
achievement is well-deserved and their 
community is proud of their hard 
work. 
f 
EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW 
(Ms. TITUS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Equality Act. 
For far too long our Nation has failed 
to read and live up to the words that 
adorn the front of the United States 
Supreme Court: Equal Justice Under 
Law. 
We now have a rare opportunity to 
explicitly push our Nation to live up to 
its founding ideals and make that 
phrase ring true for all Americans. No 
matter who you are or whom you love, 
under the Equality Act you will be 
guaranteed the exact same protections 
as everybody else. 
LGBTQ individuals should not have 
to worry when they try to access a 
small business loan, seek healthcare, 
or buy a home. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to co-
sponsor this historic civil rights legis-
lation, and I look forward to casting 
my vote in support of its passage. 
f 
REMEMBERING RUSH LIMBAUGH 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise tonight in sadness to acknowledge 
and commemorate the loss of an Amer-
ican icon, Rush Limbaugh, who, since 
1985, extolled the virtues of conserv-
atism on radio. 
Starting in Sacramento, California, 
for the first 3 years, 1985 to 1988, he was 
within range of my tractor and my 
pickup out in the fields, where I was 
working at the time. He was really a 
breath of fresh air for radio, for a dif-
ferent type of talk and a different 
style. 
I know he inspired millions around 
the country during his many years on 
radio. With his loss, he won’t be re-
placed. He surely led the way for many 
others to take on that mantle, but no-
body 
will 
do 
it 
quite 
like 
Rush 
Limbaugh. He did so well at it, and he 
touched so many that he was even rec-
ognized about 1 year ago right here in 
this Chamber by President Trump with 
the Medal of Freedom, one of the high-
est honors anybody can receive. 
Mr. Limbaugh may be controversial 
to some, but he was always coming 
from truly a humble heart to try to get 
a message out to what America was 
about, his love for this country, and a 
love for its ideals. 
So I know that many will miss him, 
and I am glad to be honored to help 
touch on his legacy here tonight.

LIVING UP TO THE PRINCIPLES OF 
FREEDOM AND EQUITY 
(Ms. NEWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of the millions of 
Americans who continue to be denied 
housing, education, public services, and 
much, much more because they iden-
tify as members of the LGBTQ commu-
nity; Americans like my own daughter 
who, years ago, bravely came out to 
her parents as transgender. 
I knew from that day on, my daugh-
ter would be living in a nation where, 
in most of it States, she could be dis-
criminated against merely because of 
who she is. And yet, it was still the 
happiest day of my life, because my 
daughter has found her authentic self. 
And as any mother would, I swore 
that I would fight to ensure this coun-
try changes for the better. Without the 
Equality Act, this Nation will never 
live up to its principles of freedom and 
equality. The right time to pass this 
act was decades ago. The second best 
time is right now. 
I am voting yes on the Equality Act 
for Evie Newman, my daughter, and 
the strongest, bravest person I know.

HONORING THE LIFE OF LUKE 
LETLOW 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, coming from Illinois, 
it is often a question I get here in this 
Chamber, why do you have a pin of the 
State of Louisiana on your lapel? 
I have the pin on my lapel because 
there is a void, a void in this institu-
tion because one of our colleagues 
wasn’t able to get sworn in. Luke 
Letlow would have made a tremendous 
Member of this institution. And I want 
to thank my colleague, MIKE JOHNSON, 
and the entire Louisiana delegation, 
and what would have been his freshman 
class, for honoring him tonight in a 
Special Order. 
Like Luke, I was a district staffer for 
years, trying to make this House be a 
better place for every single American. 
I was looking forward to serving with 
him. Unfortunately, tragedy took his 
life, and we are without his service. 
My heart goes out to his wife, Julia, 
and their two kids, and the entire 
State of Louisiana, and this institu-
tion, for not having the opportunity to 
see the true leadership of Congressman 
Luke Letlow.

HONORING THE LIFE OF LUKE 
LETLOW 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BOURDEAUX). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHN-
SON) is recognized for 60 minutes as the 
designee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, our Special Order tonight is 
to honor a dear friend, one who would 
have been a colleague of ours here, and 
a great tragedy. 
Congressman-elect 
Luke 
Joshua 
Letlow, from Start, Louisiana, passed 
away 
from 
complications 
due 
to 
COVID–19 on December 29, 2020. He had 
just been elected to Congress December 
5, and he was only, as we know, weeks 
away from taking the oath of office 
and serving here with us. 
He was 41 years old. He was in the 
prime of his life and, so far as any of us 
could tell, otherwise the picture of 
health and energy and excitement and 
positivity. He was excited to serve with 
us here. His death came as a terrible 
shock to all the people of Louisiana 
and to millions of people around this 
country. 
Luke was known in Louisiana for 
having a servant’s heart. He had a 
peaceful nature about him. When he 
talked to a constituent, or a friend, or 
anyone, he made them feel they were 
the most important person in the 
world. He was one of those guys who 
was a great statesman, and he would 
have left a big mark here. 
I have also been encouraged since his 
passing to know that my friend was 
guided by his faith in Christ. A good 
friend of ours told me shortly after his 
passing that Luke was drawn even clos-
er to the Lord in his final days. In fact, 
he called this trusted prayer warrior to 
share briefly about an experience he 
had just a few nights before he passed 
away. 
He was in the hospital, and Luke said 
he felt the certain presence of God and 
his peace. Luke Letlow knew the truth 
of Christ and the peace of his salvation, 
and we all have taken great comfort in 
that. 
Luke leaves behind his devoted wife, 
Julia, and their two young children, 
Jeremiah and Jacqueline. He leaves his 
parents, Johnny and Dianne Letlow; 
his grandmother, Mary Taylor; his 
brothers, Paul and Matt, and their 
families; and a huge network of people 
who were like family to Luke and loved 
him as their own. 
He was raised in Start, Louisiana, 
just east of Monroe. For the people who 
don’t know the geography, it is north-
east Louisiana. Throughout his entire 
adult life, it was very clear how deeply 
he cared about the people of our State 
and those who live in the Fifth Con-
gressional District, which is a sprawl-
ing 24 parishes, the largest by land area 
in our State. 
He worked for Bobby Jindal during 
Jindal’s stint here in the U.S. House, 
and also later when Bobby was elected 
Louisiana’s Governor. 
Luke also worked as chief of staff for 
his predecessor and our good friend, Dr. 
Ralph Abraham, who just retired and 
left the seat open. 
Throughout Luke’s time in each of 
those positions, he made it a priority 
to work every day to benefit those that 
he served. He wanted to make life bet-
ter for the people of his home State 
and, in those efforts, he worked closely 
with our farmers and the oil and gas 
industry and countless small busi-
nesses to ensure they were given every 
opportunity to succeed. 
Judging from his accomplishments 
and a remarkable record of public serv-
ice, there is no doubt at all that he 
would have made an outstanding Mem-
ber of Congress. 
Many people are aware now that 
there will be a special election in 
March, March 20, to fill that seat that 
he has left open, and we are delighted 
to tell you that his beloved bride, his 
widow, Dr. Julia Barnhill Letlow, will 
be running for that seat, and we expect 
that she will be taking her place here 
shortly thereafter. 
She is a native of Monroe, a dedi-
cated mother, of course, and an edu-
cation professional who has dedicated 
her life to promote and advocate for 
higher education, traditional family 
values, and our quality of life in Lou-
isiana. We are excited to soon welcome 
her here to fill the giant void that our 
dear friend and brother, Luke, has left 
us. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS), 
another member of our delegation. 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, 
Congressman-elect 
Luke 
Letlow was called home far too soon. 
He was a friend and we were looking 
forward to working together here in 
the people’s House. 
His passing was so sudden and unex-
pected that it caused many of us—it 
certainly caused me to reflect upon my 
life and to be renewed in my deter-
mination to serve the people and to be-
come a better man every day, because 
that is the kind of spirit that Luke de-
livered to the world. 
He was a charming and brilliant man 
with a beautiful smile, a wonderful 
spirit, a compassionate man, driven to 
serve. 
I had the opportunity to break bread 
with Julia, Luke’s wife, last week, and 
I saw in speaking to her that Luke 
lives in the light in her eye, in her chil-
dren, and everyone that Luke touched 
during the course of his life. 
So I am prayerful that this child of 
God’s presence will be felt, that Rep-
resentative-elect Luke Letlow’s service 
will, indeed, be felt within this Cham-
ber, if we can just take a moment to 
seek that guidance that he clearly pur-
sued and listened to during the course 
of his life. He brought that to those 
that he worked with and the citizens 
that he served. So I thank my col-
leagues for arranging this Special 
Order tonight. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend from Lou-
isiana, Mr. HIGGINS, for his remarks. 
We sat together at the funeral of Luke, 
and it was a great service. There were 
so many kind words said about him. 
And he is remembered to just be the 
great spirit and the great Louisiana 
homegrown talent that he was. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE), 
who is also the freshman class presi-
dent, the class that Luke of course 
would have been a part of. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Louisiana for yielding. 
I rise today as the president of the 
117th Congress Republican freshman 
class to express our profound sadness 
that we all share for the loss of our 
friend and colleague, Luke Letlow. 
Luke was a great American who was 
committed to serving his country and 
the people of his home State of Lou-
isiana. Sadly, Luke was taken from us 
way too early. 
I never actually had the chance to 
meet Luke. He was elected on Decem-
ber 5, which was the last day of the sec-
ond week of New Member orientation.

But as the freshman class president, I 
felt it my duty to make sure that he 
felt included by texting him, con-
necting him with other Members, and 
making sure that he had all of his 
needs met as he joined this 117th fresh-
man class. 
Our entire class looked forward to 
being sworn in together on January 3, 
and we were devastated by the news of 
his passing on December 29 of 2020. We 
all know that Luke would have been a 
tremendous addition and someone who 
would have made a positive impact on 
this great Nation. 
I join with all of my colleagues in 
sending our thoughts and support to 
Luke’s 
family, 
including 
his 
wife, 
Julia, son, Jeremiah, daughter, Jac-
queline, and I am keeping them all in 
my prayers. 
It is interesting to see In God We 
Trust above the Speaker’s chair be-
cause one thing I do know is that Luke 
trusted God. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
her leadership of the freshman class 
and for those kind remarks. 
I yield to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. PFLUGER), another leader from 
that class. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of my friend, Luke Letlow. 
Luke and I spoke many times as we 
both prepared to enter Congress, and 
we shared the privilege of both rep-
resenting districts that are centered 
around a couple of very important 
things, faith, family and agriculture. I 
looked forward to serving with him and 
working together to better the lives of 
our farmers and our ranchers across 
the district and across the entire coun-
try. 
Luke led a life of public service to 
the good people in the great State of 
Louisiana from a young age, beginning 
as a young college graduate serving on 
the 
staff 
of 
Congressman 
John 
Cooksey, the Representative of Louisi-
ana’s Fifth District at that time. 
He went on to serve the people in 
multiple capacities before launching a 
successful Congressional bid of his own. 
He was a man of faith in Jesus 
Christ, and he lived his life in accord-
ance with His guiding principles. There 
is no way for us to know the thousands 
of lives that he had already touched be-
fore he entered into a plan to run for 
Congress, and how many lives he 
touched in those years of service, and 
the countless others who were blessed 
just by knowing him. 
There was nothing that he loved 
more than serving others and pri-
marily, his love of being a husband and 
a father, a husband to his wife, Julia, 
and a father to their two children, 
Jeremiah and Jacqueline, something 
that his legacy will live on forever in 
our hearts. 
Today, we give glory to God for his 
life and pause to reflect on that legacy 
which will live on through Julia, Jere-
miah, and Jacqueline. My prayers are 
with all of them. 
His passing is a tremendous loss to 
this U.S. Congress, to the State of Lou-
isiana and, more importantly, to his 
family and friends who loved him and 
cherished him. 
b 1945 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, we have a few others from the 
class that Luke Letlow would have 
been proud to serve in, some of the ris-
ing leaders here. I will call on them in 
no particular order here, but I yield to 
another gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
FALLON), if he is ready. 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I 
never had the privilege and blessing to 
meet Luke Letlow in person and to 
share our hearts and enjoy the blessed 
gift of fellowship. But to be honest, I 
still feel a bond and a connection and a 
friendship with Luke because we were 
both married to beautiful, successful 
women, and we certainly outkicked our 
coverage; we both had two children; 
and we both chose public service and 
eventually ran for Congress. 
Luke left this world far too early, 
only 41. The scourge of an evil virus 
whose growth across the globe was fos-
tered by the nefarious denial and neg-
ligence of a Communist regime in Bei-
jing. 
COVID–19 
has 
claimed 
millions, 
500,000 here at home, and it stole Luke 
from us. Luke Letlow, a man in his 
prime who had everything to live for, is 
now gone. And it shouldn’t be that 
way. 
He should be with us today. He 
should be with us here, voting, visiting, 
talking, learning, and leading. But 
COVID robbed our country and this 
Chamber of Luke Letlow. 
This same scourge, Madam Speaker, 
crossed my path 31⁄2 weeks ago, and it 
damn near killed me. I experienced the 
worst pain in my life. I had bacterial 
and viral pneumonia, along with the 
virus thriving in my body at the same 
time. I thought I was going to die. 
Prayers and terrific American medical 
care spared me. So I am not going to 
hold back, and I am just going to talk 
frankly and from the heart. 
I am consumed today, right now, this 
very moment, with why. Why is Luke 
gone? Why was I spared? Why are 
500,000 Americans dead? I don’t know. 
But I do have a strong belief that we 
all have a purpose, and everyone in this 
Chamber has a purpose the Almighty 
has for us, and we just don’t know what 
it is yet. 
I feel, now that I have been gifted 
bonus decades, I want to know what I 
should do with those years. How should 
I lead my life? The bottom line is, we 
all should ask ourselves that question 
and exercise the power that we have 
within each of our souls to be kinder, 
to be gentler, to be more under-
standing, to smile when somebody 
walks on an elevator. It costs us noth-
ing to do these things. We should live 
for others. And above all, we should 
love and never be ashamed to be vul-
nerable and love thy neighbor. 
We want to honor Luke Letlow? You 
want to honor his legacy and his life? 
Then live and love and be joyous and be 
kind. Live for others with all of your 
hearts. I am not the least bit ashamed 
to say that I am going to try. 
That is what we are here for, and 
that is our purpose. Let’s acknowledge 
the bounties and the blessings and the 
very gift of life itself because life is 
short, and it is delicate, and it is frag-
ile, and it is fleeting, and it is also so 
very beautiful. 
Luke, we are praying for you. We 
miss you; we love you; and we are 
going to be there for Julia and your 
kids. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Iowa (Mrs. HINSON), another class-
mate of Luke’s. 
Mrs. HINSON. Madam Speaker, to-
night, we are here to honor the life of 
Luke Letlow, who was taken from us 
far too soon. 
Luke led a life of public service, and 
he was dedicated to bettering the lives 
in Louisiana. I know he was so looking 
forward to serving the great people of 
the State of Louisiana here in Con-
gress. 
Most importantly, though, he was a 
dedicated husband to his wife, Julia, 
and a loving father to their two young 
children. We are all grieving with them 
during this time, their entire family. I 
hope the Letlow family can seek some 
comfort in knowing that so many peo-
ple here in D.C., back in Iowa, Georgia, 
and around the country are lifting up 
prayers for them every single day. 
Although Luke is no longer with us, 
he does leaves behind, and he reminds 
us about, a remarkable legacy that we 
and, most importantly, his two chil-
dren will always be able to remember 
him by long after we are all gone from 
this place, too. 
Thank you, Madam Speaker, for let-
ting me speak tonight on behalf of our 
classmate, Luke Letlow, and his entire 
family. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Florida, Mrs. KAT CAMMACK, an-
other bright light in this class and my 
friend. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of the life of Luke 
Letlow. 
As a Member-elect of this freshman 
class, Luke was one of us. We didn’t get 
the privilege of serving alongside him, 
but in getting to know his family, I 
have no doubt that he would have been 
an energetic leader among us. 
In talking with Luke’s wife, Julia, I 
have come to know the very best of 
what Luke stood for and why he will 
forever be with us as a Member of this 
body. 
Luke’s love of Louisiana ran as deep 
as the roots of generations that came 
before him. Luke revered leaders rang-
ing from Ronald Reagan, whose opti-
mistic vision of conservatism trans-
formed the Republican Party and the 
world, to the local Richland Parish po-
lice jurors who ensured residents re-
ceived the essential services that local

government was charged with pro-
viding. 
Luke loved studying Louisiana polit-
ical history and voraciously read every 
out-of-print book on the subject that 
he could get his hands on. Luke’s pas-
sion for preserving the history of Rich-
land Parish and his forebears took him 
from documenting gravesites and local 
churches to building a website that 
chronicled the history of the rural 
community where he was raised. 
Luke’s love of America, Louisiana, 
and Richland Parish defined him as a 
person and motivated him to pursue a 
career in the noble profession of public 
service. 
Tonight, we honor his memory. But 
moving forward, we will strive to em-
body his passion for people, our his-
tory, and our Nation. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I am delighted to introduce 
another member of the Louisiana dele-
gation for remarks in our Special Order 
tonight. We are going in, it seems to 
be, reverse order by seniority, but I 
yield to the gentleman from Louisiana 
(Mr. GRAVES), my friend. He knew 
Luke very well, and I know he will 
bring some good thoughts to us to-
night. 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman, Mr. 
JOHNSON, for yielding and for orga-
nizing this. 
Madam Speaker, I sat here and lis-
tened to all of these people talk about 
Luke Letlow, and I don’t know who 
they are talking about. 
Luke was a redneck. There is this 
iconic picture of Luke where he is 
wearing this hat, and it says: ‘‘Start 
Fire.’’ The only thing that comes to 
mind is this is parent material, right? 
Luke was a good ol’ boy, and I know, 
in many instances, that term is associ-
ated with negativity. That is not Luke. 
Luke was a force for good, and he did 
that before the Navy even coined that 
term. 
I have known him for 15, 20 years. We 
staffed together up here in Congress. 
We worked together in the Governor’s 
office in Louisiana. Luke was always a 
workhorse, always, not a show horse. 
Madam Speaker, Luke was a public 
servant. He wasn’t a politician. He had 
a heart for the public. He had a heart 
for fixing things, and he was good at it. 
Luke brought folks together, and he 
got things done. 
There wasn’t a prejudiced or dis-
criminatory bone in his body. Every-
body was a friend. Everybody Luke 
met, he looked you in the eye, he gave 
you that little grin, which was a little 
bit cockeyed, and he truly wanted to 
know you. 
He truly wanted to get to know peo-
ple, to find out what you were about. 
He loved finding out about the back-
ground or history of people, their an-
cestry, their relatives, where they were 
from, what they did, what they cared 
about. 
Madam Speaker, the people in the 
Fifth District of Louisiana saw that as 
well. There are 24 parishes that com-
prise the Fifth District, and Luke won 
23 of those, 23 of them in the election. 
This district, his predecessor used to 
brag, and Luke serving as the chief of 
staff to Congressman Ralph Abraham 
used to brag, has more acres of row 
crops than any other district in Con-
gress. This wasn’t an urban area. This 
wasn’t New York City or even New Or-
leans. This was a rural area. Madam 
Speaker, these were the people that 
Luke had a heart for. 
I have never in my life been as ex-
cited as I was to have a colleague like 
Luke. Years and years ago, I told him, 
I said: ‘‘Luke, look, if Doc, if Ralph 
Abraham, ever steps down, you have to 
run. You have to do it.’’ 
There are a lot of people up here that 
are good. Luke would have been great. 
Madam Speaker, you look at this 
place, you watch the network TV, the 
news, and you wonder why in the world 
anyone would want to come to do this. 
You have really got to question peo-
ple’s sanity, looking at how dysfunc-
tional, how partisan, how divisive this 
place is. 
One of the previous speakers hit it on 
the head when they said Luke is ex-
actly what we need. He is exactly what 
we need here. I will say it again: Luke 
is a workhorse, not a show horse. He 
brings people together. He doesn’t care 
about your race, your ethnicity. He 
doesn’t care about your political party. 
What he cares about is doing things 
right. 
Luke’s dream was to find a good life 
partner, and knowing him when he was 
a little younger, I think many of us 
thought that was a pretty lofty goal 
for Luke. But, man, he nailed it. He 
did. Julia, his partner, his life partner, 
his spouse, his wife, is just amazing, 
and Luke was just so excited, so giddy, 
about that relationship. 
Luke’s dream was to be a good son, 
and he is. He is a great son. He is a 
great brother. 
Before I leave you all with the wrong 
impression, I should have clarified that 
his dad actually started the volunteer 
fire department in Start, S-t-a-r-t, 
where he was from. I didn’t mean to 
suggest that he was a pyro. He was a 
good son. 
Luke’s dream was to be a Member of 
Congress, and he did that, too. He won 
the election. His dream was to be a 
good father to Jeremiah and the apple 
of his eye, Jacqueline. He loves them, 
absolutely loves them. 
And his dream was to be a good 
Christian. Look, all of us are sinners, 
but Luke was a difference-maker. 
He didn’t run for Congress for the 
name recognition, for the ego, or for 
the popularity. He did this, he ran, to 
represent 
the 
underrepresented, 
to 
stand up for these small communities, 
like Start, Louisiana, and the people of 
these small communities so they would 
have a voice, so they would be rep-
resented. 
I will never in my life forget when we 
were at the burial, following the hearse 
to the burial ceremony, seeing that 
hearse driving and the water tower of 
Start right there in the background, 
and this just ominous sky. All I could 
think about is Luke doing what was 
right and wanting to be here because 
he really cared. He did. It was so gen-
uine. 
Madam Speaker, people often talk 
about term limits, and term limits 
make a lot of sense. There are some 
people that should be term-limited 
after they have been in Congress for 
about 2 months, and there are some 
people that should be term-limited 
after 40 years. Luke was one of those 
people who should be here forever be-
cause you couldn’t change his genuine 
heart and care for the people and doing 
what is right. 
b 2000 
So, Madam Speaker, I want to thank, 
again, my friend from Louisiana for or-
ganizing this. It was absolutely well 
deserved. Filling the void Ralph Abra-
ham’s retirement created was a big 
void, but, certainly, Luke was abso-
lutely up for that task. He was going to 
do an amazing job. 
To Julia, to Jeremiah, to Jacqueline: 
Luke is looking down at us from heav-
en right now probably playing Xbox or 
PlayStation, and he is looking over 
this place. He is looking over this fam-
ily. What Louisiana lost was heaven’s 
gain. 
God bless you, brother. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend, GARRET 
GRAVES of Louisiana, for those poign-
ant words. The funeral service was like 
that, with recollections from close 
friends. We could have sat there all 
afternoon and reveled in it. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to 
yield to the gentleman from Louisiana 
(Mr. SCALISE), the whip, my dear 
friend, and one of the guys who helped 
guide Luke on his path to get here. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Louisiana for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy 
heart that I stand here today to pay 
tribute to Luke Letlow. Just like ear-
lier tonight when we stood out on the 
steps of the Capitol to pay respects to 
the 500,000 people who we have lost 
from COVID–19, Luke, unfortunately, 
is in that number. He is not somebody 
you would have expected. He was 
young, healthy, and he had his whole 
life in front of him. 
He had already lived a rich life. He 
had already left such a powerful impact 
on people in the right kind of way, like 
my colleague, Congressman GRAVES, 
talked about. He had a big heart, 
Madam Speaker. He had a servant’s 
heart. 
Luke was the kind of person who you 
want to get into public service to do it 
for the right reasons, to actually be-
lieve in something and want to make 
people’s lives better. 
When he would go through the rural 
communities of his district—which is a

to people, strike up conversations. He 
would want to hear their stories and he 
would want to help people. He had a lot 
of opportunities to do that, Madam 
Speaker. 
He started working for Congressman 
John Cooksey out of college at Lou-
isiana Tech. He had already garnished 
a desire for public service. 
After he worked for Congressman 
Cooksey, I met him in 2004, when he 
was working on the campaign of my 
predecessor, Bobby Jindal, who got 
elected to Congress. Luke served with 
him there. When Bobby got elected 
Governor, Luke went to serve with him 
in the State to make our State a better 
place. 
And then when Ralph Abraham came 
to Congress, Luke spent the last 6 
years working for Ralph as his chief of 
staff, going around the rural parts of 
that district in northeast Louisiana, 
just reaching out, finding out about 
people. 
He was very much into genealogy. He 
wanted to know not just about people, 
but about their history, where they 
came from, what made people tick, and 
how he could keep making a difference. 
Ultimately, 
when 
Ralph 
retired, 
Luke made that decision to run. And 
he didn’t make that decision alone. His 
lovely wife, Julia, was all in. They 
were a family that was a partnership. 
They were a true love story of two peo-
ple who cared deeply about each other 
and who cared deeply about their 
young children: young Jeremiah; and 
young Jacqueline, who we also grieve 
for. 
It is heartbreaking when you think 
of the promise and what was lost, what 
we as colleagues lost. You hear mem-
bers of his own freshman class who 
never got to serve with him—some 
have might not even met with him, 
just knew about him or heard about 
him—and miss him. That is the kind of 
person who Luke Letlow was. 
I got to talk to Luke a lot in those 
last few days and in the last few weeks 
before he even got COVID. He was so 
excited to come up here and get sworn 
in as a Member of Congress and to 
start helping people in a different way. 
He had already helped so many peo-
ple working for others, but now was his 
chance to make his own mark. He was 
talking about what committees he 
wanted to be on. He wanted to serve on 
the Agriculture Committee. He wanted 
to serve on the Appropriations Com-
mittee. And he had big ideas, ideas 
that inspire other people to want to do 
better as well. 
So, Madam Speaker, when we remem-
ber Luke Letlow, it is that big smile 
that Luke had. It is that servant’s 
heart, the heart of a person who cares 
about other people and wanted to make 
a difference for all of the right reasons. 
Thank God we still have people like 
Luke Letlow who care enough to want 
to get into public service for the right 
reasons. 
It is sad that we didn’t get that op-
portunity to serve with him. I so 
looked forward to serving with him as 
a colleague in the Louisiana delega-
tion. He was only 5 days away from 
getting sworn in when we lost him. 
So, Madam Speaker, as we remember 
the life of Luke Letlow, I know he is up 
in heaven looking down. He was a man 
of deep, deep faith, and that faith car-
ried him and his family through those 
difficulties in the last few days when 
he was struggling and fighting for his 
life. I know that faith is what got him 
into heaven. He would probably be 
looking 
down 
and 
saying: 
Y’all 
shouldn’t be making such a big fuss. 
But you know what? He deserves this 
kind of tribute because this would have 
been a richer body if we had Luke 
Letlow. 
We will all remember him and keep 
him in our thoughts and our prayers. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the whip for those 
great remarks and his great leadership, 
and I know Luke appreciated that as 
well. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Colorado 
(Mrs. 
BOEBERT). 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Louisiana 
for yielding and for setting up this Spe-
cial Order to honor Congressman-elect 
Luke Letlow. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the 
life and legacy of Congressman-elect 
Luke Letlow, whose tireless work for 
his community, passion for public serv-
ice, and love for his constituents will 
long be an inspiration to many Ameri-
cans. 
He spoke glowingly of the mighty 
Mississippi and his district’s rich Lou-
isiana soil, both of which flowed freely 
through his veins as he passionately 
advocated for the people who elected 
him to be their voice. 
His life of service working for Gov-
ernor Bobby Jindal, serving as chief of 
staff to Congressman Ralph Abraham, 
and then successfully running for Con-
gress himself, exemplified his commit-
ment to win the day. 
Congressman-elect Letlow shared my 
great love for our Western States, and 
he was a fierce advocate for the issues 
facing everyday Americans. His calling 
to public service was only surpassed by 
his calling to be a loving husband, fa-
ther, brother, and son. He cared deeply 
for his beloved wife, Julia; son, Jere-
miah; and daughter, Jacqueline. 
After he won his race, Congressman- 
elect Letlow’s wife, Julia, spoke of 
God’s sovereignty over the life of her 
husband, quoting the words from scrip-
ture: ‘‘Before I formed you in the 
womb, I knew you; before you were 
born, I set you apart.’’ 
God set Luke apart with a calling, 
with an anointing, and that same call-
ing and anointing is now in that Godly 
heritage that he has left behind. God’s 
wraparound presence is surrounding 
the Letlow family. 
God’s plan for Luke’s life was one of 
service, and his legacy will live on 
through his family. His wife, Julia, is a 
woman of deep faith. A calling to pub-
lic service is on her life. She was his 
rock for all of his years in public life. 
I am honored to call her my friend 
now. 
May his family find comfort in the 
words of the scripture: ‘‘The Lord is 
close to the brokenhearted. . . .’’ and 
in knowing that Congressman-elect 
Letlow fought the good fight, finished 
his race, and kept the faith. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Colorado for her words. That was 
very appropriate. I was going to cite 
the same scripture. 
I will just say this as we close to-
night: The night we got word of Luke’s 
passing was December 29, and that 
word, the phone call we got shook my 
whole family, as it did everybody in 
the State. 
As we were putting our children to 
bed at night, I reminded my youngest 
son, my 10-year-old son, that while 
grieving is part of our human experi-
ence, the Lord mourns with us. We 
know that from Isaiah 53:4. And as 
Lauren just said, He always remains 
close to the brokenhearted. Psalm 34. 
So many are mourning this loss and 
so many remain brokenhearted. But I 
will close with these words from the 
Apostle Paul, as he wrote to the church 
in Rome, Romans 8:38–39: ‘‘For I am 
convinced that neither death nor life, 
neither angels nor demons, neither the 
present or the future, nor any powers, 
neither height nor depth, nor anything 
else in all creation, will be able to sep-
arate us from the love of God that is in 
Christ Jesus our Lord.’’ 
Luke believed that and he lived it, 
and he would want us to remember it, 
too. 
Madam Speaker, this concludes our 
Special Order tonight, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.

DANGER OF GENDER IDENTITY 
POLITICS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Mrs. HARTZLER) is recognized 
for the remainder of the hour as the 
designee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend, the gentleman from 
Louisiana, for that very heartfelt time 
recognizing Mr. Letlow and his family. 
Our hearts are with them. 
I now move on to another topic that 
is also very, very important to all of us 
and to America, and it deals with a bill 
that will be on the floor this week. 
It is shamefully called the Equality 
Act, but it shreds the principles of pro-
tecting our children. In fact, under this

February 23, 2021 
bill, 
children, 
beginning 
with 
the 
womb, will be targeted and victimized. 
Under this bill, children in the class-
room will be bombarded with unscien-
tific, confusing materials questioning 
the reality of their biological sex. 
Under this bill, children struggling 
with gender dysphoria will be pushed 
toward medical treatments and even 
surgical procedures, which will disrupt 
their natural development and may 
leave them sterile and physically al-
tered for life. 
Under this bill, children’s privacy 
will be violated when locker rooms, 
restrooms, and homeless shelters will 
no longer be single sex. 
Under this bill, parents may face cus-
tody 
battles 
for 
making 
healthy, 
wholesome choices for their children’s 
health. 
This scenario was not hypothetical 
for the Ohio couple who lost custody of 
their daughter for not affirming hor-
monal treatments. 
Under this bill, foster care and adop-
tion agencies will be forced to shutter. 
And this is just the tip of the iceberg. 
The so-called Equality Act jeopard-
izes the well-being of our children. It 
jeopardizes the role of parents, the pri-
vacy and safety of vulnerable women, 
the competitive edge of female ath-
letes, the livelihood of charities and 
businesses, and the integrity of our 
healthcare system. 
We demand better for our children 
and their futures, and we will not be si-
lent. We are here tonight to expose the 
Equality Act for what it is, a far-reach-
ing policy that will upend all aspects of 
life, and turn basic decency and com-
mon sense into discrimination. 
I appreciate my colleagues who have 
joined me tonight to let America know 
why this bill must be defeated. 
Madam Speaker, first, I would like to 
yield to the gentleman from Maryland 
(Mr. HARRIS), my friend and colleague 
who is a practicing anesthesiologist. 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, this 
bill, the Equality Act, is nothing more 
than an identity politic sellout, a thin-
ly veiled attempt to attack and coerce 
individuals who hold serious and legiti-
mate concerns or objections to things 
like 
parental 
rights 
to 
make 
healthcare decisions for their children; 
the ability of women to compete on an 
equal athletic playing field; and even 
medical procedures like sterilization 
and abortion. 
I am a physician and I have been 
practicing medicine for over 35 years. 
This bill, if enacted, would mandate 
that healthcare practitioners and even 
facilities like Catholic hospitals would 
be forced to provide and participate in 
procedures like abortion, which ends a 
human life. 
We should all be able to agree that a 
Catholic hospital should never be com-
pelled by the government to offer pro-
cedures like abortion that they mor-
ally object to in the strongest possible 
terms. 
Furthermore, if society continues to 
support politically correct gender iden-
tity politics, the science is becoming 
clearer that gender dysphoria, espe-
cially in children, is a psychiatric con-
dition that in most cases will resolve 
itself with time. 
Instead, however, this bill would re-
quire parents to allow irreversible 
medical interventions for their chil-
dren, children who may even be pre-
pubescent, resulting in sterilization, 
and oftentimes later regret. 
b 2015 
Scientific data confirms that many 
who undergo gender transition con-
tinue to deal with serious depression, 
even after full transition. And the 
poorly named ‘‘Equality Act’’ would 
mandate that medical professionals ac-
cept and support the desire of their pa-
tients to undergo these invasive proce-
dures, even if they have professional or 
conscience objections. 
Madam Speaker, in response, I will 
be reintroducing the Conscience Pro-
tection Act this week. My bill will pro-
tect healthcare providers from being 
required to perform abortions or steri-
lizations and allow them to continue 
practicing medicine without duress or 
coercion from their employer or per-
haps even their patients. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to cosponsor my bill, and I op-
pose the so-called Equality Act on the 
floor this week. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Dr. HARRIS, and I appreciate his 
firsthand experience and thoughts on 
this very, very, serious matter. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. LAMBORN), 
cochair of the Values Action Team. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Missouri 
for her courage and backbone in sup-
porting these vital social issues. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak on the dangers of H.R. 5, the so- 
called Equality Act. This bill would 
have disastrous effects on our culture. 
H.R. 5 will not only turn the Civil 
Rights Act on its head, it would harass 
individuals and entities who are merely 
seeking to exercise their sincerely held 
religious beliefs. 
Under the current text, countless 
faith-based businesses and nonprofits 
across the country would simply cease 
to exist. I am not convinced that my 
colleagues across the aisle understand 
the far-reaching consequences of the 
so-called Equality Act. The reality is 
that churches could be forced to vio-
late their beliefs simply to stay open if 
it were enforced as written. 
This awful legislation also creates 
fundamental 
inequalities 
for 
many 
Americans. Parents sending their kids 
to public schools would live in fear 
that their young daughter would have 
to use the same locker room or rest-
room as a man because the Equality 
Act would open the door to biological 
males self-identifying as females. 
I have introduced an amendment to 
the Equality Act protecting accom-
modations choosing to designate pri-
vate, single-sex spaces, such as rest-
rooms or locker rooms. I hope the 
Democrat majority allows a vote on 
this commonsense amendment that 
tens of millions of American parents 
want. 
In addition, the so-called Equality 
Act would significantly disadvantage 
women participating in sex-specific 
sports leagues. That is why I have also 
introduced an amendment, originally 
filed as a bill last Congress by Demo-
cratic Representative TULSI GABBARD, 
protecting 
equal 
opportunities 
for 
women and girls in high school and col-
lege sports. This amendment of mine 
seeks to protect women and girls sim-
ply wanting to compete against other 
biological women and girls on a level 
playing field. 
Women and children suffer when 
Democrat policies are enacted. Wom-
en’s sports, and the girls and young 
women who just simply want to com-
pete with other females on an equal 
basis, will be the victims of Democrat 
policies. 
Madam Speaker, I adamantly oppose 
the radical Equality Act, and I hope 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
will take a stand and oppose it as well. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. LAMBORN, such 
great remarks, so much common sense 
there. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. GREEN), 
my friend, and an emergency room 
physician. 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the distinguished gen-
tlewoman from Missouri for her leader-
ship on this very important issue. 
Madam Speaker, as a physician, I 
know firsthand that this bill, H.R. 5, 
will force medical providers to sur-
render sound medical judgment and 
their sincerely held convictions to po-
litically fashionable dogmas. 
According to the radical activists 
who seek to enshrine gender identity in 
the Federal civil rights law, the only 
appropriate 
treatment 
for 
a 
child 
struggling from gender dysphoria is 
gender reassignment. That is it. Such 
procedures often lead to irreversible 
damage, especially in adolescents. But 
under the Equality Act, medical pro-
viders who object to performing these 
procedures will face crushing legal li-
ability if they refuse to comply. Every 
medical facility receiving any Federal 
money will be given an ultimatum: 
Comply or shut down. 
Madam Speaker, if H.R. 5 becomes 
law, a doctor who refuses to perform a 
mastectomy or a hysterectomy on an 
otherwise healthy teenage girl seeking 
gender reassignment surgery, will be 
held liable for violating the Federal 
law. 
H.R. 5 even goes so far as to exempt 
itself from longstanding, bipartisan 
Federal religious liberty protections— 
protections both Congress and the Su-
preme Court have consistently upheld. 
A Catholic hospital, following the com-
mands of Scripture to serve the frail 
and the poor will be forced to violate

their very faith to comply and perform 
abortions or face financial ruin. 
Madam Speaker, as a physician, I 
took a sacred oath to do no harm and 
to preserve the health of those in my 
care. If this bill becomes law, many 
doctors will be forced to go against 
both their conscience and their med-
ical judgment. 
Make no mistake, this is a death sen-
tence for medicine and for the sacred 
rights of conscience. Biology is not big-
otry, and medicine is not discrimina-
tion. 
All Americans who do not wish to see 
medicine sacrificed to the politically 
correct orthodoxy should stand up and 
oppose this bill. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Thank you, Dr. 
Green. That is excellent. ‘‘Biology is 
not bigotry.’’ It seems like common 
sense, but we are not talking about 
common sense with the Equality Act. 
And that is why we are here tonight, to 
let the American people know about 
the ramifications, the very serious, 
permanent ramifications of this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN), an-
other doctor, who I am proud to be 
joined by, who is a dentist from Texas. 
Please share your thoughts about 
this bill and what it is going to mean 
to Americans. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my distinguished colleague from Mis-
souri for this opportunity. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in ob-
jection to the so-called Equality Act. 
Once again, under the guise of equal-
ity, the left is prioritizing its radical 
agenda over religious freedom, the 
well-being of children, and the safety 
of women and girls. 
As the father of three daughters and 
the 
grandfather 
of 
nine 
grand-
daughters, I am outraged at the assault 
that this bill launches on women in 
sports. 
And 
furthermore, 
as 
a 
healthcare practitioner, I am infuri-
ated at its blatant attack on the con-
science rights and religious freedoms of 
those in the healthcare industry. 
This bill is not about preventing dis-
crimination in medical treatment, it is 
about forcing medical professionals to 
abandon their conscience rights and 
medical judgment to comply with the 
left’s extreme views on gender. 
The Equality Act would prohibit phy-
sicians from counseling children with 
gender dysphoria. Instead, they would 
be required to administer dangerous 
medical treatments, including puberty 
blockers, cross-sex hormones, and sur-
geries. 
This mandate contradicts science. In-
creasingly, we are finding that these 
treatments compound these children’s 
confusion rather than solving it. The 
catastrophic 
effects 
leave 
children 
physically and psychological scarred 
and often render them sterile. It is 
nothing short of child abuse. 
The left will not tolerate disagree-
ment with its view on gender. They 
provide no conscience protections and 
explicitly state that the Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act does not 
apply to this new definition of sex. 
Physicians refusing to perform these 
harmful treatments would be punished, 
even if they object because of religious 
or moral convictions. 
The Equality Act is another attempt 
by the left to promote its radical agen-
da and suppress everyone else who dis-
agrees. We must fight for the con-
science rights and religious freedoms of 
our medical professionals, and we must 
stop our children from being used as 
pawns in the game of political correct-
ness. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Well said, and I 
thank the gentleman so much. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Mrs. 
FISCHBACH), the first female president 
of the Minnesota Senate. She is a 
mother of two and grandmother of five. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman HARTZLER
for 
putting this together. I appreciate the 
opportunity in making sure the people 
in the country understand what is in 
this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to H.R. 5, the so-called Equality Act. 
The reality of this bill is anything but 
equal. It is nothing more than a thinly 
veiled attempt to force unreasonable 
mandates on our institutions and re-
strict the liberties of the American 
people. 
If this becomes law, Americans can 
expect government-imposed limits on 
the free exercise of religious liberty, 
businesses forced to cover the costs of 
abortions, and medical providers re-
quired to perform abortions, even if it 
conflicts with their deeply held beliefs. 
Unfortunately, this is just the tip of 
the iceberg. So today, I rise to speak 
on behalf of pro-life Americans in my 
district and across the country who 
fear this legislation will be manipu-
lated by the radical left to impose its 
will and create a right to abortion 
right up to the moment of birth. 
Madam Speaker, a majority of Amer-
icans support at least some restrictions 
on abortion, including making sure 
taxpayer funds are not used to fund 
abortions. Instead of respecting the 
rights of all Americans, this bill will 
impose a top-down abortion mandate 
that interferes with the State and Fed-
eral laws that protect the right to life 
and will force doctors, nurses, and 
other medical providers to participate 
in abortion procedures, even if it goes 
against their own sincerely held be-
liefs. 
The previous administration made 
great strides in protecting religious 
freedom and the liberties of all Ameri-
cans. Unfortunately, the new adminis-
tration does not seem to value those 
cherished beliefs. 
This bill will relegate the pro-life 
view to discrimination, redefine gen-
der, and require faith-based employers 
to pay for abortion in their insurance 
offerings. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose this legis-
lation on behalf of the unborn who do 
not have a voice. I oppose this legisla-
tion on behalf of my constituents, 
many of whom hold beliefs that are in 
conflict with this bill’s radical ide-
ology. And I oppose this bill on behalf 
of the millions of Americans who know 
that life is a God-given gift worth 
fighting for. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose this bill 
and ask Members to do the same. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Thank you, Rep-
resentative FISCHBACH. Life is precious, 
and it is jeopardized under this very 
poor bill, and so thank you for raising 
those points. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Colorado 
(Mrs. 
BOEBERT), a volunteer counselor to in-
carcerated women. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
time. 
The Equality Act. 
Madam Speaker, equality for who? 
Where is the equality in this legisla-
tion for the young girls across America 
who have to look behind their backs as 
they change in their school locker 
rooms just to make sure there isn’t a 
confused man trying to catch a peek? 
Where is the equality for women who 
have been sexually assaulted? 
Under this legislation, their crisis 
counselor may be ‘‘Alexis’’ who was ac-
tually born ‘‘Alex.’’ And they will have 
to talk to him about their assault. 
Where is the equality for parents who 
want and deserve the right to raise 
their children, free from government 
overreach? 
Under this proposal, Congress seeks 
to replace mom and dad with bureau-
crats. This isn’t hyperbole. In Ohio, a 
mom and dad had their child removed 
from their custody because they didn’t 
allow their daughter to undergo gender 
transition. Removed from their cus-
tody. 
And so here we are. The left will lay 
down the rights and security of mil-
lions of Americans, particularly young 
women, at the altar of gender ideology. 
Following the lead of liberal indoc-
trination camps, also called colleges 
and universities, my colleagues on the 
left are committed to advancing this 
radical ideology, the rights and sov-
ereignty of individual States be darned. 
So much for Federalism. 
The power-hungry left will not slow 
down until every school, every church, 
every workplace, every State, and 
every community adheres to the left’s 
definition of gender. 
You disagree? 
They will find you. They will im-
prison you. Or as we have seen, they 
will even take your children. And let’s 
make sure the American people know 
this is only the beginning. 
The Equality Act requires doctors to 
perform abortions, and they are going 
to use your tax dollars to pay for them. 
Once the left codifies their ideology, 
they will come for your speech. It is al-
ready happening in Canada, where you 
can 
be 
fined 
and 
imprisoned 
for 
misgendering someone.

b 2030 
Madam Speaker, they won’t stop 
there. Nothing will ever satisfy the left 
until there is complete and total com-
pliance. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Scripture 
says, 
when speaking of those who have 
turned their back on God, who have 
traded the truth for a lie: Professing to 
be wise, they became fools. 
I can think of no better description 
of the so-called Equality Act, or in-
equality act, than this. The utter fool-
ishness is astounding. Up is down. 
Wrong is right. Left is right. Boys are 
girls and vice versa. 
Madam Speaker, for the sake of our 
sons and daughters, for the sake of pa-
rental rights, privacy, decency, and so 
much more, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this horrendous legisla-
tion. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, 
so well said. Up is down, and right is 
wrong. 
Our last speaker is the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), a doc-
tor of education. 
I want to thank the other colleagues 
who are here. We are running out of 
time, but I want to thank Representa-
tive RICK ALLEN, who objects to this 
bill, for being here as well. 
Dr. Foxx, will you share, in closing, 
why we should oppose this bill this 
week? I yield to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, our 
First Amendment is a powerful instru-
ment that has protected our most sa-
cred freedoms for hundreds of years. 
Few other countries provide the same 
protections and freedoms that our 
First 
Amendment 
guarantees. 
Yet, 
today, these essential rights are under 
attack. 
H.R. 5 is the latest example of Demo-
crats’ misleading and partisan manner 
of legislating. As a former educator 
and the Republican leader of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee, I can tell 
you the bill may have ‘‘equality’’ in 
the title, but it certainly does not 
serve all Americans. 
The Equality Act would empower the 
government to interfere in how regular 
Americans think, speak, and act. Spe-
cifically, it would amend the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 to make sexual ori-
entation and gender identity protected 
classes. 
According to the National Review, 
this extreme legislation redefines sex 
to include gender identity, undermines 
religious freedom, gives males who 
identify as females the right to wom-
en’s spaces, and sets a dangerous polit-
ical precedent for the medicalization of 
gender-confused youth. 
Under H.R. 5, our Nation’s K–12 
schools would be forced to treat gender 
as being fluid, subjective, and not tied 
to biological reality. 
Government intervention often causes more 
harm than good. I’ve spent my time in Con-
gress working to protect individual freedoms 
from unnecessary bureaucratic burdens. I rec-
ognize that a strong family is vital to our na-
tion’s progress and prosperity, which is why 
I’ve worked to advance legislation that allows 
families to flourish and protects life at all 
stages. It is unconscionable that in America, 
where we fight for life, liberty, and the pursuit 
of happiness, we tolerate this systematic ex-
termination of on entire generation. The right 
to life demands that we protect our Nation’s 
most vulnerable, including the unborn. 
Our First Amendment is a powerful instru-
ment that has protected our most sacred free-
doms for hundreds of years. Few other coun-
tries provide the same protections and free-
doms that our First Amendment guarantees. 
We are the ‘land of the free’ because of it. Our 
individual liberties are the envy of people 
around the world and they are the cornerstone 
of the world’s oldest democracy. 
Yet today, these essential rights are under 
attack. 
H.R. 5 is the latest example of Democrats’ 
misleading and partisan manner of legislating. 
As a former educator and the Republican 
Leader of the Education and Labor Com-
mittee, I can tell you that the bill may have 
‘‘equality’’ in the title, but it certainly does not 
serve ALL Americans. 
This legislation has a clever name and an 
allegedly noble purpose, but it is a vehicle for 
serious, harmful consequences. 
The Equality Act would empower the gov-
ernment to interfere in how regular Americans 
think, speak, and act. Specifically, it would 
amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to make 
sexual orientation and gender identity pro-
tected classes. According to the National Re-
view, this extreme legislation ‘‘redefines sex to 
include gender identity, undermines religious 
freedom, gives males who identify as females 
the right to women’s spaces, and sets a dan-
gerous 
political 
precedent 
for 
the 
medicalization of gender-confused youth.’’ 
Under H.R. 5, our nation’s K–12 schools 
would be forced to treat gender as being fluid, 
subjective, and not tied to biological reality. 
The bill would undermine Title IX protections 
for girls by outlawing sex-based athletic com-
petitions. 
Even more troubling is the bill’s meticulous 
and intentional destruction of religious freedom 
protections. 
Religiously affiliated colleges and univer-
sities that maintain student codes of conduct, 
hiring practices, or housing rules reflecting sin-
cerely held beliefs about marriage and sexu-
ality risk losing federal funding under the 
Equality Act, as such policies would be 
deemed discriminatory. 
Beloved secular private colleges that main-
tain single sex admissions policies, like Smith 
College and Morehouse College, could be 
forced to change their policies or forego fed-
eral funding. 
In Virginia, we’ve already seen the dis-
pleasure amongst parents regarding such pol-
icy implementation. In an opinion piece pub-
lished by the Washington Post in 2019, a 
former middle and high school teacher whose 
children attend Arlington Public Schools said, 
‘‘It would erode parents’ rights over their chil-
dren’s education, corrode Title IX protections 
for girls and risk convincing healthy, normally 
developing boys and girls that their bodies are 
wrong and must be altered with hormones and 
be vandalized by surgical instruments.’’ 
The bill also lacks any pro-life protections, 
which is why I am submitting my amendment 
that will protect religiously affiliated groups and 
individuals from participating in or funding 
abortions. 
This bill is a brazen attempt to replace long-
standing constitutional rights with the identity 
politics of the moment. 
We’ve entered treacherous waters by con-
sidering legislation that stifles proven, bipar-
tisan solutions and, more seriously, our Bill of 
Rights. It’s outrageous that Democrats would 
advertise these proposals as guaranteeing 
fundamental civil and legal rights. 
Madam Speaker, as elected Representa-
tives, we all strive for equality before the law, 
but H.R. 5 is another classic example of 
Democrats passing a bill now and figuring out 
what it means later. 
This is no way to legislate. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, the Equal-
ity Act’s supporters claim it will protect stu-
dents from discrimination, but in reality it 
makes schools more dangerous and unfair for 
everyone. 
By expanding the definition of ‘‘sex’’ to in-
clude self-declared gender identity, it requires 
schools to allow biological males into girls’ 
restrooms, locker rooms, showers, and sport 
events usually reserved for women. 
And by incorporating sexual orientation and 
gender identity into Title IV of the Civil Rights 
Act, which appropriately mandates the deseg-
regation of public education, this bill could 
order the incorporation of radical gender ide-
ology in sex education or other aspects of cur-
riculum, far outside the original law’s scope. 
Activists are already pushing graphic, age-in-
appropriate content on these topics on stu-
dents in places like Arlington, Virginia. 
This bill puts teachers and administrators at 
risk too. Those who ‘‘misgender’’ a student or 
fail to use the individual’s preferred pronouns 
could be accused of harassment and subject 
to discipline or even lose their jobs. 
Girls would also face unfair competition in 
sports. The Equality Act would force schools 
to allow biological males to compete on fe-
male-only teams. 
We have already seen consequences of 
this. One transgender MMA fighter has broken 
the skulls of two female opponents (and 
counting), and transgender runners and bas-
ketball players are dominating female competi-
tors, leaving many females’ long ambitioned 
goals of trophies and scholarships dashed. 
For years, supporters of Title IX have fought 
to encourage and empower girls through ath-
letic competition. Democrats would like to 
erase those gains, shattering countless girls’ 
dreams and dignity, to appease the woke 
mob. 
Americans of faith would suffer too. Reli-
giously affiliated colleges and universities that 
maintain student codes of conduct, hiring 
practices, or housing rules reflecting their 
faith’s sincerely held belies about marriage 
and sexuality would lose federal funding under 
the Equality Act, as such policies would be 
deemed discriminatory and open them to 
countless lawsuits to threaten their very exist-
ence. 
All-female universities, whether religious or 
secular, would be required to accept male stu-
dents identifying as female students, and male 
students identifying as males, since this bill 
provides no exemptions for female-only institu-
tions. Is that a policy Americans want? 
The misnamed Equality Act erases opportu-
nities for girls and women and harms all stu-
dents and teachers. It must be opposed.

OUR POWER, OUR MESSAGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include any ex-
traneous materials on the subject of 
my Special Order hour. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Ohio? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, it is 
with great honor that I rise today to 
open our first Congressional Black 
Caucus Special Order hour of this year, 
during Black History Month, utilizing 
to the fullest extent possible: Our 
Power, Our Message. 
I would like to thank the Congres-
sional Black Caucus members for hav-
ing the confidence to elect me to be 
chairwoman during the 117th Congress. 
I stand on the shoulders of greatness as 
I acknowledge the past members and 
chairs for their tremendous leadership. 
For the next 60 minutes, we have an 
opportunity to speak directly to the 
American people about the issues of 
great importance to the Congressional 
Black Caucus and the millions of con-
stituents we represent. 
Tonight’s Special Order hour topic 
will serve as part of a rollout of our 
policy agenda and celebrate our 50th 
anniversary in the context of the many 
critical issues facing the Black com-
munity. 
The 
Congressional 
Black 
Caucus 
kicked 
off 
Black 
History 
Month, 
Madam Speaker, with the powerful 
Travon Free film ‘‘Two Distant Strang-
ers,’’ a moving story about a young 
Black man caught in a George Floyd 
type of nightmare with his local police 
department. 
During tomorrow’s CBC meeting to 
be held at 12 p.m., the ‘‘Living Black 
History’’ vignette, featuring all 58 
members of the CBC, will be unveiled 
to the public via Facebook, TheGrio, 
and my YouTube page. 
We are also hosting a virtual film 
screening of director Lee Daniels’ film, 
‘‘The United State vs. Billie Holiday,’’ 
tomorrow evening. 
In that spirit, later this week, I will 
be introducing the Black History is 
American History Act to close out our 
Black History Month. 
This year marks the 50th anniversary 
of the CBC with the largest CBC group 
ever, 58 members who represent the di-
versity, hope, and promise of this great 
Nation. It has been stated before, and 
it certainly bears repeating, the CBC is 
commonly referred to as the con-
science of the Congress and over the 
decades has forcefully advocated on 
policies that our Nation cares about, 
ranging from economic justice and rep-
arations, healthcare, voting rights, 
consumer protection, education, and 
fair policing to far beyond. 
The 
killing 
of 
Breonna 
Taylor, 
Ahmaud Arbery, and George Floyd 
drew America closer to another water-
shed moment last year, amid a pan-
demic that has disrupted life as we 
knew it, triggering an intergenera-
tional cross-class collective of people 
demanding change, which led to the 
passage of the George Floyd Justice in 
Policing Act, a bill that is the first- 
ever bold, comprehensive approach to 
hold police accountable, change the 
culture of law enforcement, empower 
our communities, and build trust be-
tween law enforcement and our com-
munities by addressing systemic rac-
ism and biases to help save lives. 
I also wear another hat, and that is 
as chairwoman of the Diversity and In-
clusion Subcommittee of the House Fi-
nancial Services Committee. Though it 
may speak for itself, I appreciate that 
kind of transformative change which 
we seek in the spirit of policy, legisla-
tion, and regulation that will, hope-
fully, result in building a record that 
we can use as we promote diversity and 
inclusion in our democracy. As CBC 
founder member Bill Clay noted, we 
have no permanent friends or enemies, 
just permanent interests. 
The CBC’s priorities will allow us, in 
many instances, to work with the 
Biden administration to deliver relief 
to our constituents who have been so 
devastated by the COVID–19 pandemic 
and to work on long-term plans for re-
covery. To that end, we are so pleased 
that we will announce our domestic 
policy team tomorrow, as we have met 
with Ambassador Susan Rice, who is 
head of the Biden domestic policy 
team. 
It is so important that I end by say-
ing the Congressional Black Caucus is 
committed to dramatically reversing 
these alarming trends by working with 
our community leaders, allies, and col-
leagues in Congress to pass critical leg-
islation and by working with the 
Biden-Harris administration to encour-
age responsible executive branch poli-
cies and actions using Our Power, Our 
Message. 
Now, I am honored to announce our 
CBC anchors for tonight: Congress-
woman SHEILA JACKSON LEE, a scholar, 
a strategist, an orator, a woman who 
has sponsored legislation and helped 
craft much of the changes that we will 
be talking about through the 117th 
Congress; and I am equally as proud to 
say that the Special Order hour will be 
co-chaired by her coanchor, Congress-
man RITCHIE TORRES, a freshman, a 
member of the Financial Services Com-
mittee, a giant in public housing legis-
lation. Tonight, you will hear from 
them. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
OUR POWER, OUR MESSAGE 
DURING BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) is recognized 
for the remainder of the hour as the 
designee of the majority leader. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me thank our illustrious leader of 
the Congressional Black Caucus, whose 
visionary leadership is going to carry 
us into the 117th Congress. 
Congresswoman JOYCE BEATTY acts 
legislatively on her history. She is 
from Ohio, one of the major stops of 
the Underground Railroad. In fact, Cin-
cinnati, Ohio, has one of the most mon-
umental monuments, if you will, to 
that freedom train, that courage, of 
Harriet Tubman. I might say that our 
chairwoman’s actions are in resem-
blance to Harriet Tubman. We are 
grateful for her vision. 
We will tomorrow, at the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, unveil the talent 
of tens upon tens of members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus and lay 
out our legacy, Our Power, Our Mes-
sage. I thank the gentlewoman for her 
leadership. 
It is as well my honor to be able to 
co-chair this with, if I might with a de-
gree of familiarity, a brother from the 
Bronx. I am delighted that a working 
man’s and woman’s representative has 
come to be able to shine, a man who is 
a product of public housing, public 
schools, and public hospitals, and who 
had a dream of lifting up his commu-
nity and building back a better Bronx. 
I am delighted that at 25, against all 
odds, he became the youngest elected 
official in New York City and the first 
openly LGBTQ elected official from the 
Bronx. He doesn’t know that his rep-
utation preceded him as a dynamic get- 
her-done person. 
I will repeat his motto before I begin 
my remarks, and that is RITCHIE 
TORRES’ remarks and life motto is as 
follows: ‘‘My motto is life is simple. If 
you do nothing, nothing will change.’’ 
Wow, what a piercing message for all 
of us, Republicans and Democrats, to 
do something good. 
His motto is: ‘‘If you do nothing, 
nothing will change. We can build a 
better Bronx, and we will do it to-
gether.’’ 
I am delighted to coanchor with Mr. 
RITCHIE TORRES for the 117th Congress. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
any extraneous material on the subject 
of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I am particularly delighted to begin 
my remarks, as I continue to weave in 
and out tonight, and then, with my re-
marks, will yield to Mr. TORRES as 
well.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H574 
February 23, 2021 
This is a moment in history. To-
night, we will explore honoring our 50- 
year legacy, Our Power, Our Message. 
As I was flying up today, I was very 
happy to find on the movie list on an 
airplane ‘‘Good Trouble,’’ the movie 
about John Lewis, with so many Mem-
bers telling their story. I think I will 
just simply say: Good trouble. 
Tonight, we hope to exemplify good 
trouble as we honor the 50-year legacy 
of the Congressional Black Caucus and 
emphasize Our Power, Our Message. We 
want to be in good trouble. 
I am honored in the 117th Congress to 
chair the Crime, Terrorism, and Home-
land Security Subcommittee and serve 
as a senior member on the Judiciary 
Committee, where, in addition to the 
powers of Congressional Black Caucus, 
we will seek to have justice rain down 
like righteous waters. 
b 2045 
We will do that, however, with the 55 
members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus, and I think our numbers are 
higher than that, and they are all on 
different committees. Amazing. They 
will pierce the seams of equality and 
justice in the 117th Congress. So we 
will have our past, but we will have our 
future. 
Let me briefly talk about where we 
were 400 years ago. Ships sailed from 
the west coast of Africa and in the 
process began one of mankind’s most 
inhumane practices, human bondage 
and slavery. Approximately 4 million 
Africans and their descendents were 
enslaved in the United States and colo-
nies, that became the United States, 
from 1619 to 1865. 
The institution of slavery was con-
stitutionally 
and 
statutorily 
sanc-
tioned by the Government of the 
United States from 1789 to 1865, and 
certainly American slavery is our 
original sin. But tonight you will hear 
woven throughout the remarks of so 
many of my colleagues, how out of 
these ashes of enslaved Africans, out of 
the toll of death from those held in 
bondage, out of the heroes that fought 
in the Civil War, who rose up out of the 
south and the north and came and bled 
for this Nation, out of that death toll 
of American fighters who happen to be 
present and former slaves and suffered 
indignities, and continue until the end 
of the 1800s and into Jim Crow-ism, you 
will find the overcomers. 
You will find those who have climbed 
and clawed their way to leadership. Of 
course, there will be those who say 
there is no need for an apology, which 
is part of H.R. 40, no need for a com-
mission to pierce into these ongoing 
disparities because you have overcome. 
In fact, this caucus was founded by 
overcomers, an array of talented men 
and women who themselves are the 
cornerstone of democracy and legit-
imacy. 
Who would ever forget the Honorable 
Shirley Chisholm, the first woman to 
run for the Presidency, an African- 
American woman, Black woman, and a 
woman to run for the Presidency, never 
to be daunted, never to be rejected, 
never to be denied? 
Or William L. Clay, Sr., who chaired 
the Education and Labor Committee, 
the first Black man, or the second, to 
do so. 
George W. Collins, a pioneer and pow-
erhouse out of Chicago, Illinois. 
John Conyers, the dean of the United 
States Congress, and the first Member 
of Congress to hire Rosa Parks, and a 
Member of Congress—I think it is his 
distinction alone—to have Dr. Martin 
Luther King endorse him. 
Ron Dellums, he was a man that was 
told: You sit in the chair with Pat 
Schroeder, in the Armed Services Com-
mittee. We are not interested in you 
being here in the first place. And Ron 
Dellums rose to be chair of the Armed 
Services Committee. 
And how much of an overcomer they 
are: Charles Diggs, the leading man on 
Africa. 
Augustus Hawkins, the leading man 
on the empowerment of working fami-
lies. 
Again, Ralph Metcalfe, one of the 
early pioneers of elected Black Mem-
bers of Congress, again, out of Chicago. 
Parren Mitchell, the father of affirm-
ative action. 
Robert C. Nix, a pioneer out of Penn-
sylvania. 
Charles B. Rangel, who worked his 
way up from the streets of Harlem to 
the U.S. Attorney’s Office to then be 
chair of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. 
Lou Stokes, a major force on the Ap-
propriations Committee and healthcare 
in America. 
And, of course, delegate Walter E. 
Fauntroy, who I met in South Carolina 
with a commitment to defeat a seg-
regationist who chaired the District of 
Columbia Committee. 
Overcomers, but each of them will 
say that this definition of who we are 
should not be on the few, it should be 
on the many. That means that, we, as 
members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus, stand here today to be able to 
call as our mandate, our challenge, our 
power, our message, is to be able to lift 
the opportunities of all African Ameri-
cans and Black people, and people of 
color, as we work to ensure that any-
one who is denied equality has us, we, 
the collective body politics, as their 
champion. That is what tonight is 
about. 
You will hear a number of descrip-
tions of many persons, and you will 
hear the words of many of us from dif-
ferent parts of the country. 
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to kick-off 
this series of CBC Special Order Hours for the 
117th Congress with my colleague Congress-
man RITCHIE TORRES (NY–15) who will serve 
as co-Anchor. 
Tonight, we will explore Honoring our 50 
Year legacy Our Power, Our Message. 
As chair of the Judiciary Committee’s sub-
committee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland 
Security and a senior member of the House 
Committee on Homeland Security, and a 
member of the House Budget Committee, I 
clearly understand the importance of history 
and why we should take time to appreciate the 
path that has led us to this moment. 
Four hundred years ago, ships set sail from 
the west coast of Africa and, in the process, 
began one of mankind’s most inhumane prac-
tices: human bondage and slavery. 
For two centuries, human beings—full of 
hopes and fears, dreams and concerns, ambi-
tion, and anguish—were transported onto 
ships like chattel, and the lives of many were 
forever changed. 
The reverberations from this horrific series 
of acts—a transatlantic slave trade that 
touched the shores of a colony that came to 
be known as America, and later a democratic 
republic known as the United States of Amer-
ica—are unknown and worthy of exploration. 
Approximately 4,000,000 Africans and their 
descendants were enslaved in the United 
States and colonies that became the United 
States from 1619 to 1865. 
The institution of slavery was constitutionally 
and statutorily sanctioned by the Government 
of the United States from 1789 through 1865. 
American Slavery is our country’s Original 
Sin and its existence at the birth of our nation 
is a permanent scar on our country’s founding 
documents, and on the venerated authors of 
those documents, and it is a legacy that con-
tinued well into the last century. 
The framework for our country and the doc-
ument to which we all take an oath describes 
African Americans as three-fifths a person. 
The infamous Dred Scott decision of the 
United States Supreme Court, issued just a 
few decades later, described slaves as private 
property, unworthy of citizenship. 
And, a civil war that produced the largest 
death toll of American fighters in any conflict 
in our history could not prevent the indignities 
of Jim Crow, the fire hose at lunch counters, 
and the systemic and institutional discrimina-
tion that would follow for a century after the 
end of the Civil War. 
The mythology built around the Civil War 
has obscured our discussions of the impact of 
chattel slavery and made it difficult to have a 
national dialogue on how to fully account for 
its place in American history and public policy. 
While it is nearly impossible to determine 
how the lives touched by slavery could have 
flourished in the absence of bondage, we 
have certain datum that permits us to examine 
how a subset of Americans—African Ameri-
cans—have been affected by the callousness 
of involuntary servitude. 
We know that in almost every segment of 
society—education, 
healthcare, 
jobs, 
and 
wealth—the inequities that persist in America 
are more acutely and disproportionately felt in 
Black America. 
This historic discrimination continues: Afri-
can-Americans continue to suffer debilitating 
economic, educational, and health hardships 
including but not limited to having nearly 
1,000,000 black people incarcerated; an un-
employment rate more than twice the current 
white unemployment rate; and an average of 
less than 1/16 of the wealth of white families, 
a disparity which has worsened, not improved 
over time. 
These conditions gave rise to a strong be-
lieve by Congressman Charlie Diggs that 
black members of Congress needed a way to 
make a difference by working together.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H575 
February 23, 2021 
The idea for an organization of black elect-
ed Members of Congress came from Rep-
resentative Charles Diggs (D-Mich.) who cre-
ated the Democracy Select Committee (DSC) 
in an effort to bring black members of Con-
gress together. 
Diggs noticed that he and other African 
American members of Congress often felt iso-
lated because there were very few of them in 
Congress, and he wanted to create a forum 
where they could discuss common political 
challenges and interests. 
Diggs believed that ‘‘The sooner we get or-
ganized for group action, the more effective 
we can become.’’ 
The DSC was an informal group that held ir-
regular meetings and had no independent staff 
or budget, but that changed a few years later. 
As a result of court-ordered redistricting, 
one of several victories of the Civil Rights Act 
and Voting Rights Act joined by the force of 
the Civil Rights Movement, the number of Afri-
can-American Members of Congress rose 
from nine to 13, the largest number since the 
end of the Civil War brought reconstruction 
that paved the way for voting rights for former 
slaves. 
The Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) 
was established in 1971 by the following 13 
founding members: 
1. Rep. Shirley A. Chisholm (D-N.Y.); 
2. Rep. William L. Clay, Sr. (D-Mo.); 
3. Rep. George W. Collins (D-Ill.); 
4. Rep. John Conyers, Jr. (D-Mich.); 
5. Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Calif.); 
6. Rep. Charles C. Diggs, Jr. (D-Mich.);

At the end of reconstruction, many of these 
Black members of Congress lost their office 
and many others who sought elected office or 
attempted to vote in public elections lost their 
lives. 
It would take nearly another hundred years 
until a sufficient number of Federally elected 
black candidates would return to Congress. 
But as too many African Americans know, in 
some ways, the civil war has never truly 
ended. 
On January 6, 2021, we saw the raw, sav-
age face of the lingering confederacy attempt 
to put a dagger into the heart of our democ-
racy. 
On that day, every belief expressed by this 
preamble to the Constitution of the United 
States was at risk of being lost to the hands 
of a wellcoordinated attack hidden within the 
ranks of a riotous, murderous mob that in-
vaded and laid siege to U.S. Capitol during 
the constitutionally required but ministerial act 
of counting the ballots submitted by the presi-
dential electors of each state and declaring 
publicly the persons who were by their ballots 
elected President and Vice-President of the 
United States. 
We all knew the outcome of the 2020 Presi-
dential Election long before January 6, 2021 
because of the transparency of each state’s 
election administration and that the Joint 
Meeting of Congress would simply confirm 
that Joe Biden had won more than a majority 
of the electoral votes, along with winning the 
national popular vote by more than 7 million 
votes. 
The riot came immediately after then-Presi-
dent Trump promoted a march on the Capitol 
and called his supporters to ‘stop the steal,’ 
‘never give up, never concede,’ and to ‘fight 
like hell’ during a speech that day, asserting 
that they would not ‘have a country anymore’ 
if they did not act. 
During the breach, Members of Congress 
were voting to certify then-President-elect Joe 
Biden’s election victory, and many participants 
in the attack intended to thwart this effort. 
Violent participants, incited by the former 
President’s rhetoric, injured scores of D.C. Po-
lice and U.S. Capitol Police officers—killing 
one, while four civilians also died. 
The level of violence and passions dem-
onstrated are out of character for a nation that 
is accustomed to the peaceful transfer of 
power, especially when the results were so 
clear—the President had been soundly de-
feated for reelection. 
We did not appreciate how powerful a lie 
could be in the domain of social media where 
people can wall themselves off from alter-
native views and news. 
A nation accustomed to the peaceful trans-
fer of power from one presidency to another 
was unprepared for the enemy within; from a 
Chief Executive who would attempt to strike at 
the heart of lawful authority to destroy the 
union so that he could remain in office. 
The underlying currents that led to the siege 
of the Capitol on January 6, 2021 began with 
the Compromise of 1876, which ended Recon-
struction. 
We must have an account of the crimes 
committed and the exacting of justice to those 
whose violent acts of rebellion against the au-
thority of the United States resulted in the 
deaths of six Americans and the desecration 
and defilement of the Citadel of Democracy. 
The injury done to the nation by white su-
premacists on January 6, 2021, can be linked 
to the harm they have done to this nation for 
well over 100 years beginning with the end of 
Reconstruction. 
The withdrawal of Union troops from the de-
feated and seditious southern states in 1877 
effectively put an end to Reconstruction and 
ushered in the era deconstruction of any ef-
forts to normalize equal rights under law to 
former slaves. 
This period of American history is obscured 
by time and characterized by a willful igno-
rance by governments, media, and academia, 
of the scale of murder mania that gripped the 
South during the period before Jim Crow de 
jure segregation, when the lines were being 
drawn in the blood of black people that out-
lined what black people would and would 
never be allowed to do in American society. 
Before they were written into law, the ‘Black 
Codes’ were shaped by a series of violent 
acts that occurred in communities large and 
small throughout the South, leading to tens of 
thousands of murders and 
attacks 
that 
maimed many because of arbitrary rules of so-
cial conduct such as a black man did not tip 
his hat, get off the sidewalk, spoke to a white 
person without first being spoken to, or other 
perceived slights. 
The reign of terror visited upon former 
slaves and their communities began near the 
end of Reconstruction and resulted in a secret 
history of the United States that almost erased 
the gains made by former slaves during the 
period 1865–1876 that included over 1,500 
elected offices held throughout the South. 
There were former slaves elected to serve 
in the 41st and 42nd Congresses of the 
United States, most of whom were denied re-
election to office once Jim Crow laws limited 
access to voting for former slaves. 
It was unnatural for black communities to 
have gone silent in the body politic after the 
strides made by newly freed slaves in engag-
ing in political discourse but that silence was 
caused by the tens of thousands of singular 
and mass murders and lynchings that oc-
curred after the end of Reconstruction and 
continued well into the 20th Century. 
The 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre that killed 
hundreds of blacks is another example of what 
a mob stirred by racial amanous can do to Af-
rican Americans who only crime was living a 
prosperous and economically independent 
American Dream. 
African American history has a long, painful 
and bloody path that clearly exhibits how vio-
lent the Confederacy was, and we have fought 
a cold civil war for over 156 years, which 
today is on the verge of turning hot. 
Evidence of the desperation of black people 
to escape the drudgery of the south is evident 
by the greatest self migration of people within 
the United States known as the Great Migra-
tion, which saw the relocation of more than 6 
million African Americans from the rural South 
to the cities of the North, Midwest and West 
from about 1916 to 1970. 
The push to leave family and communities 
in the south was motivated by a deep desire 
to escape the yoke of the cold civil war; and 
the pull to go to other parts of the nation was 
a chance to live free of fear, which translated 
into black people who were allowed to pursue 
the American Dream. 
This is why for millions of Americans it was 
shameful, painful and a disgrace that the Con-
federate battle flag was paraded in the Capitol 
of the United States by Trump’s motley band 
of disloyalists, something that hundreds of

thousands of true patriots gave the last full 
measure of devotion to prevent in the crucible 
years of the civil war from 1861 to 1865. 
The lynchings, beatings, rapes, burnings, 
joined with roadblocks to advancements that 
would afford African American people basic 
human rights such as fair wages, food, shel-
ter, 
education, 
economic 
opportunity, 
healthcare, due process and equal treatment 
under the law, were denied for much of our 
history. 
The goals of this cold civil war were simple: 
it was to end or frustrate any effort by society 
to create a world where black people are free 
and have full rights as citizens of the United 
States. 
The threat of a hot civil war comes from the 
majority of Americans accepting that African 
Americans have a place in America, and a 
right to pursue the American Dream. 
The shift in American values and views re-
garding race have come very slowly with ad-
vances and setbacks until the passage of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 created space and time to rees-
tablish voting rights for black voters that con-
tinues to be under threat. 
In this latter respect, the Insurrection of Jan-
uary 6 sought to duplicate the Compromise of 
1876 because in both cases adherents of 
white supremacy sought to retain and monop-
olize political power by disenfranchising and 
disempowering millions of black Americans, 
throughout the South in 1876 and in the urban 
centers of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin 
and Georgia in 2020. 
The threat of a hot civil war stems from the 
fear of white supremacists that a growing ma-
jority of Americans accept that African Ameri-
cans have an equal right and entitlement to 
the blessings of liberty because they are full 
members of the American political community. 
January 6, 2021, was not the first time that 
white supremacists attacked to overthrow duly 
elected white and black public officials. In 
1898, in Wilmington, North Carolina and again 
in Colfax, Louisiana in 1873, the election of di-
verse slates of statewide candidates to public 
office triggered violent white mobs to attack 
and murder newly elected officials. 
The Colfax Massacre, sometimes referred to 
euphemistically as the Colfax Riot, occurred 
on Easter Sunday, April 13, 1873, in Colfax, 
Louisiana, the seat of Grant Parish, where be-
tween 62 and 153 black men were murdered 
by racist white vigilantes calling themselves a 
militia. 
Three white men also died in the confronta-
tion, with at least one said to have been shot 
by his own ally. 
In the wake of the contested 1872 election 
for governor of Louisiana and local offices, a 
group of white Democrats armed with rifles 
and a small cannon, overpowered Republican 
freedmen and black state militia occupying the 
Grant Parish courthouse in Colfax. 
Most of the freedmen were murdered after 
they surrendered; nearly 50 were killed later 
that night after being held prisoners for several 
hours. 
Estimates of the number of dead have var-
ied, ranging from 62 to 153. The exact number 
of black victims was difficult to determine be-
cause many bodies were thrown into the Red 
River or mass gravesites. 
Reconstruction ended in 1877 and by 1898 
the protection afforded newly freed slaves to 
participate as equal citizens in casting ballots 
in public elections that allowed for the election 
of black and white candidates ceased to exist. 
White supremacists who ran as candidates 
in 1898, but lost their elections used mob vio-
lence to take the offices from the duly elected 
officials, sparking the Wilmington insurrection, 
also known as the Wilmington Massacre of 
1898 or the Wilmington Coup of 1898. 
The similarities between what happened on 
January 6, and the events of 1898 are striking 
in that both featured a mass riot and insurrec-
tion carried out by white supremacists. 
The mass riot carried out by white suprema-
cists on January 6, 2021, sought to overturn 
an election where black voters played a sig-
nificant role in electing Joseph Biden and 
KAMALA HARRIS as President and Vice Presi-
dent of the United States. 
Furthermore, to add injury to their racist 
sensibilities, the preceding day, January 5, 
2021, the state of Georgia elected its first Afri-
can American and Jewish U.S. Senators dur-
ing a special election. 
Today, we see the potential for the 1898 
level of violence against the entire Congress, 
which has become the most diverse delibera-
tive body in our nation’s history. 
Since the attack, the FBI has identified more 
than 400 individuals out of an estimated 800 
who illegally entered the Capitol on January 6, 
2021. As of January 27, 2021, the FBI’s 
Washington Field Office has confirmed that 
more than 150 criminal cases against those 
individuals have been filed. 
Although some reporting initially contra-
dicted Justice Department officials’ public 
statements regarding aggressive efforts to 
charge all those involved in the criminal activ-
ity, acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin re-
affirmed the Department’s commitment on 
January 26, 2021, stating ‘‘[r]egardless of the 
level of criminal conduct, we’re not selectively 
targeting or just trying to charge the most sig-
nificant crime . . . [i]f a crime was committed 
we are charging you, whether you were out-
side or inside the Capitol.’’ 
The long and blood history of white suprem-
acy requires an approach that holds individ-
uals accountable for their actions as a means 
of ending the lure of the mob as a tool of vio-
lence against targets of interest. 
Reports that cite that over a hundred current 
or former members of the military were in-
volved in the riot at the Capitol are shocking 
to some. 
Unfortunately, this aspect of white suprema-
cist violence was evident by violence com-
mitted by Proud Boys and Boogaloo adherents 
made clear their objectives. 
My efforts to focus the attention of the mili-
tary on this link was evident in an amendment 
I offered to the NDAA for FY2021 that was 
adopted. 
This Jackson Lee Amendment included in 
the House version of the NOAA directed the 
Secretary of Defense to report to Congress 
the extent, if any, of the threat to national se-
curity posed by domestic terrorist groups and 
organizations motivated by a belief system of 
white supremacy, such as the Boogaloo and 
Proud Boys extremists is reflected in the Con-
ference bill. 
The NDAA conference identified that the 
FBI is under statutory obligation, established 
by Section 5602 of the NDAA FY 2020 (Public 
Law 116–92), to complete a report that would 
better characterize the domestic terrorist threat 
by requiring the FBI and the Department of 
Homeland Security in consultation with the 
National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), to 
produce a set of comprehensive reports over 
5 years. 
The report is to include: a strategic intel-
ligence threat internal to the United States; 
metrics on the number and type of incidents, 
coupled with resulting investigations, arrests, 
prosecutions and analytic products, copies of 
the execution of domestic terrorism investiga-
tions; detailed explanations of how the FBI, 
DHS and NCTC prioritize the domestic ter-
rorism threats and incident; and descriptions 
regarding the type and regularity of training 
provided by the FBI, DHS, or NCTC to other 
Federal, State and local law enforcement. 
The conferees noted that the report has not 
been delivered to the appropriate committees, 
and they urged the FBI Director to deliver the 
report without delay. 
The Jackson Lee Amendment to the NDAA 
FY 2021 sought the same information that is 
required under the NDAA FY 2020 because of 
the threat posed by accelerationists and militia 
extremists who comprise a range of violent 
anti-government actors, movements and orga-
nizations, some of which branch out of dec-
ades-old ideologies and others of which are 
relatively new has led to violent engagement 
of law enforcement. 
My concern is that in the aftermath of a his-
toric national election, the activity of violence 
influencers like Boogaloo Boys or Proud Boys 
will increase and lead to attacks becoming 
more frequent. 
In 2018, we saw too many instances of vio-
lent extremists searching for opportunities to 
sow violence and disrupt democratic proc-
esses. 
Boogaloo and Proud Boys are targeting 
constitutionally protected activity for cooption 
or to provide cover for attacks. 
HONORING OUR 50-YEAR LEGACY: OUR POWER, OUR 
MESSAGE 
LIST OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS IN THE 117TH CONGRESS: 
The work of the 117th Congress is just 
begun, but the list of unfinished business is 
long: 
Ending the COVID–19 by Ending Healthcare 
Disparities; 
Passage of the George Floyd Justice in Po-
licing Act; 
Criminal Justice Reform; 
Funding to complete the restoration of a 
safe drinking water system for Flint, Michigan; 
Enactment of the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Act; 
Immigration Reform. 
The United States is a work in progress, as 
stated in the preamble to the Constitution: 
We the People of the United States, in 
Order to form a more perfect Union, estab-
lish Justice, ensure domestic Tranquility, 
provide for the common defense, promote the 
general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of 
Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do 
ordain and establish this Constitution for 
the United States. 
African Americans have fought in every war 
this nation has faced knowing that they were 
not afforded the same rights and freedoms of 
white Americans. 
We comprise thirteen percent of the popu-
lation of the United States, and yet experience 
a higher rate of incarceration, health dispari-
ties, more vulnerable to economic slowdowns, 
and even more likely to get COVID–19 and 
have much worse health outcomes.

February 23, 2021 
Disparities tell the story of living while black 
in America. 
Disparities in maternity mortality, in the care 
we receive from doctors when we are in pain 
caused by Sickle Cell anemia, or present with 
serious symptoms like Ebola as was the case 
with Thomas Eric Duncan who went to a Dal-
las Area hospital for treatment. 
Disparities in the spread of COVID–19 are 
killing Black people at a much higher rate than 
our percentage of the population in states re-
porting demographic data. 
Since that time, we have seen a pandemic 
sweep the country, taking more than 500,000 
souls in its wake and devastating the African 
American community. 
According to the latest estimates from the 
U.S. Centers for Disease Control, Black peo-
ple get COVID–19 at a rate nearly one and a 
half times higher than that of white people, are 
hospitalized at a rate nearly four times higher, 
and are three times as likely to die from the 
disease. 
Interestingly, a recent peer-reviewed study 
from Harvard Medical School suggests that 
reparations for African Americans could have 
cut COVID–19 transmission and infection 
rates both among Blacks and the population at 
large. 
Their analysis, based on Louisiana data, de-
termined that if reparations payments had 
been made before the COVID–19 pandemic, 
narrowing the wealth gap, COVID–19 trans-
mission rates in the state’s overall population 
could have been reduced by anywhere from 
31 percent to 68 percent. 
I include in the RECORD an article detailing 
the results of a Harvard Study that found that 
reparations for slavery could have reduced 
COVID–19 infections and deaths in US from 
between 31–68 percent. 
There are disparities in every aspect of Afri-
can American life and death. 
Between 1980 and 2015, the number of 
people incarcerated in America increased from 
roughly 500,000 to over 2.2 million. 
Today, the United States makes up about 5 
percent of the world’s population and has 21 
percent of the world’s prisoners. 
1 in every 37 adults in the United States, or 
2.7 percent of the adult population, is under 
some form of correctional supervision. 
In 2014, African Americans constituted 2.3 
million, or 34 percent of the total 6.8 million 
correctional population. 
African Americans are incarcerated at more 
than 5 times the rate of whites. 
The imprisonment rate for African American 
women is twice that of white women. 
Nationwide, African American children rep-
resent 32 percent of children who are ar-
rested, 
42 percent of children who are detained, 
and 52 percent of children whose cases are 
judicially waived to criminal court. 
Though African Americans and Hispanics 
make up approximately 32 percent of the US 
population, they comprised 56 percent of all 
incarcerated people in 2015. 
In African Americans and Hispanics were in-
carcerated at the same rates as whites, prison 
and jail populations would decline by almost 
40 percent. 
We will have special orders throughout this 
Congress that can delve more deeply in the 
aspect of live in America through discussions 
on H.R. 40. 
In 1989, Congressman John Conyers intro-
duced ‘‘The Commission to Study Reparation 
Proposals for African Americans Act, which 
later became known as H.R. 40, in remem-
brance of the Gen. Sherman’s 1865 Special 
Field Order No. 15 to redistribute 400,000 
acres of formerly Confederate owned coastal 
land in South Carolina and Florida, subdivided 
into 40 acre plots. 
In 2019, I reintroduced an updated H.R. 40 
entitled ‘‘Commission to Study and Develop 
Reparation Proposals for African Americans 
Act,’’ noting that in the 30 years since the bill’s 
original introduction, sufficient evidence has 
been assembled to not just study but also de-
velop proposals for a remedy. 
H.R. 40 allows for the first constructive 
scholarly conversation on race that is clearly 
needed in the U.S. today and the ability to 
take a moment in 250 years for a full discus-
sion or analysis of economic, political, psycho-
logical, scientific, and sociological effects of 
slavery in the U.S. It acknowledges the funda-
mental injustice and inhumanity of slavery in 
the U.S. and establishes a commission to 
study and consider a national apology and 
proposal for reparations for the institution of 
slavery, its subsequent racial and economic 
discrimination against African Americans, and 
the impact of these forces on living African 
Americans. The Commission is also charged 
to make recommendations to Congress on ap-
propriate remedies. 
H.R. 40 follows the successful model of the 
reparations campaign for Japanese-Americans 
interned during WWII. The campaign began 
with a 1980 congressional bill establishing a 
commission to investigate the internment, 
evaluate and consider the amount and form 
reparations would take, and make rec-
ommendations to the Congress for remedy. 
Based on the Commission’s findings, Presi-
dent Reagan signed into law the Civil Liberties 
Act of 1988. The bill formally apologized to 
Japanese-Americans, authorized the payment 
of $20,000 to each Japanese-American deten-
tion camp survivor; instituted a trust fund to 
educate Americans about the suffering of the 
Japanese-Americans; and issued pardons to 
all those who resisted detention camp intern-
ment. 
The nation over the last twelve months has 
faced a crucible of suffering, death, and dis-
ease that has taken too many lives, dev-
astated the economy, and put millions at risk 
of greater hardship due to the death of a loved 
one, unemployment, loss of health care or for-
gone education opportunities. 
Hidden in these numbers are the health dis-
parities that have plagued African Americans 
for generations. 
Today, with a heavy heart our nation sadly 
marks the loss of 500,000 American lives to 
the coronavirus: an unimaginable human toll in 
our modern era of medical and technological 
advances. These deaths are of staggering 
proportions and cause incomprehensible sad-
ness, but we cannot think of them as the end 
of COVID–19. As we have learned COVID–19 
can surge again claiming even more lives. 
This is why we cannot be complacent or ac-
cepting of so much death without continuing to 
fight. 
Every life lost is a profound tragedy and 
earth-shattering moment in the lives of fami-
lies, neighborhoods, and communities that 
touch each of us in countless ways as we 
mourn and console our family members, co-
workers, neighbors and friends. 
Today, I joined my colleagues of the House 
to observe a moment a silence on the steps 
of the Capitol for the 500,000 lives lost. Mem-
bers of Congress joined Americans in prayer 
for the lives lost or devastated by this vicious 
virus. As we pray, we must commit ourselves, 
in memory of those we have lost, to wearing 
face coverings, observing social distance, 
washing of hands-and most importantly getting 
the vaccine when it is our time to do so as a 
pledge to all who have been taken from us far 
too soon that we will act swiftly to put an end 
to this pandemic and to stem the suffering felt 
by so many. 
My commitment is to save lives and also 
livelihoods through public and personal action. 
As Texans work to overcome the tragic winter 
disaster that befell the state last week, I wrote 
to President Biden asking that he grant the 
state’s request for a Presidential Disaster Dec-
laration, which he did and today FEMA is on 
the ground providing water delivery, food dis-
tribution, and other vital services to help Tex-
ans get back on their feet. 
I also encourage those who have lost health 
insurance during the economic crisis created 
by COVID–19 pandemic to take advantage of 
the extended enrollment period for getting 
health 
insurance 
through 
healthcare.gov, 
which is open until May 15, 2021. Currently, 
36 states are using HealthCare.gov. Since 
President Biden announced the creation of the 
Special Enrollment Period for HealthCare.gov, 
all 14 states and D.C. that have their own 
state-based marketplaces have announced 
that they would also have Special Enrollment 
Periods. 
Questions about how justice is served to dif-
ferent communities in our nation came into 
stark focus with the horrifying killing of George 
Floyd on May 25, 2020 by a Minneapolis po-
lice officer, which shocked and awakened the 
moral consciousness of the nation. 
Untold millions have seen the terrifying last 
8 minutes and 46 seconds of life drained from 
a black man, George Floyd, taking his last 
breaths face down in the street with his neck 
under the knee of a police officer who, along 
with his three cohorts, was indifferent to his 
cries for help and pleas that he ‘‘can’t 
breathe.’’ 
In direct response, civil protests against po-
lice brutality occurred in cities large and small 
all across the nation. 
It is clear that the times that we find our-
selves in demand action, and that is precisely 
what my colleagues in the Congressional 
Black Caucus, on the House Judiciary Com-
mittee, and Congressional Democrats did by 
introducing H.R. 7120, the Justice in Policing 
Act of 2020 in the 116th Congress. 
The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act 
will be reintroduced this Congress to complete 
the work this nation has already begun in 
bringing justice to the criminal justice system. 
And every day, we use our power and our 
message to lift up these important issues that 
are facing our nation, and we ask those who 
are listening and watching to make these ef-
forts your own. 
Criminal Justice Reform is a pressing issue 
that Congress must address. 
As Judge Learned Hand observed, ‘‘If we 
are to keep our democracy, there must be one 
commandment: thou shalt not ration justice.’’ 
Reforming the criminal justice system so 
that it is fairer and delivers equal justice to all 
persons is one of the great moral imperatives 
of our time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H578 
February 23, 2021 
For reform to be truly meaningful, we must 
look at every stage at which our citizens inter-
act with the system—from policing in our com-
munities and the first encounter with law en-
forcement, to the charging and manner of at-
taining a conviction, from the sentence im-
posed to reentry and collateral consequences. 
House Democrats, led by House Judiciary 
Committee Chair JERROLD NADLER and myself, 
as Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on 
Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and In-
vestigations, have accepted and embraced the 
challenge of reforming the criminal justice sys-
tem and developed many innovative legislative 
remedies to correct many of the most glaring 
inequities and racial disparities in the most 
critical areas of the system. 
This is an important topic and one that Con-
gress must turn its attention to with urgency 
and unity of effort to: 
address the harms caused; 
get an accounting of what happened; 
understand how the water was poisoned; 
make the lives of people damaged by this 
tragedy whole; 
find justice for those lives that may have 
been lost; and 
determine and provide for the long-term 
health needs of those impacted. 
Today, the water in Flint, Michigan is not 
safe to drink and we have no concrete answer 
on when it may be safe to drink in the future. 
Flint, Michigan like so many communities 
across the nation really felt the brunt of the fi-
nancial crisis created by the abuse of new 
home lending practices and deceptive invest-
ment schemes that hid the weaknesses in the 
economy until the great recession spread 
across the nation beginning in late 2008. 
The financial damage done to communities 
like Flint in the form of steep declines in prop-
erty values, which caused significant declines 
in property tax income. 
This was not just Flint’s problem, but a na-
tional reality—for financially strapped cities, 
towns, school boards, and municipal govern-
ments who rely on Congress to fund all 12 
Congressional appropriations bills to provide 
them with much needed revenue to meet the 
needs of their citizens. 
In the 51 years since its passage on August 
6, 1965, the Voting Rights Act has safe-
guarded the right of Americans to vote and 
stood as an obstacle to many of the more 
egregious attempts by certain states and local 
jurisdictions to game the system by passing 
discriminatory changes to their election laws 
or administrative policies. 
In signing the Voting Rights Act on August 
6, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson said: 
‘‘The vote is the most powerful instrument 
ever devised by man for breaking down injus-
tice and destroying the terrible walls which 
imprison men because they are different 
from other men.’’ 
But on June 25, 2013, the Supreme Court 
decided Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 
193 (2013), which invalidated Section 4(b) of 
the VRA, and paralyzed the application of the 
VRA’s Section 5 preclearance requirements, 
which protect minority voting rights where 
voter discrimination has historically been the 
worst. Since 1982, Section 5 has stopped 
more than 1,000 discriminatory voting changes 
in their tracks, including 107 discriminatory 
changes in Texas. 
Although much progress has been made 
with regard to Civil Rights, there is still much 
work to be done in order to prevent systemic 
voter suppression and discrimination within 
our communities, and we must remain ever 
vigilant and oppose schemes that will abridge 
or dilute the precious right to vote. 
H.R. 885, ‘VOTING RIGHTS AMEND-
MENTS ACT OF 2015,’ of which I am an origi-
nal co-sponsor, repairs the damage done to 
the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court 
decision and is capable of winning majorities 
in the House and Senate and the signature of 
the President. 
This legislation replaces the old ‘static’ cov-
erage formula with a new dynamic coverage 
formula, or ‘rolling trigger,’ which effectively 
gives the legislation nationwide reach because 
any state and any jurisdiction in any state po-
tentially is subject to being covered if the req-
uisite number of violations are found to have 
been committed. 
For millions of Americans, the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 is sacred treasure, earned by the 
sweat and toil and tears and blood of ordinary 
Americans who showed the world it was pos-
sible to accomplish extraordinary things. 
I want to thank my colleagues, Chairwoman 
BEATTY of the CBC, and my co-Anchor, Rep-
resentative TORRES, for participating in this 
Special Order on these important topics.

Liberties Law Review, June 10, 2020] 
WHY WE CAN’T WAIT 
(By Mo Light) 
In May 1920, Henry Scott, a middle-aged 
Negro, was working as a Pullman porter in 
Florida when a mob seized and lynched him 
because a white woman said he insulted 
her.[1] Scott said that she had asked for his 
help arranging her seat on a train while he 
was busy arranging another woman’s seat. 
He asked her to wait. The white woman 
called the police and told them that Scott 
had insulted her. From there the story fol-
lowed the usual lynching pattern: A deputy 
sheriff arrested Scott and then a white mob 
‘‘overpowered’’ the deputy sheriff and took 
Scott from police custody. The mob then rid-
dled Scott with ‘‘forty or fifty bullets.’’[2] 
The jury returned the typical verdict: not 
guilty.[3] 
Recently, another middle-aged Black man 
was working when he was seized and lynched. 
George Floyd was lynched by police officers 
after a store employee accused him of buying 
cigarettes with counterfeit money. He pro-
tested to the store employee that this was 
not true. But the teenage employee refused 
to believe him and proceeded to call the po-
lice. From there the story followed the all- 
too-common policing pattern: Police officers 
who swore an oath to serve and protect 
lynched a Black man while their colleagues 
stood by in silence. 
Two stories, one hundred years apart. In 
this time, America has shot forward scientif-
ically and technologically. America put a 
man on the moon, found vaccines and cures 
for deadly diseases, invented the computer, 
and revolutionized technology. But through-
out this time, America has left Black Ameri-
cans behind in the shadows. For Black Amer-
icans, too little has changed in the last sixty 
or so years. They are still dreaming that one 
day they will be judged by the content of 
their character and not the color of their 
skin, all while living through a constant 
nightmare. Henry Scott is George Floyd and 
George Floyd is Henry Scott. And that is 
why we can’t wait. 
Black Americans have been and will con-
tinue to be severely disappointed with the 
slow pace of change. Before the Civil War, 
Richard Allen, Robert Purvis, Frederick 
Douglass, and many other Negro abolition-
ists and leaders were told to wait. After 
Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation 
Proclamation in 1863, slaves still toiled the 
fields through at least 1865.[4] 
The government promised the Negro ‘‘forty 
acres and a mule’’ but instead gave the 
Negro ‘‘separate but equal.’’[5] The Negro 
knew that in 1954 the Supreme Court called 
for the desegregation of schools ‘‘with all de-
liberate speed’’ but was met with all delib-
erate delay.[7] The Voting Rights Act of 1965 
has all but failed to live up to its poten-
tial.[7] In 2020, police officers are still 
disproportionality killing Black people.[8] If 
we respond to this oppression with the same 
methods we have used in the past, we will 
sing the same chants, march through the 
same streets, and demand the same justice in 
20, 40, 60 years. For over 100 years we have 
heard ‘‘change will come.’’ Words that con-
sistently ring hallow. The People must do 
everything they can to prevent another inno-
cent person from dying at the hands of the 
police or white supremacists. 
The idea that the People must engage rad-
ical methods of change, change that accepts 
all action except violence as legitimate, has 
generated a great deal of apprehension to 
many Americans. But lest we forget our his-
tory, one should be reminded that America’s 
birth and continued existence is a never-end-
ing dance with radicalness and extremism. 
Ideas that were once shunned as too radical 
are now lauded as examples for others. Was 
not Patrick Henry an extremist: ‘‘Give me 
liberty or give me death.’’[9] Was not the 
Declaration of Independence radical when it 
stated that it is ‘‘the Right of the People to 
alter or abolish’’ the government if it be-
came destructive to equality.[10] Our Found-
ing Fathers listed in the Declaration the 
King of England’s crimes that spurred and 
legitimatized the American Revolution—in-
cluding the Crown’s ‘‘protect[ion] of [his sol-
diers], by a mock Trial, from punishment for 
any Murders which they should commit on 
the Inhabitants of these States.’’[11] Was it 
not Thomas Jefferson who wrote to William 
Smith and said, ‘‘what country can preserve 
its liberties, if its rulers are not warned from 
time to time that their people preserve the 
spirit of resistance?’’[12] Was not Abraham 
Lincoln called radical when he said, ‘‘I be-
lieve this government cannot endure, perma-
nently half slave and half free.’’[13] And was 
not Dr. King considered one of the most rad-
ical and most hated men in America?[14] His-
tory has been kind to these men and so, too, 
will history be kind to us. 
Black Americans and their allies can’t 
wait for perfect adherence from their move-
ment on how one should engage in radical 
change. ‘‘No revolution is executed like a 
ballet[,]’’ said Dr. King, ‘‘[i]ts steps and ges-
tures are not neatly designed and precisely 
performed.’’[15] There will be violent ele-
ments in every revolution, but the majority 
of those revolting are doing so nonviolently. 
And more importantly, the oppressor is re-
sponsible for the violence of the oppressed. 
The oppressor is responsible for the Amer-
ican Revolution and the Civil Rights Move-
ment. The Revolutions of 1848 were formed 
by ad hoc groups of the middle-class, work-
ers, and commoners. They did not act with 
perfect discipline, but we nonetheless cele-
brate those radicals’ tenacity and vision.[16] 
The necessity of Black Americans and 
their allies forming a movement for radical 
change is difficult for many to swallow. It is 
difficult because too many Americans do not 
understand the centrality of radical change 
to American history. They sit in the shade of 
trees they did not plant, warm themselves by 
fires they did not light, and drink from wells 
they did not dig.[17] They profit from per-
sons they do not know, and they build upon

foundations that they did not lay.[18] But 
Black Americans know this difficult truth: 
radical change is the only acceptable change. 
They are keenly aware that their struggle 
for equality and justice is a never-ending 
battle. Black Americans are resentful be-
cause after all these years they must con-
stantly push for change or be pushed back 
into the shadows. Black Americans are the 
seeds that go unwatered and still rise. The 
soil not toiled but still fertile. You can’t ask 
us to be patient with change anymore or to 
play by your rules because Black Americans 
have been patient from John Castor to Henry 
Scott to George Floyd to —— .

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to yield to the distin-
guished gentleman from New York (Mr. 
TORRES). 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, it is an honor to rise to cele-
brate the 50th anniversary of an insti-
tution like no other, the Congressional 
Black Caucus. 
I am honored to be in the presence of 
fierce and formidable public servants 
like the CBC chair, JOYCE BEATTY, and 
today’s anchor, Congresswoman SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE. 
Madam Speaker, I thank her for 
those inspiring words. I thank her for 
reminding us of the long and rich his-
tory of the CBC, a history that con-
tinues to inspire us all. 
Madam Speaker, I am also honored 
to be here in the presence of my broth-
er, MONDAIRE JONES. You know, in the 
history of the United States Congress 
there have only been about 163 Black 
Members of Congress, and none of them 
were openly LGBTQ until the election 
of MONDAIRE JONES and myself. So I am 
proud to join my brother in making 
history in the 117th Congress. 
You know, before I was Congressman 
RITCHIE TORRES, before I was Council-
man RITCHIE TORRES, I am and will al-
ways be the son of the most powerful 
woman I know, Debra Bosolet, my 
mother. And the most important lesson 
that my mother taught me is never for-
get where you come from. Never forget 
where your roots lie. And my roots are 
in the Bronx. Even when I leave the 
Bronx for Washington, D.C., the Bronx 
never leaves me. 
I was born, bred, and battle-tested in 
the boogie down Bronx. And I have the 
high honor of representing New York’s 
15, the south Bronx, which for too long 
has been ground zero for racially con-
centrated poverty. The unemployment 
rate in the south Bronx could be as 
high as 25 percent, comparable to the 
joblessness of the Great Depression. 
More than half the residents in the 
Bronx pay more than half their income 
toward their rent, and that is before 
you factor in the cost of prescription 
drugs and utilities, and food, and all 
the bare necessities of life. And even 
though the south Bronx has long been 
known to be the poorest congressional 
district in America, COVID–19 has 
shown the south Bronx to be the essen-
tial congressional district. 
It is the home of essential workers 
who put their lives at risk during the 
peak of the pandemic so that most of 
us could safely shelter in place. And 
our mission, as the CBC, should be to 
give those essential workers, who are 
overwhelmingly women of color, a 
fighting chance at a decent and dig-
nified life. 
You know, I never thought as a poor 
kid of color from the Bronx that I 
would embark on a journey that would 
take me from public housing in the 
Bronx to the people’s House in Wash-
ington, D.C. And I never thought that 
as a Congress Member I would live 
through an insurrection against the 
U.S. Capitol. 
Now, on January 6, we were reminded 
that there are two competing realities 
that define America. There is the re-
ality of multiracial democracy. Amer-
ica is slowly emerging as a multiracial, 
multiethnic, LGBTQ-inclusive democ-
racy. Seventy percent of the Demo-
cratic Caucus consists of people of 
color, women, and members of the 
LGBTQ Caucus. 
But then there is the reality of white 
supremacy, which reared its ugly head 
on January 6. And, for me, the scene on 
the U.S. Capitol was not simply an at-
tack on a physical structure, it was an 
attack on the very idea of America as 
a multiracial democracy. And it is that 
vision of America that, we, as the CBC, 
are charged with defending. 
And despite the overwhelming shock 
and despair that I felt on January 6, 
Madam Speaker, I have hope. The inau-
guration was reason for hope. The 
image of KAMALA
HARRIS, a Black 
woman in the Vice-Presidency, being 
sworn in by Sonia Sotomayor of the 
United States Supreme Court, is a pow-
erful encapsulation of how far we have 
come, of how much we have achieved. 
And that moment reminds us that the 
future of our country does not belong 
to white supremacy. The future of our 
country belongs to multiracial democ-
racy. 
And the Congressional Black Caucus 
will continue to be at the forefront of 
making America the more perfect mul-
tiracial union that it ought to be. In 
the words of the CBC chair: Our Power, 
Our Message. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me thank the gentleman very much 
for his powerful words and his very 
prominent focus on the idea that you 
are from the Bronx, but the spirit of 
the Bronx cannot be taken from you, 
and that your commitment and your 
assessment of this country will be de-
fined in your way, not in the way of 
white supremacists, domestic terror-
ists, or insurrectionists. 
Madam Speaker, I think more than 
ever he has captured an important mo-
ment by saying he has hope, and that is 
what the Congressional Black Caucus 
represents for the millions of Ameri-
cans that we represent. He is right, our 
constituency is multicultural, they 
come from many different perspectives, 
they are Black, they are African Amer-
ican—as they may be desired to be 
called—they are Latinx, they are His-
panic, they are Anglo, they are White, 
they are Southeast Asian, they are 
Asian Pacific, they are LGBTQ, and 
they are varied. That is what we are 
here today to stand for. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. JONES), a 
distinguished member of the Judiciary 
Committee, among other committees, 
and a scholar in his own right, a law-
yer, and someone who has been able to 
be trained in the ways of the law, but 
whose heart is vested in the ways of 
justice. I am delighted to yield to my 
colleague for his time on the floor in 
this wonderful momentous occasion. 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished co-chair of this in-
credible Special Order sponsored by the 
Congressional Black Caucus for those 
very kind words. 
I will say, as someone who has spent 
most of his life following the work of 
this Black Caucus, it is an honor to fi-
nally join the legends, the luminaries 
who helped to inspire my own run for 
the United States Congress. Thank 
you. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
CBC for holding this hour to reflect on 
Black history. I want to share, in par-
ticular, the story of a young lawyer 
who came to the village of Hillburn in 
Rockland County, New York, during 
his fight to desegregate our public 
schools. 
b 2100 
Like many places in 1943, the Village 
of Hillburn had a main school for White 
children. It was called the Hillburn 
School. And it had a school for children

of color without a library, a play-
ground, or indoor plumbing. That was 
called the Brook School. 
But our elders did not accept this. 
They fought back. Parents of the 
Brook School children organized and, 
with the help of a young attorney with 
the NAACP’s legal defense fund, they 
sued the district. With the help of their 
lawyer, the parents of the Brook 
School children won their fight against 
segregation in a case that helped to lay 
the groundwork for Brown v. Board of 
Education 11 years later. 
Who was this young lawyer who came 
to the Village of Hillburn? 
He was the man who would later be-
come our Nation’s first Supreme Court 
Justice who was Black: Thurgood Mar-
shall. 
I am moved by the story because it 
shows how Black history creates Black 
futures, how the courage and resist-
ance of the Black leaders of years past 
are the reason a poor Black kid from 
Rockland County now stands in this 
special Chamber as the United States 
Congress Member representing that 
same school district today. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Congressman JONES so very 
much for that powerful statement. A 
powerful statement, obviously, a law-
yer’s lawyer to bring to our attention 
the 
great 
leadership 
of 
Justice 
Thurgood Marshall, civil rights attor-
ney Thurgood Marshall, from a lawyer 
whom we know will continue to pro-
mote justice now as a legislator. 
Madam Speaker, I want to take a 
moment to just put in the RECORD real-
ly the historical description of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus. 
Since its establishment in 1971, the 
Congressional Black Caucus has been 
committed to using the full constitu-
tional power, statutory authority, and 
financial resources of the Federal Gov-
ernment to ensure that Black Ameri-
cans and other marginalized commu-
nities in the United States have the op-
portunity to achieve the American 
Dream. 
As part of this commitment, the CBC 
has fought in the past 50 years to em-
power citizens and address their legis-
lative concerns by nursing a policy 
agenda that is inclusive, pragmatic, ef-
fective, and resonates with the Amer-
ican people. 
Just for a moment, I would like to 
comment on the dangerous interrelat-
edness of race and the insurrectionist 
day of January 6. 
We are on the floor because we have 
a unique history. We are a multiranged 
people and a multicultural people. We 
are individuals whose heritage is inter-
twined with other backgrounds. We are 
African Americans. We are Caribbean 
Americans. And in terms of African 
Americans, we are Caribbean Blacks, if 
you will. We come from all over the 
world, but we come to America and we 
are described by a singular history. 
And if we have come with a singular 
history, I think it is important to 
intertwine what happened on January 
6. Shockingly, Madam Speaker, those 
who came to object—so they say—to 
the duly qualified and legitimate elec-
tion of President Joe Biden and, of 
course, Vice President Harris, they, of 
course, came allegedly with that propo-
sition. But, at the same time, I am 
stunned by the words of a police officer 
by the name of Mr. Harry Dunn—coura-
geous and brave with so many others— 
who indicated: The rioters called me 
the n-word dozens of times. 
So here we are 50 years celebrating 
the Congressional Black Caucus. Here 
we are defenders of democracy. Many 
of our Members are former members of 
the United States military, having 
gone into battle, or our family mem-
bers have. Many fell in as early a war 
as World War I, World War II, the Ko-
rean war, the Vietnam war, Iraq, and 
Afghanistan, and other wars in be-
tween. We shed our blood for this coun-
try. 
And the so-called people who came 
and said they just wanted some democ-
racy, they believed that their can-
didate won, but they took enough time 
to call the sons and daughters of 
enslaved Africans, who wear the uni-
form defending democracy, the n-word. 
They took time to carry a fake flag, 
calling it the Confederate flag when it 
is a symbol in the 1960s of the harsh-
ness and brutality of segregation and 
the Klan. They took time to bring that 
flag to the United States Congress, in 
the midst of the highest number of 
elected persons of color, persons who 
are descendants in many different ways 
of enslaved Africans. 
But here I wanted to mention Mr. 
Dunn’s name. There were many others 
who were beaten that day. I honor 
them, and we will honor them as time 
goes. This night, tonight, we mention 
this gentleman who said most power-
fully—Harry Dunn recalled the sick-
ening events of January 6—when he 
says that the level of racist abuse he 
suffered caused him to break down in 
tears, but he was not broken. His quote 
was: ‘‘Y’all failed.’’ 
That is my message today. All of the 
brutality that we may have experi-
enced, which I will talk about in a mo-
ment, all of it failed. That is why we 
are here today fighting in the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee; fighting 
in the Science, Space, and Technology 
Committee; fighting in the Ways and 
Means Committee; fighting in the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee; the 
Judiciary; the Interior; the Armed 
Services Committee; the Oversight and 
Reform Committee; and the Budget 
Committee, where you will see our 
presence. 
We are fighting for America, but we 
are the conscience that drives the re-
ality that there are more people to be 
concerned about than those of us in 
this Chamber. That there are mothers 
and father who work every day, who 
don’t see the fruit of their labor. There 
are children who clamor for education, 
but it is not there. 
There are soldiers who need to have 
the line of hierarchy and the route to 
promotion and elevation, who don’t get 
it. There are businesspersons who have 
brilliant ideas, but can’t access the 
capital. There are incarcerated persons 
who are not guilty, but are still incar-
cerated. 
There are doors of college institu-
tions closed. There are people who 
want to do better with a new house, 
but still, in the 21st century, are red-
lined. And there are many who want to 
go places and cannot go, who are Afri-
can American. 
No, we are not complaining. We are 
trying to explain how much has been 
done by people who have had this kind 
of history. It is important to take note 
of that. 
Madam Speaker, may I have the time 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Texas has 24 minutes 
remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I yield to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. TORRES), if he will carry 
forth. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman, as 
always, for the inspiration of words. 
Our colleague, Congressman JONES, 
spoke earlier of Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation. Brown v. Board of Education 
was the first legal case I ever read. In 
high school, I participated in a form of 
legal debate known as moot court, 
which taught me how to think, read, 
write, and speak critically and art-
fully. I will never forget after reading 
Brown v. Board of Education how in-
spired I felt, those words in the field of 
education: Separate but equal is inher-
ently unequal. 
Those words inspired me to see my-
self—as a young Black man—as a pub-
lic servant and maybe one day as a 
Member of the United States Congress. 
But I have to be honest. If you had 
said to me 1 year ago that I would be-
come a Member of Congress during an 
infectious disease outbreak, that I 
would witness an insurrection against 
the U.S. Capitol during the electoral 
college vote count, and that I would 
then vote to impeach an outgoing 
President who had been impeached 
once before, I would have said that 
sounds a lot like a movie. 
So this has been the most draining 
and disorienting beginning for any 
freshman class in the modern history 
of the United States Congress, but I am 
nevertheless honored to be here. 
January 6 is a reminder that the mis-
sion of the CBC takes on a renewed ur-
gency. The Congress Member and I sit 
on the Homeland Security Committee, 
and one of our highest priorities is 
going to be counterterrorism. During 
one of our recent hearings, I made the 
observation that America has a pattern 
of willful blindness toward white su-
premacist extremism as a form of do-
mestic terror. 
Even though the statistics have been 
clear that white supremacist extre-
mism has been the dominant driver of 
violence in the United States for dec-
ades, the U.S. Government did not des-
ignate a white supremacist group as a

terrorist organization until 2020. 2020. 
Never mind the massacre against Afri-
can Americans, against Latinos, and 
against members of the LGBTQ com-
munity. It took the Federal Govern-
ment until 2020 to finally recognize 
white supremacy as a form of domestic 
terrorism. 
I am often asked: Whom do you ad-
mire in history? 
The gentlewoman brought up the Un-
derground Railroad, and I am a great 
admirer of Harriet Tubman, who, as 
the architect of the Underground Rail-
road, is America’s Moses. She was a 
genuine liberator of an enslaved peo-
ple. 
I also have deep admiration for Ida B. 
Wells, who was alone as a journalist in 
standing up to the campaign of domes-
tic terrorism and lynchings against Af-
rican Americans. And we have to draw 
from the legacy of Ida B. Wells and 
renew our commitment to fighting do-
mestic terrorism in our own time. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
joining the gentlewoman in that fight 
and learning from her. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
my coanchor has very powerfully cap-
tured the many heroes in our commu-
nity, historical heroes as well, and he-
roes who pushed against the edge, 
walked right up to the line, never 
failed to be courageous, never failed to 
work on behalf of people who were 
voiceless and powerless. 
Harriet Tubman was that woman. 
She was General Moses, and she told 
slaves that it was not going to be their 
task to stop along the railroad, they 
were going to get to their destination— 
and I guess she was a little harsh—dead 
or alive. 
That is the push of the Congressional 
Black Caucus. We are not violent peo-
ple, so I won’t say dead or alive. But we 
are consistently engaged in pushing 
the envelope, pushing the margins, and 
pushing the conscience of this Congress 
led certainly over a huge number of 
years by the late John Robert Lewis 
and John Conyers, who headed the Ju-
diciary Committee and fought against 
every civil rights injustice. 
So many leaders. As I indicated, 
Shirley Chisholm, who ran for the 
Presidency. And Barbara Jordan, who 
sat on the impeachment committee as 
a young Member and said, We, the Peo-
ple. She denied any right of anyone to 
undermine the Constitution. 
b 2115 
Her voice was strong and powerful. I 
am glad to call her my mentor and my 
predecessor. 
And so I just want to give these 
words. I want to capture some words 
here on that insurrection. 
Everyone knew the outcome of the 
2020 Presidential election long before 
January 6, 2021. We also knew that the 
States had gone to a lot of traversing, 
even they were sued, and they still 
came back as each State leader said, no 
fraud: This is the outcome. 
Because of the transparency of each 
State’s election administration and 
that of the joint meeting of Congress, 
it would simply confirm that Joe Biden 
had won more than a majority of the 
electoral votes along with winning the 
national popular vote by more than 
seven million votes. 
We all know that this was a historic 
election; more votes than we had ever 
counted, I believe, in the history of the 
United States. There was such a sense 
of exhilaration because democracy was 
alive. There were so many young peo-
ple that voted. So many people of the 
potpourri of America, all backgrounds. 
We felt so good about voting to-
gether, many of us voting the same 
way for the same candidate, as evi-
denced by his victory. States that we 
had lost 4 years ago, enthusiastically 
voting for change, for goodness, for a 
spirit of unity. We knew something was 
on the horizon. 
But isn’t it interesting that after 
that election, for months, people had 
been told a complete lie, which allowed 
them to stay in places that we did not 
know and conspire to come and attack 
this place, this holy place, this place of 
democracy, this place that has, Madam 
Speaker, above you, In God We Trust. 
They attacked this place and the riot 
came immediately after then-President 
Trump promoted a march on the Cap-
itol and called his supporters to stop 
the steal; never give up; never concede, 
and to fight like hell, during a speech 
that day, asserting that they would not 
have a country anymore if they did not 
act. 
I read these into our message of our 
power hour message, 50 years of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, because I 
think history will tell. Reading the an-
nals of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, you 
will see that members of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, when they were 
tiny, until we have expanded, have con-
sistently gone to the floor on questions 
of justice and expanding opportunity 
and ensuring that justice is a respecter 
of color or age or region. We fight for 
justice no matter what the color of 
your skin, what your background is. 
We are purists as it relates to justice. 
We love the Constitution, because— 
even though we were three-fifths of a 
person, we were not a human being 
when it was finalized—it was a docu-
ment that grew and continues to 
breathe rights, from the First Amend-
ment to the 13th Amendment, 14th 
Amendment, 15th Amendment, to the 
right for women to vote, to the amend-
ments that deal with a right to a trial 
by jury, to the Fifth Amendment, due 
process, and the protection of your 
property. These are all breathing docu-
ments and words, breathing amend-
ments that have allowed a people who 
were in bondage to scrap their way out 
of the devastation of hatred. We use 
this Constitution. 
But shamefully, that fight has to 
continue. And on January 6, that fight, 
that scab was torn off again. That rug 
was burning again. Those who came to 
say that they were fighting for Trump 
and fighting to overturn the election, 
but more importantly, they are fight-
ing because the election was theirs, 
they called a Black officer the N word 
more times than he can remember, 
caused him to break down, among oth-
ers. And he had the courage to say, all 
that they tried to do failed. 
Let me just show these depictions of 
our journey. I will start with this one. 
This year, 2021, is the 100th anniver-
sary—I hate to even use that term—of 
the Tulsa riot. Allegedly, a young 
Black man in an elevator was alleged 
to have touched a White woman. I 
think when he finally got out of the el-
evator it was alleged rape, or it was 
rape, a typical story, over and over 
again. 
That is why we have such pain for 
George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Walter 
Scott, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin, 
Ahmaud Arbery, Pamela Turner, San-
dra Bland, Jacob Blake, and Elijah 
McClain in Colorado, and names be-
yond, Sean Bell, Eric Garner, the 
mothers who have become friends, Mi-
chael Brown, that is why we have such 
pain. 
And I guess my constituent—the 
family that has become America’s fam-
ily, along with all the other mothers 
and fathers—George Floyd grew up in 
Houston, Texas, in the Cuney Homes, 
public housing. His mother was the 
queen of public housing, took in chil-
dren, fed children. They felt like they 
were at home in the Floyd family. 
Big George is what he was called. Big 
man. Took his brothers and sisters 
under his wing. George Floyd played 
basketball—my 
recollection 
is—in 
China with Yao Ming when they were 
young players, not pros. We never 
know who someone is. 
So this is the 100th anniversary of 
probably some of the likes of those 
names that I called. Life cut down. 
And this depiction is Captured Ne-
groes on way to Convention Hall dur-
ing the Tulsa race riot. They were cap-
tured. There was no justice. 300 Ne-
groes, Black Americans were buried in 
an unmarked grave, as we are told. 
This is how it was. This is how it was. 
This is how it was. 
The Congressional Black Caucus will 
be commemorating that this year. And 
I will introduce legislation with Sen-
ator WARREN, on the Tulsa race riots 
next week. 
4,000, 4,000-plus Blacks were hung. 
And as you can see, there were smiling 
faces in the crowd. It was entertain-
ment. Come to the town square. 
No, this is not a depiction of some 
dastardly person who did violent acts 
and raided through the community. 
This could have been someone walking 
along a dark road. It could have been 
the three boys in Mississippi during the 
civil rights movement; they were just 
driving, trying to get to their destina-
tion. 
These folks could have been walking. 
We had one woman who had a dispute 
with a storekeeper. She was a business-
woman. She was ultimately hung; 
never came back home. The family was 
looking for where she might be.

It looks like another celebratory oc-
casion, hanging. We will hear more of 
this when we proceed to discuss our 
commission to study and develop rep-
aration proposals. 
But let me—before I yield to my good 
friend and co-anchor, I just want you 
to see this one. This gentleman’s name 
was—I am going to call him Mr. Gor-
don. He is a slave—was a slave, de-
ceased. And clearly, those are mark-
ings of a very bad beating. But that is 
not the end of his story. 
This gentleman came out of slavery 
and fought in the Civil War on behalf of 
the Union. This is what we did. We al-
ways rise to the occasion. 
You will hear more about our story. 
But I wanted to make sure that we just 
got a sense of how we have been 
overcomers. 
But 
even 
with 
being 
overcomers, we know there is more to 
do. 
Madam Speaker, I am very delighted 
to be able to yield to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Ms. WILLIAMS), and she 
is, in her own right, a leader, a new 
member of this body, has civil rights in 
her blood, she is a mother, and she is 
here ready to fight for our children’s 
education and she will succeed. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, 
today 
my 
Congressional 
Black Caucus colleagues and I observe 
Black History Month and celebrate 50 
years of Our Power, Our Message. 
For 50 years, the Congressional Black 
Caucus has uplifted the voices of Black 
people and other marginalized commu-
nities so that they can share in the 
promise of America for all. 
For the 117th Congress, the Congres-
sional Black Caucus marks a new mile-
stone with 58 members, the largest 
membership in CBC history. The next 
50 years of Our Power, Our Message is 
strong. 
We are here in D.C. witnessing more 
Black history being made with the first 
Black woman, HBCU grad, our soror, 
and a member of our Congressional 
Black Caucus serving as Vice President 
of the United States. Indeed, our power 
and our message are strong. 
While we continue to make great 
strides, it is not lost on me that 2020 
was a difficult year for Black people 
across this country. Collectively, we 
battled a pandemic that continues to 
infect and kill Black people at dis-
proportionate rates. 
In my home State of Georgia, Black 
people are also experiencing some of 
the highest levels of unemployment in 
decades. By November 2020, Black 
Georgians had filed 71 percent more un-
employment claims than White, His-
panic, 
Latinx, 
and 
Asian-American 
workers combined. 
Being Black in Georgia, we fight 
daily for what so many take for grant-
ed in this country, the right to vote, 
the right to the fair and equal treat-
ment that George Floyd didn’t get, the 
right to be, the right to exist. 
Today, in particular, we reflect on 
how far we have to go. One year ago, 
Ahmaud Arbery was hunted down and 
murdered, simply because he was a 
Black man going for a jog in Bruns-
wick, Georgia. 
His murder by white supremacists 
and the subsequent delays in realizing 
justice may seem new, but Black peo-
ple have dealt with systemic racism for 
centuries in America, and we are here 
to break these structures and dis-
mantle these systems using our power 
and our message as the Congressional 
Black Caucus. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for her words 
and certainly her powerful words on 
the importance of our Vice President, 
the Honorable Vice President Harris. 
We are grateful for her. 
It is my pleasure to yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TORRES), 
my co-anchor. 
b 2130 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I want to pay tribute to my 
classmate, Congress Member NIKEMA 
WILLIAMS, who, as the chair of the 
Georgia Democratic Party, was instru-
mental in winning the Senate for the 
Democratic Party. 
Thanks to the leadership of on-the- 
ground organizers like Congress Mem-
ber WILLIAMS, a Democratic Senate, a 
Democratic House, a Democratic Presi-
dent means we have the makings of an 
FDR moment. We have a historic op-
portunity to govern as boldly in the 
21st century as FDR did in the 20th 
century. 
Systemic racism in America traces 
back 400 years, and it is incredible to 
think that in the 400-year history of 
our country, we are as close as we have 
ever been to confronting the root 
causes of systemic racism. 
That is the burden that we bear as 
the Congressional Black Caucus, but it 
is not only a burden. It is a blessing. 
Public service in an FDR moment is a 
blessing. 
It 
is 
said 
the 
first 
historian, 
Herodotus, said that he wrote the first 
historical book so that the deeds of 
brave people cannot be forgotten. That 
is the same reason the CBC exists, so 
that the deeds of Black heroes like 
Harriet Tubman and Ida B. Wells, like 
John Lewis, like Barack Obama and 
KAMALA HARRIS, are never forgotten, 
that the contributions of Black Amer-
ica should remain front and center in 
the life of our country. 
It has been an honor to be with you, 
Congress Member JACKSON LEE. I can-
not tell you how honored I feel to be a 
member of the CBC. 
You know, I grew up poor most of my 
life. I was raised by a single mother 
who had to raise three children on min-
imum wage, which in the 1990s was 
$4.25 an hour. I grew up in public hous-
ing, in conditions of mold and mildew, 
leaks and lead, without consistent heat 
and hot water in the winter. I never 
could have imagined myself as a mem-
ber of the greatest institution in the 
United States Congress, the Congres-
sional Black Caucus. It is an honor to 
be here with you in this caucus at this 
moment. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
we are humbled by the gentleman’s 
words. We are humbled by this moment 
in history. 
I will conclude my remarks by build-
ing on Congressman TORRES’, that we 
are humbled, but we are honored, but 
we are ready to work. 
I will leave you with these words 
from our colleague and others. John 
Lewis said we are in a very difficult 
time in our country. I am afraid we 
may wake up one day in America, and 
our democracy is gone. But he went on 
to say that when you see something 
that is not right, say something, do 
something, get into good trouble. 
One of our ancient fathers, Frederick 
Douglass, said that there is no power 
without struggle. 
Tonight, we have laid the landscape 
of genius, contributions, sacrifice, bril-
liance, and the commitment to civil 
rights that is the Congressional Black 
Caucus. Our message, our power, Our 
Power, Our Message. We will continue 
to work. We will not yield, not give in, 
not give out, and not give up. 
Madam Speaker, let me thank my 
colleagues for joining the CBC Special 
Order tonight, and I thank the Speak-
er. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
this evening, on the occasion of this special 
order hour, I rise to commemorate the Con-
gressional Black Caucus and its rich history of 
representation of Black voices across the na-
tion. 
Today’s Black Caucus is the materialization 
of the vision that our founding members had 
50 years ago. Now nearly 60 members strong, 
our caucus has fought to empower the Black 
community so that they too may achieve the 
American Dream. And our success in doing 
so, as well as upholding the fundamentals of 
democracy, is unparalleled in this body’s his-
tory. 
Now, in the face of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, we face one of our toughest challenges 
yet. While it is true that the pandemic has af-
fected all of us in some way, it has especially 
highlighted and exacerbated the inequalities 
that the Black community still faces in our so-
ciety. We have been forced to battle the pan-
demic on two fronts—health-wise and eco-
nomically. 
Studies show that the comorbidities most 
closely associated with COVID–19 complica-
tions are diabetes and hypertension, which 
disproportionately affect the Black community. 
The prevalence of these diseases is systemic 
in nature—a result of decades of a lack of ac-
cess to quality, accessible, and culturally com-
petent medical care. 
I have also met with Black business owners 
in North Texas, who credited preexisting fund-
ing gaps and feeble relationships with lenders 
for their hardships during the pandemic. Dis-
advantaged at the onset, these businesses 
became increasingly unable to meet market 
needs, and reports now say that the pandemic 
has wiped out nearly half of Black small busi-
nesses in our country. 
In the face of the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
Black Caucus has played a critical role in the

drafting and enacting of legislation to support 
Black Americans—including President Biden’s 
newest package. Billed as the American Res-
cue Plan, the $1.9 trillion relief package con-
sists of several provisions advocated for by 
the Black Caucus. Among them include $400 
billion for vaccine distribution with a focus on 
minority communities, $15 billion for equitably 
distributed grants to minority-owned small 
businesses, and investment in infrastructure 
projects to create more jobs for unemployed 
minorities.

to continuing to work with my colleagues in

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will proceed to executive ses-
sion to resume consideration of the fol-
lowing nomination, which the clerk 
will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Linda Thomas- 
Greenfield, of Louisiana, to be the Rep-
resentative of the United States of 
America to the United Nations, with 
the rank and status of the Ambassador 
Extraordinary 
and 
Plenipotentiary, 
and the Representative of the United 
States of America in the Security 
Council of the United Nations. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today 
the Senate will complete the confirma-
tion of two key nominees: Linda Thom-
as-Greenfield to serve as U.N. Ambas-
sador and Tom Vilsack to serve as Ag-
riculture Secretary. 
As I said yesterday, the Senate will 
also confirm Jennifer Granholm this 
week to serve as the next Energy Sec-
retary and begin the confirmation of 
Dr. Miguel Cardona to serve as the 
next Education Secretary. We also 
hope to do Gina Raimondo, nominee for 
Secretary of Commerce, early next 
week. 
Each of these nominees has received 
bipartisan support in committee. Each 
of these nominees is undoubtedly quali-
fied for their positions, a stark depar-
ture from the caliber of nominees the 
Senate was made to consider during 
the previous administration. 
Make no mistake, the Senate will 
move quickly to approve key officials 
in the Biden administration this work 
period. These Cabinet positions and 
Agencies have an immense influence 
over the policies of the United States, 
impacting hundreds of millions of 
American lives. At a time of acute na-
tional challenge, we need qualified 
leaders atop our Federal Agencies—and 
fast. and that is what we intend to do. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, on COVID, while the 
Senate will be busy fulfilling its con-
stitutional duty to advise and consent 
on Presidential nominees, Democrats 
remain hard at work preparing the des-
perately needed COVID relief bill. 
Our country is still in the throes of a 
crisis. Yesterday, we passed that grim 
milestone of 500,000 deaths, a towering 
and incomprehensible figure. Millions 
of Americans have reported being thou-
sands of dollars behind on rent, on util-
ities. Small businesses are hanging on 
for dear life. Vaccinating 330 million 
Americans as efficiently as possible is 
one of the most crucial and complex 
undertakings of our times. 
What we need to do now is put our 
foot on the gas to end the pandemic as 
quickly as possible, get our economy 
back to normal, and repair the damage 
that has been done. That is what the 
American Rescue Plan is all about. It 
will deliver the resources to keep small 
businesses afloat; Americans in their 
homes; and teachers, firefighters, and 
other essential employees in the public 
sector on the job.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S794 
February 23, 2021 
It will send a direct check to Ameri-
cans struggling with a once-in-a-life-
time financial burden. It will boost 
vaccine distribution. And it will pro-
vide funding and guidance for schools 
to reopen as quickly and safely as pos-
sible. 
That last point, in particular, should 
appeal to my Republican friends who 
have been raising concern about school 
closures. We all want the schools to re-
open safely. We are all worried about 
the cost of virtual learning on children 
and parents. 
The solution is simple. It is not giv-
ing a speech here on the Senate floor. 
It is not criticizing teachers or school 
administrators. It is giving school dis-
tricts the funding they need to reopen 
safely. It is expensive—expensive—to 
reopen safely during the COVID crisis. 
We want to do it as quickly as possible, 
and it is hard to understand that our 
Republican friends are saying: ‘‘Open 
up the schools’’ and ‘‘I won’t vote for 
any money for the schools’’ to do just 
that. It is a complete contradiction. 
The Republican position seems to be 
that these difficult challenges will fix 
themselves, that we don’t need any 
more aid; we did enough already. Any-
one who knows anything about schools 
knows, in the vast majority of schools 
in this country, that is just not the 
case. 
So let our Republican friends put 
their votes where their speeches are, in 
helping the schools, in getting the 
money, in opening the schools safely— 
not in simply trying to make a polit-
ical 
point 
and 
then 
trashing 
the 
schools without giving them the money 
they need. It makes no sense whatso-
ever. It is a total contradiction. 
Also, if we don’t act, enhanced unem-
ployment benefits will expire for mil-
lions of Americans in need. If we don’t 
act, millions of struggling families will 
miss out on direct payments and an ex-
pansion of the child tax credit and the 
earned income tax credit. If we don’t 
act, we risk the same long, slow, and 
painful recovery we experienced after 
the financial crisis of 2008, when Con-
gress did too little to get our country 
back on track. 
The worst thing we could do would be 
to slow down now before the race is 
won. We will not do that. Later this 
week, the House—and, soon thereafter, 
the Senate—will start working on 
President Biden’s American Rescue 
Plan. 
Mayors, Governors, and economists 
from across the political spectrum 
agree that it should be a sizable effort. 
Treasury Secretary Yellen told us that 
‘‘the smartest thing we can do is act 
big.’’ Federal Chairman Powell warned 
that we are ‘‘a long way off from full 
recovery’’ and that the greater risk lies 
in doing too little rather than doing 
too much. 
Most importantly, the American peo-
ple in poll after poll overwhelmingly 
approve of President Biden’s American 
Rescue Plan. One of the last polls I saw 
showed a majority of Republicans—vot-
ers, citizens, Americans, Republican 
citizens, Republican Americans—agree 
with this plan. The Nation understands 
that we are not out of the woods yet 
and that Congress should do what is 
necessary to finish the job. Where are 
our Republican friends? 
As I have said from the start, Demo-
crats remain committed to working 
with our colleagues from the other side 
of the aisle to improve the bill, but at 
the end of the day, the American peo-
ple sent us here with a job to do, and 
the clock is ticking. Democrats will 
not wait to move forward with the 
American Rescue Plan and taking the 
next important step in getting our 
country back to normal. 
PROTESTS 
Mr. President, finally, January 6 is a 
day all of us will remember forever. 
The Capitol was breached by a violent 
mob. The Confederate flag was flown in 
the halls of our Union for the first time 
in American history. Insurrectionists— 
angry, bigoted—stood a few inches 
from where I am standing now. It is 
hard to believe these hallowed halls 
were occupied by such terrible, awful 
lawbreakers. Five Americans lost their 
lives, including a Capitol Police officer. 
The impeachment of Donald Trump 
was one necessary consequence of the 
attack of January 6, but it is far from 
the only one. We must and will con-
tinue to recon with the events of that 
day. This morning—in fact, as we 
speak—the Senate Rules Committee 
and the Senate Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs Committee are 
holding a joint hearing to examine the 
attack on the Capitol. The committees 
will hear important testimony from 
the acting chief of the Capitol Police, 
the former chief of police, and former 
members of the Sergeant at Arms. 
Later this week, Senators will be 
briefed by the acting chief of police and 
the Acting Sergeant at Arms on the 
current and future security measures 
around the Capitol. 
It is our solemn responsibility to pro-
tect the Capitol and everyone who 
works and visits within it. It is our sol-
emn duty to prevent a day like Janu-
ary 6 from ever, ever being repeated. At 
the same time, the Capitol has been 
and must be once again a symbol of de-
mocracy that is accessible to the peo-
ple. No one expects the Capitol to re-
main a militarized zone in perpetuity. 
As I said, no one expects the Capitol to 
remain a militarized zone in per-
petuity. We must strive to strike the 
difficult balance between access and se-
curity and better understand the intel-
ligence and security failures that led to 
the attack on January 6. This will be a 
crucial and bipartisan undertaking. I 
am glad that Senators from both the 
Rules and Homeland Security Commit-
tees, from both parties, are starting 
that important work today. 
I now yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
millions of American kids in the public 
school system have been robbed of a 
year, and counting, of anything resem-
bling a proper education. It has been a 
historically tough year. That is why 
Americans are so excited our Nation 
appears to be approaching a major 
turning point. 
Here are just a few recent headlines: 
A U.S. Vaccine Surge Is Coming, With Mil-
lions of Doses Promised 
Another headline: 
America’s vaccine rollout has been among 
the best in the world 
Another headline: 
CDC finds scant spread of coronavirus in 
schools with precautions in place 
Here is one from my home State: 
COVID–19 cases plummet in Kentucky 
nursing homes, a key target for the vaccine 
So let’s take a look at the economy: 
U.S. Retail Sales Surprise With Sharpest 
Advance in Seven Months 
Blue-Collar Jobs Boom as COVID–19 Boosts 
Housing, E-Commerce Demand 
Another headline: 
Consumer Demand Snaps Back. Factories 
Can’t Keep Up. 
To be clear, this isn’t over. The bat-
tle is not won yet. But the day is ap-
proaching when we will be able to end 
this defensive crouch and safely re-
claim our normal lives. 
Last year the Senate built the larg-
est 
peacetime 
fiscal 
expansion 
in 
American history. We spent $4 trillion 
on 
five 
overwhelmingly 
bipartisan 
packages. The most recent became law 
just 2 months ago. Funding for hos-
pitals 
and 
providers 
kept 
our 
healthcare system above water. The 
Paycheck Protection Program saved 
Main Street small businesses. Direct 
relief and extra unemployment aid 
helped working families endure the 
shutdown. Operation Warp Speed laid 
the groundwork for our historic sprint 
toward vaccinations. 
These were strong, bipartisan poli-
cies, targeted to what families specifi-
cally needed to wage the war, but 
today 
Democrats 
are 
steamrolling 
ahead with a massive spending plan on 
a completely partisan basis. It did not 
receive a single House Republican vote 
in committee yesterday because their 
partisan plan is not targeted toward 
helping Americans reclaim their lives 
and their country from this invader. 
Instead, here is what it is: a combina-
tion of miscellaneous, non-COVID-re-
lated, liberal wish-list items and the 
kinds of bandaid policies that make a 
defensive crouch slightly less painful 
but don’t help get us back on offense. 
Let’s take a look at K–12 schooling. 
Until very recently, the new adminis-
tration’s own scientists had been crys-
tal clear. Earlier this month, CDC Di-
rector Rochelle Walensky said: 
There is increasing data to suggest that 
schools can safely reopen. 
A major CDC study found in-person 
schooling does not—not—fuel commu-
nity transmission.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S795 
February 23, 2021 
Last month, Dr. Fauci said: 
It’s less likely for a child to get infected in 
the school setting than if they were just in 
the community. 
But Big Labor special interests didn’t 
appreciate science undercutting their 
political goals. The empire struck 
back, and the Democratic leaders who 
love to claim the mantle of science ran 
away from the science as fast as they 
could. Now the CDC Director admits 
that ‘‘the lived experiences’’—whatever 
that is—of government employees got 
between the hard science and the final 
guidance. It is a lot of points for can-
dor. 
The unions had spoken. The goal-
posts were on the move. And the White 
House keeps endorsing the idea that 
schools 
need 
the 
Democrats’ 
new 
spending plan to reopen, when the 
science disagrees. And furthermore, 
just 5 percent—5 percent—of what they 
propose to spend on schools would even 
be spent this year. Let me say that 
again. In this big COVID package, only 
5 percent of what they propose to spend 
on schools would be spent this year. In 
other words, the spendout is over years 
ahead. You would think their view is, 
we are never going to get over the 
coronavirus. 
The United Kingdom just announced 
they will have kids back in school in 
less than 2 weeks—2 weeks. Countries 
like Spain and France have had kids in 
classrooms for months already. The 
European Centre for Disease Preven-
tion has no problem affirming the 
science—that closing schools is ‘‘un-
likely to provide significant additional 
protection of children’s health.’’ Even 
here at home, private and religious 
schools have been teaching kids in per-
son for months without causing any ex-
plosion in the spread of the virus. 
Science tells us unambiguously that 
in-person schooling can be quite safe 
and that having young children spend 
all day staring into a laptop is a night-
mare. The evidence is crystal clear. Big 
Labor bureaucrats keep refusing to fol-
low the science. 
In my hometown of Louisville, our 
union-backed school board vice chair-
man now asserts, with no evidence: 
I think we’re probably likely to see better 
instructional outcomes . . . if we stay [re-
mote] for the rest of the school year. 
Ridiculous. No facts. No evidence. 
Just a personal whim. These are the 
people controlling our kids’ futures and 
their parents’ lives. 
One anonymous teacher told report-
ers: 
We already have a schedule and a routine 
going. We don’t need to be babysitting for six 
weeks because parents are upset. 
Let me say that again. 
One anonymous teacher told report-
ers that we already have a schedule 
and a routine going. We don’t need to 
be babysitting for 6 weeks because par-
ents are upset. 
By the way, failing grades in middle 
schools are up 388 percent in our coun-
ty. Failing grades in middle schools are 
up 388 percent in our county while 
these kids are stuck at home. 
The Biden administration has a clear 
obligation to tackle the special inter-
est madness head-on. Our kids are suf-
fering, not because science says they 
must be—it doesn’t. It is just because a 
small group of powerful grownups has 
decided they prefer it this way. In-
stead, the White House keeps parroting 
the anti-science myths. They back this 
notion that schools need the Demo-
crats’ new spending plan before they 
can reopen, except that science com-
pletely disagrees—completely; except 
that only a tiny fraction of the funding 
request would even be spent this fiscal 
year. 
Our children’s futures are literally at 
stake. The administration has got to 
stop taking orders from the public sec-
tor unions that give generously to 
Democratic campaigns. This is exhibit 
A in why relief legislation must be tar-
geted to the actual needs we face now. 
American families should be the start-
ing point, not preconceived political 
priorities. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Now, Mr. President, on one related 
matter, today, our colleagues on the 
HELP Committee will question Xavier 
Becerra, President Biden’s nominee to 
run the Department of Health and 
Human Services. 
Amid a global pandemic, the Presi-
dent has made a puzzling selection for 
this crucial post: the famously partisan 
attorney general of California. Mr. 
Becerra has no particular experience or 
expertise in health. His chief passion 
project in California seemed to be 
using the force of the government to 
attack Americans’ religious liberty and 
freedom of conscience. 
In 2017, the Department he is nomi-
nated to lead finally provided a reli-
gious exemption to a controversial 
ObamaCare mandate. Mr. Becerra led 
the lawsuit to challenge it. He used his 
taxpayer-funded office to sue Catholic 
nuns who didn’t want government to 
force them to violate their beliefs. This 
is a pattern with Mr. Becerra. When a 
California law forcing pro-life crisis 
pregnancy centers to advertise abor-
tion was challenged in court, Mr. 
Becerra defended it to the bitter end. 
His absurd position in favor of gov-
ernment-compelled speech was slapped 
down by the Supreme Court. Over the 
last 2 years, the HHS Office for Civil 
Rights literally has had to hold Cali-
fornia and Mr. Becerra in violation of 
conscience protections that are actu-
ally written into Federal law. His zeal-
ous refusal to respect the citizens’ 
legal rights positioned his State to po-
tentially forfeit hundreds of millions of 
dollars in HHS funding. That is how 
committed they were to these viola-
tions. And now the fox wants to guard 
the henhouse? 
We will review Mr. Becerra’s testi-
mony today, but I am hard-pressed to 
see any way such a radical and under-
qualified nominee should fill such a 
critical post at this crucial time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in his in-
augural address, President Biden spoke 
about his desire to unify. 
He said this: 
Today, on this January day, my whole soul 
is in this: bringing America together, unit-
ing our people, uniting our nation. 
Admirable words, but words have to 
be met with action, and, right now, we 
are not seeing much of an attempt to 
unify from the President or his party. 
In fact, we are seeing pretty much the 
opposite. The Democrats have made it 
very clear they are determined to pass 
another COVID bill on a purely par-
tisan basis, which is particularly dis-
appointing because, up until 
now, 
COVID relief has been a bipartisan 
process. That is right. To date, Con-
gress has passed five COVID relief bills, 
and every single one of those bills has 
been overwhelmingly bipartisan. 
I might add, last year, when we were 
in the majority, Senate Democrats 
made it very clear that they thought 
the minority should have a voice in 
COVID relief and that any legislation 
should reflect the thoughts of both par-
ties. The Democratic leader filibus-
tered the CARES Act—our largest 
COVID relief bill—multiple times until 
he got a version that he was satisfied 
with, but now that the Democrats are 
in the majority, apparently, they have 
decided that it is their way or the high-
way. Forget the fact that the Senate is 
evenly divided between Republicans 
and Democrats. The Democrats are de-
termined to ensure that the Repub-
licans and the Americans they rep-
resent don’t have a voice in this bill. 
The Democrats’ move to use rec-
onciliation to force through a purely 
partisan COVID bill might be under-
standable—and I add ‘‘might’’—if the 
Republicans had made it clear that we 
opposed doing anything else on COVID, 
but that couldn’t be further from the 
truth. The Republicans have made it 
very clear that we are willing to work 
with the Democrats on additional tar-
geted relief. Just weeks ago, 10 Repub-
lican Senators put together a plan and 
met with President Biden for 2 hours to 
discuss a bipartisan agreement, but 
while the President certainly listened 
to them graciously, it quickly became 
clear that their efforts didn’t matter. 
It didn’t matter how willing the Repub-
licans were to negotiate; the Demo-
crats had no intention of reaching an 
agreement. They wanted to go it alone, 
and they were not going to let the Re-
publicans stop them. 
In a speech a few days ago, President 
Biden acknowledged that people have

asked: 
What would they have me cut? What would 
they have me leave out?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S796 
February 23, 2021 
Well, let me offer a few ideas. 
For starters, it might be a good idea 
to cut out the sections of the Demo-
crats’ bill that have nothing to do with 
combating COVID. The Democrats are 
calling this a COVID relief bill, but in 
actual fact, much of this bill has little 
to do with the coronavirus. In fact, less 
than 10 percent of the bill is directly 
related to combating COVID. 
If President Biden wants to know 
what sections of the bill to cut, I might 
suggest starting with the bill’s min-
imum wage hike. The Democratic bill 
would more than double the Federal 
minimum wage at a cost of an esti-
mated 1.4 million jobs—that according 
to the Congressional Budget Office. 
That would be problematic enough at a 
time when we are already dealing with 
substantial job losses, but it is even 
worse when you realize that the people 
most likely to lose their jobs as a re-
sult of this hike would be lower income 
workers. 
I would also suggest that the Presi-
dent cut his $86 billion bailout of mul-
tiemployer pension plans, which has 
nothing to do with emergency COVID 
relief. 
The President could also consider 
cutting his $350 billion slush fund for 
States and localities, which would be 
used mostly to reward States that shut 
down their businesses for extended pe-
riods and, therefore, have higher unem-
ployment rates. 
It has become clear the majority of 
States are doing OK financially despite 
the pandemic. A number of States ac-
tually saw higher tax revenues in 2020, 
and a majority of States have the re-
sources needed to weather the rest of 
this crisis. Three hundred fifty billion 
dollars far exceeds projected State 
need. 
And while we are on that topic, the 
economic stimulus provided by Presi-
dent Biden’s bill, in general, far ex-
ceeds the economic need and may actu-
ally harm the economy. 
Even without a dollar more of stim-
ulus spending, our economy is expected 
to grow at a robust 3.7 percent in 2021. 
The massive amount of spending that 
the President is proposing to inject 
into the economy runs the very real 
risk of overheating the economy and 
driving up inflation, and you don’t 
have to take my word for it. Even some 
liberal economists have expressed their 
concern over the size of the Democrats’ 
coronavirus legislation and the damage 
that it could do to the economy. 
Then, of course, there is the money 
the bill includes for schools. Now, 
while children in some places, like 
South Dakota, are in school, we need 
to get all kids back to in-person learn-
ing. In-person learning is important for 
kids’ academic, social, and emotional 
health, and as Republicans have dem-
onstrated, we want to ensure that 
schools have the resources they need to 
get back into the classroom safely. 
Our previous coronavirus bills con-
tained more than $100 billion for edu-
cation, and I think it is safe to say that 
every Republican would support addi-
tional dollars, if needed, but the fact of 
the matter is, schools still have bil-
lions 
of 
dollars 
from 
previous 
coronavirus legislation that remains 
unspent. And the Biden bill would ap-
propriate an additional $129 billion for 
schools that schools would get—they 
would get—whether or not they get 
kids back into the classroom. 
On top of that, most of that money 
would go to schools beginning next 
year and stretching all the way to 2028; 
in other words, long after the pandemic 
will be over. In fact, less—if you can 
believe this, less than 5 percent of the 
education spending would occur this 
year. 
Ultimately, the Biden bill’s school 
funding ends up looking less like a plan 
to get our kids back in schools and 
more like caving in to the teachers’ 
unions. 
So if President Biden would like to 
know what to cut, I would suggest he 
start with some of the things I have 
highlighted. And I would ask—I would 
ask that he and the Democratic leader-
ship abandon their plan to shove 
through a bloated, partisan bill, paid 
for with all borrowed money—every 
single dollar goes on the debt—and to 
start trying for the unity that the 
President has talked about. 
The President could show that he 
really meant what he said in his inau-
gural address by sitting down, in a seri-
ous way, with Republicans to develop 
targeted relief legislation. 
We are ready to come to the table. 
The ball is in the President’s court. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise in support of the nomination of 
Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield 
to be the United States Ambassador to 
the United Nations. 
Our next U.N. Ambassador will in-
herit the monumental task of rebuild-
ing our frayed alliances after four 
years of isolation and division, in 
which the United States retreated from 
our leadership role in promoting de-
mocracy, freedom, human rights, and 
the rule of law. There is no person bet-
ter suited to this task than Ambas-
sador Linda Thomas-Greenfield. 
In a Foreign Service career spanning 
more than three decades, Ambassador 
Thomas-Greenfield served with distinc-
tion both in Washington and around 
the globe, including at the U.S. Mission 
to the United Nations that she will now 
lead. 
As the son of a Foreign Service Offi-
cer and cochair of the Senate Foreign 
Service Caucus, I am also acutely 
aware of the significance of President 
Biden selecting a career Foreign Serv-
ice Officer for this position. For 4 
years, members of the Foreign Service 
have been maligned, demeaned, and 
marginalized by the people trusted to 
lead them. The selection of a career 
Foreign Service Officer to represent 
the United States at the United Na-
tions marks a sharp turn away from 
that shameful chapter. 
I look forward to working with Am-
bassador Thomas-Greenfield as we take 
on the difficult work of restoring our 
standing in the world, rebuilding our 
alliances, and investing in the men and 
women of our Foreign Service. I am 
proud to support her nomination. 
VOTE ON THOMAS-GREENFIELD NOMINATION

the previous order, the question is, Will 
the Senate advise and consent to the

riculture. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will be 20 
minutes of debate equally divided be-
tween the two leaders or their des-
ignees. 
The Senator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I 
am very pleased today to rise to sup-
port the nomination of our former Sec-
retary of Agriculture, Tom Vilsack. We 
are very lucky that he is willing to 
serve again. He is certainly no stranger 
to all of us, and we are very fortunate 
that he is willing to once again be part 
of public service. In serving as Agri-
culture Secretary during all 8 years of 
the Obama administration, Secretary 
Vilsack presided over the USDA with 
decisive, effective leadership. It was a 
pleasure to work with him. 
The Agriculture Committee held a 
bipartisan hearing earlier this month, 
and mere hours later, we voted to ad-
vance his nomination without any ob-
jection. His deep knowledge of agri-
culture and rural America is needed 
now more than ever, for our farmers, 
our families, and our rural commu-
nities have so many challenges right 
now. 
The COVID–19 crisis is continuing to 
disrupt our food supply chain for farm-
ers, food processors, and essential 
workers. Tens of millions of families 
still don’t have enough to eat and are 
lining up at food banks in order to put 
food on the table. The climate crisis is 
posing an extremely grave threat to 
the long-term viability of our economy 
and our food supply. Farmers of color, 
who have long faced civil rights abuses 
and systemic racism, continue to expe-
rience economic disparities. 
On top of all of this, there is a lot of 
work to be done to rebuild the USDA 
workforce so that the Department can 
fulfill its very important mission. 
American 
farmers, 
families, 
and 
rural communities need strong, effec-
tive leadership now more than ever. 
When it comes to strengthening our 
food and farm economy, I am very con-
fident that soon-to-be-confirmed Sec-
retary Tom Vilsack will be more than 
up to the task. He has a proven track 
record and will embrace new ideas in a 
new era at the Department. 
I know he is committed to addressing 
the COVID–19 pandemic, and I know he 
is committed to focusing on feeding 
our families in need. We have more 
than 50 million Americans today who 
are in a hunger crisis, themselves and 
their families. I know he cares deeply 
and is committed to making sure they 
are able to feed their families. 
I know he is very focused on tackling 
the climate crisis and has done a lot of 
work, since leaving as the Secretary of 
Agriculture a few years ago, focusing 
on voluntary, producer-led, farmer- 
friendly efforts that can make a real 
difference and allow agriculture to lead 
in addressing the climate crisis. 
I also know he is very focused and 
committed on addressing the racial 
discrimination that we have seen sys-
temically over the years in agriculture 
and addressing those issues in a very 
fair and equitable way. I look forward 
to partnering with him on these issues. 
Senator BOOZMAN and I enjoyed our 
first hearing, which was his confirma-
tion 
hearing. 
I 
look 
forward 
to 
partnering with Senator BOOZMAN and 
our entire committee to be able to 
move forward on a whole range of 
issues that are important for all of us, 
for everybody in our country. To do 
that, we need a great partner and an ef-
fective partner in the Secretary of the 
Department of Agriculture, and I know 
with great confidence that this person 
is Tom Vilsack. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Presi-
dent, as the United States is facing its 
worst hunger crisis since the Great De-
pression and family farms are strug-
gling, President Biden has nominated 
Thomas Vilsack to reprise his role as 
Secretary of Agriculture and capably 
steward the Department to address

February 23, 2021 
these critical needs and support our 
rural communities. 
Mr. Vilsack served as Agriculture 
Secretary for all 8 years of the Obama 
administration, 
overseeing 
invest-
ments in rural communities, healthier 
school meals, and better food safety 
standards. He also chaired the first 
White House Rural Council, which 
streamlined the effectiveness of Fed-
eral programs serving rural America, 
engaged stakeholders on issues and so-
lutions in rural communities, and pro-
moted and coordinated private-sector 
partnerships in those communities. 
Our 
agricultural 
landscape 
has 
changed over the last 4 years, and we 
must accelerate our transition to net- 
zero agriculture by incentivizing prac-
tices like crop-covering and carbon se-
questration. Agricultural conservation 
practices are also critical for achieving 
the pollution-reduction targets for ni-
trogen, 
phosphorus, 
and 
sediment 
under the Chesapeake Bay TMDL. I 
look forward to working closely with 
Mr. Vilsack to advance our climate 
goals. 
Additionally, 
as 
communities 
of 
color experience disproportionate eco-
nomic hardships as a result of the 
Covid–19 pandemic in addition to dec-
ades of discrimination within USDA, I 
will hold Mr. Vilsack to his promise to 
‘‘fully 
deeply 
and 
completely 
address[ing] inequities’’ within the de-
partment and show ‘‘zero tolerance for 
discrimination.’’ 
Thomas Vilsack has the experience 
and insight to provide immediate relief 
to our struggling farmers, families, and 
rural communities. For these reasons, I 
support his nomination for Secretary 
of Agriculture. 
Ms. STABENOW. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, it 
is a real honor to be down here with my 
friend and the chairwoman of the Agri-
culture Committee, Senator STABENOW, 
and I appreciate her cooperation in 
working so very hard and providing the 
leadership to get Secretary Vilsack 
confirmed. 
The nomination hearing was held a 
few weeks ago by the Committee on 
Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry to 
vet the former Secretary and now fu-
ture Secretary Vilsack. The timing was 
unusual, but it displayed the bipartisan 
nature of the committee. The com-
mittee was not officially organized, so 
the chairwoman and I, because we 
didn’t want to set a precedent and 
didn’t have any precedent in that situ-
ation, led the hearing together. I trust, 
in going forward, that the chairwoman 
will continue to work with me and our 
minority members on the committee 
to assist the Agriculture Committee in 
a truly bipartisan way. We have the ex-
ample of her and Senator Roberts in 
the great job that they did in working 
as a team. 
Secretary Vilsack is no stranger to 
the Department of Agriculture, in hav-
ing served as the Secretary from 2009 
through 2017. He has an excellent rep-
utation of putting rural America at the 
top of his agenda. I am a strong be-
liever that past performance is indic-
ative of future performance, so I am 
confident that Secretary Vilsack will 
be successful this go-around. 
I look forward to strengthening my 
working relationship with the Sec-
retary so we can find success in sup-
porting those who work at the Depart-
ment and assisting those whom the De-
partment serves. Whether that success 
is borne from the Secretary’s utilizing 
existing authorities or through new 
legislation, I trust that the Secretary 
will work with Congress as the agri-
culture community tackles new and ex-
isting challenges and works to build on 
countless past successes. 
The Department must continue to 
work with all producers in order to 
provide them with certainty and with 
predictability. Farmers and ranchers 
find themselves in a curious position 
and curious times in battling COVID, 
natural disasters, and turning the tide 
of a few tumultuous trade seasons. The 
Secretary must ensure that this ad-
ministration works with producers of 
all regions and all commodities and 
that the Department does not make 
the hard work of farmers and ranchers 
more difficult by throwing up obstacles 
as opposed to opening doors of oppor-
tunity. 
I look forward to Secretary Vilsack’s 
coming back to the committee in a few 
weeks to discuss his plans in depth for 
the Department as was agreed to at his 
hearing. I believe the discussion will 
help the committee have a clearer pic-
ture of the Department and the work 
that lays before us. I will be voting to 
confirm Tom Vilsack, former Sec-
retary and future Secretary. I urge 
others to do so as well. 
Again, thank you to the chairwoman 
for her collegiality and cooperation. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Michigan.

NOMINATION OF THOMAS J. VILSACK 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
wanted to talk a little bit about the 
vote I just took here with regard to our 
Secretary of Agriculture, Secretary 
Vilsack, who is now the new Secretary 
or on his way to becoming the new Sec-
retary. 
You know, what I have tried to do 
when looking at nominees is I typically 
kind of look at three different ques-
tions: Do they have experience for the 
job, the experience necessary for the 
job, do they have views that I believe 
will help the country and in particular 
help my State, and do they care about 
the people they will be impacting? So 
that is a bit of a three-part test. 
I have tried to work with a lot of the 
new nominees in the Biden administra-
tion. I voted for a number of them, 
most of them. As a matter of fact, I in-
troduced Secretary Austin at his con-
firmation hearing. I got to know him 
many years ago when I was a marine 
and he was an Army officer, a two-star 
general. 
You know, I will say to my friends, 
colleagues, constituents back home 
who say: Hey, Senator, you know, when 
the Trump administration put forward 
their nominees, you usually had kind 
of a party-line vote. 
A lot of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle, my Democratic 
friends, would vote no, no, no, no. 
Why don’t you do that? 
Well, I don’t think it is good for the 
country; that is why I don’t do that. I 
am against some but I have been sup-
portive of many, and I am not sure the 
way in which it worked with the pre-
vious administration was best for our 
Nation. 
So 
certainly 
Secretary 
Vilsack 
passes the first two parts of that test I 
was talking about. Clearly he has the 
experience. He was the Secretary of Ag 
for 8 years under President Obama and 
Vice President Biden. Certainly he has 
views particularly with regard to farm 
country. You saw the strong vote he 
had there with regard to helping the ag 
sector. I am sure he is a patriot, of 
course. He cares about our country. 
But it was the third question—does he 
care about the people he will be im-
pacting?—that I have had some serious 
hesitation on. 
Mr. President, I will talk a little bit 
about, you know, a lot of our different 
economies throughout the country. 
Our States have been hit hard by this 
pandemic. I would say that my State’s 
economy has been hit really hard. 
When you look at what drives a lot of 
the Alaska economy: the energy sector, 
oil, gas, mining, the tourism sector, 
the fisheries, commercial fishery sec-
tor—I like to call Alaska the super-
power of seafood. Over 60 percent of all 
seafood harvested in America comes 
from the waters of the great State of 
Alaska, the most sustainable, best 
managed fishery probably in the world 
but a huge driver of our economy. 
Also, there is the issue of access to 
our lands. Sixty-six percent of Alaska 
is Federal land. We need access to help 
have a strong economy. It is an issue 
that the Presiding Officer probably 
doesn’t have to worry about, being 
from Connecticut, but in Alaska, ac-
cess to land is huge. 
In the last administration, we made a 
lot of progress on these issues for our 
economy, on oil and gas, ANWR, the 
NPRA, access to those lands, legisla-
tion by the Congress. Our tourism sec-
tor had been doing great. Our commer-
cial fishing sector had been doing 
great. We even made progress on other 
access issues, like the Tongass, some-
thing that for 25 years Democrats and 
Republicans, whether Senators from 
Alaska, whether Governors from Alas-
ka, were trying to get access to those 
lands. It is really important, and we 
were able to do that. 
So there was progress, and then the 
pandemic that has hurt everybody. It 
certainly hurt the energy sector. It 
certainly hurt, crushed the tourism 
sector. Last year, Alaska was going to 
have 1.5 million people show up in our 
State with regard to tourism, a new 
record just on the cruise ships, but 
none of them showed up because of the 
pandemic. The commercial fishing sec-
tor also has had a really rough time 
with this pandemic—markets, inter-
national markets, markets domesti-
cally. 
So I am very concerned about my 
State’s economy, about working fami-
lies, and about the average Alaskan 
who is struggling right now. The new 
policies put forward by this adminis-
tration have been shockingly negative 
as it relates to my State. One month 
in, particularly in the energy sector, 
every day we are waking up to a new 
edict saying: Men and women who 
produce 
energy 
in 
America, 
who 
produce energy in Alaska, sorry, you 
are not favored anymore. You are not 
viewed in a positive light anymore. 
It is a real, real, real concern. Hun-
dreds, if not thousands of jobs in my 
State during a recession are at risk. 
So these are some of the issues that 
I raised in my discussions with Sec-
retary Vilsack, in particular our com-
mercial fishing sector. 
In the previous administration, under 
the USDA, the Secretary of Agri-
culture helped implement a new trade

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S800 
February 23, 2021 
relief program for fishermen. Huge 
progress. Hugely important. Just the 
way the farmers were getting this kind 
of relief with regard to trade and mar-
kets that have been destroyed by the 
pandemic, the Secretary of Agriculture 
undertook a new program for the farm-
ers of the sea, for the fishermen who 
are being negatively impacted the 
same way that our farmers on the land 
were. 
This is an issue that I raised with the 
Secretary on the importance of moving 
forward, continuing that, and to be 
honest, there didn’t seem to be a lot of 
interest. I was kind of shocked, but 
there didn’t seem to be a lot of inter-
est, and I was concerned. I am con-
cerned. 
Similarly, this progress we made 
with regard to the Tongass, access to 
the largest national forest in the coun-
try that is under USDA management— 
something Alaskans have been working 
on in a bipartisan way for 25 years. 
There didn’t seem to be a lot of inter-
est from the Secretary on that either. 
So these are two issues hugely impor-
tant to my State, hugely important to 
my constituents, hugely important to 
try to get Alaska out of a really deep 
recession where a lot of families are 
worried. And I got the sense that the 
Secretary just wasn’t that interested. I 
really hope I am wrong. I really hope I 
am wrong. 
So I plan on trying to work with him. 
You know, he had a strong, very strong 
bipartisan vote, but every now and 
then, if you really think the people you 
represent are not going to be given a 
lot of attention when they need it, it 
becomes a harder vote. It becomes a 
harder vote. He obviously has got 
strong bipartisan support, but I sure 
hope that when he becomes Secretary 
of Agriculture, he cares as much about 
the farmers of the sea, where we have 
made progress on, as he does about 
farmers on the land. I didn’t see that in 
my meeting with him and I hope I am 
wrong and that is why I voted the way 
I did. 
I also voted the way I did as it re-
lates to this issue of access to the 
Tongass. Again, it is a huge issue to 
my State, a very bipartisan issue for 
my State. And, again, I hope that the 
Secretary and his team look at it as 
something that can help the economy 
of Alaska while protecting our environ-
ment, which, of course, we care about. 
But these are the reasons that I 
voted the way I did, and I hope that my 
concerns are going to be proved to be 
unfounded. I am going to continue to 
advocate for my constituents in the 
way that I think is going to be very 
important as we try and get through 
these challenging times, particularly 
the Alaska Tongass. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
today, the HELP Committee consid-
ered the nomination of Xavier Becerra, 
our former House colleague, to head 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services, and tomorrow the Finance 
Committee will take their turn at ex-
amining his record. 
It is hard to think of a nominee more 
notorious for actively seeking out ways 
to undermine religious freedom and our 
religious liberty. His contempt for 
those whose beliefs differ from his own 
is well documented, and, in many 
cases, his positions on those issues are 
far more radical than those held by the 
majority in his own party. 
He supports abortion up to the mo-
ment of birth, and, in 2003, actively op-
posed the partial-birth abortion ban. 
He cosponsored legislation that would 
have forced religious employers to pro-
vide insurance that covers the morn-
ing-after pill, in spite of their main-
stream and sincerely held religious be-
liefs. Bear in mind I said the legisla-
tion would have forced—not an op-
tion—forced religious employers to 
provide insurance that covered the 
morning-after pill. 
In fact, Mr. Becerra has been so an-
tagonistic toward fundamental con-
stitutional principles that you could 
almost forget he doesn’t have the pub-
lic health experience most Americans 
would expect the Secretary of Health 
and Human Services to possess. In fact, 
he has no meaningful experience in 
healthcare at all—zero, none, not in 
public health or large-scale logistical 
operations or in any other area that 
might be helpful as we navigate our 
way out of a global pandemic. That is 
right. He has no healthcare experience. 
This lack of experience, combined 
with his desire to destroy those who 
disagree with him, places him among 
the most unqualified and dangerous 
nominees ever to come before the Sen-
ate for consideration, and I urge my 
colleagues to join me in opposing his 
confirmation. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. President, I wish that we could 
write off this nomination as an anom-
aly, but we can’t. It is part of a pattern 
of behavior on the left that has desta-
bilized our already fragile political dis-
course and convinced the American 
people that the Biden administration 
will prioritize their radical liberal 
agenda above the rights of the people 
they were elected to serve. 
I have to tell you, I hear about this 
every single day as I am talking with 
Tennesseeans. Since the earliest days 
of the Republic, our Union has man-
aged to survive because of the people’s 
willingness to return to our founding 
principles—those first principles upon 
which we stand. 
However much that they disagreed, 
they knew that they were stronger 
united than they were divided. So they 
would come together in the public 
square. They would have robust, re-
spectful debate. They would agree to 
disagree, but they respected the fact 
that they lived in a free country, and 
they could do this without fear of per-
secution, without fear of being ostra-
cized, and without fear of losing a job. 
Today, Americans are looking for 
that same commitment to unity. Oh, 
they heard about it during the inau-
gural address. Unity—we are going to 
work for unity. But what has happened 
is a cord of panic and fear has been 
struck in their hearts as they see Exec-
utive order after Executive order and 
as they see Executive orders that are 
preferencing other countries and not 
the U.S.A. And as they hear from the 
left words that are, We are not looking 
for unity; what we are looking for is 
you to submit to our agenda, conform 
to our way of doing things. What they 
are doing is leaving no room for discus-
sion, even on issues of international 
importance. 
For decades, the various schools of 
thought represented in this Chamber 
have 
advocated 
for 
different 
ap-
proaches to foreign relations. Some re-
vere international bodies and sweeping 
multilateral agreements, and others 
approach these constructs with cau-
tion, prioritizing national sovereignty 
over surface-level diplomacy. 
When former President Trump for-
mally withdrew from the Paris climate 
accords in 2019, economists, business 
owners, 
and 
budget 
watchdogs 
all 
breathed a sigh of relief because they 
knew that adherence to the Paris cli-
mate accords would put the United 
States at a competitive disadvantage. 
This wasn’t a partisan debate, mind 
you; this was U.S.-based companies— 
U.S.-based companies that were saying 
thank you for withdrawing because ad-
hering to this, when other countries 
that are our competitors will not ad-
here, puts us at a disadvantage. 
Now, with the climate accords, by 
2035, we would have seen hundreds of 
thousands of people lose their jobs, 
household electric bills go up as much 
as 20 percent, and an aggregate GDP 
free fall of $21⁄2 trillion. That is the 
cost. That is the cost of my way or the 
highway. That is the cost of putting 
other countries and their agenda ahead 
of us, the cost of their noncompliance. 
Fast-forward to a little over a year 
later, and the Biden administration has 
thrown us back into the accords and 
back into that predicted economic free 
fall. 
This week, I worked with my col-
league Senator DAINES
to introduce 
two pieces of legislation that will hope-
fully do a little bit of damage control 
on that issue. 
The first is a bill that would prohibit 
taxpayer dollars from being used to re-
join the Paris Agreement. It makes 
sense. The reason it does is you are 
taking jobs away from U.S. employers. 
You are causing employees to become 
former employees or the unemployed. 
So it makes sense. If you want to do 
this, don’t use taxpayer dollars. Don’t 
make people pay for things that are 
going to take away their jobs. 
The second is a resolution that would 
call on President Biden to submit the 
Paris Agreement to the Senate for ap-
proval. It makes sense. Where are trea-
ties to come? Here. If you want unity,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S801 
February 23, 2021 
send things to the Senate. If you are 
proud of the step you are taking, send 
it to the Senate. Let there be a vote of 
the people’s representatives. Let there 
be discussion. Do we fear discussion? 
Do we fear debate? Are we so given to 
the cancel culture that we just say it is 
our way or the highway? 
I would note that submitting these 
types of agreements for consideration 
is a bare minimum standard set out in 
the Constitution, and there is no legiti-
mate reason anyone in this Chamber 
should object to that. They should wel-
come respectful, robust debate. 
I think we can all agree that this 
oversight duty is an important one, 
and I would ask my colleagues to join 
me in letting the administration know 
we are not going to abandon it simply 
because it would make things more 
convenient for them. 
Freedom and preserving freedom are 
not always convenient. It takes a lot of 
hard work. It takes this body doing its 
job. It doesn’t take ‘‘my way or the 
highway’’ Executive orders coming out 
of the White House. 
On 
Inauguration 
Day, 
President 
Biden promised unity: all for it, wanted 
to see it, going to work for it—nice 
words. But so far he has done nothing 
but hide behind those Executive orders 
and force through policies that even 
members of his own party object to. 
In Tennessee, I have talked to many 
who have, for most of their lives, been 
Democrats, and they are stunned—in-
deed, they are very concerned—about 
this authoritarian approach to running 
the country. Sign an Executive order 
and be done with it, hearing that the 
Speaker of the House has a few people 
who can vote proxy for people, seeing 
all this fencing around the Capitol 
causes Tennesseans to say: What in the 
world is going on up there? This is not 
how we are supposed to act. 
And I will tell you, to my friends 
across the aisle, one day this tactic is 
going to backfire on the millions of 
Americans who are standing up. They 
are contacting us. They are speaking 
out. They are having buyer’s remorse. 
It will be something that will backfire 
because this is not the way we should 
be running our country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

The Senator from Texas. 
TEXAS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, my 
State is no stranger to severe weather. 
In the past few years, we have experi-
enced the devastation of major hurri-
canes, tropical storms, and tornadoes. 
But last week brought something en-
tirely new in the form of extreme 
weather—winter 
storms, 
prolonged 
subfreezing temperatures, and treach-
erous roadways across the entire State. 
And unlike, for example, the State of 
Massachusetts, where that may not be 
entirely uncommon, we are not used to 
that subzero freezing weather. 
Our State was not prepared, I think 
it is clear to say, correct to say, for 
these low temperatures or the dev-
astating impact they would have on 
our critical infrastructure. 
Frozen natural gas wells and wind 
turbines, among other issues, led to 
widespread power outages, and millions 
of Texans were left without a way to 
keep their family warm throughout the 
historic low temperatures. 
Compounding matters even further, 
some 12 million Texans faced water dis-
ruptions due to the lasting power out-
ages and frozen or broken water lines. 
Cities across the State issued boil no-
tices, and folks whose taps are still dry 
resorted to boiling snow as their only 
option for drinking water or perhaps 
even to flush the toilets. 
The weather created incredibly dan-
gerous conditions for many across the 
State, especially our most vulnerable 
citizens. We know of nearly 80 Texans 
who have died due to this extreme 
weather, and that number is likely to 
climb in the days ahead. 
These 
widespread 
outages 
will 
prompt a necessary investigation into 
the high level of generation failures, as 
well as the overall security and reli-
ability of our energy grid. We have a 
lot of work to do to ensure that these 
deadly 
mass 
outages 
never 
occur 
again—no matter what Mother Nature 
sends our way. There is no reason for 
millions of people in one of the most 
energy-rich places in the world to be 
left without reliable power. 
Senator CRUZ and I sent a letter to 
President Biden urging him to grant 
Governor Abbott’s request for an emer-
gency disaster declaration, and I appre-
ciate the President’s quick action to 
ensure our State could receive the full 
range of Federal resources to respond 
to this crisis. 
I also worked with the Governor and 
the Department of Energy to secure an 
emergency order allowing Texas power 
generators to increase production, and 
I appreciate the fact that that, too, 
was quickly approved. 
In times of crisis there is no red team 
and no blue team, and I want to thank 
every person who has supported the re-
sponse to this crisis so far, whether 
they are Texans or not. I know more 
will be needed in the days and weeks 
ahead, and I want to assure the folks 
back home that I am listening, I am 
working, and I am here to help any 
way that I can. And I know that I 
speak for the entire Texas delegation. 
I know there are still many without 
water and electricity, and I want to as-
sure them that you are the Nation’s 
priority. But in the face of hardship— 
and, as I started my remarks, we have 
been through a lot over the last few 
years—I am always in awe of the way 
Texans show up and help one another— 
neighbors helping neighbors. We have 
seen countless inspiring stories in the 
past, and this disaster is no exception. 
There are stories like that of Ken 
Everly, an 82-year-old Air Force vet-
eran from Grande Prairie. Mr. Everly is 
on hospice care. He relies on a breath-
ing machine to keep him alive and a 
special air mattress that prevents bed-
sores to keep him comfortable. When 
his home lost power, Mr. Everly was in 
serious danger of losing his life. The 
breathing machine cut off, and the air 
mattress deflated, leaving him strug-
gling to breathe on an iron bed frame. 
His son-in-law Nate pleaded for help 
on Facebook, and within hours help ar-
rived. Nate said: ‘‘I don’t know where 
it came from, but a generator showed 
up.’’ Thanks to the generosity of a 
stranger, Mr. Everly once again had his 
breathing machine operating, a com-
fortable mattress, and heat in his 
home. 
The best part of that story, though, 
is that it is not unique. In ways big and 
small, we have seen other examples of 
neighbors going out of their way to 
help one another. 
Jeep drivers in North Texas teamed 
up to offer free rides to and from work 
for healthcare workers and first re-
sponders. Restaurants across the State 
offered free food to folks without 
power. And countless Texans shared of-
fers on social media to deliver warm 
meals, bottles of water, and a range of 
other supplies to those in need. 
One of the big issues that folks back 
home have faced is a lack of safe drink-
ing water, a need Houston-area brew-
eries stepped up to fill. The breweries 
already had a supply of clean water on 
hand for their brewing process, and 
they spread the word to their commu-
nities: Come by with a container, and 
we will give you some clean water. 
These breweries collectively donated 
thousands of gallons of clean drinking 
water completely free of charge. 
Across Texas, churches, schools, non-
profits, community centers, and local 
organizations opened their doors as 
warming centers. One of those warming 
centers is operated by Houston’s most 
beloved furniture store owner, known 
as ‘‘Mattress Mack.’’ Dating back to 
Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Mack has 
opened the doors of his stores to pro-
vide food and shelter to those impacted 
by extreme weather. Over the last sev-
eral days, Gallery Furniture, his fur-
niture business, has been open around 
the clock for Texans to stay as long as 
they need, whether it is an hour for a 
hot meal or for several nights. 
These stories warm my heart, and 
they are a reminder of the strength and 
generosity of Texans and an encour-
aging reminder of the endless amount 
of goodwill that still exists in the 
world. The outpouring of love exempli-
fies a quote that I heard some time ago

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S802 
February 23, 2021 
from a Texas county commissioner 
after one particularly terrible accident 
in West Texas. He said: ‘‘Being a Texan 
doesn’t describe where you’re from; it 
describes who your family is.’’ 
Well, I am grateful to those countless 
Texans who supported our commu-
nities across our State during this cri-
sis. First responders and 9/11 dis-
patchers have gone above and beyond 
the call of duty. Healthcare workers, 
fighting a pandemic already, have now 
had to deal with power outages, staff-
ing shortages, and water disruptions 
because of the storm. Utility workers 
and energy providers have worked, of 
course, around the clock in dangerous 
conditions to restore power and safe 
drinking water to Texans. And millions 
of unsung heroes have helped their fel-
low Texans get through these dark 
days: checking on an elderly neighbor, 
helping drivers whose vehicles were 
stuck in the snow, welcoming people 
into their homes, donating supplies to 
those in need, and so much more. 
I would like to offer a special thank- 
you to members of my staff in Texas 
who continued working throughout 
this crisis while battling power and 
water outages themselves. Because of 
their diligence, my office has con-
nected Texans in need with local re-
sources to provide shelter, food, and 
water. We have stayed in contact with 
State and local emergency officials 
about the ongoing crisis, and we have 
assisted local critical care facilities in 
need, including a large COVID testing 
lab in Austin. We helped connect it 
with local resources to receive addi-
tional fuel for its generators so mil-
lions of dollars of COVID testing mate-
rials and pathology tests would not go 
to waste. 
The past year has dealt us a tough 
hand. I would say that is true for 
America. But I have faith that we will 
come through this crisis just as we al-
ways have before—together. I continue 
to say a prayer for those impacted by 
the storm and assure my constituents, 
my friends and neighbors in Texas, 
that I will continue to do everything in 
my power to help our State recover and 
rebuild. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. President, on another matter, 
the Senate will continue to evaluate 
President Biden’s nominees for critical 
positions throughout the Federal Gov-
ernment. Yesterday and today the Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee, on which I 
am privileged to serve, heard from 
Judge Merrick Garland and others who 
have testified in connection with his 
nomination. Of course, Judge Garland 
has been nominated to serve as the 
next Attorney General. 
I have said before publicly that Judge 
Garland is highly qualified for the job. 
He is a widely respected judge with the 
right experience and credentials and 
the right temperament to lead the De-
partment and manage its many critical 
missions. I was struck by Judge Gar-
land’s humility and his humanity. I be-
lieve he is a good man and a good per-
son for this job. 
But I have to say that I am under no 
illusion that he is going to be able to 
stop the policies of this administra-
tion, some of which I am not going to 
agree with, some of which I will fight 
and try to oppose. 
I am encouraged by Judge Garland’s 
pledge to keep politics out of the Jus-
tice Department, which is a significant 
improvement over the past. I know our 
Democratic colleagues like to act like 
all of the concerns that we had about 
the Justice Department were just dur-
ing the Trump administration, and so I 
did have to remind them that the 
Obama administration Justice Depart-
ment had a few problems of their own. 
Nevertheless, Judge Garland, while 
we don’t agree on everything—and it is 
true of other nominees of the President 
that I have supported—I don’t think 
that is the standard by which I should 
provide my consent as a Senator. But I 
do believe he has the right experience 
and character to serve. 
Unfortunately I can’t offer that sort 
of full-throated, enthusiastic support 
for the President’s nominee to lead the 
Office of Management and Budget. The 
announcement of Neera Tanden’s nomi-
nation managed to do something in-
creasingly rare these days, and that is 
to put conservatives and progressives 
on the same side of the argument. 
Ms. Tanden has repeatedly made 
combative, insulting, and flat-out false 
statements against both Democrats 
and Republicans. She has referred to 
Republicans as ‘‘evil’’ and ‘‘monsters.’’ 
She has villainized Leader MCCONNELL 
and called Senator COTTON a ‘‘fraud’’ 
and Senator COLLINS ‘‘the worst.’’ She 
has gone toe-to-toe with Senator BER-
NIE SANDERS, who accused her and her 
progressive organization of ‘‘maligning 
[his] staff and supporters and belittling 
progressive ideas.’’ 
She has even peddled a completely 
false conspiracy theory that Russian 
hackers changed votes in 2016 to help 
President Trump. In short, Ms. Tanden 
has consistently made comments that 
stand in stark contrast to the Biden 
administration’s 
top 
goals 
of 
pro-
moting the facts and unifying our 
country. 
Last Friday, the Senator from West 
Virginia, Senator MANCHIN, announced 
he will not support Ms. Tanden’s nomi-
nation because of her inflammatory 
rhetoric that would, he said, have a 
‘‘toxic and detrimental impact’’ on 
Congress’s relationship with the Office 
of Management and Budget. Yesterday, 
Senator COLLINS, who is known for 
working across party lines, said she 
won’t support this toxic nomination. 
I agree with our friends from West 
Virginia and Maine, and I think these 
announcements create a nearly impos-
sible path to confirmation for this 
nominee. In order to be confirmed, she 
would need the support of at least one 
Republican Senator—and more, if there 
are additional Democrats who share 
the views of Senator MANCHIN. 
Based on her well-documented his-
tory of divisive and misleading com-
ments, I think this nominee faces long 
odds, to say the least. My friendly ad-
vice to President Biden is to withdraw 
Neera Tanden’s nomination and select 
someone who, at the very least, has not 
promoted wild conspiracy theories and 
openly bashed people on both sides of 
the aisle that she happens to disagree 
with. 
If President Biden is truly interested 
in unifying our country, I would expect 
him to select an OMB nominee with 
mainstream views and a proven ability 
to work respectfully with those who 
have different views from his or hers. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, ‘‘More 
deaths in 2020 than in any year in over 
a decade.’’ That is what the Chicago 
Sun-Times headline read last week. 
But this wasn’t a story about the 
coronavirus. It was an article about 
suicide. There were more suicides by 
Black residents of Cook County, IL, in 
2020 than over the past 10 years. All 
told, 437 of our neighbors in Cook 
County took their lives. 
At the same time, more than 600 
Cook County residents died from opioid 
overdoses between January and June 
2020 alone—double the number from a 
year earlier. 
While the human suffering of COVID– 
19 has captured our attention, as it 
should, two other deadly epidemics in 
America still rage on: opioids and the 
mental health crises. 
Even before the virus took its toll, 
we had been in the midst of the worst 
drug overdose crisis in our Nation’s 
history, and we are witnessing sky-
rocketing rates of suicide. But COVID– 
19 has deepened these epidemics, which 
sadly feed on isolation and despair. 
With the convergence of coronavirus 
emergencies, we are failing those most 
vulnerable to addiction and mental 
health 
challenges. 
And 
like 
the 
coronavirus, mental health challenges 
and addiction can occur with any one 
of us in any family, in any neighbor-
hood. 
Earlier this month, the New York 
Times profiled three American mothers 
on the brink of chaos and crisis. The 
story chronicled the relentless stress 
and burdens of working mothers over 
11 months of this panic—struggling to 
balance remote learning duties for 
their kids, keeping their families safe 
and healthy, keeping food on the table, 
paying the bills, and knowing that 
every morning they have to get up and 
do it all over again that day and the 
next day, with no end in sight. 
One of the mothers described the 
struggle this way. She said:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S803 
February 23, 2021 
We are holding together with the same 
tape that we have been using since March. 
The tape is barely working, but we are still 
here. 
She speaks for millions of mothers. 
Experts 
and 
advocates 
warn 
that 
COVID–19 has created a perfect storm 
for a surge in mental health and addic-
tion. Isolation, fear, grief, financial 
hardship all come together and can feel 
overwhelming. 
At the same time, the pandemic has 
made it more difficult for many to con-
nect with lifesaving care and social 
services. Peer recovery meetings have 
moved to Zoom; routine human con-
nections have been lost; and treatment 
access restricted. It is trauma on the 
brain and body, and it fuels the alarm-
ing spikes in addiction, overdose, and 
suicide. 
Last week, I spoke with advocates 
from the Illinois Society of Addiction 
Medicine and a group called Live4Lali, 
a community organization focusing on 
recovery and harm reduction. These 
community leaders provide lifesaving 
care through recovery programs, street 
medicine, handing out fentanyl test 
strips, and distributing the overdose 
reversal drug naloxone. 
The statistics they shared with me 
on Chicago-area opioid overdose deaths 
during this pandemic are devastating. 
In the last year, opioid deaths have 
soared: 23 percent in Lake County, 37 
percent in DuPage County, and a stag-
gering 64 percent in McHenry County. 
Every morning, we look at the post-
ing on CNN of the deaths in America 
from the coronavirus. Heartbreaking. 
Over a half a million people dead. But 
we are not posting the increase in 
deaths from opioids during the same 
periods of time. 
Addiction is an equal opportunity 
killer. But like COVID, the opioid epi-
demic strikes communities of color 
with a disproportionate ferocity. In 
Chicago, Black residents are dying 
from overdoses at seven times the rate 
of White residents. 
Let me tell you about one person who 
sought help from Live4Lali, a woman 
named Tonya, who recently moved to 
Lake County. When the pandemic hit, 
the recovery meetings for her sub-
stance abuse disorder shifted to Zoom, 
and the weight of the challenge left 
Tonya to struggle. She knew her recov-
ery was in danger. 
For days, she called for treatment 
programs, but no beds were available. 
Desperate, she called 9–1-1 emergency 
care at a hospital. Tonya was evalu-
ated and sent home. Feeling hopeless 
and ashamed, she decided to take all of 
the pills in her mother’s bottle of blood 
thinner medication. She was taken un-
conscious back to the hospital and pro-
nounced dead. 
Too many like Tonya are being left 
alone in their darkest hours. And it is 
not just in the Chicagoland area. Ac-
cording to the CDC, emergency room 
visits for suicides and overdoses spiked 
nationally once the pandemic gripped 
our Nation. By May, the country had 
experienced its largest 1-month spike 
in overdose deaths. 
A new survey conducted by the CDC 
also found that one in four young 
adults had considered suicide in the 
past month—one in four. This should 
set off alarm bells in every direction. 
There is no vaccine against despair 
and addiction, but there are programs 
and treatments and strategies. We 
must give communities and healthcare 
providers the support they need now 
more than ever. 
The American Rescue Plan proposed 
by President Biden provides those re-
sources. The House is expected to vote 
on the President’s plan this week. The 
Senate has to show the same sense of 
commitment and urgency. 
The American Rescue Plan includes 
nearly $4 billion in addiction and men-
tal health treatments for healthcare 
providers. It has $7.6 billion for Com-
munity Health Centers to address be-
havioral health disparities. 
It includes a plan that I crafted with 
Senator RUBIO to increase the avail-
ability of healthcare, including behav-
ioral health treatment, by providing 
scholarship and loan repayment awards 
to build the pipeline of health profes-
sionals who agree to serve in needy 
areas. 
Special efforts were made to recruit 
more people of color into these healing 
professions, which can help tackle dis-
parities. The President’s Rescue Plan 
also expands health insurance coverage 
through the Affordable Care Act and 
Medicaid. This money will save lives. 
America has arrived at the heart-
breaking milestone: half a million 
COVID deaths. As we work to expand 
vaccinations and end COVID–19, we 
cannot ignore the lethal epidemics of 
addiction and suicide, which are soar-
ing in the cold shadows of this pan-
demic. 
Every day we wait, more people, in 
every ZIP code in America, struggle. 
More families grieve. More lives are 
lost. We need to get help to the people 
who need it now. 
Mr. President, you and I are veterans 
of Congress. We have been doing this 
for a few years. Some things happen 
that give you hope. A year ago, we 
passed the CARES Act. It was nothing 
short of amazing, but we did it at a mo-
ment of real fear. We just saw this pan-
demic starting to rise. We saw busi-
nesses starting to close. We moved 
quickly, decisively, with the biggest 
spending bill in the history of the 
United States, more than $2 trillion for 
the CARES Act. And it passed this 
Senate, in this hopelessly politically 
divided America, by a vote of 96 to 0— 
the CARES Act. 
Well, it took us a while to come back 
with a reprise or an answer to what 
happened after it passed. The pandemic 
raged through America. The economy 
floundered. Millions were unemployed. 
And in December, just a few short 
weeks ago, we passed the second bill, 
the December relief bill, $900 billion, a 
sizable investment. And we character-
ized it as an emergency response, a spe-
cial response, a temporary fix to go 
into the system and pay for unemploy-
ment benefits and many other things— 
$900 billion, a substantial sum of 
money. And it passed here with 92 af-
firmative votes: 96 on the first, 92 on 
the second. Still, amazing rollcalls in a 
politically divided Chamber like the 
U.S. Senate. 
Then came the new President. I 
won’t put in all the other chapters that 
occurred that seemed like an endless 
novel, but it was serious. But this 
President came in—President Biden 
came in and faced the reality of what 
we have in America today. Last night, 
he did it as well. He and the First 
Lady, as well as Vice President HARRIS 
and the First Gentleman, stood in si-
lent prayer for the half million Ameri-
cans we have lost. Not ignoring the 
problem but facing the problem, Presi-
dent Biden said: Come together, Amer-
ica, unite, and let’s, with common pur-
pose, address this pandemic and the 
problems it has created. 
It is a much different approach in his 
Presidency. To me, it is honest. It is 
refreshing. It is hopeful. But he has 
turned to this Congress and asked this 
Congress to pass the American Rescue 
Plan. It is a measure that costs $1.9 
trillion. It is huge. It has to be. Consid-
ering what we face in America, we need 
nothing less. Maybe we will not need to 
spend every penny. I hope we don’t. But 
we better be prepared to pay for it if we 
are—money for more vaccine and dis-
tribution of that vaccine; money for 
cash payments to families who need a 
helping hand; money for unemploy-
ment benefits that are supposed to run 
out in just 2 short weeks, on March 14; 
money for rental assistance for people 
who are facing eviction; money for 
schools so that they can prepare the 
classrooms for teachers and students to 
return safely. The list goes on, and it is 
an important and valuable list and, as 
I mentioned, money for mental health 
treatment and addiction treatment 
that is still a very real challenge in 
America today. 
The difference is this. In the CARES 
Act, with 96 to 0, and in the December 
bill, which we passed with 92 affirma-
tive votes, those were under the Trump 
administration, and there was a strong 
bipartisan support of that legislation, 
as you can tell from the numbers. The 
rollcalls tell the story. 
Now comes President Biden, asking 
for another rescue package for Amer-
ica, which is still languishing, fighting 
this pandemic. We don’t hear the same 
calls for bipartisanship or at least we 
don’t hear the same responses to the 
calls for bipartisanship. Why? What is 
different? The only thing different is 
we have a different President. 
When it was a Republican President 
named Trump, Democrats, like myself 
and virtually all others, stood by and 
said: Let’s do it together. We can dis-
agree on everything under the Sun, but 
when it comes to this pandemic and 
what it is doing to America, we are

going to stand together, both political 
parties. But when President Biden 
makes the same proposal, we don’t 
hear the chorus of support from across 
the aisle that we once did. That is dis-
heartening to me. 
The problem is real. Sure, there are 
ways any legislator could perhaps 
write the bill better, but let’s get that 
done, and let’s respond, as the Presi-
dent has called, with the resources 
America needs to get back on its feet. 
That is where we are today. 
The House is going to pass their 
measure this week. And in the next 
couple of weeks, the Senate will get its 
chance. It is time for us to stand up 
and do something. The American peo-
ple didn’t send us here to squabble or 
to find reasons for differences but rath-
er to come together in a bipartisan way 
and solve the problems facing this 
country. 
The President believes, and I share 
that belief, that a united America with 
the resources can conquer this chal-
lenge as it has so many in the past. We 
can do that, but we need to do it by 
coming together. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BUDGET 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to talk about the $1.9 
trillion spending bill that is under con-
sideration before this Congress. 
As President Biden has said repeat-
edly, if you want to know someone’s 
values, look at one’s budget. Well, that 
is what we are doing, because I believe 
that President Biden is right. If the 
American people want to know the 
Democrats’ values, all we need to do is 
look at the budget. The Democrats are 
making clear what they stand for. It 
seems that they are standing for teach-
ers unions and job-crushing mandates 
on American businesses. The Repub-
licans stand for ending the pandemic, 
for getting people back to work, and 
for getting kids back to school. The 
differences could not be more clear. 
The Senate has debated the Demo-
cratic budget—we did it a couple of 
weeks ago—and we voted on many 
amendments. Every Senator had a 
chance to propose and make some 
changes to the budget that was brought 
forth. Every single Senator went on 
record on a number of amendments and 
items related to the budget for the 
United States of America. Now we 
know where we stand. 
I introduced an amendment that had 
to do with energy production in my 
home State of Wyoming. Wyoming 
feels like we are being targeted by 
President Biden because of his ban on 
oil and gas exploration on public lands. 
You know, those projects are a major 
source of jobs in my home State. They 
fund 
our 
schools, 
our 
roads, 
our 
bridges, our teachers, our students, and 
additional services for working fami-
lies. 
My amendment would provide fund-
ing for our public schools—schools that 
have been punished by this ban an-
nounced by President Biden. That 
amendment on this floor received 98 
votes out of 100. It got the support of 
every single Democrat in the U.S. Sen-
ate, so I am grateful for my colleagues 
for that support of the amendment to 
protect our students and our schools 
and our teachers. Yet I have to say 
that by voting for my amendment, the 
98 people in this body—specifically the 
Democrats—are admitting that there is 
a problem created by the actions of 
President Biden. They are admitting 
that President Biden’s Executive order, 
signed on the day he was inaugurated, 
is hurting families all across the coun-
try. 
So, to my Democratic colleagues, 
keep working with us to address the 
needs of the Nation. Stand up to these 
overreaching, radical proposals by the 
Biden administration. On issue after 
issue, that really has not yet happened. 
Many of my Republican colleagues, 
on this side of the aisle, offered good 
ideas that the Democrats refused to 
support. Senator BLUNT introduced an 
amendment 
to 
reopen 
America’s 
schools. Now, that is an idea that 
science has supported for months. 
Every Republican voted yes. Every 
Democrat voted no. I have yet to hear 
one of my Democratic colleagues make 
the case for keeping the schools closed; 
yet that is how they voted when it 
came to the budget. Just like President 
Biden, they are trying to have it both 
ways. They say they want the schools 
open; yet they don’t do what needs to 
be done. 
President Biden has claimed time 
and again he wants the schools open; 
yet his Chief of Staff says there is no 
money to reopen them. Well, that is 
absolutely wrong. Last year, President 
Trump signed into law $68 billion for 
our 
schools, 
specifically 
tied 
to 
coronavirus relief. Only $5 billion of 
that money has been spent. That leaves 
$63 billion still available. In the Demo-
crats’ budget being proposed right now, 
almost all of the money for schools is 
not even for this year. Ninety-five per-
cent of the money is for the years 2022 
through 2028—after the coronavirus 
will be behind us. 
The Democrats are still putting the 
teachers unions ahead of students. Joe 
Biden has surrendered to the teachers 
unions. They have written to him a 
ransom note, and he has been happy to 
pay it. Teachers are putting politics 
ahead of science, and so is this admin-
istration. 
I joined with Senator SCOTT of South 
Carolina to introduce another amend-
ment to the budget bill of the Demo-
crats. It said that if we give money to 
States—and there is a lot of money in 
this proposal to give money to States: 
New York, Illinois, California—that 
the States have to give the American 
people 
accurate 
data 
about 
the 
coronavirus and specifically in their 
nursing homes. People want to know 
the answers about the coronavirus and 
the impact on nursing homes because 
there is a real problem there. 
New York now admits that it gave 
the public false information. The num-
bers were not just wrong; they were 
nearly off by half. The Governor’s top 
aide in New York said they were afraid 
of being investigated by Bill Barr’s 
Justice Department. They were afraid 
that President Trump would make it a 
‘‘political football.’’ 
Don’t the people of New York have a 
right to know the truth about what is 
happening in the nursing homes in that 
State when people are losing parents 
and grandparents and when people with 
the coronavirus are being moved from 
the hospital back into those nursing 
homes to spread the disease to others? 
The Governor of New York wanted to 
cover it up. People would agree it 
sounds like a coverup, so Senator 
SCOTT and I came to the floor and said 
that it was unacceptable, that States 
have to tell the truth. Every Repub-
lican voted yes. Every single Democrat 
voted no. Every Senate Democrat 
voted to protect Governor Cuomo in-
stead of telling the truth to the Amer-
ican people. 
During the budget debate, there were 
some good ideas that some Democrats 
supported. Yet, even then, in the wee 
hours of the morning, a number of the 
Democrats who had voted for those 
amendments flip-flopped on a later 
vote to head the other way. What they 
did is they had another amendment to 
strip out the amendments that had 
been put on. 
For example, Senator YOUNG of Indi-
ana had an amendment so that money 
in the bill would go to American citi-
zens, not to illegal immigrants. Eight 
Democrats voted in agreement with 
that. They said you shouldn’t be send-
ing checks to illegal immigrants. A few 
hours later, they voted to strip it out. 
So every Democrat in the Senate is 
now on the record. Every Democrat in 
the Senate has voted in favor of taking 
people’s hard-earned taxpayer dollars 
and giving it to people who are in the 
country illegally. 
Senator 
DAINES
brought 
up 
an 
amendment on a different topic. He 
said we should proceed with the Key-
stone Pipeline. Remember, President 
Biden, with an Executive order on the 
day he was inaugurated, stopped work 
on the Keystone Pipeline, resulting in 
the loss of hundreds and hundreds and 
likely 
thousands 
of 
jobs. 
Several 
Democrats voted and said we should re-
open the pipeline. Let it go. Let it 
work. A few hours later, in the wee 
hours of the morning, they reversed 
themselves and voted to strip it out. 
Senator BRAUN of Indiana introduced 
an amendment to prevent President 
Biden from banning fracking. Now, this

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S805 
February 23, 2021 
is something that President Biden 
promised to do during the campaign. Of 
course, that would end millions of jobs 
across America, and it would put us at 
a disadvantage from the standpoint of 
energy. Seven Democrats voted with 
Senator BRAUN
to protect American 
jobs. Hours later, they flip-flopped and 
took it out of the bill. 
The Democrats keep trying to have it 
both ways. They want to look like 
moderates, pretend to be moderates, 
while still getting their leftwing spend-
ing bill through. They are not playing 
it straight with the American people. 
It is not going to work. The people in 
their States aren’t going to be fooled. 
They are going to remember the votes, 
and they will certainly be reminded of 
those votes in the future. 
So we have talked about what the 
Senate Democrats blocked. Now let’s 
take a look at some of the things the 
Senate Democrats support. 
The bill includes a mandate from 
Washington, DC, to double the min-
imum wage. It has nothing to do with 
the coronavirus. In fact, it would actu-
ally make things worse. The Congres-
sional Budget Office took a look at this 
as to what the impact would be on the 
economy, and it said that 1.4 million 
people who have jobs right now would 
lose their jobs if the Federal Govern-
ment were to come in with a mandate 
to double the minimum wage. It is not 
a stimulus. 
According to one report, the new 
Washington mandate would also raise 
the cost of childcare by about 21 per-
cent. How is that going to work for 
hard-working families who are trying 
to 
get 
back 
to 
work 
with 
the 
coronavirus and need daycare for their 
children? With schools closed in so 
many locations across the country, 
that is the last thing that working 
families need—an increase in the cost 
of providing care for their children. 
The big Democratic spending bill 
also includes a $350 billion bailout for 
States and local governments. The 
money is especially targeted to States 
that have stayed closed the longest. 
This is money rewarding big cities and 
States like California and New York 
and Illinois that have had financial 
trouble due to financial mismanage-
ment for many, many years. It has 
nothing to do with the coronavirus. 
Those States were in trouble long be-
fore the coronavirus made it to our 
shores. 
Multiple studies show that State tax 
revenues are actually up in many 
States across the country. In some 
States, they fell, but on average, 
States are continuing to do quite well. 
Most States are expecting more tax 
revenues this year than they had be-
fore the pandemic. If a State needs a 
bailout, it is not because of the 
coronavirus; it is because of years and 
years of mismanagement, and this bill 
rewards mismanagement. 
Those are the priorities of the Senate 
Democrats, not jobs and not opening 
our schools. The priorities are man-
dates and bailouts. 
Only about $1 of every $20 in this en-
tire proposal goes for public health, but 
it does contain $4.5 billion for Senator 
SCHUMER’s New York City Subway sys-
tem. It does provide $112 million for a 
subway system in Silicon Valley. It 
does provide $270 million in funding for 
the arts and humanities and $12 billion 
in foreign aid. This is supposed to be 
for the coronavirus in America, here. 
So what does $1.9 trillion get for you? 
I am asked at home in Wyoming. What 
does it do for people at home—yes, the 
American taxpayer? Not much when 
you look at this Democratic shopping 
list. It is a wish list of liberal prior-
ities. 
As President Biden says, if you want 
to know somebody’s values, look at 
one’s budget. We have just done that. If 
the American people want to see the 
contrast 
between 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats, they should look no further 
than this bill. The Republicans are of-
fering the American people jobs, a vac-
cine, and opening our schools. The 
Democrats are offering excuses and the 
liberal wish list. 
We still have time to fix the final 
bill, so I would urge my Democratic 
colleagues to join with us. Work with 
the Republicans for real coronavirus 
relief. Help our small communities and 
small businesses keep their doors open. 
Get our kids back in school. Target the 
funding to the American citizens who 
need it the most. We have done five bi-
partisan coronavirus bills. A sixth 
coronavirus relief bill should be done 
in a bipartisan way as well. That is 
what the American people, with a 50–50 
Senate, are asking us to do. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
TRIBUTE TO GLYNIS JOHNS, JUSTAN PARKER 
FIELDS, AND DR. ALA STANFORD 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to-
night and, again, it is my privilege to 
come before the Senate, as I have since 
my very first year here, to celebrate 
Black History Month in a particular 
way by paying tribute to a number of 
Pennsylvanians. 
I am honored again to have the op-
portunity to highlight the extraor-
dinary leadership of Pennsylvanians 
who dedicate their lives to improving 
their communities and who wake up 
every day to rededicate themselves to 
that effort. This year I am grateful to 
be able to recognize three honorees— 
Glynis Johns, Justan Parker Fields, 
and Dr. Ala Stanford—and to recognize 
each of these individuals in a very per-
sonal way in terms of their work in 
their communities in Pennsylvania. 
Each of them are having a remarkable 
impact in their communities. 
The theme of this year’s recognition 
is ‘‘Bending the Arc: Celebrating Cata-
lysts for Change.’’ We know that Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., spoke of 
‘‘bending the arc’’ on many occasions, 
but, most notably, in his address at the 
conclusion of the Selma to Mont-
gomery March in 1965 in March of that 
year, when he said: 
The arc of the moral universe is long, but 
it bends towards justice. 
Our late and beloved colleague here 
in the Congress, Congressman John 
Lewis, carried that same spirit with 
him. He lived it, and he believed that 
we will get there someday, get there to 
a better day for justice. Congressman 
Lewis also said: 
We will redeem the soul of America, and in 
doing so, we will inspire people around the 
world to stand up and speak out. 
We know that justice, of course, 
takes hard work. In the face of adver-
sity and exhaustion, to be the voice 
that stands up and speaks out, as John 
Lewis suggested, is not a decision that 
a person makes once and then just fol-
lows a well-worn path. It, of course, re-
quires perseverance. It requires hope 
and faith. 
Dr. King reminds us that justice is 
the—to use his words—is the ‘‘fierce 
urgency of now.’’ Dr. King and Con-
gressman Lewis understood that while 
the arc of the moral universe does bend 
toward justice, this is not something to 
which one can attach themselves a 
path that you can follow passively. To 
bend that arc toward justice requires 
strenuous exertion that often gets you 
enemies before it makes you any 
friends. It does not bend on its own but 
bends only—only—under the weight of 
acts of courage and the hard work of 
those who have committed themselves 
to the struggle for justice and equality. 
President Obama, as well, in his work 
every day of his Presidency, did work 
to bend the arc on issues of racial, eco-
nomic, and global justice, and he con-
tinues to do so in his years as a former 
President. Congressman Lewis not only 
gave all of us words to live by and in-
spiration, he also gave all of himself to 
the cause of justice. But his example, 
the example of John Lewis, still serves 
as an inspiration for the next genera-
tion of leaders. It is why Dr. King spent 
his entire life fighting for racial equal-
ity, voting rights, nonviolence, and the 
rights of the poor. King’s work for the 
lives of others cost him his very own. 
We should honor his sacrifice daily and 
not 
simply 
during 
Black 
History 
Month. 
But we know that behind every man 
and every woman leading the fight for 
justice stands a multitude. Behind Dr. 
King, millions labored and labor still 
for civil rights and voting rights. We 
saw that this summer when millions of 
Americans across our Nation took to 
the streets to condemn the mistreat-
ment of Black Americans at the hands 
of law enforcement. And we saw it just 
last month when African Americans 
voted in extraordinary numbers in the 
Georgia special elections to send Rev.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S806 
February 23, 2021 
RAPHAEL WARNOCK and JON OSSOFF to 
the U.S. Senate. 
For every leader who rises to na-
tional prominence—Dr. King, President 
Obama, 
Congressman 
Lewis, 
Vice 
President 
KAMALA
HARRIS, 
Stacey 
Abrams, just to mention a few—there 
are leaders and communities across the 
country who are themselves doing 
transformational work, who are doing 
their part to bend the arc of the moral 
universe, and to bend it, of course, to-
ward justice. 
Today, it is my privilege to highlight 
three such leaders from Pennsylvania. 
I will start in my home region and in 
my hometown, Scranton, PA, Glynis 
Johns. 
First, I speak as a son of Scranton, 
the city I was born in and still live in. 
I was proud to honor a daughter—or I 
should say am proud, tonight, to honor 
a daughter from Scranton, Glynis 
Johns. Glynis is the founder and CEO 
of the Black Scranton Project, a non-
profit organization, a local heritage 
initiative and public history venture 
dedicated to archiving and celebrating 
the Black history of our hometown 
that too often has been overlooked and 
has been obscured. She received a B.A. 
and an M.A. in sociology from St. 
John’s University and is currently a 
doctoral student at Rutgers. 
Glynis did not always plan to become 
a local historian, but like so many, she 
became one because she saw a need, 
and she responded to it. While working 
on a research project during her mas-
ter’s program at St. John’s, the stories 
called to her, and she knew she needed 
to share these stories. For her project, 
she investigated why the Black com-
munity is overlooked and seen as tran-
sient in a city like Scranton. She kept 
uncovering stories through old news-
paper archives and historical memora-
bilia, and she knew she had to return 
to her hometown to share these stories 
and rebuild a community. 
She is proud to shift local perspec-
tives on culture, inclusion, representa-
tion, and history within the city of 
Scranton. As a native and as a resi-
dent, I am grateful for her work to un-
cover these stories for our entire com-
munity to learn and to enjoy. 
I first met Glynis just last year, 2020. 
It was the Juneteenth Jubilee, which 
she organized in our hometown, along 
with her fellow Black Scranton board 
members. It was both a celebration and 
a call to action, and that was in the 
midst of a summer of Black Lives Mat-
ter rallies and marches. 
From the moment I arrived at that 
event and saw hundreds of, at that 
time, socially distanced and masked 
attendees, I saw her dedication. I saw 
her commitment firsthand. In addition 
to events like the Juneteenth Jubilee, 
Glynis and her colleagues at the Black 
Scranton Project are hard at work on 
their plan to reopen the Black Scran-
ton Project Center for Arts & Culture. 
The center will provide a safe, secure, 
and diverse environment that will lead 
to equity and inclusion for all residents 
by offering support like job assistance, 
career readiness training for adults, 
and also afterschool and summer pro-
grams for children. The plans for the 
center are ambitious, and I know that 
Glynis and her team are up for this im-
portant task. I am looking forward to 
walking through the doors of the cen-
ter to see their work for myself as soon 
as it opens. 
Having spaces for the community to 
come together to learn is necessary. It 
is necessary to build up and support 
the community, and I am grateful for 
Glynis’s commitment to do this work 
in our hometown. I know firsthand how 
Scranton can benefit from young peo-
ple like Glynis moving up and dedi-
cating their time to making our city 
and region a better place to live. We 
are lucky to have her talents and her 
drive. 
We know that in March of 2020, she 
was named one of the most ‘‘Influential 
Women of Northeastern Pennsylvania’’ 
in Happenings magazine and was also 
named a ‘‘Top 20 under 40 Young Busi-
ness Professionals’’ as part of the 2019 
honors, and that was in the North-
eastern Pennsylvania Business Jour-
nal. Glynis has already accomplished 
so much, and I am looking forward to 
watching her contributions to our 
hometown over the years to come. 
Our second honoree for Black History 
Month is Justan Parker Fields from 
the Lehigh Valley, just south of North-
eastern Pennsylvania, where the city 
of Allentown is, and it is right on the 
New Jersey border. Justan is a resident 
of the city of Allentown. 
Following the deaths of George Floyd 
and Breonna Taylor just last year, 
Justan decided to gather a few of his 
friends in the city of Allentown, in the 
downtown, to bring attention to these 
and other injustices against the Afri-
can-American community. This gath-
ering gained attention across the city 
and was attended by hundreds, includ-
ing the mayor of Allentown, the police 
chief, and elected officials from across 
the Lehigh Valley. This event gave the 
residents of Allentown an opportunity 
to express their thoughts and frustra-
tions surrounding racial injustice, and 
from there, Justan and his colleagues 
founded Black Lives Matter Lehigh 
Valley. They founded it in order to cre-
ate a platform to initiate real change 
in their community. 
Since then, Justan’s activism has 
only increased. He worked to form a 
collective with other local community 
and nonprofit leaders in the area to 
brainstorm about new initiatives for 
racial justice, for equity, and for equal-
ity for Black and Brown residents of 
the Lehigh Valley, and his work is not 
going unnoticed. 
I spoke with Justan and his col-
leagues shortly after their first event, 
and over the past year, he has re-
mained in regular communication with 
my office to discuss the progress that 
Black Lives Matter Lehigh Valley is 
making in Allentown and in sur-
rounding communities. He has also 
provided testimony to the Pennsyl-
vania House Democratic Policy Com-
mittee, partnered with the city of Al-
lentown to review their use of force 
policy, and he has also worked with the 
Allentown City Council to draft rec-
ommendations for police reform in the 
city. 
His activism has been inspiring to me 
and to so many others, and I know that 
that same inspiration draws other 
young people to his work. His hope is 
that those who attend his rallies or fol-
low Black Lives Matter Lehigh Valley 
on social media are motivated to jump- 
start their activism and their fight for 
equality. 
Justan lives in Allentown with his 
partner Kevin and children, Shyllee 
and Shamaer. There is no doubt that 
Justan’s work in Allentown is creating 
a healthier and more inclusive commu-
nity for his children and others like 
him. 
Justan 
and 
Kevin 
have 
founded 
Change Now, a local nonprofit that 
serves families in need in the greater 
Lehigh Valley. They have hosted food 
drives, delivered emergency food relief 
packages 
to 
families, 
hosted 
a 
Friendsgiving Dinner for the city, and 
sponsored Christmas presents for over 
100 children. Justan said that if there 
is anything this pandemic taught him, 
it was that anyone, any family was just 
an illness away from needing serious 
help. 
Through his work with both Change 
Now and Black Lives Matter Lehigh 
Valley, Justan continues to make Al-
lentown and the Greater Lehigh Valley 
a better place to live. And I thank him, 
and I know I speak on behalf of so 
many Pennsylvanians in thanking him 
for the many contributions to his com-
munity and to our Commonwealth. 
Third and final, going further south 
to the southeastern corner of our State 
in the Philadelphia region, Dr. Ala 
Stanford. As we recognize change-
makers this year, I am honored to rec-
ognize the contributions of Dr. Stan-
ford. 
She is an experienced physician, 
board certified by the American Board 
of Surgery in both general adult and 
pediatric general and thoracic surgery. 
She founded the Black Doctors COVID 
Consortium. It goes by the acronym 
BDCC. So many people have heard 
about them in our State and beyond. 
This consortium is an initiative estab-
lished to provide African Americans, 
who, of course, we know are suffering 
disproportionately from the incidence 
of 
and 
the 
mortality 
surrounding 
COVID–19—this 
consortium 
provides 
those 
Americans, 
those 
Pennsylva-
nians, with testing and education. Her 
work addresses not only the urgency of 
the present moment due to the pan-
demic but also a legacy of systemic 
structural racism that has left the 
Black 
community 
with 
significant 
health disparities—I think that is an 
understatement—and a mistrust of the 
healthcare system. 
I have had the privilege of engaging 
with Dr. Stanford on many occasions.

S807 
February 23, 2021 
She has provided her subject matter 
expertise to my office countless times, 
and she has been an unrelenting and 
passionate advocate for the commu-
nities, the people, and the families 
whom she serves. 
It is important to note that Dr. Stan-
ford started the consortium, BDCC, 
with her own funds, her own money, 
which is a true testament to her com-
mitment to delivering quality care to 
Black Americans. Dr. Stanford stepped 
up at an extremely volatile and uncer-
tain time for the people of our State. 
This speaks volumes about her leader-
ship and her dedication to addressing 
the enormous disparity in healthcare, 
both healthcare access and healthcare 
outcomes, for African Americans. 
Last month, I was honored to, again, 
participate in the annual celebration of 
the life and legacy of Dr. King at Gi-
rard College, where BDCC set up a test-
ing site, which they have done in every 
neighborhood throughout the city of 
Philadelphia. At that event, someone 
shared 
a 
powerful 
yet 
sobering 
quotation of Dr. King. Here is that 
quotation: 
In March of 1966, at a press conference 
ahead of his address to the Medical Commu-
nity for Human Rights in Chicago, [Dr. King] 
said that— 
And I am quoting Dr. King here— 
‘‘of all the forms of inequality, injustice in 
health is the most shocking and the most in-
humane because it often results in physical 
death.’’ 
So said Dr. King about the terrible 
inequity in healthcare. 
Visionary leaders and health experts 
like Dr. Stanford are on the frontlines 
every single day, working to fix a bro-
ken system—a system, frankly, that 
has been unfair to so many commu-
nities of color. However, Dr. Stanford 
is committed—committed—to making 
change happen in our healthcare sys-
tem so it can better serve the African- 
American community. 
She and her team have made national 
headlines and garnered the well-de-
served attention and support of many 
across the Nation as a result of the 
work of this consortium. So I thank 
Dr. Stanford for being an advocate, for 
being an anchor for the community, 
and, of course, a trusted leader. 
As I conclude, I think it goes without 
saying that this year has been a long, 
difficult, and dark year. I have to say, 
though, in the midst of all of that 
darkness and all of the pain—we just 
left the front of the Capitol in remem-
brance of the 500,000 Americans who 
have died from COVID–19—despite all 
that pain, all that loss, all that dark-
ness, this month of February, which 
just happens to be Black History 
Month, gives me some hope. In so 
many ways, I think our hope can be re-
newed. 
While the pandemic still rages, espe-
cially in those communities of color I 
spoke of, we also see that with contin-
ued education and leadership and cour-
age, such as someone like Dr. Stanford 
provides, and, of course, with vaccines 
available, COVID–19 will begin to re-
cede, and we will once again be able to 
hug our friends and family members 
and to move on from this pandemic. So 
we commend and salute people like Dr. 
Stanford who are helping us through 
this difficult time, providing some 
light in that darkness. 
Leaders like Justin Parker Fields 
have stood up to confront injustice and 
to proclaim to law enforcement and 
elected officials that the lives of Black 
men and women matter and are deserv-
ing of the same protection as any other 
life. 
As we saw people go through the 
polls this fall voting, and then others 
voting in January in Georgia, all of 
these Americans refusing to be intimi-
dated by misinformation and threats, I 
was more hopeful. Young leaders in 
communities of color have insisted on 
telling their own stories and writing 
them into the book of history that for 
too long has been kept hidden from 
them, just as Glynis Johns is doing in 
our hometown of Scranton. 
Each of our honorees, and so many 
like them, have indeed bent the arc of 
the moral universe toward justice, and 
for those brave acts, for those coura-
geous acts, we honor them today in 
Black History Month. May God bless 
their work. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to legislative session and be in 
a period of morning business, with Sen-
ators permitted to speak therein for up 
to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, ‘‘Re-
member this day forever.’’ That is 
what Donald Trump said on January 6, 
in a tweet to his supporters after they 
had attacked the U.S. Capitol. 
I certainly will never forget what 
happened that day. I will remember the 
Vice President being removed from the 
Chair and whisked off the floor of the 
Senate by the Secret Service. I will re-
member the law enforcement officers, 
holding automatic weapons, standing 
guard in the well of the Senate while 
the mob spread through the Capitol 
building. 
The entire country and the world will 
remember the now infamous images of 
a murderous mob rushing the barri-
cades, attacking police officers, break-
ing into this building, and rampaging 
through these hallowed halls. 
We will remember the incredible acts 
of heroism by Officer Eugene Goodman 
and others, to protect and defend those 
who work in this building. And we will 
remember the lives lost, including Offi-
cer Brian Sicknick, and the 140 police 
officers who were injured in this at-
tack. 
On February 3, Officer Sicknick’s 
ashes rested in honor in the Rotunda of 
this Capitol. He died defending this 
building and this democracy. I have 
thought about Officer Sicknick and his 
family often in the past few weeks. 
During the week of February 8, Sen-
ators served as jurors in the second im-
peachment trial of Donald Trump. 
Former 
President 
Trump 
was 
im-
peached on January 13 by the House of 
Representatives in a bipartisan vote, 10 
Republicans joining with Democrats to 
impeach. 
The Senate had a constitutional obli-
gation to conduct a trial on this Arti-
cle of Impeachment. We also had an ob-
ligation to make clear for the record 
and for history what happened on Jan-
uary 6 and the days leading up to it. 
What did the record show over the 
course of this trial? 
First, it showed Donald Trump’s big 
lie: his claim that the only way he 
could lose an election was if it were 
stolen. When he lost the 2020 election 
in a landslide to Joe Biden, Donald 
Trump refused to accept the will of the 
American people. He tried to challenge 
the election in the courts, losing over 
60 times. He tried to bully State offi-
cials into overturning their States’ 
election results. 
And when that failed, he invited his 
followers to come to Washington, DC, 
on January 6, the day when Congress 
would assemble to certify the States’ 
electoral votes. He invited them to 
come to DC to interrupt that process 
and, in his words, ‘‘stop the steal.’’ 
Donald Trump knew what his ex-
tremist followers were capable of. Over 
the summer, when armed extremists 
stormed and occupied State capitols, 
demanding an end to COVID–19 safety 
restrictions, he had cheered them on. 
On January 6, he whipped his fol-
lowers into a frenzy. ‘‘We have to fight 
like hell,’’ he told the crowd he had in-
vited and assembled. ‘‘If you don’t 
fight like hell, you’re not going to have 
a country anymore.’’ Then he told his 
followers—angry, inflamed, many of 
them armed—to go to the Capitol 
where the Vice President and Congress 
were certifying the votes. 
Donald Trump was not shocked what 
happened that day. He was excited. We 
now know that he ignored pleas from 
Members of Congress in the Capitol— 
members of his own party—who begged 
him to calm the mob and stop the at-
tack. 
To this day, Donald Trump has not 
showed one ounce of remorse or regret. 
He later described his speech on Janu-
ary 6 as ‘‘totally appropriate.’’ 
For 5 days, the House Managers me-
ticulously laid out an overwhelming 
case for conviction. The managers had 
the facts, the law, the Constitution, 
and a mountain of evidence on their 
side. The former President’s defense 
team did not have much to work with. 
They only spent a couple of hours mak-
ing their case and spent much of that

time showing cartoonish videos on re-
peat. The House Managers effectively 
rebutted all of the former President’s 
defenses. The managers’ case was clear, 
and it was compelling. 
That is why I voted to convict Don-
ald Trump for inciting an insurrection 
against our government. 
I regret that more of my Republican 
colleagues did not join me in voting to 
convict and disqualify Donald Trump 
from holding future office. I wish the 
Senate had sent an unequivocal mes-
sage that it is unacceptable for Presi-
dents to incite violence in order to stop 
the peaceful transition of power. But 
that said, history will show that this 
was the most bipartisan impeachment 
vote against a President in American 
history. 
And it should not be lost that a ma-
jority of Senators—including seven 
Senators from the President’s own 
party—voted to convict him. Donald 
Trump is no longer President of the 
United States, but the poison he has 
injected into our national bloodstream 
remains, and it is still toxic. 
As Americans reflect on the horrific, 
deadly events of January 6 and Donald 
Trump’s role in inciting them, I hope 
we will remember that democracy and 
our Constitution do not defend them-
selves. They must be protected, pre-
served, and defended by ‘‘We the Peo-
ple.’’ 
On January 6, that greatest tradition 
of American democracy, the peaceful 
transition of power that had taken 
place in every Presidential transition 
since George Washington’s, was bro-
ken. Our democracy, our Constitution, 
and this Capitol building were attacked 
on January 6, 2021. Brave Americans 
were wounded and killed defending 
them. And thanks to that bravery, our 
democracy endures. 
We must learn our lessons from this. 
We will remember January 6, 2021, for-
ever. And we must not repeat it. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today to speak about the terrible 
events of January 6, the impeachment 
vote, and the need to hold people ac-
countable for their actions. 
While the U.S. Senate did not achieve 
the two-thirds vote necessary to con-
vict former President Donald Trump, 
this will go down in history as the larg-
est bipartisan vote ever to hold a Presi-
dent accountable for high crimes and 
misdemeanors under our Constitution. 
Former 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
spent months pushing a big lie—that 
the November election was stolen from 
him. He inspired, encouraged, and in-
cited a deadly insurrection at the U.S. 
Capitol in order to stop the certifi-
cation of the electoral college vote, 
and then he did nothing to stop the vi-
olence, which caused massive injury 
and loss of life. 
I wish to convey my personal and 
deep gratitude to all of the Capitol Po-
lice officers who courageously put their 
lives on the line to protect all of us 
that day, and I join with my colleagues 
in grieving the loss of life and injuries 
that so many suffered as a result of 
this violent insurrection. 
This wasn’t just an attack on a build-
ing. It was an attack on all of the peo-
ple who work there. It was an attack 
on our form of government. It was an 
attack on our Constitution. It was an 
attack on ‘‘We the People.’’ 
This bipartisan vote sent an impor-
tant message: In America, no President 
is above the law. And inciting violence 
against our government is illegal and 
dangerous. 
Now, as a nation, we must move for-
ward. We must do everything we can to 
bring down the temperature of our de-
bates, find common ground on issues 
we care about, and reduce the divide in 
our families and communities. And we 
must continue to strive for account-
ability and justice. Our democracy de-
mands no less. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
the first few weeks of the Biden admin-
istration produced an absurd number of 
Executive orders, soft talk on China 
policy, and the threat of open borders. 
These actions left the American people 
confused and diluted their faith in our 
institutions, but nothing made the 
American people feel more unsettled 
than the unprecedented second im-
peachment and trial of former Presi-
dent Donald J. Trump. 
Impeachment is inherently political. 
The fallout is everything but. Last 
week, I was able to spend time talking 
to Tennesseans about what they saw 
and heard during the trial, and I was 
struck by how fiercely most of them 
spoke out against the very idea of it. 
The House Managers didn’t just fail 
to prove their case against the former 
President. They failed to convince the 
American people that the Members of 
the House of Representatives who sup-
ported impeachment acted in good 
faith when they drafted their single Ar-
ticle and transmitted it to the Senate 
for consideration. 
Tennesseans saw no serious inquiry 
into the alleged connection between 
the former President’s words and the 
actions of the dangerous rioters who 
breached the Capitol on January 6, 
2021. They remain unpersuaded by the 
arguments the House Managers offered 
to prove the constitutionality of the 
trial itself. In fact, the only thing they 
remain firmly convinced of is that this 
second impeachment culminated in 
nothing but a partisan show trial de-
signed to humiliate the former Presi-
dent and wipe the voices of more than 
70 million Americans from the pages of 
history. 
The Senate’s vote to acquit the 
former President of these spurious 
charges put an end to the House Man-
agers’ charade, but it will take more 
than an entry into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD to help the country rise above 
the enmity that fueled it. It is our duty 
to lead by example and get to work on 
behalf of the millions of Americans liv-
ing under this cloud of anxiety, fear, 
and mistrust. I encourage my col-
leagues to quiet their hearts in the 
coming weeks and commit to doing the 
work that will put us on the path to 
economic recovery, quality in-person 
schooling, and a strong national de-
fense. Only then will we be justified in 
asking those we serve to once again 
put their faith in us. 
I would be remiss if I did not asso-
ciate myself with the comments of the 
Republican Leader honoring Officer 
Eugene Goodman for his actions during 
the January 6, 2021 riot at the United 
States Capitol. 
On that day, Officer Goodman found 
himself alone, facing off against a rush-
ing tide of violence. Without blinking, 
he lured the mob away from the Senate 
chamber, protecting us from what we 
now know was an all but inevitable 
tragedy. 
I was honored to celebrate these acts 
of bravery and self-sacrifice by joining 
the Senate’s unanimous vote in sup-
port of S. 35, to award Officer Goodman 
the Congressional Gold Medal. I thank 
him for his courage and his commit-
ment to duty, and for his willingness to 
continue to serve here in the Capitol.

REMEMBERING KAREN LEWIS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, I 
would like to recognize the life of an 
exceptional woman: Karen Lewis. Most 
remember Karen as the fiery president 
of the Chicago Teachers Union who led 
the 2012 strike. Karen always fought 
for what she believed. She devoted her 
career to education and people. Her 
commitment to her beloved teachers 
was her North Star. 
Most will remember that Karen was 
no stranger to challenge. She attended 
Mount Holyoke College before transfer-
ring to Dartmouth College as a mem-
ber of the first coeducational class in 
the institution’s history. She had the 
courage to try her hand at medical 
school before finding her calling in 
teaching. As a new member in her 
teachers union, Karen did not hesitate 
to stand up when she thought some-
thing could be done better and ran for 
union offices as a member of the Cau-
cus of Rank and File Educators, CORE. 
However, this was only one side of 
Karen Lewis. In many ways she was a 
true renaissance woman. In Karen’s 
love of opera, her musical skill playing 
both flute and piano, her love of lan-
guages, her conversion to Judaism, and 
her passion for professional tennis, you 
could see the many facets of her life. 
But, above all else, I will remember 
Karen as a friend to both Loretta and 
me. 
In 2014, she was diagnosed with 
gioblastoma, a cancerous brain tumor. 
I remembered her diagnosis when many 
months later my colleague, Senator 
John McCain, faced the same chal-
lenge. I asked Karen who seemed to be 
weathering her personal storm if she 
would speak with John and she, of 
course, agreed. I do not know if the 
conversation took place, but I thought 
that these two heroes of much different 
wars could become unusual allies in

the common struggle each of us will 
face. 
The word ‘‘legendary’’ is overused, 
but when it comes to Karen Lewis, it 
falls short of describing an amazing life 
journey. I am reminded of a quote from 
Confucius that roughly translates to: 
‘‘If your plan is for one year, plant rice; 
if your plan is for ten years, plant 
trees; if your plan is for one hundred 
years, educate children.’’ I am thankful 
for Karen’s 100-year plan. Let us honor 
her memory by continuing her work to 
educate the children of America.

a motion made and seconded to go into 
closed session to discuss only whether the 
matters enumerated in subparagraphs (a) 
through (f) would require the meeting to be

mined that the matters to be discussed or

eign relations of the United States;

of an individual;

(2) the information has been obtained by

agenda enumerating separate items of legis-
lative business and Committee business will

Minority Member, speaking order shall be 
based on order of arrival, alternating be-
tween Majority and Minority Members, un-

Rule 15. Proxy voting shall be allowed on 
all measures and matters before the Com-
mittee. However, the vote of the Committee 
to report a measure or matter shall require

bers of the Committee who are physically 
present at the time of the vote. Proxies will 
be allowed in such cases solely for the pur-
pose of recording a Member’s position on the 
question and then only in those instances 
when the absentee Committee Member has 
been informed of the question and has af-
firmatively requested that he or she be re-
corded. (Paragraph 7(a)(3) of rule XXVI of

for which it is given and upon the items pub-
lished in the agenda for that date. 
(c) Each Committee report shall set forth 
the vote on the motion to report the meas-
ure or matter involved. Unless the Com-
mittee directs otherwise, the report will not

during Committee consideration. Any Mem-
ber who did not vote on any roll call shall

tion recorded in the appropriate Committee

to 
a 
second 
Sub-
committee until, in order of seniority, all

signments to one Subcommittee, and no 
Member shall receive assignment to a third 
Subcommittee until, in order of seniority, 
all Members have chosen assignments to two 
Subcommittees. 
(c) Any Member of the Committee may sit 
with any Subcommittee during its hearings

dential nomination, the testimony of the 
nominee and, at the request of any Member, 
any other witness shall be under oath. Every 
nominee shall submit the financial disclo-
sure report filed pursuant to title I of the 
Ethics in Government Act of 1978. Such re-
port is made available to the public. 
INVESTIGATIONS 
Rule 10. (a) Neither the Committee nor any 
of its Subcommittees may undertake an in-
vestigation unless specifically authorized by 
the Chairman and the Ranking Minority 
Member or a majority of all the Members of 
the Committee. 
(b) A witness called to testify in an inves-
tigation shall be informed of the matter or 
matters under investigation, given a copy of 
these rules, given the opportunity to make a 
brief and relevant oral statement before or 
after questioning, and be permitted to have 
counsel of his or her choosing present during 
his or her testimony at any public or closed 
hearing, or at any unsworn interview, to ad-
vise the witness of his or her legal rights. 
(c) For purposes of this rule, the term ‘‘in-
vestigation’’ shall not include a review or 
study undertaken pursuant to paragraph 8 of 
Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate or a preliminary inquiry, undertaken at 
the direction of the Chairman or the Rank-
ing Member, intended to determine whether 
there is substantial credible evidence that 
would warrant an investigation. 
SWORN TESTIMONY 
Rule 11. Witnesses in Committee or Sub-
committee hearings may be required to give 
testimony under oath whenever the Chair-
man or Ranking Minority Member of the 
Committee or Subcommittee deems such to 
be necessary. If one or more witnesses at a 
hearing are required to testify under oath, 
all witnesses at such hearing shall be re-
quired to testify under oath. 
SUBPOENAS

ity to issue subpoenas for the attendance of 
witnesses or the production of memoranda, 
documents, records, or other materials (1)

CONFIRMATION OF LINDA 
THOMAS-GREENFIELD 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, in times of 
conflict and peace, nations should dis-
cuss and resolve disputes. We cannot 
expect to achieve peace without effort 
and dialogue. The post of Ambassador 
to the United Nations is a position 
where engagement is of the utmost im-
portance. 
Throughout 
Ambassador 
Thomas-Greenfield’s 35-year tenure at 
the State Department, under both Re-
publicans and Democrats, she devel-
oped a long track record of engaging 
diplomatically with other countries 
through a very unique approach. Based 
on 
Ambassador 
Thomas-Greenfield’s 
career, I believe she will tackle inter-
national challenges and engage with 
friends and adversaries, alike, and I 
support her nomination. 
f 
CONFIRMATION OF THOMAS J. 
VILSACK 
Mr. PAUL, Mr. President, today, I 
voted to oppose the confirmation of 
Tom Vilsack as Secretary of the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture. While I ap-
preciate Mr. Vilsack’s willingness to 
again serve in this capacity after hold-
ing 
this 
same 
role 
in 
President 
Obama’s administration, his stance on 
USDA’s assistance programs and cli-
mate change give me pause. During his 
confirmation hearing, Mr. Vilsack stat-
ed one of his main priorities is expand-
ing eligibility for food stamps to people 
not necessarily in need. Mr. Vilsack’s 
willingness to expand eligibility for 
these programs will require more Fed-
eral spending and add to the national 
debt. 
Perhaps even more concerning is Mr. 
Vilsack’s willingness to use his posi-
tion at USDA to further President 
Biden’s 
aggressive 
climate 
change 
agenda, which will undoubtedly lead to 
more regulations on the agriculture in-
dustry. In his confirmation hearing, 
Mr. Vilsack stated, ‘‘If confirmed, 
USDA will lead the federal government 
in . . . investing in renewable energy 
. . . embracing sustainable and regen-
erative practices that enhance soil 
health . . . and delivering science- 
based solutions to help mitigate and 
reduce climate change.’’ Additionally, 
he said, ‘‘I share the president’s vision 
of a net-zero emission opportunity for 
U.S. agriculture . . .’’ Cumbersome 
regulations based on climate alarmism 
will inevitably lead to higher food 
prices for consumers. Farmers should 
be able to exercise their own sound 
judgement and common sense without 
burdensome Federal regulations. For 
these reasons, I opposed his confirma-
tion.

The Government of Finland has requested 
to buy twenty-five (25) M30A2 Extended 
Range Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Sys-
tems—Alternative Warhead (ER GMLRS–

The total estimated cost is $91.2 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by improving the security of a trusted 
partner which is an important force for po-
litical stability and economic progress in 
Europe. It is vital to the U.S. national inter-
est to assist Finland in developing and main-
taining a strong and ready self-defense capa-
bility. 
Finland intends to use these defense arti-
cles and services to modernize its armed 
forces. Finland intends to expand its existing 
army 
architecture 
to 
counter 
potential 
threats. This will contribute to the Finland 
military’s goal to upgrade its capability 
while enhancing interoperability between 
Finland, the United States, and other allies. 
Finland will have no difficulty absorbing 
these missiles into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin Corporation, Missile and Fire Con-
trol, Grand Prairie, TX. There are no known 
offsets associated with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of U.S. Govern-
ment or contractor representatives to Fin-

There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The ER GMLRS provides a persistent, 
responsive, all-weather, rapidly deployed, 
long range, surface-to-surface, area- and 
point-precision strike capability. The AW 
variant (XM403, also referred to as M30A2) 
carries a 200-pound fragmentation assembly 
filled with high explosives which, upon deto-
nation, accelerates two layers of preformed 
penetrators 
optimized 
for 
effectiveness 
against large area and imprecisely located 
targets. The Unitary variant (XM404, also re-
ferred to as M31A2) is a 200-pound class uni-
tary with a steel blast-fragmentation case, 
designed for low collateral damage against 
point targets. The ER GMLRS maintains the 
accuracy and effectiveness demonstrated by 
the baseline GMLRS out to a maximum 
range of 150 km (double of GMLRS capa-
bility) while also including a new Height Of 
Burst (HOB) capability. 
2. The highest level of classified informa-
tion associated with the sale of this equip-
ment is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures or equivalent systems that might 
reduce weapon system effectiveness or be 
used in the development of a system with 
similar or advanced capabilities. 
4. A determination has been made that 
Finland can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of Fin-
land.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Jordan—F–16 Air Combat Training Center 
The Government of Jordan has requested 
to buy an F–16 Air Combat Training Center 
and Devices including full mission trainers, 
combat tactics trainers, instructor/operator 
stations, tactical environment simulators, 
brief/debrief stations, scenario generation 
stations, database generation stations, mis-
sion observation centers, and other training 
center equipment and support; software and 
software support; publications and technical

program support. The estimated total cost is 
$60 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve the security of 
a Major Non-NATO Ally that is an important 
force for political stability and economic 
progress in the Middle East. 
The proposed sale will improve Jordan’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by ensuring Jordan’s pilots are effec-
tively trained, which will contribute to the 
U.S.-Jordan lasting partnership and ensure 
the country’s stability, a critical element to 
broader U.S. regional policy goals. Jordan 
will use this asset to enhance training of pi-
lots. Jordan will have no difficulty absorbing 
these training center assets and simulators 
into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin Corporation Rotary & Mission Sys-
tems, Orlando, FL. There are no known off-
set agreements proposed in connection with 
this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of two U.S. Lockheed 
Martin contractor representatives to Jordan 
for a duration of 2 years to support training. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

HONORING THE LIVES OF IDAHO 
NATIONAL GUARDSMEN 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along 
with my colleagues Senator JIM RISCH, 
Representative MIKE SIMPSON, and Rep-
resentative RUSS FULCHER, I rise today 
to honor the lives and service of CW4 
Jesse Anderson, CW3 George ‘‘Geoff’’ 
Laubhan, and CW3 Matthew Peltzer. 
These three fallen Idaho Army Na-
tional Guard personnel were partici-
pating in a routine training flight 
when their UH–60 Black Hawk heli-
copter crashed near Boise on February 
2, 2021. 
Chief Warrant Officer 4 Anderson, 
Chief Warrant Officer 3 Laubhan, and 
Chief Warrant Officer 3 Peltzer an-
swered the call of duty to serve our 
State and our Nation with honor, dis-
tinction, and courage. 
CW4 Jesse Anderson, of Boise, was a 
senior instructor pilot. He had served 
in the Idaho Army National Guard 
since 2008, and he first joined the U.S. 
Army as an aviation warrant officer 
candidate in 2000. Chief Warrant Officer 
4 Anderson is survived by his wife and 
four children. While in the Idaho Army 
National Guard, CW4 Anderson served 
as a UH–60 A/L pilot in command, UH– 
60 A/L instructor pilot, C–12 fixed wing 
pilot, C–12 operations officer, company 
and battalion aviation standardization 
officer, and medical evacuation pilot. 
He served in multiple deployments, in-
cluding two deployments to Afghani-
stan. He also participated in local 
search and rescue operations, wildland 
fire fighting missions in California, and 
civil support operations in Guatemala. 
Chief 
Warrant 
Officer

War 
on 
Terrorism 
Service 
Medal, the Combat Action Badge, the 
Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Cali-
fornia Achievement Medal, the Idaho 
Emergency Duty Ribbon, and the Idaho 
Service Ribbon. 
Chief Warrant Officer 3 Laubhan, of 
Boise, was an instructor pilot, who is 
survived by his wife and two children. 
In January 2010, CW3 Laubhan enlisted 
in the Idaho Army National Guard as 
an AH–64 attack helicopter repairer 
with D Company, 1st Battalion of the 
183rd Aviation Regiment. He went on 
to serve as an AH–64 Apache and UH–60 
Black Hawk pilot, a UH–60 instructor 
pilot, and a medical evacuation pilot 
while with the battalion. His service 
included deploying in 2019 as a Black 
Hawk pilot to Guatemala in support of 
Operation Beyond the Horizon, and he 
is credited with flying a lifesaving mis-
sion in support of Idaho search and res-
cue operations. He also flew in support 
of wildland firefighting operations in 
California. The awards and decorations 
he earned for his admirable service in-
clude the Meritorious Service Medal, 
the Army Achievement Medal, the 
Army Reserve Component Achieve-
ment Medal, the National Defense 
Service Medal, the Army Service Rib-
bon, the Army Reserve Component 
Overseas Training Ribbon, the Global 
War on Terrorism Service Medal, the 
Aviation Badge, the Army Aviator 
Badge, 
the 
California 
Achievement 
Medal, and the Idaho Service Ribbon.

Army National Guard’s 1st Battalion of 
the 183rd Aviation Regiment as an offi-
cer candidate in July 2005. Chief War-
rant Officer 3 Peltzer served as an AH– 
64 Apache pilot in command, a UH–60 
Black Hawk pilot, an aviation mission 
survivability officer, an aviation safety 
officer, and a medical evacuation heli-
copter pilot all while with the bat-
talion. His service also included serv-
ing in Guatemala as a Black Hawk 
pilot in support of Operation Beyond 
the Horizon. The many recognitions he 
earned for his remarkable service in-
clude the Meritorious Service Medal, 
the Army Reserve Component Achieve-
ment Medal, the National Defense 
Service Medal, the Armed Forces Re-
serve Medal, the Army Service Ribbon, 
the Army Reserve Component Overseas 
Training Ribbon, the Senior Aviator 
Badge, the Idaho Adjutant General’s 
Outstanding Unit Award, and the Idaho 
Service Ribbon. 
Our citizen-soldiers embody a spirit 
of service and the best of American pa-
triotism, and this loss is felt deeply 
throughout Idaho. All three were sol-
diers, husbands, and fathers who left an 
enduring 
legacy 
of 
service 
and 
strength. Chief Warrant Officer 4 An-
derson’s, 
Chief 
Warrant 
Officer 
3 
Laubhan’s, and Chief Warrant Officer 3 
Peltzer’s service and sacrifices will not 
be forgotten, and their selflessness will 
continue to serve as an example for all 
of us. We extend our deepest condo-
lences to the families and friends of 
these heroic men, including their fel-
low guardsmen. Our prayers are with 
their wives and children, friends and 
loved ones, and fellow soldiers in the 
Idaho National Guard as they grieve 
this tragic loss. Each of us owes a deep 
debt of gratitude to our Idaho Army 
National Guardsmen. Their service on 
behalf of Idaho and the Nation is sec-
ond to none, and we thank them for 
their countless sacrifices to keep us 
safe. Our State and our country mourn 
the passing of three of our heroes. 
In closing, the following poem titled 
‘‘Above the Purple Sage’’ was written 
by Major Andrew Whipple, retired, an 
Idaho veteran, to pay tribute to the pi-
lots and help lift the hearts of those 
mourning their loss: 
‘‘From field and farm, 
From small town and large; 
Their dreams all the same, 
To answer the charge. 
They dreamed of the feel of wind in their 
faces, 
To roam the places of old story book Aces. 
Leaving the ground the Flying Knights 
rose, 
The city lights behind them, 
Their nerves so composed. 
Above the Purple Sage they soared; 
Their friendships and bonds not easily 
forged. 
While many lay dreaming and safe in their 
beds, 
The three Knights rose higher, 
From the ground they had shed. 
The Purple Sage below them, 
They flew higher and higher; 
The night sky around them, 
There was nothing so finer. 
These three Knights of the Air, 
Together they flew; 
But alas all was quiet, 
Except the coming of the dawning dew. 
Their journey to soar, 
To protect those behind; 
It came to an end, 
But forever entwined. 
Their journey continues, 
Their flight it goes on; 
With Aces and others dreamers, 
Fly on—Fly on!’’ 
f 
REMEMBERING BARBARA A. 
O’MALLEY 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I 
rise to pay tribute and honor the life of 
the late Mrs. Barbara O’ Malley, a 
friend, and a dedicated public servant 
who proudly served Maryland and our 
Nation as a congressional staffer for 
Senator Barbara Mikulski for over 
three decades. 
Born in Fort Wayne, IN, Barbara’s 
love of public service was nurtured 
early on by her father, Joseph Suelzer, 
a World War I veteran who served as 
the chair of the Democratic Party in 
Indiana’s Allen County. She got an 
early start in politics as a congres-
sional 
campaign 
staffer 
and 
then 
moved to Washington, DC, where she 
met her future husband, Thomas Mar-
tin O’Malley, at the Young Democrats’ 
headquarters in our Nation’s Capital. 
The O’Malleys made a home in Mary-
land, where Barbara spent 33 years as a 
stay-at-home mother before her incli-
nation towards politics called her into 
service once more, this time with an 
opportunity to work for one of the only 
two female Senators in Congress at 
that time, Senator Barbara Mikulski. 
In Congress, Barbara found a second 
home. To all those fortunate enough to 
work in the Senate and especially to 
those who worked on the fifth floor of 
the Senate Hart Building, including 
myself, Barbara was simply known as 
‘‘Mrs. O.’’ She worked as a receptionist 
for Senator Mikulski and was the 
friendly face who welcomed constitu-
ents, colleagues, friends, and even Sen-
ators to the office. With her warmth 
and kindness, she made you feel right 
at home. And with her deep knowledge 
of Maryland’s democratic politics, you 
knew she meant business. She cher-
ished working for Congress, and as a 
lover of history, she did not take for 
granted how special it was to walk the 
same Capitol halls as many of our 
former great American leaders. 
Even though Barbara was committed 
to serving the people of Maryland, she 
was also equally committed to her 
family—her husband, her six children, 
grandchildren, 
and 
great-grand-
children. In their family, Barbara and 
her husband, Thomas, a World War II 
veteran, instilled a sense of duty and 
public service, so it came as no surprise 
that their son, Martin O’Malley, went 
on to become the mayor of Baltimore 
and Governor of their beloved State of 
Maryland. 
Dedication and commitment to pub-
lic service defined Barbara’s career in 
Congress, and we are so lucky she 
chose the Senate as one of the places to 
make her mark in this world.

TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL 
BRIAN WINSKI 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor one of America’s finest, 
MG Brian Winski, who served a 24- 
month tour as the commanding general 
of the 101st Airborne Division and Fort 
Campbell, KY. Major General Winski’s 
unparalleled mastery across the tac-
tical, operational, and strategic spec-
trums in combination with his infec-
tious and inspirational leadership pro-
vided a continuous source of motiva-
tion for soldiers and leaders alike. 
In a time of uncertainty, Major Gen-
eral Winski exhibited the most valued 
traits of a leader. As the senior com-
mander of Fort Campbell, KY, Major 
General Winski oversaw support serv-
ices for 33,000 soldiers, 50,000 family 
members, 10,000 civilian employees, 
and 150,000 retirees. Prior to the global 
Covid–19 
pandemic, 
Major 
General 
Winski shaped the way in which the 
101st Airborne Division plans and exe-
cutes emergency deployment readiness 
exercises leading the 531st Hospital 
Center EDRE and later watched their 
successful domestic deployment to New 
York to provide help in crisis. 
Major General Winski’s impressive 
contributions enabled mission success 
in some of the toughest and most chal-
lenging conditions. The distinctive ac-
complishments 
of 
Major 
General 
Winski reflect great credit upon him-
self, the 101st Airborne Division (Air 
Assault), the XVIII Airborne Corps, the 
U.S. Army, and the Department of De-
fense. I join my fellow Kentuckians in 
honoring Major General Brian Winski 
with the Award of Distinguished Serv-
ice Medal as he served his country with 
class and courage.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE KLAMATH 
TRIBES 
∑ Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, the 
Klamath Tribes in Oregon have a say-
ing: ‘‘We help each other; We will live 
good.’’ These words are neither hollow 
nor trivial to the members of these 
Tribes. They live them each and every 
day and never more so than when dis-
aster strikes. When the Two Four Two 
Fire 
raged 
through 
the 
Chiloquin 
Ranger 
District 
of 
the 
Fremont- 
Winema National Forest last Sep-
tember, scorching over 14,000 acres, de-
stroying homes and traditional hunt-
ing and fishing sites, members of the 
Tribes rallied together, opening their 
doors, their hearts, and their wallets to 
help their fellow Oregonians in a time 
of great need. 
They brought those eight words— 
‘‘We help each other; We will live 
good’’—to life. 
When emergency personnel needed a 
large, open area to establish an evacu-
ation shelter for all those who had to

flee their homes ahead of the inferno, 
the Tribes immediately offered up the 
parking lot the Kla-Mo-Ya Casino for 
their use. 
When the firefighters tasked with 
containing the fire needed a massive 
open space to stage their ample equip-
ment, those same expansive parking 
lots were readily provided to them. 
At the same time, the doors of their 
hotel were thrown open to anyone dis-
placed by the fire, to Tribal and non- 
Tribal members alike who were in need 
of shelter. In the middle of a pandemic, 
with all manner of precautions in place 
to keep folks healthy and safe, that 
was no easy feat, but they did it, all 
while also welcoming the Red Cross in-
side to set up a response center, as 
well. 
As the forests burned around it, the 
Kla-Mo-Ya Casino stood there like the 
eye of a hurricane. It became a center 
of help and healing, of safety and shel-
ter. Had they just done those things, 
the Klamath Tribes would have already 
gone far above and beyond to support 
Tribal members and community mem-
bers alike. They didn’t stop, however, 
with providing the use of their hotel 
and its facilities to first responders and 
to those in need. 
No. 
Klamath 
Tribal 
Behavioral 
Health went out and provided assist-
ance and services to anyone who had 
been affected and displaced, free of 
charge. Whether they were Tribal 
members or not, it didn’t matter. 
Those who needed help were able to get 
it. They helped feed the firefighters 
risking their lives fighting the infer-
nos, emergency volunteers helping oth-
ers, and even evacuees. 
And even now, some 5 months after 
the worst of the fire’s carnage, the 
Klamath Tribes are still doing what 
they can to help those whose lives were 
turned upside down by it. A GoFundMe 
account has been set up to help any 
family who lost their home or their 
property to the Two Four Two Fire re-
build and start to get back up on their 
feet again. The distribution of the 
money raised by the account is still a 
work in progress. The Tribes are fine- 
tuning the priority system and how 
folks will apply for it. But once all of 
that is worked out, this is going to be 
a tremendous help to so many of our 
friends and neighbors who have en-
dured such heartbreak and hardship. 
‘‘We help each other; We will live 
good.’’ There is no question that the 
members of the Klamath Tribes have 
helped those in need across southern 
Oregon through an unimaginably dif-
ficult time. We are all deeply grateful 
for everything they have done, both 
during the Two Four Two Fire and 
afterward. And we will all be better off 
as a State and as a community because 
of their kindness and generosity of 
spirit.∑ 
RECOGNIZING 
GENEVA’S 
SHEAR 
PERFECTION BARBER & BEAUTY 
SALON 
∑ Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this 
month our country is joining together 
in celebration of Black History Month. 
It is a month for all of us to recognize 
the indescribable impact that Black 
Americans have left made on our Na-
tion; to recommit ourselves to the 
struggle to achieve and ensure racial 
justice throughout our land; and, of 
course, to celebrate Black culture and 
all of its contributions to America 
past, present, and future. Few institu-
tions are more connected or have been 
more central to Black culture than the 
barbershop and beauty salon. As de-
scribed by the Smithsonian’s National 
Museum of African American History 
and Culture, for generations, men and 
women have been going to these busi-
nesses not just for hair care, but for 
the sense of community and security 
they provide. Black Americans go to 
spend time among peers, playing cards 
or chess, sharing the latest local news 
and engaging in passionate debates 
about politics. Men and women go in to 
these businesses for friendship and 
mentorship and to be engaged in the af-
fairs of their neighbors and their com-
munity. 
For 30 years, this was particularly 
true of Geneva’s Shear Perfection Bar-
ber & Beauty Salon in northeast Port-
land. Since opening its doors in 1991, 
Geneva’s has been a hub for Portland’s 
African-American 
community, 
wel-
coming over 1,000 people through its 
doors every month. Folks from Michael 
Jordan and Muhammed Ali, to mem-
bers of the Portland Trailblazers, sat in 
its chairs. But more importantly, it 
stood as the heart for three genera-
tions of Black Portlanders who first 
walked through Geneva’s doors as chil-
dren with their parents and then went 
on to bring their own sons and daugh-
ters for their first haircuts, even as the 
area around this local institution un-
derwent the kind of gentrification that 
pushed Black families further and fur-
ther away. 
But it wasn’t only the barbershop 
itself that is considered an institution 
of the Portland community—so is the 
Knauls family who owned and operated 
it for three decades. Geneva Knauls, 
who passed away in 2014, was our 
State’s 
first 
Black 
female 
barber. 
Throughout her years as a business-
woman, Geneva supported all different 
kinds of local grassroots projects and 
organizations, and become one of the 
most beloved people in the northeast 
Portland community. Her status is 
only equaled by her husband’s, Mr. 
Paul Knauls, Sr., who is affectionately 
known around town as the Mayor of 
Northeast Portland. From 1963 to 1970, 
Mr. Knauls owned and ran the Cotton 
Club, which was the place for jazz and 
soul music, welcoming such big names 
as Etta James, Big Mama Thornton, 
and Sammy Davis, Jr., to its stage to 
serenade music-loving Portlanders. He 
sold the Cotton Club in 1970 and went 
on to open a series of others through-
out town before finally opening Gene-
va’s. All the while, throughout all of 
his business adventures, Paul has been 
active in other ways throughout the 
community. He worked with the Junior 
Achievement Program at both Hum-
boldt and Jefferson schools, tutored in 
the HOSTS—Help One Student to Suc-
ceed—program at King School, and 
served for 6 years on the board of the 
Urban League. 
Last year, Mr. Knauls and his son, 
Paul Jr., decided it was finally time to 
take a break and close the doors of Ge-
neva’s. It was also a decision made out 
of a recognition of the difficult new re-
alities of trying to operate a personal 
care business in the midst of an un-
precedented national and global pan-
demic. Sadly, the Knauls and Geneva’s 
are not alone. Many businesses have 
been forced to confront life amid the 
COVID pandemic and BIPOC-owned 
businesses and communities have been 
disproportionately 
impacted. 
Last 
year’s announcement of the closure of 
Geneva’s Shear Perfection Barber & 
Beauty Salon was understandably met 
with an emotional outpouring from 
local Portlanders. Men and women who 
had been going to the shop their entire 
lives took to the shop’s Facebook page 
to thank the Knauls family for their 
contributions to the community and to 
share some fond memories. Statements 
came from local leaders and celebrities 
touting Geneva’s legacy, as one person 
put it, as ‘‘one of the most important 
examples of a black business that rep-
resented more to the community than 
just a place to get a haircut.’’ 
And a year after its closing, that leg-
acy continues to endure. Geneva’s 
Facebook page is brimming with pic-
tures of young men in graduation robes 
in front of the salon, of a turkey give-
away in its parking lot that took place 
this past Thanksgiving to help provide 
for families in need, and announce-
ments from other local Black business 
owners who are moving into the space 
to continue the Knauls family’s entre-
preneurial spirit. And the legacy of 
‘‘The Mayor’’ and his iconic standing 
in the community remains as strong 
today as it ever has; even after cele-
brating Mr. Knaul’s 90th birthday age 
and the pandemic have not stopped 
Paul Knauls, Sr., from putting on two 
masks to go out for daily walks in his 
neighborhood and around the Lloyd 
Center. For his 90th birthday last 
month, the nonprofit World Arts Foun-
dation streamed a live storytelling 
event, featuring decades of friends, em-
ployees, and admirers to help him cele-
brate. 
I know that Portlanders everywhere 
will join me in expressing the immense 
gratitude to Geneva’s Shear Perfection 
Barber & Beauty Salon and to the 
Knauls family for all that they have 
done for the community. Northeast 
Portland certainly won’t be the same 
without Geneva’s, but everyone who 
walked through those doors over the 
last 30 years has had their lives

both big and small. And it is reassuring 
to know that, through each of them, 
Geneva’s legacy, the legacy of the

of community and friendship and look-

REMEMBERING MEL RICHARD 
ANTONEN 
∑ Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would 
like to include in the RECORD the fol-
lowing obituary for Mel Antonen, a na-
tive South Dakotan and longtime 
Major League Baseball reporter for 
USA Today and elsewhere, who passed 
away on January 30, 2021. He is honored 
by Charles Raasch, also a native South 
Dakotan, of USA Today with an obit-
uary upon his death. I extend my deep-
est sympathy to the Antonen family. 
The material follows: 
Mel Antonen, family man, friend to the 
world, and renowned sports journalist, died 
Saturday of a rare acute auto-immune dis-
ease and complications from COVID–19. He 
was a longtime USA TODAY Sports and 
MASN-TV baseball reporter who covered 
nearly three dozen World Series. In a half 
century in journalism, he reveled and ex-
celled in telling others’ stories. 
He was 64. 
Mel Richard Antonen’s own story became 
the best of all. It began in the tiny town of 
Lake Norden, South Dakota, on Aug. 25, 1956, 
when he was the third of four children born 
to Ray and Valda Antonen. 
Lake Norden is 225 miles from the nearest 
major league ballpark and has never been 
populated with more than 550 people, but on 
soft summer evenings fans from counties 
away congregate at Memorial Park to watch 
a new episode of South Dakota’s storied 
amateur baseball history. Its pull never left 
him even as he walked, as a sports jour-
nalist, on Boston’s hallowed Fenway Park 
with the late Yankees Hall of Famer Joe 
DiMaggio, or sat in a pre-game spring train-
ing dugout with another Hall of Fame mem-
ber, Minnesota Twins slugger Harmon Kille-
brew, weeks before Killebrew died in 2011. 
The Antonen family has promoted amateur 
baseball in Lake Norden for decades. Mel 
loved to tell how his father, Ray over the 
years brought to the tiny hometown a series 
of barnstorming pros, including the leg-
endary Satchel Paige and Cy Young Award 
winner Jim Perry, to play at Memorial Park. 
On the mornings of home games throughout 
his childhood and beyond, Mel, his father and 
siblings would groom the field, with the ris-
ing corn and soybean fields ritually marking 
the progression of summer beyond the left- 
field fence. 
‘‘I love baseball because it always brings 
me home,’’ Antonen said at his induction to 
South Dakota Sports Hall of Fame in 2017. 
‘‘A baseball park in my mind is a home. It 
doesn’t matter if it’s next to a cornfield, as 
it is in Lake Norden, or if it is next to a rum-
bling subway, in New York.’’ 
At USA TODAY, and later as an analyst 
for MASN, the network that covers the 
Washington Nationals and Baltimore Ori-
oles, Antonen ‘‘was a very good storyteller 
who went far beyond balls and strikes and 
the score of the game,’’ said his retired USA 
TODAY Sports editor Henry Freeman. 
Dan Connolly was among the reporters in 
the Washington-Baltimore area with whom 
Antonen was close, as they two sat next to 
each other in the press box and exchanged 
good-natured barbs. 
‘‘He had such an easy way about him with 
players and media and staff,’’ Connolly said. 
‘‘It was one of those things, everyone liked 
the guy. Everyone. He had a way about him. 
He could relate to anybody. He was really 
very smart, and being a South Dakota boy, 
he was very ease to relate to. I remember 
him saying that if he didn’t go into baseball 
writers, he wanted to be a Lutheran min-
ister. You could tell Mel anything, he was a 
pastoral listening-type guy.’’ 
Antonen’s journalism career began as a 
kid, when he called in scores from Lake 
Norden’s home games to two newspapers 
that he ended up writing for: the Watertown 
(S.D.) Public Opinion, which paid him as a 
high schooler 15 cents a copy inch; and the 
Sioux Falls Argus Leader, where he got his 
first job after graduation from Augustana 
University, eventually covering the sports, 
farm and political beats. 
He joined USA TODAY in 1986, where one 
of his earliest assignments was covering the 
Tonya 
Harding 
Olympics 
figure-skating 
scandal. Antonen became a MLB reporter 
and columnist, covering history from Cal 
Ripken Jr.’s consecutive games streak to the 
Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa record-breaking 
home run race and the steroid scandals that 
followed. The story he often said was seared 
most in his memory came during the earth-
quake-interrupted 1989 World Series. There, 
sitting in a press box high above San Fran-
cisco’s Candlestick Park, he watched as the 
entire stadium undulated dangerously during 
the destructive Loma Prieta quake. Antonen 
filed a story, then headed out for days to 
cover the aftermath, focusing on the human 
costs. 
Hall of Famer Ripken told USA TODAY 
Sports’ Bob Nightengale that Antonen ‘‘was 
a fixture around the game for so many years, 
and it was clear that he had a passion for 
baseball. He was a thorough and thoughtful 
reporter and left his mark on his profes-
sion.’’ 
Along with the World Series, Antonen cov-
ered three Olympics, and professional bowl-
ing leagues. 
‘‘I can’t imagine being anything other than 
a reporter, an ink-stained wretch,’’ he told 
his Hall of Fame audience. 
Freeman, his editor at USA TODAY’s pio-
neering 
sports 
section, 
said 
Antonen’s 
knowledge of baseball, reverence for its his-
tory, and his love of stories, was evident 
from the first day. 
‘‘It became clear to me right away the un-
derstanding he had of baseball, and a lot of 
that was because of his father,’’ said Free-
man. 
Freeman said one of his favorite stories in-
volved Antonen at the 1988 Olympic Games 
in Seoul. Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson 
won the 100 meters in world-record time, but 
failed a drug test, was stripped of his gold 
medal and ordered to be sent home. USA 
TODAY received a tip that Johnson had res-
ervations on one of several potential flights 
out of South Korea, and Freeman imme-
diately sent Antonen to the airport to find 
Johnson and to do anything necessary to get 
an interview. 
Carrying nothing but a walkie-talkie and 
his reporter’s notebook, Antonen arrived at 
the airport and quickly discovered that Ben 
Johnson was booked on a flight to Toronto. 
Antonen bought a ticket, went aboard and 
found Ben Johnson—who turned out to be a 
doctor, decades older than the sprinter by 
the same name. Antonen turned failure into 
a memorable human interest story about the 
frantic hunt through Olympics high-security 
obstacles that ended with the wrong Ben 
Johnson. 
‘‘It was a non-story that he made a good 
story of its own,’’ Freeman said. ‘‘It also 
showed the lengths that Mel would go to get 
a good story.’’ 
Using 
persistence 
and 
personality, 
Antonen scored a rare interview with the no-
toriously press-shy DiMaggio, late in the leg-
end’s life, after learning that DiMaggio was 
in Boston for a special event at Fenway 
Park. The man considered ‘‘ungettable’’ by 
many sports journalists talked for several 
hours with Antonen, and they finished with 
a stroll in front of the Green Monster. 
DiMaggio ‘‘loved the history of baseball,’’ 
Antonen years later told the Argus-Leader. 
He was a sports broadcaster for MASN’s 
Mid-Atlantic Sports Report, and radio ana-
lyst on Sirius-XM in the last decade of his 
career, and also wrote for Sports Illustrated 
and other publications. He did a radio inter-
view on the baseball Hall of Fame voting 
from his hospital bed less than a week before 
his death. He especially loved talking base-
ball with long-haul truckers on his late- 
night satellite radio show. 
Antonen’s mother died when he was 12. His 
father, himself enshrined in the South Da-
kota Sports Hall of Fame, raised Mel and his 
sisters, Kathy and Carmen, and brother, 
Rusty, with the field at Memorial Park be-
coming a refuge. 
‘‘My life reflects the power of baseball,’’ he 
said in that 2017 speech. ‘‘One of my earliest 
memories of Lake Norden baseball was the 
summer of 1969. . . . In March of that year 
my mom died after a year-long battle with 
cancer. But it was baseball, and Lake Norden 
baseball, with hot dogs and a 10-cent glass of 
pop and chasing batting-practice foul balls 
on a beautiful summer night, that created a 
diversion from fearful images of three 
months prior—(of) my mom’s tan casket, 
crying adults, the hearse in front of Trinity 
Lutheran, on an overcast subzero day, when 
there were piles of snow in one of South Da-
kota’s worst winters.’’ 
Antonen 
kept 
reporting 
and 
writing 
throughout his illness with COVID–19 and an 
auto-immune disease so rare that his doctors 
told him he may have been the only person 
on Earth with that combination. 
Months after being diagnosed with both 
diseases, Mel scored an interview with An-
thony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious dis-
ease expert and big baseball fan, who talked 
about the need for caution, but also hope, in 
a pandemic. ‘‘You’ve got to go on with your 
life, but that doesn’t mean you have to de-
prive yourself of all the pleasures’’ Fauci 
told him. 
Antonen’s final column for MASN, written 
after the Dodgers won the World Series in 
October, paid homage to the comforting and 
reassuring next-year ritual of baseball. It 
ended this way: ‘‘World Series 2021 pre-
diction: The Padres in six over the White 
Sox.’’ 
Mel Richard Antonen is survived by his 
son, Emmett, 14, and his wife, Lisa Nipp, a 
photojournalist, whom he married in 2001, 
along with three siblings and their families. 
Lisa embraced the many characters in Mel’s 
baseball orbit, once holding the phone for 
Mel with the crusty, late Hall-of-Fame 
pitcher Bob Feller by discussing the beauty 
of hollyhocks. 
‘‘From Joe DiMaggio to Dusty Baker and 
Bryce Harper, I have gotten to meet and 
interview and become friends with people 
that baseball fans around the world would 
love to know,’’ he said in that Hall of Fame 
speech in South Dakota. ‘‘But those experi-
ences only happened because I grew up 
around people that we should all be lucky to 
know. The lessons learned here, and on the 
prairie, have gone with me and worked beau-
tifully. And tonight, baseball brings me 
home once again.’’∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S818 
February 23, 2021 
REMEMBERING JANE ANNE 
BOORMAN 
∑ Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I 
would like to pay tribute to Ms. Jane 
Anne Boorman, a native South Dako-
tan and dedicated public servant, who 
passed away in December. Jane was 
deeply respected among her peers and 
beyond, having earned a superb reputa-
tion with her hard work and integrity. 
Jane was active and well-known in 
South Dakota Republican Party poli-
tics, and she was a thought-leader and 
friend, who no doubt helped inspire 
countless leaders and support impor-
tant 
efforts 
throughout 
our 
great 
State. I extend my deep condolences 
and prayers to the Boorman family. 
The following is Jane’s obituary hon-
oring the life of this great South Dako-
tan. 
The material follows: 
Jane Anne Boorman (1932 to 2020), a retired 
federal employee, Congressional aide, and 
newspaper editor died on December 11, 2020, 
at Arbor Place Retirement Home in Rock-
ville, Maryland. She was 88. 
Jane was born in Lemmon, South Dakota 
to Anne Sutton Boorman and Lloyd Bruce 
(LB) Boorman. She graduated from Lemmon 
High School and Marquette University. 
Jane’s life straddled South Dakota and 
Washington, DC. Born and raised on the high 
plains in Lemmon, South Dakota, Jane em-
bodied the flinty independence of its early 
settlers. She was hard to know and always 
pushed for perfection, but once you were in 
her life you had a steadfast, loyal, and loving 
friend. 
In Lemmon, Jane was editor and held 
other roles at the Lemmon Leader—the fam-
ily-owned 
newspaper—where 
she 
worked 
until 1973. She also was named co-editor for 
‘‘Dakota Panorama’’—an history of South 
Dakota published by the South Dakota Ter-
ritory Centennial observance in 1961. 
Jane’s passion for Republican party poli-
tics started early in her life. She was se-
lected 
Outstanding 
Young 
Republican 
Woman in South Dakota and represented 
South Dakota as the state’s Young Repub-
lican National Committee woman in 1961. In 
1963 she was elected Vice Chairman of the 
National Young Republican Federation. 
In 1973, she moved from Lemmon to Wash-
ington, D.C. to be a Press Secretary for then 
Congressman James Abdnor when he was 
elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. 
She followed Abdnor to the U.S. Senate in 
1981 as the Senator’s personal secretary. As 
the Washington Post noted in 1986, Jane was 
‘‘the embodiment of that Hill legend—the fu-
riously devoted personal secretary, a com-
bination mother, wife and watchdog, pro-
tecting as she sees best the beloved senator 
behind the door.’’ 
Boorman joined the U.S. Small Business 
Administration (SBA) in 1987 as Director of 
Communications 
after 
President 
Ronald 
Reagan appointed Abdnor as Administrator 
of the SBA. During her 28 years at the Agen-
cy, Jane held various positions including 
managing the agency’s relationship with 
SCORE and coordinating activities when 
international delegations visited the SBA. 
She retired from the SBA in 2015. 
In Washington, she made her home at Riv-
erside Condominium for 48 years and was ac-
tive on the condo board, Southwest Neigh-
borhood Assembly, and was a long-time or-
ganist at Fort Leslie J. McNair, and at St. 
Dominic Catholic Church. 
Although she lived in Washington DC, Jane 
maintained a strong foothold in South Da-
kota through memberships in the S.D. News-
paper Association, the S.D. Historical Soci-
ety, and in championing growth for her 
hometown of Lemmon. She was also a life-
time member of the Society of Professional 
Journalists. 
She is survived by her brother Bruce 
Boorman, Santee, California, and numerous 
nieces and nephews. Jane was preceded in 
her death by her parents and a sister, Kath-
erine Becker, Hartford, Wisconsin. 
In remembrance of Jane Boorman’s life, 
the family asks that any charitable dona-
tions be made to WETA, Jane’s favorite clas-
sical music station or to Jewish Social Serv-
ice Agency (JSSA), her amazing hospice care 
team. 
Memorial services will be held in Wash-
ington, D.C. and Lemmon, S.D after the pan-
demic threat has diminished.∑

By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, 
Mr. RUBIO, Ms. CORTEZ MASTO, 
Mr. 
SCOTT
of 
Florida, 
Mr. 
MANCHIN, Ms. COLLINS, and Ms. 
HASSAN): 
S. 391. A bill to amend title 18, 
United States Code, to reauthorize and 
expand the National Threat Assess-
ment Center of the Department of 
Homeland Security; to the Committee 
on the Judiciary. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to reintroduce a bill 
that didn’t get passed last Congress, a 
bill that deals with safety in our 
schools, a bill aimed at the disasters 
that come when schoolchildren are 
killed by shooters and to deal with this 
problem through a program that the 
Secret Service has had for decades and 
asking the Secret Service to see what 
they can do to apply the principles of 
that program to stop mass killings at 
our schools. 
Three years ago, on February 14, 2018, 
an unspeakable tragedy occurred at 
Marjory 
Stoneman 
Douglas 
High 
School in Parkland, FL. In less than 4 
minutes, 14 students and 3 staff mem-
bers were killed, and, consequently, 
their families’ and friends’ lives were 
shattered forever by such a senseless 
act. 
Today, along with my colleagues 
Senators RUBIO and SCOTT of Florida, 
Senators 
CORTEZ
MASTO, 
COLLINS, 
MANCHIN, and HASSAN, I am proud to 
reintroduce 
legislation 
that 
will 
proactively mitigate threats of vio-
lence on school campuses by reauthor-
izing and expanding the U.S. Secret 
Service’s program called the National 
Threat Assessment Center. 
The 
National 
Threat 
Assessment 
Center studies targeted violence and

develops best practices and training to 
identify and manage threats before 
they result in violence like we saw at 
that school 3 years ago. 
The bill establishes a Safe School 
Initiative, 
a 
national 
program 
on 
school violence prevention, that will 
include expanded research on school vi-
olence. Most importantly, this legisla-
tion allows the Secret Service to di-
rectly equip communities and schools 
with training and best practices on rec-
ognizing and preventing school vio-
lence. 
This bill, which I hope will help us to 
recognize the signs of a potential at-
tack way long before such an attack 
occurs, carries the namesake of those 
it couldn’t save, the Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School mascot, so this 
bill is called the EAGLES Act because 
that is the mascot of that school. 
Two years ago, the Secret Service 
conducted a review of school shootings 
and made a very pivotal finding: All 
attackers exhibited concerning behav-
iors prior to engaging in an act of vio-
lence. In other words, it should be easy 
to identify these people, and, if identi-
fied, intervention is possible. So had 
these signs been recognized at an early 
enough stage, these attacks could have 
been stopped. 
In the wake of the Parkland shooting 
in 2018, Congress took steps to protect 
schools and to prevent gun violence, in-
cluding the passage of the Students, 
Teachers, 
and 
Officers 
Preventing 
School Violence Act, which provided 
funding to schools to strengthen their 
infrastructure to make it more dif-
ficult for shooters to enter schools. 
At that same time, we passed the Fix 
NICS Act, a law which penalizes Fed-
eral agencies that fail to comply with 
legal requirements to report dangerous 
individuals and violent criminals to 
the National Instant Criminal Back-
ground Check System so that if they 
are so reported, then they won’t be 
able to purchase a gun. However, by 
passing the EAGLES Act, we are enter-
ing a vital third step in addition to 
those other two bills to protect our 
schools. 
I would like to encourage all of my 
Senate colleagues to support this bi-
partisan and, I think, a very common-
sense bill. I hope that we can focus on 
productive measures like these rather 
than unfocused efforts to undermine 
lawful gun ownership.

f 
OFFICER EUGENE GOODMAN CON-
GRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT 
(On February 12, 2021, the Senate 
passed S. 35, as follows:) 
S. 35 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Officer Eu-
gene Goodman Congressional Gold Medal 
Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) On January 6, 2021, the United States 
Capitol Building was attacked by armed in-
surrectionists. 
(2) Members of the United States Capitol 
Police force were overrun and insurrection-
ists breached the Capitol at multiple points. 
(3) Around 2:14 in the afternoon, United 
States Capitol Police Officer Eugene Good-
man confronted an angry group of insurrec-
tionists who unlawfully entered the Capitol, 
according to video footage taken by Igor 
Bobic, a reporter with the Huffington Post. 
(4) Officer Goodman, alone, delayed the 
mob’s advance towards the United States 
Senate Chamber and alerted his fellow offi-
cers to the location of the insurrectionists. 
(5) Upon reaching a second floor corridor, 
Officer Goodman noticed the entrance to the 
Senate Chamber was unguarded. 
(6) As the mob approached, Officer Good-
man intentionally diverted attention away 
from the Senate entrance and led the mob to 
an alternate location and additional await-
ing officers. 
(7) At 2:15 in the afternoon, a Washington 
Post reporter from inside the Senate Cham-
ber noted ‘‘Senate sealed’’ with Senators, 
staff, and members of the press inside. 
(8) Officer Eugene Goodman’s selfless and 
quick-thinking actions doubtlessly saved 
lives and bought security personnel precious 
time to secure and ultimately evacuate the 
Senate before the armed mob breached the 
Chamber. 
(9) Amidst a shocking, unpatriotic attack 
on the Capitol, Officer Goodman’s heroism is 
recognized not only by Members of Congress 
and staff but also by the people of the United 
States they represent. 
(10) By putting his own life on the line and 
successfully, single-handedly leading insur-
rectionists away from the floor of the Senate 
Chamber, Officer Eugene Goodman per-
formed his duty to protect the Congress with 
distinction, and by his actions, Officer Good-
man left an indelible mark on American his-
tory. 
(11) Officer Goodman’s actions exemplify 
the heroism of the many men and women 
who risked their lives to defend the Capitol 
on January 6, 2021. 
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. 
(a) 
PRESENTATION
AUTHORIZED.—The 
Speaker of the House of Representatives and 
the President pro tempore of the Senate

Secretary. 
(2) IMAGE AND NAME.—The design shall bear 
an image of, and inscription of the name of,

suant to section 3 under such regulations as

cient to cover the cost thereof, including 
labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and 
overhead expenses. 
SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS. 
(a) NATIONAL MEDALS.—The medals struck 
pursuant to this Act are national medals for 
purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United 
States Code.

HONORING BOBBY WITHROW 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the work and service of 
Bobby Withrow. His efforts on behalf of vet-
erans and those in need reflect the very best 
of Texas values. 
Since 2015, Bobby has coordinated and 
managed over 50 benefits and fundraisers for 
a host of community needs, ranging from sup-
porting veterans and cancer patients to assist-
ing those in their hour of need. For Bobby, 
there’s no task too big or too small. Whether 
it’s supporting those who’ve served, feeding 
thousands that are hungry, assisting non-prof-
its with fundraising, or rolling up his sleeves to 
help families with home maintenance, Bobby’s 
not afraid to take on the challenges of helping 
others. 
Public servants like Bobby Withrow make 
Central Texas a place that residents are proud 
to call home. I salute his efforts and am for-
ever grateful for his contributions to veterans 
and those in need.

INTRODUCTION OF THE FRANCIS 
G. 
NEWLANDS 
MEMORIAL 
RE-
MOVAL ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce the Francis G. Newlands Me-
morial Removal Act, which would remove the 
plaque and inscriptions bearing Francis G. 
Newlands’ name from Chevy Chase Circle, a 
federal park located both in the District of Co-
lumbia and Maryland. I am pleased Rep-
resentative JAMIE RASKIN of Maryland joins me 
in introducing this bill. This bill is part of a se-
ries of statue and memorial removal bills I am 
introducing during Black History Month. 
Newlands was a U.S. senator from Nevada, 
a conservationist and the founder of the 
Chevy Chase Land Company, which devel-
oped the Chevy Chase neighborhood that 
touches D.C. and Maryland. Newlands was 
also a segregationist. He built Connecticut Av-
enue and ran a streetcar up the road to the 
newly built Chevy Chase Lake. However, 
homes on Connecticut Avenue were purposely 
priced to keep working families out, and cov-
enants were later added to many of the prop-
erty deeds in Chevy Chase explicitly prohib-
iting the land from ever being owned by Afri-
can Americans or Jews. These covenants 
have since been declared void. 
Newlands went further to keep Black and 
white Americans separate. In the late 1800s, 
he and Senator William Stewart secured 2,000 
acres of land for Rock Creek Park. Estab-
lishing this park not only increased property 
values for landowners like Newlands and 
Stewart, but also kept white communities dis-
tinct from emerging Black communities on 
what they called the ‘‘wrong side of the park.’’ 
Newlands’ racist views went even further. In 
1912, he called for the repeal the 15th amend-
ment, which gave African American men the 
right to vote. 
The fountain was established in 1932 by 
Congress. In 1990, the Chevy Chase Land 
Company also added the plaque next to the 
fountain. A resolution to remove Newlands’ 
name from the fountain was first introduced by 
the D.C. Chevy Chase Advisory Neighborhood 
Commission in 2014. On July 27, 2020, the 
commission voted unanimously to ask the Na-
tional Park Service to remove the bronze 
plaque bearing Newlands’ name and to begin 
discussion on a new name for the fountain. 
This bill would remove Newlands’ name from 
the fountain and remove the plaque entirely. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
ENDING 
CORPORAL 
PUNISHMENT 
IN 
SCHOOLS ACT OF 2021 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce the Ending Corporal Pun-
ishment in Schools Act of 2021. Corporal pun-
ishment is a form of physical discipline where 
adults deliberately inflict pain on children in 
order to punish them. In schools, it typically in-
volves the spanking or paddling of children by 
school officials. 
Corporal punishment is harmful to long term 
child development. These practices are asso-
ciated with physical abuse and ineffective. We 
as leaders should encourage our schools to 
adopt effective discipline strategies that will be 
supportive in reducing corporal punishment. 
Schools must be a safe place where stu-
dents are protected from harm, so that our 
children are able to thrive, grow, and learn. To 
date, corporal punishment in school is banned 
in 128 countries around the world. Sadly, 19 
U.S. states still allow corporal punishments in 
their schools. Over 160,000 children in these 
states are subjected to corporal punishment in 
schools each year. This is abhorrent and un-
acceptable. 
To end this cruel practice, the Ending Cor-
poral Punishment in Schools Act of 2021 
would prohibit any educational institution from 
receiving federal funding that allows school 
personnel to inflict corporal punishment on 
students and creates a new grant program to 
encourage improvements in school climate by 
promoting positive behaviors. 
Madam Speaker, our schools must be a 
safe space for American children to learn. I 
urge my colleagues to join me in supporting 
this critically important bill, and hope to see its 
swift passage in the near future.

RECOGNIZING LINDA DAVIS 
HON. YVETTE HERRELL 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to acknowledge this year’s winner of the 
New Mexico Cattle Growers Association’s 
Green from the Ground Up award, Linda 
Davis. The Cattle Growers Association awards 
this to individuals who display a lifetime of 
service to an in-sync ecosystem of land, 
water, wildlife, and livestock. 
Linda and her husband Les have spent a 
lifetime tending to cattle on the Tequesquite 
and CS Ranch in New Mexico. Ranching has 
always been in her blood. Her great-grand-
father established the Tequesquite Ranch in 
Albert, New Mexico in 1878, and she con-
tinues that legacy for future generations. Linda 
also remains active in her community, where 
she serves with the Cimarron Volunteer Am-
bulance Service as an Emergency Medical 
Technician. 
This is not the first time Linda has been 
honored for her service. In 2000, she and her 
husband were inducted into the Hall of Great 
Westerners at the National Cowboy and West-
ern Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Okla-
homa. Additionally, she has received recogni-
tion from the Cattleman’s Beef Board, the 
Beef Promotion Operating Committee, the 
American National Cattle Women organization, 
The New Mexico Cattle Growers Association, 
and the New Mexico Beef Council. These rec-
ognitions are a testament to her hard work 
and leadership, and I congratulate her on this 
most recent award.

Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise

Mr. Richard ‘‘Dick’’ Franklin Sheppard, born

Oklahoma to California’s Central Valley in the 
early 1930s. Living near Farmersville, Dick 
began working in the fields around the age of

casting at KRDU Radio Station while attending 
high school in Dinuba. 
Dick 
managed 
several 
radio 
stations 
throughout California during his career, return-
ing to the Central Valley as the general sales

before joining the local Sanger newspaper as 
editor. He remained as editor for the Sanger 
Herald until his retirement in 2019. Dick also

Agency and the U.S. Navy Reserve in Dinuba. 
He enjoyed spending time with fellow veterans 
at the Sanger Post 7168 Veterans of Foreign 
Wars and the Sanger Post 98 AMVETS. 
Renowned for his volunteer work and com-
munity involvement, Dick’s legacy will not 
soon be forgotten. He organized an annual 
golf tournament fundraiser as a Golden Valley 
Girl Scout Council Board Member, conducted 
career preparation seminars for Workforce 
Connection, and served as a Family Self Suffi-
ciency Board Member to help struggling fami-
lies achieve economic independence. Dick 
was involved in several other organizations 
serving the Sanger and Fresno area commu-
nities: the Kiwanis Club of Dinuba, the Down-
town Kiwanis Club of Fresno, the Rotary Club 
of the Fresno Airport, the Rotary Club in San-
ger, the Sanger Unified School District Classi-
fied Employees Personnel Commission, the 
Sanger High School Athletic Hall of Fame 
Committee, the Sanger Veterans Parade 
Committee, and the Fresno Radio Advisory 
Committee. 
Dick was awarded several recognitions dur-
ing his lifetime including the American Legion 
Medal for Character, the Sanger Chamber of 
Commerce Hall of Fame, the Gold Seal award 
for community service presented by the San-
ger Chamber of Commerce, and several jour-
nalism awards. Beloved by the Sanger com-
munity, Dick was also honored as the Grand 
Marshal for both the Sanger Veterans Parade 
and Sanger Christmas Parade in 2019. 
Dick is survived by his wife Nadine; their 
children Mark, Cassandra and her husband 
Jack, and Christopher and his wife Petra; and 
stepson Michael and his wife Jessica. Dick is 
also survived by nine grandchildren and nine 
great-grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives to 
join me in honoring the life of Mr. Richard 
‘‘Dick’’ Franklin Sheppard. Our thoughts and 
prayers are with his family and friends during 
this difficult time.

CHIEF GREEN 1 YEAR 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ANTHONY G. BROWN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Mr. BROWN. Madam Speaker, I rise in rec-
ognition of the one-year anniversary of Chief 
Tiffany Green, Chief of Prince George’s Coun-
ty Fire/Emergency Medical Services (EMS) 
Department. In November 2018, County Exec-
utive Angela Alsobrooks made history as the 
first African American woman elected to lead 
a county government in Maryland. Upon 
Prince George’s County’s Fire Chief Benjamin 
Barksdale’s announced retirement, County Ex-
ecutive Alsobrooks appointed Chief Green 
who became the First African American 
Woman to lead a fire department in the history 
of the State of Maryland and only the 9th Afri-
can American Woman to hold the position of 
fire chief in the United States of America. She 
inherited a department with a call volume of 
152,000, a total of 638 pieces of apparatus 
(including command and support vehicles) 
with 266 specifically outfitted for fire suppres-
sion, rescue, or emergency transport. 
Tiffany D. Green, a native Prince Georgian, 
began her career as a firefighter with the 
Prince George’s County Fire/EMS Department 
in March of 1999, after serving as a volunteer 
for the Oxon Hill Volunteer Fire Department 
for four years. As an almost 26-year fire serv-
ices veteran, Tiffany holds dual bachelor’s de-
grees in Public Safety and Biology and a mas-
ter’s degree in Emergency and Disaster Man-
agement. Climbing up the ranks, she has 
served in the following capacities prior to her 
role as a Command Staff member: Firefighter, 
Paramedic, Station Commander, Executive 
Assistant to the Deputy Chief Administrative 
Officer for Public Safety, Chief of Staff for the 
Director of Homeland Security, Special Events 
Coordinator and Stadium Commander for Fed 
Ex field. 
As Deputy Fire Chief she was responsible 
for Human Resources, Fiscal Affairs, Informa-
tion Management, Risk Management and the 
Office of Service Excellence, Accreditation & 
Research. As Director of the Prince George’s 
County Fire/EMS Training and Leadership 
Academy, her primary responsibilities were 
training and professional development for over 
900 sworn personnel and 1,200 volunteer 
members of the department. She also man-
aged the High School Fire Science (Cadet) 
Program, a program for high school students 
who are interested in working in the Fire Serv-
ices profession. 
On January 15, 2020, Chief Green’s nomi-
nation was unanimously approved following a 
review of her exemplary over 20 years of serv-
ice, her impressive record and support from 
many public safety and government officials. 
Chief 
Green 
made 
history 
as 
Prince 
George’s County’s first woman, first dual fire 
fighter/paramedic and youngest fire chief. 
County Executive Alsobrooks, in her nomina-
tion, made sure to emphasize Green’s wealth 
of experience and high ranking on each and 
every promotional exam—the lieutenant’s test, 
the captain’s exam, and battalion chief’s 
exam. 
According 
to 
County 
Executive 
Alsobrooks, Chief Green is far and away the 
most qualified person to lead the Prince 
George’s County Fire/EMS Department at this 
time. 
According to Chief Green, her decision to 
serve her community as a volunteer fire fighter 
‘‘changed the trajectory of [her] life.’’ She rec-
ognizes the women whose shoulders she is 
standing on today. ‘‘Pioneers’’ like Maureen 
Hennessy, Angela Peden and the late Carla 
Blue who gave Chief Green their Keys to Suc-
cess. And, Chief Green has vowed to ‘‘lead 
this department forward, to continue to be ac-
countable, professional and community-cen-
tered.’’ 
Her leadership of the 1,062 Sworn and 
1,500 volunteers has already proven to be a 
success on a national level. The Congres-
sional Fire Services Institute and National Fall-
en Firefighters Foundation selected the Prince 
George’s County Fire and Emergency Medical 
Services Department as the combination fire 
department recipient of the 2020 Senator Paul 
S. Sarbanes Fire Service Safety Leadership 
Award, named in honor of the late former 
Maryland Senator Paul Sarbanes. The award 
recognizes fire departments and organizations 
for leadership in advancing firefighter health 
and safety, who have developed important 
health and safety programs for their personnel 
that are based on the 16 Firefighter Life Safe-
ty Initiatives established at the 2004 Tampa 
Summit. 
Congratulations to Chief Green on this mo-
mentous occasion, and much appreciation to 
her husband Alfred, and daughter Talore, for 
sharing her with Prince Georges County.

EFFORTS 
TO 
MODERNIZE 
AND 
STRENGTHEN 
MULTIEMPLOYER 
PENSION PLANS 
HON. SHARICE DAVIDS 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, 
I’d like to thank my colleague, Chairman RICH-
ARD NEAL for his tireless work on the Butch 
Lewis Emergency Pension Plan Relief Act of 
2021 and for providing retirement income se-
curity for pension recipients in endangered, 
critical or critical and declining status multiem-
ployer pension plans. 
In Kansas, thousands of retirees currently 
receive pensions through the Central States 
Plan and they face a crisis—a severe reduc-
tion in retirement income through no fault of 
their own. 
Without the direct relief provided in this leg-
islation, the Central States Pension Fund 
would have become insolvent in 2026 and the 
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation would 
have to reduce 360,000 participants’ pensions 
to pennies. This is unacceptable. As Chairman 
NEAL is all too aware, many of the participants 
of Central States are frontline workers who 
have served our country tirelessly and fear-
lessly in the face of the pandemic. 
The present structure of these plans is 
unsustainable and in need of reform. 
Without modernization of these plans and 
addressing employer liabilities, I am con-
cerned that multiemployer pension plans and 
their retirees will certainly face similar cir-
cumstances in the future and require addi-
tional federal funds. This much needed relief 
to the plans is designed to forestall insolvency 
leaving important work that must follow. I be-
lieve we must seize this opportunity to reform 
these plans and take insolvency off the table. 
I understand the Chairman is committed to 
working with me to modernize and strengthen 
multiemployer pension plans with the intent of 
bringing a reform package to the floor in this 
Congress. Could the Chairman confirm that is 
the case?

Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, too many work-
ers in this nation reach retirement age without 
the savings they need. The retirement crisis in 
America is real and will only worsen unless we 
make saving easier and do more to encourage 
workers to begin planning for retirement ear-
lier. And that’s why I’ve committed as the

Chairman of the Ways & Means Committee to 
addressing this crisis. 
For example, about 50 percent of American 
workers work for an employer that does not 
offer a retirement plan at work. To make a sig-
nificant dent in this coverage gap, it’s critical 
that we enact legislation that requires employ-
ers that don’t currently offer a retirement plan 
to at a minimum provide their employees with 
an auto IRA option. 
I’m also pleased that the American Rescue 
Plan Act includes the Butch Lewis Emergency 
Pension Plan Relief Act of 2021, which would 
create a special financial assistance program 
under which cash payments would be made 
by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation 
to financially troubled multiemployer pension 
plans to ensure that such plans can continue 
paying retirees’ benefits for the next 30 years. 
What we have here is a national emergency 
that we need to address immediately. If Con-
gress doesn’t act, the multiemployer pension 
system could collapse entirely, leaving retirees 
in poverty, businesses in bankruptcy, and 
communities in crisis. 
Reform for both the multiemployer and sin-
gle employer retirement plan system is a pri-
ority for the Ways and Means committee and 
we plan on addressing these issues this year. 
I commit to working with Ms. DAVIDS on this 
as we move forward.

RESOLUTION CONDEMNING ANTI- 
ASIAN SENTIMENT AS RELATED 
TO COVID–19 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, it has been 
over a year since we have seen continued 
COVID–19 related threats and attacks against 
the Asian American and Pacific Islander com-
munity. As millions across our nation continue 
to be impacted by the coronavirus, many con-
tinue to live in fear following the dramatic in-
crease of threats and attacks against those of 
Asian descent. Recently, we have seen further 
escalation of horrific incidences of elderly 
AAPIs assaulted—resulting in even death. 
Due to perpetuating anti-Asian rhetoric, mis-
information, racism, discrimination, and un-
founded blame for the spread of COVID–19, 
there has been over 3,000 reported incidents 
of anti-Asian hate crimes, including AAPIs 
being threatened, harassed, or assaulted, or 
having had their businesses vandalized. Just 
recently, in my district of Flushing, New York, 
a 52-year-old Asian woman was attacked and 
forcefully shoved while waiting in line outside 
of a bakery—resulting in her needing ten 
stitches on her head. Additionally, a 61-year- 
old Filipino man was viciously attacked and 
slashed across his face on a New York City 
subway. 
It breaks my heart that, for over a year, in 
the midst of the COVID–19 crisis, Asian Amer-
icans have been left fighting an additional 
front—that of hate and bigotry. 
That is why I am reintroducing my resolution 
condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment 
as related to COVID–19. This resolution de-
nounces the anti-Asian sentiment and recog-
nizes the safety and well-being of all Ameri-
cans during these unprecedented times. 
Madam Speaker, I was proud that in the last 
Congress, the House passed this resolution 
243 to 164. However, in light of the recent 
dramatic increase of anti-Asian hate incidents 
across our country, we must coalesce and 
renew our efforts to condemn all manifesta-
tions of racism, xenophobia, discrimination, 
and anti-Asian sentiment and scapegoating. 
We must denounce any and all anti-Asian 
sentiment of any form. 
Madam Speaker, the House must remain 
strong, and stand against the sickening intoler-
ance, bigotry, and violence that is leaving a 
terrible stain on our nation’s history, especially 
during this moment of an unprecedented pub-
lic health crisis. I urge my colleagues to join 
me in this effort to keep all Americans safe.

HONORING GARY CREED 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Gary Creed of Shawsville, Virginia, 
who passed away on January 28, 2021 at the 
age of 74. Gary was a member of the Mont-
gomery County Board of Supervisors for sev-
eral terms who worked hard for the people of 
the county. 
Gary was the son of Melvin Lewis and Ada 
Mae Moore Creed. He was elected to the 
Board of Supervisors in 2001 as the rep-
resentative of District C. He promoted the 
Meadowbrook Montgomery-Floyd Regional Li-
brary and the Meadowbrook Community Cen-
ter, supported first responders, and success-
fully pushed to reduce the merchants capital 
tax, a move that eased a burden on local busi-
nesses without depriving the county of rev-
enue. Gary served as Chairman of the Board 
in 2004. He retired in 2017. In the town of 
Elliston, part of District C, a park currently 
under construction has been named after him 
in honor of his service. 
Gary was a longtime employee at the 
Shelor Motor Mile auto dealership and had 
also worked as an auctioneer and real estate 
developer. He loved the sport of basketball 
and coached Amateur Athletic Union girls bas-
ketball. 
Gary is survived by his wife, Linda Creed; 
son Tim Creed and wife Barbara; daughter 
Niki Shumate and husband John; brothers 
Wilford Creed and Clyde Creed; sister Eliza-
beth 
Brammer; 
granddaughters 
Bridgette 
Bradley 
and 
husband 
James, 
Karalee 
Boggess and husband Mark, Karli Shumate, 
and Lauryn Shumate; and great-grandchildren 
Jaxon, Jacob, Holt, Boone, and Allie. I offer 
them my condolences on their loss. Our sys-
tem of government depends on citizens such 
as Gary Creed, who take on the tasks of local 
government in order to improve their commu-
nities.

RECOGNIZING DINA CHACON- 
REITZEL 
HON. YVETTE HERRELL 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to acknowledge this year’s winner of the 
New Mexico Cattle Growers Association’s 
King Service award, Dina Chacon-Reitzel. 
This award is given to New Mexicans that 
have exhibited long standing dedication to the 
state’s agricultural industry and those who 
work within it. Born into the agricultural life, 
Dina grew up on a cattle ranch that has been 
in her family for hundreds of years. She has 
spent most of her career with the New Mexico 
Beef Council, where she fought to protect the 
cattle industry and pioneered implementations 
of consumer information programs, as well as 
additional research within the beef industry. 
Dina’s advocacy spans from local entities, 
where she is involved with the New Mexico 4– 
H Foundation, all the way to the Federal gov-
ernment. She currently braves the Washington 
bureaucracy to advocate for the New Mexico 
State University College of ACES, where she 
serves as a citizen advocate for the USDA 
Council for Agricultural Research, Extension 
and Teaching. 
This is not the first time Dina’s efforts have 
been recognized. As a chairwoman on the 
New Mexico State University’s Board of Re-
gents she was awarded the New Mexico Out-
standing Leadership Award for significant 
leadership towards agriculture. She was also 
given the Friend of Extension Award and was 
the recipient of the Distinguished Alumni 
Award by the New Mexico State University. 
She was also recognized by the New Mexico 
Department of Agriculture with the Industry 
Partner Award. 
Dina have exhibited the upmost dedication 
and leadership to the state of New Mexico and 
its agricultural industry, and I congratulate her 
on this award.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND 
LEGACY OF DR. MELVIN BANKS 
HON. BOBBY L. RUSH 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate and commemorate the life and 
works of Dr. Melvin Banks, the founder of 
Urban Ministries, Incorporated. A prodigious 
soul, by the age of 12, Dr. Banks was already 
spreading the word of the gospel throughout 
his native state of Alabama, sharing stories of 
the Bible with younger children. It was when 
he was preaching in Birmingham that Dr. 
Banks heard a verse from the Book of Hosea 
that would change his life ‘‘My people are de-
stroyed for lack of knowledge.’’ Hearing this 
verse caused Dr. Banks to even further dedi-
cate himself to spreading the gospel across 
the country and the world. 
Dr. Banks’ study of the Bible would take him 
to Chicago’s Moody Bible Institute, where he 
was one of the institution’s few Black students, 
graduating in 1955. However, Dr. Banks’ edu-
cation as a Christian in Chicago would not 
revolve solely around the classroom. At the 
urging of a chapel speaker, Dr. Banks visited 
a Brethren church on the city’s South Side. 
This experience led him to the vital realization 
that he didn’t need to diminish his blackness 
to live the fullest Christian life that he could. 
There, Dr. Banks would also meet and marry 
Olive Perkins, who would remain his partner 
throughout his life. He then continued his 
theological education in the Chicagoland area

February 23, 2021 
at Wheaton College, earning a bachelor’s de-
gree in theology in 1958 and a master’s de-
gree in biblical studies in 1960. 
When working for a Christian publishing 
company after completing his degrees at 
Wheaton College, Dr. Banks found that he 
often struggled to sell the company’s Sunday 
School curriculum to Black churches. The ma-
terial was written by white authors and told 
solely from a white perspective. Black church-
es believed that their students may not be 
able to relate to it. This realization led Dr. 
Banks to a truly visionary idea: why not create 
a Sunday School curriculum that would reso-
nate with the Black experience? It was with 
this idea in mind that Dr. Banks launched Uni-
versal Ministries, Inc., with the mission of mak-
ing the Bible more relatable to Black Sunday 
School students. 
Beginning in his Chicago basement in 1970, 
Dr. Banks steadily grew Universal Ministries, 
Inc. to the point where it is today, with a cus-
tomer base of over 40,000 for the company’s 
Christian education resources. Thanks to the 
work of Universal Ministries, Inc., hundreds of 
thousands of Black Christians can see them-
selves and their experiences reflected in the 
texts of their faith. So titanic are the accom-
plishments of Universal Ministries, Inc., that 
the Evangelical Christian Publishers Associa-
tion awarded Dr. Banks with their inaugural 
Kenneth N. Taylor Lifetime Achievement 
Award in 2017. 
Madam Speaker, Dr. Banks passed away 
on February 13, 2021. His life’s work con-
tinues through Universal Ministries, Inc., and 
the thousands of students who will benefit 
from the curriculums he assembled. He is sur-
vived by his wife Olive and three children, 
Melvin Jr., Patrice Lee, and Reginald. My 
deepest thoughts and prayers go out to Dr. 
Banks’s friends, family, and all those who had 
the privilege to benefit, spiritually and emotion-
ally, from his life’s mission.

HONORING DELTA SIGMA THETA 
SORORITY INC. KAPPA CHAPTER 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Delta Sigma Theta Sorority 
Inc., Kappa Chapter on their Centennial anni-
versary. 
Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. was found-
ed in 1913 by 22 collegiate women at Howard 
University and is now an international sister-
hood of over 350,000 predominantly Black, 
college educated women who are dedicated to 
providing public service through education, 
community outreach, and development in their 
communities across the globe. 
On February 21, 1921, Kappa Chapter of 
Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. was charted. 
It became the first Black Greek-letter organiza-
tion west of the Rocky Mountains. 100 years 
ago, during a time when universities across 
the country refused to admit Black students, 
seven dedicated and dauntless women from 
UC Berkeley, San Francisco State, and San 
Jose State came together to charter Delta 
Sigma Theta Sorority Inc., Kappa Chapter. 
Vivian Osborne Marsh, Gladys Brown, Creola 
Cook, Elizabeth Gordon, Louise Thompson 
Patterson, Onilda Taylor, and Myrtle Price. 
They remained a ‘‘city-wide’’ chapter until 
the 1960’s. 
The 
chapter’s 
first 
President, 
Vivian 
Osborne Marsh, went on to become Delta 
Sigma Theta Sorority Inc.’s 7th National Presi-
dent. Throughout her life she worked to pro-
mote literacy and provide opportunities for un-
derprivileged teenagers and children. In honor 
of her service and their Centennial Kappa 
Chapter has created the ‘‘Vivian Osborne 
Marsh, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc., Kappa 
Chapter Endowed Scholarship Fund.’’ This is 
the first endowed scholarship created by any 
Greek Letter Organization at UC Berkeley. 
The $100,000 fund will generate scholarships 
for Black students at UC Berkeley for years to 
come. 
Over the last 100 years Kappa Chapter and 
its members have continued a legacy of serv-
ice to the Black community and to those in 
need. Current members have made excep-
tional efforts to promote health for women of 
color, social justice, professionalism, and the 
empowerment of Black women on campus in 
the greater community. Kappa Chapter has 
gone above and beyond to engage and inform 
the community by hosting programs that dis-
cuss important topics likes COVID–19, Holistic 
Health, Black love, relationships, womanhood, 
empowerment, de-stigmatizing HIV/AIDS in 
the Black Community, and social justice. 
Today we celebrate 100 years of commit-
ment to change. From the legacy of Kappa 
Chapter’s charter members to its current 
membership and newest initiates Karsyn 
Terry, Christine Harris, Symone Gilliam, and 
Robynne Oliver the legacy continues to grow. 
On behalf of California’s 13th Congressional 
District, I want to extend my sincere congratu-
lations on this important milestone of 100 
years. I thank Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, 
Inc., Kappa Chapter for their commitment to 
sisterhood, scholarship, and service. Their his-
tory of empowering black women will forever 
be important to Black history and I look for-
ward to witnessing the accomplishments that 
will define your next 100 years.

BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT TO THE 
SACRAMENTO-SAN 
JOAQUIN 
DELTA 
NATIONAL 
HERITAGE 
AREA 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce legislation to adjust the Congres-
sional designated boundary of the Sac-
ramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage 
Area. 
In March 2019, Congress enacted into law 
(Public Law 116–9) my legislation with U.S. 
Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN designating Califor-
nia’s first national heritage area. The Delta is 
a crown jewel of our state and an iconic work-
ing landscape, which my family has been for-
tunate to call home for over 40 years. It is the 
most productive watershed in the western 
United States and among the most eco-
logically important in the Western Hemisphere. 
Together, we must safeguard the Delta and 
the historic communities that make it such a 
special place. 
The legislation I introduce today, at the re-
quest of the City of Rio Vista, would expand 
the National Heritage Area’s boundary to in-
clude approximately 62 acres of adjacent pub-
licly owned land encompassing: the decom-
missioned United States Army Reserve Center 
(City of Rio Vista), U.S. Coast Guard Station 
Rio Vista, Beach Drive Wastewater Treatment 
Plant (City of Rio Vista), and Sandy Beach 
County Park (Solano County). 
Two of these parcels—the decommissioned 
United States Army Reserve Center and 
Beach Drive Wastewater Treatment Plant— 
are owned by the City of Rio Vista but tech-
nically outside the city limits. As such, it ap-
pears that these parcels were omitted inad-
vertently when the National Park Service pre-
pared the legislative map for the then-pro-
posed Delta National Heritage Area in 2010. 
I hope that Congress will enact my bound-
ary adjustment before California’s Delta Pro-
tection Commission completes the manage-
ment plan for the National Heritage Area.

RECOGNIZING SATIA AUSTIN AS 
CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor to recognize North San Diego 
County NAACP President Satia Austin, as my 
Constituent of the Month for February. Every 
February, we celebrate Black History Month, 
and this year, I am honored to highlight Satia 
as an incredible member of my community. 
From an early age, Satia’s parents stressed 
the importance of education, personal respon-
sibility, and achievement. These values be-
came her guiding principles as she pursued 
her passion through a career in youth advo-
cacy and activism. As the current President of 
the North San Diego County NAACP, the 
State Advisor for the Youth and College Divi-
sion for California and Hawaii, and the Adult 
Representative for Region I of the National 
NAACP Youth Works Committee, Satia uses 
her resources and platform to help guide 
young adults into the professional world. In-
stilling each of the same core values she was 
raised on, Satia’s dedication to the betterment 
of local youth ensures African Americans and 
other people of color in the District aren’t con-
fined to their circumstances and can achieve 
success in their adult lives. 
This past year, we experienced a nation-
wide awakening to systemic racism in Amer-
ica. We have much more work to do to con-
front inequality in our country, but I’m thankful 
for residents like Satia who are passionate 
about helping underserved youth succeed. As 
we continue to come together to address ra-
cial injustice, leaders like Satia bring me hope 
and inspiration. I am honored to recognize her 
as my Constituent of the Month.

and service of Paul Woods who celebrated his 
98th birthday on February 20, 2021. Along 
with defying the average lifespan and despite 
segregation, Paul Woods fought for our de-
mocracy in the Pacific Theater of World War 
II. As we celebrate Black History Month, I 
think there’s no better example of American 
courage than Buffalo’s own Paul Woods. 
Paul Woods was born in Alabama on Feb-
ruary 20, 1923 in an era of racial oppression 
and segregation. When his father died, he and 
siblings were split at the gravesite among rel-
atives. Paul Woods promised that he would 
raise his brother Sherman, and for the rest of 
his life ‘‘Daddy’’ has been taking care of peo-
ple. 
Paul Woods joined the segregated U.S. 
Army in 1941 when he was just 17 years old. 
He often says that ‘‘A bullet knows no race, 
rank, or status. We were all brothers on the 
battlefield.’’ The bravery of Black units over-
seas belied their second-class status at home 
and helped lead to the abolition of racial seg-
regation in the military in 1948 as well as the 
passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
In 2012, Paul and 30 other World War II 
vets were flown to the World War II Memorial 
in Washington, D.C. Five years later, Wish of 
a Lifetime sponsored a trip to Australia where 
he visited the exact location of his service dur-
ing World War II and was thanked by the U.S. 
Consul General. Today he is the World War II 
Coordinator for the Jesse Clipper American 
Legion Post 430. 
After helping to protect the Philippines, Paul 
Woods moved to the Buffalo region where he 
worked 16-hour days at Bethlehem Steel to 
feed his growing family. From Alabama to 
Australia, teenage recruit to war hero, and 
segregated soldier to seeing the first Black 
president, Paul Woods’ life has spanned con-
tinents, a world war, and the fight for racial 
equality. The father of 15 turned 98 on Feb-
ruary 20, 2021 having seen multiple children 
and grandchildren serve in the same military 
his bravery helped to desegregate. 
Madam Speaker, I am thankful for the 
chance to honor Paul Woods, a longtime 
Western New York resident who helped free 
the Philippines despite enduring injustice at 
home. A proud member of Prince of Peace 
Church of God in Christ in Buffalo and hus-
band to the late Mary T. Woods, Paul Woods’ 
6′ 4″ stature is dwarfed only by his impact on 
his family, community, and country.

IN RECOGNITION OF PHIL WEBB 
AND THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
WEBB CONCRETE 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I ask for the House’s attention to recognize 
Phil Webb and the 75th anniversary of Webb 
Concrete. 
In 1946, Garth Webb started Farmers Sup-
ply Company in Heflin, Alabama. It began as 
a seed, fertilizer and hardware business and 
later a ready-mix concrete, sand and gravel 
company. In 1980, Phil bought the company 
from his father, Bobby. Since then, Phil has 
grown the company and added a flooring divi-
sion in 2006. Today, the company offers mate-
rials to complete a project from the foundation 
to completion. 
Webb Concrete serves East Central Ala-
bama in six locations and has showrooms to 
give customers a first-hand look at everything 
Webb Concrete offers. 
In addition to growing his family company, 
Phil is best known for his service to his com-
munity. He is involved on the board of direc-
tors for many organizations including Alabama 
Power, Greater Birmingham Association of 
Home Builders, also, serving as its Govern-
mental Affairs Advocacy Vice-Chair, Calhoun 
County Home Builders Association, University 
of Alabama President’s Cabinet and Capital 
Campaign Cabinet, JSU Foundation, JSU

TRIBUTE TO BEN MONTGOMERY 
‘‘A GOOD MAN’’ 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a good man. 
Mr. Benny M. Montgomery. Benny was born 
and raised on the Westside of Chicago, grad-
uated from Farragut High School with honors 
and attended Roosevelt University where he 
received a bachelor’s degree in Public Admin-
istration. Benny was always interested in Pub-
lic Affairs and started work with Congress-
woman Cardiss Collins where he remained for 
16 years until she retired. In 1997, Benny 
began work for and with Congressman DANNY 
K. DAVIS when he became a legend among 
social activists, health activist, and especially 
HIV-AIDS activists. Benny was as solid as a 
rock, had a very creative mind and used his 
talents to the utmost. He was a key organizer 
of the Westside Aids Task Force, worked with 
other HIV groups such as Howard Brown, the 
Ruth Rothstein Core Center, did training and 
Sunday afternoon forums at churches. Ben 
became the voice and face, the black leader 
of the fight against AIDS and HIV in the 7th 
District and citywide. Benny Montgomery, 
Mark Loveless, and Michael O’Conner be-
came known as the 3 musketeers in the fight 
against AIDS. Ben came up with the Red Rib-
bon Lottery Ticket as a way of raising money 
for HIV-AIDS awareness organizations whose 
budgets were 100,000 dollars or less. The first 
year it generated 1.4 million and the second 
year 2.4 million. Ben helped create and led 
the 7th CD Task Force on Fathers and Fami-
lies. Today it is a full fledged 501 C3 Tax Ex-
empt Organization under the leadership of 
Rev. Walter Jones. After 31 years of working 
for the U.S. House of Representatives, Ben 
retired at the age of 48, but kept working until 
the Lord ordered his steps to cease on De-
cember 13, 2020 at the age of 58, may he 
rest in peace. 
The Bible says that the steps of a good man 
are ordered by the Lord.

IN HONOR OF BILLIE HOLIDAY’S 
LIFE AND LEGACY 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the extraordinary 
achievements in the life of Billie Holiday—a 
gifted vocalist, a dedicated activist, and a cul-
tural icon. 
Billie Holiday’s story is one of perseverance 
and resiliency. Born into modest means and 
harsh circumstances, she suffered through a 
dark and difficult childhood in the face of pov-
erty, parental absence, and trauma. But it was 
music—specifically, that of Louis Armstrong 
and Bessie Smith—that reignited her dimming 
spark. Through song, she found the uncanny 
ability to express her pain through her true 
voice. And what a voice it was. 
Amid heightened racial tensions in the 
1930s, Billie Holiday introduced a new genre 
of protest—melody. In her hit rendition of 
‘‘Strange Fruit,’’ she posed an unapologetic 
and uncensored challenge to the injustice of 
lynching of black Americans at one of the 
darkest moments of history in our nation. Bur-
dened by the weight of the song’s message 
and facing public backlash, she continued to 
perform and record it to reach a greater audi-
ence. Despite the vitriolic backlash, Strange 
Fruit quickly became the unofficial anthem of 
the anti-lynching movement and was an early 
mantra towards the success of the larger civil 
rights movement. 
Madam Speaker, until her passing at only 
44 years old, Billie Holiday had already estab-
lished a legacy that would survive for genera-
tions to come. As she fortuitously predicted, 
her lyrics remain a main stay in modern pop 
culture. May we be confident in her everlasting 
influence, because ‘‘life dies but forever there 
will be music.’’

the life of Juanita Varnado Pierce. She passed 
on February 7, 2021 at the age 83. 
Juanita (affectionately called Neat) was born 
to the late Howard and Maggie Lee Varnado 
and grew up in McComb, Mississippi. Her 
early education was at Pike County High 
School in McComb. She graduated high 
school at 15 and attended Henderson Busi-
ness College in Memphis, Tennessee. She 
graduated 
from 
Tuskegee 
Institute, 
now 
Tuskegee University, in 1974 with a B.S. in 
Early Childhood Education and from Auburn 
University with a Master’s in Early Childhood 
Education in 1975. 
She started teaching 2nd grade at Dean 
Road Elementary School in Auburn, Alabama, 
in August of 1975 and taught 2nd grade for 17 
years. After completing her Administration 
Certification from the University of Alabama, 
she was hired as the Assistant Principal at 
Dean Road Elementary in the Fall of 1992 and 
became Principal in Fall of 1996. She retired 
in the Fall of 1998. As a retired educator, she 
volunteered throughout Tuskegee in the local 
school system reading to young children. To 
ensure all children had access to books, she 
founded the Bookmobile which was a remade 
bread truck she purchased and drove it 
throughout Macon County giving free books to 
children. Continuing in her passion of edu-
cating and reading, Juanita established the 
S.M.A.R.T. (Science, Math, Art, Reading and 
Technology) Camp in 2005. Funded by grants 
and donations, this free two-week camp was 
started at Washington Chapel A.M.E. Church 
with approximately 40 students and today is 
held at George Washington Carver Elemen-
tary School due to the large size of partici-
pants. 
Juanita was a devoted member of Wash-
ington Chapel A.M.E. Church. After joining in 
1960, she started teaching the pre-school 
Sunday School class and remained the teach-
er for nearly 50 years. She served in the Ca-
thedral and Gospel Choirs, the Stewardess 
Board and Steward Board. 
She was preceded in death by her husband 
of 44 years, Booker T. Pierce, Sr.; her sisters 
Patricia Varnado and Artis Varnado; and a 
brother, Charles Varnado. Remaining to con-
tinue her legacy are her three children, Booker 
T. Pierce, Jr. (Nashville, TN); Vincent B. 
Pierce (St. Louis, MO) and Lisa (Bernard) P. 
Grant (Alexandria, VA); two grandchildren, 
Nicholas Bernard Grant (Newport News, VA) 
and Dominque Pierce (Pompano Beach, FL); 
her sister Lottie (Harrison) Varnado-Williams 
(Diamondhead, MS) and one brother Howard 
Varnado, Jr. (Milpitas, CA); two brothers-in- 
law, Fletcher (Sylvia) Pierce (McCormick, SC) 
and James Pierce (Montgomery, AL), two sis-
ters-in-law, Cebell Miller (Griffin, GA) and Rox-
anne Pierce (Bessemer, AL); and a host of 
devoted cousins, nieces, nephews and friends. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Juanita’s memory. She was a humble 
servant who gave willingly and unconditionally 
to everyone she encountered. She will be 
missed by her family, friends and the 
Tuskegee Community. 
TRIBUTE TO MRS. MARY ELLA 
HARRIS 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD the following 
Proclamation. 
Whereas, the Almighty God has called to 
her eternal rest Mrs. Mary Ella Harris, a pio-
neer civic, community, social, religious and po-
litical activist in the North Lawndale Commu-
nity of Chicago and its environs; and 
Whereas, Mary Harris and her family were 
some of the very first blacks to move into and 
reside in what was then an all white commu-
nity; and 
Whereas, as the community changed and 
as Blacks poured in, many from the rural 
south, Mary’s leadership shined like the bright 
light that she was; and 
Whereas, Mary was not necessarily the 
loudest and most militant sounding person in 
the meetings she was always there and when 
she spoke, people listened and took action 
based upon what she said. For many years 
Carey Tercentenary AME Church was blessed 
to have four of its members known as leading 
activist and leaders in the Lawndale Commu-
nity: Mrs. Nola Bright, Mrs. Jacqueline Ford, 
Mr. Theodis Leonard and Mrs. Mary Ella Har-
ris. 
Now, therefore be it Resolved that we cher-
ish the life, work, contributions and legacy of 
Mrs. Mary Ella Harris and extend condolences 
to her family and friends, son, Reverend Wal-
ter Harris, daughters, Ms. Jeanetta Lee, Ms. 
Pamela Ella and son, James Leo Jr., grand-
children, great grandchildren and other rel-
atives. 
She served us well and now may she rest 
in peace.

JERSEY’S 
HIGHTSTOWN 
HIGH SCHOOL 
HON. BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 23, 2021 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speak-
er, I am delighted to send my sincere con-
gratulations and heartfelt thanks to the mem-
bers of Thespian Troupe 3991 at Hightstown 
High School for their incredible efforts in col-
lecting 84 pounds of food for Rise Food Pan-
try as part of New Jersey Trick or Treat So 
Kids Can Eat. The dedication that they have 
shown to this program—from re-creating a na-
tional initiative at the state level so they can 
continue fighting childhood hunger, to achiev-
ing such tremendous feats in their 2020 food 
drive—is a true testament to the character and 
focus of their members. 
Whether this drive is their last, their first, 
one of many, or the only one that they will 
participate in, I hope that they can feel the im-
pact that they have had on the community 
they live in, and that they remember that they 
are always capable of such impact. I applaud 
them on this achievement, and I look forward 
to all that they will accomplish in their futures. 
Again, Congratulations.
