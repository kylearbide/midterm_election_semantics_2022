WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2020 
No. 203 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 2 p.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Loving and gracious God, we give 
You thanks for giving us another day. 
Help us this day to draw closer to 
You, so that with Your spirit and 
aware of Your presence among us, we 
may all face the tasks of this day. 
Bless the Members of the people’s 
House. Help them to think clearly, 
speak 
confidently, 
and 
act 
coura-
geously in the belief that all noble 
service is based upon patience, truth, 
and love. 
You know well the pressing issues 
facing our Nation, most particularly 
the COVID pandemic. Local and State 
resources 
have 
been 
overwhelmed 
throughout. Grant our national lead-
ers, especially, the wisdom and magna-
nimity to do what is best, and may we 
all join in a common will for the ben-
efit of all constituencies, even though 
this will take some sacrifice. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
4(a) of House Resolution 967, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from Nevada (Mr. HORSFORD) come for-
ward and lead the House in the Pledge 
of Allegiance. 
Mr. HORSFORD led the Pledge of Al-
legiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
EXPIRING UNEMPLOYMENT 
INSURANCE PROVISIONS 
(Mr. HORSFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, 
this global pandemic has devastated 
Nevada’s economy, forcing thousands 
of Nevadans to be laid off from work. 
Nevada’s unemployment rate was 
last reported to be 11.8 percent. My 
hometown of North Las Vegas reported 
the State’s highest unemployment rate 
at 14.6 percent. 
Nevada’s families are hurting. 
Constituents contact my office every 
single day about their unemployment 
insurance concerns, especially regard-
ing the Federal unemployment com-
pensation benefits which expire at the 
end of this month. 
Now that this pandemic is ravaging 
our country again, many States and lo-
calities are considering more stay-at- 
home orders. 
We in Congress must act to make 
sure Americans who are unable to work 
because of this virus receive the Fed-
eral unemployment compensation that 
they need to survive until we get a vac-
cine that is free and available to every-
one. 
It is my hope that any COVID relief 
package that becomes law provides ex-
tended unemployment insurance bene-
fits, direct cash payments, and addi-
tional State and local funding so that 
we can provide support to people who 
need it the most. 
f 
TRUMP COATTAILS APPRECIATED 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the defeated Democrat can-
didate for Senate acknowledged South 
Carolina Republicans swept to remark-
able victories on the local, State, and 
Federal levels due to the coattails of 
President Donald Trump and Vice 
President MIKE PENCE, providing the 
largest Republican majorities at every 
level in 140 years. 
Despite biased fake news, our citizens 
appreciate the lowest unemployment 
in history for African Americans, His-
panics, and Asian Americans, with the 
highest employment ever for women 
and youth. 
Peace through strength has been 
maintained with rebuilding the mili-
tary, and Promises Made Promises 
Kept, the American Embassy is now in 
Jerusalem. 
Out-of-State contributions of unlim-
ited millions to Democrats enriched 
political 
consultants 
as 
Democrats 
lost, while outspending every Repub-
lican. 
Senator LINDSEY
GRAHAM
survived 
the over $150 million onslaught in 
America’s most expensive Senate race. 
The most expensive House race ever 
led 
to 
Congresswoman-elect 
Nancy 
Mace becoming the first female Repub-
lican Federal official in history. 
My opponent spent 15 times more 
than my prior opponent to receive the 
exact vote of 42 percent. 
We appreciate the voters. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism.

special woman, Lavonna Lemons. She 
was a tough Kansas woman who spent 
most of her 71 years helping out other 
people. 
You see, she was a rape counselor. 
She also helped at a homeless mission, 
and she took in abused children. She 
would often open her home to anyone 
in need. 
She was a fearless fighter, and the 
world is a better place because of it. 
On behalf of so many you helped, on 
behalf of my family, particularly my 
mother, Barbara; two of my dear 
friends; your daughters, Lora and Leia; 
from the floor of the United States 
House of Representatives to you in 
Heaven: We love you. We miss you. We 
will see you soon. God bless.

CONGRATULATING TRUITT 
EAVENSON 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Truitt 
Eavenson from Carnesville, Georgia, on 
his retirement after 36 amazing years 
at Georgia Power. 
Truitt began his career at Georgia 
Power in 1984 as a distribution engi-
neer, and he remained faithful to the 
company’s values and operations ever 
since. 
He held a variety of leadership roles 
within Georgia Power, including, most 
recently, serving as the southeast re-
gion vice president since 2017. 
He was instrumental at fostering 
good working relationships with elect-
ed State officials, other Georgia com-
panies and industries, and Georgia 
Power field office managers when he 
served as their vice president of gov-
ernmental and regulatory affairs. 
He has been a leader in his commu-
nity throughout his work with numer-
ous 
organizations, 
including 
the 
Ossabaw Island Foundation, Savannah 
Area Chamber of Commerce, Savannah 
Economic Development Authority, and 
the University of Georgia Alumni Asso-
ciation. 
Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for 
Truitt’s years of faithful service to 
Georgia Power and his community, and 
I wish him and his family the best as 
he begins his retirement. 
Congratulations, my friend. 
f 
CONGRATULATING THE PENNSYL-
VANIA 
INTERSCHOLASTIC 
ATH-
LETIC ASSOCIATION 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the PIAA on see-
ing through a successful fall season for 
Pennsylvania high school sports in 
spite of the many challenges. 
We have some great sports teams in 
my district of Pennsylvania, and I 
would like to highlight a few. 
North Schuylkill’s Spartans won a 
well-deserved football district cham-
pionship 
at 
the 
conclusion 
of 
an 
undefeated season. 
Palmyra’s high school girls field 
hockey team won a State title in over-
time, their first in 15 years; Southern 
Columbia girls soccer won their second 
title in 3 years; and Bloomsburg girls 
soccer won their State title. 
Mr. Speaker, Southern Columbia’s 
high school football program is nothing 
short of awesome. Southern Columbia, 
under Coach Jim Roth, won their 11th 
State title. On both sides of the ball, 
this team dominates, and the Tigers 
have made their citizens of Columbia 
County and all of Pennsylvania very 
proud. 
And congratulations to Lake Lehman 
football. I have known many of the 
players on this great team since they 
were 6 years old, playing and learning 
the game under Back Mountain Bob-
cats Head Coach Dan Anderson and 
other great coaches. 
Lake Lehman’s coach, Jerry Gilsky, 
led the Black Knights to a great sea-
son. They came up short in the district 
championship game, but they had a 
season of champions, and we are proud 
of them.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. PETERSON) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. CONAWAY) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Minnesota. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the bill under con-
sideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
4054, the U.S. Grain Standards Reau-
thorization Act of 2020. 
I want to thank Ranking Member 
CONAWAY, General Farm Commodities 
and Risk Management Subcommittee 
Chairman VELA, and Ranking Member 
THOMPSON for their bipartisan support 
for passage of S. 4054, the United States 
Grain Standards Reauthorization Act 
of 2020. 
The inspections provided by the Fed-
eral Grain Inspection Service define 
and classify grains, as well as assign 
grades to specify weight and quality re-
quirements, and these inspections pro-
vide a gold-standard assurance backed 
by the Federal Government to both 
grain buyers and sellers. 
American grain farmers participate 
in a very competitive world, and for-
eign grain buyers should be confident 
in this process that we have put for-
ward and have in place to ensure our 
exports are adequately inspected. 
As we move ahead with reauthoriza-
tion, I hope that we can take stock in 
how well the current system of export 
inspections by the Federal and State 
agencies is working, and continue to 
work on a bipartisan basis, and to pro-
vide necessary certainty and stability 
for producers and our Federal grain in-
spection system. 
I would also like to note the need for 
a dedicated and strong workforce at 
our ports to ensure that American 
grain can be expertly and efficiently 
loaded into ships for export. I would 
encourage those companies that have 
not already reached an agreement with 
their workforce to continue to seek an 
agreement. I applaud the American- 
owned companies that have already 
committed to their workers. 
So I encourage my colleagues to sup-
port the U.S. Grain Standards Reau-
thorization Act of 2020. American grain 
farmers participate in a fiercely com-
petitive world market, and we need to 
ensure that our inspection system al-
lows importers to maintain their con-
fidence in the quality of U.S. grain. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I too rise in support of 
the United States Grain Standards Re-
authorization Act of 2020, S. 4054. 
For over 100 years, this law has pro-
vided the foundation for the grain and 
oilseed marketplace to establish con-
sistent value and price discovery, and 
it is relied upon, not only by domestic 
shippers and exporters, but by the en-
tirety of the U.S. agriculture sector.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6030 
December 2, 2020 
This legislation contains several wins 
for agriculture stakeholders. It pro-
motes marketplace stability by requir-
ing delegated States to notify users of 
official inspection or weighing services 
of any intent to discontinue service, in 
addition to notifying the Secretary of 
Agriculture. 
It ensures that the user fees paid by 
the grain handlers are used solely for 
official services and not other govern-
ment functions. 
And perhaps most important, this 
legislation ensures continuity in the 
official grain inspection and weighing 
services, providing much-needed sta-
bility to the grain and oilseed trade 
and all who rely upon them. 
I want to thank Chairman PAT ROB-
ERTS for his work in the Senate to 
make sure that we renew the Grain 
Standards Act this year. 
I also want to thank the chairman of 
the Agriculture Committee and his 
team for getting this to the floor as ex-
peditiously as possible after passage by 
the Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, I support passage of S. 
4054. I encourage my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ as well, and I too reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT), and I want to 
congratulate him on his outstanding 
support from the steering committee 
to be the next chairman of the Agri-
culture Committee. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman very, 
very much for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I have served in this 
body for 18 years, and throughout those 
18 years, I have had a man that I am 
convinced was sent by God enter my 
life at a critical time, and that man is 
the chairman of the Agriculture Com-
mittee, COLLIN PETERSON. 
I am here to certainly ask everybody 
to make sure you vote unanimously on 
the bill. 
But I am here to express a great 
friendship, a heartfelt gratitude. And I 
say, as so many of my colleagues, you 
cannot have gone through this tremen-
dous challenge of being an elected offi-
cial without God having sent people 
your way to help you, to guide you. 
Such a man is COLLIN PETERSON and let 
me tell you why. 
When I came to Congress 18 years 
ago, I was assigned to the Agriculture 
Committee, and I was the only African 
American on that committee for sev-
eral years. Sometimes, when you are 
going into the crevices and the corners 
of life where you have not been before, 
God sends somebody along to give you 
a helping hand. Such a man in my life 
is COLLIN PETERSON. 
Not only that; he took me under his 
wing and guided me. Not just on one 
committee did he have me chair, sev-
eral, starting with livestock, moving 
on to credit, energy, the commodities, 
and now the financial exchanges; dar-
ing to move me into areas where I did 
not know that he had faith in me. And 
so I wanted to take this moment to say 
thank you. 
Now, as you mentioned, Mr. Chair-
man, thanks to your good right hand, 
you have opened a way that I might be-
come the next chairman of the House 
Agriculture Committee. No man, noth-
ing, has helped me more to be in this 
position than my friendship with this 
great man, COLLIN PETERSON. 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. HAGEDORN), my colleague 
and 
fellow 
Agriculture 
Committee 
member. 
Mr. HAGEDORN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank ranking Republican CONAWAY for 
yielding the time. I appreciate all that 
he has done for our committee over the 
years serving as chairman and every-
thing else. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
PETERSON for his service on behalf of 
our farmers and agribusinesses. I ap-
preciate him as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the U.S. Grain Standards Reauthor-
ization Act of 2020. 
The U.S. Grain Standards Act of 1916 
established USDA’s Federal Grain In-
spection Service and has benefited all 
of agriculture, right down the chain, 
for more than a century. 
This reauthorization today will pro-
vide 5 years of certainty, avoid poten-
tial disruptions to the grain inspection 
and weighing system, and make modest 
but important changes to the program 
overall. 
The folks at the Minnesota Grain & 
Feed Association and many others in 
agriculture are behind this legislation. 
And let’s not forget that the bill addi-
tionally requires USDA to conduct 
comprehensive, nationwide review of 
the agency geographic areas to report 
its findings and recommendations and 
report back to Congress in 18 months. 
I will vote ‘‘yes’’ today. I encourage 
all of my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. Craig), one of our new 
and rising upcoming members of the 
Agriculture Committee. 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairman for yielding; and I thank the 
chairman for his 30 years of service to 
the State of Minnesota and to our fam-
ily farmers across this Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 4054, the U.S. Grain Standards Re-
authorization Act of 2020. 
As our family farmers face the grow-
ing impacts of COVID–19 and continued 
trade instability, we must maintain 
the integrity of our domestic grain 
market and inspection system. 
This bipartisan legislation passed the 
Senate unanimously, to reauthorize 
the Federal Grain Inspection Service at 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture. I 
applaud Senate Agriculture Committee 
Chairman PAT ROBERTS and Ranking 
Member DEBBIE STABENOW on their bi-
partisan efforts to get this across the 
finish line. This reauthorization pro-
vides necessary certainty for buyers 
and sellers throughout the grain supply 
chain. 
Food and agriculture products have 
long remained the largest category of 
exports for Minnesota. The Federal 
Grain Inspection Service provides a re-
liable, competitive, and cost-effective 
official grain inspection and weighing 
system to facilitate the marketing of 
U.S. grains and oilseeds in export and 
domestic markets. 
Just last year, Minnesota produced 
over $7.5 billion worth of corn, wheat, 
and soybeans. The employees of compa-
nies in my district, like CHS, Cargill, 
and ADM, keep our grain markets mov-
ing along the Mississippi River and off 
to destinations across the globe. 
While this year has certainly pre-
sented its challenges, reauthorizing 
grain standards provides a glimmer of 
stability for our producers as they con-
tinue to secure additional support in 
export markets. This legislation shores 
up the infrastructure that will make 
sure those exports continue into 2021. 
I look forward to the passage of this 
bill for the family farmers of my dis-
trict and Minnesota’s agriculture econ-
omy. 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Kan-
sas (Mr. MARSHALL), our soon-to-be 
former colleague, soon-to-be junior 
Senator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
American-grown 
grain 
is 
known 
around the world as the safest, most 
reliable, and the highest-quality prod-
uct in the world. This reputation re-
mains unchanged and unchallenged, 
thanks in part to the USDA’s Federal 
Grain Inspection Service authorized by 
the U.S. Grain Standards Act. 
The Kansas economy is dependent 
upon continued strong agriculture ex-
ports and the certainty that comes 
with strict grain quality and inspec-
tion standards. 
Kansas exported almost $4 billion in 
farm goods to over 96 different coun-
tries this past year, and Kansas re-
mains the seventh largest State for ag-
riculture exports. 
b 1615 
Strong demand for Kansas grain and 
feed products ensures a strong Kansas 
economy. 
Through rigorous standards set by 
our Federal inspection system, grain 
and feed products grown by Kansas 
farm families are eagerly accepted 
around the globe. It is because of this 
predictability, transparency, and cer-
tainty of our Nation’s grain inspection 
system that the world continues to 
look to the U.S. for agricultural and 
food products. 
These high standards are yet another 
reason the USTR has been so success-
ful—in fact, renegotiating successfully 
over 50 percent of our ag export mar-
kets over the past 4 years. 
I applaud the passage of the U.S. 
Grain Standards Act and will remain

dedicated to removing barriers and lev-
eling the playing field for agriculture 
exports. As part of these efforts, it is 
essential that the U.S. maintains its 
reputation and its credibility for safe, 
high-quality crops and food products. 
Through reauthorization of this bi-
partisan legislation, Congress is ensur-
ing the continuation of the USDA’s 
grain inspection services and sup-
porting farmers and ranchers across 
the country. 
Finally, I want to salute and say 
thanks to two of my great friends who 
are mentors and leaders in the ag 
world. Our current chairman of the Ag-
riculture Committee, COLLIN
PETER-
SON, I thank the gentleman for his 
great leadership and for his friendship. 
Of course, I salute our current ranking 
member and our past committee chair-
man as well, MIKE CONAWAY. The chair-
man has done a great job as well. It has 
been an honor to work with the gen-
tleman. I wish both gentlemen God-
speed and health to all their families. 
Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from South 
Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON), who is my col-
league and a fellow member on the Ag-
riculture Committee. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Ranking Member 
CONAWAY. The gentleman has been a 
champion. I thank Chairman PETER-
SON. The gentleman has been a cham-
pion. 
We are here on the floor this after-
noon debating the United States Grain 
Standards Reauthorization Act, and I 
rise in support of that act. 
Agriculture is a business where al-
most nothing is certain. From poor 
weather to trade disruptions to trans-
port delays, these all create an incred-
ible environment of unpredictability. 
In that environment of unpredict-
ability, producers should not have to 
face unpredictability in agricultural 
policy. That means that when Congress 
can come together in a bipartisan way 
and offer a bit of certainty, we abso-
lutely should do so. 
That brings us to the Grain Stand-
ards Reauthorization Act. I am glad 
that we are passing a 5-year reauthor-
ization so that the user-funded USGSA 
will allow buyers and sellers to quickly 
and effectively determine those quality 
specs that are outlined in contracts. 
In this world of uncertainty, Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad and I am proud that 
we are going to send this to the Presi-
dent’s desk, and, of course, I urge all of 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers, and I yield myself 
the remainder of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, before I close, I would 
like to make a couple of comments 
about my colleague from Minnesota. 
COLLIN PETERSON has served this House 
and the constituents of Minnesota’s 
Seventh District, but, more impor-
tantly, rural America and production 
agriculture for 30 years. 
My first memory of Chairman PETER-
SON came in the 2008 farm bill reau-
thorization markup. That was my very 
first one. I was a rookie, and that was 
his 15th or 16th farm bill to chair. He 
was stunningly patient with me during 
that entire process and had a big influ-
ence on me. 
I don’t think there has been anyone 
more dedicated and more steadfast as a 
supporter for rural America and pro-
duction agriculture than Chairman 
PETERSON. He has seen good times and 
bad 
times, 
unfortunately, 
probably 
more bad times during that 30 years 
than good times. He has been a cham-
pion for both rural America and pro-
duction agriculture throughout that 
timeframe. Rural America and produc-
tion agriculture are both better off for 
his long service to this House and to 
the constituents of Minnesota’s Sev-
enth District. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of S. 
4054, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I thank the gentleman for his kind 
words and for his willingness to work 
with us over these last number of 
years. 
With this bill, we got just about all 
of our work done. We have the CFTC 
reauthorization we didn’t get done, but 
everything else is off the plate. So that 
is good. 
We made good progress. We will, both 
of us, ride off into the sunset, I think, 
feeling that we have done a decent job. 
So, again, I thank Mr. CONAWAY and 
all members of the committee for the 
work that they do and wish them well 
in the next Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask everybody to 
unanimously support S. 4054, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
PETERSON) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 4054. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
HOLDING FOREIGN COMPANIES 
ACCOUNTABLE ACT 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
945) to amend the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
of 2002 to require certain issuers to dis-
close to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission information regarding for-
eign jurisdictions that prevent the

ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. CLAY) and the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Missouri. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks on this 
legislation and to insert extraneous 
material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
945, the Holding Foreign Companies Ac-
countable Act, which would suspend 
the trading of securities of foreign 
issuers that retain accounting firms 
not subject to audit by the Public Com-
pany Accounting Oversight Board after 
3 years of noncompliance, as well as re-
quire the issuer to disclose whether it 
is owned or controlled by a foreign gov-
ernment. 
I would like to thank Senator KEN-
NEDY
and Representative SHERMAN, 
who cosponsored the House version of 
S. 945, for working on this incredibly 
important and long-overdue piece of 
legislation. 
The Enron and WorldCom financial 
reporting scandals wiped out billions of 
dollars 
from 
retirement 
accounts, 
eliminated tens of thousands of jobs, 
and defrauded investors hundreds of 
billions of dollars. To ensure U.S. in-
vestors, workers, retirees, and capital 
markets were never again exposed to 
this type of egregious fraud, Congress 
established the PCAOB through the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act to protect inves-
tors by overseeing the audits of public 
companies and ensuring the prepara-
tion of informative, accurate, and inde-
pendent 
corporate 
disclosures 
and 
audit reports by inspection. 
As former PCAOB board member Ste-
ven Harris noted: ‘‘The PCAOB was es-
tablished because the accounting pro-
fession’s framework of self-regulation 
had failed,’’ and the creation of an 
independent auditor to inspect and 
verify corporate disclosures and audit 
work was necessary. 
However, citing various foreign se-
crecy, privacy, and national security 
laws, many foreign issuers who enjoy 
the full benefits and privileges of trad-
ing on U.S. exchanges and access to 
U.S. public markets have openly flout-
ed U.S. investor protections and pro-
hibited the PCAOB from inspecting 
their corporate disclosures as well as 
the auditor’s work. 
According to a June 2020 PCAOB re-
port, China alone had 202 public compa-
nies listed on U.S. exchanges rep-
resenting $1.8 trillion in market cap-
italization that the PCAOB has been 
unable to fully and adequately inspect. 
Make no mistake, the ability of for-
eign issuers to circumvent PCAOB in-
spection affirmatively allows foreign 
companies to exploit U.S. workers and 
retirees and comes at the direct ex-
pense of U.S. investors and the integ-
rity of U.S. markets. To continue with 
business as usual reverts us back to the 
Enron and WorldCom status quo. 
By suspending the trading of securi-
ties issued by foreign issuers who are 
not fully compliant with PCAOB audit 
inspections for 3 years, the Holding 
Foreign Companies Accountable Act 
will hold noncompliant foreign issuers 
accountable and help safeguard U.S. in-
vestors and the integrity of our mar-
kets. 
We can no longer allow foreign 
issuers to exploit our system. I call on 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to stand with me in protecting Amer-
ican workers, retirees, and investors by 
supporting the bipartisan Holding For-
eign Companies Accountable Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1630 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today 
relates to an issue that the President’s 
Working Group on Financial Markets 
and the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission are diligently working to ad-
dress: the Public Company Accounting 
Oversight Board’s inability to inspect 
the 
audit 
work 
and 
practices 
of 
PCAOB-registered auditing firms in 
China. 
The mission of the PCAOB is to over-
see the audits of public companies and 
provide the public with informative, 
accurate, and independent audit re-
ports. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the 
PCAOB’s rules impose requirements on 
firms that perform audit work for pub-
lic companies, which include providing 
complete and timely access for PCAOB 
inspections. 
Conducting inspections in the United 
States is simple; however, conducting 
them internationally requires agree-
ments with foreign regulators and 
firms. 
Over the years, the PCAOB has 
worked closely with their foreign coun-
terparts on specific requirements for 
nearly all jurisdictions that have U.S.- 
listed public companies. This collabo-
ration allows for joint inspections and 
enforcement matters. However, there 
are a few countries for which no such 
agreements exist. The outstanding ju-
risdictions include Belgium, France, 
Hong Kong, and China. 
The Board is currently working on 
agreements that would lead to coopera-
tion in Belgium and France and ex-
pects to have a final cooperative agree-
ment to facilitate access in the near 
future. 
China, on the other hand, has skirted 
these requirements. They have done so 
without showing any interest in allow-
ing for such cooperation. As a result, 
the PCAOB cannot inspect the audit 
work and practices of firms in China 
and Hong Kong to the extent their cli-
ents 
have 
operations 
in 
mainland

China. The Chinese Government has 
exacerbated the situation by prohib-
iting audit firms from providing this 
information without the consent of 
Chinese financial regulators. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill before us today 
prohibits the securities of a public 
company from being traded on a na-
tional securities exchange if the issuer 
has had 3 consecutive ‘‘non-inspection 
years,’’ that is, years that the PCAOB 
is unable to inspect a public company’s 
auditors. 
During these non-inspection years, 
each company would be required to dis-
close the percentage of the shares 
owned by governmental entities, the 
governmental entities that have a con-
trolling financial interest, and if any 
official of the Chinese Communist 
Party is a member of the company’s 
board as well as any ownership by the 
CCP. 
As the title of this legislation sug-
gests, the Holding Foreign Companies 
Accountable Act is designed to prevent 
companies based in China and certain 
other jurisdictions from taking advan-
tage of our deep and liquid capital mar-
kets while avoiding the scrutiny that 
comes with inspection of their finan-
cial statement audits. 
This situation is unfair and dan-
gerous for investors. For that reason, 
the act should be read to apply to com-
panies where the auditor that signs the 
audit report is located in a jurisdiction 
that does not permit PCAOB inspection 
access. 
Mr. Speaker, nearly 6 months ago, 
the 
President 
released 
the 
Memo-
randum on Protecting United States 
Investors from Significant Risks from 
Chinese Companies. The memo directed 
the President’s Working Group on Fi-
nancial 
Markets 
to 
provide 
rec-
ommendations to address the issues 
with China. Three months ago, the 
President’s Working Group released 
that report. 
The report comprehensively details a 
number of recommendations to level 
the playing field for all companies list-
ed on our exchanges and improve dis-
closure on the risks of investing in 
emerging markets. The implementa-
tion of these recommendations would 
effectuate the intent of Senator KEN-
NEDY’s legislation. 
Moreover, immediately following the 
release of the report, SEC Chairman 
Clayton directed staff to prepare pro-
posals to address these recommenda-
tions in a comprehensive and trans-
parent manner through the rulemaking 
process. 
Mr. Speaker, I applaud Senator KEN-
NEDY and his staff for their efforts and 
the President’s Working Group on Fi-
nancial Markets, as well as the PCAOB 
for their diligence. 
I also thank House Minority Leader 
MCCARTHY and House Committee on 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Ranking 
Member 
MCCAUL
for their leadership on the 
China Task Force. Republicans have 
and will continue to fight against com-
munism and the global threat the Chi-
nese Government poses. 
Mr. Speaker, finally, I thank Mr. 
SHERMAN for working with me to have 
similar legislation included in the 
House NDAA and his work in bringing 
this legislation to the floor today. 
Again, I thank the gentleman from 
Louisiana, Senator KENNEDY, for all his 
work in standing up to China, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SHERMAN), my 20-year 
friend and colleague. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I will speak 
longer than I usually do on these bills 
because I both want to persuade people 
to support the bill and also provide im-
portant 
information 
to 
the 
entire 
House that will be part of the legisla-
tive history of this bill and is designed 
to guide the SEC in issuing appropriate 
regulations. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of S. 945, the Holding Foreign Compa-
nies Accountable Act. I thank Chair-
woman WATERS and her staff for work-
ing with my office, and all the mem-
bers who have been involved in this bill 
and making this issue a priority. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe this will be 
perhaps the most significant piece of 
investor protection legislation that the 
Congress adopts this Congress because 
it applies to some 224 publicly traded 
companies and assures investors of the 
financial statement integrity that they 
expect from all companies that are 
traded in the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s go back in history 
a bit. For well over a century, inves-
tors in corporations have insisted that 
the financial statements they get are 
audited by an independent auditor. But 
at the beginning of this century, we 
learned that that was not enough. We 
saw Enron and WorldCom. We passed 
the Sarbanes-Oxley bill, and created 
the PCAOB so that we have a system 
where not only are the companies’ fi-
nancial statements audited, but the 
audit is subject to being audited by a 
governmental entity. That is essential 
in this century to have investors ade-
quately protected. So when we are 
dealing with 224 public companies with 
$1.8 trillion in capitalization, we need 
that level of protection. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
from Ohio (Congressman GONZALEZ) for 
joining me in leading on this issue in 
the House. I thank my good friend and 
cochair of the bicameral, bipartisan 
CPA Caucus, MIKE CONAWAY, who has 
been working on these issues for many 
years. And I thank Senators KENNEDY 
and VAN HOLLEN for their leadership in 
advancing this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, currently the PCAOB, 
the Public Company Accounting Over-
sight Board, is unable to inspect the 
audit work and practices of certain 
audit firms in a handful of jurisdic-
tions. Today, that includes Belgium 
and France to some degree, but, pri-
marily, the issue is China. In most 
cases, audit firms in those jurisdictions 
cite local laws related to data protec-
tion or national security as a reason 
for being unable to provide the PCAOB 
with the information they need. 
Accordingly, as I mentioned before, 
the PCAOB has noted that the auditor 
for some 224 U.S.-listed companies with 
a combined total capitalization of $1.8 
trillion is not subject to the enhanced 
oversight that this Congress has in-
sisted upon since 2002. 
Since it was created, the PCAOB has 
established a formal cooperative rela-
tionship with foreign audit regulators 
that have allowed it to conduct inspec-
tions of firms in more than 59 U.S. ju-
risdictions. However, the PCAOB and 
the Securities Exchange Commission 
have tried to engage with Chinese regu-
lators for over a decade in an effort to 
reach a similar cooperative agreement 
and are still not able to conduct in-
spections with regard to China or Hong 
Kong. 
Mr. Speaker, our legislation will 
bring an end to this sort of risk for in-
vestors in U.S. markets by requiring 
the SEC to stop trading in a company’s 
stocks if the PCAOB is unable to in-
spect the audit report and the audit 
work papers for a period of 3 years. 
Mr. Speaker, this is an investor pro-
tection bill. I am chair of the Investor 
Protection and Capital Markets Sub-
committee. This bill is not anti-China, 
and it is not designed to prohibit the 
trading of Chinese companies. Rather, 
it provides a 3-year window, during 
which we expect China will enter into a 
reasonable agreement with the SEC 
and the PCAOB so that we have the ad-
ditional level of protection for inves-
tors that we expect and have demanded 
since we passed the Sarbanes-Oxley bill 
in 2002. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to say that 
the House has already passed this legis-
lation in similar—and actually, supe-
rior—form as an amendment to the 2001 
NDAA, National Defense Authorization 
Act. It is the intention of the authors 
of this Senate bill to achieve exactly 
what that language—approved by the 
House earlier this year—sets forward. 
And that amendment to the NDAA is 
part of the legislative history of this 
bill and our consideration of it today. 
Mr. Speaker, in order to guide the in-
terpretation of this bill, Senator KEN-
NEDY and I have a statement, and I in-
clude in the RECORD that statement. 
UNITED STATES SENATE 
Statement: S. 945—Holding Foreign Compa-
nies Accountable Act. Considered on Fri-
day, December 2, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I write to submit a state-
ment for the record to address S. 945, the 
Holding 
Foreign 
Companies 
Accountable 
Act. 
It is the intent of this legislation to pro-
vide the Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion with the discretion necessary to deter-
mine how much of a company’s total audit 
must be performed by a firm beyond the 
reach of PCAOB inspections before trading in 
the company’s securities is prohibited by the 
Commission. Consistent with our work with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission on 
this legislation, it is our expectation that 
the Commission will not prohibit trading in

the securities of companies under this act, as 
long as not more than one third of a com-
pany’s total audit is performed by a firm be-
yond the reach of PCAOB inspections. This 
legislation provides the Commission with 
the authority to determine how an audit 
would be measured, whether that be total 
revenue, assets, or another metric. 
Furthermore, the scope of this legislation 
is not intended to be limited to public com-
panies which rely on foreign audit firms that 
have some form of ownership relationship 
with a PCAOB-registered public accounting 
firm. Specifically, it is intended to also en-
compass public companies which rely on for-
eign audit firms that are affiliated with or 
maintain some form of affiliation agreement 
with a PCAOB-registered public accounting 
firm. 
JOHN KENNEDY, 
U.S. Senator. 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I will 
read it so that it is before the entire 
House. 
‘‘It is the intent of this legislation to 
provide the Securities and Exchange 
Commission with the discretion nec-
essary to determine how much of a 
company’s total audit must be per-
formed by a firm beyond the reach of 
PCAOB inspections before trading in 
the company’s securities is prohibited 
by the Commission. Consistent with 
our work with the Securities and Ex-
change Commission on this legislation, 
it is our expectation that the Commis-
sion will not prohibit trading in the se-
curities of companies under this act, as 
long as not more than one-third of a 
company’s total audit is performed by 
a firm beyond the reach of the PCAOB 
inspections. This legislation provides 
the Commission with the authority to 
determine how an audit would be meas-
ured, whether that be total revenue, 
assets, or another metric. 
‘‘Furthermore, the scope of this leg-
islation is not intended to be limited to 
public companies which rely on foreign 
audit firms that have some form of 
ownership relationship with a PCAOB- 
registered public accounting firm. Spe-
cifically, it is intended to also encom-
pass public companies which rely on 
foreign audit firms that are affiliated 
with or maintain some form of affili-
ation agreement with a PCAOB-reg-
istered public accounting firm.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, one particular comment 
to draw your attention to is that it is 
not the intention of this bill to cover 
firms that have some small part of 
their audit being done in China, per-
haps one subsidiary in China, but is 
rather designed to apply when a third 
or more of the audit is not subject to 
PCAOB inspection. And how you define 
one-third of the audit, whether that is 
the audit of one-third of the revenues 
or one-third of the assets, or some 
other metric, is left to the SEC. 
As House sponsor of this legislation, 
I have cosigned the statement I have 
just read, prepared by Senator KEN-
NEDY, but would have the following ad-
ditional remarks: 
I will take this opportunity to make 
clear, it is not the intention of this leg-
islation that every public company, 
which is a client of an audit firm with 
a branch, office, or affiliate in a juris-
diction beyond the reach of the PCAOB 
inspections, be subject to a trading 
prohibition. 
Instead, the trading prohibitions re-
quired under this bill are intended to 
be applied when a significant portion of 
the audit is prepared by an audit firm 
or the branch, or office, or affiliate of 
an audit firm which the PCAOB is un-
able to inspect, and the SEC has the 
authority to interpret this provision. 
As chair of the Investor Protection 
and Capital Markets Subcommittee, I 
appreciate how critical it is for inves-
tors on U.S. stock exchanges to have 
the additional protection that the fi-
nancial statements have not just been 
audited, but that that audit is subject 
to review by the PCAOB. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my col-
leagues for their support of this legisla-
tion, and look forward to its passage 
here today. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for yielding me enough time to both 
describe the major parts of the legisla-
tion and also make it clear to the regu-
lators what expectations the House and 
Senate have for the regulations that 
they will issue. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, may I inquire how much time each 
side has remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlemen from Ohio has 16 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Missouri 
has 61⁄2 remaining. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I simply urge my col-
leagues to support S. 945. 
Again, I thank everyone for making 
this legislation possible. I thank Mr. 
SHERMAN
for his comments and his 
work and partnership on this impor-
tant issue. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, let me first thank my 
friend from Maryland, Senator CHRIS 
VAN HOLLEN, for his cosponsorship of 
this legislation. 
The Holding Foreign Companies Ac-
countable Act would require the SEC 
to suspend the trading of securities at 
issue by foreign issuers who are not 
fully compliant with PCAOB audit in-
spection for 3 years, commencing upon 
the enactment of this bill, as well as 
require 
foreign 
issuers 
to 
disclose 
whether they are owned or controlled 
by a foreign government. 
For too long, foreign issuers have cir-
cumvented important investor protec-
tions crafted by Congress to protect 
U.S. investors, retirees, workers, and 
U.S. capital markets. This common-
sense bill does nothing more than en-
sure a level playing field by requiring 
foreign issuers to play by the same 
rules as everyone else. 
Additionally, with passage of this 
bill, investors and markets can be as-
sured that the legally required disclo-
sures they are receiving pursuant to 
U.S. law from the company they are in-
vesting in have been thoroughly vetted 
by an independent entity whose mis-
sion is to protect investors and safe-
guard market integrity. 
Maintaining the status quo would 
allow foreign issuers to continue to ex-
ploit U.S. retirees, workers, and inves-
tors, all while allowing them continued 
access to the greatest, most dynamic 
capital market system in the world. 
I call on all my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to join me in sup-
porting the bipartisan Holding Foreign 
Companies Accountable Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of S. 945. The United States has the 
most robust and advanced capital markets in 
the world. They provide access to capital for 
some of the most innovative businesses, and 
create an avenue for investors of all levels to 
save for retirement and plan for their futures. 
It follows that companies from around the 
globe flock to the U.S. capital markets to fund 
their businesses; and the U.S. is happy to be 
the destination for these firms. However, to 
play in our markets, companies need to play 
by our rules; and Chinese firms listed on 
American exchanges are the worst and most 
frequent offenders. Gone are the days when 
we can sit idly by and let Chinese firms, many 
with strong ties to the Chinese Communist 
Party, participate in our markets at the ex-
pense of protection for everyday investors. 
Most publicly traded firms are audited by 
public accounting firms, which, in turn, are 
overseen by the PCAOB. This gives investors 
confidence that the books are accurate. China, 
however, refuses to let the PCAOB review its 
auditors. 
The result? At best, investors lack con-
fidence in the validity and reliability of a com-
pany’s financial data. Even worse, thousands 
of investors are downright defrauded. The 
worst case scenario—American savers are un-
wittingly funding efforts by Chinese SOEs to 
usurp America’s global supremacy and com-
promise U.S. national security. 
I was proud to serve on the House China 
Task Force, where we closely examined, 
among other things, China’s participation in 
U.S. capital markets. Earlier this year, we pub-
lished a report with over 130 recommenda-
tions—most of which are bipartisan. Passage 
of the House companion to S. 945, sponsored 
by Mr. SHERMAN, was among the rec-
ommendations. 
Also among the recommendations was pas-
sage of my bill, the Transparency in Chinese 
Government Investment Act, which would di-
rect the SEC to investigate whether disclosure 
of a business’s ties to the CCP or other ma-
lign Chinese initiatives is material for inves-
tors; and, if so, require companies to report. 
We can no longer allow China to take ad-
vantage of our rules, defraud our investors, 
and challenge the spirit of free enterprise. I 
urge support of S. 945.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
CLAY) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, S. 945. 
The question was taken; and (two-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. CLAY) and the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Missouri. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material therein. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 1830, the National Purple Heart 
Hall of Honor Commemorative Coin 
Act. 
The Purple Heart is one of the oldest 
and most recognized American mili-
tary medals awarded to servicemem-
bers who were killed or wounded by 
enemy action. 
The mission of the National Purple 
Heart Hall of Honor, located in New 
Windsor, New York, is to collect and 
preserve the stories of Purple Heart re-
cipients from all branches of the 
Armed Forces and across all genera-
tions. 
The Hall of Honor serves as a living 
memorial to these servicemembers and 
ensures that all recipients are remem-
bered. Currently, there are over 200,000 
names installed at the Hall of Honor. 
This bill would provide tangible sup-
port to the Hall of Honor by directing 
the West Point Mint to produce com-
memorative coins in recognition of the 
work of the Hall of Honor. Proceeds 
from the sale of this coin would fund 
improvements to the museum itself to 
help expand the understanding and re-
spect for those who have served and 
sacrificed. 
This bill passed the House last Sep-
tember, but the version we are consid-
ering today incorporates changes made 
by a Senate amendment that updates 
the time period for issuance of the 
commemorative coins to fiscal year 
2022, and includes financial assurance 
language that minting and issuing 
coins under this act will result in no 
net cost to the Federal Government. 
I thank Mr. MALONEY, Mr. TAKANO, 
and Mr. GALLAGHER for their work on 
this bill, and I urge Members to vote 
‘‘yes.’’

December 2, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1830, as amended by the Senate, also 
known as the National Purple Heart 
Hall of Honor Commemorative Coin 
Act. 
I would like to thank Leader SCHU-
MER for championing this issue on the 
Senate side and the gentleman from 
New York, Congressman MALONEY, for 
his work. We passed his version of this 
bill in the House back in September of 
2019. I am glad that we have the oppor-
tunity to send this important bill to 
the President’s desk. 
The National Purple Heart Mission 
opened in 2006. The Purple Heart Mis-
sion is a New York State facility that 
is dedicated to collecting, preserving, 
and sharing the stories of all Purple 
Heart recipients from all branches of 
service and across all conflicts. 
Enrollments at the National Purple 
Heart Honor Mission are voluntary, 
and submissions are made by Purple 
Heart recipients, their families, or 
friends. Currently, there are 1,095 Pur-
ple Heart recipients enrolled from the 
great State of North Carolina, rep-
resenting World War I, World War II, 
Korea, Vietnam, Somalia, Operation 
Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi 
Freedom. 
These courageous men and women 
are recognized by the National Purple 
Heart Honor Mission because, surpris-
ingly, the Federal Government does 
not maintain a comprehensive list. In 
fact, the only award for which there is 
a list is the Medal of Honor. 
Mr. Speaker, the National Purple 
Heart Honor Mission is an organization 
that deserves the recognition the com-
memorative coin will bring. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY), my 
friend and colleague. 
Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of 
New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of my bill, the National Purple 
Heart Hall of Honor Commemorative 
Coin Act, which will be voted on to-
night, after many years of work. 
I think it is important to note that it 
was the father of our country, George 
Washington, who created the Purple 
Heart in the closing days of the Revo-
lutionary War. It happened right in my 
district, in the heart of New York’s 
Hudson Valley, at the New Windsor 
Cantonment, 
where 
General 
Wash-
ington created and awarded something 
called the Badge of Military Merit. We 
know that honor today as the Purple 
Heart, which is how it appeared when 
it was originally created out of fabric. 
The Purple Heart was revived in 1932, 
on the bicentennial of General Wash-
ington’s birth to honor veterans of 
World War I. Since then, this great 
honor has been earned. It has been 
earned, often at great personal cost, by 
nearly 2 million brave servicemen and 
servicewomen. 
In 2006, as my colleague noted, the 
National Purple Heart Hall of Honor, 
located in New Windsor, opened its 
doors and launched the first com-
prehensive list of Purple Heart recipi-
ents. The Hall of Honor collects and 
preserves the names and, more impor-
tantly, the deeds and stories of the 
men and women wounded or killed in 
service of our Nation. 
It honors heroes like Rich Drago, my 
friend, who lives in the Hudson Valley. 
Rich served in Vietnam. He continued 
to man his post under fire, even after 
he had been hit by a mortar blast. It is 
heroes like Rich who we honor tonight. 
He serves today on my Veterans Advi-
sory Board. He is the vice chair of the 
National Purple Heart Honor Mission 
Board of Directors and is the com-
mander of the Military Order of the 
Purple Heart, Chapter 1782. 
I thank so many others, including 
members of my staff—my legislative 
staff: Ryan Lehman; Molly Carey; 
Shallum Atkinson; Laura Bart; and, of 
course, Beverly Hart, who has person-
ally worked for so long to make this 
day a reality. 
Of course, it is the National Purple 
Heart Hall of Honor that deserves the 
credit and the Purple Heart Honor Mis-
sion and the recipients who do such im-
portant work and who create such a 
powerful example for all of us. 
In addition to helping veterans re-
ceive their Purple Heart, they now sup-
port veterans and their families, offer 
educational programs for schools, host 
a 4-day honor mission to the Hudson 
Valley to see the Hall of Honor. 
My bill will authorize, importantly, 
the U.S. Treasury to mint $5 gold 
coins, $1 silver coins, and half-dollar 
clad coins. The proceeds from these 
coins—and this is wonderful—which 
will be produced at the West Point 
Mint, right down the road, outside the 
United States Military Academy, will 
support the critical mission, along 
with other programs to help veterans 
and their families at no cost to the tax-
payers, both in New York and, of 
course, across our country. 
I thank my friend, Senator SCHUMER, 
for his partnership in passing the bill 
through the Senate with broad bipar-
tisan support. I thank my colleagues 
here in House: The chairman of the 
Veterans’ 
Affairs 
Committee; 
my 
friends across the aisle, like MIKE GAL-
LAGHER, himself a Marine Corps vet-
eran, for their partnership on this leg-
islation. 
The bill was really made possible, of 
course, by the extraordinary work of 
the Military Order of the Purple Heart, 
the team at the National Purple Heart 
Hall of Honor and the Honor Mission, 
including Russ Vernon, Richie Lay, 
Richard Gerbeth, Jr., and William 
Nazario; and, of course, volunteers like 
Stephanie Keegan, who helped us win 
overwhelming bipartisan support from 
over 300 Members of Congress. 
You know, today is particularly mov-
ing for me because of how long it has 
taken to bring this bill to fruition. I 
can’t help but think of two men who 
inspired our work on this bill. One is 
my dad, Jim Maloney, a Navy veteran 
who was banged up pretty bad on the 
USS Manchester on his 19th birthday, 
but who got himself well and was able 
to live his American Dream because his 
country had his back and there were 
people here who wanted to honor his 
service. He showed me firsthand the in-
credible sacrifice of those who have 
served. 
Another is a Republican friend of my 
mine, Senator Bill Larkin, a dear 
friend who passed away just last year. 
Bill served our country in World War II 
and Korea. When we did events to-
gether, he would have trouble standing 
because his feet still hurt from the 
frostbite he suffered in Korea. He 
served the Hudson Valley as a State 
senator for 40 years and worked closely 
with me to advance the mission of the 
Hall of Honor on this bill. I could not 
be more proud to work with his beloved 
wife, Pat, and others, to carry on this 
piece of his legacy, and I can’t wait to 
see this coin become a reality. I know 
my friend, Bill Larkin, is smiling down 
from Heaven tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank you all for your 
support and the bipartisanship it took 
to get us to this point. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time for the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I would simply urge my 
colleagues to support H.R. 1830, as 
amended, so we can honor our great 
Purple Heart recipients in Ohio and 
across the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill ensures that 
the National Purple Heart Hall of 
Honor can continue its important mis-
sion of collecting, preserving, and shar-
ing the stories of the brave men and 
women who were killed or injured in 
service to their country. 
The straightforward changes we are 
considering today will align the time 
period for the issuance of the com-
memorative coins and ensures that the 
coins issued under this act will result 
in no net cost to the Federal Govern-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
CLAY) that the House suspend the rules 
and concur in the Senate amendment 
to the bill, H.R. 1830. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the Senate 
amendment was concurred in. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

AND 
COST 
SAV-
INGS ACT OF 2020 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7995) to amend title 31, United 
States Code, to save Federal funds by 
authorizing changes to the composition 
of circulating coins, and for other pur-
poses, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7995 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Coin Metal 
Modification Authorization and Cost Savings 
Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. SAVING FEDERAL FUNDS BY AUTHOR-
IZING CHANGES TO THE COMPOSI-
TION OF CIRCULATING COINS. 
Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, 
is amended by adding at the end the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(x) COMPOSITION OF CIRCULATING COINS.— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, and subject to the 
other provisions of this subsection, the Di-
rector of the United States Mint (referred to 
in this subsection as the ‘Director’), in con-
sultation with the Secretary, may modify 
the metallic composition of circulating coins 
to a new metallic composition (including by 
prescribing reasonable manufacturing toler-
ances with respect to those coins) if a study 
and analysis conducted by the United States 
Mint, including solicitation of input, includ-
ing input on acceptor tolerances and require-
ments, from industry stakeholders who could 
be affected by changes in the composition of 
circulating coins, indicates that the modi-
fication will— 
‘‘(A) reduce costs incurred by the tax-
payers of the United States; 
‘‘(B) be seamless, which shall mean the 
same diameter and weight as United States 
coinage being minted on the date of enact-
ment of this subsection and that the coins 
will work interchangeably in most coin ac-
ceptors 
using 
electromagnetic 
signature 
technology; and 
‘‘(C) have as minimal an adverse impact as 
possible on the public and stakeholders. 
‘‘(2) NOTIFICATION
TO
CONGRESS.—On the 
date that is at least 90 legislative days before 
the date on which the Director begins mak-
ing a modification described in paragraph 
(1), the Director shall submit to Congress no-
tice that— 
‘‘(A) provides a justification for the modi-
fication, including the support for that modi-
fication in the study and analysis required 
under paragraph (1) with respect to the 
modification; 
‘‘(B) describes how the modification will 
reduce costs incurred by the taxpayers of the 
United States; 
‘‘(C) certifies that the modification will be 
seamless, as described in paragraph (1)(B); 
and 
‘‘(D) certifies that the modification will 
have as minimal an adverse impact as pos-
sible on the public and stakeholders. 
‘‘(3) CONGRESSIONAL
AUTHORITY.—The Di-
rector may begin making a modification pro-
posed under this subsection not earlier than 
the date that is 90 legislative days after the 
date on which the Director submits to Con-
gress the notice required under paragraph (2) 
with respect to that modification, unless 
Congress, during the period of 90 legislative 
days beginning on the date on which the Di-
rector submits that notice— 
‘‘(A) finds that the modification is not jus-
tified in light of the information contained 
in that notice; and 
‘‘(B) enacts a joint resolution of dis-
approval of the proposed modification. 
‘‘(4) PROCEDURES.—For purpose of para-
graph (3)— 
‘‘(A) a joint resolution of disapproval is a 
joint resolution the matter after the resolv-
ing clause of which is as follows: ‘That Con-
gress disapproves the modification sub-
mitted by the Director of the United States 
Mint.’; and 
‘‘(B) the procedural rules in the House of 
Representatives and the Senate for a joint 
resolution of disapproval described under 
paragraph (3) shall be the same as provided 
for a joint resolution of disapproval under 
chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code.’’. 
SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Missouri (Mr. CLAY) and the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Missouri. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Missouri? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 7995, the Coin Metal Modifica-
tion Authorization and Cost Savings 
Act of 2020. I thank the gentleman 
from Nevada (Representative AMODEI) 
for his work on this bill, which author-
izes the Director of the Mint, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of the 
Treasury, to modify the metallic com-
position of circulating coins to better 
meet public demand for coins while 
seeking to reduce costs to taxpayers 
and preserve interoperability with ex-
isting coin acceptor technology. 
Despite the changes to our everyday 
lives brought on by the COVID–19 pan-
demic, coin production is at an all- 
time high. Just this year, the U.S. 
Mint averaged a monthly production 
rate of approximately 1.27 billion coins 
per month for a total of 15.2 billion 
coins over the past 12 months. By com-
parison, the Mint produced 11.9 billion 
coins for all of 2019. 
Since 2006, metal prices have risen to 
where the unit costs of a penny and 
nickel exceed their face value. The U.S. 
Mint estimates that by adjusting the 
metal content of coins, the Federal 
Government could save between $10 
million to $17 million per year. 
This bill would require any proposed 
change in the metallic composition of 
coins to both reduce costs to taxpayers 
and be seamless. This means that the 
diameter, weight, and electromagnetic 
signature of the new coins would oper-
ate interchangeably in most coin ac-
ceptors that use electromagnetic signa-
ture technology, such as vending ma-
chines, laundromats, and the self- 
checkout lines at your local grocery 
stores. 
This commonsense reform provides 
the Mint with the flexibility to save 
taxpayer dollars and avoid future sup-
ply chain disruptions while balancing 
the needs of stakeholders in ensuring 
that any new coins work within the ex-
isting coin acceptance infrastructure. 
This bill is supported by a wide range 
of industry stakeholders, including the 
National Automatic Merchandising As-
sociation, the Coin Laundry Associa-
tion, and the Food Industry Associa-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. AMODEI for 
his work on this bill, and I urge Mem-
bers to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7995, the Coin Metal Modification Au-
thorization and Cost Savings Act of 
2020. 
Mr. Speaker, title 31 of the United 
States Code establishes the monetary 
system on which our Nation relies. 
Section 5112, in particular, sets out the 
parameters by which the Secretary of 
the Treasury is authorized to mint and 
issue the coins that we use on a daily 
basis in the United States. Those pa-
rameters are incredibly detailed. 
For example, there are provisions 
outlining the number of circulating

coin programs, numismatic coins, bet-
ter known as coins used to commemo-
rate a person or event. The provisions 
even depict the metal composition re-
quirements that every coin leaving the 
United States Mint must meet. 
In fact, different coins have different 
composition requirements. For exam-
ple, ‘‘The 5-cent coin is an alloy of 75 
percent copper and 25 percent nickel.’’ 
One quarter and a dime must be ‘‘clad 
. . . with three layers of metal. The 
two identical outer layers are an alloy 
of 75 percent copper and 25 percent 
nickel. The inner layer is copper. The 
outer layers are metallurgically bond-
ed to the inner layer and weigh at least 
30 percent of the weight of the coin.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7995, introduced by 
my colleague, Congressman AMODEI, 
from the great State of Nevada, would 
amend title 31. The bill would allow the 
United States Mint to research and 
make recommendations to Congress re-
garding changes to the metallic com-
position of those circulating coins we 
use every day. 
Once the Mint’s research is complete, 
the Director of the Mint must report to 
Congress any proposed changes it seeks 
to make, including justifications for 
the changes. 
This report to Congress must include 
the following information. First, the 
report must describe how the proposed 
modifications will save taxpayer dol-
lars. The report must describe how the 
modifications 
will 
be 
implemented 
without disrupting the current circula-
tion of coins. Finally, the report must 
show that any modification will have 
minimal negative impact on the public. 
Mr. Speaker, let me make one thing 
clear. This bill maintains Congress’ Ar-
ticle I authority over coins. The bill 
provides that if Congress, the entity 
constitutionally responsible for coin-
age, disagrees with or believes the 
modifications are too burdensome, it 
can stop the process. The bill provides 
for an expedited review process, similar 
to the Congressional Review Act, to 
stop any changes the Mint would 
make. 
This bill may seem like a strange 
idea. Why change the composition of 
coins? Isn’t the old saying: If it isn’t 
broke, don’t fix it? 
Mr. Speaker, recent projections from 
the Mint estimate that the legislation 
would allow for potential savings of $4 
million more annually by changing the 
metal composition of the nickel and 
potential savings of up to $14 million 
annually by changing the dime and 
quarter. These projected numbers do 
not account for the penny, which would 
undoubtedly increase the savings to 
taxpayers. 
Needless to say, these savings are not 
chump change. 
Mr. Speaker, I am not a coin expert. 
But I can say that if the Mint is able to 
save the U.S. taxpayer considerable 
money by altering the metal composi-
tion of circulating coins, we should 
give the coin experts the chance to 
make their case. 
H.R. 7995 makes sense. It is a com-
monsense cost-savings bill. It is for 
this reason that I support this bill, and 
I urge my colleagues to support it as 
well. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. JOHN W. ROSE). 
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
H.R. 7995, the Coin Metal Modification 
Authorization and Cost Savings Act of 
2020. 
I first want to thank the bill’s spon-
sor for his willingness to amend the 
bill to address some of the concerns 
both Members and stakeholders have 
raised. I believe that, as a result, we 
have a better bill before us today. How-
ever, I do not think these changes went 
far enough. 
This legislation still cedes congres-
sional authority and represents a rad-
ical shift in the balance of power. 
Section 8, Clause 5 of Article I of the 
Constitution 
grants 
Congress 
the 
power ‘‘to coin money, regulate the 
value thereof, and of foreign coin, and 
fix the standard of weights and meas-
ures.’’ 
I am having trouble understanding 
why we would willingly hand over a 
duty specifically given to the Congress 
in the Constitution. Historically, Con-
gress has been reluctant to relinquish 
that power to fix the standard of coin 
weight and measure to the executive 
branch and has balked at similar pieces 
of legislation over separation of powers 
concerns. 
We continue to cede congressional 
authority to the executive branch, and 
history reveals disastrous results from 
doing so. I, too, believe we should look 
for efficiency in government as well as 
opportunity to save taxpayer dollars. 
However, it should not come at the 
cost of willfully handing over specific 
duties to us in the Constitution in the 
process. 
Mr. Speaker, although well inten-
tioned, I believe this is an important 
issue that deserves a thoughtful discus-
sion and debate, something a hearing 
would have provided, and its consider-
ation should not be expedited without 
that debate. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I would in-
quire through the Chair if my col-
league has any remaining speakers on 
his side. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, we have two speakers remaining. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. ROE). 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
this bill. This bill would shift the con-
stitutional power to coin money and 
regulate its value from Congress to the 
executive branch. 
While I applaud the effort to give the 
Mint flexibility to reduce costs, this 
bill has the unintended effect of relin-
quishing 
Congress’ 
constitutional 
power to coin money to the executive 
branch. We see this shift of power all 
the time in this body. 
It is the prerogative of Congress to 
regulate the country’s coinage. Let’s 
vote to maintain this prerogative. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to op-
pose suspending the rules and passing 
H.R. 7995. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Nevada (Mr. AMODEI). 
Mr. AMODEI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleagues from Missouri and Ohio 
for their graciousness in granting me 
some time, and also my colleagues 
from Tennessee for their comments. 
In short, this bill is about savings. It 
has already been mentioned, H.R. 7995 
wants to save money when it comes to 
the fact that it costs the Mint almost 
a half-cent to make a nickel. It costs 
them 1.75 cents to make a penny. The 
dime and the quarter are not far be-
hind. 
No disrespect to anybody here who 
has spoken before, but quite frankly, 
when all else fails, read the Constitu-
tion and read the bill. The Constitution 
says that we have the ability to coin 
money, to regulate the value of the 
money, and foreign money, and we also 
have weights and measures. 
H.R. 7995 is not a long bill, ladies and 
gentlemen. Essentially, it is two pages 
long, and it talks about changing the 
metal content. Nowhere in Article I 
does it say anything about the content 
of the metal of the coin. So when my 
colleague from Missouri says this is a 
commonsense measure that is just 
meant to save money, it is like that is 
it. There is no mystery here. 
We lose money on every one of those 
pennies and nickels that we coin. We 
want to regulate. We want to give the 
Mint the ability to regulate the metal 
content. 
I am going to say it once more, and 
then I will stop. We want, through H.R. 
7995, to give the Mint the ability to 
regulate the metal content of the coin. 
None of the things that are covered in 
this provision are in the Constitution, 
with all due respect. 
But guess what? It is not like: Okay, 
that is it. End of analysis. Please sup-
port the bill. 
The last part is this. Despite the fact 
that it is not in there about metal con-
tent and changing any of the specifi-
cally enumerated constitutional provi-
sions, there are still provisions in this 
bill that say: But out of an abundance 
of caution, let’s go ahead and make 
sure that the Congress knows when we 
change the metallic content of a coin, 
with the idea of saving money for tax-
payers, and make sure that other 
stakeholders don’t have objections. 
So, if anything, we have expanded 
the meaning of that provision in the 
Constitution to say, oh, by the way,

let’s talk to Congress and make sure 
they are okay, even though it is not in 
this section. 
So, with all due respect, I would re-
quest your favorable consideration. I 
thank the committee of jurisdiction 
for its look at this, and I urge your 
support. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speak-
er, I am prepared to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I would simply urge my 
colleagues to support H.R. 7995, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan bill is a 
commonsense reform that provides the 
Mint with the flexibility needed to 
meet consumer demand for coins while 
saving taxpayer dollars. 
This bill ensures that modifications 
will operate interchangeably and with-
out disruption to existing coin accep-
tor infrastructure. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
CLAY) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, H.R. 7995, as amend-
ed. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. JOHN W. ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion will be 
postponed. 
f 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess until ap-
proximately 6:30 p.m. today. 
Accordingly (at 5 o’clock and 15 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess.

AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House 
was called to order by the Speaker pro 
tempore (Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Okla-
homa) at 6 o’clock and 28 minutes p.m.

United States Code, to save Federal 
funds by authorizing changes to the

for other purposes, as amended, on 
which the yeas and nays were ordered. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

unanimous consent to be removed as a 
cosponsor on H.R. 2036. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Idaho? 
There was no objection. 
f 
RECOGNIZING ALAN JENNINGS 
(Ms. WILD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Alan Jennings, a constituent 
of mine and a very good friend, who has 
spent decades working to weed out 
hunger and poverty in my community. 
Alan joined the Community Action 
Committee 
of 
the 
Lehigh 
Valley, 
CACLV, as a young man in 1980. For 
the past 30 years, he has served as the 
executive 
director 
of 
the 
agency, 
touching countless lives, challenging 
barriers of race and bias, and working 
to expand diversity in the nonprofit 
sector. 
Now Alan is stepping down to get 
some much-needed rest after a lifetime 
of hard work. 
Under Alan’s leadership, CACLV’s 
funding has increased 30-fold. His en-
tire life’s work has been about building 
a just and equitable society for all. 
From providing food to hungry fami-
lies to raising funds for low-income and 
working-class kids to be the first in 
their families to go to college, Alan has 
lived the mission of community action 
every single day. 
Alan, on behalf of the people of the 
Seventh District, thank you for your 
extraordinary leadership. We are so 
grateful to you. As you begin a new 
chapter, I join people in every corner of 
our community in wishing you the 
very best. 
f 
AMERICAN FRONTLINE WORKERS 
HAVE ANSWERED THE CALL OF 
DUTY 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
KELLER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
throughout American history, genera-
tions of American frontline workers 
have answered the call of duty to sup-
port our Nation, States, and local com-
munities. 
From those in the factories who 
fueled the Allied advance in World War 
II to the men and women who cleared 
the rubble after the attacks on Sep-
tember 11, there is a strong, storied ref-
erence that comes with being a front-
line worker. 
Today, across Pennsylvania’s 12th 
Congressional District and America, 
our nurses, doctors, and healthcare 
providers are answering that call of 
duty. 
In the face of a once-in-a-lifetime 
pandemic and global uncertainty, our 
healthcare 
professionals 
have 
not 
wavered in their mission, exemplifying 
compassion, determination, and resil-
ience. 
Most 
importantly, 
our 
healthcare workers have given our Na-
tion reassurance that we can defeat 
this virus. 
To 
PA–12’s 
frontline 
healthcare 
workers at Evangelical Community 
Hospital, UPMC, Geisinger, Endless 
Mountains, Bucktail Medical, Robert 
Packer, Guthrie Towanda Memorial, 
Troy Community, Divine Providence, 
Mount Nittany, Barnes-Kasson, and 
Tyler Memorial, I know your job is not 
easy, but your impact is felt through-
out our community and across our Na-
tion. Please know that we are forever 
grateful for your service. 
f 
b 1930 
UNITED STATES FOSSIL FUEL 
INDUSTRY 
(Mr. CASTEN of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, imagine that you are a bank-
er reviewing a corporate loan applica-
tion. Over the last decade, competition 
has eroded this company’s market 
share. They slashed prices in response; 
they burned through their cash. 250 
similar companies have gone bankrupt 
since 2014. 
Would you make that loan? 
This is today’s U.S. fossil fuel indus-
try. Since 2010, coal demand is down 45 
percent. Natural gas prices are down 40 
percent. Oil prices are down 45 percent. 
Shale producers have chewed through 
$342 billion of free cash flow. Exxon 
just wrote off $20 billion in value. Wells 
Fargo booked $121 million in sector 
losses. 
And yet, the Office of the Comp-
troller of the Currency has recently 
proposed a rule to mandate that banks 
provide ‘‘fair access to capital’’ to this 
sector. They would force you to use 
your balance sheet to take on excessive 
risk without commensurate return. 
They would reduce our financial sta-
bility and raise our energy costs. 
I look forward to a full-throated and 
bipartisan condemnation of the OCC’s 
attempt to use, dare I say, socialist 
tools to prop up an industry that is un-
able to succeed in the rough-and-tum-
ble world of free-market capitalism. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF WANDA MOODY 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, 
late last week, east Tennessee said 
goodbye to a beloved member of our 
community, Wanda Moody, a close, 
dear friend of mine, and mentor, who 
led incredible careers in the field of 
public 
service 
and 
education. 
She 
passed away on Sunday at the age of 91. 
Wanda was a strong, tough leader 
who spent her entire life making east 
Tennessee 
a 
better 
place, 
Madam 
Speaker. Wanda was a lifelong educa-
tor and early advocate for special edu-
cation. 
In the late 1980s, after leaving the 
city school system, she fought to ex-
pand special education initiatives as an 
assistant commissioner of education 
under 
then-Governor 
LAMAR
ALEX-
ANDER. She later served a similar role 
developing special education programs 
for the City of Knoxville under then- 
Mayor Kyle Testerman. 
Wanda’s success compelled her to run 
and win a seat on the Knox County 
Commission in 1986. She was one of the 
first women to serve on that legislative 
body. 
During her three decades as a Knox 
County Commissioner, Wanda asked 
tough questions and painstakingly re-
viewed budgets and financial docu-
ments. She wasn’t shy of speaking up 
for 
increased 
government 
account-
ability 
and 
transparency, 
Madam 
Speaker. 
Wanda led the charge on many re-
forms that continue to influence Knox 
County government to this day. Even 
after leaving public office in 2006, 
Wanda remained active and influential 
in our community. 
Wanda was one of my oldest friends, 
and her mentorship will forever influ-
ence my public service career. Al-
though she will be greatly missed, I am

HONORING THE LIFE OF MRS. 
MARY WOODRUFF 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to rise today to rec-
ognize Mrs. Mary Woodruff of Amherst 
County, Virginia, who turned 104 years 
young last week. 
Born and raised in Amherst, Mrs. 
Woodruff and her husband of 63 years 
built their iconic country store in 1952 
with their own two hands, near the site 
where Mary’s grandfather opened the 
first Black-owned business in the coun-
ty. 
For decades they served their com-
munity, providing groceries to locals 
and gas to travelers, all while raising 
five children and several foster chil-
dren in the apartment above the store. 
This multigenerational family busi-
ness was reinvented as Woodruff’s Cafe 
and Pie Shop by Mary’s youngest 
daughter, Angela Scott, in 1998. Since 
then, business has been booming, at-
tracting patrons from far and wide to 
try their delicious pies, including a 
visit from Al Roker from the ‘‘Today’’ 
show last year. 
To this day, nearly 70 years after 
opening the country store’s doors, the 
104-year-old Mary Woodruff still works 
at the shop and ‘‘holds court’’ at the 
back table where she greets customers 
and tells stories. Mrs. Woodruff, her 
family, and the pies are truly a bless-
ing to our central Virginia community. 
I wish Mrs. Woodruff a very happy 
birthday, and I look forward to stop-
ping by the shop sometime soon. 
f 
HOLDING FOREIGN COMPANIES 
ACCOUNTABLE 
(Mr. BARR asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of S. 945, the Holding 
Foreign Companies Accountable Act. 
The United States has the most ro-
bust, liquid, and advanced capital mar-
kets in the world. Companies from 
around the globe flock to the U.S. cap-
ital markets to fund their businesses. 
However, to participate in our mar-
kets, companies need to play by our 
rules, and Chinese firms listed on 
American exchanges are the worst and 
most frequent violators of the rules. 
Gone are the days when we can sit 
idly by and let Chinese firms, many 
with strong ties to the Chinese Com-
munist Party, participate in our mar-
kets at the expense of protection for 
everyday investors. 
Most publicly traded firms are au-
dited by public accounting firms which, 
in turn, are overseen by the PCAOB. 
This gives investors confidence that 
the books are accurate. China, how-
ever, refuses to let the PCAOB review 
its auditors. 
The results are that investors lack 
confidence in the validity and reli-
ability of a company’s financial data. 
Worse, thousands of investors are de-
frauded. And the worst case scenario, 
American savers are funding Chinese 
state-owned enterprises which are fuel-
ing China’s civil-military fusion and, 
in some cases, directly financing Chi-
na’s military space and cyberspace 
buildup, threatening U.S. national se-
curity. 
As a member of the China Task 
Force, I strongly support this legisla-
tion. I urge this body to pass it. And we 
can no longer allow China to take ad-
vantage of our rules and defraud our 
investors. 
f 
CELEBRATING 
BETTY 
AND 
ELLINGTON PEEK’S 70TH WED-
DING ANNIVERSARY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, on 
Thanksgiving Day this year, Betty and 
Ellington Peek were also celebrating 
something else, their 70th wedding an-
niversary. 
After meeting at a dance in 1950, 
Betty and Ellington got married and 
moved to Oakdale, California, which is 
a well-known ranching and rodeo town 
south of Sacramento. 
Shortly after that, Ellington was 
drafted for the Korean war and he 
served in our military for 1 year. He 
came home to Betty and their first son, 
Andy, who was born while he was over-
seas. They lived in both Susanville and 
then later the Cottonwood/Anderson 
area, running auction yards for cattle 
until Ellington was finally able to live 
the dream and buy the Shasta Auction 
Yard that he had worked at for so 
many years. 
For over 30 years, Ellington and 
Betty have been staples, not just in

their innovative way of doing business,

AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL 
SCLEROSIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
FLETCHER). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FOR-
TENBERRY) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, when I was about 8 years old, I read 
a book. It was on a famous New York 
Yankee 
first 
baseman 
named 
Lou 
Gehrig. He was nicknamed ‘‘The Iron 
Horse’’ because of his great athletic 
ability. He could hit, he could field. His 
durability was legendary. As a great 
athlete, his character was marked by 
that ability to adjust and overcome. 
But 
then 
something 
happened. 
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis caused 
Lou Gehrig to lose control of his bodily 
functions. That famous durability of 
his was mocked by this cruel, unfor-
giving, 
neurodegenerative 
disease, 
which is aggressive, that we now know 
as ALS. There was no cure then and 
there is no cure now. ALS has also 
come to be known as Lou Gehrig’s dis-
ease. 
But before he died in 1941, Madam 
Speaker, at a ceremony at the home 
plate in Yankee Stadium, Lou Gehrig 
looked up at the crowd and he said: 
For the past 2 weeks, you’ve been reading 
about a bad break. Yet today, I consider my-
self the luckiest man on the face of the 
Earth. 
That 
story, 
Lou 
Gehrig’s 
story, 
stayed with me as a child. 
Now, Madam Speaker, as a Member 
of the United States Congress, fast for-
ward decades later. This same cruel 
disease has swept upon my own family 
and we, as a family, quickly learned 
about the profound trauma it has 
caused so many other Americans. 
ALS takes about 2 to 5 years to de-
stroy a body and exhaust a family. It is 
100 percent fatal. Its victims lose the 
ability to write and walk and talk and 
eat and move and, finally, to breathe. 
Earlier this year, several hundred 
persons deeply affected from ALS, 
along with their courageous caregivers 
and friends, joined me and another 
Member of Congress on the other side 
of this body to discuss a legislative ini-
tiative. 
We are all now really familiar with 
Zoom calls, and on that particular 
Zoom call, on the little chat box on the 
side of the screen, one kind person said: 
‘‘I wish all of America could hear this 
constructive 
conversation 
between 
Members of Congress.’’ 
Madam Speaker, we are in the midst 
of a horrific pandemic. COVID–19 has 
become a daily reminder of our fra-
gility and mortality. It is an urgent 
health crisis, and scientists and gov-
ernment regulators worldwide are re-
sponding to this urgency, as are we, by 
accelerating the testing and improving 
approval processes for treatments and 
vaccines. 
I recently discussed these dynamics 
with our Food and Drug Administra-
tion Commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, 
who was optimistic that we may just 
be able to put this pandemic behind us 
by early summer. 
So, Madam Speaker, I divert for a 
moment because I want to applaud the

speedy success in getting vaccines 
quickly and safely approved, and I am 
hopeful for their swift delivery to those 
most in need. 
But as we continue to fight our way 
through this global pandemic, imagine 
for a moment that we could harness 
that same determination and goodwill 
to rethink how we fight numerous 
other diseases. 
Madam Speaker, in over 50 years, 
there have been 50 clinical trials for 
ALS. ALS patients have submitted 
themselves to these tests in accordance 
with the rules of the current regu-
latory framework. Many of them re-
ceived placebo therapies. All of them 
stopped receiving treatment when the 
trials were done, even if the therapies 
were affording some relief. They sac-
rificed their lives to science, then they 
quietly and gradually weakened and 
died. 
As we all know, drug trials can drag 
on for a decade or longer. Most ALS 
victims do not live that long. This 
overly deliberate regulatory process 
does not match the urgency of the dis-
ease. It is not saving lives; it is killing 
hope. 
Madam Speaker, when a process isn’t 
working, it is time to change the proc-
ess. 
So, I am proud of something, Madam 
Speaker. We have a new bill. It is bi-
partisan and it is bicameral. The House 
and the Senate are working together 
on this. It is called Accelerating Access 
to Critical Therapies for ALS. Let me 
put it another way; it is called ACT for 
ALS. It accelerates access for patients 
with rapidly progressing diseases to-
ward 
investigational 
treatments 
through a new public-private program 
coordinated by the Department of 
Health and Human Services. 
The bill provides expanded access to 
promising therapies through public- 
private funding, so that more patients 
suffering terminal diseases, like ALS, 
can access potentially life-extending 
therapy. It also works toward a more 
consistent and streamlined review of 
drug applications. 
ACT for ALS is just a beginning ef-
fort to make the regulatory and re-
search establishment more responsive 
to patients suffering right now. It does 
so by attacking and correcting the in-
justices and inequities at the core of 
our drug development and healthcare 
systems. 
It is nobody’s fault. We set up a re-
search paradigm. We set up a regu-
latory process in order to try to give 
order to the process of helping people. 
But it is now time to reexamine some 
fundamental premises, particularly in 
this disease category and others. 
Currently, our ACT for ALS has 217 
cosponsors, nearly half this body, more 
and more every day. 
Key to this effort, Madam Speaker, 
have been the many, many courageous 
ALS survivors who are advocating for 
this bill. 
Now, one of those is 36-year-old 
Mayuri Saxena. 
I want to show you something, 
Madam 
Speaker. 
Four 
years 
ago, 
Mayuri was diagnosed with ALS and 
today she can no longer stand or walk, 
use her legs or arms, swallow without 
help, and she cannot speak. 
But let’s go back to that earlier 
point I made about Lou Gehrig’s dura-
bility. This is Mayuri’s mind. By com-
municating with her eyes and telling 
an artist what she saw, she imagined 
this beautiful painting. 
b 1945 
I wanted to first bring it up here be-
cause it is quite extraordinary. You 
could apply it to so many lessons 
around here, Madam Speaker. The 
symbols of our two political parties, 
the elephant and the donkey, are 
chaining themselves to someone in 
need with the hope of our great coun-
try, our symbol, transcending above. 
Mayuri sees that as her hope and 
America’s hope. I have never seen 
something 
so 
beautifully 
and 
elo-
quently expressed as a call for these 
Washington words that we use, like bi-
partisanship. It is simply a call to care 
and to compassion and to be smart. 
This act is well-researched. We have 
gotten technical assistance from the 
Food and Drug Administration, as well 
as the National Institutes of Health. 
We have worked with those who are 
representing and advocating for new 
movement to figure out the right set of 
processes by which we again can estab-
lish a new procedure inside the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services 
and expanded access to treatments. We 
can do this. As we are rushing to the 
end of the year, we have got a lot of 
problems, and we have very few days to 
solve them. But let’s solve this one. 
Madam Speaker, ALS affects 30,000 
Americans, 6,000 of whom will die every 
year from the disease. One in six of 
those, by the way, Madam Speaker, is 
a veteran. One such veteran is Pat 
Quinn, by whom our country, through 
his effort, was socialized and embraced 
this Ice Bucket Challenge. He thought 
of that in order to raise global aware-
ness of the brutality of the disease. Pat 
Quinn just recently died. 
Madam Speaker, it has been 75 years 
since Lou Gehrig himself died. There is 
still no cure, though there are some 
now promising therapies and drugs. 
Again, the ACT for ALS would allow 
expanded access now to those prom-
ising therapies and drugs. 
Madam Speaker, I have met so many 
beautiful people who have come to my 
office to explain their own journey 
with ALS. These are people of good 
heart. They are courageous, they are 
fighters, and they have created a net-
work of solidarity trying to rethink 
more creatively as to how to attack 
through sound science the underlying 
disease. They represent a movement 
that has a strong desire for the right 
type of science and a real hope to stop 
the suffering. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
COVID–19 
has 
shown us one thing: we can act quickly 
if we want to. We can act quickly if we 
are determined. 
I think it is time to apply those les-
sons to diseases that have silently 
killed so many for so long. We can cre-
ate, and we have to create, a more hu-
mane response and a responsive system 
for those in need. Especially for dis-
eases like this, where the time is so 
narrow. 
Madam Speaker, about 4 years ago 
now, a young man in his thirties was 
diagnosed with this disease. He noticed 
his hand trembling. He went through a 
battery of tests, but the moment he no-
ticed that, he knew—for whatever rea-
son he knew—in his heart of hearts it 
was the worst case scenario. He knew 
it was ALS. I don’t know how he knew, 
he just knew. He and his wife struggled 
and hoped that it would be something 
else that they could possibly live with. 
But he died this spring, about 4 years 
after he contracted the disease, leaving 
behind his wife and his four little chil-
dren. His name is Joe Gregory. He is 
my wife’s little brother. 
Madam Speaker, for Joe, for the art-
ist, for the imaginative artistry of 
Mayuri, for the memory of Lou Gehrig 
and Pat Quinn, and for all of those who 
are still suffering from this cruel, re-
lentless, and unforgiving disease, let’s 
make hope real. Let’s work to get this 
done. 
As I said, I have worked and seen so 
many beautiful people, some of whom 
have expressed to our office that their 
wish on their deathbed, communicated 
through their families, was that this 
act would pass. When I reflect on that, 
Madam Speaker, again, we have got 
numerous other problems here. We 
have to get a budget done, we have to 
avoid a government shutdown, and we 
probably ought to come together on a 
new COVID-type relief package. I am 
working on that, too. 
But how could I not speak? 
Why did I read a book on Lou Gehrig 
when I was 8 years old that stayed with 
me all these years? 
I don’t know. 
But how could I not speak on behalf 
of these beautiful people who just want 
us to do the right thing, not out of 
anger and not out of protest, but out of 
solidarity to show that we can get 
things done because we care? 
When we act with our will and re-
solve, we can help. 
Madam Speaker, one more thing be-
fore I leave, I keep reflecting on those 
words of Lou Gehrig. I don’t suffer 
from ALS. I don’t pretend to know the 
profound difficulty that causes in those 
individuals’ hearts, but I can say this: 
I believe that I am also the luckiest 
man alive because I get to stand with 
people like this and try to help. 
Madam Speaker, I thank you for lis-
tening, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.

S7143 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2020 
No. 203 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Righteous 
God, 
refresh 
our 
law-
makers as a river in the desert and as 
the cool shadows of large trees in a hot 
and weary land. May our Senators find 
in You a hope that illuminates the 
paths they travel as You guide them 
with Your great love. 
Lord, fill them with such wisdom 
that they will solve our Nation’s most 
challenging 
problems, 
making 
the 
rough places smooth and the crooked 
places straight. Deal favorably with 
them because of Your great love and 
mercy. Inspire them to live lives that 
will permit You to bless our Nation 
and world. 
We pray in Your mighty Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROM-
NEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
USDA RULEMAKING REVISIONS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
want to tell my colleagues about a dis-
appointment I have in some U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture recent revi-
sions of a proposed rule. 
Here is the background: I have long 
fought to strengthen the safety net so 
that Iowa family farmers and other 
farmers are protected from natural dis-
asters or other unforeseen events that 
they have no control over, like flooding 
or wind storms. 
Family farmers work hard to make 
sure that Americans have food on the 
table. These same family farmers oper-
ate on very thin margins. These farm-
ers ought to qualify for help during 
tough times since losing these oper-
ations would risk our Nation’s food 
supply. 
However, 
taxpayers 
and 
nonfarm 
State lawmakers may stop supporting 
a Federal farm safety net if spending 
programs aren’t held accountable or 
left unchecked. Losing urban support 
for this farm safety net is why I am 
deeply concerned about the USDA’s re-
cent proposal to roll back rules that 
put teeth in the definition of a legal 
term called ‘‘actively engaged in farm-
ing.’’ 
Long-lost 
relatives, 
by 
changing 
these rules, who have probably never 
lifted a finger on the farm should not 
get away with collecting farm pay-
ments. Farm payments should only go 
to operators that—and I have a defini-
tion that is a little facetious but some-
what realistic—unless they have dirt 
under their fingernails. 
A few weeks ago, I recently com-
plimented Secretary Perdue on what I 
thought were very strong rules that 
were being proposed at that time. Now 
the USDA’s decision to backtrack on 
their rules means more megafarmers 
will take advantage of this loophole 
and people who aren’t actively engaged 
in farming will benefit from farm pay-
ments. I am disappointed with this 
turnaround. 
Once again, Congress must do what it 
can to oppose these loopholes so that 
we have only family farmers benefiting 
from the farm program. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
when I opened the Senate on Monday, I 
repeated something Republicans have 
stated for months now. We need to put 
partisanship aside and get more bipar-
tisan, targeted coronavirus relief out 
to the American people. 
Dating back to the summer, and all 
fall, Senate Republicans tried repeat-
edly to advance hundreds of billions of 
dollars to prevent layoffs, protect 
small businesses, fund vaccine distribu-
tion, and continue assisting workers 
who have already lost their jobs due to 
the crisis. Every time, the Speaker of 
the House and the Democratic leader 
blocked our efforts. It had to be the en-
tirety of their leftwing wish list or 
nothing at all. 
Finally, this week, we are seeing 
cracks starting to form in the Demo-
cratic leaders’ stone wall, and thank 
goodness for the country that that is 
finally happening. In the last several 
days, the Democratic leaders have sig-
naled a new willingness to engage in 
good faith and, yesterday, a number of 
Senate Democrats proposed a different 
compromise. 
But at the risk of repeating some-
thing we all know, making law will not 
just require the Senate’s approval but 
also the signature of the President of 
the United States. 
So, after several conversations with 
the Secretary of the Treasury and the 
White House Chief of Staff, I put for-
ward yesterday another proposal re-
flecting what the President is ready to 
sign into law. What we have proposed 
would give universities and nonprofits 
the legal certainty they need. It would 
create a second draw on the job-saving 
Paycheck Protection Program to pre-
vent more layoffs, and it would extend

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7144 
December 2, 2020 
two important emergency unemploy-
ment benefit programs that were cre-
ated by the CARES Act and which will 
expire in December without action. 
These programs have been championed 
by our Democratic colleagues, particu-
larly the senior Senator from Virginia, 
and we made sure they were included 
in the framework. 
I hope our Democratic colleagues 
will finally let Congress pass a bipar-
tisan bill that the President will likely 
sign into law and do so soon. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO LAMAR ALEXANDER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on a completely different matter, 
the Senate revolves around people. 
The body consists of 100 individuals. 
One of our key duties concerns the per-
sonnel whom we examine and confirm, 
and there are all these dedicated staff 
professionals who make this place go. 
Today, it is both my great honor and 
regrettable task to honor someone who 
secured all three parts of that senato-
rial triple crown: the senior Senator 
from Tennessee, the chairman of the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions, LAMAR
ALEX-
ANDER. 
LAMAR first set foot here as a tal-
ented young staffer. Decades later, he 
appeared before us as a supersuccessful 
former Governor and university presi-
dent with a nomination to the Cabinet. 
And for the past 18 years, the other 99 
of us have gotten to serve alongside 
one of the most impactful Senators in 
modern American history. 
I have known LAMAR for more than 50 
years. We first met in 1969, when I was 
working for a freshman Senator named 
Marlow Cook and he worked down in 
the executive branch. We met at the 
suggestion of his previous boss and 
mentor, Senator Howard Baker. Either 
he suspected our paths might cross 
again later or he just saw two serious 
young guys in need of some livelier so-
cial lives. Now, this may shock the 
Presiding Officer, but I am afraid 
young LAMAR ALEXANDER and young 
MITCH MCCONNELL did not exactly go 
crazy and paint the town red. But I will 
take a five-decade friendship any day. 
Both of us headed back home to con-
tinue our careers. It was already clear 
that a bright future in elected office 
likely lay in store for him. 
LAMAR’s reverence for public service 
started early. I believe he was about 10 
years old when his father, himself a 
longtime local official, took him to 
meet his hometown Congressman, How-
ard Baker, Sr. The father of his future 
boss shook the boy’s hand and handed 
him a dime. I think LAMAR was hooked, 
then and there. 
Decades 
later, 
when 
LAMAR
an-
nounced his 1996 Presidential run, he 
was in his hometown of Maryville. His 
speech began with a story about his 
mother. She had read where he had lov-
ingly described his upbringing as lower 
middle class, and she had taken um-
brage to that. After all, LAMAR had a 
library card and music lessons. In her 
words, ‘‘everything you needed that 
was important.’’ 
And I would certainly add loving par-
ents to that list. 
This son of two educators grew up 
steeped in the importance of schooling. 
He would later reference his mother’s 
work in early childhood education by 
saying he is probably the only Sec-
retary of Education in history—in his-
tory—who spent 5 years in kinder-
garten. 
That passion would remain through-
out LAMAR’s career. His cutting-edge 
focus on improving opportunities and 
reforming education benefited Ten-
nessee hugely in the 1980s, and our 
whole Nation during his time in Presi-
dent Bush 41’s Cabinet. 
But that isn’t the only way LAMAR 
has honored his roots. You couldn’t 
walk across the entire State of Ten-
nessee in a plaid shirt, get elected Gov-
ernor before the age of 40, and serve 
more combined years as Governor and 
Senator than anyone else in the his-
tory of the Volunteer State without be-
coming entirely intertwined with the 
place. Every corner of the State is bet-
ter for his service. His groundbreaking 
work to bring home good-paying auto 
jobs has paid dividends, so has his 
major focus on infrastructure and bet-
ter roads. 
But alas, even building a statewide 
and then national reputation does not 
always, always, translate into honest- 
to-goodness celebrity status. 
I understand that following LAMAR’s 
Governorship, a stretch of highway in 
Maryville was fittingly named the 
Lamar Alexander Parkway to honor 
him. I further understand that some-
time later, LAMAR was driving on that 
very road and stopped for breakfast. 
When it was time to pay for his food, 
he handed over his credit card. The 
woman on the other side of the counter 
glanced at the name on the card, and 
then back at LAMAR. ‘‘Hey,’’ she said, 
‘‘were you named after this road?’’ 
Now, as a man of faith, I am certain 
LAMAR
knows Luke, chapter 4: ‘‘No 
prophet is accepted in his hometown.’’ 
Apparently, neither are statesmen to 
be recognized on their own highway. 
Here in the Senate, too, LAMAR’s im-
pact has been massive, and the convic-
tions that fueled it have been straight-
forward. He starts with a very firm 
framework: the right-of-center prin-
ciples that Ronald Reagan used to re-
build a confident, prosperous America 
and beat communism. The Federal 
Government isn’t meant to take over 
our States, neighborhoods, or our lives. 
But LAMAR’s career has also confirmed 
that conservative governance is not a 
contradiction in terms. There are gen-
uine public goods it is the govern-
ment’s job to secure: public roads, pub-
lic lands, public education, certain as-
pects of public health. He has dedicated 
himself to making those things better 
and stronger, especially for those who 
need opportunity the most. 
This vision aligns with the greatest 
traditions of the Republican Party and 
indeed of American history—govern-
ment that is limited but effective and 
smart; a system where power stays 
close to the people and working fami-
lies can thrive and prosper. These prin-
ciples made our colleague a nationally 
known leader long before he was sworn 
in as a Senator. But I would say they 
have reached full flourishing with 
Chairman ALEXANDER’s astonishingly 
effective leadership right here in this 
body. 
Students, families, and teachers ben-
efit every day from the Every Student 
Succeeds Act, Chairman ALEXANDER’s 
historic, 
bipartisan 
makeover 
fol-
lowing No Child Left Behind. One re-
port called it ‘‘the largest devolution of 
federal control to the states in a quar-
ter century.’’ 
Millions 
of 
medically 
vulnerable 
Americans also have their champion in 
our friend from Tennessee. The over-
whelmingly bipartisan 21st Century 
Cures Act was the single most impor-
tant law of the entire 114th Congress. It 
is paving the way for more innovation 
and faster innovation to benefit pa-
tients who have no time to waste—an-
other LAMAR ALEXANDER production. 
His leadership was instrumental in 
the landmark legislation we passed 2 
years ago to combat the opioid epi-
demic. 
Just this year, he was the driving 
force behind the Great American Out-
doors Act, the Senate’s historic project 
to secure our parks and public lands for 
generations to come. 
The list doesn’t end there. There 
have been other education wins, like 
permanent 
funding 
for 
historically 
Black colleges and universities and 
simplifying the student loan process. 
There have been laws like the Music 
Modernization Act, which LAMAR ham-
mered out with our former colleague, 
Senator Hatch—a legislative duet from 
two musical virtuosos in their own 
rights. 
Senator ALEXANDER knows about 50 
different issues as well as most Sen-
ators know 3 or 4. He is hands down one 
of the most brilliant, most thoughtful, 
and most effective legislators any of us 
have ever seen. 
He likes to say this about the Senate: 
‘‘It’s hard to get here; it’s hard to stay 
here; so while you’re here, you might 
as well try to accomplish something.’’ 
Well, mission accomplished—and then 
some. 
If you reviewed Senator ALEXANDER’s 
resume and results without knowing 
the man, you might suspect he arrived 
as an established hotshot and threw his 
weight around. But even as LAMAR has 
mastered the levers of power here, his 
character has never been captured by 
Washington. LAMAR has remained clear 
that he has just been on loan from Ten-
nessee the whole time. 
So we have had more than just a 
master legislator to call upon; we have 
been blessed with a sober, honest, and 
deliberate 
statesman—someone 
who 
cares as much about preserving this in-
stitution as the near-term results he 
can wring out of it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7145 
December 2, 2020 
From daily conversations to com-
mittee business, to the most dramatic 
moments on the floor, whether in the 
minority or the majority, LAMAR has 
taken pains to treat his colleagues ex-
actly as he would hope to be treated in 
their shoes. He has worked to build 
consensus in a consensus-based body. 
He has cherished and defended the Sen-
ate the Framers designed. 
It is no exaggeration to say LAMAR 
ALEXANDER is one of the most brilliant 
people I have met in my life. His mind 
is a steel trap. I understand he likes to 
keep his staff experts locked around a 
conference table for long sessions, 
turning a complex issue over and over 
until they have arrived at the best 
path forward for the country and the 
most precise, concise way to commu-
nicate it. He has a mastery of policy, 
mastery of the English language, and I 
can’t forget to mention my friend’s 
good cheer. 
LAMAR really does live by the motto 
he inherited from his good friend and 
fellow Tennesseean, the late author 
Alex Haley: ‘‘Find the good and praise 
it.’’ 
I myself have leaned on LAMAR’s wis-
dom for many years, but I think I have 
learned just as much from his opti-
mism, his can-do spirit, and his ability 
to look on the bright side and then dis-
cern how some more hard work can 
make it brighter still. So I am going to 
miss our regular dinners, even with our 
weeknight scheduling and official one- 
drink limit. Like I said, we weren’t ex-
actly party animals in our twenties ei-
ther. 
But here is something else that never 
changes: How reassuring it is to be 
weighing a thorny question and see 
LAMAR ALEXANDER seated across the 
table. You know, the Senate can be all- 
consuming. It is not only our col-
leagues but their spouses and loved 
ones who all get folded into the ex-
tended family around here. So I am ex-
tremely grateful that it turned out 
that MITCH MCCONNELL was not the 
most important young person LAMAR 
ALEXANDER
met during his stint in 
Washington—not by a mile. 
Honey Alexander is a remarkable 
woman. She is a force of nature and in-
credible partner for LAMAR. She raised 
a young family in the Governor’s man-
sion for 8 years. She charmed and im-
pressed more voters during LAMAR’s 
various campaigns than LAMAR him-
self, and she has devoted her own ca-
reer to public health and philanthropy. 
Their shared love and mutual respect 
inspire everyone. Honey is just about 
the finest ‘‘in-law’’ the U.S. Senate 
could have ever had, so Elaine and I are 
grateful to call her our friend as well. 
So as much as I am dreading life in 
the Senate without my brilliant friend, 
even I can’t begrudge him the silver 
lining. The most distinguished public 
servant has more than earned the right 
to spend more days fly-fishing or walk-
ing trails in the Smokies, more morn-
ings waking up on Blackberry Farm, 
and a much larger share of his time 
with Honey and their family. 
About 6 years ago, it fell to LAMAR to 
eulogize his friend and mentor, Howard 
Baker. Here on the floor, he quoted an-
other Senator who had said that when 
it came to the Senate, there was How-
ard Baker, and then there was the rest 
of us. 
Well, my friend, for 18 years, there 
has been LAMAR ALEXANDER, and there 
has been the rest of us. So I am sorry 
that in a few more weeks, it will be 
just the rest of us left. But you are 
leaving this body and those of us in it 
and the Nation it exists to serve 
stronger and better because you were 
here.

f 
TRIBUTE TO LAMAR ALEXANDER 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, 
let me add my words of fond farewell to 
my friend LAMAR ALEXANDER and the 
touching moment between the leader 
and the senior Senator from Tennessee, 
which is moving to all of us. 
Now, Senator ALEXANDER and I have 
not always agreed, but what an amaz-
ing and capable legislator and true 
statesman he has been. He has been in 
the middle of things for much of his 18 
years in the Senate. That is because he 
is not some ideologue who stood alone 
in his corner. It is because he is some-
one who has been always willing and 
insistent on reaching across the aisle, 
on hearing another Senator’s perspec-
tive, and on searching for common 
ground, however narrow it may be. He 
searches to do the right thing. 
I remember when we did the immi-
gration bill. There was a lot of pressure 
on Senator ALEXANDER to vote against 
it, and I watched him wrestle with it 
and churn and churn, and I sort of 
knew in my heart he would do the 
right thing, in my judgment, and vote 
for that bill, as he did, at some real po-
litical consequence to himself. And 
that is who he was and is—a man of 
principle. 
We often would talk in the Senate 
gym almost every morning for a pro-
longed period of time—I don’t go to the 
Senate gym post-COVID—and more 
often than not, we found each other on 
opposite sides of the Senate gym. We 
helped open up the amendment process 
on childcare legislation. Together, we 
led the Rules Committee for a number 
of years, and we come from very dif-
ferent backgrounds. But I will never 
forget the weekend that Iris and I 
spent with Honey and LAMAR at Black-
berry Farms, and it was a beautiful 
weekend for us that we will always, al-
ways cherish and remember. 
Given the opportunity to put a stamp 
on 
the 
Presidential 
inauguration, 
LAMAR and I said whoever is in the ma-
jority—we didn’t know—we would give 
each other time to speak, and it served 
us both well. This is the kind of person 
he has been: someone who is willing to 
reach out; someone who is willing to 
see the other side; and someone, above 
all, in tumultuous and very difficult 
times for all of us, who is a man of 
principle and conscience. 
Senator ALEXANDER will leave this 
Chamber with a legacy that every Sen-
ator would be proud of. I wish him and 
his family the very best. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MARK KELLY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now a few other re-
marks. We have a going and we have a 
coming, and our coming is of a new 
Senator who will be installed today, 
and that is CAPT Mark Kelly, who will 
be sworn in as the next Senator from 
Arizona. 
It may not be the role he expected for 
himself earlier in his life as a U.S. 
Navy captain and then an astronaut 
aboard the International Space Sta-
tion. As Mark likes to say, his wife 
Gabby was already the member of the 
family in Congress. But tragedy upend-
ed both their lives and changed so

many of their plans. Everyone con-
tinues to be inspired by Gabby’s recov-
ery, by Mark’s devotion, and by the 
courage it took for their family to re-
enter public life and public service. But 
that is who Mark Kelly is—a devoted 
and honorable man—and we are de-
lighted to welcome him to the Senate 
Democratic caucus and the wider Sen-
ate family. 
So a fond adieu to my friend LAMAR, 
and a fond welcome to my new friend 
Mark Kelly. 
I have some more remarks on the 
topics, but I think I will defer those, 
with unanimous consent that I could 
talk about those later, so we can get 
right to Senator ALEXANDER’s remarks 
at the 10:30 scheduled time.

FAREWELL TO THE SENATE 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I 
thank my friend Mitch, and I thank my 
friend Chuck for their remarks. I will 
have more to say to them later. 
On March 9, 1967, Senator Howard H. 
Baker, Jr., the newly elected Senator 
from Tennessee, made his maiden ad-
dress, his first speech on the floor of 
the U.S. Senate. He spoke for too long. 
The Republican leader of the Senate, 
who was also Baker’s father-in-law, 
Senator Everett M. Dirksen, walked 
over to congratulate him and then 
said, ‘‘Howard, occasionally, you might 
enjoy the luxury of an unexpressed 
thought,’’ which is good advice for a 
farewell address as well. 
As Senator Baker’s legislative assist-
ant, I was also his speech writer for 
that maiden address, or at least I 
thought I was. He had developed a bad 
habit of not saying what I wrote for his 
speech. So I asked to see him, and I 
said: Do we have a problem with our re-
lationship? 
He said: No, we have a perfect rela-
tionship. You write what you want to 
write, and I will say what I want to 
say. 
I learned a couple of other things 
about ‘‘saying what I want to say.’’ 
One came from Alex Haley, the author 
of ‘‘Roots,’’ who heard me speak once 
and called me aside afterward and said: 
May I make a suggestion? He said: If, 
when you begin a speech, you would 
start by saying, ‘‘Instead of making a 
speech, let me tell you a story,’’ some-
one might actually listen to what you 
have to say. 
And then, from David Broder, who 
gave this advice to Ruth Marcus when 
she got her column for the Washington 
Post: one idea per column. 
So here is a story about my one idea 
for this speech. 
In August of 1968, Senator Baker was 
in the Republican leader’s office, where 
Senator MCCONNELL is today. He over-
heard this conversation. Senator Dirk-
sen was saying: 
[No,] Mr. President, I cannot come down 
and have a drink with you tonight. I did that 
last night and Louella is very unhappy with 
me. 
About 30 minutes later, there was a 
commotion out in the hall, and in the 
door of the Republican leader’s office 
came two beagles, three Secret Service 
men, and the President of the United 
States. And Lyndon Johnson said to 
Everett Dirksen: ‘‘Everett, if you won’t 
come down and have a drink with me, 
I’m here to have one with you.’’ And 
they disappeared into the back room. 
Later that same year, around a long 
table, in that same office, the Demo-
cratic President and the Republican 
leader worked out the Civil Rights Act 
of 1968. It took 67 votes to break a fili-
buster, but when the bill passed and 
Johnson signed it, the Senators who 
voted no went home and said: It is the 
law. We have to accept it. 
And it still is today, along with 
many other civil rights laws. 
So that is the one idea I have for this 
speech. Our country needs a U.S. Sen-
ate to work across party lines to force 
broad agreements on hard issues, cre-
ating laws that most of us have voted 
for and that a diverse country will ac-
cept. 
In the 1930s, we needed a Senate to 
create Social Security; after World 
War II, the United Nations; in the 
1960s, Medicare; in 1978, to ratify the 
Panama Canal Treaty; in 2013, more re-
cently, to tie interest rates for student 
loans to the market rates, saving stu-
dent borrowers hundreds of billions of 
dollars in the last several years; in 
2015, to fix No Child Left Behind. 
That bill had 100 alligators in the 
swamp. The Wall Street Journal said, 
when we finished, that it was the larg-
est evolution of power from Wash-
ington to the States in 25 years. When 
President Obama signed it, he said it 
was ‘‘a Christmas miracle’’ because, in 
the end, 85 Senators voted for it. In 
2016, 
as 
Senator 
MCCONNELL
men-
tioned, there was the 21st Century 
Cures Act, moving medical miracles 
faster to patients and into doctors’ of-
fices. That bill ran off the track every 
2 or 3 days. On one of those days, I 
called the Vice President, Joe Biden. I 
said: Joe, I am stuck in the White 
House. I have the President’s personal-
ized medicine in this. I have your Can-
cer MoonShot. Senator MCCONNELL’s 
regenerative medical proposal is in it. 
Speaker Ryan has worked out a way to 
pay for it. But I can’t get the White 
House to move. I feel like the butler 
standing outside the Oval Office with a 
silver platter, and nobody will open the 
door and take the order. 
And Joe Biden said: If you want to 
feel like the butler, try being Vice 
President. 
Well, in the next few weeks, the Sen-
ate rules literally forced us to come to 
an agreement, and, in the end, we al-
most all voted for it. Senator MCCON-
NELL said then, as he said today, it was 
‘‘the most important legislation’’ of 
that Congress. And, today, it is helping 
to create vaccines and treatments in 
record time. Then, in 2018, there was a 
once-in-a-generation 
change 
in 
the 
copyright laws to help songwriters be 
fairly paid; this year, the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act. Everyone agrees 
that it is the most important outdoor 
and environmental bill in 50 years. 
All of that took a long time, a lot of 
palavering, many amendments, many 
years. Too many years, civil rights ad-
vocates, 
students, 
patients, 
song-
writers, and conservationists would 
say. But the point was that those bills 
didn’t just pass. They passed by big 
margins. The country accepted them, 
and they are going to be there for a 
long time, and most of them were en-
acted during divided government, when 
the Presidency and at least one body of 
Congress was of different political par-
ties. 
That offers an opportunity to share 
the responsibility or the blame for 
doing hard things, like controlling the 
Federal debt. That is why our country 
needs a U.S. Senate, to thoughtfully 
and carefully and intentionally put 
country before partisanship and per-
sonal politics, to force broad agree-
ments on controversial issues that be-
come laws that most of us will vote for 
and that a diverse country will accept. 
Nearly 60 years ago, I had traveled 
from my home in the mountains of 
Tennessee to New York University’s 
Law School in Manhattan, on Wash-
ington Square. It was my first trip ever 
to New York City, and I had asked for 
a roommate whose background was as 
different from mine as possible. One of 
those roommates turned out to be a 
tall skinny guy from New Jersey. When 
I would go to his home in New Jersey 
and spend the night—his mother was a 
seamstress and his dad was a con-
tractor; 
they 
were 
Italian 
immi-
grants—his mother would become so 
concerned about my frayed collar on 
my one white dress shirt that she 
would turn it while I slept. 
Years later, that roommate, Paul 
Tagliabue, invited me to go to the 
Italian American Dinner here in Wash-
ington. They were bursting with pride

for the Italian-American heritage at 
that dinner: cheers for Scalia, the Jus-
tice, and for Pelosi, the Congressman, 
and for Stallone, the actor, and for 
Tagliabue, 
the 
National 
Football 
League Commissioner. But what struck 
me was, as proud as they all were of 
their Italian heritage, they were most 
proud to say: We are all Americans. 
Ken Burns, whose films tell the story 
of who we are, reminds us that the late 
Arthur Schlesinger once wrote that our 
country needs less ‘‘pluribus’’ and more 
‘‘unum,’’ and the fact that we have at-
tracted people from everywhere in the 
world has made our country richer and 
stronger, but it is more important and 
a greater achievement that we have 
combined all of that diversity into one 
country. That is why the motto above 
the Presiding Officer’s desk is not one 
word—‘‘pluribus.’’ It is ‘‘e pluribus 
unum’’—out of many, one. 
More than ever, our country needs a 
United States to turn ‘‘pluribus’’ into 
‘‘unum,’’ to lead the American struggle 
to forge unity from diversity. 
Now, some advocate operating the 
Senate in a different way: End the fili-
buster—the Senate’s best-known tradi-
tion. In the movie ‘‘Mr. SMITH Goes to 
Washington,’’ he calls it ‘‘the right to 
talk your head off.’’ They say: Don’t 
worry about party lines. Pass every-
thing with a majority vote. 
Presidents would like that. They 
have said so. They would get their way 
more easily if we allow the passions to 
roar through the Senate like they roar 
through the House of Representatives. 
So if the Democrats are in charge, we 
could abolish every right-to-work law, 
repeal all limits on abortion, and pass 
restrictions on guns. That is very ap-
pealing for the moment, but what 
about if the train roars in the other di-
rection and Republicans say: Let’s im-
pose a right-to-work law on every 
State and pro-life laws and gun rights 
laws. 
Is such back and forth and back and 
forth what we really want as a coun-
try? The Framers didn’t think so. They 
created this cooling saucer for those 
passions 
that 
Washington 
talked 
about, and the filibuster—‘‘the right to 
talk your head off’’—is the preeminent 
tool we use to force broad agreements 
on tough issues that most of us will 
vote for and that the country could 
live with. 
Alexis de Tocqueville, the remark-
able young Frenchman who wandered 
through our country in 1831 and 1832 
and who wrote the best book yet on de-
mocracy in America, saw two great 
dangers for our future: One, Russia; 
and, two, the tyranny of the majority. 
Ending the filibuster will destroy the 
impetus for forcing the broad agree-
ments I have been talking about, and it 
would unleash the tyranny of the ma-
jority to steamroll the rights of the 
minority. 
Well, you may say that the Senate 
isn’t solving some big problems, and 
you would be right. We are not even 
voting on some big problems. Some-
times 
it 
is 
because 
the 
majority 
doesn’t bring it up, and sometimes the 
minority obstructs. If a carbon tax is a 
good idea, why aren’t we voting on it? 
Or if we want to help the DACA kids, 
why aren’t we voting on it? Or if the 
Federal debt is out of control, why 
aren’t we voting on it? 
It doesn’t take a genius. It doesn’t 
take a genius to figure out how to gum 
up the works in a body of 100 that oper-
ates mostly by unanimous consent. But 
here is my different view of why we are 
here. It is hard to get here. It is hard to 
stay here. And while we are here, we 
might as well try to accomplish some-
thing good for the country. But it is 
hard to accomplish something if you 
don’t vote on amendments. 
Lately, the Senate has been like join-
ing the Grand Ole Opry and not being 
allowed to sing. It is a real waste of 
talent. Think about this body. Over the 
years, we have had astronauts, former 
Governors, Supreme Court law clerks, 
military heroes, turnaround CEOs. We 
even had one of us who ran the Olym-
pics. A group of that much talent 
ought to accomplish a lot more, and 
you don’t have to eliminate the fili-
buster to accomplish a lot more— 
meaning, restore the Senate to a time 
when it was working across party lines 
more often to solve big problems. 
Not so long ago, the Senate worked 
Monday through Friday, considered 
hundreds of amendments. Most votes 
were by majority, and conferences 
worked out broad agreements. That 
was under the existing rules. Let me 
say that again. That was under the ex-
isting rules. So the Senate doesn’t need 
a change of rules. It needs a change of 
behavior, and the behavior to change 
first is to stop blocking each other’s 
amendments. If you are against it, vote 
no. Why stop the entire body from even 
considering it? Why join the Grand Ole 
Opry if you don’t want to sing? I guar-
antee you that if 15 to 20 Democrats 
and 15 to 20 Republicans decided they 
wanted to change that practice, they 
could do it. 
Some Governors don’t like being a 
U.S. Senator, but not me. The jobs are 
different. Both jobs cause you to want 
to see an urgent need, develop a strat-
egy to deal with it, and then try to per-
suade at least half of the people that 
you are right. But the Governor’s job is 
more like Moses. You say: Let’s go this 
way. The Senator’s job, if you want to 
get something done, is more like a pa-
rade organizer. You pick the route, you 
recruit the marchers, you select the 
music, you even pick the drum majors 
sometimes, and then you march in the 
middle of the parade and hope it 
doesn’t run off the road more than a 
half dozen times on the way to where it 
is going. 
I love the traditions of the Senate, 
the hard marble floors, the elaborate 
courtesies, Barry Black’s prayers, and 
scratching my name beside Howard 
Baker’s and Fred Thompson’s names in 
this desk drawer. 
I have made a lot of friendships in 
the Senate. My best friendship began 
at a softball game between Senator 
John G. Tower’s staff of Texas and Sen-
ator Baker’s staff, in the summer of 
1967, when a 21-year-old Smith College 
graduate named Honey slid into first 
base wearing red shorts. 
I was not only surprised but cap-
tivated, and 18 months later we were 
married. And for 52 years she has been 
an unselfish and caring wife, mother, 
campaigner, and advocate for families 
and children, especially her own. 
In 1969, as the leader mentioned, Sen-
ator Baker said to me: You ought to 
get to know that smart, young legisla-
tive assistant for the new Kentucky 
Senator, Marlow Cook. That smart, 
young legislative assistant was MITCH 
MCCONNELL, and it began a half cen-
tury of friendship. 
Mario D’Angelo, in the barbershop 
here, first cut my hair in 1977 when I 
came up for 3 months to work with 
Senator Baker when he was suddenly 
elected Republican leader. 
Some of my experiences in the Sen-
ate haven’t been so friendly, such as 
my confirmation hearing in 1991, when 
Senator Metzenbaum of Ohio said: Gov-
ernor Alexander, I have heard some 
very disturbing things about you, but I 
don’t think I’ll bring them up here. 
And he then put a hold on my nomina-
tion for 2 months, until I was mysteri-
ously confirmed late one night—and I 
still don’t know how. 
Back then I found a new way to make 
friends among Senators when I went to 
the Republican retreat, and they said: 
If you will stop talking and play the 
piano, we will support Bush’s education 
program. So I did, and they did. 
I have strengthened friendships in 
the so-called ‘‘inner sanctum’’ that 
CHUCK
SCHUMER
and 
I 
resurrected 
downstairs. It provides a private space 
for Senators to have a snack and a con-
versation. 
One-third of this body, of the Sen-
ators and their spouses, have come to 
the Smoky Mountains to be guests of 
Honey and me in our home for the 
weekend. We don’t talk about politics 
much there. We talked about lost 
hikers and told bear stories. 
And I have even learned here how to 
count—how to count my friends. In 2006 
I wrote 27 thank-you notes for 24 votes 
when I lost the race by 1 vote to be the 
Republican whip. Having learned to 
count, I got to be the Republican con-
ference chairman. I enjoyed that, but 9 
years ago I left to focus on issues that 
I cared the most about. Since then I 
have done my best to leave footprints 
that I hope are good for the country: 
fixing No Child Left Behind and 21st 
Century Cures and simplifying FAFSA, 
working with PATTY MURRAY—MICHAEL 
BENNET was there at the start for the 
FAFSA; working with DIANNE
FEIN-
STEIN in building up our National Lab-
oratories and supercomputing; joining 
the bipartisan parade of Portland and 
WARNER and GARDNER and KING and 
MANCHIN and DAINES and HEINRICH and 
BURR and CANTWELL that created the 
Great American Outdoors Act; the law

to help songwriters; working with 
MURRAY and JONES and TIM SCOTT on 
permanently funding Black colleges; 
with BLUNT and SHELBY on the shark 
tank of the National Institutes of 
Health, creating new diagnostic tests, 
new ways; with BURR and DURBIN and 
MANCHIN and KING on the student loan 
law I mentioned; with CASEY and ENZI 
on the Perkins Act; with Harry Reid 
and Bill Frist, when they were leaders, 
on the America COMPETES Act. 
None of this could have been done 
without an exceptional staff. But in-
stead of thanking them in a rushed 
way now, I am going to make a sepa-
rate ‘‘salute to the staff’’ speech to-
morrow. Maybe I will start a tradition. 
My favorite time in the U.S. Senate 
has been with the American history 
teachers whom I invite to come to the 
Senate floor before it opens while they 
are attending the academies that were 
created by the legislation I introduced 
in my maiden address 18 years ago. 
After that address, Ted Kennedy, 
without my knowing it, went around 
and got 20 Democratic cosponsors. In 
the House, ROGER WICKER and MARSHA 
BLACKBURN helped pass the bill there, 
where they were then. 
The teachers who come to the floor 
before we open invariably go to our 
desks. They try to find Daniel Web-
ster’s desk. They look for the Kennedy 
brothers’ desk. They ask, ‘‘Where is 
Jefferson 
Davis’s 
desk?’’—Jefferson 
Davis, who resigned the Senate to be-
come President of the Confederacy—be-
cause they have heard the story that 
there is a chop mark on the desk that 
was imposed by a Union soldier when 
they captured Washington. The soldier 
was chopping the desk until his com-
mander said: Stop that. We are here to 
save the Union, not to destroy it. 
Invariably a teacher will ask: Sen-
ator, what would you like for us to 
take back to our students about being 
a U.S. Senator? 
My reply is always the same: Please 
suggest to your students that they 
look at Washington, DC, as if it were a 
split-screen television. On one side are 
the confirmation hearings and the 
tweets, and on the other side you have 
Democratic and Republican Senators 
working together to strengthen na-
tional defense, National Laboratories, 
national parks, and the National Insti-
tutes of Health. 
Please remind them of what a re-
markable country this is: the strongest 
military, the best universities, pro-
ducing 20 percent of all the money in 
the world for just 4 percent of the peo-
ple. Tell them we are not perfect, but, 
as our Constitution says, we are always 
working to form a more perfect union 
and that, as Samuel Huntington wrote, 
most of our arguments are about con-
flicts among principles with which 
most of us agree, and most of our poli-
tics is about disappointments in not 
being able to reach the noble goals we 
set for ourselves, such as all men are 
created equal. 
The 
late 
NAACP 
President 
Ben 
Hooks used to teach his University of 
Memphis students, ‘‘America is a work 
in progress. We’ve come a long way, 
and we have a long way to go.’’ 
Please remind your students that the 
rest of the world wishes they had our 
system of government and that the 
U.S. Senate has been and I hope con-
tinues to be the single most important 
institution that helps to unify our 
country by creating broad agreements 
that most of us can vote for and that 
the citizens of the United States will 
accept. 
Finally, please tell them that I wake 
up every day thinking I might be able 
to do something good to help our coun-
try and that I go to bed most nights 
thinking that I have. Please tell them 
that it is a great privilege to be a U.S. 
Senator. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
TRIBUTE TO LAMAR ALEXANDER 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, it 
is such an honor to be here and to join 
my colleagues in paying tribute to Sen-
ator ALEXANDER today. As you can see, 
there are many who want to speak and 
have a few words to say. 
Now, I think all of us wish that we 
could do this to a background of music 
with LAMAR playing the piano. That 
would definitely be the proper setting. 
But I am so pleased to stand and to 
honor the three terms of service that 
he has had here in this body and the 
way he has touched the lives not only 
of individuals in this body but millions 
of Tennesseans. 
We know that he has—and he has 
talked about it in his remarks—worked 
with educators; he has worked with 
innovators; he has worked with the 
healthcare community; and he has 
worked, yes, with entertainers, many 
of whom hold him so dear and who call 
Tennessee home. In fact, when I was 
serving in the House and representing 
Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, 
so many times I would look over here 
and I would think ‘‘What is LAMAR not 
working on today?’’ because he always 
had such a broad portfolio of issues 
that were demanding his attention. 
And what we know is he accepted that 
work to address that broad portfolio of 
issues. 
His commitment for caring for the 
needs of all Tennesseans has really 
manifested itself in what Tennesseans 
like to see as a lifelong legacy that has 
really changed lives. As Governor, he 
worked to streamline our State’s gov-
ernment, was very successful in those 
efforts, and he brought that desire to 
streamline government with him when 
he came to the Senate. Indeed, this is 
work that has benefited all Ten-
nesseans and all Americans. 
As Governor of Tennessee, he was 
very successful in working to persuade 
Nissan automotive to come into our 
State. This started a new impact on 
our State with the auto industry. 
Then, as the auto industry needed sup-
pliers, he turned his attention to infra-
structure to make certain that the 
roads, the highways, the access that 
were necessary were there to encourage 
this business. 
As the former Secretary of Education 
under President George H. W. Bush, he 
couldn’t not put his personal touch on 
education policy, working tirelessly, as 
he said, to fix No Child Left Behind. 
This earned him the first-ever James 
Madison Award. 
He has a reputation for, indeed, being 
a go-to lawmaker, and as chairman of 
HELP here in the Senate, he put a 
spotlight on the issues that affect the 
most sensitive aspects of Tennesseans’ 
lives, again benefiting all Americans. 
I like the fact that he talked about 
bipartisanship and productivity. Be-
tween 2015 and 2019, during his term of 
service at HELP, he has reported 45 
bills out of his committee that have be-
come law—45 bills. As he mentioned, 
one of those was 21st Century Cures. As 
a Member in the House and working on 
originating this bill, we had said: We 
are going to make this bipartisan. And, 
indeed, we did, and we moved it from 
the House to the Senate. And yes, in-
deed, there were some days we thought: 
This is never going to happen. But, in-
deed, Senator ALEXANDER insisted, and, 
yes, it did happen. 
He mentioned the Music Moderniza-
tion Act, and I will tell you, this is vi-
tally important to Tennesseans. As we 
worked this through the House and 
then it hit some bumps in the road, 
Senator ALEXANDER and Senator Hatch 
did such a great job of pushing this for-
ward here in the Senate. 
Then, last September, the Nashville 
Songwriters Association International 
awarded him the White Hat Award, 
which is what they give to legislators 
who have made a significant impact on 
the entertainment and music commu-
nity. 
Well, the highlight reel would be too 
long to cover in one speech. There are 
many who are waiting to express their 
thanks. 
So, with that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). The Senator from California is 
recognized. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor Senator LAMAR 
ALEXANDER, a friend and a colleague 
who has served in this body for some 18 
years now. I have had the pleasure of 
serving with this Senator on both the 
Rules Committee and the Appropria-
tions Committee, and we sat next to 
each other as chairman or ranking 
member on two Appropriations sub-
committees—first Interior and then 
Energy and Water. We have done that 
since 2009. It has been through these 
experiences that I truly have come to 
appreciate Senator ALEXANDER’s fair-
ness, his interest in solving problems, 
and his bipartisanship. 
Most of all, I so appreciate your 
friendship and the time we have had to 
talk together. 
I do believe that the Senate is going 
to be diminished by the absence of this 
Senator.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7149 
December 2, 2020 
Working closely as chair and ranking 
member of the Energy and Water De-
velopment Subcommittee, we have al-
ways been able to find agreement on 
the annual appropriations bill. That is 
because we shared a willingness to find 
common ground. And that is no small 
thing. We have consistently held com-
prehensive subcommittee hearings on a 
wide range of issues, from nuclear 
power and nuclear waste to dam safety, 
to devastating droughts in the West 
and the future of renewable energy. 
We were also often among the first, if 
not the first subcommittee to nego-
tiate our bill, draft it, and get it 
marked up by the full committee, and 
that includes 4 years of record-level 
funding for clean energy, the National 
Laboratories, 
supercomputing, 
and 
water projects. The focus has always 
been on a fair, open process that seeks 
compromise. And that track record 
speaks to the value we place on the 
process. 
But more than anything, Senator 
ALEXANDER
will be remembered as 
someone who dedicated his life to serv-
ing the people of Tennessee. Between 
his 8 years as Governor and 16 years as 
a Senator, he served longer than any 
Tennessean who has held both jobs. 
That doesn’t include the 2 years he 
served as President George H.W. Bush’s 
Secretary of Education. 
His priorities have always been of 
great importance to Tennessee, wheth-
er Army Corps of Engineers funding for 
inland waters, particularly his favor-
ite, Chickamauga—this is the first 
time I ever heard the word pro-
nounced—Chickamauga Lock, which he 
often talks about in our hearings, or 
updating the way musicians are paid 
for their work. 
He also led efforts to pass the Every 
Student Succeeds Act in 2015, which 
President Obama called a ‘‘Christmas 
miracle.’’ 
As we hear promising news about 
coronavirus vaccines, we are reminded 
of the 21st Century Cures Act. That is 
Senator ALEXANDER’s landmark 2016 
bill that streamlined the drug and de-
vice approval process to bring treat-
ments to market faster. He has a long 
record of work he can be proud of. 
LAMAR, you have been a great col-
league and a dear friend all these years 
in the Senate. I am proud of what we 
have achieved together. I will miss our 
dinners together and sitting next to 
you on the dais. I hope you enjoy a 
well-earned retirement with Honey and 
your beautiful family. Thank you so 
much for your service. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I first 
met LAMAR ALEXANDER when he was a 
candidate for President 25 years ago. 
He was campaigning in the State of 
Maine, and after giving an articulate 
speech outlining his priorities and his 
policies, he proceeded to charm every-
one by playing the piano. Little did I 
know then that we would one day serve 
as colleagues and friends in the U.S. 
Senate. 
LAMAR, as you heard already today, 
is an extraordinary legislator. He has 
the ability to bring people together 
even on very contentious issues and 
hammer out a compromise. He is ex-
tremely effective because he is always 
well informed, focuses on the issue at 
hand, never gives up, and is willing to 
work across the aisle. He gets things 
done that matter not only to his con-
stituents and his beloved Tennessee 
but also to citizens across this great 
country. 
He has been an extraordinary leader 
on important issues that many of us 
care deeply about, such as biomedical 
research, education, and combating the 
opioid crisis. He is that rare individual 
who is far less interested in who gets 
the credit than in getting the job done. 
But, in fact, each of us who has had the 
privilege of working with LAMAR knows 
that he is the one who deserves the 
credit. 
I have served for years with LAMAR 
on the Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions Committee, which he chairs. 
On one challenging issue after another, 
when others would throw up their 
hands and say ‘‘This is impossible; it 
simply cannot be done,’’ LAMAR never 
gives up the search for a solution and 
for common ground. 
LAMAR has been so prolific as a legis-
lator that it is difficult to single out 
one accomplishment among so many, 
but if forced to do so, I would say that 
the 21st Century Cures Act is his signa-
ture achievement. As the name im-
plies, this law is a lasting legacy for 
him, and it is already providing lasting 
benefits for our country. Whether it is 
the BRAIN Initiative that will finally 
help us to make progress on diseases 
like 
Alzheimer’s, 
Parkinson’s, 
and 
other neurological illnesses, or the 
Cancer Moonshot that was done in 
honor of Beau Biden, or the funding 
that was included to look at the im-
pact of lifestyles on our health, all of 
the provisions of this landmark law 
will improve the health of the Amer-
ican people far into the future, and it 
will be LAMAR
ALEXANDER
who de-
serves the credit. 
As a close second, I would cite the 
educational reforms he drafted to re-
place and improve No Child Left Be-
hind to give more autonomy back to 
the States and local school districts. 
That 
law—Every 
Student 
Succeeds 
Act—was 
a 
momentous 
bipartisan 
achievement, and LAMAR has already 
explained what it took to get the job 
done. It is not surprising that in 2016, 
the Nation’s Governors named LAMAR 
the first recipient of the James Madi-
son Award to recognize Members of 
Congress who support Federalism. As 
we have heard today, the Wall Street 
Journal called ESSA the ‘‘largest devo-
lution of federal control to the states 
in a quarter-century.’’ 
In addition to being a skillful legis-
lator, LAMAR is also a wonderfully tal-
ented musician, as both a pianist and a 
singer. His hilarious performance at 
the annual Alfalfa Club dinner back in 
2011 
is 
legendary, 
and 
thanks 
to 
YouTube, it is also immortal. 
LAMAR was a great friend, as he men-
tioned today, of the writer Alex Haley, 
the author of ‘‘Roots.’’ Mr. Haley’s per-
sonal motto was ‘‘Find the good and 
praise it.’’ LAMAR quotes that often, 
and he lives by it. Optimism and grati-
tude, effectiveness and skill are his de-
fining characteristics. To LAMAR, ‘‘the 
good’’ isn’t simply what is pleasant; it 
is what is worthwhile, what makes us 
better people, better citizens, a better 
nation. If we follow the advice he gave 
us today, we will be a better Senate. 
Not long ago, I was interviewed by a 
journalist 
for 
a 
retrospective 
on 
LAMAR’s service in the Senate. She said 
that she happened to be in the Senate 
Dining Room on December 17, 2018—the 
day that LAMAR announced his inten-
tion to retire—and that a room usually 
alive with chatter was unusually quiet 
and tinged with sadness. That somber 
atmosphere was genuine and bipar-
tisan. 
LAMAR, I can’t tell you how much 
personally I will miss serving with you. 
You are not only a great Senator and 
extraordinary legislator but a wonder-
ful friend. Thank you so much for your 
many years of public service. I feel 
very honored to have served with you, 
to have learned from you, and I wish 
you and Honey all the best. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, his 
name was the answer to a frequently 
asked question. It is a question that 
used to come up in almost every Demo-
cratic meeting when we talked about 
legislative ideas and we talked about 
making progress on the floor of the 
Senate. And the question was this: Who 
can we call on the other side of the 
aisle? And the answer was almost al-
ways LAMAR ALEXANDER. We knew that 
if we presented an idea to him, he 
would not only be receptive and re-
spectful, we knew that if he came on 
board, it would lend credibility to our 
effort, maybe even get a bill passed 
around here. But it would always have 
to wear a red tartan badge with it be-
cause there was an idea that he wanted 
to bring to the party, but it was worth 
it. It was worth it not only for the 
progress that you can make in terms of 
legislation, but it was worth it because 
it was part of developing a friendship. 
Harry Truman used to recommend fa-
mously, ‘‘If you want a friend in Wash-
ington, get a dog.’’ I thought of that. I 
told you about it a few months ago 
when you were on one of those Sunday 
morning talk shows. You were broad-
casting, I think, from your living room 
or family room at your home in Ten-
nessee, and I couldn’t get over that 
stuffed animal that was on the coffee 
table behind you. It just seemed like it 
was such an odd little piece of maybe 
personal pride to have that stuffed ani-
mal with you. It turned out it wasn’t 
stuffed at all. It was Rufus, your dog, 
who slept through your entire perform-
ance, wasn’t a bit moved by the fact

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7150 
December 2, 2020 
that you were on some Sunday morn-
ing talk show. 
I want to thank you for many things, 
and I will mention a few of them in 
terms of legislation, but I especially 
want to thank you for—I brought a 
group of friends of mine down to Nash-
ville, TN, and you made a recommenda-
tion list of places to stop, including the 
Bluebird, and then came by and joined 
us for lunch. You couldn’t have been 
more gracious, and I thank you for 
that. 
That is a trademark of LAMAR ALEX-
ANDER’s life and service to this coun-
try. 
I could talk about many things, but I 
want to reflect on one that I think is 
timely and significant and is a reason a 
lot of us are wearing these masks. We 
are facing a pandemic with the COVID– 
19 virus. It has claimed 273,000 Amer-
ican lives, and I am afraid many more 
will follow. Millions—almost 13 million 
or more—have been infected by it. We 
want it to end, and we want it to end 
as quickly as possible. 
The really shining ray of hope here is 
the possibility that a vaccine will be 
available soon. I pray it will be. I like 
to think that some of the things that 
we did together, with others, created 
an opportunity for that vaccine to be 
discovered. 
It was 5 or 6 years ago that I ap-
proached you and I approached Senator 
PATTY MURRAY and ROY BLUNT with 
the idea that we ought to make a con-
certed, consistent effort to increase the 
NIH’s budget by at least 5 percent per 
year. 
Senator BLUNT, whom I see on the 
floor here today, I want to thank you. 
You took that cause to heart, along 
with Senator ALEXANDER. 
We had the right appropriator and 
the right authorizer, and PATTY MUR-
RAY served in both capacities so effec-
tively. 
We dramatically increased the NIH 
budget over the last 7, 8 years. I am 
hopeful, and I would like to think that 
some of those researchers and the work 
that they did was laying the ground-
work for the discovery of these vac-
cines quickly in the United States and 
around the world. That is a legacy you 
won’t soon forget. 
Do you remember when we first got 
wind of this COVID–19 and I walked 
across the Chamber here and I said to 
you: I am worried about this protective 
equipment issue and how much we are 
reliant on going overseas for sourcing; 
would you join me at least in an effort 
to find out whether we are dependent 
on foreign sources at a time when we 
might desperately need this protective 
equipment for our own? 
You said, sure, and we did it together 
and the investigation is underway. It 
may not serve us in this particular cri-
sis, but it will serve in many genera-
tions to come to make sure we have re-
liable domestic sources in the United 
States. 
I am not going to catalog all of the 
items that were mentioned earlier by 
our colleagues Senator BLACKBURN and 
Senator COLLINS
and Senator FEIN-
STEIN—the list goes on and on—but 
that increase by 38 percent of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health was some-
thing our little quartet did together, 
and I am particularly proud to be part 
of it. 
It wasn’t, by far, the only thing that 
you have done. You championed an in-
crease in the Department of Energy’s 
Office of Science as chair of the Energy 
and Water Appropriations Committee, 
which Senator FEINSTEIN noted. Under 
your leadership with her, that office 
budget has increased by 38 percent 
since 2015. 
You worked with the National Labs, 
like Oak Ridge, Argonne, Fermilab. 
Those are near and dear to me as well. 
And your support for research infra-
structure provided essential help to 
this Lab and Labs across America. 
I want to just close by saying this. 
Most of us were moved by your speech. 
I am sure it was a perfect illustration 
of your view of this Chamber and the 
good memories you have and a chal-
lenge to all of us to do better. I think 
the honest answer is it is not the rules 
of the Senate that make the difference; 
it is the Senators who make a dif-
ference. If we come to the chore of leg-
islating with the inspiration of LAMAR 
ALEXANDER, we are going to get a lot 
done for America. 
Thank you for your great service to 
our country. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the Sen-
ate is going to miss LAMAR ALEXANDER. 
Listening to his farewell address 
right now made the fact that he is 
leaving all too real. I don’t like to 
think of a U.S. Senate without LAMAR. 
He is a Senate institution and a Senate 
leader, and his leaving is a loss for this 
body and for the American people. 
Any tribute to LAMAR has to mention 
his incredible career, which a lot has 
been alluded to already: his walk 
across the State of Tennessee, his 8 
years as Tennessee Governor, his time 
as Secretary of Education under Presi-
dent George H.W. Bush, his stint as 
president of the University of Ten-
nessee system, and his time as a pro-
fessor at Harvard. 
Then, of course, are his 18 years in 
the U.S. Senate, marked by significant 
legislative accomplishments on every-
thing from education to opioids. 
All that, and he makes a plaid shirt 
look good, although these days he has 
switched to a plaid face mask. 
I first met LAMAR, like our colleague 
from Maine, Senator COLLINS, men-
tioned, when he attended a Lincoln 
Day Dinner in South Dakota in 1995, 
when he was running for President. I 
really started to get to know him a lit-
tle bit when I came to the Senate in 
2005. 
LAMAR had already been here for a 
couple of years by that time. Of course, 
he already had an extraordinary career 
behind him. I know I was not the only 
young Senator who regarded him as 
something of a mentor and a role 
model. 
I share a couple of things with 
LAMAR; one is the fact that we were 
both Senate staffers long before we 
came to the Senate as elected officials. 
We weren’t here at the same time. He 
was a little ahead of me. I came to the 
Senate the year Howard Baker left, 
but, like LAMAR, I have great apprecia-
tion for the contributions staffers 
make to the work that we do around 
here. I know many of LAMAR’s staffers 
are in the Gallery today. As he leaves, 
also we lose a tremendous amount of 
brain power and talent that has con-
tributed so significantly to the suc-
cesses and accomplishments that he 
has had as a U.S. Senator. 
The other is that he and I both have 
served as chairman of the Senate Re-
publican conference, which is the mes-
saging and communications office for 
Republicans in the Senate. I succeeded 
LAMAR as chairman of the Senate Re-
publican conference in 2012. I will tell 
you, he is a very tough act to follow 
but an inspiring one because he did 
such a tremendous job in leading our 
messaging in the conference. 
LAMAR has an ability to break down 
complex subjects and communicate 
them clearly. He can sum up an issue 
in one succinct phrase. He mentioned 
earlier, in his remarks, the idea that 
there ought to be one column, one idea; 
one speech, one idea. He really did mas-
ter that. 
I can recall his summary when we 
were talking a lot about the energy 
issue: We need to ‘‘find more and use 
less.’’ That is about as clear a sum-
mary of our energy priorities as you 
can get. 
Many of us used a phrase he popular-
ized around here, too, in describing 
policies of the other side that we 
thought would be harmful to the econ-
omy as casting a big wet blanket over 
the economy. I don’t know how many 
times you heard that coming out of our 
mouths, but it all originated with 
LAMAR ALEXANDER. 
I think that ability to really break 
down complex issues and clearly ex-
plain them is one of the reasons he was 
such a good conference chairman and 
one of the reasons he has been so suc-
cessful legislatively. 
And he has been successful legisla-
tively. You already heard a number of 
my colleagues talk about his many 
successes. Yet he has managed to get 
things passed around here that I don’t 
think anyone thought could get passed, 
particularly in the polarized political 
environment that we have been in. 
But LAMAR has an ability to bring 
people together from across the aisle. 
You heard our colleagues on both sides 
speak to that. He is very practical 
about the business of legislating. He fo-
cuses on what is actually possible to do 
and he finds the common ground and 
he gets things done. 
You have heard of the America COM-
PETES Act, the Every Student Suc-
ceeds Act, the 21st Centuries Cures

Act, the Opioids Crisis Response Act, 
the Copyright Act, the Great American 
Outdoors Act. I could go on and on. 
Those, 
ladies 
and 
gentlemen, 
are 
major, major pieces of legislation, tre-
mendous accomplishments of the Con-
gress by the U.S. Senate, signed into 
law by the President, all of which 
couldn’t have happened without the 
leadership of LAMAR ALEXANDER. 
He has held multiple leadership posi-
tions in the Senate: chairman of the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee and, as I said, Senate 
Republican conference chairman, but 
he has always been a leader, whether or 
not in an official leadership position or 
simply by virtue of who he is. 
As I said before, LAMAR has been a 
mentor and role model to me and I 
know to many others here in the Sen-
ate. 
But I also have to mention his per-
sonal warmth and hospitality to me 
and my wife when our daughter was 
studying at Belmont University in 
Nashville, TN. He and his wife Honey 
opened their home to us in Nashville. 
They hosted us. I am fortunate to be 
among those he mentioned were at 
their place in the Smokies, which was 
a fabulous experience. They took us to 
a Tennessee Titans game. They went 
above and beyond. And to this day, we 
are grateful for their warmth and gen-
erosity and for a chance to see LAMAR 
in his element in his beloved Ten-
nessee. 
LAMAR has dedicated much of his life 
to his State, his country, and nobody 
could be more deserving of retirement. 
I will be surprised if he ever fully re-
tires. I am pretty sure, even while sit-
ting on his porch, he is still going to be 
dreaming up ways to make our country 
better. 
LAMAR, thank you for your leader-
ship and for your mentorship. Thank 
you for being a role model to so many 
of us. May God bless you in your retire-
ment. I will miss you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I was 
not planning on speaking today, but I 
was so inspired by what Senator ALEX-
ANDER had to say about his career and 
about the Senate that I wanted to 
share a word or two of reflection on 
what he said. 
Anybody who has spent any time 
around 
Washington, 
DC, 
or 
even 
around this Capitol knows there are 
statues built all over this town of peo-
ple nobody remembers. When I go by 
one of those statues in Washington— 
whether it is in a circle somewhere in 
a traffic stop or in the hallway in the 
Capitol—I think about the importance 
of dying at the right time. You want to 
die at a moment when statues are in 
vogue if you are going to have a statue. 
But there is no—none of these people 
are ever going to be remembered in the 
long view of history. The stoic philoso-
phers on whom we base so much, or at 
least attempt to base so much of what 
we do here, had a solution to that. 
Their solution was—whether it was the 
Greek or Roman philosophers—their 
solution was: Do your best. Show up 
and make a contribution. Do your best. 
Don’t worry about how people are 
going to remember you. Don’t worry 
about your own mortality. 
So few of us follow that advice. I 
think 
LAMAR
ALEXANDER
embodies 
that. As President of the University of 
Tennessee, as Governor, as the Sec-
retary of Education, as a Senator, in 
every one of those jobs, it has always 
been about doing his best. 
In a Chamber filled with people who 
think they have a monopoly on wis-
dom, LAMAR has never stopped learn-
ing. He has always been curious. Up to 
this day—I will bet today, he probably 
got up and asked somebody on his staff 
or one of his colleagues to tell him 
about something he wants to learn 
more about so he can be more effective 
and make a greater difference so he can 
do his best. 
The Senate is going to be diminished 
by LAMAR’s absence. It is hard to be-
lieve we can be any more diminished 
than we are, but we are going to be di-
minished by LAMAR leaving. 
Susan and I were lucky enough to be 
invited to his home, spend a weekend 
there. I am going to say something now 
I never said to LAMAR ALEXANDER. He 
gave us the great privilege of standing 
in the family cemetery in Eastern Ten-
nessee, in his beloved Smoky Moun-
tains, where he will forever keep the 
windmills out. As I stood there a little 
awkwardly in the cemetery—because 
that is not usually part of a tour—all I 
could think about was how lucky 
LAMAR and Honey were to know that 
would be the place where they would be 
and that long after they were remem-
bered by anybody, they would know 
that they had done their best; that 
they had always done their best. 
What I would say to my colleagues 
today is, we have an opportunity to fol-
low LAMAR’s example and take him up 
on what he said. We are not memori-
alizing LAMAR today. He is going to 
have a lot more years left to contribute 
to his State, his community, and to the 
country, but he won’t be in the Senate, 
and we are in the Senate. 
We could work in the Senate that 
works 5 days a week or even 6 days a 
week. Sign me up for that Senate. We 
could work in a Senate that has 25 
amendments in a bill instead of 25 
amendments in a year, as we did last 
year, because there is no other body in 
America or in this democracy, as 
LAMAR said, that is set up to decide the 
hardest questions that our country is 
facing and to make those decisions 
stick. That is what LAMAR ALEXANDER 
said to us today. 
He has left us with a challenge, and I 
hope we will take him up on it because 
there is no excuse for the way this 
place has worked, and the American 
people are tired of hearing that it has 
been the other side’s fault. There are 
100 people who can fix this place, and I 
hope we will. I can’t think of a greater 
legacy for LAMAR to leave than that of 
a Senate that actually works. That is 
what the country deserves, and that is 
the inspiration that LAMAR ALEXANDER 
has set for me. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we all 
know that LAMAR ALEXANDER is a per-
son of tremendous character and judg-
ment, and it is not just because he 
asked that young woman in the red 
shorts that he met at that softball 
game so many years ago to marry him, 
who happens to be from Victoria, TX, 
which demonstrates his enormous good 
judgment. Certainly, we wish him and 
Honey the best in this next chapter of 
their lives. 
When I think about LAMAR ALEX-
ANDER, I think about all of the Lamar- 
isms, and we have heard some of them 
here today: ‘‘Find the good and praise 
it’’—quotes his friend Alex Haley, 
which I think kind of speaks to the op-
timistic, positive view of life that we 
could use more of. Then I remember 
other words. He said: If you want to get 
a standing ovation before any group of 
individuals, you need to say, ‘‘It is 
time to put the teaching of American 
history and civics back into its rightful 
place in our schools so our children can 
grow up learning what it means to be 
an American.’’ He has talked about 
Alex Haley, his friend, who told him 
how to give a speech by telling a story. 
Aristotle also had an idea about how 
to give a great speech. He basically 
broke it down to three components. 
One is the logical argument, another is 
the emotional argument, but then an-
other is about establishing your au-
thority. It is about the character of the 
speaker. When I think about LAMAR, as 
he has demonstrated again here today, 
the thing I appreciate about him the 
most is not just what he has accom-
plished here but his incredible char-
acter and positive impact on our Sen-
ate and on our country. It has been be-
cause people know that his heart is in 
the right place. It is his doing it for all 
the right reasons that we admire him 
so much. 
I would just point out, as I told 
LAMAR
previously, that I admired 
LAMAR ALEXANDER long before I met 
him—when I voted for him in the 1996 
Republican primary for President. Un-
fortunately, he dropped out of that 
race shortly thereafter, so I told him I 
wasted my vote, but I have been an ad-
mirer for a long time. 
(Laughter.) 
LAMAR and I also share something 
else in common. It is about his prede-
cessor as well as mine. He is a person 
by the name of Sam Houston. I occupy 
the Senate seat first held by Sam 
Houston when Texas became a State. 
Of course, he originally came from 
Tennessee. He had happened to be a 
Governor of Tennessee before he had 
left and gone to Texas. Later, he be-
came the Governor of Texas and basi-
cally stepped down because he was a

Union man, recruited by Andrew Jack-
son. He loved the Union. He did not 
agree with secession, but, of course, he 
went to Texas and became a victorious 
general of the decisive Battle of San 
Jacinto. He became the President of 
the Republic of Texas for the same rea-
son. The reason the Texas flag and the 
American flag fly at the same height is 
that we were an independent nation be-
fore we became part of the United 
States. I have heard it said that you 
could never write a novel based on the 
life of Sam Houston because nobody 
would believe it. I have read plenty 
about him, and I still find that to be 
true. 
Yet, as I indicated, as proud as Tex-
ans are of Sam Houston’s contribution 
to our history and our State, we know 
we can’t claim him entirely because he 
grew up in Maryville, TN—the same 
town that LAMAR ALEXANDER did—and 
went on to become Governor, as I men-
tioned a moment ago. 
Sam Houston’s portrait hangs above 
my desk in the Hart Office Building be-
cause it helps to remind me of my re-
sponsibilities and of the incredible his-
tory and contribution that he made 
and that, hopefully, each of us can 
make. 
While you find Sam Houston’s pic-
ture above my desk, you will find his 
walking stick in LAMAR ALEXANDER’s 
office, which is just down the hall. The 
many Tennesseans who have visited 
LAMAR during his time in the Chamber 
have seen the words ‘‘Sam Houston,’’ 
‘‘Texas,’’ and ‘‘Lone Star’’ engraved on 
its gold cap, and according to LAMAR, 
several Texans have tried to run off 
with it. Fortunately, they haven’t been 
successful. 
The truth is, you can’t get through a 
Texas history class—or at least you 
shouldn’t—without hearing about the 
pivotal role of the Volunteer State 
within the history of my State. I al-
ways kid LAMAR. I say: The Ten-
nesseans who went to Texas who fought 
at the Alamo and in the Battle of San 
Jacinto were just one step ahead of a 
creditor or of an aggrieved spouse. This 
was a rough-and-tumble group that 
came from Tennessee to found Texas. 
There are other Tennesseans, people 
like Davy Crockett and others, who 
went to Texas and created our State. 
The State of Texas has many reasons 
to be grateful to the contributions of 
the sons and daughters of Tennessee, 
and one of those great sons is LAMAR. 
He has dedicated his life to public serv-
ice. As we know, it has led him through 
an incredible number of important of-
fices. 
Yet I think, to me, the thing that has 
even more led to his legislative accom-
plishments and that has made LAMAR 
so effective is that we know we can 
trust him. We know his character. We 
know that when he says something, it 
is true, and we have seen it time and 
again, when LAMAR has used that char-
acter and that trust to pass historic 
legislation in this Chamber. As we have 
all come to know, when you are work-
ing side by side with LAMAR on legisla-
tion, you are bound to get things done 
because he has cracked the code. He 
knows how to do it. 
I have been proud to work with 
LAMAR on legislation to address the 
opioid epidemic, to support our service-
members and veterans, to protect 
health coverage, and to ensure that 
folks across the country have the op-
portunity to take advantage of the 
American dream. His presence has been 
constant throughout our time. We 
came to the Senate at the same time, 
and, of course, his retirement makes 
that all bittersweet. 
So I thank our colleague from Ten-
nessee for his friendship over many 
years and, as we have heard from Sen-
ator THUNE and others, for the example 
he has shown to the rest of us as to 
how to be an effective Member of the 
U.S. Senate. I also thank him for his 
decades of service to the country. I 
don’t expect LAMAR to follow in the 
footsteps of Sam Houston and run for 
Governor of Texas, but I know he has 
many more contributions to make to 
our great country, and I wish him and 
Honey all the best during this next 
chapter of their lives. I am sure he is 
looking forward to spending a little 
more time in their beloved Smoky 
Mountains. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have 
learned in my time in the Senate that 
if you want to get something done 
across the aisle, you really need the 
following: You need someone on the 
other side who is just as committed to 
working together as you are, and that 
Member needs to have the trust of 
Members on your side of the aisle and 
on his own, and you both need to be 
willing to set aside egos and listen and 
get a realistic understanding of wheth-
er the person on the other side of the 
negotiating table can reach an agree-
ment with you that upholds your prin-
ciples without compromising his own. 
Now, what I have laid out might not 
sound that unusual or rare, but it is ac-
tually pretty tough to find these days. 
I have been very lucky that the Sen-
ator whom we honor today on the 
floor—my colleague and friend, Chair-
man LAMAR ALEXANDER, of Tennessee— 
is someone who has managed it time 
and again. 
I don’t think anyone, least of all Sen-
ator ALEXANDER himself, would be sur-
prised to hear me say that we are as 
likely to disagree as to agree on many 
matters. I bring my Washington State 
values to the table, and he brings his 
Tennessee values, so you can imagine 
how that has gone from time to time. 
Yet, despite our different perspectives 
and our different approaches we take 
to policymaking, we have also been 
able to see where our values and the in-
terests of our States and our country 
converge. 
We both understood that the broken 
No Child Left Behind law needed to be 
fixed. LAMAR listened to me, which I so 
appreciated, when I told him we should 
write a bill together rather than to 
amend the Republican bill that he had 
begun working on. With our HELP 
Committee members, we were able to 
write and pass a new K–12 public edu-
cation bill that fixed the most broken 
parts of No Child Left Behind. It in-
cluded Federal guardrails so we could 
understand how all of our students per-
form. It dedicated resources to improv-
ing the schools that needed it the 
most. It also allowed for historic steps 
forward on early education. 
We laid the groundwork together for 
new investments in lifesaving bio-
medical 
innovation 
and 
research 
through the 21st Century Cures Act, in-
cluding the Beau Biden Cancer Moon-
shot. 
We worked together to pass land-
mark legislation to boost our response 
to the opioid epidemic, to strengthen 
our public health preparedness pro-
grams, and to permanently fund his-
torically Black colleges and univer-
sities and minority-serving institu-
tions. We not only passed each of these 
bills, but we did so time and again with 
huge majorities from this Senate. Now, 
even still, Chairman ALEXANDER and I, 
along with our colleagues in the House, 
are working to get legislation across 
the finish line to finally ban surprise 
medical bills. 
What I have just laid out is by no 
means a full list at all of Senator 
ALEXANDER’s 
accomplishments 
as 
chairman. It doesn’t even include quite 
a few things he is still trying to get 
done as we speak. Senator ALEX-
ANDER’s focus on working together has 
helped countless families in his home 
State of Tennessee, in my home State 
of Washington, and nationwide. 
My Democratic colleagues and I 
thank Chairman ALEXANDER
for the 
tone and manner with which he has led 
the HELP Committee over the past 6 
years—some 
of 
them, 
admittedly, 
rockier than others but, throughout, 
guided by his steady leadership and 
commitment to working together. 
For myself, as someone who shares 
the drive to not only fight for what you 
believe in but also to look for common 
ground, I thank my colleague from 
Tennessee for the many opportunities 
to dig in and get to work that he has 
provided, for being willing to hear me 
and my colleagues out again and again 
when necessary, and for looking so 
often for common ground, for another 
problem we could solve, and for being 
willing not just to keep talking but to 
keep listening as well. 
Finally, I know none of this would 
have been possible without the support 
and strength Senator ALEXANDER has 
received from Honey, his wife, and I ac-
knowledge and thank her for her con-
tribution as well. 
Lamar, you will be thrilled to be 
back full time in the State you love so 
much—I know that—but I and mem-
bers of the HELP Committee want you 
to know we are going to miss you ter-
ribly here in the Senate. Thank you so 
much for all you have done.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7153 
December 2, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
Senators 
CANTWELL, BLUNT, ROMNEY, SCHUMER, 
and I be able to complete our remarks 
before the next vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I don’t 
want to prolong this discussion except 
to make one additional point about the 
unselfishness and humility of this hero 
of the Senate, whose remarks we will 
long remember today. 
There is a framed piece of legislation 
that hangs on the wall in my con-
ference room in the Dirksen Building. 
It is, in fact, a piece of legislation that 
Senator ALEXANDER chose to mention 
as one of his signature accomplish-
ments, and that is the American His-
tory and Civics Education Act, which 
was signed into law by President 
George W. Bush. There is a story about 
how I came to have that piece of legis-
lation, 
which 
Senator 
ALEXANDER 
worked so hard on, on the wall in my 
conference room. 
I live in North Mississippi, and, as 
such, I listen to Memphis television a 
lot. During LAMAR ALEXANDER’s first 
race for Senator, on came a commer-
cial, and, basically, it said just what 
our friend from Texas just quoted— 
that this candidate for Senator, former 
Governor LAMAR ALEXANDER, wanted 
to pass an American civics education 
bill to teach our children what it 
means to be an American. I stopped at 
that moment, and I pointed to that tel-
evision screen, and I said: If that man 
gets elected, I want to be part of that 
bill because that is exactly what we 
need. 
So Senator ALEXANDER
introduced 
the bill here in the Senate. I intro-
duced it in the House of Representa-
tives. We made public appearances to-
gether, one in Memphis, TN, that I will 
always remember. Eventually, the bill 
gained a lot of support over here, and 
Senator KENNEDY, as has been men-
tioned, was someone at the forefront of 
that effort. 
We were able to pass it in the House. 
It went to conference to iron out the 
details, and a decision had to be made 
as to which one would actually be en-
acted by both Houses and go to the 
President for his signature. 
LAMAR ALEXANDER allowed the piece 
of legislation introduced by a rel-
atively junior Member of the House 
named ROGER WICKER to be that piece 
of legislation that went on to the 
White House, to the Oval Office, to be 
signed by the President of the United 
States. 
So that is how that piece of legisla-
tion hangs on my wall as a bill au-
thored 
by 
Representative 
ROGER 
WICKER but passed very much with the 
efforts of Senator ALEXANDER also. 
I just wanted to mention that, not to 
prolong this discussion but to mention 
that act of selflessness and humility as 
another attribute of this great Senator 
to whom we say farewell today. 
I think the remarks we heard from 
Senator ALEXANDER will be taught at 
civics classes and college-level govern-
ment classes for decades and decades to 
come. It was so profound, and it is a 
real honor that a piece of legislation 
that he and I worked on together will 
always be a part of what I consider to 
be those immortal remarks. 
So I thank you very much. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor, too, to thank the 
Senator from Tennessee for his service 
to our Nation and for his work here in 
the U.S. Senate. 
Some of my colleagues have already 
mentioned the brevity of words with 
which Senator ALEXANDER can deliver 
a message. I, too, remember his com-
ments as a Rules Committee member, 
on the inaugural address, and really 
capturing the moment of why a transi-
tion of power is so important to our 
Nation. And it struck me that we real-
ly had a poet or a writer among us, 
someone who could sense and feel the 
moment of what we were going through 
and express it in words. So I have no 
doubt that some writing is in LAMAR’s 
future here, and I look forward to see-
ing that. 
But I wanted to rise today to thank 
him for his service and what it has 
meant to my State and to our Nation. 
My colleague from Washington talked 
about their work together on the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee. I, too, want to thank 
you for the CARES Act, and I remem-
ber your recognition on FOX News 
about stem cell research and the great 
work that that has led to. 
So we are appreciative of those re-
search dollars, but I want to focus on a 
role that maybe has not gotten as 
much attention—the historic role you 
have played on our energy budget and 
our National Laboratory budget. 
I so appreciate the background of 
your State and the background of focus 
on energy funding, from the National 
Laboratory perspective, which has had 
to have a constant flow and constantly 
it has been challenged. Yet it has put 
every step forward because of the level 
of investment in helping us make our 
Nation more secure, create more inno-
vation, and create more jobs. So thank 
you for holding steadfast on the Na-
tional Laboratory budget. 
I also want to thank you for your 
work on the Manhattan Project Na-
tional 
Historical 
Park, 
which 
we 
worked together on, which, both, com-
memorated the history of our Nation 
and our Manhattan Project at, both, 
Oak Ridge and at Richland, WA, and 
Hanford, and to just thank you for the 
constant focus on the cleanup budget 
that we have had to have in the Energy 
Department, as it related to Hanford. 
There was a time when we had many 
cleanup projects around the Nation, 
and it was very easy to come together 
and say that we had to get Savannah 
River, we had to get Oak Ridge, we had 
to get Colorado, we had to get Idaho, 
and we had to get Hanford. But as 
those projects made progress, a lot of 
people forgot about what it took to 
clean up Hanford. So I appreciate your 
constant focus on helping us to get the 
dollars necessary for cleanup at Han-
ford. 
I also appreciate, recently, your help 
on making sure that people didn’t 
overstep on the National Nuclear Secu-
rity Administration and turn that over 
to a Defense oversight of people but 
kept it within the Department of En-
ergy. I so appreciate that. 
But I will be forever grateful for your 
focus on public lands. We have a saying 
in my State: Environmentalists make 
great ancestors. So I don’t know if you 
want that environmentalist term asso-
ciated with your name, but I am pretty 
sure you do want the stewardship. 
And the man from the Great Smoky 
Mountains helped us deliver a monu-
mental piece of legislation by con-
vincing the President of the United 
States to support the budgetary impact 
of combining both the national parks 
enhancement program, which is basi-
cally taking care of the national parks 
backlog, which was in the billions of 
dollars, and also fully funding the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund, a battle 
that had been going on for more than a 
decade. 
So I want to thank you for that, 
LAMAR. I want to thank you on behalf 
of the Washingtonians who will go to 
so many special places, who will get to 
visit and commune with their families, 
who will be able to have outdoor expe-
riences, who will be able to really un-
derstand the grandeur of Mother Earth. 
So thank you for pulling off what 
seemed to be like an impossible effort 
to convince people to make that level 
of investment. 
We are going to miss the harmony of 
your voice and the harmony of your 
legislative skills, but we are not going 
to say permanently good-bye to you be-
cause we hope that you will be sending 
us messages just like the one you sent 
today and reminding us that we can do 
better. 
So thank you, LAMAR, for your con-
tribution, in a lot of your life, to these 
very important issues that affect so 
many of us. Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I first 
met LAMAR ALEXANDER in 1995, when 
he spoke at Boston’s Lincoln Day Din-
ner. Like today, he was folksy, good 
humored, thoughtful, and impressive. 
I remarked to Ann that he was surely 
going to go places. Of course, he had al-
ready gone places by then, but he ran 
for President the next year. One thing 
LAMAR and I agree on is that the best 
candidate for President does not al-
ways win. I think he may well have 
been just that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7154 
December 2, 2020 
You all know that he served as presi-
dent of a university, Governor, Sen-
ator, and Secretary of Education. I 
have watched firsthand as he has led 
the Senate’s Committee on Health and 
Education. I don’t know any person 
who has worked longer, harder, and 
more effectively for the well-being of 
America’s children than LAMAR ALEX-
ANDER. 
His service extends, of course, beyond 
the children. As we have endured the 
COVID–19 pandemic, he has led the 
Senate as we have helped to guide and 
fund 
our 
national 
response. 
His 
healthcare expertise and his deter-
mination to keep each of us informed 
and involved has been invaluable. 
While America’s response to the pan-
demic may not have been exemplary, 
LAMAR ALEXANDER’s leadership of the 
Senate’s role has been superb. The 
speed at which we will have a vaccine 
is, in no small measure, a testament to 
his determination and vision. 
But LAMAR is much more than a Sen-
ator. I have seen the devotion he has 
for his wife and family. I have watched 
him entertain rooms full of celebrating 
Republicans with his piano and sing-
ing. And I have experienced very per-
sonally the kindness and graciousness 
that have long characterized this man. 
He was the first Senator to come to 
meet me when I joined this body. 
His impact on the Senate, on the 
State of Tennessee, and on the Nation 
extends well beyond his legislative ac-
complishments 
and 
leadership. 
His 
greatest impact has been that of his 
personal character. He is a man with-
out guile. He is true to his conscience. 
He speaks and acts with truth and hon-
esty. He cares about people and endeav-
ors to help others. He is a genuine 
friend, as is evidenced by the many 
members of his team wearing plaid 
masks around this room. 
He has used his talent and energy not 
to aggrandize himself but to serve. It 
could be said of LAMAR
ALEXANDER 
that he is a great American of exem-
plary character. We are a better people 
because of LAMAR ALEXANDER. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I think 
Mark Twain said, among many other 
things, that there is nothing more 
troubling than a great example. And, 
as we have had all of these speeches 
today, I felt less and less adequate as 
the speakers talked about the great 
things that LAMAR has done, the great 
things he stands for, the incredible 
character that defines his life and his 
work. It has been wonderful to be here 
and to see the appreciation that Sen-
ators have for somebody who is proud 
to be a Senator. 
Not that often do you get to start a 
last speech in the Senate referring to 
somebody else’s maiden speech over al-
most 50 years ago. But that kind of 
sense of the Senate, that sense of com-
munity, that split screen that LAMAR 
talked about with educators, where 
you do have the one screen where it ap-
pears that nobody can get along and 
get anything done—and, particularly in 
the Senate, you have this relatively 
small community of people, all of 
whom got here by figuring out, nor-
mally, how to get along with other peo-
ple, as one of their attributes of get-
ting to the Senate. And then you have 
rules in the Senate that require you to 
get along to get anything done. So you 
have that other screen that doesn’t get 
nearly the attention. But when you do 
look at the accomplishments, even at a 
time of great frustration, those accom-
plishments have been significant, and 
so many of them have included LAMAR. 
I knew LAMAR before I came to the 
Senate, but, particularly, the last 10 
years of working with LAMAR in the 
Senate have been great for me, and the 
time that Abby and I have been able to 
spend with him and Honey have been 
great. 
He says things in passing that really 
define the opportunity to be here in 
such a significant way. We have heard 
many of them today. There are others 
I think of often—one LAMAR told me 
not too long ago, when I was talking 
about how well our staffs work to-
gether. He said: Well, it always seemed 
to me that when the Senators obvi-
ously got along, the staff figures that 
out and they understand they are sup-
posed to get along too. 
LAMAR is blessed with a great staff. 
It will be interesting to see the new 
standard of having that other speech 
that so significantly talks about the 
staff and what the staff means. I have 
a great staff—many of us do—but when 
those staffs work together, as opposed 
to looking for reasons they shouldn’t 
work together, things happen. 
I remember LAMAR told me one day: 
They always remember the last thing 
you do. 
And if that turns out to be the case, 
at least the last Senate year of Senator 
ALEXANDER has been extraordinary, as 
others have been. 
But this year I had a chance, as the 
appropriating chairman of the com-
mittee that LAMAR is the authorizing 
chairman for—and, by the way, he also 
sits right beside me on the Appropria-
tions Committee in most of our hear-
ings when Senator SHELBY isn’t able to 
be there, the chairman of our full com-
mittee. But in this last year, particu-
larly from March on, we have done so 
many things together. 
In March, April, May, June, there 
was almost never a day when we didn’t 
have at least one call with somebody 
who is running a laboratory or some-
one at the FDA or someone who under-
stood this investment arm we had, 
BARDA, that had been designed about 
10 years earlier but never used as we 
have used it to bring the private sector 
and public sector together in partner-
ship in a way that advances both tests 
and vaccines. 
We would spend sometimes hours a 
day in a series of 30-minute phone 
calls, trying to put the pieces of this 
puzzle together. I remember one day we 
were talking to someone at the White 
House, and the comment from his part 
of the conversation was knowing how 
many other conversations we had had 
that day. 
If people had any idea how much the 
Senate and the two of you—he was say-
ing at that moment—are committed to 
get things done, they would be sur-
prised because that is a story that 
never gets told. 
So much of the story of LAMAR—his 
work here and the good spirit he brings 
to that work—isn’t told, but it is so 
very obvious, certainly for me. 
One of the great gifts of my working 
life has been for LAMAR ALEXANDER to 
be such an important part of it for the 
last 10 years. I am grateful for it; I am 
grateful for him. I look forward to his 
continued friendship and advice. 
I think Senator ALEXANDER, like 
many of us, is more of a next-chapter 
guy than a last-chapter guy. He is nei-
ther shy nor retiring. I expect him to 
continue to have great impact in his 
State and in our country. And, in my 
case, I hope he continues to have great 
impact in my life. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). The Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first, I spoke earlier about Senator 
ALEXANDER, but I would like to com-
pliment my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle. This is a fine and rare mo-
ment of bipartisanship and support of 
somebody we all admire and respect. 
NOMINATION OF ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS 
Madam President, now back to reg-
ular Senate business—I would like to 
conclude my remarks from earlier this 
morning on Senate business, but first I 
want to mention that I just met with 
another of President-Elect Biden’s ex-
ceptionally qualified slate of Cabinet 
nominees over video conference, and 
that was Alejandro Mayorkas for the 
Department of Homeland Security. 
No one exemplifies the hope and 
promise of America better than Ali, an 
immigrant from Cuba who has risen to 
the highest echelons of public service 
in his adopted country. We had an ex-
cellent conversation about how to re-
store integrity and trust at DHS and 
how to make this into a department 
that is not just anti-immigrant but rel-
ishes the fact that immigrants are so 
important to the future of America. 
Now I will note that in previous ad-
ministrations, the Secretary of Home-
land Security has been confirmed by 
the Senate on Inauguration Day for 
President Obama and for President 
Trump. The Senate should continue 
the tradition and quickly confirm Ali 
Mayorkas for the third time so that he 
can get to work on day one of the 
Biden administration. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Madam President, now, on Senate 
business, before the end of the year, 
the Senate has three major priorities: 
Fund the government; pass the annual 
Defense bill; and deliver another round 
of significant COVID relief.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7155 
December 2, 2020 
The appropriators from both sides of 
the aisle continue to have good discus-
sions, and I hope on the funding of the 
government that the final agreement 
can be announced soon. 
Now, the other two priorities, unfor-
tunately, are a bit murkier. Yesterday, 
President Trump issued over Twitter a 
renewed threat on the annual Defense 
bill. Previously, the President threat-
ened to veto this important legislation 
over a provision to rename military in-
stallations named after Confederate 
traitors. 
Now President Trump has issued a 
veto threat by tweet over a policy con-
cerning social media companies, sec-
tion 230, which is in neither version of 
the NDAA already passed by both 
Houses of Congress. 
President Trump must have realized 
that vetoing a pay raise for our troops 
in order to defend the honor of Confed-
erate traitors wasn’t the best message 
to send, so he has found a new com-
plaint. After 4 years of ignoring the 
President’s most vitriolic, conspiracy- 
fueled, and absurd comments on social 
media, I wonder if our Republican col-
leagues would say that they didn’t see 
this particular tweet. 
The truth is, section 230 may actu-
ally need some reform, but that is a se-
rious undertaking that should be done 
in a regular order and can be left for 
another day, and it is certainly not an 
acceptable reason to veto the annual 
Defense bill, which includes policies to 
keep 
our 
military 
prepared, 
well- 
resourced, and equipped to do a dif-
ficult and vital job. 
Nevertheless, it is silly season at the 
White House. The President seems in-
tent on filling each of his remaining 
days in office with petulance, griev-
ance, and self-interest. 
The President is reportedly asking 
his staff about whether he can issue 
preemptive pardons for himself, his 
family members, and Rudy Giuliani. 
There is a simple answer: No. No, Mr. 
President, that would be a gross abuse 
of the Presidential pardon authority. 
But I have a more important question: 
Just how long are our Republican col-
leagues going to indulge the President 
in this nonsense? 
Many of our Republican colleagues 
gave the President space to contest the 
validity of our elections, poisoning 
Americans’ faith in our democracy. 
Now he is threatening to veto a pay 
raise for our troops and considering 
preemptively 
pardoning 
the 
entire 
Trump family. When are our Repub-
lican colleagues in the Senate going to 
say ‘‘Enough already’’? 
At the very least, with respect to the 
Defense bill, Senate Republicans ought 
to find the courage to ignore the Presi-
dent’s eleventh hour ramblings and 
pass the NDAA. 
CORONAVIRUS RELIEF 
Madam President, now, regarding an-
other COVID bill, we seem to be caught 
in a familiar pattern. We all know that 
successfully 
passing 
legislation 
through Congress means that a bill 
must get through the Democratic 
House and get Democratic votes in the 
Senate. 
Passing the law takes a measure of 
bipartisanship and compromise. That is 
why Speaker PELOSI and I sent the Re-
publican leader a new offer on the 
COVID bill. It was an effort to jump- 
start serious negotiations, but, yester-
day, Leader MCCONNELL
announced 
that rather than respond to our offer or 
the bipartisan offer of the so-called 
Gang of 8, he will pursue another par-
tisan proposal before the end of the 
year. He said he was going to talk to 
the Republican leader in the House, the 
Republican President, and that is it— 
not a word with Democrats. 
From early reports in the press, the 
latest Republican offer will be even 
more insufficient than the previous 
two attempts—so insufficient, that ac-
cording to one press report, a Repub-
lican Senator said it was ‘‘offensive’’— 
his word—to struggling Americans for 
the Republican majority to focus on 
another messaging bill. 
Apparently, the latest Republican 
proposal will not include another dime 
of unemployment assistance because, 
according to the Republican whip, it 
was likely something the President 
wouldn’t sign. 
Let’s be clear. The latest Republican 
offer on COVID will include immunity 
for corporations that put their workers 
at risk of COVID–19 but not a dime for 
workers who lost their jobs because of 
the pandemic. 
The Republican leader should not 
waste the Senate’s time on another in-
adequate, partisan proposal and, in-
stead, sit down with Democrats to 
begin a true bipartisan effort to quick-
ly meet the needs of the country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, all postcloture time 
has expired. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Hauptman 
nomination?

The Senator from Wyoming. 
FAREWELL TO THE SENATE 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this morn-
ing we got to hear the farewell speech 
of my friend LAMAR ALEXANDER. He is 
a fantastic speaker and legislator. It 
has been an honor to serve with him 
and to learn from him. Now you get to 
hear from the accountant. 
I rise today to give my farewell 
speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
It has been the honor of a lifetime to 
serve the great people of Wyoming in 
this position for the last 24 years. I 
have really enjoyed being a Senator— 
not for the title, not for the recogni-
tion, and certainly not for the pub-
licity. 
I love solving problems for folks in 
Wyoming and America. I like working 
on legislation. It might shock those 
who know me, but I never intended to 
get into politics. While I always had 
great respect for those who served in 
public office, it wasn’t my calling when 
I left college. 
But over 50 years ago, when I joined 
the young men’s leadership training 
group known as the Jaycees, at a State 
convention in Cody I spoke about the 
value of leadership in communities. 
The keynote speaker was Al Simp-
son, who would go on to serve three 
terms in the U.S. Senate. After I gave 
my pitch on the importance of leader-
ship training, Senator Simpson did his 
usual fascinating and humorous speech 
and then took me aside and said: I 
don’t even know what party you are in, 
but it is time you put your money 
where your mouth is on this leadership 
stuff and get into politics. That town 
you live in, Gillette, needs a mayor. 
My wife Diana and I had only moved 
to Gillette a few years earlier. The 
town was facing a crisis as the dis-
covery of oil, gas, and coal turned it 
into a boomtown. The population start-
ed to skyrocket, and city services were 
not keeping up. 
On the way home from that Cody 
meeting, while my wife was driving, I 
told her what Senator Simpson had 
said and that I was thinking maybe I 
should run for mayor. It must have 
come as quite a shock because she 
ended up swerving into the borrow pit 
and then coming back up onto the 
road. 
We ended up talking about it seri-
ously for the 4 hours that it took to 
drive back to Gillette and thought of a 
lot of things that needed to be done to 
make a difference in our town. 
I was new to the community and just 
29 years old, but I thought that Gillette 
was in need of a budget, agendas, and 
planning—not the most exciting topics 
to get people’s attention. I ran anyway, 
and I did win. 
Nearly five decades later, having 
served as mayor, having served in the 
State house, having served as a State 
senator and then as a U.S. Senator, I 
still find myself motivated by the urge 
to help my community and my coun-
try. 
I also find myself still pushing those 
same three ideas that I did when I first

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7158 
December 2, 2020 
ran for mayor: budgets, agendas, and 
planning. I keep finding myself want-
ing to help solve problems. Once you 
embrace that responsibility, it is hard 
to ever ignore it again. I have found 
that many of my colleagues in Con-
gress tend to feel the same way. 
The Senate is a very different place 
than when I arrived in 1997, and it is a 
very different place than it was in 1789 
when the very first Senate met. But 
over all those years, it has been a place 
for folks rising to the challenge of 
being a leader. We are looking to make 
our communities and country a better 
place. We might not always agree on 
what the solutions are, but we can re-
spect each other for working to find 
one. 
Over the years, I have learned a great 
deal from those around me. Just like I 
listened to Senator Al Simpson all 
those years back, I have tried to keep 
an open mind to learning from others. 
Now that my time in the Senate is 
coming to a close, I would like to pass 
along some of the lessons I was 
taught—and some I learned the hard 
way—in the hopes that it may be use-
ful for my colleagues working to get 
things accomplished in the Senate and 
for anybody who wants to be a leader 
in their community. 
In my office we have a mission state-
ment. It reads: 
We have been given a sacred trust to work 
for our families, grandparents, and grand-
children. We will respect the wisdom of those 
before and the future of those to follow. We 
will discharge this trust through our legisla-
tive policy, our constituent services, and the 
way we treat each other, guided by these 
three principles: 
Doing What Is Right 
Doing Our Best 
Treating others as They Wish to be Treat-
ed 
These last three principles are advice 
my mom gave me often, and they re-
main my core values. Every member of 
my staff is given that mission state-
ment when they start, and we rely on 
it to remind us why we are here and 
how we should act. 
It isn’t just a saying. It is a way to 
work, a way to build trust, and a way 
to govern. These values are not always 
easy to live by. We are all human, and 
we all struggle to live up to these 
ideals we set for ourselves, but that is 
why we call them ideals. 
I believe these are values we can all 
agree on, and by remembering the val-
ues we share, we can work together to 
tackle tough problems and find shared 
solutions. 
‘‘Do what is right’’ is a great slogan, 
but you might ask what it means at a 
practical level. People see a mess in 
Washington, so how do we actually 
make progress? I believe it involves fo-
cusing on common ground over com-
promise, especially when it comes to 
legislating. 
People sometimes think that com-
promise is the answer. I think it means 
that I give in to something I don’t like, 
and you give in to something you don’t 
like, and we both wind up with some-
thing neither of us likes. That is not 
legislating. 
When it comes to legislating, often 
the best way to get something done 
that everyone can agree on is to leave 
out the things you don’t agree on and 
focus on what you can get done. That is 
why I suggest my 80 percent tool. 
Generally speaking, people can talk 
civilly on 80 percent of the issues. It is 
only on about 20 percent of the issues 
that we find real contention. Now, even 
picking a single issue out of the 80 per-
cent, you might still find disagree-
ment, but once again, you can probably 
focus on 80 percent of the issue that 
you can agree on. 
It is all about focusing on what you 
can get done and not focusing on the 
points of disagreement, the weeds of 
debate that have choked issues, or, to 
say it another way, it is all about what 
you leave out. 
Former Senator Ted Kennedy, from 
Massachusetts, and I used this tool 
when we led the Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions Committee to-
gether, and it worked great. It worked 
even though we were on complete oppo-
site sides of the political spectrum. 
I once showed Senator Kennedy an 
article that mentioned how unusual it 
was for the most conservative Senator 
and the third most liberal Senator to 
work together, to which he said: So 
who is ahead of me? 
We were able to get legislation 
passed that others had been trying to 
do for years. Here is how we started 
working together. When I first got to 
the Senate, I wanted to change some 
things with OSHA—the Occupational 
Safety and Health. Senator Kennedy, 
at the urging of my predecessor, Sen-
ator Simpson, did let me sit down and 
take him through the bill a section at 
a time. That is something we always 
did in the Wyoming Legislature. When 
we marked up the bill in committee, 
Senator Kennedy said: In all my years 
in the Senate, I have never had any-
body take me through a bill a section 
at a time, but I am still going to have 
to vote against it. It still got out of 
committee. But later he called me 
about a safety bill he had been working 
on for over a decade—a bill to save 
nurses and medical janitors from acci-
dental needlesticks—and asked if I 
would take a look at it. I did. The big-
gest suggestion that I gave was to 
leave out a couple of small parts that 
had been jamming up the bill. The bill 
passed the Senate and the House 
unamended and was signed. And now 
you see needle disposals in restrooms 
and all sorts of places. And the issue 
has never had to be readdressed. 
Later, I became the Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions chair, and 
Senator Kennedy was the ranking 
member. We used the 80-percent tool. 
We were able to get 35 bills through the 
HELP Committee in the 109th Con-
gress. Twenty-seven of them made 
their way to the President’s desk and 
were signed into public law. In be-
tween, we were able to report out 352 
nominations for consideration by the 
full Senate. 
Here is how the 80-percent tool 
worked. At the beginning of each year, 
each of us made a list of the issues the 
committee should do. We compared 
lists. We made an effort to argue some 
to be on both lists. Then we worked on 
the ones on both lists. We usually had 
a duplication of about 80 percent of the 
issues. Then we could pick out any 
issue and work on it, usually agreeing 
on 80 percent of that issue. If we 
couldn’t find a new way to do the part 
that had been argued for years, we sim-
ply left it out, believing that 80 percent 
finished is better than 20 percent that 
only makes the press. 
The 80-percent tool is where all of 
our energy, attention, and talents 
could be focused. If we just worked on 
the 20 percent that we don’t agree on, 
and never will agree on, we will only 
generate headlines about how hard we 
are working, with nothing actually 
getting done, just gridlock. 
When the news comes on, if we are 
here in the Chamber arguing and bick-
ering and getting nothing done, we are 
focusing too much on the 20 percent. If 
people do not see much of us, that 
means we are taking on the 80 percent 
and making progress without headlines 
and often with unanimous consent. 
What we are really talking about is 
working together. That is what the 
heart of the 80-percent tool is. Often-
times, people say what we need is more 
bipartisanship, and there is a very 
practical reason for that. In the Sen-
ate, you can’t get anything done with-
out working with the other side unless 
one party has 60 votes or more, which 
is rare. And even with 60 votes from 
one party, the bills that party passes 
when they have a supermajority often 
are flawed. It turns out that when we 
work together, we can create a better 
bill than when we just try do it alone 
or force others to accept our ideas. 
That is why success is not really about 
compromise. It is really about what 
you leave out—or finding a way to ac-
complish it doing a mutually agreeable 
new way. 
We used to take the people who had 
similar amendments and send them off 
to see if they could come up with one 
amendment. Quite often, they could. It 
was fascinating, when they came back, 
they said: It was my idea. And when all 
of them report to you that it was their 
idea, you know that you have enough 
votes to pass it. 
That is why success is not really 
about compromise; it is about what 
you leave out or finding a third way to 
come up with a mutually agreeable 
goal. Here are a few key steps that I 
used to find that common ground to 
pass legislation. First, find someone 
from the other side of the aisle who 
likes to legislate. 
Second, discover and agree on com-
mon goals. 
Third, consult with stakeholders that 
will or could affect the changes being 
discussed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7159 
December 2, 2020 
Fourth, hold roundtables instead of 
hearings. With hearings, each side 
beats up on the other’s witness with 
clever, stump-the-professor-type ques-
tions. At a roundtable, people who have 
actually done something on a policy 
share their real-life experiences. 
Finally, you set aside the part of the 
issues you can’t agree on for another 
day. Now you will have a bill that has 
a good chance of being passed and 
signed into law. That is the heart of 
the 80-percent tool. 
This way of working also ensures 
that we can disagree without being dis-
agreeable. There is a lot of vitriol in 
our politics and our world right now, 
but you can stay true to what you be-
lieve in without treating others badly. 
Nothing gets done when we are just 
telling each other how wrong we are. 
Just ask yourself, has anyone ever 
really changed your opinion by getting 
in your face and yelling at you or say-
ing how wrong you are? Usually, that 
doesn’t change hearts or minds. That 
might make the attacker feel better in 
the moment, but it doesn’t do much for 
getting anything accomplished. Fol-
lowing the 80-percent tool will not get 
you notoriety. It won’t get you fame. It 
won’t get you headlines. Most media 
coverage requires ‘‘blood in the water.’’ 
However, the ability to work among 
your peers using this method can, and 
will, move us forward and get things 
done. 
This tool is only successful if we are 
actually working on passing legislation 
together, and that means letting the 
Senate work as it was intended. One of 
the best ways to do that is to allow the 
members of each committee to actu-
ally take time to craft bills. The com-
mittees are where the experts are and 
where I think some of the best work 
gets done. I have already made it clear 
that I don’t think hearings are overly 
useful and are often wasted on col-
lecting soundbites for the evening 
news. Instead, we should be encour-
aging committees to give their mem-
bers more say in crafting legislation 
and working together on best solu-
tions. If you look at bills that pass 
with strong bipartisan support, they 
are usually because flaws were ironed 
out in committee. Legislation is often-
times at its best when it has taken 
time in committees being hashed out 
until it is ready for prime time. You 
might not always be able to get every-
one on board, but if you have done it 
right, you should see strong bipartisan 
support. 
Sometimes this also means letting 
others take credit for your ideas. An 
old salesman’s trick is to convince oth-
ers that your good idea was really their 
good idea. Don’t let your vanity stand 
in the way of getting the job done. 
Too often, in the modern Senate, leg-
islation is rushed out of committee to 
the Senate floor. And then once it hits 
the Senate floor, both sides try to pre-
vent amendments, but the process of 
allowing amendments and debates is a 
core component of how the Senate was 
designed to operate. Without it, the 
Senate can get gummed up. The gears 
can get jammed. Without the fresh air 
that new ideas and legitimate debate 
brings, tensions can rise as Senators 
feel unable to make progress. 
The difficulty is that each party is so 
worried about the next election, look-
ing to hold on to the majority, that ev-
erybody is either trying to force the 
other side to take politically perilous 
votes or trying to avoid taking those 
votes themselves. No matter which 
party is in charge, we end up blocking 
amendments and shying away from al-
lowing legislation to be altered on the 
floor of the Senate. And usually those 
tough votes don’t really make any dif-
ference. 
It might help if Members made it 
clear to leadership they would be will-
ing to take some tough votes in return 
for more chances to amend major legis-
lation on the floor. People might be 
less likely to demand votes on a poison 
pill or messaging designed to put the 
other party in a tough spot if they 
knew they could face the same treat-
ment. In the end, the onus is on the 
Members of the Senate, on us, to take 
on a responsibility to work together in 
return for a chance to pass legislation. 
I suggest that amendments should have 
to have 60 votes. If it was so bad that 
it needed a filibuster, the 60 votes 
would be required to end that. But that 
takes about 3 days. So many have been 
willing to allow their amendment to 
have a 60-vote threshold, and if it was 
strong enough, it passed anyway. 
I also ask you to avoid comprehen-
sive. Comprehensive bills make it so 
large that everyone can find a reason 
to vote against it. Senator ALEXANDER 
is a big promoter of step-by-step. That 
is taking a piece of legislation and 
solving it, and then taking the next 
step and solving it, and so on. This 
practical solution would avoid passing 
comprehensive legislation. Comprehen-
sive legislation is usually a byproduct 
of compromise, not common ground, 
and often ends up being incomprehen-
sible. Giant bills that try to do every-
thing usually end up with too many un-
intended consequences and include a 
litany of unrelated pieces of legislation 
that are merely hitching a ride because 
otherwise they would never be able to 
stand on their own merits. 
These ‘‘Christmas tree’’ bills are 
often designed so that if you vote 
against it, you would be voting against 
some key legislation for your constitu-
ents. Once again, the ugly nature of 
compromise over common ground is 
clear. 
A simple solution I have proposed 
would be to pass more bills as indi-
vidual pieces of legislation, that step- 
by-step. In Wyoming, bills have to be 
focused on a single subject, and all 
amendments need to be relevant. In the 
past, I have introduced a bill that 
would require that here, but it never 
was really treated seriously. 
To talk on a little different article, 
my favorite article of the Constitution 
is article V. The reason it is, is it 
assures that all States will have equal 
representation in the Senate. And that 
can’t even be changed by a constitu-
tional Congress. Since I come from one 
of those low-population States, it is 
very important to us. Sometimes we 
are criticized for being overrepresented 
in the Senate. We have two Senators, 
the same as California, New York, and 
Texas. But in this argument of unfair 
representation for States, we find the 
same inherent issues we do with the fil-
ibuster; our government was not set up 
to be majority rule by population 
alone. Our Founders, through their own 
debate, were able to understand the 
risk of pure democracy and the benefits 
of a federalist system, where ideas were 
represented not just by population but 
by regions and shared cultures. Wyo-
mingites deserve to have their cultural 
say in our system protected against 
the majority. We are all in the United 
States of America. 
The Senate represents more than just 
the people. To protect the individuality 
of the States, of the culture of those 
who live in the regions of the country 
less populated, and it also represents 
States that founded our federalist sys-
tem. Of course, at that time, several of 
them had little population. 
I have covered a lot of ground, but 
for my last piece of advice, I would call 
on my colleagues to recognize that it is 
time to formally allow electronics on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate. It is an 
issue near and dear to my heart and 
one I think will help how we work in 
the Senate. It is clear that anyone who 
watches C–SPAN that all of us are al-
ready breaking the spirit of the law, 
checking our phones on occasion as we 
walk off or onto the floor. Those de-
vices are often inseparable from our 
ability to do our work. We rely on 
them to do almost everything. It is 
time 
to 
make 
this 
commonsense 
change, allowing iPads to be used for 
speeches, as long as they are laid on 
the lectern like a paper speech. And if 
Senators could do some work from 
their desks, like early Senators had to 
do, we would listen to more of the 
speeches and get something done. 
I do remember when I brought that 
one up before, that it was covered by— 
in 1997, I thought it was important that 
we have that use. TIME magazine did a 
special article on it. I remember Sen-
ator MCCONNELL going to New York 
City and coming back to report to me 
that he got in a cab and the cabdriver 
said: You are a United States Senator, 
aren’t you? Of course, he proudly was. 
The guy said: So when are you going to 
let the guy from Wyoming have his 
computer on the floor? Senator MCCON-
NELL told me if I had lobbied it down to 
cabbies, that it was time to do it. But 
we still haven’t done it. 
As we move forward, of course, our 
country has no shortage of problems 
we need to address. Some are out of our 
control, but many of our own making. 
If my experience over the years has 
taught me anything, it is that we will

never be able to tackle these chal-
lenges unless we find common areas of 
agreements and work to solve these 
problems together. 
I hope that everyone listening—espe-
cially my colleagues in the Senate—re-
members the core values I spoke of 
today: Do what is right. Do what is 
best. Treat others as they wish to be 
treated. 
I truly believe if we adhered to these 
ideals, the world would be a better 
place for our children and grand-
children. 
I want, again, to thank the people of 
Wyoming for giving me the oppor-
tunity to serve them. I also want to 
thank my colleagues and friends who 
supported me over the years. I want to 
thank all the amazing staff I have had 
over the years in my personal office, in 
the DC office, in my State offices in 
Wyoming; and my staff on the Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee and on the Budget Committee. 
Over the years, I have gotten to work 
with incredible staff that made it pos-
sible to do more than a Senator by 
himself or herself could ever do. Thank 
you for working so hard over the years. 
I also want to give the most thanks 
to my family for all of their support 
over the years, especially to my wife 
Diana. It has been a long journey since 
I told Diana that I was thinking of run-
ning for mayor. 
You have supported me more than 
anyone can truly comprehend, and, in 
no uncertain terms, I couldn’t have 
done it without you. It has been more 
than 50 amazing years together, and I 
look forward to our next adventure. 
I yield the floor. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COT-
TON). The Senator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to pay tribute 
to this great Wyoming leader. For 
nearly a quarter of a century, MIKE 
ENZI has represented the people of Wy-
oming in Washington, and he has done 
it with intelligence, with intensity, 
and with integrity. 
The Cowboy State and the Capitol 
are going to sorely miss MIKE ENZI. He 
has truly supplemented his legacy as 
the trusted trail boss of the Wyoming 
congressional delegation, and it has 
been an incredible honor and a great 
privilege for my wife Bobbi and me to 
serve the people of Wyoming alongside 
MIKE and his wife, Diana, who is with 
us today. 
MIKE is truly a devoted family man, 
as well as a man of great and deep 
faith. In fact, MIKE
taught Sunday 
school over the decades. Many in the 
Wyoming faith community know that 
MIKE’s first Sunday schoolteacher in 
Thermopolis, WY, was my wife Bobbi’s 
mother Jerry Brown. 
Jerry and her husband Bob, a World 
War II and Korean war veteran, both 
passed away this past year, and they 
had been married 70 years. She taught 
Sunday school in Thermopolis, WY, 
and her star pupil was MIKE ENZI, to 
the point that she actually gave MIKE 
ENZI his first Bible, and he still has 
that today. 
Here in the Senate, MIKE has been 
not just a close friend to me and a 
mentor to me, but he has been that to 
many Members of this body. 
MIKE was sworn in 1997. Throughout 
four terms in the U.S. Senate, he has 
never wavered in his commitment to 
God, to family, to country, and, of 
course, to Wyoming. He is known by 
many as the Senate’s moral compass. 
He is a remarkable spiritual leader of 
our bipartisan Prayer Breakfast. I am 
a member of that group and a number 
of Senators are as well. We met today, 
and MIKE led us in prayer. 
I have seen firsthand just how much 
Republican and Democrat Members de-
pend on MIKE for his moral and ethical 
guidance. He really is a bipartisan not 
just policymaker but also a peace-
maker, and we have all seen it within 
this body. 
His legislation—he talked about the 
80–20 rule. It has a long history of gar-
nering overwhelming bipartisan sup-
port. Over 100 Enzi bills have become 
law. I have been proud to sponsor and 
cosponsor many of them with him in 
my time in the Senate. The thing he 
didn’t point out is that most of the 
bills passed with over 80 votes. It is 
rare for an Enzi bill to get to the floor 
and pass with any more than 15 to 18 
‘‘no’’ votes. It is a remarkable accom-
plishment. 
It is important to note that these 
bills have been signed by Republican 
and Democrat Presidents. When you go 
into his office, his whole conference 
room walls are filled with bills and 
pens—signed into law with the pens 
being used by Bill Clinton, by George 
W. Bush, by Barack Obama, and by 
President Donald Trump. 
Behind all of these, as he just talked 
about, is that very successful 80–20 
rule—a rule that he learned while in 
the Wyoming State Legislature, and it 
has worked extremely well for him 
here in Washington as well. 
But such is the practical Western 
wisdom in MIKE ENZI. Born in 1944 in 
Bremerton, WA, his father was there 
serving in the naval shipyards during 
World War II. He moved his family to 
Wyoming shortly thereafter, and that 
is when he started elementary school 
in Thermopolis, WY. They moved to 
Sheridan, where he graduated from 
high school. 
MIKE didn’t talk about this today, 
but there MIKE earned his Eagle Scout 
award. He is a proud Eagle Scout, as is 
his son Brad. His grandson is working 
on it as well. MIKE has been named a 
‘‘Distinguished Eagle’’ by the Scouts. 
He has a bachelor’s degree in ac-
counting from George Washington Uni-
versity and an MBA in retail mar-
keting from the University of Denver 
in Colorado. 
MIKE and Diana moved to Gillette in 
1969, where they started their own 
small business. It is wonderful to listen 
to MIKE talk about small businesses. It 
is called NZ Shoes, not as he spells his 
last name, E-N-Z-I, but the letter ‘‘N’’ 
and the letter ‘‘Z’’ so people could re-
member NZ Shoes. They later expanded 
their successful family business to 
Miles City, MT, and to Sheridan, WY. 
But Gillette, WY, is MIKE’s true 
home and where his heart is. He served 
2 terms as Gillette’s mayor. During his 
8 years as mayor, MIKE led Gillette to 
their first economic boom. He served 10 
years in the Wyoming State Legisla-
ture as a State rep, as well as a State 
senator. Wyoming is MIKE’s world. 
Family means the world to MIKE. 
They are the proud parents of three: 
Amy, Emily, and Brad; and even 
prouder grandparents of four: Megan, 
Allison, Trey, and Lilly. 
Now, anyone who knows MIKE knows 
that he loves to fish. Even during Pray-
er Breakfast today, when you watched 
on the Zoom call, behind MIKE you 
could see on the wall the fishing rod 
and all the lures he uses in fishing on 
display. He is an accomplished and avid 
fly-fisherman. 
In 
August 
2015, 
he 
achieved every fly-fisherman’s dream, 
completing his Wyoming Cutt-Slam. 
This Wyoming Game and Fish Depart-
ment program increases appreciation 
for our native cutthroat trout. 
If you want to talk to MIKE about 
anything, talk to him about fishing. 
His passion comes through with his 
love of nature for spending so much 
time in nature’s cathedral of the great 
outdoors. He fishes in majestic spots 
throughout Wyoming and all over the 
world. 
Well, here in Washington, MIKE has 
been a leading voice on budget, on tax, 
and on healthcare issues. He serves on 
the Senate Budget Committee and has 
been chairman since 2015. As the first 
accountant to chair the Budget Com-
mittee, MIKE is committed to making 
government more accountable to hard- 
working American taxpayers. He has 
been a tremendous Budget chairman. 
That is because he learned valuable 
lessons in the Wyoming Legislature 
where, like all American families, you 
need to balance your budget every year 
and live within your means. 
Under MIKE’s leadership, Congress 
passed balanced budget resolutions for 
fiscal years 2016 and 2017 and 2018. He 
worked tirelessly to pass these budg-
ets—even working through the night 
all week for the marathon floor debates 
called vote-aramas. His budget blue-
prints offered a better fiscal path by re-
ducing wasteful spending, by light-
ening tax burdens, and by boosting eco-
nomic growth. 
MIKE’s fiscal year 2018 budget not 
only provided a path to balance; it 
paved the way for pro-growth, pro-jobs 
tax relief legislation, the most com-
prehensive reform in the Tax Code in 
over a generation. As a reconciliation 
bill, this historic 2017 tax reform bill, 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, went 
through MIKE’s Budget Committee. 
As Budget chairman, MIKE has also 
focused on the soaring national debt, 
budget process reform, and oversight of 
Federal programs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7161 
December 2, 2020 
MIKE also served as a member of the 
Senate Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions Committee since his arrival 
in the Senate. And as a former chair-
man and ranking member, he cham-
pioned the efforts to ensure a quality 
education for all. He expanded access 
to affordable, quality healthcare, and 
he spearheaded the most significant 
pension reform in 30 years, securing 
millions of Americans’ retirement. 
He is also a member of the Senate Fi-
nance Committee, Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs Committee, 
and the Joint Committee on Taxation. 
Other policy successes include im-
proving mine safety, helping end the 
AIDS epidemic in Africa, and passing 
mental health parity. 
MIKE’s highest priority, of course, 
has always been helping the people of 
Wyoming. As he said in announcing his 
retirement, ‘‘I am an advocate for Gil-
lette and Campbell County and Wyo-
ming.’’ He went on to say, ‘‘I point out 
that everyone lives at the local level. 
No one lives at the Federal level—or 
even the state level.’’ He said, ‘‘So 
Diana and I are your Chamber of Com-
merce and economic development peo-
ple for every town and county in Wyo-
ming all the time.’’ 
MIKE started several annual events to 
boost our State—the Inventors Con-
ference, the Procurement Conference, 
and Wyoming Works Tours. 
In 2009, MIKE and I started Wyoming 
Wednesdays, and it quickly became a 
big hit. This is a great tradition. When 
people of Wyoming come to Wash-
ington, we greet them every week and 
get together for coffee and host a time 
of doughnuts and friendship, and people 
love to attend. 
But MIKE, as well as Diana, are a 
force in the Senate. Diana did it again 
just recently. MIKE has called Diana 
‘‘the most thoughtful person’’ in the 
world, and that is no exaggeration. 
Here in the Senate, every year Diana 
hosts a Christmas cookie party to 
thank, as they describe, the ‘‘real 
workers’’ who keep the Senate run-
ning—the 
janitors, 
cleaning 
crews, 
electricians, police officers, and food 
service workers. Every year, Diana and 
her friends work hundreds of hours and 
bake hundreds of dozens of cookies. All 
the Senate workers look forward to 
Diana’s 200-dozen cookie thank-you 
event. That is not 200 cookies. It is 200 
dozen cookies. It is not unusual for 
people to come up to Diana in the hall-
way and ask when the party is. MIKE is 
the wonderful cohost. 
This year, because of coronavirus, 
she couldn’t do all the baking, but they 
have the cookie festival with baked 
cookies. Those who couldn’t get to re-
ceive them in locations, MIKE
and 
Diana walked the halls of this building 
and the Senate office buildings to 
make sure that the guards and the 
custodians and janitors and others got 
their Christmas cookies. 
MIKE is usually a man of few words, 
but in a recent Prayer Breakfast, he re-
minded everyone about the importance 
of thinking before we speak. He titled 
his presentation ‘‘Me and My Big 
Mouth.’’ He reminded us that our 
mouths cannot be trained—as you said, 
MIKE—only guarded. 
MIKE is a true Wyoming gentleman, 
someone who will always be a great 
friend and a mentor to me, to younger 
people in Wyoming, and to everyone 
here in the Senate. 
In my office, there is a picture on the 
wall of my first day in the Senate, 
right here in 2007, being sworn in by 
then-Vice President Cheney, with Sen-
ator ENZI, along with former Senator 
Malcolm Wallop, standing behind. It 
has been a tremendous privilege to 
serve with MIKE from the very first day 
in the U.S. Senate. 
The people of Wyoming owe him an 
incredible debt of gratitude for his tire-
less and faithful service. MIKE’s char-
acter, his courage, and his credibility 
have cemented his legacy as a highly 
respected leader of the Senate. 
So today many Senators are here 
gathering to listen to, to honor, and to 
thank MIKE ENZI for his decades of dis-
tinguished service to the Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is 
hard to follow those heartfelt words 
from Senator BARRASSO about his col-
league and friend and our friend MIKE 
ENZI, but I am going to make a try. 
Just as our tribute to LAMAR ALEX-
ANDER was a tribute to the better an-
gels of nature as they are shown in the 
lives of Senators, so, too, was MIKE 
ENZI. I join my colleagues in thanking 
MIKE for his service to Wyoming and to 
America. 
One of the most frequent questions 
many of us are asked is, Why can’t you 
folks get along in Washington? Why 
can’t you just do things together? I say 
to them that there are times when we 
do, and the many times are very impor-
tant. When we do come together, it is 
because of people like MIKE, who 
worked under his so-called 80–20 rule. 
We know that well, don’t we? He would 
tell you he believes both sides could 
agree on 80 percent of the substance, 
and if negotiators are willing to give 
up the other 20 percent, we could actu-
ally get some things done around here. 
Wouldn’t that be refreshing? 
One of those items was the Market-
place Fairness Act. MIKE helped to lead 
the fight for local brick-and-mortar re-
tailers in order to give them a chance 
to compete on an equal and level play-
ing field with online sellers, email 
companies, and internet companies and 
to allow the States and localities to 
collect much needed sales tax revenue. 
It is hard to imagine how many years 
MIKE put into that effort, but the Mar-
ketplace Fairness Act would have 
given the States the option to require 
from out-of-State businesses, such as 
those selling online, the collection of 
taxes owed under State law in the same 
way local businesses are required. 
MIKE knew a lot about local business. 
As was mentioned on the floor by Sen-
ator BARRASSO, his colleague, he was a 
small business owner in Gillette, WY, 
running NZ Shoes. Even as he went on 
to become mayor of Gillette at age 30, 
a staff sergeant in the Wyoming Air 
National Guard, a State representa-
tive, and then a State senator, he was 
always still the small business man 
from Gillette. 
In 1996, when he was recovering from 
open-heart surgery, then-Senator Alan 
Simpson decided not to run for reelec-
tion. Local leaders kept trying to talk 
MIKE into running. He really just want-
ed to have more time to hunt and fish. 
In the end, he made an important deci-
sion. He ran, and he won. His career 
has had many legislative successes in 
having used his 80–20 rule. 
I will never forget the days when Ted 
Kennedy would come to the floor and 
talk about the compromise and the 
bargain he had struck with you. I had 
thought what a political odd couple, 
but the two of you did some remark-
able things. 
Poles apart in terms of political phi-
losophy, they treated each other with 
respect, and they had amazing suc-
cesses to show for it. Even when he has 
differing views on the best ways to re-
solve issues, MIKE ENZI shows a willing-
ness to come to the table and discuss 
the areas in which we can agree. 
In 2012, Democratic Senator Byron 
Dorgan retired. I called MIKE
after 
Byron left and asked if I could take up 
Byron’s position in his fight for the 
Marketplace Fairness Act. He said: 
Let’s do it. We brought in Senator 
LAMAR ALEXANDER—that was a pretty 
smart move—and then Senator Heidi 
Heitkamp, who both made great con-
tributions to our work. It was our luck 
that Heidi Heitkamp was the petitioner 
of the 1992 Supreme Court case Quill 
Corp. v. North Dakota, which made the 
Marketplace Fairness Act necessary. 
We were an unexpected group of Sen-
ators—two Republicans and two Demo-
crats who were literally from all over 
the United States. We disagreed on 
some things, sure, but we agreed that 
Main Street business needed a break 
and deserved fair treatment. We kept 
working on it with MIKE ENZI’s leader-
ship, and, in 2013, the Marketplace 
Fairness Act passed the Senate, over-
whelmingly, with 69 votes. Unfortu-
nately, the House of Representatives, 
once again, broke our heart and didn’t 
act on it. We kept introducing the bill. 
Main Street businesses were still 
struggling against the unfair advan-
tage that internet-only retailers had. 
Visitors to my office might have no-
ticed a little something that was in my 
office that I have brought to the floor 
today and wondered what this was all 
about. This was a gift from MIKE ENZI 
after we were successful in the U.S. 
Senate. It is a small, wooden, three- 
note train whistle. It would be a viola-
tion of the Senate rules to blow the 
whistle, but I want to tell you that it 
was a gift from MIKE for our work we 
did together in helping to get the bill 
down the tracks of the legislative proc-
ess.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7162 
December 2, 2020 
We were never able to get the House 
to take up the measure, but, in 2018, 
the Supreme Court finally did the right 
thing. In a 5-to-4 ruling in South Da-
kota v. Wayfair, Inc., the Court closed 
the loophole we had been struggling to 
fight and address for years. I am proud 
to be a part of that bipartisan coali-
tion. In Illinois, it has meant a lot. We 
estimate that our State has received 
$460 million in annual revenue by vir-
tue of MIKE ENZI’s determination and 
leadership on the marketplace fairness 
front. 
In this pandemic crisis, this revenue 
is more important than ever. MIKE has 
always been a force for fairness, a 
friend, and a leader for whom I have 
great respect. As we fight this pan-
demic, we should strive to abide by 
MIKE’s 80–20 rule and remember that 
Main Street businesses are really hurt-
ing and need our help. 
I know MIKE will have more time 
now for fishing and hunting. I wish him 
and Diana, his wonderful wife—and she 
is a wonderful person—and their grand-
children happiness. I look forward to 
reading about the next chapter in MIKE 
ENZI’s life of giving and caring. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, MIKE 
ENZI and I were both sworn in to do our 
first terms in the U.S. Senate on Janu-
ary 7, 1997. I immediately saw in the 
gentleman from Wyoming a quiet, ef-
fective, and ethical leader who was fo-
cused not on partisan advantage but, 
rather, on results—results that would 
benefit the people who had sent him to 
Washington and results that would 
benefit the American people as a 
whole. 
The nearly 24 years since then have 
only confirmed my initial impression. 
For the first 14 of those years, MIKE 
was the sole accountant in the Senate. 
That discipline, combined with his ex-
perience as a small business owner, 
have served him so well in his role as 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
the Budget. He knows how important it 
is to set a budget, to follow it, and to 
control spending. His priority has al-
ways been the American taxpayer. As 
chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget and as a member of the Senate 
Committee on Finance, he has been a 
leader on tax issues as well. He helped 
to shape the 2017 tax reform act, which 
has helped to boost economic growth 
and the creation of more jobs. 
MIKE’s leadership style is character-
ized by his willingness to always search 
for common ground. He described in 
great depth today what he calls his 80– 
20 rule, and anyone who has ever 
worked with MIKE ENZI on any issue 
quickly learns about the 80–20 rule. 
Through it, he forges solutions where 
many others see only impasse. The key 
to success in moving legislation, as he 
told us today, is to focus on the 80 per-
cent of issues on which agreement can 
be found and not waste time on the 20 
percent on which the disagreements 
are insurmountable. 
That rule served him well when he, 
along with the late Senator Ted Ken-
nedy, sat at the helm of the Senate 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. Well, as MIKE has 
described today, it would be difficult to 
think of two individuals serving in the 
Senate who had more different polit-
ical philosophies than he and Ted Ken-
nedy. You could probably say that this 
is true with his current ranking mem-
ber of the Budget Committee. Yet, to-
gether, he and Senator Kennedy craft-
ed dozens of laws. Neither side got 100 
percent of what it wanted. They put 
aside the areas of disagreement. For 
them, it was far more important that 
progress was made for the American 
people. 
In serving with MIKE on the HELP 
Committee, I have seen him employ 
this rule over and over again to bring 
about real progress. He has led efforts 
to help to ensure that everyone can re-
ceive a quality education. He has 
helped to provide Americans with ac-
cess to affordable, quality healthcare. 
He has helped to protect workers and 
foster job training opportunities. As 
the leader of the committee, he has 
worked to oversee the biggest revision 
in 
pension 
laws 
in 
30 
years—to 
strengthen funding rules to enhance re-
tirement security for millions of Amer-
icans. 
MIKE comes from a small business 
background, and as Senator DURBIN 
just described, he was passionate about 
the Marketplace Fairness Act—to en-
able States to collect sales and use 
taxes from out-of-State online retail-
ers. He recognized that the brick-and- 
mortar Main Street businesses that 
provide local jobs should not be penal-
ized. MIKE and I also worked together 
on successful legislation to improve 
workplace safety for postal employees 
and to better protect the American 
people from deceptive mailings that 
mimic official government documents. 
Senator MIKE ENZI has compiled a 
long record of selfless service as a busi-
ness leader, as a member of the Wyo-
ming Air National Guard, as a mayor, 
as a State legislator, and as an in-
volved citizen. When he announced his 
intention early last year to leave the 
Senate, he said that he had no definite 
plans other than to find other ways to 
serve. I am 100 percent certain that the 
author of the 80–20 rule will continue 
to contribute to his community, his 
State, and our Nation. I wish him and 
his beloved wife Diana all the best in 
the years to come. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
have had the pleasure of working with 
my chairman on the Budget Committee 
on budget reform initiatives, and I 
want to take this occasion to thank 
him for the wonderful way in which he 
worked with me on those issues and for 
all of his support. 
I want to make a pledge to him as 
well. The effort began with a lot of 
hearings in the Budget Committee to 
sort out how we could reform what we 
were doing. At the moment, the Budget 
Committee is, probably, the most dys-
functional piece of this dysfunctional 
institution, and Chairman ENZI was de-
termined to remedy that. A lot of work 
went in at the committee level. Then a 
bicameral committee was created to 
look at budget reform, primarily out of 
the House, and I had the opportunity to 
serve on that bicameral committee. 
That was an opportunity that I owe to 
Chairman ENZI. He both advocated for 
me to his leader that I should be on 
that committee, and he gave up a spot 
on that committee to make sure there 
was a spot for me there. I hope and be-
lieve that I conducted myself in due ac-
cord with Chairman ENZI’s wishes and 
principles in the course of that. 
We had the ability to use that bi-
cameral committee process to do a test 
run of our budget reform, and I am 
pleased to report that, although the 
end product was never adopted between 
the two bodies, the product that came 
out of the committee included our 
budget reform as it was then con-
stituted. We raised our aspiration from 
the budget reform as it was then con-
stituted, which was entirely voluntary, 
to actually try to change the Budget 
Committee’s rules to force the process 
of the Budget Committee into the mold 
of the voluntary structure. We did good 
work on that, and we came to an agree-
ment. I am sorry to say that its failure 
to pass into law arose not from prob-
lems on the Republican side of the aisle 
but from problems on my side of the 
aisle that I have been unable to yet 
surmount. 
My pledge to you, Chairman ENZI, is 
that I will keep at it. Senator BLUNT is 
here, and he is helpful in that regard. 
Senator LANKFORD and Senator PERDUE 
are here, and we have a good team, 
along with Senator KAINE, Senator 
KING, myself, and others on our side— 
another being Senator SHAHEEN. 
So I will continue the work. I vow to 
you that I will somehow find a way to 
get this done, and if I can find a way to 
call it the Enzi reform, I will find a 
way to call it the Enzi reform. 
I will long remember the relationship 
we had and the good work we did to-
gether. I will long remember your 80/20 
rule. And maybe—because I have a 
similar proposal in Rules—maybe we 
will even be able to get your phones 
and electronics amendment passed. 
So thank you to you, sir, for doing 
what is right, doing your best, and 
treating others as they would want to 
be treated. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I feel a 
little guilty, as the chairman of the 
Rules Committee, standing in between 
the Enzi desire to get the devices on 
the floor. 
I have watched in recent weeks. If 
you looked around on the floor, you 
would assume that we had adopted that

rule. It is a pretty hard rule to enforce 
with all the information that Senator 
ENZI always knew was there and need-
ed to be available in ways that we have 
not made it available yet. 
I just want to stand as a particular 
friend of MIKE ENZI. We came to the 
Congress at the same time. I came to 
the House, and he came to the Senate. 
He and Diana and I were together on 
travel fairly early in that we had an 
opportunity to go to Lithuania, as they 
were desperately trying to get included 
in NATO. 
And, MIKE, you remember walking on 
that little square where people had 
their signs up: We want in NATO. They 
had been left behind one time; they 
didn’t want to be left behind another 
time. 
But that is one of the many memo-
ries I have with MIKE. 
Another is just MIKE’s incredible ca-
pacity to listen. I think without ques-
tion and by plenty of evidence, MIKE is 
the best listener in the Senate. In fact, 
he has listening sessions in his State, 
where what he does, shockingly, is lis-
ten. His talking is at a minimum at 
those sessions. His interest in taking in 
input from whoever wants to talk—you 
can envision MIKE at the front of the 
room with his notepad, taking notes on 
what everybody says, and then often 
the move from one speaker to the next 
is ‘‘Thank you’’ and ‘‘Let’s hear what 
other people have to say,’’ and he ab-
sorbs that in a great way. 
There are many times when I have 
come to MIKE in the Senate and said: 
Tell me what you are thinking about 
this. And it is amazing how much you 
can learn by listening. MIKE so often 
has a different view, a more nuanced 
view than others do because of that. 
I also thought, MIKE, as you were 
speaking today—I know that your driv-
er in the State is usually Diana. And 
even describing the return from the 
Jaycees event back to Gillette, I no-
ticed who was driving, that you spent 
so many hours together and miles to-
gether in a State that maybe doesn’t 
have the most people, but it sure has 
lots of distance, and I know it was just 
a challenge to get home to Wyoming 
every week and then to get to the place 
you live in Wyoming, in Gillette, as 
often as you can, and that is not often 
possible. 
But what an honor and privilege to 
serve with you, to spend these 24 years 
in the Congress together, and for me to 
get to spend the last 10 years of your 
Senate time here in the Senate with 
you. It is a great honor. It is a great 
privilege. 
I am trying to learn all I can about 
listening from the master listener who 
then takes all that information and ac-
tually produces, as we have heard here 
today, real results. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I just want 
to thank all the people who came and 
listened, and I hope there were other 
Senators who were watching on their 
televisions and taking notes on the 80- 
percent tool and other things that I 
mentioned. 
But I just appreciate the friendships 
that I have had here. I have no qualms 
about leaving because of the quality of 
people who will still be here, still solv-
ing problems for America. 
There is some great teamwork that 
never gets any publicity but that actu-
ally functions around here, and I can’t 
thank my friends enough, particularly 
Senator BARRASSO, who has been a part 
of this team and has helped to bring me 
along. I have learned a lot from him 
and gotten to do a lot with him, and he 
and his wife are good friends of ours. It 
is not all that common to be good 
friends with the other person in your 
delegation, but we have a strong dele-
gation and get along well that way. 
I want to thank Senator WHITEHOUSE 
for his comments and particularly his 
promise that he is going to get some 
reform done so that the committee is 
actually doing what everybody thinks 
it does—providing a budget that we 
will follow. Those were goods reform 
principles that we put together. 
I have always said that the only time 
we are going to have reform to the 
budget is if we can do it just before a 
Presidential election year because no-
body knows who is going to be in the 
majority in the Senate and the House, 
and nobody knows who is going to be 
the President. Otherwise, we want to 
make sure that we can keep all of the 
control for our party that we can. 
I want to thank Senator BLUNT. I ac-
tually remember trying to get some 
local food and running into Senator 
BLUNT, who was also looking for local 
food overseas, and so we had local food 
together. That was our first year in 
Congress. I have known him for a long 
time, and I appreciate your comments. 
So thank you, everybody. Thank you, 
all the people from Wyoming. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

ALS DISABILITY INSURANCE ACCESS ACT 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I am 
very pleased the Senate has just passed 
the ALS Disability Insurance Access 
Act, 96 to 1, a bill that will bring relief 
to many Americans suffering from a 
terrible disease. 
ALS 
is 
a 
progressive 
neurodegenerative disease. People with 
ALS tragically lose the ability to con-
trol their muscles, leading to paralysis 
and, ultimately, death. There is no 
cure. 
Many are familiar with ALS because 
of the baseball legend who succumbed 
to it at the height of his career, Lou 
Gehrig. Others know Lou Gehrig’s dis-
ease because it has touched them or a 
neighbor or a loved one. 
I have been fortunate to know sev-
eral people with ALS. One of my ear-
liest supporters in my first campaign 
was the great Tommy May of Pine 
Bluff. Tommy, amazingly, has lived 
with ALS for nearly 15 years, beating 
the odds with courage and good humor. 
Given the gift of time, he devoted his 
energy to finding a cure for ALS, serv-
ing as a trustee on the national ALS 
Association board. ALS advocates are 
lucky to have a fighter like Tommy on 
their side. 
I have also been fortunate to know 
Kip Jackson of Little Rock and Thom-
as Galyon of Rogers and others. Sadly, 
these ALS advocates have passed away, 
but I know how pleased they would be 
to see this bill cross the finish line 
today. 
ALS is not like other diseases. It 
typically appears, without warning, 
later in life. Its life expectancy within 
16 months is only 50 percent—no better 
than a coin toss. In other words, ALS 
strikes fast, and it strikes hard. 
People with ALS typically apply for 
disability benefits through Social Se-
curity. There is a problem. Disability 
has a 5-month waiting period. This 
waiting period is meant to ensure that 
applicants aren’t suffering from a tem-
porary affliction, and under most cir-
cumstances, it is appropriate. 
But, of course, ALS isn’t temporary. 
For those who have it, given the odds 
they face, every month counts. That is 
why, years ago, Senator WHITEHOUSE 
and I introduced the ALS Disability In-
surance Access Act, which will waive 
this 5-month period for people with 
ALS. This will ensure they have rapid 
access to Social Security in the early 
days of their diagnosis, so they don’t 
have to worry about benefits and can 
focus instead on the things that really 
matter during what could be their final 
months on Earth. 
On their behalf, I want to thank Sen-
ator WHITEHOUSE for his partnership 
over the years. I want to thank Sen-
ator BRAUN for what he has done to 
help get this bill across the finish line 
today. I am pleased so many of our col-
leagues supported this bill. 
I want to explain briefly my position 
on the amendment offered by Senator 
GRASSLEY. I support the amendment in 
concept, but I opposed the amendment 
today because the original purpose of 
this bill has always been to address 
ALS specifically. 
I will support Senator GRASSLEY’s 
language in future legislation, but to 
pass this bill in the final days of the 
116th Congress, the Senate—and espe-
cially in the days ahead in the House— 
it 
was 
vital 
that 
we 
send 
the 
unamended bill to the House. 
I look forward to working with Sen-
ator GRASSLEY in the next Congress to 
ensure the sustainability of both the 
Social Security Disability and the ALS 
trust fund. He has been a great partner 
in protecting these vital programs, and 
I know he will be in the future. 
Finally, I want to close by quoting 
Lou Gehrig’s final address at Yankee 
Stadium in 1939. He had just received 
his fatal diagnosis. He didn’t focus on 
the hardships that lay in his future. In-
stead, he famously exclaimed: 
I consider myself the luckiest man on the 
face of the Earth. . . . I might have been 
given a bad break, but I have an awful lot to 
live for. 
The same could be said of every per-
son living with ALS today. They have 
an awful lot to live for, and this bill 
will help them live. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
let me thank Senator COTTON for his 
work with me in getting this bill to 
this happy result. 
As the Presiding Officer knows, a bill 
can look like it was easy to get done 
when it passes 96 to 1, but that doesn’t 
mean that the pathway was easy. This 
has been years and years of effort. 
Senator COTTON really helped make 
it possible, so I am very grateful to 
him. 
I also want to thank Senator BRAUN, 
who was the first Republican Member 
to join me in this and who has been a 
constant ally and source of support and 
encouragement. 
I would also like to extend my appre-
ciation to Chairman GRASSLEY of the 
Finance Committee. This is a Finance 
Committee jurisdiction bill. Chairman 
GRASSLEY was willing to let it go for-
ward as long as he got his amend-
ment—without insisting on his amend-
ment being part of the bill. He got his 
vote. We voted it down, and the bill has 
now gone forward, and that reflects a 
very high degree of forbearance and 
courtesy from Chairman GRASSLEY, 
which I respect and appreciate. 
I also want to thank the ranking 
member on Finance, Senator WYDEN,

who has worked very hard to make 
sure that finance issues were resolved 
and that he was comfortable with it. 
He and GRASSLEY were able to give it 
committee clearance to come to the

terms. 
I also want to thank Senator LEE—

We debated it on the Senate floor, and 
he has allowed it to proceed in this way 
also, so I am grateful to Senator LEE. 
Of course, that is all the gratitude 
here within the body for people who 
made the bill possible, but the people 
we really need to be grateful to and ap-
preciative of are the ALS advocates 
who come to us to argue for support 
and for encouragement. They are filled 
with hope even though there is no cure. 
They continue to seek investment in 
the science to try to figure out a way 
to a cure. They show immense courage. 
This is a devastating, uniquely bad 
diagnosis for somebody to get. It is 
very hard for the individual who re-
ceives the diagnosis and also terrible 
for their family as well. 
We have all had the experience in 
this body of seeing our constituents 
come to advocate on ALS and have the 
experience of seeing them the first 
time they come to us with a cane. 
When they come back the next year, 
they come back with a wheelchair and, 
the following year after that, come 
back with an electronic support mecha-
nism with ventilator assistance and are 
still able to steer around, but it is an 
apparatus much more complex than a 
wheelchair. Then, in the next visit, it 
is their widow who comes alone. 
We have had the chance to do some-
thing good here. It made no sense to re-
quire people who have this diagnosis 
wait 5 months before they can begin to 
get Social Security Disability Insur-
ance benefits. Actually, very often, 
that first 5 months is when the support 
makes the most difference in terms of 
the quality of life that remains during 
the course of the illness. 
We have been at this about 5 years 
now. Today is a good day in that sense. 
I want to call to mind, just as an ex-
ample of how this strikes at home—our 
small, local, home State paper, the 
Providence Journal, has a long tradi-
tion of being a very distinguished 
newspaper. Very often people who 
worked for it went on to the Wall 
Street Journal, the New York Times, 
the Washington Post, and big and fa-
mous newspapers and made national 
names for themselves. The Providence 
Journal is a really significant news-
paper. Just in the course of my time in 
politics, two of its writers have been 
stricken with ALS—struck down, in 
fact, with ALS: Brian Dickinson, first, 
and Bill Malinowski afterward. Each 
had to learn to write in very unusual 
ways, including with their eyeballs by 
blinking as letters went by on a screen 
or by directing a laser. 
It is a terrible disease, ALS. But one 
thing that it does is it displays the ex-
traordinary human character of people 
who fight on through this increasingly 
disabling condition. The courage that 
they show and the way that they per-
sist—in this case, to keep writing— 
Brian Dickinson was writing columns 
really until the end of his life—stand as 
an example to all of us of what courage 
in impossible circumstances looks like. 
That is a blessing they give to all of us. 
With many thanks and much appre-
ciation to J.R. Pagliarini, the presi-
dent of Rhode Island ALS society, and 
his 
president 
emeritus, 
Kenneth 
McGunagle, and to their executive di-
rector, Beth Flanagan, I am happy to 
get this done. 
Now we hope that in the final days of 
this Congress, our friends over in the 
House—with 300-plus cosponsors on the 
bill in the House—ought to be able to 
get out of each other’s way and get this 
done before this Congress concludes. 
I yield the floor to my friend and col-
league Senator BRAUN with great ap-
preciation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, today I 
rise in proud support of legislation that 
will break down barriers for those with 
medically determined ALS. 
ALS 
is 
a 
progressive 
and 
fatal 
neurodegenerative disease that affects 
the motor nerve cells in the brain and 
spinal cord, gradually robbing patients 
of the ability to eat, speak, and eventu-
ally breathe. 
Currently, there are no meaningful 
treatments, no known cause, and no 
cure. But today, we have reason to 
hope. 
Since 2016, Senators WHITEHOUSE and 
COTTON have championed the ALS Dis-
ability Insurance Access Act. Thanks 
to their tireless efforts, we are about to 
give ALS patients and their families 
more timely access to their Social Se-
curity disability benefits. No longer 
will these patients have to wait 5 
months to access benefits they have 
earned. 
Passing this act will help alleviate 
some of the financial burdens that ac-
company an ALS diagnosis and will 
allow patients and their families to 
focus their precious time where it 
needs to be—on their loved ones and 
their battle against the disease. 
ALS is not a rare disease. More than 
5,600 individuals in the United States 
are diagnosed each year, meaning 15 
Americans are diagnosed each day. Not 
only is ALS common, it is also ex-
tremely personal to many in this 
Chamber, and it is personal to me. 
My cousin Anne Seitz lost her battle 
with ALS on Thanksgiving Day 10 
years ago. Her husband Terry Seitz 
currently resides in my hometown and 
is my State director of outreach. 
My budget and appropriations staff-
er, Robert Ordway, and his sister Jen-
nifer lost their father, Douglas Ray-
mond Ordway, to the disease. 
Kathy Laesch, a member of my Indi-
anapolis team, has a son Brian who was 
diagnosed with ALS this summer. 
Brian, who also lost his father, has for-
tunately been enrolled in a clinical 
trial. We are all praying for his treat-
ments to be effective. In the network of 
people I have come to know back home 
and here in the Senate, it shows you 
just how many lives are affected by it, 
and there are countless patients it has 
affected in the Hoosier State. 
I would like to personally thank Tina 
Kaetzel, the executive director of the 
Indiana ALS Association, for bringing 
this bill to the attention of our office. 
I would also like to give a heartfelt 
thank 
you 
to 
Corey 
Polen, 
of 
Brownsburg, IN, for his passionate and 
unwavering advocacy in support of the 
bill. Corey has become a friend to our 
office and has also been a champion of 
legislation I introduced, the Promising 
Pathway Act, which would provide new 
FDA authority to more rapidly approve 
drugs specifically for diseases like this. 
I would be remiss if I did not thank I 
AM ALS, especially Brian Wallach, 
Danielle Carnival, and Dan Tate, for 
their unyielding devotion to this and 
to fixing our broken healthcare sys-
tem. 
Today, we come one step closer to ac-
complishing this pursuit. It has been a 
great honor to cofound the first-ever 
Senate ALS Caucus with my colleague 
across the aisle, Senator CHRIS COONS, 
of Delaware. The passage of the ALS 
Disability Insurance Access Act has 
been a priority for this caucus since its 
inception about a year ago. We readily 
acknowledge that the bill’s passage is 
long overdue and that there is much 
more work to be done. We look forward 
to rolling up our sleeves and coming 
together to advance policies in the fu-
ture that will continue to improve the 
quality of life for ALS patients. 
In doing so, we celebrate ALS pa-
tients—those we have lost, those who 
are currently fighting this dreadful dis-
ease, and those whose journeys have 
not yet begun. It is a disease that does 
not have the luxury of a large commu-
nity from which to raise awareness and 
fight for reforms. ALS has no survivor 
community. It is up to us, then, to 
speak up for those who can no longer 
speak and to stand up for those who 
can no longer stand. 
To those whom we have lost to ALS 
and to those currently battling this 
disease—Anne Seitz, Douglas Raymond 
Ordway, Brian Laesch, Corey Polen, 
Brian Wallach, Dan Tate, and so many 
others impacted by ALS—we here in 
the U.S. Senate are your advocates. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
today is my 276th climate speech, and 
my increasingly battered graphic is 
showing its wear, but for the first time 
in a really, really long time, there is 
real hope for climate action in Amer-
ica. 
The light of science will shine in a 
Biden administration. Our U.S. Gov-
ernment will heed actual data. Agen-
cies will act on facts. The White House

will care about the harm carbon pollu-
tion does right now across the country. 
President Biden will restore the EPA 
to its role of safeguarding our air and 
water and will task the State Depart-
ment to surge climate policy abroad. 
Every 
Department—from 
Transpor-
tation to the USDA, to HUD, to the 
SEC—will have a role in turning this 
ship around before catastrophe. 
At last, the Biden administration 
will cleanse America’s government of 
its grimy infestation of polluter lack-
eys, stooges, and hangers-on and will 
shut off the disastrous handouts to fos-
sil fuel industry donors. A flood of 
cleansing executive actions will wash 
away the grime. The American Presi-
dency, with its great power, will shake 
free of the polluters’ grip, but the Pres-
idency alone cannot spare us. 
Congress must pass a comprehensive 
climate bill, stop rewarding polluters 
from polluting, and clean up our en-
ergy market so it is not corrupted by 
or for the fossil fuel industry—for in-
stance, putting a real price on carbon 
to pay for the fossil fuel damage. We 
have to invest in new, green infrastruc-
ture to create millions of jobs. We need 
to prepare communities along our 
coasts for rising seas, others for higher 
temperatures, and other climate dan-
gers. We need to address the dangerous 
systemic financial risks fossil fuel pre-
sents to our economic system. There is 
work to be done, and it is overdue. 
So what has been stopping us? 
Four years ago, Senate Democrats 
came to the Senate floor and here ex-
posed this web of denial and obstruc-
tion that had been built by the fossil 
fuel industry to prevent meaningful ac-
tion on climate change. This evil web 
is a front for billionaire polluters like 
the Kochs and fossil fuel pushers like 
ExxonMobil and Marathon Petroleum. 
To hide its funders, this web uses 
creepy identity-scrubbing groups like 
Donors Trust and Donors Capital. They 
move money and people around in the 
web in a Whac-A-Mole array of dispos-
able groups with misleadingly whole-
some names like the Heartland Insti-
tute and the Franklin Center for Gov-
ernment and Public Integrity. Ben-
jamin Franklin would vomit at this 
abuse of his name. 
Following Big Tobacco’s playbook, 
this web of denial kept the polluters’ 
fingerprints off the dirty work of sow-
ing doubt about climate science, just 
as the tobacco industry fraudulently 
stood up front groups to dispense de-
nial of the harms of tobacco. This pol-
luter web of denial also kept the Re-
publican Party in line by spending 
stunning amounts of money in Amer-
ican politics. 
Dr. Robert Brulle, now at Brown Uni-
versity, created this graphic off of his 
research, and it gives you a sense of 
how big and how complex this web of 
denial is that the fossil fuel industry 
stood up, and it is funded by huge 
amounts of dark money by anonymous 
funders. 
When we exposed this web back in 
2016, fossil fuel giants like ExxonMobil 
said it was out of the climate denial 
and 
obstruction 
business. 
Exxon 
claimed it had not funded the Heart-
land Institutes of the world for a dec-
ade. Fossil fuel executives said they 
knew climate change was a threat, and 
they claimed to have turned the page 
on this nonsense. 
Well, that just ain’t so. The network 
of phony front groups, identity-laun-
dering outfits, and bogus PR cam-
paigns is alive and well. Like any 
threatened 
crooked 
enterprise, 
it 
morphs to hide in its surroundings, but 
we just caught another glimpse of it 
through a New York Times expose of 
the corporate PR firm FTI Consulting. 
FTI started 40 years ago as a hired gun 
for parties in litigation and now offers 
virtually any nasty service a corpora-
tion could need. According to the 
Times, the fossil fuel industry employs 
FTI for a lot of dirty work. 
One thing FTI does is to stand up 
fake front groups. The New York Times 
chronicles how organizations like Citi-
zens to Protect PA Jobs, New Mexicans 
for Economic Prosperity, and the Lib-
erty Energy Project actually all trace 
back to FTI through common employ-
ees, internet domain registrations, and 
other ties. Each of these pop-up groups 
suggests that it is a broad coalition of 
regular 
Americans. 
Each 
sports 
a 
flashy website, like this one, with 
neighborly looking folk in scenic vis-
tas, and, of course, they all make the 
fossil fuel case for cutting corporate 
taxes and slashing environmental pro-
tections. We call these fake environ-
mental 
grassroots 
groups 
‘‘Astroturf’’—a product manufactured 
by big, powerful special interests to 
look like grassroots support. 
This one is a classic—Texans for Nat-
ural Gas. The Times writes about this 
outfit: 
Acting as Texans for Natural Gas rep-
resentatives, FTI employees have launched 
pro-industry petitions, produced videos and 
reports on the importance of the Permian 
Basin oil field, and written opinion pieces for 
local newspapers supporting fossil fuels. The 
site 
features 
testimonials 
from 
three 
women— 
I am quoting still— 
two of whom are represented with stock 
photos— 
Let me interrupt the quote for a 
minute because you know you can go 
to the internet and find stock photos of 
people you can use. So these aren’t real 
testimonials. 
These 
are 
fake 
FTI 
testimonials with stock photos to 
make it look like it is credible. OK, I 
will go back to the quote: 
and one with a photo used without permis-
sion from the Flickr page of a photographer 
in the Philippines. 
Classy, huh? This bag of polluter 
tricks is pretty familiar to those who 
have studied the web of denial here, 
but FTI is also pulling some new 
tricks. 
One new target is fossil fuel’s own in-
vestors. A new challenge for oil and gas 
companies is their own shareholders— 
even their biggest institutional inves-
tors—calling on them to identify and 
address climate risks. For instance, 
last spring, BlackRock, the largest in-
stitutional investor in the world, voted 
at a shareholder meeting to remove 
two Exxon directors and install an 
independent Exxon chairman, all to 
improve this oil giant’s ‘‘insufficient 
progress’’ in addressing its business 
risk from climate change. That kind of 
warning shot sends shivers down the 
spine of a big polluter. 
So there is FTI, which popped up a 
group in 2018 called Main Street Inves-
tors, which commissioned studies argu-
ing that activist shareholders harm 
shareholder value, and it launched a 
website, divestmentfacts.com, to argue 
against big university endowments, 
pension funds, and other big investors 
divesting from fossil fuels. The Times 
notes about this scheme: ‘‘At least six 
academic papers published on this 
website were by professors who, in ad-
dition to their university jobs, were 
also working for Compass Lexecon, [an] 
FTI subsidiary.’’ 
Neat trick using shareholder money 
to fool shareholders. 
Who paid FTI to set up Main Street 
Investors? The National Association of 
Manufacturers, which the watchdog 
group Influence Map has called the 
worst climate obstructor in America. 
So it is no surprise that they are pay-
ing for this phony nonsense. The ques-
tion is, Who paid the National Associa-
tion of Manufacturers to set this up? 
They won’t say. So we have to take a 
guess. 
There is more that FTI is up to. 
Don’t like your news coverage? FTI 
can build you your own news site. The 
Times found FTI lurking behind En-
ergy In Depth and Western Wire—two 
sites that churn out pro-fossil fuel arti-
cles and spread them around the inter-
net. With mass extinction of real local 
newspapers underway, FTI is busy set-
ting up polluter news pages to fill the 
void. It is clever, if repulsive. 
Of course, FTI does dirty work on so-
cial media. After New York City filed a 
climate lawsuit against Exxon, FTI 
launched a social media attack on New 
York Mayor Bill de Blasio. In a panto-
mime twofer, FTI used content from 
its phony Energy In Depth news site in 
its paid-for social media attack. Who 
paid? They won’t say. Take a guess. 
Another FTI campaign bought social 
media ads to steer people to another 
FTI front group, the Arctic Energy 
Center, which promotes—guess what— 
drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge and off the Alaskan coast. 
In yet another campaign, FTI’s shad-
owy special strategic communications 
unit set up a phony Facebook profile to 
secretly 
track 
environmental 
pro-
testers. It did this for Apache Energy, 
which wanted to drill for fossil fuel 
next to a State park in Texas. See the 
pattern? 
But wait. It gets even creepier than 
this, if you can believe it. FTI has a 
menu that it offers to its clients of 
fake personas.

These fake personas use fake social 
media and message board accounts to 
interfere in internet debate—say by 
harassing local citizens who are con-
cerned about pollution and who may be 
criticizing FTI’s clients, so they will 
bomb into the internet debate around 
that, offering fake personas as the 
phony voice to disrupt that debate. 
This is actually their menu. You 
have what they call ‘‘the Derailleur.’’ 
‘‘The Derailleur seizes on a seemingly 
innocuous section of the otherwise neg-
ative narrative and attempts to pull 
the comment thread into a discursive 
discussion around that detailed non- 
issue.’’ 
They offer next the ‘‘Drunken Con-
spiracy Theorist Uncle.’’ ‘‘The Drunk-
en Conspiracy Theorist Uncle agrees 
with 
the 
negative 
commenter 
but 
conflates other unrelated and offensive 
issues into it, lumping it all together 
into an unpalatable whole.’’ 
They also offer the ‘‘Semantic Nit-
picker,’’ who ‘‘asks an endless series of 
questions 
seeking 
clarification 
or 
pointing out minor flaws in the way 
the argument is constructed. This can 
be 
played 
both 
friendly 
and 
oppositionally, but by different stacks 
of kids.’’ 
On it goes through the ‘‘Skeptical 
Capitalist,’’ the ‘‘Patronizing Voice of 
Reason,’’ the ‘‘Confused Time Trav-
eler,’’ the ‘‘Concerned Hipster,’’ and be-
lieve it or not, here is a real beauty— 
the ‘‘Dog Typing on a Keyboard.’’ You 
can pay FTI to send somebody real be-
hind a fake persona to go interfere 
anonymously in somebody else’s con-
versation—in this case, claiming a dog 
typing on a keyboard. ‘‘The dog typing 
on a keyboard chimes in with very poor 
grammar, spelling, and punctuation, 
and posts frequently to clutter up the 
thread and make it very hard to 
read’’—basically packing the debate 
with so much nonsense that everybody 
has to tune out. 
These are actually services offered to 
the fossil fuel industry clients that 
they pay for. They pay to disrupt le-
gitimate internet debate using phony, 
paid-for personas that come in occu-
pying these characteristics, I guess you 
would call them. It is unbelievably dis-
gusting behavior for any corporation to 
engage in, which is probably why they 
hide the money. 
You may ask, why? Why on Earth 
would fossil fuel companies spend big 
money on all this fancy, fake activ-
ity—from phony Astroturf groups to 
fake attack campaigns, to the dog typ-
ing on the keyboard? Why would the 
fossil fuel industry go through all these 
complex, phony schemes? Won’t they 
ultimately get caught? 
Well, the answer is simple, and it is a 
number—$650 billion. Six hundred and 
fifty billion dollars is the subsidy for 
fossil fuel in the United States of 
America every year. Every year, $650 
billion. Another year, another $650 bil-
lion, according to the International 
Monetary Fund, which is kind of a 
technical bean counter organization 
that is not an environmental group by 
any stretch. 
So let’s say you are getting that $650 
billion subsidy every year. Even if all 
this fakery ends up exposed, if in the 
meantime you have disrupted the oppo-
sition and kept your business scheme 
going, you have reaped another year of 
multi-hundred-billion-dollar subsidies. 
I mention in this web of denial the 
identity-laundering group called Do-
nors Trust, and I will come back to 
them right now because I have called 
them out over and over. 
Donors Trust just put a letter to the 
editor into my home State newspaper 
to assure its readers that Donors Trust 
is just as pure as the driven snow. Of 
all the newspapers in the world, Donors 
Trust just happened to pick mine. I ap-
preciate the attention. But let’s get 
the facts straight because here is Do-
nors Trust, right in the middle of the 
web of denial. It has been called ‘‘the 
dark-money ATM of the right,’’ behind 
‘‘the right’s assault on labor unions, 
climate scientists, public schools, [and] 
economic regulations.’’ It has been 
called 
‘‘the 
Right’s 
favorite 
dark- 
money conduit, [which] allows the 
identities of wealthy conservative do-
nors to stay hidden.’’ It has been called 
‘‘Donors Trust, the Right-Wing Secret 
Money Machine.’’ And it is smack in 
the middle of this dirty, dark fossil fuel 
web that has propagated and funded 
the lie—the lie of climate denial. 
From FTI and all of its schemes and 
its typing dogs to Donors Trust, the 
sleaze and the scale of the fossil fuel 
scheming is itself a signal of the mis-
chief afoot. You don’t put up a phony- 
baloney operation of this magnitude 
unless you have some real nasty stuff 
that you are trying to defend and mis-
lead people about. Well, for $650 billion 
a year, you can crank up a lot of sleazy 
mischief. 
Here in Congress, we can’t keep danc-
ing to the tune of this crowd. We still 
don’t know which party will control 
this Chamber next year, but we do 
know that the Senate is out of excuses 
on climate change. It is time for a 
strong climate bill that can be signed 
into law by a new President, swept into 
office with the most votes in history on 
a strong commitment to climate ac-
tion. 
It is on us. It is on us whether this 
web of denial will hold us back or 
whether we will break free at last of its 
corrupting influence and do, for once— 
for once—our duty instead of its bid-
ding. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I always 
appreciate the persistence and integ-
rity and intellectual vigor of Senator 
WHITEHOUSE’s comments on the floor 
talking about climate and talking 
about the corruption of big money and 
climate politics and climate decision 
making. 
So to Senator WHITEHOUSE, thank 
you. 
REMEMBERING LARRY WILLIS 
Mr. President, this weekend we lost a 
great champion for American work-
ers—Larry Willis, president of the 
Transportation Trades Department at 
the AFL–CIO. 
Larry dedicated his life to the labor 
movement, fighting for workers on the 
frontlines of our transportation sys-
tem. He worked to empower busdrivers 
and ramp workers, flight attendants 
and train operators around the country 
so they could fight for better wages 
and protections on the job and they 
could build a middle-class life for their 
families. 
We know the labor movement is the 
single biggest reason that we have a 
middle class in this country. We know 
that the decline of the labor union 
movement is the reason that the mid-
dle class is shrinking in this country. 
All of what Larry did said a lot about 
his character—that he took on that job 
and spent his whole career fighting to 
give power to the workers who have so 
often been denied a voice in this coun-
try. 
Everyone who worked with him at-
tests to his skill, his compassion, his 
commitment to justice, and his love of 
life. One of his greatest strengths was 
his ability to find compromise in even 
the most difficult, thorniest issues in 
front of us. 
Make no mistake, Larry was always 
a fierce fighter for transportation 
workers. He never compromised when 
defending worker safety. He always 
challenged us to make legislation bet-
ter, but he also understood that mean-
ingful change sometimes comes in 
smaller steps, not in great bounds. He 
was willing to work for months, even 
years, behind the scenes to make real 
progress for transportation workers. 
Washington needs more advocates like 
Larry—someone who believes deeply in 
the cause and backs it up with relent-
less work to find a solution. 
I want to talk about his grace. He 
was very direct. He didn’t hold back 
when Congress did something that was 
not in the best interests of workers, 
but he never closed the door on anyone, 
even his adversaries. Larry was always 
willing to pick back up a conversation 
to find a path forward. He did not let 
egos get in the way of progress—some-
thing that happens far too often in this 
town. He never let disputes make him 
jaded. He always kept his head up and 
his door open. 
My staff and I relied on Larry’s guid-
ance and wisdom for many years. He 
knew every angle of our Nation’s trans-
portation system. He used that knowl-
edge to help millions of transportation 
workers. He was a wonderful person. 
We loved working with him. 
We are deeply saddened by his pass-
ing. We are keeping his wife Amy and 
daughter Samantha—oh, how he loved 
both of them and lit up when talking 
about them—we are keeping them in 
our thoughts and prayers as they cope 
with this sudden, heartbreaking loss. 
We will honor Larry Willis the best 
way we can—by continuing to fight to

WORKER SAFETY 
Mr. President, this spring I was talk-
ing with a grocery store worker in 
Southwest Ohio, who told me: You 
know, they call me essential, but real-
ly I feel expendable. 
That grocery store worker and thou-
sands of others are on the frontlines of 
this pandemic. They risk their lives so 
that Americans can keep food on their 
tables and get their packages deliv-
ered. They are changing linens in hos-
pitals. They drive buses. They stock 
shelves in supermarkets and drug-
stores. Then workers go home at night. 
They worry they are going to bring to 
their home the virus and infect their 
family—always the anxiety they live 
with. 
We know that hundreds of thousands 
of workers have been exposed to the 
virus on the job. Thousands have died. 
We don’t know exactly how many be-
cause the President hasn’t directed his 
government to make it a priority to 
keep track of these numbers. Think of 
that. 
We know UFCW—United Food Com-
mercial Workers—reports that more 
than 16,000 grocery store workers have 
been exposed at work. More than 100 
have died. Sixteen-thousand exposed at 
work. More than 100 have died. 
National Nurses United has recorded 
at least 1,700 deaths, and 58 percent of 
those healthcare workers who died 
were people of color. Seventeen hun-
dred have died; 58 percent, people of 
color. 
In meatpacking plants, we know the 
toll has been horrific. As of this sum-
mer, 16,000 workers in meatpacking 
plants, including in the Dakotas, the 
vast majority of them Black and 
Brown workers, and more than 230 have 
died. We can only expect those num-
bers to be higher. 
What is the President’s response? In 
the White House, they are putting up 
holiday displays with a lit-up ceramic 
post office and ornaments in the shape 
of garbage trucks and nurses’ hats. 
That is right. Workers are dying 
around the country, and instead of 
doing anything at all to protect them, 
the President of the United States is 
decking the halls with ornaments. 
Workers don’t need Christmas orna-
ments; they need fair pay, and they 
need protections on the job. 
President Trump hasn’t lifted a fin-
ger to protect frontline workers. Let 
me explain. I make a charge like that, 
I back it up. He spent 4 years in office 
putting corporate lawyers in charge of 
the Department of Labor. The Sec-
retary of Labor made millions of dol-
lars practicing law by representing cor-
porations against workers—sometimes 
union workers, sometimes unorganized 
workers. 
The Department of Labor makes it 
easier for corporations to skirt safety 
rules. The point of the Department of 
Labor, the point of the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration, is 
to protect workers. Yet this Secretary 
of Labor, this Department of Labor— 
including from IBEW workers to steel-
workers, to meatpacking workers—he 
refused to issue workplace safety re-
quirements throughout the pandemic. 
He failed to get workers the protective 
equipment and medical supplies they 
need to protect themselves. He forced 
people back to work in meatpacking 
plants around the country. 
In South Dakota, we know, in a 
meatpacking plant owned by the Chi-
nese Communist Party, 1,300 workers 
got sick in one plant, and 4 of them 
have died that we know of. 
The Trump administration fined this 
multibillion-dollar meatpacking—Chi-
nese 
Communist 
Party-owned 
meatpacking plant—fined them $10 a 
worker. Thirteen hundred workers got 
sick and OSHA, the government, the 
President, fined them $10 a worker. But 
don’t worry, he and his wealthy con-
tributors who come for White House 
tours 
without 
masks 
or 
social 
distancing will get to look at some 
sparkly ornaments. 
President Trump could crack down 
on corporations like Smithfield. He 
could mobilize American manufactur-
ers to get every American worker the 
masks and the protective equipment 
they need. He could issue an OSHA 
temporary standard, as we have asked 
him repeatedly, that would provide 
clear 
enforceable 
requirements 
for 
keeping workers safe. He could stand 
up for workers, but he won’t. 
That is fundamentally why he lost. 
Eighty million Americans decisively 
rejected this President and his total 
lack of empathy, his complete failure 
to understand the dignity of work. 
There are a lot of Senators in this 
body—not a lot. There are some Sen-
ators in this body whose mothers or fa-
thers carried union cards and knew 
that was their ticket to the middle 
class and understood that their moth-
ers and fathers were protected by 
OSHA, protected by the Department of 
Labor that cared about the safety of 
those workers in the workplace. 
But all that the President did do to 
ignore workers and didn’t do to protect 
workers, none of that is stopping him 
from trying to do more damage on his 
way out the door. The Trump USDA, 
the Department of Agriculture, is try-
ing to race through a new rule—trying 
to push through, in the last weeks, a 
new rule that actually speeds up chick-
en factory processing lines; that is 
right, not slow them down in the face 
of record infections at these plants but 
speed up the line. 
We know it is a trick. It is the oldest 
trick in the book. You make more 
money if you speed up the line. You 
speed up the line, and workers are 
more likely to get hurt. When you 
speed up the line during a pandemic, 
more workers are likely to get sick. 
They tried to pass the rule earlier. It 
was held up over concerns workers 
would get hurt and salmonella would 
spread. That is not even counting 
COVID. But to President Trump and 
his allies, more workplace injuries and 
more grandparents hospitalized by sal-
monella are a small price to pay if it 
means more profits for meatpacking 
companies. 
Trump and his corporate lawyer Sec-
retary of Labor are pushing through a 
new policy to ensure that companies 
can continue to exploit workers by 
classifying them as independent con-
tractors. Go back to the childhood of a 
number of Members of the Senate who 
had parents who worked in factories 
and parents who worked in construc-
tion jobs, parents who carried a union 
card. You know what that would mean 
to those workers and the threat that 
they could get sick. 
Think about it now. Corporations 
love this new business model. It is a 
way to classify people as independent 
workers. It is a way to pay people less 
for the same work, skirt labor laws, 
wash their hands of responsibility for 
the workers who make their businesses 
successful. 
These workers aren’t working for a 
big insurance company that really does 
have a public image they are trying to 
protect. These workers aren’t working 
for a hospital or a big bank that cares 
about its public image. These workers 
are working for an entity hired by 
these big banks or by these insurance 
companies to prepare the food or to 
provide the security or to do the custo-
dial work—a company you have never 
heard of that has no public image be-
cause this company is all about being 
hired by large corporations. They then 
can pay them lower wages. They can 
then protect them less on the job, and 
they can then not provide benefits. 
That is what happens with contract 
workers—those independent contrac-
tors. We know they love this business 
model. They can pay workers less. 
They can skirt labor laws. 
President Trump wants to make that 
easier, partly, because he probably does 
that in his business, and he has a whole 
lot of corporate friends—big contribu-
tors to the Trump campaign who make 
more money by doing that. 
Fundamentally, 
President 
Trump, 
Senator MCCONNELL, and their cor-
porate allies just don’t understand the 
dignity of work. They think workers 
are always a cost to be minimized in-
stead of the engine behind our coun-
try’s success. 
Think back again to those Members 
of the Senate whose parents carried 
union cards who cared about all this, 
who had a chance—in a job like this, 
who had a chance for opportunity be-
cause those workers carried a union 
card and were treated decently on the 
job. Because those workers carried a 
union card, their bosses couldn’t think 
of them only as a cost to be minimized. 
They did think of them as the engine 
behind their country’s success. 
The American people rejected that— 
the 80-plus million people who voted

for 
a 
new 
President. 
They 
voted 
against the President who treated 
workers as expendable. They voted for 
the candidate who put workers at the 
center of his campaign. 
Joe Biden had the most pro-worker 
campaign in a generation, and in Janu-
ary we get to work to deliver results. 
The new President, right now, on Janu-
ary 20 can immediately issue an OSHA 
emergency temporary standard forcing 
corporations to take important, crit-
ical, decisive steps to protect their 
workers from contracting or spreading 
the virus in their workplaces. 
What is more important than pro-
tecting workers, especially essential 
workers who deliver our food, who pre-
pare food, who do custodial work, who 
do security work, who are helping peo-
ple in our country live every day? 
With cases rising and hospitals filling 
up all over the country, the end of Jan-
uary isn’t soon enough. Workers put 
themselves at risk in nursing homes 
and hospitals. They deliver packages of 
holiday gifts. They stock supermarket 
shelves with supplies for holiday meals. 
Some of those workers are going to 
get sick. Some of them are going to 
die. They are going to die because they 
are essential workers, but we don’t 
treat them like essential workers. We 
can do something about it now. We 
could pass a real plan that invests in 
protective equipment for them. We can 
pass a real plan of testing and contact 
tracing. We could get money to small 
businesses like Liz Valenti’s business 
in Dayton, OH, so they can protect 
their workers—her two restaurants in 
Dayton. 
Well, what is Leader MCCONNELL 
doing? Ramming through more Trump 
nominees like Mr. Hauptman and Mr. 
Waller, who keep stacking the deck in 
favor of their Wall Street friends, try-
ing to hold on to their power even after 
Americans said: No, we want some-
thing different—80 million of them. 
MITCH MCCONNELL needs to stop let-
ting Donald Trump sabotage our eco-
nomic recovery on his way out the door 
and get to work for the people he 
serves. 
It is time to remember what makes 
this country great. If you love this 
country, you fight for people who make 
it work—our workers who organized in 
union halls and church basements and 
fought for workers’ rights, women’s 
rights, and civil rights. 
In closing—I know that Senator LEE 
wants to speak. I have worn for my 
time in the Senate and before that, I 
wore this pin on my lapel. It is a depic-
tion of a canary in a birdcage. You may 
remember the old labor story of the 
worker, the coal miner who took the 
canary down into the mines. If the ca-
nary died by suffocation or lack of oxy-
gen or some contaminant in the air, 
the mine worker got out of the mines. 
He had no union in those days to pro-
tect himself, and he had no government 
that cared enough, that was strong 
enough to protect him, and he had no 
government that cared enough to pro-
tect him. He was essentially on his 
own. 
This pin was given to me at a work-
ers’ Memorial Day rally by a steel-
worker who told me about this pin and 
what it stood for. He knows that the 
labor movement changed this country 
for the better. It created the greatest 
economy and the strongest middle 
class on Earth. It said the opposite of 
what MITCH MCCONNELL says to work-
ers all over the country: Sorry. You are 
on your own. What this canary pin rep-
resents is, we are all in this together. 
It means we fight for the dignity of 
work. It means if you love your coun-
try, you fight for the people who make 
it work. We can do that again. We can 
protect workers from this virus. We 
can build a better system centered on 
the dignity of work. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
ALS DISABILITY INSURANCE ACCESS ACT OF 2019 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is nothing 
short of a tragedy when anyone suffers 
from 
ALS. 
This 
is 
a 
progressive 
neurodegenerative disease, one that at-
tacks the nerve cells in the brain and 
the spinal cord of its victims and even-
tually affects control of the muscles, 
even the muscles that are needed to 
move, to speak, eat, breathe, and oth-
erwise live. 
Sadly, this is a disease that is always 
fatal. The average life expectancy is 
only 2 to 5 years following diagnosis. 
Not only are the people who suffer 
from ALS robbed of time but also their 
ability to work, imposing great hard-
ships on them and on their families. 
The bill that we had before us today 
to help these victims by reforming our 
Social Security Disability Insurance 
Program is a good cause, and it is one 
that I think we all support, but I think 
it goes about the job in the wrong way. 
It sets bad precedent, and it fails to in-
clude other needed reform. 
We must remember that ALS, Lou 
Gehrig’s disease, is one of many simi-
larly debilitating and deadly diseases 
that Americans are suffering from 
today. While not as well known, all of 
these victims are also deserving of the 
same kind of special attention and ac-
commodation in Federal policy. 
Let’s review some of the background 
of the program. The Social Security 
Disability Insurance Program, or SSDI, 
was created, in part, to help people who 
suffer from conditions like ALS, pro-
viding monthly cash benefits to those 
who become disabled and therefore un-
able to work. 
One challenge with a program like 
this is that the agency administering 
the program, that is, the Social Secu-
rity Administration, has to verify an 
applicant’s eligibility for benefits be-
fore they can start sending out the 
checks. Today, eligibility determina-
tion takes an average of 31⁄2 months. 
For some people and for some diseases, 
including ALS, 31⁄2 months can be a 
dangerously long time. 
So, in 2018, the SSA established a 
new policy to fast track the applica-
tion process for those with serious and 
urgent medical conditions. Under this 
Compassionate Allowance Initiative, 
more than 200 diseases now automati-
cally make applicants eligible for expe-
dited review. 
But while the Compassionate Allow-
ance Initiative shortens the determina-
tion process from an average of several 
months to an average of 39 days, there 
is still a lengthy 5-month waiting pe-
riod to actually start receiving the 
benefits, and in the case of urgent, 
fatal diseases, that is still too long of a 
wait. 
The bill that we have before us today 
seeks to address this problem but only 
for the victims of ALS. Now, obviously, 
we should try and help the victims of 
this tragic disease to the very best of 
our ability. They are not, however, the 
only ones who need to be helped. Of the 
list of compassionate allowance condi-
tions, some are just as urgent as ALS 
and some are even worse. There are, 
sadly, several for which there is no 
known 
cure 
and 
that 
have 
life 
expectancies that are terribly short. 
I want to cite some examples. For in-
stance, Creutfeldt-Jakob disease, a de-
generative brain disorder, is among 
these. This particular disease leads to 
dementia and most often results in 
death within 6 to 12 months. Trag-
ically, there is no cure, and around 
1,000 Americans are diagnosed with it 
every single year, including a dear 
friend of mine in Utah who a couple of 
years ago passed away from this ail-
ment. 
Another is cardiac amyloidosis, also 
known as stiff heart syndrome. This 
disease affects the way electrical sig-
nals move through the heart, leading 
to abnormal heartbeats and faulty 
heart signals. For those diagnosed, 
there is no known cure, and they typi-
cally face a life expectancy of only 
about 6 months after the onset of con-
gestive heart failure. About 4,000 peo-
ple develop this condition each year. 
Take peritoneal mesothelioma, this 
disease is a cancer that develops in the 
lining of the abdomen, usually leading 
to death within 12 months of the first 
signs of illness. Around 600 cases are di-
agnosed every year in the United 
States. 
That is why I have been working for 
the past year with my colleagues to 
broaden the scope of this legislation, so 
that Congress doesn’t waive the SSDI 
waiting period one disease at a time. It 
should not matter which fatal, rapidly 
progressing and debilitating disease an 
American is suffering from—all fatal 
diseases with no known cure should 
have access to disability benefits after 
their Social Security Administration 
determination. 
The men and women who suffer from 
those conditions and the family mem-
bers affected by their ailments have 
precious little time left, and they are 
just as worthy of help. They are cer-
tainly no less worthy of help than 
those with ALS. There is always hope 
that a cure can be found for them or

that, at the very least, a new treat-
ment can further extend the life of 
these men and women. Rather than re-
moving the waiting period for those 
with one specific disease, we should re-
move the waiting period for those who 
suffer from any of a small select group 
of conditions that have no cure and 
have the shortest life expectancies. 
There is no reason we cannot help 
those who suffer from ALS and these 
other conditions. We can walk and 
chew gum at the same time. We can 
protect victims of ALS and these other 
conditions as well. 
The bill, as written, sets the stage for 
only those diseases that have the most 
recognition and, to put it bluntly, the 
most fundraising backing to fund bill 
sponsors, and it would set at a dis-
advantage the conditions that are far 
more rare and underfunded. Who will 
be the voice for the men and women 
who suffer from those diseases? Who 
will fight for them? Adding similarly 
cruel maladies to this list takes noth-
ing away from ALS, and it can make 
all the difference in the world for 
Americans suffering from similar dis-
abilities. 
I had hoped to offer my broader ap-
proach as an amendment, but after 
months and months of working with 
the Social Security Administration 
and with the Congressional Budget Of-
fice, I was, unfortunately, given incom-
plete information at the time an agree-
ment was reached on scheduling a vote 
on this bill. I appreciate Senator COT-
TON’s and Senator BRAUN’s patience in 
allowing me to work towards a fix 
while they remain committed to ad-
vancing their legislation, for which I 
commend them. 
Additionally, while I would have 
hoped that my work with the Social 
Security Administration and the Con-
gressional Budget Office could have 
gone more quickly, I do appreciate 
their efforts to address my questions 
and compile the necessary information 
and tools to estimate my amendment’s 
fiscal impact. 
While I was pleased to see Senator 
GRASSLEY’s amendment, which at least 
would have paid for the removal of the 
waiting period for ALS, I will continue 
to work on legislation that will remove 
the waiting period for diseases that 
meet a set of criteria—no known cure 
with a life expectancy of less than 5 
years—while not further jeopardizing 
the solvency of the disability insurance 
program. It will be ready for introduc-
tion soon. 
My concerns and efforts have not 
been about waiving the SSDI waiting 
period for those who tragically suffer 
from ALS. I certainly agree that we 
ought to improve the time that they 
have left. But picking and choosing fa-
vorites among those with comparable 
conditions is not the right way to go 
about it. The lives of the men and 
women who suffer from other very 
similar conditions are just as valuable, 
and we should be a voice for them, too. 
FAIRNESS FOR HIGH-SKILLED 
IMMIGRANTS ACT OF 2019 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, as if in legis-
lative session, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Committee on the Judiciary 
be discharged from further consider-
ation of H.R. 1044 and the Senate pro-
ceed to its immediate consideration. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 1044) to amend the Immigra-
tion and Nationality Act to eliminate the 
per-country numerical limitation for em-
ployment-based immigrants, to increase the 
per-country numerical limitation for family- 
sponsored immigrants, and for other pur-
poses. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to proceeding to the meas-
ure? 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Lee substitute 
amendment at the desk be considered 
and agreed to; and the bill, as amended, 
be considered read a third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 2690) in the na-
ture of a substitute was agreed to. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
The amendment was ordered to be 
engrossed and the bill to be read a 
third time. 
The bill was read the third time. 
Mr. LEE. I know of no further debate 
on the bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further debate? 
Hearing none, the bill having been 
read the third time, the question is, 
Shall the bill pass? 
The bill (H.R. 1044), as amended, was 
passed. 
Mr. LEE. I ask unanimous consent 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO ROB BISHOP 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today 
to honor my friend and colleague, Con-
gressman ROB BISHOP. After 18 years of 
service in the U.S. House of Represent-
atives, he has decided to hang up his 
gloves and embark on his well-deserved 
retirement. 
ROB BISHOP has served Utah’s First 
Congressional District with integrity, 
tenacity, humility, and humor, and it 
is my high privilege to have worked 
with him over the last 10 years and, in 
the process, to have become his friend. 
Born and raised in Kaysville, UT, 
ROB has been a lifelong resident of 
Utah’s First Congressional District, 
with the exception of the 2-year mis-
sion where he lived in Germany while 
representing 
the 
Church 
of 
Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. He grad-
uated from Davis High School with 
high honors and later graduated magna 
cum laude from the University of Utah 
with a degree in political science. 
The embodiment of a public servant, 
ROB began his career as a high school 
teacher at Ben Lomond High School 
and Box Elder High School, teaching 
courses in German, AP U.S. history 
and government, and coaching debate. 
He notoriously had one rule in the 
classroom: I am never wrong. That 
might tell you something about ROB 
BISHOP. 
An avid lover of musicals, he was ac-
tive in community theater, where he 
happened 
to 
have 
met 
his 
wife 
Jeralynn. They first met on the pro-
duction of ‘‘South Pacific’’ at the Pal-
ace Playhouse, and they later starred 
together as the prince and princess in a 
production of ‘‘Once Upon a Mattress.’’ 
In their real-life love story, they have 
five children—Shule, Jarom, Zenock, 
Maren, and Jashon, with spouses Me-
lissa, Kristin, Shalise, and Courtney, as 
well as nine grandchildren. 
Inspired in his public service by 
Barry Goldwater, he was also involved 
in local politics from a young age, 
working at various levels of govern-
ment and of the Republican Party. He 
has gone from being a precinct chair to 
a member of the Republican National 
Committee and from being vice chair 
of the Davis County Teenage Repub-
lican Club to the adviser to the Utah 
Teenage Republicans in 1996. Starting 
in 1997, he served two terms as chair-
man of the Utah Republican Party. 
At just 25, he was elected to the Utah 
House of Representatives when he was 
known for always wearing sweaters and 
no socks. He served in the State legis-
lature for 16 years and, during the last 
2 years, having been unanimously 
elected, served as speaker of the house 
of representatives. 
In 2002, after serving in the State leg-
islature and having spent 28 years of 
teaching, he decided to serve at the na-
tional level. As ROB BISHOP said in one 
of his most popular campaign slogans: 
‘‘Utah has plenty of Bishops—send this 
one to Washington!’’ 
ROB has faithfully devoted his life to 
representing 
Utah’s 
First 
Congres-
sional District, and he has been doing 
that ever since making that critical de-
cision to run for Congress. 
I remember one of the first times I 
worked with him when ROB was a rel-
atively new Member of Congress and I 
was serving at the time as general 
counsel to then-Governor Jon Hunts-
man. At the time, a private fuel stor-
age organization was trying to store 
spent nuclear fuel rods in above-ground 
storage casks along the Wasatch Front 
corridor, just miles from Utah’s major 
metropolitan area and just under the 
low-altitude flight path of fighter jets 
flying between Hill Air Force Base to 
the Utah Test and Training Range. 
Out of all of the Members of Utah’s 
congressional delegation at the time, 
all of whom, I would adhere, were simi-
larly opposed to this proposal to store 
spent nuclear fuel in this particular 
place in this particular way—our con-
gressional delegation was united in

that regard—but ROB BISHOP stood out 
as one who was particularly concerned 
about it and was particularly deter-
mined to prevent such a dangerous idea 
from taking place. 
Congressman BISHOP had a full un-
derstanding of the problem, and he had 
a complete mastery of the scientific 
facts of the issue, and he had detailed, 
helpful ideas about how to address it. 
He also understood the significant and 
long-lasting 
potential 
ramifications 
that this plan could have had for Hill 
Air Force Base and the Utah Test and 
Training Range. 
Thanks to ROB BISHOP’s vision, direc-
tion, and determination, he developed a 
strategy and worked hard to imple-
ment that strategy and eventually 
worked to pass a bill designating the 
area in question as wilderness—cre-
ating a wilderness curtain around the 
designated storage area—making it im-
possible for the storage plant to be 
completed. ROB BISHOP thus success-
fully prevented spent nuclear fuel rods 
from coming to Utah and being stored 
in a particularly unsafe way and in an 
unsafe place close to Utah’s major pop-
ulation center. 
Though relatively new to Congress at 
the time, ROB was punching way above 
his weight. Why? Well, because he is 
awesome and because he was willing to 
dive into the nitty-gritty details of an 
issue and put in the hard work, not 
knowing and, frankly, not even caring 
who got the credit. ROB BISHOP just 
wanted to get it done. That is who ROB 
BISHOP is, that is how he serves, and 
that is why we love him. That has 
characterized ROB BISHOP’s entire time 
in Congress: doggedly, thoughtfully, 
and honestly working for Utahns’ best 
interests, and never really caring much 
who got the attention. 
He served on the Armed Services 
Committee, the powerful House Rules 
Committee, and the Science Com-
mittee. As both chair and ranking 
member of the Natural Resources Com-
mittee, he chaired hearings with his 
characteristically witty quips and wry 
jokes. He has also chaired the Congres-
sional Western Caucus, served on the 
House German Caucus for his whole 
tenure, including for 2 years as chair, 
and he helped found the 10th Amend-
ment Task Force. 
When Speaker of the House John 
Boehner created committees for con-
gressional reform, ROB
BISHOP
was 
named chairman of the Committee for 
Procedural Reform and, later on, lead-
er of the Rules group. Under Speaker 
Paul Ryan, he was named chair of the 
Federalism Committee. ROB did all this 
in addition to being a staunch advocate 
for the military and, in particular, for 
Hill Air Force Base. 
One of his proudest achievements was 
getting an extension of the Michaels 
airstrip at the Dugway Proving Ground 
in Tooele County. When he was told 
that there was no funding for it to be 
attained at the Federal level, he suc-
cessfully got the Utah State Legisla-
ture to appropriate the funding to 
make it happen. He was instrumental 
in establishing Falcon Hill, an aero-
space research park just outside of Hill 
Air Force Base and a public-private 
partnership between the Air Force, the 
State of Utah, and private developers 
that was the first of its kind anywhere 
in the country and a model of many 
more like it to come. 
ROB has also brought his love of base-
ball with him to Washington. A huge 
admirer of Mickey Mantle and Ernie 
Banks, ROB is known to have actual 
dirt from the pitcher’s mound at Yan-
kee Stadium in his Washington, DC, of-
fice. He has been a long-time supporter 
of the Salt Lake Bees, even cham-
pioning the construction of their sta-
dium while he was in the State legisla-
ture, and he is a diehard Cubs fan. 
Every year, he dons a uniform himself, 
leading his office in the intramural 
baseball league on Capitol Hill, with 
their 
team 
name 
known 
as 
the 
‘‘Raucus Caucus.’’ 
ROB has brought the same passion he 
has for baseball to serving his constitu-
ents. He has, for years, worked with 
the Close Up Foundation to bring high 
school students to Washington, and he 
has partnered with teachers and stu-
dents to put on an AP government con-
ference every year. 
He has famously led constituent and 
student groups on long, expert night-
time tours of the Capitol Building. In 
fact, he is known as the guy who gives 
the very best Capitol tours in all of 
Washington, and he has consistently 
spent hours upon hours late into the 
night making personal phone calls to 
each constituent who writes in to his 
office. 
One of my favorite things about ROB 
BISHOP
is precisely how understated 
and down to Earth and often self-depre-
cating he is. It is a true feat when you 
have been in Congress as long as he has 
and accomplished as many things as he 
has. 
While he is known for his sharp 
three-piece suits here in Washington, I 
can’t count the number of plane rides I 
have taken with ROB BISHOP where he 
shows up on the plane actually wearing 
gym shorts, sandals, and a hoodie. In 
fact, basically every time, he has given 
me the sage advice not to torture my-
self wearing a suit while on a 4-hour 
plane ride. 
In fact, just the other day—just this 
week, as we were flying from Salt Lake 
City to Washington, DC, he commended 
me for finally having gotten the memo. 
At least this time, as he noted, I wasn’t 
wearing a suit, although he derided me 
a little bit for not wearing shorts. 
But when you have a conversation 
with ROB BISHOP, you never feel that 
he is trying to advance his own agenda 
or gain attention or fanfare. As a mat-
ter of fact, it is quite the opposite. It 
feels like a real conversation with a 
real goal to fix a problem. He simply 
tells it like it is—an altogether rare, 
refreshing, and much needed quality on 
Capitol Hill. 
When ROB ran for Congress, he said it 
was his goal to make Congress less 
powerful when he left than it was when 
he came. In all of his time here, he 
sought to put power in Washington 
back in the hands of Utahns and back 
in the hands of people across the coun-
try in their respective States. Just so, 
in all his time here, he slept on either 
an air mattress or on a futon so that he 
wouldn’t get too comfortable, so that 
he would never feel too ‘‘at home’’ in 
Congress. 
Rare is the person who can come to 
change Washington but not ever be 
changed by Washington. ROB BISHOP 
has managed to do just that. He has 
made a real difference for the people of 
Utah and the people of the United 
States of America. 
It has been a distinct pleasure to call 
him a friend and a colleague, and I 
have to say I am going to miss ROB 
BISHOP’s service here in Washington. 
Just the same, we have all benefited 
and we will all continue to benefit for 
many decades to come from what he 
has done here, who he has been here, 
and what he has stood for here so val-
iantly and consistently and faithfully 
and with such great decency and hu-
mility. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
COMMUNICATIONS DECENCY ACT 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there is 
a rather complicated issue that is out 
there that not many people are aware 
of. It emanates from back in 1996 with 
the passage of something called the 
Communication Decency Act. 
Just a few weeks before the 2020 elec-
tion, Twitter did what was previously 
unthinkable: It suppressed a long-
standing, legitimate news outlet—that 
was the New York Post—from sharing 
an article either publicly or privately 
it deemed unfavorable to Presidential 
candidate Joe Biden. Obviously, they 
were concerned about Joe Biden, and 
they were using this act to suppress in-
formation that may not have been fa-
vorable. That is not what is supposed 
to happen, what it is supposed to do. To 
make it worse, they suspended an ac-
count of the Post—that is a major news 
outlet—for over 24 hours. 
While other big tech entities sup-
pressed the story as well, the depths of 
Twitter’s 
censorship 
reached 
new 
heights, telling users that sharing the 
article could be ‘‘potentially harmful.’’ 
There is no criteria to determine what 
is potentially harmful; they just de-
cided—it is a liberal mindset, and they 
want to punish people who are not 
sharing their mindset. 
Contrast that with the refusal to 
moderate 
any 
comments 
made 
by 
Iran’s 
Supreme 
Leader, 
Ayatollah 
Khamenei, who called Israel a ‘‘can-
cerous growth’’ to be ‘‘uprooted and de-
stroyed’’ and for the ‘‘elimination of 
the Zionist regime’’ through ‘‘firm, 
armed resistance’’ despite having a pol-
icy against hateful conduct and glori-
fying violence. That is what they did. 
Those are the words. That is what they 
did.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7172 
December 2, 2020 
Yet it proves what President Trump 
has been talking about for a long pe-
riod of time on social media. Look 
what they have done to him over the 
last 4 years. 
It is time to make sure that Twitter 
and other social media platforms are 
held accountable for engaging in cen-
sorship by repealing section 230 of the 
Communications Decency Act. Now, 
that sounds a little complicated. The 
Communications 
Decency 
Act—we 
know why it was started, but we know 
times have changed, and now it has 
turned into a very liberal political or-
ganization. 
For over 20 years, social media plat-
forms have benefited from protec-
tionism unprecedented in the modern 
era—a complete liability shield pro-
tecting them from how they moderate 
or censor content posted for their 
users. To add insult to injury, there is 
no one to check the partisan censor-
ship of these social media platforms. 
Instead, they are coddled by section 
230’s 
‘‘Good 
Samaritan’’ 
provision, 
which allows ‘‘good-faith’’ efforts to re-
strict objectionable material. But the 
problem is, they are the ones who de-
cide what is objectionable. 
We all know Jesus’s parable of the 
Good Samaritan. The moral imperative 
that comes from the parable has guided 
many legislative protections for those 
seeking to do good—doctors responding 
to problems with people in midair. I 
can remember many times I was in-
volved as a volunteer pilot helping to 
get people medical care. People who 
are trying to do the right thing. We 
know that is significant. We know that 
is what the history was supposed to be 
on this section, section 230. It was in-
tended to make sure that Twitter could 
flag and remove unquestionably harm-
ful content, like ISIS and their propa-
ganda videos. 
In the case of the social media plat-
forms, however, it amounts to nothing 
more than the fox guarding the hen-
house. Instead of focusing on modera-
tion to protect users from death 
threats or harassment and to prevent 
criminal behavior, Twitter is allowed 
to determine what is ‘‘otherwise objec-
tionable’’ and censor it from the plat-
form, with no right to appeal and no 
transparency. I mean, where else can 
you go in America and find someone 
who is totally immune from that type 
of behavior? You can’t. It doesn’t exist. 
This is a case in point. Last year, 
they kowtowed to the Chinese Com-
munist Party by removing the ac-
counts of more than 100 dissidents 
ahead of the 30th anniversary of the 
Tiananmen Square massacre. I remem-
ber that well. I remember where I was 
when that happened. But they didn’t 
want people to know that type of thing 
actually went on, and that was some-
how objectionable. 
Twitter’s censorship and actions over 
the past few years make it clear it has 
decided that President Trump is objec-
tionable, and they decide that they are 
just going to act accordingly. That is 
not surprising when you look at the 
employee culture they have in that 
media. 
Here is the problem with section 230. 
According to a strict interpretation of 
the 1996 law, that is allowed. Partisan 
censorship is allowed. Senator RON 
WYDEN even admitted that, when writ-
ten, section 230 wasn’t about neutrality 
or protecting the free marketplace of 
ideas on platforms. 
Clearly, we need to completely over-
haul section 230, and the best way to do 
it is just repeal it. Repeal the whole 
thing. That is what the President 
wants to do. Then you could start over 
again and build up. 
Times have changed. The argument 
we hear against reforming alone or re-
pealing would be that any changes to 
section 230 would give social media 
platforms like Twitter greater control 
over content on their platforms. They 
are not wrong, but that argument ig-
nores the fact that censorship is al-
ready happening for Americans due to 
their political beliefs, in violation of 
the First Amendment—it is supposed 
to protect people—without any trans-
parency or recourse. 
Others believe in the need to reform 
230 incrementally, but those solutions 
are merely bandaids on a bullet wound. 
We have seen the negative impact of 
incremental reforms. They just don’t 
work. A good example: Efforts to hold 
users accountable for information by 
requiring a ‘‘real name’’ associated 
with an account has seen Native Amer-
icans blocked from platforms for using 
their legal names. 
Social media platforms and sup-
porters of section 230’s last-ditch argu-
ment is to tell conservative voices to 
create their own social media plat-
forms since they clearly aren’t wel-
come in those that are existing today. 
That sounds good, except that the 
problem is that Twitter and others 
have a de facto monopoly on social 
media. House Democrats agree. They 
wrote a 400-plus page report arguing 
Big Tech constitutes a monopoly. 
Just remember the internet, what it 
was like back in 1996. In 1996, only 20 
million Americans had access to the 
internet—only 20 million Americans in 
1996. Today, 313 million Americans 
have access. So now it is a way of life. 
The reality is that section 230 is sim-
ply outdated for today’s usage and is a 
strong case for why all laws should 
sunset. One of the problems I have with 
laws that are passed is that they can be 
passed, the problem is corrected that 
caused the laws to be passed, but the 
laws stay on the books. That is exactly 
what has happened with this. 
Section 230 is outdated and needs to 
be changed. Otherwise, we will find 
ourselves here time and again, forced 
to rectify decades-old laws with mod-
ern technology and ideas. 
Let me simplify. Section 230 allows 
Twitter and other liberal social media 
companies to be exempt from liabil-
ity—there is no accountability whatso-
ever—for what their users say. For ex-
ample, Twitter can’t be held respon-
sible for someone who posts a death 
threat against me, and I understand 
that. That is where we are today. But 
they are also protected from what they 
censor even if it is in violation of the 
First Amendment or it is protected 
speech. No one else has this shield. No 
one else in society has this, which is 
why President Trump is right. We need 
a total repeal. 
If you look at what they had done to 
President Trump over the last 4 years, 
you will know exactly what I am talk-
ing about. But the place for repeal is 
not the Defense authorization bill. 
There is an idea that the Defense au-
thorization bill for 60 years in a row 
now has passed, and so everybody who 
has something that doesn’t pass nor-
mally, they try to put it on as an 
amendment—having nothing to do with 
the military and having nothing to do 
with our defense system for the ensu-
ing year. So that is how this one was 
decided. They put this on. The problem 
is, if it had that language repealing it, 
we would not have a defense bill. So 
there is not a choice in this case. We 
need a place for repealing section 230, 
and we need to do it. 
The NDAA is about making sure that 
our troops are cared for. It is for our 
kids in the field. They are the ones we 
are supporting. They are the ones who 
need us. If we don’t have this Defense 
authorization bill passed by December 
31, our pilots are not going to get flight 
pay; the kids are not going to get haz-
ard pay. The whole thing will fall 
apart. 
Just think about the problems we are 
having in the military. One of the big 
problems is—and the Presiding Officer 
recognizes this because he is on this 
committee—right now, our big problem 
is how to get more pilots into the Air 
Force, into the services. They can’t do 
it because of the competition out 
there. We can’t compete with the pri-
vate sector. Now, if we take away their 
flight privileges, then it could be good-
bye to most of our pilots. 
We just need to get this thing done. 
It should not be on the Defense bill. I 
want to make this appeal to make sure 
that no one has the idea that the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act is the 
place to have it. 
I give the President and my col-
leagues my commitment that I will do 
everything possible to work toward a 
complete repeal of section 230 through 
other means. It has to happen. Presi-
dent Trump is right. Total repeal is the 
only answer if we are going to make 
sure we get this thing done—not on the 
bill, not on the Defense authorization 
bill, but in any of the other vehicles 
that come along. It has to be done. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7173 
December 2, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think 
it is important that we acknowledge 
what is going on right now. What is 
going on is that the most significant 
vote of the year is taking place. It is 
called the Defense authorization bill, 
the NDAA. It has passed every year for 
60 years now. This will be the 60th year 
it is passed. Nothing else has a record 
like that. 
Yet there is always trauma at the 
tail end, and the reason there is trau-
ma is that everyone knows it is going 
to pass—and it is going to pass—so 
anything they can’t pass during the 
normal process of the year, for any 
number of reasons, they try to put on 
this as an amendment. Some things are 
not acceptable because they have the 
effect of killing the bill. 
Now, we have two people who have 
been working with the committees put-
ting this thing together. I know that 
the Presiding Officer knows this, but 
these people have worked an entire 
year and many, many more than half 
the weekends. People have this idea 
that people don’t work in Washington 
on causes. They do on this one. 
John Bonsell in my office has been 
the director, the support of the bill, 
with Liz King on the Democratic side. 
They have worked hand in hand to-
gether. People talk about how Demo-
crats and Republicans fight with each 
other. Not on this bill. We all support 
it. We all want it. We all want to make 
sure it is done and it is done right. 
So we have a defense authorization 
bill. It will be the largest one that we 
have had in the history of the Defense 
authorization bills. It is one that, with-
out it, we are not going to be able to 
take care of our kids in the field. 
We have to remember that, while 
there are a lot of hitchhikers on this 
bill on causes that we have determined 
to be worthwhile causes, we don’t do it 
if it is going to be something that will 
take down the bill. So we want to 
make sure that nothing would jeop-
ardize passing the Defense authoriza-
tion bill. 
Now, the key is December 31 of this 
year. If we don’t have the bill passed by 
December 31 of this year, I mentioned 
that we have problems, that any of the 
specialist groups—and I talk about the 
pilots; I talk about those involved in 
hazard occupations—the SEALs—the 
individuals who are out there risking 
their lives to a greater extent than 
others do in the military. And they are 
out there doing it for this reason, and 
we want to make sure that they are 
willing to take these risks. We want to 
make sure that we are taking good 
care of people. 
I run into people all the time who 
say: You are always so concerned about 
our military. Yet the chief competition 
that we have is with whom: Russia and 
China? Russia and China actually, 
after the last administration—that was 
the Obama administration. In the last 
5 years—that would be from 2010 to 
2015—he knocked down the military 
budget by 25 percent. It had never hap-
pened before—not since World War II 
anyway. Yet we found ourselves in a 
situation where we couldn’t compete. 
Now, they will argue with you, and 
they will say: Well, we spend more 
money on defense than Russia and 
China put together. That is true, but 
there is a big difference, and that is 
that in Communist countries they 
don’t care about taking care of their 
troops. Our job is to make sure that 
our kids have a prosperous career. 
They want to defend their country, but 
they also have families. They have to 
take care of their families. 
Housing has been a huge problem in 
the military, so we want to make sure 
that we have good housing for our 
troops—not just here in the United 
States but around the world—and we 
are doing that. 
Now, in Communist countries they 
give them a gun and say: Go out and 
kill people. They don’t care about the 
troops. They don’t spend any of that 
money. 
So the largest expense, the largest 
ticket on running a military operation 
is taking care of the people. So that is 
why it is important that people under-
stand this. 
There is also a document that nobody 
reads anymore. It is called the Con-
stitution. You read that and say: What 
are we supposed to be doing in Wash-
ington? We get involved in so many dif-
ferent things. Yet, when you read the 
Constitution, it says that our primary 
concern should be to defend against an 
outside enemy, and then other areas— 
transportation and a few other areas— 
are mentioned. But the No. 1 concern is 
that we have to have a military that is 
second to none. We want to make sure. 
Let me say this about our President. 
When he first came into office, Presi-
dent Trump recognized what had hap-
pened to our military and had recog-
nized 
that 
there 
are 
things 
like 
hypersonic—that is a very recent, mod-
ern technology that they are working 
on in China and Russia and other 
places, and we are actually behind 
them at this time. 
People assume that America has bet-
ter everything in the military than 
China has and Russia has, and that is 
not true. They have artillery systems 
that are better than the artillery sys-
tems that we currently have. 
So we have a job that I consider to be 
the most significant job—significant 
job for the defense of our country, and 
it is just that: to defend our country. 
I want to applaud all of these people 
who work long hours. We are now to 
the point where they are what they 
call turning the page. We are ready to 
pass a bill. We are in the process of get-
ting signatures from the committees. 
There are a lot of people who don’t 
like the idea of having to sign a bill 
and sign on to a bill, yet they know 
that in order to maintain a superior 
position over China and Russia, we 
have to do that, and we have to show 
our superiority, and we have to make 
it last. That is what we are doing right 
now. It is a very significant time. 
I anticipate that we are going to be 
able to get this done, and I applaud the 
President for the time that he has 
spent and the money that he has spent 
on rebuilding our military. You hear 
him say all the time that we now have 
the strongest military that we have 
ever had and we are in great shape. But 
we are still rebuilding. We still have 
areas where our adversaries have bet-
ter equipment than we do. 
So that is what is going on today. 
That is what is taking place. It is a 
very proud time that we can say that 
we are now addressing those things 
that are the most significant things 
going on in Washington today. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7174 
December 2, 2020 
S. 578 waives a waiting period in the 
disability program for the compelling 
case of patients with ALS. 
There are, of course, other compel-
ling cases. 
And we have to be mindful of the dis-
ability trust fund which will eventu-
ally face depletion. 
As the Consortium for Citizens with 
Disabilities, which is an umbrella orga-
nization representing advocates for a 
number of disabling conditions, puts it: 
‘‘Bills that only fix the problem for some 
people who meet the strict eligibility stand-
ards for SSDI are likely to lead to interest 
groups requesting waiver of wait periods for 
other impairments.’’ 
So it is likely that Congress will see 
more requests for waivers of waiting 
periods for those afflicted with disabil-
ities arising from conditions other 
than ALS. 
Waiting periods in the disability in-
surance program were put into law for 
various policy reasons. 
When we waive waiting periods for 
specific conditions, some of which are 
terribly disabling and even fatal, we 
change the nature of the disability pro-
gram. 
We change benefits and don’t have 
any offsetting change to the tax that 
funds the disability insurance trust 
fund or any offsetting change to other 
benefits. 
However compelling it is to waive 
waiting periods, whenever we do it, we 
accelerate the exhaustion of the dis-
ability trust fund. 
And that affects people with all 
forms of disability. 
In order to help make Social Secu-
rity combined disability and retire-
ment trust funds whole, my amend-
ment would offset the cost of the ALS 
bill. 
My amendment simply changes the 
minimum monthly withholding thresh-
old for recovery of any overpayment of 
Social Security benefits to reflect the 
increase in benefits we have seen since 
SSA established the current minimum 
of $10 in 1960. 
My amendment simply changes the 
threshold amount from $10 to 10 per-
cent of the monthly benefit payable, as 
is already done in the SSI program. 
With this change, SSA would recover 
overpayments more efficiently and bet-
ter fulfill its stewardship obligations to 
Social Security’s trust funds, while re-
taining safeguards for beneficiaries 
surrounding overpayments. 
Guardrails to protect beneficiaries to 
ensure that collections don’t create 
hardships are maintained. 
Nothing in my amendment leads to 
benefit cuts of even a penny that a re-
tiree or disabled worker has earned. 
This policy is something that has 
been in numerous budgets of the Presi-
dent, including President Obama and 
now President Trump. 
I urge my colleagues to support my 
amendment, to ensure that we protect 
the integrity of Social Security’s trust 
funds 
while 
also 
protecting 
bene-
ficiaries. 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO MARK DAVIS 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today I wish to recognize Mark Davis 
on the occasion of his retirement. 
Mark dedicated over five decades to 
broadcast journalism, including an im-
pressive near 37 years with News 8. An 
award winning-radio news director in 
Boston, Mark quickly adapted to TV 
news when he arrived in Connecticut. 
Throughout his career, he set an exam-
ple with his honest, unstinting report-
ing. Mark covered the administrations 
of seven Connecticut Governors, al-
ways speaking truth to power. 
His thorough, efficient responses to 
stories earned Mark the respect of his 
colleagues. Holding himself to the 
highest standard, Mark was always a 
consummate professional. Mark’s out-
standing and reliable work leaves a re-
markable legacy in Connecticut jour-
nalism. 
As 
chief 
political 
correspondent, 
Mark remained nonpartisan while dem-
onstrating tireless grit. He was coura-
geous and never shied away from ask-
ing the tough questions. At the same 
time, Mark had an uncanny ability to 
put politicians at ease, facilitating dis-
cussions and ensuring he could provide 
a thoughtful, complete story. Trusted 
by constituents, he was voted our 
State’s best local TV reporter 2 years 
in a row by Connecticut Magazine. 
Mark’s exceptional record as an in-
sightful, driven, and honest reporter 
leaves a historic mark and emphasizes 
the vital role he and his fellow report-
ers play in keeping people well in-
formed in Connecticut and across the 
Nation. His professional partnership 
with Joe Sferrazza established a model 
of unmatched teamwork that will have 
an impact for years to come. 
I applaud his lifetime of tenacious 
commitment to comprehensive, fair 
work focused on uncovering the truth, 
and I know my colleagues will join me 
in thanking Mark for his extraordinary 
contributions to regional reporting.∑

TRIBUTE TO JANICE DONALDSON 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, today I 
recognize and honor the career of Jan-
ice Donaldson, Director of the Small 
Business Development Center—SBDC— 
at the University of North Florida, 
UNF. At the end of this month, she will 
retire after serving the small business 
community for 31 years. 
Since 1981, Mrs. Donaldson has sup-
ported small business owners and en-
trepreneurs in the Jacksonville area. 
After graduating from the University 
of Georgia in 1980, Janice joined the 
SBDC at UNF as editor of the office 
newsletter. After 21 years with the of-
fice, Mrs. Donaldson took over as direc-
tor in 2002 and has been a resilient 
leader throughout her years of service. 
During her tenure as director, the 
center’s service area grew immensely, 
from one office serving five counties, 
to seven offices serving 18 counties. Ad-
ditionally, SBDC expanded its services 
from supporting entrepreneurs, to now 
enabling clients to grow their existing 
small businesses. 
In her final year as director, Mrs. 
Donaldson faced one of her most dif-
ficult challenges yet. The COVID–19 
pandemic forced her office to work re-
motely where they had to quickly ac-
climate to the ever-changing economic 
conditions. Under her leadership, the 
SBDC team worked diligently to help 
small businesses adapt to the pan-
demic, advising on financial assistance 
opportunities available, including the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
and 
Economic 
Injury 
Disaster 
Loans 
through the U.S. Small Business Ad-
ministration. This year alone, the cen-
ter has participated in more than 20,000 
consulting hours and facilitated the 
awards of approximately $50 million in 
capital to small businesses in her re-
gion. 
Over the years, Mrs. Donaldson has 
shown paramount dedication to small 
businesses. She has played a critical 
role in the economic growth of north-
east Florida and has nurtured the 
American dream. Mrs. Donaldson will 
be greatly missed by her colleagues and 
the thousands of business owners she 
has assisted throughout her notable ca-
reer. I wish her the best of luck in all 
of her future endeavors.∑

RECOGNIZING LUCKY GOAT 
COFFEE COMPANY 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, chairman 
of the Senate Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, each 
week I recognize a small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit at the heart of our coun-
try. It is my privilege to recognize a 
family-owned 
business 
that 
invests 
heavily in its customers, employees, 
and community. Today, it is my honor 
to name the Lucky Goat Coffee Com-
pany of Tallahassee, FL, as the Senate 
Small Business of the Week. 
In 2010, Ben Pautsch founded Lucky 
Goat Coffee Company as a coffee 
wholesale and distribution company. 
Ben, a graduate of Florida State Uni-
versity—FSU—focused 
on 
providing 
high-quality beans to local coffee cafes. 
The Tallahassee-based business grew 
quickly as orders poured in. Their rep-
utation for roasting the best grounds 
led to the creation of the first Lucky 
Goat coffee shop in 2015. The appealing 
storefront and large warehouse allowed 
Lucky Goat to spread their knowledge 
and passion for coffee through various 
classes and tours, strengthening their 
customer relationships in the process. 
Today, Lucky Goat Coffee has grown 
to include five coffee shops in Tallahas-
see and a franchise location in Jack-
sonville. Their Tallahassee-based head-
quarters provides more than 350 whole-
sale customers across the country with

premium coffee beans. Ben keeps his 
strong relationship with FSU. Lucky 
Goat Coffee products are featured on 
campus, and Ben regularly hires FSU 
students and alumni. From the start, 
Ben has been committed to creating 
dignified work. He prioritizes career 
development and professional growth 
for 
his 
employees, 
with 
one-time 
baristas moving up to serve in senior 
management within the company. 
Over the years, Lucky Goat Coffee 
has been recognized for its growth and 
remained committed to investing in its 
community. 
In 
2017, 
then-Governor 
Rick Scott recognized Lucky Goat Cof-
fee with a Governor’s Business Ambas-
sador Award. As one of the 100 fastest 
growing companies owned or led by 
Florida 
State 
University 
alumnus, 
Lucky Goat Coffee was named to the 
Seminole 100 in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Ben 
mentors young entrepreneurs inter-
ested in the coffee industry, and Lucky 
Goat Coffee supports local youth-fo-
cused organizations, including local 
Little League teams and Cub Scouts. 
They also help Leon County Schools, 
donating much-needed school supplies 
for students and equipment, including 
coffee, for the teachers. 
Like many Florida small businesses, 
Lucky Goat Coffee suffered a severe de-
cline in revenue due to the coronavirus 
pandemic. In April 2020, the U.S. Small 
Business Administration launched the 
Paycheck Protection Program, a small 
business relief program that I was 
proud to author. The PPP provides for-
givable loans to impacted small busi-
nesses and nonprofits who maintain 
their payroll during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. A PPP loan gave Lucky Goat 
the support it needed to retain its em-
ployees and survive the pandemic. 
Lucky Goat Coffee is a notable exam-
ple of a small business that provides 
dignified work to its employees and in-
vests in its community. Through their 
passion and generosity, Lucky Goat 
fuels Floridians every day with its deli-
cious coffee and supports them through 
community service. 
Congratulations to Ben and the en-
tire team at Lucky Goat. I look for-
ward to your continued success.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–253. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of 
Michigan urging the President of the United 
States and the United States Congress to de-
clare the waters of the Straits of Mackinac 
as ‘‘designated’’ for purposes of Great Lakes 
commercial ship pilotage; to the Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 244 
Whereas, The Great Lakes are integral to 
Michigan’s environment, economic develop-
ment, and recreation; and 
Whereas, The federal Great Lakes Pilotage 
Act of 1960 established two distinct cat-
egories of pilotage on the Great Lakes—des-
ignated waters and undesignated waters— 
and authorized the President of the United 
States to determine designated waters. In 
1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower de-
clared designated waters on the Great Lakes, 
including all United States waters of the St. 
Marys River, the Soo Locks, and approaches 
thereto. There have been no significant 
changes in designated waters since that 
time; and 
Whereas, The act requires both United 
States and foreign-flagged vessels sailing in 
designated waters to be under the naviga-
tional direction of a United States or Cana-
dian registered pilot to ensure marine safety 
and effective use of navigable waters. Fur-
ther, foreign-flagged vessels operating in un-
designated waters on the Great Lakes must 
have a United States or Canadian registered 
pilot on board to direct the navigation of the 
vessel or be available to assist in navigation 
if necessary; and 
Whereas, Pilotage of foreign-flagged ves-
sels on the Great Lakes is an important 
function provided by individuals with years 
of experience sailing on the largest fresh-
water sea in the world. Pilots are charged 
with the safety of the vessel and boating 
public as well as protection of infrastructure 
and the environment; and 
Whereas, The Straits of Mackinac, an envi-
ronmentally sensitive area of great impor-
tance to the entire Great Lakes ecosystem, 
is an undesignated water. The Straits are 
often congested with commercial and rec-
reational vessel traffic. Additionally, the 
area has restricted visibility, narrow water-
ways, and important infrastructure includ-
ing the Mackinac Bridge and pipelines con-
tributing to the unique navigational chal-
lenges that exist in the Straits of Mackinac; 
now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, 
That we urge the President and the Congress 
of the United States to declare the waters of 
the Straits of Mackinac as ‘‘designated’’ for 
purposes of Great Lakes commercial ship pi-
lotage; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States, the President of the United States 
Senate, the Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives, the members of 
the Michigan congressional delegation, and 
the Commandant of the United States Coast 
Guard. 
POM–254. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan discouraging 
the United States Congress from expanding 
the size of the Supreme Court of the United 
States; to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 323 
Whereas, For over 150 years, there have 
been nine seats on the Supreme Court of the 
United States. While the country has grown 
and changed during that period, the Supreme 
Court has repeatedly demonstrated its abil-
ity to fulfill its constitutional role as the na-
tion’s highest court and remain an inde-
pendent arbiter of the law without addi-
tional justices; and 
Whereas, In recent months, there have 
been calls to increase the number of justices 
on the Supreme Court in an effort to gain po-
litical advantage. The number of justices on 
the Supreme Court has been fixed by federal 
law since 1869 and efforts to expand the size 
of the Supreme Court in the century and a 
half since have been met with significant re-
sistance from the American people; and 
Whereas, The legitimacy of the Supreme 
Court is its most valuable asset. The Su-
preme Court’s ability to issue rulings which 
are followed nationwide rests on the Amer-
ican people’s respect for the institution’s 
independence and separation from day-to- 
day politics; and 
Whereas, The federal judiciary, particu-
larly the Supreme Court, must remain insu-
lated from partisan disputes. Politicizing the 
Supreme Court by adding seats for the pur-
pose of generating an ideological shift would 
be enormously detrimental for the public’s 
faith in the judicial branch as an inde-
pendent and impartial branch of govern-
ment. The framers of the U.S. Constitution 
envisioned a system in which Supreme Court 
justices and federal judges would serve life-
time appointments, ensuring that the judici-
ary would not experience the kinds of polit-
ical pressures that are present in the elected 
branches; and 
Whereas, Subjecting the Supreme Court to 
major structural changes as a consequence of 
shifting partisan control of the executive 
and legislative branches would bring the ju-
diciary into the political fray in a way that 
would harm its ability to fulfill its critical 
role in our system; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, 
That we discourage Congress from expanding 
the size of the Supreme Court of the United 
States; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States Senate, the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, and the 
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation. 
POM–255. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Louisiana urging the 
United States Congress to take necessary ac-
tions to review and enact federal law to fully 
protect developmentally or physically dis-
abled federal benefit recipients from sexual 
and physical exploitation or abuse by payees 
and fiduciaries; to the Committee on Fi-
nance. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 51 
Whereas, the Social Security Administra-
tion, through its Representative Payment 
Program, appoints family, friends, or other 
individuals to serve as payees’ representa-
tives for beneficiaries who are incapable of 
managing their Social Security or Supple-
mental Security Income (SSI) payments due 
to age, developmental disability, physical 
disability, or mental disability; and 
Whereas, the United States Department of 
Veterans Affairs, through its Fiduciary Pro-
gram, appoints family, friends, or other indi-
viduals to serve as fiduciaries and receive 
payments for veterans who are physically or 
mentally incapable of managing their vet-
erans benefit payments due to physical in-
jury, disease, or age; and 
Whereas, recent medical testimony before 
the Louisiana Senate Select Committee on 
Women and Children revealed that develop-
mentally or physically disabled patients 
were being sexually and physically exploited 
and abused by caregivers who were also pay-
ees; and 
Whereas, studies have shown that children 
are more likely to be abused if they are liv-
ing with certain caregivers, and disabled 
adults with developmental disabilities are 
more likely to be abused compared to the 
general population; and 
Whereas, the Social Security Administra-
tion and the United States Department of 
Veterans Affairs both have programs to as-
sess and review the suitability of payees and 
fiduciaries; and 
Whereas, the Senate finds that greater ef-
forts must be made to protect develop-
mentally or physically disabled federal ben-
efit recipients from exploitation and abuse 
by certain caregivers who are payees or fidu-
ciaries; and 
Whereas, Social Security recipients, SSI 
recipients, and veterans are entitled to 
health care benefits through Medicare, Med-
icaid, and veterans health benefits; and 
Whereas, Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans 
health benefits cover an annual wellness 
visit or routine medical examination with a 
primary care physician or other health care 
provider; and 
Whereas, the Senate of the Legislature of 
Louisiana finds that it would further protec-
tion efforts to require developmentally or 
physically disabled recipients of Social Secu-
rity, SSI, or veterans benefits to undergo an 
annual medical examination with their pri-
mary care physician outside of the view of a 
caregiver so as to eliminate or minimize the 
possibility of sexual or physical exploitation 
or abuse from their caregiver who is also a 
payee or fiduciary. Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate of the Legisla-
ture of Louisiana memorializes the Congress 
of the United States to take necessary ac-
tions to review and enact federal law to fully 
protect developmentally or physically dis-
abled federal benefit recipients from sexual 
and physical exploitation or abuse by payees 
and fiduciaries; and be it further,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7177 
December 2, 2020 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution 
shall be transmitted to the secretary of the 
United States Senate, the clerk of the 
United States House of Representatives, and 
to each member of the Louisiana delegation 
to the United States Congress. 
POM–256. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the Louisiana Attorney General and 
all appropriate federal agencies, including 
but not limited to the Federal Communica-
tions Commission, to investigate whether 
Altice USA or Suddenlink Communications 
has violated state or federal law in its deal-
ings with the citizens of Louisiana; to the 
Committee 
on 
Commerce, 
Science, 
and 
Transportation. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 2 
Whereas, internet connectivity has become 
a more essential service in the light of 
COVID–19; and 
Whereas, tens of thousands of students in 
Louisiana are dependent on internet service 
to go to school, thousands of Louisianans are 
reliant on internet services for telemedicine, 
and small businesses depend on online sales 
more than ever; and 
Whereas, the restoration of communica-
tion service after a natural disaster is para-
mount to relief efforts and Louisianans re-
turning to their normal lives; and 
Whereas, the Louisiana legislature has re-
ceived more than one hundred complaints 
about Suddenlink engaging in deceptive 
trade practices, charging fees for services 
that are not delivered, providing poor cus-
tomer service, failing to communicate about 
key events including hurricanes, and engag-
ing in various other problematic and poten-
tially illegal behaviors; and 
Whereas, a joint commerce committee 
hearing examined how Suddenlink has been 
failing to meet its obligations to reconnect 
customers 
to 
essential 
communication 
equipment, has been charging customers for 
services it has not delivered, and has lagged 
behind its peers in assisting in recovery: 
Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby urge and request the Louisiana 
Attorney General to use the powers granted 
to him under the Unfair Trade Practices and 
Consumer Protection Law to investigate 
Altice USA and Suddenlink Communications 
and whether they have been engaging in ac-
tions that are prohibited under Louisiana 
law; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby urge and request any appro-
priate federal agencies, such as the Federal 
Communications Commission, to investigate 
whether Altice USA and Suddenlink Commu-
nications have engaged in a violation of fed-
eral law in their dealings with the people of 
Louisiana; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the Louisiana Attorney Gen-
eral, the presiding officers of the Senate and 
the House of Representatives of the Congress 
of the United States of America, and to each 
member of the Louisiana congressional dele-
gation.

POM–258. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the United States Congress and the 
Louisiana Congressional delegation to take 
such actions as are necessary to require the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) to more efficiently coordinate the 
removal of dislocated oilfield equipment 
after natural disasters in Louisiana; to the 
Committee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 7 
Whereas, hurricanes that blow through 
coastal Louisiana, particularly those that 
come ashore as a Category 3 or higher, such 
as Hurricane Rita in 2005 and particularly 
Hurricane Laura in 2020, leave behind de-
struction and dislocation of people, homes, 
and equipment; and 
Whereas, Hurricane Laura is estimated to 
have caused between $4 billion and $12 billion 
in damages mostly to Louisiana and mostly 
in the coastal areas of Southwest Louisiana; 
and 
Whereas, a component of that damage in-
volves the dislocation of equipment from the 
oil and gas industry located in coastal Lou-
isiana, including storage tanks, drums, pipe 
segments, and other equipment used in the 
oil patch, equipment that is picked up by the 
wind and water of the hurricane and dropped 
elsewhere in the coast; and 
Whereas, nearly eighty percent of the land 
in coastal Louisiana is privately-owned land, 
so much of the dislocated oil and gas equip-
ment lands on privately-held property; and 
Whereas, some of the dislocated oilfield 
equipment contains materials that can cause 
pollution if the tanks and drums are dam-
aged through the dislocation and could also 
be the cause of marine accidents when they 
are located in waterways where boat cap-
tains do not expect to find such hazards; and 
Whereas, initial efforts to locate and iden-
tify equipment displaced by a hurricane in-
clude an attempt to identify the owner of the 
equipment, notify the owner that their 
equipment has been found, and request that 
the owner remove their equipment from an-
other person’s property; and 
Whereas, the second step in attempting to 
address the dislocated equipment is the Lou-
isiana Department of Environmental Quality 
(LaDEQ), the Louisiana State Police, and 
the Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator’s Office 
(LOSCO) working in cooperation with the 
United States Coast Guard and, under the 
auspices of FEMA, working to remove any 
tank or drum that could be the source of pol-
lution in the marsh or could be the cause of 
marine accidents involving boats and dis-
placed tanks or drums; and 
Whereas, after sources of pollution and im-
mediate hazards are removed by LaDEQ, 
State Police, and LOSCO, the Louisiana De-
partment of Transportation and Develop-
ment and the Louisiana National Guard, 
again under the auspices of the FEMA, iden-
tify the location and nature of additional 
tanks, drums, and other oilfield equipment 
dislodged by the hurricane so removal plans 
can be developed; and 
Whereas, plans for removal of dislodged 
equipment that is neither hazardous nor pol-
luting include a development of a timeline 
and an assessment of the potential damage 
to the marsh that could occur as a result of 
removal efforts versus the damage that the 
item may cause by its relocation to the spot; 
and 
Whereas, because the process is a bifur-
cated process, requiring removal of haz-
ardous or polluting items first and then re-
moval of the remainder of the equipment, 
many times a situation arises that results in 
a displaced tank being bypassed on the way 
to remove a hazardous or polluting tank 
when removing all the equipment at the 
same time would be more efficient, more 
cost-effective, and require less overall time 
to remove all the dislodged equipment; and 
Whereas, the FEMA practices and proce-
dures do not allow the removal of nonhaz-
ardous, non-polluting items prior to or at 
the same time as removal of other displaced 
oilfield tanks, drums, and other equipment, 
thereby elongating the process and increas-
ing the damage to the private property lo-
cated in the marshes of coastal Louisiana; 
therefore be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the United States 
Congress to take such actions as are nec-
essary to require the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency to more efficiently co-
ordinate the removal of dislocated oilfield 
equipment after natural disasters in Lou-
isiana; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation.

782—HON-
ORING 
THE 
LIFE, 
ACHIEVE-
MENTS, 
AND 
DISTINGUISHED 
PUBLIC SERVICE OF THE HONOR-
ABLE GEORGE PRATT SHULTZ 
Mr. SULLIVAN (for himself and Mr. 
VAN HOLLEN) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 782 
Whereas, on December 13, 1920, the Honor-
able George Pratt Shultz was born in New 
York City as the only child of Margaret Len-
nox and Birl Earl Shultz; 
Whereas, upon graduating cum laude from 
Princeton University with a major in eco-
nomics and a minor in public and inter-
national affairs in 1942, Shultz joined the 
Marines and nobly served his country as a 
captain with a Marine anti-aircraft unit de-
ployed with the United States Army’s 81st 
Infantry Division to the Pacific for the bit-
terly fought Battle of Angaur in the Palau 
Islands; 
Whereas, following the war, Shultz earned 
a doctorate in industrial economics from the 
Massachusetts 
Institute 
of 
Technology, 
where he taught in the Department of Eco-
nomics and at the Sloan School of Manage-
ment until taking leave to serve on Presi-
dent Eisenhower’s Council of Economic Ad-
visors; 
Whereas Shultz then went on to join the 
University of Chicago as Dean of the Grad-
uate School of Business from 1962 until 1968; 
Whereas Shultz left academia to honorably 
serve his country in a number of critical eco-
nomic positions, including as Secretary of 
Labor, the country’s first Director of a mod-
ernized Office of Management and Budget 
(OMB), and Secretary of the Treasury; 
Whereas, during his time at the Depart-
ment of the Treasury, Shultz co-founded the 
‘‘Library Group’’, which helped coordinate 
follow-up to the abolishment of the gold 
standard and the Bretton Woods system and 
develop what would eventually become the 
‘‘Group of Seven’’ or the ‘‘G–7’’, an impor-
tant forum that has strengthened inter-
national economic and security policy by 
regularly bringing together the world’s ad-
vanced economies to assess global trends and 
tackle pervasive and crosscutting issues; 
Whereas Shultz served as Secretary of 
State from 1982 until 1989 and was directly 
involved in bringing Russian President Mi-
khail Gorbachev and President Reagan to-
gether through a process based upon mutual 
and verifiable trust, thereby allowing them 
to reach agreement on the Intermediate- 
Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (the INF Trea-
ty), which eliminated ground-launched bal-
listic and cruise missiles with ranges of be-
tween 500 and 5,500 kilometers, and to ini-
tiate negotiations to reduce long-range stra-
tegic nuclear arms; 
Whereas, during his tenure as Secretary of 
State, Shultz had a strong and mutually sup-
portive relationship with the career Foreign 
Service, which he relied upon heavily to ad-
vance key international initiatives and at-
tain the foreign policy achievements of the 
Reagan Administration; 
Whereas Shultz recognized the need to bet-
ter prepare a new generation of diplomatic 
service officers, whether Foreign or Civil 
Service, and ensured the creation of what be-
came the George P. Shultz National Foreign 
Affairs Training Center (NFATC), thus ex-
panding short-term skills training to hun-
dreds of ever more diverse Department of 
State and Federal Government personnel; 
Whereas, upon returning to private life in 
1989, Shultz became a Distinguished Fellow 
at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, 
wrote and edited several books, and received 
the Presidential Medal of Freedom, along 
with more than a dozen other awards and 
prizes; 
Whereas, in his later years, Shultz passion-
ately advocated for a world without nuclear 
weapons; 
Whereas Shultz recently called for the 
strengthening and modernization of the pro-
fessional education and training of our ca-
reer diplomats: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the life, achievements, and dis-
tinguished public service of the Honorable 
George Pratt Shultz; 
(2) recognizes Shultz on the occasion of his 
100th birthday and expresses its thanks and 
commendations to his family; 
(3) celebrates the statesmanship that has 
consistently characterized Shultz’s life; 
(4) acknowledges Shultz’s published con-
cern for rebuilding and strengthening United 
States diplomacy and its home institution, 
the Department of State, and his call for the 
creation of a school of diplomacy at the Na-
tional Foreign Affairs Training Center; and 
(5) 
commends 
to 
future 
generations 
Shultz’s example as a patriot and public 
servant both in war and in the pursuit of a 
more peaceful, prosperous, and cooperative 
world order.

S. RES. 783 
Whereas hospice and palliative care serv-

United States in need, regardless of age, 
race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, is 
important; 
Whereas hospice and palliative care aims 
to bring patients and family caregivers high- 
quality care delivered by an interdiscipli-
nary team of skilled health care profes-
sionals, including— 
(1) physicians; 
(2) nurses; 
(3) social workers; 
(4) therapists; 
(5) counselors; 
(6) health aides; 
(7) spiritual care providers; and 
(8) other health care professionals; 
Whereas there is a need to increase train-
ing opportunities for health care profes-
sionals to receive interdisciplinary team- 
based training in hospice and palliative care; 
Whereas hospice focuses on quality of life 
through pain management and symptom 
control, caregiver assistance, and emotional 
and spiritual support, with the goal of allow-
ing patients to live fully until the end of life, 
surrounded and supported by loved ones, 
friends, and caregivers; 
Whereas trained hospice and palliative 
care professionals, during a time of trauma 
and loss, can provide grief and bereavement 
support services to individuals with a serious 
illness or injury, the family members of 
those individuals, and others; 
Whereas palliative care is a patient and 
family-centered approach to care that— 
(1) provides relief from symptoms and 
stress; 
(2) can be complementary to curative 
treatments; and 
(3) improves the quality of life of the pa-
tient and their family; 
Whereas, in 2018, more than 1,550,000 indi-
viduals in the United States living with a se-
rious illness or injury, and the families of 
those individuals, received care and support 
from 
hospice 
programs 
in 
communities 
across the United States; 
Whereas volunteers continue to play a 
vital role in supporting hospice care and op-
erations; and 
Whereas hospice and palliative care pro-
viders encourage all patients to learn more 
about their options for care and to share 
their preferences with family, loved ones, 
and health care professionals: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates November 2020 as ‘‘National 
Hospice and Palliative Care Month’’; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States— 
(A) to increase their understanding and 
awareness of— 
(i) care for hospice patients with a serious 
illness or injury; and 
(ii) the benefits of integrating palliative 
care early into the treatment plans for pa-
tients with a serious illness or injury; 
(B) to recognize the care and dedication of 
family caregivers, hospice and palliative 
care volunteers, and hospice and palliative 
care providers; and 
(C) to observe ‘‘National Hospice and Pal-

PORTING 
THE 
GOALS 
AND 
IDEALS OF AMERICAN DIABETES 
MONTH 
Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself and Ms. 
COLLINS) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was

S. RES. 784 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘CDC’’)— 
(1) 34,200,000 individuals in the United 
States have diabetes; and 
(2) an estimated 88,000,000 individuals in 
the United States who are 18 years of age or 
older have prediabetes; 
Whereas diabetes is a serious chronic con-
dition that affects individuals of every age, 
race, ethnicity, and income level; 
Whereas the CDC reports that— 
(1) Hispanic Americans, African Ameri-
cans, Asian Americans, and Native Ameri-
cans are disproportionately affected by dia-
betes and develop the disease at much higher 
rates than the general population of the 
United States; and 
(2) an estimated 21.4 percent of individuals 
with diabetes in the United States have not 
yet been diagnosed with the disease; 
Whereas, in the United States, more than 
10.5 percent of the population, including 26.8 
percent of individuals who are 65 years of age 
or older, have diabetes; 
Whereas, of the 17,400,000 veterans in the 
United States, 8,800,000 who are 65 years of 
age or older, and 1 in 4 overall, are receiving 
care for diabetes from the Department of 
Veterans Affairs; 
Whereas the risk of developing diabetes at 
some point in life is 40 percent for adults in 
the United States; 
Whereas, according to the American Diabe-
tes Association, the United States spent an 
estimated $237,000,000,000 on direct medical 
costs for cases of diagnosed diabetes in 2017, 
and out-of-pocket costs for insulin have 
grown significantly in recent years for many 
patients; 
Whereas the American Diabetes Associa-
tion reports that care for people with diag-
nosed diabetes accounts for 1 in 4 health care 
dollars spent in the United States; 
Whereas the cost of health care is esti-
mated to be 2.3 times higher for individuals 
in the United States with diabetes than 
those without diabetes; 
Whereas, as of November 2020, a cure for di-
abetes does not exist; 
Whereas there are successful means to re-
duce the incidence, and delay the onset, of 
type 2 diabetes; 
Whereas, with proper management and 
treatment, individuals with diabetes live 
healthy and productive lives; and 
Whereas individuals in the United States 
celebrate American Diabetes Month in No-
vember: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Amer-
ican Diabetes Month, including— 
(A) encouraging individuals in the United 
States to fight diabetes through public 
awareness of prevention and treatment op-
tions; and 
(B) enhancing diabetes education; 
(2) recognizes the importance of awareness 
and early detection, including awareness of 
symptoms and risk factors such as— 
(A) being— 
(i) older than 45 years of age; or 
(ii) overweight; and 
(B) having— 
(i) a particular racial and ethnic back-
ground; 
(ii) a low level of physical activity; 
(iii) high blood pressure; 
(iv) a family history of diabetes; or 
(v) a history of diabetes during pregnancy; 
(3) supports decreasing the prevalence of 
type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes in 
the United States through research, treat-
ment, and prevention; and 
(4) recognizes the importance of addressing 
systemic barriers to health care that— 
(A) leave many vulnerable communities at 
a heightened risk for diabetes; and 
(B) limit access to health care resources 
that are needed to effectively prevent the 
onset, and to manage the condition, of diabe-
tes.

lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 785

Whereas, in 2020, an estimated— 
(1) 27,600 cases of stomach cancer will be 
diagnosed in the United States; and 
(2) 11,010 people in the United States will 
die from stomach cancer; 
Whereas the estimated 5-year survival rate 
for stomach cancer is only 32 percent; 
Whereas, in the United States, stomach 
cancer is more prevalent among racial and 
ethnic minorities; 
Whereas increased awareness of, and edu-
cation about, stomach cancer among pa-
tients and health care providers could im-
prove timely recognition of stomach cancer 
symptoms; 
Whereas more research into early diag-
nosis, screening, and treatment for stomach 
cancer is needed; and 
Whereas November 2020 is an appropriate 
month to observe Stomach Cancer Aware-
ness Month: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals of Stomach Cancer 
Awareness Month; 
(2) supports efforts to increase awareness 
of, and education about, stomach cancer 
among the general public of the United 
States; 
(3) recognizes the need for additional re-
search into early diagnosis, screening, and 
treatment for stomach cancer; and

children who— 
(A) achieved permanency through adop-
tion increased for the fifth year in a row; 
and 
(B) entered foster care decreased for the 
third year in a row; 
Whereas, still, for many foster children, 
the wait for a loving family in which they 
are 
nurtured, 
comforted, 
and 
protected 
seems endless; 
Whereas a survey conducted in 2019 showed 
that— 
(1) 21 percent of respondents had consid-
ered or were considering adoption; 
(2) about 1⁄2 of respondents viewed adoption 
through the foster care system favorably; 
and 
(3) of the respondents who had not consid-
ered adoption— 
(A) 20 percent believed that they could 
not afford adoption; and 
(B) 18 percent believed that they would 
be unprepared for the emotional or health 
needs of an adopted child; 
Whereas the Children’s Bureau, an office of 
the Administration for Children and Fami-
lies within the Department of Health and 
Human Services, supports programs, re-
search, and monitoring to help eliminate 
barriers to adoption and find permanent fam-
ilies for children; 
Whereas, every day, loving and nurturing 
families are strengthened and expanded when 
committed and dedicated individuals make 
an important difference in the life of a child 
through adoption; 
Whereas 
the 
coronavirus 
disease 
2019 
(COVID–19) pandemic has presented unprece-
dented challenges to the United States, the 
foster care system, prospective adoptive par-
ents, and the children awaiting permanency; 
Whereas the President traditionally issues 
an annual proclamation to declare the 
month of November as National Adoption 
Month, and the President has proclaimed No-
vember 2020 as National Adoption Month; 
Whereas National Adoption Day has been 
celebrated as a collective national effort to 
find permanent and loving families for chil-
dren in the foster care system; and 
Whereas the Saturday before Thanksgiving 
has been recognized as National Adoption 
Day since at least 2000, and, in 2020, the Sat-
urday before Thanksgiving is November 21: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Adoption Month and National Adop-
tion Day; 
(2) recognizes that every child should have 
a permanent and loving family; and 
(3) encourages the people of the United 
States to consider adoption during the 
month of November and throughout the 
year.

SEC. 7. ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS FOR EMPLOY-
MENT-BASED IMMIGRANTS. 
(a) ADJUSTMENT
OF STATUS
FOR EMPLOY-
MENT-BASED IMMIGRANTS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Section 245 of such Act (8 
U.S.C. 1255) is amended by adding at the end 
the following: 
‘‘(n) ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS FOR EMPLOY-
MENT-BASED IMMIGRANTS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—An alien who has status 
under section 214, other than an alien de-
scribed in subsection (c) (as remedied by sub-
section (k), as amended by the Fairness for 
High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2020) or sub-
paragraph (B) or (C) of section 101(a)(15), and 
any eligible dependents of such alien, who 
has filed a petition or on whose behalf a peti-
tion has been filed for immigrant status pur-
suant to subparagraph (E) or (F) of section 
204(a)(1), may file an application with the 
Secretary of Homeland Security for adjust-
ment of status if such petition was approved 
not less than two years before the date on 
which the application for adjustment of sta-
tus is filed, regardless of whether an immi-
grant visa is immediately available on that 
date. For any dependent child who files an 
application under this subsection, that indi-
vidual may continue to qualify as a depend-
ent child for purposes of the application re-
gardless of the individual’s age or whether 
the principal beneficiary is deceased at the 
time an immigrant visa becomes available. 
Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs 
(3), (4), and (5), an alien who files an applica-
tion under this subsection shall be eligible 
for work authorization and travel permission 
on the same terms as an alien who files an 
application under subsection (a). 
‘‘(2) AVAILABILITY.—An adjustment of sta-
tus application filed pursuant to paragraph 
(1) may not be approved until the date on 
which an immigrant visa becomes available. 
An admissible alien who has properly filed 
such an application shall have the same sta-
tus as an alien who files under subsection 
(a). 
‘‘(3) DUTIES, HOURS, AND
COMPENSATION.— 
The terms and conditions of a qualifying em-
ployment position offered to an alien who 
has filed a petition or on whose behalf a peti-
tion has been filed, for immigrant status 
pursuant to subparagraph (E) or (F) of sec-
tion 204(a)(1), including duties, hours, and 
compensation, during the period following 
the filing of an application for adjustment 
under paragraph (1) and before a visa be-
comes immediately available, must be com-
mensurate with the terms and conditions ap-
plicable to the employer’s similarly situated 
United States workers in the area of employ-
ment. If the employer does not employ and 
has not recently employed more than two 
similarly situated U.S. workers in the area 
of employment, the employer nevertheless 
remains obligated to attest that the terms 
and conditions of the alien’s employment are 
commensurate with the terms and condi-
tions of employment for other similarly situ-
ated United States workers in the area of 
employment. 
‘Similarly 
situated 
United 
States 
workers’ 
includes 
United 
States 
workers performing similar duties, subject 
to similar supervision, and with similar edu-
cational backgrounds, industry expertise, 
employment experience, levels of responsi-
bility, and skill sets as the alien in the same 
geographic area of employment as the alien. 
The duties, hours, and compensation of such 
aliens are ‘commensurate’ with those offered 
to United States workers employed by the 
employer in the same area of employment 
when the employer can show that the duties, 
hours, and compensation are consistent with 
the range of such terms and conditions the 
employer has offered or would offer to simi-
larly situated United States employees. 
‘‘(4) ENFORCEMENT.—A principal applicant 
applying for adjustment pursuant to para-
graph (1) shall file a Confirmation of Bona 
Fide Job Offer or Portability with any re-
quest for an employment authorization docu-
ment. Any employment authorization docu-
ment issued to such a principal applicant 
shall expire after three years, and another

Confirmation of Bona Fide Offer or Port-
ability shall be filed with any request for a 
renewal of employment authorization. No 
final decision on an application under para-
graph (1) may be issued without a filing of a 
Confirmation of Bona Fide Job Offer or Port-
ability by the principal applicant received 
within 12 months of such decision. A prin-
cipal applicant shall provide sufficient infor-
mation to verify compliance with paragraph 
(3), and an indication that the filing is to en-
sure compliance for an adjustment applicant 
under this subsection, when the applicant 
files a Confirmation. A principal applicant 
shall also provide a signed letter from his or 
her current or prospective employer attest-
ing that the terms and conditions of the 
alien’s employment are commensurate with 
the terms and conditions of employment for 
other similarly situated United States work-
ers in the area of employment. If a required 
Confirmation is not timely received by 
United States Citizenship and Immigration 
Services, the underlying Application to Ad-
just Status filed under paragraph (1), includ-
ing the applications for eligible dependents, 
shall be denied. In adjudicating the Applica-
tion to Adjust Status, when an immigrant 
visa becomes available, United States Citi-
zenship and Immigration Services shall re-
quest the filing of a Confirmation of Bona 
Fide Job Offer or Portability if a Confirma-
tion of Bona Fide Job Offer or Portability 
has not been filed within the previous 12 
months and may consider the validity of any 
Confirmation filing that has not already 
been reviewed and found satisfactory. If the 
most recent Confirmation filing or prior fil-
ings not previously found satisfactory do not 
warrant a finding of compliance with section 
204(j) or paragraph (3), United States Citizen-
ship and Immigration Services shall issue a 
Notice of Intent to Deny the underlying Ap-
plication to Adjust Status providing an op-
portunity for further evidence to be sub-
mitted on such deficiency after which any 
applicant that does not meet his or her bur-
den of proof shall receive a denial of the un-
derlying Application to Adjust Status and 
the applications of eligible dependents. 
‘‘(5) LIMITATION ON WORK AUTHORIZATION.— 
An alien who was neither authorized to work 
nor eligible to request work authorization at 
the time an application was filed under para-
graph (1) shall not be eligible to receive work 
authorization pursuant to paragraph (1) or 
section 274a.12(c)(9) of title 8, Code of Federal 
Regulations. 
‘‘(6) CONFIRMATIONS OF BONA FIDE JOB OFFER 
OR PORTABILITY FEE.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.— Notwithstanding any 
other provision of law, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security shall charge and collect 
a fee in the amount of $2,000 for each Con-
firmation of Bona Fide Job Offer or Port-
ability filed under this subsection. 
‘‘(B) DEPOSITS.—The fees collected under 
subparagraph (A) shall be deposited and used 
as follows: 
‘‘(i) Fifty percent of such fees shall be de-
posited into the Immigration Examinations 
Fee Account established by section 286(m) 
and available as provided in this subsection. 
‘‘(ii) Fifty percent of such fees shall be de-
posited into the Treasury as miscellaneous 
receipts.’’.

CONFORMING
AMENDMENT.— 
Section 
245(k) of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act (8 U.S.C. 1255(k)) is amended by adding 
‘‘or (n)’’ after ‘‘pursuant to subsection (a)’’. 
(c) EFFECTIVE DATE.— 
(1) This section and the amendments made 
by this section— 
(A) shall take effect one year after the date 
of enactment of this Act; and 
(B) except as provided in paragraph (2), 
shall cease to have effect as of the date that 
is nine years after that date of enactment. 
(2) This section shall continue in effect 
with respect to any alien who has filed an 
application under this section any time prior 
to the date on which this section otherwise 
ceases to have effect.

H–1B NONIMMIGRANT OR H–4 NON-
IMMIGRANT TO EB IMMIGRANT.

gration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1235),

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1077 
December 2, 2020 
IN HONOR OF MRS. ANNA MAE 
HOOPER DEBRO 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to an inspiring 
woman, educator, and woman of God, Mrs. 
Anna Mae Hooper Debro. Sadly, Mrs. Debro 
passed away on Wednesday, November 25, 
2020, at the remarkable age of 104. But, she 
leaves behind a legacy of impact upon count-
less people whose lives she touched. Her fu-
neral service was held on Wednesday, De-
cember 2, 2020, at the Charles E. Huff Inter-
national Funeral Home, Incorporated in Co-
lumbus, Georgia. 
Mrs. Anna Mae Hooper Debro was born in 
Coffeeville, Mississippi, on October 3, 1916, to 
the union of Reverend Louis W. Hooper and 
Mrs. Minnie Hooper. As the daughter of a 
preacher, she committed her life to being a 
believer and servant of her Lord and Savior, 
Jesus Christ, at a very early age. 
She graduated from Delta Industrial High 
School, a historical boarding school for gifted 
Black children in the Mississippi Delta, before 
earning her undergraduate degree from Alcorn 
and Campbell College in 1941. She continued 
her education at Atlanta University (now Clark 
Atlanta University), where she received her 
Master’s degree in Math Education in 1960. A 
lifelong learner, with an immense passion for 
education, she sought to further her studies at 
the University of Georgia, Florida A & M Uni-
versity, and Tuskegee University as a National 
Science Foundation Scholar. 
Mrs. Debro committed her life to education. 
She held the position of Math Department 
Chair at Carver High School in Columbus, 
Georgia, she was the Tri Hi Y Chair, Student 
Advisor, and the PTA Chairwoman from 1954 
to 1971. Later, she taught at Columbus High 
School from 1971 to 1978, where she was 
among the first African American teachers to 
desegregate the Muscogee County School 
District. Mrs. Debro’s life story was so 
impactful that it was featured in the SIS Oral 
History Project at Spelman College in Atlanta, 
GA. 
In addition to her dedication in the class-
room, she was also a devout servant of God 
and a member of St. Mark A.M.E. Church for 
over 70 years, where she chaired the Wom-
en’s Missionary Society and served in several 
leadership roles. Her pledge to Christ was 
echoed in her compassionate leadership, 
which made her a guiding light within her com-
munity. 
Mother Teresa once said that ‘‘At the end of 
life we will not be judged by how many diplo-
mas we have received, how much money we 
have made, how many great things that we 
have done. We will be judged by ‘‘I was hun-
gry, and you gave me something to eat. I was 
naked, and you clothed me, I was homeless, 
and you took me in.’’ Mrs. Anna Mae Hooper 
Debro lived her life to help other people. Be-
cause of her love for Jesus Christ and her 
service to the least of these, the world is in-
deed a better place. 
Mrs. Debro accomplished much in her life, 
but none of it would have been possible with-
out the Grace of God and the love and sup-
port of her late husband of 30 years, Mr. 
James Debro, Sr.; and her children, James 
Jr., William, Lisa, Harriette, and Dwight. She 
will be greatly missed by her family but will 
also be missed by her community and all of 
those whose lives she touched. 
Madam Speaker, my wife, Vivian, and I, 
along with the more than 730,000 people of 
the Second Congressional District, and all 
those who mourn her loss, salute Mrs. Anna 
Mae Hooper Debro for her lifetime of service 
to humankind. I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join us in extend-
ing our deepest condolences to Mrs. Debro’s 
family during this difficult time of bereavement. 
We pray that they will be consoled and com-
forted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit 
in the days, weeks, and months ahead.

COMMUNITY 
COLLEGE 
BOARD MEMBER, RETIRES 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and recognize the retirement of John 
Pinkerton from the Victor Valley Community 
College Board of Trustees. 
Mr. Pinkerton was first elected to the Victor 
Valley Community College Board of Trustees 
in November of 2012. Since then John has 
worked with the other Trustees to help Victor 
Valley College regain its full accreditation, bal-
ance its budget, and increase its enrollment 
and annual graduates. When John is not serv-
ing as a member of the Board of Trustees, he 
works as a counselor at Silverado High School 
where he helps students in our community not 
just by helping them prepare for college and 
the workforce, but by striving to make a posi-
tive impact in their lives. 
I offer my sincere gratitude to John for his 
many years of service on the Victor Valley 
Community College Board of Trustees and 
wish him the best in his retirement.

HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to 
honor the life of former Seminole Tribe Chair-
man, Max Osceola, Jr. 
We were heartbroken to learn of her pass-
ing and join Floridians in mourning this tre-
mendous loss to the Seminole Tribe and the 
state of Florida. He leaves an unmatched leg-
acy for the Seminole Tribe, South Florida, and 
our nation. 
Max Osceola, Jr.’s tenure on the Hollywood 
Council spanned 25 years, and it was during 
that time, that Seminole Gaming expanded 
and became the pillar of Florida’s gaming in-
dustry. Under his leadership, tribal students 
were afforded scholarships for higher edu-
cation and tribal culture was preserved for fu-
ture generations. 
He always emphasized improving the man-
agement of tribal affairs, whether it was hous-
ing, health, employment training or education 
to advance opportunity for Native American 
youth. Mr. Osceola was a patron of our South 
Florida community and supported numerous 
organizations whose work helps improve our 
surroundings—the Boys & Girls Clubs, the 
Ann Storck Center, and the Victory Junction 
Camp for children with serious medical condi-
tions. 
A graduate of McArthur High School in Hol-
lywood, Mr. Osceola was one of the first tribal 
members to graduate from college, earning his 
degree from the University of Miami. Edu-
cation was paramount to him and while serv-
ing on the tribal council, he created a scholar-
ship to pay for college or vocational school for 
any member of the tribe. 
I join the Seminole Tribe and South Florid-
ians in mourning the loss of an incredible 
mentor, tribal leader, brother, father, grand-
father, and friend. May his memory be a 
blessing.

HONORING TEXAS JUDGE EMILY 
MISKEL 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to recognize Texas Judge Emily Miskel, the 
recipient of the 2020 William H. Renquist 
Award for Judicial Excellence, widely recog-
nized as the highest honor bestowed to a 
state court judge by the National Center for

As the Judge for the 470th District Court in 
Collin County, Judge Miskel is lauded for ris-
ing to meet the challenges posed during the 
pandemic by leading the first-ever remote 
hearing and jury trial in the United States. 
Judge Miskel, a respected authority on legal 
technology, not only took leadership in utilizing 
remote resources in the courts, but also went 
on to train many of Texas’ judges. As a result, 
more than 175,000 virtual hearings have now 
taken place, allowing for continued access to 
fundamental services guaranteed by our Con-
stitution. 
Judge Miskel earned a mechanical engi-
neering degree from Stanford University and

tional Center for State Courts for dem-
onstrating the outstanding qualities of judicial 
excellence—integrity, fairness, open-minded-
ness, knowledge of the law, professional eth-
ics, creativity, sound judgement, intellectual 
courage, and decisiveness, I encourage my 
colleagues in the House of Representatives to 
join me in celebrating her many achievements 
in the area of judicial excellence and leader-

TRIBUTE TO JOHN BAYLISS, 
LOGAN COUNTY COMMISSIONER 
HON. JIM JORDAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to pay tribute to Logan County Commis-
sioner John F. Bayliss of Rushsylvania, Ohio. 
John will retire at the end of this year after 
nearly a quarter-century of outstanding service 
to the people of Logan County. 
Throughout his six terms on the Board of 
Commissioners—making him the longest-serv-
ing commissioner in Logan County history— 
John has become known for his superb man-
agement skills. His years of experience in the 
private sector, both as the owner of a residen-
tial building and remodeling company and as 
a farmer, prepared him well for the diverse fis-
cal challenges of local government. 
During his time in office, John has served 
on numerous boards and committees, includ-
ing the Logan County Community Improve-
ment Board, the Local Emergency Planning 
Committee, and several committees of the 
County Commissioners Association of Ohio. 
He is also a past county president of the Ohio 
Farm Bureau and a past county and state 
president of the Ohio Sheep Improvement As-
sociation. 
A graduate of The Ohio State University, 
John and his wife of 44 years, Sharon, are the 
proud parents of three children: Brian, Court-
ney, and Brendan. They especially enjoy 
spending time with their seven grandchildren. 
John’s colleagues and friends will gather on 
December 8 to celebrate his many contribu-
tions and distinguished record. On behalf of 
the people of Ohio’s Fourth Congressional 
District, I am proud to join in the accolades to 
him for his many years of fine public service. 
We wish him and his family every success as 
they move to a new chapter in their lives.

WEDDING CONGRATULATIONS FOR 
JOHN 
LYNCH 
AND 
ALEXA 
PAPADOPOULOS 
HON. TJ COX 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize and congratulate Mr. John 
Lynch and Ms. Alexa Papadopoulos on their 
upcoming wedding. John was an instrumental 
part of my team and I am honored to call him 
a friend and a colleague. He and Alexa are 
fine examples of young men and women who 
have stepped up to work in government to 
make a positive difference in the lives of all 
Americans through their efforts, capability and 
professionalism. 
As our Senior Legislative Assistant, John 
has shown great attentiveness and care for 
some of the most pressing issues of the Cen-
tral Valley—water infrastructure, economic 
growth and public policy. John’s tireless work 
serving our communities is invaluable, and his 
work on water policy will certainly carry on 
helping thousands of people here in the Val-
ley. John ties our team together with his per-
sonality and humor, all while continuing his 
vital service to so many individuals and com-
munities. 
I offer my warmest congratulations and best 
wishes to John and Alexa as they begin this 
new chapter in their lives. We all join their 
family and friends in celebrating this wonderful 
milestone. I ask my colleagues in the U.S. 
House of Representatives to join me in cele-
brating this couple. We wish them well as they 
continue to build a happy, healthy life to-
gether.

HONORING THE LIFE OF WORLD 
WAR I AND II VETERAN EXIQUEL 
IGLESIAS DE LEON 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the life of World War 
I and II veteran Exiquel Iglesias De Leon and 
his unquestionable dedication to family and 
country. 
At only nineteen years old, Exiquel coura-
geously enlisted in the Navy during the height 
of World War I. Twenty-six years after his hon-
orable service, he subsequently re-enlisted in 
the United States Naval Reserve to serve dur-
ing World War II. Exiquel continued his service 
for another eight years with the Naval Re-
serve, stationed at the Eleventh Naval District. 
For nearly the remainder of his life, he put in 
hard work as a rigger at the Mare Island Navy 
Yard in Vallejo, California. 
A native Guamanian, Exiquel became a nat-
uralized United States citizen on November 3, 
1944, following his decades of honorable serv-
ice to our country. Never forgetting his roots, 
he made frequent trips to Long Beach to par-
ticipate in community events to celebrate the 
Guamanian people. He believed strongly in 
celebrating his culture’s traditions and the di-
versity of American culture. As a new Amer-
ican citizen, Exiquel proudly became a Cali-
fornia homeowner, residing in Compton, Cali-
fornia with his family for the remainder of his 
life. 
His family remembers him as a great cook 
who always ‘‘cooked with love’’ and as an avid 
boxing fan. Exiquel and his family frequently 
took the ‘‘Red Car’’ out on weekends to the 
Grand Central Market in Los Angeles to enjoy 
time together and with their community. 
For his exemplary life of service, Madam 
Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Exiquel 
Iglesias De Leon on the House floor. As dem-
onstrated by his commitment to American val-
ues, service in two World Wars, admirable 
work ethic, and tenure as an upstanding cit-
izen, Exiquel is the American Dream personi-
fied. May he rest in peace.

LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS OF 
SCARSDALE 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is an honor 
to recognize one of the finest civic organiza-
tions in my district, the League of Women Vot-
ers of Scarsdale, which in January, 2021 will 
be celebrating its incredible 100th Anniversary. 
The Scarsdale League of Women Voters is 
a nonpartisan political organization that grew 
out of the suffrage movement. There were 
many suffragists in Scarsdale and West-
chester over 100 years ago, fighting for the 
right for women to vote in public elections. 
Over its 100 years, the League has worked to 
protect and expand voting rights in our area. 
Their mission is to promote civic engagement, 
to communicate clear voter information, includ-
ing on the ways to vote, dates of voting, and 
to help voters understand candidate and policy 
positions prior to elections. The League prides 
itself on holding Candidate Forum events in 
order to help our community members, from 
Scarsdale and beyond, make informed deci-
sions at the polls. 
In addition, The Scarsdale League studies 
selected governmental issues every year and 
creates statements through a consensus proc-
ess. They also organize various speaker 
events for our community and engage in civics 
education in the local schools, programming 
that is particularly important now at this mo-
ment in our history. 
Madam Speaker, the League of Women 
Voters of Scarsdale is an active local commu-
nity organization and they are very excited to 
be reaching this 100-year milestone. I too am 
excited that I get to share this wonderful cen-
tennial anniversary with them, and I congratu-
late their team on continuing to raise the bar 
on civic engagement in New York’s 16th Con-
gressional District.

IN HONOR OF SENATOR MARTHA 
FULLER CLARK 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor State Senator Martha Fuller Clark, 
who is retiring from public service after three 
decades of service to the people of New 
Hampshire. She has been a fierce advocate 
for the Seacoast, first serving as a State Rep-
resentative for 12 years before serving as a 
State Senator for 12 years. 
During our time serving in the state Legisla-
ture together, I saw firsthand Senator Fuller 
Clark’s passion, grace, and civility. She is 
unflaggingly committed to the ideals of public 
service, always bringing the voices and experi-
ences of those she represents with her to in-
form her work in Concord. Senator Fuller

Clark has also served as a mentor to so many 
women in public service, both in New Hamp-
shire politics and across the nation through 
her involvement with the Democratic National 
Committee. 
Throughout her career, Senator Fuller Clark 
has been a champion for women’s rights and 
equality, always standing up to advocate for 
reproductive rights and to make all work-
places, including New Hampshire’s State 
House, more accommodating and welcoming. 
In addition, Senator Fuller Clark has been a 
leader on energy and environmental issues, 
putting forth ambitious and durable ap-
proaches to put our state on a pathway to a 
low-carbon future. She has been a stalwart 
supporter of the arts and historic preservation, 
and I know her commitment to these issues 
will continue through her involvement with 
Strawbery Banke and the National Trust for 
Historic Preservation. 
While Senator Fuller Clark may be stepping 
away from elected office, I know she will con-
tinue to serve our community in many ways. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I thank 
Senator Fuller Clark and her family for their 
decades of dedication to our state. The Gran-
ite State is a better place because of the pub-
lic service of Senator Martha Fuller Clark.

HONORING VALERIE EMICK FOR 
HER LIFELONG COMMITMENT TO 
CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Valerie Emick, a lifelong conservative 
advocate and outgoing president of the Hi- 
Desert Republican Women Federated. 
Valerie has served the Hi-Desert Republican 
Women Federated in various capacities for 
over two decades. Her tenure with the chapter 
has been marked by an expansion in the 
club’s membership, a commitment to serving 
the community, and a strong focus on con-
servative values. More recently, she has been 
responsible for securing outstanding speakers 
for Hi-Desert Republican Women Federated 
events, including conservative commentator 
Dinesh D’Souza and Benghazi survivor Kris 
‘‘Tanto’’ Paranto. She has also led the com-
munity in supporting our first responders, 
which included purchasing billboard space 
thanking law enforcement for their hard work 
protecting our community. In addition to her 
work with the Hi-Desert Republican Women 
Federated, Valerie is also an elected member 
of the San Bernardino County Republican 
Party Central Committee, a position she was 
resoundingly re-elected to earlier this year. 
Valerie is the epitome of a grassroots, con-
servative champion. Her hard work has ad-
vanced our principles and beliefs in the High 
Desert for decades, and as I depart Congress, 
I am happy to take this chance to honor her 
work and achievements. 
RECOGNIZING MISS EMMA VANA 
OF PUNTA GORDA 
HON. W. GREGORY STEUBE 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mr. STEUBE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Miss Emma Vana for her out-
standing efforts to show appreciation to our 
law enforcement officers. 
Emma is a 9-year-old resident of Punta 
Gorda, Florida. Since July, Emma has handed 
out over 250 homemade blue line flags to law 
enforcement officers across Florida to thank 
them for their service to our community. She 
has passed out flags in Alachua, Charlotte, 
Collier, Columbia, DeSoto, Hamilton, Hendry, 
Lee, Levy, Madison, Manatee, Polk, Sarasota, 
and Suwanee Counties so far. However, this 
is only the start for her efforts to give our 
members of law enforcement the appreciation 
and support they deserve. 
When asked why she appreciates law en-
forcement officers, Emma explains that they 
‘‘put bad people in jail and protect our commu-
nities.’’ As Emma understands, Florida is 
home to some of our nation’s finest law en-
forcement officers who risk their lives every 
day to ensure our communities and families 
are safe. 
Emma’s effort to show appreciation comes 
during a time when law enforcement officers 
across the country face threats and physical 
attacks from those calling to defund the police. 
Emma should be a role model for all Florid-
ians and Americans in standing up to defend 
the police, not defund them. 
I am honored to have the privilege to rep-
resent 
outstanding 
constituents 
such 
as 
Emma. Her selfless acts of kindness inspire all 
of us as she continues to go above and be-
yond for Floridians. It is individuals like her 
who make Florida and America great.

HONORING SARA WYFFELS AS AR-
IZONA’S 2021 TEACHER OF THE 
YEAR 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor and congratulate Sara Wyffels for being 
named the 2021 Arizona Teacher of the Year 
by the Arizona Educational Foundation. Mrs. 
Wyffels has dedicated her 14-year career to 
serving her students and community as a 
Spanish teacher at Chandler High School. 
Her selection for Teacher of the Year comes 
at a time when Arizona’s educators face un-
precedented challenges, yet Mrs. Wyffels has 
risen to the occasion each step of the way. 
Every day, Mrs. Wyffels puts her students first 
and strives to motivate and inspire through 
boundless enthusiasm, kindness, and compas-
sion. Although this past school year was un-
like any other for teachers throughout our 
country, she continued to bring new ideas and 
life to her classroom, both in-person and vir-
tually. Her lessons immerse students in a new 
culture and emphasize the power of language 
in forming human connections. Mrs. Wyffels 
pulls from her own experiences as she teach-
es her students to listen and connect with one 
another and broadens their worldview, helping 
them reach their full potential. 
In her work, Mrs. Wyffels has created more 
equitable conditions for teachers and students 
in the Chandler Unified School District, in our 
community, and throughout Arizona. Since she 
began teaching, her tireless devotion to stu-
dents has served as an example of what can 
be accomplished when young adults are em-
powered with the tools to explore, discover, 
and achieve their highest aspirations. Mrs. 
Wyffels’ students leave her classroom and 
enter the world with a greater appreciation for 
the differences that make us all unique, a 
deep respect for others, and a passion for cre-
ating positive change as global citizens. 
I am proud to recognize Mrs. Wyffels for her 
extraordinary service and the difference she 
has made both inside and outside the class-
room. She is a National Board-Certified 
Teacher and a member of the Chandler Edu-
cation Association. Mrs. Wyffels chose to be-
come a teacher to inspire and help change the 
lives of her students, and we are all grateful 
for her work as a teacher, role model, and 
mentor. I wish her the best as she continues 
to inspire her students to create a better and 
brighter future for Arizona.

Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to 
recognize the remarkable career of Monica 
Russo. 
After decades of service, Ms. Russo is retir-
ing as Executive Vice President of 1199SEIU 
United Healthcare Workers East—the largest 
local union in the nation representing more 
than 400,000 healthcare workers in five states 
and more than 25,000 healthcare workers in 
Florida. 
Ms. Russo is recognized for having led the 
most successful private sector healthcare 
union organizing campaign in the southeastern 
United States, now known as 1199SEIU Flor-
ida. Under her leadership, 1199SEIU Florida 
has grown to represent more than 35,000 
healthcare workers and retirees in more than 
100 hospitals and nursing homes across the 
state—becoming 
the 
largest 
union 
of 
healthcare workers in Florida and the southern 
United States. 
She also serves as International Vice Presi-
dent of the Service Employees International 
Union and as President of the SEIU Florida 
State Council, where she politically unites 
more than 55,000 active and retired SEIU 
members from bus drivers and janitors to 
healthcare workers. 
Through 
Monica 
Russo’s 
leadership, 
1199SEIU Florida members are the go-to 
base to ‘‘make things happen.’’ Her emphasis 
on multi-cultural leadership development and 
grassroots, member-driven organization build-
ing has given a voice and power to healthcare 
workers, women, immigrants, working-class, 
professionals and low-wage workers. 
From raising quality standards for 80,000 el-
derly residents in Florida’s nursing homes to

passing cutting-edge legislation which in-
creased the state minimum wage for millions 
of workers, Monica has dedicated her life’s 
work to protecting voter rights, mobilizing 
some of the largest civil rights protests in Flor-
ida’s history, reducing class sizes in Florida’s 
schools, advocating for immigrants’ rights, im-
plementing safe staffing levels in Florida’s 
nursing homes and led the charge to institute 
the state’s first early voting process so work-
ing people can make their votes count. 
Her commitment to building new leaders 
and developing a legacy of partnership and 
collaboration in Florida has helped build an in-
fluential grassroots political base. She was the 
first labor leader to serve as a commissioner 
on Florida’s Commission for Women and was 
named the Top 40 Most Powerful Democrats 
by Politics Magazine in 2009. 
Ms. Russo has served on the South Florida 
Workforce Investment Board, Florida Inter-
national University’s Research Institute for So-
cial and Economic Policy and has worked 
closely with me as a trusted and valued advi-
sor to my Healthcare Working Group. 
The daughter of Lincoln University profes-
sors, Monica grew up in rural Pennsylvania 
and speaks English, Spanish, Portuguese, 
French and Haitian Kreyol. She graduated 
magna cum laude from Georgetown University 
and lives in Miami with her daughter, 
Giovanna. 
Monica Russo’s commitment to our nation’s 
working families is exemplary, and I am proud 
to call her my sister and dear and treasured 
friend. I will miss her guidance and wisdom, 
but our loss is her family’s gain. I wish her a 
hearty congratulations on her retirement and 
am grateful for her invaluable work.

HONORING MAYOR FREDERICK 
LEDESMA 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor retiring Mayor of Soledad, Frederick 
‘‘Fred’’ Ledesma, for his outstanding career in 
public service and his commitment to the peo-
ple of the central coast of California. His pro-
fessional accomplishments and leadership in 
the community over the span of two decades 
have profoundly touched the lives of many, 
and I congratulate him on his retirement. 
Fred has been a lifelong resident of the City 
of Soledad. Following in the footsteps of his 
father, Frank Ledesma, Fred served on the 
Soledad City Council from 1990 to 2000. He 
then held the position of Mayor of the City of 
Soledad from 1992 to 1994 prior to returning 
to the office in 2010. During his time serving 
the City of Soledad, Fred has been heavily in-
volved in a number of notable projects, includ-
ing the Soledad Community Center, Vosti, 
Gallardo and Aaroe Park improvements, the 
Soledad Visitor’s Center, the pending multi- 
theater cinema, the Soledad Hartnell Campus 
and Orchard Lane Park, and the recent cre-
ation of the Veterans Day Banner Program. 
Additionally, Fred has been a diligent voice for 
farmworker rights as well as a strong advocate 
for the passage of Measures Y and S, which 
will benefit the City and its residents for many 
years to come. 
In addition to serving on numerous local and 
regional boards, including the City Parks & 
Recreation Committee, the Chair of the Asso-
ciation of California Cities Allied with Public 
Safety, the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution 
Control District, and the Monterey County 
Mayors Association, Fred has also been a 
friend to many in his community. He is well 
known by all for his outgoing demeanor, sense 
of humor, and respect for all. He has truly 
demonstrated a deep connection and commit-
ment to his community, which has been felt by 
everyone who has had the pleasure of meet-
ing him. 
As he begins his retirement, I have no doubt 
that Fred will continue to serve his community. 
We on the Central Coast are grateful for his 
lifetime of service to the City of Soledad and 
20 years as a public official. Madam Speaker, 
I ask that my colleagues in the House join me 
in honoring and congratulating Mayor Fred-
erick Ledesma.

teams for over 40 years, it is clear that 
Sheila’s incredibly strong and caring soul 
made her a central part of her community. We 
have lost a great leader, a tremendous moth-
er, and a dear friend. 
Sheila dedicated her life to God and to oth-
ers. She radiated a vibrant, tenacious spirit 
that made it known she was a child of God, 
drove her to serve, and that infected others. 
Her spirituality was present in everything she 
did and anyone that met her knew she was 
grounded in her faith. Her courage and deter-
mination was evident when she journeyed 
from Saint Louis du Nord, Haiti to Freeport, 
Bahamas and finally to the United States. She 
embodied the immigrant spirit and the Amer-
ican dream. Sheila carried her successful 
business to Fort Lauderdale, and expanded it 
into a thriving storefront and ventured into real 
estate, forever embedding her legacy in the 
community. 
Sheila forged strong connections with every-
one she met and exemplified what it means to 
be a child of Christ through her generosity and 
kindness. She would feed anyone who came 
to her house and extended her hand to any-
one in need. She always went above and be-
yond to improve the lives of those around her. 
To Sheila, family was of the upmost impor-
tance. She was the proud wife of the late 
Alberto Michael Joseph and the proud mother 
of eight biological children: Alberta, Duval, 
Rosianne, Ilinda, Ancelot (AJ), Guillene, Ber-
nadette, and Carole. As an immigrant she 
faced many hardships and made great sac-
rifices for her children, and strove to improve 
the circumstances of all, so they may benefit 
from an education, an opportunity she valued 
immensely. In addition to her immediate fam-
ily, she was the adopted mother to hundreds 
of children which she considered her own. 
Sheila was a caring and selfless mother to all 
who had the privilege to know her. She was 
a true trailblazer, a steady leader and care-
giver, and lived her life the way we should all 
strive to, with an abundance of love. 
Madam Speaker, Ms. Sheila Paul has in-
deed left an indelible mark on her loved ones 
and her community, and it will be present for 
future generations to come. She will be dearly 
missed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1081 
December 2, 2020 
IN HONOR OF MRS. GRACE VIR-
GINIA RICHARDSON HUMPHREY 
CUTTS 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to an inspiring 
woman, respected community leader, and a 
transgenerational pillar in Dawson, Georgia— 
Mrs. Grace Virginia Richardson Humphrey 
Cutts. Sadly, Mrs. Cutts passed away on 
Tuesday, November 17, 2020, at the remark-
able age of 108. But she leaves behind a leg-
acy of impact upon countless people whose 
lives she touched. Her funeral service was 
held on Tuesday, December 1, 2020, at 11 
am at the Adoration Temperance Obedience 
Charity (ATOC) African Methodist Episcopal 
(AME) Church in Dawson, Georgia. 
Mrs. Grace Virginia Richardson Humphrey 
Cutts was born on March 2, 1912, in Dawson, 
Georgia, to the union of Walter Revenna Rich-
ardson and Clara Louise Cochran Richardson. 
Mrs. Cutts was a person who overcame 
many obstacles to make a difference in the 
lives of others. She was raised in a time dur-
ing which African Americans were limited in 
their opportunities to better themselves. But, 
Mrs. Cutts was undeterred and set out on a 
path to overcome all obstacles that would pre-
vent her from carrying out God’s calling upon 
her life. 
She graduated from Allen Normal and In-
dustrial High School and enrolled in Georgia 
Normal and Agricultural College—now Albany 
State University, graduating in 1949. 
She served as a teacher for 45 years, using 
her gifts to impact the lives of thousands of 
young people who went on to achieve in no 
small part because of her influence. Even after 
she retired, she continued to make a dif-
ference in the lives of young people through 
tutoring and mentoring. 
The course and the direction of her life were 
set by the name she was given at birth— 
Grace. She was proud of her character and 
used that character to exhibit grace and com-
passion to all with whom she came in contact. 
She kept God as the center of her life and the 
captain of her ship. She was a member of the 
ATOC AME Church for an astonishing 102 
years. Besides being the Mother of the 
Church, she served during various times as 
the church pianist, secretary, and Stewardess. 
In addition to being dedicated to her church 
and her community, she was a wife, mother, 
grandmother, and great grandmother. Her 
family was always supportive and through the 
years, allowed her to give her time and treas-
ure to God and her community. She was mar-
ried to the late Calvin Homer Humphrey and 
the late Sammie Lee Cutts; was the loving 
mother to the late Calvin Walter Humphrey; 
and she was a doting grandmother and great 
grandmother. 
Former Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm 
once said that ‘‘If they don’t give you a seat 
at the table, bring a folding chair.’’ We are so 
thankful that Mrs. Grace Cutts always brought 
a folding chair and used her life’s work to 
make a difference. 1 Peter 4:10 says, ‘‘Each 
of you should use whatever gift you have re-
ceived to serve others as faithful stewards of 
God’s grace in its various forms.’’ Mrs. Cutts 
exemplified that grace because of her faith in 
God and used God’s grace to serve others in 
a mighty way. To God Be The Glory for the 
amazing and meaningful life of Mrs. Grace Vir-
ginia Richardson Humphrey Cutts. 
Madam Speaker, my wife, Vivian and I, 
along with the more than 730,000 people of 
the Second Congressional District, and all 
those who mourn her loss, salute Mrs. Grace 
Virginia Richardson Humphrey Cutts for her 
lifetime of service to humankind. I ask my col-
leagues in the House of Representatives to 
join us in extending our deepest condolences 
to Mrs. Cutts’ family during this difficult time of 
bereavement. We pray that they will be con-
soled and comforted by an abiding faith and 
the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months 
ahead.

VICTORVILLE CITY COUNCIL 
MEMBER JIM COX RETIRES 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and recognize the retirement of Jim Cox 
from the Victorville City Council. 
Jim was first named Victorville City Manager 
in 1969, and held that position until 2000. He 
returned after a brief departure to serve as 
City Manager again from 2009 to 2012. During 
his time as City Manager, he won a number 
of accolades and was appointed to several re-
gional boards and commissions, highlighting 
the expertise he displayed as he worked on 
behalf of Victorville residents. In 2012, Jim 
was elected to the Victorville City Council, 
where he served two terms. 
Jim’s time on the council has been marked 
by successes in Victorville, including the La 
Mesa/Nisqualli Bridge and interchange project. 
He has governed with decency and decorum, 
and has always place an emphasis on com-
munity service. His work with Rotary Inter-
national, as well as his ex-officio membership 
of the Victor Valley Chamber of Commerce 
Board of Directors, has impacted his commu-
nity just as deeply as his government service. 
I offer my sincere congratulations to Jim on a 
well deserved retirement, and wish him the 
best as he moves to the next chapter of his 
life.

REMEMBERING RITA MARIE BRUS 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to include in the RECORD 
the following obituary for Rita Marie Brus. 
Rita Marie Brus, age 91, passed away on 
November 27, 2020. She was the beloved wife 
of the late James Brus, Sr. Rita was born on 
November 13, 1929 to the late Joseph and the 
late Florence Choiniere. Dear mother of the 
late James Brus, Jr. Mother-in-law to Kath-
leen Brus. Cherished grandmother to Mat-
thew Brus, and Kimberly (Patrick) Lusch. 
Adored 
great-grandmother 
to 
Kylan, 
Kinsleigh, and Kamden Lusch. Loving sister 
to Sister Mary Choiniere SSJ, Margaret 
(Harvey) Richardson, the late Joseph (the 
late Georgina) Choiniere, the late Berna-
dette (Ralph) Dunnigan, and the late Robert 
Choiniere. Rita was loved by many nieces, 
nephews, great-nieces, and great-nephews. 
When the love of her life died young, Rita 
went back to school and became a dietary 
supervisor. She spent years working at St. 
John Nursing Home in Detroit. She cher-
ished her time with her grandchildren, 
spending weekends with them. She was a de-
vout Catholic, and sponsored numerous peo-
ple through confirmation. Rita was God-
mother to over eight family members. She 
held a special place in her heart for those 
with disabilities, including two great nieces, 
and donated time with the Special Olympics. 
Widowed for 40 years, Rita instilled the im-
portance of Catholic values, such as attend-
ing Mass and the Sacraments, in her family. 
Her 
husband’s 
Upper 
Peninsula 
roots 
rubbed off on Rita, as she passed on her love 
of cooking pasties and other comfort foods. 
She loved a great family gossip conversation 
and as a result, you always knew where you 
stood with Rita! Conversations with Rita al-
ways started with her asking how her grand-
children and great-grandchildren were. Her 
great-grandchildren loved being pushed on 
her walker as they raced down the hallways. 
She shared a special bond with her sister, 
Margaret. Also of great importance to Rita 
were her many nieces and nephews, all of 
whom she treated like her own. 
Despite suffering through many losses, in-
cluding that of her husband and her only son, 
Rita instilled in her family the importance 
of always putting God first. 
How blessed we are to have had Rita in our 
lives! Heaven has gained a spunky angel!
