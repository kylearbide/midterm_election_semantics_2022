PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
God, Father of us all, thank You for 
giving us another day. Inspire the men 
and women of Congress during this 
time of social distancing to find ways 
of serving their constituents and our 
Nation as best they can. May their ef-
forts and cooperative work with local 
government efforts help to lift those 
Americans who struggle most in these 
days. 
So many habits and traditions are 
scattered by this horrible pandemic. In 
the wake of this past weekend, let us 
not forget the great sacrifice of years, 
some freedoms, and even life, of those 
who chose or have chosen to serve our 
Nation in the Armed Forces. We thank 
You, and them, for their gift of self in 
service to a greater cause. 
As the summer begins, may all Amer-
icans remain vigilant in honoring their 
neighbors with their respect of appro-
priate distance and attention to the 
danger of the coronavirus. Keep us safe 
and continue to bless those engaged in 
addressing this disease directly. 
May everything done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Kent Cornish, who is 
retiring from the Kansas Association of Broad-
casters after serving as the President and Ex-
ecutive Director for 12 years. 
Kent, a graduate of the University of Kan-
sas, has nearly 25 years of broadcasting ex-
perience in Kansas and is a tireless advocate 
for the local broadcasting community. He start-
ed his career as news reporter, anchor and 
assistant news director at WIBW until serving 
as executive director of the Kansas Manufac-
tured Housing Institute in 1980. Kent returned 
to WIBW a few years later and was named 
program director/operations manager. He also 
spent 10 years at KTKA TV in Topeka before 
becoming vice president/general manager at 
KSAS/KMTW in Wichita. 
Kent has left a lasting mark on Kansas. He 
has earned numerous broadcast awards in-
cluding the Grover Cobb award from the Uni-
versity of Kansas and General Manager of the 
Year from the Broadcast Professionals of 
Wichita. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating Kent Cornish on his years of dedi-
cation and outstanding service to Kansas. On 
behalf of Kansas’ Third District, we are so 
proud of Kent’s hard work and wish him the 
best in the next chapter of his life.

Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the incredible effort to feed our com-
munity that is being done by Alexandra 
Castillo, a nine-year-old girl from Friendswood, 
Texas. 
As we continue to weather the economic im-
pact of the coronavirus, some in our commu-
nity face a choice between shelter and food. 
Alexandra is helping some avoid making that 
choice. 
Alexandra was already sewing masks and 
giving them to those in need, but knew she 
could do more to help those around her. See-
ing her neighbors go hungry, Alexandra had 
the idea of opening up a food pantry so that 
they could get the groceries they need. 
When her mom heard about the idea, she 
got the word out on social media. Soon after, 
their neighbors came together to give their 
supplies and their time to make Alexandra’s 
idea a reality. 
Alexandra’s ingenuity and compassion illus-
trate how one person can help an entire com-
munity in tough times. On behalf of the Twen-
ty-Second Congressional District of Texas, we 
thank Alexandra—a young girl providing an 
example of selfless leadership to people of all 
ages.

RECOGNIZING A BEAUTIFUL RE-
MEMBRANCE OF NATIVE AMER-
ICAN AND APACHE VETERANS 
HON. TOM O’HALLERAN 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 26, 2020 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to include in the RECORD the below 
piece, by Chairman Terry Rambler of the San 
Carlos Apache Tribe, which appeared in In-
dian Country Today in remembrance of Me-
morial Day. Chairman Rambler’s piece is an 
excellent example of how we should honor 
Native American Veterans, and all Veterans, 
on Memorial Day. 
Hello everyone. I will share with you some 
thoughts about Memorial Day. It is a day to 
honor our fallen heroes, a day to look at the 
flag and to remember the sacrifices made by 
our military members, to honor their place 
of final rest. For some, this is a day for pic-
nics, family gatherings, and barbeques, but 
it is so much more. 
For the past two months, we all have been 
consumed with the coronavirus. These are 
dark, fearful times. Congress has spent more 
than $6 trillion on mitigation and economic 
recovery. Some 38 million Americans are un-
employed. One in four businesses have closed 
temporarily, another 100,000 have gone out of 
business or declared bankruptcy, and some 
7.5 million small businesses are at risk of 
closing permanently. Over 1.5 million Ameri-
cans have been infected by this virus, and 
over 98,000 have died. 
We have lived with a fear of a kind not 
known in our lifetimes. We wash our hands, 
sanitize, avoid crowds and keep everyone 6 
feet or more away. Some liken this to a war. 
But it is not. 
War happens when countries fight over 
ideals with known enemies. War happens on 
a battlefield. War brings a different sense of 
fear than this virus. 
War happens when presidents and kings 
make their citizens warriors. Warriors put 
their lives at risk for what their flag stands 
for—God and country, patriotism, nation-
hood, protection of the homeland. 
The smell and sound of war create horror 
and shock. In war, blood is spilled, lives are 
shattered, people are traumatized, many are 
maimed for life; others are permanently 
scarred mentally and spiritually, and lives 
are blown apart. Through it all, warriors 
fight to the death. 
That is what our military forces do—they 
do as they are ordered; they fight to the 
death, for their flag, for their homeland, for 
the ideals of their country. Many fight with 
courage. Many fight with fear wrapped tight-
ly around their heart. 
Today, this Memorial Day, without ques-
tion, every American must honor those who 
died fighting for our great country and its 
ideals of democracy, freedom, equality and 
liberty. Our fallen warriors are our heroes, 
after all. They fought and sacrificed them-
selves for our greater good when we could 
not. 
For these reasons Memorial Day is the day 
when we honor our fallen military warriors, 
our heroes. This day is thus a solemn day, 
one that was created out of respect for the 
more than 1 million soldiers who have died 
in the field of combat over the history of the 
United States. 
As President Obama once said, Memorial 
Day is the day ‘‘when we recall all those who 
gave everything in the darkness of war so we 
could stand here in the glory of Spring.’’ 
Apaches, too, have served with valor and 
distinction. Many did not come home. They 
made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. 
Of the many, many Apache warriors who 
died in the field of combat, the late United 
States Army PFC Ernest Stanley comes to 
mind. Private Stanley served with the 333rd 
Infantry Regiment and 84th Infantry Divi-
sion. He was killed in action during the Bat-
tle of the Bulge. In December 1944, 410,000 
German troops surged into Belgium, France 
and Luxembourg. During the 40 day battle, 
there were 89,000 American casualties and 
19,000 killed. 
Private Stanley died over 5,000 miles from 
home on a severely cold, winter day. He was 
a volunteer, a lone Apache warrior. He joined 
the Army to fight for our country. He fought 
for what was right. He fought against the 
tyranny of fascism and the racist hatred 
that the Nazis stood for. And, Private Stan-
ley did so willingly and with his brothers at 
arms, because theirs was a fight for peace 
and humanity itself—that is the true irony 
of war; to fight for peace and security. 
I thought of Private Stanley when I visited 
the American Indian Veterans National Me-
morial located at the Heard Museum. The 
Memorial honors the service and sacrifice of 
tribal members spanning more than 300 
years. In the Memorial stands a sculpture 
known as Unconquered II, by Chiricahua 
Apache sculptor Allan Houser. It shows two 
Apache Scouts, one standing, holding a rifle; 
the other kneeling, holding a spear—both 
look out in the same direction, their eyes 
fixed on something in the distance. They are 
ready—ready to fight. These two bronze fig-
ures stand for all warriors, past and present. 
Looking at that sculpture, one word comes 
to mind, Ahi’yi’e´ (thank you). Join with me 
and give thanks to all our fallen Apache war-
riors. Give thanks to those Apache warriors 
that died fighting for our Tribe and America, 
because they did so for our freedom and our 
liberty. We must all provide our deep, deep 
respects to our fallen warriors who, like Pri-
vate Stanley, exemplify bravery, honor, 
courage, and service. 
Barbeques and family picnics are a good 
thing. Many do this on Memorial Day. But 
this Memorial Day, I urge you to take a mo-
ment, honor our fallen heroes. Give thanks 
for those who you can name, and for those 
whose names have been forgotten to time. 
Their lives were sacrificed for an ideal—the 
American dream. They gave everything up 
for their homeland, so that our Reservation 
and all of America remains safe and pro-
tected. They gave their lives so that we can 
be here on this clear, beautiful Spring day. 
May our Creator God bless our fallen war-
riors. God bless you and your families. God 
bless America. Ahi’yi’e´.

COOPERATION WITH TURKEY IN 
FIGHTING COVID–19 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 26, 2020 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, the U.S. received two shipments of 
medical supplies from the Republic of Turkey 
to assist with our coronavirus response. On 
April 28, Turkey provided us with 500,000 sur-
gical masks and 400 N95 masks, as well as 
protective clothing, disinfectant, goggles, and 
face shields. Two days later on April 30, a 
second shipment including personal protective 
equipment, masks, hazmat suits and disinfect-
ants also arrived from Turkey. In a show of 
solidarity, our U.S. Ambassador to Turkey 
David Satterfield and the Turkish Deputy For-
eign Minister, Selim Yavuz Kiran, were to-
gether watching as the second plane departed 
Turkey. 
We are grateful to our strong ally Turkey for 
its generosity and leadership, and look forward 
to continued close cooperation into the future 
in fighting COVID–19 and also working to-
gether on many important issues of mutual 
concern.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
BROOKWOOD 
COMMUNITY FOR FEEDING OUR 
FRONT LINE MEDICAL PROFES-
SIONALS 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 26, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the hard-working and dedicated 
Brookwood Community citizens who have 
stepped up to help our hospital heroes fighting 
COVID–19. 
The Brookwood Community has been serv-
ing adults with disabilities since 1985, pro-
viding them with opportunity and the dignity 
that comes with work. Unfortunately, social 
distancing and quarantining has prevented 
many of them from traveling to their jobs and 
supporting their community. 
But the Brookwood citizens didn’t let 
COVID–19 stop them from finding a way to 
help. Through the Brookwood Cafe´, these he-
roes have sold ‘‘Boxes for the Brave’’ to make 
sure our doctors and nurses are well-fed as 
they treat coronavirus patients. They also 
have been selling to-go meals and family 
meals to make sure the TX–22 community is 
nourished as well. 
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, I offer a Texas-sized 
thank you to these wonderful people for the 
important work they do and their continuing 
support for our doctors, nurses and healthcare 
community. 
HONORING THE HEROIC SERVICE 
AND SACRIFICE OF IMPD OFFI-
CER BREANN LEATH 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 26, 2020 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to 
honor the life of an outstanding public servant, 
Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department 
Officer Breann Leath, who served her city and 
country with principle and integrity. Tragically, 
Officer Leath was killed in the line of duty on 
April 9, 2020, while responding to a domestic 
violence call. 
Breann was born on December 30, 1995 in 
Hinesville, Georgia. Her family moved to Indi-
ana and she graduated from Southport High 
School in 2014, where she served as captain 
of the dance squad. She was always a shining 
light in the eyes of her classmates and peers. 
She had a passion for public service, following 
in her father’s footsteps who is also a police 
officer. After graduation, Breann enlisted in the 
Indiana Army National Guard and became a 
member of the military Honor Guard. Upon 
completing her service in the National Guard, 
Breann pursued her passion for service and 
protection by becoming a corrections officer at 
the Indiana Women’s Prison. 
During her time at the Women’s Prison, 
Breann recognized her true calling and pas-
sion for law enforcement. This prompted her 
to join the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police De-
partment, known as IMPD. Officer Leath grad-
uated the police academy in 2018, going on to 
serve and protect the people of Indianapolis 
for two and a half years. 
On April 9, Officer Leath pinned on her 
badge and went to work on what she thought 
would be an ordinary day on the job. She re-
sponded to a domestic disturbance call on the 
far east side of Indianapolis where she was fa-
tally shot. Officer Leath laid down her life to 
protect her community from a dangerous indi-
vidual. Her service demonstrates the bravery 
and commitment that she and her brothers 
and sisters in uniform display every day while 
her last moments reflect the ultimate sacrifice 
law enforcement officers can make. 
On April 16, I attended an historical event at 
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) to 
honor the life and legacy of Officer Leath. Due 
to the Public health recommendations sur-
rounding the pandemic of COVID–19, fellow 
officers and Hoosiers around the state took 
unprecedented actions to properly and safely 
lay Officer Leath to rest. As many as 1,900 
people joined to watch a live broadcast of the 
11 a.m. services across local media websites 
and on YouTube, tuning in to view the first fu-
neral held at IMS in its 105-year history. The 
multiple suites at the Speedway were also 
used for officials and officers to pay respects 
at a safe social distance Just below the suites, 
four rows of patrol cars lined the 2.5-mile 
track, comprised of her shiftmates at IMPD’s 
East District, her classmates in the depart-
ment’s recruiting class and other officers from 
across the state. Just over the horizon hung 
the Indianapolis skyline—a silhouette of the 
city that Leath spent her shortened life serv-
ing. 
Officer Leath was only 24 years old. A lead-
er with an infectious smile and positive atti-
tude, a veteran who served her country and a 
public servant who loved her community, Offi-
cer Leath is a shining example of the commit-
ment to the oath of protection our men and 
women in uniform take, paying the ultimate 
price to protect the citizens of Indiana. She 
leaves behind her young son Zayn, her par-
ents Tom and Jennifer, her sisters Jayla and 
Tiana, her aunt Sherry, uncles Yuri, Timothy 
Patrick and her grandparents David and Su-
sanne Malone. 
Officer Leath will forever be missed by fam-
ily, friends and her colleagues at the Indianap-
olis Metropolitan Police Department. The peo-
ple of Indiana’s Fifth Congressional District are 
eternally grateful for Breann’s contributions to 
our Hoosier community and it is my privilege 
to honor her today. On behalf of all Hoosiers, 
I salute Officer Breann Leath for her impact 
and service to our community. I extend my 
deepest condolences to Breann’s family, her 
friends, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police 
Department, and the fellow officers who mourn 
her loss.

RECOGNIZING JEANETTE MAUK 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 26, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Jeanette Mauk, who is retiring on 
June 5, 2020 after 25 years working tirelessly 
in the labor movement. 
Over the past 13 years at the Ohio AFL– 
CIO, Jeanette always fought for her members 
and the hardworking men and women of Ohio. 
She knows that strong labor is essential to our 
nation’s economic success and to our ability to 
raise wages and provide family-supporting 
jobs. 
Back in 2018, Jeanette was awarded the 
Union 
Sportsmen’s 
Alliance 
Conservation 
Steward of the Year. This award recognizes 
volunteers from each of the USA’s charter 
unions who have made exceptional contribu-
tions to organize union volunteers to donate 
their time and unique trade skills in the preser-
vation of North America’s outdoor heritage. 
Even with well-deserved accolades, Jea-
nette knew the real rewards of being involved 
in the labor movement were giving back to our 
communities, fostering solidarity among union 
members, 
and 
building 
bridges 
between 
unions and the public. 
I thank Jeannette for standing shoulder to 
shoulder with us in our fight for strong orga-
nized labor. Her work has not gone unnoticed. 
All my best to her in her next chapter.

HON. ANDY BARR

May 26, 2020 
Mrs. Evans graduated from the University of 
Kentucky and began teaching home econom-
ics at Versailles High School. After conversa-
tions with fellow teachers about the newly 
formed Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps, she 
joined the Army on a dare in 1942. She was 
in the first group of Kentucky women accepted 
for the WAC and at 21 years of age she was 
one of the youngest. She was accepted for 
the Officer Candidate School at Fort Des 
Moines, Iowa. 
Mrs. Evans was trained in army food service 
and served as the Office of the Quartermaster 
General inspector for stateside WAC mess 
halls. In early 1945 she was assigned to the 
European Theatre of Operations with the Of-
fice of the Quartermaster General outside 
Paris, France. At the end of the war she was 
working along the banks of the Rhine feeding 
German prisoners of war. Mrs. Evans earned 
the rank of Captain. Her experience as a WAC 
is documented as part of the Veterans History 
Project in the Library of Congress. 
Upon returning to civilian life, Mrs. Evans 
began work at the Veterans Administration in 
Louisville, KY, where she served as a senior 
training officer until 1951. She has served as 
a volunteer on many projects related to vet-
erans, including serving as Kentucky’s rep-
resentative on the committee to establish the 
National Women’s Memorial at Arlington Na-
tional Cemetery. She received the Spirit of 
Kentucky Award for Patriotism from the Ken-
tucky Daughters of the American Revolution. 
In 2018, she was inducted into the Kentucky 
Veterans Hall of Fame. 
It is my honor to recognize this amazing pa-
triot, celebrate her 100th birthday, and thank 
her for her service and sacrifice to our nation 
during World War II. As a part of ‘‘The Great-
est Generation’’, Mrs. Evans was an important 
part of the war effort to preserve the freedoms 
that we enjoy today. I am forever grateful for 
Americans like Helen Horlacher Evans.

COMMENDING ZACH MCALLISTER 
FOR 
KEEPING 
OUR 
HOSPITAL 
HEROES HEALTHY 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 26, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, in unprece-
dented times like these where the will and 
spirit of America are tested, Americans band 
together to weather the storm. Heroes like 
Zach McAllister in Friendswood, Texas stand 
up to support their neighbors and defend our 
community from the invisible enemy known as 
coronavirus. 
Supplies of hand sanitizer are depleting and 
have left the medical professionals working on 
the front lines of this crisis in critical need. Our 
doctors and nurses in TX–22 and across 
America need hand sanitizer to keep them 
healthy while they treat COVID–19 patients. 
Seeing the shortage, Mr. McAllister and his 
company Custom Chemicals and Coatings 
stepped up to produce the needed sanitizer at 
their warehouse in Pearland. 
Soon, Mr. McAllister and the heroes at Cus-
tom Chemicals and Coatings were able to 
start selling their supply to hospitals and emer-
gency responders as well as fire and police 
departments and EMT agencies. 
Mr. McAllister’s decision to start manufac-
turing hand sanitizer in bulk helps defend our 
doctors, nurses and health care professionals. 
By taking action like this, Mr. McAllister and 
Custom Chemicals and Coatings are playing 
an integral part in stopping the spread of 
coronavirus and ensuring that their friends, 
families, neighbors and communities stay well. 
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, I want to commend 
Mr. McAllister for the important work he is 
doing to help our community. It should come 
as no surprise that our country has a friend in 
Friendswood.
