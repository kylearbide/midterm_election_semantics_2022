God of unfailing love, Your loving

are truly the source of our deliverance. 
May we take the time today to re-

find ways to appreciate the love You 
have revealed to us in this day we have 
been given, in the relationships we 
enjoy, and in the liberty we cherish. 
And as we contemplate these count-
less gifts, we pray also for Your re-
demption from the trials of our lives 
which seek to undo us. 
Rescue us from those who would 
taunt us. 
Give us protection from reproachful 
words. 
Defend us against harmful threats. 
Our only hope is in You, O Lord. In 
You, we place our trust. 
Do not allow our faithful witness to 
be silenced, but may we be unfailing in 
living Your truth. 
In Your precepts, may we find free-
dom this day. 
We pray in the strength of Your 
name. 
Amen.

ESTABLISHING THE SELECT COM-
MITTEE TO INVESTIGATE THE 
JANUARY 6TH ATTACK ON THE 
UNITED STATES CAPITOL 
SPEECH OF 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 30, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, the assault 
that took place on January 6th was not just 
against the Capitol building, or on Members of 
Congress, Congressional staff, or Capitol Po-
lice—the actions of that day were also an at-
tack on the very foundation of our democracy. 
The violence—and the tragic death it yield-
ed demand that we lay aside our partisan 
agendas and begin the difficult but necessary 
work to unravel what happened. 
I am pleased that the Select Committee is 
charged with a broad mandate to investigate 
the various factors that played a role in the as-
sault, including extremism on online platforms, 
involvement of domestic terrorist groups, the 
influence of foreign actors, and the financial 
support that made it all possible. 
I look forward to the final product of this 
committee’s work, and to implementing its rec-
ommendations to ensure the events of Janu-
ary 6th are never repeated.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF DR. 
SARA ADLER 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 2, 2021 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the life of Dr. Sara Adler who passed 
away on June 21, 2021. With decades of work 
as a professor, researcher, and author, Dr. 
Adler’s passion for education and generous 
spirit has impacted not only the lives of her 
students, but also the academic field of Italian 
Studies and Literature. 
Born on September 14, 1946, Dr. Adler 
earned a bachelor’s degree in Italian from 
Smith College, and a master’s degree and 
Ph.D. in Italian from Harvard University. Sara 
then went on to pursue a career in academia 
and education. 
Dr. Adler taught Italian at Harvard Univer-
sity, Georgetown University, and Wellesley 
College before earning the title of Professor 
Emerita of Scripps College in Claremont, Cali-
fornia. During her 40 years at Scripps College, 
Dr. Adler led the teaching of Italian Studies at 
The Claremont Colleges. Sara also served as 
a member of the Board of Trustees of The 
Webb Schools in Claremont and of the Board 
Advisory Committee of Scripps College. To 
honor her decades of academic leadership an 
endowed Professorship of Italian Studies was 
created in Dr. Adler’s name by Scripps Col-
lege following her retirement in 2018. 
In addition to her tremendous achievements 
in the classroom, Dr. Adler authored the book, 
Calvino: The Writer as Fablemaker, centered 
around Italian fiction of the Twentieth Century 
and women poets of the Italian Renaissance, 
and published a number of peer reviewed arti-
cles and papers. 
Spending time with her children, her grand-
children, her loving family and friends, and 
seeing her students grow and prosper brought 
Sara great joy. She was full of good humor 
and fine taste to the end. Dr. Adler fought on 
despite the incredible pain brought on by ALS, 
with true determination so that she could live 
her life with dignity and purpose. We can learn 
a lot from her example of living life to the full-
est. 
Dr. Sara Adler is survived by her spouse of 
48 years, Robert L. Adler; her son Joe and his 
wife, Carrie; her daughter Caroline and her 
husband, Tristan; and four grandchildren: Ben, 
Penny, Liana, and Halle. May her memory be 
a blessing to all who knew her.

INVESTING IN A NEW VISION FOR 
THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
AND 
SUR-
FACE 
TRANSPORTATION 
IN 
AMERICA ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 3, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to 
bring attention to the workforce development 
challenges brought about by our nation’s tran-
sition to electric vehicles in our public fleets. 
I urge support for my amendment to the sur-
face transportation bill, amendment No. 51 as 
designated in the House Resolution and con-
sidered in en bloc democratic amendment No. 
1. 
The electric vehicles of tomorrow present an 
important opportunity for our nation. But this 
transition must be fair for the workers who 
have long labored to maintain our fleet of die-
sel-powered vehicles. 
The federal government must take a leader-
ship role in helping our transit agencies pre-
pare their workers to maintain an entirely new 
system of hardware. 
To that end, I have introduced an amend-
ment that expresses a sense of Congress that 
the Department of Transportation should cre-
ate a workforce development strategy that pre-
pares for an electric, hydrogen, advanced 
biofuel, and hybrid vehicle future. I urge sup-
port for its inclusion in the INVEST Act. 
It is critical that while we invest in a greener 
future, we also provide opportunities for our 
mechanics and other transit and public fleet 
maintenance employees who work hard to 
keep American strong and moving forward.

IN HONOR OF THE LIFE OF ISAAC 
TATE BERBERT 
HON. BLAKE D. MOORE 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 2, 2021 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of Isaac Tate 
Berbert, a treasured member of the Berbert 
family and a friend who was taken from us far 
too soon on June 20, 2021. 
Born January 22, 2003 in Layton, Utah, 
Isaac was full of life and adventure. After living 
in Beijing, London, Shenyang, Samoa, and 
Utah, Isaac developed a deep fascination and 
love for the world around him, leading him to 
memorize country flags and study the World 
Almanac. 
After graduating from Davis High School just 
a few short weeks ago, Isaac planned to at-
tend the University of Utah on an academic 
scholarship this Fall. He aspired to supple-
ment his education by becoming a pilot so that 
he could continue his travels for years to 
come. 
Isaac’s passion for travel was matched by 
his love of the outdoors. He spent endless 
hours with friends in the wilderness staring at 
the stars in the sky. 
More than anything else, Isaac will be re-
membered for his special relationship with his 
family. Whether fishing with his grandpa or 
swimming in the open waters of the Pacific 
with his older brother Lincoln, Isaac was a 
beautiful presence in the lives of his loved 
ones. 
Isaac is survived by his father, Chad Jona-
than; his mother, Anne Elizabeth; his sister, 
Mia Lucia Schramm (Taris); his brothers, Lin-
coln James, Eli Jenkins, and Jacob Chris-
topher; and his many grandparents, uncles, 
aunts, and cousins. 
My sincere hope is that, for years to come, 
Father’s Day can be a special day to celebrate 
Isaac, his life, and what he meant to his fam-
ily. I join the Berbert family and the entire 
community in mourning the loss of Isaac. He 
was tragically taken from us far too soon, but 
his memory will live on with those who loved 
him forever. 
After graduating, Isaac’s dream was to take 
over the world. Even now, I know he is ac-
complishing that special dream. We will miss 
Isaac.

FOODBANKS 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 2, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize our fine men and women from 
the Ohio National Guard who have risen to a 
challenge on the home front as our commu-
nities wrestle with the effects of the COVID– 
19 pandemic. When our local foodbanks 
began to see increases in people needing 
food to feed themselves and their families, 
even as the pandemic imposed restrictions on 
staff and volunteers to help, we were able to 
work with the Ohio National Guard to send 
units to help distribute food to our neighbors. 
This food has been a lifeline to those served, 
who through no fault of their own were left job-
less, without funds, unsure of the future, and 
hungry. 
Truly, the Ohio National Guard lives up to 
its motto, ‘‘Always ready! Always there!’’, and 
we cannot thank them enough for their com-
passionate and brave service. 
Those serving the Cleveland area include: 
CAPT Keffer, SGT Fowler, SGT Jarkewicz, 
SGT Buzi, SGT Wooden, SGT Billingsley, 
Jared Kaczur, Aaron Kaczur, Tonya Sypolt, 
Bobby Shepherd. The Greater Cleveland 
Foodbank has recognized these individuals for 
going ‘‘above and beyond to help’’ at its week-
ly drive-through distribution and deliveries of 
groceries to older adults.

Lorain Ohio’s Second Harvest Foodbank co-
ordinated with the Ohio National Guard’s CPT 
Stephanie Duarte and SFC Monique Bryant, 
who commanded a team of thirty soldiers from 
different units in a mission to serve the 
foodbank and its neighbors. They developed 
food drives through mobile pantries and 
partnered with community organizations and 
law enforcement personnel, in an effort to en-
sure that people received food. The Ohio Na-
tional Guard and its team helped the Second 
Harvest Foodbank of Lorain deliver 18.6 mil-
lion pounds of food serving 172,000 unique in-
dividuals.

TRIBUTE TO JOYCE MULLIKEN 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 2, 2021 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the life of one of my 
constituents, Joyce Mulliken of Ephrata. Joyce 
Mulliken was a loving wife, mother, and grand-
mother. She will be dearly missed by her hus-
band of 57 years, Mike, their son Dan, and 
her entire community. 
A loyal and dedicated public servant, Joyce 
served in the Washington State House of Rep-
resentatives representing Grant, Kittitas, and 
Yakima counties. After serving four terms in 
the State House, Joyce then served as a 
Washington State Senator in 2003, dutifully 
representing her beloved community. 
In 2006, Joyce was appointed to the Growth 
Management Hearings Board, where she 
worked with citizens, communities, and the pri-
vate sector to coordinate and plan growth so 
our state could continue to prosper while pro-
tecting our quality of life. After her time as an 
elected official, she continued to lend her 
knowledge and insights on legislation with 
elected officials, even as recently as the 2021 
session. 
We owe a great debt to Joyce for her con-
tinued leadership and integrity, and she leaves 
a remarkable and admirable legacy behind 
her. May we all aspire to replicate her contin-
ued willingness to be mentor and a friend 
throughout her life. May her family and her 
community continue to be blessed by her 
memory. Rest in Peace, my friend. 
RECOGNIZING LEADING FAMILIES 
HOME 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 2, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Beach House Family Shelter’s 
100th anniversary. Founded in Toledo in 1921 
as Beach House Family Shelter, the organiza-
tion is now under the auspices of Leading 
Families Home. It provides families with re-
sources to effectively transition from home-
lessness to permanent housing. 
In 1921, Mrs. Helen (Beach) Jones, the wife 
of former Toledo mayor Samuel Jones, began 
working with several local women’s organiza-
tions to establish a shelter for homeless single 
women and women with children. Progressive 
and nationally known, Mayor Samuel ‘‘Golden 
Rule’’ Jones lived by the teaching to ‘‘Do unto 
others as you would have them do unto you.’’ 
This guiding principle directed Mrs. Jones’ ef-
forts and leadership as well. Beach House of-
fered structure and stability to struggling 
women, teaching them the skills needed to 
move forward. So many families were given 
new life and a chance for success through 
Beach House. 
In the early 1980s, Beach House began to 
include homeless intact families and single fa-
thers with children in an effort to keep families 
together. This initiative has helped families 
achieve success. 
Beach House combined with FOCUS in 
2016 to become Leading Families Home. 
FOCUS was founded in 1982 by pastors in 
the Old West End neighborhood of Toledo in 
response to growing community needs to help 
people regain independence and economic 
stability through education and employment. 
The work of Leading Families Home has 
helped hundreds of families in the Greater To-
ledo Metropolitan area and throughout Lucas 
County. Its efforts provide refuge to those who 
have nowhere else to go. Its mission to pro-
vide a safe haven has been a lifeline to so 
many. Residents are offered clean beds, 
meals, showers, washers and dryers, and per-
sonal hygiene items. Further, residents receive 
access to programs dedicated to vocational 
training, education, work referrals, and other 
resources to help people gain and maintain 
employment. This one-on-one attention is ex-
actly what individuals need to regain stability 
in their life. 
Given the circumstances of the past year, 
physical and mental health have become at 
the forefront of all our lives. Leading Families 
Home recognizes the importance of health 
and has made it a mission to serve residents 
with a team of trained mental health coun-
selors and behavioral specialists to assist. 
From 1921 to 2021 Leading Families Home 
has helped improve the Toledo Metropolitan 
area as well as Lucas County by their contin-
uous efforts to assist people in need. I hereby 
recognize and congratulate the Leading Fami-
lies Home organization for one hundred years 
of dedicated service to the Toledo community.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
CENTEN-
NIAL BIRTHDAY OF FIRST LADY 
NANCY REAGAN 
HON. MIKE GARCIA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 2, 2021 
Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today, joined by my colleagues, Rep. 
MCCARTHY, Rep. CALVERT, Rep. ISSA, Rep. 
NUNES, Rep. MCCLINTOCK, Rep. LAMALFA, 
Rep. VALADAO, and Rep. OBERNOLTE to com-
memorate the birthday of one of our Nation’s 
greatest First Ladies and a true American pa-
triot. 100 years ago, on July 6th, Nancy 
Reagan was born. Throughout her lifetime she 
served in many roles—from movie star to lov-
ing mother, from First Lady of both California 
and the United States to distinguished philan-
thropist. No matter her position, she fulfilled 
her duties with grace, elegance, and above all: 
class. 
As First Lady of California, Nancy became 
involved with important charitable work, includ-
ing visiting Vietnam war veterans, homes for 
the elderly, and schools for physically and 
emotionally handicapped children. She partici-
pated in events raising awareness about pris-
oners of war and service members missing in 
action. She also promoted the Foster Grand-
parent Program, a volunteer opportunity for 
older Americans to mentor, guide, and care for 
children with exceptional needs. This program 
continues to make important contributions to 
this day. 
As First Lady during President Reagan’s 
two terms, she spearheaded the re-beautifi-
cation of the White House, restoring it to its 
rightful former glory. She also led the charge 
on educating our Nation’s youth on the dan-
gers of drug use and addiction, teaching a 
generation of children and young adults to 
‘‘Just Say No.’’ In 1985, she hosted First La-
dies from across the world for a briefing in 
Washington and Atlanta on the topic of drug 
abuse and what can be done to help those 
who are suffering from it. Her drive to educate 
young people about the dangers of illicit drugs 
demonstrates her commitment to the future of 
our Nation. 
After her time in the White House, Nancy 
had a profound impact in our own commu-
nities through her support of the Reagan Li-
brary in Simi Valley. It was through her guid-
ance and influence that the Reagan Library 
became one of the most esteemed centers for 
learning and presidential scholarships in the 
country. She also continued the push to edu-
cate people on the perils of substance abuse 
and established the Nancy Reagan Founda-
tion and the Nancy Reagan Afterschool Pro-
gram to support this mission. 
After President Reagan passed away, she 
became a leading advocate for individuals suf-
fering from Alzheimer’s Disease and their 
caregivers. Nancy worked with the National 
Alzheimer’s Association and its affiliate, the 
Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute 
in Chicago, Illinois, to find a cure or treatment 
for this terrible disease that plagues so many 
in our country. She courageously continued 
President Reagan’s legacy in serving our 
country until her death in 2016. She is buried 
on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library 
grounds next to her husband. 
On the centennial of her birth, we commend 
Mrs. Reagan for her service to our commu-
nities, the State of California, and the United 
States of America.

SMITHVILLE 
FIDDLERS’ 
JAM-
BOREE AND CRAFTS FESTIVAL 
50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. JOHN W. ROSE 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, July 2, 2021 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the 50th Anniversary of the Smithville 
Fiddlers’ Jamboree and Crafts Festival, also 
known as the Official Festival of the State of 
Tennessee, located in Smithville, Tennessee. 
The Smithville Fiddlers’ Jamboree and Crafts 
Festival is dedicated to the furtherance and 
preservation of old-time Appalachian country 
music, dance, and authentic Appalachian art 
and culture. 
In 1972, Congressman Joe L. Evins, a 
Smithville native, conceived a gathering of a 
group of area musicians to stage an old-time 
Appalachian country music show in Smithville, 
Tennessee, and suggested the same to Barry 
C. Williams. Congressman Evins and Barry C. 
Williams, along with J.G. ‘‘Bobo’’ Driver, 
Charles Gentry, Ralph Vaughn, Neil Dudney, 
and Linda Pack formed a committee to orga-
nize such an event. On July 1, 1972, 714 mu-
sicians representing 16 states entertained an 
audience of 8,000 people. 
Now, 50 years later, this exemplary event 
has grown to the point that it is now estimated 
that 40,000 people attended the two-day event 
in 2019, with over 250 contestants. The long 
and fruitful history of the Jamboree is a cul-
mination of multiple cultural and historical 
threads that, woven together over time, have 
situated the festival as a staple of local herit-
age and is representative of tireless commu-
nity engagement. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the Smith-
ville Fiddlers’ Jamboree and Crafts Festival or-
ganizers, committees, volunteers and the peo-
ple of Smithville and DeKalb County, Ten-
nessee, for their tireless work to make this 
event an overwhelming success. Tennesseans 
take great pride in institutions and events that 
seek to make the community a better place to 
live, and I am honored to recognize the Smith-
ville Jamboree as one of these events. There-
fore, I would like my colleagues to join me in 
honoring and commending the Smithville Fid-
dlers’ Jamboree and Crafts Festival for 50 
years of tribute to Appalachian art and culture.
