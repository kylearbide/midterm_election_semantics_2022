HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
TUESDAY, MARCH 15, 2022 
The House met at noon and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
March 15, 2022. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable TERRI A. 
SEWELL to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 10, 2022, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition

RECOGNIZING DR. NGOZI EZIKE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. FOSTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dr. Ngozi Ezike, a 
dedicated public servant whose last day 
as director of the Illinois Department 
of Public Health was yesterday. 
For the past 3 years, Dr. Ezike 
worked tirelessly to protect the health 
and well-being of the people of Illinois, 
including leading our State’s public 
health response to the COVID–19 pan-
demic. In spite of historic challenges, 
she remained dedicated to her job and 
making sure that the people of Illinois 
always had the most accurate informa-
tion about how to best protect them-
selves and their families. 
Amid an onslaught of social media 
misinformation and conspiracy theo-
ries, Dr. Ezike helped make sure that 
Illinois’ COVID response operated in 
reality and was grounded in science. 
She always made sure that the sci-
entists and public health experts were 
heard by our elected officials. 
Dr. Ezike is a trailblazer—not only 
because she was Illinois’ first Black 
woman to serve as the director of the 
department of public health but be-
cause she was called to lead a State-
wide public health response to an un-
precedented pandemic, and she did not 
blink. 
There is no doubt that her work 
helped save lives in Illinois. So on be-
half of the people of our State, I thank 
Dr. Ezike for her service, and I wish 
her nothing but the best in whatever 
she decides to do next. 
COMMUNITY PROJECTS: CLEAN DRINKING WATER 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, for 
decades the city of Joliet has lived 
under the threat of unsafe drinking 
water from lead pipes used in service 
lines to individual homes. In recent 
years, the lowering of the water tables 
has threatened even the long-term 
availability of drinking water to Jo-
liet, and that is why I am so proud that 
the Federal omnibus recently passed by 
Congress included $3.5 million for the 
city of Joliet to help tap into Lake 
Michigan as the primary source of 
drinking water and to accelerate the 
replacement 
of 
lead 
service 
lines, 
thereby helping to secure clean and 
safe drinking water for the entire Jo-
liet community for decades to come. 
Altogether, our office secured nearly 
$19 
million 
for 
very 
worthwhile 
projects in Illinois’ 11th District that 
will benefit our entire community, and 
this will be taxpayer money well spent. 
COMMUNITY PROJECTS: STEPPING STONES 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, for 
decades substance abuse disorder has 
torn apart families in Will County and 
around the country. Often families 
with young children had nowhere to 
turn to. That is why I am so proud that 
the Federal omnibus recently passed by 
Congress included $2 million for Step-
ping Stones—a nonprofit that provides 
clinical services and recovery support 
for those seeking treatment for sub-
stance use disorders so that they can 
build new housing units for women 
seeking treatment. 
Altogether, our office secured nearly 
$19 
million 
for 
very 
worthwhile 
projects in Illinois’ 11th District that 
will benefit our entire community, and 
this will be taxpayer money well spent. 
COMMUNITY PROJECTS: AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, for 
decades, Will County has grappled with 
issues of affordable housing, an issue 
that has become more and more impor-
tant in communities large and small 
across our country. 
That is why I am so proud that the 
Federal omnibus recently passed by 
Congress included $3 million for the 
Housing Authority of Joliet to help 
turn a shuttered golf course into qual-
ity, affordable housing for hardworking 
families who deserve access to the 
dream of homeownership. 
Altogether, our office secured nearly 
$19 
million 
for 
very 
worthwhile 
projects in Illinois’ 11th District that 
will benefit our entire community, and 
this will be taxpayer money well spent. 
COMMUNITY PROJECTS: THE OLD JOLIET PRISON 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, for 
decades the Old Joliet Prison has 
served as the backdrop of Hollywood 
movies like ‘‘The Blues Brothers’’ and 
hit TV shows like ‘‘Prison Break.’’ But 
years of neglect have left the site un-
safe and closed to visitors.

H3716 
March 15, 2022 
That is why I am so proud that the 
Federal omnibus recently passed by 
Congress included $3 million for the Jo-
liet Area Historical Museum so that 
they can rehabilitate the site of the 
Old Joliet Prison and make it safe for 
visitors once again and enhance its po-
tential as a tourist attraction. This 
project is shovel-ready and will help 
create and sustain much-needed con-
struction jobs while restoring a histori-
cally and culturally significant site in 
an economically challenged part of the 
city. 
Altogether, our office secured nearly 
$19

for 
very 
worthwhile 
projects in Illinois’ 11th District that 
will benefit our entire community, and 
this will be taxpayer money well spent. 
COMMUNITY PROJECTS: AURORA QUAD COUNTY 
URBAN LEAGUE 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, for 
decades, America has faced a deficit of 
job training opportunities from under-
served and underrepresented commu-
nities, and that is why I am so proud 
that the Federal omnibus recently 
passed by Congress included $425,000 for 
the Aurora Quad County Urban League 
so that they can launch a youth ca-
reers program in Aurora to connect 
young people with jobs and apprentice-
ship 
opportunities 
in 
construction, 
transportation, distribution of logis-
tics, and all fields facing an increase in 
and need for Federally trained workers. 
f 
RUSSIA NEGOTIATES THE U.S.- 
IRAN DEAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCARTHY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, 
before I begin today’s remarks, I will 
take a moment to acknowledge the 
devastating news of the two confirmed 
American deaths in Ukraine: Brent 
Renaud, an American journalist work-
ing with a documentary film team who 
was fatally shot over the weekend; and 
FOX News network just confirmed mo-
ments ago one of their cameramen, 
Pierre Zakrzewski, was killed while on 
assignment in Ukraine. 
An entire nation grieves with their 
families as they mourn the loss of their 
loved ones. 
We also continue to pray for the re-
covery of FOX News correspondent, 
Benjamin Hall, who suffered serious in-
juries while covering the war. 
Now, Madam Speaker, on Sunday, 
the Iranian Revolutionary Guard fired 
dozens of missiles near the U.S. con-
sulate in Iraq. This brazen attack on a 
civilian area by the terrorist arm of 
the Iranian regime was unjustified, il-
legal, and dangerous. 
Madam Speaker, the President of the 
United States has not said one word 
about these missiles from Iran—which 
has bragged about it—towards the U.S. 
consulate in Iraq. Iran continues to 
wage an aggressive terror campaign 
against America and our allies. 
Remember, Madam Speaker, Iran’s 
Parliament has chanted ‘‘death to 
America’’ and the commander in chief 
of the Revolutionary Guard has vowed 
to set ablaze Israel. I would think with 
missiles being shot at Americans that 
the Secretary of State and—at the very 
least—the President of the United 
States would say and stand against 
this. Yet, the Biden administration is 
quietly rushing ahead with a bad agree-
ment that would give Iran—the world’s 
leading state sponsor of terror—nu-
clear weapons. 
President Biden has kept Congress 
and the American people in the dark 
about this dangerous deal which is ille-
gal and goes against legislation this 
body has passed. Madam Speaker, when 
you look at the troubling terms, it is 
easily seen why they want to keep us 
and America in the dark. 
It would lift our most significant ter-
rorism and missile sanctions and send 
Iran hundreds of billions of dollars. 
That means that Iran would see the 
windfall of cash to continue their ter-
ror campaign they had engaged in on 
Sunday and every day. 
This agreement is entirely on Iran’s 
terms. 
But what is even worse is: Who is ne-
gotiating it? 
While the world looks at the evil of 
Putin and Russia killing innocent peo-
ple and murdering throughout Ukraine, 
it is this administration that has Rus-
sia negotiating with Iran on America’s 
behalf. 
Now, what does the Russian Ambas-
sador say? 
He says that the deal that the Biden 
administration is negotiating gives 
Iran much more than it could expect, 
much more. And in return for making 
significant concessions, we get noth-
ing: no serious system to check if the 
Iranian regime is cheating on the 
terms 
of 
the 
deal; 
no 
safeguards 
against Iranian terrorism like we saw 
on Sunday targeting Americans; no le-
verage over the expanded trade be-
tween Russia, China, and Iran; and 
nothing to help the Iranian people. 
This reported agreement is even 
worse than the Obama Iran deal of 2015. 
Under the terms of this deal, Iran 
would be a nuclear state in the blink of 
an eye. It would have enough uranium 
to create nuclear bombs which would 
endanger America, Israel, and the en-
tire world. 
This is not only unthinkable, it is 
unacceptable. We should not allow the 
rogue Iranian regime to have nuclear 
weapons. The Biden administration has 
made a dangerous mistake by negoti-
ating with the Iranian regime. 
They made terrible mistakes time 
and again, how they pulled out of Af-
ghanistan, welcomed a pipeline to 
Putin, and said in a press conference 
that if Putin just takes part of 
Ukraine, it wouldn’t be so bad. 
And now Iran sends weapons—mis-
siles—at Americans, and not one word 
is said but a negotiation continues 
using Russia as our negotiator. This 
Biden administration has made a dan-
gerous mistake. 
Furthermore, President Biden has 
compounded his mistake by relying on 
Russia to negotiate on our behalf and 
reportedly has given them written 
guarantees that the deal would protect 
their trade with Tehran. 
Think about that: We are making 
major concessions on Russian trade 
with Iran at the very moment we are 
sanctioning Russia for mercilessly kill-
ing Ukrainians. That is outrageous and 
just plain stupid. 
Has President Biden learned nothing? 
Our objective is to isolate Putin, not 
empower him. The Russians should not 
be responsible for anything—especially 
not a major deal—and should never 
speak on behalf of Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I urge President 
Biden to make the right choice: Walk 
away. Because knowing when to walk 
away from the negotiating table is just 
as important as knowing when to sit 
down. 
It is also very important to know 
when to stand up. If a terrorist country 
sends weapons and missiles to attack 
Americans and you stay silent, that is 
the wrong answer, the wrong response, 
and leads to a dangerous future. 
Stand up for America, stand up for 
freedom, stand up for what is right, 
and walk away from this agreement. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
SOCIAL SECURITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. LARSON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, we all anticipate and await 
the presentation from an international 
hero. Hearing from President Zelensky 
tomorrow is exactly what this Con-
gress and what the Nation needs to 
hear. I believe that we will come out 
united. Certainly, our thoughts and 
prayers are with the people of Ukraine 
and the bravery of President Zelensky. 
Madam Speaker, I am here to also 
talk about another urgency here at 
home. The fierce urgency of now, as 
Martin Luther King said, would apply 
to seniors all across our country. We 
are all painfully aware of the results of 
the pandemic with more than 900,000 
Americans having perished and over 
660,000 of them over the age of 65. 
Madam Speaker, you know firsthand 
as well because you led Chairman 
NEAL’s racial equity initiative that 
also underscored this very group of 
people—seniors and especially people of 
color—who have been impacted the 
most. 
As John Lewis said: This is the next 
major civil rights issue. And if Black 
Lives Matter and is more than just a 
slogan, it is long overdue for the Con-
gress of the United States to take ac-
tion. 
I commend you, Madam Speaker, for 
your efforts in making sure that we

March 15, 2022 
bring to the American public’s atten-
tion this inequity that exists. Imagine 
more than 5 million Americans in the 
wealthiest nation on the face of the 
Earth living in poverty, millions of 
whom have paid all their lives into a 
Social Security system that gives them 
a below poverty-level check. 
b 1215 
The last time Congress did anything 
to enhance Social Security was in 1971. 
Richard Nixon was the President, and a 
gallon of milk cost 72 cents. 
A lot has transpired since then, espe-
cially as it relates to our seniors. The 
people who are impacted the most, 
along with COVID, are the people who 
are on fixed incomes. They are im-
pacted by inflation as well. That is why 
it is so vitally important, with more 
than 10,000 baby boomers a day becom-
ing eligible for Social Security, that 
Congress finally acts. 
Help is on the way. Social Security 
2100: A Sacred Trust will do just that 
and make sure that it provides across- 
the-board relief and makes sure that no 
one can retire into poverty and raises 
the new floor for those who are in des-
perate need now. We can no longer af-
ford to kick the can down the road. 
The pandemic has only further under-
scored the problem that our seniors 
face. 
Madam Speaker, as you know, it is 
not just our seniors. When we look at 
veterans, more veterans rely on Social 
Security disability than they do on the 
VA. When we look at spousal and de-
pendent coverage and the need for chil-
dren to stay on their policies and be 
able to be eligible as Social Security 
recipients, how we have treated widows 
and widowers, all needs to be ad-
dressed. 
Who is impacted the most by this? 
Women. And specifically women of 
color that are most in need, because of 
the jobs they held in society and be-
cause they were primarily caregivers 
and spent more time at home. It is 
they who are living longer and also 
need assistance from the United States 
Congress. 
It is long overdue for us to act. It has 
been more than 50 years since Congress 
has done anything. This is not some-
thing the President can do with an ex-
ecutive order or that is going to be ad-
judicated by the courts. This can only 
happen if Congress takes action. 
I am proud of the efforts of Chairman 
NEAL and the Ways and Means Com-
mittee as we move toward a markup of 
Social Security and to bring this to the 
floor and then to vote on it in the Sen-
ate. 
f 
THE INFLATION CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, we are facing multiple crises 
in our country. Inflation is surging, 
gasoline prices are skyrocketing, and 
the Biden administration is still refus-
ing to act. 
In Adams County, Pennsylvania, a 
gallon of gas costs $4.43. That is $1.40 
more than it did just 1 year ago. 
Rural Americans should not be forced 
to pay the price for President Biden’s 
failure to drill American oil, a failure 
that has led to the highest gas prices in 
our Nation’s history. 
In a recent survey that I conducted 
in my weekly newsletter, over 3,000 of 
my constituents responded, and 96 per-
cent of them reported that the rising 
cost of goods has affected their indi-
vidual budgets. 
It is time for President Biden to take 
responsibility for what his reckless 
spending has done to our country. Be-
cause of this reckless spending, Ameri-
cans are forced to make difficult 
choices about what they can afford to 
buy, about what medications they can 
afford, and about which bills they are 
able to pay each month. 
It is time for President Biden to care 
more about the families in Pennsyl-
vania, more about the families in 
America, than he does about the Green 
New Deal. It is time to drill American 
oil. It is time to utilize and expand 
Pennsylvania’s wonderful energy re-
sources. It is time to use the resources 
that are under the feet of my constitu-
ents: the coal, the natural gas, and the 
Marcellus shale. 
Biden welcomed a pipeline to Putin, 
and yet he shut down the Keystone XL 
pipeline. It is time to return to Amer-
ican energy independence and Amer-
ican energy dominance. It is time to 
get to work for the American people.

RECOGNIZING MARK HANSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
service of an amazing educator in my 
district. 
Earlier this year, Ottumwa High 
School announced that longtime prin-
cipal Mark Hanson would be retiring. 
Mark originally served as Ottumwa’s 
principal from 2010 to 2017 but returned 
to the high school as principal this 
past July. 
Throughout his time at OHS, Mark 
was a true leader and visionary. He 
worked tirelessly to improve gradua-
tion rates, improve the school’s culture 
and curriculum, and increase opportu-
nities for students to participate in ex-
tracurricular activities. 
Before coming to OHS, Mark re-
mained 
active 
in 
the 
community, 
coaching basketball and tennis. 
Following Mark’s retirement, Shel-
ley Bramschreiber will become the new 
principal. 
Shelley 
has 
been 
with 
Ottumwa schools since 1994. On July 1 
of this year, Shelley will become the 
first female principal in school history. 
Thank you to Mark for his decades of 
service to our community and best of 
luck to Shelley. Go Bulldogs. 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY WISHES 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I also want to take this op-
portunity to wish my scheduler, Tara 
Pinette, a happy birthday. I also wish a 
very happy birthday to my chief of 
staff, Tracie Gibler. 
Later this month, my good friend 
Matt Leopold will celebrate his birth-
day, and my youngest brother, Fred, 
has a birthday later this month as 
well. Happy birthday to Matt and 
Freddy.

WE MUST SUPPORT UKRAINE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, what 
has been taking place in Ukraine is 
pure 
genocide 
and 
evil. 
President 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is no dif-
ferent than when Germany invaded Po-
land. Just as Hitler did not stop with 
Poland, we should not expect that 
Putin will stop with Ukraine, unless he 
is resoundingly defeated. 
While much has been done to help 
Ukraine’s defenses since Russia in-
vaded and much has been donated in 
humanitarian assistance, it is not 
enough. We must do more. We must 
send more weapons, more planes, more 
missiles, whatever is needed. 
The Ukrainians are going to fight to 
the very end. We must provide them 
every resource they need to win this 
war in whatever way that we possibly 
can. For if freedom is defeated in 
Ukraine, where her people fight eagerly 
and will to the very end, it will surely 
have no safe harbor elsewhere. 
UNLEASH AMERICAN ENERGY DOMINANCE 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, Presi-
dent Biden’s decision to ban the impor-
tation of Russian oil is a good step, al-
beit late and only after mounting bi-
partisan pressure to do so. There was 
no good reason for the United States to 
ever subsidize the Russian economy 
and President Putin’s military by buy-
ing oil from Russia, a source of Putin’s 
leverage with the West for years. Now, 
he wages an unprovoked and violent as-
sault on Ukraine. 
On a separate issue, nor is it a good 
idea for the U.S. to be sitting alongside 
Russia negotiating with Iran on a deal 
that paves Iran’s path to a nuclear 
weapon, another pot of trouble brewing 
for the world, as evidenced by their 
missiles launched at Israelis and Amer-
icans in Iraq this past weekend. 
Given all the challenges we face in 
the world today, we must immediately 
unleash American energy production so 
that we in the United States and our 
allies around the world can have access 
to affordable and reliable energy. 
We should be authorizing new leases 
and permits for oil and gas projects, ex-
pediting the approval of all pipelines, 
and stopping the self-inflicted regu-
latory assault on American energy de-
velopment and financing. In short, 
President Biden must reverse, with the

stroke of a pen, every anti-fossil fuel 
policy he has put in place during the 
past year. 
If the President wants to lower gas 
prices at the pump and protect the en-
vironment, he is the one person who 
can do it, who can unleash American 
energy dominance. The world is going 
to meet its energy needs with oil and 
gas one way or the other. It is just a 
question of from where it comes. We 
can do it better and cleaner than any-
one else, so why not do it here and 
serve the call of freedom. 
HONORING DEBORAH JOHNSON 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Deborah John-
son, 
who 
recently 
received 
the 
Paulson-Whitmore 
State 
Executive 
Award from the National Pork Pro-
ducers Council and the National Pork 
Board. 
Deborah received the award for re-
lentless advocacy on behalf of pork 
producers in North Carolina and across 
the country. As one of many who count 
her as a friend, I can think of no one 
more deserving of this honor. 
Deborah grew up on her family’s 
multi-generation 
farm 
in 
Johnston 
County. It is no exaggeration to say 
she has been involved in agriculture 
her entire lifetime, including as CEO of 
the North Carolina Pork Council. 
In addition to serving in that post for 
11 years, Deborah has been an influen-
tial leader in the North Carolina agri-
culture industry throughout her ca-
reer. Additionally, she has also been in-
volved in several organizations that 
contribute to the betterment of south-
eastern North Carolina’s rural commu-
nities, many of which are the backbone 
of our State and Nation’s pork indus-
try. 
Words cannot properly express all 
that Deborah Johnson has accom-
plished, but suffice it to say she is one 
of the most influential women in agri-
culture. She cares deeply about the 
State of North Carolina, about pro-
ducing the world’s best food and fiber, 
and about protecting the livelihoods of 
the many farm families who feed and 
clothe us all. Her dedication and lead-
ership are unmatched, and I congratu-
late her on receiving this well-deserved 
award. 
f 
INFLATION HURTS ALL 
AMERICANS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. BILIRAKIS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, in-
flation hit 7.9 percent in February. In-
flation hurts all Americans, especially 
seniors and those living on a fixed in-
come. 
During each of my recent townhall 
meetings and surveys, Madam Speaker, 
my 
constituents 
have 
consistently 
pleaded for the pain to stop. Unfortu-
nately, inflation has gone up every 
month of Joe Biden’s Presidency. 
Americans are smart. They know 
this is not a fluke or the result of the 
tragedy that is occurring in Ukraine. It 
is a direct consequence of liberal poli-
cies and fueled by reckless government 
spending. My constituents have said 
they simply can’t afford to keep paying 
more for everything, which is one of 
the main reasons I was compelled to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on last week’s $1.5 trillion 
spending package. While there were in-
dividual provisions I supported, I am 
worried that more massive government 
spending will only worsen their plight. 
I can’t, in good conscience, contribute 
to their pain. 
CELEBRATING DENNIS KAPPAS 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate Dionysios, oth-
erwise known as Dennis, Kappas, an 
outstanding member of the Tarpon 
Springs community. 
Dennis 
was 
born 
in 
Zakynthos, 
Greece, a beautiful island, but mi-
grated to the United States after a dev-
astating earthquake destroyed his is-
land. 
Dennis and his family landed in De-
troit, where he was a hardworking new 
immigrant. He worked diligently at 
restaurants by day and learned English 
by night. 
Through years of blood, sweat, and 
tears, as is common with the immi-
grant story, Dennis and his brother 
saved enough money to buy their own 
restaurant, 
living 
the 
American 
Dream. 
In 1990, Dennis moved to Tarpon 
Springs, Florida, where he settled with 
his family and owned and operated 
Plaka restaurant, the best gyros and 
souvlaki on the Sponge Docks. 
In addition to running Plaka and 
many other business ventures, Dennis 
has been a generous philanthropist and 
has made significant contributions to 
the centerpiece of Tarpon Springs, St. 
Nicholas Greek Orthodox Cathedral. He 
is donating the contents of his home 
chapel, including beautiful and one-of- 
a-kind icons, to the new church annex, 
which contains the newly opened and 
appropriately 
named 
St. 
Dionysios 
Chapel. 
I am proud to call him a friend and 
thank him for all his meaningful con-
tributions to our wonderful commu-
nity.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
VINCENT M. AUGOSTINI 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. TENNEY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to remember and celebrate Vin-
cent Augostini, who lost his life due to 
complications from neurofibromatosis 
on January 27, 2022. 
Vince, as his friends and family 
called him, was born in Johnson City, 
New York, on September 7, 1979. He was 
the seventh child of his mother, Dolo-
res, and father, Louis. 
Vince was a quintessential upstate 
New Yorker. He loved New York and 
especially the southern tier, where he 
spent his entire life in his cherished 
hometown of Johnson City, New York. 
Vincent enjoyed all things New York, 
from our terrific sports teams to our 
delicious and unique regional food 
choices. He loved rooting for the New 
York Yankees and the New York Gi-
ants. 
He 
savored 
hearty 
chicken 
spiedies, a Binghamton specialty, and 
enjoyed extra-crispy Buffalo chicken 
wings. 
When he was not watching the Yan-
kees or the Giants, Vince was also a 
huge fan of professional wrestling. 
However, few things brought him as 
much joy as following the New York 
Yankees, and God loves Yankees fans. 
Decked out in Yankees gear, with a 
large Yankees logo displayed proudly 
on the back window of his van, Vince 
made several sacred trips from Johnson 
City to the Bronx to watch his beloved 
Bronx Bombers play. 
For his 34th birthday, Vince trekked 
to the Bronx to watch the Yankees 
take on their biggest rivals, the Boston 
Red Sox. Before the game, Vince had 
the special honor of being escorted 
onto the field at Yankee Stadium, a 
high pride for him. He continued to at-
tend every Saturday home game at 
Yankee Stadium until his declining 
health made it impossible for him to 
travel. 
But the one thing Vince cherished 
most in the world was his devoted and 
loving family. As the youngest of seven 
siblings, the Augostini siblings were a 
source of mutual love, support, and in-
spiration to each other. 
From family reunions to holidays 
and birthdays, Vince spent countless 
hours with his family, especially his 
mother, Dolores, with whom he shared 
a special bond. 
As Vince’s health inevitably de-
clined, Dolores devoted her life to pro-
viding him with loving care. The rela-
tionship Vince and his mother shared 
was the epitome of unconditional love. 
Even when his health began to dete-
riorate rapidly, Vince was more wor-
ried about his own mother than even 
about himself. In his final moments on 
Earth, and as his family tearfully ex-
pressed emotional and final good-byes, 
Vince mouthed the words to all of his 
brothers: ‘‘Please help Mom.’’ 
Vince was selfless. His courage in the 
face of a difficult battle to fight a life-
long and terribly debilitating disease is 
beyond inspiring. Most importantly, 
despite 
all 
the 
pain 
he 
endured 
throughout his life, Vince was unwav-
ering in his compassion and care for all 
of those whom he encountered. 
Vince was forever grateful for the 
kindness of the Make-A-Wish Founda-
tion. Vince was the 500th kid chosen 
from the Make-A-Wish Foundation of 
Central New York. In November 1997, 
Vince had the amazing, once-in-a-life-
time opportunity to bring his brothers 
and father to Chicago to meet Bulls su-
perstar, Michael Jordan, the greatest 
of all time. 
Vincent was truly generous at heart 
and wanted to make sure other chil-
dren got the same opportunity, which

is why he was a frequent donor to the 
Make-A-Wish Foundation of Central 
New 
York 
as 
well 
as 
the 
Neurofibromatosis Foundation. 
Vince spent most of his last 2 years 
at the Willow Point Nursing and Reha-
bilitation Center. However, this did not 
stop him from doing what he loved: 
watching sports, eating spiedies and 
chicken wings, and, of course, loving 
his family and friends. 
The Augostini family wishes to ex-
press their immense appreciation to 
the staff at Willow Point for the loving 
care 
that 
was 
provided 
to 
Vince 
through his final days on Earth. When 
the pandemic restrictions prohibited 
visitors, the staff at Willow Point made 
extraordinary efforts to ensure that 
Vince was treated as a family member 
and had constant virtual access to his 
own family at home. 
Sadly, Vince passed away on January 
27, 2022, surrounded by his loving fam-
ily. 
Although neurofibromatosis created 
many challenges for Vince, he refused 
to let his disability affect his spirits or 
his passion for life. He never let the 
disease define him. 
Vince will always be remembered for 
his infectious smile, his charming 
sense of humor, and his zest for life. 
As President Abraham Lincoln said, 
in the end, it is not the years in life 
that count; it is the life in your years. 
In the short 42 years of his life, Vince 
made every single day count. 
He lived every day with kindness and 
gratitude. Vince’s perseverance and te-
naciousness were an inspiration to his 
family, friends, and all of those who 
were lucky enough to know him. 
I ask today that all of my colleagues 
join me in observing a moment of si-
lence to remember the incredible life of 
Vincent Augostini. 
To the Augostini family, please know 
that we send our deepest condolences 
and prayers. May Vincent rest in 
peace.

The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

prayer: 
Gracious and loving God, remind us, 
as we pause in this moment, to honor 
the covenant You have established 
with us. 
In Your great mercy, You have al-
lowed us to enjoy a personal relation-
ship with You, a relationship based on 
the promise You have made, time and 
again, to be our protector, our shield, 
our confidant, and our hope. 
Though repeatedly we have not lived 
up to our end of that promise, where we 
agreed that we would be Your people, 
may we recommit ourselves, with re-
newed hearts and renewed purpose, to 
serve You this day. 
What a remarkable privilege You 
have given us to know You, to follow 
You, and to love You. You call us forth 
to live in response to that privilege. 
Because You have forgiven our iniq-
uity, may we respond to those around 
us with compassion. 
Because You no longer remember our 
sin, may we live lives worthy of Your 
grace. 
In the strength of Your name, we 
offer our prayers this day. 
Amen.

ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
(Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to commemorate the 1-year 
anniversary of the American Rescue 
Plan, or the ARP. 
The ARP helped to provide critical 
assistance to individuals and small 
businesses during our historic COVID– 
19 pandemic that has driven job and 
wage growth in our country. 
I will focus on just one little piece of 
this law: the provision boosting the 
child tax credit. 
Study after study has shown the ben-
efits of this policy: helping families 
meet basic needs such as food and utili-
ties, a need that has become even 
greater when we talk about the rising 
costs and inflation we are all experi-
encing. 
Unfortunately, this support ended as 
families are grappling with higher 
prices for a range of basic needs. 
If you really want to help families 
struggling with inflation, renew the 
successful ARP child tax credit. It is 
the right prescription for struggling 
families. 
f 
PUTIN’S WAR 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, war criminal Putin is betray-
ing the young soldiers of Russia to 
death. 18- to 20-year-old conscripts are 
mercilessly sent to Ukraine on a train-
ing mission not knowing they were 
going to murder Ukrainian families of 
children, women, and men. Russian 
mothers and fathers are lied to by 
Putin that this is a ‘‘special mission.’’ 
I especially understand foreign serv-
ice. My father served in the Flying Ti-
gers with the Chinese military in 
Kunming, Chengdu, and Xi’an to stop 
aggression in World War II. As a par-
ent, I am grateful my son Alan served 
in Iraq, my son Add in Iraq, my son Ju-
lian in Egypt, and my son Hunter in 
Afghanistan. 
I know Russian families are con-
cerned for their sons who are being sac-
rificed by Putin, murdering for oil, 
money, and power in Putin’s war. 
That is why I have offered bipartisan 
legislation to Russian military defec-
tors for expedited refugee status to 
America. Defectors who turn over 
equipment to Ukraine will receive a 
payment of up to $100,000. 
God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine.

BOUNDARY OF PALO ALTO BAT-

NATIONAL 
HISTORIC

Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 268) to provide for the boundary 
of the Palo Alto Battlefield National 
Historic Park to be adjusted, to au-
thorize the donation of land to the 
United States for addition to that his-
toric park, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 268 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. BOUNDARY; LEGAL DESCRIPTION. 
(a) BOUNDARY.—Section 3(b)(2) of the Palo 
Alto Battlefield National Historic Site Act of 
1991 (16 U.S.C. 410nnn–1(b)(2)) is amended— 
(1) by amending subparagraph (A) to read as 
follows: 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.— 
‘‘(i) In addition to the land described in para-
graph (1), the historical park shall consist of— 
‘‘(I) the approximately 34 acres of land, as 
generally depicted on the map entitled ‘Palo 
Alto Battlefield NHS Proposed Boundary Ex-
pansion’, numbered 469/80,012, and dated May 
21, 2008; and 
‘‘(II) on the date that such land is donated to

‘‘(ii) Before accepting any donated land de-
scribed in this subparagraph, the Secretary 
shall complete a boundary study analyzing the 
feasibility of adding the land to the national 
historical park. 
‘‘(iii) If a boundary study completed under 
clause (ii) finds that acceptance of the donated 
land is feasible and appropriate, the Secretary 
may accept such land and administer the land 
as part of the historical park after providing no-
tice of such finding to Congress.’’; and 
(2) in subparagraph (B)— 
(A) in the heading, by striking ‘‘MAP’’ and in-
serting ‘‘MAPS’’; and 
(B) by striking ‘‘map’’ and inserting ‘‘maps’’. 
(b) LEGAL DESCRIPTION.—Section 3(b)(3) of the 
Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site Act

‘‘Secretary of the Interior’’ and inserting ‘‘after 
the addition of lands to the historic park bound-
ary, the Secretary of the Interior’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona (Mr. GRIJALVA) and the gen-
tleman from Utah (Mr. MOORE) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
268, the Palo Alto Battlefield National 
Historic Park Boundary Adjustment 
Act, introduced by the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. VELA). 
H.R. 268 expands the boundary of 
Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic 
Park to include approximately 166 
acres of land that is to be donated to 
the Department of the Interior. 
The donated land was the site of Fort 
Brown, a crucial outpost during the 
Mexican-American War, which remains 
the last standing physical structure as-
sociated with that war. 
During its life, Fort Brown trans-
formed from a site designed for a con-
frontation into a post that served to 
protect the growing Mexican-American 
population of the region. 
Palo Alto Battlefield was designated 
as a national historic landmark in 1960, 
as a national historic site in 1978, and 
a national historic park in 2009. Today, 
the Palo Alto Battlefield National His-
toric Park is the only unit of the Na-
tional Park Service focused on the 
Mexican-American War. 
I congratulate Representative VELA 
for championing this bill, and I urge 
my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. WESTERMAN) will control the 
time for the minority. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
H.R. 268 authorizes the transfer of ap-
proximately 166 acres, by donation, 
from the International Boundary and 
Water Commission to the National 
Park Service for inclusion in the Palo 
Alto Battlefield National Historic Park 
in Texas. 
Palo Alto Battlefield National His-
toric Park is the site of the first major 
battle of the Mexican-American War 
and has the distinction of being the 
only National Park Service unit to in-
terpret the Mexican-American War. 
The land authorized to be transferred 
through this bill includes the historic 
Fort Brown site in Brownsville, Texas, 
which served as a critical military out-
post 
during 
the 
Mexican-American 
War. 
I thank Chair GRIJALVA for accom-
modating our request at markup to re-
quire the Secretary of the Interior to 
complete a boundary study analyzing 
the feasibility of adding this land to 
the park prior to it being acquired and 
incorporated into the boundary. The 
study requirement will ensure that the 
land to be donated is feasible for the 
National Park Service to manage as an 
addition to the park. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation will 
help preserve an important piece of 
American history, and I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. VELA), the 
sponsor of the legislation. 
Mr. VELA. Mr. Speaker, today I rise 
in support of H.R. 268, legislation to 
add the Fort Brown earthworks to the 
Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic 
Park, and I urge my colleagues to vote 
in favor of this bill. 
I introduced this legislation to pre-
serve a piece of history that is not only

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

March 15, 2022 
central to south Texas, but to our 
great Nation. Adding this piece of Fort 
Brown is critical to interpreting the 
Mexican-American 
War 
and 
the 
changes made to our international 
boundary. It is a record of our Nation’s 
border expansion extending to the Pa-
cific Ocean. 
In hopes of establishing the Rio 
Grande River as the southern border of 
the United States, General Taylor or-
dered the construction of Fort Texas in 
March of 1846. 
On May 3, 1846, Mexican General 
Mariano Arista attacked Fort Texas. 
Under 
the 
command 
of 
General 
Zachary Taylor, U.S. forces, including 
Lieutenant Ulysses S. Grant, fought at 
the Battle of Palo Alto and the Battle 
of Resaca de la Palma, two decisive 
victories that would force the Mexican 
retreat across the Rio Grande. 
While the siege produced limited 
damage to the fort, Major Jacob 
Brown, who had command of the post, 
was mortally wounded in its defense. 
Afterward, General Taylor named the 
site Fort Brown, and the surrounding 
area became the town of Brownsville, 
Texas. 
The Fort Brown earthworks is the 
only 
standing 
architecture 
in 
the 
United States associated with the 
Mexican-American War. Bringing the 
earthworks into the Palo Alto Battle-
field National Historical Park helps 
tell our Nation’s story and protects 
this important symbol of the trans-
formation of the country resulting 
from the 19th century westward expan-
sion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of this legislation so we 
can protect an essential piece of our 
history that will help us to tell the 
story of our Nation long into the fu-
ture. I thank the chairman and the 
ranking member for their support in 
this legislation. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
ready to close when the gentleman 
from Arizona is. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I have 
one additional request to address the 
legislation. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ). 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of 
Congressman FILEMON VELA’s bill, H.R. 
268, which would add Fort Brown to the 
Palo Alto Battlefield National Histor-
ical 
Park 
located 
in 
Brownsville, 
Texas. 
By including this fort, we are cre-
ating a national monument for the 
only 
standing 
architecture 
in 
the 
United States associated with the 
Mexican-American War. 
In 1845, after the annexation of 
Texas, President James Polk sent sol-
diers to Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mex-
ico, to proclaim the boundary of the 
United States at the Rio Grande River. 
In 1846, General Zachary Taylor or-
dered the construction of the fort, 
which 
consisted 
of 
a 
six-sided 
earthwork. Once finished, General Tay-
lor left to procure supplies and gave 
command of the fort to Major Jacob 
Brown. 
On May 3, 1846, Mexico sought to cap-
italize on the depleted resources and 
bombarded the fort for 6 straight days. 
Major Jacob Brown and the American 
troops fought valiantly, forcing Mexico 
to retreat. American forces only lost 
two soldiers, one of which was Major 
Brown himself. 
Today, the city of Brownsville and 
Fort Brown serve as a testament to 
Major Brown’s valor, patriotism, and 
sacrifice. By passing H.R. 268, we as a 
Nation will honor Major Brown and the 
Americans who stood their ground at 
Fort Brown. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to join Congressman VELA and 
I in preserving this important part of 
south Texas’ and our entire country’s 
history. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge adoption of the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I join 
with the ranking member to urge adop-
tion of the legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 268, which will 
preserve The Palo Alto Battlefield National 
Historic Park. The preservation and expansion 
of the Palo Alto Battlefield will continue to pro-
vide access, and encourage public under-
standing of this historically important site. 
I support this legislation because the Palo 
Alto Battlefield National Historic Park marks 
the 1846 clash of Mexican and U.S. troops, 
preserves the battle site, and includes history 
tours. The park preserves the site and informs 
visitors about its national and international im-
portance. 
The 
Mexican-American 
war 
of 
1846–1848 gained the great state of Texas its 
independence. This bill will authorize the do-
nation of the park and grant the authority to 
the United States to implement a boundary to 
preserve in perpetuity of the history of a key 
notable battle that changed the map of North 
America. 
Specifically, H.R. 268 adjusts the boundary 
of the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical 
Park in Texas by including approximately 166 
acres of land donated to the U.S. that will be 
identified on the map titled Palo Alto Battlefield 
National Historical Park, Proposed Boundary 
Addition, Fort Brown Unit (2018), when the 
land is donated to the United States. 
Finally, the bill authorizes the transfer of 
property from the International Boundary and 
Water Commission to the National Park Serv-
ice (NPS) to be part of the Palo Alto Battlefield 
National Historical Park. The identified land 
was the site of Fort Brown, a crucial outpost 
during the conflict and which remains the last 
standing physical structure associated with the 
Mexican-American War. 
Palo Alto Battlefield was designated as a 
National Historic Landmark in 1960, a National 
Historic Site in 1978, and a National Historical 
Park in 2009. Today, the Palo Alto Battlefield 
National Historical Park is the only unit of the 
NPS focused on the Mexican-American War. 
President James K. Polk, in his December 
1845 message to Congress, characterized the 
recent annexation of Texas by the United 
States, with a boundary along the Rio Grande. 
He had campaigned for the presidency with a 
pledge to extend the United States to the Pa-
cific Ocean, and the addition of the Republic 
of Texas as the 28th state represented a 
major step toward that goal. 
Mexico, however, challenged annexation. 
Although Texas had severed ties with Mexico 
in 1836, many Mexican leaders refused to rec-
ognize its independence and denounced the 
U.S. move as an attack on Mexico. The Rio 
Grande River formed the boundary of the new 
state. Mexico had always mapped Texas as a 
much smaller region—bounded in part by the 
Nueces River. Polk’s call for a Rio Grande 
border placed a huge expanse of territory in 
dispute. 
President Polk attempted to force a settle-
ment of the boundary issues. In the summer 
of 1845, he sent an envoy to Mexico City to 
negotiate an agreement. The tactic failed. In 
Mexico, hardline Gen. Mariano Paredes y 
Arrillaga marched to the capital, seized control 
of the government, and announced that he 
would discuss nothing but the return of Texas. 
Clear battle lines had been drawn. 
When Mexican and United States troops 
clashed on the Palo Alto Battlefield, cannon 
blasts and musket fire were not the only dan-
gers. In the field’s harsh environment, they 
also encountered poisonous snakes and in-
sects, and prickly plants. These natural haz-
ards remain today. 
On May 8, 1846, U.S. and Mexican troops 
clashed on the coastal prairie of Palo Alto, 
where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf of 
Mexico. 
The 
ensuing 
two-year 
conflict 
changed the map of North America. Palo Alto 
Battlefield National Historical Park preserves 
and interprets the site and memory of that bat-
tle, vividly described in dozens of letters and 
diaries written by soldiers. 
The Palo Alto Battlefield includes 3,400 
acres of prairie and dense chaparral. The bat-
tlefield is being restored to its 1846 condition 
landscape and its trails, facilities, and visitor 
services are under development. The battle-
field is located at 7200 Paredes Line Rd. (FM 
1847) in Brownsville, TX, just north of the FM 
511 intersection. 
The Resaca de la Palma and Fort Brown 
sites, both National Historic Landmarks, will 
also be preserved. Today the Resaca de la 
Palma Battlefield lies on Paredes Line Rd. in 
the heart of Brownsville, which has swallowed 
up much of the original scene. But 38 acres of 
the battlefield survive. In 2011 it became a 
second unit of Palo Alto Battlefield National 
Historical Park. 
Fort Brown has suffered over time from the 
effects of erosion and levee construction on 
the Rio Grande. A few earthen mounds near 
the Fort Brown Golf Course are all that re-
main. Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical 
Park is cooperating with private and public 
partners to preserve Fort Brown for public en-
joyment and education. 
I ask all members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 268, to support the authorization of the 
donation of the land to the United States to 
continue the preservation and expansion of 
the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Park. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 268, as 
amended.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1908, the Ka’ena Point National Herit-
age Area Act, introduced by the gen-
tleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE), my 
Natural 
Resources 
Committee 
col-
league. 
This bill authorizes the Secretary of 
the Interior to conduct a study to as-
sess the suitability and feasibility of 
designating Ka’ena Point National Her-
itage Area in the State of Hawaii. 
The study focuses on the undeveloped 
area of the point on the west end of the 
island of Oahu and home to some of the 
richest and most well-preserved cul-
tural aspects of Hawaii’s history along 
with invaluable and unique environ-
mental and natural resources. 
b 1445 
This area is the site of the last intact 
sand dune ecosystem in Hawaii and an 
important cultural site that, according 
to some Hawaiian tradition, is where 
the souls of the deceased leapt into the 
next plane of existence. 
Rich with wildlife and thriving bio-
diversity, the area is home to various 
protected 
species, 
including 
laysan 
albatrosses, 
the 
wedge-tailed 
shearwaters, monk seals, and fragile 
native plants. 
I congratulate my colleague, Rep-
resentative CASE, for championing this 
bill on behalf of his constituents. I urge 
my colleagues to support the legisla-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
H.R. 1908, offered by Congressman 
CASE of Hawaii, requires the Secretary 
of the Interior to conduct a study to 
assess the suitability and feasibility of 
designating Ka’ena Point National Her-
itage Area. 
The study authorized by this bill fo-
cuses on an undeveloped area on the 
west end of O’ahu that is home to the 
last intact sand dune species in Hawaii. 
As the chairman pointed out, this 
point is also inhabited by various pro-
tected 
species, 
the 
wedge-tailed 
shearwaters, monk seals, and rare na-
tive plants. 
The feasibility study that this bill 
authorizes will be conducted in con-
sultation with State and local historic 
preservation officers, historical soci-
eties, and tourism offices. 
Some day I hope to be able to visit 
this Ka’ena Point with Congressman 
CASE. I urge adoption of the bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE), the 
sponsor of the legislation. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in strong support of H.R. 1908, the 
Ka’ena Point National Heritage Area 
Act. I wish first to recognize and say 
‘‘mahalo,’’ or thank you, to my partner 
in our Hawaii congressional delegation, 
Representative KAIALI’I KAHELE, who 
co-introduced this bill with me. 
Our bill directs the U.S. Department 
of the Interior to study whether Ka’ena 
Point, a treasured wilderness area on 
the western tip of the island of O’ahu, 
should be designated as a national her-
itage area, or NHA. The 3-year study 
would evaluate whether Ka’ena Point 
holds invaluable resources that reflect 
our country’s heritage and are worthy 
of conservation and special recognition 
nationally. Such a designation would 
also offer critical support to our local 
community in Hawaii to conserve the 
area for present and future use. 
I am certain that Ka’ena Point is a 
perfect candidate for NHA designation. 
It houses a rich cultural and environ-
mental history. It is the location of 
one of Hawaii’s most sacred places, a 
leina a ka ‘uhane, a leaping place of 
souls where, according to native Ha-
waiian tradition, the spirits of the re-
cently deceased leap from this realm to 
the next. 
As one of the last few remaining and 
easily accessible wilderness areas on 
O’ahu, the sand dunes of Ka’ena Point 
are home to a number of endemic and 
endangered species, such as the Hawai-
ian monk seal, laysan albatross, and 
the ohai flower. 
Our bill will ensure the full collabo-
ration of the local community in pre-
serving the traditions and pristine na-
ture of Ka’ena Point. The community, 
our local organizations, fishers, hikers, 
and neighborhood groups, will be fully

engaged throughout the study process 
and, if the area is eventually des-
ignated as an NHA, will be integral 
partners in the area’s management. 
Finally, I also thank the chairs and 
ranking members of my full Com-
mittee on Natural Resources and Sub-
committee on National Parks, Forests 
and Public Lands, and our staffs for 
your understanding and support of our 
proposal. 
And yes, to the ranking member, I 
look forward to showing you Ka’ena 
Point as soon as you can come out. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this legislation. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers on the legislation. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
again urge adoption of the bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, we all 
know Hawaii is a beautiful State. The 
bill will help protect and conserve that 
rich environmental and cultural herit-
age. I urge my colleagues to support 
the legislation. 
And I urge Representative CASE to 
invite all of us to Hawaii when it is 
time to see the site. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 1908; the 
‘‘Ka’ena Point National Heritage Area Act’’ 
which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior 
to conduct a study to assess the suitability 
and feasibility of designating certain land as 
the Ka’ena Point National Heritage Area. 
Different from national parks, national herit-
age areas are community-based efforts that 
preserve and share stories about a region’s 
history and character. Heritage areas contain 
a mixture of public and private property, in-
cluding towns, historic sites, parks, trails, com-
mercial districts, and even working farms. 
National Heritage Areas are a grassroots, 
community-driven approach to heritage con-
servation 
and 
economic 
development. 
Through public-private partnerships, NHA enti-
ties support historic preservation, natural re-
source conservation, recreation, heritage tour-
ism, and educational projects. Leveraging 
funds and long-term support for projects, NHA 
partnerships foster pride of place and an en-
during stewardship ethic. 
When an area is designated as an NHA, its 
inhabitants don’t have to leave. An important 
aspect of NHAs is that they are intended as a 
celebration of a living environment, and they 
improve the local economy around them. 
The National Parks Service estimates NHAs 
average $5.50 for every $1.00 of federal in-
vestment, bolstering the local economies 
through their unique ‘‘heritage tourism.’’ 
Not only are NHAs economically friendly, 
but they are also climate friendly. Many NHAs 
improve water and air quality in their regions 
through restoration projects and encourage 
people to enjoy natural and cultural sites by 
providing new recreational opportunities. 
This modern approach to conservation 
taken by NHAs should influence the NPS’ ap-
proach, extending the appreciation for the 
nexus between the people and land. 
John Muir was a greatly revered conserva-
tionist who some consider partly responsible 
for the establishment of our National Parks 
System. He and former President Theodore 
Roosevelt went on a camping trip to Yosemite, 
and after the trip was done, President Roo-
sevelt was inspired by his conservationist 
ideas and thus established the National Parks 
System. 
As a result of that camping trip, we now 
have 423 national parks. While their grandeur 
and contributions to employment, quality of 
life, and national beauty are not to be over-
looked, much of the lands these parks lie on 
were stolen from indigenous tribes. 
For example, Yellowstone National Park. 
Yellowstone National Park was created when 
President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law the 
Yellowstone Act of 1872, which created Amer-
ica’s first landscape to be ‘‘reserved and with-
drawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale 
. . . and dedicated and set apart as a public 
park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and 
enjoyment of the people.’’ 
Because of this order, the Crow, Blackfeet, 
Bannock, Nez Perce, and Shoshone tribes 
were all removed from Yellowstone, lands they 
had inhabited for generations. Recent studies 
have found additional tribal claims to the land 
numbering as high as 27, yet despite this in-
formation there is no redress in sight. 
It is worth noting that the NPS has gra-
ciously set up programs for Native students 
and has increased tribal consultation to ex-
change information about park projects and 
ethnographic resources. The tribes have re-
quested to participate in resource manage-
ment and decision-making, to conduct cere-
monies and other events in the park, and to 
collect plants and minerals for traditional uses. 
This is a step in the right direction, but it is 
a far cry from justice which has been long de-
nied and overdue for native peoples. 
Land sovereignty has always been a false 
promise the U.S. Government has offered to 
its indigenous peoples, which is even more 
relevant in the case of indigenous Hawaiians. 
Since the illegal overthrow of their govern-
ment and subsequent colonization of Hawaii in 
1898, indigenous Hawaiians’ struggle has not 
ended. From the Mauna Kea protests span-
ning the last few years concerning an observ-
atory to be placed on sacred land to the 
Kalama Valley Protests surrounding evictions 
of farmers from their lands to build a resort in 
the 1970s, indigenous Hawaiians have end-
lessly fought for self-preservation and self-de-
termination as they were promised, and the 
fight will continue. 
Their fight will be aided by the passage of 
the Ka’ena Point National Heritage Area Act. 
I am grateful that Representatives CASE and 
KAHELE have committed to fully involving all 
engaged communities, including native Hawai-
ians. 
It is for that reason, Mr. Speaker, that I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 1908, the Ka’ena 
Point National Heritage Area Act and urge my 
colleagues support for the Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1908. 
The question was taken; and (two-

JAPANESE AMERICAN 
CONFINEMENT EDUCATION ACT 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1931) to provide competitive 
grants for the promotion of Japanese 
American confinement education as a 
means to understand the importance of 
democratic principles, use and abuse of 
power, and to raise awareness about 
the importance of cultural tolerance 
toward Japanese Americans, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 1931, the Jap-
anese 
American 
Confinement 
Edu-
cation Act, introduced by my col-
league, Representative DORIS MATSUI. 
In 2006, Congress established the Jap-
anese 
American 
Confinement 
Sites 
grant program for the preservation and 
interpretation 
of 
U.S. 
confinement 
sites where Japanese Americans were 
detained during World War II. 
These grants are awarded through a 
competitive process to entities work-
ing 
to 
preserve 
historic 
Japanese 
American incarceration sites. They re-
quire a 2:1 Federal to non-Federal 
match. 
H.R. 1931 would authorize increased 
and much-needed funding for the pro-
gram within the National Park Serv-
ice, ensuring that the lessons and his-
tory of the unjust incarceration of Jap-
anese Americans is not forgotten, and 
that we continue to learn from the 
transgression of the past. 
The bill will also establish a new 
competitive grant within the program 
that would support nonprofits to create 
and share educational materials about 
the incarceration of Japanese Ameri-
cans during World War II. 
I congratulate my colleague, Rep-
resentative MATSUI, for championing 
this bill, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1931 extends the 
authorization of the Japanese Amer-
ican Confinement Sites grant program 
and establishes a new competitive 
grant program to award grants to Jap-
anese American organizations to create 
and disseminate educational materials 
about the history of Japanese Amer-
ican confinement during World War II. 
In 2006, Congress established the Jap-
anese American Confinement Sites, or 
JACS grant program to preserve and 
interpret U.S. Confinement Sites dur-
ing World War II. However, the pro-
gram will soon run up against the end 
of its authorization cap. 
The program has supported valuable 
projects across the country, including 
at least 12 in my home State of Arkan-
sas, where important projects have 
been funded at my alma mater, the 
University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, 
as well as Arkansas State University, 
the University of Arkansas at Little 
Rock, University of Central Arkansas, 
and the Central Arkansas Library Sys-
tem, and the McGehee Industrial Foun-
dation. 
These projects include archiving, cre-
ating 
educational 
exhibits, 
hosting 
workshops 
and 
lectures, 
preserving 
cemeteries, and recording oral his-
tories. 
I appreciate Representative MATSUI’s 
work on this important legislation, and 
I urge my colleagues to support extend-
ing the program. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
MATSUI), sponsor of the legislation. 
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of my bill, the Japa-
nese American Confinement Education 
Act. This bill builds upon one of my 
earliest achievements, reauthorizing 
the Japanese American Confinement 
Sites program established in 2006. 
The Japanese American story is an 
important one. It needs to be told and 
retold. It is a story that cannot afford 
to be lost in time. 
This year marks the 80th anniversary 
of the authorization of Executive Order 
9066. Yet, too many Americans do not 
know the history of the Japanese 
American community. 
These Americans were stripped from 
their homes and sent to remote camps. 
Families were put behind barbed wire 
and guarded by armed soldiers. 
Today, I speak to you on the floor of 
the people’s House as a Member of this 
esteemed Chamber. Yet, my first 3 
months of life were part of that pained 
experience. My parents were among 
those who lived in these appalling con-
ditions, incarcerated solely because of 
their ancestry. This also included 
many people from the Sacramento re-
gion, including my late husband, Con-
gressman Bob Matsui, who was only 6 
months old when he was sent to one of 
these camps. 
Those of us in the Japanese Amer-
ican community know all too well if we 
do not learn from history, we risk the 
chance of it repeating. That is why we 
must continue to lift up these stories. 
That is why we must continue to listen 
to those who came before us and teach 
this history to our future generations. 
These are the voices that my bill seeks 
to preserve. 
There are still some people who 
think that by walling off our country 
from the less fortunate, that we will 
somehow make ourselves safer; that by 
making people feel like the other, that 
we will be more secure. 
But that is not who the American 
people are. We have this wonderfully 
diverse Nation and it is together that 
we stand the strongest. 
The story of Japanese Americans is 
something that Bob and I felt a respon-
sibility to preserve; the history of indi-
viduals and families in the Japanese 
American community. And really, it is 
truly an American story of persever-
ance, persistence, and the love of this 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on educating our public 
about this important, painful piece of 
American history. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Ha-
waii (Mr. CASE). 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in strong support of H.R. 1931, the Jap-
anese 
American 
Confinement 
Edu-
cation Act, as well as H.R. 6434, the 
Japanese American World War II His-
tory Network Act, which we will con-
sider later today. 
I am honored and humbled to cospon-
sor these measures, and I sincerely 
thank my colleagues from California, 
Representatives 
MATSUI
and 
OBERNOLTE, for their work in crafting 
both pieces of legislation to ensure 
that the inexcusable injustices faced by 
our Nation’s Japanese American com-
munity during World War II are never 
forgotten. 
The memory of World War II evokes 
one of the darkest periods of our his-
tory as a country, the mass internment 
of 
Japanese 
Americans. 
Over 
the 
course of the war, our Federal Govern-
ment forcibly relocated and incarcer-
ated about 120,000 Japanese Americans, 
the majority of whom were U.S. citi-
zens, in barbed wire enclosed camps. 
H.R. 1931 and H.R. 6434 both strength-
en our ability, if not necessity, to tell 
what happened in these confinement 
sites, and to ensure that future genera-
tions learned what happened so it 
never occurs again. 
I urge my colleagues to honor and re-
member the Japanese Americans who 
were incarcerated at still-infamous 
sites like Manzanar, Tule Lake, where 
my wife’s uncle and aunt, simple truck 
farmers from Sacramento, were in-
terned, 
Heart 
Mountain, 
and 
the 
Honouliuli Internment Camp in Hono-
lulu by voting ‘‘yes’’ on both H.R. 1931 
and H.R. 6434. 
b 1500 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I en-
courage passage of this bill. 
I have friends back in Arkansas who, 
like Representative MATSUI, at a young 
age, were in some of these internment 
camps, and they are great Americans, 
very patriotic. We owe it to them to 
recognize what happened and to sup-
port this program.

March 15, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I, again, urge adoption, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
approval of H.R. 1931. The sponsor of 
the legislation, Representative MATSUI, 
and also Representative CASE
have 
made, I think, the profound argument 
for the legislation and its support. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 1931 the Japanese American 
Confinement Education Act that would provide 
education to elevate understanding about the 
confinement of Japanese Americans during 
World War II. In addition to a museum-based 
educational program, this bill would perma-
nently reauthorize the Japanese American 
Confinement Sites Preservation Program. 
H.R. 1931 will direct the Department of the 
Interior to establish a program of grants to 
Japanese American museums to educate 
about the confinement of Japanese Americans 
as a means to understand the importance of 
democratic principles, the use and abuse of 
power, and to raise awareness about the im-
portance of cultural tolerance toward Japa-
nese Americans. 
Two months after the Japanese bombed 
Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Roosevelt 
signed an Executive Order that authorized the 
relocation of Japanese Americans, most of 
whom were U.S. citizens, to designated 
camps nationwide. 
Teaching about the incarceration of Japa-
nese Americans during WWII would empha-
size the importance of understanding the ter-
rible social injustices that have been inflicted 
upon racial and ethnic minority groups in the 
United States. 
Highlighting this subject would create a 
thoughtful, deep awareness about our commu-
nity, our world, and ourselves. 
We must teach that the incarceration of Jap-
anese Americans was wrong, and that racism 
is wrong. 
This sort of hysteria may occur again, and 
people must do their part to make sure that it 
never happens again. 
Iluminating and confronting the tragedy in-
flicted upon Japanese Americans during WWII 
can help shape the citizens who will lead us 
into a more socially aware future. 
Keeping the memories of incarceration alive 
also gives Japanese Americans the ability and 
responsibility to speak out when other groups 
are unfairly targeted on the basis of race, eth-
nicity, gender, sexuality, or other identity. 
My former colleague Congressman Norman 
Mineta, who represented the constituents of 
California’s 13th and 15th Congressional dis-
tricts, is a survivor of the Heart Mountain in-
ternment camp near Cody, Wyoming. 
In his remarks during a House debate on 
the passage of the Civil Liberties Act, he ex-
claimed that he, and all the other prisoners, 
‘‘lost [their] most basic human rights. [Their] 
own government had branded [them] with the 
unwarranted stigma of disloyalty which clings 
to [them] still to this day.’’ 
Secretary Mineta helped lead the efforts to 
pass the Civil Liberties Act, which offered a 
formal apology from the United States Govern-
ment for its policies toward Japanese Ameri-
cans and paid each of the 80,000 living sur-
vivors $20,000 in compensation. 
His tenacity and faith led him to become a 
member of Congress for 20 years, Secretary 
of Commerce under President Bill Clinton, and 
Secretary of Transportation under President 
George W. Bush. 
It is our duty as Members of Congress to 
honor and commemorate Secretary Mineta, 
and all other survivors of this unjust racial at-
tack, by passing this bill and educating every-
one on these atrocities to ensure nothing like 
this will ever happen again. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1931, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

GUAM NATIONAL HERITAGE AREA 
STUDY 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2899) to direct the Secretary of 
the Interior to conduct a study to as-
sess the suitability and feasibility of 
designating areas within the island of 
Guam as a National Heritage Area, and 
for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2899 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. THE GUAM NATIONAL HERITAGE 
AREA STUDY. 
(a) STUDY.—

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona (Mr. GRIJALVA) and the gen-

Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2899, introduced by my Committee on 
Natural Resources colleague, Delegate 
SAN NICOLAS. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2899 authorizes the 
Secretary of the Interior to conduct a 
study to assess the suitability and fea-
sibility of designated areas within the 
island of Guam as national heritage 
areas. The study would cover the entire 
island of Guam and identify areas of 
natural, historic, and cultural impor-
tance that reflect the traditions, cus-
toms, beliefs, and folklife that rep-
resent distinct and nationally signifi-
cant aspects of the American story. 
I congratulate Delegate SAN NICOLAS 
for his strong advocacy in promoting 
this legislation on behalf of his con-
stituents, and I urge support from my 
colleagues on this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3726 
March 15, 2022 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 2899, offered by 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS of Guam, requires the 
Secretary of the Interior to conduct a 
study to assess the suitability and fea-
sibility of designating areas within the 
island of Guam as a national heritage 
area. 
Archaeological 
evidence 
indicates 
that the Mariana Islands were one of 
the first places settled by seafaring 
peoples. The last 400 years of Guam’s 
history are marked by administrations 
of three different nations: Spain, the 
United States, and Japan. After the 
Spanish-American War in 1898, Guam 
was ceded to the United States as an 
unincorporated territory. 
Guam’s rich history and culture 
merit consideration for national herit-
age area status. 
I support Congressman SAN NICOLAS’ 
bill to study areas within the island of 
Guam to determine whether they merit 
designation as a national heritage area 
in the future. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
the bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Guam (Mr. SAN 
NICOLAS), the sponsor of the legisla-
tion. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, 
Guam would like to begin by thanking 
the committee chairman for his leader-
ship on this measure, as well as the 
ranking member, the gentleman from 
Arkansas, for the unanimous support 
of the committee for this legislation, 
H.R. 2899, and the majority leader for 
us being able to bring this measure to 
the floor today. 
Madam Speaker, this bill would au-
thorize the National Park Service to 
conduct a study throughout the terri-
tory of Guam to identify sites that will 
be eligible for designation as national 
heritage areas. 
The first such designation occurred 
in 1984, signed into law by President 
Ronald Reagan. Since that time, 54 
other sites throughout the country 
have been so designated as national 
heritage areas, enjoying the rightful 
support of this Federal Government to 
preserve, promote, and enhance the sig-
nificance of these sites in the fabric of 
America. 
Madam Speaker, Guam, in relation 
to our capital, is our westernmost ter-
ritory, situated closer to Asia than 
America. Our island possesses one of 
the largest contiguous coral reefs in 
the country; a deep history that in-
cludes sites of Imperial Japanese occu-
pation, devastation, and decimation 
during World War II; over 300 years of 
Spanish colonization and subjugation; 
124 years as a U.S. possession; and 3,000 
years of present-day indigenous history 
carried on by the indigenous CHamoru 
people, who this month recognized 
CHamoru culture and history month 
with Mes CHamoru. 
Guam holds stories of resiliency, loy-
alty, triumph over struggle, and the 
struggle 
that 
is 
our 
present-day 
unreconciled relationship with these 
United States. It is the birthplace of 
patriots who gave their lives for this 
country; veterans who proudly served; 
and Americans through and through, 
who patiently yet persistently seek full 
inclusion in this great Nation. 
This legislation is but one of many 
steps we must take to fully acknowl-
edge the fabric of the territory of 
Guam and all territories in the tap-
estry that is American democracy. 
Our national heritage is not contig-
uous to a single landmass, nor is it ho-
mogeneous to any single people. It is, 
in fact, everything and everyone we are 
today 
and 
the 
confluence 
of 
cir-
cumstances that have brought us to 
this day. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues throughout this Congress to 
join our colleagues on the committee 
to secure unanimous passage of H.R. 
2899 as symbolic of the unanimity of 
this great Nation, the United States, 
Tribes, and territories of America. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
again, I urge adoption of the bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support the leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JACKSON, LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 2899, ‘‘To direct the 
Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study to 
assess the suitability and feasibility of desig-
nating areas within the island of Guam as a 
National Heritage Area, and for other pur-
poses.’’ 
Different from national parks, national herit-
age areas are community-based efforts that 
preserve and share stories about a region’s 
history and character. Heritage areas contain 
a mixture of public and private property, in-
cluding towns, historic sites, parks, trails, com-
mercial districts, and even working farms. 
National Heritage Areas are a grassroots, 
community-driven approach to heritage con-
servation 
and 
economic 
development. 
Through public-private partnerships, NHA enti-
ties support historic preservation, natural re-
source conservation, recreation, heritage tour-
ism, and educational projects. Leveraging 
funds and long-term support for projects, NHA 
partnerships foster pride of place and an en-
during stewardship ethic. 
When an area is designated as an NHA, its 
inhabitants don’t have to leave. An important 
aspect of NHAs is that they are intended as a 
celebration of a living environment, and they 
improve the local economy around them. 
The National Parks Service estimates NHAs 
average $5.50 for every $1.00 of federal in-
vestment, bolstering the local economies 
through their unique ‘‘heritage tourism.’’ 
Not only are NHAs economically friendly, 
but they are also climate friendly. Many NHAs 
improve water and air quality in their regions 
through restoration projects and encourage 
people to enjoy natural and cultural sites by 
providing new recreational opportunities. 
Guam is much more than sun, sea, and 
sand. The island is awash with a history that 
dates back to the Latte Period of 2000BC, the 
period of Ancient Chamorro life before a 
Spanish expedition led by Portuguese explorer 
Ferdinand Magellan arrived on March 6, 1521. 
With 131 sites around the island listed on 
the National Register of Historic Places, these 
historical landmarks weave a fascinating tale 
of the island’s struggles, resilience, and vic-
tories over thousands of years. Though the is-
land’s colorful history spans the Spanish era, 
the American period, and Japanese WWII oc-
cupation, today Guam is most widely cele-
brated for its native Chamorro culture and 
pride. 
Chamorros are the indigenous people of the 
Mariana Islands of which Guam is the largest 
and southernmost on an island chain. Archeo-
logical evidence identified civilization dating 
back 5,000 years. 
Their vernacular, called the Chamorro lan-
guage, is interestingly not a Micronesian dia-
lect but a distinct language with its own vocab-
ulary and grammar. 
Therefore, 
considering 
the 
richness 
of 
Guam’s land and its peoples, it brings me 
much joy to rise in strong support of H.R. 
2899. I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
It is for that reason, Madam Speaker, that I 
urge my colleagues to support this legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). The question is on the 
motion offered by the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 2899. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

MODERNIZING ACCESS TO OUR 
PUBLIC LAND ACT 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from Ar-
izona (Mr. GRIJALVA) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 3113, the Modernizing Access to 
Our Public Land Act, or MAPLand Act, 
introduced by my Committee on Nat-
ural Resources colleague, Representa-
tive BLAKE MOORE. 
Our committee has long focused on 
sportsmen’s access to public lands. I 
am pleased that shortly after I became 
chair, we were able to pass the bipar-
tisan John D. Dingell, Jr. Conserva-
tion, Management, and Recreation Act, 
which included an entire title on 
sportsmen’s access. 
The MAPLand Act would build on 
that law, as well as the investments 
made by the Great American Outdoors 
Act, to help ensure that hunters, an-
glers, and all Americans can more eas-
ily find information and resources to 
help facilitate public lands access. 
Representative MOORE’s bill would 
direct the Department of the Interior, 
the Forest Service, and the Army 
Corps of Engineers to jointly develop 
and adopt standards to ensure database 
compatibility for the collection and 
sharing of outdoor recreation data re-
lated to Federal lands. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive MOORE for championing this bill 
on behalf of everyone who enjoys our 
public lands, and I urge my colleagues 
to support the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I also rise in sup-
port, along with Chairman GRIJALVA, 
and I thank him for his support of H.R. 
3113, the MAPLand Act, offered by the 
ranking member of the Natural Re-
sources Subcommittee on Oversight 
and Investigations, Mr. BLAKE MOORE 
of Utah. 
This bill directs the Department of 
the Interior, the U.S. Forest Service, 
and the Army Corps of Engineers to 
jointly develop and adopt interagency 
standards for the collection and dis-
semination of outdoor recreation data 
on Federal lands. 
Our 
Nation’s 
outdoorsmen 
and 
-women are increasingly reliant on dig-
ital mapping and GPS technologies to 
hunt, fish, and enjoy other recreation 
activities on our Nation’s complicated 
patchwork of Federal lands. Unfortu-
nately, inconsistent and incomplete 
digital mapping data frequently pre-
vents the public and Federal land man-
agement agencies from maximizing the 
full benefits of these technologies. 
Mr. MOORE’s bill requires our Federal 
land management agencies to digitize 
records of easements and rights-of-way 
across private lands so the public will 
have a better understanding of Federal 
land access points and ensure that 
Americans recreating stay safe and 
avoid trespassing. 
Outdoor recreation is vital to our Na-
tion’s economy, and the way we expand 
outdoor recreation is to expand access. 
Madam Speaker, I commend Mr. 
MOORE for his hard work on this impor-
tant legislation to modernize our Fed-
eral land management records, and I 
urge adoption of the measure. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. MOORE).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3728 
March 15, 2022 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to urge my colleagues 
to support H.R. 3113, the Modernizing 
Access to Our Public Land Act, or 
MAPLand Act. 
Access to America’s lands is critical. 
Driven in part by the COVID–19 pan-
demic, we are seeing more people hunt, 
fish, hike, and bike than ever before. 
Recreating on these lands creates fond 
memories, improves the physical and 
mental health of Americans, and con-
tributes significantly to our economy. 
Each year, outdoor recreation across 
the country injects $887 billion into our 
economy. These dollars support com-
munities in Utah and nationwide, con-
tribute to high-paying jobs, and con-
nect us through our shared hobbies and 
interests. 
There are roughly 640 million acres of 
land in the Federal estate. Of these, 
more than 9 million acres in the West-
ern United States have no permanent 
legal means of access. 
Land users understand firsthand the 
shortage of information that exists on 
which lands are opened, how they can 
be accessed, and more. In fact, tens of 
thousands of important land access 
files are currently outdated or only in 
paper form, filling up cabinets in office 
building basements. This just simply 
isn’t good enough for the 21st century. 
This lack of access to crucial infor-
mation prevents us from enjoying all 
that our lands have to offer, and it 
makes it more difficult for the hard-
working employees at our land man-
agement agencies to do their jobs. 
It is time to fix these problems by 
modernizing the data behind our Fed-
eral lands. My bill, H.R. 3113, the 
MAPLand Act, will do just that. 
Madam Speaker, this bipartisan and 
bicameral 
commonsense 
legislation 
will help our Federal land management 
agencies work together better by cre-
ating shared data standards and im-
proving the digital information avail-
able to all who visit our lands. 
Making this information more de-
tailed and accessible in the digital age 
is one of the many reasons why this 
bill enjoys such broad support. This is 
about helping families spend more time 
together outside, about improving the 
way that our government works, and 
about fostering and sharing the joy of 
the great outdoors. 
b 1515 
I am grateful to Ranking Members 
FULCHER and WESTERMAN and Chair-
men NEGUSE and GRIJALVA for cospon-
soring the MAPLand Act and helping 
drive it forward. 
I am also grateful for staff members 
and stakeholder groups who worked 
closely with my office at all hours on 
this important effort that will bring 
our lands into the 21st century. This 
has truly been a collaborative effort 
that will reverberate for years to come 
and one that I have been proud to be a 
part of. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support my legislation, and 
I hope my colleagues in the Senate will 
consider and pass this important bill 
expeditiously. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I encourage adoption of this common-
sense bill. It will be very beneficial to 
provide better access to our outdoor 
recreation areas, and I think it would 
also be a great benefit to Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
concur 
with 
Ranking 
Member 
WESTERMAN and urge support of the 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 3113, the 
‘‘Modernizing Access to Our Public Land Act,’’ 
or the MAPLand Act, which will make it easier 
for every American to access data for outdoor 
recreation possibilities. 
It directs the Department of the Interior, the 
Forest Service, and the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers to jointly develop and adopt stand-
ards to ensure compatibility among federal 
databases for the collection and dissemination 
of outdoor recreation data related to federal 
lands. 
The Department of the Interior, the Forest 
Service, and the Corps of Engineers must 
digitize and publish geographic information 
system mapping data that includes: 
federal interests, including easements and 
rights-of-way, in private land; 
status information as to whether roads and 
trails are open or closed; 
the dates on which roads and trails are sea-
sonally opened and closed; 
the types of vehicles that are allowed on 
each segment of roads and trails; 
the boundaries of areas where hunting or 
recreational shooting is regulated or closed; 
and 
the boundaries of any portion of a body of 
water that is closed to entry, is closed to 
watercraft, or has horsepower limitations for 
watercraft. 
The MAPLand Act’s stipulations will provide 
essential information to all Americans who 
wish to spend time on our beautiful public 
lands. 
Because of the provisions in this bill, Ameri-
cans will have the most up to date information 
about the trail they wish to hike, stream or 
lake they wish to fish on, or regulations of 
grounds on which they wish to hunt. 
This ensures that all Americans will be safe 
while exploring our great outdoors, making this 
legislation’s passage of the utmost necessity. 
This bill would also allow our agencies to 
manage and plan more effectively while also 
reducing the potential for access-related con-
flicts between recreators and private land-
owners. Simply put, this legislation promises 
to help more people get outdoors. 
Currently, more than 9.52 million acres of 
land in the West lack permanent and legal ac-
cess points for public use, and information on 
these lands is still kept on paper files. 
Approximately 5,000 of the Forest Service’s 
37,000 
recorded 
easements 
have 
been 
digitized and uploaded to an electronic data-
base. The MAPLand Act would help give fed-
eral land management agencies the resources 
they need to digitize these files for public use, 
as well as require these agencies to provide 
information on seasonal vehicle restrictions on 
public roads and trails, hunting boundaries, 
and watercraft restrictions. 
Madam Speaker, it is for these reasons that 
I strongly support H.R. 3113, the MAPLand 
Act and therefore urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation as well. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3113, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

(Mr.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 3197, the Save the Liberty Theatre 
Act introduced by my colleague Rep-
resentative MIKE JOHNSON. 
This bill would direct the Secretary 
of the Interior to convey a small piece 
of the historic Liberty Theatre to the 
city of Eunice, Louisiana. Although 
the theater is owned and operated by 
the city, it is adjacent to the Prairie 
Arcadian Cultural Center, which is 
owned by the National Park Service as 
a unit of Jean Lafitte National Histor-
ical Park. 
In the 1980s, the Park Service ended 
up building an annex to the theater in 
order to construct an ADA compliant 
ramp and to house an air conditioning 
system for the two buildings. Now, the 
city of Eunice plans to build its own 
HVAC system. Consolidation of the 
property is a win-win: It will allow re-
habilitation of the Liberty Theatre to 
move forward and decrease operating 
costs for the National Park Service. 
This is a commonsense piece of legis-
lation, and I am pleased to support it 
today. I thank Representative JOHNSON 
for bringing this bill forward and bring-
ing it to our attention, and I urge our 
colleagues 
to 
support 
the 
passage 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I also rise in sup-
port, along with Chairman GRIJALVA, 
of H.R. 3197, the Save the Liberty The-
atre Act, offered by Mr. JOHNSON of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. JOHNSON’s bill transfers a feder-
ally owned annex to the city of Eunice, 
Louisiana, so the city can complete 
critical renovations to the historic Lib-
erty Theatre. 
Transferring this annex will allow 
the park to replace the HVAC system 
in the adjacent Prairie Acadian Cul-
tural Center and allow the city of Eu-
nice to install a new HVAC system in 
the theater and perform other renova-
tions that are currently hindered due 
to the Natural Park Services’ owner-
ship interest. This transfer will result 
in cost savings for the National Park 
Service and the taxpayer. 
Madam Speaker, I commend Mr. 
JOHNSON for his work to save this im-
portant Louisiana landmark and build-
ing local support for his legislation. I 
urge adoption of the measure, and I 
hope that the Senate will take up this 
bill very soon. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support the leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.

Representative 
VERONICA 
ESCOBAR. 
On August 3, 2019, El Paso, Texas, 
was the target of a horrific domestic 
terrorist attack that took 23 lives, in-
jured another 23 people, and devastated 
communities across the Nation. 
The mass shooting occurred at a 
Walmart Supercenter on the east side 
of El Paso and is arguably the deadliest 
targeted attack against Latinos in 
modern American history. 
Following the attack, the county of 
El Paso approved the construction of 
the El Paso Community Healing Gar-
den to provide the community with a 
space to honor victims and survivors 
and to heal. 
My heart goes out to all the victims 
of this horrific attack. While I know 
there is nothing we can do to turn back 
the clock, I hope that our efforts to 
recognize this site as a national memo-
rial will help bring some solace and 
healing to the community. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive ESCOBAR for championing this bill, 
and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, along with Chair-
man GRIJALVA, I rise in support of H.R. 
4380, which would designate the El 
Paso Healing Garden in El Paso, Texas, 
as a national memorial. 
On August 3, 2019, 23 people tragically 
lost their lives and more than 20 were 
injured when a gunman opened fire at a 
Walmart in El Paso. In 2020, the county 
of El Paso approved the construction of 
the El Paso Community Healing Gar-
den to provide a space to honor victims 
and survivors and aid in the healing 
process. 
I hope that the El Paso Healing Gar-
den will continue to bring peace and 
comfort to the families who lost loved 
ones in this senseless and horrific at-
tack. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
ESCOBAR), the sponsor of the legisla-
tion. 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong and enthusiastic 
support of my bill, H.R. 4380, the El 
Paso Community Healing Garden Na-
tional Memorial Act. 
My bill will designate the El Paso 
Healing Garden at Ascarate Park in El 
Paso, Texas, as a national memorial, 
and help ensure that our entire country 
honors the 23 innocent lives we lost in

March 15, 2022 
the attack on El Paso on August 3, 
2019. 
I rise today for my legislation, but I 
also rise in memory of the 23 souls who 
were killed by a domestic terrorist. I 
rise for the 22 other victims who were 
injured in the attack. I rise for their 
loved ones—their families, friends, and 
for an entire community rocked by 
white supremacy. 
On the morning of August 3, 2019, a 
21-year-old gunman drove more than 11 
hours and hundreds of miles to get to 
El Paso. He used an AK–47 and opened 
fire at a busy Walmart while families 
were shopping for groceries, getting 
their prescriptions filled, and buying 
school supplies for their children. He 
killed couples, grandparents, siblings, 
brand new parents. His youngest vic-
tim was just 15 years old. It was the 
deadliest targeted attack on Latinos in 
modern American history. 
The weapon he used wasn’t just in-
tended to kill—an AK–47 rips flesh, 
bones, and arteries to shreds. Most of 
the survivors from the attack don’t 
just live with the scars that we can’t 
see in front of us, but they live with 
unbelievable physical agony, and they 
also have to shoulder the financial con-
sequences of ongoing surgeries and 
medical care, even years later. 
When he turned himself in, the do-
mestic terrorist confessed to police 
that he drove to El Paso to slaughter 
Mexicans and immigrants. He pub-
lished a screed online just before the 
massacre, and in it he cited the anti- 
immigrant Great Replacement theory 
and xenophobic hate speech, claiming 
that he was combating what he called 
the ‘‘Hispanic invasion of Texas.’’ 
This is the same language, these are 
the same theories, the same hate and 
racism that we still hear today from 
rightwing public figures and the former 
President, whose favorite scapegoats 
are still vulnerable immigrants. 
These people should have seen that 
their words have power. Unfortunately, 
however, instead of learning from this 
tragedy, racists and supremacists have 
grown more emboldened. And why 
wouldn’t they? They are radicalized 
nightly by a national media outlet dis-
guised as ‘‘news’’ that runs unchecked, 
their talking points openly parroted by 
leaders here, in the Halls of Congress. 
Our safe, loving, welcoming commu-
nity, a community of good will, is seen 
as a threat by people with hate in their 
heart. The language of hate draws a 
target on the backs of the most vulner-
able. On August 3, El Paso paid the 
price. 
El Pasoans, however, came together 
in the immediate aftermath of this 
shooting and we did what we do best: 
take care of each other, stand united, 
stand in love. We represent the best of 
America, and El Pasoans continue to 
be a source of great hope for me. 
El Paso is strong. We are resilient. 
But we deserve justice and recognition. 
I am honored to help ensure that what 
happened in El Paso is not forgotten, 
not anywhere, not in any corner of this 
country. That we remember every vic-
tim and we work to prevent more trag-
edy. 
Madam Speaker, I will close by shar-

Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
again, I support this bipartisan bill. It 
is unfortunate that with regard to 
something that had so much agreement 
on it that people would point fingers at 
political figures or political move-
ments and try to assign the actions of 
a disturbed, radical individual to a po-
litical party or to a political figure. 
Madam Speaker, I do support this, I 
wish that the debate hadn’t gone in 
this direction, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CASTRO). 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, the gun violence epidemic has 
horribly impacted American commu-
nities across the Nation. Texas is no 
exception, and neither was El Paso. 
In 2019 the El Paso community was 
shaken to its core when a crazed gun-
man drove more than 11 hours to stop 
what he called the ‘‘Hispanic invasion 
of Texas.’’ 
All of us know that his hatred and 
bigotry was encouraged from the high-
est levels of our government and 
played upon stereotypes developed in 
American media from hard news to 
Hollywood for generations. 
This appalling event led to 23 inno-
cent lives being cut short and dozens 
injured in the deadliest targeted attack 
on Latinos in modern American his-
tory. 
But El Paso did not collapse in the 
face of tragedy. Instead, they banded 
together to mourn their loved ones and 
rebuild their community, and we, as 
Americans, stood with them. That 
summer we were all ‘‘El Paso strong.’’ 
By designating the El Paso Commu-
nity Healing Garden as a federally rec-
ognized national memorial site, we will 
continue to honor the victims and pro-
vide solace to survivors who have 
shown their remarkable strength and 
resiliency on their path to healing. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support 
my friend, Representative ESCOBAR’s, 
bill, H.R. 4380, and I urge my colleagues 
to do the same. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding me 
the time. 
I rise in strong commitment and rec-
ognition of this healing garden legisla-
tion, H.R. 4380, and I thank my col-
leagues, 
Congresswoman 
ESCOBAR, 
whose legislation it is, Congressmen 
CASTRO and GRIJALVA, and the gen-
tleman from Arkansas for recognizing, 
first of all, that we stand united in the 
acknowledgment of the pain and vio-
lence that these families experienced 
and the tragedy of someone coming to 
target innocent families and children 
and bestowing upon innocent persons 
that they were invading this country, 
this country who has the Statute of 
Liberty that says bring us your tired 
and your weary. 
I want to congratulate Congress-
woman ESCOBAR for the leadership that 
she gave and the strength that she 
showed. I saw her as I traveled to El 
Paso. She truly exhibited ‘‘El Paso 
strong’’ as so many of us came to 
mourn with her. We were broken, but 
we were resolved that we would never 
stand for this again. It was a terrorist 
act, and it was against people simply 
because of their race and their ethnic 
background. 
I visited those in the hospital who 
were wounded, some of whom died 
later. I attended funerals where fami-
lies lost mothers and fathers. I will 
never forget this enormous and dev-
astating tragedy and the viciousness of 
this act. 
So I rise to support this legislation, 
to say never again, and to thank Con-
gresswoman ESCOBAR for reminding us 
that we are Americans and this vio-
lence and this hatefulness will not 
stand. We ask those in leadership posi-
tions to not call names of people who 
are of backgrounds they don’t under-
stand. 
Let us stand in prayer and unity for 
the families in El Paso. 
Mr. 
WESTERMAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
again, I urge adoption of this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking 
member for helping bring this to the 
floor. 
Representative ESCOBAR’s particular 
piece of legislation is not merely a re-
minder or a political statement. It is a 
memorial, an acknowledgment of a 
tragedy, and an acknowledgment of the 
need for reconciliation, the need for 
healing, the need for understanding, 
and the need to have the conversations 
as communities that we need to have 
so that if we do nothing else to prevent 
this kind of deranged violence, we can 
at least begin to heal and talk about 
the issue in a way that maybe reaches

part of that end to reduce this kind of 
violence and violence in general. 
I speak from limited experience but 
vital experience. Our former colleague, 
Representative Giffords, was in an at-
tempted assassination. Six people died 
at the Congress on Your Corner where 
she would hold events for people to 
come and talk to her about the issues 
facing our Nation and facing the dis-
trict, that unique ability of this de-
mocracy of ours for their elected offi-
cials to be accessible to the public that 
they represent. 
She was shot, almost died, and sur-
vived, and we have a memorial to that 
event in Tucson. It has proven to be a 
rallying point, it has proven to be a 
great instrument for nonviolence, and 
it is a forum for discussion and growth, 
the growth of tolerance and under-
standing in Tucson, Arizona. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this 
legislation, I thank the ranking mem-
ber for his leadership, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). The question is on the 
motion offered by the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. GRIJALVA) that the House

UPPER COLORADO AND SAN JUAN 
RIVER BASINS RECOVERY ACT 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 5001) to authorize the Sec-
retary of the Interior to continue to 
implement endangered fish recovery 
programs for the Upper Colorado and 
San Juan River Basins, and for other 
purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5001 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Upper Colorado 
and San Juan River Basins Recovery Act’’. 
SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZATIONS RE-
LATED TO FISH RECOVERY PRO-
GRAMS. 
Section 3 of Public Law 106–392 (114 Stat. 1603 
et seq.) is amended—

izona (Mr. GRIJALVA) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Arizona. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5001, introduced by my Natural 
Resources Committee colleague, Rep-
resentative JOE NEGUSE of Colorado. 
This bipartisan bill will reauthorize 
two programs that are working to re-
cover threatened and endangered fish 
in the Upper Colorado River Basin. 
This legislation will continue the 
collaboration work of Tribes, water 
users, environmental groups, local util-
ities, and State and Federal agencies 
that are partnering to recover four fish 
species currently listed under the En-
dangered Species Act as either threat-
ened or endangered. 
These programs provide Endangered 
Species Act compliance for projects 
that use water resources from the San 
Juan River and Upper Colorado River 
Basins, so that these rare native fish 
can be recovered while human water 
use can continue. 
With the conservation actions under-
taken through the recovery programs, 
one fish was downlisted from endan-
gered to threatened last year, and an-
other fish is under consideration for 
downlisting to threatened as well. This 
good work is important, and it should 
continue. 
I want to commend my colleague, the 
chair of the National Parks, Forests, 
and Public Lands Subcommittee, Rep-
resentative NEGUSE, for his leadership 
on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 5001 would ex-
tend the Upper Colorado and San Juan 
recovery implementation programs and 
their reporting requirements for an ad-
ditional year. 
The programs provide Endangered 
Species Act compliance for more than 
2,500 water and power projects that 
withdraw more than 3.7 million-acre 
feet of water for human needs. 
The program’s goals are to recover 
four endangered fish species while con-
tinuing facility operations with the ul-
timate goal of species delisting. Last 
year, the Fish and Wildlife Service re-
classified one of these species, the 
humpback chub, from endangered to 
threatened, and proposed a similar re-
classification for the razorback sucker. 
Madam Speaker, if it has razorback 
in the name, it has to be important, 
and we need to take care of it. 
Current law required the Secretary of 
the Interior to submit a report to Con-
gress by September 30, 2021, on rec-
ommendations for the programs post 
2023. Unfortunately, the Department of 
the Interior failed to meet this dead-
line. As such we are here today extend-
ing the programs by 1 year in order to 
give the administration enough time to 
complete the report. 
While I support the extension today, 
I want to be clear that any further ex-
tension of the programs will require an 
in-depth discussion of the programs’ 
goals, achievements, and administra-
tive overhead costs. 
In closing, Madam Speaker, again, I 
support this bill, I support the razor-
back sucker, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, it 
is good to know that the ranking mem-
ber has a weakness, and so we are 
going to put razorback in every piece 
of legislation from now on. 
Madam Speaker, I have no further 
speakers, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 5001, ‘‘the Upper 
Colorado and San Juan River Basins Recov-
ery Act’’ which extends through FY2024 the 
authority of the Department of the Interior to 
implement construction of facilities for the en-
dangered fish recovery programs for the 
Upper Colorado and San Juan River basins. 
The bill also extends through FY2022 the 
deadline for the submission of the report on 
the recovery implementation programs. 
The Upper Colorado River Basin is home to 
14 native fish species, including the endan-
gered humpback chub, bonytail, Colorado 
pikeminnow, and razorback sucker. These en-
dangered fish are found only in the Colorado 
River system. 
The Recovery Program is a unique partner-
ship of local, state, and federal agencies, 
water and power interests, and environmental 
groups working to recover endangered fish in 
the Upper Colorado River Basin while water 
development proceeds in accordance with fed-
eral and state laws and interstate compacts. 
The Upper Colorado River Endangered Fish 
Recovery Program was first established in 
1988 to help bring four species of endangered 
fish back from the brink of extinction: the 
humpback 
chub, 
bonytail, 
Colorado 
pikeminnow, and razorback sucker. 
This bill will protect those 14 endangered 
fish species in the Upper Colorado and San 
Juan River Basin and allow critical water infra-
structure projects to continue. 
The Colorado River provides water to nearly 
40 million people, flows through 9 National 
Parks, and drives a $1.4 trillion economy. If 
the Colorado River basin were a country, it 
would be the world’s 7th largest by economic 
output. 
On average, 90 percent of streamflow in the 
Colorado River Basin originates in the Upper

Basin, which is the area above Lees Ferry, Ar-
izona. This water has a multitude of uses that 
include irrigation, municipal and industrial pur-
poses, mining activities, recreation, and sup-
porting habitat for livestock, fish and wildlife. 
The Colorado River Basin also has an im-
mense capacity to generate hydropower. Hun-
dreds of hydroelectric dams along the river’s 
main stem and tributaries have a combined 
generating capacity of approximately 4,178 
megawatts, making it part of the solution for 
combatting climate change. 
But the river is stretched to its limit. Climate 
change and increasing water demand due to 
an expanding population is and will continue 
present significant challenges that if left 
unaddressed, will impact regional and national 
economies, degrade the environment, chal-
lenge agricultural heritage and food produc-
tion, and limit recreational opportunities from 
fishing and boating to skiing. 
Protecting this river basin and its biodiver-
sity is therefore of the utmost importance. 
Without its biodiversity, this river basin will be 
thrown out of equilibrium and cease to func-
tion and subsequently provide as it has for 
centuries. 
This would create a humanitarian disaster 
for 40 million people and economic disaster 
for countless more, in addition to the loss of 
incomparable natural beauty and endangered 
life. 
However, under the leadership of Secretary 
Deb Haaland, whom I hold in the highest re-
gard, I am certain that these 14 species of fish 
and in turn the Colorado River Basin can be 
saved, averting unquestionable disaster for 
millions. 
This Act is common sense, bipartisan, and 
ultimately needed legislation that I am proud 
to support. It is for that reason that I urge my 
colleagues to support H.R. 5001, The Upper 
Colorado and San Juan River Basins Recov-
ery Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA) that the House suspend the

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
for the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 
6434, 
the 
Japanese 
American 
World War II History Network Act, in-
troduced by my Natural Resources 
Committee colleague, Representative 
JAY OBERNOLTE. 
This bill will direct the Secretary of 
the Interior to establish the Japanese 
American World War II History Net-
work within the National Park Serv-
ice. 
Between 1942 and 1945, the U.S. Gov-
ernment wrongfully imprisoned ap-
proximately 120,000 Japanese Ameri-
cans, most of whom were U.S. citizens. 
Many of the U.S. Government’s activi-
ties during World War II were done in 
secrecy and were not accurately rep-
resented to the public in the years 
after the war. 
Designating this network will sup-
port education and awareness of the 
people, places, and events that were as-
sociated with the wrongful incarcer-
ation of Japanese Americans. 
This effort will be a welcome com-
plement 
to 
the 
existing 
Japanese 
American Confinement Sites Grant 
Program, which we are looking to re-
authorize 
and 
strengthen 
today 
through Representative MATSUI’s legis-
lation, which we considered earlier this 
afternoon. 
I thank Representative OBERNOLTE 
for championing this legislation, and I 
urge my colleagues to support it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.R. 6434, offered by my committee col-
league, Mr. OBERNOLTE of California, to 
establish a Japanese American World 
War II History Network within the Na-
tional Park Service. 
As Chairman GRIJALVA stated, this 
bill is complementary to the previous 
bill we considered today with the JACS 
program in it. 
Following the attack on Pearl Har-
bor, tens of thousands of Japanese 
Americans were forcibly removed from 
the West Coast to relocation centers 
across the United States. Japanese

Americans were imprisoned without 
trial and forced to relocate to some of 
the most remote areas of our country, 
with few personal belongings. My State 
of Arkansas was home to two reloca-
tion camps, Rohwer in Desha County 
and Jerome in Chicot and Drew Coun-
ties. 
Mr. OBERNOLTE’s bill, which I have 
proudly cosponsored, would establish a 
cohesive national network to increase 
the visibility of all sites related to the 
Japanese American experience during 
World War II. The network will be 
similar to existing networks estab-
lished in recent years to connect sites 
associated with the Underground Rail-
road, the Reconstruction era, and the 
African American civil rights move-
ment. 
At the legislative hearing, Mr. Bruce 
Saito, 
chair 
of 
the 
Friends 
of 
Manzanar, testified about this critical 
network, saying: ‘‘We must continue to 
strengthen the network and continue 
to connect the dots through the net-
work so this tragic and very important 
lesson in history is never forgotten.’’ 
The new network will be an impor-
tant tool to ensure that this history, 
no matter how painful it may be, is al-
ways remembered, and the important 
stories of interned Japanese Americans 
are told with honor and respect. 
In 
addition 
to 
the 
Friends 
of 
Manzanar, we have received letters of 
support from the Amache Preservation 
Society, the National Conference of 
State Historic Preservation Officers, 
the National Japanese American His-
torical Society, and the Arkansas His-
toric Preservation Program. 
I commend Mr. OBERNOLTE for his 
work on this important legislation 
that will help future generations learn 
from and reflect on the experiences of 
Japanese Americans during World War 
II. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairman for his support, 
and I thank Mr. OBERNOLTE for intro-
ducing the legislation. I urge adoption 
of the bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. OBERNOLTE, our colleague on 
the committee, and Ms. MATSUI, a 
former colleague on the committee, for 
two pieces of very important legisla-
tion that look at the realism that we 
need to look at in terms of our history

ABORTION PROVIDER 
APPRECIATION DAY 
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, today, I rise to recognize 
Abortion Provider Appreciation Day. 
In March of 1993, Dr. David Gunn was 
killed outside his abortion clinic by a 
white supremacist, anti-abortion ex-
tremist. To honor his legacy, this day 
was established. 
Last week, his children, David, Jr., 
and Wendy, joined a deeply moving 
press conference to celebrate the essen-
tial, 
compassionate, 
necessary 
healthcare 
providers 
deliver 
coura-
geously, despite pressures, restrictions, 
political 
interference, 
and 
violent 
threats to their personal safety. 
I want to recognize two incredible 
abortion providers and tireless advo-
cates in my district, Renee Chelian, 
the founder of Northland Family Plan-
ning, and her daughter Lara, and the 
work these women do in our commu-
nities to make reproductive healthcare 
accessible to all. 
I urge my colleagues to join in this 
important 
affirmation 
of 
Congress’ 
commitment to abortion providers. 
f 
CELEBRATING SAVANNAH STATE’S 
MEN’S BASKETBALL TEAM 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
tremendous season of the Savannah 
State 
University 
men’s 
basketball 
team. 
The upset-minded Tigers have won 
their first Southern Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference championship title 
since 1981. 
Topping off a four-game win streak 
with a conference championship vic-
tory, the Tigers went into the SIAC 
championship game as the underdog 
against Benedict College. 
This 
historic 
team 
struggled 
throughout the season, entering the 
post-season 11–13, but came together as 
a team and found a way to win when it 
mattered most. 
I am so proud of the team that Head 
Coach Horace Broadnax has put to-
gether at Savannah State University. 
He is helping these young men unlock 
their full athletic potential. 
The season is not over, as the Tigers 
are now preparing for their shot at the 
NCAA 
Division 
II 
National 
Tour-
nament. This has not been an easy sea-
son by any means, but the Tigers have 
momentum and drive to keep them 
moving forward. 
Gentlemen, good luck in the tour-
nament. 
DELIVERING RESULTS FOR THE 
PEOPLE 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, in just the last few weeks, Congress 
has sent a number of critical bills to 
President Biden’s desk. 
This includes legislation to finally 
make lynching a Federal hate crime, 
after more than 200 attempts across a 
century. 
It includes sweeping legislation to re-
form and repair the Postal Service, en-
suring every American gets their mail 
on time. 
And it includes the government fund-
ing bill signed into law by the Presi-
dent today. The law reauthorizes the 
Violence Against Women Act, sends 
critical aid to Ukraine, cuts childcare 
and education costs for families, sup-
ports our veterans, launches President 
Biden’s Cancer Moonshot initiative, 
and so much more. 
What is more, this flurry of activity 
comes on top of the historic bipartisan 
infrastructure law. 
Together with President Biden, we 
are delivering results for the people— 
results not rhetoric, solutions not 
sound bites, headway not headlines.

CELEBRATING NATIONAL K9 
VETERANS DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, over the weekend, we 
celebrated National K9 Veterans Day. 
This day is set to honor the service and 
sacrifice of American military and 
working dogs throughout history. 
Military working dogs are vital to 
our military missions. Dogs can help 
sense incoming artillery, locate wound-
ed soldiers, deliver messages between 
troops, and provide a much-needed mo-
rale boost on the front line. 
The original war dog is Sergeant 
Stubby, the most decorated war dog of 
World War I. He saw four offensives and 
17 battles. Despite numerous injuries, 
he always returned to his regiment. 
Stubby’s ability to warn of poison 
gas attacks, locate wounded soldiers, 
and alert his unit to incoming artillery 
shells ultimately earned him the rank 
of sergeant. 
Madam Speaker, we recognize our 
military working dogs on March 13 be-
cause on that day in 1942, the U.S. K9 
Corps was officially created. 
Today, there are more than 3,000 
military working dogs deployed around 
the globe. They are trained to perform 
a wide variety of critical and often 
dangerous tasks. 
Their work to support our service-
members and service to our country 
should not go unrecognized. 
FUNDING COMMUNITY PROJECTS 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
last week, Congress passed the com-
prehensive 
bipartisan 
government 
funding bill that, for the first time in 
over a decade, delivered direct relief to 
community funding projects. 
In my district, I worked with local 
and State elected officials, city and 
town managers, nonprofit organiza-
tions, and community and business 
leaders to identify top infrastructure, 
social services, and healthcare projects 
in need of Federal investment. 
I thank the Appropriations Com-
mittee for fully funding all of these re-
quests, which included a new workforce 
development 
institute 
for 
offshore 
wind, the expansion of a domestic vio-
lence shelter and a community health 
center, multiple projects to provide 
clean water for my constituents, dam 
and dredging improvements to protect 
against 
flooding 
disasters, 
and 
a 
project to support economic develop-
ment. 
This funding bill represents a shift in 
Congress toward partnerships, good 
policy, and action. We must work to 
further advance bipartisan progress in 
the years ahead.

CONTROLLING THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, last 
week, I joined several of my Repub-
lican colleagues on an official trip to 
view the southern border in Arizona. 
We received an operational briefing 
from the Border Patrol stationed in 
Yuma and toured their processing cen-
ter. We also went on field tours to see 
the halted construction of the border 
wall and a staging site used by cartels 
for smuggling children across the bor-
der. 
I was horrified by what I saw. When 
President Biden halted construction of 
the border wall, he left giant strips of 
the border wide open for cartels to 
smuggle illegal drugs and even human 
trafficking victims into our country, 
women and children being abused in 
ways that are unimaginable. 
I was appalled to learn how the cartel 
recycles the child victims so that they 
are basically the conduit to bring 
adults across. Then, when they are 
done with that child inside this coun-
try, they take them back and recycle 
them again through the process. 
They prey on families by telling 
them what they think they owe to the 
cartel and use their children in such a 
way. The filth, the trash left behind, 
the containers of drugs and pills you 
find there in the arroyos, in the wash-
es, it is horrific all the way around. We 
must control our border.

HOLODOMOR IN UKRAINE 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
tomorrow, we are going to be addressed 
by the head of state from Ukraine. 
I have been talking to people—young 
people, students, older people—about if 
they know the background between 
those 
countries, 
specifically 
the 
Holodomor, a starvation of the Ukrain-
ian people that took place in 1932 and 
1933. 
I am shocked. I bet less than 10 per-
cent of Americans know that 4 mil-
lion—4 to 15 million, but at least 4 mil-
lion—Ukrainians were starved to death 
by the Communist government in the 
early 1930s. 
Even less, I am sure, know that for 
misreporting this starvation, a guy by 
the name of Walter Duranty, from The 
New York Times, received a Pulitzer 
Prize for covering it up. So, this left-
wing bias out of The New York Times 
is not something that started today. 
They, of course, hated the people who 
were starved because they were inde-
pendent farmers, and the Communist 
Party hates independent, family-ori-
ented people. 
f 
UNLOCKING RURAL AMERICA’S 
POTENTIAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MANNING). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman 
from 
Washington 
(Mr. 
NEWHOUSE) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
before I begin, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members may have 5 leg-
islative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the topic of my spe-
cial order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
hope it is clear to all of my colleagues 
in this body that rural America faces a 
myriad of challenges. 
Every day, members of the Congres-
sional Western Caucus, of which I am 
very honored to be chairman, and 
many partners throughout rural Amer-
ica are working to ensure that local 
communities across the country are 
heard in our Nation’s Capitol, right 
here, and that these challenges do not 
go unaddressed. 
For many in big cities and urban 
areas, I think it can be pretty easy to 
overlook our rural communities. But 
we truly are the backbone of our great 
country, and our challenges are not our 
challenges alone. Rather, they are re-
flective of the entire Nation’s chal-
lenges, things like managing public 
lands and fulfilling the government’s 
multipurpose-use 
doctrine, 
or 
sup-
porting local economies and encour-
aging 
economic 
development, 
pro-
moting 
critical 
infrastructure 
like 
roads and bridges and dams, ensuring a 
strong agricultural industry that feeds 
the world, and empowering the commu-
nities that we represent to embrace ex-
panded domestic energy production and 
clean energy technologies. 
Our State, local, and private land 
managers are conservation partners. 
Small businesses and local commu-
nities are eager to take the reins and 
make the improvements that we need, 
but they are consistently held back by 
bureaucratic red tape, delayed permit-
ting processes that add years and mil-
lions of dollars in cost to projects, and 
outdated laws that don’t take into ac-
count the best available science of 
modern technologies. 
Over and over again, I hear from my 
constituents in central Washington 
State, and also from community lead-
ers from across the United States, that 
we need to get the Federal Government 
out of the way. 
That is why, throughout this month 
of March, Congressional Western Cau-
cus members are taking the oppor-
tunity to highlight why reforming our 
duplicative and burdensome permitting 
process is the key to unlocking rural 
America’s potential. 
Madam Speaker, broken permitting 
systems negatively impact the progress 
that we could be making at nearly 
every step of the way. The National 
Environmental Policy Act, or what 
many refer to as NEPA, is one of the 
most egregious examples of a well-in-
tentioned law turned into a bureau-
cratic nightmare for those of us who 
are working to improve the commu-
nities where we live, work, and farm. 
The Endangered Species Act is an-
other. This landmark species protec-
tion law has become outdated, and it is 
now used as a weapon by serial litiga-
tors and misguided environmentalists, 
who want nothing more than to sue 
and settle, wasting our limited govern-
ment resources, which are stalling 
projects across the United States and 
disincentivizing investment in rural 
America. 
Both of these laws play an important 
role in protecting lands, waters, and 
wildlife that we cherish throughout the 
West and across rural America. But be-
cause Congress has not been able to 
meaningfully reform them, they have 
actually begun to work against us. 
ESA regulations can add decades to 
the permitting processes for forest 
management projects or projects that 
would 
help 
prevent 
catastrophic 
wildfires across the West. 
In my own home State of Wash-
ington, and across the Pacific North-
west, the policies surrounding the 
northern spotted owl wreaked havoc on 
our forest industry, destroying—lit-
erally 
destroying—local 
economies. 
Now, our region experiences some of 
the worst wildfires in our Nation’s his-
tory. 
Madam Speaker, that is not a coinci-
dence. Delays and roadblocks, and I in-
tend to insert a pun there, Madam 
Speaker, that are caused by NEPA reg-
ulations have slowed or completely 
stopped infrastructure projects like 
highway improvements or installation 
of new hydropower technologies that 
generate clean energy and provide in-
creased fish passage. 
Just last week, our members met 
with former Secretary of the Interior 
David Bernhardt, who worked within 
the Trump administration to stream-
line inefficiencies and cut the environ-
mental review process from 4.5 years, if 
you can believe that, down to no more 
than 2. 
The Biden administration, of course, 
is now reversing this progress and 
bending to politically motivated inter-
est groups at the expense of rural com-
munities. 
It is clear to us in the Western Cau-
cus that it is time for Congress to act. 
For decades, rural America has been 
kept in regulatory limbo at the mercy 
of each changing administration. 
Congress is a coequal branch of gov-
ernment, and we need to, we should, as-
sert our authority to ensure that our 
communities have the certainty that 
they need to move forward on these 
critical projects. 
Our rural communities deserve the 
investment and the development that 
is disincentivized by our broken per-
mitting processes. 
I know we have Western Caucus 
members here today who will help shed 
some light on some of these examples 
in their home districts, in their States. 
We will continue to demonstrate the 
harmful impacts of the status quo and 
outline our vision for a future that em-
powers rural Americans to tackle our 
challenges head-on. 
I am very happy to have a group of 
colleagues here who are very interested 
in this topic, and I will first turn to 
Mr. BRUCE WESTERMAN, who is the vice 
chair of the Western Caucus, one of my 
vice chairs, but also the ranking mem-
ber of the House Natural Resources 
Committee. 
I yield to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. WESTERMAN). 
b 1945 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding and 
also for his leadership in the Western 
Caucus and on these important issues 
that mean a lot to places like the 
Fourth District of Arkansas, to all 
over rural America, where out-of-touch 
policies in D.C. have a negative impact 
on people’s daily lives, and just being 
able to earn a living, to pay their 
taxes, and to provide the goods and 
services that the rest of the world 
needs. So I appreciate you hosting this 
Special Order. 
For years, it has been clear to rural 
America that our Federal permitting 
and environmental review processes 
are broken. While well-intentioned, 
they are doing more harm than good. 
The current system is complex, burden-
some, and ineffective, yet the political

March 15, 2022 
elite in Washington, D.C., wonder why 
our farmers, ranchers, and energy pro-
ducers struggle. 
Far-left special interest groups have 
weaponized, as Mr. NEWHOUSE
said, 
well-intentioned laws like the National 
Environmental Policy Act and the En-
dangered Species Act, and they use 
them as clubs to bludgeon or kill crit-
ical infrastructure, natural resource 
management, and energy and minerals 
development projects across the United 
States. 
Delays in environmental regulatory 
systems are especially acute. In 2020, 
the Council on Environmental Quality 
showed that the average time for a 
Federal agency to complete a final en-
vironmental impact statement through 
the 
NEPA 
process—again, 
Mr. 
NEWHOUSE quoted this number—is 41⁄2 
years. But that is the average number. 
One-quarter of all projects took over 6 
years to complete. That is more than 
red tape. That is a roadblock. That is 
why Republicans support the BUILDER 
Act to streamline the NEPA process 
and benefit communities looking to 
improve infrastructure investment. 
My district, like many others in the 
Western Caucus, is built on the agri-
culture industry, and I hear over and 
over from hardworking Arkansans who 
are simply trying to make a living 
through the sludge of government reg-
ulation. Overregulation and stalled 
regulation ensures that only the big-
gest businesses have the money and 
time to navigate the red tape and hire 
the lawyers that are needed to even at-
tempt to navigate the process. This is 
the kind of Big Government that puts 
local, small operators out of business. 
It stamps out small business operators 
and honest competition in one fell 
swoop. 
The message from rural America is 
clear: Government needs to get out of 
the way. More than that, government 
needs to be part of the solution and not 
part of the problem. I think govern-
ment has forgotten that it is the gov-
ernment of the people, by the people, 
and for the people, and that if you 
work for the government, you work for 
the people. It is not the other way 
around. 
There is no doubt that we should be 
good stewards of our environment and 
communities, but too often the free 
market, unburdened by government, is 
seen as the enemy of both. This is sim-
ply false. Streamlining a permitting 
process shouldn’t be partisan, political, 
or picking sides. It can be a win for the 
environment, the economy, and our 
communities simultaneously. We do 
not need to choose just one. In fact, a 
healthy environment and a strong 
economy go hand in hand. Somehow, 
we have gotten this idea that they are 
mutually exclusive, and we can’t have 
one without the other. 
Again, Republicans have the solu-
tions to cutting the red tape—it is 
called the BUILDER Act—and by so 
doing, we can empower rural America 
and strengthen our Nation’s economy 
at the same time. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. WESTERMAN
for his com-
ments. It just goes to show that it is 
not just Washington State, but clear 
across the Nation in Arkansas as well. 
To further prove that point, I would 
like to turn to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER), my good 
friend and colleague from the north-
eastern part of the State, a place where 
I have had the privilege to visit and see 
the great things that are happening in 
the energy sector there. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding to me 
and for organizing this Special Order 
and all the great work that he does 
leading the Western Caucus. 
We are really working on issues that 
impact not just rural America but all 
of America. And just to highlight a lit-
tle bit of what is happening in Pennsyl-
vania, 
currently 
in 
Pennsylvania, 
Pennsylvanians are paying on average 
$4.42 per gallon of gas. That is $1.39 
more than they were paying a year 
ago. 
The White House is frantically trying 
to spin a narrative that points to Rus-
sia’s invasion of Ukraine as the cata-
lyst for skyrocketing gas prices. 
The truth is that the Biden adminis-
tration set this energy crisis into mo-
tion on day one of his term in office by 
cutting American pipelines and halting 
leases for drilling on Federal lands. 
Blocking oil and natural gas drilling 
puts a stranglehold on domestic pro-
duction and leads to higher prices for 
American families. 
Not only has the Biden administra-
tion diminished American energy inde-
pendence, but it also gave Russia the 
confidence to weaponize its energy ex-
ports. Pair this with Biden’s refusal to 
unleash American energy dominance, 
and you have a United States, our 
United States that is dependent on ty-
rannical nations for energy. 
American energy is right beneath our 
feet. We must kick production into 
high gear. We heard the President 
stand here and talk about buy Amer-
ican, made American. Well, we can’t do 
that without American energy. We 
can’t build American infrastructure 
without American energy. 
To unleash that energy, the Biden 
administration needs to start listening 
to the people, needs to trust in the en-
ergy producers. We produce energy in 
the United States more cleanly than 
any other nation on the face of the 
Earth. We do it right, we do it environ-
mentally friendly, and we do not want 
to enrich people who want to do harm 
to us or our allies. That is what we 
need to do. 
We need expedited permits for LNG- 
exporting facilities. We need to get 
through the permitting process for 
drilling. We need to make sure we can 
drill on Federal lands. We need to 
make 
sure 
we 
complete 
pipelines. 
Those are the things that are halting 
American energy production, fueling 
inflation, and adding to the sky-
rocketing cost of energy for all Ameri-
cans. 
It is costing more to fill up our gas 
tanks. It is costing more to run our 
businesses and heat our homes. Simply, 
it is avoidable if the Biden administra-
tion would just reverse its policies and 
go back to where we were just 11⁄2 short 
years ago, and that was energy inde-
pendence. I look forward to working 
with Mr. NEWHOUSE on many things 
that can help make America stronger 
and put Americans first. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. KELLER for reminding us 
that these policies and decisions have 
impacts not just domestically but 
truly impact our relationships and our 
position of strength throughout the 
world, and especially in the situation 
we find ourselves in today. 
Next, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Mrs. RODGERS), a 
good friend and colleague, the ranking 
member on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, someone I have served 
with for a long time, not only in the 
statehouse in Washington State but 
here in the people’s House in Wash-
ington, D.C. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman, 
my 
good 
friend, 
DAN 
NEWHOUSE, chairman of the Western 
Caucus, for his great leadership for 
bringing us together tonight. 
This is a pivotal moment in our Na-
tion’s history. We are witnessing the 
real dangers of undermining our inde-
pendence because of a rush-to-green 
agenda and what it means for our na-
tional security, our geopolitical power, 
and our standard of living here in the 
United States of America. 
Energy is foundational to everything 
that we do. Actions to shut down 
American energy disarms us, and it 
disarms our security. By boosting our 
domestic production of oil and natural 
gas, we could be helping our allies in 
Europe, standing with Ukraine, and 
countering Putin’s war. 
Shutting 
down 
American 
energy 
drives people into poverty. Energy 
prices here at home are surging. Gas 
prices are the most expensive in the 
United States’ history, breaking the 
record that was set by the Obama ad-
ministration in 2008. Filling up the gas 
tank now will cost a typical family an 
additional $2,000 this year. This is not 
‘‘Putin’s price hike.’’ 
How did this happen? How did Amer-
ica get into this energy crisis? These 
are the facts: 
Under President Biden, domestic oil 
production declined by more than 1.5 
million barrels per day, while Russian 
imports to the United States reached 
an 11-year high. 
President Biden canceled the Key-
stone XL pipeline and imposed a mora-
torium on energy development on Fed-
eral lands. 
The administration is currently sit-
ting on more than 4,500 permits to 
drill. 
Regulatory uncertainty surrounding 
pipeline approvals have already led to 
the cancelation of at least four major

March 15, 2022 
pipeline 
projects 
that 
could 
have 
served over 25 million homes. 
The cancelations of these four pipe-
lines restricted nearly 10 percent of our 
natural gas production. And other pipe-
lines are under threat of closure, like 
Line 5, which is critical to those who 
live in Michigan and Ohio. 
But what is the administration’s so-
lution to this self-made crisis? What 
they really want to do is ban all oil and 
force a faster transition to their rad-
ical agenda. The President is doubling 
down on the rush to wind, solar, and 
electric vehicles—he stated so in the 
State of the Union—while at the same 
time saying that he wants to make 
things in America. 
In order to make things in America, 
we must cut the red tape for domestic 
mining, the processing of minerals that 
right now is nearly impossible in our 
Nation. China is controlling 80 percent 
of the critical minerals and materials 
needed to manufacture renewables and 
batteries. We can’t trade American en-
ergy security, reliability, and afford-
ability by rushing to green tech-
nologies that make us reliant on the 
Chinese Communist Party. 
America is the number one energy 
producer in the world, and we should 
act like it, yet the actions we are tak-
ing right now are not helping. We could 
boost our domestic energy production. 
It is vital to our way of life, our secu-
rity in bringing down energy prices. 
This Congress should move the legis-
lation that I introduced with my friend 
BRUCE WESTERMAN, who is the ranking 
Republican on the Natural Resources 
Committee. It is called the American 
Energy Independence from Russia Act. 
It would immediately remove restric-
tions on U.S. LNG exports so that we 
could deliver natural gas to our allies 
in Europe rather than them continuing 
to be dependent on Russia. They get 40 
percent of their natural gas from Rus-
sia. 
It would restart the oil and gas leas-
ing on Federal lands and offshore so 
that we could regain our energy domi-
nance, our energy independence. 
It would protect American energy 
and mineral development from unilat-
eral shutdowns by the Biden adminis-
tration just revoking permits. 
And because we need more pipelines, 
pipelines that are the safest way to 
move product, we would approve the 
Keystone XL pipeline. 
Second, 
the 
administration 
must 
stop delaying the permits and put 
Americans to work on energy infra-
structure in America. Right now, it 
takes on average 6 or 7 years to review 
a project. 
Third, we need to embrace innova-
tion for abundant, affordable, and clean 
energy for us and the rest of the world. 
It means reducing the permitting and 
regulatory burdens around nuclear. We 
should be leading in advanced nuclear 
technology, for us here in the United 
States and around the world, but right 
now the permitting is so costly and 
time consuming, it is delaying our 
progress. 
With an all-of-the-above strategy, we 
can say ‘‘yes’’ to America’s global lead-
ership and lower energy prices. I con-
tinue to urge my colleagues across the 
aisle to work together on this. Let’s 
flip the switch on American energy to 
ensure a better life and a more secure 
future for all. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman very much for 
helping to bring home the impact this 
is going to have on Americans, on fam-
ilies, on people just trying to get to 
work every day and having to fill up 
their gas tanks. These policies have 
consequences, and we need to under-
stand that. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. For 
sure. We need energy to do everything. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. We do absolutely. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. We 
need to be leading. It is American lead-
ership; it is American competitiveness; 
it is our security. Let’s do it. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Iowa 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS), one of our great 
Members who has truly been a cham-
pion in helping to reduce red tape and 
improve the regulatory picture for peo-
ple throughout this country. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Washington for yielding to me to speak 
on this important topic. 
Most Americans can agree that the 
Federal Government is very good at 
creating regulations and making what 
should often be a simple process ex-
tremely complicated. In recent years, 
Federal permitting regulations have 
been some of the most overbearing and 
burdensome of regulations. 
Landmark environmental protection 
laws, like the National Environmental 
Protection Act and the Endangered 
Species Act have become outdated and 
grown far too expansive. It is now near-
ly impossible to secure permits in a 
timely, efficient, and reasonable man-
ner. From energy and mining projects 
to infrastructure development and for-
est management, burdensome and du-
plicative permitting processes have 
slowed or halted development through-
out rural America. 
Iowans are all too familiar with the 
overregulated government permitting 
process. One such example is the cum-
bersome and unworkable 2015 waters of 
the United States rule, also known as 
WOTUS. 
b 2000 
Under the 2015 definition, the Federal 
government was given the authority to 
regulate almost any waters, including 
streams, ditches, ponds, and creeks. 
In fact, the Federal Government 
would have the authority to regulate 
water on 97 percent of the land in Iowa. 
Let me repeat that: 97 percent of the 
land in Iowa. This left farmers, ranch-
ers, landowners, and businesses to face 
confusion and burdensome restrictions 
on how to use their own property. 
WOTUS drastically expanded the juris-
diction over bodies of water like 
streams and ponds that the Clean 
Water Act never intended to regulate. 
Instead of burdening private citizens 
with confusing and ambiguous stand-
ards that could end up costing them 
thousands of dollars, we should work to 
ensure that the Federal Government’s 
clean water efforts are focused on 
clearly defined bodies of water. 
WOTUS 
hurt 
American 
farmers, 
ranchers, landowners, and businesses, 
it caused confusion, and it hindered 
economic development. 
To help rural America, the Trump 
administration issued the 2020 Navi-
gable Waters Protection Rule, also 
known as NWPR. The NWPR is much 
more workable and keeps our water 
and land clean without destroying 
businesses in the process. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administra-
tion is taking steps to revoke the 2020 
NWPR and return to the 2015 WOTUS 
rule. Reverting back to terrible poli-
cies such as the WOTUS rule would 
have an extreme Federal overreach and 
would significantly harm small busi-
nesses and cripple our country’s eco-
nomic recovery. 
The Trump administration also took 
steps to streamline processes under the 
National 
Environmental 
Protection 
Act to improve the ability for individ-
uals and businesses to build, improve, 
and maintain infrastructure by facili-
tating more efficient, effective, and 
timely NEPA reviews by Federal agen-
cies. 
With our economy on the mend, the 
Biden administration should not be 
considering unnecessary and overly 
burdensome government regulations. 
Reverting back to these policies rep-
resents 
a 
blatant, 
unconstitutional 
power grab aimed at taking Federal 
control over States in a way that 
threatens the rights of farmers, ranch-
ers, and all other landowners in Iowa 
and across our great Nation. We need 
to let people do their jobs and cut back 
on the incredible number of Federal 
regulations in the permitting process. 
We can protect our Nation’s water-
ways and make improvements to infra-
structure without burdensome regula-
tions. In Iowa and in rural commu-
nities throughout the country, we rec-
ognize that farmers and ranchers are 
the original conservationists, and that 
bureaucratic red tape does not help us 
grow, prosper, protect our water and 
our land. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentlewoman’s work on 
WOTUS and the navigable waters issue. 
I think I have heard her say something 
like those things, WOTUS, is truly the 
most—the worst regulatory overreach 
in our Nation’s history and it is some-
thing we have to stop. I thank the gen-
tlewoman for her work on that. 
I would like to go just a little bit 
south from the State of Washington to 
another State that adjoins my State, 
and the good gentleman from Oregon, 
in his first term in Congress, but just 
doing an excellent job; and I am just 
delighted to have him as part of this ef-
fort.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3739 
March 15, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. BENTZ). 
Mr. BENTZ. Madam Speaker, out-
dated 
and 
complicated 
permitting 
processes, excess paperwork, environ-
mental impact statements, and years- 
long litigation processes have delayed 
or prevented projects all across Oregon, 
especially in my district, which covers 
more than two-thirds of the State. 
Federal 
permitting 
involves 
too 
many agencies and too many bureau-
crats. As far as Federal agencies are 
concerned, there are no consequences 
for time lost or money spent. Nowhere 
is this problem more pronounced than 
in forest management. 
For decades, Congress has stacked 
process upon process, creating more 
and more red tape for agencies to deal 
with. Of course we want to know what 
the impact of a project will be. How-
ever, when the processes of deter-
mining that impact stall action for up 
to 20 years, the system is obviously 
broken. 
With over 70 million acres of our na-
tional forest at high or moderate risk 
of wildfire, there is an urgent need to 
reduce the amount of unneeded and 
dangerous fuel. We have seen the tragic 
results of inaction as millions of acres 
of our beautiful forests burn each year, 
including over 10 million acres in 2020 
alone and over 7 million acres in 2021. 
In my home State of Oregon, over a 
million acres burned last year in the 
Labor Day fires. Last summer, smoke 
from the massive Oregon Bootleg Fire 
spread across the entire United States, 
visibly fouling the air and poisoning 
people even here in Washington, D.C. 
The Biden administration issued a 10- 
year plan acknowledging the wildfire 
and forest health crisis and calling for 
treatment of an additional 20 million 
acres of the National Forest System, a 
fraction of what is actually necessary. 
Congress recently provided the Forest 
Service with over $6 billion in the bi-
partisan Infrastructure and Jobs Act to 
increase hazardous fuels reduction and 
forest restoration activities. The agen-
cy, however, remains buried in red 
tape, endless analysis, and frivolous 
litigation. 
A 2014 GAO report found that the 
United States Forest Service did more 
of the most costly and time-consuming 
NEPA reviews than any other Federal 
agency. These National Environmental 
Policy Act reviews often require the 
Forest Service to spend over $1 million 
to complete paperwork, and then they 
take an average of almost 5 years to 
merely authorize small and incon-
sequential forest thinning projects in-
tended to reduce the risk of cata-
strophic wildfire to our forests and 
communities. 
While precious time is wasted, mas-
sive wildfires rage on, dumping billions 
of tons of toxic, cancer-causing pollu-
tion into our air. This is an environ-
mental disaster rapidly becoming a 
nightmare. 
Congress must take action to give 
the Forest Service additional tools to 
reduce the time, cost, and litigation 
that delay the agency from authorizing 
and 
implementing 
these 
critical 
projects. I am proud to be a cosponsor 
of the Resilient Federal Forests Act, 
which would do just that. 
Earlier this year, I expressed my con-
cern on this very floor about the so- 
called River Democracy Act currently 
pending in the Senate. It would place 
new management restrictions on some 
3 million acres of Federal land in Or-
egon by establishing a 1-mile wild and 
scenic buffer along some 4,700 miles of 
creeks and, in some areas, dry gulches. 
The Forest Service recently reported 
that over half of the 2 million Forest 
Service acres of land impacted by this 
act is at high risk for wildfire. Treat-
ing these acres only becomes more dif-
ficult, if not impossible, with these 
types of designations. 
It is time to overhaul our Nation’s 
permitting and NEPA process. Current 
laws and agency rules hand far too 
much power to litigation groups that 
use sue and settle tactics to profit off 
our tax dollars by delaying and, in 
some cases, preventing important res-
toration projects. 
We need serious, thoughtful reform 
to put an end to this abuse. I am glad 
my colleagues share my determination 
to make that happen, and hopefully it 
will be a bipartisan process. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for focusing on a 
very important issue for us in the 
West. Every summer we hear the West 
is burning. We have got to change our 
policies in order to prevent the loss of 
property, loss of life, the detriment to 
our environment. 
I would like to turn the floor over 
now to someone who is—you know, we 
are the Western Caucus, right? But we 
have members from all over the coun-
try. And one of our members represents 
almost the furthest east in our caucus. 
The good gentleman from the great 
State of Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the great State of Georgia 
and the beautiful community of Savan-
nah (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, President Biden 
wants to build back better. What he 
doesn’t realize is that first, we must be 
able to build. Many otherwise shovel- 
ready 
infrastructure 
projects 
get 
trapped in bureaucratic gridlock for 
years. 
Developers routinely find themselves 
navigating environmental reviews that 
require up to over 60 authorizations 
from as many as 13 different Federal 
agencies. 
Projects starting today with new 
funding from the infrastructure deal 
won’t be realized for 5 to 7 years, if not 
longer. After years of project design, 
engineering, planning, and financing, 
the 2 to 4-year permitting process com-
mences. This pushes orders for new 
windmills, solar panels, transmission 
lines, charging stations, construction 
equipment, steel, concrete, labor con-
tracts, and whatever else a project may 
need years into the future. Only after 
all of that can the 2 to 3 years of con-
struction begin. 
The Federal Permitting Improve-
ment Steering Council analyzed 69 
major projects and found that bureau-
cratic delays cost developers $100 bil-
lion. 
New wind and solar projects take 2.3 
years, on average, to receive Federal 
permits; 3.3 years for electricity trans-
mission projects, and 4.7 years for 
major new road projects. 
This contrast with the ambitious and 
radical climate goals Democrats have 
set, calling for a 50 percent reduction 
in emissions by 2030. In that case, a 7 to 
10-year development timeline is en-
tirely too long or realistic. 
Permitting challenges have resulted 
in extended delays and creating a 
chilling effect on new infrastructure 
investment. This isn’t just a sacrifice 
of time. Perhaps worse, it costs money, 
a lot of money. 
Twenty to 30 percent of total project 
funding is wasted on unnecessary red 
tape. We are wasting millions of dollars 
a year by just waiting. Instead of fixing 
that 
well-known 
issue, 
Democrats 
chose to throw more money at the 
problem. Now we see how this has 
brought on record inflation. 
Sadly, the cost of these unnecessary 
delays is ultimately passed down to 
taxpayers, either through taxes, tolls, 
or increased rates in usage fees. It is no 
wonder that the U.S.’ infrastructure is 
falling behind other developed nations. 
What is curious is, why did Biden’s 
so-called infrastructure bill do nothing 
to speed up the process, and, instead, 
doubled down on delays and bureauc-
racy? 
Republicans and Democrats alike are 
struggling to build around these road-
blocks, and it is high time Congress did 
something about it. 
I thank the gentleman again for 
yielding. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for helping illus-
trate the impact that this has on local 
communities, the costs, not only in 
dollars, of the long permitting process, 
but the delay to communities for these 
much-needed projects. 
Now, this could probably come under 
saving the best for last. The great Rep-
resentative from the great State of 
California, I would like to say is was 
one of the premier members of the new 
freshman 
class. 
I 
appreciate 
Mr. 
VALADAO, a fellow farmer, a fellow 
West Coaster, being here being part of 
this Special Order to talk about some 
very important issues here. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. VALADAO). 
Mr. VALADAO. I appreciate the op-
portunity. Mr. NEWHOUSE has done an 
amazing job leading the Western Cau-
cus and fighting for the things that af-
fect some of us across the country.

leagues from all the way on the East

Coast talk about some of the issues. It 
always amazes me that our issues are 
so aligned. 
But specifically today I am going to 
talk a little bit about water. So in 
communities like the Central Valley, 
Federal permitting requirements, cou-
pled with the State’s strict environ-
mental regulations make it harder for 
our communities to get the water they 
so desperately need. 
Increasing water storage capacity is 
critical to ensuring a reliable water 
supply for our valley farmers that feed 
the country. Unfortunately, our broken 
permitting process prevents many of 
these 
critical 
water 
infrastructure 
projects from ever getting off the 
ground. 
We need to fix complex and con-
tradictory laws, court decisions, and 
regulations at the State and Federal 
levels that hinder our water storage in-
frastructure. 
Layers of unnecessary bureaucracy 
and red tape in permitting decisions 
have blocked much of the needed 
progress on a long list of projects, from 
water storage, to energy production, to 
highways. 
The government red tape in permit-
ting is not only affecting water stor-
age, it is also having a devastating ef-
fect on our Nation’s energy supply. 
There is a backlog of over 4,600 per-
mits to drill pending under the Biden 
administration, and even though Fed-
eral law requires approval of the per-
mits on Federal lands within 30 days, 
permits often languish at the Depart-
ment of the Interior for a year or more. 
This government red tape is hurting 
families in the Central Valley and 
across the country in the form of high-
er gas prices. It is time for the govern-
ment bureaucracy to get out of the 
way so we can once again become en-
ergy independent. 
There is no reason that streamlining 
the Federal permitting process should 
be a controversial issue. Rural commu-
nities like the one I represent are tired 
of burdensome government regulations 
holding them back. Greater efficiency 
in the Federal permitting process is 
critical for getting water to those in 
the Central Valley that need it most. 
And as we saw, from other colleagues 
that spoke before us, this isn’t just a 
California issue. And I know that the 
chairman here, Mr. NEWHOUSE and I, 
our districts are a lot alike. We both 
grow a lot of different commodities, 
and we are proud of our districts. But 
we both need something that makes it 
all possible, and that is water and en-
ergy. 
I thank the gentleman for his leader-
ship on these important issues and 
thank him for giving me the oppor-
tunity. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
the gentleman is right. What is more 
precious than water? And those of us in 
the West understand that very well. 
So, Madam Speaker, let me just say 
I am very grateful to have colleagues 
from across this great country join me 
tonight to talk about these issues, and 
to discuss our efforts in the Western 
Caucus as it relates to permitting 
month. 
b 2015 
As you have heard, the broken proc-
esses surrounding permitting through-
out the Federal Government have truly 
kneecapped our rural communities. 
This has slowed progress and has cost 
millions and millions of dollars. 
In order to truly unleash American 
potential, we have to reform this proc-
ess, and we will. Between the Western 
Caucus and those of us in Congress, we 
will continue to advocate for common-
sense policies that are going to do just 
that. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful for 
the Special Order opportunity this 
evening, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, the center of our 
hope, as the Russian war against 
Ukraine reaches its 20th day, we keep 
our eyes on You. We thank You for 
Your might, majesty, and power. You 
are the source of our strength, and the 
hope for all our tomorrows. 
As our lawmakers strive to do their 
best for freedom, make them worthy of 
their high calling. May the lure of ex-
pediency never tempt them to betray 
the highest principles. 
Lord, use our Senators to build a bet-
ter and more peaceful Nation and 
world. May they maintain the fidelity 
of those to whom much has been given. 
We pray in Your sovereign Name. 
Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, so the 
Senate this week will continue ful-
filling its constitutional duty to con-
firm more of the President’s judicial 
and administrative nominees. Yester-
day, I filed cloture on 12 additional 
nominees, setting up a busy rest of the 
week here on the floor. Absent an 
agreement to expedite the process— 
and, unfortunately, we have seen all 
too few of those coming from our Re-
publican colleagues—Members can ex-
pect to begin voting tomorrow morn-
ing, and we will work through all 12 
nominees until we have a path to get-
ting them confirmed. 
Due to the months of obstructive 
holds by a few—just a handful of Re-
publicans—in 
addition 
to 
judicial 
nominees, we also must use up floor 
time to confirm U.S. attorneys, some-
thing practically unheard of in the 
Senate. These Republicans who have 
delayed our U.S. attorneys are actively 
making our communities less safe, and 
it is regrettable they have chosen to 
obstruct the Senate for their own per-
sonal political interests. So my col-
leagues ought to be prepared for a busy 
few days here on the floor. 
Now, among the nominees we will 
consider are two great nominees from 
New York, I am proud to say. One, we 
will consider Judge Ali Nathan, nomi-
nated to serve as judge for the Second 
Circuit. She is a brilliant jurist with a 
decade of experience as a district 
judge, and I was proud to recommend 
her to sit on one of the most important 
courts in the Nation. 
I am also pleased that the Senate 
will also vote on Hector Gonzalez to 
serve as district judge for the Eastern 
District of New York. Born in Cuba, 
raised in Queens, and a Fulbright 
scholar who became one of New York’s 
top attorneys, Mr. Gonzalez is the very 
embodiment of the American dream; 
and, like Judge Nathan, I am glad to 
have recommended him to President 
Biden. 
I am also glad to note, under Senator 
DURBIN’s leadership, Judge Nathan and 
Mr. Gonzalez received bipartisan sup-
port in committee, so I look forward to 
the Senate confirming them in short 
order. 
But first, the Senate will look to 
make history, once again, later today 
by confirming Shalanda Young to serve 
as President Biden’s Director of the Of-
fice of Management and Budget, a Cab-
inet-level position. She would be the 
first Black woman ever confirmed by 
the Senate to lead the OMB.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1158 
March 15, 2022 
It shouldn’t have taken this long to 
confirm someone as obviously qualified 
as Shalanda Young. She has been lead-
ing the OMB for nearly a year. She 
knows the budget and appropriations 
processes like the back of her hand. 
She has proven capable of working 
with Republicans and Democrats alike, 
and it was through her guidance that 
the administration notched some of its 
biggest victories, including the passage 
of the bipartisan infrastructure law. 
Shalanda Young is one of the most 
effective Cabinet leaders to have the 
label of ‘‘Acting’’ in a very long time, 
but it is long past time for that word to 
drop from her job title. I look forward 
to the Senate officially confirming Ms. 
Young as OMB Director later today. 
CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT 
Mr. President, now on the omni, later 
this afternoon, I will join with a num-
ber of my Senate colleagues in attend-
ing a signing ceremony at the White 
House for the 2022 omnibus funding 
bill, one of many significant and bipar-
tisan accomplishments of the Senate in 
recent weeks. 
In a 50–50 Senate, it is no small feat 
for this Chamber to pass the boldest 
and most significant funding package 
that Congress has seen in a long, long 
time. Under this new package, stu-
dents, parents, working families, small 
businesses, and veterans will see costs 
go down and greater investments go 
their way. Our troops are going to get 
a much needed raise. Student loan bor-
rowers will see their maximum Pell 
grant awards increase by the largest 
amount in over a decade, impacting 7 
million students, not to mention their 
families. 
We are giving parents more help for 
affording childcare and seniors more 
help to receive care at home. 
For the first time in years, the Vio-
lence Against Women Act, one of the 
most important pieces of legislation in 
the last 30 years, will finally be re-
newed, offering lifesaving resources for 
survivors of domestic violence and sex-
ual assault. 
And, of course, we are keeping our 
promise to Ukraine by providing nearly 
$14 billion in humanitarian and mili-
tary aid. This means food and shelter 
for the millions trapped in war, relief 
for the now-3 million refugees fleeing 
the country, and funding to transfer 
Javelins, Stingers, and other anti-tank 
and 
anti-aircraft 
weapons 
to 
the 
Ukrainian fighting forces. 
The Ukrainian people are not alone 
in their struggle against Vladimir 
Putin’s savage war. I commend my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle who 
accelerated the passage of this emer-
gency funding, and I again commend 
President Biden for his handling of the 
crisis to date. As I said weeks ago, the 
President deserves immense credit for 
keeping the allies together against 
Putin, imposing crippling sanctions on 
Russia, and responding to a turbulent 
conflict with clarity and with strength. 
Some were pushing the President to 
do too much too soon, risking an esca-
lation of the crisis and risking that our 
allies would not join us, but so far, the 
President’s approach has been right on 
target. Thanks to the President’s ap-
proach, Putin is now one of the most 
reviled and isolated leaders that the 
world has seen in a very long time. 
For this reason alone, signing the 
omnibus into law is a major accom-
plishment, and I thank the President, 
Senators LEAHY and DURBIN, and all 
our appropriators and Members on both 
sides of the aisle for getting it done. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. President, now on SCOTUS, what 
do retired conservative judges, a group 
of 80 current and retired State attor-
neys general, the U.S. Black Chambers, 
and the International Association of 
Chiefs of Police all share in common? 
You might ask yourself that question. 
Well, they are just a few—just a few— 
of the many, many groups and individ-
uals who have endorsed Judge Ketanji 
Brown Jackson for the Supreme Court. 
When I met with Judge Jackson a 
few weeks ago, it was immediately 
clear why so many different groups 
have sung her praises. On top of her 
brilliance, on top of her experience, she 
is unusually gifted at seeing and appre-
ciating both sides of an argument. It is 
little surprise, then, that in the course 
of rendering nearly 550 decisions as a 
Federal district judge, she was rarely 
reversed by higher courts. In fact, she 
has been reversed perhaps around a 
dozen times out of 550 decisions. That 
is about 2 percent—2 percent—of the 
time. 
This week, Members from both sides 
of the aisle will continue meeting with 
the judge. I believe, under Senator 
DURBIN’s leadership, every member of 
the Judiciary Committee has had the 
chance to meet with her. I am con-
fident that any new conclusions my 
colleagues make about her will keep 
pointing in one direction: Judge Jack-
son is brilliant. She is beloved. She be-
longs on the Supreme Court. It is 
worth repeating the three b’s over and 
over 
again—brilliant, 
beloved, 
be-
longs—because those three words are 
undoubtedly true as applied to Judge 
Jackson. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
American strength is not a provo-
cation. American strength secures de-
terrence and peace. It is American hes-
itancy and weakness which our adver-
saries see as an invitation. It is a sim-
ple fact. We relearned it the hard way 
many times in our history. It should 
form the cornerstone of any adminis-
tration’s foreign policy, but every day 
brings new distressing signs that the 
Biden administration forgets this les-
son. 
President Biden hesitated and waited 
to reinforce our NATO allies with more 
American troops out of fear that it 
might provoke Putin. President Biden 
hesitated and waited to send Stingers 
to the Ukrainians out of fears that it 
might provoke Putin. President Biden 
declined to send support and training 
to Ukraine in December because he 
feared it might provoke Putin. 
Here is a headline from earlier this 
week: 
Pentagon push to send more trainers to 
Ukraine was scrapped in December amid 
White House fears of provoking Russia. 
Last week, President Biden publicly 
split from our ally Poland and scrapped 
a plan to get airplanes to Ukraine be-
cause our administration feared it 
might—you guessed it—provoke Putin. 
Predictably, Putin has not pulled his 
punches as a thank-you to President 
Biden for pulling his punches. 
American strength is not the provo-
cation; American weakness is. We need 
to help get air defense systems to 
Ukraine without wasting another sec-
ond. 
But, meanwhile, the Biden adminis-
tration is already replaying this mis-
taken philosophy with another adver-
sary. Iran watched our humiliating, 
botched retreat in Afghanistan. They 
have watched the Biden administration 
squabble with our Middle Eastern part-
ners while removing sanctions from 
Iran’s own terrorist proxies in Yemen. 
The Iranians have taken the measure 
of this administration. This weekend, 
even as the Biden administration is re-
portedly putting the finishing touches 
on an agreement deal that would mas-
sively favor Iran over America, they 
unleashed an audacious—audacious— 
missile strike into the Kurdistan re-
gion of Iraq that came very close to 
hitting our U.S. consulate. 
How will our Commander in Chief re-
spond? The record is not encouraging. 
Deterrence of Iran has steadily eroded 
under his tenure. The worse the Ira-
nians behave, the more desperate the 
Biden administration seems to be to 
give them concessions. 
Judging by public reports, the deal 
that 
President 
Biden 
is 
preparing 
would impose fewer, weaker, and short-
er restrictions on Iran than even the 
deeply flawed 2015 deal, while giving 
them major and lasting relief from 
sanctions. 
The deal would reportedly not even 
touch Iran’s ballistic missile program. 
So Iran lobs missiles toward our facili-
ties, and we give Iran a huge influx of 
cash and a relaxation of pressure. 
Iran clearly does not fear that they 
will pay a price for threatening Amer-
ican interests. They must be made to 
think again. 
Yesterday, Senate Republicans sent 
the administration a letter expressing 
our grave concerns that they are pre-
paring once again to give away the 
store. Republicans stand ready to work 
together on a real, tough agreement 
that blocks Iran’s path to nuclear 
weapons, constrains its missile pro-
grams, and confronts its support for 
terrorism. But if the administration

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1159 
March 15, 2022 
continues down the path they are on, 
they will find the stiff opposition that 
that path deserves. 
NOMINATION OF SARAH BLOOM RASKIN 
Now, on another matter, there is bi-
partisan Senate opposition to Sarah 
Bloom Raskin, President Biden’s rad-
ical and unacceptable nominee for the 
powerful Federal Reserve Board posi-
tion of Vice Chair for Supervision. 
Runaway 
inflation 
is 
hammering 
American families. Democrats’ reck-
less policies have backed the Fed into a 
very tricky corner. Just this morning, 
the new ‘‘Producer Price Index Report’’ 
showed wholesale inflation is up 10 per-
cent—10 percent—over 12 months, tied 
for the worst year ever. 
At a time like this, the Fed’s inde-
pendence is paramount. But President 
Biden’s nominee for this powerful seat 
has spent years campaigning to turn 
the Fed from a nonpartisan central 
bank into a far-left superlegislature 
that voters cannot get rid of. 
Explicitly and repeatedly, she has 
called for the Fed to go about picking 
winners and losers in accord with lib-
eral ideological goals completely unre-
lated to the Fed’s core duties. 
The far left cheered Ms. Raskin’s 
nomination for the same reason that 
Senators from both parties oppose it. 
She wants to take radical policy aims 
that liberals can’t achieve through 
Congress and hardwire them directly 
into our financial system instead. 
President Biden was literally asking 
for Senators to support a central bank-
er—a central banker—who wanted to 
usurp the Senate’s policymaking power 
for herself. 
Ms. Raskin would have been a Vice 
Chair who sought to raise gas prices, 
raise home heating costs, and under-
mine the very institution of the Fed-
eral Reserve in the process. 
It is not surprising that there is bi-
partisan Senate opposition to such a 
radical nominee. Even before one con-
siders the unanswered ethical ques-
tions to which the Banking Committee 
has not been able to get straight an-
swers, President Biden’s selection wild-
ly—wildly—missed the mark. It is past 
time the White House admit their mis-
take and send us somebody suitable. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Now, on one final matter, what can 
the Senate conclude about a Supreme 
Court nominee from the nature of their 
fan club? 
That is a question the Democratic 
leader answered very clearly a few 
years back. In 2005, Senator SCHUMER 
accused future Chief Justice John Rob-
erts of being ‘‘embraced by some of the 
most extreme ideologues in America.’’ 
Our colleague continues: 
That gives rise to a question many are ask-
ing: What do they know about you that we 
do not know? 
That was Senator SCHUMER
ques-
tioning the Chief Justice. Of course, 
there was nothing extreme about then- 
Judge Roberts, nor about mainstream 
scholarly groups like the Federalist 
Society. But given Democrats’ prin-
ciple that the Senate ought to examine 
nominees’ fan clubs, let’s take a look 
at the loudest cheerleaders for Presi-
dent Biden’s nominee, Judge Jackson. 
Before the 2020 election, one far-left 
dark money group put Judge Jackson 
on their Supreme Court short list— 
well, not at first. She was left off their 
first version, but, shortly thereafter, 
the judge published a fiery 118-page 
opinion in a politically charged case 
that won attention and praise from lib-
eral pundits. 
One cable TV host observed that 
Judge Jackson’s opinion was not stand-
ard legal writing, but was written with 
‘‘a broader audience in mind.’’ 
Not long after, Judge Jackson was 
added to the next version of the activ-
ists’ short list. Practically as soon as 
President Biden was sworn in, this 
group began spending big sums of 
money boosting Judge Jackson’s pro-
file. They put her face on posters 
around the Senate. They paid for bill-
boards pushing Justice Breyer to re-
tire. 
This is a far, far-left group. They agi-
tate for partisan Court packing. They 
drive around town trying to harass 
Justice Kavanaugh. They filed a frivo-
lous ethics complaint against former 
DC Circuit Judge Tom Griffith. Last 
week on television, one of their board 
members said our Constitution—listen 
to this—our Constitution ‘‘is kind of 
trash.’’ 
This group’s entire purpose and fund-
raising model is waging war on the le-
gitimacy of the judiciary itself, and for 
some reason, these people desperately 
wanted Judge Jackson in particular to 
end up on our highest Court. Why? 
Well, Senators will need to explore 
that. 
A representative from this radical 
outfit told the Washington Post that 
they like Judge Jackson for reasons 
that include her work ‘‘as a public de-
fender and on the U.S. Sentencing 
Commission.’’ 
We are in the middle of a violent 
crime wave, including soaring rates of 
homicides and carjackings. Even last 
summer, when the pandemic posed a 
bigger challenge, more Americans said 
violent crime was a bigger problem 
than said COVID was. 
Amid all this, the soft-on-crime bri-
gade is squarely in Judge Jackson’s 
corner. They wanted her above anyone 
else on the short list. And they specifi-
cally cite her experience defending 
criminals and her work on the Sen-
tencing Commission as key qualifica-
tions. 
As Leader SCHUMER once asked, what 
do these folks know that Senators may 
not? I hope the vigorous Senate process 
ahead, including all the necessary doc-
uments and records from Judge Jack-
son’s time on the Sentencing Commis-
sion, may begin to shed more light. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am 
glad I was on the floor to hear the Re-
publican leader’s comments about our 
Supreme 
Court 
nominee, 
Ketanji 
Brown Jackson, because there are a 
couple of elements that he obviously 
inadvertently missed that he should 
have reported when he was talking 
about the support that she has received 
from across the political spectrum. He 
made her out to be a product and cre-
ation of some far-left political cause or 
movement, but she is much more than 
that. 
He went on to say that Judge Thom-
as Griffith of the DC Circuit was har-
assed by the same special interest 
group that supports Judge Jackson. He 
missed one key element. I just received 
a letter within the last 2 weeks from 
Judge Thomas Griffith, a well-known, 
retired, conservative Federal judge, en-
dorsing Ketanji Brown Jackson. How 
about that? 
It doesn’t sound like a special inter-
est group to me. It sounds like a Re-
publican-appointed judge who saw her 
in action and wants to make sure that 
she gets a chance to serve on the Su-
preme Court of the United States. 
It makes a big difference because, if 
you take a look at what he had to say 
about her, Judge Griffith wrote: 
Judge Jackson has a demonstrated record 
of excellence, and I believe, based upon her 
work as a trial judge when I served on the 
Court of Appeals, [that] she will adjudicate 
based on the facts and the law and not as a 
partisan. 
That is exactly the opposite of the 
point that was being made by Senator 
MCCONNELL. She has the support across 
the political spectrum. He failed to 
mention that she has been endorsed by 
the Fraternal Order of Police. 
Oh, she is supposedly suspect of being 
too liberal. Well, I can just tell you 
that she is a person of quality, integ-
rity, and values, and she has the sup-
port across the political spectrum to 
prove it. 
I believe she is going to be an ex-
traordinary Justice on the Supreme 
Court, and President Biden made a 
good choice in selecting her. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. President, moving to a different 
topic, what does courage look like? 
What does the face of courage look 
like? Well, we see it every day on tele-
vision out of Ukraine. We see individ-
uals leaving their regular lives, grab-
bing a rifle to defend their nation, and 
being prepared to die in the process. 
That is the face of courage. 
We see the face of courage in the 
President of Ukraine, an extraordinary 
individual, who once was a rising 
standup comedian and now is a rising 
standup President for his nation of 
Ukraine, risking his life every day to 
stay in Kyiv and to be there to inspire 
his people to resist Putin’s barbaric in-
vasion of that country. 
We are going to see that tomorrow in 
the joint session of Congress. It is the 
first Zoom joint session of Congress 
that I have ever been in attendance, 
and I am glad we are doing it. For the 
last several weeks, I have been in touch

March 15, 2022 
through Zoom conference calls with 
President Zelenskyy. He is a coura-
geous man. 
But 
courage 
is 
not 
limited 
to 
Ukraine. An event occurred yesterday 
in Moscow which bears our approval 
and consideration. On state-run tele-
vision in Moscow, a woman was reading 
the propaganda that was on the show, 
when an employee of that same chan-
nel burst on to the set and interrupted 
the news broadcast. 
Her name is—and I am going to try 
to pronounce her Russian name here— 
Marina 
Ovsyannikova—Marina 
Ovsyannikova. That is her, standing 
there holding a sign saying ‘‘no war.’’ 
She was wearing a yellow and blue 
necklace, the colors of Ukraine. 
And this woman, an actual editor at 
Channel One in Moscow, shouted: 
Stop the war. No to war. 
Their sign says: 
Don’t believe the propaganda. They are 
lying to you here. 
It was signed in English: 
Russians against war. 
Now, this might have been something 
just viewed as a disruption, but in Rus-
sia under Putin, her actions constitute 
a crime. 
What has happened to her? Well, we 
don’t know. She disappeared shortly 
after this appearance on television. 
Under a new law, she could be sen-
tenced to up to 15 years in prison for 
using the word ‘‘war’’ to describe Rus-
sia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
But she was unbowed. Before her pro-
test, she recorded a video which has 
been released through human rights 
group. I want to read for you what she 
said in this video: 
Regrettably, for a number of years, I 
worked on Channel One and worked on 
Kremlin propaganda. I am very ashamed of 
this right now. 
She said: 
Ashamed that I was allowed to tell lies 
from the television screen. Ashamed that I 
allowed the zombification of the Russian 
people. We were silent in 2014 when this was 
just beginning. We did not go out to protest 
when the Kremlin poisoned [opposition lead-
er Alexei] Navalny.’’ 
She continued: 
We are just silently watching this anti- 
human regime and now the whole world has 
turned away from us. 
She told her countrymen and women: 
Only we have the power to stop all this 
madness. Go to the protests. Don’t be afraid 
of anything. They can’t imprison us all. 
I believe that if more ordinary Rus-
sians knew the truth about what Vladi-
mir Putin is doing in Ukraine, they 
would join her protest. 
Russian media aren’t reporting the 
truth: that Russia has lost more sol-
diers in the first 20 days of its invasion 
of Ukraine than America lost in two 
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And Rus-
sian media aren’t reporting on Russia’s 
war crimes in Ukraine, like the horrific 
shelling last week of a children’s and 
maternity hospital in Mariupol. 
Yesterday, we learned that the in-
jured woman on the stretcher in this 
photo had died, as had her baby. It was 
a type of outrage which the American 
people will never forget and shouldn’t. 
This was an intentional target, this 
maternity hospital, by Putin. He has 
bombed health clinics and hospitals 
across Ukraine. That is the type of per-
son he is. That is the type of war he 
wages. That is the type of war criminal 
he is. Every one of these attacks is a 
violation of international law. 
At least three facilities that serve 
women and children have been subject 
to attack, and innocent civilians have 
been killed. Throughout Ukraine, con-
tinued explosions and the threat of 
shelling have forced hospital staff to 
move critically ill children and other 
patients into bomb shelters in the 
basements. Children suffering from 
cancer, wartime injuries, and other se-
rious conditions have been forced to 
move to western Ukraine by bus and 
train. 
Throughout Ukraine, critical medi-
cations—insulin, 
cancer 
drugs, 
and 
other infusions—are in short supply, 
but the world is responding. We have 
seen an outpouring of revulsion against 
Putin and his war crimes. But we have 
also seen an outpouring of compassion, 
as governments and ordinary citizens 
step forward to aid Ukraine. 
Last Wednesday, a group of nine doc-
tors and nurses from the Chicago area 
flew to Poland to volunteer to help 
Ukrainians 
fleeing 
the 
war. 
They 
brought with them 167 suitcases filled 
with medicines and medical equipment. 
Advocate Christ Medical Center in 
Oak Lawn, IL, donated nearly $500,000 
in equipment—all paid for in donations 
raised in just 72 hours. 
The group included Ukrainian Ameri-
cans, Lithuanian Americans, Polish 
Americans, 
Syrian 
Americans, 
and 
Pakistani Americans. The trip was or-
ganized by a nonprofit group called 
MedGlobal. It was founded by a man 
who is my friend, and I am proud to say 
that, an amazing Syrian-American doc-
tor named Dr. Zaher Sahloul. 
Over the years, this organization has 
taken 
medical 
missions 
to 
Syria, 
Burma, and other places torn by the 
conflicts that do emerge in these areas. 
On this trip, the doctors and nurses 
spent 2 days in Lviv, providing medical 
care alongside Ukrainian doctors. They 
then returned to the Polish side of the 
border to provide aid to refugees in 
local hospitals. 
Let me say a word about the refugees 
who are currently inside Ukraine and 
leaving Ukraine. The estimate now is 
that a nation with a population of 40 
million, Ukraine, has more than 3 mil-
lion refugees. Let me put that in per-
spective for a moment. Three million 
refugees in a matter of 20 days of war— 
can you imagine? If it were the United 
States and a similar proportion of the 
population, it would mean moving the 
population of the State of Texas out of 
the United States in 3 weeks. That is 
what is happening because of the ter-
rible war and invasion of Vladimir 
Putin. 
Providing medical assistance doesn’t 
stop with what I have read into the 
RECORD. Chicago is also blessed with 
one of the finest pediatric hospitals in 
America, Lurie Children’s Hospital. 
Lurie Children’s has shipped 11⁄4 tons— 
11⁄4 tons—of medical supplies and med-
ical equipment to Ukraine. 
Staff at Lurie Children’s are now ex-
ploring with Federal officials how they 
might help bring some of Ukraine’s 
most critically ill children to the 
United States for needed medical treat-
ment. The hospital spokesman called 
me last week to say that she was initi-
ating an effort nationwide in the 
United States to ask every children’s 
hospital to pitch in. If there are kids in 
Ukraine or out of Ukraine now as refu-
gees who are in desperate need of med-
ical care, America is going to be there. 
I am so proud of Lurie Children’s and 
all the other children’s hospitals across 
the United States. They are exploring 
the same opportunity and challenge. I 
applaud America’s children’s hospitals 
for answering the call over the next 
several days to provide medical support 
for pediatric patients in critical need. I 
urge our Federal Agencies to assist in 
logistical challenges. Together, we can 
save these children’s lives. 
Tomorrow morning, a truly heroic 
leader, Ukrainian President Volodymyr 
Zelenskyy, will address a virtual joint 
session of Congress. He will ask Con-
gress and the American people to stand 
with Ukraine, to defend democracy and 
human dignity and to bring this hor-
rific war to an end. We must answer 
that call. This fight is not Ukraine’s 
alone; this is a fight for democracy and 
the right of people to choose their own 
leaders, decide their own destiny. 
I will close with these thoughts—one 
from 
Garry 
Kasparov, 
a 
chess 
grandmaster, Russian expatriate, and 
fierce critic of Vladimir Putin. 
Yesterday, Garry Kasparov tweeted: 
Letting Putin crush Ukraine and murder 
thousands of innocents in a European war of 
conquest will redefine the world order. So 
would stopping him. We choose by action or 
inaction which world we want to live in. 
America should choose to stand with 
Ukraine. 
Slava, Ukraini. 
One last point. Zelenskyy made a 
very important observation when it 
came to Putin and his future. I don’t 
know if there are enough brave Rus-
sians to stand up to him—I hope there 
are—to depose him from power in that 
country, but if they don’t, we are naive 
to believe that Ukraine is the end of 
his conquest agenda. He wants to re-
store the Soviet Union, and many of us 
know what that means—the Baltics. It 
means Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, 
as President Zelenskyy reminded us, 
would be the next target. They are 
small. They are near Russian popu-
lations. They are near Belarus, which 
has become a pawn of Vladimir Putin, 
and they are vulnerable. 
The only thing standing between the 
Baltics and subjugation by Vladimir 
Putin is the document known as the

NATO charter. It is an agreement of an 
alliance where every nation under that 
flag will stand to defend the other 
under attack. 
Most of us don’t remember, but after 
9/11/2001, the NATO allies came to-
gether and said that the United States 
had been attacked under article 5 and 
that they were willing to defend us if 
the terrorism continued. That is the 
kind of solidarity which we needed 
then and which the world needs now. 
The NATO alliance was, unfortu-
nately, weakened under the last Presi-
dent, but they have come around now 
to become a powerful force. 
Just last week on Thursday, 10 of the 
Ambassadors from European nations 
gathered in a room and talked to us 
about their solidarity behind our effort 
to support Ukraine. It was a positive 
meeting, a good feeling, and I am glad 
that the NATO forces understand their 
responsibility and are prepared to de-
fend these countries that are involved. 
There is one last point I want to 
make because it is so outrageous, I be-
lieve it should be reported. The ques-
tion really comes down to an interview 
of Donald Trump, the former President 
of the United States, by Jeanine Pirro 
on FOX television. He called Putin’s 
invasion of Ukraine a project to rebuild 
a Soviet empire that had been, in the 
words of Donald Trump, ‘‘full of love.’’ 
Full of love, a Soviet empire? 
Unfortunately, the former President 
has no knowledge of history, nor does 
he have any understanding as to what 
happened to the countries under the 
subjugation of a Soviet empire, how 
they were forcefully brought into that 
alliance, which they never wanted to 
be part of. He obviously doesn’t recall 
that 4 million Ukrainians died in the 
famines of the 1930s under Joseph Sta-
lin’s Soviet rule. 
At one point, Ronald Reagan called 
the Soviet Union an evil empire. For 
Donald Trump, it is ‘‘full of love.’’ How 
can he be so far wrong and not see the 
obvious—that Putin is not the spiritual 
man he was once identified as? He is a 
ruthless war criminal, and innocent 
people are paying the price for his out-
rages. 
E-CIGARETTES 
Mr. President, there is something 
else that is going on on the domestic 
front. Each of us kind of defines our ca-
reer in Congress as what is important 
to us, and when I came to the House of 
Representatives, I had a little planning 
behind the decision to take after the 
tobacco companies. 
My family was touched by tobacco 
death, as so many families are. I lost 
my father when I was a sophomore in 
high school. I was 14 years old; he was 
53. He died from lung cancer. Two 
packs of Camels a day did it to him. 
I decided in the House of Representa-
tives I would start to take what action 
I could to stop the tobacco companies 
in their deadly march across America. 
So one of the things I did was to ban 
smoking on airplanes, put the law into 
effect, and it has changed dramatically 
not just air travel but life in America. 
I had no idea that that was a tipping 
point, and once we banned smoking on 
airplanes, people would say: Well, why 
didn’t you include schools or office 
buildings or hospitals or veterans fa-
cilities or buses or trains? And the 
dominoes kept falling. Now it is pecu-
liar, it is strange, should someone walk 
into a room and light up a cigarette. It 
just doesn’t happen. So that much was 
done. 
But the tobacco companies didn’t 
stop, even after they were proven to be 
liars under oath before the U.S. House 
of Representatives when they were 
asked whether or not tobacco caused 
cancer. 
My new cause, again, against tobacco 
companies relates to e-cigarettes and 
vaping. 
It has been 6 months—6 months. That 
is how long past a court-ordered dead-
line the Food and Drug Administration 
is to finish its public health review of 
e-cigarettes—6 months. As an attorney, 
if my client were 6 months late in 
meeting a court order, there would be 
major consequences, but for the FDA, 
it appears to be business as usual. 
Mind you, this is not some bureau-
cratic squabble. The issue at stake is 
whether or not the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration will do its job to prevent 
children 
in 
America 
from 
getting 
hooked on e-cigarettes that are being 
peddled by big tobacco companies in 
violation of the law. 
You see, the Tobacco Control Act, 
the law of the land, requires that to-
bacco products be reviewed by the FDA 
before they can even be sold. The law 
says tobacco companies must prove to 
the FDA that their product is ‘‘appro-
priate for the protection of public 
health.’’ They can’t meet that stand-
ard. Everyone knows it. If they don’t 
meet it, they are not supposed be sold 
in the United States, period. That is 
the law. 
But instead of doing its job, the FDA 
turned a blind eye for years at e-ciga-
rettes and vaping—many funded by the 
largest cigarette corporations like R.J. 
Reynolds and Altria. Those companies 
flooded the market with flavored e- 
cigarettes meant to hook our kids. The 
result: Millions of children became ad-
dicted to e-cigarettes. Big Tobacco in-
tentionally 
targeted 
children 
with 
trendy advertisements and fruit- or 
candy-flavored nicotine products. 
These actions and FDA’s failure to 
regulate e-cigarettes were a flagrant 
violation of existing law, so in 2019, a 
Federal judge stepped in and called the 
Agency out for its abdication of re-
sponsibility. The judge found that the 
Food and Drug Administration ‘‘de-
cided not to enforce the pre-market re-
view provisions at all.’’ So the Federal 
court gave the FDA a deadline. Listen 
carefully. It required the FDA to com-
plete its review of the legality of all e- 
cigarettes being sold in the United 
States by September 9, 2021. 
When that deadline arrived 6 months 
ago, FDA announced that it had denied 
millions of applications for e-cigarettes 
that had no business on the market. 
That was important and long overdue. 
However, a new trend emerged. Vaping 
companies, 
including 
many 
whose 
products had been denied by the FDA, 
were attempting to circumvent the law 
by reinventing their products. 
Many e-cigarette companies tried to 
use so-called synthetic nicotine. We 
know nicotine—it is the habit-forming 
drug that is included in tobacco ciga-
rettes. So they decided that if they 
made nicotine not out of tobacco but 
out of other chemicals, they would es-
cape the reach of law. 
The day after the FDA ordered 
Texas-based VaporSalon to remove its 
products from the market, the com-
pany announced: 
VaporSalon is switching to tobacco-free 
nicotine . . . the main purpose of this is to 
be outside of FDA’s regulations. 
They were very bold about it. They 
wanted to hook our kids with synthetic 
nicotine and were arguing the govern-
ment couldn’t stop them. 
The e-cigarette most popular with 
children is known as Puff Bar. It uses 
synthetic nicotine to escape the reach 
of the FDA. They peddle these addict-
ive cigarettes to our kids in flavors not 
designed for any adults. Listen to the 
flavors: Blue Raz, Lemon Ice, Water-
melon. 
FDA is asleep at the wheel. But Con-
gress recognized this problem recently 
and did something about it. The fiscal 
year 2022 omnibus bill that passed last 
week contains a bipartisan provision 
that I worked on with Senators COL-
LINS and MURRAY. Our policy closes the 
synthetic nicotine loophole. 
When President Biden signs that law 
today, we are going to see this law go 
into effect and clarify the FDA as the 
authority to regulate synthetic nico-
tine products and to keep those e-ciga-
rettes off the market. Congress is say-
ing clearly that we will not allow pred-
atory vaping companies to target kids 
for profit. Now, it is the FDA’s duty to 
do the same. 
I recently voted for the new Director, 
Dr. Califf, and I said to him: I am going 
to watch you, and I am going to be on 
you like a hawk. You have a Federal 
legal responsibility to stop these e- 
cigarettes from being sold to our kids. 
Don’t waste time. 
I hope he doesn’t. I hope the FDA 
will use their new authority. 
JUUL and Puff Bar are two compa-
nies most responsible for fueling the 
youth vaping epidemic. They continue 
to be sold despite court-ordered dead-
lines and despite the fact they use 
these kid-friendly flavors and tactics. 
So why has the FDA not removed 
them? Why are more teens and even 
preteens still getting hooked on e-ciga-
rettes? FDA has the authority to clear 
all unauthorized e-cigarettes from the 
market and force their sellers to prove 
that their products—it is their legal re-
sponsibility to prove their products are 
appropriate for the protection of public 
health. 
Good luck. They are not going to be 
able to do that, and we know it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1162 
March 15, 2022 
Last week, I led a bipartisan letter 
with Senator ROMNEY, Republican of 
Utah, and 13 other Senators saying to 
the FDA to do three things: finish the 
review of e-cigarettes immediately; re-
ject the applications for e-cigarettes, 
especially kid-friendly flavors; and No. 
3, clear the market of all unapproved e- 
cigarettes. 
Last month, when the Senate ap-
proved Dr. Califf, I made it clear that I 
wanted to treat this matter as an ur-
gent requirement and to clear the 
backlog. Congress has now given him 
every tool he needs. Today marks 1 
month of his tenure as Commissioner. 
Will he keep his word to me and so 
many others to protect kids from a 
lifetime of addiction? It is time for 
FDA to do its job and protect Amer-
ica’s kids from Big Tobacco and their 
candy-flavored, 
sickness-causing 
e- 
cigarettes. 
I yield the floor.

AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, Friday 
marked the first anniversary of the so- 
called American Rescue Plan, which is 
the Democrats’ partisan $1.9 trillion 
spending spree. Fittingly, the anniver-
sary arrived just 1 day after the release 
of February’s inflation numbers which 
marked the worst inflation since Janu-
ary of 1982. 
Why do I say ‘‘fittingly’’? 
Well, because the anniversary of the 
American Rescue Plan is basically the 
anniversary of our inflation crisis. 
While it is true that supply chain 
issues and the reopening of economies 
after COVID shutdowns created certain 
inflationary pressures, a big part of the 
reason for our current inflation crisis 
is Democrats’ decision to pass the 
American Rescue Plan last March. 
The definition of inflation is too 
many dollars chasing too few goods and 
services, and that is exactly the situa-
tion Democrats helped create with 
their so-called American Rescue Plan. 
Democrats 
came 
into 
office 
mere 
weeks after Congress had passed a 
fifth—fifth—bipartisan 
COVID 
relief 
bill totaling almost $1 trillion and 
meeting, essentially, all current press-
ing COVID needs. Our economy was 
well on its way to a healthy recovery, 
and the majority of States had the 
money they needed to deal with the 
pandemic. In short, it was abundantly 
clear that we were not in immediate 
need of trillions more in government 
spending. 
But that didn’t stop Democrats. Now 
that they were in charge, they were 
eager to take advantage of the COVID 
crisis to begin implementing their Big 
Government vision. So in the name of 
COVID relief, they pushed through a 
massive partisan $1.9 trillion spending 
piece of legislation filled with unneces-
sary spending and handouts to Demo-
cratic interest groups. Less than 9 per-
cent of that $1.9 trillion spending bill 
was earmarked for actually combating 
COVID. The rest went to priorities like 
a $350 billion slush fund for States, a 
bailout for union pensions, rental as-
sistance far in excess of anything that 
was needed, and the list goes on. 
Despite being billed as essential 
COVID relief, a substantial portion of 
the money appropriated will not be 
spent until 2022 or later; and despite 
the pressing need for workers to fill the 
millions of available job openings, 
Democrats 
created 
incentives 
for 
Americans to stay on unemployment 
instead of returning to work by extend-
ing enhanced unemployment benefits 
until September of 2021, long after they 
were likely to be needed. So the end re-
sult of all this was entirely predictable. 
Democrats flooded the economy with 
unnecessary government money, and 
the economy overheated as a result. 
And you don’t have to take my word 
for it. Here is what Steve Rattner, who 
served in the Obama administration, 
had to say in November: 
The original sin was the $1.9 trillion 
American 
Rescue 
Plan, 
passed 
in 
March. The bill—almost completely 
unfunded—sought to counter the ef-
fects of the COVID pandemic by focus-
ing on demand-side stimulus rather 
than on investment. That has contrib-
uted materially to today’s inflation 
levels. 
Let me repeat that. This, according 
to Steve Rattner, who worked in the 
Obama administration, about infla-
tion—talked 
about 
the 
legislation 
passed last year by the Democrats. He 
said that this ‘‘has contributed materi-
ally to today’s inflation levels.’’ 
Or, as another former Obama admin-
istration member put it: 
The United States has had much more in-
flation than almost any other advanced 
economy in the world. 
That was Jason Furman, an econo-
mist at Harvard University and former 
Obama administration economic ad-
viser. 
He went on to say: 
The difference comes because the United 
States stimulus is in a category of its own. 
That, again, from another former 
Obama 
administration 
economist, 
Jason Furman. 
Inflation started to rise almost as 
soon as the ink was dry on the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, and it just keeps ris-
ing. February’s 7.9 percent inflation 
marks the worst inflation since Janu-
ary of 1982—January of 1982—40 years 
ago. 
And Americans are struggling. Just 
going to the grocery store is taking up 
a larger and larger portion of the 
American paycheck. Ground beef is up 
13 percent; eggs are up 11 percent; cit-
rus fruits are up 16 percent; chicken is 
up 13 percent; milk, up 11 percent; 
bacon and related products are up 18 
percent; and on and on and on. 
In fact, one American quoted in the 
New York Times noted that bacon is 
now as expensive as filet mignon used 
to be. Ordinary goods are starting to 
feel like luxury objects as more and 
more families struggle to afford basic 
grocery items. 
A Washington Post columnist noted 
that a number of the price increases re-
corded for February were the highest 
annual increases ever recorded for 
those items, including an 8.4-percent 
increase in the price of baby food and 
an 11-percent increase in the cost of 
lunch meat. 
In a speech to House Democrats last 
week, the President suggested that he 
was ‘‘sick of’’ people saying that Demo-
crats’ reckless spending had helped 
cause our inflation crisis. This is what 
the President said last week—Presi-
dent Biden: 
[T]he American people think the reason for 
inflation is the government is spending more 
money. Simply not true. 
Well, there are a lot of economists 
who would disagree with him, includ-
ing the two Democratic economists I 
have already quoted. And President 
Biden himself actually admitted in No-
vember that his stimulus checks helped 
increase the demand fueling inflation. I 
am sorry that President Biden is sick 
of having people point this out. 
But you know who else is sick and 
tired of things? The American people. 
They are sick and tired of facing mas-
sive price increases everywhere they 
look. They are sick of increasingly 
having to live paycheck to paycheck as 
they wonder just how much further 
their grocery prices are going to go up. 
They are sick of wondering if they will 
be able to pay all of next month’s bills. 
And whether President Biden likes it 
or not, his so-called American Rescue 
Plan is responsible for a substantial 
part of the economic distress that 
Americans are now experiencing. And 
while President Biden may be sick of 
it, we need to keep talking about this 
because the President is still—still— 
trying to double down on the spending 
strategy that helped create this infla-
tion crisis in the first place. Just 2 
weeks ago in the State of the Union 
Address, the President discussed infla-
tion and outlined his hopes for massive 
new amounts of government spending, 
spending that would unquestionably 
take an already bad inflation situation 
and make it even worse. 
It is nice that the President and con-
gressional Democrats are now talking 
about our inflation crisis, but it would 
be even nicer if they would realize that 
it was their spending that helped trig-
ger this crisis in the first place; other-
wise, we will continue to see Demo-
crats push for ever bigger increases in 
government spending with correspond-
ingly devastating price increases for 
American families. 
The American Rescue Plan was a bad 
deal for Americans. Let’s hope that 
Democrats do not have the chance to 
double down on this legislation and 
make our current inflation crisis even 
worse.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
last week, the Senate passed a $1.5 tril-
lion funding bill that the Democratic 
majority insisted was full of must-pass, 
got-to-have-it, 
can’t-live-without-it 
provisions that the American people 
were demanding. Unfortunately, the re-
ality of what made it into that bill 
doesn’t match the fantasy my Demo-
cratic colleagues conjured up for the 
cameras. 
In reality, this $1.5 trillion package 
was another spending spree. It was 
complete with 4,400 earmarks—4,400 
earmarks. Now, these earmarks don’t 
have any Federal nexus. They are not 
connected to your military post or 
your 
Federal 
highway. 
These 
are 
things for shopping centers and parks 
and city renovations and—you name 
it—pet projects. So that is not govern-
ment funding; that is a Big Govern-
ment windfall that the American peo-
ple simply can’t afford. 
As we all know, an inability to pay 
for these programs has never stopped 
this Democratic majority from shoving 
through their radical and increasingly 
destructive agenda. By their own ad-
mission, the out-of-control spending 
habits have contributed to decades- 
high inflation. Imagine that. 
What we know is that, in Tennessee, 
I am talking to people every day. They 
can’t afford food and gas and to pay all 
of their monthly expenses, but for 
some 
reason, 
my 
Democratic 
col-
leagues think taxpayers will be happy 
to pay for their pet projects back 
home—all 4,400 of them. You just can’t 
make this stuff up. 
The American people are really con-
fused by this. They are also completely 
appalled by Joe Biden’s refusal to se-
cure the border, his refusal to invest in 
American energy independence, and his 
willingness to keep our economy en-
tangled with the Chinese Communist 
Party. Every one of these points wor-
ries them. Yet what really scares them 
is the President’s refusal to discuss any 
of it: Just don’t talk about it. It will go 
away. Inflation, that is transitory. If 
gas is too expensive, go buy yourself an 
electric vehicle. This is just so dis-
respectful of hard-working men and 
women. 
Joe Biden has caused a lot more 
problems than he solved during the 
first year of his Presidency, and his 
constant pivots away from life-or- 
death problems have destroyed what 
little trust the American people had 
left in his ability to get the job done. 
They like to think that the President 
cares about what happens to them—the 
American 
people, 
the 
citizens—but 
they haven’t seen any evidence to sug-
gest that he is thinking about them. 
Last week, I was up on the Plateau in 
Tennessee, 
talking 
to 
Tennesseans 
about what is going on here in the Sen-
ate. Most of what they tell me boils 
down to one simple truth: From where 
they are sitting and the news they are 
watching and the papers they are read-
ing, it is clear that the Democrats have 
a very aggressive agenda, but they 
have no vision for the future of this 
country. They feel like what the Demo-
crats want is control over their daily 
life, not a vision of a country filled 
with open doors and opportunity for 
all. They are not seeing that out of this 
agenda. 
Why, they ask me, do their elected 
representatives 
take 
such 
drastic 
measures to do things that make their 
lives harder, that make their situa-
tions worse? They can’t figure it out. 
Since Joe Biden and the Democrats 
took 
control, 
inflation 
has 
sky-
rocketed. We have become energy de-
pendent on Russia. We have abandoned 
not one, but two embassies. We high-
tailed it out of there. Two embassies, 
cut and run. Our Border Patrol, they 
are apprehending known terrorists and 
MS–13 gang members who are coming 
into this country. If they are appre-
hending them, we are getting some but 
not all. And now we are hearing about 
Russia going out, going to Iran, saying: 
Let me have your soldiers for hire; let 
me have your proxies, the Wagner 
Group, which is closely aligned with 
Vladimir Putin. 
And all the time, Tennesseans are 
saying: Well, what about these terror-
ists trying to come over the southern 
border? Are they mercenaries? Are 
they soldiers for hire? 
People are raising these issues. And 
this is all part of what the Democrats 
have accomplished this year. 
The American people tolerate quite a 
bit from their government, but one 
thing they won’t accept is a President 
who shrugs his shoulders, runs from 
the podium, who claims to be a victim 
of circumstance, who is weak-kneed 
and refuses to lead. 
Even former Obama White House of-
ficials have come forward begging the 
Biden administration to stop the spin, 
face reality, show some leadership, 
deal with the situation. This has to be 
getting embarrassing, even for them. 
The American people have spent the 
past year watching Joe Biden abandon 
the policies that kept the country from 
collapsing under the weight of the pan-
demic. And what has he replaced those 
policies with? Mandates, lockdowns 
that have made the country poorer, in-
creased regulation that has stopped oil 
and gas exploration, increased regula-
tion that is making it tougher on man-
ufacturers, a push for higher taxes— 
that is what they are doing. And do 
you know what? It makes people less 
hopeful. It makes people less free. It 
gives people fewer options. 
See, that is what they are seeing. 
The Democratic agenda is all about 
government control of your life. It is 
an agenda; it is not a vision for this 
country, for our children, for our 
grandchildren that is rooted in oppor-
tunity for all. 
There is only one way to undo this 
damage and to stop this train that this 
administration is pushing as hard as 
they can toward socialism. The Presi-
dent needs to stop the spin. He needs to 
start listening to what people are say-
ing, people across the country. 
Here is the thing: They don’t want 
this President to fail. They don’t want 
him to fail. They don’t want this coun-
try to fail, so it means that the Presi-
dent is going to have to stop bowing to 
all of this environmentalism as a reli-
gion and climate change as a god. They 
need to stop that. 
They need to see, yes, we need to 
have an Operation Warp Speed, to be 
energy independent, pull everybody to-
gether—Federal Agencies, the private 
sector. 
We are the United States of America, 
and if we had the desire, we could do 
this. We could be energy independent 
once again. We could stand strong. We 
could stand strong against Russia, 
against Iran, against China and the 
Chinese Communist Party. 
What that is going to require is an 
administration 
and 
a 
Democratic 
Party that has a vision for the great-
ness and goodness of this country. 
I think that what we have to do is we 
have to lead the way in saying it is 
time to show respect for the American 
people, to listen to what they are tell-
ing us, and to make certain that we 
stand for this country, standing strong 
for future generations.

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as all of 
America knows, prices at the gas pump 
are skyrocketing. Over the weekend, 
the average gas price in Texas exceeded 
$4 a gallon, and we typically have some 
of the cheapest gasoline in the country. 
We didn’t even cross that line during 
the great recession of 2008. But we 
know that gas prices are not the only

commodity that is growing and that 
family budgets are strained by. Con-
sumers are also paying more for every-
thing from groceries to clothes, to ap-
pliances. 
Folks in Texas and across the coun-
try want to know, what is President 
Biden’s plan to address high gasoline 
prices? Last week, the President was, 
appropriately enough, asked this very 
question. His response? He said: 
Can’t do much right now. Russia is respon-
sible. 
That is a quote—‘‘Russia is respon-
sible.’’ Well, people across the country 
know that the price of gasoline, the 
spike that we are experiencing now, 
preceded the invasion of Ukraine. 
Folks across the country can’t afford 
to fill up their gas tanks to get to 
work, and the President points the fin-
ger at Vladimir Putin. Well, there is no 
question that the war in Ukraine exac-
erbated what was already an existing 
problem with the price of gasoline, but 
certainly it was not the cause of it. But 
the President conveniently omits the 
fact that gasoline prices were a prob-
lem long before Ukraine was attacked. 
For example, the week the President 
took office, Americans were paying an 
average of $2.38 a gallon. Month after 
month, those prices steadily climbed. 
By mid-May, the average price exceed-
ed $3.10 a gallon, and by Thanksgiving, 
it was $3.30 a gallon. Just as a re-
minder, this was months before Russia 
invaded, which did not happen until 
February 24 of this year. Even in the 
last full week before the invasion, gas 
prices were painfully high at $3.50 a 
gallon. 
So, yes, prices have risen since the 
invasion, and there is no question that 
the Russian aggression is a factor be-
hind price jumps in the past few weeks, 
but this was a preexisting problem for 
which apparently the President had no 
solution. It is disingenuous for the ad-
ministration to blame recordbreaking 
prices 
entirely 
on 
Russia. 
During 
Biden’s first year in office, from Janu-
ary of last year to January of this 
year, gas prices increased 40 percent— 
40 percent. Those increases had nothing 
to do with President Putin and had ev-
erything to do with President Biden. 
One of the President’s first actions 
after taking office was to cancel the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. This pipeline 
would have given Canadian crude a 
quick and affordable path to refiners 
and processors in the United States 
and then to global markets through 
the Gulf of Mexico. This increased sup-
ply would add to the domestic markets 
and top off the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve and even make its way to our 
friends and allies overseas. Given the 
state of the world’s energy security 
today, it is easy to see how the Key-
stone XL Pipeline would have helped if 
the President had given it an oppor-
tunity. 
This project would have also brought 
serious economic gains in the form of 
good-paying jobs right here in Amer-
ica, increased tax revenue, and benefits 
for communities along the pipeline’s 
route. But with the stroke of a pen, the 
President killed the Keystone XL Pipe-
line and the many benefits that would 
have been provided in terms of our en-
ergy security and the price of gasoline 
at the pump. 
Unfortunately, that was the begin-
ning but not the end of the administra-
tion’s flawed energy policies. Just a 
few days later, the Biden administra-
tion placed a temporary moratorium 
on all new leasing permits on Federal 
lands, effectively sending more busi-
ness to Russia and OPEC producers 
whom he actually called upon to 
produce more oil. That is right. Before 
the Russian invasion, President Biden 
called on OPEC—of which Russia is a 
member and of which Saudi Arabia is a 
dominant producer—to produce more 
oil overseas rather than to unleash 
American energy right here at home. 
Well, the administration later at-
tempted to set the ‘‘social cost’’ of car-
bon, as they call it, at $51 a metric 
ton—a high and arbitrary figure de-
signed to hamper fossil fuel production 
right here at home—and then it sus-
pended oil and gas production in both 
Alaska and New Mexico. 
The administration even took aim at 
refiners. The United States relies on an 
expansive network of refiners to supply 
gasoline, diesel fuel, and other petro-
leum products. The renewable fuel 
standard requires refiners to blend a 
certain amount of renewable fuel, 
which is simply untenable for many 
small refiners. And small refiners dis-
proportionately actually produce gaso-
line, which means that the pressure on 
these small refiners actually has a dis-
proportionate impact on higher gaso-
line prices. 
The Environmental Protection Agen-
cy has the authority to grant tem-
porary exemptions to small refiners if 
compliance would cause them to suffer 
serious economic hardship. Those ex-
emptions used to be pretty standard 
practice. President Obama and Presi-
dent Trump each granted dozens of ex-
emptions while in office. But so far, 
President Biden has refused to grant a 
single exemption to small refineries. 
Small refineries are hurting, and un-
less President Biden finally grants 
some of these exemptions, some of 
them may be forced to close their 
doors, exacerbating again high energy 
prices. If fewer refiners are operating, 
gasoline prices will go up, not down. 
President Biden and his administra-
tion aren’t the only ones who have 
taken aim at oil and gas production 
here in America in the last year. Many 
of our colleagues who have argued that 
oil and gas production is somehow un-
necessary or obsolete and could be re-
placed today with solely renewable en-
ergy have been misleading the Amer-
ican people in believing that we could 
make that transition today or anytime 
in the near future. While renewable en-
ergy is an important part of our energy 
sources—in Texas, we produce more 
electricity from wind than any other 
State in the Nation—we believe in an 
‘‘all of the above’’ energy policy. 
I actually have heard members of the 
administration say one of the solutions 
for eliminating the importation of Rus-
sian oil would be to move entirely to 
renewables. Well, the Energy Informa-
tion Administration, which is the offi-
cial spokesman on these matters for 
the U.S. Government, says that by the 
year 2050, 74 percent of our energy 
sources in America will still be fossil 
fuel. That is four times the amount of 
energy that can be produced by renew-
ables. 
That doesn’t mean we are going to 
stay stuck on where we are now. We 
will continue to look for new and inno-
vative ways to add to our energy diver-
sity and improve our climate and envi-
ronment at the same time. But to sug-
gest disingenuously to the American 
people that one way we can deal with 
cutting off Russian imports is simply 
to do away with oil and gas in America 
is a ludicrous statement. 
Other regulatory measures promoted 
by the administration have also dis-
couraged American energy production, 
like 
the 
reckless 
tax-and-spending 
spree to pile even more costs and regu-
lations on American oil and gas; for ex-
ample, a methane tax on energy com-
panies, banning offshore drilling, in-
creasing onshore royalty fees, and put-
ting domestic oil and gas producers in 
a choke hold. 
Now that gas prices have gone 
through the roof, some of our col-
leagues have come up with another 
unhelpful solution. They want to tem-
porarily suspend the gas tax through 
November, which happens to be the 
elections. That is no coincidence. This 
idea has been soundly rejected a num-
ber of times over the years by both Re-
publicans and Democrats. 
In 2008, gas prices were soaring and 
the 
then-Presidential 
candidate, 
Barack Obama, attacked his opponents 
for endorsing a gas tax holiday, as 
many of our colleagues here in the Sen-
ate have endorsed currently. 
At 
the 
time, 
Candidate 
Barack 
Obama, Senator Barack Obama, said: 
This isn’t an idea designed to get you 
through the summer, it’s an idea designed to 
get [you] through an election. 
In short, this isn’t a fix for high gas 
prices; it is a talking point for political 
campaigns and candidates. 
This is a gimmick to create the illu-
sion of action, while really doing noth-
ing but draining the highway trust 
fund that we rely upon to build our 
roads and bridges. 
Still, a few of our colleagues in the 
Senate have offered a bill that would 
suspend the gas tax through the end of 
the year. I am sure it comes as no sur-
prise that a majority of the bill’s spon-
sors are on the ballot this year. 
For more than a year now, Repub-
licans have warned about the potential 
consequences of the attack on domestic 
energy 
production. 
We 
have 
high-
lighted the ways the policies could

drive up prices, harm our energy secu-
rity, and threaten that of our allies. 
Even as gas prices rose month after 
month, the Biden administration did 
nothing. They didn’t attempt a mid-
course correction. They didn’t open 
this topic up for debate. They just 
stayed the course. 
Back in November, the Secretary of 
Energy was asked about increasing 
U.S. 
oil 
production. 
She 
literally 
laughed and said: 
That is hilarious. 
Well, it certainly isn’t funny now. 
Gas prices are now averaging $4.32 a 
gallon, and our allies are frantically 
trying to reduce their reliance on Rus-
sian oil and gas, which in many cases is 
their sole source. 
President Biden has tried to pin 
these problems squarely on Russia and 
Vladimir Putin, but the American peo-
ple are smart. They know the truth. 
They know that high prices predated 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and they 
know about the war being waged on do-
mestic energy production by some of 
our colleagues across the aisle. 
And they are smart enough to know 
that you can’t believe President Biden 
when he says you can’t do much about 
it because Russia is responsible. 
I yield the floor.

SUNSHINE PROTECTION ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, let me 
cut right to the chase here before I get 
into a statement. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and

A bill (S. 623) to make daylight saving time 
permanent, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Rubio sub-
stitute at the desk be considered and 
agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be 
considered read a third time and 
passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 5000) in the na-
ture of a substitute was agreed to as 
follows: 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)

amendments made by this Act take effect on 
November 5, 2023. 
The bill (S. 623) was ordered to be en-
grossed for a third reading, was read 
the third time, and passed. 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as the 
day goes on, I look forward to others 
who will be coming to the floor here in 
a moment. You will see it is an eclectic 
collection of Members of the U.S. Sen-
ate in favor of what we have just done 
here in the Senate, and that is to pass 
a bill to make daylight saving time 
permanent. 
Just this past weekend, we all went 
through that biannual ritual of chang-
ing the clock back and forth and the 
disruption that comes with it. And one 
has to ask themselves after a while: 
Why do we keep doing it? Why are we 
doing this? 
This really began back in 1918 as a 
practice that was supposed to save en-
ergy, and since then we have adjusted 
it. 
Today, daylight saving time, which 
started out as 6 months, was extended 
to 8 months in 2005, clearly showing 
you what people’s preference was. So 
we are doing this back-and-forth of 
clock-changing for about 16 weeks of 
standard time a year. 
Now, I think the majority of the 
American people’s preference is just to 
stop the back-and-forth changing. But 
beyond that, I think their preference 
is, certainly, at least based on today’s 
vote and what we have heard, is to 
make daylight saving time permanent. 
I will just tell you a couple of the 
reasons why I think that is important. 
There is some strong science behind it 
that is now showing and making people 
aware of the harm that clock-switching 
has. We see an increase in heart at-
tacks and car accidents and pedestrian 
accidents in the week that follow the 
changes. 
The benefits of daylight saving time 
have also been accounted for in the re-
search; for example, reduced crime, as 
there is light later in the day. We have 
seen decreases in child obesity, a de-
crease in seasonal depression that 
many feel during standard time, and 
then the practical one and the one that 
I have witnessed with my own eyes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1166 
March 15, 2022 
In many parts of this country—un-
derstand, we are a country where we 
desperately want our kids to be out-
side, to be playing, to be doing sports, 
not just to be sitting in front of a TV 
or a computer terminal or playing 
video games all day. And it gets really 
tough in many parts of the country to 
be able to do that because what ends up 
happening is, especially for these 16 
weeks a year, if you don’t have a park 
or an outdoor facility with lights, you 
are basically shut down around 5 p.m., 
in some places as early as 4, 4:30 p.m. 
And these lights in parks and things 
like that are expensive, and then a lot 
of communities are resistant to them, 
right? 
I have seen it with my own eyes. I 
have 
watched 
sporting 
events 
be 
called—youth sporting events—in the 
middle or near the end of the game be-
fore it has actually concluded because 
there is not enough light. 
So I just think that is one of the 
practical reasons why, if you look at 
the way we live in this country, you 
want to have the ability to spend more 
time in the evenings outdoors, not just 
to enjoy the outdoors but to make 
sporting and outdoor activities avail-
able for people at a time when, frankly, 
we are losing an hour, an hour and a 
half in some parts of the country be-
cause of daylight. 
So I am hoping that after today, this 
will go over to the House, and they will 
act quickly on it. 
I know this is not the most impor-
tant issue confronting America, but it 
is one of those issues where there is a 
lot of agreement, and I think a lot of 
people wonder why it took so long to 
get here. 
So my hope is that after we are done 
here today, that the House will take it 
up; that the House will pass it; and 
that the President will sign it. 
I just want to lay out one caveat. 
This bill and the amendment does 
delay its implementation, and the rea-
son why—and I asked. Believe me, I 
asked: Why are we delaying this? And I 
think it is important. We are delaying 
it until November of 2023 because air-
lines, the rails, transportation meth-
ods, others have already built out 
schedules 
based 
on 
the 
existing 
timeline of this. And so they have 
asked for a few additional months 
here—from industries like broadcasters 
and airlines—to make that adjustment. 
But the good news is that if we can 
get this passed, we don’t have to keep 
doing this stupidity anymore. And why 
we would enshrine this in our laws and 
keep it for so long is beyond me, but 
hopefully this is the year that this gets 
done. 
And pardon the pun, but this is an 
idea whose time has come. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
want to join with the Senator from the 
Sunshine State, letting him know that 
the Senator from the Bay State, the 
Senator from the Ocean State, we 
share a common agenda. We bridge ide-
ological divisions—liberal Democrats 
from the Northeast, conservative Re-
publicans from Florida coming to-
gether to show that this institution 
can work. 
And why is that? 
Well, it is because we know that day-
light saving time helps to turn the cor-
ners of people’s mouths upward into a 
smile. It is sunshine and smiles. 
We have only had daylight saving 
time so far for 2 days, but all across 
the country, people are out in the 
evening with the extra daylight. Little 
League can start. People taking their 
evening walks feel more safe. People 
can just walk down to the town square, 
knowing that the daylight is out there. 
And so this is something that should 
be bipartisan. It should bring us all to-
gether, and I thank the Senator from 
Florida for his leadership on this issue. 
And so many people are wondering, 
can the Congress work? And I think 
here is something that does have a big 
impact on every American life, and 
getting that extra hour of daylight of 
sunshine into people’s lives is abso-
lutely essential. 
So we have been working, you know, 
together to, once and for all, deal with 
this issue of springing forward and fall-
ing back, and that is to make daylight 
saving time permanent. 
This past Sunday, Americans had to 
once again change their clocks, all be-
cause of the outdated government pol-
icy on daylight saving time. This bian-
nual ritual of toggling between day-
light saving time and standard time 
isn’t just an inconvenience to people 
everywhere, it has real repercussions 
on our economy and our daily lives. 
Studies have found that year-round 
daylight saving time would improve 
public health, public safety, energy 
policy, mental health—an especially 
important commitment after this cold 
and dark COVID winter. 
Seasonal affective disorder is real, 
and when they get that extra hour of 
Sun in the evening, it helps tens of mil-
lions of people all across the country to 
finally put the winter into a rearview 
mirror. But let’s be honest. Spring 
really starts when we spring forward to 
daylight saving time. 
So daylight saving time brings sun-
shine, smiles, and savings to every per-
son in the country. And more evening 
sunshine also leads to fewer traffic fa-
talities, increased economic activity, 
and 
more 
recreation 
time. 
From 
afterwork shopping to Little League 
games and family bike rides, an extra 
hour of evening sunshine puts a spring 
in our step and offers a great reason to 
get outside and enjoy the outdoors. 
The case for permanent daylight sav-
ing time is clear. So let’s go from polar 
to solar. Let’s finally make that 
change in our country because cutting 
back on the Sun during the fall and 
winter is a drain on the American peo-
ple. We must pass the Sunshine Protec-
tion Act and make daylight saving 
time permanent once and for all. 
This is an opportunity for Democrats 
and Republicans to come together and 
do something that really helps the 
American people feel better about 
themselves every single day of the 
year. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I am happy to bring the voice of 
the Ocean State to the floor today as 
an 
original 
cosponsor 
of 
Senator 
RUBIO’s bill to make daylight saving 
time permanent. I hope very much that 
we can actually agree to this on the 
floor today and hope for similar action 
in the House. 
Pretty much everybody in Rhode Is-
land experiences the same thing on 
that unhappy day in early November. 
It is usually the 6th or the 7th, when 
suddenly an hour of your day, an hour 
of your daylight, disappears and dusk 
comes an hour earlier. 
And it is a sad time. People are un-
happy. It does darken our lives in a 
very literal sense. And by the time you 
get from November, when we fall back, 
to the shortest day of the year in De-
cember, the 21st, I think it is, we have 
sunset in Rhode Island at 4:15—4:15. 
That means everybody is driving home, 
if they work regular 9-to-5 hours—they 
are driving home in the pitch dark, and 
there is no real need for it. So let’s 
make it 5:15 instead. 
Now, granted, there are people who 
are up between 6:30 and 7:30 in the 
morning who will lose their hour of 
daylight, but there are a lot fewer peo-
ple up and about between 6:30 and 7:30 
in the morning than there are between 
4:15 and 5:15 in the afternoon. 
And particularly in that afternoon 
hour, that is when kids have come 
home from school, and you would like 
to have them run around outside a lit-
tle bit more. That is when people are 
doing errands, and it would be nice if 
there were some daylight for that. 
So I am eager to be rid of ‘‘fall 
back,’’ and this would give us a chance 
for Americans all across the country to 
be rid of ‘‘fall back’’ and make daylight 
saving time permanent and to add a 
little sunlight into most people’s lives. 
With that, I will recognize the distin-
guished chairman of our Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, 
today, the Senate has finally delivered 
on something Americans all over the 
country want: to never have to change 
their clocks again. 
My colleague Senator RUBIO and I 
have finally passed the Sunshine Pro-
tection Act, a bipartisan bill to finally 
make daylight saving time permanent. 
This past weekend, Americans from 
Washington State to Florida had to 
lose an hour of sleep for absolutely no 
reason. This is a burden and a headache 
we don’t need. Any parent who has 
worked so hard to get a newborn or a 
toddler on a regular sleeping schedule

understands the absolute chaos chang-
ing our clocks creates and for no good 
reason. There is enough going on as it 
is, and we can fix this one inconven-
ience and stress pretty easily. 
And if the House follows the lead of 
the U.S. Senate, we can make it so no 
one anywhere has to change their 
clocks by making daylight saving time 
permanent. 
I hope my colleagues in the House 
and everyone can understand that no 
one wants to see the Sun set at 4 
o’clock in the afternoon, which it cur-
rently does in the winter for those of 
us on the west coast. 
In just this Congress, we have passed 
major bipartisan bills to strengthen 
supply chains and promote American 
manufacturing and make a genera-
tional investment in our infrastruc-
ture. Let’s keep up that bipartisanship 
and make daylight saving time perma-
nent. 
Voters throughout the Pacific time 
zone have made clear they are ready 
for permanent daylight saving time. In 
California, Oregon, Idaho, and my 
home State of Washington, we have all 
passed laws to adopt permanent day-
light saving time as soon as Congress 
acts. So many other States are on the 
same page. These States need us to 
take action at the Federal level. 
This is a simple, commonsense meas-
ure that we can all take back to our 
constituents that does away with the 
completely unnecessary inconvenience 
in everyone’s lives. No more dark after-
noons in the winter. No more losing an 
hour of sleep every spring. We want 
more sunshine during our most produc-
tive waking hours. 
I have said it before, and I will say it 
again: Americans want more sunshine 
and less depression. People in this 
country all the way from Seattle to 
Miami want the Sunshine Protection 
Act. 
We got it passed here in the Senate. 
Now the clock is ticking to get the job 
done so we don’t have to switch our 
clocks again. 
So I urge my colleagues in the House 
to act swiftly, as we have done, to get 
this bill on President Biden’s desk and 
deliver sunshine to Americans across 
the country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING

The

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous 
consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Let me make it 
clear to anybody who is watching that 
they just saw this measure pass. We 
have just passed the bill to end the re-
turn to daylight saving time—to make 
daylight saving time permanent. 
I yield the floor. 
With that, I suggest the absence of a 
quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, first of all, I would like to say 
thanks to my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle for getting out here today 
and starting down the road to making 
daylight saving time permanent. 
I cannot overstate how grateful I am 
that this bill passed this Chamber just 
a few minutes ago by unanimous con-
sent. It is especially timely given that 
we all had to change our clocks this 
past weekend, and we are now experi-
encing longer, sunnier days, but it 
would be better news if longer, sunnier 
days were a new norm and not a cause 
for a temporary, seasonal celebration, 
which is why I hope my colleagues in 
the House of Representatives pass this 
bill quickly. 
The practice of springing forward im-
pacts folks across the Nation and has 
far-reaching benefits beyond the obvi-
ous but enjoyable hour of daylight that 
brings happy, happy times to every-
body. 
Alabamians have made this clear. 
Since I joined Senator RUBIO in the ef-
fort to pass the Sunshine Protection 
Act, the phones in my office have been 
absolutely ringing off the hook in sup-
port of permanently adopting daylight 
saving time—from moms and dads who 
want more daylight time before put-
ting their kids to bed so dinnertime 
doesn’t feel like bedtime and from el-
derly people who want more Sun in the 
evenings in order to take a walk or 
enjoy working in their yards. For farm-
ers, who could use the extra daylight 
to work in the fields, it is a better busi-
ness model and adds to the bottom 
line. 
But it is not just people in the State 
of Alabama; Americans across the 
country want to make daylight saving 
time permanent. In fact, it is worth 
noting that this bill has bipartisan sup-
port, evidenced by the fact that it 
passed with no objection here in the 
Senate mere moments ago. It is no se-
cret how rare that is here in this 
Chamber. 
Locking the clock, or doing away 
with the twice-a-year time change, is a 
simple measure that would have far- 
reaching results. For example, from a 
health perspective, cases of SAD, or 
seasonal affective disorder, are much 
more common in the winter months 
than in the summer months. From an 
economic perspective, the time change 
costs the U.S. economy an estimated 
$430 million annually when accounting 
for lost productivity. It is simply com-
mon sense to update this outdated 
practice. 
Daylight saving time began as a tem-
porary measure during World War I to 
conserve energy, but in the last cen-
tury, our world has changed dramati-
cally. What might have made sense 
during 1918 does not make sense today. 
That is why Alabama, along with 17 
other State legislatures, has passed 
legislation or resolutions to flip the 
switch on this outdated practice and 
permanently 
increase 
our 
daylight 
hours, but these changes at the State 
level cannot take place until a Federal 
law is passed. We have taken the first 
step today in the Senate by passing 
this bill. Now it is on the House’s side. 
Again, my thanks to Senator RUBIO 
and my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle. I hope the House acts quickly so 
we can get this to the President’s desk 
and get the results that the American 
people want, and that is more sun-
shine. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I

for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
ENERGY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
American energy. 
Joe Biden is the President of high 
prices and of low approval ratings. Just 
yesterday, a gallon of gas sold for the 
highest price ever in the United States, 
and inflation is at a 40-year high. 
Now, the American people clearly un-
derstand that radical Democrat energy 
policies are the cause of these high 
prices—the prices that people are pay-
ing every time they go to the pump to 
fill up. 
On Thursday, the White House ad-
mitted, in terms of these high prices, 
that it is going to get worse. Of course, 
Democrats are trying to blame Vladi-
mir Putin for the high price at the 
pump. Well, to me, it is dishonest, and 
it is desperate. Vladimir Putin didn’t 
cause the inflation crisis that began in 
this country 12 months ago. 
Now, Vladimir Putin has cashed in 
on America’s inflation crisis. He has 
done it by selling more energy at high 
prices, and he has done it for more 
than a year. It has been his cash cow. 
America’s inflation crisis is specifi-
cally the result of Democrat spending 
and Democrat attacks on American en-
ergy. The two combined have added to 
the situation that we are in now, at-
tacking American energy and massive 
spending. 
Last March, Joe Biden signed the sin-
gle-most expensive spending bill in 
American history. Even his own ex-
perts warned him not to do it. 
Democrat economics expert Larry 
Summers, who had been Treasury Sec-
retary for President Clinton, warned 
that this is going to cause inflation. 
Last February, the former Obama and

mers: 
There is a chance that . . . stimulus on a 
scale closer to World War II levels . . . will 
set off inflationary pressures. 
He said: 
Inflationary pressures of a kind [that] we 
have not seen in a generation. 
He is exactly right. That is what has 
happened. That is why we are at a 40- 
year high of inflation, and that is a 
generation. 
Obama adviser Jason Furman said 
the same thing. He said that bill was 
‘‘definitely too big.’’ He said: ‘‘I don’t 
know 
any 
economist’’—‘‘any,’’ 
he 
said—‘‘who was recommending some-
thing the size of what’’ President Biden 
was doing. 
Yet Joe Biden proved to be hard of 
hearing, refused to listen to what they 
had to say, signed the bill anyway, put 
$2 trillion on our Nation’s credit card, 
and he flooded the country with gov-
ernment cash. Ever since then, this 
country has been in an inflation up-
ward spiral. 
At the same time, Joe Biden also had 
a stranglehold over American energy 
supply. He announced it during the 
campaign and enforced it the day he 
took office. 
Energy is called the master resource 
for a reason. It powers our economy. It 
powers our military. It powers our Na-
tion. It is critically important. When 
the price of energy goes up, so does the 
price of everything else. 
Starting on his first day in office, 
Joe Biden has waged an all-out war on 
American energy. He shut down the 
Keystone XL Pipeline, and he bragged 
about it—no hiding from this one. He 
shut down oil and gas leases on Federal 
lands. He bragged about that as well. 
He shut down exploration for energy in 
the Arctic. 
It was always interesting to see the 
senior Senator from Alaska, Ms. MUR-
KOWSKI, come to the floor and say over 
the last year that we are using more 
energy from Vladimir Putin’s Russia 
than we are from Alaska, her home 
State, in terms of oil. 
Those are because of Joe Biden’s poli-
cies. 
Now his lackeys at the Federal En-
ergy Regulatory Commission are mak-
ing it almost impossible to build gas 
pipelines, to move gas from where it is 
explored to where it is needed. As a re-
sult, we are today actually producing a 
lot less energy than we were prior to 
the pandemic. 
I heard the White House spokes-
person. She talked about the fact that 
we are at record-high levels. We are 
not. We are at about 1.3 million barrels 
of oil a day—fewer now being produced 
in the United States than we were 
prior to the pandemic. Prior to the 
pandemic, we were No. 1 in production 
in the world. Now we are No. 3, behind 
Saudi Arabia and behind Russia. 
What does lower supply of American 
energy mean? Well, in supply and de-
mand, 
lower 
supply 
means 
higher 
prices. 
When Joe Biden took office, a gallon 
of gas was at $2.38. It went up every 
month. Twelve of the last 13 months, 
the price of gas kept going up at the 
pump. Twelve of the 13 months that 
Joe Biden has been in the White House, 
the price of gas went up. 
Meanwhile, 
Vladimir 
Putin 
was 
laughing all the way to the bank. 
Joe Biden must be patting himself on 
the back right now about banning Rus-
sian oil, something that took him 
kicking and screaming to do after bi-
partisan Members of the House and the 
Senate came together and said: You 
have got to stop doing this. 
It took him a couple of extra weeks 
to come to the realization that this 
body and the House, in a bipartisan 
way, were opposed to the delays—the 
ongoing delays—of this administration. 
Now Joe Biden has his latest excuse 
for inflation. He said it is Vladimir 
Putin. The American people aren’t 
buying it. In record numbers, they are 
not buying what the President is try-
ing to sell. 
The American people haven’t forgot-
ten the past year. It has been a year of 
high prices. It has been a year of mis-
ery and pain for families all across the 
country. 
For Joe Biden, it has been a year of 
excuses. The excuses keep changing, 
but they are ongoing. 
First, he said that inflation was tran-
sitory. He said it month after month 
after month after month. 
And, then, remember when he said 
inflation was a good thing? Then, of 
course, he blamed corporate greed—al-
ways looking for somebody else to 
blame, always trying to pass the buck. 
Now he says inflation, which has been 
crushing American families, was be-
cause of Vladimir Putin, just 3 weeks 
ago. 
Mr. President, people have been suf-
fering under inflation, and their wages 
haven’t been keeping up with the rising 
prices in this country for well over a 
year, since you took office. People rec-
ognize that. They remember the pain 
and the suffering in trying to go 
through Christmas, trying to decide 
whether they could afford gifts for the 
family; families who had to decide, liv-
ing on a fixed income, if they could af-
ford to eat or to heat their homes. 
That was all before Putin, and they 
haven’t forgotten, Mr. President. Even 
though you may not think they re-
member, they do. 
It is now 8 months until there are 
elections, and I know we are going to 
hear a lot more excuses from the 
Democrats in Washington between now 
and November 8. I expect the excuses 
are going to change a couple more 
times. None of the excuses are going to 
be believable. So they will keep trying 
to come up with another one. 
Inflation sure wasn’t transitory, not 
for a full year, not to a point where we 
are now at a 40-year high for inflation. 
How about that idea when the Presi-
dent said inflation was a good thing? 
Actually, we heard it from the White 
House Press Secretary. We heard it 
from the White House Chief of Staff. 
They said inflation is a sign of high de-
mand. 
If our economy is doing so well, why 
don’t the American people believe it? 
What kind of fantasyland is the Presi-
dent living in? 
According to the Washington Post, 
Joe Biden’s approval rating on the 
economy—how well he is doing in the 
economy—out of 100 points, he is at 37 
percent approval. These are record-low 
numbers. 
So Democrats can use their argu-
ments all that they want. I think it 
just makes Americans want to reject 
anything the Democrats are trying to 
sell. 
If Democrats are right about cor-
porate greed, then, why have Demo-
crats done nothing about it? They have 
run Washington for the past full year 
plus a couple of months. Democrats 
have had the time to introduce plenty 
of bills: bills to raise taxes, bills to 
take over elections, bills to pack the 
Supreme Court from 9 up to 13 mem-
bers, bills to make Washington, DC, a 
State. What can they point to as an ac-
complishment to actually address and 
lower inflation? That is what the 
American people want. 
Just this past weekend, studies are 
out. What is the No. 1 concern of the 
American people? It is inflation. What 
are Democrats doing about it? Nothing. 
They are making it worse. 
So we are living in this world where 
Democrats and the White House con-
tinue to spin one story after another, 
and Democrat spokesmen for the party 
continue to try to convince the Amer-
ican people: Don’t believe your own 
two eyes; believe them. The American 
people are smarter than that. 
Russia invaded Ukraine on February 
24, 2022. It is about a year after the in-
flation crisis began. It is a great 
human 
tragedy, 
and 
it 
is 
heart-
breaking. 
Tomorrow, Members of this body will 
be having a video address by President 
Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, a 
heroic and courageous individual who 
is leading his nation with stubborn 
courage, historic patriotism, fighting 
for freedom. To try to tie this to the 
inflation that the American people 
have been suffering through for the 
last year is just wrong. 
And 2021 was the worst inflation in 40 
years, 
long 
before 
Putin 
invaded 
Ukraine. By the time Putin invaded 
Ukraine, gas prices were up in the 
United States more than $1 a gallon, 
and America was more addicted to Rus-
sian oil because that is what Joe Biden 
wanted. He wanted us to need more 
Russian oil. But that didn’t stop Joe 
Biden from trying to blame the whole 
thing on Putin. 
Former adviser Steve Rattner put it 
this way: 
This is [Joe] Biden’s inflation and he needs 
to own it. 
Over the weekend, Larry Summers 
said this:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1169 
March 15, 2022 
The president was wrong— 
He is talking about Joe Biden. 
He said: 
The president was wrong to blame this 
month’s [inflation] number on [the war in] 
Ukraine. 
Larry Summers went on to say: 
[Everyone] had been expecting, from the 
time before Putin launched the invasion, 
that inflation was going to accelerate. 
He went on to say: 
This is a consequence, fundamentally, of 
an overheated economy. 
He said: 
And we are not going to have a full solu-
tion until we do something about that over-
heated economy. 
A full year has passed—one year in 
office, a 40-year high of inflation, and a 
year full of excuses by a President 
whose excuses do not add up. What 
adds up is the fundamental fact that 
American families spent $1,000 more on 
energy during Joe Biden’s first year as 
President than they did the previous 
year. And it is going to be worse this 
year. 
The time for excuses is over. There is 
no excuse for restricting American en-
ergy production. Democratic Senators 
spent 10 months denying that there 
even was inflation and doing nothing 
about it. Yet now some Democrats in 
this body are talking about making it 
even worse. They have introduced mul-
tiple bills to raise taxes. Astonishingly, 
one of the bills they have introduced is 
to raise taxes on American energy. 
They already tried that last year 
with their reckless tax-and-spending 
spree. Now, it seems like some of them 
want to do it again. If we put more 
taxes on American energy, what is that 
going to do? It is going to raise the 
price even higher. Higher costs on pro-
ducers are going to become higher 
costs on the customers. 
People don’t want us to raise costs; 
they want us to reduce costs. That is 
what they are complaining about. That 
is what we have gotten as a result of 
the Biden policies. We need to break 
this choke hold that the Democrats 
and the Biden administration have on 
American energy. 
So how do we do that? Well, 2 weeks 
ago, I led a letter with every Repub-
lican on the Senate Energy Committee, 
and we sent it to President Biden on 
the morning after the State of the 
Union Address. We gave him a list of 10 
specific actions that he could take 
today to produce more American en-
ergy and bring down the costs for 
American families. 
Step one would be to end his Execu-
tive order on oil and gas leases on Fed-
eral lands. Half of my home State of 
Wyoming is Federal lands. There is an 
abundance of energy there. The Amer-
ican people need it. It will help reduce 
costs for families. It will actually bring 
tax revenue into the government, both 
the State as well as the Federal Gov-
ernment. Yet Joe Biden is not inter-
ested. 
Joe Biden’s Executive order has no 
basis in science, no basis in law. It 
needs to be rescinded today. The fact 
that some people have leases to explore 
for energy—a small number—is no ex-
cuse for the President’s actions. Over 
4,000 leases are awaiting permission to 
drill right now. They have a lease, but 
they are tied up in redtape and cannot 
get permission to drill from the gov-
ernment. So even if you have a lease, 
you need to then get permission from 
the government to use the lease. They 
ought to approve those leases today. 
But we need to go further. We need a 
long-term commitment from the Gov-
ernment 
of 
the 
United 
States 
to 
produce 
American 
energy 
to 
help 
American families. Leases take years 
to explore and to develop. We need a 
commitment that is going to last long 
term. No one is going to make those 
kinds of investments if they think Joe 
Biden is going to shut them down again 
the next day. 
Now, American energy companies 
have a lot of good reasons not to trust 
Joe Biden, not to trust those whom he 
has—the anointed ones whom he has 
appointed to high positions in the gov-
ernment. 
If you just take a look at Joe Biden’s 
nominees, they are a murderer’s row of 
climate elitists and climate alarmists, 
and those are the ones that call the 
tune for this President. 
If you took a year of Joe Biden’s en-
ergy policies and take a look at what 
has happened over the past year that 
got us here today and you explain that 
to the American public and you say: 
What do you think about this? as they 
are filling up their tank, two-thirds of 
them would say: Under these Biden 
policies—two-thirds 
would 
say—the 
country is heading in the wrong direc-
tion. 
That may be every Republican. It is 
also a lot of Independents, and it is 
also some Democrats as well who have 
buyer’s remorse at what they have got-
ten from this President. It is going to 
take time to repair the damage. We 
need to start today. The time for ex-
cuses and blame from this administra-
tion needs to be over. The American 
public is demanding American energy, 
and we need it now. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
IDITAROD 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I am here on the floor today to make 
what I consider to be a supercool an-
nouncement. I think my colleagues 
know well that I am a fan of the ‘‘Last 
Great Race,’’ the Iditarod. I am shame-
less in my promotion of not only the 
exceptional athleticism of the mushers 
themselves but the canine athletes. 
I say to the Presiding Officer—and as 
an athlete yourself—I think you can 
appreciate the endurance training that 
it takes to be a qualified and truly an 
exceptional athlete, and today we are 
able to celebrate an extraordinary 
musher and an extraordinary team. 
It was just a little over a week ago, 
last Sunday morning—well, actually it 
was Saturday—that I was in Anchorage 
for 
the 
ceremonial 
start 
of 
the 
Iditarod. It takes place downtown in 
Anchorage. We have to truck snow in. 
We close off all the downtown streets. 
Not too many cities actually bring the 
snow in, but we brought the snow in, 
dumped it around the streets, and 
closed the streets. 
Mushers come to town from all over 
the State, 49 mushers this year. They 
bring their sled dogs in. 
Along the sides of the chutes are 
thousands of Alaskans and thousands 
of visitors. The people come from 
around the country and around the 
world to launch these extraordinary 
teams down the street. Everybody is 
all bundled up. 
It was one of those days that was just 
picture perfect for the start of an 
Iditarod. There were big, huge snow-
flakes coming down, making every-
thing white. 
The dogs were jumping in their 
traces, just straight up, just bouncing 
up with excitement, and the yipping 
and the howling was just—it was ex-
citement that was contagious. And to 
be out there in the chutes, wishing the 
racers luck, cheering them on before 
they embark on their 1,000-mile jour-
ney to the north, it is an experience 
that I would encourage for anyone, 
whether you are a canine lover or not— 
those of you who understand the value 
of working dogs and what they mean, 
and how they love to do what they do. 
The Iditarod is an experience like 
none other. This was the 50th anniver-
sary. For 50 years now, the Iditarod has 
been going from South Central in the 
Willow area all the way up to Nome. 
Again, 49 teams entered. 
These mushers faced some pretty 
challenging conditions. You are going 
over terrain that is mountain range 
and down into gorges. You are on flat 
glare ice going across Norton Sound, 
howling winds, driving snow. It is a 
mental task. It is a physical task and, 
truly, one of endurance. 
Keep in mind that most are thinking: 
Wait. This is Alaska in the wintertime. 
It is cold. 
But, in fairness, the teams actually 
prefer to be running at night, when the 
temperatures are cool. So they are run-
ning truly based on the dogs’ schedule, 
the endurance, but not necessarily in 
the tamest of conditions. 
This is not only a race where we cele-
brate the musher and their team, but 
we also celebrate the volunteer spirit 
that comes with this. This is an ex-
traordinary race of over 1,000 miles 
going through some of the most ex-
treme wilderness that you will encoun-
ter. 
Then, occasionally, along the way, 
there are small villages that are used

as checkpoints or opportunities for the 
many volunteers to basically gather. 
There is about 1,500 people who volun-
teer to put this race on. So for those 
who set the trail markers, who set out 
there with their snow machines to 
mark that trail, it is nothing more 
than like wood markers that you would 
get at Home Depot or Lowe’s, with a 
little painted orange on it. That is the 
sophistication of this. This is what 
guides the team in a blizzard. 
The veterinarians are there. Four to 
five vets cycle through each check-
point, because each dog needs to be 
checked every time they go through 
their checkpoint. 
All of these folks come from all 
around the country to volunteer. They 
pay for their flights up. They take a 
week off work, and they are there. 
They are there to support not only the 
race, but they are there to support 
gold-standard canine care. 
And so it is also a celebration about 
the volunteers. This is such a great 
part of our State’s heritage, our cul-
ture. Again, you can tell I get a little 
enthusiastic about it. Even my neck-
lace is a dog sled with a musher on it. 
So this is the time of year that I like 
to celebrate it. 
So this morning at 5:39 a.m., Alaska 
standard time—so about 9:30 here in 
DC—8 days, 14 hours, 38 minutes since 
beginning a roughly 1,000-mile race, 
Brent Sass and his team of 11 dogs 
crossed the finish line. 
So here is Brent with his two dogs, 
yellow roses flown in from—I don’t 
know where those yellow roses came 
from, but they certainly weren’t from 
Nome, AK. 
But that man has traveled with his 
team for 8 days now, 14 hours, 38 min-
utes to win the 50th Iditarod. 
I had a chance to talk to Brent by 
phone just about an hour after he went 
in to Nome. He sounded pretty vibrant, 
pretty excited, pretty happy. 
I had talked to him in the starting 
gate on Saturday, and I said: Brent, I 
think this is your time. I think this is 
your time because you have proved 
yourself year over year in the Iditarod 
and certainly in the Yukon Quest. 
Brent lives in Eureka, AK, on a 
homestead that was established back 
in the 1970s. He is a pretty seasoned 
musher. He took part in his first 
Iditarod back in 2012. He got ‘‘Rookie 
of the Year’’ that year. He is a three- 
time 1,000-mile Yukon Quest champion. 
So the Yukon Quest runs a different 
race, from Canada into Alaska. It is 
also a 1000-mile race. It is equally ardu-
ous and extraordinarily difficult. He 
took first place in the Yukon Quest in 
2015, 2019, 2020, and also first in this 
year’s 
abbreviated 
350-mile 
Yukon 
Quest. 
So a couple little quick stories here, 
because I know I don’t have much 
time, but this guy is pretty excep-
tional. He is not only a strong compet-
itor, but the care that he provides his 
dogs is amazing. 
One story from 2016: Brent was get-
ting ready to leave the White Mountain 
checkpoint. It is about 77 miles from 
the finish line in Nome. He was teed up 
here to win third place, and depending 
on where you are in the rank is how 
much of the purse you will take home. 
And if he was going to make third, it 
was going to be about $44,000 in prize 
money. But he is getting ready to leave 
the checkpoint and his dogs said: Nope, 
we are not moving. 
So think about it. You are that close 
to $44,000. You are 77 miles from the 
finish, and your dogs have said: This 
has been a long trek, and this is where 
we are stopping to just rest. 
So Brent Sass didn’t push those dogs. 
He waited as they rested, and when 
they were ready, he took it slow, he 
took it steady, he brought them to the 
finish line, and he ended up placing 
20th instead of 3rd. And he did that for 
his team. 
And for that, he was recognized twice 
with the Vet’s Choice Award for the 
care that he shows his dogs. 
But it is not just his team that Brent 
is known for taking care of. He is also 
known for taking care of his competi-
tors along the trail. 
There was a headline a few years 
back that said ‘‘Sass to the Rescue . . . 
Again.’’ 
And time after time, Brent has been 
highlighted for acts of heroism on the 
trail. In vicious storms, he has helped 
mushers and their dog teams reunite 
after becoming separated on the trail. 
And keep in mind, there is no rescue 
team out there. It is you, and if you are 
lucky enough to have somebody else 
come upon you—fortunate. 
But during one race, a fellow musher 
was at risk for scratching the race, and 
instead of leaving him behind, as many 
competitors might have done, Brent 
helped him scale Eagle Summit so he 
could stay in the race. 
But one of the most notable rescues 
took place in 2011 on the trail of the 
Yukon Quest. Hans Gatt, a four-time 
champion, was stalled out. He wasn’t 
able to clear the summit. The weather 
conditions were awful. So Hans did the 
only thing that he could do, which is to 
hunker down into a sleeping bag in 
these horrible winds, the driving cold 
snow. 
Brent’s sled comes upon Hans, sees 
that he is on the verge of hypothermia. 
He hooks his sled to the back of his 
own, and he hauls both teams up over 
the summit. And Brent credits his 
then-lead dog Silver for guiding them 
to safety in these awful and harsh con-
ditions. As a result of their teamwork 
and heroism, the Quest created the Sil-
ver Legacy Award in Silver’s honor. 
Brent claims that to be one of the 
proudest moments of his life. 
I wish that I could have been there 
this morning at 5:39 in Nome to watch 
Brent cross the finish line as a first- 
time Iditarod champ with his team. 
But even from afar, we can hear the 
Alaskans celebrating Brent for his in-
credible feat. 
So to Brent Sass, we celebrate you. 
We thank you for the care that you 
show your dog team, your character, 
how you show what it means to be a 
true competitor and for representing 
the great State of Alaska so well. 
And to all the others that are still on 
the trail, we wish you well and safety 
and Godspeed. 
I yield the floor. 
NOMINATION OF SHALANDA D. YOUNG 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to support the historic nomination 
of Shalanda Young to be the next Di-
rector of the Office of Management and 
Budget. Ms. Young brings deep experi-
ence with the Federal budget process 
to her role at OMB, having served as 
staff director of the House Committee 
on Appropriations. She has been serv-
ing as Acting Director of OMB for the 
past year, and her top-notch perform-
ance in that role leaves no doubt that 
she is eminently qualified to be con-
firmed as OMB Director. 
Ms. Young came into OMB in March 
2021, the same month that Congress 
passed the American Rescue Plan. This 
was a time when the Nation faced an 
uncertain future, with coronavirus vac-
cines just starting to go out and unem-
ployment remaining stubbornly high at 
6 percent. Under Ms. Young’s leader-
ship, OMB played a key role to imple-
ment the American Rescue Plan to 
fight the pandemic and move our econ-
omy forward. The results have been 
widespread vaccinations, millions of 
new jobs, unemployment falling to 3.8 
percent, and the fastest economic 
growth in nearly 40 years. 
We have achieved a great deal during 
the first year of the Biden administra-
tion, but we must recognize that there 
is still so much left to accomplish. 
Shalanda Young is the right person to 
have at the helm of OMB to craft re-
sponsible budgets and turn the policies 
we craft into actions that make a real 
difference for the American people. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 2 min-
utes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of Shalanda Young’s nomina-
tion to be Director of the Office of 
Management and Budget. 
Ms. Young has done an exemplary job 
serving as OMB’s Acting Director for 
the past year. She is a dedicated public 
servant and a proven leader. 
She has played a key role in the ad-
ministration’s efforts to help the Na-
tion recover from the pandemic. She 
has worked closely with Congress to 
pass the historic bipartisan infrastruc-
ture package, and she is truly com-
mitted to making the Federal Govern-
ment work better for the American 
people. 
I have absolutely no doubt that Ms. 
Young is the right choice to lead the 
OMB going forward. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in voting to confirm 
Shalanda Young to be the Director of 
OMB.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL 
DISAPPROVAL UNDER CHAPTER 
8 OF TITLE 5, UNITED STATES 
CODE, OF THE RULE SUBMITTED 
BY CENTERS FOR DISEASE CON-
TROL AND PREVENTION RELAT-
ING 
TO 
‘‘REQUIREMENT 
FOR 
PERSONS 
TO 
WEAR 
MASKS 
WHILE ON CONVEYANCES AND 
AT TRANSPORTATION HUBS’’ 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume legislative session and proceed to 
the consideration of S.J. Res. 37, which 
the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 37) providing 
for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 
of title 5, United States Code, of the rule 
submitted by Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention relating to ‘‘Requirement for 
Persons To Wear Masks While on Convey-
ances and at Transportation Hubs’’. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise in 
opposition to S.J. Res. 37, which we are 
now considering and which we will vote 
on at 5:30. 
This is a resolution that would use 
the CRA process to undo the CDC guid-
ance requiring use of masks on trans-
portation: planes, buses, trains, and 
some transportation hubs. 
I think this is an issue that should be 
discussed, and, possibly, to use a med-
ical metaphor, a scalpel should be used 
to make it just right. Unfortunately, 
the CRA process is a meat cleaver, and 
this is not the kind of thing we should 
be using a meat cleaver against. 
If S.J. Res. 37 passes, it could lead us 
to be extremely vulnerable if there 
were a resurge in coronavirus cases, as 
we are seeing in other nations like Ger-
many. 
Let me explain. The CDC imposed a 
mandate to wear masks on transpor-
tation in February of 2021—again, 
planes, buses, trains, and train and bus 
stations, as well as airports. 
We all know that the CDC has re-
cently 
examined 
the 
caseload 
of 
COVID–19 in the country and dropped 
their mask recommendations for most 
of the Nation. About 98 percent of the 
American population now live in com-
munities where there is no mask rec-
ommendation, 
thank 
goodness—not 
even indoors. That is great. 
But in some parts of the country, 
some parts of my Commonwealth, in-
fection rates are still so high that the 
mask recommendation for wearing in-
doors is still one that the CDC strongly 
recommends. 
The CDC mandate, with respect to 
masks on transportation, was set to ex-
pire on March 18, Friday. On Friday, 
March 18, it was set to expire. After the 
CDC 
dropped 
the 
recommendation 
about wearing masks indoors, the CDC 
decided to extend the mask require-
ment on transportation for 1 month, 
from March 18 to April 18. 
Why did they do that when they were 
dropping the mask recommendation in-
doors for much of the country? Well, 
the reason was pretty obvious, and 
they explained it. 
Here is the problem with transpor-
tation: You might board a bus, plane, 
or train in an area with low infection 
but pass through areas of high infec-
tion and end up in an area of high in-
fection. So transportation is a little bit 
different than what should the rules be 
in an indoor venue in my hometown of 
Richmond or in communities in Con-
necticut, where the Presiding Officer 
lives. 
So what the CDC said is, we are going 
to take an additional month, and we 
are going to analyze the science around 
closed spaces—transportation venues— 
and we are going to look at this issue 
of traveling from one community to 
another, and then we will come up with 
a best recommendation and best guid-
ance with respect to mask mandates in 
transportation. That sounds very rea-
sonable to me, very reasonable to ex-
tend 
the 
mask 
requirement 
by 
1 
month. 
I would argue to my colleague Sen-
ator PAUL—this is his resolution—we 
should be weighing in with the CDC 
and giving them best guidance—and, 
obviously, they are considering what 
science is recommending; they are in 
dialogue with the transportation indus-
try that has strong feelings about 
that—and then seeing what guidance 
the CDC comes up with in April before 
the April 18 deadline, to which they 
have extended. 
That would be reasonable, but what 
this resolution does is not reasonable. 
It not only wipes out the mask require-
ment; it wipes it out forever. It states 
that the CDC no longer will have the 
authority to impose a mask require-
ment in transportation unless or until 
this body passes new legislation allow-
ing them to do so. 
That legislation in the Senate would 
require 60 votes. I would venture to 
argue that there is no way, in the 
politicization of COVID, that a piece of 
legislation giving the CDC the power to 
do mask mandates in transportation 
would get 60 votes in this Chamber. 
So if S.J. Res. 37 passes, we will have 
taken away from our premier health 
authorization the ability to impose a 
mask mandate if it is necessary. 
Now, I pray that it is not necessary. 
I am happy to see the reduction in 
COVID caseloads in Virginia and across 
much of the Nation. But there are 
parts of Virginia where the caseloads 
are still high and where masks are still 
recommended. And there are parts of 
every one of our States or Common-
wealths where the infection rates are 
still high, and masks are still rec-
ommended. 
So it is fine to wish that COVID is 
going away. I mean, Lord, do we all 
wish that it is going away, but we 
know that in some parts of the country 
it isn’t. And we also know, if we are 
looking at the data internationally, 
that China is experiencing a significant 
upsurge; Germany is experiencing a 
significant upsurge. 
So what if—what if—we face a new 
COVID variant that starts to wreak 
havoc on us, just as Delta did when we 
thought we were in a decline, just like 
Omicron did when we thought we were 
in a decline? What if there is a new var-
iant that comes and starts to wreak 
havoc more broadly across the coun-
try? Wouldn’t we want the CDC to have 
the power immediately, upon an up-
surge of COVID nationally, to impose a 
mask requirement on transportation? 
If S.J. Res. 37 passes, they will not 
have the ability to do that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1172 
March 15, 2022 
And what might be the consequences 
of that? The consequences could be 
very severe in terms of people’s health. 
We know that. We have experienced 
now close to a million deaths to 
COVID. But it also could have severe 
economic consequences. 
Our transportation infrastructure— 
public transit and buses and trains and 
planes—is a critical backbone of the 
American economy, which is now start-
ing to grow and add jobs, thank good-
ness. But if COVID hits again, and CDC 
does not have power to impose a mask 
mandate, many people who use trans-
portation to get to work or to travel to 
places where they can do their work 
will no longer feel confident in their 
ability to do so. Many employees who 
work in the transportation sector will 
worry about being exposed to rising 
COVID case levels and may choose not 
to work. 
So 
the 
consequences 
of 
another 
COVID surge in this country are not 
only health consequences, but they are 
critical potential consequences to our 
economy at a time, after 2 years, when, 
finally, we are seeing some significant 
GDP growth and job growth and wage 
and salary growth. 
So I would urge my colleagues, don’t 
use a meat cleaver, when this mask 
mandate is set to expire on April 18. It 
is barely more than a month away. 
Don’t use the meat cleaver to bar the 
CDC from taking necessary public 
health action should there be a resur-
gence in COVID. Instead, let’s work 
with the CDC and see what guidance 
they come up with for this April 18 
deadline. That would be much better 
for our public health and much better 
for our economy. 
So for those reasons, I would urge my 
colleagues 
strongly 
to 
stand 
with 
smart economic policy and wise public 
health policy and not eliminate the 
ability of the Nation’s premier public 
health Agency from imposing a trans-
portation mask requirement should 
public health demand it. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, there is a 
very distinct possibility that the mask 
mandates saved no lives. There is a 
very distinct possibility that the mask 
mandates did not change the trajectory 
or incidence of the coronavirus pan-
demic. In fact, there is a distinct possi-
bility that mask mandates were simply 
coercive security theater that did not 
enhance the public safety at all. 
While the efficacy of masks is debat-
able, the question of whether or not 
the Federal Government possesses the 
power to mandate that you wear a 
mask 
is 
not 
debatable. 
The 
10th 
Amendment clearly states that powers 
not specifically enumerated by the 
Constitution for the Federal Govern-
ment are retained by the States and 
the people respectively. 
In United States v. Lopez, the 10th 
Amendment is affirmed. The Supreme 
Court ruled that the Constitution with-
holds from Congress the plenary power 
that would authorize enactment of 
every type of legislation. The Supreme 
Court went on to say that allowing the 
Federal Government a general police 
power of the sort retained by the 
States would violate the principle that 
the Federal Government is one of enu-
merated and limited powers. 
Furthermore, no statute exists that 
remotely conveys a power to mandate 
masks to any Department of the Fed-
eral Government. Yet, since March of 
2020, unelected bureaucrats from the 
Centers for Disease Control have inces-
santly declared that we should ‘‘follow 
the science’’ and submit to their man-
dates. But those bureaucrats defy 
science and practice something closer 
to sorcery. 
For 2 years, they have incanted the 
magic word ‘‘emergency,’’ which they 
believe conjures up special powers that 
require each one of us to wear face 
masks they tell us have talismanic 
qualities. The only problem with this 
assertion is that none of it is true. The 
CDC does not have limitless authority 
during emergencies, and masks are not 
effective at preventing the spread of 
COVID–19. 
This, after all, is the same Agency 
that decided merely by uttering the 
word ‘‘emergency’’ that it empowered 
itself to tear up every rental contract 
in America. Fortunately, the Supreme 
Court put the CDC in its place, saying 
that it ‘‘imposed a nationwide morato-
rium on evictions in reliance on a dec-
ades-old statute that authorizes it to 
implement measures like fumigation 
and pest extermination. It strains cre-
dulity to believe that this statute 
grants the CDC the sweeping authority 
that it asserts.’’ 
But the CDC has yet to learn its les-
son. For a third time, the CDC ex-
tended the mandate, forcing everyone 
wishing to exercise their right to trav-
el to wear a mask. The mask, to the 
CDC, is effectively a passport. Those 
who work for airlines are compelled to 
incessantly remind paying customers 
not only to wear a mask while we 
board but in between bites and in be-
tween sips. ‘‘Sir, please put your mask 
on in between peanuts. Sir, after each 
peanut, please put your mask on.’’ The 
absurdity. 
Is it any wonder that the Federal 
Aviation Administration has logged a 
surge in reports of bad passenger be-
havior? According to the FAA, nearly 
two-thirds of the more than 800 reports 
of unruly passengers this year have 
been related to masks. Thus, the CDC’s 
mandate is a safety risk to airline em-
ployees and passengers alike. 
The populace, which has been pushed 
around too far for too long, no longer 
sees a flight attendant entrusted to 
make travel more comfortable but, 
rather, a border guard who polices the 
unfriendly skies. And who can blame 
them when the head of Delta Airlines 
wants to put the names of vocal oppo-
nents of mask mandates on a no-fly 
list, a place we had supposedly reserved 
for those suspected of terrorism? 
Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised 
that, as all 50 States either dropped or 
plan to drop the mask mandates, the 
CDC stubbornly perpetuates its man-
dates. 
The history of the last 2 years is a 
history 
of 
the 
CDC 
making 
rec-
ommendations despite the evidence, 
not because of it. From the beginning, 
the CDC has ignored the scientific data 
that demonstrated the ineffectiveness 
of masks. 
At the beginning of the pandemic, 
Dr. Fauci advised Americans to refrain 
from wearing masks, but as we were so 
often told, the science has changed— 
except that it really hasn’t. At least 30 
studies demonstrate that masks have 
little to no impact on transmission, in-
cluding those that predate the emer-
gence of COVID, which highlight the 
lack of effectiveness of masks outside 
the hospital setting. 
In May 2020, an article by researchers 
at Harvard Medical School published in 
the New England Journal of Medicine 
not only held that ‘‘wearing a mask 
outside health care facilities offers lit-
tle, if any, protection from infection’’ 
but that one of its few useful functions 
would be to serve as a reminder of 
‘‘other infection-control measures.’’ 
The article went so far as to state 
that masks are not only tools but they 
are also talismans that may help in-
crease healthcare workers’ perceived 
sense of safety. In other words, the 
masks are a placebo. They might not 
do anything, but at least they can 
trick people into thinking they are 
protected. 
Unfortunately for those who support 
mask mandates, the article went on to 
warn 
that 
‘‘focusing 
on 
universal 
masking 
alone 
may, 
paradoxically, 
lead to more transmission of COVID–19 
if it diverts attention from imple-
menting more fundamental infection- 
control measures.’’ 
Translation: The mere symbolic ben-
efit of universal masking comes with 
the cost of a false sense of security, 
which potentially risks further spread. 
For example, imagine the 80-year-old 
husband who chooses to wear a cloth 
mask to take care of his COVID-strick-
en wife. The CDC has prompted him to 
believe that wearing a cloth mask will 
keep him safe, when in reality this 
misinformation has prompted him to 
engage in risky behavior. 
Among the reasons why masks have 
such poor results outside a hospital is 
user error. About a year after the ini-
tial reports of COVID cases, a large 
controlled study of about 8,000 partici-
pants was published by the Public Li-
brary of Science. That study found 
that face masks ‘‘did not seem to be ef-
fective against laboratory-confirmed 
viral respiratory infections nor against 
clinical respiratory infection,’’ which 
was likely due to poor adherence to the 
protocol. 
People simply cannot replicate the 
hospital setting at all times, in all lo-
cations. Even N95 masks cannot help a 
person who does not know how to use

it. Multiple studies show surgical and 
cloth masks are not effective in reduc-
ing transmission. 
In November 2020, a Danish study 
published in the Annals of Internal 
Medicine found that high-quality sur-
gical masks failed to demonstrate sig-
nificant reductions in confirmed viral 
transmissions. This is a large study. 
This is a randomized controlled study 
in Denmark with thousands of people 
who wore masks and thousands of peo-
ple who didn’t wear masks. And—guess 
what—they had the same incidence of 
disease. 
Additionally, a randomized trial in 
Bangladesh found that cloth masks did 
not have a statistically significant ef-
fect on COVID transmission. 
But we should not be surprised by 
these results because we have known 
the limitations of masks for a long 
time. A 2015 Vietnamese study of 1,600 
participants found that cloth masks al-
lowed 97 percent penetration of par-
ticles. They took sodium chloride par-
ticles the same size as a virus, and they 
blew them through a cloth mask, and 
they got 97 percent of the particles on 
the other side of the mask. They didn’t 
work. 
A 2019 study from Nepal found that 
the pore size of the cloth mask—the 
opening that air goes through in the 
cloth mask, the pore size—ranged from 
80 to 105 micrometers, but the size of 
the COVID particle is only 0.12 mi-
crometers. That means that the pores 
in the cloth masks are more than 650 
times as big as the COVID particles. 
Science. 
If the virus is 650 times smaller than 
the pore, it is not going to work. 
Wearing a mask to stop COVID is 
like trying to catch flies with a chain 
link fence. The virus can simply travel 
right through and around the mask. 
And what was Dr. Fauci’s prescrip-
tion, after studying and concluding 
that masks were ineffective? Wear two 
masks. He is wearing masks all over 
his face. Just another one. If only we 
had four masks, maybe we would be 
safe. That is not science; that is the-
ater. 
The CDC announced that it would 
look into two masks, but we never 
heard back from them. A few days 
later, even Fauci conceded there is no 
evidence that double masking is going 
to make a difference. I guess he was 
just wearing it for style. 
Actually, there is data even on dou-
ble masking, just not the kind likely to 
be approved by Dr. Fauci. A study pub-
lished in the New England Journal of 
Medicine in late 2020 monitored nearly 
2,000 marine recruits who were sub-
jected to anti-infection measures, in-
cluding double masking. 
What did it find? It found several 
incidences of COVID still being trans-
mitted despite the double masks. Yet 
our President, our Governors, and our 
mayors routinely lectured us to ‘‘just 
wear the damn mask.’’ Now, 2 years 
later, what benefits did we get from all 
that masking? Not a damn thing. 
A 2021 study published in the Inter-
national Research Journal of Public 
Health found that there was no asso-
ciation between mask mandates im-
posed by the respective States and re-
duced spread of COVID–19. The study 
verifies what we have seen in the real 
world. 
If you look at mask mandates that 
were put on State by State or country 
by country and you compare that to 
the incidence of the disease, there is no 
relation. In fact, often the relation is 
inverse. 
Here you have California and Florida. 
In Florida, if you have been down 
there—look, even AOC goes to Florida 
because they won’t make you wear a 
mask. You can do what you want. No-
body has been wearing a mask for 2 
years in Florida. California: If you are 
paddle boarding by yourself, they will 
send the Coast Guard after you. If you 
are jogging on the beach in California 
by yourself, they will arrest you. 
Wildly different mandates, yet this is 
the infection curve for California and 
Florida. It is the same. Death curves, 
infection curves, there is no evidence 
that any State mandate changed any-
thing. In fact, if your objective—at the 
end of this pandemic, people are going 
to discover—I don’t know if they will 
ever admit this—that the truth of the 
matter is nothing that man did other 
than the vaccine and natural infection, 
accumulated immunity from both nat-
ural and from vaccine sources, slowed 
this down, as well as the mutation of 
the virus. 
Plexiglass—give me a break. You 
think the virus doesn’t go in and 
around your plexiglass? We spend mil-
lions of dollars on stickers: Stand 6 
feet apart. You are on the plane 2 
inches from people for 2 hours, and 
then what do they say? 
Please, as you exit the plane, we are going 
to practice social distancing. 
And you can stand 6 feet away from 
the person you have been 2 inches from 
for the last 6 hours. 
It is ‘‘Moronville.’’ It is medieval. 
They knew more about infectious dis-
ease in the medieval ages than they do 
in today’s modern age with the govern-
ment directing this. 
But despite very different mask poli-
cies, California and Florida ended up 
with about the identical outcome. 
Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University 
School of Public Health, who provided 
one of these charts on Twitter, noted 
that the infection rates for California, 
which had a mask mandate, and Flor-
ida, which did not, have ‘‘strikingly 
similar’’ infection rates—specifically, 
9.5 percent for Florida, 9.54 percent for 
the draconian mandates of California. 
They were the same. One place had no 
freedom; one place had their freedom— 
and the rate of disease was the same. 
Is nobody willing to really look at 
the science? Are we willing to submit 
to wearing masks forever? 
As journalist Jacob Sullum pointed 
out, if you compare California to 
Texas, another populous State that had 
no mask mandates, the case trends also 
are very similar. The same basic pat-
tern was discovered in almost every 
State. In short, States with mask man-
dates fared no better than States with-
out them. 
Unsurprisingly, nationwide, masks 
did not prevent transmission or even 
death. This is a chart looking at the 
death rate and with the mask man-
dates. So the dotted line is the mask 
mandate. Oh, my goodness, we put a 
mask mandate on, and many more peo-
ple began to die. Did the masks cause 
death? No. They just are unrelated. 
But if you are trying to prove that a 
mask mandate lessened death, there is 
no evidence of it. Death went up and 
then down and then up and down again. 
The trends on death, the trends on 
incidence have nothing to do with 
plexiglass; they have nothing to do 
with stickers; they have nothing to do 
with masks. Yet we did all of these 
things in medieval fashion. 
In the 14th century, the Pope burned 
incense. They thought they could pro-
tect themselves from plague. People 
wore garlic around their neck, even up 
to World War I. It didn’t work; except 
the garlic did probably scare some peo-
ple and keep them away from you. 
When 
the 
CDC 
reversed 
itself— 
again—in July 2021 and recommended 
that vaccinated people—who they said 
didn’t have to wear a mask—now had 
to wear a mask again, the death rate, 
which had been going down for months, 
sharply rose again. No relationship un-
less it is inverse—unless putting on the 
mask caused the death rate to get 
worse, there is no relationship between 
mask mandates and lessening the inci-
dence or lessening death. This is, sadly, 
yet more evidence that masks do not 
prevent transmission of disease that, 
for some, proves deadly. 
It has distracted us. We have been 
distracted and actually comforted by 
something that is not working. And we 
have been tricked into engaging in 
risky behavior: wearing a mask think-
ing we are safe. With 80 percent of peo-
ple wearing a mask, most of them are 
still getting infected. They have been 
vaccinated, and they are wearing a 
mask and still getting infected. Maybe 
we ought to reassess. 
Despite all of this evidence, the CDC 
still cannot bring itself to end its trav-
el mandate. Is it any wonder why this 
Agency lost so much credibility over 
the last 2 years? They have lost their 
credibility because they have treated 
every American as if we all have the 
same level of COVID risk. 
Because of this approach, our chil-
dren have suffered the most from the 
CDC’s unscientific mandates. The CDC 
guidance on school masking is as ag-
gressive as it can get, recommending 
universal indoor masking by all stu-
dents aged 2 and older, staff, teachers, 
and visitors to K–12 schools—regardless 
of vaccination status. With the CDC 
calling the shots across the country, 
kids have not experienced a normal day 
of school for 2 years. Schoolchildren

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1174 
March 15, 2022 
have to wear masks all day, which re-
sults 
in 
complaints 
of 
difficulty 
breathing, headaches, acne, anxiety, 
and depression. 
And by covering the lower half of the 
face, we have robbed the students of ef-
fective visual communication. So pro-
found has been the change in our learn-
ing that we have now changed the defi-
nition for adequate number of words 
for children to know. It used to be 50 
for normal development; we changed it 
to 30 because they can’t see the faces 
to mimic people. For people who are 
hearing impaired, they have even more 
difficulty if they can’t see the lips. 
Here is really the big insult of in-
sults. We go to the State of the Union. 
Now, we have these elderly Senators 
and these elderly Congressmen, and, fi-
nally, they are free of their masks. 
They take their masks off, and your 4- 
year-old at home—the chance your 4- 
year-old dies of COVID is 1 in 2.32 mil-
lion. They are going to be struck by 
lightning before they get COVID and 
die—but these old guys are fine now. 
They are a thousand times more likely 
to die from COVID, but they are fine 
with no mask; but your 4-year-old has 
to wear a mask—no logic whatsoever in 
this, no science involved in this. But it 
is authoritarians run amuck. 
Sweden took a dramatically different 
approach. Swedish schools remained 
open for the majority of the pandemic 
and wore no masks—1.8 million kids, 
not one of them died. If you look at the 
incidence of the disease among teach-
ers—you say, ‘‘We have to put masks 
on the kids or the teachers will die.’’ 
In Sweden, no masks on the kids and 
the incidence of disease among the 
teachers is the same as every other 
profession in Sweden—no difference. 
There were lower death rates there 
than in the U.S. But the one thing the 
Swedes did not suffer is their test 
scores were not lower. Their test scores 
are up, and no one is concerned about 
the lost years of education or mental 
development. 
Mask mandates on planes don’t make 
any more sense than mask mandates in 
school. While testifying before the Sen-
ate Commerce Committee, Southwest 
CEO Gary Kelly said that 99.97 percent 
of airborne pathogens are captured by 
the airplane filtration system, and it is 
turned over every 2 to 3 minutes. I 
think the case is very strong that 
masks don’t add much, if anything, in 
the air cabin environment. 
This is from the CEO of Southwest. 
It is very safe and very high quality com-
pared to any other indoor setting. 
United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby 
added that, in fact, air quality on 
planes is safer than an ‘‘intensive care 
unit’’ and that sitting next to someone 
on a plane ‘‘is the equivalent of being 
15 feet away from them in a typical 
building.’’ 
It is not just airline CEOs who agree 
that mask mandates do not make 
sense. When discussing mask policy, 
even CNN, even the doctors on CNN— 
the radical disciples of Dr. Fauci—now 
admit that cloth masks are nothing 
more than facial decoration and the re-
sponsibility should shift from a govern-
ment mandate to an individual man-
date. When the leftwing doctors on 
CNN are getting it, really, you would 
think the CDC might wake up. Doctors, 
scientists, airline CEOs are all pre-
sented with the science, and those who 
are all truthful will tell you that the 
mask mandates are nothing more than 
COVID theater. 
But the mandates have been more 
like a curse. Think about what you 
have lost: Fathers were not there and 
allowed to see their babies born; moth-
ers have given birth to babies alone; 
our children have fallen behind in edu-
cation and mental development; wed-
dings were postponed and ceremonies 
were drastically scaled back; many of 
us were deprived of one final goodbye 
to a dying loved one. 
We are about to return to normal, 
and it can’t happen soon enough. We 
are about to get our lives back, to get 
our liberty, and our pursuit of happi-
ness back. But it won’t happen until we 
finally wake up and say the science 
doesn’t indicate this; until this body 
that supposedly represents the people 
votes to say: Enough is enough— 
enough of the theater, enough of the 
pseudoscience. Let’s let people make 
their own decisions. But the CDC says 
no. It has extended again the travel 
mandate. We have another month of 
this. 
But people are upset. I don’t care 
whether you are a Republican, a Demo-
crat, or an Independent. There are 
Democrat moms, Independent moms, 
Republican moms and dads frustrated 
at their 4-year-old, their 6-year-old 
going to school for a nonfatal disease— 
nonfatal to children. Meanwhile, elder-
ly Congressmen and Senators are now 
running around without their mask on, 
and they have no problem, but they are 
going to make your kid wear a mask. 
It makes no sense. 
Now is our chance to say, Enough is 
enough. We have it within our power 
today to assure the American people 
that we are irreversibly going back to 
normal. We can tell our constituents 
that the unscientific mask mandates 
are on the way out once and for all. For 
once, we can follow the science and put 
an end to the travel mask mandates. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, we 
finished up some three or four town-
halls this weekend, bringing us, I 
think, over nine. And I will tell you 
this, Americans know they are being 
lied to. They know the decisions com-
ing out of the White House and the 
CDC are politically driven. Let me tell 
you this for sure: Kansans are mad, and 
they are upset, and they know this lie 
is continuing, and their anger con-
tinues to grow. And at the end of every 
townhall, I can tell you, two or three 
people will grab me and say: Please, 
please keep fighting for our freedoms. 
This is what else they tell me. They 
tell me they don’t trust the CDC any-
more, that the CDC has lost their rep-
utation; and I am telling you, it will be 
difficult for them to ever get it back. 
Now, they are being told that we 
have to wear masks on airplanes for 
another month or so—another horrible 
decision coming from the White House, 
more ill advice from the CDC. And all 
the time we know that these masks— 
with these masks comes a psychosocial 
downfall, that it creates problems. But 
the CDC continues to lust for control— 
to control our lives and exert their 
control over us, over me, over our chil-
dren and our grandchildren. 
My concern is this: The CDC con-
tinues to make decisions as if they are 
in a vacuum without consideration of 
the big picture. 
Let’s just take a moment and talk 
about where we are today. Ninety-five 
percent of Americans have some level 
of immunity—95 percent. New infec-
tions are down 94 percent, hospitaliza-
tions down over 80 percent. As far as we 
know, there is no new variant of con-
cern anywhere in the world that is 
rearing its ugly head right now. 
What do we truly know about the 
science and the benefits of wearing a 
mask? What do you know about the 
risk of wearing a mask? Well, I asked 
the CDC that same question, I am sure, 
over a year ago now. I asked them for 
the studies that support their rec-
ommendation to wear masks—some 80 
studies. I looked at every one of them. 
I would say half of them weren’t worth 
the paper they were printed on—poor 
scientific 
quality, 
cherry-picking 
data—but most were still very incon-
clusive. 
A few suggested masks might help if 
they are worn perfectly, if it is the 
right type of mask. Some of the studies 
even said that masks were harmful. 
Now, I will acknowledge that in a 
perfect world that, for a brief period of 
time, wearing an N95 mask properly 
could theoretically give a person ben-
efit. But we now know and have now 
proven that cloth masks have offered 
little benefit, and they may actually 
make viruses and infections more com-
mon. 
Does the CDC really believe masking 
would help in an airplane? And if they 
did so, why wouldn’t they suggest we 
wear N95 masks, and why do they allow 
cloth masks? It just seems very incon-
sistent. 
The big problem is always compli-
ance. Seatbelts don’t work unless you 
wear them. An airbag on the car 
doesn’t work unless you have it turned 
on. Just look around. Nobody can wear 
these masks for hours and hours at a 
time without touching their nose and 
touching their mouth and adjusting

the mask. Then we take it off to eat 
and to drink just for moments at a 
time. In the real world, it doesn’t make 
any sense that the mask would work 
and certainly not in schools. I think 
that has been well-proven. 
I think we look at Sweden as a coun-
try whose mortality is a fraction of 
ours from the COVID virus, a fraction 
of its neighboring countries—a country 
that had very limited use of masks 
without mandates as well. 
I think the big opportunity with air-
lines is they made a big investment in 
air exchange. We know air exchange 
works. From our experiences in sur-
gical centers, we know that when we 
moved to the modern air exchangers, 
that a number of infections—post-op 
infections for joint replacements—went 
down significantly. We always knew 
the air replacement was a big part of 
this. 
But, no, this administration con-
tinues to want to control our lives. 
Their 
healthcare 
infectious 
disease 
czar, Dr. Fauci, decreed that even after 
airline executives gave testimony that 
masks were of no benefit, Dr. Fauci de-
creed that he didn’t think masks would 
ever come off on airplanes. Why? Why 
would he make such a bombastic, igno-
rant claim? 
It is time to stop all the mandates. It 
is time to stop all the travel mask 
mandates. It is time to let our people 
go. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO CHIEF WARRANT OF-
FICER DONALD R. CRUTCHFIELD 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I request 
unanimous consent to enter into a col-
loquy with the Senator from Okla-
homa. 
As the chairman and ranking mem-
ber of the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee, we rise to commemorate and 
celebrate the distinguished career of 
Chief 
Warrant 
Officer 
Donald 
R. 
Crutchfield of the U.S. Army. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, for 24 
years, Chief Crutchfield has served the 
nation with honor and professionalism. 
Now, as he retires from his post as As-
sistant Director for General and Flag 
Officer Matters in the Office of the 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense 
for Military Personnel and Policy, we 
are privileged to thank him for his dec-
ades of service. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, a native of 
Ohio, Don joined the Army in 1998 and 
has worked at every echelon since, 
from the 516th Personnel Services Bat-
talion; multiple brigades; III Corps; Of-
fice of the Vice Director of the Army 
Staff; Headquarters of the Department 
of the Army; and the Army General Of-
ficer Management Office. In every as-
signment, he was known to his col-
leagues as a dedicated leader and an ex-
pert of his craft. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in addi-
tion to extensive service around the 
country, Don also deployed overseas 
three times, including 13 months in 
Iraq in 2004, 9 months in Afghanistan in 
2012, and 8 months in Kuwait in 2014. 
He answered the call to duty time and 
time again with absolute selflessness, 
and we all live in a safer and more 
prosperous nation because of Ameri-
cans like him. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, Don did 
not serve alone, however. Throughout 
his career, he was supported by his 
family, friends, and colleagues. We owe 
a special debt of gratitude to Don’s 
wife, Christine, and his daughters, 
Amber and Lydia, who supported him 
with strength and love. His contribu-
tions to the Nation were possible be-
cause of their support. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are 
proud to honor the achievements of 
Chief 
Warrant 
Officer 
Donald 
Crutchfield, and, on behalf of a grateful 
nation, we salute his service. We offer 
him our thanks and congratulate him 
on a well-earned retirement. 
f 
NATIONAL KIDNEY MONTH 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this 
March, as we mark National Kidney 
Month, we have the opportunity to re-
member those we have lost to kidney- 
related illnesses, recognize the work we 
have done to combat kidney diseases, 
and recommit to continue and expand 
on these efforts to improve the care 
available to those who are suffering. 
Kidney disease is the tenth leading 
cause of death in the United States. 
Today, more than 37 million Americans 
have chronic kidney disease. One in 
three adults is at risk of developing 
chronic kidney disease, which can lead 
to kidney failure or end-stage renal 
disease, an irreversible condition that 
is fatal without a kidney transplant or 
dialysis. In Maryland alone, almost 
93,000 Medicare patients have been di-
agnosed with chronic kidney disease, 
and almost 10,000 of these individuals 
are currently on dialysis. 
As with many health issues, commu-
nities across the Nation do not suffer 
from kidney disease equally. Black 
Americans make up 35 percent of the 
people with kidney failure in the 
United States, despite only making up 
13 percent of the U.S. population. His-
panic Americans are 1.3 times more 
likely to be diagnosed with kidney fail-
ure 
than 
non-Hispanics. 
End-stage 
renal disease is 3.7 times more likely in 
Black Americans, 1.4 times more likely

in Native Americans, and 1.5 more like-
ly in Asian Americans than in White 
Americans. Patients of color also wait 
longer than White patients to receive a 
deceased donor transplant and are less 
likely to receive a living donor trans-
plant. 
While progress is often too slow, in 
the past year alone, we have made sig-
nificant steps to understand and ad-
dress factors leading to the overrepre-
sentation of certain populations with 
chronic kidney disease. Following re-
search from the National Kidney Foun-
dation and the American Society of Ne-
phrology, institutions like the Univer-
sity of Maryland Medicine ended the 
outdated use of race as a factor in diag-
nosing chronic kidney disease. This 
change will lead to earlier diagnosis 
and treatment of Black Americans. 
Not surprisingly, the COVID–19 pan-
demic has had a devastating impact on 
those with severe chronic medical con-
ditions like kidney disease. Patients 
with chronic kidney disease or end- 
stage 
renal 
disease 
are 
often 
immunocompromised, especially those 
on 
dialysis 
or 
taking 
immuno-
suppressive medicines as part of the 
process for a kidney transplant. Con-
sequently, people with kidney disease 
are at a higher risk of developing a 
more severe case of, and dying from, 
COVID–19. 
Last year, I reintroduced the Chronic 
Kidney Disease Improvement in Re-
search and Treatment Act with Sen-
ator BLUNT. This legislation takes im-
portant steps to expand kidney disease 
awareness and education, improve the 
accuracy and transparency of end-stage 
renal 
disease 
quality 
programs, 
incentivize innovation in dialysis care, 
and expand patient choices of insur-
ance coverage. 
Nearly one-half of the people suf-
fering from chronic kidney disease do 
not know they have kidney disease be-
cause of inadequate screening pro-
grams and a lack of awareness about 
the disease. My legislation would ex-
pand Medicare’s annual wellness ben-
efit to include kidney disease screening 
for at-risk patients and improve access 
to pre-dialysis kidney education pro-
grams to better manage patients’ kid-
ney disease—an effort that, in some 
cases, could actually prevent kidney 
failure and reduce the $153 billion 
Medicare spends on care for kidney pa-
tients. 
To address health equity issues in 
chronic kidney disease, my legislation 
would also require the Department of 
Health and Human Services to submit 
a report to Congress on national kid-
ney transplantation rates and make 
recommendations on prevention and 
treatment 
for 
communities 
disproportionally affected by kidney 
failure. 
Further, my legislation would expand 
choices in health insurance coverage to 
those with end-stage renal disease by 
guaranteeing access to Medigap poli-
cies to all end-stage renal disease 
Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of 
age. 
Currently, 
Medicare 
patients 
under 65, whether disabled or end-stage 
renal disease beneficiaries, do not have 
access to Medigap plans, even though 
Medicare is their primary insurance. 
The best treatment for kidney failure 
is kidney transplantation from a living 
donor, but only a third of kidney trans-
plants are of this type. Over 100,000 
Americans 
are 
on 
the 
transplant 
waitlist with 90,000 of them waiting for 
a kidney. Only 24,000 kidneys were 
transplanted in 2021. The average wait 
time for a deceased donor kidney trans-
plant is 5 years but can be as long as 10 
years in some States. But with the di-
rect donation from a living donor, the 
average time is 3–6 months. Sadly, 114 
patients in Maryland died while on the 
waitlist in 2021. This is why I am also 
a cosponsor of the Living Donor Pro-
tection Act, which works to remove 
barriers to organ donation and protect 
the rights of and prohibit discrimina-
tion against organ donors, with the 
goal of increasing the number of living 
donors. 
Although 
the 
scientific 
under-
standing of kidney disease has pro-
gressed immensely, significant gaps 
persist, and treatment has remained 
largely the same. Research on kidney 
failure is underfunded compared with 
the costs of treating chronic kidney 
disease and end-stage renal disease. I 
am proud of what the National Insti-
tutes of Health and other Maryland- 
based research institutions have done 
to combat kidney disease and other 
kidney-related illnesses. There is more 
to do, however, and I look forward to 
working with my colleagues to fight 
kidney diseases and bring relief to the 
millions of Americans who suffer from 
them.

TRIBUTE TO GENERAL KENNETH 
FRANKLIN MCKENZIE, JR. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor U.S. Marine Corps Gen-
eral Kenneth Franklin McKenzie, Jr., 
commander of U.S. Central Command, 
MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, FL. 
General McKenzie is one of our Na-
tion’s finest military officers, and he 
will retire from Active military service 
on April 1, 2022, with nearly 43 years of 
distinguished service to our great Na-
tion. 
General McKenzie, a native of Bir-
mingham, AL, graduated from The 
Citadel in 1979 and was commissioned 
into the Marine Corps as an infantry 
officer. During his distinguished ca-
reer, General McKenzie commanded at 
the platoon, company, battalion, Ma-
rine Expeditionary Unit, service com-
ponent, and combatant command lev-
els. As a lieutenant colonel, he com-
manded First Battalion, Sixth Marines. 
As the commanding officer of the 22nd 
Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special 
Operations Capable), he led combat de-
ployments to Afghanistan in 2004 and 
Iraq from 2005 to 2006. From 2006 to 
2007, General McKenzie served as the 
Military Secretary to the 33rd and 34th 
Commandants of the Marine Corps. 
As a general officer, he served on the 
Joint Staff as a Deputy Director of Op-
erations within the National Military 
Command Center. He was also selected 
by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff to be the Director of the Chair-
man’s New Administration Transition 
Team, where he coordinated the efforts 
of the Joint Staff and the combatant 
commands during a wartime transition 
of administrations. General McKenzie 
later assumed command of the U.S. 
Marine Corps Forces, Central Com-
mand, and most recently took com-
mand of U.S. Central Command, a posi-
tion he has held since 2019. 
General McKenzie is an honors grad-
uate of the Army Armor Officer Ad-
vanced Course, Marine Corps Command 
and Staff College, and the School of 
Advanced Warfighting. In 1999, he was 
selected as a commandant of the Ma-
rine Corps Fellow and served as a sen-
ior military fellow within the Institute 
for National Strategic Studies at the 
National Defense University. 
At a time of great uncertainty in the 
world, particularly in the Middle East, 
General McKenzie led U.S. Central 
Command through multiple momen-
tous events while deterring Iran, de-
feating ISIS, and securing the region. 
General McKenzie is an exceptional 
leader, selfless servant, and American 
patriot who is committed to our Na-
tion and our interests. With profound 
admiration and deep respect, we pay 
tribute for all he has done for the de-
fense of our Nation for more than four 
decades. 
Today, I am honored to recognize 
General McKenzie’s long and decorated 
career. On behalf of a grateful nation, I 
commend General McKenzie for his 
dedicated service to the United States 
of America. I also wish to recognize the 
sacrifices and contributions made by 
General McKenzie’s wife, Marilyn, as 
well as their son, K.R., daughter-in- 
law, Kristin, and two grandsons, Noah 
and James. We are a nation truly in-
debted to all of the servicemembers, 
veterans, and military families who 
continue to give so much to defend our 
American values and liberties. I extend 
my best wishes to General McKenzie 
and his family on the occasion of his 
retirement. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO JIM LAZARUS 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to a friend 
and senior member of my team, Jim 
Lazarus, upon his recent retirement 
from public service. Jim has been a key 
adviser to me, in official roles and oth-
erwise, for the past 40 years, and I wish 
him all the very best in retirement. 
Jim has spent nearly 50 years of dedi-
cated service to San Francisco and the 
people of California. After graduating 
from American University and the Uni-

rights of farmworkers. He then served 
as the deputy city attorney for the city 
of San Francisco when I was serving on 
the board of supervisors. 
After a few years in private practice, 
I was lucky enough to bring Jim back 
to city hall in 1983 as executive deputy 
mayor for finance and administration. 
Jim helped run San Francisco, man-
aging our operations and keeping us in 
good financial shape. Jim has said, 
‘‘The best job I ever had was the years 
I was deputy mayor to Feinstein, a 
great job if you’re a San Franciscan 
and love the city.’’ And I will add to 
that: The City of San Francisco bene-
fited greatly from Jim’s legal acumen 
and management during that critical 
time. 
Jim served in a variety of public and 
civic positions after that, including 
with the San Francisco Chamber of 
Commerce, Hunters Point Citizens Ad-
visory Committee, chief of staff to 
Mayor Frank Jordan, and even chief 
operating officer of the San Francisco 
Zoological Society. 
Wherever there was a need to solve a 
problem, Jim was ready and willing to 
go. It was my good fortune to have him 
come back to my office in 1999 as State 
director for my Senate operation. In 
that role, he oversaw the staff across 
our State offices and advocated for 
California’s needs in the U.S. Senate. 
Unfortunately, Jim was a rolling 
stone and returned to the San Fran-
cisco Chamber of Commerce in 2006, 
where he remained for 13 years as sen-
ior VP for public policy. 
Anyone who knows San Francisco 
can imagine how challenging and sen-
sitive that role must be. It combines 
the business interests of cutting-edge 
leaders in high tech, the longstanding 
commercial goals of mainstream U.S. 
businesses, and one of the most chal-
lenging legal and regulatory frame-
works in the United States. 
To my eternal gratitude, I was able 
to convince Jim, at the end of 2018, to 
put off retirement and come back one 
last time to be my State director. He 
was in that position when COVID hit 
the Nation, and our office went into 
overdrive to help Californians get 
through the pandemic and the eco-
nomic collapse. He has overseen the 
State staff through California’s two 
worst fire seasons on record and the 
growing drought. For many months, he 
has been a trusted friend and partner, 
going over the issues of day, business 
before the Senate, and life in San Fran-
cisco. 
Jim’s last day with the Senate was 
February 28, a day fittingly named 
‘‘Jim Lazarus Day’’ in San Francisco 
by Mayor London Breed. His efforts 
have made the city a better place and 
have made me a more effective Sen-
ator. In addition to his work at the 
Federal level, he has been pivotal in 
protecting 
and 
strengthening 
the 
rights of so many Californians, to in-
clude the LGBT community, the busi-
ness community, renters, and those 
seeking clean air and water. He has 
made a huge mark over decades im-
proving the services and culture of San 
Francisco. 
Jim has now retired and plans to 
spend more time with his wife Ann and 
their children Kate, Nicole, Jack, and 
Michael. I have no doubt that he will 
keep his oar in civic life, and I will 
leave the door open for another chat 
over a glass of California Chardonnay.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Ms. ERNST: 
S. 3836. A bill to establish within the 
Executive Office of the President the 
Taxpayer Watchdog Office; to the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, there are 
very few things that possess the power 
to change the course of history almost 
instantaneously. Information is one. 
Consider, 
right 
now, 
citizens 
in 
Ukraine are holding one of the most 
ruthless, autocratic, and powerful men 
in the world, Vladimir Putin, account-
able for his barbaric assault on their 
country with their firsthand accounts 
being live-streamed from behind the 
battle lines. 
Putin is attempting to censor cov-
erage of the bloody conflict by threat-
ening to jail journalists and Russian 
citizens who dare use the word ‘‘war’’ 
to describe his unprovoked attack. 
Even the United Nations instructed 
its staff not to refer to Russia’s mili-
tary assault on Ukraine as a ‘‘war’’ or 
‘‘invasion.’’ Yet, every day, Ukrainians 
are bypassing this blockade of informa-
tion and exposing the Russian tyrant’s 
atrocities in real time by sharing im-
ages of civilians standing up to the 
heavily armed Russian invaders, the 
innocent 
victims 
and 
destruction 
caused by the bombing, and captured 
Russian soldiers in tears testifying 
that they were lied to and misled into 
attacking a peaceful country. 
As a result, the people of Ukraine 
have rallied the world, including many 
Russians, 
behind 
their 
courageous 
struggle to preserve freedom and de-
mocracy against the largest military 
assault in Europe since World War II. 
This is the power of information. 
Authoritarians like Putin cannot 
hide their dirty deeds in the dark as 
long as light can be shined to expose 
the truth. It should serve as a reminder 
to every single American how impor-
tant it is that we uphold and defend 
the fundamental principles of our Na-
tion that make us so great—in par-
ticular, our First Amendment. 
We should never take these American 
freedoms for granted. That is why it is 
important we celebrate the freedom of 
information every year during Sun-
shine Week. With widespread distrust 
in government and the media and Big 
Tech controlling what facts and opin-
ions can even be shared, it has become 
increasingly important that each one 
of us has the power to access facts, 
unfiltered. 
To arm us with information, over the 
past half century, a number of impor-
tant laws have been passed by Congress 
to increase openness in government 
and give our citizens a right to know. 
These include the Freedom of Informa-
tion Act, or FOIA, which allows access 
to government documents, and the 
Federal Funding Accountability and 
Transparency Act, which provides a de-
tailed accounting of how, where, why, 
and by whom taxpayer dollars are 
being spent. 
To demonstrate the importance of 
these laws, let me give you a relatively 
simple example with potentially pro-
found implications. 
In the early days of the COVID–19 
pandemic, I teamed up with my friends 
at the White Coat Waste Project to use 
a combination of these transparency 
laws to follow a trail of U.S. taxpayer 
dollars to China’s state-run Wuhan In-
stitute of Virology, where they were 
being used to pay for dangerous re-
search on coronaviruses. The world is 
now demanding to know if these stud-
ies could have been the source of the 
COVID–19 pandemic that shut down our 
planet for the past 2 years and claimed 
the lives of millions around the globe. 
Regretfully, we still don’t know the 
whole truth because communist China 
refuses to cooperate and is, instead, de-
stroying evidence and coercing inves-
tigators to dismiss any suggestion that 
the virus might have escaped from the 
lab. Even many within the free press of 
our own country, the scientific commu-
nity, and Big Tech fell for the Com-
munist 
misinformation 
campaign, 
smearing anyone who even suggested 
the lab could have been the source of 
the outbreak as spreading ‘‘conspiracy 
theories.’’ 
We refused to be intimidated by this 
Communist Party’s propaganda and 
continued our search for the truth. We 
followed the science and the money and 
discovered the world was being told a 
story that was very much different 
from what was transpiring behind 
those closed doors. 
Thanks, in part, to a transparency 
law requiring the disclosure of details 
on projects paid for by U.S. taxpayers, 
we knew NIH was funding a group

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1180 
March 15, 2022 
called EcoHealth to conduct experi-
ments on coronaviruses that were ob-
tained from bats in China and that 
they were doing so in collaboration 
with the now-infamous Wuhan Insti-
tute. 
The White Coat Waste Project then 
used FOIA to obtain internal NIH 
emails, which revealed the Agency was 
funding controversial gain-of-function 
research 
on 
coronaviruses 
at 
the 
Wuhan Institute in 2016. They also re-
vealed Dr. Fauci was told as early as 
January 2020 that COVID–19 looked en-
gineered. 
Was this project, paid for with your 
tax dollars, somehow related to the re-
lease of the COVID–19 pandemic, which 
just happened to begin in the vicinity 
of the lab in Wuhan? 
EcoHealth might know the truth or 
even provide some clues, but the 
group’s president refuses to answer 
questions. In fact, he organized a 
disinformation campaign to discredit 
scientists who dared to ask that ques-
tion. 
EcoHealth also evaded a number of 
Federal transparency laws requiring 
the disclosure of how our tax dollars 
are being spent. As a result, we still 
aren’t even entirely sure how much of 
our money was sunk into subsidizing 
the unsafe, state-run lab in communist 
China. 
Folks, we really deserve the answers, 
and if EcoHealth won’t cooperate vol-
untarily, then that information will be 
obtained with subpoenas when Repub-
licans are back in control of Congress. 
You can mark my words. 
This 
troubling 
situation 
dem-
onstrates both the power and the short-
comings of transparency laws. Armed 
with information, citizens can uphold 
the government and make it account-
able and expose malfeasance but only if 
the laws are followed, and, right now, 
many of these laws are all bark and no 
bite. 
So what can a civic-minded Iowan do 
to get answers from inside the DC belt-
way bureaucracy? 
Well, you know what they say: If you 
want a friend in Washington, get a dog. 
That is why I have introduced the 
Watchdog Act, which will establish 
within the White House a new Director 
of Openness—yes, you have got it, D-O- 
G—Director of Openness in Govern-
ment, who will be the taxpayers’ best 
friend. This top dog will hound our gov-
ernment bureaucrats to fetch the facts 
for our taxpayers. Agencies that would 
not provide information in a complete 
and timely manner would be dogged 
until they do. 
In contrast to Russia, where the gov-
ernment controls and censors informa-
tion, my bill creates a transparency 
czar to open government and spread in-
formation. 
Folks, we can’t have gatekeepers of 
truth in a free society. That is why, 
under my bill, those who censor infor-
mation, rather than those who share it, 
will be held accountable. 
The best way to restore trust in our 
public institutions and to discredit 
misinformation campaigns is by shin-
ing a light on what is really going on 
in Washington, and with the Sun now 
setting an hour later every day, we are 
all reminded what a big difference a 
little bit of sunshine can make.

mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 546 
Whereas the United States of America is a 
beacon for the values of freedom, democracy, 
and human rights across the globe; 
Whereas there are several universal dec-
larations and treaties promoting human 
rights, laws of war, and upholding the dig-
nity of individuals; 
Whereas the United Nations Charter Pre-
amble states that member nations ‘‘reaffirm 
faith in fundamental human rights [and] in 
the dignity and worth of the human person’’; 
Whereas the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights Preamble states that ‘‘Mem-
ber States have pledged themselves to 
achieve, in cooperation with the United Na-
tions, the promotion of universal respect for 
and observance of human rights and funda-
mental freedoms’’; 
Whereas the Russian Federation joined as 
an original member of the United Nations as 
the former Union of Soviet Socialists Repub-
lics on October 24, 1945, and as such has a 
duty to abide by the conditions of the United 
Nations Charter and pledges reflected in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 
Whereas the International Criminal Court 
(ICC) is an international tribunal that seeks 
to uphold the rule of law, especially in areas 
where no rule of law exists, by investigating 
and trying individuals charged ‘‘with the 
gravest crimes of concern to the inter-
national community: genocide, war crimes, 
crimes against humanity and the crime of 
aggression’’; 
Whereas grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva 
Conventions constitute war crimes, includ-
ing ‘‘wil[l]ful killing, torture or inhuman 
treatment, including biological experiments, 
wil[l]fully causing great suffering or serious 
injury to body or health. . . and extensive 
destruction and appropriation of property, 
not justified by military necessity and car-
ried out unlawfully and wantonly’’; 
Whereas other serious violations of the 
laws and customs applicable in international 
armed conflict can constitute war crimes, 
which can include intentionally directing at-
tacks against the civilian population as such 
or against individual civilians not taking di-
rect part in hostilities and intentionally di-
recting attacks against civilian objects, that 
is, objects which are not military objectives; 
Whereas President Vladimir Putin, mem-
bers of the Russian Security Council, and 
President Putin’s military commanders have 
severely undermined the international rule 
of law through their various actions; 
Whereas, prior to the most recent invasion 
of Ukraine in February 2022, President Vladi-
mir Putin and the Russian Federation has a 
long history of committing acts of aggres-
sion, human rights violations, and acts that 
constitute war crimes within the Russian 
Federation and around the globe, including 
in Chechnya, Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria; 
Whereas, beginning in 1999, the Russian 
Federation engaged in the indiscriminate 
use of force against the people of Chechnya, 
including the use of cluster munitions 
against 
civilians, 
resulting 
in 
50,000 
Chechens, mostly civilians, dead or missing; 
Whereas, during the Russian Federation’s 
invasion of Georgia in 2008, Russian Armed 
Forces engaged with cluster munitions in in-
discriminate and disproportionate attacks 
that resulted in the death of civilians; 
Whereas, since 2014, President Vladimir 
Putin 
has 
violated 
the 
sovereignty 
of 
Ukraine and used military force to seize con-
trol and unlawfully occupy Crimea, and in-
stalled Russian separatist-backed forces in 
eastern Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of 
thousands of innocent civilians since 2014; 
Whereas the Russian military was deemed 
responsible for shooting down Malaysia Air-
lines Flight 17 over eastern Ukraine on July 
17, 2014, which resulted in the death of 298 ci-
vilians; 
Whereas rebel forces supported by the Rus-
sian Federation were deemed responsible for 
a missile attack on January 24, 2015, in 
Mariupol, 
Ukraine 
that 
indiscriminately 
killed and injured civilians, resulting in the 
death of at least 30 and injuring many more; 
Whereas, in 2016 and 2017, Russian aircraft 
deployed ‘‘bunker-busting’’ and incendiary 
bombs capable of destroying military instal-
lations on civilian structures in Aleppo, 
Syria, resulting in the death of hundreds of 
civilians; 
Whereas 
President 
Vladimir 
Putin 
is 
complicit in war crimes and human rights 
violations in Syria through his continuing 
political, financial, and military support for 
President Bashar al-Assad; 
Whereas 
intelligence 
assessments 
have 
concluded Vladimir Putin and his regime 
have destroyed the rule of law in Russia and 
engaged in countless atrocities, including or-
dering the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, the 
poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, and 
the false imprisonment and torture ulti-
mately leading to the death of Sergei 
Magnitsky; 
Whereas President Vladimir Putin, in Feb-
ruary 
2022, 
initiated 
a 
premeditated, 
unprovoked, unjustified, and unlawful war 
against the sovereign nation of Ukraine; 
Whereas, since February 24, 2022, President 
Vladimir Putin and Russian Federation 
forces reportedly killed more than 500 civil-
ians, to include children, while invading 
Ukrainian urban centers, causing chaos and 
fear among Ukrainian citizens;

SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE. 
The Senate— 
(1) strongly condemns the ongoing vio-

manders; 
(4) encourages the United States Govern-

their proxies, and President Putin’s military 
commanders accountable for their sponsor-

have been affected by the brutality of the 
Putin regime.

SENATE RESOLUTION 547—RECOG-
NIZING THE 201ST ANNIVERSARY 
OF GREEK INDEPENDENCE AND 
CELEBRATING 
DEMOCRACY 
IN 
GREECE 
AND 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. 
BARRASSO) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 547 
Whereas the concept of democracy, in 
which the supreme power to govern was vest-
ed in the people, was developed in ancient 
Greece; 
Whereas the founding fathers of the United 
States were inspired by ancient Greek polit-
ical philosophy, which many of them read in 
the original Greek language, when they 
formed the representative democracy of the 
United States; 
Whereas Petros Mavromichalis, the former 
Commander in Chief of Greece and a founder 
of the modern Greek state, said to the citi-
zens of the United States in 1821, ‘‘It is in 
your land that liberty has fixed her abode 
and. . . in imitating you, we shall imitate 
our ancestors and be thought worthy of them 
if we succeed in resembling you’’; 
Whereas Thomas Jefferson wrote, in an Oc-
tober 21, 1823, letter to Greek scholar 
Adamantios Koraes discussing the ongoing 
Greek struggle for independence, that ‘‘[n]o 
people sympathise more feelingly than ours 
with the sufferings of your countrymen, 
none offer more sincere and ardent prayers 
to heaven for their success’’; 
Whereas then-Congressman Daniel Web-
ster, on January 19, 1824, in a speech in sup-
port of his resolution to send an American 
envoy to Greece amid its struggle for inde-
pendence, recognized ‘‘the struggle of an in-
teresting and gallant people. . . contending 
against fearful odds, for being, and for the 
common privilege of human nature’’; 
Whereas American Philhellenes, including 
future abolitionist Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, 
future abolitionist Jonathan Peckham Mil-
ler, and George Jarvis, traveled to Greece to 
fight alongside and provide aid to the Greek 
people in their struggle for independence; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
generously sent humanitarian assistance to 
the people of Greece during their struggle for 
independence, 
often 
through 
philhellene 
committees; 
Whereas Greece heroically resisted Axis 
forces at a crucial moment in World War II, 
forcing Adolf Hitler to change his timeline 
and delaying the attack on Russia; 
Whereas Winston Churchill said that ‘‘if 
there had not been the virtue and courage of 
the Greeks, we do not know which the out-
come of World War II would have been’’ and 
‘‘no longer will we say that Greeks fight like 
heroes, but that heroes fight like Greeks’’; 
Whereas the United States and Greece 
have been allies in major international con-
flicts throughout modern history; 
Whereas the Greek-American community 
has positively contributed to American soci-
ety and has helped forge strong ties between 
the United States and Greece; 
Whereas the United States greatly contrib-
uted to the reconstruction of Greece after 
World War II; 
Whereas NATO membership has further en-
hanced cooperation between the United 
States and Greece; 
Whereas Greece is an integral part of the 
European Union; 
Whereas Greece is a strategic partner of 
the United States in bringing political sta-
bility and economic development to the Bal-
kan region, having actively contributed to 
the Euro-Atlantic integration of the coun-
tries of the region and having been a major 
investor in Southeastern Europe, including 
in critical infrastructure; 
Whereas Greece participates in and ac-
tively promotes several formats for regional 
partnership in the Eastern Mediterranean; 
Whereas the United States has dem-
onstrated its support for the trilateral part-
nership of Greece, Israel, and Cyprus by en-
acting into law the Eastern Mediterranean 
Security and Energy Partnership Act of 2019 
(title II of division J of Public Law 116–94) 
and through joint engagement with Greece, 
Israel, and Cyprus in the ‘‘3+1’’ format; 
Whereas this support was bolstered in the 
United States-Greece Defense and Inter-
parliamentary Partnership Act of 2021 (sub-
title B of title XIII of Public Law 117–81), es-
tablishing a 3+1 Interparliamentary Group to 
discuss the expansion of co-operation in 
other areas of common concern; 
Whereas the United States and Greece’s 
commitment to security cooperation led to 
the conclusion of a Mutual Defense Coopera-
tion Agreement, which was updated in 2021 
in order to enhance defense ties between the 
two countries and promote stability in the 
broader region; 
Whereas the ongoing United States-Greece 
Strategic Dialogue reflects Greece’s impor-
tance to the United States as a geostrategic 
partner, especially in the Eastern Mediterra-
nean and Balkans, and as an important 
NATO ally; 
Whereas the Governments and people of 
Greece and the United States are at the fore-
front of international efforts to advance 
freedom, democracy, rule of law, human 
rights, peace, and stability; 
Whereas those efforts and similar ideals 
have forged a close bond between the peoples 
of Greece and the United States; and 
Whereas it is proper and desirable for the 
United States to celebrate March 25, 2022, 
Greek Independence Day, with the people of 
Greece and to reaffirm the democratic prin-
ciples from which those two great countries 
were founded: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) extends warm congratulations and best 
wishes to the people of Greece as they cele-
brate the 201st anniversary of the independ-
ence of Greece; 
(2) expresses support for the principles of 
democratic governance to which the people 
of the United States and Greece are com-
mitted; 
(3) notes the important role that Greece 
has played in the wider European region and 
in the community of nations since gaining 
its independence; 
(4) commends the contributions of the 
Greek-American community to the United 
States and its role as a bridge between the 
two countries; 
(5) commends the critical role Greece plays 
in promoting stability in the Eastern Medi-
terranean and Western Balkans; and 
(6) appreciates the important energy part-
nership that exists between the United 
States and Greece, and the important role 
that Greece plays in bolstering European en-
ergy security.

U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
rise again to discuss the scheme that 
has captured and now controls Amer-
ica’s Supreme Court. 
If you have been following this series 
of speeches, you know that we have 
gone over the Powell memo and the 
plan it laid out for the corporate right-
wing. We have gone over the technique 
of Agency capture, regulatory capture, 
that has been applied to the Supreme 
Court. We have gone over the turnstile, 
that big anonymous rightwing donor 
setup within the Federalist Society to 
approve Republican nominees and the 
dark money front groups that sped 
those nominees through Senate con-
firmation. And we have discussed how 
the big rightwing donor interests influ-
ence Justices while they are on the 
Bench, through fast lanes for dark 
money 
litigation 
and 
flotillas—flo-
tillas—of dark money amici curiae, 
front group amici. 
Well, if you set up a machine like 
that, you will pretty soon see Justices 
auditioning for the role. To understand 
the origins of this auditioning, you 
need to start with a little bit of his-
tory. 
It is 1990, and President George H. W. 
Bush needs to fill a vacancy left by the 
legendary Justice William Brennan. 
President Bush appoints a recent First 
Circuit nominee named David Souter, 
who had spent most of his career in 
New Hampshire State government. 
At the time, Republicans thought 
Souter’s short time on the Federal 
bench was an asset. Without a long 
paper trail, there was less chance that 
Souter’s nomination would go down in 
flames, like Robert Bork’s had. 
But Souter wasn’t the conservative 
the rightwing hoped for. Indeed, he 
could be down-right moderate. In their 
disappointment, they adopted a new 
mantra: ‘‘No More Souters.’’ 
When rumors got around that George 
W. Bush might nominate his White 
House Counsel, Alberto Gonzales, to 
the Court, he was not seen as rightwing 
enough, and the scheme panicked and 
the mantra became ‘‘Al Gonzales is 
Spanish for ‘David Souter.’ ’’ 
John 
Paul 
Stevens 
was 
another 
rightwing 
disappointment. 
So 
‘‘No 
More Souters’’ as a mantra was joined 
by ‘‘No More Stevenses.’’ 
With 
these 
disappointments, 
the 
rightwing donors and their Federalist 
Society accolades vowed to better 
groom 
and 
vet 
future 
candidates, 
scouring Republican nominees’ records 
for maximum adherence to scheme or-
thodoxy. 
Well, once that process was up and 
operating, the response was predict-
able. Ambitious rightwing lawyers as-
piring to the Federal Bench aren’t 
dumb. They will follow the path that 
guides them to their goal. So the max-
imum adherence auditioning began. I 
have described the circuit court judge 
who observed his colleagues taking 
cases and issuing rulings that seemed 
to have the clear intent of sending a 
signal. They strained to write decisions 
that were dressed to impress. They 
were, in his word, ‘‘auditioning’’—audi-
tioning for the Federalist Society gate-
keepers. 
So how exactly does this auditioning 
work? There is a recipe: 
One, you have got to understand 
what matters to the big donors: guns, 
unbridled 
campaign 
spending, 
cor-
porate political power, shrinking the 
so-called 
administrative 
state, 
and 
rightwing social issues. 
Two, fly solo. It can actually help if 
you go it alone. Write opinions so ex-
treme that they stand out and donors 
take notice. 
And, three, of course, where you can, 
deliver the goods. If a case allows you 
to score a win for a big donor interest, 
take it. 
Three Justices who knew this recipe 
well were the trio nominated by Don-
ald Trump. 
As 
a 
circuit 
court 
judge, 
Neil 
Gorsuch became a darling of the right-
wing donor elites for his commitment

to dismantling this so-called adminis-
trative state. To do that, he deployed 
radical legal theories cooked up and 
propagated in the scheme’s legal the-
ory hothouse, where they developed 
schemes, kind of reverse-engineering 
them to give victories in cases. 
In one instance, Gorsuch even wrote 
two opinions for the same case: one, 
the majority opinion that his col-
leagues joined; and the other, an out- 
there 
solo 
opinion 
displaying 
his 
scheme bona fides. 
Gorsuch also displayed his fervor for 
what 
he 
called 
religious 
freedom, 
which usually translates to disman-
tling the separation between church 
and State, which is another scheme fa-
vorite. 
Justice Amy Coney Barrett knew 
how to audition too. In one case, 
Barrett’s Seventh Circuit Court of Ap-
peals declined to hear a challenge to an 
Indiana law on women’s right to 
choose. Barrett bucked the majority to 
stakeout an eyebrow-raising position 
on the right, joining a dissent aimed 
directly at Supreme Court abortion 
precedent. 
On guns, Judge Barrett authored an 
opinion in a Second Amendment case 
called Kanter v. Barr that would have 
given a felon back his gun because his 
felony wasn’t violent. Constitutional 
scholars’ jaws hit the floor at that one. 
Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment 
expert at UCLA Law School, told the 
New Yorker that the opinion was 
‘‘Amy Coney Barrett’s audition tape 
for the Supreme Court.’’ And it was her 
audition tape because her ‘‘view of the 
Second Amendment [was] outside of 
the mainstream’’ and ‘‘would appeal 
. . . to the Federalist Society.’’ 
Of course, the biggest auditioner of 
all was Brett Kavanaugh. On the DC 
Circuit, Kavanaugh did so much audi-
tioning it is hard to know where to 
begin. He issued opinions on abortion, 
on guns, on the administrative state, 
on campaign finance, and more. He was 
not concerned with building consensus. 
He wanted to make a point. 
Here is Washington Post editor Ruth 
Marcus in her book on Kavanaugh: 
His more liberal appeals court colleagues 
found him affable but unyielding. He would 
engage but rarely, if ever, change his mind, 
[and he] displayed a propensity for filing sep-
arate concurrences and dissents, actions that 
some 
colleagues 
took 
as 
judicial 
grandstanding and, more to the point, an ef-
fort to position himself for a Supreme Court 
seat. 
Auditioning—in fact, Kavanaugh dis-
sented more each year on the bench 
than any of his DC Circuit colleagues, 
whether Republican or Democratic ap-
pointees. 
Kavanaugh made clear that he would 
be on the team if on the Court. 
Kavanaugh pumped up the ‘‘major 
questions’’ doctrine—one of the hot-
house legal theories pushed by the far 
right. It says that courts should ignore 
an Agency’s authority to solve a prob-
lem if the court thinks the problem is 
too big. Big regulated companies love 
having regulatory Agencies hobbled. So 
this was catnip for scheme donors. 
The majority in that case panned 
Kavanaugh’s ‘‘major questions’’ idea, 
which hadn’t even been raised by the 
parties, but Kavanaugh wasn’t out to 
win votes from his colleagues, and he 
wasn’t out to do justice in that case. 
He was firing an auditioning flare for 
scheme operatives and donors to see 
from miles around. 
Like Barrett, Kavanaugh did his own 
publicity. He spoke at 52—count them, 
52—Federalist Society events over his 
career. You almost couldn’t keep him 
out. And he wasn’t the only one seek-
ing an audience with the Federalist So-
ciety donor elite. After Trump’s elec-
tion, 9 of the 21 people on Trump’s 
short list spoke at a 3-day Federalist 
Society panel dedicated to remem-
bering Justice Scalia, and almost all 
the others were hanging out, mingling 
in the crowd. It was a judicial beauty 
pageant, with some real beauties. 
Kavanaugh had a little problem. He 
wasn’t on Trump’s first list of poten-
tial Supreme Court picks, and he 
wasn’t on the second list either. But all 
that eager auditioning got him onto 
the third list, and the rest is history. 
I am not alone in noting all this au-
ditioning. Here is how one writer for 
Slate paraphrased former U.S. District 
Judge Nancy Gertner about scheme au-
ditioning: 
[C]onservative judges auditioning for 
SCOTUS— 
Supreme 
Court 
of 
the 
United 
States— 
go all out proving their Federalist Society 
bona fides: Gorsuch used his judicial opin-
ions on the appeals court to advertise him-
self as an enemy of the administrative state 
and a diehard proponent of religious free-
dom; Kavanaugh flaunted his support of the 
unitary executive and hostility to reproduc-
tive rights to earn a spot on President Don-
ald Trump’s short list; Amy Coney Barrett 
brandished her Second Amendment maxi-
malism. 
As the Slate writers note: 
The conservative legal movement rewards 
this kind of flagrantly ideological audi-
tioning. Republicans demand evidence that 
their justices will aggressively overturn 
precedent and laws that conflict with their 
political goals. 
As I said earlier, ‘‘no more Souters,’’ 
‘‘no more Stevenses.’’ 
That is the auditioning by these sit-
ting Justices. 
I will close my remarks with an ex-
ample of what happens when you 
haven’t auditioned for the scheme. 
When Justice Sandra Day O’Connor 
announced her retirement, George W. 
Bush wanted to replace her with his 
friend and loyal White House Counsel, 
Harriet Miers. Miers was a dyed-in-the- 
wool conservative. She had served Bush 
and his inner circle faithfully. But she 
wasn’t a Federalist Society insider. 
She didn’t have a record of auditioning 
for the big donors behind the Fed-
eralist Society’s turnstile. She couldn’t 
soothe those rightwing donors that she 
was ‘‘no Souter,’’ ‘‘no Stevens.’’ Her sin 
wasn’t anything in particular; she just 
wasn’t part of the club. 
As Supreme Court scholar Amanda 
Hollis-Brusky put it: 
The message Leonard [Leo] and others had 
sent was: If you want to rise through the 
ranks, we need to know you. And that’s what 
they were all saying about Miers—‘‘We don’t 
know her. She is not one of us.’’ 
Leonard Leo, by the way, is sort of 
the spider at the center of the web of 
donor interests that drive the turnstile 
at the Federalist Society during Re-
publican Presidencies. 
We are now embarking on the con-
firmation process of someone who has 
not auditioned to donor elites for a 
seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. No 
dark money machine guided her selec-
tion. That is refreshing. 
Still, the auditioning continues on 
the right for the next time a Repub-
lican President holds office. Scheme 
donors expect standout candidates who 
wear their commitment to their donor 
welfare on their sleeves. Watch closely 
for more. To be continued. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
f 
UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor again today to stand 
with the people of Ukraine. 
What Russia is doing to Ukraine and 
its citizens is an atrocity. Ukraine is 
an American ally and an independent 
and democratic country of 41 million 
people who simply want to live in 
peace. 
The Russian invasion is an illegal, 
unprovoked, and brutal assault that, 
over the past 19 days since the full- 
scale invasion began, has targeted and 
killed thousands of civilians. Ameri-
cans 
have 
seen 
this 
atrocity 
in 
realtime with horrific videos online or 
on our television screens. 
The videos and photos have some-
times been shocking. Remember the 
one of the woman who was on a 
stretcher, pregnant, leaving the mater-
nity hospital that had been bombed by 
the Russians. We now learned that that 
woman and her baby have died. Today 
we learned that more journalists have 
been killed, including an American 
journalist, a FOX News cameraperson. 
I just returned last night from a bi-
partisan congressional delegation trip 
to Poland, neighboring Ukraine. I was 
joined on that trip by Senator KLO-
BUCHAR, Senator WICKER, and Senator 
BLUMENTHAL. I see Senator WICKER is 
here on the floor. Senator BLUMENTHAL 
is also here. Senator KLOBUCHAR has a 
conflict. She wanted to be here, but she 
is going to be submitting her state-
ment for the record to join us tonight. 
We had a very emotional trip because 
we talked to a lot of the refugees com-
ing out of Ukraine, talked about the 
incredible 
trauma 
they 
are 
going 
through. We also got some very sober-
ing briefings when we were over there 
from our own team but also from the 
Polish Government, from people who 
were helping the refugees. 
It is a very difficult situation. Poland 
is doing what they can to help their

neighbor. They have a special bond 
with Ukraine, and they are doing a lot. 
In fact, most of the nearly 2 million 
refugees who have fled Ukraine because 
of this invasion and the brutal attacks 
have come to Poland, where they have 
been met with open hearts and open 
homes. Literally, people in Poland are 
opening up their homes to these refu-
gees. We were at the border, where 
some of these Polish families have 
come to welcome Ukrainians into their 
apartments, into their homes. 
In addition to briefings from our U.S. 
Embassy team in Poland; the U.S. Em-
bassy team from Ukraine, who is now 
in Poland; the U.S. military in Poland; 
and the Polish Government, we did go 
down to the border between Ukraine 
and Poland to meet with the border of-
ficials from Poland, U.S. and Polish 
international relief organizations, and, 
of course, with the refugees themselves 
who were streaming across the border. 
Roughly, 100 refugees every minute 
are leaving Ukraine. It was heart-
breaking to hear their stories. You can 
imagine. We spoke to them at the bor-
der crossing but also a couple miles 
away at what is called the reception 
center, a convention center that has 
been converted into a place where 
thousands of refugees can come, get a 
good night’s sleep, maybe stay for a 
few days or even a few weeks, find food, 
find healthcare, find mental health 
treatment. 
Most of this, by the way, has been do-
nated. The Polish people have donated 
bed sheets and blankets and quilts. We 
worked there as volunteers with what 
is called the World Central Kitchen, 
something actually a Washington, DC, 
chef, Jose Andres, has set up at natural 
disaster areas to help feed people. He is 
now doing this on the border with 
Ukraine and in Ukraine. In fact, he has 
about 20 different World Central Kitch-
ens set up. This one was at this recep-
tion center being used by refugee fami-
lies who need to find some comfort and 
food, as they have made a long trek, in 
many cases, across Ukraine to get 
there. 
There are also lots of displaced peo-
ple in Ukraine itself, and those people 
are being helped by the same group, 
this World Central Kitchen. I thank 
them. I thank all the volunteers who 
give them support and help so that 
they can lend a hand at these reception 
centers and help these refugees along 
their way. 
I also thank so many other volun-
teers we saw there from every organi-
zation: Catholic relief organizations, 
other faith-based organizations, the 
World Health Organization, and others. 
We were at the border only about 6 
hours after the Russian missiles had 
attacked and killed at least 35 and 
wounded more than 130 at a Ukrainian 
training center just 15 miles away. The 
border guards said they had felt the 
Earth tremble when the bombing at-
tack occurred, again, just several hours 
before we got there. 
This was the first Russian attack so 
close to the western border with Eu-
rope and so close to a NATO ally, a po-
tentially dangerous new phase of the 
Russian assault. 
We met refugees there from all over 
the country, the vast majority of 
whom were mothers with their chil-
dren, sometimes grandmothers with 
their grandchildren. Men between 18 
and 60 are required to stay and fight, so 
we heard some really tough stories 
about families being split apart and 
moms and wives and sisters wondering 
whether their sons and husbands and 
brothers who were in harm’s way were 
still alive. 
Some refugees had traveled by bus, 
some by foot, some on trains. Some 
had come over Ukraine for several 
days. They told of heart-wrenching sto-
ries of their homes being destroyed, of 
friends and family being wounded by 
the indiscriminate Russian bombing of 
civilian areas. They had backpacks or 
small suitcases; that is it. They had to 
travel and travel quickly and travel 
light. They left everything else behind, 
including, again, in some cases, family 
members. 
Some, again, had been traveling for 
several days. One family we met from 
the eastern part of Ukraine said it had 
been over 2 weeks. Some who lived 
close to the border had only made the 
difficult decision to leave their homes 
that very morning after the bombing of 
the training center 15 miles away. Ref-
ugees spoke with tears in their eyes 
about the pain of leaving their home-
land, and all the families I spoke with 
said they want to go back when it is 
safe. 
Many said they appreciated what 
America had done, but just about every 
single refugee we talked to asked that 
the United States of America and other 
countries around the world do more 
particularly to stop the deadly bomb-
ing of civilian targets and the senseless 
destructions of their towns and cities. 
In particular, they begged us to close 
the skies, as they said: Keep us from 
getting bombarded. Stop the carnage. 
They were very proud of the courage of 
the Ukrainian soldiers—they are patri-
ots—and, of course, of the citizen sol-
diers, sometimes including their own 
family who have stepped forward. They 
were proud of the bravery and leader-
ship of President Zelenskyy. 
But consistent with what we have 
heard from the military experts on the 
trip and what many of us have heard 
directly from President Zelenskyy, 
these 
families, 
these 
refugees—the 
grandmothers, the mothers—said the 
ability to provide better air cover with 
more and better ways to protect them 
is what they really want. 
What President Zelenskyy and others 
have said is better anti-air systems, 
better ways to protect against missile 
attacks, anti-missile systems, drones, 
airplanes—that that is the single most 
important thing we can do to save lives 
and give Ukrainian military fighters, 
the civilian soldiers we talked about— 
professional 
soldiers—give 
them 
a 
chance, give them a fighting chance. 
Other countries on the frontlines also 
need to know we are with them, espe-
cially our NATO allies, because they 
are nervous, as you can imagine. While 
in Poland, we met with hundreds of 
82nd Airborne troops who have come to 
Poland in the past couple of weeks, 
along with some troops from other 
NATO countries. We have gone from 
about 5,000 U.S. troops in Poland to 
about 10,000 troops over the past couple 
weeks, and the Polish Government and 
the Polish people are deeply appre-
ciative. They believe that this it is a 
deterrent to Russia making an even 
bigger mistake and coming into their 
country. 
We received extensive briefings from 
the Polish Government but also from 
the 82nd Airborne, and we were able to 
join troops for dinner to hear directly 
from them. I was fortunate there were 
a lot of Ohioans there, and hearing 
from them made me very, very proud 
that they were willing to step forward 
and serve their country in this way. 
We listened carefully to everybody. 
We listened to the refugees, listened to 
the humanitarian aid workers, listened 
to the U.S. diplomats, to the military 
experts, as well as the Polish military 
officials. There were differences of 
opinion, to be sure, on some of the spe-
cifics but actually broad agreement on 
the ongoing role the United States can 
play. 
Based on what we learned, the fol-
lowing steps should be taken imme-
diately. First, on the military side, we 
have got to redouble our efforts to pro-
vide Ukraine with the equipment and 
the munitions they need and, where 
necessary, the immediate training to 
provide the air defenses they need to 
give them better capability—defense 
and offense. 
Whether to facilitate providing more 
MiG–29s from Poland or not has been 
hotly debated in this past week. In my 
view, we should have done it when it 
got that initial green light from part of 
this Biden administration because the 
Ukrainians asked for them, and I don’t 
believe they are any more escalatory, 
certainly, than the escalation the Rus-
sians are engaged in virtually every 
day and what we have done and con-
tinue to do on other weapon transfers. 
So we should have done it immediately 
and quietly. But the administration 
seems to have dug in on this for now, 
and it has become too much of a public 
debate. I would hope that at least they 
would facilitate spare parts and other 
assistance to keep the current Ukrain-
ian planes flying. 
Perhaps more promising is to imme-
diately help Ukraine bolster its anti- 
air systems. The United States can and 
should facilitate the transfer of Soviet- 
era anti-aircraft and anti-missile sys-
tems so the Ukrainians know how to 
operate them. And there are a number 
of regional partners that have this 
equipment. 
Without 
going 
into 
detail, 
this 
should also include extra munitions to 
replenish existing anti-air batteries

that the Ukrainians have. In conjunc-
tion with transferring anti-air systems 
and aircraft, we need to continue to 
provide Stingers and enhancements to 
them. 
All can be useful in shooting down 
the Russian fighters and the missiles 
that are raining bombs on innocent 
Ukraine civilians and causing so much 
needless death and destruction. We 
must find ways to quickly provide 
Ukraine with more armed drones, such 
as the Turkish TB2, which the Ukrain-
ians know how to use and have been 
devastatingly effective on the battle-
field already. 
Especially now that Congress has 
passed the omnibus spending bill with 
a bump-up for defense and specific ad-
ditional security systems for Ukraine 
and higher drawdown authority for the 
President, there can be no excuse for a 
gap in the flow of arms to Ukraine. We 
want to be sure that this is seamless. 
As we complete one tranche of help to 
Ukraine, there cannot be a gap before 
we do another. We must move more 
quickly. Ukraine needs this help. It is 
a matter of hours and days, not a mat-
ter of weeks or months. 
In addition to the items mentioned 
above, this also means more anti-tank 
Javelin missiles but also small arms, 
munitions, body armor, communica-
tions equipment, anti-tank, mining, 
anti-ship weapons, and more so the 
brave Ukrainian soldiers can continue 
to protect their country and their citi-
zens. 
Before I talk about the second part of 
this, which is the humanitarian side of 
this effort, I would like to ask my col-
leagues, whom I see are here on the 
floor with me, if they have any com-
ments particularly about what Ukraine 
needs right now in terms of military 
assistance to be able to be effective or 
other comments that they might have. 
Mr. WICKER. Would the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. PORTMAN. The gentleman will 
yield. 
Mr. WICKER. And perhaps we can 
proceed in colloquy form. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. HAS-
SAN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
thank my dear friend from Ohio, and I 
see that we have been joined by my 
friend from Connecticut. 
We did have a bipartisan American 
delegation 
in 
Poland 
and 
on 
the 
Ukrainian border this weekend. I don’t 
recommend, for tourism purposes, a 
weekend trip to Eastern Europe and 
back. It is pretty hard on the anatomy. 
But I think we flew the colors for the 
United States, for the U.S. Senate, and 
made a bipartisan point. 
And my colleagues can speak for 
themselves about exactly where they 
come down on these issues, but it was 
clear from the statements we made 
that the United States can do more and 
should be doing more. 
And I call on the administration to-
night to listen to the learned words of 
the distinguished Senator from Ohio. 
Yes, I support the MiGs from Poland 
and from other Eastern European coun-
tries. I think the debate got awfully 
heightened. I don’t know why we need-
ed to have an international discussion 
among allies about that rather than 
just do it. And maybe that should be a 
lesson to us on other decisions, which I 
hope we are about to make, but there 
are certainly other weapons that we 
can facilitate in delivering. 
Does it make any sense to say that 
smaller weapons delivered from the 
United States are OK to fire against 
the Russian aggressors in Putin’s war, 
but more effective MiG aircraft from 
NATO somehow would be escalatory? 
Listen, our friends are in a war 
against the remaining dictator and ty-
rant on the face of the Earth; and if we 
are not willing—as we are not—to get 
involved directly in that war, yes, we 
ought to give our friends the weapons 
they need to win. 
Let me say this: I hear debate in the 
newspaper and on the media—even 
today—about an off-ramp, what Putin 
would agree to, to simply quit fighting: 
If we give him some of the territory 
that he thinks he has already con-
quered, Ukraine would get to have part 
of their country, and everything would 
be OK. It makes me feel like, somehow, 
I have been transported to 1938 and 
1939, hearing talk about what Adolf 
Hitler might agree to, to avoid a world 
war. 
Madam President, it is my under-
standing that the distinguished major-
ity leader has a unanimous consent re-
quest, and I am willing to defer our de-
bate at this point to accommodate 
some administrative matters that need 
to be taken care of. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
want to thank my friend and colleague 
from Mississippi, as well as my friend 
and colleague from Ohio and from Con-
necticut. 
We have one very important unani-
mous consent request that I will men-
tion now and ask that unanimous con-
sent request and then do the other ones 
as well. It will take a few minutes, and 
I appreciate that.

sian Federation, condemning Vladimir 
Putin, and expressing the sense of the 
Senate condemning the Russian Fed-
eration, Putin, and members of Rus-
sian security council, Russian Armed 
Forces, and Russian military com-
manders for committing atrocities, al-
leged war crimes against the people of 
Ukraine. 
It has been 19 days—19 long, bloody 
days since the war erupted on the Eu-
ropean continent. Today, all of us in 
this Chamber join together as Demo-
crats and Republicans to say that 
Vladimir Putin cannot escape account-
ability for the atrocities committed 
against the Ukrainian people. The leg-
islation passing today, championed by 
Senator GRAHAM, sends an unmistak-
able message that the United States 
stands with Ukraine, stands against 
Putin, and stands with all efforts to 
hold Putin accountable for the atroc-
ities levied upon the Ukrainian people. 
Putin is not winning militarily, so 
now, this evil man is trying to win by 
massacring civilians, massacring ba-
bies, parents, the elderly, pregnant 
women, shooting at hospitals, sending 
missiles to hospitals, apartment build-
ings, et cetera—just as he did in Syria, 
just as he did in Chechnya—wiping out 
the civilian population in hopes of win-
ning. 
But in his monomaniacal hubris, 
Putin has severely underestimated the 
Ukrainian people. Every time an inno-
cent Ukrainian is killed, the resolve of 
the Ukrainian people grows stronger. 
And we stand with them. 
We have all seen the images, heard 
the stories, and watched the videos of 
the reality of this awful war. Hun-
dreds—maybe even thousands—of civil-
ians have been killed, as I said, from 
the elderly all the way down to babies 
not even a month old. These atrocities 
deserve to be investigated for war 
crimes. 
Entire cities with hundreds of thou-
sands of people have been left with no 
water, no power, no connection to the 
outside world. Unable to overtake 
Ukraine in a quick strike, Russian 
forces seem to be openly targeting sites 
that have little military significance. 
Today, I am proud to ask unanimous 
consent and ask all of my colleagues to 
support today’s legislation condemning 
Putin’s atrocities and supporting ef-
forts to hold him accountable before 
the eyes of the entire world. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of S. Res 546, submitted 
earlier today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
clerk read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 546) expressing the 
sense of the Senate condemning the Russian 
Federation, President Vladimir Putin, mem-
bers of the Russian Security Council, the 
Russian Armed Forces, and Russian military 
commanders for committing atrocities, in-
cluding alleged war crimes, against the peo-
ple of Ukraine and others. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I know of no further 
debate on the resolution.

f 
UKRAINE 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
thank the distinguished majority lead-
er for working with the distinguished 
minority leader and with Senator GRA-
HAM for bringing this important legis-
lation to the floor tonight. 
It says what many of us have been 
saying for a long time and which I wish 
the President of the United States, our 
Commander in Chief, would explicitly 
say tonight or tomorrow: that Vladi-
mir Putin is a serial war criminal and 
that he should be investigated by the 
war crimes authorities internationally, 
brought to justice, and made to pay 
not only for his genocide and war 
crimes of the last 21⁄2 weeks but also for 
Aleppo and Grozny and the tens of 
thousands—tens of thousands—of inno-
cent civilians that he has killed by his 
desires out of some other century to 
conquer his neighbors. 
I was mentioning 1938 and 1939. When 
Hitler went into the Sudetenland, he 
told naive Western governments: That 
will be the end of it. If we get that, we 
will have peace in our time. 
And some leaders of the allies were 
convinced that that was true. 
Vladimir Putin hasn’t even said he is 
going to stop with Ukraine. So who in 
the world thinks that if he gets away 
with this, he will stop there? I don’t be-
lieve he will, and here is why: Not only 
Aleppo, not only Grozny, but this is a 
man who, without question, poisons his 
political opponents. When they leave 
the country to get medical treatment, 
he causes them to be charged for 
breaking the terms of their parole and 
puts them in prison. That is his polit-
ical opponent, Mr. Navalny, who had 
the temerity to be a candidate for 
President against Mr. Putin. 
We are talking about the Vladimir 
Putin who authorizes the assassination 
of former members of the Russian Gov-
ernment because they have the temer-
ity to oppose him. We are talking 
about the very same person in Vladi-
mir Putin who jails persons for years 
and years who dare to oppose him or 
disagree with him publicly, who in-
vents enormous lies and gets some peo-
ple even in the West to believe it when 
he 
broadcasts 
the 
enormous 
lies 
through his monopoly of the media.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1187 
March 15, 2022 
This man can be stopped in this 
Ukrainian war, and we are going to 
hear tomorrow morning from a coura-
geous leader who has risen beyond the 
expectations of so many people in the 
free world, President Zelenskyy, and I 
intend to be there along with my col-
leagues wishing him the best. 
I think I can say for our delegation 
that we might have nuances on how 
these things can be done, but we are 
united on ideas, like getting the Polish 
MiGs somehow into the hands of the 
Ukrainian fighter pilots who can then 
use them to win the war, the equip-
ment from other NATO countries and 
European 
countries 
enhancing 
Ukraine’s air defense, and sending 
more troops to harden the borders and 
the eastern flank of our NATO Allies. 
I would say to the President of the 
United States: Mr. Biden, you have 
been too risk averse, too late from 
time to time, from step to step on all 
of the sanctions that we have needed, 
on the delivery of weapons. 
We 
brought 
the 
administration 
along, but they have been a day late or 
a couple of days late or a week late. It 
is time for us to show international 
leadership on this. Even today, almost 
3 weeks into the war, we have not yet 
dropped the full load of sanctions on 
Russia. We need to do that, and I call 
on the President and the administra-
tion to listen to those of us who were 
just in Eastern Europe. 
History shows that weakness breeds 
war, 
instead 
of 
pacifying 
tyrants, 
weakness 
emboldens 
tyrants 
like 
Vladimir Putin. The good news is that 
with the help of NATO and Western 
arms, the Ukrainian military has de-
fied all expectations. The intelligence 
reports that we have heard on the pub-
lic media—this is nothing secret—was 
that in 3 or 4 days the Ukrainian mili-
tary would be overrun by this vast Rus-
sian military behemoth. 
That has not happened, in fact. These 
people, defending their homeland, de-
fending their country, through the 
leadership 
of 
President 
Volodymyr 
Zelenskyy, have shown courage. They 
refuse to flee, and they have rallied the 
American people and the entire world 
in a lesson of leadership. 
If President Zelenskyy survives until 
the morning, I will be cheering him 
from Capitol Hill on his remarks, just 
as the British Parliament did last 
week. This war is far from over. Suf-
fering and dying refugees will continue 
every day, and I call on President 
Biden to recognize that Vladimir Putin 
is not simply at war with Ukraine, but 
they are at war with the entire free 
world, and this is our best opportunity 
to stop him. Our Baltic allies in NATO 
understand this. They know they can 
be next on Putin’s kill list. 
Now is our moment to make sure this 
is the last time that Putin and his band 
of war criminals invade a sovereign 
country. We watched it happen with 
the Transnistria. We watched it happen 
with the Republic of Georgia, in South 
Ossetia, and in Abkhazia. We watched 
it happen with the Donbas and with 
Crimea. 
It is time to stop Vladimir Putin’s 
expansionism. We should be enabling 
the Ukrainians to defend their own air-
space, and we have not yet done all we 
can do. We need to be creative, but we 
need to take calculated risks because 
the future of the rules-based world 
order is at stake. 
Western deterrence has so far failed, 
and now Putin is thinking he can suc-
ceed in shredding the rule book of the 
post-Cold War international order. It is 
up to us, and it is up to our Com-
mander In Chief to restore faith in that 
order and to protect the free world. 
And I am glad to be joined on the 
floor with my friend the distinguished 
senior Senator from Connecticut and 
was honored to join him and our other 
colleagues on the trip this last week-
end to Eastern Europe. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to thank my really distin-
guished and able colleague and friend 
from Ohio, Senator PORTMAN, and Sen-
ator WICKER, and also Senator KLO-
BUCHAR, who accompanied us on this 
trip and enabled us to be so much more 
effective because of her very perceptive 
and insightful wisdom on these topics 
and her experience with the issues that 
we confronted, and a special thanks to 
Senator PORTMAN
for so ably orga-
nizing us and also to enable us to meet 
with senior members of the Polish Gov-
ernment, our own Ambassador, Mark 
Brzezinski, who is doing such a great 
job there, along with his team at the 
embassy, the brave men and women of 
the 
82nd 
Airborne 
Division 
and, 
heartbreakingly, the women and chil-
dren who are fleeing Ukraine with 
nothing more than what they could 
carry on their backs. 
I want to thank, as well, Senator 
SCHUMER for bringing to the floor this 
resolution, and Senator GRAHAM for his 
leadership. This resolution is a very 
powerful and compelling message to 
the world that the United States will 
stand strongly with the people of 
Ukraine against this brutal, insidious 
invasion by Vladimir Putin and Russia. 
And, tomorrow, we will hear from 
President Zelenskyy, whose passionate 
and powerful plea for action will no 
doubt elicit more words of support. But 
we need more than words now. We need 
more than declarations of support. We 
need action—action that will make a 
difference on the battlefield. And let 
me just say very bluntly and simply: 
The Ukrainian resistance has proved to 
be more courageous, resilient, tough, 
and effective than Vladimir Putin ever 
imagined. 
It has become the wonder and admi-
ration of the world. It is not only their 
trained army, it is the men and women 
who took to the streets and the fields 
using weapons that we have supplied— 
the Stinger and Javelin missiles—to 
hit Russia’s most advanced weapons 
system, their aircraft, as well as their 
tanks, and take them out. 
If the Ukrainian people have a fair 
fight on the ground, they will win. 
They will drive Russia out of their pre-
cious land. But right now there is no 
fair fight. Right now, in the skies, 
Putin dominates. He has the aircraft, 
the missiles, to do insidious damage 
and to wound, damage, and destroy the 
Ukrainian ground forces. 
And he was using that air superiority 
with consummate recklessness while 
we were in Poland. Just hours before 
we visited the border crossing at 
Korczowa, 30 of his missiles rained 
down on a training center in Yavoriv, 
12 miles away. Let me repeat: 12 miles 
away from that border crossing. The 
Polish authorities there told us the 
ground shook with the tremor of those 
bombs hitting a training center just 12 
miles from the Polish border. 
Vladimir Putin was literally playing 
with fire. One of those missiles going 
astray into Poland could have trig-
gered dramatic escalation, nuclear con-
frontation, and destruction of unknown 
magnitude. 
Vladimir Putin is recklessly taking 
this fight westward in Ukraine, to the 
very border, the very doorstep of a 
NATO ally that we have an obligation 
to defend. And part of our trip was to 
visit with the 82nd Airborne—so im-
pressive, these young men and women, 
in their intelligence, as well as their 
dedication and bravery. They are hold-
ing the line. More and more of them 
are there. And they are also enabling 
support for Ukraine in the kind of 
arms—Stingers and Javelins—that are 
needed. 
But we must do more than what we 
are doing now. And in that respect, I 
join my colleagues. We have a common 
message. I personally appreciate what 
the administration has done in its pro-
viding 
support—those 
Javelin 
and 
Stinger 
missiles, 
the 
ammunition, 
night goggles, drone spare parts and 
more—but we must do more to counter 
that air superiority, the dominance in 
Putin’s missiles and jet fighters. 
I personally believe that we should 
provide more aircraft, the jet fighters 
that President Zelenskyy has des-
perately requested. But I also think 
there are tools that we can provide: 
anti-air batteries to bring down the 
planes and the missiles, defense mecha-
nisms that Vladimir Putin cannot call 
escalatory under any possible defini-
tion, and, likewise, means of defense 
that the people of Ukraine desperately 
need and deserve to successfully de-
fend. 
There is no way any of these weapon 
systems are offensive. They are defen-
sive, whether it is planes, Stinger and 
Javelin missiles, drones—all of it is to 
defend their country and do it effec-
tively and have a fair fight on the 
ground against Putin’s air dominance. 
We saw, heartrendingly, women and 
children coming from that bombing in 
Yavoriv at the border crossing. Lit-
erally, we visited with them, spoke 
with them, saw and heard the grief and 
misery, the tragedy and trauma that 
they are enduring.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1188 
March 15, 2022 
Almost all were women and children 
because the men have stayed to fight, 
and they brought with them bags of 
clothing, their pets, stuffed animals— 
all they could carry but no more—fac-
ing a future of total uncertainty, not 
knowing when, if at all, they would re-
turn, and when, if at all, they would 
see their husbands, brothers, sons who 
were left to fight. 
We must make sure that Ukraine 
stays in that fight, and we can do it if 
we raise our commitment. 
I appreciate what the administration 
has done in its skillful use of public in-
telligence, its uniting of our allies, its 
adroit rallying of America, but now is 
the time to do more, and it must be 
done urgently. The time is now. Days, 
weeks—not on our side. Time works 
against us the longer we allow Putin to 
command the skies in the way that he 
does now, the longer innocent people 
will be slaughtered in their homes, in 
hospital, in maternity wards, and the 
longer the world will be put at risk of 
another attack on a nuclear facility 
that could spread radioactive contami-
nation throughout the country and 
even through Europe. 
The trauma and terror on the faces of 
those women and children, the tears 
that we saw, will stay with me forever. 
I was reminded of my own family, my 
dad who came to this country in 1935 to 
escape the Holocaust. He, too, came 
with not much more than the shirt on 
his 
back. 
He 
spoke 
virtually 
no 
English. He knew no one. He brought 
his entire family—his immediate fam-
ily, but he lost much of his other fam-
ily. 
America has always been a nation of 
immigrants and refugees, and we have 
always spread our generosity to them, 
and now, likewise, in Connecticut we 
see the Ukrainian-American commu-
nity providing clothing and blankets, 
donations, along with the Polish-Amer-
ican community. Indeed, throughout 
the State of Connecticut and through-
out the country, America’s hearts are 
going out to these refugees in this hu-
manitarian crisis. That is what we do 
in America. 
That is what we saw, in fact, Ameri-
cans and others doing at the World 
Central Kitchen in the reception area 
that we visited. My colleagues and I 
served chicken, vegetables, rice, pota-
toes for a couple more hours to these 
refugees, and we had, I think, a tre-
mendously uplifting experience. 
I mention it because, as Senator 
PORTMAN has said so eloquently, even 
in the midst of this evil, we saw good 
in that team at the World Central 
Kitchen; in the 82nd Airborne; our men 
and women in uniform; and the Em-
bassy staff who were willing to risk 
their lives in Kyiv and stay in Lviv and 
finally move from Lviv to Warsaw; our 
Foreign Service; our men and women 
in uniform; and of course the people of 
Poland who have welcomed these refu-
gees, literally welcomed them into 
their homes, 2 million of them, 10 per-
cent or more of the population of War-
saw alone—an effort of unprecedented 
magnitude in recent history. 
And as we returned home, so grateful 
for the good in those people, it was 
brought on me again to realize that 
this invasion was a war of choice. That 
evil in Moscow is one man. 
I still believe the Russian people, if 
they knew what was going on in 
Ukraine, would throw him out. That is 
not to say that he should be assas-
sinated or that he should be attacked. 
I believe that if there were a demo-
cratic process with full and fair infor-
mation in Russia, there is no way that 
Vladimir Putin would survive a democ-
racy. 
And so I think we must continue to 
tighten the economic sanctions to 
bring that pain home to the Russians 
to make them feel the hurt they have 
inflicted on others and to know that 
they have a responsibility to end this 
conflict. 
They must do more, as we must do 
more, and our action must tighten and 
broaden economic sanctions to stop 
Vladimir Putin from continuing to 
reap the revenue of sales of oil and gas. 
I commend the administration for 
stopping importation of Russian oil 
and gas to this country, but other 
Western countries continue to do it 
and other countries around the world, 
and therefore I am partnering in a 
measure with Senator BLACKBURN of 
Tennessee, urging the President to 
work with our allies to halt Russia’s 
ability to sell its oil and gas on West-
ern markets, to stop the connection of 
all Russian banks to the SWIFT finan-
cial system, which is the means for 
him to reap that revenue. 
If he is cut off from it, his ability to 
sell that oil and gas and reap the rev-
enue and finance, his war machine is 
broken. 
And a bill—a second measure—intro-
duced today with Senators WHITE-
HOUSE, GRAHAM, and my colleague from 
Mississippi Senator WICKER, provides 
the President with authority to seize 
and sell all of the superyachts, the jets, 
mansions, and luxury possessions of 
Putin’s criminal kleptocracy as well as 
his cronies, his family, and others. 
These ill-begotten gains will be used to 
support Ukrainian freedom fighters, re-
build Ukraine, and provide humani-
tarian assistance to those refugees we 
saw escaping. 
I have no illusions that Putin can be 
forced right away to the negotiating 
table, but these measures will eventu-
ally force him to respond. 
We must give the people of Ukraine a 
fair fight. We must act immediately to 
provide them with the support they 
need to stop Putin’s war in the air. 
Much as Winston Churchill rallied 
Britain in the Battle of Britain to sur-
vive and resolve at the beginning of 
World War II in the Battle of Britain to 
resist Hitler’s onslaught from the air, 
so, too, the people of Ukraine are fight-
ing their battle, and we must respond 
with action. Our security is at peril. 
Our defense is at risk. The economic 
implications are perilous, and the 
world order is threatened. 
This time is a turning point, and we 
must enable Ukraine to chart its own 
course to remain as a free and sov-
ereign nation and to have a fair fight. 
I yield the floor, and I yield back to 
my colleague from Mississippi. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. The Senator from Con-
necticut is correct to commend the 
massive efforts to prevent the humani-
tarian suffering in Ukraine and in Po-
land. 
The dozens of nongovernmental orga-
nizations, such as the World Food 
Kitchen, the USAID Agency, a part of 
our Federal Government, the World 
Food 
Programme, 
the 
diplomatic 
corps, both of the United States and 
our allies, and certainly our American 
military, the 82nd Airborne. 
But let me conclude by making this 
profoundly important point: What we 
have heard tonight on both sides of the 
aisle are bipartisan calls for us to do 
more. 
In this system that we have under 
our Constitution, we have one Com-
mander in Chief at a time, and we have 
heard from Democrats and Republicans 
tonight on the floor of the U.S. Senate 
that we need to do more. This adminis-
tration needs to do more. This Com-
mander in Chief can do more and needs 
to do more to help this small country 
preserve their freedom, to win against 
this war criminal and his unprovoked 
aggression, and to preserve the inter-
national order that has governed civ-
ilized nations for decades and decades. 
I hope the administration is hearing 
the bipartisan message that we bring 
back from our observations and that 
we are hearing from our constituents. 
I yield back to my dear friend from 
Ohio. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, 
first I want to say that I appreciate my 
colleagues being on the floor tonight 
and their really moving statements 
about the crisis in Ukraine and the 
atrocities that are being committed 
there. 
And I think what you did tonight is 
you added a lot of texture and perspec-
tive to the resolution that just passed 
this body by a unanimous vote. Nobody 
objected. We are now on record here in 
this body with a strong statement of 
support for Ukraine and strong opposi-
tion to the atrocities being committed 
and our commitment to do more. 
So, again, I appreciated being with 
you in Poland, and I appreciated your 
coming to the floor tonight. 
I am going to pick up where I had left 
off and talk a little more about what 
we can do because that is the real ques-
tion that faces us here in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
We talked a lot about military assist-
ance tonight, and we, again, I think, 
had a consensus among us as to what 
we need to do to help the Ukrainians

March 15, 2022 
protect themselves, particularly from 
the aerial assault that they are under. 
I know we also have another col-
league who couldn’t be here on the 
floor because of scheduling concerns, as 
I said earlier, Senator KLOBUCHAR, but 
she will be making a statement for the 
record that will go along with our 
statements tonight. I look forward to 
seeing that. 
The four of us got in at about mid-
night last night, and we come back 
with a heavy heart but also lots of ad-
vice for our government as to how we 
can do more. 
On the humanitarian side, the United 
States has got a key role to play as 
well, not just on military assistance 
but on ensuring that people who are 
fleeing this conflict and people inter-
nally displaced have the help they 
need. 
We support our European partners 
who have opened their homes, as I said 
earlier, and their borders to Ukrainian 
refugees. In fact, they have provided a 
3-year visa, in essence, to Ukrainians 
in the European Union and permission 
to work, and this is, I think, a strong 
signal of the special relationship that 
the countries of the EU feel toward 
Ukraine, which I hope someday will be 
a member of the European Union, as do 
they. 
Congress just passed some immediate 
help for Ukraine. It was in legislation 
called the Omnibus appropriations bill 
a few days ago. That will help AID here 
in the United States and other organi-
zations around the world be able to 
help with these refugees and help those 
Ukrainians who are trapped in cities 
under siege. To me this is the No. 1 pri-
ority right now. 
Cities like Mariupol—you probably 
read that people have been without 
food and water for days—for days. 
There was a child—a girl, apparently— 
who died of dehydration recently, and 
others are going to be finding them-
selves in an impossible situation, not 
knowing where their next meal may 
come from. So we need to help them, 
particularly in these cities in the east 
and the south of the country that are 
under such terrible siege and being sur-
rounded. 
This is an unprecedented humani-
tarian disaster, and it is being caused 
by 
Vladimir 
Putin’s 
attack 
on 
Ukraine—Vladimir Putin’s war and 
Russia’s war. The actions that they 
have undertaken have created the larg-
est movement of refugees in Europe 
since World War II. That is already. By 
the way, I favor seizing, rather than 
freezing, the assets of Kremlin officials 
and oligarchs and then providing those 
proceeds to the refugees. Doesn’t that 
make sense? 
So when a billionaire has his assets 
frozen, it is one thing; but when they 
are seized, as some countries have 
done—France, 
Germany—the 
United 
States needs to step up and do that as 
well. We should be leading on this, not 
following. That is another thing that 
we can do to help get proceeds to help 
with the humanitarian efforts. 
But I also have a message tonight to 
those Russian officials and to the Rus-
sian commanders on the ground, which 
is that you have a choice to make. You 
can stop this atrocity. You can refuse 
the orders to kill innocent civilians. 
You can stop this atrocity that has al-
ready taken the lives of thousands of 
civilians—men, women and children, 
your neighbors—your neighbors—some 
with family connections to Russia, who 
want nothing more than just to live in 
peace. You can stop this atrocity. Dis-
obey the orders. The world is watching, 
and the war crimes are being recorded. 
You have a choice. 
On sanctions: We talked a little bit 
about this earlier tonight, but we need 
more and faster sanctions. We need to 
remove all Russian banks from their 
access to the global financial system. 
Russia must be financially cut off from 
the rest of the world, or it won’t work. 
We have already seen the pain that we 
can inflict using a portion of our sanc-
tion authority. We need to do more. 
We need to exert maximum pressure 
to ensure no money can be sent to Rus-
sia to fund the war effort. This is one 
reason it was so important that we fi-
nally stopped the importation of Rus-
sian oil and gas. Why would we want to 
send $40- or $50 million a day, which we 
were sending to Russia to be used for 
the war machine. 
But we can implement full blocking 
sanctions on all Russian banks, and we 
can ensure that energy transactions 
are not exempt from these sanctions. 
That is very important, because right 
now there are some exemptions for en-
ergy. 
Russia should not use its oil profits 
to kill innocent Ukrainians. That 
should be our principle. We should not 
allow money to flow down like water in 
cracks in the pavement. We should pass 
legislation to ensure that these funds 
stop—and not by June 24, which is in 
the sanctions that the administration 
has put forward, but now—blocking 
sanctions now, not for the energy sec-
tor transactions on June 24. That is too 
long. 
I think we should move ahead with 
legislation to cut off most-favored-na-
tion treatment. This is the permanent 
trade relationship with Russia we 
granted back in 2012, bringing them 
into the World Trade Organization. Ac-
cess to the U.S. market is a privilege, 
not a right. And we should not only en-
sure that we are not giving Russia that 
privilege of access to our markets— 
lower tariffs of all kinds of products, 
including oil and gas—but also that 
other countries of the world follow 
suit. That way it would be much more 
effective. 
But I would like to go beyond most- 
favored-nation treatment tonight and 
suggest that we also suspend our tax 
treaty with Russia. Why would we 
want to have a tax treaty that provides 
tax benefits to Russian businesses? 
Again, our principle there could be no 
tax breaks for invaders. That would 
make more sense. 
We also need to sanction the Russian 
energy sector with currency and block-
ing sanctions, as I said, right now—not 
June 24. I know this is more difficult 
on the Europeans who are more de-
pendent on Russia for energy, but there 
are many steps the United States can 
take to help expand energy production 
here at home and help our allies 
abroad. 
I met with someone today who is try-
ing to set up LNG terminals in places 
like Germany and also Ireland and 
other countries to bring liquefied nat-
ural gas to Europe. We have plenty of 
natural gas in this country. We are 
blessed with it. We should use it to 
help our allies. 
Finally, I would like to advocate for 
a similar approach to how we des-
ignated Iranian entities in 2018, when 
we left the JCPOA. We did not issue 
sanctions or waivers to European com-
panies that continued to do business 
with Iran’s economy. We forced those 
companies to leave Iran’s market, even 
at the displeasure of some of those gov-
ernments. The bottom line: It can’t be 
business as usual. 
There is a popular Ukrainian na-
tional rallying cry, ‘‘Slava Ukraini!’’ 
When translated into English, it means 
‘‘Glory to Ukraine.’’ ‘‘Slava Ukraini.’’ 
There is a response to that rallying 
cry, which is ‘‘Glory to the Heroes.’’ 
‘‘Heroiam Slava.’’ So ‘‘Slava Ukraini’’ 
and in response, ‘‘Heroiam Slava.’’ 
And even in these dark times, there 
are many heroes. While we heard first-
hand about the worst of humanity rep-
resented by the brutal bombings of ci-
vilian targets, we also saw the best of 
humanity at work. And we saw acts of 
kindness and generosity: Polish border 
guards helping carry suitcases of moth-
ers who were overwhelmed as they car-
ried young children in their arms, flee-
ing from the only home they have ever 
known; volunteers at the reception 
center where they provided healthcare 
and lodging and served thousands of 
meals a day to frightened and bewil-
dered families who were waiting to 
move on to homes that generous Poles, 
Germans, and others in the EU had 
opened up for them. 
In the midst of this atrocity, there 
are so many heroes to glorify in 
Ukraine. Yes, glory to the heroes: the 
brave border guards on Snake Island; 
the grandmother bravely walking up to 
Russian soldiers and handing them 
sunflower seeds, saying: If you don’t 
leave, this is so that something beau-
tiful will grow on your grave; the cou-
rageous President of Ukraine who when 
asked by western countries if they 
could help him escape, responded sim-
ply: ‘‘I need ammunition, not a ride.’’ 
‘‘I need ammunition, not a ride.’’ 
President Zelenskyy’s bravery and 
resilience has been an inspiration to 
Ukrainians and freedom-loving people 
everywhere. Tomorrow, he will be here 
virtually in a joint session of Congress 
to talk to all of us, and I look forward 
to it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1190 
March 15, 2022 
Glory to the everyday heroes who are 
caring for the wounded, feeding des-
perate families huddling in basements 
and subway stations, glory to the pro-
fessional soldiers and citizens alike 
who have taken up arms and are put-
ting their lives on the line to defend 
their beloved homeland in the cause of 
freedom, against great odds. Glory to 
the heroes. Heroiam Slava. Godspeed to 
them in their battle for a free and inde-
pendent Ukraine. 
Some may ask—and some of my col-
leagues here have asked me: Why does 
a Senator from Ohio get involved in 
Ukraine? Why do you care? Well, tens 
of thousands of Ukrainian Americans 
call Ohio home, as do hundreds of thou-
sands of others who trace their family 
to that part of the world; and it is an 
honor to represent them and their val-
ues. 
I stood together with a thousand fel-
low Ohioans at a prayer service and 
rallied for Ukraine 2 weeks ago in 
Parma, OH, just outside of Cleveland. 
We prayed for family and friends in 
Ukraine who are in harm’s way. We 
prayed for the courageous Ukrainian 
troops and asked for God’s wisdom and 
blessing on the duly elected Govern-
ment of Ukraine and, of course, for the 
protection of President Zelenskyy. 
Ohioans like Andy Futey and Marta 
Liscynesky are rallying support across 
our State and coordinating efforts to 
provide humanitarian relief to those in 
need in Ukraine and in neighboring Eu-
ropean countries. They are heading up 
through the United Ukrainian Organi-
zations of Ohio a fund called the Fund 
to Aid Ukraine. I contributed to it. 
They do great work. 
Two weeks ago, Sunday, I was hon-
ored to speak at an emotional rally in 
Washington, DC, much like the one in 
Parma, OH, only larger. Again, many 
Ohioans were there. And this past 
weekend 
on 
the 
border 
between 
Ukraine and Poland, Ohioans were 
there volunteering. 
But even if I didn’t have a single con-
stituent of Ukrainian descent, I would 
be standing shoulder to shoulder with 
the people of Ukraine because this 
fight is our fight. This is where, in our 
generation at this time, all freedom- 
loving people are called to defend what 
we hold dear. 
Eight years ago, Ukrainians made a 
choice. They stood up to a corrupt Rus-
sian-backed government. They stood 
up for freedom, for free markets, for 
peace and prosperity, and for the rule 
of law. They looked to America, and 
they looked to the EU. They chose 
freedom over tyranny. They chose a de-
mocracy over an authoritarian regime. 
I was there in 2014, right after the 
Heavenly Hundred who stood up to the 
corrupt 
Russian-backed 
government 
were killed in what was called the 
Euromaidan or the Revolution of Dig-
nity. I saw firsthand then the commit-
ment the people of Ukraine had to free-
dom and independence, to charting 
their own course. 
Right now, those friends in Ukraine 
need our help. We cannot let this call 
to action go unanswered. We cannot sit 
by and watch as innocent civilians are 
brutally killed. 
America and our allies must stand up 
for freedom, and the world is watching. 
Our friends are watching. Our adver-
saries are watching. We must show 
them 
that 
America 
stands 
with 
Ukraine. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, I want to add one more quotation 
to the very stirring and powerful words 
that my colleague from Ohio has just 
given us. 
Decades ago, President John F. Ken-
nedy went to Berlin, and in a state-
ment of resolve and commitment that 
mobilized the world, he said then, ‘‘I 
am a Berliner.’’ And he spoke for 
America. 
Today, we are all Ukrainians. Just as 
he said that he, as an American, was a 
Berliner, today, we are Ukrainian. 
My colleague from Ohio is absolutely 
right that this fight is ours and there 
are actions we can take—not just 
words—that will make a difference: ac-
tions that should not and will not in-
volve American troops or an escalatory 
response, actions that will be in the 
best tradition of the United States, 
going back to our own Revolution 
when we overcame a more massive 
British force. We didn’t need to defeat 
them; we simply needed to survive. 
And by surviving, George Washington 
understood that the British would be 
defeated. 
And so we can enable resilience and 
resolve of the Ukrainian people to de-
feat the Russians, if we give them what 
we need, if we give them more of what 
we have been giving them. And today, 
truly, this bell tolls for us; and it is the 
world’s fight, not just the Ukrainians’. 
I thank my friend and fellow Senator 
from Ohio for leading us on this trip, 
and I hope that our colleagues, a few of 
them may have heard us tonight at 
this hour—but I hope they will come to 
the floor and that we will continue this 
conversation because it is a debate 
that really unites all of us across the 
aisle, as did the resolution which 
passed overwhelmingly. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E253 
March 15, 2022 
SUSPENDING ENERGY IMPORTS 
FROM RUSSIA ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, the world is in 
awe of the Ukrainian people, who have shown 
extraordinary courage and an iron will in the 
face of Russia’s unprovoked war. 
As we speak, they are putting their lives on 
the line to protect their sovereignty and terri-
torial integrity, protect their families, and de-
fend their democracy. 
Indeed, the entire country—parents and chil-
dren, rich and poor, in big cities and in small 
towns—have come together to safeguard their 
heritage and their home. 
Tragically, Putin has met their heroism with 
accelerating brutality: reportedly bombing in-
discriminately and attacking civilians, including 
children. 
In doing so, the world has seen what the 
United Nations has deemed the ‘‘fastest grow-
ing refugee crisis in Europe since World War 
II.’’ 
At this pivotal moment, America will not be 
delayed or deterred in taking action to counter 
Putin’s aggression and support the Ukrainian 
people. 
With historic speed and coordination with 
our allies and partners, America has led the 
international community in taking devastating 
action against Russia. 
We have crippled the Russian economy: 
cutting off its banks, choking off its access to 
technology, targeting oligarchs funding this 
war—and much more. 
We have bolstered our support for NATO— 
and today the House will pass $13.6 billion in 
new funding for Ukraine for humanitarian, mili-
tary and economic assistance. 
And now, the House will take major and se-
vere step to continue our ongoing efforts to 
hold Putin accountable for his aggression. 
By passing the strong, bipartisan Sus-
pending Energy Imports from Russia Act, we 
will further isolate Russia from the global 
economy and leave it weaker in every way. 
For their relentless leadership in crafting this 
legislation, let us salute Congressmen LLOYD 
DOGGETT and EARL BLUMENAUER. 
And thank you to Ways and Means Chair-
man RICHIE NEAL for his masterful work to 
steer this urgent package to the Floor. 
This legislation contains three primary provi-
sions. 
First, we are banning the import of Russian 
oil and energy products into the United States. 
This will tighten our stranglehold on Russia 
by cutting off the lifeblood of its economy— 
and a major source of Putin’s wealth. Con-
gress commends President Biden for an-
nouncing this step in his remarks today—and 
we will support his initiative with this legisla-
tion. 
At the same time, American production of oil 
and gas is approaching record highs—and we 
will continue working to protect families from 
Putin’s Price Hike. In the long-term, America 
must move to diversify our energy sources: to 
defend democracy, protect our planet and 
bring down energy costs for our families. 
Second, we are taking steps to review Rus-
sia’s access to the World Trade Organization. 
Access to the benefits of international trade 
is a privilege—not a right. By moving to de-
prive them of these benefits, we seek to fur-
ther diminish Russia in the global economy. 
Third, we are reauthorizing and strength-
ening the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Ac-
countability Act. 
Enacted in 2016, the Global Magnitsky Act 
broadened the human rights abuses that can 
be punished with sanctions and bolstered co-
ordination with our partners. The legislation we 
will pass today will ensure the United States 
can impose these sanctions on Russia for its 
heinous attacks on Ukrainian civilians and its 
violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial 
integrity. 
PROTECTING AMERICAN FAMILIES 
Putin’s aggression has caused severe dis-
ruption to global oil markets, helping to in-
crease prices here at home and around the 
world. 
But the United States does not need to 
choose between defending our democratic val-
ues and protecting our economic interests. 
As Congress and the Administration con-
tinue to work together to cripple the Russian 
economy, we remain laser-focused on bringing 
down energy costs for American families and 
our partners stemming from Putin’s invasion. 
We salute President Biden for leading our 
allies in releasing 60 million barrels of oil from 
strategic reserves—including 30 million from 
American reserves in the SPR—to stabilize 
global markets. 
CLOSE 
This legislation is an urgent imperative: both 
morally, to stand with Ukraine, and strategi-
cally, to ensure our security interests. 
And it is my hope that this package receives 
strong, bipartisan support worthy of the valor 
and sacrifice of the Ukrainian people. 
With that, I urge a strong, bipartisan ‘‘aye’’ 
vote.

SPEECH OF 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 9, 2022 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, the House will 
proudly pass an omnibus government funding 
bill that delivers For The People: strengthening 
national security, bolstering economic pros-
perity and advancing democratic governance. 
And this legislation will offer a strong foun-
dation on which Democrats will continue our 
focus on Building a Better America: with lower 
costs, bigger paycheck and more jobs. 
Thank you, Madam Chair ROSA DELAURO, 
for your tireless work in assembling this omni-
bus package. You have been a masterful 
force in crafting a package that will help us 
meet the needs of American families. 
Let us also salute Ranking Member KAY 
GRANGER, as well as our committed counter-
parts in the Senate: Chairman PAT LEAHY and 
Ranking Member RICHARD SHELBY. 
This legislation addresses many of the top 
priorities for our country and in our commu-
nities for the long-term. 
For families, this means strong public 
schools; clean air and water; more public 
health resources; safe food and lower costs of 
insulin. With this bill, we are especially proud 
to increase the maximum Pell Grant by $400; 
as well as establishing funding for President 
Biden’s bold new ARPA–H initiative to finally 
defeat cancer. 
For workers, it means better-paying jobs, 
support for our small businesses and a strong 
social safety net. 
For women and girls, it means the long- 
overdue 
reauthorization 
of 
the 
Violence 
Against Women Act: one of our nation’s most 
powerful tools to safeguard safety, dignity and 
rights. 
For our veterans, it means reliable benefits, 
reducing backlogs for veterans and their fami-
lies seeking assistance, and meeting the 
needs of the VA’s health care system. 
For our national security, it means honoring 
the service of our troops with improvements to 
defense readiness and modernization, strong-
er defenses against cyber attacks and pro-
moting our democratic values abroad. 
Enacting this omnibus will also unlock bil-
lions in more federal dollars under our Bipar-
tisan Infrastructure Law—delivering key invest-
ments in nearly every community across the 
country. 
Doing so will help us rebuild our nation 
while reinvigorating our middle class: creating 
millions of good-paying jobs improving roads 
and bridges, public transit, ports and airports, 
water systems and broadband, and more 
As we proceed on this legislation, war rages 
on in Ukraine. This omnibus includes $13.6 
billion in emergency supplemental funding for 
humanitarian, military and economic assist-
ance for Ukraine. 
Today, I had the privilege of an extensive 
telephone 
conversation 
with 
President 
Zelensky. It afforded me the opportunity to 
praise the extraordinary courage and resolve 
of the Ukrainian people as they defend their 
communities and their democracy. 
I also conveyed to him the sympathy of the 
Congress for the loss of life and livelihood in 
Ukraine—especially after Putin’s barbaric at-
tack on a maternity hospital, killing parents 
and children. 
He expressed the gratitude of the Ukrainian 
people for the assistance that the United 
States has provided to date. But much more 
needs to be done. This legislation takes a 
strong step forward. 
I am proud of the strong leadership of Presi-
dent Biden in his role in unifying NATO and

Public service is a noble and tireless pursuit 
aimed at improving the lives of your neighbors

SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
FINDLAY 
BEING 
NAMED 
THE 
TOP MICROPOLITAN COMMUNITY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Findlay, Ohio, for being named the Top 
Micropolitan Community in the United States 
for the eighth year in a row by Site Selection 
Magazine. Findlay has routinely shown what a 
strong community with a commitment to pros-
perity can do through implementation of their 
renowned ‘‘Findlay Formula.’’ The city’s focus 
on this formula continues to pay dividends and 
serves as an example to communities across 
the country. 
In order to be considered a micropolitan 
city, the area must have a population ranging 
from 10,000 to 50,000. Cities that qualify were 
evaluated on business growth and economic 
sustainability. Findlay was able to secure this 
award for the eighth year in a row because of 
their focus on job creation, new construction, 
and capital investment that met Site Selec-
tion’s criteria. In 2021, Findlay had an esti-
mated $160 million in capital investment and 
twenty-four qualifying projects. This investment 
has resulted in 1,600 net new employees 
hired in the Findlay area. 
Fostering a cooperative environment be-
tween businesses and local government has 
resulted in continued economic growth in Find-
lay. Over the past eight years, Findlay has 
completed over 200 projects and produced 
over 7,000 new jobs through an estimated 
$1.65 billion in investment. This success 
would not be possible without the partnership 
and cooperation between the City of Findlay, 
the Findlay-Hancock County Economic Devel-
opment office, the Hancock County Commis-
sioners, and the entire Findlay community. 
Congratulations to Findlay, for another year 
as the Nation’s top-ranked Micropolitan Com-
munity.

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and honor Ernest

Ernest is no stranger to successful seasons,

lowing his freshman year. 
Ernest led the team in tackles following his 
sophomore and junior seasons with ninety- 
seven tackles his sophomore year and eighty- 
six tackles his junior year, with five tackles for 
loss. 
The Los Angeles Rams selected Ernest with 
the 103rd pick of the 2021 NFL Draft and be-

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
UNI-
VERSAL 
PREKINDERGARTEN 
AND 
EARLY 
CHILDHOOD 
EDU-
CATION ACT OF 2022 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Universal Prekindergarten and 
Early Childhood Education Act of 2022, a 
version of which I have introduced in seven 
previous Congresses. My bill would establish 
and expand prekindergarten programs in pub-
lic and public charter schools for three- and 
four-year-old children. The prekindergarten 
years are critical for children’s brain develop-
ment. 
My bill seeks a breakthrough in public edu-
cation by providing funding for states to add 
prekindergarten for children at three and four 
years of age, like kindergarten programs for 
five-year-old children now routinely available in 
public schools. This bill would eliminate major 
shortcomings of unevenly available day care 
and, importantly, would take advantage of the 
safe facilities required in public schools. 
My bill provides federal funds to states, 
which must be matched by at least 20 percent 
of a state’s own funds, to establish or expand 
universal, voluntary prekindergarten in public 
and public charter schools, regardless of in-
come. The classes, which would be part of a 
full-day program and run throughout the entire 
school year, must be taught by teachers who 
possess equivalent qualifications to those 
teaching other grades in the school. The funds 
would supplement, not supplant, other federal 
funds for early childhood education. The 
unique moneysaving aspect of my bill is that 
it uses the existing public-school infrastructure 
and trained teachers to make early childhood 
education available to all, saving billions of 
dollars in implementation costs. 
The success of Head Start and other pre-
kindergarten programs, combined with new 
scientific evidence on the importance of brain 
development in early childhood, virtually man-
dates the expansion of early childhood edu-
cation to all children. Early learning programs 
mainly have been available only to the afflu-
ent, who can afford them, and to some low-in-
come families in programs such as Head 
Start, which would be unaffected by my bill. 
My bill provides a practical way to universal, 
public preschool education for the majority of 
families. The goal of the bill is to afford the 
benefits of early childhood education to the 
working poor, lower middle class and middle 
class, most of whom have been left out of this 
essential education for their children. 
We cannot afford to allow the most fertile 
years for childhood development to pass 
unenriched. My bill responds to the great 
needs of parents who seek early childhood 
education, as well as to today’s brain science, 
which shows that a child’s brain development 
begins much earlier than had been previously 
understood. 
Considering the staggering cost of day care, 
the inaccessibility of early childhood education 
and the opportunity that early education offers 
to improve a child’s chances of success, 
schooling for three- and four-year-old children 
is overdue. The absence of viable options for 
families demands our immediate attention. 
My bill reflects what jurisdictions throughout 
the nation increasingly are trying to accom-
plish. The District of Columbia, for example, 
has achieved an extensive integration of early 
childhood education as part of a larger effort 
to improve D.C. public schools. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation.

Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mrs. 
Teresa Vera Perez of Concepcion, Texas, 
who dedicated her life to serving the people of 
Duval County. 
Mrs. Perez was born on November 25, 
1933, to Saturnina Vera and Francisca Saenz

Mrs. Perez first ran for Justice of the Peace, 
Precinct 2 in 1977 and won, making hr the 
first female Justice of the Peace in Duval 
County history. She served a total of three 
terms, becoming a lifelong member of the 
Texas Justices of the Peace and Constables 
Association and Chaplain for the South Texas 
Association of Justices of the Peace and Con-
stables. In addition to her time serving as Jus-
tice of the Peace, Mrs. Perez also worked as 
a Nurse’s Aide at the P&S Hospital, previously 
located in Alice, Texas. Following her 12 years 
as Justice of the Peace, she continued to 
serve as an Honorable Judge by joining cou-
ples in matrimony. 
Mrs. Perez was an active member of the 
Duval County and the Concepcion commu-
nities throughout her lifetime. She proudly 
served as a Eucharistic Minister and member 
of 
the 
Immaculate 
Concepcion 
Catholic 
Church Altar and Rosary Society as well as

she is no longer with us, her memory remains 
eternal. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today to ac-
knowledge the countless achievements and 
charitable acts of Mrs. Teresa Vera Perez. 
She devoted her life to the betterment of her 
community and her legacy will be no doubt be 
remembered by all who knew her. Her general 
love for life, her family, the Lord, and commit-
ment to her neighbors is admirable. May she 
rest in peace.

March 15, 2022 
Fatally struck by a stray bullet on January 19, 
2022, I stand before you to say goodbye to 
Robert and wish him well in the next life. 
Robert was a kind, respectful and polite 
young man. He loved his family and cared 
deeply about his future. His life was not easy, 
but a rough start would not define him. He 
would work hard and chase after his dreams. 
Robert understood clearly that he would have 
to fight for every inch of progress. 
A senior at HARP Academy and a partici-
pant in the Upward Bound Program at 
Montclair University, Robert challenged him-
self academically. Often so engrossed in his 
studies, Robert chose to forgo time with his 
friends to prepare for college. He was a self- 
described homebody and favored time alone 
with his immediate family. 
While enrolled at Upward Bound, a program 
for disadvantaged high school students, Rob-
ert blossomed. Montclair University was a 
place he felt comfortable and accepted. Tak-
ing classes in subjects that inspired him and 
interacting with people who shared his inter-
ests motivated him. Robert was on track, there 
was light at the end of the tunnel. He could 
find himself and engage in the many wonder-
ful experiences that make our youth a memo-
rable time. 
As a father and grandfather, I can only 
imagine the hurt. I ask the Cuadra family to 
continue to tell stories about Robert and 
breathe life into his memory for his siblings 
and extended family. Robert’s passing is es-
pecially difficult and its tragic to have lost a 
young man with so much potential. Our com-
munity was enriched by people like him, and 
his actions set an example for all to follow. 
My heart breaks for Robert and I know he 
will be missed by many people. It is my hope 
that the love and support of friends and all 
those whose lives he touched will help the 
Cuadra family manage the loss of Robert. My 
thoughts and prayers are with all of them dur-
ing this time of mourning. Robert brought hap-
piness into our lives and everyone around 
him. 
As we honor him today, I know there are 
still many young men and women in similar 
situations. While this moment in time is unde-
niably sad, we should draw inspiration from 
his story. Robert struggled and fought to get 
ahead in life. We honor him because he re-
minds us that life can be difficult, but we 
should never give up in the face of adversity. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join our col-
leagues, friends, family, and the residents of 
New Jersey in recognizing the memory of 
Robert Daniel Cuadra. We keep him in prayer, 
and we commit to watch over his family. Rob-
ert, may he rest in peace.

AND 
CONGRATU-
LATING DR. BENJAMIN ‘‘BENJIE’’ 
SANTIAGO ON BEING SELECTED 
AS THE 2021 GUAM DEPARTMENT 
OF EDUCATION TEACHER OF THE 
YEAR 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend and congratulate Dr. Ben-
jamin ‘‘Benjie’’ Santiago on being selected as 
the 2021 Guam Department of Education 
(GDOE) Teacher of the Year. Dr. Santiago is 
an exemplary teacher whose commitment to 
service and devotion to community have and 
continue to inspire our youth, foster great 
leadership, and expand opportunities for our 
island students to lead successful lives. 
The Teacher of the Year Program is the old-
est and most prestigious national honors pro-
gram focused on recognizing excellence in 
teaching. Providing a platform for highlighting 
both the extraordinary work and dedication of 
educators across the country and the impor-
tance of quality education in the futures of our 
youth, island, and nation, this program has 
uniquely directed community accolades to out-
standing teachers in Guam since 1969. Fol-
lowing a rigorous nomination, evaluation, and 
observation process, Dr. Santiago was award-
ed the honor from among six finalists. 
Dr. Santiago first discovered his passion for 
teaching when he took on roles as an instruc-
tor at cultural dance academies and a local fit-
ness organization. Embracing his calling to 
help others on their personal paths of achieve-
ment, he navigated an extensive teaching ca-
reer that has resulted in what is now 25 years 
with GDOE: In 1993, Dr. Santiago earned his 
Bachelor of Arts in Secondary Education from 
the University of Guam. He then went on to 
earn his master’s and doctoral degrees in edu-
cation and educational leadership from the 
University of Portland and Argosy University 
respectively. Today, Dr. Santiago celebrates 
over 15 years of service to students and col-
leagues as a cultural dance and journalism 
teacher at Agueda I. Johnston Middle School. 
As demonstrated by his countless achieve-
ments, Dr. Santiago has consistently gone 
above and beyond his duties within the school 
system. In addition to collaborative curriculum 
and intervention development for holistic stu-
dent success, Dr. Santiago has served as an 
in-house mentor for new teachers, coordinated 
cultural events for his school community, and 
successfully trained a school choir to earn 3 
gold medals in a CHamoru language competi-
tion. Further, he is a trailblazing force that has 
created curricula for Cultural Arts and Dance 
for all secondary grade levels, introduced a 
new method to simultaneously teach cultural 
dance to both face-to-face and online learners 
amid the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic, and 
developed a new CHamoru language program 
with support from local government agencies. 
Most impressive, however, is his personal un-
dertaking to establish deeper understanding 
and awareness of cultural concepts as an in-
herent part of Guam’s public education. 
On behalf of the People of Guam, I would 
like to extend a sincere congratulations to Dr. 
Benjamin Santiago. His combined approach to 
advocate for both students and culture both 
challenges the traditional definitions of learn-
ing and success within the four walls of a 
classroom and better equips our youth to pur-
sue any endeavor they dare to dream. Dr. 
Santiago’s perseverance, ingenuity, and zeal 
to secure the best for our students encap-
sulates the limitless potential available to com-
munities that work together in service of each 
other, and I wish him the best on the rest of 
his professional journey.

Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor the service and accomplishments 
of Devin Wilcox, my outstanding legislative as-
sistant who’s transitioning from my office to 
pursue a new opportunity. Devin joined my 
staff in 2019, after working in the private sec-

blossomed into an extraordinary policy wonk 
and leader. 
Devin has been instrumental in my work to 
demonstrably change the lives of Black men 
and boys and improve our nation’s infrastruc-
ture. Devin’s legislative and political acumen 
were instrumental in building support for my 
recently enacted Commission on the Social 
Status of Black Men and Boys Act. Devin also 
worked closely with transportation stake-
holders on my priorities that were included in 
the Infrastructure Jobs and Investment Act. 
Additionally, Devin has created pipelines for 
diverse students to access coveted internship, 
fellowship, and employment opportunities on 
Capitol Hill. Understandably, he has earned 
the respect of his colleagues and stakeholders 
alike. 
Devin was born and raised in Florida City, 
Florida. He’s a product of the Miami-Dade 
County Public School system and earned his 
Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Flor-
ida International University in 2014. 
On behalf of Florida’s 24th Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in hon-
oring Devin Wilcox for his extraordinary ac-
complishments, commitment to public service, 
and for being a trailblazer.

HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor Chief Brad Keller, a dedicated public 
servant for the city of Montebello. Chief Keller 
is retiring after 31 years of service to his com-
munity and the Montebello Police Department. 
Chief Keller began his law enforcement ca-

lege Police Academy. 
Throughout his career, Chief Keller’s work in 
the community was recognized through mul-
tiple promotions, until eventually becoming 
Montebello’s 10th Police Chief in 2018. 
Through his advanced leadership and peace 
officer training, Chief Keller recognized that 
protecting a community also requires an in-
creased understanding of the diversity of the 
community. 
While Chief Keller always sought to protect 
and serve his community, he took care to do 
so while maintaining a relationship of trust and 
respect with the citizens of Montebello.

Chief Keller dedicated his life to serving 
Montebello, and he leaves behind a legacy

CELEBRATING THE IZAAK WALTON 
LEAGUE 
OF 
AMERICA’S 
100TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with im-
mense pleasure that I rise today to recognize 
the Izaak Walton League of America on the 
organization’s 100th Anniversary and to con-
gratulate its members on their many accom-
plishments. In honor of the League’s anniver-
sary, I would like to commemorate its legacy 
of environmental advocacy. 
The Izaak Walton League of America was 
formally incorporated on January 14, 1922, by 
fifty-four ambitious men with the goal of con-
serving our nation’s natural resources. At the 
time, after recognizing the deterioration of our 
wildlife habitats, they took immediate action to 
ensure their enjoyment, benefit, and use for 
generations to come. Today, the League con-
sists of 42,000 members and more than 200 
community-based chapters, each committed to 
continuing the legacy and furthering the ac-
complishments of their predecessors. The 
League’s members have worked hard to pro-
tect our nation’s soil, air, wood, waters, and 
wildlife, and not only have they met their goal, 
they have exceeded it. 
The League is responsible for the passage 
of the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act, 
commonly known as the Pittman-Robertson 
Act, which was signed into law in 1937. This 
has provided billions of dollars in funding to 
wildlife restoration, habitat conservation, and 
hunter education. The League’s proposal and 
advocacy for a federal agency to combat 
water pollution across the country led to the 
landmark Clean Water Act of 1972 which set 
federal standards for our nation’s waters. Fur-
thermore, the League’s advocacy on behalf of 
Indiana Dunes National Park has provided 
Hoosiers in Northwest Indiana continued en-
joyment and enrichment of our lakeshore. We 
must also commend the Izaak Walton League 
for its role in the creation of the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, the Upper Mis-
sissippi River National Wildlife and Fish Ref-
uge, Superior National Forest, Boundary 
Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, and the Ever-
glades and Isle Royale National Parks. 
Many positive changes involving policies, 
legislation, and efforts to protect the environ-
ment have resulted because of the League’s 
dedication to its communities. The League’s 
members, known as ‘‘Ikes,’’ give their time to 
help build nature trails, restore stream banks, 
plant trees and rain gardens, keep family 
farms in business, and prevent the spread of 
invasive species. Keeping in mind how impor-
tant it is to invest in the future, the League 
created a scholarship fund that awards 
$125,000 annually to students who are seek-
ing their degrees in fields related to conserva-
tion and natural resources. When it comes to 
protecting our water sources, defending public 
lands, establishing farm and energy policy, 
protecting fish and wildlife, and conservation, 
the Izaak Walton League’s members have 
proven that with diligence, teamwork, and an 
appreciation for nature, everyday citizens can 
have a major impact on the world. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my 
other distinguished colleagues join me in hon-
oring and congratulating the Izaak Walton 
League of America on its 100th Anniversary. 
Through the years, the League’s members 
have dedicated their time and efforts to ensure 
the conservation of our natural resources, and 
for this, they are to be recognized and com-
mended.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE CAREER 
AND SERVICE OF RETIRING UNI-
VERSITY OF WISCONSIN SYSTEM 
PRESIDENT TOMMY THOMPSON 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in honor of the career and service of retir-
ing University of Wisconsin System President, 
Tommy Thompson. 
Throughout Mr. Thompson’s long and es-
teemed career, he has been admired by his 
peers for his incredible dedication to public 
service. From being born and raised in Elroy, 
Wisconsin, to enlisting in the United States 
Army National Guard, to becoming the long-
est-serving governor in Wisconsin history, Mr. 
Thompson’s commitment to the State of Wis-
consin and our Nation never waivered. I com-
mend Mr. Thompson’s service and thank him 
for the enormous contributions that he has 
made to the State of Wisconsin and to the 
United States. 
Mr. Thompson’s successful tenure as gov-
ernor was spearheaded by major initiatives 
like the nation’s first school-choice program 
that Wisconsinites continue to benefit from 
today. His push for the parental school-choice 
program created unparalleled educational op-
portunities for students and witnessed record 
participation. Governor Thompson led the way 
on education, healthcare, and welfare reform 
setting the stage for decades of prosperity in 
Wisconsin. Given the success of his governor-
ship, Mr. Thompson was appointed by then 
President George W. Bush to serve as the 
Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary 
from 2001 to 2005. During his time as HHS 
Secretary, Mr. Thompson played a key role in 
projects and initiatives that resulted in greater 
transparency and efficiency throughout the 
agency. 
During his almost 60-year career, Mr. 
Thompson has proven himself to be one of 
the most successful public servants in Wis-
consin history. In 2019, Mr. Thompson yet 
again answered the call to service as he was 
named President of the University of Wis-
consin System. Under his leadership, the UW 
System prioritized developing, attracting, and 
retaining students and educators that will ben-
efit from the world-class education that the 
UW system has to offer. As President, Mr. 
Thompson also helped the UW System navi-
gate the incredible challenges of a once-in-a- 
lifetime pandemic. The State of Wisconsin is 
grateful for Mr. Thompson’s lifetime of service 
and dedication to our great state. 
As we look back on Mr. Thompson’s career, 
there is no doubt that he has dedicated his life 
to making the world around him a better place. 
Mr. Thompson’s continued service to both the 
State of Wisconsin and the United States is 
worthy of our highest degree of recognition. I 
urge all of my colleagues in this body to join 
me in congratulating Mr. Thompson on an-
other successful tenure in public service and 
on his retirement from the UW System. I wish 
him all the best in his future endeavors.

HONORING WALTER DELANEY, JR. 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Walter Delaney, Jr., who died on 
February 14, 2022, at the age of 81. Mr. 
Delaney dedicated his life to public service as 
a law enforcement officer who honorably ful-
filled his professional duties. 
Mr. Delaney was born on March 15, 1940, 
to the late Walter L. Delaney, Sr., and Re-
becca Minor Delaney. Mr. Delaney attended 
Roanoke City Public Schools. From a young 
age, he always led with a heart of service. He 
volunteered with the Huntington Life Saving 
Crew, and this inspired him to become a Roa-
noke County Deputy Sheriff. So, he left his job 
at the Eaton Corp. in Salem to serve his com-
munity. 
He worked as a patrolman, an investigator, 
and in the courts. Mr. Delaney became the 
first Black deputy for the Roanoke County 
Sheriff’s Office. As a practicing attorney in the 
Roanoke Valley, I worked with Mr. Delaney for 
many years. He was always professional and 
courteous. He never drew attention to the fact 
that he was the first black deputy. In a time 
when the country was going through desegre-
gation, Mr. Delaney was a trailblazer in his 
community. In every role he held, he con-
stantly worked hard and selflessly served 
those around him. 
In addition to serving in law enforcement, 
Mr. Delaney was also an active member of the 
Sweet Union Baptist Church and deeply val-
ued his faith. 
Mr. Delaney was preceded in death by his 
parents; his wife, Susie M. Larry Delaney; his 
son, Ricky H. Delaney, his sister, Loreli 
Cherrylene 
Delaney; 
his 
brother 
Xavier 
Jacques Delaney; and his brothers-in-law: 
Rodney Buford Larry and Phillip Larry. 
He is survived by his children Gary Han-
cock, Robbie Delaney Majors and Anthony 
Delaney, Sr.; siblings, Yvonne Delaney Oliver, 
William Delaney, Essie J. Manns, Johnny 
Delaney; grandchildren, Gary Kasey, Antonio 
Taylor, 
William 
‘‘Tre’’’ 
Majors, 
Anthony 
Delaney, Jr., Jarek Hancock, Naya Delaney, 
and Dallas Delaney; great grandchildren, 
Jamauri Majors, Jaylen Majors, TreMaine 
Bond, Jin Lee Taylor; and many other beloved 
family and friends. I offer them my condo-
lences on the loss of this good man.

HONORING CARMEL ANGELO 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the significant career and 
accomplishments of Ms. Carmel Angelo on the 
occasion of her retirement from the County of 
Mendocino as Chief Executive Officer (CEO). 
Ms. Angelo was hired to be the director of 
Health and Human Services and Assistant 
CEO for Mendocino County in 2007. Just 
three years later, she was appointed to serve 
as County CEO by the Mendocino County 
Board of Supervisors in 2010, becoming the 
first woman to hold the County’s top executive 
position. 
Throughout her 15-year tenure, Ms. Angelo 
was a strong advocate for Mendocino County, 
and she was well-respected for her ability to 
address the unique challenges facing rural 
counties. As CEO, she led the County through 
a fiscal crisis and provided effective leadership 
during multiple fire and flood disasters. Draw-
ing on her experience in health and human 
services, she navigated the public health re-
sponse to the global pandemic of COVID–19 
with skill. 
Ms. Angelo’s advocacy for rural counties ex-
tended beyond Mendocino County through her 
leadership work with multiple statewide asso-
ciations. She served on the California Associa-
tion of County Executives (CACE) as a mem-
ber and president, earning the 2021 Presi-
dent’s CACE Award. In addition, her efforts 
with the Rural County Representatives of Cali-
fornia (RCRC) resulted in the 2018 RCRC 
President’s Award, and her work with Cali-
fornia State Association of Counties (CSAC) 
was honored with its 2019 CSAC Circle of 
Service Award. 
Madam Speaker, Carmel Angelo’s career is 
a sterling example of service and dedication to 
improving the effectiveness of local govern-
ment and meeting the needs of rural commu-
nities. Please join me in honoring Carmel An-
gelo on the occasion of her retirement, and in 
wishing her the best of luck in her future en-
deavors.

IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF 
JOHN CHENEY’S 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Mr. John Cheney, an outstanding 
citizen from North Baltimore, Ohio, who will 
celebrate his 90th birthday on March 20, 2022. 
John has been a leader in the community 
through a lifetime of service, and his family 
and friends are very grateful to have the op-
portunity to celebrate this significant birthday 
with him: Reaching this momentous milestone 
provides the opportunity to recognize John’s 
many accomplishments in life, but especially 
his service to our country and community. 
John served on active duty as a field artil-
lery officer in the U.S. Army after graduation 
from Bowling Green State University in 1954. 
He served on active duty until 1957 and con-
tinued in the U.S. Army Reserves, completing 
twenty-eight years of military service as a 
Lieutenant Colonel. He has remained active in 
a number of military organizations and is well 
known for his large collection of military vehi-
cles, which he takes to events throughout 
Northwest Ohio and the rest of the country. 
He 
chaired 
the 
Findlay-Hancock 
County 
Chamber of Commerce Military Affairs Com-
mittee when it established the county’s Armed 
Forces Day Celebration. Today, Armed Forces 
Day in Findlay is one of the largest annual 
military events in Ohio. He is a member of the 
Military Vehicle Preservation Association, and 
his vehicle collection has helped to preserve 
and promote our military heritage. John is a 
charter member of the Ohio Motor Pool and 
participated in the 2009 Transcontinental Mili-
tary Convoy. He is also a pilot and a member 
of the Experimental Aircraft Association. Nota-
bly, he built a trophy-winning open cockpit bi-
plane, which he flew for many years. 
John married his wife, Elaine, on July 19, 
1952, and they had three children: Caprice, 
Mark, and John. After completing his active- 
duty military service, John worked at Hancock- 
Wood Electric Cooperative for 41 years while 
raising his family, retiring as president and 
CEO in 1996. He is known throughout the 
area for his public service and has continued 
to be active in many organizations in his com-
munity and Northwest Ohio. Most notably, he 
is a founding trustee and served as chairman 
of Northwestern Water and Sewer District 
Board of Trustees. He continues to serve on 
that board. He also served for 13 years as a 
board member of Buckeye Power, which pro-
vides electric energy to 25 member coopera-
tives in Ohio. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating John Cheney’s 90th birth-
day. John is most worthy of this recognition, 
and I thank him for a distinguished career 
serving our country and community. On behalf 
of the people of the Fifth Congressional Dis-
trict of Ohio, I wish John a very happy birthday 
and his family all the best.

HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI

Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, it is my privi-
lege to congratulate Chief M.E. ‘‘Gene’’ 
Waldrop on 50 years of service in law enforce-
ment. He has enjoyed a distinguished career, 
and we are grateful for his dedicated service 
to defend the safety of our great state for 
more than half a century. 
As a native of Greenville, Mississippi, Chief 
Waldrop graduated from Greenville High 
School and later served as Staff Sergeant in 
the Mississippi National Guard. After being 
honorably discharged, Waldrop began his law 
enforcement career as a patrol officer. Chief 
Waldrop served 20 years for the Greenville 
Mississippi Police Department and retired in 
1991 as Chief of Police. With Chief Waldrop’s 
oversight and encouragement, the City of 
Greenville coordinated with local agencies to 
develop efficient disaster response plans that 
heightened the region’s security. 
After retiring, Chief Waldrop was appointed 
as Chief of Police in the City of Madison, Mis-
sissippi, holding to his commitment to public 
service. In this role, he continued his steadfast 
dedication to keeping the great state of Mis-
sissippi safe by establishing advanced emer-
gency response plans. Under his courageous 
leadership, the City of Madison has been 
rated the Safest City in Mississippi by several 
crime prevention organizations. 
Chief Waldrop is also a dedicated commu-
nity servant. He helped to establish the Board 
of Directors for the Mississippi Firefighters’ 
Memorial Burn Center Association. There, he 
served as the Vice-President of the Board of 
Directors, one of his many achievements that 
earned Chief Waldrop the Jim Ingram Lifetime 
Achievement Award in 2012. 
I commend all that Chief Waldrop has done 
to valiantly protect the lives of Mississippians, 
and I thank him for his contributions towards 
bettering our state’s law enforcement. I extend 
my very best wishes to him and look forward 
to working with him in the future to make our 
state an even better place to live, worship, 
and raise a family.

HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a true public servant, Brigadier 
General Roderick R. Leon Guerrero and con-
gratulate him on his retirement from the Guam 
Army National Guard (GUARNG) after 34 
years of service to our island and nation. 
Launching his military career in 1985, Briga-
dier General Leon Guerrero enlisted as a Pri-
vate First Class. Determined to advance both 
his education and position in the ranks, he 
then entered the Army ROTC program at the 
University of Guam and was commissioned as 
a second lieutenant three years later. After 
earning his bachelor’s degree in Political 
Science, he sought continued growth in knowl-
edge and experience—paving a path from 
Combat Medic to Specialist, Cadet, and onto 
numerous assignments as a commissioned of-
ficer. His lasting contributions were catalyzed 
through his roles as an Intelligence Officer, 
Executive Officer for a Headquarters Com-
pany, Military Police Company Commander, 
Personnel Officer, Assistant Professor of Mili-
tary Science, Recruiting and Retention Man-
ager, Deputy G3 Officer, Plans, Operations, 
and Military Support Officer, Civil Support 
Team Commander, J3 Officer, and J1 Officer. 
Moreover, he maintains an impressive military 
education bolstered by a Security Managers 
Course at the National Defense Institution, 
Military Police Officer Basic Course, Adjutant 
General Officers Advanced Course, Combined 
Arms Staff Service Course, Command and 
General Staff Course, and Embedded Military 
Transition Training Course in addition to nu-
merous other trainings and the completion of 
programs hosted by Harvard University and 
the Army Strategic Education. 
After earning his master’s in Strategic Stud-
ies from the U.S. Army War College, Brigadier 
General Leon Guerrero emerged as a pillar of 
leadership for our community with unwavering 
resolution. In addition to supporting Operation 
Enduring Freedom as part of the first Embed-
ded Training Team from the GUARNG to Af-
ghanistan, he embodied excellence in service 
as Chief of Joint Staff for the Guam National 
Guard (GUNG). As a Director of Military Af-
fairs and Personnel, he further utilized his ex-
tensive experience, valuable specialties, and- 
incomparable integrity to develop our National 
Guard into a world-class organization. By 
2015, he was selected to serve as the Adju-
tant General of the GUNG, where he advised 
the Governor of Guam on military affairs. In 
this capacity, he was also responsible for en-
suring more than 1,500 Guardsmen were ac-
cessible, capable, and ready to deploy on is-
land in response to emergencies and provide 
combat ready servicemembers to the U.S. 
Army and Air Force. 
With a long list of recognitions that include 
a Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, Meritorious 
Service, Army Commendation, Army, Airforce, 
and Army Reserve Components Achievement, 
and Afghanistan Campaign Medals, National 
Defense, Global War on Terrorism, and Hu-
manitarian Service Medals, Army Service, 
Overseas Service, and NATO Ribbons, and 
Combat Action and Parachutist Badges, Briga-
dier General Leon Guerrero’s countless deco-
rations only illustrate a glimpse of his out-
standing character and selflessness. His in-
duction into the prestigious Cadet Command 
Hall of Fame in Fort Knox, Kentucky further 
demonstrates his distinguished background in 
both military and civilian pursuits and manifold 
contributions to the nation, the Army, and the 
history and traditions of the Army ROTC pro-
gram. 
Throughout his career, Brigadier General 
Roderick R. Leon Guerrero has never failed to 
lead by example. Strengthened by his wife, 
Mary, his sons Jared and Broderick, and his 
daughter Crystal, he cultivated a fine career 
rooted in collaboration, problem solving, and 
results. He served with an astounding commit-
ment to self, others, nation, and the American 
Dream, and continues to inspire many mem-
bers of our community with his legacy of integ-
rity and respect for others in all endeavors. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the Peo-
ple of Guam, offering my greatest appreciation 
for Brigadier General Leon Guerrero’s commit-
ment to our country. I sincerely thank him for 
his many years of service and sacrifice, con-
gratulate him on his well-earned retirement, 
and wish him the best during the next chapter 
of his life.

IN HONOR OF PETE J. 
STILIANESSIS 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Pete J. Stilianessis in cele-
bration of his decades of work as a father, po-
lice officer and leader in the law enforcement 
community. I am proud to have such a com-
mitted and hardworking individual here in the 
great State of New Jersey. A native son of 
Passaic County, Pete Stilianessis dedicated 
his life to the safety and security of our neigh-
borhood. I wish him well as he retires from the 
New Jersey State Troopers Non-Commis-
sioned Officers Association. 
Born in Paterson, New Jersey to Jerry and 
Maryellen Stilianessis, Pete’s story is one that 
begins with a love for public service. The son 
of a former marine, his mother’s active duty in 
the United States Marine Corps would moti-
vate Pete to do the same. Traveling the world 
as a machine gunner, Pete displayed his ac-
tion-oriented personality. Most notably, he 
would answer the call to serve in the Gulf War 
and contribute his efforts in Iraq. A ‘‘Task 
Force Ripper’’ during Operation Desert Storm, 
Pete served as squad leader during ground 
combat operations liberating Kuwait City on 
February 27, 1991. Awarded the Combat Ac-
tion Ribbon, Navy Meritorious Unit Com-
mendation, Kuwait Liberation Medal and two

Bronze Stars, Pete is a decorated veteran and 
a man worth our respect and admiration. 
Following his career in the military, Pete 
would enter law enforcement. First a Correc-
tions Officer with the Passaic County Sherriff’s 
Department, then a police officer with several 
municipalities, Pete would eventually decide 
that his greatest aspiration was to serve as a 
New Jersey State Trooper. Graduating from 
the New Jersey State Police Academy in 
1993, Pete would formally begin his storied 
career as a State Trooper. 
Starting as a ‘‘Road Trooper’’, Pete would 
quickly ascend the ranks to reach Detective. 
Assigned to work on the Counter Terrorism 
Unit, FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force and Drug 
Enforcement Administration, Pete carried out 
intricate and high level international and do-
mestic investigations. Working both as an un-
dercover agent and lead investigator, Pete 
worked in Central and South America in addi-
tion to operations here in the United States. 
As the President of the New Jersey State 
Troopers Non-Commissioned Officers Asso-
ciation, Pete advocated for his brothers and 
sisters in uniform. Embodying the principal of 
service over self, Pete traveled both to our 
State Capital of Trenton and Washington, D.C. 
to fight for improved benefits and funding. I 
know, he will be missed by so many as he re-
tires from law enforcement. As he transitions 
into this new phase of life, I thank him for all 
his hard work. 
The job of a United States Congressman in-
volves much that is rewarding, yet nothing 
compares to working with and recognizing the 
efforts 
of 
individuals 
like 
Mr. 
Pete 
J. 
Stilianessis. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join our col-
leagues, friends, family, and the residents of 
New Jersey in recognizing Pete J. Stilianessis, 
as we celebrate his years of distinguished 
service to the people of the Ninth Congres-
sional District.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND 
LEGACY OF DR. FATIMA ZAFAR 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the life and legacy of 
Dr. Fatima Zafar, a beloved, wife, mother, 
physician, and medical leader in Miami-Dade 
County. 
Whereas, Fatima Zafar, MD was born on 
October 20, 1941, in Hyderabad, India, the 
first of six children. She was inspired by her 
father as she watched him, a middle-class 
contractor working for the government, tire-
lessly helping those in need, including buying 
food with his own money to feed the poor, and 
always encouraging his children to help oth-
ers. Fatima’s upbringing also included accom-
panying missionaries to the countryside to ad-
minister smallpox vaccines. She witnessed 
women seeking medical help from nuns at a 
time when they were prohibited from seeing 
male doctors. These experiences intrigued 
Fatima. Her fascination with the process of 
healing contributed to the seeds of compas-
sion and doing for others sown into her life; 
and 
Whereas, Fatima was very athletic and very 
active in high school sports. With her father’s 
encouragement, she turned that focus to 
science and medical classes, and was subse-
quently accepted at the Osmania University 
Medical School. Upon graduation she com-
pleted her residency in Obstetrics/Gynecology, 
at the Muslim Maternity and General Hospital 
where she was in charge for three years; and 
Whereas, Fatima and Ferrukh met and were 
later married, had two daughters, and jour-
neyed to Miami, Florida where Fatima com-
pleted a residency in Psychiatry at Jackson 
Memorial Hospital and became a Diplomat of 
the American Board of Family Practice; and 
Whereas, in 1980 Fatima was hired as 
Chief Medical Officer for the Economic Oppor-
tunity Family Health Center, Inc. (EOFHC), at 
a time when EOFHC was located in one of the 
poorest neighborhoods in Miami-Dade County 
and was just a collection of trailers. The med-
ical leadership which she provided over 28 
years has been unparalleled including distinc-
tions such as, but not limited to, leading her 
medical team in providing care for one of the 
first HIV/AIDS cases in Miami-Dade; building 
the first brick and mortar site for the Center; 
expanding the accessibility and convenience 
of high quality care provided by EOFHC by 
opening six primary care sites; establishing 
the Jefferson Reaves House as one of the first 
substance abuse treatment programs for 
women and their children; establishing pro-
grams for effective management of chronic ill-
nesses; establishing a fund through the Jessie 
Trice Community Health Foundation to supple-
ment the costs of pharmaceuticals for patients 
unable to pay. For the following twelve years 
she focused on family medical services and 
specialty services in the health system; and 
Whereas, Fatima relocated in 2020 to New 
Jersey to be near family after the passing of 
her husband. Even after relocating to New 
Jersey, up until one week before her own 
passing on July 4, 2021, she continued her 
commitment to touch and to heal, and to pro-
vide the highest quality of care to the most 
vulnerable patients served by EOFHC, by pro-
viding telehealth services for ongoing manage-
ment of chronic illnesses and also providing 
psychiatric consultation; and 
Whereas, Fatima leaves behind her two 
daughters, peers, mentors, staff and thou-
sands of patients who were all inspired by her 
life and legacy of healing, giving, and love for 
all mankind, including the least of these; and 
Now, therefore, be it resolved that I, FRED-
ERICA S. WILSON, a member of the United 
States House of Representatives representing 
the 24th Congressional District of Florida, am 
honored to recognize the naming of the main 
site of the Jessie Trice Community Health 
System, Inc. for the late Dr. Fatima Zafar, and 
to recognize her for her commitment, dedica-
tion, and the outstanding medical leadership 
that she has provided to our community.

HONORING I. RAY BYRD 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of I. Ray Byrd, who passed away on 
January 30, 2022. Mr. Byrd was a business-
man and community leader in Salem, Virginia. 
Mr. Byrd was born on September 1, 1928, 
in Martinsville, Virginia to Daniel Edward and 
Virgie Holt Byrd. He attended Randolph 
Macon College and finished his education at 
the Medical College of Virginia with a Bachelor 
of Science in Pharmacy. He later went on to 
spend two years as a United States Marine 
and attained the rank of Captain. 
He and his wife, Nina, moved to Salem, Vir-
ginia in 1954. This is where he and his dear 
friend, Ervin Pollard Brooks, founded Brooks- 
Byrd Pharmacy. Brooks-Byrd Pharmacy be-
came an iconic Salem location and is still 
open today. Further, the pharmacy’s patrons 
benefited from the kindness of Mr. Byrd. In a 
throwback to an earlier age, it allowed their 
regular customers to carry accounts forward. 
This was very helpful to many struggling fami-
lies throughout the years—including single- 
parent households such as mine when I was 
a kid. The community will be forever indebted 
to Mr. Byrd and Mr. Brooks for their dedicated, 
selfless service. 
Throughout his pharmaceutical career, Mr. 
Byrd also served as a pharmacist at the Brad-
ley Free Clinic, Richfield Pharmacy, and the 
VA Hospital. He was also a member of the 
Roanoke Valley Pharmaceutical and the Vir-
ginia Pharmaceutical Associations. 
Beyond his professional endeavors, Mr. 
Byrd devotedly volunteered and worked to im-
prove his community. He served in the Salem 
Kiwanis Club, Salem Chamber of Commerce, 
Salem Museum, Salem Sports Foundation, 
and the Salem Industrial Authority. For five 
years he served as the chairman of the City 
of Salem School Board. Mr. Byrd especially 
valued faith and family. He was an active 
member and trustee of the Salem Baptist 
Church. 
Mr. Byrd’s survivors include his wife, Nina 
Byrd; his children, Dr. Carol Byrd and her hus-
band, I. Ray Byrd, Jr. and his wife, Mary Cath-
erine Ruskan, and Laura Byrd Earle and her 
husband; his grandchildren, Bradley Barr, Dr. 
Ann Cameron Barr and her husband, Dr. An-
drew Barr and his wife, Nicholas Byrd and his

HONORING MAJOR GENERAL WIL-
LIAM J. WALKER SERGEANT AT 
ARMS OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF 
REPRESENTATIVES 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Major General William J. 
Walker, the 38th House Sergeant at Arms and 
the first Black person to serve as the cham-
ber’s top security official. 
A native of Chicago, Illinois, Walker holds 
degrees from the University of Illinois at Chi-
cago (BA), Chicago State University (MS), Na-
tional Intelligence University (MS), and Amer-
ican University (MA). He completed the Na-
tional and International Security Program at 
Harvard University, the National Security Stud-
ies Program at George Washington University, 
the Seminar XXI Foreign Politics, International 
Relations, and the National Interest Fellowship 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
He has been awarded nearly two dozen 
medals and badges for his 39 years of military 
service. He was appointed as a senior intel-
ligence officer in 2009, holding final post as 
deputy assistant administrator for Strategic 
Warning at DEA headquarters. 
Walker served as vice chair on the board of 
directors of the Young Marines, a military affili-
ated non-profit organization that serves more 
than 10,000 boys and girls. He also is a mem-
ber of several community organizations includ-
ing Alpha Phi Alpha and Sigma Pi Phi frater-
nities. 
As the 23rd commanding general of the Dis-
trict of Columbia National Guard, Walker led 
deployments 
to 
Iraq, 
Afghanistan, 
Guanta´namo Bay, Poland and Saudi Arabia. 
He has overseen the 113th Wing, served at 
the Pentagon, and as chair of the National 
Guard Bureau’s Joint Diversity Executive 
Council. 
Walker played a central role in restoring 
control following the Capitol siege on January 
6. His expertise will go a long way toward re-
storing our faith in safety we once took for 
granted. Further, he is committed to empow-
ering males of color to achieve their dreams. 
He is newly inducted into the 5000 Role Mod-
els of Excellence Project and was bestowed 
the Breaking the Glass Ceiling Award. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
Major General William J. Walker for his dec-
ades of public service and for answering your 
call to ‘‘bring his steady and patriotic leader-
ship’’ to this critical new role.

HONORING JORGE DAVID 
ALVARADO, JR. 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 15, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the loss and the service of Sali-
nas Police Officer Jorge David Alvarado, Jr. 
Officer Alvarado was fatally shot in the line of 
duty while conducting a traffic stop on Friday, 
February 25, 2022. 
Born in in the City and County of San Fran-
cisco, Jorge Davis Alvarado, Jr. understood 
what it meant to give back to his community 
and to his country. After graduating from the 
Voice of the Pentecost Academy High School, 
he enlisted in the United States Army as an 
Infantryman. He earned the prestigious Com-
bat Infantry Badge for his gallantry during 
combat operations in Afghanistan and was 
promoted to the rank of Sergeant and as-
signed as a Team Leader. 
After completing his tour of duty, Officer Al-
varado served the community of Colma on the 
San Francisco Peninsula for four and half 
years. He then joined the Salinas Police De-
partment, and aftercompleting his required 
training, was assigned as a patrol officer. 
Officer Alvarado displayed true bravery and 
duty to his community, staying in the fight to 
the end and paying the ultimate price. Officer 
Alvarado’s passing marks the first city police 
officer lost in the line of duty in Salinas in 
nearly 80 years. Officer Alvarado is survived 
by his high school sweetheart and fiance´e, 
Veronica, his mother and father, his three 
brothers, and his nieces and nephews. 
As we look back upon his commitment and 
actions as we mourn his loss, let us also look 
to Officer Alvarado’s legacy of service as a 
way forward. We must realize that our com-
munities rely on the men and women in uni-
form for order, for safety, and for our upward 
mobility. Officer Alvarado did that by not only 
protecting and serving Salinas, but he got up 
every day and left his home knowing that his 
job was to run to the danger and not away 
from it. 
Madam Speaker, Officer Jorge Alvarado ran 
to the danger on February 25th. Let us make 
sure that his service and his sacrifice are not 
in vain. Together, we must support his family 
and support the men and women in uniform 
who serve and protect. It is because of their 
service that we make it home to our families 
every night and thrive in safe communities.
