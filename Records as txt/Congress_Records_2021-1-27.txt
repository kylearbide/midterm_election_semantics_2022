PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, our Father, thank You for the 
gift of this day. Lord, we are grateful 
for the blessing of Your unfailing love, 
for Your mercies endure forever. 
Keep our lawmakers on the proper 
path. Lead them to strive for right-
eousness and humility. As You show 
them the path to choose, give them the 
wisdom to live for Your honor. Remind 
them that You are a friend to those 
who possess referential awe. Rescue 
them from the traps of their enemies. 
Lord, You are our hope for the years 
to come. 
We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.

Mr. LUJA´ N. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
NOMINATION OF ALEJANDRO 
NICHOLAS MAYORKAS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it has 
been 3 weeks since a mob of domestic 
terrorists stormed the U.S. Capitol in 
an effort to thwart our democratic sys-
tem of government. In the weeks since, 
the underlying threat of violence to 
our government remains of great con-
cern. 
One of the most important respon-
sibilities of the new administration—of 
any administration—is to protect our 
country and its citizens. The Senate 
must continue the process of con-
firming President Biden’s Cabinet by 
installing Alejandro Mayorkas to serve 
as Secretary of Homeland Security. In 
truth, we should have been able to con-
firm Mr. Mayorkas days ago. He is su-
premely well qualified for the job. He is 
the son of immigrants whose family es-
caped from the Holocaust, a pros-
ecutor, a veteran of 7 years who led the 
Agency’s response on Ebola, cyber se-
curity, border security, counterterror-
ism, and domestic terrorism. 
Just 4 years ago, President Trump 
had his Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity installed on Inauguration Day. As 
four previous Secretaries of Homeland 
Security under Presidents of both par-
ties wrote recently: After the attacks 
on the Capitol on January 6, it is more 
urgent than ever to have in place an 
experienced, capable, and Senate-con-
firmed 
leader. 
That 
person 
is 
Mayorkas. 
That was four previous Homeland 
Secretaries from both parties. 
Unfortunately, because of the objec-
tions of one Member, the Senate has 
not been allowed to vote on this nomi-
nation yet. It is the Senate’s responsi-
bility to make sure national security 
officials are on the job and keeping our 
country safe. 
My friends on the other side don’t 
have to agree with Mr. Mayorkas on 
the finer points of every policy, but 
surely we can all agree that he knows 
the Department, he understands the 
threats to our Nation’s security, and he 
has what it takes to lead DHS. The 
Senate must confirm his nomination in 
very short order, and we will make 
sure that happens. 
We must continue on to the rest of 
the President’s Cabinet as well. The 
President’s nominee for Secretary of 
Transportation was voted out of com-
mittee this morning on an overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan vote, 21 to 3. With co-
operation, the Senate can and should 
confirm Mr. Buttigieg soon, as well. 
f 
CLIMATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. On climate, today 
President Biden is set to announce a 
slew of Executive actions on climate, 
including critical measures to increase 
the conservation of Federal lands, re-
duce oil and gas development, and

S158 
January 27, 2021 
place 
environmental 
justice, 
green 
jobs, and, yes, science at the heart of 
our Nation’s climate policy. 
I think Americans are saying: Wel-
come back, science. We are glad you 
are playing a role in the decisions we 
make and not being ignored and tram-
pled on like the previous administra-
tion 
did. 
Understanding 
that 
the 
United States cannot defeat a global 
threat on its own, the Biden adminis-
tration has already wisely joined the 
Paris accords and will also propose 
convening an international climate 
summit this year, on Earth Day. 
These Executive actions are a very 
strong opening push by the Biden ad-
ministration to refocus our Nation’s 
energy toward the threat of climate 
change. President Biden’s commitment 
to deal with climate change is unques-
tioned. He is off to a fast start, and it 
couldn’t come soon enough. 
The Federal Government has a great 
deal of power to set the direction for 
our Nation’s energy and environmental 
policy, but climate change represents 
an existential threat to our country 
and our planet. Every tool in the tool-
box should be brought to bear. In my 
view, President Biden should consider 
the declaration of a national emer-
gency on climate change. 
Former President Trump, of course, 
issued an emergency declaration to di-
vert funds toward an expensive and in-
effective border wall when there was no 
emergency at all. Declaring one for cli-
mate change—an actual emergency— 
would be a giant step in the right di-
rection, and it would allow President 
Biden to tap additional resources and 
pursue additional policies in the fight 
against climate change, even if Repub-
licans in Congress remain intransigent 
and unable to recognize the severity of 
this crisis. 
Japan, the United Kingdom, New 
Zealand, and scores of regional and 
local governments have declared states 
of emergency on climate change. The 
United States would send a powerful 
signal to the world about our commit-
ment to defeating climate change if we 
did so as well. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on COVID, as I mentioned yesterday, 
the Senate will soon begin the process 
of considering legislation to help the 
country defeat COVID–19 and provide 
relief to those Americans who are still 
suffering great economic hardship. 
There has been a lot of action in 
Washington recently. We inaugurated a 
new President, a new administration is 
getting off the ground, and an impeach-
ment trial of the former President will 
commence in a few weeks. But COVID– 
19 hasn’t gone anywhere, unfortu-
nately. Americans are still losing their 
jobs. American businesses are still 
closing. Americans are still getting 
sick. Americans are still dying. 
The needs in our country are still 
great, and the Congress must pursue a 
bold and robust course of action to de-
feat the disease and get our country 
back to normal. We must not—we must 
not—repeat the mistakes of 2008 and 
2009, when Congress was too timid and 
constrained in its response to the glob-
al financial crisis. 
The Congressional Budget Office has 
told us last fall that COVID–19, the 
pandemic, has taken more than $17 
trillion out of our economy—$17 tril-
lion out of the economy. The danger of 
undershooting our response to COVID– 
19 is far greater than overshooting it. 
So Congress must pursue a bold re-
sponse to the prevailing crisis of our 
time. 
Here in the Senate, we want that 
work to be bipartisan. Let me say that 
again. We want the next legislative re-
sponse to COVID–19 to be bipartisan. 
We want to work with our Republican 
colleagues, if we can, to include their 
ideas and input if they will offer them. 
That is our preference. But if our Re-
publican colleagues decide to oppose 
the necessary, robust COVID relief that 
is needed, we will have to move forward 
without them. It is not our preference, 
but dealing with this crisis in a bold 
and sufficient way is a necessity. The 
Senate is going to respond to the coun-
try’s needs and deliver help to the 
American people fast. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on impeachment, finally, I want to ad-
dress the vote the Senate took yester-
day on the point of order raised by the 
junior Senator from Kentucky. I regret 
to say, for 45 Republican Senators to 
vote for a spurious constitutional ob-
jection to the coming impeachment 
trial was deeply, deeply irresponsible. 
The trial is still 2 weeks away. The 
constitutional objection has been com-
pletely debunked by more than 150 con-
stitutional scholars representing the 
entire breadth of the political spec-
trum, including very prominent con-
servatives. But only five Republican 
Senators were willing to take a prin-
cipled stand against this reckless and 
ill-advised effort by Members of this 
body who are eager to excuse President 
Trump’s campaign to overturn the 
election and, apparently, to excuse his 
incitement of the mob that every one 
of us experienced in this Capitol. 
I would simply say to all of my col-
leagues: Make no mistake. There will 
be a trial, and the evidence against the 
former President will be presented in 
living color for the Nation and every 
one of us to see once again. No one will 
be able to avert their gaze from what 
Mr. Trump said and did and the con-
sequences of his actions. We will all 
watch what happened. We will listen to 
what happened, and then we will vote. 
We will pass judgment, as our solemn 
duty under the Constitution demands, 
and, in turn, we will all be judged on 
how we respond. 
I am glad to see my colleague from 
Vermont here, as well as my colleague 
from Illinois. 
Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distin-
guished leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, we confirmed Antony Blinken, 
our new Secretary of State. Like the 
Director of National Intelligence, the 
Secretary of Defense, and the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, it was another 
big, bipartisan vote here in the Senate. 
Four years ago, Senate Democrats 
subjected mainstream nominees to lead 
State and Treasury to a full gauntlet 
of partisan delay tactics. They forced 
cloture votes. Those were nearly party- 
line. So were the final votes. Neither 
got on the job until February. But this 
President’s mainstream nominees to 
key posts are receiving fair consider-
ation and a timely process. 
Republicans have no shortage of sub-
stantive policy differences with the 
new administration. We will be dis-
cussing them with Secretaries Austin, 
Yellen, and Blinken in the course of 
normal committee oversight. 
But unlike what took place 4 years 
ago, Republicans are not gratuitously 
delaying people who are mainstream 
and qualified whom the new President 
has asked to serve in key posts. If we 
find somebody unfit, unqualified, or 
outside the mainstream, you bet we 
will oppose them. 
But I have just spent 4 years arguing 
that Presidents deserve some latitude 
to assemble their team. I meant it, and 
I mean it now. 
With 
my 
vote 
to 
confirm 
Mr. 
Blinken, I wanted to reinforce the need 
for a true bipartisan consensus on the 
core objectives of our foreign policy. 
Yesterday, while discussing the legis-
lative filibuster, I talked about the 
chaos that would ensue if every domes-
tic policy swung wildly back and forth 
with every election. The same goes for 
our foreign affairs. American states-
men should make commitments and 
issue threats that can endure beyond 
their terms in office. 
To be clear, Presidents bear the pri-
mary responsibility for foreign policy, 
and I am not suggesting different lead-
ers should not have different ideas. But 
they will be more successful and their 
legacies more enduring if they make 
the effort to build bipartisan support 
among Congress and the American peo-
ple. 
Neither America nor our allies will 
like the world that results if the 
world’s leading Nation starts over like 
an Etch A Sketch every 4 years. 
For starters, in several important 
areas, the new administration should 
build on bipartisan consensus that ac-
tually already exists. 
Let’s start with China. The Trump 
administration helped build a long

January 27, 2021 
overdue awakening to the reality that 
we are in strategic competition with 
the PRC, that Beijing will not magi-
cally conform itself to the so-called 
international community, and that 
these challenges demand fast and seri-
ous action from the United States and 
from our friends. President Biden and 
his new Cabinet must keep working 
with Congress to continue building a 
whole-of-government, 
whole-of-econ-
omy approach to checking China. 
We need Secretary Austin to keep 
focus on modernizing our forces, deter-
ring Chinese threats from the Indo-Pa-
cific to space and cyber space, sus-
taining robust defense spending, and 
investing 
in 
defense 
partnerships 
across the world. 
We need Secretary Yellen to keep fo-
cused on the coercive manipulation the 
PRC uses to ensnare the developing 
world in its orbit. 
We need Secretary Blinken to keep 
clarifying the China threat to our al-
lies and European partners, to focus on 
contesting their growing influence in 
Africa and the Middle East, and to hold 
Beijing accountable for its unaccept-
able repression in places like Tibet and 
Hong Kong and its hostility toward 
Taiwan. 
Now, we know China is not the only 
great power with whom we need to 
hang tough. In concrete policy terms, 
the United States just spent 4 years de-
veloping a more clear-eyed approach to 
Russia. Rather than chasing naive 
‘‘resets’’ with the Kremlin or worship-
ping arms control like a religion, we 
leaned into military assistance to 
Ukraine, serious sanctions, cyber coun-
termeasures 
against 
meddling, 
and 
other strong steps. 
The Biden administration will find 
willing partners on Capitol Hill if it 
builds on this process, keeps imposing 
real costs on Moscow, pushes back on 
expansionism in the eastern Mediterra-
nean, and, importantly, encourages our 
allies to join in this effort. 
Great power competition is key, but, 
of course, it does not exhaust the 
threats that we face. In the Middle 
East, I know President Biden will face 
political pressure from the left to re-
join Obama’s Iran deal, just as Presi-
dent Trump faced pressure from the 
right to abandon it. 
Had President Obama not tried to 
circumvent Congress and pursue a par-
tisan policy, this critical national se-
curity challenge might not have be-
come so polarizing, but that is where 
we are. 
There is no question that Iran is the 
biggest threat the United States and 
our partners face in the region. It poses 
threats beyond just its pursuit of nu-
clear weapons: sponsoring terrorism, 
its sectarian agenda, its work to under-
mine its neighbors’ sovereignty, its de-
velopment of ballistic missiles and le-
thal drones, and its appalling—appall-
ing—record on human rights. 
Confronting this multifaceted chal-
lenge will take bipartisanship at home 
and solidarity with Israel and our Arab 
partners abroad. Those things need to 
exist before making major changes or 
racing to rejoin a deal. 
And our new President must be ready 
to respond to violence with force, as 
the Trump administration did when 
they removed Soleimani from the bat-
tlefield. 
Speaking of the Middle East, I have 
consistently and vocally stood up dur-
ing administrations of both parties 
against withdrawing our limited forces 
in Afghanistan, Iraq, or Syria too rap-
idly or without a smart plan. A super-
majority of the Senate joined me last 
Congress in warning against abruptly 
abandoning battlefields recklessly on 
bad terms. 
Finally, all of this important work 
will require that we keep our friends 
close. The United States needs to be a 
partner that neither strains alliances 
unnecessarily 
nor 
hands 
out 
free 
passes. President Biden should con-
tinue prodding our partners to honor 
their promises, pay their share, and 
put real capabilities on the table—and 
reemphasize that we have their backs. 
One early test for the new adminis-
tration and congressional Democrats 
will be the defense budget. If President 
Biden and his team are serious about 
contesting China, Russia, and these 
other threats, they will need to show 
it. Without continued, robust invest-
ment in a modern global force pres-
ence, American leadership would be lit-
tle more than hollow rhetoric. 
I voted to get President Biden’s top 
foreign policy advisers on the job swift-
ly. I hope and expect that our shared 
work will lead to frequent, close, and 
bipartisan work with the Senate.

IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, 
January 27, marks an anniversary, in a 
way, of an event that occurred in this 
Chamber 3 weeks ago, an event on Jan-
uary 6, which some of us will never for-
get. 
We are in the midst of preparing for 
an impeachment trial of President 
Donald Trump for any responsibility 
that he bears for that day’s events. 
Some have said we shouldn’t do that, 
that we shouldn’t have an impeach-
ment trial. 
The former U.N. Ambassador and 
Governor of South Carolina, Nikki 
Haley, said in an interview on FOX tel-
evision it is time for America to get 
over it—get over it. She is not the only 
one who has expressed that point of 
view. 
I was in the airport in Chicago last 
week in a waiting area to get on a 
plane when someone seated nearby 
said: Hey, Senator, get over it. Let this 
President ride off into the sunset. 
Those were his words: Get over it. 
It is hard to get over it if you lived 
it, and many of us in this Chamber did. 
Last night, there was a vote as to 
whether we should go forward with the 
impeachment. All of the Democrats, 50, 
voted in favor of having the trial, since 
we received that Article from the 
House. Five—five—Republicans joined 
us. Forty-five Republicans voted to end 
the impeachment proceeding, voting in 
favor of the point of order that was 
raised by the junior Senator from Ken-
tucky. 
I don’t know what was going through 
their minds when they joined that 
point of order from the Senator from 
Kentucky. I don’t know if it truly was 
a constitutional issue they were think-
ing about, whether it was loyalty to 
Donald Trump, or whether it was fear 
of Trump’s followers in their home 
States that led them to vote to end the 
impeachment inquiry. 
But we should move forward. We 
should go forward, as Lincoln reminded 
us, because we cannot escape history, 
and we certainly shouldn’t be party to 
rewriting history. 
When almost 50 percent of Trump 
loyalists refuse to believe that the 
events 3 weeks ago in this Capitol oc-
curred or, if they occurred, that they 
had anything to do with President 
Trump, we need to make a record, a 
record of fact, not just for our current 
deliberations but for history. 
How can anyone who was in this 
Chamber on January 6 really argue 
that nothing critical and important 
and horrific occurred? 
Do you remember at 2:15, when the 
Secret Service went up and grabbed the 
Vice President by his arms and pulled 
him down, out that door, so they could 
take him to a secure place? We were 
stunned by that. I was. 
They told us to sit here. And do you 
know what I saw next? Two men, plain-
clothes security people—I don’t know 
what Agency they were working for— 
came right down here, right down in 
the middle of this well. Why do I re-
member that they were there? Because 
one of them had an automatic weapon 
around his neck, in the Senate Cham-
ber. 
Then we were told by a Capitol po-
liceman who stood in front of us: Sit 
down. Stay in your seats. We are bring-
ing in your staff and locking the doors. 
This will be a secure room. Then they 
closed the doors off to the public, and 
we sat here for a few minutes. 
And then the same policeman said: 
Leave. 
Evacuate 
quickly, 
out 
the 
doors. The crowd, the mob, was advanc-
ing and getting closer to the Senate 
Chamber.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S160 
January 27, 2021 
We went out the back corridor and 
down the steps. As you go down the 
steps, there is a window that looks out 
on the sidewalk near the Capitol Build-
ing, and I saw this mob coming at us 
with Trump flags and American flags 
and signs—coming right at us. We hur-
ried down those steps and through the 
long tunnel to, we hoped, a safe loca-
tion in one of the office buildings near-
by. 
I will never forget it. Do the 45 Sen-
ators who voted against the impeach-
ment trial last night still remember it? 
I certainly hope they do, and I cer-
tainly hope they can recall it as they 
watch the videotapes, the mountain of 
videotapes of what happened that day. 
And, of course, I hope we all remem-
ber what the Capitol Police went 
through. For those who say they love 
law and order, take a look at what 
they went through when this mob came 
after them. They were beaten. One 
gave his life. And we can never forget. 
So how did this come about? Was this 
just a spontaneous gathering of people 
who decided to come to Capitol Hill? 
Far from it. The President of the 
United 
States, 
Donald 
Trump, 
re-
quested his followers to come to Wash-
ington on January 6. Why did he pick 
January 6? Because the Constitution 
says that is the day when Congress will 
count the electoral votes and deter-
mine who will be the next President. 
And because President Trump refused 
to accept the reality of his loss on No-
vember 3 and continued in every imag-
inable way to try to change the num-
bers coming out of States like Georgia, 
he called his followers to Washington 
on that day and held a rally on the El-
lipse. 
We have a tape of that rally, and it 
should be part of the record as to what 
this President said to his followers who 
had gathered on that day, how his rhet-
oric inflamed them. We can see it. It is 
a matter of record. 
Then he pointed to the Capitol Build-
ing, this building, and told them to 
come up here. Why? Because we were in 
the process of counting the electoral 
votes, which would finally and con-
stitutionally announce that he had lost 
the election. It was his last desperate 
gasp to keep the White House, even at 
the expense of the Constitution and re-
ality. 
Then the crowd turned and advanced 
on the Capitol. We have seen those vid-
eotapes as well, as they overran the 
flimsy barricades that were set up in 
the hopes that they would discourage 
and stop them. And they broke through 
windows and doors, came into this 
building, invading it for the first time 
since 1814. 
It was 1814 when the British forces 
came into this building, burned it, as 
an invasion. Well, this was a new inva-
sion, an invasion by those who were ei-
ther inspired by this President or, for 
whatever political reasons, decided to 
try to stop this government. 
It is the first time that has ever hap-
pened since 1814. I will never forget it. 
I am sorry to say that the 45 Senators 
who said stop the investigation, stop 
the impeachment, may not have as 
clear a memory as I do. 
Each year, we have a commemora-
tion of George Washington’s Farewell 
Address, and a different Member of the 
Senate is asked to read it on the floor 
of the Senate. I have to tell you that, 
honestly, I don’t come to the floor and 
listen carefully. It doesn’t have the im-
pact it once had. It is a commemora-
tion which is honorific but doesn’t 
have the real power to create a mem-
ory. 
Doug Jones is a former Senator from 
Alabama, and he said on Martin Luther 
King’s birthday, or nearby, we should 
all come to the floor and hear a reading 
of King’s letter from the Birmingham 
jail, and I think that is appropriate and 
it is good. 
How will we remember and com-
memorate January 6? Maybe it is too 
soon to think about that, but how can 
we forget what happened that day? 
How can we possibly get over it? 
I don’t want to get over it. I want to 
face it squarely and honestly with the 
facts. History demands it of us. Those 
of us who are honored to serve in this 
Chamber bear a responsibility to keep 
the facts alive, not let those who wish 
to ignore them or rewrite history have 
the last word. 
We now have a responsibility to go 
forward with this impeachment trial, 
to make a record and decide as a U.S. 
Senate. We owe it to the people we rep-
resent. That is for sure. But, more im-
portantly, we owe it to future genera-
tions to show them just how fragile a 
democracy can be when a mob turns on 
the U.S. Capitol and tries to stop the 
business of this government. 
The good news is this. If there is any 
source of elation, it is this: We re-
turned to the Capitol that same day, 
January 6, and finished our business of 
counting the electoral vote. In the 
early hours of the morning of January 
7, Joseph Biden was announced the 
winner of the Presidency, and just 2 
weeks later—2 weeks later to the day— 
he was sworn in as President of the 
United States. 
Our democracy survived this mob 
that came forward in insurrection 
against our government, and we are 
now in the beginning of the second 
week of the Biden Presidency. He has 
spoken to the American people and 
told them we are going to come to-
gether; we are going to unify. Bless 
him for doing that. 
We owe him this opportunity. We owe 
it to our country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

ROE V. WADE 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last Fri-
day, we observed the 48th anniversary 
of Roe v. Wade—the Supreme Court de-
cision that legalized abortion through 
all 9 months of pregnancy. It is a som-
ber day every year, as we contemplate 
the millions of lives lost to abortion 
since the Roe v. Wade decision. 
Gallup has been polling on abortion 
for decades, and if you look at the poll-
ing on the issue, one thing becomes 
clear: The majority of Americans do 
not believe in unrestricted abortion. 
Some believe that abortion should be 
completely illegal. Some believe abor-
tion should be legal under certain cir-
cumstances. But the majority of Amer-
icans do not believe in unrestricted 
abortion. 
Why is that? Why, despite the best 
efforts of the far left, do the majority 
of Americans think there should be at 
least some restrictions on abortion? I 
suspect the answer is that every person 
knows on some level that when we are 
talking about abortion, we are talking 
about a baby, a human being. It is not 
rocket science; it is biology 101. Human 
moms and dads have human babies. 
Take one look at an ultrasound, at a 
baby girl sucking her thumb or a baby 
boy kicking his feet, and it is pretty 
hard to argue that is just a clump of 
cells. 
I believe that is why, despite years of 
fierce abortion advocacy from the far 
left, the majority of Americans do not 
believe in unrestricted abortion, be-
cause they know—they know—the un-
born child is a human being, and they 
know a human being deserves to be 
protected even when they are small 
and weak and vulnerable—especially 
when they are small and weak and vul-
nerable. 
The truth is, advocates of abortion 
are fighting an uphill battle. It doesn’t 
always feel like that. After all, they 
have a lot of support from the enter-
tainment industry and magazines and 
media outlets and Democratic politi-
cians. The pro-abortion left has a lot of 
money. They have won too many vic-
tories, and too many babies have been 
killed. But despite their money and 
platform and advantage, in 48 years, 
advocates for abortion have not won 
their fight. They have not managed to 
convince anywhere close to a majority 
of Americans that abortion is an un-
qualified good and should be available 
unrestricted and on demand, and that 
is because, for all their advantages, 
they are fighting an unwinnable battle 
because they are fighting against re-
ality, they are fighting against truth, 
they are fighting against science, and 
they are fighting against the knowl-
edge that is written on every human 
heart, a truth that gets obscured but is 
hard to completely erase, and that is, 
every human being has value and de-
serves to be protected. 
Last week, I came down to the floor 
to praise President Biden’s call for 
unity, and I suggested that one way he 
could show that commitment was by

nominating individuals for key posts 
who represent a majority of Americans 
instead of the far-left wing of his party. 
I think several of the President’s nomi-
nations have demonstrated his com-
mitment to unity. While perhaps not 
the people I would have chosen, I be-
lieve that a number of his nominees 
will serve Americans well, and I have 
voted accordingly, casting votes in 
favor of President Biden’s choice for 
Director of National Intelligence and 
Secretary of Defense, among others. 
But unfortunately President Biden 
has also nominated some individuals 
who represent the extreme left of the 
Democratic Party rather than main-
stream Americans, and nowhere is that 
more true than with his radically pro- 
abortion nominee for Secretary of 
Health and Human Services. 
As a Member of the House of Rep-
resentatives, Javier Becerra accumu-
lated an overwhelmingly pro-abortion 
voting record, even opposing a ban on 
partial-birth abortion—a procedure so 
heinous and repulsive, it is difficult 
even to describe. As attorney general 
of California, he used his position to 
advance the pro-abortion cause. 
On top of that, he has shown a dis-
turbing tendency to use his position to 
attack freedom of religion and freedom 
of conscience. As California attorney 
general, he sued an order of nuns who 
care for the elderly poor to try to force 
them to offer health insurance benefits 
that violate their faith. That is right— 
he thought it a good use of his time as 
attorney general to sue an order of 
nuns who care for the elderly poor. He 
also enthusiastically sought to enforce 
a California law that forced crisis preg-
nancy centers to advertise abortion 
services. The case went all the way to 
the Supreme Court, which overturned 
the California law because it violated 
the free speech protection of the First 
Amendment. 
It is bad to support evils like abor-
tion. It is worse to not only support an 
evil but to attempt to force others to 
participate in it in violation of their 
consciences. 
I know the President is a man of 
faith, which makes it particularly per-
plexing why he would choose to nomi-
nate an individual who has used his po-
sition to attack freedom of religion and 
freedom of conscience. As head of the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services, Mr. Becerra would have the 
ability to not only push an extremist 
abortion agenda but to roll back im-
portant progress made to protect indi-
viduals’ conscience rights. I am dis-
appointed by the President’s choice. 
Javier Becerra’s pro-abortion views do 
not represent the views of the majority 
of Americans. 
I am also very disappointed by the 
announcement that President Biden 
will overturn the Mexico City policy, 
which protects taxpayer dollars from 
being used to finance abortion in other 
countries. This is not a unifying ac-
tion. Americans were not clamoring to 
have their tax dollars start supporting 
abortions abroad. This is only a pri-
ority for the pro-abortion lobby. 
As I said, I am disappointed in the 
President’s actions, and going forward, 
I hope he will not let his Presidency be 
hijacked by abortion extremists. But 
whatever policies this administration 
pursues, I and many of my colleagues 
will continue to work to promote a cul-
ture of life in this country. The arc— 
the arc—of the moral universe is long, 
but I believe it does bend towards jus-
tice. I look forward to the day that we 
will secure justice for unborn human 
beings by ensuring that they are pro-
tected. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

f 
IMMIGRATION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, as 
we move through what is appearing to 
be a choppy start to the 117th Congress, 
I think it is worth reminding ourselves 
of the standards that guide our work 
here. The mandate that we have does 
not come from the 24-hour news cycle 
or from lobbyists or advocacy groups, 
but it comes, very simply, from the 
Constitution. It is the foundation of 
the rule of law, our Nation’s Constitu-
tion, and it really serves as a pretty 
good policymaking guideline. 
The American people are looking at 
what is going on here, and they see the 
cracks that Washington has made in 
the foundation of this Constitution. 
These realizations have eroded their 
confidence in our ability as a body to 
perform the basic functions of govern-
ment without devolving into partisan 
chaos when faced with disagreements. 
Many times I will hear Tennesseans 
say: What happened to robust political 
debate? What happened to being able to 
agreeably disagree and have a discus-
sion? Are those days totally lost, or 
can we return to them? They are ask-
ing themselves how many shortcuts— 
like Executive orders—Washington is 
going to take before the shortcut be-
comes the rule or the norm and how 
many times can Washington chip away 
at the standards that govern our coun-
try before those standards start to 
crumble or are not relevant. 
Restoring the trust of the American 
people will not be easy because this 
fundamental lack of faith in our insti-
tutions has caused Americans to ques-
tion their very safety and security in 
the physical space and also in the vir-
tual world that they have been forced 
into by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I like to say we have a lot of security 
moms who are out there—moms and 
grandmoms like me—and, quite frank-
ly, they are out in full force, alongside 
millions of other Americans who now 
have cause to wonder if their own gov-
ernment will bother making their secu-
rity a priority. What about their com-
munities? What about their neighbor-
hoods? What about the universities 
where their children go to school? 
What is going to be done about riots? 
What about the virtual space? As they 
have seen their children move to online 
school, more of their daily functional 
life and their transactional life has 
moved online. How do they keep their 
families safe? How do they protect 
their rights to privacy? 
In the physical space, yesterday we 
got the good news that a Federal judge 
has granted a temporary restraining 
order barring the Department of Home-
land Security from implementing a na-
tionwide pause on most deportations. 
That pause was mandated by a DHS 
memo signed by the Acting Secretary 
on day one of the Biden administra-
tion—not such a great start for the ad-
ministration’s 
immigration 
policy 
team, but the American people will 
benefit from having the time that has 
come to them to ask questions about 
proposed shifts in existing policy. Peo-
ple want to be safe. 
I would like to just stipulate for the 
record that immigration law is very 
complex. While most Americans aren’t 
experts in the finer points of immigra-
tion law, they do have and most of us 
have a very common touchstone that 
we relate to; that is, having a secure 
border. 
This should be a basic concept—let’s 
secure the border; let’s secure our 
country—but somehow we have man-
aged to politicize that point that advo-
cates at the highest levels of the Fed-
eral Government—for what? A weak-
ened border. Just imagine that. You 
have individuals at the highest level of 
the Federal Government who are say-
ing: Let’s weaken our border. That is 
stunning, absolutely stunning to Ten-
nesseans. 
Why would you not protect your bor-
der? Why would you not want to know 
who is coming into your country? Why 
should I be forced to accept a lax bor-
der? Why should I be accepting of al-
lowing drug cartels to run those drugs 
into the country? Why should I be told 
I should accept human trafficking; I 
should accept gangs; I should accept 
sex traffickers coming in across the 
border? 
When we have a weak border, this is 
what 
you 
get. 
Every 
town—every 
town—becomes a border town. Every 
State becomes a border State because 
of the impacts—the negative impacts— 
of drug trafficking, sex trafficking, 
human trafficking, and the toll that 
that takes on our communities. 
Last week, I introduced two key 
pieces of legislation that attack spe-
cific vulnerabilities in our body of im-
migration law that thousands of bad 
actors use to game the system every 
year. 
The first is the Stop Greenlighting 
Driver Licenses for Illegal Immigrants

January 27, 2021 
Act. It does exactly what it sounds 
like. It blocks certain Federal funds 
from reaching the coffers of sanctuary 
States. This includes States that defy 
Federal immigration law or that allow 
individuals to obtain a driver license 
without providing proof that they are 
here legally or without providing proof 
that they are who they claim to be. 
This is no small penalty, and here is 
why. 
In 2020, our Nation had 15 States plus 
the District of Columbia that have de-
cided to give illegal immigrants a valid 
State-issued ID, a driver license. These 
15 States and DC got $53 million in JAG 
grants from the Department of Justice. 
These are funds—these are Justice As-
sistance Grants that are given to local 
law enforcement and criminal justice 
projects to do what? Enforce the law. 
So if you are not going to enforce the 
law, why should you get the money? 
Those funds should go to entities that 
have said: We will abide by the rule of 
law. That is where those funds should 
go. 
Now, the second bill is the Ban Birth 
Tourism Act. This would amend the 
Immigration and Nationality Act to 
prohibit pregnant foreigners from ob-
taining a temporary visitor visa they 
could use to enter the United States 
specifically for the purpose of giving 
birth here. Yes, you heard me right. 
There is a loophole in the law, in the 
Immigration and Nationality Act. Be-
cause of this, we have some pregnant 
foreigners, primarily from Russia and 
China, who circumvent the law, and 
they get a temporary visitor visa, and 
they come here working with some of 
this multimillion-dollar-a-year birth 
tourism industry. They get coached. 
They come here. They go to a facility. 
They give birth. The child becomes a 
citizen, and then they return. As I said, 
primarily these are wealthy Russians 
and wealthy Chinese. 
Our citizenship is not for sale. No, in-
deed. It is hard-fought. It is hard-won. 
It is hard-kept. The American people 
are right to expect better than this. 
Tennesseans want to see something 
done about this. That is why I, once 
again, have filed this legislation. 
The American people are not unrea-
sonable. They do not lack compassion. 
They just don’t understand why offi-
cials who are charged with upholding 
the law would act in their official ca-
pacity to undermine something as 
basic as border security, as basic as na-
tional security. 
We have a lot of security moms out 
there who understand that it is no 
small task keeping things secure at 
home. All of these security moms out 
there know that there are plenty of 
threats online—threats that they can-
not see, but they know that there are a 
lot of these threats that come into 
their homes and onto their computer 
screens and onto the devices of their 
children because of a lack of privacy 
online. 
How we curate and protect our vir-
tual use, as I call it, is critically im-
portant because it defines who we are 
to the people who we do not see in per-
son. And as I mentioned earlier, more 
of our functional and transactional life 
is now online. So tomorrow, to mark 
National Data Privacy Day, I will once 
again reintroduce the BROWSER Act. 
Mr. President, as you and I served in 
the House together, I know you re-
member how I would introduce this 
bill, the BROWSER Act, to secure on-
line privacy for millions of Americans. 
Now, at its heart, this is an effort to 
inject awareness, transparency, and ac-
countability into the relationship be-
tween technology platforms and their 
users. 
This legislation sets up a very basic 
Federal compliance framework that 
tech companies can use as a guide to 
update their privacy policies online, 
make it something that is going to 
give you the ability to say: This is in-
formation that I want to share. 
It would require companies to secure 
an opt-in from consumers before col-
lecting their sensitive data. And for 
less sensitive information, you, the 
consumer, would have the ability to 
opt out and not share that browsing 
history with that company. 
Companies would not be able to deny 
you service if you want to practice 
your right to privacy. That makes 
common sense. It happens in the phys-
ical space every single day, and it 
should also be a right reserved to the 
individual in the virtual space. 
This also would put the Federal 
Trade Commission, our online privacy 
regulator, in charge of watching what 
is happening in the virtual space, ap-
plying these rules equally across the 
entire internet ecosystem. A right to 
privacy, being secure in our commu-
nities and our homes, is something 
that not only Tennesseans but millions 
of Americans are wanting to see.

TRIBUTE TO HEATH HUCKABAY 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
this week Team Blackburn is saying 
goodbye to Heath Huckabay, who came 
to us last January as part of a fellow-
ship program between my office and 
the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, 
which is located in Oak Ridge, just out-
side of Knoxville, TN. 
It has been an interesting year to say 
the least, but Heath has risen to the 
occasion and impressed each and every 
one of us with his breadth of knowledge 
and his ability to adapt to the hectic 
pace of life in the Senate. We did our 
best to persuade him to stay with us a 
little longer, but I am confident that 
his colleagues at Oak Ridge will be 
happy to see him return, as well as his 
wife Emily and little Elliot. They are 
looking forward to having him home. 
It was an honor working with him 
this past year. We will miss him, and 
we wish him all the best as he heads 
back to Tennessee. 
I yield the floor.

f 
ADVICE AND CONSENT 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
the Senate is focused on one of its con-
stitutional roles right now, which is 
meeting with and discussing with the 
new Biden administration’s Cabinet— 
our advice and consent role. The con-
sent role, obviously, is confirmation 
votes here on the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate, which we are doing a number of 
these on the floor and in committee. 
But there is also the advice role, given 
to us by the Founding Fathers. On the 
advice, we are providing whether we 
vote for some of these nominees or not 
to the Cabinet. It is a big part of the 
Senate’s role. So I am going to take a 
minute to provide a little bit of advice 
to some of the new, incoming Biden 
team. 
Now, look, we are seeing it particu-
larly in the foreign policy realm. A lot 
of the Biden team has actually come 
from the Obama-Biden team—maybe 
too many. You worry about stale 
thinking, because when they were in 
power 4 years ago, or a little bit over 4 
years ago, there are a lot of things that 
have changed in the world—particu-
larly on foreign policy, a lot that has 
happened in the world. So you need 
fresh views, but we are where we are. 
But an example of this kind of stale 
thinking that I was shocked to see re-
cently at the White House is the use of 
the term ‘‘strategic patience’’ as a for-
eign policy concept. Now, this was the 
phrase the Obama administration used 
to describe its policy toward North 
Korea, and I think most people would 
recognize—Democrats 
and 
Repub-
licans—that that was not a very suc-
cessful policy, a pretty failed policy. 
Now, granted, North Korea is dif-
ficult. There is no doubt. But the pol-
icy that was known as strategic pa-
tience was the policy that enabled the 
North Korea rogue regime to massively 
build up a nuclear arsenal. So kind of 
like leading from behind, the Obama 
administration’s term ‘‘strategic pa-
tience’’ became synonymous with a 
passive and even weak foreign policy 
approach as it related to North Korea, 
certainly. 
So I was very surprised yesterday to 
hear the White House Press Secretary 
trot out this term again, ‘‘strategic pa-
tience,’’ but this time when talking 
about the Biden administration’s pol-
icy with regard to China. 
Now, this is almost certainly music 
to 
China’s 
ears—the 
leadership 
of 
China—because it is kind of a subtle 
green light to Xi Jinping and the other 
authoritarians in China of its failure to 
uphold promise after promise to the 
United States—something I refer to as

‘‘promise fatigue’’ that we have here— 
or continuing to call itself a developing 
country, when it is not, or continuing 
its attempts to dominate the South 
China Sea with the militarization of 
that important strategic sea lane, or 
continuation of intellectual property 
theft, or all the challenges that we 
have with China. The idea that we are 
going to have strategic patience, I 
think, sends a signal to the Chinese 
that we don’t take these issues ur-
gently, and that is the wrong message. 
These are urgent issues. 
In my discussions during the con-
firmation process and in hearings with 
now-Secretary of Defense Austin and 
Secretary of State Blinken, I sensed 
they had a sense of urgency. As a mat-
ter of fact, they both acknowledged 
that the previous administration—the 
Trump administration’s national secu-
rity strategy, national defense strategy 
that says we need to turn to great 
power competition, with China as the 
pacing threat for the United States, 
they agreed with. 
Even in General Austin’s—now-Sec-
retary Austin’s—confirmation hearing, 
one of my colleagues, Senator BLACK-
BURN, actually said this term, ‘‘stra-
tegic patience,’’ doesn’t seem to be the 
right term and pressed him on it. 
So here is some continued advice. In 
the Senate’s role, in terms of our con-
stitutional role of advice and consent, 
words matter, especially from the 
White House podium. We need a strong, 
bipartisan, and lasting China policy 
from the United States of America. 
This is the biggest geostrategic issue 
we will be facing as a country for the 
next 50 to 100 years, but it is also a 
challenge that is here and now, a chal-
lenge that needs immediate action. So 
here is my advice: Ditch the ‘‘strategic 
patience’’ phrase. 
The vast majority of the Senators in 
this body, Democrats and Republicans, 
want to know the Biden administration 
is focused on this challenge now. It is a 
serious challenge that China poses to 
the United States now, and ‘‘strategic 
patience’’ sends the wrong message to 
the Senate, to the American people, 
and to China’s leadership. So they need 
to do better. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, let 
me express my gratitude to the Sen-
ator from Alaska for his words. I could 
not have said it better than he did, and 
I am grateful to him for coming and ar-
ticulating that important message so 
clearly and emphatically. 
Chris Wray, the FBI Director, is a 
pretty laid-back guy. As a matter of 
fact, I frequently tell people he re-
minds me of the typical G-man—you 
know, not a lot of emotion, not a lot of 
animation. But the FBI Director, who I 
think is doing an outstanding job and 
has been doing an outstanding job, gets 
positively animated when it comes to 
China and the threats presented there. 
Of course, the FBI is principally in 
charge of the counterintelligence mis-
sion against foreign countries like 
China that try to steal our intellectual 
property, spy on our country using a 
number unconventional means. I just 
want to say to our friend from Alaska: 
Thank you for making that point. It is 
really, really important. 
f 
NOMINATION OF ANTONY JOHN 
BLINKEN 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, yes-
terday afternoon we confirmed another 
one of President Biden’s Cabinet nomi-
nees. Antony Blinken has led an im-
pressive career in the public sector and 
is well versed in both the vast respon-
sibilities of the State Department, as 
well as the diplomatic challenges we 
will face in the months and years 
ahead, the most important of which is 
China, but it is not China alone. 
While Mr. Blinken and I have policy 
differences—some of them very seri-
ous—I have confidence in his ability to 
represent our Nation on the global 
stage. It is important for a new Presi-
dent, whether they be a Republican or 
a Democrat, to have qualified, Senate- 
confirmed officials in their Cabinet 
without delay. 
Over the past week, we have worked 
to confirm nominees for some of the 
most critical Federal Departments and 
Agencies. The Secretaries of State, De-
fense, Treasury, as well as the Director 
of National Intelligence, have each 
been confirmed by the Senate with 
broad bipartisan support. And we will 
continue to process more of the Presi-
dent’s nominees in the days ahead. 
Four years ago, our Democratic col-
leagues approached President Trump’s 
nominees with a grab bag of antics, in-
cluding everything from intentional 
delays to brazen theatrics. In most 
cases, this behavior wasn’t a reflection 
on the nominee or their qualifications, 
but of our colleagues’ antipathy toward 
President Trump. 
Clearly we are adopting a different 
approach, and I hope it is one that will 
deescalate these battles and one that 
will serve the national interest rather 
than harm it. 
Throughout my time in the Senate, I 
have tried to evaluate nominees based 
on their qualifications, their integrity, 
and their ability to carry out the re-
sponsibilities for the job they have 
been nominated for, and I will continue 
to either support or oppose nominees 
based on those merits and those cri-
teria, not based on the party of the 
President. 
f 
NEW START 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, we 
know it has been the tradition of the 
Senate to prioritize nominees for na-
tional security positions, and there has 
never been a more critical time to en-
sure that President Biden is sur-
rounded by an experienced and capable 
team. From the threats posed by an in-
creasingly hostile Iran to those by an 
unpredictable North Korea, there are 
many, many challenges on the horizon. 
One of the first the administration 
must confront is the expiration of the 
New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, 
also known as New START. This is the 
only 
remaining 
bilateral 
strategic 
arms agreement between the United 
States and Russia, which are the 
world’s most powerful nuclear states, 
and it is set to expire in a matter of 
days. 
Last fall, the Trump administration 
advocated for a 1-year extension of New 
START, with the condition that both 
countries would cap nuclear weapons— 
nuclear warheads during that period. 
Unsurprisingly, Russia preferred a 
clean, 5-year extension with no war-
head limitations. President Putin de-
layed the final stages of talks in the 
hopes that the potential Biden admin-
istration would strike a deal more fa-
vorable to Russia. And it appears now, 
at least as things stand today, that 
President Putin has hedged his bets 
correctly. 
Following a call yesterday between 
President Biden and President Putin, 
the White House announced that the 
United States and Russia are set to ex-
tend New START for 5 years, with no 
conditions attached. This was Presi-
dent Biden’s first major foreign policy 
test, and, unfortunately, he played 
right into Russia’s hand. 
For starters, it is no secret that New 
START was deeply flawed from the be-
ginning. And it is no secret that Russia 
cheats, which is why verification is so 
essential. 
The counting mechanisms in New 
START don’t effectively keep our 
countries on a level playing field, 
which is the primary goal of any arms 
treaty because it promotes mutual de-
terrents. The treaty limits the number 
of bombers each nation could possess 
but places no limit on the number of 
warheads each bomber can support. 
Making matters worse, the limits only 
apply to strategic, not tactical, nuclear 
weapons. Russia has taken advantage 
of this loophole in New START, amass-
ing some 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons 
compared to only 500 for the United 
States. 
Russia’s nuclear doctrine signals its 
increasing willingness to use those tac-
tical nuclear weapons in a conflict, 
particularly in Europe, as it warily 
eyes NATO. Another 5 years under New 
START will allow Russia to continue 
growing its arsenal of tactical weapons 
and cement its advantage over the 
United States, perhaps permanently. 
Once that happens, the likelihood of 
Russia deploying and ultimately using 
these weapons goes higher. These trea-
ties ought to make the world safer, not 
a more dangerous place due to imbal-
ances, the potential for mistakes, or 
miscalculation. 
Beyond sheer numbers, there is also 
the question of trust or, I should say, 
of verification, because it is hardly 
controversial to say Russia isn’t the 
most trustworthy partner. Last fall,

the Kremlin attempted to poison a 
Putin opponent using a nerve agent. 
Russia has launched massive cyber at-
tacks against private companies and 
government 
agencies 
here 
in 
the 
United States, the latest being the 
SolarWinds hack. And last year, it at-
tempted to steal coronavirus vaccine 
data from the United States and some 
of our closest allies. 
In short, Russia does not play by the 
rules, and New START does little to 
prevent further cheating. By granting 
Putin’s request for a clean 5-year ex-
tension of New START, the Biden ad-
ministration will not only be reward-
ing Russia for its hostile actions 
against the United States and our al-
lies but also enabling Russia and other 
nuclear states to continue growing 
their 
stockpiles 
while 
the 
United 
States plays by outdated rules: no cap 
on nuclear warheads, no enhanced veri-
fication measures—in short, no need 
for assurances for Russia to follow the 
rules laid out in New START. 
The expected treaty extension by the 
Biden administration wouldn’t address 
any of those blinking red lights. The 
biggest failure of a clean, 5-year exten-
sion, though, is relinquishing the lever-
age we currently have to take a more 
comprehensive approach to nuclear dis-
armament. 
As I said, the United States and Rus-
sia are the most powerful nuclear 
states in the world, but together we ac-
count for only two of the five nuclear 
armed states recognized by the non-
proliferation treaty. Two of the other 
countries, the United Kingdom and 
France—both of whom provide regular 
information about the size and makeup 
of their nuclear arsenal—are not a 
problem. 
The fifth and final power is China, 
one of the world’s biggest secret keep-
ers. It is a police state and opaque, as 
we learned once again when it came to 
the virus from Wuhan Province. 
As if we needed a reminder of the 
critical information China withheld 
from the rest of the world, all we need 
to do is look at the COVID–19 pan-
demic. The first cases of COVID–19 ap-
peared in China as early as November 
of 2019, and the Communist Party of 
China willfully withheld the informa-
tion from the rest of the world, and it 
sought to downplay the potential im-
pact of the virus. China repeatedly si-
lenced the brave men and women of its 
own country who tried to sound the 
alarm, and, as a result, countries 
around the world were ill-prepared for 
these critical early stages of the fight 
against COVID–19. Now, more than 2.1 
million people have died from this 
virus, 
including 
more 
than 
420,000 
Americans. 
It is impossible to gauge how many 
of those lives could have been saved by 
earlier intervention, but this should 
serve as a cautionary tale when it 
comes to managing threats from China. 
We cannot allow China to continue sit-
ting on the sidelines while the four 
other nuclear states play by the rules 
as we hope they will. The administra-
tion must push to get China to the ne-
gotiating table—at the negotiating 
table. 
The thick cloak of secrecy sur-
rounding 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party has made it nearly impossible to 
verify information about the breadth 
and the depth of China’s nuclear capa-
bilities. What we do know is that China 
continues to pursue a nuclear triad, 
and experts estimate China to have 
about 300 nuclear weapons. 
Assuming that figure is correct, it 
puts China slightly ahead of France 
and the United Kingdom in terms of 
raw numbers. That would make China 
the third most powerful nuclear state 
in the world, and we have every reason 
to believe that the size of its arsenal 
will continue to grow. 
In May of 2019, then-Director for the 
Defense Intelligence Agency, GEN Rob-
ert Ashley, said China is likely to at 
least double the size of its nuclear 
stockpile over the next decade. He re-
ferred to this effort as ‘‘the most rapid 
expansion and diversification of its nu-
clear arsenal in China’s history.’’ 
Despite this already large and con-
stantly growing nuclear threat, there 
are virtually no measures in place to 
hold China accountable or to bring 
them to the table. A simple extension 
of the New START leaves in place a 
framework 
in 
which 
the 
Russians 
cheat, the Chinese are not at the table, 
and the United States is playing by the 
rules of a bygone era. 
This must change. It must change. If 
you think about the fact that since 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear weap-
ons have not been used on this planet, 
it is a result of tough negotiations and 
a system of mutual deterrence because 
we know, were nuclear weapons to be 
used, that it could result in the exter-
mination of the planet. 
So that is why deterrence is so im-
portant. That is why reciprocity and 
transparency are so important. The 
Cold War-era approach to nuclear dis-
armament does not make sense in the 
modern world. Rather than enter a 5- 
year extension of New START, the ad-
ministration should use its leverage to 
convene multilateral talks. America 
should invite the other nuclear non-
proliferation 
treaty 
states—Russia, 
China, France, and the UK—to the ne-
gotiating table and encourage multi-
lateral talks aimed at limiting the 
growth of nuclear arsenals globally. 
There is far too much at stake to 
merely cave in to the demands of Presi-
dent Putin in Moscow and cave in as 
well to the recalcitrance of Beijing to 
come to the table. The administration 
must 
pursue 
a 
multilateral, 
com-
prehensive approach. It is the only 
practical and workable solution to the 
vast nuclear threats posed by both 
China and Russia.

f 
48TH ANNUAL MARCH FOR LIFE 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, this week 
is the 48th annual March for Life. It is 
an event when thousands of Americans 
come together to advocate for the 
value and protection of unborn human 
life. 
They will be coming together this 
year differently than they have for al-
most 50 years, but for almost 50 years, 
millions of people have marched to 
Capitol Hill to try to build a culture 
wherein every human life is valued and 
every human life is protected. That in-
cludes tireless women and men and 
children from my home State of Mis-
souri who come to Washington, both 
individually and along with the Mis-
souri Life Caravan, every year. It will 
be the first year in a long time I 
haven’t spoken to that group in person, 
but as they meet virtually, their cause 
is still as resonant as it is in person. 
I know that Missourians will con-
tinue to advocate for life. They will 
continue to remember the unborn and 
those whom we have lost from abor-
tion. This year’s theme of the march is 
‘‘Together Strong: Life Unites!’’ It is a 
pretty hard theme to argue with no 
matter how you feel about this par-
ticular topic. ‘‘Unity’’ doesn’t mean be-
lieving the same thing about every-
thing, but it does mean agreeing about 
one very important thing in terms of 
this event, and that important thing, 
of course, is the value and protection of 
life. 
This belief in life cuts across reli-
gion. It cuts across party lines. It cuts 
across geographic boundaries. People 
and organizations from all religious 
backgrounds—and even those who have 
no religious affiliations—are part of 
the pro-life movement, and they oppose 
abortion in almost all cases. Polling 
shows that more than a third of Demo-
crats in America support protections 
for life, and there are groups dedicated 
to showing that pro-life is not a par-
tisan issue. Frankly, that is a move in 
the right direction to where you don’t 
feel like you are included in one party 
or excluded from one party because of 
your view on this issue. 
Last year’s Geneva Consensus Dec-
laration brought together more than 30 
countries to promote women’s health 
and strengthen the family, including 
the preservation of human life. We 
need to do everything we can to save 
the lives of babies and of mothers. Ma-
ternity mortality is a big problem in 
our country and around the world. It 
has become a focus of the Congress in 
recent years and needs to continue to 
be. Even though the issue of life so 
often is polarized in the U.S. Congress, 
I am still encouraged that we see a 
powerful commitment, over and over,

to protect the unborn and how that 
breaks through in other areas outside 
of the Congress. For the past 4 years, 
we have seen an unprecedented advance 
in the protections for the unborn in 
State legislatures. 
In the next few years, we can expect 
to see efforts to try to move things in 
another direction, to weaken or remove 
life protections in, for instance, the 
title X family planning program or in 
our foreign aid programs. There is a 
well-funded effort to abandon even the 
longstanding Hyde amendment, which 
prevents taxpayer funding of abortion 
or 
abortion 
coverage 
in 
Federal 
healthcare programs. 
As the chairman of the Labor, Health 
and Human Services Appropriations 
Committee, I oversaw the yearly re-
newal of the Hyde amendment, which 
has been included in that bill for the 
past 40 years. Now I won’t be the chair-
man of that committee in this Con-
gress, but I will still be fighting to see 
that we maintain this area where there 
has been great consensus that went be-
yond political parties. 
I will continue to support and advo-
cate for the Hyde amendment and for 
permanent Federal protections for the 
unborn through legislation like the 
Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection 
Act and the No Taxpayer Funding for 
Abortion Act, among other things. 
Although the pro-life movement can 
expect challenges in this Congress, 
there are still many signs that one day 
we will succeed in creating a culture 
where every human life is valued and 
protected. For now, however, I want to 
thank the men, women, and children 
who dedicate their time and talents to 
making this happen, who today are 
marching virtually as they join to-
gether to talk about this important 
cause and remember the theme of this 
year, which is ‘‘Together Strong: Life 
Unites!’’

I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask

the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
INTERNATIONAL HOLOCAUST 
REMEMBRANCE DAY 
Mr. 
CARDIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today the world comes together to re-
member the horrors of the Holocaust. 
We honor the 6 million Jews and 5 mil-
lion others—Roma, Afro-Germans, gay 
men and women, people with disabil-
ities and more—whom the Nazis bru-
tally murdered. And we stand in awe 
and celebration of those brave souls 
who managed to survive. 
It is difficult to comprehend the ter-
ror that took place in Europe between 
1939 and 1945, but we carry on an obli-
gation to those who perished and those 
who survived to prevent further geno-
cide and mass atrocities. It is critical 
that we understand what happened to 
them so we can prevent it from ever 
happening again. 
One of the most important things to 
understand about the Holocaust is that 
while a limited group of particularly 
evil monsters orchestrated it, they 
could not have succeeded without the 
active or tacit support of millions of 
average people. Men and women agreed 
to turn over their neighbors, patrol the 
ghettos, drive the cattle cars, guard 
the death camps, and line people up to 
shoot them down. Men and women de-
cided to avert their gaze and do noth-
ing to stop the atrocities. 
I don’t believe that all those people 
were born villains. I think they were 
taught by their communities to adopt 
a level of anti-Semitism and prejudice 
that likely would have been recogniz-
able to many of us today and that the 
Nazi 
propaganda 
masters 
exploited 
those feelings. That terrifies me be-
cause it means that the Holocaust was 
not an anomaly. It means that under 
the right conditions, a similar atrocity 
could happen again. 
The hatred that gave rise to the Hol-
ocaust is still very much alive. The 
Anti-Defamation League’s 2014 Global 
Index of Anti-Semitism found that 
more than 1 billion people—nearly one 
in eight—around the world harbor anti- 
Semitic attitudes. Over 30 percent of 
those surveyed said that it was ‘‘prob-
ably true’’ that Jews had too much 
control over financial markets, that 
Jews think they are better than other 
people, that Jews are disloyal to their 
country, and that people hate Jews be-
cause of the way that Jews behave. 
Such sentiments often translate into 
violence, leading 40 percent of Euro-
pean Jews to report in 2018 that they 
lived in daily fear of being physically 
attacked. 
Sadly, these trends bear out closer to 
home too. Jews make up fewer than 3 
percent of the American population, 
but the majority of reported religion- 
based hate crimes targeted Jewish peo-
ple or institutions. In 2019, the ADL re-
ported that anti-Semitism in America 
had hit a four-decade high. According 
to the 2020 survey by the American 
Jewish Committee, more than one- 
third of American Jews say they have 
been verbally or physically assaulted 
during the past 5 years simply because 
they are Jewish. 
I believe that the world looks to the 
United States for moral leadership. 
When we allow anti-Semitism or rac-
ism or other kinds of intolerance to 
flourish here, other countries take that 
as a license to do the same. Moreover, 
we need to recognize the nexus between 
and networking among those who traf-
fic in hate and conspiracies in the 
United States and other like-minded 
individuals and groups around the 
globe. Combating the most dangerous 
forms of this bigotry will require un-
derstanding the ways in which such 
groups are reinforcing and learning 
from each other. 
Unfortunately, the last 4 years—be-
ginning with White nationalists chant-
ing ‘‘Jews will not replace us’’ in Char-
lottesville and ending with an insurrec-
tionist wearing a ‘‘Camp Auschwitz’’ 
sweatshirt while storming the Cap-
itol—are a dark stain on this country’s 
record. By allowing such vicious hatred 
to take root and to grow, we fail our-
selves, and we fail the rest of the 
world. 
Now we have the opportunity to re-
deem 
ourselves—to 
become 
leaders 
once more in the fight to eliminate 
anti-Semitism and all forms of hatred 
around the globe. It will not be easy, 
but it is something we have to do, and 
it starts with education. 
In the ADL’s 2014 global survey, 35 
percent of the respondents had never 
heard of the Holocaust, and 28 percent 
of those who did know of it believed 
that the number of Jews who died in 
the Holocaust had been greatly exag-
gerated. Meanwhile, the AJC’s 2020 
Survey of the General Public found 
that nearly one-quarter of Americans 
know nothing or not much about the 
Holocaust, and nearly one-half are not 
even sure what the term ‘‘anti-Semi-
tism’’ means. 
How can we hope to learn as a soci-
ety from the horrors of the Holocaust 
if so many people do not know or do 
not believe that it happened? How can 
we root out anti-Semitism if almost 
half of us don’t understand what it is? 
We must educate the next generation 
on the horrors of the Holocaust and the 
dangers of intolerance. I am proud to 
have led efforts to provide the full 
funding of a bill, which our Presiding 
Officer was very much involved with, 
the Never Again Education Act, and I 
thank our Presiding Officer for her 
leadership on this issue. That bill ex-
panded the reach of the U.S. Holocaust 
Memorial Museum’s world-renowned 
education program. This will allow 
educators across the country from K–12 
through college to access age-appro-
priate curriculum on the Holocaust. It 
will also bolster the Holocaust Memo-
rial Museum’s continued collection and 
use of survivor testimony so that to-
morrow’s leaders will see and hear for 
themselves why we must never again 
allow hatred to thrive. 
At the same time, we must fight 
against Holocaust denial in any form 
in any part of the world. As the Organi-
zation for Security and Co-operation in 
Europe’s 
Parliamentary 
Assembly’s 
Special Representative on Anti-Semi-
tism, Racism and Intolerance, I am 
committed to countering attempts to 
erase or revise the events of the Holo-
caust, such as Poland’s efforts to pun-
ish those who speak the truth about 
the 3 million Jews killed there. I am 
deeply disturbed, for instance, by the 
news of a slander lawsuit against two 
Polish scholars for their writings on 
Jews forced into hiding during the Nazi 
occupation. I am also appalled that 
Hungary’s Viktor Orban has erected a 
monument that tries to whitewash 
Hungary’s wartime role in the murder

of more than a half-million Hungarian 
Jews. On a day we remember the lib-
eration of Auschwitz, I remember, too, 
that one out of every three Jews who 
died there were Hungarian. 
The Holocaust happened, and it can 
happen again. It can. We made a prom-
ise to our grandparents and to our 
grandchildren that it would never hap-
pen again. I believe that we are all 
each 
responsible 
for 
keeping 
that

the past in order to build a more peace-
ful, just, and compassionate future for 
all.

f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to discuss some 
of the first actions that have been 
taken by the new administration. 
At his inauguration, President Biden 
spoke about the importance of uniting 
the country, bringing us together, the 
importance of unity. Well, I agree. We 
have been much too divided as a na-
tion. We need to bring America to-
gether. 
In just a few hours after his inau-
gural address, President Biden issued 
one Executive order after another that 
I believe is only going to drive America 
further apart. He hasn’t really reached 
out and hasn’t really tried to work 
with us. 
At a time when millions of people 
across the country are struggling with 
unemployment and the effects of a 
global pandemic, President Biden has 
taken actions that will actually raise 
the cost of living for people all across 
the country. In particular, President 
Biden has taken aim at American en-
ergy. 
Now, in Wyoming, energy production 
does a lot more than just keep the 
lights on. It puts food on the table. It 
does it for thousands of families. It 
pays for our schools, education, and 
our roads. 
In Wyoming we produce coal, oil, 
natural gas, and uranium for nuclear 
power. We also have incredible renew-
able resources. Wyoming, in many 
ways, has world class wind. We are ex-
periencing that today in Casper, WY. 
Wyoming has some of the largest re-
serves of energy in terms of resources 
anywhere in the country. In Wyoming 
we produce 15 times more energy than 
we use in our State. It actually makes 
us the country’s largest net energy 
supplier to the rest of the country. En-
ergy production is the economic life-
blood of Wyoming. It is a major source 
of revenue for, as I said, our schools, 
our roads, our bridges, and essential 
services for all of our citizens. 
Wyoming is very proud of our energy 
workers. Remarkable men and women 
every day get up and go to work to put 
food on the table, put clothing on their 
kids’ backs, and the whole country 
benefits from the energy that comes 
from Wyoming. 
Thanks to America’s energy workers, 
in 2019, America became energy inde-
pendent. It was the first time we had 
become independent in over 60 years. 
That makes it easier for families to 
make ends meet. It makes us stronger 
on the world stage. It decreases our re-
liance on energy from other sources, 
like foreign powers who want to do us 
harm. 
Thanks to our American energy 
workers, America is an energy super-
power, and I believe we should be act-
ing like one. That is why it is remark-
able when I see President Biden paint-
ing a target on the back of American 
energy. That is what he has been doing 
with his Executive orders, including 
today. 
Despite all of the talk about unity, 
one of the first things that President 
Biden has done in office is to directly 
attack—attack—energy-producing 
States like Wyoming. It has actually 
turned out to be his No. 1 priority. 
The White House is calling today 
‘‘climate day.’’ This morning, Presi-
dent Biden stopped all new oil, gas, and 
coal leases on Federal lands—today. 
Well, half of the State of Wyoming is 
federally owned. Even a greater per-
centage of that, Madam President, in 
your State is federally owned. 
Experts tell us that the long-term 
ban could cost us 33,000 jobs in Wyo-
ming. We are a State of only a half- 
million people. 
Earlier today, at a hearing of the En-
ergy 
and 
Natural 
Resources 
Com-
mittee, where I am the ranking mem-
ber, the senior Republican, I asked the 
President’s nominee for Secretary of 
Energy about how the President’s ban 
would affect jobs, and she admitted 
that in terms of jobs—she said some 
‘‘jobs . . . might be sacrificed.’’ 
Saying no to American energy pro-
duction means less energy, less eco-
nomic activity, and less money in the 
pockets of American workers. It is not 
going to do a thing to lower emissions. 
It won’t bring down global tempera-
tures, but it will bring down workers’ 
wages. It won’t cool down planet Earth, 
but it will cool down our Nation’s econ-
omy. Energy producers will simply go 
elsewhere while families in our country 
will suffer. 
President Biden has also put a stop 
to the Keystone Pipeline. It has been in 
the headlines. The pipeline creates 
jobs. It reduces energy prices, and it 
strengthens our bonds with our neigh-
bor to the north, with Canada. 
The Prime Minister of Canada, Jus-
tin Trudeau, is no conservative. He is 
known to be extremely progressive. 
Even he has said he was disappointed 
in the decision by President Biden to 
cancel the pipeline. President Biden’s 
very first phone call with a foreign 
leader since becoming President was 
with Prime Minister Trudeau. The 
Prime Minister raised the issue on the 
call. President Biden shut down the 
pipeline anyway. 
It has also been reported that TC En-
ergy warned the President’s adminis-
tration that the Keystone Pipeline 
means thousands of construction jobs, 
many of those union jobs. They are 
gone. They are gone. President Biden 
shut it down anyway. 
President Biden has also begun the 
process of putting us back into the 
Paris climate accord. Now, under that 
agreement, the Biden administration is 
going to set unworkable targets for 
American businesses. 
So what does it mean? Well, it hurts 
America, but it means China and Rus-
sia can continue with business as 
usual. It is a bad deal for our country. 
It makes us less competitive. It sac-
rifices energy jobs to try to stop cli-
mate change, which it will not do. 
The Paris climate agreement is based 
on the fantasy that climate change is 
America’s fault—blame America first. 
In reality, the United States is the 
leading driver of innovative climate so-
lutions. 
President 
Biden’s 
actions 
aren’t just targeting American energy, 
they are also going after American 
small businesses. 
President Biden is calling on this 
body to vote to double the Federal 
minimum wage to $15 an hour. Now, 
maybe the President’s idea of national 
unity is national uniformity, but that 
doesn’t work in Wyoming or for the 
people of Wyoming. Maybe he thinks 
that imposing top-down regulations on 
every American would bring us all to-
gether. It is not the kind of unity that 
the American people are looking for. 
We want to stand shoulder to shoulder 
but not in the unemployment line. 
In 2019, well before the pandemic hit, 
the nonpartisan Congressional Budget 
Office estimated that mandating a $15 
minimum wage nationwide would lead 
to 1.3 million fewer Americans work-
ing—1.3 million Americans. At a time 
when 10 million Americans are unem-
ployed due to our pandemic, 1.3 million 
Americans more can’t afford to lose 
their jobs. 
The CBO also says it will lead to 
higher prices for consumers—paying 
more wages, passing on prices to con-
sumers. Now this could hurt America’s 
small businesses all across the country. 
I talked to a small business owner from 
Lovell, WY, Jimmy Minchow, who has 
a Sinclair station there. He called me 
on Sunday. He said $15 an hour—there 
is a station and a food court next to it 
in Lovell. He said we would have to 
shut down the food court. We can’t af-
ford $15 an hour for the young people 
who are working there. Putting money 
in their pockets and providing food 
services to the people of the commu-
nity, $15 an hour will shut it down. So 
the jobs ticker is now on President

Biden’s watch, and the President will 
be judged by his decisions. 
Now, the Senate, right before Christ-
mas, passed another round of Paycheck 
Protection Programs we all supported. 
These are loans to help small busi-
nesses. I voted for it, and the Presiding 
Officer voted for it to help our small 
businesses. 
Doubling the minimum wage is going 
to hurt small businesses and going to 
force them to lay off employees like 
will likely happened in Lovell, WY, and 
all across the Cowboy State. It is going 
to hurt the very people these loans are 
supposed to be helping. 
A bill to provide $900 billion of relief 
was signed just in late December. 
President Biden now wants to double 
that amount of funding. Now, Demo-
crats may try to ram the bill through 
the Senate using a process called budg-
et reconciliation. Now, of course, this 
entire cost will be added to our na-
tional debt, and if it occurs, it will 
likely be done without a single Repub-
lican vote. 
This isn’t unity. It is not bipartisan-
ship. It is not healing our divisions. 
This is a time for President Biden to 
heed the words of his own inaugural ad-
dress. We need to work together to 
lower the cost of living, to produce 
more energy, to create more jobs, and 
to create more opportunities for every 
American. That is how we bring our 
Nation together. That is what we ought 
to do now. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HEINRICH). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
f 
ABORTION 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, if 
you buy a new GM car, a Nissan, 
Honda, Kia or Toyota, even a Hyundai, 
you will notice they have started in-
stalling a new feature in their cars. It 
is a reminder, when you turn off the 
engine, to check your backseat. 
Quite frankly, I rented a car not long 
ago, and it started dinging, and I kept 
trying to figure out what I had done 
and kept looking around until I saw 
the little monitor on the dashboard. It 
just said, ‘‘Check the backseat,’’ which 
I thought was great because the mak-
ers of those cars all believe every child 
is precious and they shouldn’t be 
harmed. 
We have all heard stories like this, 
but I distinctly remember last summer 
seeing in the news a story about an in-
fant who died because they were left in 
a hot car. That is why these carmakers 
are making this feature now. 
I remember, as I saw the story on the 
news, just the reports and how angry 
people were in the community. And 
they were angry at the store, and they 
were upset on the news. They couldn’t 
believe that a mom had left a child in 
the backseat of a car and they had 
slowly died in the heat, because no one 
wants to see a child harmed. Everyone 
believes that every child is precious. 
I remember, when I saw the story on 
the news last summer, turning to my 
wife and saying: I can’t figure out our 
culture sometimes because that same 
mom and that same baby could have 
gone into an abortion clinic just a few 
months before and that child’s life 
could have been ended, and it wouldn’t 
have made the news. In fact, no one 
would have flinched. 
In fact, the very same people who 
were furious at that mom for leaving 
her child in the hot car to die would 
have argued for her right to destroy 
that exact same child—in fact, would 
have called it her reproductive right or 
even the new euphemism out there, 
‘‘reproductive care.’’ Same child, same 
mom—nothing was different but a few 
months in time. 
‘‘Reproductive care’’ seems like such 
a nice little euphemism, but what it 
really means is paying someone in a 
clinic to reach into the womb with a 
surgical instrument, to pull the arms 
and legs off of a child in the womb so 
that they will bleed to death in the 
womb and then suction out the little 
boy or girl’s body parts one at a time. 
That is what ‘‘reproductive care’’ 
means, and I don’t understand why 
that is normal but leaving a child in 
the backseat of a hot car is a tragedy. 
Maybe it is because, as a nation, 
some people are afraid to answer the 
most obvious question: Is that a baby? 
That is the most obvious question. 
That face, that nose, those two eyes, 
that mouth, that chin, those fingers—is 
that a baby? That is really the only 
question: Is that a child? 
Maybe there is a second question 
that needs to be answered: Are all chil-
dren valuable, or are only some chil-
dren valuable? 
We seem to have a great deal of de-
bate today in our society—and we 
should—about facts. People say we 
can’t seem to agree on the same set of 
facts and truth. You can’t have your 
facts and my facts; we just only have 
facts. The media, Big Tech, activists 
have all decried our loss of ability as a 
nation to just accept clear facts in 
front of our face—the obvious truth. 
So let me ask the question again: Is 
that a baby? Yes or no? Because if we 
are all supposed to say, ‘‘Let’s at least 
agree to the most basic of facts,’’ how 
about that one? Is that a human child 
with a future and a purpose and a 
name? Are all children valuable or are 
only some? 
Gold is valuable. It doesn’t matter its 
size. I have gold in my wedding ring. 
Many people have gold in their wedding 
rings. If we found a small piece of gold 
on the floor, it would be valuable. It 
wouldn’t matter its shape. It wouldn’t 
matter its size, small or large. We 
don’t discriminate. Gold is valuable be-
cause everyone universally recognizes 
its worth. Every single Senator in this 
room recognizes the worth and value of 
gold. It is around $1,800 an ounce right 
now to be able to get gold. We all seem, 
no matter how small or large, to agree 
gold is valuable, but we can’t seem to 
agree that all children are valuable. 
Literally, gold is more precious to 
some people in this room than children 
are. 
Children aren’t valuable only some-
times or only certain children. Chil-
dren are valuable. It can’t be just that 
if a mom or dad wants a child, they are 
valuable and, if they don’t want a 
child, they are not valuable; they are 
disposable. The mom or dad gets to 
choose who are precious and who is 
medical waste. 
Is that a child? That is really the 
only question that has to be answered, 
because everything else flows from 
that. 
There are political conversations in 
this room about the value of children, 
and every time it comes up, it gets 
noisy. People will say: Well, you don’t 
fund enough money for education or 
childcare or healthcare in commu-
nities. So you don’t love children. 
I would say I have voted for the exact 
same bill you did last year, for billions 
of dollars for assistance in childcare, 
billions of dollars for early childhood 
education, elementary and secondary 
education, higher education. We did ad-
ditional assistance for SNAP benefits 
last year and assistance of benefits for 
moms in need, increased healthcare for 
all communities, for federally qualified 
health centers to make sure we get 
healthcare to every single community. 
I voted on those exact same things 
multiple other people did in this room. 
I care about children outside the 
womb. 
But those questions really aren’t the 
question. They are distractions to the 
question. And I get it, because if I ask, 
‘‘Is that a child?’’ people will respond: 
Well, do you spend enough for childcare 
or healthcare? And I still say: Wait. 
Stop and answer my first question. Is 
that a child? 
Maybe I should ask a more basic 
question: Does everyone in this room 
believe in the principle that we should 
do unto others as we would want done 
unto us? What would you have wanted 
done to you when you were in the 
womb? 
I don’t address this issue lightly. 
This is a difficult issue for some peo-
ple. I don’t think an abortion is a flip-
pant thing, that anyone walks into an 
abortion—I don’t mean anyone who 
had an abortion is somehow gleeful 
about it. Quite frankly, I can’t imagine 
that anyone who had an abortion would 
ever forget the sights and sounds and 
the smells of an abortion, knowing 
that a helpless child is dying at that 
moment. 
I grieve for the moms and dads who 
will never ever forget that they went 
into a clinic and paid someone to get

rid of their child in the name of repro-
ductive care. I can’t imagine what 
their emotion is. But we as a society 
have to answer this question still for 
every child who has yet to come. 
Forty-eight years ago this week, the 
Supreme Court made a decision that 
has now resulted in the deaths of 62 
million children in America—62 mil-
lion. That is hard to fathom. Unlike so 
many other Supreme Court decisions, 
America has not forgotten about this 
one. Our culture has not just moved on 
and accepted it. 
Every year since 1974—the first year 
after the Roe V. Wade decision—indi-
viduals from across the country have 
gathered in Washington, DC, in defense 
of 
the 
unborn. 
Friends, 
families, 
church leaders, community folks—they 
have all marched in the rain, in the 
sleet, the snow. It is cold every year 
this week in January, but they come. 
This year will be different. Due to 
COVID–19 and the ongoing security 
concerns in Washington, DC, marchers 
are staying home, and they are engag-
ing virtually. Maybe this is one more 
moment where even more people can 
get involved online, because I expect 
the rally this year will draw an even 
larger 
number 
of 
people—students, 
families, people, quite frankly, from all 
over the world—to ask a simple ques-
tion: Will we recognize the most obvi-
ous thing in front of our face—that is a 
baby. 
President Biden this week celebrated 
the passage of Roe v. Wade by declar-
ing that he wants to pass a Federal law 
requiring abortion to be provided in 
every single State in America. It is not 
just trust a Court decision from 1973; 
he wants us to proactively require in 
statute that every State demand abor-
tion in their State and that Federal 
taxpayers, with hard-earned tax dol-
lars, should actually be required to pay 
for those abortions all over America. 
It wasn’t long ago that Senator Biden 
was 
saying 
things 
like, 
taxpayers 
shouldn’t be required to pay for abor-
tion; they shouldn’t be required to pay 
for something that they find so mor-
ally objectionable. It wasn’t that long 
ago that Senator Biden was talking 
about abortion being safe, legal, and 
rare. But now, as President, within the 
first week, he is moving as fast as he 
can to promote abortion and demand 
taxpayers pay for it. 
In 
fact, 
painfully 
so, 
President 
Biden’s nomination for the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services has ac-
tually no healthcare experience at all. 
It was a little surprising to a lot of us 
when we saw it because we are used to 
seeing the leader of Health and Human 
Services be a physician or scientist, 
which would make sense in the time of 
an enormous global pandemic to have a 
physician leading Health and Human 
Services. But he actually nominated 
someone whose biggest qualification is 
that he is one of the most radical advo-
cates for abortion in the country. He 
did it as a House Member. He did it as 
an attorney general in California. And 
clearly the promise was made that he 
will do it if you put him in Health and 
Human Services. 
Let me just give an example of what 
I am talking about for Mr. Becerra. I 
can’t process some of these things. Mr. 
Becerra, when he was the attorney gen-
eral for California, actually went to 
Mississippi to be able to lead a suit 
against Mississippi—another State, ob-
viously—because that State was talk-
ing about limiting abortion to only the 
earliest days. Their belief was, after a 
child feels pain, we should at least not 
tear a child limb from limb in the 
womb when their nervous system is de-
veloped. Mr. Becerra led a coalition of 
State attorneys general to fight Mis-
sissippi and say: You can’t protect chil-
dren that way. 
He actually argued before the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
against the Little Sisters of the Poor, 
trying to require that group of nuns to 
provide 
birth-control 
services—lit-
erally attacking the Little Sisters of 
the Poor to kind of push this whole 
agenda. 
When he was a Representative in the 
House of Representatives, he voted 
against the Born-Alive Abortion Sur-
vivors Protection Act. So if a child, in 
a botched abortion, is actually deliv-
ered instead of destroyed, he wanted to 
say, no, even after they are fully deliv-
ered, that child can still be destroyed, 
even though they are fully delivered, 
which would make sense because he 
also, 
as 
a 
Representative, 
fought 
against the partial-birth abortion ban. 
It was a rare procedure, but it was a 
procedure where they would deliver the 
child—all but the head—and then pene-
trate the head with scissors and kill 
the child. He fought against that. 
He fought against the Unborn Vic-
tims of Violence Act, which really is 
odd to me. All it did was criminalize— 
if someone attacked a pregnant woman 
and killed her child, they could also be 
liable for that death as well. He also 
didn’t want to recognize the child as a 
child even if the mother saw the child 
as a child. 
He also fought against crossing State 
lines for minors, saying they shouldn’t 
have to get their parents’ permission if 
they crossed State lines to go get an 
abortion somewhere else. 
As the attorney general in California, 
he fought to require churches to pay 
for abortion care in their healthcare 
plans when it directly violated their re-
ligious belief. 
Unbelievably so, he also fought to be 
able to require pro-life medical claims, 
where you could go and say: I don’t 
want an abortion, but I do want a 
sonogram. I want to be able to get 
some more information about this 
child. 
If you went into one of those pro-life 
centers and got a sonogram, he fought 
to require there to be a poster on the 
wall that would say: If you would rath-
er have an abortion, here is the place 
that you would go. 
This is beyond just protecting abor-
tion; that has moved to promoting 
abortion, encouraging the death of 
children. 
It got even so bizarre that in Cali-
fornia, when there was a video taken of 
a Planned Parenthood group of folks 
who were trafficking the body parts of 
children and it was caught on video, in-
stead of confronting the folks who were 
trafficking the child body parts, he 
went after the folks who took the 
video, the whistleblowers, and exposed 
them. 
This is not an attack on Mr. Becerra. 
It is just a shock to me that all of 
those things seem normal. I don’t un-
derstand that culturally. I don’t under-
stand how the person who is being ap-
pointed to lead Health and Human 
Services can say that children are sub-
human: I don’t have to recognize that 
as human, although I am leading 
Health and Human Services. That is 
apparently 
optional 
tissue, 
not 
a 
human child. 
I believe that children are human and 
that we should honor every child’s life. 
It should be baseline for us to be able 
to say that if a child is actually deliv-
ered in a botched abortion and has been 
fully delivered outside the womb, we 
should help that child get medical 
care. I don’t understand why that is so 
hard. 
I don’t understand why it is so hard 
to say that some people are actually 
appalled by the taking of a child’s life. 
Don’t force them, with their tax dol-
lars, to pay for it. I don’t understand 
why that is controversial. 
I don’t understand why it is con-
troversial that when a child can feel 
pain in the womb, we shouldn’t dis-
member a child in the womb. I don’t 
understand why that is controversial. 
I don’t understand why it is con-
troversial to some that if a healthcare 
provider who has sworn to protect 
life—that that person shouldn’t be 
compelled to take life in an abortion 
procedure by their employer. I don’t 
understand why that is controversial, 
but for some reason, it is. 
Among our most basic rights in 
America are life, liberty, and the pur-
suit of happiness. One of the most basic 
things that come out of our founding 
documents says these things are re-
ferred to as ‘‘self-evident.’’ 
Facts are facts, especially when 
those facts have a face. How can you 
look at that picture and say that is not 
a human child? How can we not ac-
knowledge the simple facts? 
I do understand for some people this 
is very difficult because they fought for 
years for abortion, and they don’t want 
that to change because if it changed, 
they would have to admit there have 
been the deaths of millions of children 
on their watch. That is not a simple 
thing to admit. But please do not tell 
me you are following the science, be-
cause that child has 10 fingers and 10 
toes and a beating heart and a func-
tioning nervous system. That child has 
DNA that is different from the mom’s 
or the dad’s. That is not random tissue; 
that is a separate person, and science

would confirm that. So please don’t fol-
low tell me you follow the science 
wherever it goes because some facts are 
obvious, and the science is clear. 
This all gets resolved when we an-
swer one simple question: Is that a 
child or not—because everything else 
goes from that. 
For those of you joining the March 
for Life online this week, good for you. 
Keep going. Don’t give up. Defend the 
facts that are self-evident. Speak out 
for those who can’t speak for them-
selves because millions of future Amer-
icans are counting on it, and they are

facts—the facts that have a face.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
f 
ABORTION 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I could 
never match the eloquence of the Sen-
ator from Oklahoma, who just spoke 
about the same topic about which I rise 
at this moment. 
I remember when Democrats running 
for office would tell the American peo-
ple that they were pro-choice, but they 
felt that abortion should be safe, it 
should be legal, but it should be rare— 
safe, legal, and rare. I remember when 
Bill Clinton said that to the American 
people. And I think about how far the 
left has gone from that to the attitude 
that my friend from Oklahoma has de-
scribed. 
I first encountered the March for Life 
when I was a staff member up here in 
Washington, DC, working for then-Con-
gressman Trent Lott, 1981. It was won-
derful to see those people, and it will 
be wonderful to join them online in a 
virtual march this Friday. 
I can tell you also that those people 
who say ‘‘We follow the science’’ are 
those of us now who are pro-life be-
cause, as the Senator from Oklahoma 
pointed out, as more and more infor-
mation comes out about DNA, about 
the pictures—about the pictures that 
my wife and I have had on our refrig-
erator of our unborn grandchildren— 
more and more Americans, more and 
more people around the world under-
stand that the science is on the side of 
those of us who are pro-life; that the 
beating hearts, the faces that we see in 
these young unborn children are, in-
deed, humans made in God’s image and 
that they are entitled to the protec-
tions that our Founders outlined, pro-
tecting life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness. 
Twenty-five years ago, 56 percent of 
Americans considered themselves pro- 
choice. Only 33 percent said they were 
pro-life. I was glad to be part of that 33 
percent, but I am certainly glad to see 
our numbers have risen. Today’s pro- 
life movement has closed that gap 
completely. The country is now evenly 
split. 
But I will say this for some of my fel-
low Americans who call themselves 
pro-choice: There are differences with-
in that group. 
Gallup reports 81 percent of Ameri-
cans think abortion should be illegal in 
the third trimester. Why can’t we get 
Democrats and Republicans and Inde-
pendents of the right and center and 
left to agree to that—where 81 percent 
of Americans said we should make 
abortion illegal in the third trimester. 
Sixty-five percent say it should be ille-
gal in the second trimester. 
In addition, a Marist poll last year 
found that 60 percent of Americans are 
against using taxpayer dollars to fund 
abortion. Even if some of them believe 
abortion should be legal, 60 percent of 
Americans—a 
supermajority—are 
against using tax dollars to fund abor-
tion. That is up from 54 percent just 1 
year before. 
Because the science is moving in our 
favor, the evidence is moving in our 
favor, public opinion is moving in our 
favor. That same poll found 35 percent 
of Democrats oppose using taxpayer 
funds for abortion. Many of these 
Americans might check the box saying 
they are pro-choice, but they are will-
ing to draw an important distinction 
between abortion being legal in some 
circumstances and taking taxpayer 
dollars from pro-life Americans to ac-
tually fund abortion. 
In essence, these people are saying: 
We can disagree about abortion being 
illegal, but let’s not force pro-life 
Americans to pay for a practice they 
find abhorrent and morally reprehen-
sible. 
That is a view that I do not agree 
with because I am solidly pro-life, but 
it is an eminently reasonable view. 
Why can’t we enact that into a per-
manent statute in the United States? 
It is a position that Congress has 
adopted every year when we pass the 
Hyde amendment to keep Federal dol-
lars from going toward abortion. 
I regret that our present President 
does not seem to share this view, al-
though he once held this view. Days 
ago, in one of his first acts in office, 
our new President reversed the Mexico 
City policy, allowing American tax dol-
lars to begin funding abortions in for-
eign countries once again. This deci-
sion showed disregard, to me, for the 
consciences of millions of American 
taxpayers who are pro-life. I was ap-
palled by this decision. I know many of 
my constituents were. I think Congress 
should pass legislation enshrining the 
Mexico City policy in statute. 
But at this moment, I rise proposing 
a more familiar and direct and, I think, 
politically popular step and that would 
be to put no taxpayer funding of abor-
tion legislation into the permanent 
statute rather than passing it each 
year as the Hyde amendment. Of all 
the abortion-related bills that reach 
the Senate floor, this one should be the 
least controversial. The Hyde amend-
ment is standard policy. It has passed 
annually for more than 40 consecutive 
years, during terms of Republican 
Presidents, terms of Democratic Presi-
dents, during Democratic majorities in 
the House and the Senate and when it 
was, indeed, the other way around. It 
has stood the test of time and enjoys 
broad consensus in this body and in the 
United States of America. Passing this 
legislation to make the Hyde Amend-
ment permanent would keep taxpayers 
from having to worry each year if their 
money is going to be used for an abor-
tion in this country. 
I stand this Friday with millions and 
millions of Americans who will join in 
supporting life, and I urge my col-
leagues to send an important signal to 
all of the American people that Con-
gress is serious about seeking unity 
and healing. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
supporting this legislation as we work 
to build bipartisan consensus for life in 
the days ahead. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO SCOTT MAGUIRE 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, when 
we have a new administration, lots of 
changes take place—changes in offices, 
changes in committee assignments— 
but for all of us here in the Senate, per-
haps the most challenging change is 
when members of our team decide to 
open new chapters in their lives. We 
celebrate those new chapters and wish 
them well, but we will also miss them 
greatly. 
I come to the floor to talk about 
three of my team members who are 
headed to a new chapter in each of 
their lives. 
Scott Maguire has been a central 
part of our team since day one. He is 
my good friend, a valued team member 
who is preparing a new chapter in his 
life in the form of a well-deserved re-
tirement. 
As of yesterday, January 26, he com-
pleted 12 years on our U.S. Senate 
team as our State operations director. 
The Boy Scouts of America that have a 
motto: ‘‘Be prepared.’’ They also have 
a slogan: ‘‘Do a good turn daily.’’ These 
are attributes that I always have held 
dear, and they are qualities I looked 
for when setting out to build a team to 
serve the people of Oregon when I was 
elected to the Senate in 2008. 
Scott was at the top of my list be-
cause I knew that these were qualities 
that define who he is. I knew this be-
cause I have known Scott for a very 
long time. We met through Boy Scout 
Troop 634 back when we were 11 or 12 
years old. We recognized and respected 
each other’s leadership skills, and I ad-
mired Scott’s growth in character and 
capabilities as he advanced to the rank 
of Eagle Scout. 
When we were 15, Scott and I were 
dissatisfied with how the district coun-
cil was running their annual First Aid 
Meets, so we proposed to the council 
executive that we take over and run 
the weekend event. To our surprise, the 
staff of the council agreed.

I think the resulting weekend event, 
which included dozens of troops, hun-
dreds of Scouts, was a tremendous suc-
cess. It was the type of mutual project 
that has bonded us over our lifetimes. 
Scott did many things in his career 
before joining my team. He served as 
operations director of the Northwest 
Christian Evangelistic Association; as 
executive director of the Oregon Lions 
Sight & Hearing Foundation; as a re-
porter and editor of the Gresham Out-
look. 
He got involved in many volunteer 
roles, including with the Gresham 
Breakfast Lions Club, the Gresham 
Early Risers Kiwanis Club, and he has 
volunteered millions of hours just so 
much to serve the Civil Air Patrol and 
is now a lieutenant colonel in the Civil 
Air Patrol. 
Looking back to 2009, I can’t imagine 
how we would have gotten our Oregon 
team off the ground or built the oper-
ation we have today without Scott 
Maguire. 
Over the years, he has kept the com-
puters computing and the supplies sup-
plied, but he has done so much more. 
He pioneered and built our Oregon in-
ternship program, which has been a 
pipeline for hundreds of Oregonians 
who have been going on to do great 
things serving in State and national 
government, in community organiza-
tions, and in business to make that in-
tern program the best possible. 
Scott cultivated strong relationships 
with Oregon’s colleges, and he could 
work with them. He was always on the 
search to give young Oregonians with a 
passion for public service the oppor-
tunity for public service. He cared 
deeply about their experience and suc-
cess throughout their time in our office 
but in the time beyond as well. 
Scott stepped in to serve as my field 
representative for a number of Oregon 
counties, 
organizing 
the 
townhalls 
they hold in those counties every year 
to hear from our constituents. He has 
not only helped to plan in organizing 
these events but saved them from 
going off the rails as unexpected chal-
lenges arose. 
Back in 2017, when we were debating 
the future of the Affordable Care Act, 
we knew that citizens were passionate 
and angry, so we anticipated a large 
turnout, planning for 1,000 attendees— 
twice what was ever seen before. And 
imagine our shock when 4,000 Orego-
nians showed up. Constituents were 
packed in like sardines. Hundreds 
crowded 
into 
a 
courtyard 
outside 
watching through the windows, but 
there was Scott swooping in to save 
the day. 
He reworked the sound system. He 
opened the windows. He figured out 
how to put speakers outside the win-
dows so everyone could hear and par-
ticipate. Crisis averted. That was just 
another day for Scott, working behind 
the scenes and taking care of things 
that most people don’t even know were 
going wrong to ensure things were run-
ning smoothly. 
Last year, before the pandemic shut 
down so much of our lives and our of-
fices went remote, we saw massive 
shortages on essentials like hand sani-
tizer, disinfecting wipes, and tissues. 
But Scott, seeing the crisis developing, 
raced around the metro area to gather 
supplies to keep the members of our 
team healthy and safe. That is who 
Scott Maguire is: the kind of person 
who goes above and beyond for every-
one in every situation; the kind of per-
son who is prepared and always goes 
out of his way to do a good turn daily 
for others; the kind of person who, re-
gardless of who you are, treats you like 
a VIP. 
I speak for all members of Team 
Merkley, for all the interns who have 
come through our office, for all the 
folks Scott has worked with over the 
years, when I say that he will be deeply 
missed, and it will not be the same 
without him. 
We 
wish 
our 
dear 
friend 
Scott 
Maguire and his wonderful wife Beth 
all the best as they begin a new chap-
ter of their lives together. 
I picture Scott, who has had a busi-
ness, Shorty’s BBQ, catering barbecue, 
Texas style, during his years in Or-
egon—you will probably see him firing 
that grill up a lot more often in the 
years ahead. It will be a chapter un-
doubtedly filled with loving friends, 
family, great traveling adventures, 
and, of course, as much barbecue as 
they can possibly handle. 
We will miss you, Scott Maguire. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO LAURA UPDEGROVE 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I have 
two other team members who are leav-
ing. 
Laura Updegrove is leaving us to 
work with the Biden administration. 
She came to us after serving in various 
foreign policy roles at the State De-
partment, the Department of Defense, 
and the White House. She joined our 
team 4 years ago to bring her extensive 
expertise to bear on our foreign policy 
portfolio, and I am sure glad she did. 
During her tenure in my office, I 
have been astonished, time and again, 
by the depth and breadth of her knowl-
edge, her work ethic, her strong orga-
nizational and management skills, and 
the way she approaches each and every 
task with a very positive attitude. 
Those traits make her not only a top- 
notch legislative staffer but a terrific 
partner as we work to address a variety 
of issues. 
On two occasions, we had the chance 
to travel on international issues—one 
trip to many different countries in Af-
rica to better understand the root 
causes and impacts of the four famines 
on that continent and to understand 
how American policy could be changed 
to assist in these desperately difficult 
situations. 
Then, some years ago, we had the 
genocide 
carried 
out 
against 
the 
Rohingya people in Burma. Aung San 
Suu Kyi came and spoke to the United 
Nations, and she said: We have nothing 
to hide. Come and see for yourselves. 
So Laura went to work in organizing 
the congressional response, the con-
gressional trip. We really thought we 
were going to see exactly what had 
gone on in those villages, and she 
worked incredibly hard to arrange ev-
erything from boats to helicopters to 
get us to the right places. Then, the 
day before we left, Burma denied us the 
ability to see those villages. 
We had backup plan after backup 
plan to explore what had happened 
both in Burma and the conditions at 
the refugee camps in Bangladesh. She 
reworked everything in a short period 
of time to direct attention by our con-
gressional delegation and through our 
delegation to the world to the trauma-
tized, difficult circumstances of a com-
munity that was the subject of geno-
cide by Burma. Again, the whole goal 
was to figure out how the United 
States could do more to help. Laura 
really understood and cared about and 
helped with the plight of people in 
some 
of 
the 
most 
difficult 
cir-
cumstances around the world. 
The same passion and dedication and 
strategic thinking that Laura dedi-
cated as a policy staffer are also what 
have made her an outstanding legisla-
tive director for the past 2 years. She 
has not only continued to lead our ef-
forts on critical issues from rules re-
form to social justice but has been a 
daily example of the power of team-
work and mentorship to other staffers. 
Her departure is a big loss for Team 
Merkley but a really big win for the 
Biden administration, particularly the 
State Department, where she will be 
able to utilize her enormous talents on 
behalf of our country and on behalf of 
our country’s building a better world. 
Laura, we wish you all the best. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO BEN WARD 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, our 
third team member who is leaving is 
Ben Ward. 
I think of Ben as our appropriations 
wizard. He knows that system inside 
out, and he is the master of Tribal 
issues and natural resources issues and 
so much more. He is heading off to 
serve as the Office of Management and 
Budget’s Deputy Director of Legisla-
tive Affairs. I think the whole world 
noticed his extraordinary talents, and 
we are looking forward to continuing 
to work with him as we strive to make 
the appropriations efforts as effective 
as possible. 
I think that virtually no one in Or-
egon has gone untouched by the work 
that Ben has done over the past 5 
years. He has worked to get piping 
money to Central Oregon to assist the 
farmers. The farmers not only get more 
water, but more water gets left in the 
Deschutes River. 
He has worked very hard to advance 
the improvement of Native fishing 
sites, treaty fishing sites, on the Co-
lumbia River and the preparations to

rebuild communities that were wiped 
out by the building of dams some 70 
years ago that have never been prop-
erly addressed. He has proceeded to 
help the Klamath Tribes secure the 
funds to improve the habitats for their 
sacred c’waam and koptu fish and to 
improve the whole, entire water eco-
system in the Klamath Basin for all of 
the stakeholders. 
When we had a big problem with sea 
lions that were blocking the fish lad-
ders and blocking the mouths of 
streams and tributaries, he concocted 
probably more than a dozen plans to 
try to find one that could move 
through this legislative process and ad-
dress the challenge, and he succeeded. 
He helped get funding so that we 
could have more people fighting fires 
on the frontlines, and he helped to get 
funding so we could thin the forests 
and treat the forests so that they 
would be less likely to burn in the first 
place. 
He helped us get money for the coast-
al ports so they could be drudged and 
so they would continue to operate ap-
propriately and safely for the economy 
of the coastal ports. 
He helped us make sure we got help 
for the diverse agricultural research 
stations in Oregon and for the mass 
timber project that is developing whole 
new categories of engineered wood 
products that can build buildings that 
are 14 stories high out of wood rather 
than concrete and steel, utilizing our 
incredible supply of amazing wood in 
the Pacific Northwest. He also assisted 
our universities in getting funding for 
all kinds of programs. 
The list is almost inexhaustible, but 
I think we all understand the point. He 
is incredibly talented at seeing oppor-
tunities and is incredibly persistent in 
seizing those opportunities. That is 
Ben’s way of getting things done. That 
is why he has been so valued, and that 
is why we will greatly miss him. 
Ben, we wish you all the best as you 
work on behalf of the Biden adminis-
tration and the larger OMB process in 
coordination with the U.S. Senate. 
To each of these team members, I say 
that, once you are a member of Team 
Merkley, you are never not a member. 
You will always be part of our family. 
We so much appreciate what you have 
contributed to the team and what you 
have contributed to building a better 
world.

CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am particularly glad to see the senior 
Senator from New Mexico presiding on 
what, for me, is a sentimental moment, 
because he has been such a terrific 
friend and colleague and advocate in 
the battle of climate change. 
I am here today because, at last, it is 
time to say farewell to my battered 
‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ image board here 
and to a run of more than 275 weekly 
climate speeches. It has been one of the 
Senate’s longer runs, I believe, but I 
think it is time to say farewell. 
This long run began in the dark days 
of 2012, after Speaker PELOSI
had 
passed a serious climate bill and the 
Senate had refused to take up any-
thing, not even a blank bill to go to 
conference with and see what could be 
done in conference. As some of us re-
member all too well, when Speaker 
PELOSI passed that bill in 2009 over on 
the House side, we had here in the Sen-
ate a filibuster-proof Democratic ma-
jority. This was climate change, and 
we just walked away. I was told then 
that it was because the Obama White 
House told Leader Reid to pull the 
plug, that after the ObamaCare wars, 
the White House was tired of conflict 
and didn’t want another big battle. It 
was not going to take on any fights it 
wasn’t sure it could win. 
Think about that. Think of history’s 
great battles and contests, legislative 
or otherwise, and consider in how 
many of those battles either side was 
sure it would win. If you limit yourself 
to battles you are sure you can win, 
you are pretty much sure to miss the 
most important battles, and we lost 
this one for that most lamentable of 
reasons—the failure to try. The fossil 
fuel industry, sure enough, knew it won 
this one once it saw the Obama admin-
istration walk off the field, abandoning 
Speaker PELOSI’s hard-fought victory. 
Then years went by in which you 
could scarcely get a Democratic ad-
ministration to put the words ‘‘cli-
mate’’ and ‘‘change’’ into the same 
paragraph in which we fussed, idioti-
cally, about whether to call it ‘‘climate 
change’’ or ‘‘global warming’’; in which 
the bully pulpit—the great Presidential 
megaphone in the hands of one of our 
most 
articulate 
Presidents—stood 
mute. We quavered about polling show-
ing climate as issue 8 or issue 10, ignor-
ing that we had a say in that outcome. 
When we wouldn’t even use the phrase, 
let alone make the case, no wonder the 
public didn’t see climate change as a 
priority. 
Those were, for me, dark, desolate 
days, so I made a commitment to speak 
about climate change every single 
week we were in session—no matter 
what. The kitchen was dark; the oven 
was cold, but maybe, somehow, one lit-
tle pilot light’s clicking on every week 
would help. 
Six years after the Waxman-Markey 
climate bill passed the House, the 
Obama EPA finalized its marquee cli-
mate regulation, which was quickly 
killed dead in the starting block by the 
five 
Republicans 
on 
the 
Supreme 
Court. 
The Clean Power Plan never even 
went into effect. It had no regulatory 
core or backstop that was indisputably 
within EPA’s authority. So when the 
Clean 
Power 
Plan’s 
novelties 
got 
smacked down, nothing was left. 
John Kerry, bless him, led us into the 
Paris Agreement, but it wasn’t signed 
until the last year of 8 years of that ad-
ministration. It being so late, the fossil 
fuel interests behind Trump hauled us 
right back out of it. 
So there we were, after 8 years in 
which Democrats sometimes controlled 
both Houses of Congress as well as the 
White House, and we had, at the end of 
the day, no law, no regulations, no 
treaty. 
I am hanging up the ‘‘Time to Wake 
Up’’ poster after more than 275 of these 
speeches because I am going to trust 
that we bring more spirit and deter-
mination to the climate crisis this 
time, as President Biden has promised 
that we will. 
His opening Executive orders are a 
fine start. I appreciate particularly the 
restoration of the social cost of carbon, 
but perhaps the most important signal 
is not any specific policy but the

breadth of the scope of the emphasis on 
climate across the new Biden adminis-
tration. 
Then we had to deal with the Trump 
years, when sins of omission became 
sins of commission, and questions of 
commitment became questions of cor-
ruption. 
I am personally confident that evi-
dence will reveal that the Trump ad-
ministration was, in fact, corrupt on 
climate issues—and not just corrupt in 
the meaning of the Founding Fathers 
but corrupt in the meaning of the U.S. 
Criminal Code, and I will do my level 
best to make sure we find out. Thank 
goodness, we can put that disgraceful 
period of our history behind us. 
What did I learn along the way? I 
traveled to many of my Republican col-
leagues’ home States on climate trips 
to help me understand the climate 
change problem there. There is no 
State whose big State universities 
deny climate change. Most all of them 
teach it. So I knew it wasn’t lack of 
knowledge that was blocking progress. 
I learned that oceans are at the heart 
of the climate threat. First, they bear 
incontrovertible testimony to the dan-
gers. Try arguing with thermometers 
that measure ocean warming. Try ar-
guing with tide gauges that measure 
sea level rise. Try arguing with pH 
tests that school children can do that 
measure 
the 
acidification 
of 
our 
oceans. 
I learned that the oceans are suf-
fering extraordinary injury from warm-
ing at the rate of multiple nuclear ex-
plosions per second and acidification at 
rates unprecedented in human exist-
ence, and from the fossil fuel industry’s 
plastics contaminating our oceans. 
In every State I went to, there were 
businesses alarmed by climate change, 
whether it was wildfire or flooding or 
the loss of iconic views and species, up-
heaval of fisheries and growing condi-
tions of crops or business risk and 
recreation imperiled. 
I heard from western fishermen about 
warming trout streams and a Glacier 
National Park with no glacier, and saw 
ancient western forests dying by the 
square mile to the bark beetle. 
I heard from coastal States about 
new pests and poisonous algae and 
flooding risks and fisheries in up-
heaval. And the Great Lakes, I heard, 
face similar threats as the ocean 
coasts. 
I heard in the Presiding Officer’s 
State of Nordic ski trails made mud be-
cause you can’t do artificial snow like 
on ski slopes, and moose tours—moose 
tours—that visitors promised never to 
do again because once you made it 
down the mud trail, the moose were 
crawling with thousands of ticks, eat-
ing them alive. Things that winter 
used to clean up but did no longer. 
One day I wept in National Airport, 
sitting at one of those little round lino-
leum-topped food tables, reading Pope 
Francis’s new encyclical, ‘‘Laudato Si: 
On Care For Our Common Home.’’ Cli-
mate effects were everywhere. That 
wasn’t the problem. 
So I began looking at the fossil fuel 
industry and studying the dark money 
apparatus that it uses to spread cli-
mate denial and to obstruct climate 
progress. 
I recalled our bipartisanship here in 
the Senate before Citizens United, and 
I saw the death of bipartisanship after, 
when the fossil fuel industry upgraded 
its weaponry from political muskets to 
tactical nukes and set about sub-
jugating the Republican Party. 
I came to like and admire Bob Inglis, 
a conservative the fossil fuel industry 
could not subjugate. So, instead, they 
made an example of him for his climate 
heresy and crushed him politically. 
I came with groups of Senators to the 
floor to identify and call out this cor-
rupt and corrupting fossil fuel web of 
denial. I came to know and admire the 
tough band of investigators, writers, 
and academic researchers who examine 
and document this corrupt apparatus. 
I saw how this apparatus insinuated 
itself into the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce and the National Association of 
Manufacturers and turned those two 
business groups into America’s two 
worst climate obstructors. 
Thank you, InfluenceMap, for that 
research. 
I learned the ways the industry hid 
the money trail leading to its front 
groups 
through 
shell 
corporations, 
through 
Donors 
Trust, 
through 
501(c)(4)s. And I finally came to the re-
alization that this industry was run-
ning a massive, covert operation—prob-
ably the biggest covert disinformation 
and political intimidation op in his-
tory, and it was running this covert op 
in and against our own country. 
Another thing I learned was how lit-
tle political effort America’s corpora-
tions put into doing anything about 
climate change here in Congress. A lot 
of them put happy green talk on their 
websites. They had their consumer re-
lations and public relations and inves-
tor relations people spread the happy 
green talk around. Many of them actu-
ally hired sustainability officers and, 
where it made them money, began 
changing their internal behavior to ac-
tually be more sustainable. 
Sometimes more attention was paid 
to heralding those sustainability pro-
grams than there actually was to sus-
taining anything, but sometimes it was 
sincere. Bravo to those companies that 
have really changed the way they oper-
ate within their corporate bounds. And 
a few took climate change seriously 
enough to start pushing sustainability 
out their supply chains. 
But 
none—none—took 
climate 
change seriously in Congress. This was 
a battlefield they avoided. Their trade 
associations were a nightmare. Every 
one 
of 
them—beverages, 
insurance, 
banking, chemical, agricultural—you 
name it, every one of them was silent 
or worse. Now at last—at last—that 
seems to be changing. 
Here is the 2020 lobbying pitch for 
Silicon Valley tech giants—the biggest 
corporations in America, many of the 
most successful corporations of Amer-
ica, hundreds of American corpora-
tions, almost all of which pride them-
selves on their greenness. They lobby 
us through a group called TechNet. 
Here is their pitch sheet—13 pages of 
bulleted priorities they wanted Con-
gress to achieve, and not one men-
tion—not 
one 
mention—of 
climate 
change. Not one, not even a mention of 
renewables from a trade association 
that has renewables companies in its 
membership—until now. Until now. I 
was just notified that TechNet has no-
ticed this omission in its document and 
that it intends to rectify the error. 
Good. 
Change has even come to the biggest 
and most obstructive lobby group of 
them all—the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce. I spent a lot of time chasing 
them 
with 
hashtag 
‘‘chamberofcarbon.’’ I stood out in 
front of their headquarters and put up 
a sign that said ‘‘Carbon’’ blocking 
where it said ‘‘Commerce,’’ so their 
own building said ‘‘U.S. Chamber of 
Carbon.’’ They were my nemesis—hos-
tile to climate action in the legislative 
branch, hostile to climate action in the 
executive branch and regulatory agen-
cies, hostile to climate action in the 
judiciary in cases that were being 
brought about climate. They were the 
beast. 
Well, last week, the chamber an-
nounced a dramatic reversal—that it 
will now support a serious, market- 
based climate solution. That—that—is 
a big shift. And if they fight for cli-
mate action anywhere near as force-
fully as they fought against it, it could 
make a big difference. So TBD as to 
how this turns out over at the cham-
ber, but a tentative big thumbs up. 
So as I close my run of Time to Wake 
Ups, where are we? Well, we again con-
trol the House, and the Senate, and the 
White House, and this time I hope we 
will be serious. 
Senator MARKEY has joined me, and I 
mentioned earlier in the speech NANCY 
PELOSI championing an actual serious 
climate bill through the House and la-
mented the Senate’s failure to do one 
damn thing once we had the House bill 
over here to act on. 
That bill was called Waxman-Mar-
key. It was the work of Congressman 
Waxman and Congressman, now-Sen-
ator, MARKEY. With Senator MARKEY 
over here, maybe this time we will be 
serious in the Senate with all of these 
departments of government control. 
The latent bipartisanship here in the 
Senate that the fossil fuel industry 
suppressed is still there. It has been 
there all along. Talking to some of my 
colleagues about climate change has 
been a little bit like talking to pris-
oners about escape, but the latent bi-
partisanship did not go away. With 
these other changes—with corporate 
America beginning to show up, with 
the big trade associations becoming 
less horrible, I am hopeful for a serious 
bipartisan bill. And if we can’t get 
good-faith 
bipartisanship, 
well, 
we 
have got reconciliation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S173 
January 27, 2021 
Senator MCCONNELL can’t block bi-
partisan climate bills from coming to 
the floor any longer. So there is a point 
to legislating. There is a point to advo-
cates showing up. So maybe corporate 
America will show up and push back on 
fossil fuel’s subjugation of the Repub-
lican Party. A good, hard look at the 
fossil fuel climate denial machinery 
can put that corrupt machine back on 
its heels. In my view, it would be dere-
liction and malpractice to ignore that 
apparatus and its treacherous role. 
In trade associations, revolts are al-
ready taking place, within the chamber 
and NAM, by members horrified to be 
outed as supporting America’s worst 
climate 
obstructors. 
Want 
faster 
change there? Disclose the fossil fuel 
money that bought the climate ob-
struction. That will speed things along. 
The finance and agriculture sectors 
and our coastal economies all are look-
ing down the barrel of multiple and se-
rious economic crash warnings. Banks, 
insurance 
companies, 
Freddie 
Mac, 
sovereign banks, wherever you look in 
the world of finance, there are dra-
matic, dire warnings from sober, seri-
ous bean-counter people who are not 
there to be green. They are there to 
make green. So corporate climate con-
cerns have moved from the commu-
nications shop to business operations 
and the C-suites. 
The famous author Mary Renault, 
who wrote wonderful historical novels, 
said: ‘‘There is only one kind of shock 
worse than the totally unexpected: the 
expected for which one has refused to 
prepare.’’ There has never been a crisis 
or a catastrophe more warned about by 
more and more credible sources than 
the looming climate crisis, and it is 
going to clobber these businesses. Now 
they just need to align their political 
effort with their own stated policies. 
How hard is that? 
All of this can break the right way. 
The dark castle of denial can fall, and 
Congress can rise in bipartisan force to 
stop the harm and cure the damage. 
But that is not foreordained. We can 
still screw this up. No doubt about it. 
So let’s not. Let’s do our duty. The 
conditions are at last—at last—in place 
for a real solution. A new dawn is 
breaking, and when it is dawn, there is 
no need for my little candle against the 
darkness. My little ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ 
pilot light can now go out. 
So instead of urging that it is time to 
wake up, I close this long run by say-
ing now, it is time to get to work. 
Whitehouse ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ run, 
farewell. 
Whitehouse at least on time to wake 
up—out. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. 
INHOFE. 
Before 
my 
friend 
leaves, I just want him to know that I 
relished the opportunity to be here for 
his, what, 400th or however long it has 
been—but his final speech. And I am 
excited about the final speech because 
I have got it pretty well memorized 
now. And while I have to say this—I 
say this about another person who has 
been on the committee with me for a 
long period of time—that while I don’t 
agree with very much of what you say, 
you say it so well. That goes with you, 
I say to the Senator from Massachu-
setts, because we cover a lot of issues 
in that committee. 
I think it was—we have a new major-
ity now. We will see some things that 
you will seize upon as opportunities 
that may make some changes. And I 
will be there to try to keep that from 
happening, but, nonetheless, we will 
enjoy it. There are so many issues 
right now in the committee, I say this 
to my friend from Massachusetts, that 
we are involved in. You know, one of 
them is an issue we discussed in some 
detail about the Western Sahara and 
some things that have gone on there. 
We find so many things that we can 
agree on. And I look forward to being 
in the new position of being in the mi-
nority and combating from a different 
perspective. 
So congratulations on the commit-
ment that you have made to your 
cause and the time and the effort and 
the eloquence that you have used over 
the years. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Sen-
ator INHOFE. I am grateful to the senior 
Senator from Oklahoma. 
We are, indeed, fairly fierce adver-
saries on the issue of climate, but it is 
a fervent prayer of mine that that 
might change because I have had the 
experience of working with Senator 
INHOFE on issues on which we are not 
adversaries, and let me tell you, the 
man is a senatorial Caterpillar tractor 
at getting things done when our inter-
ests align. Whether it is cleaning up 
kleptocracy or fixing the enforcement 
of pirate fishing overseas or our ocean 
plastics work, Senator INHOFE has been 
enormously valuable in those things. 
And I will confess, because we have had 
these wars with one another on climate 
change, that when Senator INHOFE 
came to Senator SULLIVAN’s and my 
hearing on ocean plastics, my heart 
sank. I thought, oh—I won’t say the 
word. This was such a good hearing. It 
was going so well. Why did he have to 
show up? Because I thought he was 
going to ruin everything—not a bit. He 
listened. And when it came time to ask 
questions, he asked terrific questions. 
He described an experience in his 
childhood along the Texas gulf coast 
and the little sea turtles trying to 
work their way to the ocean from their 
eggs, and he asked how he could help. 
He was an original cosponsor of our 
bill. He was a strong supporter of the 
bigger, better 2.0 bill. 
So I will close with reiterating my 
prayer that perhaps in the most mar-
velous of all worlds, the good Lord can 
find a way to bring us to work together 
to solve this climate problem. If so, we 
may very well have a miracle in this 
Chamber. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. 
INHOFE. 
Madam 
President, 
there are many other areas, I recall so 
many times, during a long period of 
time when Democrats were in the ma-
jority, Barbara Boxer was the chair-
man of our committee; and when Re-
publicans were in the majority, I would 
be the chairman and then she would be 
the ranking member. But I have to say 
this, in that committee, we got things 
done. 
You overlooked the infrastructure 
thing and how important that was. And 
I have a confession that is good for the 
soul. I have to admit, every time we 
had a new infrastructure bill, I started 
off on the Democratic side because 
they seemed to be more interested in 
some of the things that I was inter-
ested in. Anyway, that is the way it 
works around here, and we all love 
each other. All right? 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Sen-
ator INHOFE, for your courtesy for com-
ing to say those words. I truly appre-
ciate it. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, will 
the gentleman yield? 
Mr. INHOFE. I will yield, yes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Thank you for rising 
because I do believe what you are say-
ing about Senator WHITEHOUSE is accu-
rate. In my opinion, like Lou Gehrig, 
like Cal Ripken, he will go down in his-
tory in this longevity streak in high-
lighting, spotlighting like a true North 
Star the need for us to take action on 
these issues, and he is, without ques-
tion, a climate change hall of famer. 
And I agree with you, there is a new 
dawn which has now arrived, with our 
fingers crossed. And I share your hope, 
the Senator from Rhode Island, that we 
might be able to find a way to persuade 
the gentleman from Oklahoma that it 
is sunny most of the time in Oklahoma 
and it is windy most of the time in 
Oklahoma and there are tens of thou-
sands of jobs yet to be created. And we 
can work in partnership in order to ac-
complish that goal. 
But for today, I just wanted to come 
over and honor the great SHELDON 
WHITEHOUSE for his incredible leader-
ship during this time we have been 
going through with the climate ‘‘denier 
in chief’’ now gone, and there is hope 
alive. Your leadership is absolutely 
hall of fame and historic. Congratula-
tions, Senator WHITEHOUSE. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. You are the Hank 
Aaron. You are the Roger Maris. So I 
appreciate it and thank you. 
Mr. 
INHOFE. 
Don’t 
forget 
Cal 
Ripken, the Cal Ripken of climate. 
That is pretty good. 
Well, Madam President, that is not 
what I came to talk about. I came to 
listen. 
MARCH FOR LIFE 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, one 
of the best presentations I have heard 
in a long time was just a couple of 
hours ago by JAMES LANKFORD. What 
he was talking about, I have never 
heard a presentation more heartfelt

and compassionate than he did on the 
unborn, and I couldn’t touch that. But 
there are a couple of things I wanted to 
add that perhaps were not on his—he 
didn’t have time to get around to. 
It is really important that we recog-
nize celebrating this March for Life 
that is taking place. It is something 
that has happened each year for a long 
time now. I have always enjoyed being 
a part of it. We have large groups of 
people coming up from Oklahoma. 
However, it is virtual this year as ev-
erything else is. It is more important 
than ever under this new administra-
tion and its radical abortion practices 
and the personnel that have been sug-
gested to be part of the administration. 
So it is going to be maybe a greater 
fight than it has been in the past. 
In light of that, I am introducing a 
bill I have introduced before, but we 
have never been able to get it passed. It 
is called Protecting Individuals with 
Down Syndrome Act, which will pro-
hibit abortions being sought because 
the unborn baby has Down syndrome. 
All abortion is tragic, but this popu-
lation has been specifically targeted. 
In the United States—it just turned 
out this way, and there is no law that 
influences it—in the United States, ap-
proximately 67 percent of the unborn 
babies diagnosed with Down syndrome 
are aborted. All lives have inherent 
worth regardless of their chromosome 
count. I think we all understand that. 
But my fight does not stop there. I 
am also joining my colleagues in intro-
ducing several pro-life bills as we pre-
pare for March for Life, including Sen-
ator SASSE’s. He has a bill that is the 
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protec-
tion Act. His bill ensures that a baby 
who survives an abortion will receive 
the same treatment as any child natu-
rally born at the same age. 
People don’t realize this, but babies 
who have been in an attempted abor-
tion and they survive the abortion, 
they don’t get the medical treatment 
that they normally would get, which 
this bill directly addresses. This has 
been going on for a long time. I have a 
feeling that we have an opportunity. 
The numbers are changing in our direc-
tion in terms of the unborn and have 
been for some time. 
Now, my wife Kay and I have been 
married 60 years. We have 20 kids and 
grandkids, so I know something about 
babies. I know something about babies 
who are born. And I looked up and I 
saw—because of the great presentation 
that Senator LANKFORD
gave, I was 
looking for some material I had used in 
the past. 
It was 28 years ago that I came down 
here to tell the story about Ana Rosa 
Rodriguez. This is what I said. I was in 
the House at that time. This was in the 
House RECORD, and this is what I said 
at that time. I said: 
Mr. Chairman, there is a big misconception 
regarding abortion and the issue of women 
and their right to protect their bodies. It is 
not that right that I object to, but the right 
that is given them to kill an unborn fetus— 
an unborn [baby]. 
I want to share with you a story that my 
colleague, Chris Smith told some time ago 
on this very floor. Ana Rosa Rodriguez is an 
abortion survivor. At birth she was a healthy 
3 pound baby girl except for her injury—she 
was missing an arm. 
Ana survived a botched abortion. Her 
mother attempted to get an abortion in her 
32nd week of pregnancy when she was per-
fectly healthy—8 weeks past what New York 
State law legally allows. In the unsuccessful 
abortion attempt the baby’s right arm was 
ripped off [from her body], however they 
failed to kill Ana Rosa. She lived. 
And I got to know her after that. 
Pro-life supporters agreed that nightmare 
situations like the Rodriguez case are prob-
ably not [all that] common, but abortion re-
lated deaths and serious injuries occur more 
[often] than most people are aware. 
It is amazing that we can pay so much at-
tention to issues such as human rights 
abroad and can allow the violent destruction 
of over 26 million children here at home. We 
are fortunate that Ana was not one of those 
children—she survived. 
That was in 1992. I was in the House 
at that time. But today we still don’t 
have explicit Federal protections for 
babies who survive the brutal abortion 
process. 
Now, as I said, this issue is not about 
abortion but about caring for a baby 
outside the womb. These kids are— 
they failed an abortion, so they are 
alive. In most cases, they are in a hos-
pital setting—in many cases, anyway— 
and yet they don’t get the same care. 
They don’t look at them as someone 
you can save. You don’t want to use 
lifesaving talents on these babies. 
The need for these protections be-
come even clearer as we see States like 
New York and Illinois that allow abor-
tion for virtually any reason up to the 
point of birth and support infanticide 
by removing protectants for infants 
born alive after a failed abortion. 
Just a few years after that speech I 
gave in 1997, I was on the floor with my 
good 
friend 
former 
Senator 
Rick 
Santorum to try to pass a partial-birth 
abortion ban and end the horrific prac-
tice of late-term abortions. Fortu-
nately, we won the battle against par-
tial-birth abortions and finally ended 
that practice in 2003. That ban was 
upheld by the Supreme Court in 2007. 
But we have yet to pass legislation 
banning 
late-term 
abortions. 
Only 
seven countries allow abortion after 20 
weeks, including the United States and 
North Korea. Now, that is horrific. The 
United States is supposed to be an ex-
ample in regards to global human 
rights. Yet we are on par with North 
Korea when it comes to protecting the 
unborn. 
Senator GRAHAM’s Pain-Capable Un-
born Child Protection Act would help 
roll back this horrific practice by pro-
hibiting abortions after 20 weeks post- 
fertilization. That is when we know 
that babies can feel. It is not even de-
batable; they can feel pain at that 
time. 
It is another commonsense bill that 
should not divide us along party lines. 
A baby is a baby whether in or outside 
of the womb, and each baby deserves a 
chance to live as an individual created 
in the image of God. 
There is still much more we need to 
do to end the abortion-on-demand cul-
ture. Under the last administration, we 
protected the Hyde amendment, rein-
stated and expanded the Mexico City 
policy, and stripped abortion providers 
like Planned Parenthood from using 
title X funding for abortions. Unfortu-
nately, President Biden is trying to 
undo all those accomplishments that 
we made in the last administration. 
The need to stand up for our babies is 
as important today as it has ever 
been—certainly in 1992 and 1997 when I 
quoted from talks I made back at that 
time. We will overcome evil with good 
by upholding and affirming the dignity 
and inherent worth of every human 
being. We will just keep fighting, and 
we are going to win this one. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
DOMESTIC TERRORISM PREVENTION ACT 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, 76 
years ago today, scouts from the So-
viet Red Army pushed their way 
through Poland. They stumbled on a 
place that haunts the world to this 
day—a place of incomprehensible suf-
fering, cruelty, and depravity—Ausch-
witz-Birkenau. 
Auschwitz was the largest of Nazi 
Germany’s death camps—40 sprawling 
acres of hell on Earth. 
Between 1940 and 1945, 1.1 million 
men, women, and children were trans-
ported to Auschwitz from Nazi-occu-
pied lands; 1.1 million were murdered 
there. More than 950,000 of those were 
Jewish. 
At the height of the Nazi concentra-
tion and extermination camp’s oper-
ations, an average—average—of 6,000 
Jews were poisoned and cremated every 
day 
in 
the 
gas 
chambers 
and 
crematoria of Auschwitz. It was mass 
murder on an industrial scale. 
The first Soviet soldiers who entered 
Auschwitz on January 27, 1945, were 
met with an eerie stillness. Most of the 
camp’s 
prisoners—nearly 
60,000 
of 
them—had been evacuated days earlier 
by Nazis and dispersed to other con-
centration camps, where they contin-
ued to be exploited as slave labor. Only 
about 9,000 prisoners remained. They 
were the ones who were too sick to en-
dure the evacuation, simply left there 
to die—no food, no water, no heat, no 
medical care. 
In a frantic effort to conceal their 
monstrous crimes, the SS had tried to 
dismantle that killing machine before 
they abandoned it. They forced pris-
oners to dismantle the barracks and 
demolish the gas chambers and ovens, 
but the fires still burned in Auschwitz.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S175 
January 27, 2021 
Three weeks ago today, on January 6, 
2021, an angry mob attacked this Cap-
itol Building and this Congress as we 
gathered to fulfill our constitutional 
obligation to certify the results of the 
2020 Presidential election. That siege 
on the Capitol was an attack on Amer-
ican democracy itself. Sadly, it was in-
cited by then-President Donald Trump. 
So many scenes from that day still 
haunt us: police officers trying to 
maintain order, battered with Amer-
ican flags, threatened to be murdered 
with their own service weapons; a scaf-
fold erected on the Capitol grounds; 
calls to hang the Vice President of the 
United States; a Confederate battle 
flag paraded through the halls of the 
Senate—a desecration that never hap-
pened during our Civil War. But for 
many, the most painful image of that 
day was of a middle-aged White man 
proudly wearing the sweatshirt that 
read: ‘‘Camp Auschwitz,’’ and then the 
words: ‘‘Work makes you free’’—a 
translation of the cruel slogan atop the 
black iron gates leading into the 
Auschwitz concentration camp. 
For one retired dentist and grand-
father in the Chicago area, that des-
picable neo-Nazi hate symbol, shown 
during the Capitol insurrection, and 
the chants of ‘‘Jews will not replace 
us’’ 3 years earlier in Charlottesville 
were shocking reminders. George Brent 
is 91 years old now, but he was 15 years 
old and living in Hungary when his par-
ents and his little brother saw a Nazi 
invasion on March 19, 1944. 
Two months after that invasion, on 
May 19, 1944, Hungarian townspeople 
sympathetic to the Nazis woke George 
and his family in the early morning 
hours and told them they had 2 hours 
to get out of their home. The family 
was taken to the Jewish ghetto. The 
following morning, they and the rest of 
the town’s Jews were loaded onto open 
cattle cars. After 6 days traveling on 
the railroad, the doors of the cattle 
cars were opened to reveal dogs and 
whips and SS officers barking com-
mands. 
George and his father were ordered to 
walk in one direction. Out of the cor-
ner of his eye, he saw his mom and his 
little brother Peter being herded in the 
opposite direction. He never saw them 
again. They almost certainly died that 
day in Auschwitz. 
George and his father were spared 
immediate death because they hap-
pened to be strong enough to work. 
George’s father was sent to clean up 
destruction and carnage in the Warsaw 
Ghetto. George was given different jobs 
at Auschwitz. He remembers the smoke 
that billowed from the crematoria. 
In mid-January 1945, as the Allies 
pushed into Poland, George and 56,000 
other prisoners were evacuated from 
Auschwitz. The emaciated men and 
boys were forced to walk hours in the 
freezing cold and snow, clad only in 
rags and wooden clogs. They called it 
‘‘The March of Death.’’ A fourth of the 
prisoners died along the way. 
The survivors were loaded into box 
cars and shipped west. George was sent 
to Mauthausen, a notoriously brutal 
camp in Upper Austria. A few days 
later, he was sent to Ebensee, a sat-
ellite camp. 
The official policy of both camps was 
‘‘extermination through labor.’’ It was 
a cruel mockery of the sign that greet-
ed the prisoners as they entered Ausch-
witz: ‘‘Work makes you free.’’ 
At Ebensee, George was put to work 
digging tunnels in which the Nazis 
could hide their war armaments from 
Allied bombing. 
On May 6, 1945—111⁄2 months after 
George was ripped from his home and 
family, Ebensee was finally liberated 
by George Patton’s 80th Infantry Divi-
sion—the last of the Nazi camps to be 
liberated. George was then 16 years of 
age. He weighed less than 70 pounds. 
After the war, George stayed briefly 
with two of his aunts in Budapest. To-
gether, they discovered their father 
was still alive but desperately ill in a 
tuberculosis sanatorium in Munich. 
Several months later, George was able 
to visit him. He settled into a displaced 
camp for Jewish children near Munich. 
In October 1949, he moved to America 
to live with his great-uncle, who owned 
a small grocery store on the South 
Side of Chicago. George slept on a re-
cliner chair in the storeroom. He was 
even happy to be there. He had reached 
the age of 20. 
In May of 1950—7 months after arriv-
ing in the United States—he enlisted in 
the U.S. Air Force Reserve and served 
2 years during the Korean war. In 1951, 
George’s father moved to Chicago, and 
they were reunited for nearly 20 years 
before his father passed away. 
After the war, George married and 
raised a family. He graduated from the 
University of Illinois College of Den-
tistry in Chicago. He later taught den-
tistry at the college for 29 years and 
practiced dentistry for 50 years. 
After he retired in 2010, he became a 
volunteer lecturer at the Illinois Holo-
caust Museum, where he tells his story 
mostly to kids. 
George Brent is a proud American. 
He is not really political. But when he 
saw the clothing and the symbols at 
the Capitol siege glorifying the mur-
derous Nazi regime, he was outraged. 
How could this happen in America, he 
asked? 
One effort that I believe is needed—in 
fact, it is long overdue—is for Congress 
to pass legislation aimed at addressing 
the significant threat of domestic ter-
rorism—domestic, homegrown Amer-
ican terrorism. That is why I have in-
troduced the Domestic Terrorism Pre-
vention Act in each Congress since 
2017. I will be reintroducing it soon in 
this Congress. 
For far too long, we have failed to 
adequately 
monitor 
the 
dangerous 
groups that threaten us, the violent 
White supremacists and other extrem-
ist groups. While we looked the other 
way, the threat grew. 
Intelligence experts have now warned 
us that such groups constitute a seri-
ous and growing threat to America’s 
security. Unfortunately, instead of ad-
dressing this threat, the Trump admin-
istration spent 4 years downplaying it, 
and the former President made appall-
ing, 
incendiary, 
and 
embarrassing 
statements that only served to further 
incite these violent extremists. We 
can’t waste another moment. Congress 
has to act against this hateful extre-
mism. 
As the incoming chair of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, I am going to 
hold hearings on this matter. 
I brought it up to the head of the FBI 
before. He acknowledged the problem, 
but little or nothing was done during 
the Trump years. I trust that President 
Biden will take a different approach. 
This is a serious threat to security in 
America. 
I feel badly for George Brent, a man 
who miraculously survived Auschwitz, 
the concentration camps, and every-
thing the Nazis threw at him. He came 
to the United States because he dearly 
loved this country and the freedoms 
that are part of it. He made a great life 
and a great contribution. He still does 
with his work at the Holocaust mu-
seum. Can you imagine what went 
through his mind when he saw that 
photograph of the demonstrator in the 
Capitol—the United States Capitol— 
with a sweatshirt mocking his life ex-
perience, a sweatshirt which bore the 
words ‘‘Camp Auschwitz’’? 
It was a sad day for America when 
that group, that mob, overran this Cap-
itol. I am sorry for the pain that it 
brought to so many people. 
But let me add quickly: We cannot 
ignore it. It is not a question of getting 
over it. It is not a question of letting 
President Trump ride off into the sun-
set. We have got to come to grips with 
the reality of what occurred 3 weeks 
ago today—3 weeks ago today—when 
we ran out of this Chamber, and we 
were told to move as quickly as pos-
sible with the fear that this mob was 
going to overtake us and harm us. 
After we left the building, they 
overran 
this 
Chamber. 
They 
went 
through the desks. They posed in the 
chairs where the Presiding Officer is 
sitting, took videos and photos of 
themselves and were just dumb enough 
to put them on Facebook. So we have 
them, and many of these people are 
going to pay the price for this criminal 
invasion of the Capitol that they were 
part of. 
Again, to George Brent’s family: I am 
sorry for what you had to go through. 
We are better than that. America is 
better than that. We are glad that you 
are a part of this great country. 
I will work to pass this bill and to 
get President Biden to sign it into law. 
And as I do, I will remember George 
Brent. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, the 
William M. (Mac) Thornberry National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2021 became public law on Janu-
ary 1, 2021, and included reforms to the 
U.S. Agency for Global Media outlined 
in section 1299Q. The FY21 consolidated 
appropriations act became public law 
on December 27, 2020, and included lan-
guage that would have delayed those 
reforms had they already been in law, 
but they were not. Reserving any con-
cerns about the lawfulness of insu-
lating Senate-confirmed officers from 
removal, I believe it is Congress’s in-
tent that these two provisions should 
not be understood concurrently and 
that the reforms outlined in section 
1299Q shall take effect on the date of 
enactment of the fiscal year 2021 
NDAA.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. PADILLA, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. 
MERKLEY, Mrs. MURRAY, Ms. 
CANTWELL, Mr. MENENDEZ, Mr. 
BOOKER, Mr. MARKEY, and Mr. 
SANDERS): 
S. 58. A bill to amend the Outer Con-
tinental Shelf Lands Act to perma-
nently prohibit the conduct of offshore 
drilling on the outer Continental Shelf 
off the coast of California, Oregon, and 
Washington; to the Committee on En-
ergy and Natural Resources. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to reintroduce the ‘‘West 
Coast Ocean Protection Act.’’ 
This important legislation would pro-
hibit oil or gas drilling in federal 
waters off the coast of California, Or-
egon, and Washington. 
After four years of an Administration 
intent on allowing drilling off the West 
Coast and in waters across the United 
States, I am hopeful we will finally 
pass this bill to ensure no drilling ever 
occurs in Pacific waters. 
I’m pleased to be joined today by 
Senators PADILLA, WYDEN, MERKLEY, 
MURRAY, CANTWELL, MENENDEZ, BOOK-
ER, MARKEY, and SANDERS
in intro-
ducing this bill, which has been intro-
duced in every Congress since the 
Deepwater Horizon disaster in April 
2010. 
11 people were killed and 17 others in-
jured when the Deepwater Horizon well 
blew out. Oil and gas spewed into the 
Gulf of Mexico for 87 days. 
Oil slicks covered the Gulf. Tar balls 
and toxic sludge covered beaches and 
wetlands. More than one-third of fed-
eral waters in the Gulf were closed to 
fishing. 
While the Deepwater Horizon disaster 
reminded the world of the dangers of 
offshore drilling, Californians never 
had to be convinced; before Deepwater 
Horizon and Exxon Valdez, there was 
the tragic 1969 oil spill in Santa Bar-
bara. 
A well blowout on an offshore rig 
spilled more than 3 million gallons of 
crude oil according to some esti-
mates—the worst spill in U.S. history 
at the time. 
The spill closed local beaches—which 
were covered by a thick layer of oil— 
and thousands of marine mammals and 
birds were killed. 
Tourists were turned away and com-
mercial fishing operations were halted, 
hurting the local economy. 
After the Santa Barbara spill, Cali-
fornia had enough. The State blocked 
all new offshore drilling in state 
waters—which extend three miles from 
the shore—and in 1994 enacted a perma-
nent offshore drilling ban. 
Through local ordinances, congres-
sional 
opposition, 
and 
presidential 
moratoria, all new drilling in federal 
waters off California has been blocked 
since 1984. 
Today, opposition to offshore drilling 
is higher than ever. A 2018 poll found 
that nearly 70% of Californians oppose 
new drilling off our coast. The evidence 
is quite clear: Californians do not want 
any more drilling. 
The California coast is an economic 
engine of growth for the state and the 
nation. A 2015 report produced by the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration found that California’s 19 
coastal counties created $662 billion in 
wages and $1.7 trillion in GDP in 2012. 
Overall, California’s ocean economy 
supports over 1 million jobs and gen-
erates significant growth for the U.S. 
Because of the unique nature of the 
West Coast ocean shelf, potential drill-
ing would occur near the coastline and 
directly threaten the environment and 
robust economy. 
It is long past time to respect the 
view of California and our fellow West 
Coast states by passing the ‘‘West 
Coast Ocean Protection Act’’ to perma-
nently ban offshore drilling and protect 
the Pacific coast for generations to 
come. 
I yield the floor.

SANDERS, 
Mr. 
REED,

CARDIN, Mr. MERKLEY, and Mr.

Whereas the novel coronavirus, hereafter 
referred to as COVID–19, emerged in the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China and began to spread 
as early as November 2019; 
Whereas, by late December, dozens of citi-
zens of the People’s Republic of China had 
fallen victim to COVID–19; 
Whereas, on December 30, 2019, Wuhan 
health authorities identified, interrogated, 
and reprimanded multiple doctors in re-
sponse to their decisions to warn other Chi-
nese citizens of the danger posed by this new 
disease; 
Whereas, on January 1, 2020, the Wuhan 
Public Security Bureau questioned eight 
Chinese doctors who had posted information 
on COVID–19 on WeChat; 
Whereas, on January 1, 2020, the Hubei Pro-
vincial Health Commission ordered labora-
tories to stop testing for COVID–19 and de-
stroy samples of the same; 
Whereas, on January 2, 2020, the Wuhan In-
stitute of Virology mapped the genome of 
COVID–19 in order to inform development of 
public health interventions and medical 
treatments for COVID–19, but the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China with-
held genetic information on COVID–19 until 
January 9; 
Whereas, on January 11, 2020, the Wuhan 
Health Commission insisted that there were 
no new cases of infection by COVID–19; 
Whereas, on January 13, 2020, the first 
identified COVID–19 case outside of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China was announced in 
Thailand; 
Whereas, on January 14, 2020, the World 
Health Organization announced that the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China had seen ‘‘no clear evidence of human- 
to-human 
transmission 
of 
the 
novel 
coronavirus’’; 
Whereas, on January 23, 2020, the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China began 
to implement quarantine measures to stem 
the spread of COVID–19, at the same time as 
the disease had already begun to proliferate 
throughout the world; 
Whereas, on March 11, 2020, the World 
Health Organization declared COVID–19 a 
global pandemic, with at least 118,000 persons 
infected and at least 4,291 dead in 114 dif-
ferent countries at the time of the announce-
ment; 
Whereas, by January 21, 2021, one year 
after the first COVID–19 case was confirmed 
in the United States, COVID–19 had infected 
at least 97,061,592 persons and killed at least 
2,080,009 in 191 different countries; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China argues that COVID–19 did 
not originate in the People’s Republic of 
China; 
Whereas the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
the People’s Republic of China has alleged 
that the United States Army may have de-
livered COVID–19 to the city of Wuhan and 
that COVID–19 may have originated in Italy 
or ‘‘separate outbreaks in multiple places in 
the world’’; 
Whereas the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of 
the People’s Republic of China has said, 
‘‘China’s endeavor to combating [sic] the epi-
demic has bought time for [international] 
preparedness.’’; 
Whereas a University of Southampton 
study found that earlier intervention by the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China could have ‘‘significantly’’ limited the 
geographic spread of COVID–19; 
Whereas more than 120 nations have called 
for an investigation of the origins of COVID– 
19; and 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China continues to prevent a 
credible international investigation of the 
origins of COVID–19, including by restricting 
access by investigators to certain locations 
and information in the People’s Republic of 
China: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the decision by the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China to 
hide the emergence and spread of COVID–19 
within its borders during the initial weeks of 
the pandemic; 
(2) assesses that the decision by the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China to 
hide the emergence and spread of COVID–19 
during that period almost certainly contrib-
uted to the rapid spread of that disease 
throughout the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the 
rest of the world; 
(3) finds that the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China should be held ac-
countable for the impact of its decision to 
hide the emergence and spread of COVID–19 
on the lives and livelihoods of the people of 
the United States and other nations; 
(4) calls for an international investigation 
led by public health officials from the United 
States and other affected nations and free 
from any restrictions by the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China to determine 
how the handling by the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China of the COVID–19 
outbreak prior to March 11, 2020, contributed 
to the emergence of the COVID–19 global 
pandemic; and 
(5) calls on the international community— 
(A) to quantify the harm caused by the 
handling of the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China to the health and eco-
nomic well-being of the people of the United 
States and other nations; and 
(B) to design a mechanism for delivering 
compensation from the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China to all affected na-
tions for the harm caused by its decision to 
hide the emergence and spread of COVID–19 
during the initial weeks of the pandemic.
