Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, JULY 20, 2022 
No. 120 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to the 
order of the House of January 10, 2022, 
the Chair will now recognize Members 
from lists submitted by the majority 
and minority leaders for morning-hour 
debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m.

DEMOCRATS TRUST WOMEN 
The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GAR-
CIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in support of House 
Democrats and their efforts to protect 
women and their reproductive rights. 
In 2020, more than 930,000 women had 
an 
abortion 
nationwide, 
exercising 
their fundamental human right. These 
are women who made one of the most 
intimate and personal decisions for 
their family and their futures. 
However, with the decision to over-
turn Roe, the Republican-controlled 
Supreme Court has achieved the dark 
and extreme goal of stripping away a 
woman’s right to choose. In doing so, 
they erased nearly five decades of 
progress. For the first time in Amer-
ica’s history, our daughters have less 
freedom than their mothers. This is 
plain and simply shameful. 
To make matters worse, now MAGA 
Republicans are determined to take it 
a step further and strip women of their 
right to contraception. I repeat: Ex-
treme rightwing Republicans want to 
strip women of their right to birth con-
trol. 
House Democrats won’t stand for 
this. We are fighting for you. We trust 
you. We always have, and we always 
will. 
Today, we will act. We will continue 
to fight. Tomorrow, we will pass the 
Right to Contraception Act to protect 
women’s access to birth control. 
We are doing this to protect the more 
than 60 percent of U.S. women of repro-
ductive age who use contraception. 
This bill will guarantee the right to ob-
tain and use oral contraception, emer-
gency contraception, and IUDs because 
no one—and I mean no one—should 
have the right to take away a woman’s 
right to choose their own healthcare. 
While Republicans seek to control a 
woman’s body for their political base, 
Democrats remain the party that puts 
people 
over 
politics 
and 
protects 
women and their reproductive rights. 
It is simple. Democrats trust women. 
We trust women to make their own 
healthcare decisions without any ques-
tions. 
To everyone listening, you have my 
promise that I will never stop fighting 
for 
women 
and 
their 
reproductive 
rights. I trust you, and I will never 
stop fighting. 
f 
BIDEN’S INFLATION CATASTROPHE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BONAMICI). The Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
FOXX) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, you 
don’t need to be an economics guru to 
understand that President Biden’s in-
flation catastrophe continues to knee-
cap our country. 
But if you ask the President, the 
White House press secretary, or anyone 
in the administration, for that matter, 
they would tell you that the United 
States is ‘‘stronger economically’’ than 
ever. 
How dense does one have to be to 
claim that, unless this administration 
is trying to cover up its ultimate end 
goal of turning the United States into 
Venezuela by taking on so much debt 
that we implode? That doesn’t seem 
farfetched in the slightest. 
Madam Speaker, inflation is the 
pickpocket that Americans run into 
every day, from the gas pump to the 
grocery store, and it is only growing 
worse. 
Since the administration and the 
President haven’t figured this out yet, 
let me put this in terms that they un-
derstand: 9.1 percent. End of quote. Re-
peat the line. 9.1 percent. 9.1 percent. 
A WOMAN’S HEALTH DECISIONS END WHEN THE 
LIFE OF AN UNBORN BECOMES INVOLVED 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, our col-
leagues keep talking about the issue of 
women’s health and women’s reproduc-
tive freedom. 
In ‘‘The Merchant of Venice,’’ Shy-
lock thought he had won a great vic-
tory when he thought he was going to 
get his pound of flesh. But Portia, the 
attorney, said to the judge: You may 
have your pound of flesh but not one 
drop of blood. I think that is a good 
analogy for what our colleagues are 
saying. 
No one is opposed to women pro-
tecting their health. But those of us in 
the pro-life movement are concerned 
about when that woman’s health deci-
sion destroys an unborn life. So, a 
woman’s health decisions end when the 
life of an unborn becomes involved.

CONGRATULATING IRENE TOVAR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CA´ RDENAS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor and congratulate a 
tremendous community leader, a friend 
of mine, and a friend of the community 
of Los Angeles and beyond, Irene

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6886 
July 20, 2022 
as CSUN, for her decades of public serv-
ice as an advocate for education in the 
San Fernando Valley, throughout the 
State of California, and across the 
country. 
I think of a quote from Saint Francis 
of Assisi: ‘‘Start by doing what is nec-
essary; and then do what is possible; 
and suddenly you are doing the impos-
sible.’’ That is Irene Tovar. 
Irene’s story begins like many of 
ours: in search of the American Dream. 
Her 
mother 
is 
from 
Salamanca, 
Guanajuato, Mexico, and her father is 
from Jerez, Zacatecas, Mexico. Her 
parents met in southern California, 
where later they married. They first 
settled in East Los Angeles, where 
Irene, her sister, and her brother were 
born, and then they moved to Pacoima 
and lived on Pinney Street. 
Irene was a dedicated student and at-
tended Pacoima Elementary School, 
San Fernando High School, and San 
Fernando Valley State College, which 
is now known as Cal State University 
Northridge. 
While attending CSUN, Irene, who 
earned a bachelor’s degree in social 
science from the university in 1969, no-
ticed that the dropout rate for Latino 
students was disproportionately high, 
so she helped create an organization to 
address the issue. 
It grew into the Latin American 
Civic Association, known as LACA, 
which administered the first Head 
Start program in the San Fernando 
Valley. This organization helps thou-
sands of working families access qual-
ity childcare and education. 
Alongside leaders such as Dr. Rudy 
Acuna, Irene began to advocate and or-
ganize for the creation of the Equal Op-
portunity Program and the Chicano 
Studies Department at California State 
University Northridge. 
The Chicano Studies Department was 
established in 1969 with only 100 stu-
dents. Now, it is one of the largest Chi-
cano studies departments in the coun-
try. 
Her advocacy caught the attention of 
then-Governor Jerry Brown, who, dur-
ing his first tenure, appointed Irene to 
the State Personnel Board. She was the 
first Mexican American and first per-
son of color to sit on the board. 
She 
was 
instrumental 
in 
imple-
menting policies and procedures that 
removed artificial barriers in the Cali-
fornia civil service system, including 
differential pay and affirmative action. 
She also served as a full-time member 
of the California Public Employment 
Relations Board, a quasi-judicial body 
she joined in 1974. 
Irene’s passion for education and 
public service continues. She currently 
serves as the CEO of LACA, which now 
focuses on providing multifamily serv-
ices and affordable housing. 
Irene has played a key role in the 
history of the San Fernando Valley as 
a founding member of the L.A. Mission 
College, board member of the United 
Way, board member of the L.A. Urban 
Coalition, board member of the CSUN 
Alumni Association, and many other 
organizations. 
She currently serves as a commis-
sioner on the City of Los Angeles 
Human Relations Commission, whose 
mission 
is 
to 
promote 
intergroup 
peace-building, 
equity, 
and 
human 
rights. 
Irene, your service is unparalleled, 
and this doctorate is a symbol of your 
sacrifice and hard work for the families 
of the San Fernando Valley, the great 
State of California, and our country. 
Congratulations, Irene, and I am 
proud to call you Dr. Irene Tovar. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF RODRIGO GARCIA 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of a trail-
blazer who made a difference across 
this country. 
Rodrigo ‘‘Rod’’ Garcia, founder of the 
Society of Hispanic Professional Engi-
neers, otherwise known as SHPE, was a 
man of deep conviction and passion. 
Not only did he commit to his work as 
an engineer, but he opened a door for 
so many, including myself, to follow in 
his footsteps. 
As one of the only handful of His-
panic engineers during the 1973 tech 
boom, he could easily have gone on to 
a promising career in the sciences. But 
when he saw a wrong, he set out to 
right that wrong. 
In gathering a cohort of fellow His-
panic engineers, he was determined to 
diversify the STEM industry across our 
country, and that is when SHPE was 
born. 
While Rod Garcia was an incredible 
man, his legacy in SHPE is equally in-
credible. Now, the organization has 
grown into the largest Hispanic STEM 
association 
nationwide, 
with 
13,000 
members and 286 chapters across the 
country. 
An engineer to his core, Mr. Garcı´a 
attributed the success of SHPE as 
such: ‘‘We were engineers. We drew up 
the plan. . . . To see it take off the way 
it has, it is really special.’’ And special 
it is. 
SHPE’s impact is only growing. In 
the 2021–2022 academic year, SHPE 
awarded scholarships to over 200 stu-
dents across the country, distributing 
over $1.3 million. 
Rod has passed on, and he will be 
sorely missed, but his reputation and 
his memory will live on forever.

CONGRATULATING THE AMHERST 
ALL STAR DARLINGS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
an 
incredible 
achievement in youth sports. The Am-
herst All Star Darlings, a girls’ youth 
softball team of 7- and 8-year-olds, just 
finished their season undefeated. 
After winning both the district and 
State championships, they have set 
their eyes on Cochran-Bleckley, Geor-
gia, where the girls’ softball world se-
ries will be played later this month. 
These young ladies worked hard and 
enjoyed the competition, and their de-
termination to win throughout the 
length of their season has been un-
matched. 
Now, they are planning and working 
toward making their trip to Georgia 
possible to get the chance to make this 
Cinderella story a reality. 
Their efforts are a story of camara-
derie, hard work, and laying the foun-
dation for a bright future not only in 
sports but in all of their future endeav-
ors. 
Amherst has been a special part of 
the Sixth District for decades, and it 
has been an honor to represent the peo-
ple of Amherst, first in Richmond and 
now in Washington. The Sixth District, 
along with the entire Commonwealth 
of Virginia, will be cheering them on 
when they compete on July 31 in the 
Dixie youth softball league world se-
ries. 
Congratulations to the Amherst All 
Star Darlings for representing friends 
and family, the Amherst community, 
and the entire Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia so well.

CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT A 
PARTISAN ISSUE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. DEUTCH) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, over 6 
years ago, our former colleague Carlos 
Curbelo and I launched the Climate So-
lutions Caucus to have a bipartisan ef-
fort to address climate change. We did 
it because where we live in south Flor-
ida, climate change is not a partisan 
issue. 
Republican and Democratic leaders 
alike, Republican and Democratic busi-
ness leaders and elected officials, all 
understand that sunny-day flooding, 
and sea-level rise brought by climate 
change are happening right now, and 
we need to respond to it. 
b 1015 
So we launched action here to try to 
responsibly address climate change, 
just as so many are in South Florida 
and around the country. The 7 years 
that we have just endured are the 7 
hottest years on record. In 2021, the 
U.S. endured over 20 weather disasters, 
costing a billion dollars or more. Hurri-
canes, and floods, and wildfires, all of 
them made worst by climate change. 
Last year, there were at least 688 
people who died in the United States 
attributed to climate change: $150 bil-
lion in damage. 
And so where are we now? 
Well, our country and our world are 
reeling from the devastating impact of 
climate change. For the first time ever, 
temperatures in the U.K. exceeded 104 
degrees; Ireland hit record highs of 
over 90 degrees; Portugal 117. More 
than 1,100 people in Spain and Portugal 
died in this heat wave. 
Wildfires are scorching Europe. More 
than 100 million people in the U.S. have

been under a heat alert. A mega 
drought is gripping our West and 
Southwest, drying up critical sources 
of fresh water and addressing our de-
mands for electrical power. And a deep 
drought has much of North Africa on 
the edge of famine. 
This has happened in one week. Yet, 
these heat waves will become more fre-
quent and intense for decades to come. 
We will continue to see the intense 
heat waves that have been scorching 
Europe and the U.S. put immense pres-
sure on our infrastructure and con-
tinue to put lives at risk. 
Madam Speaker, we need innovators 
and entrepreneurs in climate tech. We 
need young people to stand up and de-
mand a world that will be safe for 
them. We need the Biden administra-
tion, and we need this Congress. 
My colleagues, we need to be bold. It 
is not about comfort. It is not about 
staying cool. For people across the 
globe right now, at this moment, it is 
and continues to be about survival. It 
is time for us to act on climate change. 
The future of our planet depends on us.

RECOGNIZING JON DEWITTE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to say thank you. Thank 
you to a chief of staff, a colleague, a 
confidante, and a special friend. 
Jon DeWitte has been my chief of 
staff for 111⁄2 years. In fact, when I was 
elected in 2010, Jon was the first call 
that I made. He was my first hire, and 
we have been on this journey together 
the entire time. 
Now, Jon has had a great track 
record here in Washington, D.C., as 
well. He worked for the Education and 
Workforce Committee. He then went on 
to work with former Congressman 
Dave Camp. Then when I left the posi-
tion of district director from my prede-
cessor, Peter Hoekstra, Jon came and 
filled that role and filled that position 
for 8 years until I got elected, when I 
asked him to come back to Washington 
and act as my chief of staff. 
Well, Jon—two redistrictings, major-
ity, minority, government shutdown, 
impeachments, war, peace—we have 
seen just about all of it and have lived 
that textbook of political science. I 
couldn’t have done it without him, and 
I know he could not have done this 
without his family. 
I want to say a special thank you, as 
well, to Jodi, Nathan, Katie, and Josh 
for the sacrifices that they made—the 
sacrifices that they have made—for 
late nights and early mornings, for 
travel, for all the different things that 
go into being an excellent chief of 
staff. He has been one. 
Now, I know that there are great 
paths ahead for Jon, and great paths 
ahead for all of you, but I do know that 
our friendship will not end. Team 
Huizenga is always Team Huizenga, 
and Jon is a vital part of that. 
So once again, I thank Jon for his 
service, not only to me, but more im-
portantly, to the constituents of the 
Second Congressional District back in 
Michigan and service to his country. 
A job well done and I thank him. 
f 
HOUSING MARKET NEEDS HELP 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Mrs. TORRES) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to express con-
cern about the building material sup-
ply change bottlenecks and elevated 
construction costs that continue to put 
a damper on the single-family housing 
market. 
For the first time since June 2020, 
both single-family starts and permits 
fell below a 1 million annual pace. Ad-
ditionally, builder confidence in the 
market for newly built single-family 
homes declined for the seventh straight 
month in July, falling 12 points to 55. 
According to the National Associa-
tion of Homebuilders and the Wells 
Fargo Housing Market Index released 
just this week, this marks the lowest 
HMI reading since May 2020 and the 
largest single-month drop in the his-
tory of the HMI, except during the pan-
demic. 
Building material prices during the 
pandemic have hit record highs with 
low stock, and prospective buyers are 
faced with unaffordable home prices as 
a result. Affordable housing is a crit-
ical need in the Inland Empire, the dis-
trict that I represent, and I urge the 
administration to prioritize the ability 
and the availability and price of lum-
ber to make more homes affordable. 
f 
IN SUPPORT OF NAVY 
LIEUTENANT RIDGE ALKONIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
American Samoa (Mrs. RADEWAGEN) for 
5 minutes. 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of U.S. Navy 
Lieutenant Ridge Alkonis, a sailor cur-
rently 
stationed 
abroad 
in 
Japan. 
While the U.S. and Japanese naval 
forces have long maintained a strong 
bond, the relationship is deteriorating 
as a result of Japanese injustices 
against U.S. military members. 
The case of U.S. Navy Lieutenant 
Ridge Alkonis, who is of American Sa-
moan descent, exemplifies the dis-
parate treatment American sailors re-
ceive in Japan. 
While driving his wife and three chil-
dren to get ice cream during a family 
outing, Lieutenant Alkonis suffered a 
sudden and unforeseen medical emer-
gency which resulted in a tragic car ac-
cident causing the death of two Japa-
nese citizens. While indeed a tragedy, 
this was an accident in every sense of 
the word. 
At the scene of the accident, Lieuten-
ant Alkonis was immediately arrested 
by Japanese authorities, without re-
ceiving any medical care, and impris-
oned. He was systematically deprived 
of sleep, denied legal counsel, and pres-
sured to sign false accusations. 
The Tokyo High Court rejected the 
majority of evidence submitted by 
Lieutenant Alkonis, and last week, his 
appeal was dismissed. 
I am deeply troubled by Japan’s mis-
treatment 
of 
Lieutenant 
Alkonis. 
These abuses are hurting the U.S.- 
Japan alliance exactly when it needs to 
be strengthened. 
I call on President Biden and Ambas-
sador Rahm Emanuel to bring Lieuten-
ant Alkonis home. 
f 
DEFENDING WOMEN’S 
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, 
the United States Supreme Court deci-
sion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health 
Organization to uphold the Mississippi 
Gestational Age Act and overrule the 
Court’s prior decision in Roe v. Wade 
and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern 
Pennsylvania v. Casey, declaring that 
the constitutional right to abortion 
upheld for nearly half a century no 
longer exists, ripped away women’s 
right to make their own reproductive 
healthcare decisions. 
Nationwide, radical Republicans were 
prepared to immediately charge ahead 
with measures to take away the free-
dom of choice. In Congress, Repub-
licans are plotting a nationwide ban to 
criminalize abortion, and State legisla-
tures are advancing the extremist 
agenda 
to 
criminalize 
reproductive 
health decisions, including new laws to 
arrest doctors and punish women and 
those who provide aid. Far-right politi-
cians are actively working to dis-
mantle the legal protections afforded 
to women and invading their bodily au-
tonomy rights. 
For centuries, women have fought te-
naciously for their fundamental human 
rights and we will not stop. On July 18, 
1848, 174 years and 2 days ago, the first 
women’s 
rights 
convention 
in 
the 
United States was held in Seneca Falls, 
New York. The Seneca Falls Conven-
tion in 1848 was the first platform for 
women to discuss their civil, social, 
and religious rights and challenge their 
inferior status. Feminist leaders and 
women 
across 
the 
country 
coura-
geously voiced their collective strug-
gles and petitioned for change. 
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, an ardent 
activist 
and 
leader, 
presented 
the 
‘‘Declaration of Sentiments,’’ demand-
ing the same rights and freedoms that 
the Declaration of Independence grant-
ed to men at that time. The Seneca 
Falls Convention was a cornerstone of 
the women’s suffragette movement and 
paved the path for women’s rights 
movements.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6888 
July 20, 2022 
Today, women’s freedoms are under 
attack, and the consequences will re-
verberate as radical Republicans con-
tinue to push their political agenda 
and curtail basic rights. My Demo-
cratic colleagues and I remain unwav-
ering in our commitment to defend the 
legal rights of women and families to 
make 
independent 
decisions 
about 
their futures by safeguarding access to 
reproductive healthcare services. 
This week, House Democrats will 
vote to pass H.R. 8373, the Right to 
Contraception Act, guaranteeing the 
right to obtain and use contraception 
as established in Griswold v. Con-
necticut. 
The alarming, extremist act of judi-
cial activism in Dobbs v. Jackson has 
created a dangerous blueprint for fu-
ture attacks on our most cherished 
rights. As an attorney who is a strict 
constructionist myself, this cannot 
stand. In his concurring opinion over-
turning Roe v. Wade, Supreme Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that in 
future cases the Court should consider 
substantive 
due 
process 
precedents 
which legalized the right for married 
couples to buy and use contraception 
without 
government 
restrictions, 
same-sex relationships, and marriage 
equality. Calling into question the con-
stitutional right to use contraception 
is dangerous for American women and 
families, as well as men, but also has 
the potential to disproportionately im-
pact 
women 
of 
historically 
marginalized communities who face 
health disparities at higher rates. 
Access to contraception can affect all 
aspects of a woman’s life, including 
educational attainment, employment 
opportunities, 
healthcare, 
and 
eco-
nomic success. The Right to Contracep-
tion Act recognizes the social, polit-
ical, and economic impacts on our 
country and takes steps to protect 
Americans’ right to make their own de-
cisions about their health and their 
families. 
The Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs 
further emphasizes the need to act 
now, to protect access to contracep-
tion, and women’s right to make repro-
ductive health decisions. Contracep-
tion is essential to the health and 
rights of individuals. Women deserve 
the right to make informed decisions 
about their health, family planning, 
and future. It is 2022. We should not 
still be fighting for rights that are es-
sential to basic health and bodily au-
tonomy. Pass this legislation.

b 1030 
NATIONAL PENNSYLVANIA DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize 
today, July 20, as National Pennsyl-
vania Day. 
Since the inception of our Nation, 
Pennsylvania 
has 
played 
a 
trans-
formative role in United States his-
tory. Pennsylvania’s nickname, the 
Keystone State, represents the central 
role we played in shaping our Nation. 
Pennsylvania was the site of many 
important battles and military mile-
stones, like the Battle of Valley Forge 
in the Revolutionary War and the Bat-
tle of Gettysburg during the Civil War. 
Pennsylvania is the home to a lot of 
firsts, including our Nation’s first cap-
ital, Philadelphia; the first American 
flag sewn by Betsy Ross; and the first 
commercial oil well in my district, giv-
ing birth to the modern petroleum in-
dustry. 
Pennsylvania has a proud history of 
American 
craftsmanship 
and 
work 
ethic, from our steel mills and coal 
mines to our farmland and forests. 
Madam Speaker, as a lifelong resi-
dent of Pennsylvania, I am encouraged 
each and every day by the industrious 
spirit of our residents as we continue 
to build a bright path forward for our 
Commonwealth and our country. 
Happy Pennsylvania Day. I am proud 
to be from the great Keystone State. 
LATE-TERM ABORTION SHOULD BE ILLEGAL 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, Democrats are ad-
vancing an agenda of abortion on de-
mand. Last week, House Democrats 
passed their radical abortion on de-
mand until birth act, falsely named as 
the Women’s Health Protection Act, 
and the Ensuring Access to Abortion 
Act. 
Both bills go much further than codi-
fying Roe v. Wade and would legalize 
abortion for all 9 months of pregnancy 
across the country, while undermining 
the health and safety of women. In ad-
vancing this legislation that would 
continue the murder of innocent un-
born, Speaker PELOSI
has confirmed 
Democrats’ radical agenda by saying 
abortion is ‘‘ . . . core to who we are. It 
is about freedom.’’ 
Madam Speaker, 80 percent of Ameri-
cans believe that late-term abortion 
should be illegal. 
IMPACT OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT ON OUR MILITARY SERVICEMEMBERS 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, last week, in a bipar-
tisan way, this body stood up and 
served those who serve in uniform, 
those who sacrificed for this great Na-
tion in the United States Armed 
Forces. 
I was proud, on Thursday, to join the 
majority of folks in this Chamber in 
passing H.R. 7900, the National Defense 
Authorization Act. I was proud to sup-
port this legislation, and I contributed 
significant legislative language, too. 
The bill extends a prohibition pre-
venting 
dishonorable 
discharge 
for 
servicemembers refusing COVID vac-
cines, while also extending a prohibi-
tion on COVID vaccine mandates for 
Department of Defense contractors. 
The NDAA authorizes annual funding 
for the Department of Defense and de-
fense-related programs at other Fed-
eral agencies. The NDAA authorized 
earned pay raises for our American 
troops. Included in the NDAA was my 
legislation from H.R. 7144, the Military 
Housing Transparency and Account-
ability Act, that directs the Secretary 
of Defense to develop a centralized 
military housing feedback tool for 
members of the United States Armed 
Forces and their families. This will 
allow these families to identify, rate, 
and compare housing options. Our mili-
tary families have earned the right to 
safe housing conditions. 
Additionally, it included provisions 
requiring the Department of Defense to 
report the dollar amount spent on for-
eign fuel that is used; report on the im-
pact on low recruitment and retention, 
and the impact on servicemembers’ 
mental health as a result of that; and 
finally, to report the impact of infla-
tion, which is impacting every Amer-
ican family today. 
This report specifically is asking the 
question: What is the impact of infla-
tion—which is out of control, a record 
high—on our military families?

ABORTION STORY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Mrs. LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 
destructive decision overturning Roe v. 
Wade, women across this country have 
shared their stories. From Facebook to 
the dinner table to streets in protest, 
women have shared the details of the 
deeply personal and often difficult mo-
ments in which they exercised their 
right to choose. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to share 
the story of a constituent of mine 
named Misty. 
His name was Miles. I knew some-
thing was wrong at 12 to 16 weeks. At 
20 weeks, it was too late. I spent a ter-
rible night in the ER hemorrhaging. 
Miles survived that incident and there 
was still a heartbeat. The next day was 
traumatic at an ultrasound. 
I had lost so much fluid and Miles 
was being smashed. They said that he 
wasn’t getting the blood he needed to 
his kidneys and other places. They lit-
erally sent me home to wait for him to 
die. There was still a heartbeat at 20 
weeks, but I was informed that Miles 
could not live to full term and that I 
would have to deliver conventionally if 
I had made it to 24 weeks. 
The news continued to get worse, and 
I waited. That was the longest week of 
my life. I waited through fear, depres-
sion, anxiety, and immense sadness. At 
the end of that week, I decided, with 
my fetal medicine specialist, to termi-
nate the pregnancy. It was one of the 
toughest decisions I have ever faced. 
The trauma that I would have experi-
enced by delivering a dead baby, Miles, 
would have been more than I could 
handle. Going to the doctor every other 
day and seeing him dying was enough 
to make me realize this. 
Misty closes by saying: We are not 
careless, immoral, or monsters.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6889 
July 20, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I stand with Misty, 
and I stand with her right to make her 
decision. The trauma and pain that 
women like Misty face in these mo-
ments should be met with care, com-
passion, and the right to privacy. 
But instead, my colleagues on the 
right would rather inflict more trauma 
during what can be an extremely chal-
lenging moment in a woman’s life: 
forcing them to cross State lines to ac-
cess abortion; forcing them to give 
birth when it threatens their health, 
their mental health, and their financial 
well-being; forcing them to defend mis-
carriages in front of a court of law; 
forcing young girls to carry a preg-
nancy to term that is the result of a 
sexual assault or rape. 
We cannot become complicit in the 
destructiveness of these extreme poli-
cies. Behind each pro-life policy are the 
very real and very personal stories of 
women whose lives will be forever 
turned upside down. I thank Misty for 
her story, but she shouldn’t have to 
share it. 
For 50 years, the law of the land re-
spected individual choice and privacy. 
In Nevada, our law still reflects that 
today, but tomorrow may look dif-
ferent. 
National Republicans stand ready to 
ban and restrict abortion nationwide, 
even in States like Nevada where the 
right to choose is protected by law. 
Just last week, on this very same 
House floor, they lined up in droves to 
talk about it. 
The reality of a nationwide abortion 
ban is far more likely than you may 
think. I am not going to stand by and 
watch, and that is why I was so proud 
to vote for the Women’s Health Protec-
tion Act, and, equally, to vote in the 
next few days on the Right to Contra-
ception Act. 
Madam Speaker, I will continue to do 
everything in my power to protect 
your right to choose. 
f 
SOCIALIST SPENDING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, on many 
different occasions I have come to this 
Chamber to point out exactly how we 
arrived at this moment where we are 
experiencing record-breaking inflation. 
Each time, congressional Democrats’ 
desire to recklessly spend trillions of 
taxpayer dollars continues to be the 
answer. 
Here I am again, as the House pre-
pares to vote on yet another spending 
bill costing hundreds of billions of dol-
lars filled with socialist wish list items 
that increases Federal spending by 
double-digit and triple-digit percentage 
increases in some cases. 
I, of course, will vote ‘‘no,’’ not only 
because it increases the size of our gov-
ernment by increasing spending on 
non-defense programs by 14 percent, 
but because it also fails to include the 
Hyde amendment, which is a long-
standing bipartisan agreement that 
protects taxpayer dollars for being 
used to fund abortions. 
Overall, the bill would increase the 
budget for the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency by 20 percent, increase the 
budget for general government activi-
ties by 17 percent, and include a 10 per-
cent increase for the Food and Drug 
Administration—the very same depart-
ment that botched the baby formula 
shortage. 
This funding bill rewards bad behav-
ior by giving funding increases to de-
partments that have failed the Amer-
ican people. It encourages illegal immi-
gration. It discourages increasing our 
domestic energy output by restricting 
offshore oil and gas activities, and it 
fails to fund our national defense prior-
ities like the sea-launched nuclear 
cruise missile. 
It has been almost 2 years of com-
plete Democratic control of govern-
ment. Instead of addressing the root 
causes of the crisis Democrats created, 
this bill doubles down on their failed 
socialist agenda. Tennesseans are fed 
up with the out-of-control spending 
here in Washington. Americans all 
across the country are fed up with it, 
too. 
f 
NATIONAL HEROES DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember the dev-
astating events of July 20, 2012, in Au-
rora, Colorado. 
I represented Aurora, Colorado, on 
this day 10 years ago when in an Au-
rora theater 12 lives were taken and 70 
were wounded, and an entire commu-
nity was scarred and traumatized. 
Today marks a very painful day for 
our community, and my heart aches 
with those who lost a loved one that 
day and will forever carry a hole in 
their heart. 
Yet, in this tragedy we saw incred-
ible heroism—those who carried the 
wounded to safety and the first re-
sponders and medical teams whose tire-
less efforts saved lives. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to rec-
ognize the 12 who lost their lives that 
night: 
AJ Boik, 18; 
Jesse Childress, 29; 
Gordon Cowden, 51, whose two teen-
age children were in the theater when 
he was killed; 
Jessica Ghawi, 24; 
Micayla Medek, 23; 
Veronica Moser-Sullivan, 6, whose 
mother was shot in the chest and mis-
carried a week after the attack; 
Rebecca Wingo, 32; and 
Alex Sullivan, who was celebrating 
his 27th birthday and was one week 
away from his first wedding anniver-
sary. 
This also includes the four men who 
died that night while saving others: 
Jonathan Blunk, 26; 
John Larimer, 27; 
Matt McQuinn, 27; and 
Alex Teves, 24. 
In the face of unspeakable violence 
and tragedy, these men proved to be 
everyday heroes, sacrificing their own 
lives to save others. 
Gun violence rips through our com-
munity, leaves trauma with families 
and friends of victims, the medical 
staff and first responders, and the en-
tire community for a lifetime. It is a 
trauma and a scar too many commu-
nities in Colorado and too many com-
munities 
across 
the 
country 
have 
faced. 
As our country grapples with inci-
dents of violence, chaos, and tragedy, 
it is the courageous acts and selfless 
spirit of the helpers and heroes among 
us that we remember. 
During our darkest days, there are 
always everyday heroes who answer 
the call to save lives and help their 
community. They provide light and 
hope for the future. The same heroic 
acts we saw in Aurora, Colorado, 10 
years ago have been reflected in other 
tragedies as gun violence continues in 
our communities, including in the re-
cent tragedies in Highland Park, Illi-
nois; Uvalde, Texas; and Buffalo, New 
York. 
Heroes can come in many different 
forms. During the COVID–19 pandemic, 
we saw heroes in medical professionals, 
frontline workers and essential per-
sonnel, such as truck drivers, letter 
carriers, food and grocery workers, 
teachers, small business owners, and 
researchers. 
That is why I am, once again, intro-
ducing a resolution, alongside my 
friend 
and 
colleague 
Congressman 
JASON CROW, to designate today, July 
20, as National Heroes Day. 
As Mr. Rogers famously said: ‘‘You 
will always find people who are help-
ing.’’ 
In the midst of our dark days, let’s 
focus on lifting up and recognizing the 
helpers and the heroes whose actions, 
big and small, make a difference in the 
lives of friends, coworkers, neighbors, 
and the larger community.

TELLING OUR STORY ON THE 
RIGHT TO CONTRACEPTION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. BROWN) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, since the Supreme Court overturned 
Roe v. Wade last month, I have been 
overwhelmed 
with 
powerful 
testi-
monies from my colleagues, family, 
and friends about their reproductive 
health journeys. 
They have shared their fears and con-
cerns 
for 
their 
daughters, 
grand-
daughters, and nieces now living in a 
post-Roe America. They offered first-
hand, intimate accounts detailing some 
of their personal and sometimes pain-
ful experiences, wanting me to know

how critical it is for Congress to make 
Roe the law of the land. 
These 
moving, 
shared 
memories 
spoke of very private life situations, 
from sexual assault to personal family 
planning decisions. Yet, they still told 
me in hopes of uniting in our fight 
against attacks by far-right extrem-
ists, extremists who are determined to 
strip women of their reproductive 
rights and criminalize abortion care in 
all 50 States. 
To these women, I say thank you. 
Thank you for your bravery, your hon-
esty, and your courage. Your stories 
were not told in vain and will serve as 
inspiration to continue our fight to 
protect, defend, and restore the right 
to decide. 
Madam Speaker, a woman’s funda-
mental healthcare decisions are hers 
alone to make and should never be 
mandated by politicians. 
This week, I stand proudly with my 
fellow House Democrats to reaffirm my 
support, and I will vote for the Right 
to Contraception Act. 
Reproductive healthcare should be 
available to everyone regardless of 
where they live. This week, we are an-
other step closer to restoring critical 
access for all.

PRESERVING THE ALABAMA 
BLACK BELT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Alabama (Ms. SEWELL) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the passage of H.R. 
3222, the Alabama Black Belt National 
Heritage Act, which passed this House 
by a vote of 365–57. 
As a daughter of Alabama’s historic 
Black Belt, I am proud to be the lead 
sponsor of this legislation to ensure 
that this region’s meaningful history is 
preserved for generations to come. As 
the birthplace of the civil rights and 
voting rights movements, the Black 
Belt represents the tireless efforts of 
the foot soldiers to end discrimination 
against African Americans and the 
continued struggle for full racial equal-
ity in our Nation. 
This new designation will not only 
bring about national attention to the 
rich history and culture of Alabama’s 
Black Belt, but it will also increase 
tourism, investment, and economic op-
portunity for many of the rural com-
munities that I so proudly represent. 
I thank Senator SHELBY for leading 
this bipartisan legislation in the Sen-
ate, and I also thank the University of 
West Alabama and the National Parks 
Conservation Association for their tire-
less work to promote this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the Senate to 
pass H.R. 3222 as soon as possible.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Almighty God, unto whom all hearts 
are open, all desires are known, and no 
secrets are hidden, we lay before You 
the concerns of our hearts for peace in 
this world and the desires we have that 
Ukraine would be liberated from the 
oppression they now endure. 
Nothing in all of creation is con-
cealed from Your sight. We ask, then, 
that You expose tyranny and reveal its 
true motive of power and self-pro-
motion. 
Uncover the traitors to freedom and 
the enemies of sovereignty and convict 
them of their deceit. Unmask those 
who scheme for their own interest at 
the expense of their own country and 
have them answer for their trans-
gressions. 
May all who fail to contribute to the 
common good, all those who thwart the 
ideals of freedom and democracy in 
Ukraine, be laid bare before You and 
may Your judgment be swift. 
Call us all to account for our deeds— 
things done and left undone, the overt 
and the contrived, the noble and the 
malicious. And align our lives, our Na-
tions, and our world to Your perfect 
will for Your creation. 
In Your omnipotence be merciful to 
us. In Your holy name we pray. 
Amen.

IN RECOGNITION OF PHYLLIS J. 
EDWARDS 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
want to celebrate the exceptional lead-
ership and commitment to service by 
Phyllis J. Edwards, who I warmly refer 
to as Director Edwards. She has dedi-
cated her work to protect and advocate 
for the underrepresented communities 
within Michigan’s 13th District Strong, 
specifically our senior citizens in De-
troit. 
Director Edwards was the executive 
director of Bridging Communities in 
southwest Detroit for over a decade, 
and prior to that, she was the social 
service program manager for more 
than 30 years within the Wayne County 
Department of Health and Human 
Services. 
Her work and proactive community 
involvement has made an immeas-
urable impact on the lives of countless 
residents. As a longtime Detroit resi-
dent, her efforts to improve the quality 
of life for our seniors demonstrated her 
love, commitment, and compassion for 
community-based work. 
Please join me in recognizing her 
many outstanding contributions to 
Michigan’s 13th District Strong as we 
wish her well on the next chapter of 
her life.

GOVERNMENT OVERREACH ON 
FARMERS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, with all 
the issues people are dealing with, the 
inflation, the high cost of everything, 
now we have the Securities and Ex-
change Commission’s incredulous new 
proposed rule requiring small, pri-
vately run family farms to produce 
huge volumes of climate-related infor-
mation to be able to then sell their 
products to public companies, which is 
going to be nearly impossible for small 
farms. Inflation being driven by SEC 
new regs. 
Farmers are facing an assault of re-
peated increases in regulations and 
rises in inputs cost. When world leaders 
are warning of coming food shortages, 
don’t make it harder for farmers to do 
their jobs and grow food for people to 
use. 
Small family farms are struggling fi-
nancially to keep their operations up 
and running. They don’t have the funds 
to hire a full-scale environmental com-
pliance department to meet the SEC’s 
ridiculous proposed demands. Farmers 
are producing more food and fibers 
with less inputs, like water, land, and 
labor than ever before.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6891 
July 20, 2022 
The SEC needs to think about the 
unintended catastrophic consequences 
this new rule will have on our Nation’s 
farmers, and in turn, on our food sup-
ply, which is already going to be short. 
We need to fight together in a bipar-
tisan effort to combat this blatant gov-
ernment overreach.

WOMEN’S HEALTH RIGHTS UNDER 
ATTACK 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, under the Affordable Care 
Act, contraception is covered as an es-
sential benefit, recognizing its impor-
tance to overall healthcare. Yet, this 
essential health component is one of 
the many rights under attack by an ex-
treme, politicized Supreme Court. 
Congress must act now to protect the 
freedom of individuals to make their 
own 
decisions 
about 
reproductive 
health and family planning. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting the Right to Contraception 
Act 
and 
ensure 
this 
fundamental 
healthcare benefit isn’t the latest right 
stolen from the millions of Americans 
who rely on it. 
f 
END INFLATIONARY SPENDING 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, inflation 
is at the highest rate it has been since 
1981. Meanwhile, Congressional Demo-
crats are spending this week passing a 
funding bill full of liberal initiatives 
that will fan the flames of the already 
red-hot inflation Tennesseans are fac-
ing due to Democrats’ reckless spend-
ing. 
When will enough be enough? 
Madam Speaker, Democrats’ social-
ist spending spree includes an overall 
14 percent increase in domestic fund-
ing, a 20 percent increase to the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency, and a 10 
percent increase to the FDA, the same 
department that failed to quickly ad-
dress the baby formula shortage when 
we all knew it was coming. 
Borrowing more money from China, 
throwing it out the door and forcing 
our grandchildren to pay it back only 
creates more problems, not solve them. 
We need to return to our commonsense 
roots and end this inflationary spend-
ing now. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
voting ‘‘no.’’ 
f 
DESERT SAGE YOUTH WELLNESS 
CENTER 
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the House passage of 
my 
bill, 
the 
Desert 
Sage 
Youth 
Wellness Center Access Improvement 
Act, which is now on its way to the 
President’s desk. This much-needed 
legislation will bring a paved access 
road 
to 
the 
Desert 
Sage 
Youth 
Wellness Center in Hemet. 
The Desert Sage Youth Wellness Cen-
ter is the only operational Indian 
Health Service youth treatment center 
in the entire State. It is the only place 
in California where Native youth can 
receive 
culturally 
relevant 
mental 
health care and substance use disorder 
treatment. 
Yet, to get to the center, patients 
and staff have to traverse a dirt road 
that often cracks in the heat and wash-
es out in the rain and hinders deliv-
eries and services. 
As a physician, I know how crucial 
culturally based care is to the health 
and well-being of our communities. 
That is why I advocated for the con-
struction of Desert Sage since day one, 
and why I secured funding for its com-
pletion in 2016, and why now, I am 
working to deliver safe, reliable access 
to this facility. 
Madam Speaker, I urge President 
Biden to sign this into law imme-
diately to help pave a road worthy of 
the dignity of the people at Desert 
Sage Youth Wellness Center.

WORLD TRADE CENTER HEALTH 
PROGRAM 
(Ms. MALLIOTAKIS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to bring attention to the 
fact that the World Trade Center 
Health Program is facing a looming 
deficit of $3 billion. In a few weeks we 
are going to be commemorating the 21- 
year anniversary of 9/11, the horrific 
terrorist attacks, where we told fire-
fighters, police officers, families who 
lost loved ones, and those who today 
are battling cancers and illnesses, that 
we would never forget, and that we 
would stand by them and give them 
what they needed on their journey in 
this great country. 
They gave so selflessly. They put 
their lives on the line, and so many 
lost their life on that dreadful day. But 
to this day, we still have heroes who 
are battling these illnesses, and we 
should not be leaving this session, we 
should not be leaving next week with-
out passing this incredibly important 
bill, H.R. 4965, the 9/11 Responder and 
Survivor Health Funding Correction 
Act. 
This bill has bipartisan support. I am 
proud to be a prime sponsor of this bill, 
but we must call on the Speaker of the 
House to bring this to the floor before 
we leave next week. We owe it to those 
who put their life on the line for our 
city and our great country.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 1232, the gentle-
woman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO) and the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. DIAZ-BALART) each will 
control 15 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The bipartisan en bloc amendment 
includes 29 proposals offered by my 
Democratic and Republican colleagues. 
This bipartisan en bloc amendment 
will make changes to the Financial 
Services bill, the Interior bill, and the 
Military Construction bill. 
For example, for the Financial Serv-
ices bill, the amendment will increase 
funding for entrepreneurial develop-
ment programs by $6.7 million, in-
crease funding for the Truman Founda-
tion, and provide $5 million to help pre-
vent fentanyl overdoses. 
For Interior, the amendment will en-
hance activities for the preservation of 
historically Black colleges and univer-
sities and civil rights landmarks. 
For 
military 
construction, 
the 
amendment will provide $1 million for 
grants to assist States and Tribal orga-
nizations 
in 
establishing 
veterans’ 
cemeteries and support increased ac-
cess to medical care for veterans. 
These are bipartisan proposals that 
we can all support, and I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. SPANBERGER). 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Chair, I 
stand in support of my amendment to 
increase funding for suicide prevention 
coordinators at the VA, and I thank 
the chairwoman for her advocacy and 
good work on the larger bill. 
Last Saturday, the new 988 national 
suicide prevention lifeline launched. 
Now veterans in crisis can reach the 
veterans crisis line by calling 988 and 
pressing 1. 
b 1215 
This new number will allow more in-
dividuals to access help when they need 
it the most, and it will save lives. 
Due to this transition, the VA antici-
pates an increase in call volume, as 
much as 21⁄2 times higher than last 
year. We need to make sure that there 
are enough professionals in place at the 
VA to handle the uptick in caseloads— 
starting with suicide prevention coor-
dinators. 
Suicide prevention coordinators re-
ceive referrals from Veterans Crisis 
Line callers, and remain in contact 
with high-risk veterans, providing fol-
low-up care and connecting them with 
resources within their communities. 
The 988 number is an important step 
in providing mental health care to vet-
erans in crisis. But it is our duty to en-
sure that there are suicide prevention 
coordinators in place to care for those 
who have borne the battle. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the Americans 
who represent the very best of our 
country and ensuring the success of the 
new 988 National Suicide Prevention 
Lifeline for all those who may need it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chairman, as I 
stated, this en bloc will make this 
package stronger and meet the needs of 
the people who have entrusted in us 
their faith that we can serve them and 
serve them well. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6893 
July 20, 2022 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong sup-
port of Amendment 159, which would increase 
and decreases funding from the Office of the 
DOI Secretary by $4,000,000. The intent of 
Amendment 159 is to increase the funding of 
the DOI’s 9/11 Memorial Act Grant Program 
for FY2023 from $4 million to $8 million. 
Authorized by Congress with the passing of 
the bipartisan 9/11 Memorial Act in 2018 and 
signed into law in 2019, the program provides 
funding for the operation, security, and mainte-
nance of a memorial commemorating the vic-
tims of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade 
Center, the Pentagon, and United Flight 93 on 
September 11, 2001, and the victims of the at-
tack on the World Trade Center on February 
26, 1993. Awardees are selected for their ex-
traordinary commitment to honoring the lives 
lost on 9/11, and those who risked their own 
lives to save others. 
We have endeavored, as a Nation, to en-
sure that the 9/11 Memorials continue to stand 
as places of reflection and remembrance for 
every American. Every generation should 
know the tragic events of that Tuesday morn-
ing and the heroism of those who rushed back 
to the burning Pentagon and onto the pile at 
Ground Zero to put out fires, search for sur-
vivors, clear debris, and rebuild for months 
and years. The funding provided by the 9/11 
Memorial Act Grant Program is critical to en-
suring that memorials—like the acre-wide re-
flecting pools in the footprint of the Twin Tow-
ers in New York and the solemn benches 
marking each life lost on the grounds of the 
Pentagon—continue to provide sacred and in-
spiring spots accessible to millions of visitors 
for decades to come. 
I urge my colleagues to vote Yea on Bipar-
tisan En Bloc 7 and final passage of H.R. 
8294. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendments en bloc offered by 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I demand 
a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendments en bloc 
offered by the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 137 OFFERED BY MS. TLAIB 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 137 printed 
in House Report 117–420. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chair, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of division D (before the short 
title), insert the following: 
SEC. lll. None of the funds made avail-
able by any title in this Act may be used to 
implement, administer, or enforce section 
908(b) of the Trade Sanctions Reform and Ex-
port Enhancement Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 
7207(b)). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 1232, the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chair, I would thank 
Chairmen 
QUIGLEY, 
MEEKS, 
and 
MCGOVERN and their staffs for working 
with me on this critical amendment 
and for their leadership throughout 
this process. 
I also thank the incredible Congress-
woman LEE for joining me here today 
to speak in support of this critical pol-
icy change, and, of course, Congress-
man CRAWFORD
who submitted this 
change as a Republican-led bipartisan 
amendment to the FSGG appropria-
tions bill in 2017 and has been a great 
advocate on this issue over the years. 
This is an amendment that is crit-
ical, and it builds on more than a dec-
ade of efforts by bipartisan Members of 
the House and Senate and the farm in-
dustry leaders across the country. 
As Cubans face one of the most pain-
ful crises in three decades, forcing tens 
of thousands of Cubans to spend long 
hours each day waiting in lines in 
hopes of finding food, our amendment 
would provide temporary relief to them 
as well as U.S. farm exporters by sus-
pending enforcement for 1 year of the 
prohibition and extending credit to 
Cuban food buyers. 
This amendment makes sense for two 
reasons. 
First, the Cuban people are con-
tending with significant food short-
ages, as I mentioned. By allowing 
Cuban importers to buy U.S. food prod-
ucts on credit, we can help ease the 
suffering of everyday Cubans and build 
good will between our peoples. Simply 
put, it is the most humane thing we 
can do right now and the right thing to 
do. 
Second, the amendment would also 
help American ag producers as well by 
removing trade barriers that put them 
at a competitive disadvantage with 
countries thousands of miles away, like 
China and Vietnam. 
For my home State of Michigan, and 
many others across the country, this 
amendment effectively opens up a new 
market of about 11 million people for 
our farmers and for their exports. 
I know Michigan’s director of Agri-
culture and Rural Development, Gary 
McDowell, noted that our State’s farm-
ers seek great opportunities for prod-
ucts such as dry beans, apples, dairy 
products, and poultry that are major 
staples of the Cuban diet. 
This amendment is good for our 
Cuban people, as well as good for the 
American farmers, and the right thing 
to do. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
please support this amendment, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I 
claim time in opposition. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Florida is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, let’s 
be clear, this is not the time to provide 
unilateral concessions to a designated 
state sponsor of terrorism. This amend-
ment is simply a bailout for the anti- 
American terrorist regime of Cuba, a 
regime that brutally oppresses the 
Cuban people and continuously under-
mines U.S. national security interests. 
It aids adversaries such as Russia, 
the Maduro regime in Venezuela, and 
terrorist groups such as FARC and 
ELN, just to mention a couple. 
Remember, the law allows for unlim-
ited quantities of food and medicine 
and other basic necessities that are al-
ready allowed to be sent and to be sold 
to Cuba. What we must not do is leave 
the American taxpayers on the hook to 
subsidize the Cuban terrorist regime. 
This is not the time to bail out an 
enemy of the United States, which har-
bors fugitives from U.S. justice, which 
allows Russian spy ships to dock in its 
waters, that ruthlessly oppresses the 
Cuban people, imprisoning even chil-
dren for just speaking out for freedom. 
This amendment, by the way, would 
also ensure that American farmers are 
not paid because we all know that the 
Cuban regime does not pay back its 
debts. This would, again, put the Amer-
ican taxpayer on the hook to help the 
Cuban regime. 
Let’s be clear, a vote against this 
amendment is a vote for freedom. A 
vote against this amendment is a vote 
for the American national security in-
terests. A vote against this amendment 
is a vote for human rights and freedom 
for the Cuban people. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chair, as I said, this 
amendment would help alleviate the 
suffering of the Cuban people. It also is 
very important to note that this is 
identical to a bipartisan Republican- 
led amendment submitted just a few 
years ago. 
Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. 
DELAURO), the chairwoman of the Ap-
propriations Committee. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I rise in 
support of the amendment offered by 
Ms. TLAIB. Our Nation’s policy toward 
Cuba over the past six decades has 
proven to be ineffective and counter-
productive. The Biden administration 
has started to peel back some of these 
restrictive policies in a manner that 
will both empower the Cuban people 
and safeguard U.S. national security 
interests, and this amendment would 
further these efforts. 
This amendment would lift the long-
standing restrictions on the private fi-
nancing of agricultural exports to 
Cuba, which harm U.S. farmers and 
ranchers and their competitiveness. 
Cuba imports more than $2 billion in 
agricultural exports per year. 
Eliminating this longstanding prohi-
bition would increase business for our 
Nation’s ranchers and farmers, and we 
would create jobs for hardworking 
American families. 
Let me give you an example. In 2021, 
the U.S. rice imports from Vietnam 
were $12.6 million; Malaysia, $16 mil-
lion; Thailand, $51 million; and Paki-
stan, $34 million. We are costing Amer-
ican taxpayers dollars by importing

when we could be helping Alabama and 
Louisiana and be able to import rice 
from Cuba at a lot lower cost. 
Mr. Chair, I support the reforms that 
allow for better relationships with 
Cuba, and I urge support for this 
amendment. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chair, may I ask how 
much time I have remaining? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
has 11⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chair, while I under-
stand and share some of the concerns, 
the reality is the embargoes aren’t 
working and have failed to achieve any 
of its aims for over a half a century. 
I think my colleagues, all of us, at 
least agree that there is no more prin-
cipled reason to engage than to ease 
the suffering of the Cuban people who 
are currently again suffering from huge 
amounts of food shortages. 
I think it is critically important to 
understand there is trade happening 
now, but in cash. This would again 
allow the access to credit to be able to 
do it in a way that allows farmers in 
not only Michigan but across the coun-
try who are asking us to help them do 
more and export and allow them to ad-
dress some of the food shortages that 
help the Cuban people so much more. 
Mr. Chair, for those reasons I urge 
my colleagues to please vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
this amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. GIMENEZ). 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Chairman, pardon 
me if I get a little emotional, this is 
actually personal for me since I was ac-
tually born in Cuba. 
Mr. Chair, I rise to oppose Congress-
woman TLAIB’s FSGG amendment to 
exempt current prohibitions against 
U.S. assistance to Cuba. 
It is ironic that this amendment is 
being pushed on the week after we 
commemorated the bravery of the pro- 
freedom protesters in Cuba. 
Whether we are talking about the 
Biden administration’s announcement 
last month to allow private travel to 
Cuba or allow Americans to invest in 
so-called 
private 
companies 
within 
Cuba, the regime takes advantage of 
these lifelines to fuel their butchery, 
their massacres, their jailings, their 
nonstop violations of human rights. 
Now, Congresswoman TLAIB wants to 
extend yet another pipeline of cash to 
the regime to directly fund the mur-
dering, the raping, the jailing of the 
Cuban people. Quite frankly, anyone 
supporting this legislation really ought 
to be ashamed of themselves. 
If you believe in freedom and democ-
racy, in capitalism, in the power of 
economic and social opportunity, I 
urge you to vote against this shameful 
and pathetic amendment. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chairman, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ). 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Chair, I thank the gentleman for yield-
ing and for his leadership and compas-
sion about this extremely important 
issue. 
Mr. Chair, I must rise in opposition 
to 
the 
gentlewoman’s 
amendment. 
While I know she has the best of inten-
tions, I want to be very practical about 
my opposition to this. The reality is 
the amendment will not alleviate the 
suffering of the Cuban people, quite the 
contrary. In fact, it may exacerbate 
their pain by simply enriching a tyran-
nical regime who uses violence and re-
pression to keep their cruel grip on 
power. 
On a day in which we just heard from 
the First Lady of Ukraine, who is obvi-
ously experiencing what the brunt of 
repression means from a brutal dic-
tator, we certainly should not be cav-
ing to brutal dictatorship in the West-
ern Hemisphere. 
The dictatorship in Cuba controls all 
trade on the island, and, in turn, uses 
resources to oppress its own people. 
The current cash-in-advance require-
ment for the financing of agricultural 
exports to Cuba ensures that the re-
gime in Cuba cannot benefit from loans 
or credit, and that its corrupt, mili-
tary-run financial institutions are not 
intertwined with American financial 
institutions. 
Please, anyone within the sound of 
my voice needs to understand that this 
amendment allows U.S. persons to in-
vest in Cuban agricultural businesses, 
even if those businesses are involved in 
trafficking and confiscated property, 
as defined in the LIBERTAD Act, 
which is law, even if the business is 
controlled by the Government of Cuba, 
the Cuban military, or any other enti-
ty. It is inexplicable to me how we 
could allow that. 
It is also important to point out that 
unlimited quantities of food, medicine, 
and other basic necessities are already 
permitted into Cuba both for sale and 
through humanitarian donations. 
And as the Biden administration has 
done, the best way to lift up the Cuban 
people is to support their efforts for 
democratic reform and mount pressure 
for release of hundreds of arbitrarily 
detained political prisoners, including 
20 children. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
vote against this amendment and sup-
port liberty all over the world. 
b 1230 
Ms. TLAIB. I am prepared to close, 
Mr. Chair. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. Mr. Chair, 
I rise in strong opposition to amend-
ment No. 137. 
Unlimited quantities of food and 
medicine are already permitted in 
Cuba, yet this egregious amendment 
would allow the financing of agricul-
tural exports to the island. The Cuban 
regime controls 100 percent—a single 
company controls all agricultural im-
ports. It is owned by the military. It is 
controlled by the enforcers of the Com-
munist regime. 
Tens of thousands of Cubans tried to 
protest just 1 year ago, and thousands 
of them are in prison. Children are im-
prisoned by this Communist regime. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Chair, this is only 
about food. The Members in opposition 
are claiming to stand with the people 
of Cuba, but this is our opportunity to 
support the Cuban people and help 
them right now. When we take this op-
portunity to vote ‘‘yes,’’ we show that 
the U.S. isn’t the enemy of the Cuban 
people during their time of need. At 
the same time, we are helping our local 
farmers right here. Vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I move to 
strike the last word. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
MALLIOTAKIS). 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Mr. Chair, I un-
derstand the plight of the Cuban peo-
ple, I would say, more than most in 
this Chamber simply because I still 
have family who resides there. It is 
true that these people are starving, and 
they are struggling, but the reality is 
that it is because of their own govern-
ment. 
Whatever you do, Mr. Chair, any 
business that you conduct with Cuba 
will go to the regime. It never gets to 
the actual people. We know this be-
cause that is the way they have acted 
in the course of history, doing business 
with every other country in the world 
and then taking it all for themselves 
while the people suffer. 
The people who want the Fight for 
$15 on the other side of the aisle know 
that the people of Cuba make $15 per 
day, 
that 
they 
are 
being 
treated 
inhumanly, and that young children 
are put in jail. 
If you want to help the Cuban people, 
Mr. Chair, side with them in their 
quest for freedom. Side with them 
when they say they want to be liber-
ated. They want what we have in the 
United States. 
Stop appeasing the regime; stop em-
powering the regime; and stand on the 
side of freedom. 
Let’s try to change this form of gov-
ernment for the better so those people 
can have true human rights and free-
doms that they deserve and that they 
are not put in political prisons simply 
for peacefully protesting like we are so 
privileged to do here in the United 
States. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield to 
the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. 
GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Tennessee. The cur-
rent regime controls all the imports. If 
you give money to the regime, Mr. 
Chair, they keep the money. They 
don’t trickle it down to the people. 
They are a current state sponsor of 
terrorism and a close ally of Putin’s 
Russia, the Maduro regime in Ven-
ezuela, the terrorist state of Iran, and

terrorist groups such as FARC and 
ELN. They are currently participating 
in a military exercise in Venezuela led 
by the Russians. 
Again, just 1 year ago, thousands of 
Cubans protested in the streets in 
every province in Cuba demanding 
libertad—freedom. Hundreds of them 
remain in prison, including children, as 
I said, for daring to speak freely. Yet, 
today, Congress is debating whether to 
provide financing to their captors. 
A vote against this amendment is a 
pro-freedom, pro-America, and pro- 
human rights vote, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this amend-
ment. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chair, I rise in 
support of this amendment to permit American 
farmers to help alleviate hunger in Cuba. As 
one of the co-chairs of the Bipartisan Cuba 
Working Group, I thank Congresswoman TLAIB 
for offering it, and I thank the Speaker and my 
working group co-chair, Chairman JIM MCGOV-
ERN for making it in order. 
After more than six decades, the U.S. em-
bargo on Cuba has accomplished nothing ex-
cept to cause suffering among the Cuban peo-
ple. This policy is a complete failure. And yet 
it continues, a policy that divides families and 
hurts working people in Cuba. 
This amendment would permit American 
farmers to help alleviate the current hunger 
crisis in Cuba that is made worse by COVID 
and our embargo. In one fell swoop, we could 
show that America puts humanitarian values 
first, and head off competition from countries 
like China who seek to make inroads in our 
hemisphere. 
This amendment is good for American farm-
ers, good for the Cuban people, and good for 
healing Cuban-American families divided by 
misguided U.S. policy. I urge my colleagues to 
vote yes. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Mr. Chair, I de-
mand a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan will

from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO) and the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. DIAZ-BALART) each will 
control 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. MCGOVERN), who is the chair of 
the Rules Committee. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I thank 
Chairwoman DELAURO for yielding to 
me. 
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of 
this bipartisan en bloc, which would 
eliminate funding for the VA Asset and 
Infrastructure Review, or AIR, Com-
mission, and transfer the $5 million to 
the Healthcare for Homeless Veterans 
Program. 
Let me be clear. The recommenda-
tions advanced so far as part of the 
VA’s asset and infrastructure review 
process will lead to the closure or 
downsizing of nearly one-third of this 
country’s VA medical facilities and 
community-based outpatient clinics. I 
believe that is an unacceptable and, 
frankly, rotten way to treat veterans, 
who have put their lives on the line for 
this country. 
This entire process is a backdoor way 
to cut services for veterans, and I 
strongly urge my colleagues to support 
our veterans and vote ‘‘yes’’ on this 
amendment, which has the support of a 
wide range of veterans advocacy orga-
nizations from across the political 
spectrum. 
This bipartisan amendment elimi-
nates funding for a commission that 
would make it harder for veterans 
across America to get the care they de-
serve. 
The decision to recommend shutting 
down these VA healthcare facilities 
was based on totally flawed and years- 
old information. There are huge, unac-
ceptable, and inexcusable gaps in the 
data that was used to determine which 
facilities to shut down. The VA did not 
consider cases where hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars in new investments 
were made in facilities that were rec-
ommended for closure. It makes abso-
lutely no sense. 
Let me give you an example. One of 
the facilities that would be closed is 
the Leeds VA Medical Center in Massa-
chusetts. They said that this facility 
should be closed because it needed 
nearly $200 million in upgrades. What 
they didn’t say was that we already in-
vested in those upgrades. $200 million 
in taxpayer money was already in-
vested in this facility, and now they 
are recommending that it be shut 
down. 
Talk about ripping off the American 
taxpayer. 
The data that they used is from years 
ago. It is inexcusable. Even the VA ad-
mits this. This is the definition of stu-
pid. We might as well throw taxpayer 
money out the window if these flawed 
recommendations move forward. 
That is not even to mention the im-
pact this commission would have on 
veterans. I held a listening session to 
hear 
how 
these 
recommendations 
would affect many veterans in Massa-
chusetts and across the country. I hap-
pen to have a map here, by the way. 
Here is the map. The yellow is partial 
closures, and the blue is total closures 
all across the country. 
Again, what we are finding out by ob-
jective observers is that all this is 
based on flawed and outdated informa-
tion, and they are recommending that 
they shut these facilities down. 
But I am learning here that this 
would literally force veterans to drive 
hours and hours across State lines just 
to get basic care. I talk to people with 
PTSD who say: I am just not going to 
get care anymore if I have to drive 
across the State into another State to 
get care. 
Older veterans who need nursing 
home care could have to move long dis-
tances from their support systems. 
This process so far is a complete and 
total slap in the face to these veterans, 
and we should not spend one penny 
more on a commission that is going to 
be used to advance these awful cuts to 
veterans’ services. 
If this moves forward, closures and 
consolidation of VA facilities are man-
datory, but recommendations to build 
new facilities are subject to future ap-
propriations and are not guaranteed. 
So, this Appropriations Committee will 
have to decide whether to invest in the 
new facilities or the consolidation of 
facilities. 
That is why groups like the Disabled 
American Veterans, Paralyzed Vet-
erans of America, and Veterans of For-
eign Wars all support shutting down 
this commission right now, which is 
what this amendment would do. 
Everyone knows that this process 
and the commission are broken. Even 
VA Secretary McDonough acknowl-
edged it to Congress, telling the House 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee that the 
data is not up to speed in light of the 
pandemic. I am also grateful that the 
chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Com-
mittee here in the House, Chairman 
TAKANO, is supporting my amendment. 
I want to be clear that Secretary 
McDonough has done a great job on ad-
vocating for our veterans, and he is 
working with my team and me to get 
to the bottom of some of these prob-
lems. But this process started because 
of a bill that Congress passed even be-
fore he became Secretary. I have spo-
ken to him, and I know that he, too, 
does not want to make it harder for 
veterans to get care. The solution is 
that 
Congress 
needs 
to 
pass 
this 
amendment. 
Even our nonpartisan congressional 
watchdog, the GAO, recently put out a 
report on this called ‘‘VA Health Care: 
Incomplete Information Hinders Use-
fulness of Market Assessments for VA 
Facility Realignment.’’ 
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the 
gentleman has expired.

H6896 
July 20, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield the 
gentleman from Massachusetts an ad-
ditional 2 minutes. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, I include 
the executive summary in the RECORD. 
[From the United States Government 
Accountability Office, Feb. 2022] 
INCOMPLETE INFORMATION HINDERS USEFUL-
NESS OF MARKET ASSESSMENTS FOR VA FA-
CILITY REALIGNMENT 
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
conducted assessments of its capacity within 
96 markets to deliver health care to veterans 
through VA providers and, when the Depart-
ment 
cannot 
provide 
the 
care 
needed, 
through non-VA providers, known as com-
munity care. For these assessments, markets 
are designated geographic areas made up of a 
set of contiguous counties that contain one 
or more VA medical centers and associated 
clinics. For an overview of VA’s approach, 
see the figure. 
Text of Overview of Department of Vet-
erans Affairs’ Approach to Its Market As-
sessments: 
Compiled data about the market including 
veteran health care supply and demand, 
Identified gaps between supply and de-
mand, 
Developed proposals to respond to gaps be-
tween supply and demand, and 
Issue final proposals. 
VA officials described the department’s 
process of developing proposals as iterative 
in that VA continually reviewed and revised 
draft proposals throughout the market as-
sessments process. The VA Secretary plans 
to transmit recommendations to the Asset 
and Infrastructure Review Commission by 
March 14, 2022—that is, no later than 6 weeks 
from the statutory deadline of January 31, 
2022. The Commission will then review these 
recommendations, hold public hearings, and 
prepare and issue their own recommenda-
tions to the President. 
GAO identified gaps in the data VA com-
piled and certified for the market assess-
ments that were relevant to determining 
both the supply of and demand for non-VA 
care. For example, VA lacked complete data 
on the extent to which its contractors main-
tain an adequate number of non-VA pro-
viders to ensure veterans have timely access 
to community care. VA officials told GAO 
that they determined supply and demand 
based on the most recently available data at 
the time of data compilation—December 2018 
to November 2020. In addition, while VA offi-
cials told GAO the end-of-assessment anal-
yses included updated data on community 
care, these data did not address the gaps 
GAO identified. Without such information, 
VA lacks a full understanding of the extent 
to which community care is able to supple-
ment VA facility care to meet veterans’ cur-
rent and future demand. 
GAO also found that VA’s approach to the 
market assessments did not include steps to 
collect information on the quality of VA 
data compiled from numerous VA data 
sources or other steps to understand any rel-
evant data limitations. Instead, VA officials 
leading the market assessments said they re-
lied on VA offices responsible for the data-
bases to ensure the data quality. As a result, 
VA is unable to communicate to external 
stakeholders, such as the Asset and Infra-
structure Review Commission, all relevant 
information on the quality of VA data used 
in market assessments, including any limi-
tations affecting these data and the result-
ing proposals for realignment. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Chair, moving 
forward with funding this fundamen-
tally broken process would be an in-
credible disservice to our veterans and 
would jeopardize access to the high- 
quality, specialized care that they have 
earned. 
This commission is being dismantled 
as we speak because the recommenda-
tions that were made to it were so 
catastrophically bad. Last month, Sen-
ate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chair-
man JON TESTER led a bipartisan group 
of 12 Senators to announce that the 
Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee 
would not even confirm any more 
nominees to the commission, effec-
tively ending this process once and for 
all. Last week, we had an amendment 
to the NDAA pass to shut this down. 
Why are we giving $5 million to a 
commission that may very well never 
exist and which is actively seeking to 
undermine care for our veterans and 
their families? 
Mr. Chair, we all believe in upgrading 
and updating our VA system, but let’s 
use accurate information. There is no 
way that anybody here can tell me 
that the recommendations that are 
being put forward are based on accu-
rate and updated information. We are 
talking about our veterans, who are 
now going through needless anxiety be-
cause of all these threats of closures. 
Mr. Chair, we need to do better, and 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
this en bloc. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Chair, I rise to speak on the need 
to provide certainty to blueberry pro-
ducers who have been affected by 
freezes. 
We all know how difficult the job of 
being a farmer can be. So much of their 
success is completely dependent on 
things outside of their control. This is 
particularly true when it comes to foul 
weather and disasters. Farmers are at 
nature’s mercy when it comes to these 
events. 
This past year, a number of specialty 
crops across the country saw signifi-
cant losses caused by freezes, particu-
larly blueberries in my home State of 
Georgia. The statewide freeze event 
this past March resulted in losses that 
exceed $140 million. 
The last time a similar devastating 
freeze occurred, Congress was able to 
come together and provide funding for 
those losses. 
I thank the Appropriations’ Agri-
culture, Rural Development, Food and 
Drug 
Administration, 
and 
Related 
Agencies Subcommittee chair, SAN-
FORD BISHOP, from Georgia, for all of 
his support already for this effort. 
The underlying bill includes $10 mil-
lion for disasters occurring in 2022 and 
report language expressing Congress’ 
concerns about the impact of extreme 
weather events on blueberry producers. 
However, that $10 million will not be 
enough to assist with the damages 
from disasters. Chairman BISHOP has 
committed to continue working on this 
issue and to ensure adequate funding is 
available to blueberry and other pro-
ducers affected by freezes in 2022. 
Mr. Chair, I hope we can continue to 
demonstrate Congress’ commitment to 
not only providing relief when farmers 
need it the most but also fixing the 
larger issue for good so we no longer 
need to return to this after future 
freezes. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ), 
who is the chairperson of the Military 
Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Re-
lated Agencies Subcommittee. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
With great respect for my friend from 
Massachusetts, I rise in strong opposi-
tion to these amendments. 
I spend every day in my work as 
chair of the Military Construction, 
Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee protecting and improv-
ing the lives of our Nation’s veterans. I 
vigorously 
oppose 
privatization, 
so 
much so that I voted against the VA 
MISSION Act, in which the AIR Com-
mission appeared as part of that law, 
because of my concern about sending 
veterans who might end up remaining 
permanently in community care. 
This en bloc contains two amend-
ments to the MILCON-VA division that 
would eliminate funding for the AIR 
Commission at the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs. This independent com-
mission was established by the VA 
MISSION Act to develop recommenda-
tions to modernize and realign VA 
health facilities so we can best meet 
the needs of our Nation’s veterans. 
The reality is that the VA has dif-
ferent infrastructure needs today than 
it did decades ago. Not only are most 
VA facilities over 60 years old, but the 
veteran population has also shifted 
geographically over time. 
b 1245 
The draft market assessments VA 
has developed and will continue to 
fine-tune are essential to ensure that 
VA’s facility footprint meets veterans’ 
needs where they are physically lo-
cated today, not where most veterans 
were over 60 years ago. We can’t ignore 
these changes and also effectively meet 
the current needs of our veterans. 
We cannot just cancel the Commis-
sion and pretend the problem doesn’t 
exist or need to be addressed. We all 
care about veterans and, since we do, 
we should be focused together on mak-
ing sure they have state-of-the-art fa-
cilities that are designed to modern 
standards and are best-positioned to 
serve them. 
The point of VA’s market assess-
ments is to identify the current, true 
needs of our veterans in each market, 
and the AIR Commission will then re-
view those assessments and make final 
recommendations to the President and 
to the Congress. They come back to 
Congress after these market assess-
ments and recommendations are made.

July 20, 2022 
The funding in this bill does not im-
plement the recommendations. I re-
peat. The funding in this bill does not 
implement the recommendations. 
We all, on both sides of the aisle, con-
sistently talk about meeting the needs 
of our veterans. Making sure veterans 
have access to high-quality care in 
high-quality facilities is a priority we 
all share. Adjusting the landscape of 
our facilities to meet veterans where 
they live today is key to meeting the 
needs of our veterans. 
If we want to make sure that we 
don’t move further toward privatized 
healthcare for our veterans, we need to 
make sure that there are VA facilities 
that are convenient for them, or that 
they are eligible by law to go into com-
munity care if there are not. 
I have the utmost respect for the 
gentleman and my colleagues who are 
sponsors of this amendment, but as 
Chair of the Military Construction, 
Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee responsible for the en-
tire budget for the VA, it is our respon-
sibility to meet the needs of veterans 
across the entire country. 
We need to be careful about making 
rash decisions that have a long-term 
impact. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
amend-
ments in this en bloc will do more 
harm than good. And for those reasons, 
I will vote ‘‘no’’ on this en bloc, and I 
urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN), 
the chairman of the Legislative Branch 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Chair, I rise in sup-
port of this amendment. 
I represent Ohio, and we have a num-
ber of VA clinics and facilities in rural 
areas across this country. One of ours 
is in Chillicothe, the Chillicothe VA 
Medical Center that this commission 
recommended for closure. They were 
saying it was not optimally located. 
This is in the southern part of the 
State, by the Ohio River, serving all of 
the veterans in the southern part of 
Ohio. And 1,400 Ohioans are employed. 
The facility is over 100 years old. It 
serves 20,000 veterans in 17 counties. 
This is insane that we think that 
that is a good idea; that of all the 
waste and abuse in the United States 
Government, we are going to target a 
rural VA facility in southern Ohio with 
a State that has 865,000 veterans. 
I think this is a wise amendment. I 
support the McGovern amendment, and 
I urge my colleagues to support it as 
well. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I continue 
to reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield to 
the gentleman from Maine (Mr. GOLD-
EN). 
Mr. GOLDEN. Mr. Chair, I rise in 
support of the amendment. 
I represent the largest district east of 
the Mississippi. It is the second most 
rural district in the country, and home 
to more than 53,000 veterans. 
The VA facilities that these veterans 
rely on—these are clinics in places like 
Houlton, 
Maine, 
Fort 
Kent, 
and 
Rumford—are at risk of being shut 
down if we don’t permanently end the 
Asset and Infrastructure, or AIR Com-
mission. 
Our VA hospital in Maine would be 
moved from Augusta. It would be 
downsized to an urgent care facility 
then be moved to Portland, Maine, 
which is a long distance away from 
most of the rural communities that I 
represent. 
Of course, Congress created this 
panel and tasked it with processing the 
recommendations given to streamline 
VA facilities. I think if you live in a 
rural State, it turns out that has large-
ly been shorthand for closing facilities 
or reducing access to healthcare serv-
ices. 
I introduced a bipartisan bill to 
eliminate the AIR Commission. Just 
about a month ago, I helped secure the 
language referred to earlier in the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act of 
that bill and, of course, I now support 
this amendment to defund the Commis-
sion and transfer the money to the 
VA’s Healthcare for Homeless Veterans 
Program. It is a far better use of the 
money. 
I thank Mr. MCGOVERN for his sup-
port of our Nation’s veterans. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I continue 
to reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Ms. 
SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today in support of Chairman MCGOV-
ERN’s amendment to increasing funding 
for the Healthcare for Homeless Vet-
erans Program. 
Like many, I recognize the original 
intent for the AIR Commission. The 
VA’s infrastructure is aging, and we 
need to ensure its facilities optimize 
care for veterans. I know that the 
chairman shares my determination to 
ensure our vets receive the best pos-
sible care. 
Unfortunately, the AIR process was 
flawed from the beginning. In a report 
issued earlier this year, the GAO found 
that the data AIR recommendations re-
lied on was outdated and riddled with 
gaps. 
The moment the AIR recommenda-
tions were released, I received calls 
from veterans and VSOs in my district 
concerned about proposals to close the 
CBOC in Paterson, New Jersey. Vet-
erans in my community are already 
asked to travel too far and wait too 
long for care. Closing a central CBOC 
would only exacerbate this. 
So while we must improve our VA fa-
cilities, the AIR’s recommendations 
are the wrong way to go about this. I 
urge my colleagues to support the 
amendment. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendments en bloc offered by 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. POSEY. Mr. Chair, I demand a 
recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendments en bloc 
offered by the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut will be postponed. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings will 
now resume on those amendments 
printed in part A of House Report 117– 
420 on which further proceedings were 
postponed, in the following order: 
Amendments en bloc No. 7 by Ms. 
DELAURO of Connecticut. 
Amendment No. 137 by Ms. TLAIB of 
Michigan. 
Amendments en bloc No. 8 by Ms. 
DELAURO of Connecticut. 
The Chair will reduce to 5 minutes 
the minimum time for any electronic 
vote after the first vote in this series. 
AMENDMENTS EN BLOC NO. 7 OFFERED BY MS. 
DELAURO OF CONNECTICUT 
The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished 
business is the demand for a recorded 
vote on amendments en bloc offered by 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO) on which further pro-
ceedings were postponed and on which 
the ayes prevailed by voice vote. 
The 
Clerk 
will 
redesignate 
the 
amendments en bloc. 
The Clerk redesignated the amend-
ments en bloc.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.

f 
INVESTING IN COMMUNITIES 
(Ms. BOURDEAUX asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of the minibus appro-
priations bill the House passed earlier 
today. 
This legislation includes my bill to 
support the revitalization of vacant 
shopping malls like the Gwinnett Place 
Mall in my district. This provision 
would catalyze additional investment 
in these projects and enhance economic 
activity, access to housing, and mobil-
ity for local residents. 
The minibus also includes six of my 
community project funding requests, 
including funding for the acquisition of 
African-American books and historical 
artifacts at the Hooper-Renwick Me-
morial Library, as well as projects to 
increase 
wraparound 
services 
for 
Latino families and youth through Ser 
Familia, provide transportation to low- 
income students through Corners Out-
reach, and enhance access to transit 
and clean drinking water for many 
communities in Georgia’s Seventh Dis-
trict. 
Altogether, the T-HUD bill and the 
minibus 
include 
important 
invest-
ments that will make our communities 
stronger. 
f 
HONORING BILL EDWARDS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in honor of the inspir-
ing career of Mr. Bill Edwards, who is 
a native resident of Savannah, Georgia. 
After graduating from Groves High 
School, Bill went on to attend both the 
University of Mississippi and Arm-
strong Atlantic State University, com-
pleting his education with a master’s 
in the arts and communications. 
After serving in his high school 
JROTC, he furthered his interest in the 
Army by serving in the Army ROTC at 
Ole Miss and eventually joining the 
U.S. Army Signal Corps. He continued 
this career until he reached the rank of 
captain in a military intelligence unit 
in Savannah. Aside from his military 
career, Bill was blessed with a loving 
wife and seven grandchildren, whom he 
adores. 
Once he left the service, Bill focused 
his energy into a successful career in 
radio broadcasting, eventually becom-
ing host of what is now ‘‘AM Savan-
nah’’ on News Radio. Bill’s commit-
ment was rewarded when he was recog-
nized by the Associated Press for 
sportscasting excellence and when he 
won the honor of Savannah’s Favorite 
Talk Station for 3 years in a row. 
I am so grateful for Bill Edwards and 
his tireless commitment to improving 
his community. Bill is an outstanding 
Georgian, and I thank him for all he 
does for his community. 
f 
WE WON’T GO BACK 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness. These inalienable rights have 
served as a compass in guiding us as we 
strive to create a more perfect Union. 
Yet, recently, these rights have been 
the target of relentless political at-
tacks by a Supreme Court that has 
seemingly abandoned the promises of 
our Constitution and by far-right ex-
tremists with a radical agenda to dis-
mantle decades of progress to take us 
back, back to a time when people were 
ashamed and murdered because the 
person they chose to love didn’t have a 
certain skin color or was of the same 
gender and back to a time when women 
could not access legal and safe repro-
ductive healthcare measures. 
Today, I stand in solidarity with the 
millions of Americans who have been 
angered by these disgraceful acts to 
say that I refuse to be taken back be-
cause we have come much too far. 
f 
FAKE HANDCUFFS WON’T SOLVE 
AMERICA’S PROBLEMS 
(Mrs. BOEBERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, fake 
handcuffs won’t close the southern bor-
der. Fake handcuffs won’t lower gas 
prices, curb inflation, harden the sup-
ply chain, put baby formula on our 
shelves, deter Russia, or fix our broken 
and weak reputation across the globe. 
Mr. Speaker, fake handcuffs won’t fix 
our education system, protect our stu-
dents from CRT and grooming, or cre-
ate opportunities to lift communities 
out of poverty. 
Fake handcuffs won’t increase do-
mestic energy, increase recruitment 
for our military—go woke, go broke— 
or solve a single problem that the 
American people actually care about. 
Mr. Speaker, fake handcuffs make for 
a good photo op, but they don’t benefit 
the American people. Fake handcuffs 
only benefit those who pretend to wear 
them. 
Mr. Speaker, this body should be de-
livering solutions for the American 
people not with fake handcuffs but 
without restraint. 
f 
HONORING ROBERT L. BOWSER 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a great mayor from my 
district, Robert Bowser, after his pass-
ing recently. 
Mayor Bowser served as mayor of 
East Orange, New Jersey, from 1998 to 
2014. He was the first African American 
to win a third and fourth term in office 
in the history of East Orange, and he 
founded the New Jersey Conference of 
Black Mayors and served on the board 
of the National Black Conference of 
Mayors. 
But his legacy in East Orange is 
more than his time as mayor. He start-
ed a small engineering firm that be-
came one of the largest minority- 
owned consulting firms on the East 
Coast. He was a board member for the 
local Girl Scouts organization and was 
active with the Lions Club and the 
Kiwanis Club. He even founded a local 
touch football league. 
As we mourn his passing, we remem-
ber Mayor Bowser as a dedicated public 
servant, great businessman, and strong 
community leader.

FIND AND PROSECUTE COVID–19 
ECONOMIC RELIEF FRAUD 
(Mr. GOTTHEIMER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the House Appropriations Com-
mittee for their hard work on this im-
portant piece of legislation. 
I rise today in support of the passage 
of H.R. 8294, which contained a crucial 
amendment I introduced to help find 
and prosecute cases of fraud within 
COVID–19 economic relief. 
My amendment provides critical in-
vestment for the Small Business Ad-
ministration Office of the Inspector 
General to ensure that they continue 
to hold Economic Injury Disaster Loan 
and 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
fraudsters accountable. 
It is deeply disturbing to hear about 
the recent flurry of fraud convictions 
related to these two relief programs 
that provided vital resources to small 
businesses during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. These are dollars that were 
meant for small businesses struggling 
due to the pandemic, and to help their 
families, not to help greedy cheats 
looking to profit off the backs of their 
neighbors. 
My amendment supports efforts for 
the SBA to identify and prosecute 
cases of EIDL and PPP fraud more ag-
gressively. Applicants from businesses 
in my district may have been denied 
critical financial resources because of 
the actions of these crooks, and we owe 
it to all of our constituents to hold 
these bad actors accountable. 
I strongly urge all my colleagues in 
the Senate to pass this critically im-
portant provision.

FAILURES OF THE U.S. SENATE 
(Mr. CASTEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CASTEN. Mr. Speaker, the West 
is burning and we can’t get the water 
to put it out, thanks to a 1,200-year 
drought. 
Louisiana insurance companies are 
failing due to rising sea levels. 
Families are paying more than ever 
to cool their home and fill up their 
tank with ever more expensive fossil 
fuels. 
And this week, we learned that a ma-
jority of the Senate thinks that is fine. 
They are fine with Americans paying 
too much for energy. They are fine 
with Americans keeping our economy 
coupled to Putin’s war machine. They 
are fine with stealing from consumers 
and stealing from our future to sub-
sidize fossil energy producers today. 
If you have a solar panel on your 
roof, if you have an electric vehicle in 
your driveway or an energy-efficient 
home, you are helping your planet and 
you are helping your wallets. 
In the House, we are making that op-
portunity available to all Americans 
and, yet, the Senate has failed us. 
Their failure is not only a failure to do 
their job, it is not only a failure of 
leadership, the U.S. Senate is increas-
ingly an embarrassment, and I am sick 
of apologizing for them. 
f 
988 CRISIS LINE 
(Mr. CARTER of Louisiana asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 988. These three digits rep-
resent an important first step toward a 
transformed 
crisis 
care 
system 
in 
America. 
Congress passed the legislation to 
formally authorize 988 as the new num-
ber for suicide and mental health cri-
ses. This 24/7 hotline and text line is 
available to people with mental health- 
related distress, including thoughts of 
suicide, mental health crisis, or sub-
stance use crisis. 
Additionally, family and friends can 
use this service to support loved ones 
who are struggling. 
By calling or texting 988, people will 
immediately be connected with trained 
crisis counselors who will do every-
thing they can to help. 
Mental health care is healthcare, and 
the enactment of 988 is a long overdue 
example 
of 
government 
finally 
prioritizing mental health and putting 
crisis care in reach for more Ameri-
cans. But there is much more to do. 
I will continue to work in Congress 
and in the community to help fight the 
stigma and increase mental health sup-
port for all.

SOCIAL SECURITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Con-
necticut (Mr. LARSON) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to address the 
body to talk about Social Security. 
I am pleased to be joined by so many 
of my colleagues from across the coun-
try who understand what Martin Lu-
ther King called the fierce urgency of 
now, and why the United States Con-
gress has to act. 
It has been more than 51 years since 
the United States Congress has en-
hanced the benefits of Social Security. 
Richard Nixon was President, and a 
gallon of milk cost 72 cents. 
Much has changed in 51 years, and 
now, I am proud to announce today 
that the Ways and Means Committee 
will be marking up Social Security 
2100: A Sacred Trust, next Wednesday 
and, in doing so, for the first time in 51 
years Congress will be moving forward 
to enhance benefits for those who need 
it the most. 
Why do I say that? 
Everybody in America knows that 
this pandemic, this global pandemic 
that we are in, has caused unbelievable 
harm across the globe and here in this 
country. 
But who has it affected the most? 
Of the close to 1 million people who 
have perished in the United States, 
over 756,000 of them are over the age of 
65. 
And who is the group that has been 
hurt the most by the ensuing inflation 
that comes from a global pandemic and 
a war in Ukraine? 
It is people on a fixed income. It is 
the more than 65 million Americans 
that are on Social Security. 
I commend President Biden for tak-
ing the leadership in this area; who 
campaigned across the country, assur-
ing Americans that Social Security 
was a sacred trust; which, indeed, it is 
because it has never missed a payment. 
We used to have to go back to 1935 
and talk about the Great Depression. 
We only have to go back as far as 2008 
and 2009 because people understand 
during the Great Recession, when they 
saw their 401(k) become a 101(k), that 
Social Security never missed a pay-
ment, not a pension payment, not a 
spousal payment, not a dependent pay-
ment, not a disability payment. 
It is America’s number one insurance 
program. And all Americans know this, 
and it is easily verified, weekly or 
monthly, when they look at their pay-
check and it says FICA, Federal Insur-
ance Contribution. 
Whose? 
Theirs. It is an earned benefit that 
they have paid into throughout their 
lives. 
And yet, Congress has not acted in 51 
years, until now. Under the leadership 
of President Biden, Speaker PELOSI, 
and Chairman RICHARD NEAL, we are 
moving forward with legislation that 
will provide much-needed relief to peo-
ple struggling in this pandemic and 
dealing with inflation. 
I am pleased that I am joined today 
by so many of my colleagues who have 
told their stories over and over again 
about the citizens that they are inter-
acting with, and what an enormous 
burden this pandemic and inflation has 
caused for them, and now, finally, for 
Congress to act. 
And how so? 
Improving benefits across the board 
by more than 2 percent for everyone; 
making sure that nobody who worked 
all their lives and paid into a system 
can retire into poverty; making sure 
that we have a COLA that actually re-
flects the cost that people incur; mak-
ing sure that we repeal WEP and GPO, 
so that teachers and firefighters— 
something that Mr. PASCRELL
has 
championed his whole time here in 
Congress—understand that relief is on 
its way because Democrats care deeply 
about this. 
We are faced, as well, with an alter-
native from the other side. And here is 
the simple difference. Republicans have 
proposed to end Social Security. Re-
publicans have proposed to cut Social 
Security across the board by more than 
21 percent in 20 different separate pro-
posals in their Republican Study Plan. 
They have also called, in committee, 
in the eight hearings that we have had 
on Social Security, to still privatize 
Social Security. 
Democrats stand, not just to protect 
Social Security, but to expand Social 
Security for those that need it the 
most. And those assembled here today 
understand how vitally important it is. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), the 
‘‘deaness’’ of the House of Representa-
tives, and someone who understands in-
tuitively, women need this benefit the 
most. And in this country more than 3 
million Americans receive below pov-
erty-level checks from Social Security, 
and the vast majority of them are 
women. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman LARSON for his tireless lead-
ership and work to safeguard Social Se-
curity for the benefit of this generation 
of retirees and those that are to come. 
He has worked hard for decades to try 
to bring this bill to the floor. 
I thank Speaker PELOSI, Chairman 
RICHARD NEAL, and Congressman JOHN 
LARSON, chair of the subcommittee, for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6904 
July 20, 2022 
giving us the opportunity to bring to 
the American people what they want, 
and that is a strengthened retirement 
system under Social Security. 
For nearly a century, America has 
made a sacred promise: Those who 
work and labor throughout their lives 
will benefit by a retirement from the 
fruits of their labor. It is an earned 
benefit for pension. It is an insurance 
program that they pay into, as the gen-
tleman has said. 
It is also a survivorship benefit for 
workers who die who have young chil-
dren. It is a disability program for 
those who are harmed on the job. 
b 1445 
Social Security is an earned benefit. 
Yeah, it is a promise, but people earn 
it. It assures a safe and secure retire-
ment for tens of millions upon millions 
of 
Americans 
during 
their 
golden 
years, to those who become disabled, 
and, of course, their family, their chil-
dren, in fact, if something unfortunate 
happens. 
But without the action of Chairman 
LARSON, the Social Security promise is 
deeply at risk. Democrats want to 
strengthen Social Security. Repub-
licans want to end it and cripple it. 
With this legislation, soon to be mov-
ing through the House Ways and Means 
Committee, one of the most important 
bills that will ever come before this 
Chamber, Democrats will push for a 
vote on the floor as soon as possible. 
I hear from thousands of northern 
Ohioans and people across our great 
State who want to see a responsible so-
lution to protect and improve Social 
Security. 
The wealthy must join with the vast 
majority of Americans in paying their 
fair share of social insurance at a per-
centage that equals what other people 
pay to secure Social Security into the 
future. 
By making that happen, the Social 
Security 2100 Act will increase benefits 
for current and new beneficiaries. It 
will protect retirees against inflation, 
which the gentleman has mentioned. It 
will continue to serve the disabled and 
the young children of workers who die 
at a far too young age, and it will re-
peal the windfall elimination provision 
that we have been trying to fix for how 
many decades? I think at least four. 
The Social Security 2100 Act is one of 
the most important bills Congress will 
ever vote on. What a privilege it will be 
to be able to cast a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
America made a promise to workers 
and to retirees and families, and Demo-
crats are committed to making good on 
that promise. This is a Democratic pro-
gram, and we are going to save it as 
Democrats and improve it. 
Thank you, Chairman LARSON. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. I thank 
Ms. KAPTUR and greatly appreciate the 
gentlewoman from Ohio’s comments. 
I yield to the gentleman Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT), who also un-
derstands and has worked tirelessly as 
an original cosponsor of this bill to 
make sure that several of the benefits, 
more than 14 enhancements to this bill, 
are now going to be enjoyed by the peo-
ple of Pennsylvania and all across this 
Nation. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. I thank Chair-
man LARSON for yielding me the time, 
and it is an honor and a privilege for 
me to speak out in favor of this won-
derful bill, Social Security 2100. 
Social Security, something that has 
been a triumph for American govern-
ment for close to a hundred years now; 
Social Security that has kept seniors 
out of poverty. 
It used to be that in this country, 
seniors died in poverty, died of starva-
tion. That happened in America. Don’t 
think it couldn’t happen again. But 
under the Social Security Administra-
tion, it doesn’t happen. 
Seniors who work their whole lives 
and pay into this insurance program 
reap the benefit of doing so and have 
money coming to them. It isn’t a lot, 
but it is keeping people alive and out of 
poverty, and out of poverty through 
some of the most extreme downturns in 
our economy. 
It is something that protected sen-
iors from starving to death during ter-
rible moments of economic stress and 
distress in this country. 
Social Security is something that all 
of us Americans ought rightfully to be 
proud of; that it was enacted during 
the Roosevelt administration; that has 
been protected and defended for gen-
eration after generation; and that it 
has succeeded in keeping Americans 
out of poverty in the most dire cir-
cumstances. 
It is a legacy that the Democratic 
party are very, very proud of, and all of 
us band together at a moment’s notice 
to protect it when it is threatened by 
those who think ill of it. 
Those instances have not been few or 
far between. There was the time in the 
early 2000s when there was this push to 
privatize Social Security. Instead of 
paying into the system and having it 
protected, no. The idea was just give 
the money to the people so they could 
invest it in the stock market. Let’s 
throw the money in the stock market. 
It was amazing that that was some-
thing that was brought up around 2004, 
2005, in that timeframe. What happened 
in 2008? The stock market cratered. If 
people had put their Social Security in-
vestments into the stock market, they 
would have been destitute. 
That is what happens when you so- 
called privatize Social Security. The 
people that want to push that are the 
ones that want to push the stock mar-
ket up for their own particular per-
sonal gain. 
But what it does at the same time is 
that it endangers and puts at risk the 
lifetime of earnings that people have 
put into Social Security to make their 
own retirements safe. We can’t do that. 
What else? They came up with this 
wonderful concept, you know. The 
chairman talked about the COLA, the 
cost-of-living adjustments, that come 
with Social Security. 
Certainly, they haven’t been any-
thing to brag about over the years, but 
as meager and as minimal as they have 
been, something came up about 10 
years ago called change CPI. 
Now, that was a $50 economist’s ex-
pression that meant lower cost of liv-
ing increases for seniors. That is what 
they wanted—lower cost-of-living in-
creases than what you were already 
getting on Social Security. 
We stood foursquare, shoulder to 
shoulder, against that ridiculous provi-
sion, and we put an end to that kind of 
talk. 
What else? They wanted to raise the 
retirement 
age. 
They 
always 
talk 
about that. The right-wingers want to 
raise the retirement age. How fair is 
that, raising the retirement age for 
people who have been lifting and car-
rying and climbing and working with 
their hands and putting their backs 
into their work, a whole lifetime? 
You want to make them work into 
their 70s? Is that what we think Social 
Security is for? Is that what we think 
it is all about? Absolutely not. Demo-
crats have stood foursquare and shoul-
der to shoulder against that, raising 
the retirement age. 
But it gets better. As the chairman 
mentioned, there are enemies to Social 
Security, and, you know, a lot of times 
they don’t say it out loud. 
They would like to get rid of Social 
Security. They would like to privatize 
it. They would like to cut back on the 
benefits. They wring their hands about 
how much it costs, while all the time 
ignoring all of the people that it saves 
and keeps out of poverty and away 
from starvation. No, no. They ignore 
all of that. They would like to do away 
with it. 
You know what? Just recently, these 
people came out from the shadows and 
identified themselves. In fact, there is 
a Senator by the name of RICK SCOTT 
from Florida who has said out loud 
that he wants Federal legislation, in-
cluding Social Security and Medicare, 
to sunset every 5 years and have to be 
reauthorized by a fresh vote. 
Sunset. Now, that is a euphemism for 
end. It is a euphemism for killing. It is 
a euphemism for doing away with one 
of the most successful programs in 
American legislation history. Sunset 
Social Security means do away with it, 
and that is all they are talking about. 
They have the temerity now to say 
out loud what many of them have been 
thinking in private: Let’s get rid of So-
cial Security. I say, enough. Enough of 
this detraction from Social Security, 
this wonderful program. 
I say, let’s listen to Chairman LAR-
SON. 
Let’s 
make 
Social 
Security 
stronger. Let’s make it better. Let’s 
make it more realistic for the benefits 
that it pays out. Let’s raise the bene-
fits by 2 percent. Let’s make it strong-
er so it is going to last longer. 
We haven’t touched this program for 
generation after generation. Now is the 
time to enact Social Security 2100 to 
protect our seniors and this wonderful,

enormously successful insurance pro-
gram for all Americans; people who re-
tire, people who are disabled. 
This is a program that we must 
honor and respect and raise up, and we 
can accomplish this through this won-
derful bill authored by my friend, JOHN 
LARSON of Connecticut, Social Security 
2100. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. I thank 
the gentleman, but it actually is au-
thored by 206 Members of the United 
States Congress, and I appreciate all 
the work that has been done. 
The gentleman was correct. This is 
the number one antipoverty program 
for the elderly. It is also the number 
one antipoverty program for children. 
It is also the program that more vet-
erans use for disability than any, even 
the VA. It is the most efficient and ef-
fective government program in terms 
of cost. 
They operate in insurance language 
at what is called a 99 percent loss ratio 
which means this: It costs less than 1 
percent administrative costs to dis-
tribute the greatest insurance pro-
gram. The greatest antipoverty pro-
gram for the elderly, for children, and 
for veterans is all done by Social Secu-
rity. That is why we need to expand it. 
On the Committee on Ways and 
Means, Chairman NEAL had a Racial 
Equity Committee that our colleagues 
all participated in, and one of the shin-
ing stars of that was none other than 
STACEY PLASKETT from the Virgin Is-
lands, who understands that if we want 
to focus on what John Lewis called the 
next great challenge for civil rights, it 
was to recognize how Social Security 
has treated women and specifically 
women of color and Black males. 
I recognize STACEY PLASKETT from 
the Virgin Islands. 
Ms. PLASKETT. I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding time. 
It is so good to be here with you, to 
have this discussion about Social Secu-
rity, the importance of this safety net 
to so many Americans, individuals 
throughout this country, but especially 
those who need it most. 
I’m going to give you some numbers. 
We have 17,036 retirees; 1,331 children; 
spouses, 
widows, 
disabled 
workers. 
Those are the people in my district, in 
the U.S. Virgin Islands, who receive 
Social Security benefits—almost 20 
percent of our population. 
On average, these individuals receive 
$1,230 per month in benefits. That 
doesn’t seem like a lot to so many 
Americans. 
Yet, for many recipients, they are de-
pendent on those Social Security bene-
fits to survive. Social Security pay-
ments put food on the table, keep roofs 
overhead, furnish medication. 
Indeed, for about half of senior bene-
ficiaries, Social Security provides the 
majority of their income. 
Social Security is even more impor-
tant, 
as 
you 
have 
stated, 
for 
marginalized 
communities, 
particu-
larly women and Black Americans. 
Without Social Security, 43 percent of 
older women would be living in pov-
erty. 
In 2014, 45 percent of all Black senior 
beneficiaries relied on Social Security 
for all or nearly all of their income. 
Even in light of these details, we all 
know the Social Security system today 
is inadequate. The American people 
know it, my constituents know it, and 
I suspect my colleagues across the aisle 
are very much aware of that. 
But I am grateful for you, Congress-
man LARSON, Members of the Demo-
cratic party, and, in particular, my col-
leagues on the Ways and Means Com-
mittee who are exerting leadership, 
who are deciding to step out and do 
something about it. 
We are not waiting around for the 
perfect. We are going to do some good. 
Benefits are insufficient. The Social 
Security trust fund will start running 
dry in 2035. That may be around the 
time that I need it, so we better get 
working on this. Waiting periods are 
unnecessarily long. It is long past time 
that we act to repair Social Security. 
So many things in this House we just 
take for granted that we are going to 
work on, we are going to fix, whether it 
is 
roads, 
infrastructure. 
My 
gosh. 
Those are the things that oftentimes it 
is easy for all of us to get behind, but 
how do we not get behind our elders? 
How do we not get behind those dis-
abled workers, widows? 
Many of my colleagues want to quote 
the Bible. If they are concerned with 
the widows, if they are concerned with 
those that are elders, they should be 
concerned with Social Security. 
I am proud when I was approached by 
you, Mr. LARSON, to act as a co-sponsor 
of this legislation, H.R. 5723, Social Se-
curity 2100, a sacred trust. 
This legislation would increase bene-
fits for all Social Security bene-
ficiaries. It improves the cost-of-living 
adjustment, the COLA, to reflect infla-
tion. 
My colleagues across the aisle want 
to talk about inflation all the time, 
but when we try to give them measures 
to combat it, there is nothing they 
want to do. They vote ‘‘no’’ each and 
every time. 
I can almost expect that when we get 
to committee, and we are going to 
mark this up as a means to deal with 
inflation for our elders, they are going 
to say ‘‘no’’ to it as well. 
It enhances benefits for widows and 
widowers, repeals provisions that pe-
nalize public servants, and ensures that 
no one retires in poverty. 
b 1500 
H.R. 5723 promotes fairness in our So-
cial Security system. It provides a tax 
cut for middle-income beneficiaries by 
raising taxation thresholds, while also 
ensuring millionaires and billionaires 
pay their fair share by applying the So-
cial Security payroll tax to income 
above $400,000. 
Finally, this legislation makes prac-
tical improvements to Social Security 
services to reduce access barriers. It 
ends the 5-month waiting period to re-
ceive benefits, enhances access to legal 
assistance, and prevents unwarranted 
closures of SSA field offices. 
By increasing benefits, promoting 
fairness, and improving access, Demo-
crats are improving Social Security so 
it will not only help beneficiaries 
today, but will also help future bene-
ficiaries by extending the trust fund’s 
lifespan. 
This legislation may not solve every 
problem in our Social Security system 
and may not include provisions that 
every Member desires, but it will make 
a tangible, positive impact on the lives 
of nearly 70 million Americans. 
I know that on the other side we hear 
things such as an 11-point plan to res-
cue America, and among other things 
the plan calls for Federal legislation to 
sunset after 5 years so Congress would 
need to reapprove it. We see them dis-
cussing 20 percent across-the-board 
cuts to Social Security. We say ‘‘no’’ to 
that. We want to support our elders, 
support the system, give a helping 
hand, fight inflation. 
As 
President 
Franklin 
Roosevelt 
stated in 1935 when he signed the So-
cial Security Act into law, ‘‘This law, 
too, represents a cornerstone in a 
structure which is being built, but is 
by no means complete. . . . It is, in 
short, a law that will take care of 
human needs and at the same time pro-
vide the United States an economic 
structure of vastly greater soundness.’’ 
I urge the House to lay another cor-
nerstone in this unfinished structure 
by passing H.R. 5723. Our moral char-
acter as a nation is determined not by 
how we treat corporations and billion-
aires and the powerful but, rather, how 
we treat the most vulnerable among 
us: Hardworking seniors who have 
earned a peaceful retirement; people 
with disabilities who need support; vet-
erans who courageously defended their 
country; widows; and children who 
have lost a loved one. 
They are not asking for a handout or 
a free ride. Rather, they have worked 
hard to support their families and their 
countries and have paid into the Social 
Security system. Now they are simply 
asking their government to maintain 
the promise of Social Security and ex-
tend a helping hand during hard times. 
I thank my colleagues for the work 
that has been done to bring this to the 
floor. I also thank our tremendous 
staff, who have done so much of the 
yeoman’s work in bringing informa-
tion, making sure that we are doing 
the right thing with the numbers, that 
this is something that is sustainable 
and is going to support not just those 
people who are receiving the benefits, 
but there is a benefit to all Americans 
by us doing this in the long run. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
her comments, and especially as it re-
lates to staff, also for her comments 
about this is the cornerstone, a key 
ground-laying 
cornerstone 
of 
the 
human infrastructure.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6906 
July 20, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much 
time we have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 32 minutes remaining. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL), the distin-
guished 
vice 
chair 
of 
the 
Sub-
committee on Social Security, the 
leader in Congress on making sure that 
firefighters and police officers and 
teachers are taken care of across the 
board, but specifically as it relates to 
Social Security and WEP and GPO, to 
be followed by the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL). 
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of the more than 
124,000 of our neighbors in the 9th Con-
gressional District who rely on Social 
Security each and every month. 
I rise also, Mr. Speaker, because 26 
years ago, when I first ran for Congress 
against an incumbent, I was fighting 
for Social Security because it was an 
issue in that election of 1996, when you 
had choices. 
Choices. Privatize, and that is the 
way to get to the goal line, and senior 
housing, senior development, one after 
the other. The first thing I heard when 
I walked in the door when I was cam-
paigning in the first congressional 
campaign of my life was, ‘‘What are 
you going to do about Social Secu-
rity?’’ 
The number of 124,000 is growing in 
every State every single day. It is not 
getting smaller. We have more of an 
older community in the United States 
of America. I am proud to have been 
part of that community for a few 
years. We will leave it at that. 
Social Security is one of our Nation’s 
greatest success stories, and after 86 
years, Social Security still stands as a 
monument for decency, dignity, and 
hardworking Americans. We talk about 
them a lot. We talk about the middle 
class. We talk about the poor. That is 
what we do, we talk a lot about it. 
Yet throughout that storied history, 
Social Security has been under attack. 
Going back to 1935 and FDR, from day 
one it has been the subject of scur-
rilous attacks and lies. Those lies con-
tinue to this day. It has taken its toll. 
Social Security is no grab-bag give-
away, but benefits that you have 
earned, you paid into with your own 
sweat and toil. Without aggressive ac-
tion, it teeters toward insolvency. 
Congress has a sacred responsibility 
to protect Social Security for today’s 
seniors and for tomorrow’s: their kids, 
their grandkids. 
I am proud to stand here with my 
very good friend, Representative JOHN 
LARSON, as a strong supporter of his 
Social Security 2100 Act. This historic 
bill will ensure the strength and sol-
vency of Social Security for today’s 
seniors. 
The Social Security 2100 Act provides 
fully paid-for benefit enhancements, 
not cuts in benefits. Oh, please notice 
who is advocating for those cuts. Not 
just seniors; those to-be-seniors and 
their kids and grandkids. It keeps 
President Biden’s promise to not raise 
taxes on middle-class families. This is 
a no-brainer. 
Among its many improvements, this 
bill eliminates the unnecessary 5- 
month disability benefits waiting pe-
riod. That, coupled with the inad-
equacy of our postal officials, is enough 
to do away with the seniors, I will tell 
you that. I hope that is not the plan. 
Additionally, it will ensure Ameri-
cans suffering with terminal and de-
bilitating disorders like Huntington’s 
disease get the help they need without 
red tape or delay. 
Importantly, we have updated the 
legislation so that our firefighters, po-
lice, teachers, and other public serv-
ants—we are always putting our arms 
around them—will now receive the full 
Social Security benefits that they have 
earned. 
Social Security lifts more Americans 
out of poverty than any other Federal 
program. 21 million each year. For over 
40 percent of senior beneficiaries, it 
provides a majority of their income. 
Their lives literally depend on it. That 
is not an exaggeration, Mr. Speaker. 
That is the importance of Social Secu-
rity to America. 
We are fighting for our seniors who 
have worked their entire lives, and we 
are fighting for working families so 
that no one who pays their whole lives 
should ever retire in poverty. That is a 
scourge. 
With unified control of government, 
we must get this done. There are no ex-
cuses. Congratulations to the com-
mittee and its chairman to get us this 
far. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. I thank 
the gentleman from New Jersey for his 
unwavering support and dedication not 
only to the firefighters, police, and 
teachers across this country who will 
benefit from this legislation, but all 
Americans, and especially those in 
Paterson, New Jersey, who he has dedi-
cated his life to serving. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield now to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
LOIS 
FRANKEL), a woman who understands 
the significance of Social Security, 
hailing from the State of Florida, 
which is probably the senior center 
capital of the world in terms of the 
population there of senior citizens. 
Before yielding to the gentlewoman, 
I recognize the number of committees 
that have come out in support of this 
legislation, 
including 
the 
National 
Committee to Preserve Social Security 
and Medicare, Social Security Works, 
the NAACP, the National Organization 
of Women, the Latinos for a Secure Re-
tirement, the National Education Asso-
ciation, the AFT, and more than 350 or-
ganizations have come and endorsed 
the work of LOIS FRANKEL, who under-
stands what seniors need not only in 
Florida but across this Nation. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. 
LARSON, for spearheading this fight to 
keep Social Security secure. 
It is hard to believe that Republicans 
actually want to stop the program in 5 
years so they can reassess. I tell you, 
that is big trouble. It is big trouble if 
they do that for the millions and mil-
lions of Americans who depend on So-
cial Security; 4.5 million, Mr. LARSON 
who live in the State of Florida. 
Our workers spend their lives work-
ing hard for these benefits, and so don’t 
they deserve when they retire to make 
sure that they have enough money to 
see that their bills are paid? That is 
why the Social Security 2100 Act is so 
important. 
It is going to improve a needed bump 
to the cost of living. It is going to pro-
vide a special benefit for low-wage 
earners, 
folks 
like 
waitresses 
and 
custodians, nurses’ aides, people who 
are important to our economy. 
This is a big deal. It is a big deal, es-
pecially for the retirees who depend on 
Social Security to cover their everyday 
expenses. Just ask Alice from my 
hometown, who was a housekeeper her 
entire life. She worked 40 hours a week 
until she turned 65. She is earning $923 
a month on Social Security. Her rent 
just increased to a whopping $855 a 
month. That is not sustainable. That is 
not right. That is not what America is 
about. No one who has worked hard 
their entire life should retire into pov-
erty. 
I am proud to join my colleagues, 
overwhelming support from Democrats 
for the Social Security 2100 Act. It has 
got the updates we need to keep this 
critical program working now and for 
the future. 
Let me just say, the timing of this 
bill could not be more urgent. 
b 1515 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Florida for her comments. 
Every now and again, we find leaders 
in the country who may come from the 
House but all of a sudden take on na-
tional prominence. Why is that? Be-
cause they speak straightforwardly to 
the people, in the case of TIM RYAN, in 
Ohio, but they are really speaking to 
the entire Nation. 
What are they talking about? The 
more than 10,000 baby boomers a day 
who become eligible for Social Secu-
rity and the individuals who have 
worked all of their lives and paid into 
a program and receive below-poverty- 
level checks from their government, 
and also a pay-for in this program that 
has the wealthiest people paying their 
fair share simply by lifting the cap on 
people making over $400,000. That is 
four-tenths of 1 percent of the Amer-
ican public. Even with that, they will 
be paying proportionately less than a 
person earning $35,000 to $50,000 a year. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. RYAN), the next Sen-
ator from the State of Ohio, the person 
who speaks to that working class, and 
it resonates not only in Ohio but across 
this great Nation of ours. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding, and I appre-
ciate the opportunity to speak here.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6907 
July 20, 2022 
I just want to say, I have been in 
Congress now 20 years, and I have 
known Mr. LARSON for that long. He 
has been an absolute bulldog on this 
issue. I think he understands better 
than most the impact of this program, 
just consistently, year in and year out, 
getting this on the radar screen. Now, 
we are going to have a markup next 
week on this, really proposing this at a 
time of great need. 
The pandemic that we all have expe-
rienced over the last few years, and the 
global economic collapse that we saw 
in the last couple of years, I think 
pulled the veil back on a lot of prob-
lems that we have had in this country. 
We could go through the entire list, 
but I think one of them that is most 
significant is how many people in this 
country, how many seniors in this 
country, struggle to make ends meet, 
in the wealthiest country on God’s 
green Earth, the most significant, most 
dynamic economy. 
We have a handful of people building 
their own space stations, going into 
space, and, God bless, that can only 
happen in America. But the reality is 
that the vast majority of people in this 
country are still struggling. 
What we are talking about here is a 
group of people who did everything 
right, busted their rear ends their 
whole life—single moms taking care of 
a couple of kids, people working in fac-
tories, people waitressing, nurses, pub-
lic servants, people who are out there 
every single day and have done every-
thing right. 
This is what the Social Security sys-
tem is all about. I remember when my 
grandparents passed away. I remember 
going through their drawers at their 
house. You have to clean up every-
thing, and it is really a heartbreaking 
experience. 
I found this little black book that 
was my great-grandfather’s, Dominic 
Guerra. He came over from Italy with 
17 bucks in his pocket. It was his little 
black book. I opened it up, and on the 
left side, it had the names of the people 
who belonged to this group that was 
called the Valsinni Club. He came from 
a little village in Italy, Valsinni, in the 
southern part, in the Basilicata region. 
It was the Valsinni Club. 
On the left-hand side were all the 
names of the Italians from Valsinni in 
Niles, Ohio. At the top of the book 
were the months of the year. So, it 
would say Dominic Guerra and all of 
these names—a lot of vowels in this 
book. It would say January, $1; Feb-
ruary, $1; March, nothing; April, noth-
ing; May, nothing; June, $1. It was the 
same for all the different names that 
were there. 
It was a mutual aid book. It was in-
surance. It was just a group of people 
kind of putting their own insurance 
plan together because, one day, I am up 
and you are down, and the next day, I 
am down and you are up. That was be-
fore Social Security and before Medi-
care, people coming together, collec-
tively, to help each other, which is a 
basic American value. 
This system was put in place because 
that was probably happening all across 
the 
country 
with 
different 
ethnic 
groups. Franklin Roosevelt and others 
said, hey, we better do something 
about this and collectively come to-
gether. That is what this is about. This 
is an earned benefit. 
I will tell you that the American 
value that undergirds this program is 
the same American value that has lit 
this country up since its inception. It 
is the idea and the value of freedom. 
Freedom has been the principle here in 
the United States. 
We are talking about economic free-
dom here. We talk about it with the 
workforce. We talk about it with re-
building the middle class. Why? So peo-
ple can be free. Economic freedom— 
don’t have to work 50 or 60 hours a 
week. You have time for the things 
that are important. You have a few 
extra bucks to take your kids to the 
college football game or, if you are 
into 
self-flagellation, 
a 
Cleveland 
Browns game, or go fishing, go hunt-
ing, or have a little boat. Economic 
freedom. 
When we are talking about our sen-
iors, we are talking about freedom, 
economic freedom for them to live 
independent lives. Seniors don’t want 
to be a burden on their kids. They 
don’t want to be a burden on their 
grandkids. 
What Mr. LARSON and what the So-
cial Security 2100 Act are saying is, 
how do we lift everybody up, put a few 
more bucks in people’s pockets who 
have done everything right, making 
sure people aren’t living in poverty, 
making sure they are independent, 
that they can take care of themselves? 
That is what this bill does. It asks peo-
ple making over $400,000 a year to help 
make that happen. 
I think this is a significant piece of 
legislation. I think this program is the 
backbone of the working class. 
I will tell you something else. This 
program is the backbone of rural 
America, where so many jobs have been 
lost. It is the backbone of these factory 
towns that have seen so much loss. You 
have issues around addiction, overdose, 
fentanyl. 
And 
grandparents 
raising 
grandkids, it couldn’t happen without 
Social Security. 
The one significant provision in here 
is to say if a husband and wife are both 
relying on Social Security and one 
dies, they are going to get at least 75 
percent of the total of both recipients. 
That is a significant step because we 
hear so often of a spouse dying and 
then, all of a sudden, there isn’t eco-
nomic independence anymore, there 
isn’t freedom anymore, there isn’t the 
ability to take care of yourself. 
I am here today to say this is a phe-
nomenal thing. I think when most 
Americans—Democrat, Republican, and 
Independent—hear about this, there is 
going to be and continue to be signifi-
cant support for these reforms. 
I hope this bill gets marked up. I 
hope it comes to this floor for a vote. 
I hope the Senate agrees, and I hope we 
pass it and reform it. Then, we are 
going to lift up millions of people, mil-
lions of seniors, in this country. We 
have JOHN LARSON to thank for that. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Ohio for his remarks. I am so proud he 
is going to be going to the United 
States Senate because, in the United 
States Senate, Mr. SCOTT from Florida 
has proposed ending Social Security in 
5 years. Ohio needs to make sure that 
it is sending someone to the United 
States Senate who is not going to end 
Social Security in 5 years but is going 
to expand Social Security now, when 
we need it, when we are in the worst 
pandemic in the history of the country, 
when we are suffering through infla-
tion. The time to act is now. 
As Martin Luther King would say, it 
is the fierce urgency of now. It has 
been 51 years since Congress has done 
anything. 
That is something that TED LIEU of 
California understands and has been 
working tirelessly, as an original co-
sponsor of this bill, to reach out not 
only to the citizens of California but 
all across this country to make sure 
that they are going to have the bene-
fits that can sustain them. Our goal is 
to expand benefits, not cut them. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LIEU). 
Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman LARSON for yielding. 
Democrats are focused on putting 
people over politics by lowering costs, 
increasing American jobs, and having 
safe communities. 
What are Republicans focused on? 
Ending Social Security. How do we 
know that? They put it in writing. 
They want to end Social Security in 5 
years. 
We need to not only end the Repub-
licans’ ability to end Social Security; 
we need to expand Social Security. 
That is why I am so proud to be here to 
support JOHN LARSON’s Social Security 
2100: A Sacred Trust. 
In my district alone, there are nearly 
120,000 Social Security recipients who 
receive an average, in total, of $209 mil-
lion of monthly benefits. This is a 
vital, critical program, lifesaving for 
millions of Americans. 
Why is it called a sacred trust? It is 
called a sacred trust because our gov-
ernment promised, over 85 years ago, 
that if you contribute to Social Secu-
rity with each and every paycheck, you 
can retire with dignity. President 
Biden has called that a sacred trust. 
Chairman LARSON’s sacred trust bill is 
how we need to make Social Security 
stronger and even better. 
I think it is important to talk about 
how awesome this bill is. Let me talk 
to you about some of the provisions. 
It has a benefit bump for current and 
new Social Security beneficiaries of 2 
percent. In addition, it has protection 
against inflation, and it does that by 
improving the outdated COLA formula 
that currently is in Social Security.

The bill also improves Social Secu-
rity benefits for widows and widowers. 
This bill repeals the windfall elimi-
nation provision. It ends the 5-month 
waiting period to receive disability 
benefits. 
The bill also provides caregiver cred-
its toward Social Security. It extends 
Social Security dependent benefits. It 
increases access to Social Security de-
pendent benefits for children who live 
with grandparents or other relatives. 
The bill also requires the Social Se-
curity agency to mail annual state-
ments to all workers, and it improves 
access to legal representation for peo-
ple seeking long-term disability bene-
fits. 
This is an awesome bill. This is ex-
actly the kind of legislation that we 
need to move off the floor, and it is in 
stark contrast to what Republicans are 
doing. 
Again, Republicans want to end So-
cial Security in 5 years. How do we 
know that? They put it in writing. Not 
just one Republican, but multiple Re-
publicans. 
It is a severe danger to our Nation if 
we wipe out this lifesaving program. It 
is important that we not only make 
sure that that doesn’t happen but that 
we expand Social Security, especially 
coming out of a pandemic where people 
are facing all of these challenges and 
obstacles. Folks on fixed incomes can-
not often get additional income, and 
that is why the only way to do this is 
to increase Social Security. We do that 
by passing JOHN LARSON’s Social Secu-
rity 2100: A Sacred Trust. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
California for his comments. 
I will point out that this is a bipar-
tisan plan, probably more correctly 
called nonpartisan. Why? Because Inde-
pendents, Democrats, and Republicans 
of all ages, of all backgrounds and eth-
nic groups, support Social Security be-
cause it is, as President Biden indi-
cated, a sacred trust. 
As Congressman RYAN pointed out, 
whether you are in a rural area or an 
urban area, whether you are on the 
coast or in the Great Plains of this 
country, you are impacted by Social 
Security. This is about your mother 
and father. It is about your brothers 
and sisters. 
b 1530 
It is what I call the great mirror test. 
If you can look your constituents in 
the eye—and we have provided every 
Member of Congress with a card that 
says: How many of your constituents 
receive Social Security? 
It is Congress’ responsibility. This is 
not 
something 
that 
can 
happen 
through executive order. This is not 
something that the Supreme Court is 
going to rule on. This is only some-
thing that Congress can do. 
We are blessed in the House that we 
have a great leader in NANCY PELOSI. It 
was NANCY PELOSI, back in 2005 that 
led the charge that was ‘‘Horatius at 
the bridge,’’ so to speak, to prevent the 
privatization of Social Security, and 
we were successful. 
Thank God we were, for had that plan 
succeeded, 2008 and 2009 would have 
been far more disastrous. Yet, as we all 
know, Social Security, in the midst of 
that recession, never missed a pay-
ment, not a spousal or a dependent 
payment, not a disability payment, and 
not a pension payment. 
And now it is NANCY PELOSI as well. 
Along with President Biden and Demo-
crats—and frankly, a number of Repub-
licans—who know in their hearts and 
know because when they give that mir-
ror test and go home and look at their 
family members, in the midst of this 
pandemic, in the midst of this infla-
tion, the most successful and the most 
efficiently run governmental program 
that we have should be embraced by ev-
eryone to give the access and relief 
that our seniors need, that our disabled 
veterans need, that our children con-
tinue to need. 
President Eisenhower and President 
Nixon, the last President under whom 
we expanded Social Security benefits, 
that was in 1971, and a gallon of milk 
cost 72 cents—what seniors have en-
dured. And like most, like my mother, 
would turn to their children and say: 
Don’t worry about me. I don’t want to 
be a burden. 
My mother—all mothers—were never 
a burden. They were an inspiration to 
us all. And we all owe it to them to 
make sure that they live out their lives 
in the simple dignity of knowing they 
can’t retire into poverty. That is the 
promise of Social Security. It hasn’t 
kept pace. How could it if it hasn’t 
been expanded in 51 years. 
Now its solvency is in question and 
this bill expands its solvency. And, 
most importantly, it expands the bene-
fits that are so vitally needed—espe-
cially, as Mr. PASCRELL pointed out—to 
teachers, firefighters, police officers, 
and 
municipal 
employees, 
who, 
through no fault of their own, have 
found themselves on the short end of 
Congress’ inaction. It is the fierce ur-
gency of now. 
When you go home and when you 
travel to a senior center, ask your con-
stituents—and face them eyeball to 
eyeball and say: How can I help you? 
They will respond: By fixing Social 
Security. By giving us a COLA that ac-
tually reflects the costs that we incur, 
that don’t tax us while we still work 
because we have to make ends meet, to 
make sure that we are expanding bene-
fits across the board for everyone—be-
cause it is everyone’s program—and 
make sure that the wealthy pay their 
fair share. 
That is what President Biden has 
called for. That is why it is a sacred 
trust. That is why we are proud to put 
this before us and say we are here to 
expand Social Security, not end this. 
Please, I beg of my colleagues on the 
other side, join us in expanding bene-
fits that you know need to be expanded 
on behalf of the citizens you represent. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

UNLEASH AMERICAN ENERGY 
INDEPENDENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. JOHNSON) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the mi-
nority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, the recent Supreme Court 
term has come to an end and the 
Court’s decision has sent Washington 
Democrats into a tailspin. 
Members of this body have called to 
abolish the Supreme Court—and by the 
way, some of those very same Members 
have also called to expand the Supreme 
Court, so we are not really sure which 
one they are committed to. 
Just yesterday, Members of this body 
were pretending to be handcuffed over 
their support for taxpayer-funded abor-
tion on demand until birth. Wash-
ington Democrats are making excuses 
for the outright harassment of the Su-
preme Court Justices, their families, 
their children, and even the assassina-
tion attempt on the life of Justice 
Kavanaugh. 
Washington Democrats are silent on 
attacks against pro-life pregnancy care 
centers across this country. Some have 
even called for these centers to be shut 
down all across the Nation. It is appall-
ing. It is unhinged. Why would anyone 
want to shut down pregnancy centers 
that are designed to help struggling 
mothers in their time of need? But that 
is where we are. 
Why all the hysterics though? My 
constituents are really curious about 
this. Why are they so animated right 
now? Why do they want to tear this in-
stitution to the ground? 
Well, here is the simple reason, be-
cause the Supreme Court has made 
some very thoughtful constitutionally 
based decisions in this term. 
They correctly said, for example, 
that a football coach was exercising his 
First Amendment rights when he pri-
vately prayed on the 50-yard line. 
The Supreme Court correctly said 
that citizens don’t have to ask the gov-
ernment for permission to exercise 
their fundamental rights to keep and 
bear arms. 
The Supreme Court correctly said 
that if Congress wants to address cli-
mate change, then Congress has to leg-
islate on that issue instead of just out-
sourcing that work to unelected bu-
reaucrats.

Because the Supreme Court correctly 
said that elected Representatives of 
the people may again be allowed to 
place restrictions on the killing of in-
nocent unborn children. 
That is why they are motivated. That 
is why they are so unhinged. That is 
why they want to tear the institution 
to the ground. 
I guess we shouldn’t be surprised by 
all of this. We are, after all, only a cou-
ple of months removed from Senator 
SCHUMER’s infamous, dangerous, un-
hinged rant on the steps of the Su-
preme Court itself. He called out Jus-
tices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh by name, 
and he said, Hey, we are going to re-
lease the whirlwind on you. 
Well, it happened. And it is clear 
what is happening here. Democrats are 
doing anything and everything they 
can to try to use these obvious and 
straightforward Supreme Court deci-
sions to stoke fear and change the sub-
ject before the November election. 
But we are here today to say that 
this election will be about three things. 
It is going to be primarily about soar-
ing inflation, uninhibited illegal immi-
gration, and the general staggering in-
competence that we see by the Demo-
crats in charge of Washington. 
The three I’s. I call it: Inflation. Im-
migration. Incompetence. 
I think that summarizes it very well. 
There was a very interesting story on 
CNN this week that caught my eye. It 
was entitled, ‘‘Vulnerable Democrats 
Sound the Alarm Over Inflation Cri-
sis.’’ Well, welcome to the party. It is 
a little late for that. 
I would humbly suggest that those 
vulnerable 
Democrats 
should 
have 
thought about that before they voted 
to pass $5.4 trillion—with a ‘‘T’’—in 
new partisan spending last year. 
We warned them. This was so com-
pletely foreseeable. Government spend-
ing is what is causing the current infla-
tion crisis, plain and simple. And now 
that this bill is coming due, these vul-
nerable Democrats are hoping the 
American people would simply forget 
their vote. We don’t intend to let that 
happen, the stakes are too high, and 
the issues are too important. 
I thank my colleagues for joining us 
today to discuss the harm that the 
Democrat agenda has caused our coun-
try and our alternative, conservative 
vision for how to fix all this. 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. MEUSER), first among my many 
colleagues that will be joining me here 
in the hour, who knows a whole lot 
about the economy. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Louisiana, my 
very good friend, for offering this op-
portunity to speak on these important 
issues. 
Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago this week, 
President Biden stood before the Amer-
ican people and said that inflation was 
temporary. At that point, the Con-
sumer Price Index, which measures in-
flation, of course, stood at 5.4 percent. 
In the 365 days since, the price of 
nearly everything has increased, and 
the Consumer Price Index has sky-
rocketed at 9.1 percent. 
Eggs are up 33 percent; milk is up 16 
percent; chicken is up 18 percent; and 
worst of all, Americans are paying over 
60 percent more for gasoline than they 
were a year ago, costing American fam-
ilies, my constituents, and everyone 
throughout our country, nearly $6,000 
extra a year. Now we have our Trans-
portation Secretary telling us the 
truth, 
that 
this 
pain—and 
I’m 
quoting—will lead to more purchases of 
electric cars. 
So that was the plan. Thanks for 
being honest, Mr. Secretary. 
Meanwhile, however, neither the ad-
ministration nor the Secretary of 
Transportation has any understanding 
of where the energy comes from to 
charge all of these electric cars. 
They are not exactly chess players, 
Mr. Speaker. 
As my friend from Louisiana put it, 
inflation, incompetence—the third ‘‘I’’? 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Immi-
gration. 
Mr. MEUSER: Immigration. And in-
stead of taking any action to correct 
this devastating problem, and the ef-
fect it is having on American families 
and small businesses, large businesses, 
you name it—dogs and cats, probably— 
the Biden administration has doubled 
down on the backwards policies and un-
dertaken a massive blame-game cam-
paign. 
Not exactly a profile in courage tak-
ing place here, Mr. Speaker. 
First, they branded the inflation 
brought on by their reckless spending 
the ‘‘Putin price hike.’’ Then, despite 
inflation beginning long before the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine, by the 
way, then the administration laid the 
blame for their policies at the feet of 
greedy corporations—yeah—and then 
local gas station owners. 
Mr. Speaker, 60 percent of the gas 
stations throughout our country, and 
certainly in my district, are owned by 
small 
independent 
businesspeople. 
They are to blame for the gasoline 
prices that we are paying? 
I would like to reiterate, when faced 
with the highest gas prices in history 
caused by atrocious energy policies, 
the President of the United States and 
many Democrat Members of this House 
point their fingers and blame small 
business owners. 
The American people are not fooled 
by the Biden administration’s finger- 
pointing, though they are paying a 
steep price for it. Despite the adminis-
tration’s best efforts to deceive the 
American people, we have learned that 
inflation was not temporary and has 
continued to skyrocket, largely be-
cause of the Biden House Democrats’ 
out-of-control spending. 
Instead of addressing America’s infla-
tion crisis, House Democrats have con-
tinued to push for billions more in gov-
ernment spending, which will increase 
inflation, it will not decrease it. Con-
tinued excessive spending will increase 
inflation. It is a mathematical and 
physical certainty. 
We must correct course. Stop the 
reckless spending and unleash domestic 
American energy production, which 
will strengthen both our economy and 
our national security. We must also 
stop overregulating and overtaxing 
small businesses, and enough with the 
blame games and these go woke and 
broke policies. They have failed the 
American people. 
Mr. Speaker, the free nations of the 
world need a strong United States, 
both militarily and economically to 
lead. We face serious threats. Free na-
tions worldwide know that the world is 
a far more peaceful and stable place 
with strong American leadership. The 
weakness shown both at our southern 
border and the Ukraine border, ini-
tially, have had devastating effects on 
humanity and on the stability of the 
United States, Europe, and the free 
world. 
Only with a clear vision, realistic 
plan, and earnest execution will this be 
corrected. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. That is 
so well said, my friend. And it is so 
true that a strong and vibrant America 
is good not only for the people in this 
country but for people all around the 
world. We maintain peace through 
strength, and if we don’t show that 
strength, then we are in real jeopardy. 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
BABIN), my good friend from right over 
the border. 
b 1545 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Louisiana. I appreciate Mr. 
JOHNSON for having this Special Order. 
Mr. Speaker, according to a recent 
New York Times poll, more than 77 
percent of Americans think that the 
country is on the absolutely wrong 
track—and they are right. 
Inflation is at a 41-year high. Small 
businesses cannot afford to stay open. 
Real wages are down 4 percent. Sky-
rocketing prices are costing Americans 
an extra $500 or more per month. Es-
sentially, hardworking Americans are 
paying more for almost everything 
while they are taking home less. Why? 
Well, the answer is simple. Joe Biden 
and the Democrat party have put poli-
tics over your prosperity. Think about 
that. Over the last year and a half they 
have repeatedly shown us that their 
green fantasy is more important than 
you being able to feed your family or 
fill up your car with gasoline. 
The administration says that we are 
in an ‘‘economic transition moment.’’ 
Yes, this inflation was supposed to be 
temporary and transitory, according to 
the administration, but prices have 
risen for 14 straight months since that 
announcement was made. You don’t 
need to be an economist to agree. 
We are undoubtedly in a state of 
transition. The real question is: What 
are we transitioning into?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6910 
July 20, 2022 
My colleagues across the aisle avoid 
this question at all costs because the 
facts just don’t back up their fictitious 
answers. Let me tell you the truth. 
You don’t need to like Donald Trump 
to accept the fact that our economy 
prospered under his leadership. You 
don’t need to be a Republican to accept 
the fact that our Nation flourished 
under free-market, small-government 
policies—policies that allowed Ameri-
cans to thrive without Big Brother in-
terference. 
You don’t need to be in politics to ac-
cept the fact that our country has been 
in a perpetual state of crisis under 
President Joe Biden. Our economy is 
plummeting, our southern border is 
nonexistent, our military is shrinking, 
and our standing on the world stage is 
in rapid decline. 
So, to answer the question of what 
we are transitioning into? 
Well, under the left’s woke agenda, 
America will transform into a broke, 
borderless, weak, socialist Nation un-
able to compete internationally or de-
feat those who seek our very demise. It 
is a very frightening future, and one 
that we as the GOP cannot let come to 
fruition. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend. It is a very 
stark reality that we face, but we are 
optimists. We know we can turn this 
around, and the American people are 
going to give us a chance this fall, 
aren’t they? I thank the gentleman for 
that good word and stark reminder. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
the Democrat majority is COVID crazy, 
it is January 6 forever, January 6 
crazy, climate crazy, everything is rac-
ist, everything is seen through a 
transgender lens. Then there are their 
policies. Their policies that are wreak-
ing harm on the American people, and 
that the American people don’t want. 
They have done so much harm to the 
country in the last year and half as 
they have had the majority, along with 
the White House. It is hard to put your 
finger upon what is the worst thing 
that has happened to the country. Is it 
the rapidly rising violent crime? 
The undermining of our police? 
Putting criminals ahead of victims? 
Putting criminals ahead of police? 
And just now figuring out that if you 
cut police, if you defund police, if you 
don’t support police, then, of course, 
you get more crime. 
Is it what they are doing to our mili-
tary, wokeifying, wussifying our mili-
tary with these radical policies. These 
diversity equity inclusion policies that 
think our military is a social experi-
ment. Kicking out military members 
because they don’t get a vaccine. We 
got 100,000 troops that are at risk of 
being dismissed from the military 
when we are at 40 percent of our re-
cruiting goals. 
Is it what we are doing at the border? 
Gosh, we could go on and on about 
the border, once again. 
Is that the worst crisis that the 
Democrats have created with their 
policies? 
What this President had to do to 
keep a secure border was nothing. Con-
tinue the policies of the previous ad-
ministration and we would have a se-
cure border. Instead, we have allowed 
some 4 million—now averaging about 
10,000 a day—illegal aliens crossing 
into our country. Over 3 million—ac-
knowledged by border patrol—encoun-
tered at the border, most of them re-
leased into the interior of the country, 
and then some 800,000 criminal got- 
aways, the ones who, you know, don’t 
want to be taken into our custody, 
don’t want to be given free healthcare, 
don’t want to be given free education, 
free social services, free transportation 
wherever they want to go, without a 
quarter to appear. 
The ones who are evading capture be-
cause they are trafficking drugs, hu-
mans, sex trafficking, child trafficking 
across our border. The ones with ter-
rorist ties and criminal ties who will 
do irreparable harm in the days, weeks, 
and months ahead. 
Then you look at the energy policy, 
which is driving—along with the rapid 
spending—it is driving the inflation in 
this country. Energy policy. What did 
we need to do when this President took 
over a year and a half ago to remain 
energy independent for the first time 
in history? 
Nothing. Continue the policies. But 
this President, during the campaign, 
promised to declare war on fossil fuels 
to end American energy essentially— 
oil and gas production in this country. 
That is a promise that he has kept in 
the way that he has willfully put regu-
latory burdens, restrictions on the en-
ergy industry. 
Now he goes essentially with a big 
gas can, carrying it over to the Middle 
East, begging these other world pro-
ducers—who don’t produce energy as 
cleanly as we do—to produce more en-
ergy to try to bail him out of his failed 
policies. 
Meanwhile, what do we have? 
His transportation secretary, who 
has no experience in transportation, by 
the way, says: Hey, the more pain that 
we can cause, the more benefit. The 
more pain we can cause with rising gas 
prices, the more benefit. Memo: Most 
Americans can’t afford a $70,000 elec-
tric vehicle. 
Most Americans don’t have somebody 
driving them around in a big SUV so 
they can get out of the SUV right be-
fore the photo op and get on their bicy-
cle and just bike the last block to 
work. Most Americans don’t have that 
option. 
This administration, this Democrat 
majority is out of touch with the 
American people. They are hurting the 
country. These policies are being re-
jected. You are going to see in 111 days 
from today the representation of that— 
the demonstration of that on Novem-
ber 8. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, wow, there are so many im-
portant facts there. I will tell you 
what, it is hard to count all the crises. 
I thank my friend, that was so well 
said, as usual. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE), faithful to 
come on this floor week after week and 
relay the facts to the American people. 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the time on the floor today to speak 
about these important matters. 
Mr. Speaker, when Tennesseans go to 
the gas pump and grocery store, they 
are constantly reminded of the fact 
that everything was much more afford-
able only 1 year ago. 
Since President Biden has taken of-
fice and congressional Democrats have 
recklessly borrowed and spent trillions 
of dollars, the cost of living has sky-
rocketed at a rate not seen since 1981— 
when I was just a junior in high school. 
Common sense will tell you, this 
massive amount of deficit spending 
overheated the economy and created a 
labor shortage from folks staying home 
instead of working. Common sense will 
also tell you, that the only way to fix 
this issue is to turn the money spigots 
off here in Washington and stop this 
borrow and spend economic death spi-
ral. 
Unfortunately, common sense has 
again failed this Chamber as House 
Democrats passed earlier today a fund-
ing bill filled with partisan initiatives 
costing hundreds of billions of dollars. 
The 
socialist 
spending 
bill 
House 
Democrats 
passed 
today 
increased 
some accounts by double and even tri-
ple-digit percentages in some cases. 
It rewards the Food and Drug Admin-
istration, which failed to quickly ad-
dress the baby formula shortage with a 
budget increase. It also increases the 
budget for the Department of Home-
land Security, who instead of enforcing 
our laws and stopping illegal immigra-
tion, is encouraging it by attempting 
to repeal title 42. It even increases the 
budget to maintain and improve Fed-
eral buildings by 12 percent, even 
though many of these buildings have 
been mostly empty for the last 2 years. 
There are a lot of bad policies in this 
bill, but one of the worst has to be the 
exclusion of the Hyde amendment. The 
Hyde 
amendment 
is 
a 
bipartisan 
amendment that has existed for dec-
ades to prevent your taxpayer dollars 
from being used to help fund abortions. 
This is completely incomprehensible to 
me. In no way, shape, or form should 
taxpayers be subsidizing abortions with 
taxpayer dollars. 
Tennesseans are sick and tired of 
borrowing money from China and forc-
ing their grandchildren to foot the bill. 
The State of Tennessee should serve as 
a role model for Members of Congress. 
We have been committed in Tennessee 
to enacting fiscally responsible policies 
up and down each level of government. 
We don’t even have a State income tax, 
and yet are still able to fund the gov-
ernment without driving our State into 
a hole of debt from which we will never 
get out.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6911 
July 20, 2022 
I just can’t help but think how one- 
party rule in Washington has com-
pletely failed the American people. 
Democrats have controlled both Cham-
bers of Congress and the executive 
branch for almost 2 years now and 
Americans are paying the price. 
Tennesseans 
are 
rightfully 
upset 
with their Federal Government and 
feel as though their concerns about the 
future of this country are not being 
heard. A recent poll shows that in 
April of 2020, during the height of the 
COVID lockdowns, Americans actually 
thought our Nation’s future looked 
brighter than it does right now. 
We can’t continue down this path. We 
must do everything we can to rein-in 
the reckless spending. As interest rates 
begin to rise, our $30 trillion—and ris-
ing—national debt will only continue 
to get more expensive as the interest 
on the debt grows right along with it, 
squeezing out funding for other vital 
programs. With interest rates now ris-
ing at a rapid clip, it is all just a tick-
ing time bomb ready to go off. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to 
listen to the American people and Ten-
nesseans back home and do what is 
right for the sake of our country and 
our children. Recognize the policy fail-
ures of the last 2 years and commit to 
joining Republicans in our desire to re-
store fiscal common sense. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, there are so many great 
points there. I appreciate the gen-
tleman for coming here and explaining 
that because we can’t say it too much. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Kansas (Mr. MANN). 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman and my friend from Lou-
isiana for hosting this Special Order 
hour and for all that he is doing to get 
the conservative voice out there. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to deliver 
the 13th installment of my farm bill 
impact series during a time when the 
effects of a poor wheat harvest in Kan-
sas are only compounded by crushing 
inflation. 
This is insult added to injury for 
Kansas wheat farmers. Producers are 
laboring under the burden of sky-
rocketing input costs while they work 
hard to keep our country fed, fueled, 
and clothed, and they deserve a work-
able solution to this inflation crisis be-
fore the situation gets any worse. 
Farming is already a risky, volatile 
business without the added burden of 
inflation, and USDA estimates that 
input costs will continue to rise at as-
tronomical rates throughout 2022. 
For an example of the risk of vola-
tility—the wheat harvest just ended in 
Kansas, and the results were a fraction 
of the yield that farmers in the Wheat 
State hope for and bank on for normal 
seasons. The farm bill, which Congress 
will reauthorize in 2023, exists, in part, 
specifically for situations like this past 
wheat season—to provide emergency 
assistance to the people who feed, fuel, 
and clothe the world even when Mother 
Nature doesn’t cooperate. 
The weather in Kansas can be ex-
treme and unpredictable, which means 
that growing wheat in the Wheat State 
can be a difficult prospect at times. 
I had an intern in my office this sum-
mer named Parker Vulgamore who is a 
rising senior at Kansas State Univer-
sity where he serves as the student 
body president. He is also a member of 
the sixth generation of his family’s 
farm in Scott City, which lies in my 
district. 
Vulgamore Family Farms is a wheat, 
corn, and sorghum operation, with 
wheat being a staple. This year, due to 
an exceptional drought and extreme 
conditions throughout the growing sea-
son, much of the wheat never grew past 
3 inches tall. 
You don’t have to farm to know that 
that is not good. What is typically a 
highly anticipated 3- to 4-week wheat 
harvest only lasted a day and a half. 
Many wheat farmers in Kansas barely 
even ran their combines this year— 
they harvested what they could, cut 
their losses, and moved on. 
b 1600 
This is where farm bill emergency as-
sistance programs like crop insurance 
come in. Crop insurance serves pro-
ducers and consumers alike because it 
helps prevent producers from going out 
of business and grocery store aisles 
from sitting empty. 
Farm bill programs like crop insur-
ance have secured our national food 
supply and helped generation after gen-
eration of producers avoid bankruptcy 
when times get tough. We are in those 
times right now. 
Inflation is skyrocketing in America. 
President Biden is trying to impose his 
farm killer tax, and at the same time, 
producers are going out of business. 
The chance to reauthorize the farm bill 
for 2023 has come at a critical moment 
in time. 
The farm crisis isn’t just about 
money. It is about morale and spirit. It 
is about joy. Missing wheat harvest 
time in Kansas doesn’t just mean miss-
ing out on the yield of a cash crop. It 
means missing out on the special Kan-
sas tradition of celebrating the cul-
mination of all your family’s hard 
work. It means missing out on grand-
ma’s casserole in the harvest field and 
missing out on seeing your mom in the 
semi, your dad on the combine, and 
your little brother getting to drive the 
grain cart for the first time. 
A bad wheat harvest in Kansas 
doesn’t just create financial insecurity. 
It also leaves a void where a renewal of 
family camaraderie should be. 
American agricultural producers are 
hurting 
not 
only 
from 
the 
sky-
rocketing input costs that come with 
inflation but also from the lowered mo-
rale that come with drought, thin mar-
gins, and a broken supply chain. 
In 2023, Congress must reauthorize 
the farm bill with American farm fami-
lies at the front of our minds because 
they are in crisis. 
I will be back on the floor soon to de-
liver another installment of my farm 
bill impact series and highlight more 
programs and titles within the bill that 
I believe Congress must understand and 
support to ensure that agriculture 
thrives in America. 
The people who feed, fuel, and clothe 
us all deserve our unwavering support. 
They also deserve a robust safety net 
in the farm bill and workable solutions 
to the inflation crisis before it is too 
late. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend for stand-
ing up for those wheat farmers. I know 
they appreciate that representation. 
For all of those in the ag community, 
this is just a critical issue. 
The gentleman is exactly right. The 
inflation crisis has real-world con-
sequences, and that is just some of 
them. 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to go across 
the country to California again to 
hear, once more, from our dear, faith-
ful friend. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Louisiana (Mr. 
JOHNSON) for continuing to lead these 
in order to get this important message 
out on what is facing Americans not 
because of a naturally caused crisis but 
a man-made one, a government-made 
one. We are doing it to ourselves. 
Instead of addressing the economic 
crisis that is plaguing Americans, the 
Democrats are prioritizing liberal ini-
tiatives and increasing Federal spend-
ing, with some accounts receiving dou-
ble-digit and even triple-digit percent-
age increases typically through regu-
latory agencies that are going to make 
our jobs harder to do. 
We have issues. Mr. Speaker, this is 
just a small example right here of some 
of the prices of things that are going 
up. It is not because we have had hurri-
canes or things like that that have 
wiped out crops. No. We have had a lot 
of droughts, but in my home State of 
California, some of that drought and 
some of the shortages of water, indeed, 
are because of government action. 
The priorities that we see for spend-
ing include giving 20 percent more 
money to the EPA. I have had the EPA 
work in conjunction with the Army 
Corps of Engineers to stop people from 
farming fields in my district because 
they think it might have an effect on 
the Clean War Act or something like 
that. These are fields that have already 
been farmed in the past and have been 
fallow for a period of time, and they 
want to put them back into produc-
tion. Oh, no, you need a permit. They 
didn’t think they needed a permit. 
They didn’t know they needed a per-
mit, and so they get fined, big-time. 
As Americans face this runaway in-
flation caused by out-of-control gov-
ernment spending and other regulatory 
issues that drive up the cost of every-
thing, these are the solutions we get: 
even more government. 
I put some reasonable amendments 
across recently to try and move things

July 20, 2022 
in the right direction and not have 
these outlandish spending ideas take 
hold. 
For example, in my home State of 
California, Mr. Speaker, you may have 
heard of our high-speed rail project 
that supposedly would link San Fran-
cisco to Los Angeles. Well, it sounded 
like a neat idea on paper when it was 
proposed and finally voted on by the 
voters to put $9 billion of bond money 
toward that back in 2008 for a $33 bil-
lion project. 
So, they voted for it. Actually, they 
delayed the election several times be-
cause they didn’t want to vote in an-
other bond in an atmosphere that 
might not have been perfect, so they 
chose 2008, and somehow, it passed 52 to 
48 percent. At $9 billion, that was trig-
gered by the voters saying build a high- 
speed rail; you can’t subsidize it; it has 
to carry its own weight. The price 
soon, when we figured it out, 3 years 
later, tripled from $33 billion to $98.5 
billion. It is projected now to be about 
$105 billion. 
I had a recent proposal saying: No 
more spending on this until we actu-
ally have a handle on a few important 
items. They are not even compensating 
the landowners in the valley so far for 
the land they are taking by eminent 
domain that is in the right-of-way. 
They have all this money, it is such a 
great idea, and they aren’t getting 
around to even paying the people 
whose land lies in the way of it. What 
is that all about? 
As well, they are not doing the envi-
ronmental stuff properly to see that 
the path is going to be properly han-
dled as far as what might be environ-
mentally sensitive in that area. 
Thirdly, they don’t even have the 
whole route laid out. They don’t know 
how they are going to get south of Ba-
kersfield through the Grapevine, over 
the Grapevine, and around the Grape-
vine into L.A. Are they going to build 
a $25 billion tunnel through there that 
might be subject to seismic? Who 
knows. But they are still pursuing it 
anyway. 
It has received $3.5 billion of stim-
ulus money from the Obama era of 2009 
money—2009, we are talking. Then, 
they want to get another $2 billion 
from the so-called infrastructure bill 
that passed recently. That is $5.5 bil-
lion of Federal taxpayer money that all 
the 49 other States get to pay for, for 
this boondoggle that, so far, they can 
maybe lay their hands on $25 billion, 
the projection, for a project that is 
going to cost $105 billion. They are 
going to be searching for $80 billion 
more. They have already gotten five 
out of the Federal Government, pretty 
much. They want $80 billion more. 
The whole premise of high-speed rail 
was that private investors couldn’t 
wait to come in to be part of this 
project to help build this fast train 
from L.A. to San Francisco. The inves-
tors are staying away until and unless 
you make guarantees that they will 
make money, and that is not even al-
lowed in the original proposition that 
was barely passed by the voters. 
There really is no end here on this. 
They will continue to pursue Federal 
money because they don’t have it at 
the local level. We have to put a stop 
to that. That is why I offered an 
amendment. 
This is at a time when people need 
lower priced fuels for their cars. That 
is all driven by policies that are hap-
pening here in Washington, D.C., pret-
ty much. You can’t blame it all on 
Ukraine and Putin. Yes, we import 
maybe 7 or 8 percent of our oil. We 
could have made that up quickly with 
known reserves of energy we have here, 
energy we can produce in this country. 
We don’t need Russian oil. We don’t 
need Putin oil. We don’t need foreign 
oil. We can do it here. We should be 
doing it. But Biden is making us pay 
the price with this incredible transi-
tion thing he is talking about. It is just 
hurting the American people. Energy 
affects the cost of everything, even the 
final bit where if you got it, then a 
truck brought it. 
In the meantime, California, under a 
bill called AB5, is putting owner-oper-
ator trucks out of business because 
they are not part of an employment— 
they don’t belong to a union or what 
have you. In Washington, D.C., they 
want to emulate that bill called AB5 
under what is called the PRO Act and 
have it cost everybody in the whole 
country over that. 
The ideas coming out of here are not 
helping the American people. It is very 
tone-deaf here in Washington, D.C., and 
in the White House of what the Amer-
ican people are struggling with, with 
inflation and more profligate spending 
coming out of this place. 
As I mentioned, the Army Corps of 
Engineers has been busy as a tool of 
the EPA, working on something called 
the waters of the United States. They 
want to be in charge of every drop of 
water that hits the ground in the coun-
try. Even if it hits your roof, Mr. 
Speaker, and runs down your gutter, 
there are some jurisdictions that want 
to control that. 
It is pretty ominous, especially when 
you look at my colleague before me 
who spoke about the wheat situation in 
Kansas, as well as they are having dif-
ficulty with their wheat crop down in 
Texas. I have wheat growers up in the 
northern part of my State in the Klam-
ath Basin that if they could get just 
enough water, they could get a wheat 
crop. But they are taking the water 
away and flushing it down the Klamath 
River, ostensibly to help the fish popu-
lation. But that doesn’t even work be-
cause they are trying to flush some dis-
ease or virus out of it, and it doesn’t 
even work. Yet, they keep doing it any-
way. 
It is kind of like with the delta in 
California, flushing water out to save 
the delta smelt. The delta smelt popu-
lation is basically extinct, and they 
still flush millions of acre-feet of water 
out through that. 
So, California’s agriculture is suf-
fering. California’s economy suffers. 
Those people who are productive are 
now unemployed, needing assistance 
instead of being part of the assistance. 
These are all government regulations 
coming from D.C. and from California. 
It also affects low-cost energy, re-
newable energy, hydroelectric power. 
When they take that water away from 
the Klamath, when they take it away 
from Shasta Dam and run it out the 
ocean, that means your electricity 
prices go up, Mr. Speaker. This all af-
fects the economics of American fami-
lies because of regulations and prof-
ligate spending here in Washington, 
D.C. 
As we look at the world food situa-
tion, as my colleague from Kansas has 
talked about, we are not getting the 
wheat crop out of the Midwest. There 
is not enough to run a combine. As he 
mentioned, we can’t even run a com-
bine up in Klamath Basin. 
If they don’t get the water for the 
wheat, where are they going to run a 
combine to help us? Ukraine? They are 
dodging bombs right now. Russia has 27 
million tons of wheat tied up that they 
are not letting out of the ports in 
Ukraine. 
Where are we supposed to get the 
food? Hungary is cutting off their ex-
ports of wheat. India is cutting off 
their exports of wheat. We can’t grow 
it in this country. Where in hell are 
people supposed to get food? No one is 
going to come to help us. 
America is always the one helping 
everyone else. We need water for ag. 
We need the money they are wasting 
on high-speed rail, $105 billion. You 
could build 21 $5 billion dams for that 
and grow the food in California that so 
many people depend on. 
I will have an update on that as well 
as to why California food is important 
not just in California to growers and 
workers there but to people in New 
York, people in Pennsylvania, and peo-
ple all through the Midwest. What we 
grow is important not just for our local 
economy but actually to keep things 
on the table that people need and de-
mand. Instead, we would be importing 
them or not having them at all. 
It all starts here in Washington, D.C., 
with misplaced priorities coming out of 
this administration that are not help-
ing. I have to ask often to the Biden 
administration and even some of my 
colleagues in these two Houses here: 
Whose side are you on? 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend. There are 
so many important things he high-
lighted there. 
Mr. Speaker, we will go from Cali-
fornia over to the great State of Texas 
next. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
my friend from Louisiana for yielding 
to me. I appreciate his time on the 
floor. 
I was in the House Judiciary Com-
mittee. I will be spending some time in

the 30-minute Special Order here in a 
second, dealing with a lot of the issues 
that my friend was just talking about, 
in particular dealing with energy. 
What I will be talking about is: They 
break it; you buy it. That is the reality 
of what we are dealing with, with our 
Democratic colleagues here in the ma-
jority and in the administration. 
Energy is the perfect example of 
that. We are seeing that obviously in 
Texas, where we are sitting on a sea of 
oil and gas that we could be exploring 
further and producing for the world 
and driving down CO2. Instead, we are 
not because of the leftist policies of 
this administration. I will be beginning 
that in a minute. 
I 
appreciate 
the 
gentleman 
and 
thank him for holding this Special 
Order hour time on the floor for our 
colleagues. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I am grateful for my friend’s 
voice. He was a guest on my podcast 
last week, and we have gotten a lot of 
attention on that. People are grateful 
for his passion on these issues. I hope 
my friend will keep speaking loudly 
here on the floor and everywhere. I am 
grateful he has a national platform to 
talk, particularly about this immigra-
tion crisis, which is a whole different 
subject, and he has great insight on 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I will wrap this up. I 
thank my colleagues for joining me 
today in this Special Order hour to dis-
cuss the harm that the Democrat agen-
da has caused our country and our al-
ternative visions on all these issues. 
By way of recap, just quickly, I was 
taking notes as my colleague spoke 
from across the country, from Texas. 
Dr. BABIN reminded us that a stag-
gering 77 percent of Americans believe 
our country is on the wrong track—ob-
viously, because of all this. 
Mr. LAMALFA from California just re-
minded us of the excesses and abuses of 
the Federal agencies, which are over-
regulating our farmers and food pro-
ducers and wasting our time and pre-
cious resources on these superfluous 
projects. 
Mr. MEUSER
of Pennsylvania re-
minded us that this inflation is going 
to cost the average hardworking Amer-
ican family this year an extra $6,000 in 
the cost of living. 
Mr. ROSE from Tennessee reminded 
us about that skyrocketing inflation 
rate. It is obviously the result of the 
Biden policies and the administration’s 
backward approach to all this. But 
they even now want to remove and 
eliminate the Hyde amendment so that 
taxpayers have to fund abortions. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia reminded us 
about that border catastrophe and the 
numbers, which are staggering—Mr. 
ROY knows, as well—3 million encoun-
ters at the border, 800,000 got-aways 
that we can’t even account for, and 
that is just the numbers the DHS ad-
mits to, so we know it is higher. He 
talked about the energy policy disaster 
causing pain to every hardworking 
American family, as well. 
Finally, Mr. MANN of Kansas talked 
about how the inflation crisis has real- 
world consequences for our farmers in 
the wheat State and everywhere else. 
Mr. Speaker, we could go on and on 
all night. I will conclude our Special 
Order hour. This is just a sampling of 
all the many crises that have been cre-
ated by the Biden administration and 
the Washington Democrats in charge of 
this institution. We cannot wait to 
begin to turn this around after the No-
vember election. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

THEY BREAK IT, YOU BUY IT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the time here on the floor. 
I appreciate, as I said a minute ago, 
my friend from Louisiana, Representa-
tive JOHNSON, for his steadfast defense 
of the Constitution of the United 
States; his willingness to stand up for 
all the important values, from life to 
marriage; but importantly being a 
voice for this body, for the Republican 
Conference, and where we want to take 
this country; what we know the Amer-
ican people want us to do; and to stand 
athwart the absolutely absurd policies 
of a Democrat majority that doesn’t 
give a whit about the people that they 
are rolling over in a quest to placate 
their radical leftist policies, whether it 
is energy or open borders, and I appre-
ciate the gentleman from Louisiana 
and his efforts. 
I am here to talk about my Demo-
cratic colleagues and the extent to 
which the American people need to un-
derstand: They break it, you buy it. 
And that is the reality of what is hap-
pening. 
My Democratic colleagues are break-
ing—breaking this country, breaking 
up your families, breaking up our se-
cure border, breaking up our military, 
breaking up our court system, the rule 
of law, breaking up our police, our law 
enforcement community. 
They are breaking up our economy, 
breaking the strength of the American 
dollar. They are breaking our position 
in the world, and they are breaking 
this body, the people’s House. And it is 
high time it stopped. 
And we can only hope that in Novem-
ber we get a change so that we can stop 
it. And then my message to my Repub-
lican colleagues will be: We better stop 
it because what is happening in the so- 
called people’s House cannot be toler-
ated any longer. 
They break it. This body, the leader-
ship of this country, they break it. You 
buy it. 
In reverse, I would say, America is 
great. Washington is broken. They are 
breaking it every day and, as a result, 
they are breaking this great country 
that our forefathers fought so hard to 
give to us and to our children and our 
grandchildren. 
You cannot defend the policies of the 
Democratic majority. It is impossible 
to do. And in fact, if you set out to 
harm the United States of America, I 
would defy someone to demonstrate to 
me how you could do better than my 
Democratic colleagues are doing on a 
daily basis, ripping apart the Constitu-
tion, ripping apart the shreds of the 
flag, ripping apart the people of this 
country. 
Dividing us. Dividing us by race, di-
viding us by income, dividing us by our 
adherence to the Constitution or devo-
tion to the border and devotion to the 
rule of law. 
That is what is happening on a daily 
basis, and it is purposeful. Let’s be per-
fectly clear that it is purposeful. 
The 
reason 
my 
Democratic 
col-
leagues focus so intently on January 6 
is they want to divide us. The reason 
they want to have race-based policies 
throughout our government is they 
want to divide us. 
The reason they want to make the 
border be supposedly about not liking 
Brown people is because they want to 
divide us. Never mind that south Texas 
is full of Brown people who are sick of 
wide-open borders empowering cartels. 
That is the reality of what is going 
on in this Chamber, and in the Senate, 
and at the other end of Pennsylvania 
Avenue. 
Just focus on the border for a 
minute: Broken, wide open, abused by 
cartels, exploited by terrorists, ex-
ploited by gang members, criminals 
coming into our country, killing Amer-
ican citizens. Fentanyl pouring into 
our communities, 107,000 dead Ameri-
cans. 850,000 known got-aways pouring 
in between the ports of entry because 
our Border Patrol is overwhelmed, with 
not only no support from this adminis-
tration, but the purposeful attack by 
the Secretary of Homeland Security 
lying about the good men and women 
of Border Patrol, saying that they 
whipped people that they didn’t, and 
then hiding behind some report, while 
they give them administrative punish-
ment. 
That is your leadership, ladies and 
gentlemen. They are breaking it and 
you have to buy it. 
They are leaving our border wide 
open, and American citizens are dying. 
Let me repeat that. They are leaving 
our border wide open, broken, and 
American people are dying, thousands 
upon thousands of Americans dying 
from fentanyl pouring into our commu-
nities, pushed by China, exploited by 
cartels, left to be able to come into our 
country because Democrats do not care 
about securing the border. 
And more importantly, my Demo-
cratic colleagues are perfectly fine pur-
posely leaving our border wide open. It 
is purposeful. It is purposeful. 
They are breaking it and you are 
going to have to buy it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6914 
July 20, 2022 
How about our defense? 
Our Defense Department is being bro-
ken on a daily basis by my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle and in the 
other Chamber, and particularly, this 
administration, shoving into the De-
partment of Defense a radical, woke 
ideology, radical, woke programs, poli-
cies focused on diversity, and equity, 
and inclusion, all of the things that 
they cloak with critical race theory to 
destroy and break apart the institution 
of our defense. It is purposeful. 
Vaccine 
mandates, 
forcing 
60,000 
guardsmen to be on the chopping block 
to lose their entire career. It is pur-
poseful. They are breaking it. 
They are breaking that military you 
love. They are breaking that Depart-
ment of Defense that needs to be there 
on that wall defending us. They are 
breaking it. 
They are breaking it by tucking tail 
and running out of Afghanistan with 
$85 billion of equipment there and 12 or 
13 dead servicemembers and no ac-
countability. No accountability for the 
brass at the Pentagon and no account-
ability so far at the White House for 
tucking tail and running. 
They are breaking our Defense De-
partment. 
You talk to the servicemembers who 
were in my office, coming in in tears 
because they are about to lose their en-
tire career because they choose not to 
take a politicized vaccine. 
Oh, by the way, by another broken 
governmental agency, or agencies, our 
whole 
public 
health 
system 
being 
radicalized by my colleagues on the 
other side of aisle to strike fear in the 
hearts of the American people, to 
watch them push aside and brush under 
the rug gain-of-function research and 
all that we see unfolding in China in 
the Wuhan Institute of Virology, all 
that we know about the funding, Amer-
ican funding that was tied to that. 
All that we know about the absurdity 
of locking down schools, shutting down 
our schools so our kids are stuck in 
masks, stuck in the corner and not 
able to go to school, the damage it has 
done to our kids, the mental health 
issues, destroying the education of our 
young, 
all 
chasing 
the 
teachers’ 
unions. 
We have seen the mandatory—or ef-
forts at mandatory vaccines—thank-
fully, partially struck aside, but many 
still in place, breaking the back of the 
people’s trust in their public health, 
breaking the back of the people’s abil-
ity to serve in the military and defend 
this country, breaking the back of peo-
ple being able to be Federal public 
servants working for Border Patrol or 
other Federal agencies. 
Why? 
Because of fealty to Anthony Fauci, 
being the great wizard of public health 
while he poses for magazine covers and 
throws out pitches at baseball games. 
Meanwhile, your defense is broken. 
Your public health is broken, and you 
are going to have to buy it. 
How about crime on the streets of 
the United States of America? 
How about the 12 Democrat-run cit-
ies that have called for defunding their 
police and have seen skyrocketing 
crime enveloping the cities? 
The businessowner I spoke to today 
in Baltimore who says he is going to 
have to shut down his franchise be-
cause of rampant crime in Baltimore. 
Austin, Texas, which cut its police by 
a third and has seen homicides sky-
rocket from 59 to 89, has seen 911 calls 
unanswered, drug trafficking increas-
ing. Taking police off the streets in 
Austin, Texas. 
We have seen 50 of the biggest urban 
areas see a 5 percent decrease in their 
police budgets, while my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle say they are 
doing no such thing. 
But my friend, Mr. JOHNSON, rattled 
off quote after quote after quote in the 
House Judiciary Committee of my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
calling for defunding of the police. Of 
course, it is an attack on our police. 
They are breaking our Police Depart-
ment, breaking the backs of our men 
and women in blue and leaving our 
streets exposed to lawlessness and dan-
ger, and it is purposeful. 
How about energy? 
Could you take a more ridiculous po-
sition than to take the strength of na-
tional security, of having abundant oil 
and gas, the ability to lead on nuclear, 
and, instead, chase unicorn energy 
policies of nothing but solar and wind 
so that on a cloudless, windless day—or 
cloudy, windless day, you sit back and 
watch your energy plummet and your 
grid weaken. 
What kind of a country’s leadership 
does that to its people? 
I would say the kind that want to 
break it. I would say the kind that 
want to chase the fairy tales and the 
unicorn energy policies that this ad-
ministration wants to pursue. 
We could have nuclear power. It 
doesn’t create any carbon dioxide. Do 
my colleagues on the other side of aisle 
want to do that? 
No. Because this is about fear. This is 
about breaking American energy. This 
is about breaking the back of it, so you 
can get on your private plane and fly 
to Davos and fit in with the Western 
Europeans and how great they are, 
while they are now burning wood to 
heat their homes. 
We have the greatest national secu-
rity asset you could possibly imagine, 
which was full and complete energy 
independence, and we are completely 
flushing it down the toilet, to break it 
and to break it purposely. And we don’t 
have to do it. 
We have abundant energy, abundant, 
clean-burning natural gas that we 
could export to other countries, as we 
were doing, driving down carbon diox-
ide. 
We could be producing nuclear facili-
ties all across this country with zero 
CO2 production. But we are not. 
Instead, we are chasing—literally, we 
are tilting at windmills, dotting the 
landscape with windmills. 
A couple of weeks ago in Texas, we 
had 8 percent of the wind capacity 
available in our grid. Absolutely as-
tounding what we are doing to the en-
ergy of the United States of America. 
Inflation. I mean, I can’t even get all 
this in, the absurd policies of Demo-
crats. 
I have already covered border, could 
go further. 
Already talked about defense; could 
go further. 
Didn’t even get into Ukraine and the 
lack of briefings and the $56 billion we 
just dumped into Ukraine, with zero in-
dication of a strategy of what we are 
actually going to do, while we expand 
NATO, with zero indication about how 
that is going to impact Article 5, and 
an 800-mile border and whether NATO’s 
going to upend its end of the bargain 
when we fund the vast majority of 
NATO. I didn’t even talk about that 
part of defense. 
I didn’t talk about crime. I mean, I 
talked about crime, but I didn’t get 
into every aspect of it. 
I didn’t get into every aspect of en-
ergy. 
Now I am talking about inflation. 
The wisdom of this administration 
coming in and dumping $1.9 trillion—I 
don’t even remember what the name of 
that ridiculous bill was, but it was gar-
bage. And it is now driving up the cost 
of goods and services for you, the 
American people. 
They are breaking it. They are 
breaking your jobs. They are breaking 
your income. They are breaking your 
ability to buy goods and services and 
you are, literally, going to have to buy 
it, and you are going to have to pay a 
lot for it, because they are spending 
money we don’t have. 
They are printing money, throwing it 
out in the economy, driving up the 
prices of goods, while they are, simul-
taneously, restricting the ability for us 
to develop energy, to have abundant 
energy that you can afford. 
You like $4.50 gasoline? Well, guess 
what? Your Democratic leadership just 
defended that as being great. In a Rules 
Committee debate this week, when I 
sat in that room debating the rules, lit-
erally, the Democratic Rules Com-
mittee was talking about how great it 
is that the price of oil has come down. 
They were talking about the price of 
copper going down. Well, I have spent a 
lot of money on copper to wire my 
home. It is expensive as heck. It is now 
locked up in cages. But do you know 
what the price of copper going down 
means? Heading into a recession. That 
is the reality of what we are facing. 
That is the truth. 
Our economy is getting ripped to 
shreds, the price of goods and services 
are going up. And it is purposeful. 
Spending money we don’t have. 
How can you justify spending $2 tril-
lion, printing that money, and dump-
ing it out there to drive up the price of 
goods and services, while cutting off 
the production of oil and gas, not de-
veloping nuclear, increasing the price

of gasoline, increasing the price of en-
ergy in your homes? 
It could only be purposeful. They are 
breaking it. They want to break it so 
they can live in unicorn land. 
But you are going to have to buy it, 
and it is going to be expensive. 
How about the state of the rule of 
law? 
How about the state of the family? 
How about the state of marriage? 
Just yesterday, on this floor—just 
yesterday, on this floor, we passed a 
law to force recognition by one State 
of another State’s marriage, but by 
thereby doing that, for the first time, I 
think this body, certainly Members on 
this side, supporting the redefinition of 
marriage, which was manufactured by 
the 2015 Supreme Court decision, man-
ufactured and forced upon the States, a 
redefinition of marriage. 
Now you see the wailing and gnash-
ing of teeth because this court dared to 
say that Roe v. Wade was bad law, and 
that we should defer to the States in 
the protection of life and the recogni-
tion that that is the appropriate law 
under the Constitution. 
b 1630 
Lastly, I would point out when we 
are talking about breaking it, this 
body is the best example of my Demo-
cratic colleagues not giving a whit 
about you, the people, rolling over and 
destroying the people’s House, destroy-
ing this institution. 
I have not been able to offer an 
amendment on the floor of this body. 
Can’t do it. Got to go to Rules. Beg for 
crumbs. 
They drive through so-called suspen-
sion of the rules bills. We get them 
often hours before, at most, a day or 
two before they are on the floor being 
asked to be voice voted. If we don’t 
have a group of us on the floor moni-
toring those bills, they will go through 
without a vote. 
They 
don’t 
care 
because 
voting 
doesn’t matter, as evidenced by proxy 
voting, forcing a new rule that says 
you can turn your voting card that 
you, the voters, gave to representatives 
and give that to another member of 
Congress, upending the constitutional 
order 
which 
requires 
presence, 
a 
quorum, physical presence, debate. 
That is what the Constitution con-
templates, and it is my Democratic 
colleagues who, for the first time in 
history, upended our requirement that 
we be present in the body of the House 
of Representatives to do our job. Blow-
ing apart—blowing apart—this people’s 
House. 
I will note, as I often do, that I am 
not saying that everybody on this side 
of the aisle has clean hands on all of 
these points. A lot of Republicans are 
taking advantage of the proxy voting 
that my Democratic colleagues created 
for the first time in history. They 
should not. 
I will say that to every member. I 
don’t care if they are Freedom Caucus 
leadership or anybody in between. I 
will not back away from saying proxy 
voting is not only unconstitutional, it 
is wrong, and it is destroying this body. 
Forced magnetometers in this false 
name of security. Masks being forced 
upon members of Congress on the floor 
of the House, which have now been 
brushed aside because I guess Anthony 
Fauci or somebody decreed that some-
how, it is now safe to walk around 
without masks until they say it is not 
safe. 
I yield to my friend from Virginia 
here in one second. I just want to say 
in conclusion to this part, and then I 
want to engage with my friend. 
My Democratic colleagues, unfortu-
nately with a little bit of help from a 
few of my Republican colleagues on oc-
casion, are breaking this country. They 
are breaking this body. They are 
breaking our Constitution, and it is 
purposeful. 
There are no other words to say what 
is happening at our border but that it 
is purposeful. There are no other words 
to say about what is happening on our 
streets with our law enforcement but 
that it is purposeful. 
There is no other thing you can say 
about our energy policies but that it is 
purposeful. There is nothing you can 
say about the spending and the infla-
tion but that it is purposeful. 
The attack on the institution of mar-
riage, the breakdown of the family, the 
targeting and the policies against life, 
that it is purposeful. 
The fact that we are destroying this 
body with proxy voting, that it is pur-
poseful. The fact that we are destroy-
ing the Defense Department and the 
very core values of our men and women 
in the military with their woke poli-
cies, with their vax mandates, irrespec-
tive of what that does to defense, driv-
ing our recruiting down to unforeseen 
levels, but that it is purposeful, and it 
is wrong. 
I would just challenge my Republican 
colleagues that we better come in, if 
the American people give us power in 
November, and do the right thing to 
protect this country and to stop break-
ing it because the American people are 
having to buy it. 
I yield to my friend from Virginia 
(Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. I thank the 
gentleman from Texas for yielding 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, I had a constituent say 
to me from Bedford County, just out-
side of Lynchburg where I live, nothing 
this President and this majority in 
Congress is doing makes sense unless 
they hate the country. Nothing they 
are doing makes sense unless they hate 
the country. 
What would you do differently over 
the last year and a half if it was your 
purpose, your desire, your intention to 
ruin the country? 
Maybe you would undermine police. 
Maybe you would reduce funding for 
police. Maybe you would stop arresting 
violent criminals. Maybe you would 
stop prosecuting violent crimes. Maybe 
you would allow violent criminals to 
have no cash bail. Maybe we would re-
lease violent criminals from our pris-
ons. 
You know what? All of those things 
are happening, and the Democrats 
seem surprised that crime has gone up 
across the country. Violent crime is up 
some 30 percent in the last year across 
the country. 
American 
cities, 
unrecognizable. 
People don’t want to go there anymore 
because of these policies. Maybe the 
American people don’t want 4 million 
illegal aliens coming into the interior 
of their country in the past year and a 
half. 
Maybe we have a shortage of funding 
to take care of Americans, to do the 
things that we would like to do, to 
take care of our veterans, to take care 
of those most in need, to help our farm-
ers, to help hard-working Americans, 
to maybe give them a little bit of their 
resources back, to reduce the regula-
tions and the oppression upon them. 
Maybe we don’t need to bring in 4 
million illegal aliens in a year and a 
half, 10,000 a day now, the average is, 
give them free social services, free 
healthcare, free education, free travel, 
with no requirement to even appear in 
court. Maybe the American people 
want their border secured. 
Maybe the American people don’t 
want massive inflation, 40-year record 
inflation, caused primarily by the mas-
sive spending, the reckless spending, 
and the energy policies. 
Think about where we might be if 
this Democrat majority had gotten 
their $6 trillion build back bankrupt 
bill 
through 
Congress. 
$20,000 
per 
American citizen. They like to say 
sometimes, oh, some of this stuff is 
popular. It polls well. People want this. 
$6 trillion is what they have tried to 
spend, and they are still trying to 
backdoor it in over these remaining 
months that they may have power. 
How would it poll, do you think, if we 
said, American citizen, do you want 
this so-called benefit, this so-called 
perk, what have you, but your share of 
the cost is $20,000. So a family of three, 
your share is $60,000. How many would 
vote for these policies? 
Not to mention what they are doing 
on energy by design, on purpose, the 
dishonest attack on the fossil fuel in-
dustry, the dishonest narrative that we 
are not the cleanest, large energy pro-
ducers in the world; the damage that 
has been done to the economy; the 
damage that has been done to the way 
that American people live their lives. 
What are they doing? They are brag-
ging about the pain that they are caus-
ing. The more pain, the better, they 
are saying. That is what the President 
has said. Hey, we are halfway through 
a transition. If we could just get 
through to the other side, it is going to 
be so much better, you know. 
As you said in candy land and uni-
corn land, we are going to have all 
these jobs and all this prosperity be-
cause we went through all this pain.

July 20, 2022 
But the fact is, the fossil fuel indus-
try has been used to bring more pros-
perity to third world countries than 
any other development in industrial 
history. 
This assault on our freedoms, our 
economic 
freedoms, 
our 
healthcare 
freedoms, as you mentioned, whether it 
is the mask, whether it is the vaccines, 
our individual freedoms with the Sec-
ond Amendment assault. 
This body is going to try to pass two 
more bills to take away and restrict 
Second Amendment rights. That is 
going to happen in this House, we are 
told. The continued assault on the Sec-
ond Amendment right. 
You know, I have right here—I don’t 
do this very often, but I have some 
quotes from the Founders as it relates 
to the Second Amendment right. 
As I was looking for quotes, you 
know, I couldn’t find anything that 
talked about that people could keep 
and bear arms so they could target 
practice; that people could keep and 
bear arms so they could hunt; that peo-
ple could keep and bear arms for sport-
ing purposes. 
These quotes that I have here from 
the Founders explaining why they 
wrote into the Constitution the Second 
Amendment as they did was to ensure 
we remain free. 
Freedom has a cost. Most of the 
world does not live free to the extent 
that we still live free, as you often 
enunciate. 
Whether the majority of this Con-
gress likes it or not, we have a Con-
stitution. I happen to like it. I know 
you do as well. The framers, in their 
wisdom, made it possible to change the 
Constitution, but they made it difficult 
by design. 
They said, hey, if you want to change 
the Constitution, you have got to have 
super majorities of both Houses. You 
have got to have super majorities of 
the State legislatures in order to bring 
transformational change to the coun-
try and amend the Constitution. 
But, instead, they want to undermine 
the Constitution, undermine our free-
doms, and attack the rights guaranteed 
to Americans in our Constitution. 
Mr. ROY. I ask of the Chair how 
much time we have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 5 minutes remaining. 
Mr. ROY. I would just add to my 
friend from Virginia a great quote from 
Thomas Jefferson—because he knows I 
went to the University of Virginia. 
The strongest reason for the people to re-
tain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a 
last resort, to protect themselves against 
tyranny in government. 
That is the purpose of the Second 
Amendment, and that is what we know. 
I would note that in this context, and 
I will yield another couple minutes to 
the gentleman if he wants it, when we 
are talking about the response from 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, they break our border purpose-
fully, and then they want us to fix it 
with amnesty or with some policies to 
say that Texas has to just accept. 
I hear that the mayor of New York is 
all 
aghast 
that 
people 
are 
being 
dropped off in New York. He said, we 
need Federal Government help to deal 
with it. I am, like, welcome to the 
party, pal. This is what life is like in 
south Texas every single day. 
They break it. They break the bor-
der, and then they want you, the Amer-
ican people, to have to carry the water. 
They break the Defense Department, 
drive recruiting down to 40 percent, 
and then they put in language to draft 
our daughters, all in the name of so- 
called equity and equality. 
They break our criminal justice sys-
tem. They break the backs of our law 
enforcement community. Then they 
say, we are going to take your guns, 
your ability to defend yourself. 
They break the energy system in our 
country. Then they say, just go buy a 
Tesla. What is wrong with you? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. 70,000 bucks. 
Go ahead. 
Mr. ROY. What is wrong with you? 
Go buy a Tesla. You can plug in. You 
can drive through west Texas, 300 
miles. Don’t worry about it. Stop off in 
Eden, Texas, where, no doubt, they 
have a charging station and spend 
$70,000 for the pleasure. 
They break the back of the economy, 
drive up in inflation, and they say, 
suck it up, buttercup. Go buy yourself 
some expensive chicken and rice. 
They break the back of this body, 
this institution, and they ignore their 
colleagues when their colleagues are 
saying the chickens are going to come 
home to roost. 
That is the reality of what we are 
dealing with: A purposeful breaking 
the back of this country and a tearing 
apart of the threads that hold us to-
gether. 
I am going to just say it here on the 
floor. If we don’t start respecting Fed-
eralism, the ability to agree to dis-
agree, then this country is doomed. It 
will break apart under its own weight, 
and it will be my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle that amassed the 
weight that will break the bow. 
That is where we are headed if we 
don’t start respecting the ability of in-
dividuals in this country to agree to 
disagree, allow Texans to be Texans, 
allow Californians to be Californians. 
Unite under the flag of the United 
States under our core principles but 
stop shredding our ability to disagree. 
Stop breaking this country and forcing 
the American people to buy it. 
I yield the balance of the time to my 
friend Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Well said by 
the gentleman from Texas. 
Their solution, this President’s solu-
tion, this majority’s solution to the 
economic wreckage they have created 
is to spend more money. 
You just ask yourself. You’re baffled. 
Is it malicious intent, and they recog-
nize the harm that they are doing; and 
how they are causing the harm; and 
they are doing it by design; and they 
are doing it on purpose; or are they 
that economically illiterate, and they 
really are clueless and have no idea 
what they are doing? 
Because we have record inflation, 40- 
year high inflation of 9 percent, which 
essentially means every American is 
working for 1 month free this year. One 
month out of the year they are essen-
tially not getting paid with the loss of 
purchasing power they have experi-
enced because of the inflation. 
So what is their answer to that? 
Well, if we could just spend more 
money, if we could just get more of our 
agenda passed and spend trillions of 
dollars more, then that will help the 
problem rather than make it worse. 
It is like the person who says, hey, I 
am trying to lose weight and then they 
would say, well, the solution is to eat 
more. That is the solution that they 
propose, to do more harm, and you just 
wonder, is it just that illiterate, that 
ignorant, or is it willful and devious 
and malicious? 
Mr. ROY. I thank the gentleman 
from Virginia. I think our time has ex-
pired. I appreciate the speaker and the 
staff here tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair and not to a per-
ceived viewing audience.

SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOOD) 
for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
the Second Amendment in our Con-
stitution is the amendment that guar-
antees or ensures all the other free-
doms that we hold dear in this country. 
The right to defend oneself is a God- 
given right, but we are unique among 
the nations of the world in that that 
right is protected for us and enshrined 
in our Constitution based on the wis-
dom of the Founders. 
There is a mechanism for changing 
the Constitution, but it is difficult. 
Yet, what this body wants to do is to 
find ways to do what the Constitution 
clearly says, which is that the Con-
gress has absolutely no constitutional 
authority to restrict the rights of law- 
abiding citizens to keep and bear arms. 
I am going to read a few quotes from 
the Founders from about 250 years ago, 
and the reason why we go back to the 
Founders is to understand what they 
intended with the Constitution. We 
have the Federalist Papers, of course, 
and then other writings by the Found-
ers. 
Alexander Hamilton said: ‘‘The best 
we can hope for concerning the people 
at large is that they be properly 
armed.’’ 
Samuel Adams said the Constitution 
shall ‘‘be never construed to authorize 
Congress to infringe . . . or to prevent

July 20, 2022 
the people of the United States, who 
are peaceable citizens, from keeping 
their own arms.’’ 
James Madison, the first Congress-
man from my Fifth District and our 
fourth President, said: ‘‘The Constitu-
tion preserves the advantage of being 
armed which Americans possess over 
the people of almost every other na-
tion,’’ where ‘‘the governments are 
afraid to trust the people with arms.’’ 
Still true today. 
Noah Webster said: ‘‘Before a stand-
ing army can rule, the people must be 
disarmed; as they are in almost every 
kingdom of Europe. . . . A military 
force, at the command of Congress, can 
execute no laws, but such as the people 
perceive to be just and constitutional; 
for they will possess the power . . . to 
resist the execution of a law which ap-
pears to them unjust and oppressive.’’ 
Thomas Jefferson, from my home dis-
trict in Virginia, from where the gen-
tleman from Texas went to school, 
said: ‘‘What country can preserve its 
liberties, if its rulers are not warned 
from time to time that this people pre-
serve the spirit of resistance? Let them 
take arms.’’ 
Thomas Jefferson also said: ‘‘No free 
man shall ever be debarred the use of 
arms.’’ 
Back to James Madison: ‘‘The right 
of the people to keep and bear . . . 
arms shall not be infringed. A well reg-
ulated militia, composed of the body of 
the people, trained to arms, is the best 
and most natural defense of a free 
country.’’ 
George Mason said: ‘‘To disarm the 
people—that was the best and most ef-
fectual way to enslave them.’’ 
Patrick Henry said: ‘‘Are we at last 
brought to such humiliating and debas-
ing degradation, that we cannot be 
trusted with arms for our defense?’’ ‘‘If 
our defense be the real object of having 
those arms, in whose hands can they be 
trusted with more propriety, or equal 
safety to us, as in our own hands?’’ 
Samuel Adams said: ‘‘The said Con-
stitution be never construed to author-
ize Congress to . . . prevent the people 
of the United States, who are peaceable 
citizens, 
from 
keeping 
their 
own 
arms.’’ 
Thomas Paine: ‘‘Arms discourage and 
keep the invader and the plunderer in 
awe, and preserve order in the world. 
. . . Horrid mischief would ensue were 
the law-abiding deprived of the use of 
them.’’ 
Patrick Henry also said: ‘‘Where and 
when did freedom exist, when the 
sword and purse were given up from the 
people?’’ 
We are doing that right here in this 
body. We are taking the sword and the 
purse away from the people. 
He said: ‘‘Unless a miracle in human 
affairs shall interpose, no nation ever 
did or ever can retain its liberty, after 
the loss of the sword and the purse.’’ 
‘‘The great object is that every man 
be armed.’’ 
‘‘Everyone who is able may have a 
gun.’’ 
Final quote from Thomas Jefferson, 
then I will defer to the gentleman from 
South Carolina: ‘‘Laws that forbid the 
carrying of arms . . . disarm only those 
who are neither inclined nor deter-
mined to commit crimes. Such laws 
make things worse for the assaulted 
and better for the assailants; they 
serve rather to encourage than prevent 
homicides, for an unarmed man may be 
attacked with greater confidence than 
an armed one.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I have to head 
down to the House Judiciary Com-
mittee to defend the Second Amend-
ment from the attacks being levied by 
my Democratic colleagues as we speak. 
We are in there debating. 
I would add just one thing to what 
the gentleman just eloquently put out, 
the understanding for the American 
people that when this Nation was 
founded, we were dealing with debate 
about what the structure of govern-
ment should look like. Those who were 
suspicious of consolidating power, the 
anti-Federalists, were raising ques-
tions. 
James Madison, a Virginian, was 
making points through the Federalist 
Papers. He said in response to some of 
the critiques: ‘‘All the other checks 
and balances will always prevent tyr-
anny, but should tyranny ever tri-
umph, the U.S. Constitution provides a 
mechanism to restore constitutional 
order,’’ he says. ‘‘Besides the advan-
tage of being armed, which the Ameri-
cans possess over the people of almost 
every other nation,’’ Madison wrote, 
‘‘the existence of subordinate govern-
ments, the State government to which 
the people are attached,’’ their State 
and local governments, ‘‘and by which 
the militia officers are appointed,’’ be-
cause 
that 
well-regulated 
militia 
meant a well-ordered militia, not regu-
lated the way we talk about it, a well- 
ordered militia. ‘‘And it forms a barrier 
against the enterprises of ambition 
more insurmountable than any which a 
simple government of any form can 
admit of.’’ 
The 
final 
point 
is, 
the 
Second 
Amendment does not create a right of 
revolution against tyranny. That in-
herent right is universal. The Second 
Amendment provides the tools and the 
power for the people to stand and 
thwart tyranny. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from South 
Carolina. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. GOOD for having this Special Order. 
Let me give you a live example of 
what happens with a well-armed mili-
tia, the purpose of the Second Amend-
ment is for the citizens of America to 
bear arms. 
This past Sunday, a deranged gun-
man opened fire in a food court of a 
shopping mall in Greenwood, Indiana, 
which is a suburb of Indianapolis. Po-
lice say this deranged gunman fired 24 
rounds within 2 minutes, killing three 
and injuring two others. 
Nearby was a young man, Elisjsha 
Dicken, a private citizen who took 
quick action to stop that gunman. 
Elisjsha was legally armed and car-
rying his own weapon under Indiana’s 
constitutional carry laws. Thank God 
for this young man. 
In summarizing Elisjsha’s response, 
the Greenwood chief of police said, ‘‘I 
will say his actions were nothing short 
of heroic. He engaged the gunman from 
quite a distance with a handgun.’’ The 
police chief went on to say Elisjsha was 
‘‘very tactically sound as he moved in 
to close on the suspect, and was also 
monitoring for people to exit behind 
him. He has had no police experience, 
no training, no military background.’’ 
What a true hero. Elisjsha was sim-
ply going about his business at the 
mall when the unthinkable happened. 
It is hard to imagine how we might 
react in that situation, but Elisjsha 
was equipped; he was prepared; and he 
had courage to confront that sick indi-
vidual, who was determined to kill oth-
ers. 
Elisjsha would not have been able to 
do so if the liberals who want to take 
away our Second Amendment rights 
had their way with this so-called gun 
control. 
To my Democratic friends who are 
determined to restrict our Second 
Amendment rights, I ask you this: How 
many more people might have died last 
Sunday in Greenwood, Indiana, if you 
had had your way? How many more 
people would have been slaughtered if 
Elisjsha didn’t have the ability to exer-
cise his constitutional rights? Thank-
fully, we will never know the answer to 
that question. 
Americans deserve the right to pro-
tect themselves and others when their 
lives are in severe danger. That is why 
it is so critical to strongly defend our 
Second Amendment rights against the 
antigun left that is so intent to demor-
alize our Second Amendment and our 
Constitution. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from South Caro-
lina. 
Ronald Reagan, to paraphrase, said: 
Freedom is only one generation away 
from extinction, and it must be fought 
and preserved from one generation to 
the next, and no nation having lost its 
freedom in history has ever regained it. 
You think about how, in the past 
year and a half, we have seen our most 
basic, most essential freedoms tram-
pled upon by those who would also 
trample upon our Second Amendment 
rights. They have moved to restrict our 
own healthcare decisions about wheth-
er or not we have to take a vaccine 
that we may not want or may not need. 
They have restricted our ability to 
travel and to move, where we want to 
go, whether or not we can assemble, 
whether or not we can worship, wheth-
er we can go to work, whether we can 
operate our business, whether or not 
we can earn a living. They want to 
trample upon our rights to defend our-
selves.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6918 
July 20, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. CAWTHORN). 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, 40 
yards, 10 rounds, one man, countless 
lives saved. I speak today to acknowl-
edge a new American hero. 
Just 2 weeks after Indiana passed a 
constitutional 
carry 
provision, 
one 
man stood tall in the face of imminent 
death, protecting his loved ones and his 
community from evil. Elisjsha Dick-
en’s incredibly quick and heroic ac-
tions are not just to be applauded in 
the media. They ought to be used as a 
blueprint for American citizens who le-
gally carry nationwide. 
There is strong evidence that the 
best defense an American can possess is 
a sidearm and the know-how to use it. 
Mr. Speaker, law-abiding citizens use 
firearms to defend themselves against 
criminals as many as 2.5 million times 
a year, or about 6,850 times a day. This 
means that, each year, firearms are 
used more than 80 times more often to 
protect the lives of honest citizens 
than to take lives. Moreover, citizens 
shoot and kill at least twice as many 
criminals as police do every year, as 
was the case in Greenwood. 
The analysis is clear. Law-abiding, 
gun-toting Americans are the best line 
of defense against random acts of mass 
violence. Make no mistake, Congress’ 
gun control lobby would have rather 
taken the handgun from Elisjsha’s 
hand and replaced it with blood-soaked 
corpses of many innocents in Indiana. 
Mr. Speaker, I speak for many Amer-
icans when I say we will carry; we will 
protect ourselves; we will neutralize 
threats to our safety and security. We 
don’t need you to defend us. Stop com-
ing for our security. Stop coming for 
our constitutionally protected rights. 
Retire to a nice seaside estate pro-
tected by armed guards and let red- 
blooded, 
freedom-loving 
Americans 
conceal carry and, when necessary, kill 
those who threaten our lives. Remem-
ber, you are your own first responder. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from North Caro-
lina. 
Mr. Speaker, can you confirm how 
much time we have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia has 17 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia 
(Mrs. GREENE), my good friend. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I am honored to stand here with my 
friends—Chairman 
PERRY, 
Mr. 
CAWTHORN, Mr. GOOD, Mr. NORMAN—in 
defense of our Second Amendment 
rights. I say this not only as a Member 
of Congress, but I say this as a woman, 
and I say this as a mother. I say this 
also as an adult who knows what it is 
like when my school was held hostage 
by another student with a gun, a very 
upset student. 
It is not the guns that are the issue. 
It is the severe mental illness, the 
breakdown in America with our morals 
and our values, and this severe divide 
among all of us as Americans. 
I want to add to this, and this is a 
story that I haven’t even been able to 
share with my good colleagues here, 
but just this weekend, now that I am a 
Member of Congress, many of us get a 
lot of death threats, but one of my 
family members received a voicemail 
on their personal cell phone from a 
man saying very bad things about me, 
and then saying: ‘‘This is what I am 
going to do to her,’’ and he cocked a 
gun and shot it several times. 
This is the type of threats I get, and 
it came with the threat of a gun. But I 
tell you this as a woman and a gun 
owner: I need to be able to have any 
kind of gun that I want to own to de-
fend myself, to defend my family, to 
defend my home. God forbid if someone 
chose to do something to me. 
You see, here is the issue: It doesn’t 
matter how many gun control laws we 
put in place. It doesn’t matter how 
many types of guns are banned. The 
criminals and the people who intend to 
do harm to others, those that would 
murder someone even if they could 
murder them with their bare hands, are 
still going to do it, and they are not 
going to be the ones that hand over 
their guns to the government. Oh, no, 
they are going to be keeping their guns 
so they can continue breaking the law. 
We have guns coming across our bor-
der every single day illegally. We have 
terrorists who have been caught at our 
border, and then we have a lot of got- 
aways. We don’t know how many of 
those are terrorists and what kind of 
criminals, 
how 
much 
human 
traf-
ficking, how much child trafficking is 
happening down there. Crime is up in 
every single city, county, and small 
town across America. 
b 1700 
Americans need their guns, and there 
should not be a ban on assault weapons 
because it is not about the gun or the 
weapon; it is about what is inside 
someone’s human heart. 
What we have to do is we have to 
stand in defense of and protect our Sec-
ond Amendment because it is the most 
important freedom that we have. If we 
are unable to do that, and we lose it in 
the name of the so-called issues—what 
they are pointing at really is a tool. A 
gun is a tool. The gun doesn’t get up 
and kill people on its own. It is the 
people who do it. 
When you take away all the guns 
from the legal gun owners, the crimi-
nals will be the ones that are left with 
the guns. Then do you want to know 
what happens? Even if those guns are 
gone, they are still going to commit 
murder, and they will just use some-
thing else. 
It is about elections. That is why 
they are trying to ban assault weapons, 
because inflation is out of control, 
crime is out of control, gas prices are 
difficult to afford. Now, our President 
is moving us on to some sort of clean 
energy that just will fail America even 
more. 
This isn’t what we need to do, and I 
am so happy that there are people here 
that want to stand in defense of peo-
ple’s gun rights. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Georgia. 
I yield to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. PERRY), the chairman of 
the Freedom Caucus. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend from the State of Virginia 
(Mr. GOOD) for helping host this Spe-
cial Order and being here in my ab-
sence. 
Oftentimes, I think that we make 
this partisan. Republicans are seen or 
characterized 
as 
unempathetic 
or 
uncaring in the face of so many trage-
dies. Of course, it couldn’t be further 
from the truth. We are empathetic. Our 
hearts break just like everyone else’s. 
But we recognize that in this imper-
fect Union that seeks to be more per-
fect every single day, with every single 
action, that the right to defend oneself, 
the right to bear arms, is enshrined in 
the founding documents, the founding 
documents that we all take an oath to 
uphold and defend. 
We don’t just dismiss that like it 
doesn’t exist. We understand that, un-
fortunately, there are evil people in the 
world and that this right exists, given 
to us by God, outlined in our Constitu-
tion, so that we can then defend our-
selves from any assailant, from any 
attacker, because we have the God- 
given rights of liberty and of life. We 
have that. 
We seek some kind of protection for 
ourselves that also protects our God- 
given rights but doesn’t allow the 
criminals to prevail upon us in our 
homes, in our businesses, and on the 
streets. 
Yet, right now, while Americans are 
suffering the worst cost of living in 40 
years—I 
know 
the 
administration 
doesn’t want to talk about it. Right 
now, violent crime is up 30 percent, an 
unprecedented rate, not told to us by 
SCOTT PERRY or BOB GOOD or RALPH 
NORMAN, but by our FBI, an unprece-
dented rise in violent crime. 
Right now, right down the hall, in-
stead of dealing with the rise in crime; 
instead of dealing with the fact that 
DAs, supported by the extreme radical 
left, are letting criminals out on the 
street; not dealing with the issue that 
millions of people are flowing across 
our border, certainly laced with a cer-
tain criminal element with no regard 
to American laws coming across our 
border; notwithstanding the fact that 
some of the people that lead our coun-
try at the highest levels bailed out vio-
lent criminals and paid for their bail to 
be on the street to then assault and as-
sail their neighbors, that is all hap-
pening right now. 
Down the hall, as we speak, our col-
leagues on the left are trying to re-
institute the assault weapon ban, the 
assault weapon ban that they know, 
since 1994, when it was instated then, 
did absolutely nothing to solve this 
problem. 
Because they don’t really care about 
crime—they don’t care at all. We are

seen 
as 
unempathetic. 
Meanwhile, 
every city, every weekend across the 
country, is like a war zone. You would 
actually be safer in a war zone. I know. 
I have actually been to a couple of 
them. You would actually be safer in a 
war zone than downtown Chicago, St. 
Louis, Detroit, or New Orleans. 
But they are down the hall working 
on a solution that doesn’t fix anything. 
It doesn’t fix a thing. It takes our 
rights away and doesn’t solve any-
thing. 
We are here because we believe that 
Americans have the right to defend 
themselves, to be free, and to be safe in 
their homes. We are here as Freedom 
Caucus members to say that we do 
stand with the Constitution. We actu-
ally believe in our oath. We think that 
we can do both. We think that we can 
defend ourselves and stop most crimi-
nals’ violent activities. 
But there have to be consequences. 
What you are seeing right now across 
the country are the consequences of 
not holding people accountable. That is 
what you are seeing right now, violent 
criminals being let out on the street 
over and over again. The message being 
sent by this administration and our 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
is it is okay. It is okay to just do that. 
It is okay to commit any crime you 
want. 
Heck, there was a gentleman in New 
York minding his store. He was at-
tacked. He defended himself. Unfortu-
nately, the attacker’s life was taken. 
What did the district attorney do? He 
charged the man who defended himself 
with murder. That sends a signal to 
every criminal that it is okay to com-
mit your crimes. 
Mr. Speaker, it is not okay. This so-
lution is not going to solve anything 
except disarming law-abiding citizens, 
meanwhile knowing that the criminals 
that are willing to disregard the law 
and use the weapon to kill somebody 
are certainly going to disregard the 
law and maintain that weapon when 
you tell all law-abiding citizens that 
they must turn theirs in. 
Mr. Speaker, this cannot stand. We 
are here today to say that no matter 
what happens down the hall, no matter 
what vote they bring out of that par-
tisan-led committee to disarm Amer-
ica, we will oppose it with every fiber 
of our being. We will oppose it. 
Even if we lose on this round, in 6 
months, when we are in the majority 
around here, if they were to be success-
ful in imposing this confiscation on 
American citizens, the confiscation of 
not only the rights to life but the 
rights to self-defense, we will reinstate 
them. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. GOOD) for carrying 
the load for us here. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Chairman PERRY. 
Chairman PERRY, have you ever been 
asked by the media about a police offi-
cer killed in the line of duty? Have 
they ever asked you about that shoot-
ing? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY) for the 
purpose of a colloquy. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Faulkner was killed 
in Philadelphia by Mumia Abu-Jamal, 
and all they usually ask me about that 
is: What are we going to do to get that 
killer out of prison? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. I am never 
asked about the 100 police officers 
killed last year in the line of duty. 
Mr. PERRY. Right. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. I am never 
asked about the police officers who are 
shot in America’s largest cities, as you 
have mentioned. I am never asked by 
the media about that. 
I am never asked about the hundreds 
of shootings that take place every 
weekend in America’s largest cities, 
these war zones, these crime zones that 
are under Democrat control. 
There is always a connection here. 
These are cities that have been con-
trolled by Democrats. These are Demo-
crat policies carried to their conclu-
sion. 
What they are trying to do to the en-
tire country, which has been in place 
much longer in these major cities—you 
mentioned Baltimore, Detroit, Chi-
cago, St. Louis, on and on, New Orle-
ans, and so forth. That is where most of 
the crime is in this country. That is 
where most of the shootings take place 
in this country, and they don’t care 
about that. 
Do they want to harden our schools? 
Do they want to do what is necessary 
to keep our kids safe? 
I have long been an advocate in my 
home State of Virginia, the community 
where I served as a county supervisor, 
in allowing armed personnel within the 
school system who are trained and 
want to carry concealed and be part of 
a rapid response team, teachers and 
staff, to be armed in the schools to 
keep the children and the staff safe. 
The Democrats are against that. 
We all know the truth. Mr. NORMAN 
from South Carolina mentioned this a 
moment ago. The best response to a 
bad guy with a gun is a good guy with 
a gun. The best response is more good 
people with guns, more law-abiding 
citizens with guns, as the Founders 
wrote and intended and as the Found-
ers recognized 250 years ago when we 
didn’t have this violent crime in Amer-
ica’s largest cities. 
If the Second Amendment is not safe, 
then no other right is safe. There is a 
reason why the Second Amendment 
comes right after that First Amend-
ment guarantee to speech, free speech, 
to free assembly, to free worship, to pe-
tition our government for our griev-
ances. It is that Second Amendment 
right to keep us safe, to ensure we re-
main a free people. 
If you look around the world, if you 
look at the nation of Ukraine, Ukraine 
would be a different place today if the 
citizens were armed and permitted to 
be armed the way we are here in this 
country. Taiwan would be a much safer 
country today from the threat of its 
large enemy on its border if their citi-
zens were armed the way our citizens 
are armed today. 
The Founders recognized in their wis-
dom that not only did we possess a 
God-given right to defend ourselves, to 
keep ourselves and our families safe, 
but also that we would be unique 
among the nations of the world in en-
shrining that in our Constitution and 
protecting that right and saying that 
Congress has no authority to infringe 
on that right for law-abiding citizens. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, my good 
friend from Virginia is absolutely 
right. That is our duty here. 
People think that the Federal Gov-
ernment maybe is supposed to provide 
so many things. I am sure that every 
one of us has different visitors that 
come in and ask us what the Federal 
Government can provide for them. 
What this government was set up for 
by our Founders—and, unfortunately, 
many of our citizens don’t know it—is 
to provide us with the rights that have 
been given to us by God and to defend 
them. That is what we are supposed to 
be doing here. 
Right down the hall, it is not about 
making sure that we maintain our 
rights to defend ourselves, to maintain 
the rights that everybody in that room 
swore an oath in the Constitution to 
uphold and defend. They are actually 
looking to strip the very people that 
are law-abiding, the very people that 
would follow the law, would purchase 
the weapon legally, would file the pa-
perwork and do everything that is re-
quired in their States. Those are the 
people that they wish to disarm. 
They are not in there talking about 
stopping criminals. They are not talk-
ing about stopping criminals. They are 
talking about stopping law-abiding 
citizens who are trying to defend them-
selves when somebody breaks into 
their home at night or their store or 
prevails upon them on the street when 
they are out with their children or, 
heaven forbid, our citizens dare to 
travel to one of these cities anymore. 
I represent a company in my district 
called Starbucks. Their CEO is closing 
stores all across the northwest of our 
country because of safety. People want 
to go to Starbucks. They can’t because 
it is not going to be there anymore, not 
because of sales, but because of safety. 
If that is not a sign of a sickness— 
and the CEO of Starbucks, I don’t 
know that he thinks that the answer is 
an assault weapons ban. Maybe he 
does. But I haven’t heard of the 
Starbucks being held up by an assault 
weapon. 
Every 
single 
week, 
every 
single 
weekend, people are killed in major 
cities, horrific violence, perpetrated 
whether it is with a knife or whether it 
is with a handgun. But it is the people 
that do it. These are inanimate objects. 
Great Britain banned handguns a long 
time ago and is now considering ban-
ning knives because knife attacks are 
on the increase.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6920 
July 20, 2022 
Our country has a sickness, and we 
are sympathetic to it. But taking the 
tool away doesn’t address the sickness. 
Unfortunately, our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle are so focused on 
the firearm that they can’t even see 
past the fact that they are disavowing 
their oath to the Constitution. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania for his comments. 
The first 10 amendments to the Con-
stitution were intended to protect the 
individual, the people, from the gov-
ernment. The Constitution protects the 
individual, the minority, from the tyr-
anny of the majority. 
There is a reason why we are not a 
democracy. We are a representative re-
public based on the rule of law, based 
on a Constitution that would ensure 
that we remain free, that would ensure 
that we protect the rights of the indi-
vidual. 
The number one job of the Federal 
Government, that we have gotten so 
far away from here in this body, is to 
keep us safe and secure. Part of that is 
to ensure that our rights are safe and 
secure, and that includes the right to 
defend ourselves. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, the right 
to defend ourselves. Mr. GOOD and I, 
our colleagues on this side of the aisle, 
we haven’t voted to defund the police. 
We support law enforcement. 
Even though we support fully law en-
forcement, here is what we know: When 
someone breaks into your home and 
you pick up your phone, it is going to 
take a certain amount of time, unless 
law enforcement is sitting out in your 
driveway. You are going to have to do 
something about it at that moment. 
What our colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle right now are telling us is: 
No, you are not going to have any op-
portunity. You are not going to have 
any ability to do anything about it. 
You can use harsh language. I sup-
pose you can throw the lamp that is on 
your bed stand in self-defense, but that 
doesn’t stop the assailant’s bullets that 
are coming into your home for who 
knows what reason. 
Mr. Speaker, we deserve—because we 
have earned the right to defend our-
selves. We live in America. We have a 
Constitution that we live under. It out-
lines our rights as ordained by the 
Good Lord above. We cannot have this 
Congress and man take them away 
from us. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time.

Let us pray. 
Eternal Redeemer, answer us in sea-
sons of trouble. Send us Your help from 
Your sacred hills. Our souls long for 
You, for we find strength and joy in

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
DISCLOSE ACT 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, with our country facing an in-
flation crisis, a violent crime crisis, 
and a functionally open southern bor-
der, our Democratic colleagues are 
choosing to focus on chilling Ameri-
cans’ First Amendment rights and ena-
bling more harassment of citizens for 
their private views. 
Way back in 1958, the NAACP fought 
Alabama’s attorney general, a segrega-
tionist Democrat, all the way to the 
Supreme Court to defend the bedrock 
American liberty of associational pri-
vacy—associational privacy. Here is 
what Justice Harlan said for the major-
ity back then: 
Inviolability of privacy in group associa-
tion may in many circumstances be indis-
pensable to preservation of freedom of asso-
ciation, particularly where a group espouses 
dissident beliefs. 
As the majority opinion put it, this 
was ‘‘hardly a novel exception,’’ even 
back in 1958. And yet, for most of my 
career, I have had to push back against 
Democrats’ 
repeated 
attempts 
to 
unlearn this fundamental constitu-
tional lesson. I have repeatedly de-
fended Americans’ right to join to-
gether and to voice their opinions. 
Prior to McCain-Feingold, almost all 
money in politics ran through can-
didates 
and 
party 
committees. 
I 
warned that placing unconstitutional 
restrictions on speech in that bill was 
like putting a rock on Jell-O—it 
wouldn’t quash political speech; it 
would just displace it. And the Su-
preme 
Court 
has 
consistently 
re-
affirmed that point in case after case, 
upholding free speech. 
Our Democratic colleagues’ obsession 
with regulating political speech is 
what created the environment they 
now disprove of. It is what drove sup-
port for McCain-Feingold, and it is 
what spawned this perennial bill in 
2010. 
Democrats want to pass a law that 
puts discourse in the hands of the mob. 
But needless to say, they haven’t al-
ways been very concerned with compel-
ling disclosure using laws on the books. 
Existing law already requires disclo-
sure of donations to PACs and other 
outside groups with the intention of in-
fluencing Federal elections. But even 
as our colleagues have introduced suc-
cessive versions of the DISCLOSE Act, 
enterprising 
activist 
liberals 
have 
taken it upon themselves to name and 
shame conservatives by ‘‘outing’’ their

private contributions illegally. It was 
practically administration policy dur-
ing the Obama-Biden IRS. 
And for those keeping score, Wash-
ington Democrats never seemed as 
eager to publicize the donor rolls of 
groups whose political views they hap-
pen to share. Somehow, donor privacy 
for 
organizations 
pursuing 
liberal 
causes is sacrosanct, but donor privacy 
for groups with conservative beliefs is 
a threat to democracy. 
Somehow working for outside groups 
is practically a prerequisite for a West 
Wing job under a Democratic Presi-
dent, 
but 
association 
with 
groups 
Democrats don’t like is a one-way tick-
et to picketing and harassment. Sixty- 
four years ago, the Supreme Court said 
the link between freedom of associa-
tion and the freedom of speech was 
‘‘beyond debate.’’ But today’s Demo-
cratic Party wants to make sure the 
threat to associational privacy is every 
bit as real—as real—as it was in 1958. 
The stakes are so clear; even liberal 
groups like the ACLU have joined the 
NAACP and Senate Republicans in con-
tinuing to sound the alarm—ACLU, 
NAACP, 
and 
Senate 
Republicans 
aligned, sounding the alarm. They have 
been working together to fight State- 
level public disclosure laws all the way 
to the Supreme Court. 
Last year, the Court sided with those 
advocates to strike down predatory dis-
closure practices out in California. 
Earlier this month, the Ninth Circuit 
did the same to an unconstitutionally 
vague disclosure law out in Montana. 
Meanwhile, the Federal judiciary 
itself is contending with particularly 
outrageous threats from the radical 
left to the privacy and security of the 
judges themselves and their families. 
The same liberal groups stoking mob 
intimidation outside the homes of Su-
preme Court Justices are the ones most 
eager to put out private citizens’ polit-
ical speech records. 
The same Democrats who refused to 
condemn naked threats against public 
officials earlier this summer once 
again want to expand the Federal Gov-
ernment’s power to threaten private 
citizens. That is not a trade the Amer-
ican people or their Constitution can 
afford to make. 
ENERGY AND FOREIGN POLICY 
Mr. President, now on another mat-
ter, right now, Washington Democrats 
are frustrated by the pace of the rad-
ical green transformation they envi-
sion for our country. They are having 
trouble getting enough Senators to 
agree to make the most reliable and 
abundant forms of American energy 
more expensive for working Americans. 
Energy prices are rising faster than 
at any point since 1980. Gasoline is 
nearly 60 percent more expensive than 
it was last summer. Natural gas is up 
nearly 40 percent in the same time-
frame. 
Washington 
Democrats 
have 
sur-
veyed this scene and decided it is the 
perfect time—perfect time—to hike 
taxes on American energy, reviving a 
failed tax from the 1980s on American 
oil refineries and exporters and—listen 
to this—increasing it by nearly 60 per-
cent, new sky-high fees on American 
natural gas producers and more pain at 
the pump for working families. It is an 
insane proposition. 
But there does appear to be an excep-
tion. If you are not among the 75 per-
cent of Americans who say inflation 
has caused you financial hardship, and 
you happen to have a spare $80,000 
lying around, Washington Democrats 
want to give you a green energy tax 
credit if you buy an electric vehicle 
made with Chinese supply chains. This 
is what Washington Democrats are try-
ing to do with their one-party control 
of government, and they are hoping 
President Biden will declare a national 
emergency to help them do it faster. 
Well, unfortunately for the far left, 
the President is occupied with a cli-
mate conundrum of his own. On the 
campaign trail, Candidate Biden left no 
room for doubt that he had bought his 
party’s radical climate dogma, whole 
hog. This is what he said back then: 
I guarantee you we are going to end fossil 
fuel. 
‘‘End fossil fuel.’’ Sure enough, his 
first year in office was an all-out as-
sault on American energy, just like 
green activists drew it up—day 1 bans 
on energy exploration; canceling a safe, 
efficient pipeline that was set to create 
American jobs; and ghoulish, reani-
mated regulations from the War on 
Coal. 
But unlike the radical base that is 
frustrated their ideas aren’t moving 
faster, the Biden administration now 
appears to be concerned that their as-
sault on American energy has actually 
worked too quickly. 
Americans have seen gas prices dou-
ble on this President’s watch. Sky-high 
diesel is driving other prices up all 
across the country, and big majorities 
of Americans don’t like what Demo-
crats are doing about it. But rather 
than call off the onslaught and clear 
the way for a return to domestic en-
ergy dominance, the Biden administra-
tion has dispatched officials to beg 
other countries to take over America’s 
share of the market for reliable energy 
that the President has purposely aban-
doned. They have literally chosen 
places like Venezuela over States like 
Pennsylvania or Texas or Alaska. 
Then, on a trip to oil-rich Saudi Ara-
bia, President Biden announced that 
‘‘I’m doing all I can to increase [oil] 
supply for the United States of Amer-
ica.’’ 
The 
President 
who 
promised 
he 
would ‘‘end fossil fuels’’ thinks that 
finding more energy for American fam-
ilies means flying to the Middle East 
and 
asking 
politely 
instead 
of 
unleashing our own production right 
here at home. 
And for the record, U.S. producers ex-
tract oil and gas in a far, far more en-
vironmentally friendly manner than 
many of their competitors overseas. So 
if the priority is reducing our environ-
mental 
impact, 
outsourcing 
seems 
more than a little bit shortsighted. 
So, Mr. President, if the Biden ad-
ministration really is serious about 
helping 
American 
consumers, 
then 
they will stop waging war on American 
producers. If they are serious, they will 
call off Democrats’ plan to tax reliable 
American energy into extinction. 
For the sake of working families who 
are struggling to fill their gas tanks 
and keep the lights on, I hope they get 
serious sometime soon. 
NATO 
Mr. President, on yet another mat-
ter, yesterday, a day after the House 
overwhelmingly passed a resolution 
welcoming Finland and Sweden’s appli-
cation to join NATO, the Senate For-
eign Relations Committee discharged 
the treaty protocols required to ratify 
their accession, without objection. I 
am grateful to Ranking Member RISCH, 
Chairman MENENDEZ, and our col-
leagues on the committee for taking 
this swift, bipartisan action. The Sen-
ate is now one step closer to fulfilling 
its role in a historic process that will 
further strengthen the most successful 
military alliance the world has ever 
seen. 
Bringing these strong, modern coun-
tries into NATO will not just strength-
en the alliance; it will make America 
more secure. I hope the Democratic 
leader will waste no time—none—in 
bringing these protocols before the full 
Senate. 
I have been a strong advocate for 
American global leadership and our 
transatlantic partnerships throughout 
my career. They have made possible 
the unprecedented era of peace and 
prosperity Americans have experienced 
in my lifetime. 
NATO is at its best when allies share 
the burden of our collective security, 
when we all have skin in the game. 
NATO allies recognized in 2014, after 
prodding by American Presidents from 
both parties, that they needed to in-
vest more in capabilities to keep pace 
with growing threats. 
During the previous administration, 
current member states made progress 
toward the 2-percent pledge. Finland, 
for its part, already spends 2 percent of 
its GDP on defense, and Sweden has 
the same target in its sights. For 
years, both countries have participated 
actively in NATO exercises. They have 
cultivated professional fighting forces, 
invested in cutting-edge interoperable 
technologies, and built robust mili-
tary-industrial bases with strong con-
nections to our own. 
I know from my own conversation 
with the leaders of Finland and Sweden 
that they are sober about the threats 
we face, committed to building their 
own defense capabilities, and serious 
about their responsibilities to con-
tribute to our collective security. To-
gether, they have set an example that 
many current treaty allies would do 
well to follow.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3505 
July 20, 2022 
With Finland and Sweden at the 
table, I look forward to important de-
liberations about the capabilities we 
need as an alliance and the steps we 
must urgently take to defend ourselves 
against growing threats from Russia, 
China, and other adversaries. 
Mr. President, I know from my visits 
with our Swedish and Finnish friends 
that they hope for rapid accession to 
NATO. They are ready to get to work 
alongside us as allies. With war raging 
on the European continent, I share 
their sense of urgency, and I urge the 
Democratic leader to call up the nec-
essary Senate votes without further 
delay. 
But that can’t be the Senate’s last 
word on how America and our allies 
face down a dangerous world. We also 
need to take urgent action on the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act. Rus-
sia is laying siege to a sovereign neigh-
bor. China is flexing a rapidly modern-
izing military. Reckless pariah states 
like Iran and North Korea are doubling 
down on developing dangerous weap-
ons. It is past time—past time—to take 
America’s own defense requirements 
more seriously. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before 
I begin, I want to say something about 
the House-passed Respect for Marriage 
Act, which would enshrine marriage 
equality into Federal law, which I fully 
and strongly support. 
This legislation is so important. I 
was really impressed by how much bi-
partisan support it got in the House. It 
passed 267 to 157. Forty-seven Repub-
licans—about a quarter, a little less 
than a quarter of their caucus; maybe 
a fifth—voted for the bill. The legisla-
tion is so important. 
I spoke to Senator BALDWIN, who is 
one of the leaders of this legislation in 
the Senate, this morning, and she is 
talking to Republicans to see where 
the support is. I want to bring this bill 
to the floor, and we are working to get 
the necessary Senate Republican sup-
port to ensure it would pass. 
CHIPS ACT 
Madam President, now on the chips 
bill, last night, the Senate passed a 
critical threshold on our way to pass-
ing major legislation to lower costs, in-
crease manufacturing, strengthen sup-
ply chains, and preserve American 
competitiveness in the 21st century. 
I want everyone to note the final 
margin of last night’s vote: 64 to 34. 
That is a clear signal that after a lot of 
hard work and after a lot of com-
promise from both sides, the path is 
clear for this chips-plus bill to reach 
final passage. This has been bipartisan 
work in the Senate at its best, just as 
we saw previously with bills ranging 
from gun safety to hate crimes, to in-
frastructure, to VAWA and so much 
more. 
I thank my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle for voting in favor of mov-
ing forward on this critical bill. 
For the information of all, today I 
plan to file cloture on this legislation, 
which after last night’s vote includes 
incentives for domestic microchip pro-
duction, including ITC; support for our 
wireless communication supply chain, 
ORAN; and the science package, which 
includes many of the provisions I au-
thored in the Endless Frontier Act in 
partnership with Senator YOUNG
2 
years ago. It has been a long struggle 
to get these vital pieces of legislation 
moving forward, and now they are. 
I hope we can get this legislation ap-
proved as soon as possible because now 
it is clear it has enough support to pass 
this Chamber. 
For all the many good things the bill 
does, the most important is that this 
legislation will help our country fight 
inflation in the long run. People are 
asking about inflation, as they should. 
This bill will help. America’s chip 
shortage, exacerbated by the pandemic, 
has sent tremors across the entire 
economy and caused prices for all sorts 
of electronic goods to go up and up and 
up, and not only for electronic goods— 
cars, appliances, phones. But with this 
bill, we can make America a major 
chip producer once again, which will 
help ease pressures on our supply 
chains, strengthen our national secu-
rity, and generate another wave of 
American economic activity for years 
to come. 
Thanks to last night’s robust vote, 
we will also move forward on the 
science provisions that many of us 
have worked on very hard to pass into 
law. We will increase funding for the 
National Science Foundation and in-
vest billions to develop new tech hubs 
around the country in areas that 
haven’t had the benefit of new tech em-
ployment. This will all help America 
lead the way in developing tech-
nologies of tomorrow. Many more dol-
lars than ever before are going into the 
cutting-edge 
technologies—AI, 
ad-
vanced manufacturing, renewable en-
ergy, quantum computing, cyber secu-
rity, 5G, and so much more. When we 
invest in the science here, we create 
millions of new, good-paying jobs and 
ensure that America will be the leader 
in these cutting-edge issues, which will 
dominate the 21st-century economy. 
For the sake of lowering costs, for 
the sake of American jobs, and for the 
sake of our national security interests, 
let’s pass this bill as soon as we can. 
And that is my intention. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Madam President, now on prescrip-
tion drugs and healthcare, from one 
corner to the other, another issue of in-
flation is the high cost of drugs. At 
every pharmacy counter and doctor’s 
office, grocery store, and kitchen table, 
the issue that remains front of mind 
for American families is the cost of liv-
ing. While finally we are beginning to 
see relief as some gas prices are falling, 
inflation 
undeniably 
continues 
to 
strain families not just in America but 
around the world. 
In one crucial area of life, high costs 
are simply unsustainable: the cost of 
healthcare and prescription drugs. The 
nexus of the high cost and the neces-
sity of these drugs to keep us healthy 
and keep us living is a pincer that 
pinches so many Americans in a very 
harmful way. 
But this week, the Senate will for-
mally present our case to the Parlia-
mentarian on a number of long-sought 
reforms to our Nation’s healthcare sys-
tem that will lower costs for tens of 
millions of Americans. 
Under our proposals, for the first 
time ever, we will empower Medicare 
to negotiate the prices of prescription 
drugs in Parts B and D. We will cap 
out-of-pocket expenses for Part D pre-
cision drugs at $2,000 a year, giving 
millions of Americans—many of whom 
have serious health problems and need 
these drugs—the support they des-
perately need so they can afford these 
drugs. Two thousand a year—that is it. 
The days of seniors paying tens of 
thousands of dollars per year or for-
going medicine altogether will soon be 
over. And we will prevent healthcare 
premiums from spiking for tens of mil-
lions of people. 
In addition, there is an inflation 
rider, so that once the company an-
nounces the price of a new drug, they 
can’t just double it and double it and 
double it year after year, even after 
they have recouped their investment in 
the bill. 
Lowering costs of prescription drugs, 
capping out-of-pocket expenses, keep-
ing premiums low—these are the top 
priorities for the American people. Ask 
any American on the street, and it is a 
near guarantee they will agree that ris-
ing drug costs is a serious problem. So 
we have to address the issue head-on. 
Now, of course, Democrats will keep 
working on other major challenges 
that face our Nation. Our work on cli-
mate change is not done. We are going 
to work with President Biden’s admin-
istration to fight climate change and 
protect our planet for the next genera-
tion. This is an existential threat to 
the globe, and we are going to keep 
fighting. 
So, in the coming weeks, our caucus 
is going to be exceedingly busy as we 
finalize a reconciliation bill that can 
pass with the full support of our cau-
cus. We still have a lot of work to do. 
Nobody says it is going to be simple or 
easy, 
but 
lowering 
the 
costs 
of 
healthcare and prescription drugs will 
make an enormous difference in the 
lives of the American people. Let’s get 
it done and give Americans a much 
needed and long-awaited break.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3506 
July 20, 2022 
News host Tucker Carlson began his 
prime time show with another de-
ranged rant on the conspiracy theory 
known as the ‘‘great replacement.’’ 
This racist theory, which asserts that a 
conspiracy exists to replace White 
Americans with immigrants and people 
of color, motivated a White suprema-
cist to gun down 10 Black Americans in 
a grocery store in my home State of 
New York, in Buffalo, just over 2 
months ago. 
Here is what Mr. CARLson said last 
night, among many deranged things. 
These are his words: 
Sometime around 1965, our leaders stopped 
trying to make the United States a hos-
pitable place for American citizens, their 
constituents, to have their own families. . . . 
They just imported new people. That’s lit-
erally what happened. 
Can you believe someone said that on 
a national network and the network 
does nothing about it? 
There is only one way to describe 
what Mr. CARLson is doing: He is stok-
ing racial resentment among his view-
ers. It is deranged. It is dangerous. It is 
racist. 
Not long ago, views like ‘‘replace-
ment theory’’ were only found in the 
darkest places in disturbed minds. Now 
someone as prominent as Carlson is 
spreading night after night to an audi-
ence that often tops 3 million viewers. 
And it is not an isolated incident. Ac-
cording to one measure by the New 
York Times, Mr. CARLson has spewed 
rhetoric that echoes ‘‘replacement the-
ory’’ at least 400 times on his show 
since 2016—400 times. This is not a one- 
off, what he just did last night. 
The more that MAGA radicals like 
Carlson spread ‘‘replacement theory,’’ 
it is not out of the question that ra-
cially motivated violence will further 
ignite the country. FOX News should 
be ashamed that they are enabling 
these racist views and giving them an 
enormous platform on their network. 
It is dangerous and un-American for 
one of the biggest news networks in the 
world to amplify conspiracy theories 
that are eerily similar to those cited 
by the Buffalo shooter. 
I urge Carlson to stop spreading ‘‘re-
placement theory’’ or else risk seeing 
more tragedies like the one we saw in 
Buffalo last month. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, one of 
the most important bills that we take 
up every year is the National Defense 
Authorization Act, or NDAA, legisla-
tion authorizing funding for our mili-
tary men and women and the defense of 
our country. 
The Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee passed this year’s bipartisan 
bill a month ago, and we have less than 
2 months of floor time left in the fiscal 
year. 
The Senate Democrats’ focus this 
month is on a last-ditch effort to pass 
some version of their Build Back Bet-
ter tax-and-spending spree in hopes, I 
have to assume, of eking out a few 
more votes in November. Apparently, 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act will just have to wait. 
As it does every year, this year’s 
NDAA authorizes funding for critical 
military priorities. The fiscal year 2023 
NDAA continues the modernization ef-
forts begun several years ago in the 
wake of the 2018 National Defense 
Strategy Commission report, which 
warned that our Nation’s readiness had 
eroded to the point where we might 
struggle to win a war against a major 
power like Russia or China. 
It authorizes funding to improve 
quality of life for our military mem-
bers and their families, which is not 
only something we owe these men and 
women who sacrifice so much for us 
but is also essential for recruiting and 
retaining members of our all-volunteer 
force. It authorizes funding to enhance 
our nuclear deterrence, a key priority 
with continued nuclear threats from 
traditional powers like Russia and 
rogue states like Iran and North Korea. 
And it continues our strong support 
for Ukraine. Ukraine no longer domi-
nates every front page, but for 5 
months now, Ukraine has been fighting 
a heroic war against Russian aggres-
sion. Thanks to support from allies in 
Europe and from our own country, 
Ukraine is still holding out. In a war 
that many experts thought could see 
Kyiv fall within a matter of days, 
Ukraine is approaching day 150 of re-
sisting Vladimir Putin’s Soviet-style 
aggression. In fact, Ukraine continues 
to strike painful blows against the 
Russian 
military, 
which 
has 
now 
turned to Iran for military support. 
Later today, Olena Zelenska, wife of 
Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, will be 
addressing Congress. She and her hus-
band have been a beacon for Ukrain-
ians during this brutal war; and Presi-
dent Zelenskyy’s iron determination, 
his tireless leadership, and his unflag-
ging commitment to his people inspire 
all those who love freedom. 
Ukraine is, in many ways, standing 
up for the whole free world right now, 
sending the message that Russia’s 
unprovoked aggression will not be al-
lowed to stand. And the least we and 
other free nations can do is ensure they 
have the resources they need to carry 
out their fight. Russia’s war against 
Ukraine reminds us that nations that 
value freedom and security must stand 
together. 
Finland and Sweden are looking to 
stand with other free nations by join-
ing the NATO alliance. Vladimir Putin 
has turned the historic positions of 
neutrality in Finland and Sweden into 
robust public support to join the alli-
ance, and both of these countries will 
strengthen 
the 
capabilities 
and 
geostrategic position of NATO. 
Yesterday, the Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations reported the treaty 
concerning their accession to NATO, 
and I hope the Senate and administra-
tion will soon complete their respec-
tive roles and approve Finland and 
Sweden’s membership. 
One priority for me in every National 
Defense Authorization Act is ensuring 
that the men and women of Ellsworth 
Air Force Base in South Dakota have 
everything they need to successfully 
carry out their mission. Right now, my 
priority is ensuring Ellsworth remains 
a responsive and lethal component of 
global strike command, with the B–1 
bomber leveraging the Joint Air-to- 
Surface Standoff Missile and its Long 
Range Anti-Ship Missile derivative. 
As we look to the future, I am work-
ing to ensure the base continues to re-
ceive full funding for the many equip-
ment and support facilities that will be 
needed for the B–21 Raider mission at 
Ellsworth. I worked to ensure full fund-
ing for the first of these facilities in 
last year’s NDAA, including a low-ob-
servable coating restoration facility, a 
wash rack and maintenance hangar, an 
expanded flight simulator facility, and 
more. 
This year’s NDAA continues that 
work with additional funding for the 
low-observable coating restoration fa-
cility, as well as funding for two addi-
tional construction projects—a weap-
ons generation facility and a radio fre-
quency facility—that will be needed to 
ensure Ellsworth is fully able to con-
duct the nuclear and stealth B–21 mis-
sions. 
I have had the privilege of visiting 
the B–21 production site in Palmdale, 
CA. And while the program remains 
heavily classified, I can say the six 
planes under production are impressive 
feats of American engineering and that 
we are honored that South Dakota will 
be the first State to host the mission. 
But it is not just about the hardware 
and cutting-edge systems. Our greatest 
asset is our people, including the pi-
lots, the maintainers, and all of the 
men and women who have answered the 
call to serve. That is why I am focused 
on ensuring our men and women in uni-
form have not just the military sup-
port they need but the support they 
need for their families. 
More military families will be mov-
ing into the Ellsworth area with the 
arrival of the B–21 mission—as many as 
250 people per year, including 100 de-
pendents. I am committed to ensuring 
that the infrastructure is in place to 
provide ample facilities for these fami-
lies. 
To that end, I worked to include in 
this year’s NDAA an extension of an 
authority for the Secretary of Defense 
to adjust basic allowance for housing 
rates if an installation is experiencing 
a sudden increase in the number of 
servicemembers assigned there. This 
will ensure that families at Ellsworth

and elsewhere will have the resources 
they need to secure appropriate accom-
modations. 
I am also working to ensure that the 
Douglas School District is able to inte-
grate and support Air Force members’ 
children and provide sufficient class-
room space. This NDAA would provide 
$15 million in impact aid for schools 
experiencing force structure changes 
like the anticipated growth at Ells-
worth with the arrival of the B–21 mis-
sion. 
I am grateful to Senator ROUNDS for 
his assistance getting this through the 
committee’s markup and to our State’s 
at-large Representative, Congressman 
JOHNSON, for his work to get it in-
cluded in the House-passed bill. This 
expanded program should be a good 
first step to help ensure that Douglas 
School District is able to expand to 
meet the needs of new Ellsworth fami-
lies. 
The House of Representatives, to its 
credit, voted on its version of the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act the 
other day. But, unfortunately, the 
House legislation’s total funding au-
thorization is lower than the Senate 
bill’s number. That is a concern, not 
only because we have a lot of priorities 
to fund but because inflation is cur-
rently 
cutting 
into 
the 
military’s 
spending power. 
Inflation affects American families 
and businesses, but it also has a serious 
effect on our Nation’s security. As 
prices soar across the economy, the 
military is able to do less with the dol-
lars that it has and that can affect 
troop readiness and the military’s abil-
ity to keep up with needed programs 
and purchases, from weapons to vehi-
cles to aircraft and ships. 
It is essential that the final House 
and Senate bill include the Senate’s 
top-line funding number. 
In his 1793 annual message to Con-
gress, George Washington said: 
There is a rank due to the United States 
among nations which will be withheld, if not 
absolutely lost, by the reputation of weak-
ness. If we desire to avoid insult, we must be 
able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, 
one of the most powerful instruments of our 
rising prosperity, it must be known that we 
are at all times ready for war. 
In 
other 
words, 
‘‘Peace 
through 
strength.’’ 
These words hold true in every age. 
The surest method of securing peace is 
ensuring we are prepared for war. As 
Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine 
reminds us, there will always be na-
tions who threaten peace and freedom. 
And the surest way to prevent these 
powers from destroying freedom is to 
ensure that we present a powerful 
threat of our own, a credible deterrent 
that stops these nations and other bad 
actors from wanting to tangle with us. 
There is no more a certain way to in-
vite war than to be unprepared to meet 
the bullies and the dictators of the 
world. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act is one of the most essential pieces 
of legislation we take up each year be-
cause it helps ensure that our Nation is 
equipped to defend itself and to deter 
aggression. 
I hope that the Democratic leader-
ship will consider deferring its tax-and- 
spending plans to take up this impor-
tant national security legislation in 
the near future. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from New Hamp-
shire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that in addition to 
myself, both Senators GRASSLEY and 
CARPER be permitted to speak for up to 
10 minutes each before the scheduled 
vote. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO JEAN TOAL EISEN 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today as the current 
chair of the Senate Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, 
Science, and Related Agencies because 
I want to pay tribute to the clerk who 
has worked with me for the last 6 years 
but who has been in public service here 
for the Federal Government for 27 
years, including 26 years of service in 
the U.S. Senate, and that is Jean Toal 
Eisen, who is going to be retiring from 
the Federal Government. 
And Jean is here along with two 
other members of the staff of the CJS 
Subcommittee, Blaise Sheridan and 
Michael Bednarczyk, as well as three 
members of my staff, Ariel Marshall, 
Janelle 
DiLuccia, 
and 
Chad 
Kreikemeier, my chief of staff. 
We are here because we think it is 
important, and I especially think it is 
important to recognize the people who 
make this body run. And it is people 
like Jean, who have dedicated their 
whole careers to this institution, who 
allow us to—who mean that we can, on 
occasion, get things done that make a 
huge difference for the people of this 
country. 
And I know I speak for all the mem-
bers of the Appropriations Committee 
and its staff when I say that Jean will 
be sorely missed. 
Just last week, as I looked at the 
breathtaking images captured from 
NASA’s 
James 
Webb 
telescope, 
I 
thought about Jean. It is no exaggera-
tion to say that those images exist, in 
no small part, because of her work on 
this subcommittee. And they serve as a 
fitting capstone for her distinguished 
career. 
And, of course, then I thought about 
other ways that Jean’s influence will 
endure, ensuring millions of people will 
get access to broadband because of her 
work on the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act—and there were many 
late nights that she and other members 
of my staff and Senator COLLINS’ staff 
worked with the Commerce Depart-
ment to try and ensure we could get 
those broadband sections done—and 
then also helping survivors of domestic 
violence, sexual assault, and child 
abuse receive access to critical services 
because of Jean’s successful efforts to 
release more resources from the Crime 
Victims Fund. In fact, every year that 
I have been chair of Commerce, Jus-
tice, and Science, because of Jean’s ef-
forts, we have maximized funding in 
the Office of Violence Against Women 
so that each year over year we have 
done better. 
She has also been there to ensure 
that the next generation of STEM 
innovators and leaders get record in-
vestments in the National Science 
Foundation and NASA. And it is really 
appropriate that we are considering bi-
partisan chips innovation legislation 
on the floor this week, Jean’s last in 
the Senate, because she played a cen-
tral role drafting and negotiating this 
critical legislation that will bolster 
American manufacturing and protect 
our national security interests. 
And though Jean will no longer be in 
the Senate, her legacy is already felt 
everywhere, and the American people 
are better for it. Jean’s journey in the 
Senate began as a staff assistant for 
Senator Ernest Hollings of South Caro-
lina, her home State Senator. 
Later, she served on the staff of the 
Senate 
Committee 
on 
Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation as senior 
adviser and deputy policy director for 
Chairman Dan Inouye, before serving 
as deputy policy director at the U.S. 
Department of Commerce. 
And since 2010, she has served on the 
CJS Subcommittee, and from 2014 to 
2017, she was the deputy staff director 
of the Senate Committee on Appropria-
tions for Chair Barbara Mikulski, who 
I know if she were here would also be 
on the floor to sing Jean’s praises. 
I have had the pleasure of having 
Jean as my clerk since 2017, when I 
took over the CJS Subcommittee as 
Vice Chair. And I think that words 
really can’t capture Jean’s personality, 
but I would be doing a disservice to 
this body if I didn’t try to give a sense 
of why Jean is one of the most effective 
staffers on Capitol Hill. 
And I think the first thing to know is 
that Jean always gives you the truth— 
whether you want to hear it or not. 
The second thing to know about her is 
that she always has a sense of humor, 
even when the going gets tough, and all 
of us who have been here through 
tough challenges know that maintain-
ing a sense of humor is absolutely crit-
ical. 
Her colleagues will remember her as 
incredibly knowledgeable, kind, and 
pragmatic because, at heart, Jean is a 
problem-solver. She understands that 
the U.S. Government is one of the most 
impressive institutions the world has 
ever seen, and she has dedicated her ca-
reer to improving it. 
Jean is also the proud mom of her 
daughter Pat, who is a rising sopho-
more at Longwood University and is, 
among other things, a saxophonist in 
the school’s ‘‘Stampede’’ Athletic Pep 
Band.

July 20, 2022 
Now that she is no longer drafting 
annual appropriations bills, we hope 
that Jean will have more quality time 
to spend with Pat, with her husband 
Pete, and with her many family mem-
bers and friends and maybe even a lit-
tle more time for hockey and gar-
dening. Although if she is going to sup-
port hockey, she really needs to sup-
port the Bruins, so we are not sure how 
much time we want to give her for 
that. 
But it gives me great joy to publicly 
thank Jean for her extraordinary work 
for this committee. Congratulations, 
Jean. Thank you for your decades of 
service to our country and your com-
mitment to the U.S. Senate. Neither 
your expertise nor your good humor 
will soon be replaced, but your work 
will not be forgotten anytime soon. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. HAGERTY. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

NOMINATION OF GREGORY BRIAN WILLIAMS 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I 
have the honor to rise in support of 
Greg Williams to serve as a judge on 
the U.S. District Court for the District 
of Delaware, one of the busiest and, we 
believe, most important district courts 
in our Nation. 
Before delving into what makes Dela-
ware’s district court such an essential 
part of the American economy and 
what makes Greg Williams an excep-
tional nominee to serve, in the words 
of the American Bar Association, they 
deem him ‘‘well qualified’’ to be a Fed-
eral judge. 
I want to share some background and 
the process that we use in Delaware for 
making recommendations to the Fed-
eral bench to the President. 
A few years ago my friend—and I call 
him 
my 
wingman—Senator 
CHRIS 
COONS and I had the opportunity to 
make recommendations to the White 
House for two vacancies on this same 
court. There was, at the time, a Presi-
dent of a different party, and the ma-
jority here was on the other side, not 
on this side at that time. 
Our process was simple then and was 
straightforward and borrowed heavily 
from the process that I used while serv-
ing as Governor of Delaware for 8 
years. Throughout those 8 years when I 
was privileged to serve as Governor, we 
relied on a judicial nominating com-
mission and charged them with a sim-
ple task. Basically, this was it: find the 
most qualified individuals, regardless 
of political party, make recommenda-
tions to the Governor for appointments 
to Delaware’s many important State 
courts, including our State supreme 
court and the court of chancery. 
We used a similar process for Federal 
district court vacancies. The process 
served Delaware well during those 8 
years, and I believe that the process 
Senator COONS and I have used now 
serves our Nation well, too, regardless 
of which political party controls the 
White House or the Senate. It has 
yielded 
yet 
another 
extraordinary 
nominee. That nominee is Greg Wil-
liams, a partner at Fox Rothschild. 
Former president of the Delaware 
State Bar Association and President 
Biden’s nominee to serve as the next 
judge on the U.S. District Court for 
Delaware. 
But Greg is more than a lawyer, 
much more. He is a father, a husband, 
a son, and a brother. In fact, he is the 
youngest brother in his family of five, 
with four older sisters, and I know they 
help to keep him on the straight and 
narrow much like my older sister did 
with me. 
Greg has been married to his high 
school sweetheart, Terina, for 27 years. 
Together, they have raised two chil-
dren in Delaware that any one of us 
would be proud to call our own. 
A Villanova Law School graduate, 
Greg has worked at one of top law 
firms in the Nation, Fox Rothschild, 
for the past 28 years. 
Through hard work and commitment 
to excellence, in 2003, Greg became the 
first 
African-American 
attorney 
to 
have been hired as an associate and 
then be named as a partner at Fox 
Rothschild. Greg learned those val-
ues—hard work and commitment to ex-
cellence—in part as a member of the 
U.S. Army Reserves, where he served 
from 1986 to 1994—part of those years 
when I was his commander in chief as 
Governor of the State of Delaware. 
After law school, Greg embarked on a 
successful legal career that has earned 
him the respect and admiration of 
Delaware’s highly regarded legal com-
munity. 
Greg has particular expertise in in-
tellectual property and business litiga-
tion, which make him particularly 
well-suited for the Delaware District 
Court. 
More than his professional qualifica-
tions, though, Greg is the personifica-
tion of the Golden Rule, which calls on 
us to treat one another the way we 
want to be treated. And, as a result, he 
is also the personification of judicial 
temperament in that courtroom—and 
any courtroom, for that matter. 
Like Senator COONS
and me and 
many of our colleagues, Greg is a per-
son of deep faith. He understands per-
sonally the words ‘‘Golden Rule’’ and 
what they mean. And if confirmed, I 
believe he will use that rule to guide 
him on the bench. 
Let me close by saying this: We have 
all probably heard a saying that is of-
tentimes used in relationship to an un-
dersized boxer—someone who punches 
above their weight. 
The Delaware District Court is one of 
the busiest courts in our country. It 
handles an array of cases related to in-
tellectual property law, patent law, 
bankruptcy law, and other specialized 
business cases that are critical to the 
functioning of our national economy. 
Like our small State, this court 
punches above its weight, and our 
nominee Greg Williams not only has 
the credentials and the temperament, 
but the strong work ethic that are nec-
essary for this court to continue to 
function as one of the most important 
district courts in our land. 
I consider it a privilege to give him 
my strongest possible endorsement, 
and I encourage my colleagues to join 
Senator COONS and me today in sup-
porting his nomination on the Senate 
floor. 
And with that, I don’t see if—I don’t 
know that our colleague—here comes 
Senator COONS, here to speak on behalf 
of this nominee as well. 
I will just say this: You know, we 
have judicial nominees come before us, 
not every day but often in this body. In 
some cases, the folks who are from the 
State where that nominee hails, they 
know them, have at least a passing 
knowledge of them, and have maybe 
met them. 
We have known Greg Williams for al-
most a quarter of a century. He is not 
just one of the finest lawyers in our 
State; he is one of the finest human 
beings in our State. 
It is an honor for me to join Senator 
COONS in suggesting his name to the 
President of this country. We are 
grateful the President actually sub-
mitted that name now to the U.S. Sen-
ate for our consideration. 
And with that, I am going to yield 
the floor. I see we have Senator CAS-
SIDY here. I don’t know if he has the 
opportunity to—no, he is going to wait 
for a while. 
I am going to just stop right here. 
Senator COONS stopped just briefly. I 
think he is going to be right back on 
the floor; and, hopefully, he will be 
able to pick up right where I—I will do 
the handoff to my colleague from Dela-
ware. 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent for 1 minute of 
floor time to speak to the impending 
nomination. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I would 
like to thank my colleague and senior 
Senator, my friend, Mr. TOM CARPER, 
who allows me to be his wingman here 
on the floor of the Senate and in our 
home State of Delaware. 
I just wanted to speak briefly to the 
outstanding qualifications of the nomi-
nee that will be before us in a moment, 
Greg Williams of Delaware. 
As a member of the Delaware Bar, as 
a member of the Judiciary Committee, 
I have joined my senior Senator, 
friend, and colleague in advancing this 
nomination, both suggesting to the 
White House strongly that he would be 
an excellent next member of the impor-
tant Federal bench in Delaware and

that he would represent our Nation 
well and contribute to our Federal ju-
diciary, which is globally the gold 
standard for its capability, its inde-
pendence, and its integrity. 
Greg has practiced for decades in 
Delaware. He is one of the best re-
spected, leading complex commercial 
litigators, and an experienced intellec-
tual property litigator. 
The District of Delaware is one of the 
busiest Federal courts in our entire 
country. Because of our unique place in 
American corporate law, because of the 
quality and the competence of our 
bench, we handle an enormous number 
of patent cases, a significant number of 
corporate cases. 
I don’t know if my colleague has 
mentioned one of the top-of-the-charts 
cases about to come to Delaware, but 
when you make a promise to purchase 
a company like—I don’t know, hypo-
thetically, Twitter—and then the deal 
comes apart, that ends up in a Dela-
ware court called our chancery court. 
Our Federal District Court and our 
Federal Bankruptcy Courts handle sig-
nificant litigation. 
Greg is someone who also, as a fam-
ily man, as a person of faith, as an out-
standing leader in our community, as 
the past president of the bar associa-
tion, as the past chairman of the judi-
cial nominating commission on behalf 
of our Governor, he has served our 
community. 
He brings his heart, his values, his 
intellect, and his skill to his service 
each and every day, and I am honored 
to join my senior Senator in speaking 
on his behalf on the floor. And I look 
forward to working with my colleagues 
across the aisle to ensure a swift con-
firmation vote today. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant executive clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am 
hearing a lot of news reports, and if 
they are correct, it sounds like the ma-
jority party has a very partisan bill 
that they want to call a drug pricing 
bill. 
And I am also told that this is mov-
ing along because it looks like the Par-
liamentarian is currently reviewing 
that proposed legislation to see if it 
fits into the process of reconciliation. 
If the majority party passes its par-
tisan bill, it will be bad policy for pa-
tients and taxpayers, but that doesn’t 
mean we don’t have answers to the 
problems that they are trying to solve. 
But first of all, let me say what the 
Senate-proposed legislation—what we 
know about it—would do. It would put 
taxpayers at risk for more spending. It 
would fail to enact any bipartisan ac-
countability of Big Pharma and power-
ful middlemen that we call pharmacy 
benefit managers or PBMs for short. 
Yes, a bipartisan bill limiting phar-
maceutical increases is possible. And 
their bill has been developed in secret, 
with no markup or open debate. 
Now, this partisan bill and this proc-
ess are a far cry from bipartisan drug 
pricing ideas that I have developed 
over the past few years. 
In the past 12 months alone, I have 
passed five bipartisan drug pricing bills 
out of committee that will lower prices 
and create more competition and hold 
Big Pharma and PBMs accountable. 
In addition, I have a comprehensive 
bill to lower prescription drug prices 
that could pass the Senate with at 
least 60 votes. My bill is bipartisan; it 
has been negotiated; and it is com-
prehensive. 
The bill is called the Prescription 
Drug Pricing Act. It is also known as 
Grassley-Wyden, but I want to be fair 
to Wyden. I am not sure that he would 
claim that he negotiated that bill, but 
I still like the bipartisan part of it. 
The Senate should act today on this 
bipartisan bill to lower drug prices be-
cause this is what Grassley-Wyden 
would do: It would lower costs for sen-
iors by $72 billion. It would save the 
taxpayers $95 billion. Those are CBO 
figures. 
It establishes an out-of-pocket cap, 
eliminates the donut hole, and it rede-
signs Medicare Part D, that needs some 
redesigning after 19 years. This legisla-
tion will hold Big Pharma and powerful 
PBMs accountable. 
Now, too often, cheaper alternatives 
like generics are available, but Big 
Pharma and these middlemen have an 
incentive to push the patient into high-
er-cost drugs, and patients pay the 
cost. My bill ends that incentive and is 
very pro-consumer. 
A third point I want to make, it ends 
taxpayer subsidies to Big Pharma. It 
does it by capping annual price in-
creases of Medicare Part B and D drugs 
at inflation. In other words, drug com-
panies can’t raise prices two or three 
times a year 5 to 10 percent—once a 
year at no more than CPI. 
A Kaiser Foundation study found 
that half of the drugs in Medicare Part 
B and D increased higher than inflation 
over the period of time that Kaiser 
study covered. Over 600 drugs during 
the study increased 7.5 percent or 
more. 
Another point of the bill: It estab-
lishes accountability and transparency. 
There are 25 major provisions to my 
bill to reform how the pharmaceutical 
industry operates. 
Accountability in my bill includes, 
one, ending clawbacks that drive up 
costs at pharmacy counters for the pa-
tient. Second, ending ‘‘spread pricing’’ 
in Medicaid contracts that drive up 
taxpayers’ costs. Three, requires sun-
shine on powerful PBM financial audits 
so the public knows the true net cost of 
a drug. 
Everything with PBMs is opaque. 
You don’t know what goes on between 
the manufacturer and the consumer. 
And, four and lastly, requires sun-
shine on excessive drug price increases 
and sunshine on the launch price of a 
new high-cost drug. 
Big Pharma and powerful middlemen 
benefit from the current system that 
we have today, and at the same time, 
patients and taxpayers suffer. My bill’s 
bipartisan reform will change all of 
that. 
Finally, the bill is bipartisan. I sup-
pose Democrats get tired of me talking 
about a bipartisan bill when they are 
in the secrecy of their rooms drawing 
up their own bill. 
We have 11 Republicans who sup-
ported this bill in the Finance Com-
mittee markup or are cosponsors of the 
bill. Thirteen Democrats supported 
this bill in markup. It was debated and 
negotiated in public. 
But don’t take my word for it, take it 
from some of my Democratic col-
leagues. A few months ago, the senior 
Senator from Delaware said this: 
Senator GRASSLEY did, I thought, a mas-
terful job in drafting a bill with broad bipar-
tisan support. 
And the chairman of the Finance 
Committee and senior Senator from 
Oregon—and he is probably going to 
hate me for saying this, but I am going 
to quote him: 
Big Pharma was relentless in fighting what 
Senator GRASSLEY is talking about and has 
been for 2 years. 
My bill will save seniors money, save 
taxpayers money, hold Big Pharma and 
powerful middlemen accountable, and 
enact necessary reform and sunshine; 
plus, it has bipartisan support. 
So we can lower drug prices without 
having to resort to this partisan rec-
onciliation process. The Grassley Pre-
scription Drug Pricing Reduction Act 
is a solution. It is a product of a bipar-
tisan, transparent process. Compare 
that to the secrecy of the Democratic 
reconciliation process. 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER 
(Mr.

The motion is agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
(The remarks of Mr. CARDIN
per-
taining to the introduction of S. Res. 
713 are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CHIPS ACT 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, our econ-
omy is as resilient as any in the world. 
At the same time, we know that it is 
important to always look to modernize 
key economic policies, particularly as 
it relates to fundamental questions of 
research and development and also pro-
duction and manufacturing, in order to 
create 
high-skilled, 
high-wage 
jobs 
from sea to shining sea. 
Now, I come from a State that is a 
leader in technological innovation, not 
just for our country but for the world. 
Oregonians know how important it is 
to invest and make sure that the 
United States stays at the forefront of 
technological breakthroughs. 
The reality is, when it comes to 
chips, we have some important work to 
do, so I want to take just a few minutes 
to describe why it is so essential for 
the Congress to get this legislation 
done now. 
First of all, our bill is going to bring 
down costs for consumers and busi-
nesses. Everybody knows there are 
chips in laptops, phones, and cars, but 
there are also chips in refrigerators 
and even vacuum cleaners, as we saw 
at Stark’s in Southeast Portland re-
cently. 
From the time you pick your head up 
off your pillow until the time you go to 
bed at night, you are interacting with 
chips. That is what made it such an 
economic nightmare when the pan-
demic hit and the supply of semi-
conductors got cut short. Prices for a 
host of important goods went into the 
stratosphere. Some products weren’t 
available at all. Factories in America 
went dark because they couldn’t get 
component parts. Anybody who has had 
to buy a car in the last few years prob-
ably can tell you a horror story about 
the buying process. 
This legislation is going to go a long 
way to increasing the production and 
manufacturing of chips in this country 
and bringing down consumer costs and 
addressing the shortages by increasing 
the supply here in America. 
That leads to my second point. In-
vesting in domestic chip production is 
going to create a huge, huge number of 
good-paying jobs. Oregonians know 
well that the jobs at these chipmakers 
can become an economic fuel for a 
whole region in the country. We need 
to guarantee that investment happens 
here in America instead of overseas. 
Third, the bill is going to help shore 
up our national security and our eco-
nomic security. With respect to the 
economy, when there aren’t enough 
chips to keep our factories running and 
our shelves stocked, workers and the 
American economic system suffer. 
And when the vast majority of chips 
are produced in just a few sites over-
seas, there is a big risk that the United 
States won’t be able to get its hands on 
the chips needed to keep the American 
people safe in a conflict. 
I am a member of the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence. I can’t get 
involved in classified matters that I 
have some access to. But I want every-
body in the Senate to know this is a 
top-tier national security issue. Pro-
ducing more chips here at home means 
that our economy will be more resil-
ient for the days ahead and our country 
will be safer and more secure. 
One last comment in this short state-
ment. The Senate passed a larger 
version of this bill last year, and it in-
cluded a trade package that Senator 
CRAPO and I, our colleague from Idaho, 
worked together on. It focused on 
cracking down on China’s worst trade 
abuses, including the horrendous prac-
tice of forced labor, including proposals 
that went after authoritarian censor-
ship overseas and a growing danger of 
freedom of speech here in America. 
I also sought to update the system 
for job training and workers’ support, 
so key to our workers having access to 
high-skill, high-wage jobs. That trade 
package 
is 
not 
included 
in 
this 
slimmed-down version of the CHIPS 
legislation. I can promise, however, as 
chairman of the Finance Committee, 
we will keep working on these issues. 
Cracking down on trade cheats, fight-
ing for investments and jobs in Amer-
ica is at the top of the priority list for 
the Finance Committee. I look forward 
to continuing our work on those issues 
in the weeks and months ahead. 
This legislation is long overdue. It is 
a serious, fresh commitment to innova-
tion in America. I am proud that I was 
able to lead the effort in the Senate Fi-
nance Committee to focus on producing 
and manufacturing more semiconduc-
tors in America. It is hugely important 
for my State, which really does re-
search and development for the entire 
country. But it is important for all 
Americans every single day because, 
from the time you get up in the morn-
ing until the time you go to bed at 
night, you are using these chips. This 
is, in my view, the first step of many 
that we have to take to promote more 
innovation and the path to creating 
high-skill and high-wage jobs in Amer-
ica. 
Let’s take the first step with this im-
portant legislation. Pass this bill. I 
urge my colleagues to vote for it later 
when we get to the final vote. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
INFLATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the economic crisis that this Nation is 
facing, all as a result of the actions of 
the Democrats and Joe Biden. 
Right now, Joe Biden is on his way to 
Massachusetts. He is expected to an-
nounce, while he is there, even more 
restrictions on American energy. One 
New England Senator has lobbied him 
to go ‘‘executive Beast Mode.’’ The 
Senator might forget that we still have 
a Constitution. The Supreme Court 
just ruled that the President can’t do 
that. The Constitution says Congress 
writes the laws and it is up to the 
President to enforce them.

I would also remind that Senator 
that Joe Biden just got back from a 
trip to the Middle East. That is where 
he went to beg the Saudis to produce 
and to sell us more oil. Joe Biden 
doesn’t need to fly around the world to 
solve the energy crisis that he created. 
The solution is right here at home in 
America. We have some of the largest 
energy reserves in the world. We have 
the best energy workers. We have the 
highest standards. Yet Joe Biden won’t 
let go of his stranglehold on American 
energy. Joe Biden would rather send 
our money and more and more money 
to the Middle East than let us use the 
energy we have sitting right here in 
the ground in the United States. 
Joe Biden has created the worst en-
ergy crisis for our country in the last 
40 years—4–0—40 years. Gas prices 
today in my home State of Wyoming 
and all across the country are more 
than $2 per gallon higher than they 
were the day Joe Biden took office. 
The spot price of natural gas has tri-
pled under Joe Biden and that means 
even higher prices are on the way. Nat-
ural gas powers half of the homes in 
America and the price of that natural 
gas has tripled under Joe Biden. 
Last year, Joe Biden’s energy poli-
cies cost the average American family 
more than $1,000. That was last year. 
This year it is going to be higher than 
that. Higher energy costs are driving 
up the costs of everything—almost ev-
erything—because energy is such a 
vital part of our nation’s economy. 
Higher energy costs have led to the 
worst inflation crisis in 40 years—worst 
inflation in 40 years. Under Joe Biden, 
inflation has hit record highs. In the 
previous administration, inflation was 
nearly nonexistent. But for 15 months 
in a row now, prices have gone up. And 
not just have prices gone up, they have 
gone up faster and faster than wages 
have gone up. With every passing 
month, working families can afford 
less than they could the month before. 
This is Joe Biden’s America. This is 
what he brought and the Democrats 
who supported him in position and pol-
icy after each, one after another. 
This year, the average family will 
pay $100 a week more just to buy the 
same things they bought last year. 
Just to stay even, it is $100 a week 
more. That is over $5,000 for the year. 
One hundred dollars a week adds up 
very quickly. As a result, people are 
spending their savings because they are 
not making enough to keep up. They 
are falling behind. They are borrowing 
money just to get by. 
The savings rate in the country has 
plummeted to the lowest level since 
the Great Recession of 2009. Credit card 
debts are at an alltime high because 
people can’t afford things and are put-
ting things on the credit cards. Per-
sonal debt is at an alltime high. Con-
sumer confidence, on the other hand, is 
at an alltime low—thank you, Joe 
Biden and Democrats. 
Working families are being pushed to 
the breaking point. That is what we 
have here in America today. All told, it 
is the summer of strain and stress and 
suffering for American families. It is 
all happening because of the derelic-
tion of duty on the part of the United 
States and the Democrats in this very 
body. The American people just want 
to be able to actually have enough 
money in their wallet to fill their tank 
with gas and to go to the grocery store 
and buy a full week’s worth of gro-
ceries and have enough left over at the 
end of the month to pay their bills. Yet 
under Joe Biden and the Democrats, 
who are in charge of both the House 
and the Senate, this is becoming nearly 
impossible in America today. 
Democrats call this the cost of the 
‘‘liberal 
world 
order’’—the 
liberal 
world order. Look what it is getting us. 
Believe it or not, that is exactly what 
the White House has said. That is their 
official policy on the cost of inflation 
and the cost of energy being so high: 
Tough; suck it up. ‘‘Liberal world 
order.’’ We are here now. I don’t care 
what it costs you or what pain and suf-
fering we put onto the families of this 
country. 
Meanwhile, as the President is going 
to talk about his climate emergency in 
Massachusetts, baby formula is still 
out of stock in stores all across Amer-
ica. For 15 months, there has been 
nothing but bad news coming from this 
administration and the Democrats for 
the working families in this country. 
Last week, working families got a 
one-two punch of even more bad news. 
First, they found out that, once again, 
inflation is at another 40-year high. 
They also found out it is not going 
away any time soon. On Thursday, we 
found out that what is called wholesale 
inflation—which is the inflation that 
our producers are experiencing—is even 
worse than the inflation for consumers. 
These are the people who build our 
homes, who grow our food, keep the 
lights on. Higher costs for them mean 
higher costs are coming for all the rest 
of American families because, if infla-
tion is higher for producers today, in-
flation for consumers tomorrow will be 
higher than it is today. It means there 
is no light at the end of the tunnel. 
But that is not what Joe Biden is 
telling us. He has continued to say: Oh, 
inflation is transitory. Pay no atten-
tion to the fact you can’t pay your 
bills, you can’t buy enough food to feed 
your family, and you can’t fill your car 
with gasoline. Tough. Pay no atten-
tion. 
He said on Thursday that the infla-
tion numbers we are using are ‘‘out of 
date.’’ He is out of date. Joe Biden is 
essentially saying inflation peaked be-
fore the Fourth of July. That is what 
he told the American people. Well, re-
member the last time Joe Biden said 
inflation peaked? That was last year in 
December he said it peaked. What has 
happened over the last 7 months to this 
country and to families? It is now July, 
and inflation has broken new records 
three more times in just the last 6 
months. 
Is he clueless? Does he believe what 
he is saying? And who is surrounding 
him at the White House? Joe Biden was 
wrong in December; he is wrong now. 
He has been wrong every step of the 
way, and yet Democrats blindly follow 
him right over the cliff. 
First, he created the inflation crisis; 
then he denied it existed. Oh, then he 
said it was transitory. I think it was a 
year ago yesterday, he said it was tran-
sitory. Then at one point, the White 
House even said inflation was a good 
thing. It is not good for American fam-
ilies, not good for the men and women 
who go to work every day. Then Biden 
decided, let’s start blaming everyone 
but ourselves. 
At every step of this crisis, Joe Biden 
has told the public things that were 
simply not true. Joe Biden keeps try-
ing to downplay the pain and the suf-
fering going on all across the country. 
In fact, 1 year ago yesterday, Joe Biden 
said inflation would be temporary. He 
was wrong. The Democrats running 
Washington right now are completely 
out of touch—I mean, completely out 
of touch with the American people as 
Members of this body say: Yeah, Joe, 
go to Boston. Declare a climate emer-
gency to claim a crisis. 
There are a lot of crises in America 
today; climate is not one of them. 
There is an inflation crisis, an energy 
crisis, a border crisis, a crime crisis. 
There is a crisis in the White House of 
competence and credibility. But no, 
Joe Biden has other things on his 
mind—a climate crisis. Only 1 percent 
of Americans list that as a key item in 
their lives—only 3 percent of Demo-
crats; only 3 percent of people under 
the age of 30. Everybody is focused on 
inflation. Joe Biden is going to Boston 
to talk about climate. 
We have today, in this country, with 
the Democratic Party, a government of 
the elites, by the elites, for the elites. 
The Democratic Party has completely 
forgotten about the working men and 
women in America. For more proof of 
that, the Democrats are talking about 
more reckless taxing, more reckless 
spending. 
When did the inflation crisis start? 
Right after the Democrats passed their 
last spending bill in March of last year 
when they put $2 trillion on America’s 
credit card—party-line vote for mas-
sive government spending. They bailed 
out bankrupt blue States. The Demo-
crats spent $2 trillion, triggered infla-
tion, triggered a nightmare—a night-
mare, I tell you—that has been robbing 
the American people of $100 every sin-
gle week since then. 
Democrats must have enjoyed their 
shopping spree because they spent the 
second half of last year trying to pass 
an even bigger, more reckless spending 
bill. Here they are again, trying it once 
again. It was reckless then; it is reck-
less now. 
And the President’s poll numbers 
continue 
to 
plummet 
because 
the 
American people say you are focused 
on the wrong thing, you are ignoring 
our needs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3512 
July 20, 2022 
You are abandoning the people. You 
have abandoned them, and that is why 
so few people think the country is 
heading in the right direction, and so 
many people are looking for a change. 
Democrats don’t seem to care. They 
know they are about to face the voters 
in November and can see the hand-
writing on the wall, and they can hear 
the clock ticking. 
The reason why inflation is out of 
control, at 40-year record highs, is be-
cause of the massive spending com-
bined with the attacks by this adminis-
tration and the Democrats in this body 
on American energy. That is what is 
causing the price of everything from 
gas to groceries to hit one record high 
after another. 
The Democrats have spent us into 
record-high inflation. Now it seems 
that they want to tax us into a reces-
sion. The last thing the American peo-
ple now need is more spending, more 
taxes, more debt. What we need is more 
American energy. 
The way to get out of this crisis is to 
stop the reckless spending and increase 
the supply of American energy. We 
don’t need to look halfway around the 
world for energy; we have it right here 
in this country. It is time for the Presi-
dent of the United States to stop beg-
ging, and it is time to start exploring 
for the energy right here in America. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I have 
had the privilege of serving with Sen-
ator BARRASSO. For any number of 
years, we were the coleads on the Envi-
ronment and Public Works Committee. 
We actually found common ground on a 
whole lot of issues and disagreed on a 
number of them as well. But on a per-
sonal level, we have, I think, a very 
good friendship and have had for a 
number of years good collaboration on 
Environment and Public Works. 
I disagree with almost everything he 
said—almost everything he said—and I 
am not a disagreeable person, but I al-
ways look for common ground, and I 
am sorry to say I didn’t hear a whole 
lot from him today to do that. 
The suggestion that somehow we 
shouldn’t be concerned about climate 
change, the climate crisis that has vis-
ited our planet—a couple of points I 
just want to share. This is off the news 
yesterday, the day before, Monday, 
Tuesday of this week. 
The United Kingdom broke its record 
for the highest recorded temperature 
multiple times on Monday, reaching 
104.4 degrees Fahrenheit. In Great Brit-
ain, for the most part, they don’t have 
air-conditioning. Record temperature— 
104.4 degrees just on Monday alone. 
There are airport runways in Great 
Britain that are melting—that is right, 
melting—because it is so hot. 
The railways in the United States are 
buckling from the heat, with riders 
warned to stay home—to stay home. 
Over 1,100 people have died in Spain 
and Portugal just in the last week from 
heat-related causes. 
Wildfires in France have forced 30,000 
people—that is about as many people 
as we have in Dover, DE, our State cap-
ital—30,000 people to evacuate. Orga-
nizers plan to pour tens of thousands of 
liters of water onto the Tour de France 
route—it is a huge, international bicy-
cle competition—to prevent the road 
from melting in the heat. 
More than 40 million people in the 
United States are under extreme heat 
warnings across the Great Plains and 
California. Around 60 million Ameri-
cans will likely see temperatures at or 
above 100 degrees—not this year, not 
this month, this week. Nearly 60 per-
cent of California is dealing with exces-
sive drought, while 20 percent of 
Texas—it is 5 percent worse than last 
week—experiences 
exceptional 
drought, the most extreme level on the 
drought scale. Firefighters this week 
are currently battling 89—that is right, 
89—large fires in 12 States in the 
United States. 
That is just off the news pages of 2 
days ago. 
Amid calls to lower the price of gaso-
line, I rise to speak on the news this 
week regarding climate change. 
There is no doubt that we are living 
in unprecedented times as a nation and 
as a planet. After an unprecedented 
pandemic ground our global economy 
to a halt, Americans have been strug-
gling to return to ‘‘normal.’’ 
As we saw in the news earlier this 
year, 
unprecedented 
supply 
chain 
issues from the pandemic, along with 
Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked invasion 
of Ukraine, have caused gas prices to 
rise 
until 
this 
month—until 
this 
month. We know that this in turn has 
fueled inflation and put economic 
strain on families and small businesses 
across our country. 
President Biden has responded to this 
challenge with unprecedented action, 
rallying our global partners and releas-
ing record amounts of oil from our 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The re-
sult has garnered less attention from 
the media. Over the past 34 days, gaso-
line prices have declined by more than 
half a dollar per gallon. I will say that 
again. Over the past 34 days, gasoline 
prices have declined by more than 50 
cents per gallon—the fastest decline in 
over a decade. More than 20,000 gas sta-
tions across our country are now offer-
ing gas for under $4 per gallon. Leading 
economists expect this decline in gas 
prices to continue, maybe even to ac-
celerate. 
In addition, our Nation is on track to 
surpass our historic, prepandemic lev-
els of oil production by 2023. I want to 
say that again. In addition, our Nation 
is on track to surpass our historic, 
prepandemic levels of oil production by 
2023—next year. 
Still, these are short-term solutions 
that leave Americans susceptible to 
higher gas prices. Why? It is the global 
market that largely determines gaso-
line prices. That means that as long as 
our economy runs mostly on fossil 
fuels, energy prices will continue to be 
volatile to the forces outside our Na-
tion. We cannot drill our way out of 
this problem. 
In the long run, the best way to en-
sure that American families have ac-
cess to lower prices at the pump is by 
reducing our dependence on foreign oil 
and on fossil fuels. I want to say that 
again. In the long run, the best way we 
can ensure that American families 
have access to lower prices at the pump 
is by reducing our dependence on fossil 
fuels. Doing so isn’t just critical for 
protecting Americans from high energy 
costs; it is necessary for addressing the 
existential threat of climate change. 
Make no mistake, the climate crisis 
is here. It is here. It is in Europe. It is 
in Asia. It is in South America. It is in 
Africa. It is all over the world. 
We see it in the form of unprece-
dented heat waves currently impacting 
millions of people across Europe, as I 
suggested, and our country too. 
We see climate change in the form of 
unprecedented 
drought, 
driving 
wildfires across the Western United 
States that are bigger than my State. 
Currently, firefighters are battling, as 
I said, 89 large fires in 12 States, and it 
is only expected to get worse. Accord-
ing to the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric 
Administration—we 
call 
them 
NOAA—the 
decades-long 
megadrought in the American West is 
not just persisting, it is intensifying 
and expanding east, worsening the 
threat of additional wildfires. 
We see climate change in the form of 
rising sea levels that produce waves 
able to wipe out weddings in Hawaii 
just last weekend. 
This event is a real-life consequence 
of what experts have already told us: 
Sea levels are rising faster than they 
have in more than 3,000 years and are 
expected to rise by an additional foot 
by 2050. 
We know this firsthand in Delaware. 
Delaware is the first State. The lowest 
lying State in America is Delaware. 
Our State is sinking. The seas around 
us are rising. 
Down in Louisiana, a big State in an-
other part of the country, they are ex-
periencing sea level rise as well. In the 
State of Louisiana, you know what, 
every 100 minutes—every 100 minutes— 
they lose a piece of land to the sea the 
size of a football field in Louisiana. I 
will say that again. Every 100 minutes 
in Louisiana, they lose a piece of land 
the size of a football field—every 100 
minutes. 
We see climate change in the form of 
sea levels rising all up and down the 
east coast, down to Florida, gulf coast, 
east coast, west coast, everywhere. 
The extreme weather is costing us. 
According to an analysis of data from 
NOAA and the global reinsurance com-
pany Munich Re, severe weather caused 
more than $121 billion—billion with a 
‘‘b’’—in property damage in the United 
States between 2017 and 2021—$121 bil-
lion. That is an average of about $940

per household and business and didn’t 
take into account the property losses 
from the historic wildfires I have just 
been talking about. 
We continue to see the destruction 
that accompanies climate change hap-
pen on a global scale as well, threat-
ening the critical infrastructure we 
rely on for international trade. This 
week, I mentioned the recordbreaking 
temperatures they are seeing in Eng-
land and in Europe and in Germany 
and other places. 
Most tragic of all, these climate-in-
duced events are putting people’s lives 
at risk. Extreme heat is the leading 
cause of weather-related deaths in our 
country. According to NOAA, the 12 
most costly extreme weather events in 
2021 alone resulted in the deaths of 
nearly 700 people. 
Addressing this crisis is the chal-
lenge of our time. It is directly tied to 
the prices we pay at the pump and in 
nearly every facet of our lives. 
Instead of doubling down on policies 
that continue to fail American con-
sumers and the planet, as some of our 
colleagues have been advocating for 
today, we should focus our attention 
on passing legislation that accelerates 
our transition to a clean energy future 
and leaves no community behind in the 
process. It is our ticket to a brighter 
future and one without recordbreaking 
heat waves, high gas prices, and un-
precedented devastation. 
Let me close with apologies to Ste-
phen Stills. Stephen Stills is a great 
songwriter and singer with Buffalo 
Springfield, an iconic group. Long ago, 
he wrote a song that has these words. 
We have heard them a million times. It 
starts something like this: 
There is something happening here, [just] 
what it is ain’t exactly clear. 
Those are his words, the opening line 
from one of the great songs of all time. 
Well, 
with 
apologies 
to 
Stephen 
Stills, there is something happening 
here, and it is exactly clear what is 
causing it. It is a climate crisis. We 
have way too much carbon in the air. 
We are producing more. That is the bad 
news. 
Here is the good news: We can do 
something about it. We can do some-
thing about it. Part of it is—I will just 
close with this—30 percent of our car-
bon emissions in this Nation come 
from our cars, trucks, and vans—30 per-
cent. More and more, we are seeing 
automakers build cars, trucks, and 
vans that run not on gas and diesel but 
on electric. We are beginning to install 
literally thousands of charging sta-
tions all over the country to help pro-
vide an opportunity for people to 
charge their batteries and also to buy 
hydrogen, when we switch to hydrogen, 
for fuel cell vehicles. Those expansions 
and those investments will put lit-
erally hundreds of thousands of Ameri-
cans—probably 
more 
than 
that—to 
work across the country, in every cor-
ner of the country, to enable us to re-
duce carbon emissions from our mobile 
fleet. 
Instead of just burning coal and to 
some extent natural gas, we have the 
opportunity to create clean energy 
from advanced nuclear. I am a Navy 
guy, 27 years in the Navy all in. We 
have been doing nuclear energy in the 
Navy for 50 years. Do you know how 
many people have died in the Navy 
from exposure to radioactive mate-
rials? Zero. Fifty years—perfect record. 
We are now in the beginning of a new 
development and a new exploration in 
pursuit of nuclear energy using small 
modular nuclear reactors—a lot safer 
than the ones we have been building for 
years. 
We are in a position now to have, lit-
erally, from Maine all the way down to 
Maryland, offshore wind that creates 
enormous amounts of carbon-free elec-
tricity that we can use to charge our 
cars, trucks, and vans and actually put 
a lot of people to work building those 
windmills and doing good things for 
our planet. 
The climate crisis is here. The ques-
tion is, What do we do about it? And 
there is an opportunity to meet it 
head-on. And it is not like you got to 
eat your broccoli. No, no, no. This is 
something we can do, and we could ac-
tually not just do good things for our 
planet, help us avert greater disasters 
in the days going forward, we could ac-
tually create a lot of economic oppor-
tunity, a lot of jobs and we can do that 
and we can do both. We need to do 
that. We need to do that. 
I yield the floor to my friend from 
Texas. I think I will sit here and hear 
what he has to say. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, while 
my friend, the Senator from Delaware, 
is on the floor, in Texas we are known 
for oil and gas production, but the 
truth is, and what I think we really 
should be known for, is for an ‘‘all of 
the above’’ energy policy. 
We produce more electricity from 
wind turbines than any other State in 
the country, and that is a surprise to a 
number of people. 
But one reason for an ‘‘all of the 
above’’ energy policy is that during the 
current hot spell we are experiencing 
in Texas—I think we have had over 33 
days of over 100-degree temperatures in 
my hometown of Austin, TX. It is hot. 
Some might say: Well, of course it is 
hot. It is July in Texas. But what has 
happened, we have seen this phe-
nomenon where the wind is not pro-
ducing nearly as much electricity be-
cause it is not blowing as hard as it 
might otherwise do. 
So, again, I think if we can encour-
age an ‘‘all of the above’’ energy pol-
icy, then different segments of the en-
ergy picture can fill in at different 
times and satisfy our overall need. 
I thought while my friend was speak-
ing on that topic I would just mention 
that interesting lesson that we have 
learned here recently in Texas. 
CHIPS ACT 
Mr. President, last night, the Senate 
moved forward on the CHIPS Act. As 
colleagues have heard me talk about 
this before, this was actually filed in 
2020. 
Senator WARNER, the senior Senator 
from Virginia, a Democrat, and I, a Re-
publican from Texas, introduced this 
bill more than 2 years ago. 
The main concern was that our sup-
ply of microcircuits that run every-
thing from our cell phones to our 
laptops, to F–35 Joint Strike Fight-
ers—we depended on a vulnerable sup-
ply chain from Asia for those advanced 
semiconductors. 
The 
United 
States 
produces zero percent of the advanced 
semiconductors we need here in Amer-
ica. 
And anybody who has tried to buy a 
car lately or even a washing machine 
or a laptop or a desktop computer 
knows that the supply chains of semi-
conductors, and thus these products, 
are severely constrained because our 
economy has taken off post-COVID–19, 
but the supply chains can’t keep up 
with them and particularly the supply 
of these semiconductors. So that is 
why this bill is so important. 
Over the last several days, I have 
worked with colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to craft a dramatically 
slimmed-down version of the competi-
tiveness bill we passed here in the Sen-
ate last summer. 
The final text of the bill was not re-
leased before the procedural vote last 
night, which was a point of frustration 
for a number of colleagues, and I can 
certainly understand. Here they are, 
asked to vote on a procedural vehicle 
to get on this bill, and they don’t know 
exactly what the bill is going to look 
like. And that was the reason some of 
them decided to vote no against the 
motion to proceed. I completely under-
stand that. 
But our colleagues will have time to 
review this bill in the coming days, and 
I hope that support for this legislation 
will continue to grow. After all, it is a 
matter of our economic and national 
security. 
The global semiconductor shortage 
has claimed a lot of attention over the 
last couple of years because of the im-
pact it has had on consumers, but these 
aren’t existential threats; these are in-
conveniences because of these con-
strained supply chains. 
If, for example, there was another 
pandemic or a natural disaster or if, 
Heaven forbid, the People’s Republic of 
China decided to forcibly unify with 
Taiwan, this could potentially block 
access to all of the advanced semi-
conductors that we need in America, 
and this would be a dramatic negative 
effect. 
First of all, it would create almost 
instantaneously a recession here in 
America. Thousands of people would be 
put out of work. But what I want to 
focus on are the national security con-
sequences. 
When we send our troops on any mis-
sion—by air, land, sea, or cyber—we 
need the very best equipment and tech-
nology available. And now more than

July 20, 2022 
ever, this technology cannot function 
without semiconductors, without these 
chips. 
Just one example is, look at the Jav-
elin missiles that we are sending over 
to Ukraine to defeat the Russian Fed-
eration invasion. Each one of these 
Javelin missiles that the Ukrainians 
are using to such good effect requires 
more than 200 semiconductors in just 
one Javelin missile, and so far we have 
sent 5,500 of them to Ukraine. 
But it is not just these big items that 
need chips, it is things like the helmets 
that our fighter pilots use to fly and 
navigate; communications devices like 
radio sets to call in reinforcements to 
save American lives; smart hand-held 
cameras that attach to our troops’ gear 
that see around the corners to keep 
them out of harm’s way; and even ad-
vanced body armor uses semiconduc-
tors. 
If we ever needed to deploy the full 
force of the U.S. military and ramp up 
production to replenish our supplies, 
we would need an astronomical number 
of semiconductor chips. 
That is why bringing that manufac-
turing capacity back onshore, back 
home to America, is so important. 
This had been a big bipartisan pri-
ority, as I said, for the last couple of 
years, and this isn’t the first time that 
semiconductors have been regarded as 
a matter of national security. 
Interestingly, in the 1980s, it was a 
big priority item for President Reagan. 
At that time, our country was up 
against the Soviet Union’s expansive 
military 
forces. 
President 
Reagan 
knew that maintaining our edge would 
be a result of smarter military sys-
tems, not just bigger ones or more of 
them. 
As two national security and foreign 
policy experts from the University of 
Texas put it, ‘‘Reagan didn’t merely 
outspend the Soviets, he . . . sought to 
out-innovate them’’ as well. 
He pushed to maintain our competi-
tive edge in chips, thereby helping us 
lead in the advanced weapons and air-
frames that they enabled. 
But this isn’t just about what hap-
pens tomorrow or 6 months from now; 
we are talking about safeguarding the 
developments that will underpin our 
national security in 10, 20, or 30 years. 
That is why so many people from di-
verse political viewpoints support this 
effort. 
As we all remember, the CHIPS for 
America Act received broad bipartisan 
support when we first voted on it. It 
was adopted as an amendment to the 
annual Defense authorization bill by a 
vote of 96 to 4. Ninety-six percent of 
the U.S. Senate supported the bill. 
Since it became law a year and a half 
ago, we have heard from a range of 
voices and stakeholders who don’t typi-
cally align. 
For 
example, 
former 
USTR—U.S. 
Trade 
Representative—Robert 
Lighthizer, who served in the Trump 
administration, has been a vocal advo-
cate for chips funding. 
At a Senate Finance Committee 
meeting 2 years ago, he said semi-
conductors are a key part of our econ-
omy as well as the future of American 
security. 
Biden officials have shared this same 
sentiment. The Secretaries of Defense 
and Commerce recently sent a letter to 
Congress urging swift passage of this 
chips funding, saying it is ‘‘an impera-
tive to our national security.’’ 
Countless 
organizations, 
experts, 
businesses, and industry groups have 
expressed the same point of view. Some 
of the most respected men and women 
in the national security world wrote a 
letter to Congress urging quick action 
on this funding. That group included a 
former Secretary of Defense, former 
CIA Director, and former Director of 
National Intelligence. 
We have also heard from the National 
Governors Association and the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors, which represents 
State and local leaders across the 
country. 
We have heard from groups that rep-
resent automakers, the defense indus-
try, consumer electronics, and tele-
communications companies as well. 
Last month, a group of more than 120 
tech CEOs sent a letter to congres-
sional leaders urging quick action on 
this legislation. 
It is rare, especially today, to have 
such a broad consensus from so many 
different perspectives on a single issue 
advocating one priority, but that is 
how important this legislation is. 
I am optimistic about where we are 
at the moment after 2 long years of 
getting here, and I am glad Speaker 
PELOSI has said the House will take up 
the Senate bill as early as next week. 
The bottom line is, there is a lot at 
stake here, and I hope we can deliver a 
major win for our national security in 
the coming days. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
ENERGY POLICY 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, well, 
summer is in full swing, and all across 
the Midwest, people are preparing for 
lake vacations, for family barbecues, 
but new to this year’s agenda, they are 
also preparing for Biden blackouts. 
The shocking new inflation numbers 
show Americans already paying 42 per-
cent more for energy than this time 
last year, but now, due to the White 
House policies, we may not be able to 
generate enough electricity to meet de-
mand. 
Now, let us not forget that under Re-
publican leadership, we had a nation 
completely in control of our energy se-
curity. We were the global leader in en-
ergy production, and we were a net ex-
porter of oil products. 
However, under Democratic leader-
ship, we are making plans for the 
lights to go out, and I hope everybody 
has their candles ready to go at home. 
But it isn’t this administration’s 
fault, of course, so just ask them—just 
ask them. No, this White House states 
they are powerless to the whims of a 
global marketplace, and don’t bother 
asking them to own the consequences 
of their actions. 
Did President Biden actually believe 
canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline on 
his first day in office would not have 
negative effects on the global energy 
markets? Think about it. The United 
States, the largest oil producer in the 
world, stopping the transport, the im-
porting, of nearly a million barrels a 
day, over 5 percent of our supply—who 
could have ever predicted decreasing 
supply could impact the cost at the 
pump? 
And who could have predicted that 
halting all leasing on Federal lands 
would impact global supply? I even 
asked the Interior Secretary if this pol-
icy made it more difficult for oil com-
panies to drill, and she couldn’t give 
me an answer. She didn’t care. This ad-
ministration doesn’t care about the 
cost of gas at the pump; that is, until 
they get it high enough to make driv-
ing electric cars more comparable. 
Don’t even think about implying 
that John Kerry, Biden’s climate envoy 
at COP26, would cause private compa-
nies to take coal-powered plants offline 
and eliminate baseload without a plan 
going forward. After all, he said in 
Glasgow: 
By 2030, in the United States, we won’t 
have coal. We will not have [any] coal plants. 
Well, we may not have coal, but we 
will have blackouts. 
And it was Joe Biden on the cam-
paign trail, in his own words—I am 
sure you all remember—who said: 
Kiddo, I want you to just take a look . . . 
I want you to look into my eyes. I guarantee 
you, we are going to end fossil fuels. 
And we wonder why Americans won’t 
invest tens of millions—hundreds of 
millions—of dollars into this energy 
sector to drill new oil. Yet this Presi-
dent has declared war on American en-
ergy, and every American is paying the 
price at the gas pump. And yet this 
President wonders out loud why com-
panies won’t invest in any more explo-
ration when it takes 5 or 10 years for a 
payback on these types of investments. 
He continues to create uncertainty. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. Repub-
licans have been sounding the alarm on 
the negative impacts of this adminis-
tration’s policies since President Biden 
took office. Honestly, this should be 
surprising to no one. Yet the left seems 
confounded, stupefied, and without a 
plan except to turn off your air condi-
tioner and your freezer. 
Even more, they have resorted to 
outright lies. In fact, they repeat these 
lies over and over, hoping America will 
eventually fall for them. They repeat-
edly claim they have not been inter-
fering with American energy produc-
tion and now deceivingly spout they 
support the industry that they have 
been vilifying for years. 
It is clear, we need more traditional 
fuel production. I know it; the Amer-
ican people know it. And to be com-
pletely clear, I think the White House 
knows it as well.

July 20, 2022 
Why else would he have gone over-
seas to Saudi Arabia to beg for more 
oil? Why is the White House reaching 
out to dictators in Venezuela or coun-
tries that sponsor terrorism like Iran 
instead of supporting American produc-
tion in places like my home State of 
Kansas? 
When I asked the Secretary of En-
ergy in committee about the price of 
gas, she cheekily replied that she 
drives an electric vehicle. This is the 
same Secretary of Energy that laughed 
and found it ‘‘hilarious’’ when asked 
about her plan to increase oil produc-
tion in America. That is how this ad-
ministration responds to the pain of 
the American people: laughing as they 
ride away in their fancy electric vehi-
cles. 
All that said, I truly hope that those 
of us forced to experience a Biden 
blackout are able to get safely through 
it. For many, a short-term blackout 
might prove a mild inconvenience. But 
with the seasonal heat waves we are 
seeing across the State of Kansas, 
across this Nation and the rest of the 
Midwest, it could lead to life-threat-
ening 
complications. 
These 
Biden 
blackouts show that it is well past 
time for the President to stop the cli-
mate extremism, stop the anti-Amer-
ican policies devastating our commu-
nities, and stop looking overseas to fix 
problems that we have the answers to 
right here in America. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I hear 
from families in Louisiana every day 
that they are struggling to keep up 
with gas prices at historic heights. It is 
becoming unaffordable to drive to work 
or drop their kids off at school. The 15- 
year-old pickup that they drive—not 
because they don’t want a new car but 
because they cannot afford a new car— 
now costs $100 a tank to fill up. And for 
those who say: Tell them to buy an 
electric vehicle, that is the modern-day 
equivalent of Marie Antoinette saying 
to the peasants ‘‘Let them eat cake.’’ 
Families are forced to choose be-
tween buying groceries or buying gas. 
And the Biden administration doesn’t 
seem to be listening, so I am here to 
make their voices heard. 
Let me just read from letters we re-
ceived from constituents, just kind of 
like sending us a line. Here is Lorrie 
from Jamestown, LA. 
Dear Mr. Cassidy, Is there any relief in 
sight for gas prices? We had affordable gas 
under the Trump administration. There is no 
reason we should have these prices now if the 
oil and gas production in the United States 
was in full force. Why would we ever depend 
on other countries for anything when we 
have already been energy independent just a 
short time ago? Families in our country are 
suffering. 
Next 
letter, 
Gwendolyn 
from 
Prairieville: 
Dear Senator Cassidy, please do whatever 
it takes to get American oil and gas used as 
resources. I am a divorced 60-year-old woman 
on a limited income. Gas has gone up, elec-
tricity has gone up, groceries have gone up, 
medical expenses have gone up, and insur-
ance has gone up drastically, and my pay has 
not kept up at all. 
Here is Donnis from Singer: 
Dear Senator Cassidy, I just wanted to 
voice my opinion about how it makes no 
sense that our government will not renew oil 
leases off the coast of Louisiana . . . There is 
no reason we need to be held hostage by 
countries who do not care about our sov-
ereignty. 
This is Philip from DeRidder: 
Please help with these high gas and food 
prices. I am retired and on a fixed income 
and these higher gas prices and food prices 
are starting to hurt me and my wife. 
Here is Gregory from New Iberia: 
This is not about party affiliation. We’re 
coming into a bad crisis. Both parties need 
to come together and talk about drilling. We 
have all the resources we need to start drill-
ing again, and I know you are trying. I see it 
on the news. Please keep trying. 
Here is Laura from Vinton: 
I want to express my concern for us Lou-
isiana citizens. Gas prices are rising every 
day, food prices are rising everyday also. It’s 
coming down to having to choose between to 
get gas or get groceries. Something needs to 
be done. U.S. citizens are suffering daily. 
Please help us Americans! 
Here is Daryl from Mooringsport: 
As your constituent, I urge you to publicly 
call for and vote in favor of the immediate 
and permanent expansion of domestic oil and 
natural gas production. No more Green New 
Deal nonsense. Energy dependence is driving 
higher gas and diesel prices that are causing 
skyrocketing gas and food prices. We can’t 
rely on Iran or Venezuela to save us. We need 
to produce our own energy here—in Amer-
ica—and NOW. 
Lastly, Karen from Gretna asked: 
Why are we importing any oil? Energy 
independence is of vital importance to us and 
our national security. Louisiana was a leader 
in domestic energy production. It is shock-
ing to see how quickly our country has 
changed. Please continue to work on our be-
half to force our government to reinstate the 
energy independence policies that were in ef-
fect during the Trump administration. Speak 
loudly for us. 
Speak loudly for us. 
Speak loudly for us. 
What these letters make clear is that 
Americans are hurting. That is why I 
call for an Operation Warp Speed to 
lower the prices at the pump, to un-
leash American energy, and to regain 
our energy independence. 
President 
Biden 
needs 
to 
stop 
prioritizing far-left climate activists 
over the families sitting at the dinner 
table asking what they have to give up 
next in order to make ends meet. 
President Biden, as one of my con-
stituents says, needs to go where real 
people live. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, that 
whole concept of going where real peo-
ple live is an important one. When peo-
ple are facing higher utility bills every 
month and a bigger bill every time 
they fill up their gas tank, it doesn’t 
take long for them to figure out that 
policy 
decisions 
somewhere 
have 
changed 
something—and 
something 
that really dramatically affects their 
quality of life. And then it didn’t take 
long to figure out that those policy de-
cisions in Washington are the decisions 
that made that kind of difference. 
When a blackout causes the lights to 
go out and your refrigerator to stop 
working, the impact of energy policy 
becomes pretty tangible and you un-
derstand pretty quickly that this is im-
pacting you. That is a prospect that a 
lot of Americans are facing this sum-
mer. It is not theoretical, but in too 
many places, it is happening and hap-
pening over and over again. 
In late May, the North American 
Electric Reliability Corporation re-
leased a report that said that nearly 
two-thirds of the United States could 
experience blackouts this summer as a 
result of reliability challenges of the 
electric grid. Now, that group is a non-
profit regulatory authority that mon-
itors the grid in the United States and 
Canada and some of northern Mexico. 
They could see this coming and 
Americans can now see this happening. 
They said that it was sobering. They 
said that it was an understatement, 
really, in many ways, to see it any 
other way. The understatement is, in 
particular—and the report said—that 
in the West and the Midwest, there was 
a heightened risk of reliability chal-
lenges and energy shortfalls. 
This report on the electric grid cited 
several reasons for heightened risk peo-
ple are facing. One of them is that 
there is simply too little electric-gen-
erating capacity in the middle of the 
country where I live following the clo-
sure of older baseload generators. You 
can’t make these decisions about en-
ergy policy without having a replace-
ment in mind and not expect to see bad 
things happen to families, to individ-
uals, to our economy. And that is what 
we are seeing now. 
Earlier this year, the Energy Infor-
mation Administration projected 85 
percent of the generators closing this 
year would be coal-fired power plants. 
So, if you close these plants and 
don’t have a replacement in line, look 
what happens. Maybe we should ask 
Germany what happened when they 
shut down one of their major energy 
sources without having a replacement. 
Before you know it, they were depend-
ent on a source of energy and a kind of 
energy and a country to get that en-
ergy from that didn’t work out at all. 
From day one, the administration 
has advanced policies to restrict the 
production of affordable and reliable 
American energy. We have gone from 
being a net exporter of energy to an 
importer—in fact, even a pleading im-
porter of energy—in an unbelievably 
short period of time. 
Electric prices in that period of time 
have gone up nearly 20 percent. Gaso-
line prices have more than doubled. If 
you are at the gas pump and you fill up 
your tank, whatever you are paying, 
cut that in half. That is what you

would have paid under the policies just 
a couple of years ago. Now you are pay-
ing 107 percent more than you were 
paying then. The push of a rapid tran-
sition to renewable energy sources will 
cause prices to go up even higher. We 
have already seen what happens. We 
should be able to figure out what hap-
pens if you do more of it without a 
plan. 
What the administration wants to do 
here 
doesn’t 
have 
to 
be 
painful. 
Transitioning from fossil fuels over a 
period of time doesn’t have to be a 
painful thing. You just have to have a 
replacement in mind. You have to un-
derstand the economic consequences 
and understand, if your timeframe is 
right, there are no economic con-
sequences. 
Fossil fuels accounted for just over 60 
percent of the electricity generated in 
the United States last year. Nuclear 
power generated nearly 20 percent of 
the electricity; wind, 9 percent; hydro-
power, 6 percent; solar power was about 
3 percent. When you dedicate yourself 
to eliminating 60 percent of the elec-
tricity generated in the country, you 
have got to expect that bad things are 
going to happen, and they are. 
We are seeing what happened with re-
liability challenges in California in its 
leading the way in this transition. But 
last summer, the State was doing ev-
erything they could, as quickly as they 
could, to build gas plants, natural gas 
plants, to supplement its power and to 
avoid blackouts. You went from plenty 
of power to new sources of energy and 
then, suddenly, to not enough power 
and then back to fossil fuels to des-
perately try to replace the power. 
Surely, we can learn that this doesn’t 
have to be the way you make these re-
alistic transitions from one way of 
powering things to another. Just to re-
place every vehicle in the country with 
electric models would require 25 per-
cent more electricity than we produce 
today. Forcing the electrification of 
homes and buildings will drive demand 
even higher and will cost more. Fami-
lies will suffer. 
For now, all of the above still works. 
For the long term, we have to find out 
what works for all Americans and how 
we may have reasonable energy policy 
moving forward. All of the above is 
serving us well. As we move from that, 
we need to know what we are moving 
to, how we are moving there, and how 
we can do it with the least impact on 
the economy, on individuals, and on 
families. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
want to join my colleagues here in an 
important discussion as it relates to 
American energy. 
My colleague from the great State of 
Missouri said it well in so many dif-
ferent ways: Now we are pleading with 
dictators to import more energy. That 
is one element of what, certainly, has 
been the Biden administration’s most 
colossal, strategic mistake of its entire 
first year in office. Trust me. There 
have been a lot of mistakes on the 
Biden administration’s watch. There 
has been nothing that has undermined 
American interests in terms of working 
families, in terms of skyrocketing in-
flation, in terms of national security, 
in terms of energy security, and—yes, I 
am going to talk about it—in terms of 
environmental policy for America and 
the world. Nothing has been more 
harmful to America’s interests and the 
interests of American working families 
than the reckless policies of the Biden 
administration’s approach to American 
energy. 
I have talked about this issue a lot 
because a lot of those policies are ze-
roed in on my State and my constitu-
ents, but as many have already said 
and as Senator BLUNT has already said, 
it can be summed up, in my view, in 
kind of four key areas. 
No. 1, from day one, they have come 
in and said: We are going to limit the 
production of American energy. 
That is happening. It is certainly 
happening in Alaska. On day one, the 
President made an order on ANWR. We 
got ANWR done in this Congress, but 
he shut that down, and they are can-
celing lease sales. As for the National 
Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, they are 
taking half of that off the table. Every-
where you look, they are trying to 
limit the production of American en-
ergy. That is a fact. It makes no sense, 
but it is a fact. That is No. 1. 
No. 2 is the slow rolling and killing of 
energy infrastructure, the ability to 
move energy through pipelines or LNG 
terminals. They are stopping it, slow 
rolling it, or killing it. That is a fact, 
OK? That is what they have been doing 
from day one. 
No. 3, they are going to the American 
financial 
community—John 
Kerry, 
Gina McCarthy, and all of these far- 
left, crazy, policy folks—and saying to 
American banks and insurance compa-
nies: Don’t invest in American energy. 
This is choking off capital to this in-
credibly important sector of the U.S. 
economy. When they are not doing 
that, they are appointing senior offi-
cials—just think Comptroller of the 
Currency, the Federal Reserve, the 
SEC Chairman—who are undertaking 
policies to choke off capital to the 
American energy sector. That is hap-
pening. 
No. 4, when they have seen prices 
spike and hard-working American fam-
ilies paying hundreds, if not thousands, 
of dollars more to get to work in their 
cars or trucks, the administration is 
going around, begging dictators for 
more energy production. 
This is an insult. We have the highest 
standards with regard to the environ-
ment and American energy production 
in Alaska and in other places. Do you 
think the Saudis care about their envi-
ronment? Do you think the Ven-
ezuelans care? Do you think the terror-
ists in Iran care? They don’t, but the 
administration is going and begging 
dictators for more energy. 
So those are the policies of the Biden 
administration on energy, and we all 
know it is not working. It is having the 
predictable consequence of driving up 
energy costs on all American fami-
lies—and, of course, giving pink slips 
to American energy workers, who I be-
lieve are heroic workers: union workers 
and others—and empowering our adver-
saries. So that is what is happening. 
Today, the President is in Boston, so 
I want to talk about a couple of poli-
cies—energy policies—emanating from 
people and the communities of Boston 
that further show just how irrational 
the far-left Democratic Party is on en-
ergy. 
Let me first talk about this issue, 
which I like to trot out a lot, on this 
chart. This is a factual chart of emis-
sion changes from major economies in 
the world from 2005 to the present. You 
don’t hear about this a lot, but take a 
look. Take a look at this chart. 
What does it show? 
Of all of the major economies in the 
world, the one economy with the big-
gest reduction in greenhouse gas emis-
sions is America, the United States of 
America, by far. Take a look. We have 
reduced emissions since 2005 by almost 
15 percent. EU didn’t do that. Germany 
didn’t do that. Japan didn’t do that. 
And here you go: In China, there is a 
new coal plant every couple of days, it 
seems. In India, it is the same thing. 
Why am I bringing out this chart? A, 
people need to know that we are the 
leader; we are not the bad guy. I know 
John Kerry keeps thinking we are the 
bad guy; he goes around telling every-
body we are. We are not. If every other 
country in the world had emissions 
profiles like we had, you would see a 
much, much cleaner and less emitting 
planet. That is a fact. So let me talk 
about a couple of these policies. 
John Kerry, the climate envoy, has 
been reported as going to certain coun-
tries in Asia, saying: You know, we 
really 
don’t 
like 
hydrocarbons 
in 
America, so don’t buy any of that 
American LNG. 
What? We are paying this guy’s sal-
ary to say that? Whose side is he on? 
By the way, exporting clean-burning 
American LNG to places like India or 
China or Japan is exactly what we need 
to do to reduce global emissions. So 
you have got this one guy out there— 
and I am not sure why he is being paid 
by the U.S. Government; he should be 
paid by the Chinese Communist Party 
Government. There are recent press re-
ports that John Kerry’s private jet— 
that he flies all around the world on— 
last year, emitted over 300 tons of CO2. 
What? Yes. 
Look, he is smug, hypocritical, and 
his policies are hammering the middle 
class—and now this. John Kerry is one 
of the single biggest polluters and 
greenhouse gas emitters in the world 
for an individual. 
In Boston, one of the best things the 
President can do today is to either fire 
John Kerry or ask him to resign. That 
would be great. That would probably do 
a lot for climate in America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3517 
July 20, 2022 
Let me give another policy that 
should be raised in Massachusetts. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that this Boston Globe edi-
torial—a very long one—from February 
12, 2018, be printed in the RECORD. It is 
called ‘‘Our Russian ‘pipeline,’ and its 
ugly toll.’’ 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[Editorial: Boston Globe, February 12, 2018] 
OUR RUSSIAN ‘PIPELINE,’ AND ITS UGLY TOLL 
To build the new $27 billion gas export 
plant on the Arctic Ocean that now keeps 
the lights on in Massachusetts, Russian 
firms bored wells into fragile permafrost; 
blasted a new international airport into a 
pristine landscape of reindeer, polar bears, 
and walrus; dredged the spawning grounds of 
the endangered Siberian sturgeon in the Gulf 
of Ob to accommodate large ships; and com-
missioned a fleet of 1,000-foot icebreaking 
tankers likely to kill seals and disrupt whale 
habitat as they shuttle cargoes of super- 
cooled gas bound for Asia, Europe, and Ever-
ett. 
On the plus side, though, they didn’t offend 
Pittsfield or Winthrop, Danvers or Groton, 
with even an inch of pipeline. 
This winter’s unprecedented imports of 
Russian liquefied natural gas have already 
come under fire from Greater Boston’s 
Ukrainian-American 
community, 
because 
the majority shareholder of the firm that ex-
tracted the fuel has been sanctioned by the 
US government for its links to the war in 
eastern Ukraine and Russia’s illegal annex-
ation of Crimea. Last week, in response to 
the outcry, a group of Massachusetts law-
makers, led by Senator Ed Markey, blasted 
the shipments and called on the federal gov-
ernment to stop them. 
But apart from its geopolitical impact, 
Massachusetts’ reliance on imported gas 
from one of the world’s most threatened 
places is also a severe indictment of the 
state’s inward-looking environmental and 
climate policies. Public officials, including 
Attorney General Maura Healey and leading 
state senators, have leaned heavily on right-
eous-sounding stands against local fossil fuel 
projects, with scant consideration of the 
global impacts of their actions and a tacit 
expectation that some other country will 
build the infrastructure that we’re too good 
for. 
As a result, to a greater extent than any-
where else in the United States, the Com-
monwealth now expects people in places like 
Russia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Yemen to 
shoulder the environmental burdens of pro-
viding natural gas that state policy makers 
have showily rejected here. The old environ-
mentalist slogan—think globally and act lo-
cally—has been turned inside out in Massa-
chusetts. 
But more than just traditional NIMBYism 
is at work in the state’s resistance to nat-
ural gas infrastructure. There’s also the $1 
million the parent company of the Everett 
terminal spent lobbying Beacon Hill from 
2013 to 2017, amid a push to keep out the do-
mestic competition that’s ended LNG im-
ports in most of the rest of the United 
States. 
And there’s a trendy, but scientifically un-
founded, national fixation on pipelines that 
state policy makers have chosen to accom-
modate. Climate advocates, understandably 
frustrated by slow progress at the federal 
level, have put short-term tactical victories 
against fossil fuel infrastructure ahead of 
strategic progress on reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions, and so has Beacon Hill. 
They’ve obsessed over stopping domestic 
pipelines, no matter where those pipes go, 
what they carry, what fuels they displace, 
and how the ripple effects of those decisions 
may raise overall global greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
The environmental movement needs a 
reset, and so does Massachusetts policy. The 
real-world result of pipeline absolutism in 
Massachusetts this winter has been to steer 
energy customers to dirtier fuels like coal 
and oil, increasing greenhouse gas emissions. 
And the state is now in the indefensible posi-
tion of blocking infrastructure here, while 
its public policies create demand for over-
seas fossil fuel infrastructure like the Yamal 
LNG plant—a project likely to inflict far 
greater near and long-term harm to the plan-
et. 
‘‘ALL IS GLOOM AND ETERNAL SI-
LENCE,’’ wrote a 19th century English trav-
eler in an awestruck account of the Kara 
Sea, then still a largely uncharted domain of 
ice floes and fog. Though more powerful ves-
sels and melting ice have enabled more 
human activity in the Arctic, the area 
around Yamal, an indigenous name meaning 
‘‘edge of the world,’’ remains a refuge. An es-
timated 2,700 to 3,500 polar bears live in the 
Kara Sea region, along with the ring seals 
that form a crucial part of their diet. 
Opening a gas export facility in such a 
harsh environment required overcoming both 
political obstacles—the US sanctions de-
layed financing—and staggering triumphs of 
industrial engineering by a workforce that 
reportedly reached 15,000 people. Dredgers 
scooped away 1.4 billion cubic feet of seabed 
to make room for the ships and built a giant 
LNG facility on supports driven into the per-
mafrost, all in temperatures that can plunge 
to less than minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit. 
The oil and gas industry poses serious 
threats, especially in an area like the Arctic 
that recovers slowly from damage, and in 
2016 the Russian branch of the World Wildlife 
Fund issued a report warning of Yamal 
LNG’s potential dangers. White toothed 
whales, a near-threatened species, breed in 
the vicinity of the facility, and the noise 
from shipping and the presence of more giant 
vessels ‘‘may force toothed whales to leave 
this habitat, which is crucial for their living, 
feeding, and reproduction.’’ 
The giant ‘‘Yamalmax’’ ice breaking tank-
ers, longer than three football fields and de-
signed to mow through ice up to six feet 
deep, are also ‘‘extremely bad news for any 
ice-associated mammals that should be in 
the vicinity of their path,’’ said Sue Wilson, 
who leads an international research group 
based at the University of Leeds in the 
United Kingdom. The group has recently 
published a paper in the journal Biological 
Conservation on the impact of icebreakers 
on seal mothers and pups in the Caspian Sea 
and is currently studying shipping impacts 
in the Arctic. 
‘‘The captain is unlikely to notice—or even 
be able to see—seals in the vessel’s path 
ahead,’’ she said. ‘‘Even if the captain does 
notice, the fact that the ship is designed to 
proceed at a steady pace means that it is un-
likely to attempt to stop for seals or maneu-
ver around them, even if the ship can be 
slowed or stopped in time.’’ 
Advocates also worry that increased Arctic 
production and shipping will hurt indigenous 
people; sever reindeer migration routes; im-
port invasive species to an environment ill- 
equipped to deal with them; and introduce 
the very remote, but potentially cata-
clysmic, danger of an LNG explosion. 
Finally, the gas pumped there will con-
tribute to global climate change. In some 
parts of the world, especially China, LNG 
may provide climate benefits by displacing 
dirtier coal. If LNG displaces gas carried by 
pipeline, however, the math works out dif-
ferently: Liquefied natural gas generally cre-
ates more emissions, since the process of 
cooling it to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit 
and then shipping and regasifying it requires 
more energy than pumping natural gas 
through all but the longest and leakiest 
pipelines. 
‘‘The bottom line is that because of the na-
ture of the liquefaction process, LNG is fair-
ly carbon intensive,’’ said Gavin Law, the 
head of gas, LNG, and carbon consulting for 
the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. 
The exact difference depends on factors like 
how much pipelines leak, carbon impurities 
in the gas, age of equipment, and distance 
shipped, but generally LNG produces 5 to 10 
percent more emissions over its whole life 
cycle from start to finish, he said. 
From a planetary perspective, it doesn’t 
matter where those emissions occur: Wheth-
er from the plant in Yamal, or the power 
plant in Everett, they have the same impact. 
The science should make the state’s deci-
sions straightforward. 
‘‘Natural gas has shown itself to be an im-
portant bridge to a clean energy future,’’ 
said Ernest J. Moniz, the former secretary of 
energy in the Obama administration. ‘‘For 
New England, expanding the pipeline capac-
ity from the Marcellus’’—the area of shale 
gas production in Pennsylvania—‘‘makes the 
most sense.’’ 
‘‘Life cycle emissions for LNG imports to 
Boston certainly are higher than they would 
be for more Marcellus gas,’’ he said. 
But the upstream emissions typically don’t 
show up on the books of states like Massa-
chusetts, which judge the success of their 
climate efforts based only on how much 
greenhouse gas they emit within their own 
borders. 
That’s an accounting fiction. But it’s a 
convenient one for lawmakers who’ve bowed 
to pressure to legislate based on what’s visi-
ble inside the Commonwealth’s own borders. 
FROM 
MASHPEE 
TO 
SPRINGFIELD, 
Taunton to Sudbury, the message was clear: 
To fight climate change, the state shouldn’t 
allow more fossil fuel pipelines or other in-
frastructure in Massachusetts. 
That’s what state senators Marc Pacheco 
and Jamie Eldridge, the heads of the state 
Senate’s Committee on Global Warming and 
Climate Change, heard when they conducted 
a listening tour of the state—whose results 
they released on the same day the Russian 
gas was unloading in Everett—to help pre-
pare a new energy bill. 
The resulting legislation was introduced 
this Monday. It contained many fine ideas, 
including boosting the state’s renewable en-
ergy requirements. But it also would raise 
obstacles to pipelines that would lock in the 
state’s reliance on foreign gas, with its high-
er carbon footprint. 
In an interview, Pacheco said ‘‘Obviously 
any fossil fuel investments are problematic,’’ 
no matter where they occur, but that ‘‘we 
have no control over what happens in Russia 
or anywhere else in the world.’’ Eldridge 
said, ‘‘I think this bill takes a big step to 
preventing pipelines,’’ and also expressed 
concern about the LNG the state imports in-
stead. ‘‘I think activists need to think about 
where a large amount of this gas is coming 
from, and that could be something the Legis-
lature could take a look at’’ in the future, he 
said. 
Theirs isn’t the first analysis to miss the 
larger picture. 
In 2015, the Conservation Law Foundation, 
a prominent environmental advocacy group 
in Boston, released a report dismissing the 
need for new pipeline capacity in New Eng-
land, and called on the region to rely on a 
‘‘winter-only LNG ’pipeline,’ ‘‘including im-
ported gas, to meet its winter energy needs 
instead.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3518 
July 20, 2022 
After the first shipload of Russian gas ar-
rived, David Ismay, a lawyer with the group, 
stood by the recommendation and shrugged 
off the purchase of Russian gas from the Arc-
tic as simply the nature of buying on the 
worldwide market. ‘‘I think it’s important to 
understand that LNG is a globally traded 
commodity,’’ he said in an interview with 
the Globe. 
The foundation, he said, hadn’t compared 
the overall greenhouse gas emissions from 
LNG to pipeline gas from the Marcellus to 
determine which was worse for the climate, 
nor had it factored the impact on the Arctic 
of gas production into its policy rec-
ommendations. 
But a state policy that doesn’t ask any 
questions about its fuel until the day the 
tanker floats into the Harbor abdicates the 
state’s responsibility to own up to all con-
sequences of its energy use—and mitigate 
the ones that it can. 
WHEN AN ICEBREAKER BEARS DOWN 
on a mother seal during the springtime 
breeding season, the terrified animal tries to 
scurry away with her pup. The two may 
leave a trail of urine and feces on the ice, 
telltale signs of their distress. Even if the 
animals survive the collision, the disruption 
may separate the mother and pup, leading to 
the pup’s death. 
Conscientious companies can minimize the 
cruel realities of global shipping—or con-
scientious governments can force them to. 
American law, for instance, requires ships to 
maintain a safe distance from seals and wal-
ruses in ice habitats. Wilson, the seal re-
searcher, also suggested that icebreakers can 
change routes to avoid known seal habitats, 
especially during the breeding season, and 
carry trained observers onboard to advise 
vessel captains and record any adverse im-
pact, particularly on mothers and young. 
The 
Globe 
attempted 
to 
contact 
Sovcomflot, the Russian state-owned shipper 
in St. Petersburg that handled the first leg 
of the first shipment from Siberia to Ever-
ett, about what policies, if any, it employs to 
avoid killing seals and other wildlife, and 
whether it would halt LNG shipments during 
the spring as mother seals nurse their pups 
in the Arctic. 
As of Monday night, it had not responded 
to e-mails. 
The policy of Massachusetts, apparently, is 
to hope that the Russians are on top of it— 
and that the world beyond the state’s bor-
ders manages the impacts of fossil fuel pro-
duction and transportation that the Com-
monwealth buys and uses, but considers 
itself too pure to handle itself. 
As of Monday night, the next shipment of 
Russian gas was anchored about 70 miles off 
Gloucester. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Again, these are far- 
left policies that are having a negative 
impact on actual environment and cli-
mate issues. This is the Boston Globe 
editorial page, not some rightwing edi-
torial page, and they are writing about 
how the Massachusetts State legisla-
ture said: We are not going to have any 
pipelines coming across Massachusetts 
to be able to take gas from Pennsyl-
vania and let people in Boston use it. 
Here is the editorial page on Massa-
chusetts’ reliance on imported gas. So 
what happens? They are importing all 
of their gas from Russia in the Arctic. 
How does that help America? You have 
American gas from American pipelines 
that is produced by Americans, with 
the highest environmental standards, 
coming across Massachusetts to Bos-
ton. 
No. The Massachusetts State legisla-
ture says: We are too good for that. We 
are not going to build pipelines. 
So what do they do? They import all 
of their gas from Russia. 
This is an editorial that says: This 
policy is insane, and that is, in essence, 
the definition of what we are seeing by 
the Biden administration, by John 
Kerry, and by the Massachusetts State 
legislature—all of these woke pro-
nouncements that actually have the 
impact of degrading our environment, 
empowering dictators, laying off Amer-
icans, and raising the price of energy 
on our economy, small businesses, and 
working families. 
So I am hopeful that today, in Bos-
ton, the President starts to get serious 
about American energy policy and that 
he starts to reverse his administra-
tion’s focus on shutting down the pro-
duction of American energy, on permit-
ting pipelines and infrastructure, and 
on helping to finance energy projects 
and production. That is the reversal he 
could make and announce today. That 
would help the American people. It 
would help my constituents. 
Unfortunately, I think that it is un-
likely to happen. The people of our 
great Nation are going to continue to 
suffer, and the environment is going to 
continue to suffer because of these 
policies on energy that undermine 
American interests everywhere you 
look. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. 
MORAN. 
Madam 
President, 
thank you for the opportunity to ad-
dress you and my colleagues here on 
the Senate floor this afternoon. 
While Kansans are dealing, Ameri-
cans are dealing every day with sky-
rocketing gas prices, record-high infla-
tion, and supply chain shortages, Presi-
dent Biden traveled to Saudi Arabia to 
make a plea for greater oil production 
availability. What he should be doing is 
asking Americans and giving them the 
opportunity to unleash the potential of 
our own ability to supply oil. We have 
seen days and we enjoyed the days in 
which America was generally energy 
independent, and it would be a wonder-
ful day to return to. 
My State of Kansas is an energy-pro-
ducing State, and we could help in-
crease supply and cut costs at the 
pump, but instead President Biden 
chooses our foreign adversaries for as-
sistance. Kansas ranks 11th in oil pro-
duction and 14th in the production of 
natural gas. Kansas is also the ninth 
largest ethanol-producing State. That 
industry supports over 115,000 oil and 
gas jobs in Kansas. 
Our producers and our refiners stand 
ready to meet the growing demand for 
American energy. But since the first 
day in office and really before assum-
ing office, the President has sought to 
constrain the oil and gas sectors’ ac-
cess to capital. I don’t know how many 
times in the Banking Committee we 
were dealing with this issue of whether 
or not a regulator could regulate finan-
cial institutions, with the goal of 
eliminating their ability to finance oil 
and gas production. 
In addition to trying to limit access 
to capital, he blocked construction of 
pipelines and has proposed burdensome 
new regulations on oil and gas pro-
ducers. 
My guess is that this is done for the 
purposes of reducing the use of fossil 
fuels, the environment-climate agenda. 
But it is so hypocritical for us, as 
Americans, for President Biden to be 
asking others who produce oil to in-
crease their production. If it is about 
the environment and about climate, 
you wouldn’t ask anybody to increase 
their production. And I have no doubt 
that here in the United States, we do it 
right as far as refining oil and gas into 
other products in a way that is the 
most environmentally sound way of 
doing it compared to places like Ven-
ezuela, Libya, where the President also 
asked that they increase their produc-
tion for the benefit of American con-
sumers. 
The thing to do for us to increase our 
energy production and reduce the price 
at the pump—and we talk about prices 
at the pump so easily. The cost of oil 
and natural gas has a consequence on 
things way beyond the price at the 
pump. It is not just about gasoline. 
Natural gas, for example, is used in the 
production of fertilizer for our farmers 
who struggle today, with the cost of 
production being astronomically high-
er than it was before, but almost every 
product that we buy that is more ex-
pensive today than it was previously 
has an oil and gas component to it. 
The request by President Biden to 
reach out to our adversaries for oil on 
the world stage, appealing to our ad-
versaries for increased production, not 
only singles out our weakness but is 
also unnecessary. The United States 
has the resources, the expertise, and 
the domestic demand to be an energy- 
independent nation, and Kansas has 
the opportunity to be a participant in 
that, with additional jobs and a better 
America. 
We should see the impending energy 
crisis in Europe as a case study for why 
domestic energy production ought to 
be supported to the fullest extent in 
the United States. Additionally, our 
dependence upon energy from some-
place else has huge consequences in our 
foreign relations, our military pre-
paredness, and our national security. 
A far more enduring solution than 
wandering around the world with a tin 
cup out—far more stable and affordable 
energy prices to fill our vehicles, power 
our homes, or to operate our farms—is 
for the President to support an all-out, 
‘‘all of the above’’ domestic energy 
strategy. This includes investments in 
new and existing energy infrastructure 
like refineries; expanding oil, biofuels, 
and ethanol production; and new EV 
manufacturing—incidentally, although 
certainly not an incidental thing, like 
the $4 billion Panasonic EV manufac-
turing plant we announced last week

for Kansas. We ought to be interested, 
again, in solar and wind energy. Kansas 
is the third highest producer of wind 
energy, wind power, in the United 
States. 
The Biden administration must—I 
asked them to shift course and pro-
mote an ‘‘all of the above’’ strategy 
that produces more U.S. energy from 
all sources. It benefits America; it ben-
efits the world; and it especially bene-
fits the consumers who are hurting so 
much at the grocery store and the gas 
pump and utility bills. 
We need to weaken our reliance on 
foreign adversaries, and we need to in-
crease the production of energy in the 
United States. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that I be per-
mitted to speak for up to 5 minutes and 
Senator DURBIN for up to 15 minutes 
prior to the scheduled vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I am happy to come to the floor today 
to join my colleague the Senator from 
Alaska, Mr. SULLIVAN, as well as my 
colleague from Kansas, to talk about 
where we are with this administration 
or where, unfortunately, we aren’t 
when it comes to prioritizing Amer-
ican-made energy. 
As has been noted here on the floor 
by my colleagues, the President has 
just returned from the Middle East. It 
wasn’t for a sightseeing trip; it was 
really all about oil. He was talking 
about oil. Above all, the President 
made that trip to ask the leaders of 
several foreign nations, members of 
OPEC, to increase their production lev-
els. 
OK, we get it. Gasoline prices are 
way too high. We know that. We have 
hit national records in recent weeks. 
They are averaging right now about 
$5.32 a gallon in my State. That is ac-
tually down a little bit from where we 
were last month, but it is up over 50 
percent from where we were last year. 
As has been said repeatedly, and we 
don’t need to say it here on the floor of 
the Senate, people are feeling it in 
their homes. They are feeling it in 
their pocketbooks. Families are. Busi-
nesses are. Whether you are in places 
like Anchorage or Fairbanks, your 
budgets are stretched thinner and thin-
ner and thinner. 
It is increasingly difficult for small 
tourist operations, whether you are 
trying to take people out on sight-
seeing trips in the air or on the water. 
Our fishing fleets have to fill up their 
fishing vessels. But especially, particu-
larly, our outlying villages—these vil-
lages that are off the road system— 
that already faced high prices, now the 
prices are astronomical. 
I met with some leaders from the 
Northwest Arctic Borough just a few 
days ago, and they shared with me that 
in many of their communities, the 
communities were paying about $5.25 
on average. But these were prices that 
were locked in from last fall when the 
last fuel barge came into those north-
ern waters and was able to make its 
way up the river systems. Now, with 
the first spring barge comes literally— 
literally—in 1 day going from $5.25 to 
over $8 a gallon. That is a lock-in price 
that they are going to be living with 
until that next barge. 
Think about what that means when 
you are a community that is locked 
into these extraordinarily high prices. 
When that last fuel barge comes, you 
are going to have small villages that 
are going to be looking to see how 
much—not how much do we need to get 
through the winter but how much can 
we afford? They don’t have much of a 
tax base. How much can we afford? 
My theory is that they are only going 
to be able to buy as much as they can, 
and it is not going to be enough to get 
them through the winter. So halfway 
through the winter, in the darkest and 
coldest, when everything is locked in 
the ice, they are going to run out of 
fuel. And you have to be able to keep 
the heat on or everything breaks. So 
how do you get the fuel? You fly it in. 
Think about what those costs then be-
come. So for us in Alaska, this is not 
only frightening, but it has the poten-
tial to just be catastrophic as we look 
at no end in sight for these prices. 
I don’t begrudge the President for 
meeting with world leaders. We expect 
him to do this. And I think it is a great 
idea to do what we can to increase sup-
ply to reduce prices. This is kind of the 
basics of supply and demand. I have 
championed this for years. Let’s in-
crease our supply. But the question is 
where that energy is going to come 
from. Where should we focus our time? 
Where should we focus our efforts? I 
think it just has to begin at home. It 
has to be here. 
But apparently this administration 
has decided they are going to go else-
where. They are going to seek oil from 
the Middle East. They are sending en-
voys to Venezuela. They are pushing 
for a weakened Iran deal, signaling 
that oil from the two worst regimes in 
the world could somehow come back 
online? This makes zero sense to me. It 
just makes no sense. Why would we do 
this? Why would we go abroad when we 
have the resources here? Why choose 
oil produced at low environmental 
standards, like my friend from Kansas 
just said? You are going to countries 
that have lower environmental stand-
ards and track records when it comes 
to human rights abuses, and we are 
just going to turn our eye to it? We are 
just going to close our eyes and say 
that is OK now? No, it is not OK. 
Why? Why do we give fist bumps to 
leaders while sucker-punching the pro-
ducers, the refiners, and the gas sta-
tion owners in our own domestic indus-
try? Unfortunately, that is what we are 
seeing. We are seeing that happen in 
my State. We have billions of barrels of 
oil in our Federal areas. We have a 
world-class pipeline that is one-quarter 
full and a general refusal from the ad-
ministration to help us do much of 
anything about it. 
We can talk about the 1002 area, the 
largest untapped conventional oilfield 
in North America, is what is projected, 
but you are not seeing this administra-
tion pushing forward with that even 
though 
we 
mandated—even 
though 
Congress mandated this in 2017. Not a 
chance. They are not moving forward 
with that. They have halted all devel-
opment—illegally, I might add. 
But also take the 5-year plan, the 
proposed 5-year plan. It is long over-
due. Now we are learning that the ad-
ministration may not hold a single off-
shore lease through 2028. They are pro-
posing a single sale in Cook Inlet in 
Alaska after canceling the one that 
was just supposed to have been held, 
suggesting that they are OK, they are 
somehow OK with crimping the only 
source of natural gas for hundreds of 
thousands of Alaskans. 
Again, this direction just makes no 
sense to me. We need a course correc-
tion from the Biden administration. 
Even as we are moving forward in so 
many other initiatives, we need to 
have a strategic plan that assures that 
our own energy security—our own en-
ergy security—is addressed and also 
helping to improve the energy security 
of our allies. 
I believe that we can do this without 
taking our eye off the ball of what we 
need to do to reduce emissions to ad-
dress the challenges that face us when 
it comes to climate. But we have to ac-
knowledge that the world has changed. 
There is still, though, no substitute or 
equal for American energy. So what we 
need is for common sense to prevail 
over wishful thinking. We need re-
source development here at home in 
places like Alaska and Kansas. They 
need to be our first and our highest pri-
ority. The longer it takes for that to 
happen, the greater the price that 
Alaskans will be paying and all Ameri-
cans will be paying. 
I yield the floor.

jority whip. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
was on the floor 2 days ago when the 
Republican Senate leader came to the 
floor and said something which I still 
don’t quite understand, and I would 
like to refer to it in a statement. 
CLOTURE MOTION WITHDRAWN 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to withdraw the 
cloture motion with respect to the 
Merle nomination. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Not hearing an objection, it is with-
drawn. 
The cloture motion, on the nomina-
tion of Natasha C. Merle, of New York, 
to be United States District Judge for 
the Eastern District of New York, was 
withdrawn.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3520 
July 20, 2022 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that following the 
confirmation vote on the Williams 
nomination, the Senate vote on the 
confirmation of Executive Calendar 
No. 920, the nomination of Bernadette 
M. Meehan, of New York, to be Ambas-
sador 
Extraordinary 
and 
Pleni-
potentiary of the United States of 
America to the Republic of Chile. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, now, 
back to my statement. 
I came to the floor and heard a 
speech by the Republican leader, MITCH 
MCCONNELL
of 
Kentucky. 
Now, 
it 
wasn’t the first. I have heard many, 
and I listen closely so that I can divine 
the strategy of Senate Republicans. 
And for weeks we have heard speeches 
about the plight of American families 
dealing with inflation. It is a real prob-
lem. If you go to buy anything these 
days, you are shocked by the price, 
starting at the gas pump, if you have 
aspirations to buy a car or truck, ordi-
nary food items—much more expensive. 
Most families are not seeing any in-
crease in income so it is a real hardship 
for them to keep up. 
Well, the Senator from Kentucky has 
given that speech so many times, I 
could almost repeat it verbatim. And I 
don’t quarrel with his premise. Infla-
tion is painful for working families. 
But then—but then—he went into an 
area of pricing and took an exactly op-
posite point of view. What he said was 
he thought, if there was an effort to 
control the price of prescription drugs, 
it was ‘‘socialist price control,’’ it was 
really asking for something for noth-
ing, and he didn’t support it. 
And I stopped to think for a second. 
Wait a minute. All the polling, when 
you ask American families what they 
worry about, tells you that this is a big 
headache for families. They go to a 
doctor. Somebody is sick. The doctor 
prescribes a drug. They take the pre-
scription to the drug store. They get it 
filled. And then comes the moment of 
truth, the moment at the cash register 
when the family is told: Incidentally, 
that will cost you $100, $200, $300 over 
your insurance coverage. 
And you know what some families 
say? 
I wish I could afford that; I can’t. 
And they don’t pick up the drug or 
they pick it up and, instead of taking 
it, they kind of wait and say: I will see 
if I get any better by myself. They do 
the wrong thing because of the cost of 
prescription drugs. 
So when the Republican Senators 
come to the floor every day talking 
about family expenses, it comes as a 
shock to know that they are planning 
to oppose the Democratic effort to es-
tablish prescription drug pricing. They 
complain about high prices for every-
thing else, but they don’t seem to want 
to do anything when it comes to pre-
scription drugs. 
Americans pay the highest prices in 
the world for prescription drugs, an av-
erage of nearly four times as much paid 
by an American family for exactly the 
same drugs that are being sold in Can-
ada and Europe. Where are those drugs 
made? All made in the same place, all 
made by the same company, four times 
the cost for America. 
To add insult to injury, many of 
these prescription drugs only exist be-
cause of the successful investment by 
American taxpayers in the National In-
stitutes of Health. The National Insti-
tutes of Health is an amazing research 
organization. They do the research, the 
basic research. The drug companies 
capitalize on it, make the drugs, and 
sell them at a profit. So taxpayers pay 
on the front end for the drugs. Amer-
ican taxpayers and tax-paying families 
pay on the back end for the actual cost 
of the pharmaceuticals. 
Out-of-control 
prescription 
costs 
aren’t just hurting people financially; 
they hurt the health of Americans. One 
in five Americans don’t take the medi-
cations as prescribed because they 
can’t afford them. They cut their pills 
in half or they skip doses because they 
can’t do it; they can’t pay it. 
‘‘Your money or your life’’—you ex-
pect to hear that from a stickup artist, 
not from a pharmaceutical company. 
That is the choice Americans face. 
So we want to do something about it. 
Democrats don’t want to hear speeches 
about the costs to families. We want to 
do something. We want to bring down 
the cost of prescription drugs for sen-
iors first and then for families in gen-
eral. 
If you really care about inflation, 
most families would say, start with 
prescription drugs. That is what we are 
doing. And the Republicans are going 
to oppose this. 
Ironically, Senator MCCONNELL gives 
a speech calling it socialism to deal 
with the cost of prescription drugs, 
and, within an hour, the senior Senator 
from Iowa gives a speech on the floor of 
the Senate—Republican Senator—how 
he wants to cut prescription drug 
prices for seniors. One of them didn’t 
get the message at the caucus. I think 
the Senator from Iowa is right, inci-
dentally. 
So Democrats are proposing to allow 
Medicare to negotiate fair prices for 
drugs. We have been doing that for a 
long time when it comes to the Vet-
erans’ Administration. The Veterans’ 
Administration buys a lot of prescrip-
tion drugs for our veterans—and I am 
glad they do—and they negotiate with 
these companies to get a fair price. We 
think Medicare ought to do the same 
thing. It reduces the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs. It makes them more afford-
able for seniors. 
Now, a lot of people say: Well, if you 
do that, then the prescription drug 
companies, the pharmaceutical compa-
nies, just aren’t going to be able to 
make it. 
Well, here is the reality. Studies have 
found that Big Pharma could lose $1 
trillion in sales over the next decade 
and still remain the most profitable in-
dustry in America—lose $1 trillion in 
sales and still be the most profitable 
industry. Higher profit margins in 
pharma than in the telecom industry, 
than in the defense industry, in the 
banking industry, and the Republicans 
are saying they are afraid that they 
are going to get hurt if consumers can 
buy drugs at lower prices. 
But good news for those who fear 
that if you cut the amount of money 
going to pharma, it will cut research. 
That is not what we have learned. We 
know Bayer. It has been around a long 
time. It started off as a German com-
pany. It made aspirin. Now they have 
made some sizable acquisitions in the 
business. 
They make a drug called Xarelto. 
Now, you would have to watch that tel-
evision ad 10 or 12 times to be able to 
spell ‘‘Xarelto,’’ but they are trying to 
convince American consumers they 
can’t live without it. Bayer spent $18 
billion on sales and marketing last 
year compared to $8 billion on research 
for drugs. 
Johnson & Johnson: $22 billion on 
sales and marketing, $12 billion on re-
search. GlaxoSmithKline: $15 billion on 
sales and marketing, $7 billion on re-
search. 
Get the pattern? There is more 
money being spent on advertising than 
on research for new drugs. Americans 
get bombarded with nine drug ads on 
TV every day telling them to ask their 
doctor for the newest wonder drug. 
There are only two nations on Earth 
where you can legally advertise pre-
scription drugs on television. One, of 
course, is the United States. The other, 
for some reason, is New Zealand. Fill-
ing the airwaves with ads is what Big 
Pharma does to try to convince cus-
tomers they can’t live without their 
drugs. 
So the claim that allowing Medicare 
to negotiate a reasonable price for sen-
iors will freeze out Big Pharma’ s inno-
vation just doesn’t wash. 
Senator MCCONNELL says there is no 
‘‘free lunch’’ when it comes to prescrip-
tion drug pricing. Let’s keep in mind 
that the 14 largest drug corporations 
spent more on stock buybacks—lining 
the pockets of their CEOs—than on re-
search and development over the past 5 
years. 
So here is what it comes down to. 
Look at these, just as an illustration. I 
will do this quickly because Members 
are showing up to vote. Insulin, discov-
ered by Canadian researchers at the be-
ginning of the 20th century—they sur-
rendered the patent for the drug for a 
dollar so that it would never be over-
charged to consumers because it is a 
life-or-death drug for those suffering 
from diabetes. 
Take a look, from the year 2004 to 
the year 2022, at what has happened to 
the drug insulin cost—insulin cost—on 
a regular basis, the manufacturing 
price by year. You can see it tracks all 
the companies that make insulin. It is

as high as $300 a dose, and a person suf-
fering from diabetes may need three 
doses a month—$900 for insulin. 
Well, let’s take a comparative cost 
and take a look at what insulin costs 
in other countries. The United States, 
while it is paying $98 for a dose of insu-
lin—look—Japan is paying $14; Canada, 
$12; Germany, $11; France, $9; UK, $7; 
Australia, $6, $7. And the good news is 
these are the same companies, the 
American companies, charging a frac-
tion of the cost to the other countries 
for insulin. This is one of the drugs 
which we are working on now, Senator 
SHAHEEN and others, to bring down the 
cost. 
I am going to close by saying this. If 
you care about the costs that families 
face, if you care about inflation, and 
you care about life-or-death medica-
tions, and you want to make them af-
fordable, don’t take the position of 
Senator MCCONNELL that this is social-
ism to demand negotiation in pricing. 
Don’t take his position that it is just a 
free lunch to say that people will never 
have to pay more than $2,000 a year out 
of pocket for drugs. This is a life-or- 
death decision. Even 70 percent of Re-
publicans agree with that. 
I wish the Senate Republicans would 
agree with it and join us in supporting 
this bill. 
NOMINATION OF GREGORY BRIAN WILLIAMS 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today, the Senate will continue its 
vital work of confirming highly quali-
fied judicial nominees to the Federal 
bench. We will vote on an outstanding 
district court nominee: Gregory Wil-
liams to the District of Delaware. 
Mr. Williams is currently a partner 
at the firm Fox Rothschild LLP, where 
he has an extensive trial practice that 
focuses on intellectual property and 
other matters. Mr. Williams joined the 
firm immediately after law school, ris-
ing through the ranks to become the 
first African-American equity partner 
in the firm’s history. 
In addition to his work in private 
practice, Mr. Williams has dedicated 
countless hours to serving the Dela-
ware legal and judicial communities. 
He has worked as a Special Master in 
complex civil cases for the District of 
Delaware; as president of the Delaware 
State Bar Association; and as chair of 
the State’s judicial nominating com-
mission. A graduate of Millersville 
University 
of 
Pennsylvania 
and 
Villanova University School of Law, 
Mr. Williams received a unanimous 
‘‘well qualified’’ rating from the Amer-
ican Bar Association and has the 
strong support of Delaware’s Senators, 
Mr. CARPER and Mr. COONS. With his 
depth of experience and impeccable 
credentials, Mr. Williams will serve 
Delaware with distinction. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this outstanding nominees. 
I yield the floor. 
VOTE ON WILLIAMS NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, all postcloture time 
has expired. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Williams nomi-
nation? 
Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
called the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from Vermont (Mr. LEAHY), 
the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. 
MARKEY), the Senator from Massachu-
setts (Ms. WARREN), and the Senator

Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-

Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Across the 
country, American families are fight-
ing harder every week to make ends 
meet as they deal with President 
Biden’s raging inflation crisis. Food 
prices are up. Gas prices remain at un-
bearably high levels, and too many 
families are having to make the impos-
sible decision of whether to put gas in 
the tank or food on the table. It is so 
tough to be a family in that position. 
I know all too well how this feels and 
the impacts these high prices have on 
families. I grew up in a poor family, 
with a mom who worked long hours at 
her job and also picked up odd jobs just 
so our family could get by. We never 
had any extra money, so when prices 
went up, we had to go without. 
Families all across the country are in 
that same spot. People who have never 
visited food banks are having to turn 
to them to feed their families. Folks 
are being forced to pawn their things 
just to afford gas. It is heartbreaking 
and makes me furious. Reports are 
showing it is happening across Amer-
ica—in Reno, NV; Macon, GA; Yakima, 
WA; and the cities in my home State of 
Florida, 
like 
Pensacola 
and 
Fort 
Myers. These people have to turn to 
their local pawn shops as they see their 
monthly bills grow higher and higher. 
When President Biden said that we are 
going through ‘‘an incredible transi-
tion,’’ is this what he meant—Mom and 
Dad having to sell Bobby’s PlayStation 
and Suzy’s doll collection just so they 
can afford to take them to school? 
Since day 1, President Biden has led 
a campaign against energy independ-
ence. The White House, EPA, the De-
partment of the Interior, and the De-
partment of Energy have done every-
thing in their power to make life more 
expensive for American families. They 
have implemented one policy after an-
other to raise the price of gas and 
make life tougher and tougher for 
hard-working families. 
The American people deserve trans-
parency into Biden’s Green New Deal 
agenda and ought to know why these 
prices keep going up. That is why I in-
troduced the GAS PRICE Act last Oc-
tober. Even then, far before the hor-
rible war in Ukraine began, gas prices 
were surging higher. 
My bill is pretty simple. It would re-
quire the Energy Information Adminis-
tration to report to Congress on any 
Federal Agency policies or regulations 
that it determines will cause energy 
prices to rise. All it does is ask a Fed-
eral Agency to provide information to 
Congress with a statement of facts on 
what is causing rising energy prices. 
Then we can take this information, see 
what needs to be fixed, and help the 
American people. 
I want to thank Senators MARSHALL, 
LUMMIS, 
CAPITO, 
JOHNSON, 
MORAN, 
BLACKBURN, and KENNEDY for cospon-
soring this legislation. I also want to 
thank Senator SULLIVAN and Senator 
LEE for joining me here on the floor 
today to talk about the energy infla-
tion Joe Biden is imposing on Ameri-
cans. 
Considering that we, as Senators, are 
trusted by the people of our States to 
enact policies that improve their lives, 
I cannot imagine why anyone would 
oppose this legislation. Sadly, when I 
came to the Senate floor last year to 
pass this bill, Senate Democrats op-
posed it. 
At that time, I noted that the na-
tional average cost was $3.36 per gal-
lon. Sounds like a bargain today. Since 
then, the price of gas has risen dra-
matically. The average has increased 
to $4.46. In 15 of the 17 months Joe 
Biden has been in office, the price of 
gas has risen. 
When I introduced my bill in Octo-
ber, President Biden said he didn’t 
‘‘have a near-term answer’’ for reduc-
ing gas prices. Well, clearly not—his 
answer was to raise prices and continue 
his radical Green New Deal agenda. 
Senate Republicans, meanwhile, do 
have a plan and have offered solutions. 
I have introduced the FREE American 
Energy Act to expedite the Federal 
Agencies’ review process of applica-
tions for permits, waivers, licenses, or 
other authorizations related to energy 
production. But we can take a simple 
first step today by giving ourselves 
more information on rising energy 
prices and pass my GAS Price Act. 
For the sake of American families, 
we need to figure out what the heck is 
going on. So while my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle blocked my 
bill from passing last year, my hope 
was that, as they have watched their 
constituents suffer for months now 
under Biden’s leadership, they would 
have a change of heart. Sadly, that is 
not what happened today. It is an abso-
lute shame what has happened in this 
Chamber. 
I came here with my Republican col-
leagues to promote and pass legislation 
that would improve the lives of Amer-
ican people and make America less de-
pendent on foreign oil. We came here 
asking for answers into Biden’s Green 
New Deal agenda. We are here respond-
ing to the pain American families are 
facing at the gas pump and trying to 
solve problems. 
Senate Democrats, meanwhile, have 
come here to obstruct and blame shift. 
They didn’t come here to solve prob-
lems. They didn’t come here with a dif-
ferent proposal that would alleviate 
gas prices and ensure long-term energy 
independence and sustainability. They 
came here to make the problem worse. 
They want to emulate the policies of 
Germany and California, where rolling 
blackouts and energy rations are a 
looming threat and where gas has 
spent most of this year at over $6 per 
gallon. 
This is not the way forward. The Sen-
ate need leaders who are going to come 
in and put Americans first. I am grate-
ful for colleagues like Senator SUL-
LIVAN and Senator LEE, who are here to 
do that. But I hope the American peo-
ple have been watching what has hap-
pened today and see who it is who real-
ly cares about the problems they are 
facing. 
I yield the floor to my colleague from 
Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Thank you to the Senator 
from Florida. 
Mr. President, President Biden has 
wasted no time—no time at all—in em-
barking on his crusade to hamstring 
American energy production. 
On day 1 of his Presidency, President 
Biden halted all new oil and gas lease 
sales on Federal land. Now Americans 
are paying the price. Across the Na-
tion, people struggle to fill their gas 
tanks, as prices climb to over $5 a gal-
lon, but there is apparently no need to 
worry. According to the President, 
Americans’ pain at the pump is merely 
part of an energy ‘‘transition,’’ as he 
puts it. 
It is important to note here that this 
transition is a transition away from af-
fordable, reliable fossil fuels. 
It is not that high gas prices are a 
problem to be fixed but, rather, high 
gas prices somehow are the solution. 
They are what will facilitate this tran-
sition. The President is getting the re-
sults that he wants. This is a feature, 
the ultimate feature. It is the end goal, 
not a bug in his plan. 
Despite this being part of the plan 
and, in fact, his objective, it didn’t 
take long for the President to realize 
how unpopular high gasoline prices 
really are. Now he is trying to take 
credit for even a slight reduction in 
gasoline prices. First, by no means is 
this reduction sufficient. Second, we 
can’t attribute that reduction to the 
President’s policies. 
To be clear, placing a moratorium on 
the sale of oil and gas leases on Federal 
land is outside the President’s author-
ity. If the President actually possessed 
that authority, he wouldn’t have at-
tempted to portray this as a temporary 
pause. It is clear that this is a thinly 
veiled attempt to enact the most rad-
ical climate policies our country has

July 20, 2022 
ever seen—policies that have never 
been enacted by Congress and policies 
that Congress would not enact. 
Our suspicions were confirmed when 
Gina McCarthy, the President’s cli-
mate adviser, said during an interview: 
President Biden remains absolutely com-
mitted to not moving forward with addi-
tional drilling on public lands. 
So much for a temporary morato-
rium. 
Confused 
as 
to 
whether 
Ms. 
McCarthy’s statement represented the 
administration’s policy, I asked Inte-
rior Secretary Deb Haaland whether it 
was indeed the administration’s inten-
tion to indefinitely pause the sale of all 
Federal oil and gas leases. She re-
sponded: ‘‘I don’t know.’’ 
‘‘I don’t know’’ is not an acceptable 
answer to the Utah communities who 
rely on those oil and gas leases. ‘‘I 
don’t know’’ is not an acceptable an-
swer to Americans paying over $5 a gal-
lon for gas. ‘‘I don’t know’’ isn’t an an-
swer to the Americans who have found 
every aspect of their lives rendered 
unaffordable by this administration’s 
policies, and now this only adds insult 
to injury. 
The American people simply cannot 
endure President Biden’s clear-as-mud 
policies any longer. I have introduced 
legislation to reaffirm that under the 
Mineral Leasing Act, the President of 
the United States absolutely does not 
have the authority to hold the coun-
try’s domestic energy production hos-
tage. Their continued efforts are com-
ing at the expense of struggling fami-
lies. 
The Biden administration is fighting 
in court for Presidential authority to 
enact sweeping changes to American 
energy policy on a whim. While I be-
lieve the courts will arrive at the same 
conclusion, we can act now to ensure 
citizens and companies receive the cer-
tainty they deserve. 
We could end this crusade today if we 
enacted this legislation and get to 
work securing American energy inde-
pendence for generations to come. It is 
for that reason that I was disappointed 
when my friend and colleague on the 
other side of the aisle came and ob-
jected to passing this by unanimous 
consent today. It does, in fact, state 
what the law already provides anyway. 
It shouldn’t hurt us to make it obvious. 
Yet he objected even though this policy 
is harming the American people. 
It is disappointing that it had to end 
this way today, but this is not over. 
No, we will be back. We will be back as 
often and for as long as it takes in 
order to give the American people the 
relief that they need and that they 
definitely deserve. 
Now I yield the time to my friend 
and colleague, the Senator from Alas-
ka. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Thank you to my 
friends from the great State of Utah 
and the great State of Florida, Senator 
SCOTT and Senator LEE. 
Mr. President, I want to explain to 
any American who is watching just 
what happened here because, to be hon-
est, it is kind of shocking what just 
took place. 
Senator SCOTT
came down to the 
floor. He had a bill, S. 3086. Normally 
when you have a bill that is considered 
pretty noncontroversial, you can come 
down and do what is called a unani-
mous consent, which is you ask the 
Senate: Do you want to pass the bill? 
And if anyone objects, they actually 
have to come down and object in the 
Senate Chamber. 
So what does S. 3086 bill do? Here is 
the language: ‘‘to require the Energy 
Information Administration to submit 
to Congress and make publicly avail-
able an annual report on Federal Agen-
cy policies and regulations and Execu-
tive orders that have increased or may 
increase energy prices in the United 
States.’’ That is it. That is it. That is 
the bill. It is one page—less than one 
page. It is two paragraphs. 
All we were doing was asking, why 
are energy prices in America going 
through the roof, and is the Federal 
Government 
contributing 
to 
that 
through its actions and regulations? It 
is a really important question. Why is 
it an important question? It is an im-
portant question because when you get 
out of this bubble in DC and you go 
home—like I was just home in Alaska 
last weekend—energy costs and infla-
tion are the No. 1 issue hurting Amer-
ican families—the No. 1 issue. So 
shouldn’t we in the Senate want to 
know why it is happening? 
Now, look, what else happened here— 
a little bit of inside baseball in the 
Senate—when a Senator comes down 
and objects to a UC, usually he gives a 
strong reason why—strong: Here is my 
reason why this bill is bad for the 
country, and I am going to object. 
You may have seen my colleague ob-
ject and say ‘‘I am getting the heck out 
of here; I am not going to explain this’’ 
because there is no reason to object to 
this—none. So he objected and left. He 
didn’t try to defend objecting to this, 
because 
every 
American 
wants 
to 
know. 
It is the biggest issue back home, but 
here is another reason we need the bill: 
because this President has come up 
with excuse after excuse after excuse 
on why energy costs since he got into 
office have gone through the roof. Let 
me give you a couple of examples. 
He first said: Well, we are emerging 
from the pandemic, and the supply 
chain couldn’t keep up with demand. 
All right, if that is really true, let 
the Energy Information Administra-
tion—of the Biden administration, by 
the way—see if that is one of the rea-
sons. 
OK. Then he said: Well, shoot, the 
pandemic is kind of over so it is 
Putin’s invasion of Ukraine that is 
driving the increase in energy prices. 
Putin’s unprovoked, brutal war—which 
it is unprovoked and brutal—has led to 
higher energy prices. 
And President Biden then started to 
say it is Putin’s price hike. No one is 
buying that one either because energy 
prices were spiking way before the bru-
tal invasion of Ukraine. 
So then the President started saying: 
Well, it is COVID and Putin. OK. Then 
he started blaming the oil companies. 
Then he started to say: Well, we have 
all these amazing permits that we want 
the oil companies drilling on, but they 
are not using them. 
So we need Senator SCOTT’s legisla-
tion because the Biden administration, 
the President himself, has put out all 
these ideas on why Americans are get-
ting crushed by inflation and high 
costs at the pump. Yet the one thing 
the President hasn’t done, has never 
talked about, is he hasn’t looked inter-
nally and said: Hmm, maybe it is my 
own administration’s policies that are 
driving up energy costs. Maybe. By the 
way, it is not maybe; it is certainly. 
And my colleagues have talked about 
this. Heck, I talked about this earlier 
today. I talk about it every day be-
cause it is crushing my home State and 
my constituents. 
But what we want the Energy Infor-
mation Administration to look at is 
possibly these reasons: Day 1, this ad-
ministration came in and said: We are 
going to limit production of American 
energy. 
Anyone who went to econ 101 in col-
lege knows that when you start to 
limit supply, prices go up. Well, that is 
a culprit. 
No. 2, from day 1, they said: We are 
going to shut down, kill, and delay 
moving 
energy 
through 
infrastruc-
ture—pipelines, LNG terminals. They 
are doing that all the time. So that is 
a policy, those are Executive orders 
limiting the ability to move energy. 
That sends up costs. 
No. 3 is that they have actively gone 
to the American financial sector—the 
Biden administration—and told them 
not to invest in American energy, 
choking off capital. That increases 
prices. 
So Senator SCOTT’s bill would simply 
ask the experts in the Federal Govern-
ment, the Energy Information Admin-
istration, to just take a look: What is 
driving up the cost of American en-
ergy? What is crushing middle-class 
working families? 
And the reason my colleague ob-
jected and then ran off the floor with-
out saying anything is because every-
body here knows what the answer is 
going to be: Joe Biden has done this. It 
is his policies that are driving up en-
ergy costs. 
And here is the thing that Senator 
LEE touched on, and this is the thing 
that should scare everybody. It is like-
ly purposeful. Pain is the point. They 
are all talking about this wonderful, 
glorious transition. Gina McCarthy 
talks about: Hey, if the prices go up, it 
will accelerate the transition to renew-
ables. They don’t give a damn about 
the people who are suffering. It is all 
this green utopia stuff. 
All we are asking for is what is driv-
ing up the cost of energy on the backs 
of working-class Americans? That is it. 
A two-paragraph bill, and my col-
leagues came and objected to it. And

every American should know this. 
They don’t want you to know what we 
all know, which is this: The pain at the 
pump is the purposeful policies of the 
Biden administration, and the Amer-
ican people are paying for it. 
We want the Federal Government to 
look into the details of this, and the 
Democrats were just now objecting to 
that transparent information request. 
And, in my view, it is shameful. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
(The remarks of Mr. MANCHIN and 
Ms. COLLINS pertaining to the intro-
duction of S. 4573 and S. 4574 are print-
ed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘State-
ments on Introduced Bills and Joint 
Resolutions.’’) 
Ms. COLLINS. I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Oklahoma. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
if this body were to look at the tests 
and the homework, the quizzes, and the 
essays of the Department of Homeland 
Security and give them a grade based 
on their performance for the last year 
and a half, what would the grade be? 
DHS says they have six missions, and 
they detail out those missions. One of 
those missions reads: Secure U.S. bor-
ders and approaches. Then they give 
this little piece behind it to describe 
that. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity secures the Nation’s air, land, and 
sea borders to prevent illegal activity 
while facilitating lawful travel and 
trade. What would their grade be on 
that? And is anyone going to hold them 
to account for their grade or is this 
body going to continue to just ignore 
what is happening on the southern bor-
der? 
It is the role, it is the task, it is the 
responsibility of the Department of 
Homeland Security to help secure our 
Nation, but this Department is cur-
rently facilitating illegal immigration, 
not stopping illegal immigration. 
I wish I was wrong on that, but I am 
not. In fact, as recent as the last 2 
weeks, I met with DHS leadership who 
described to me the new method they 
have laid out so you can apply for asy-
lum, come to the United States and 
come to any airport in the country. So 
you wouldn’t have to come through the 
southern border; you would just come 
in. But it would be the same process as 
what is happening on the southern bor-
der where people from 150 countries 
just this year have crossed our border. 
They have been checked in by Border 
Patrol, who know full well they are not 
legally present here. Then they are re-
leased into the country and given 8 
years until their hearing—8 years. 
Instead of responding to be able to 
slow down the more than 2 million peo-
ple who have illegally crossed in just 
the last year, this administration is ac-
tually working to say it is actually not 
enough people. They are increasing the 
access points to increase the number of 
people rather than decrease. 
The administration was proud to be 
able to say in May and in June that the 
numbers went down slightly from what 
they were in the previous months. The 
problem with that is, the previous 
month was a record, and so was the 
month before that. If you look at just 
the June number that, yes, was slight-
ly down from May, it is still the high-
est June ever recorded by the adminis-
tration. 
We are being overwhelmed with the 
number of people coming in illegally 
across our border. The administration 
is currently releasing people, and their 
sole focus seems to be on making ille-
gal immigration more efficient rather 
than more enforced. 
What grade would you give DHS? A 
more specific question: Mr. President, 
do you want to stop illegal immigra-
tion? Because I don’t think you do. And 
I think it is clear that the policies you 
put in place are directly leading to this 
record influx of illegal immigration 
from all over the world. 
I wish you could even say: Well, at 
least we vetted them, but I know that 
is not true, and so do you. Not a single 
one of these people entering the coun-
try has their criminal background 
check from the country they are from. 
We are doing a quick fingerprint anal-
ysis to see if they have committed a 
crime here, but we have no idea of the 
150 countries-plus that they are coming 
from because right now the goal is not 
to check their criminal history; it is to 
get them released in the country with-
in 8 hours. Keep it moving. Keep it 
moving. You don’t want to have a clog 
up at the border. When they cross the 
border, the goal is to just keep them 
moving into the country. 
Last weekend, I spent the weekend 
again at our southern border. Serving 
on the Homeland Security Committee, 
I spend a lot of time back and forth 
across that border to be able to evalu-
ate what is happening now because it 
changes from week to week. 
I was in the Rio Grande Valley last 
weekend spending time with CBP, the 
Border Patrol, individuals from Air and 
Marine Operations, from the Depart-
ment of DPS in Texas, from the Na-
tional Guard. All of them expressed in-
credible frustration. 
When I got there last Thursday night 
late, we went on a midnight patrol 
with Border Patrol. Literally within 
minutes, we ran through our first 
group of folks coming across the bor-
der, a group of teenagers. Minutes 
later, literally while that group was 
being processed, another group was 
interdicted coming across the border 
not far away. This time it was 6- and 7- 
year-old children and a couple of fami-
lies. While we watched them being 
processed, they called us on the radio 
and said that about 2 miles down, they 
just picked up another group. This 
time, it was adults, including one preg-
nant lady who was deep into her eighth 
month coming across the border to 
make sure she delivered here in the 
United States. 
One hundred fifty-plus countries just 
this year are crossing the border be-
cause it is open. 
I hear the Secretary of DHS say they 
have secured the border. As I just came 
from the border, I wonder when the 
President of the United States is going 
to actually go to the border to be able 
to see what is actually happening on 
the border and the policies they put in 
place, because so far the President has 
been able to make it to Saudi Arabia 
but has not been able to make it to our 
own southern border to even look once 
at what is happening on our southern 
border. 
If he goes—someday, I hope—I hope 
he meets with Border Patrol because 
the Border Patrol agents I talk to tell 
me about a time when the border was 
secure. They tell me about a time not 
long ago that we added forcible borders 
and where the policy wasn’t to release 
within hours and the enforcement pri-
ority wasn’t to get them moving as 
fast as possible; it was to actually se-
cure the border. 
You could meet with the landowners, 
like I did last weekend, who live in 
that area. Some of them have lived 
there for generations, and they are ab-
solutely furious because although they 
have lived there—and their family—for 
generations, they have never ever expe-
rienced this. 
They tell me about how, when they 
were children, they used to play in this 
area, and now literally they will not 
walk out their own door without a fire-
arm on their hip. They told me about 
multiple vehicles being stolen from 
their property, windows being smashed 
at all hours of the day and night, and 
people walking up to their windows and 
peering inside. 
One rancher told me about his wife, 
who is pregnant, and his child, who is 
2—how they literally fear for their 
lives every day because of the number 
of people who are coming across their 
property and for him personally, the 
number of dead bodies that they found 
on their property just this year. This 
wasn’t happening before. 
They had a very simple request. 
Their simple request was: I am an 
American. Why does my property not 
count? Why do my rights not count? 
The only rights that seem to count 
are people who are illegally crossing 
the border. Their rights seem to count, 
but the rights of Americans do not. 
Mr. President, would you be willing 
to answer his question? Would you be 
willing to talk to his wife and explain 
to her why there are bodies on their 
ranch and people are peering in their 
windows at all hours and they can’t 
live in safety on their own ranch? That 
was different just 3 years ago. Would 
you be willing to explain to them what 
has changed in your policies, because 
the goal of this administration seems 
to be efficient movement of illegal im-
migration, not stopping illegal immi-
gration. 
I met this Monday with leadership 
from the Oklahoma Bureau of Nar-
cotics, who explained to me about the

overwhelming amount of methamphet-
amine that is coming into my State 
and the number of people who are 
dying in my State because much of the 
meth is laced with fentanyl, and it is 
killing people in my State. 
I asked them if the meth is being 
cooked in Oklahoma, as it used to be, 
and they said: No, we hardly ever find 
a lab making meth anymore. It is all 
coming from Mexico—all of it. 
Mexican cartels are actively working 
in my State to distribute methamphet-
amine, partnering with Chinese groups 
who are doing not only the supplies but 
the distribution network in my State. 
When I was in the Rio Grande Valley 
this weekend, individuals with Cus-
toms and Border Protection showed me 
the numbers. Just this year, just in the 
Rio Grande Valley, 144 pounds of 
fentanyl has come in and 27,550 pounds 
of meth that they have interdicted just 
in the Rio Grande Valley just this 
year. Let me run that past you again: 
27,550 pounds just in that one area, just 
this year. 
Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics has 
explained to me that if you go back to 
2020, we didn’t have the drugs moving 
this way because the border was not 
open at that time. Now the drugs are 
flooding into our State because the 
border is open. 
What grade would you give the De-
partment of Homeland Security when 
they are allowing our country to be 
flooded with drugs, when they are 
choosing to make illegal immigration 
more efficient rather than stopping il-
legal immigration? What grade would 
you give them? 
When is this going to change? 
I have to tell you, I believe one of the 
main roles of the Department of Home-
land Security is to be able to shut 
down transnational criminal organiza-
tions 
from 
functioning 
inside 
my 
State, but instead, just in the Rio 
Grande Valley, when I talked to them 
this week, just in that one sector, they 
estimate that the cartels make $153 
million a week—$153 million a week 
just in that area of the Rio Grande Val-
ley, moving people across the border il-
legally, because each of them has to 
pay the cartels. In fact, we saw the 
wristbands that they all wear. Once 
they pay the cartels, they are marked 
that they can actually be moved across 
the border; they paid their amount. 
That is $153 million a week the Biden 
administration is facilitating in pay-
ment to transnational criminal organi-
zations just moving people, based on a 
liberal policy of ‘‘We are going to open 
the border up to be nice.’’ That policy 
is facilitating the cartels in Mexico 
being enriched. They make more a 
week—a week—in moving people than 
is the budget for Border Patrol in a 
year in that area. That is all being fa-
cilitated based on this administration 
making it easier to cross the border 
and more efficient to cross the border 
than stopping it. 
I am tired of hearing about the num-
ber of people who illegally cross the 
border. And many in this body just ig-
nore it. I am tired of hearing from the 
FBI in my State that the price of 
methamphetamine is going down in my 
State. It seems like the price of gaso-
line has soared, the price of food has 
soared, the price of housing has soared, 
but the price of meth is going down. 
Why would that be? Because the supply 
of meth is going up because it is com-
ing from the cartels in Mexico, and this 
administration is just looking the 
other way. 
When is this administration going to 
talk to the landowners in South Texas 
like I did and hear from them the 
threats that they face? They are Amer-
ican citizens. When does their life mat-
ter? 
It is time we address this issue. It is 
time we actually step up and say that 
DHS is failing in its most basic task of 
securing the Nation. 
It is time we stopped the illegal 
drugs coming into our country and 
killing our kids. It is time. And I am 
going to continue to come to this floor 
and to show what the media will not 
show anymore. They have looked away, 
and my Democratic colleagues have 
done the same. They just look away 
like it doesn’t exist, while 2 million 
people illegally cross the border. 
One more stat: Right now, we have 
somewhere between 4,500 and 8,000 peo-
ple a day illegally crossing the border— 
between 4,500 and 8,000 a day illegally 
crossing the border. May I remind you, 
President Biden, years ago, called it a 
humanitarian crisis when 2,000 people a 
day crossed the border. Now we have 
between 4,500 and 8,000 a day, day after 
day after day. 
This administration is not only open-
ing up the borders, they have also 
changed the enforcement priorities 
here in the United States. So we have 
round numbers—6,000 people a day ille-
gally entering the country. The Biden 
administration has changed the role 
for ICE in deportations. We are cur-
rently allowing 6,000 people a day to 
cross the border, but we are only de-
porting 161 people a day from the coun-
try. 
Six thousand a day, every day, day 
after day after day, illegally coming 
into the country; 161 people now that 
we are deporting a day. What would be 
your grade for DHS in their task of se-
curing the country? 
I know what mine is. It is time this 
body actually does something rather 
than just look away. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
BUDGET RESOLUTION 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor this evening—I have 
been talking about this subject for 
nearly the 31⁄2 years I have been a Sen-
ator. And I will tell you why I think it 
is important. 
We have grown the Federal Govern-
ment to a level where all the people 
who look to it, where they are depend-
ent upon it, try to work with it, need 
to know honestly where this all ends 
up if we do not change the trajectory. 
I think the easiest way to understand 
how we have gotten to where we are 
now is to look to what we used to do in 
the past. 
The country was never founded upon 
the principles that you borrow money 
to consume it. Any household, any 
local or State government knows you 
can’t be successful doing that. 
Money should only be borrowed if 
you are going to invest it or get a tan-
gible return on it; even maybe an in-
tangible one, when you look at invest-
ing in education or something like 
that. 
But there has been no system that 
has ever worked that ends up bor-
rowing money from the future, from its 
kids and grandkids, to where that is a 
good business plan. You get imme-
diately derailed in the real world. 
Imagine in a household, if you take in 
money and you spend 20 percent more 
than whatever that is, you will go to a 
financial counselor. They may get you 
out of trouble. You keep doing it, you 
end up in bankruptcy court. 
Businesses have the rigor of competi-
tion in addition to earning revenues, 
balancing their own budgets, and being 
able to invest into the future. 
If you follow principles that work ev-
erywhere else, it can work here, too, 
and we owe it to the American public. 
Like I said earlier, so many look to 
this place to be their partner in some 
fashion, and it ought to be one that is 
going to be there in the future. 
Let’s look where we have come. 
From the founding of the country, we 
raise revenues, generally, on the basis 
of need. You would go into debt; you 
would pay it off. 
If you look at 1920, World War I—it is 
way over here—you borrowed money, 
defend the country, save others, and 
you paid it off. 
Look what happened during 
the 
Great Depression, World War II. That 
is the deepest we have ever been in 
debt until we just eclipsed it recently. 
That is generally measured by how 
much debt you have as a percentage of 
your GDP—Great Depression; World 
War II. 
Look where we went after that. 
We were savers. We were investors 
then. We weren’t consumers and spend-
ers by nature, and we especially didn’t 
do it through the Federal Government. 
We kept our debt in check. Even 
through the great recession, which oc-
curred 2008, 2009, you were starting to 
see problems crop up. That happened 
when we put two wars on a credit card. 
Like the other side of the aisle said: 
Well, if you are going to do that, there 
are a lot of needs in our own country, 
and 
certainly 
there 
are, 
from 
healthcare, education, across the spec-
trum—Social Security, Medicare. 
Look what has happened since then. 
We have gone from being in relatively 
good shape pre-Gulf war, Afghanistan. 
We borrowed that money and then ran 
into the great recession and spent what

July 20, 2022 
seems like very little compared to how 
significant that was—$800 to $900 bil-
lion. 
And from that time to the present, I 
think we just said: We are borrowing 
money, and we might as well do more. 
And then you start doing it for things 
that don’t make sense. 
I got here 31⁄2 years ago, 18 trillion in 
debt. We were just approaching the per-
centage coming out of World War II. 
Here. We have now passed that and 
doubling down and going way beyond 
that. 
We are now, here, after the pandemic, 
where we spent close to $4 trillion in 
2020—a lot of it out of uncertainty. We 
didn’t know much about it. We should 
have treated that with respect. We now 
know a lot about it, and we probably 
didn’t need to shut the economy down, 
which cost us a lot, but we are through 
it. We certainly shouldn’t have doubled 
down and spent another 3 trillion in 
2021. 
I am not going to go over—you hear 
it on the news, you see it. We have got 
inflation embedded in the economy 
currently. The last time this occurred, 
back in the late seventies and the early 
eighties, when inflation peaked around 
10 or 11 percent, it took 5 years to get 
it back to 2 percent, where we were 
pre-COVID. We can expect probably 
something similar. We don’t know. 
The big difference between now and 
then is we have got a lot more debt, es-
pecially in government, so it is going 
to be trickier. 
So how do we get out of it? 
Well, unless we turn the tide, unless 
we start doing things differently, Medi-
care, which isn’t even being addressed 
here, has completely depleted its trust 
fund in about 41⁄2 or 5 years—automatic 
benefit cuts when that occurs. 
Social Security, which has been 
around since the Depression paying 
into it, that is depleted in about 10 
years. 
Those are two large trust funds that 
will have no balance in them, and then 
you would have to borrow even more 
money to pay the benefits. 
Let’s show a comparison of where we 
stack up now with other major econo-
mies. 
Look at that. We have known for a 
long time Japan, which is the third 
largest economy, has struggled to fig-
ure out how it is going to grow, how it 
is going to do for future generations 
what it has done since World War II. It 
has taken debt to where it is a stran-
glehold on its economy. Its debt is 237 
percent of its GDP. 
Now look who is in second place, and 
this isn’t something you want to be in 
second place on—United States. Our 
debt currently is 107 percent of our 
GDP. 
India, Germany, China—China, our 
main geopolitical competitor, under 
half of the sovereign debt as a percent-
age of its GDP. That is not a good 
place to be. They are our geopolitical 
competitor, and I sense they know that 
you need to be savers and investors if 
you are going to be successful in the 
future, if you are going to give your 
people what they are going to need out 
of a government. 
Financially, we are going to be up 
against them, and they, to me, look 
like they are doing a lot of things that 
someday pivot to where we are caught 
by surprise, and then you don’t have 
the options. We start increasing to be 
more indebted than what we are, it will 
be even harder to compete with some-
body like them. 
We now have a 9.1-percent inflation 
rate. That is a pay cut for everyone. 
We now know, I think, what caused it. 
We need to just quit digging the hole 
deeper. Let’s get out of it. Let’s go 
back to what we know was working, at 
least financially, pre-COVID. We had 
no inflation, nominal that is built into 
what 
is 
considered 
zero 
inflation, 
wages rising in the toughest places, 
and a growth rate that was better than 
what we had before, close to 3 percent. 
We 
need 
to 
start 
spending 
less 
through government, return the pro-
ductive capacity back to the private 
sector, and then look at—once we get 
the ship righted here—what we do bet-
ter policywise. I am a believer. We need 
to fix healthcare; it is a broken system. 
It drives our structural deficits more 
than anything. Medicare each year— 
like Warren Buffett says, healthcare in 
general is a tapeworm on the economy. 
What I want to do is face reality. Re-
gardless of the tax rate, over 50 years, 
we average about 171⁄2 percent of our 
GDP in Federal Government revenues. 
If that is all you can get, regardless if 
you have high tax rates that gives you 
a lower economic growth or lower tax 
rates that maybe gives you a percent 
or more in economic growth, we need 
to acknowledge it. 
My plan does two simple things: ac-
knowledges what our revenue has been 
over 50 years—171⁄2
percent of our 
GDP—tapers what we spend into it, 
takes what we have done here as a ma-
neuver to escape budgeting and appro-
priating by putting spending on man-
datory versus discretionary, which is 
nothing other than saying: I don’t want 
to budget. I don’t want to allocate re-
sources. We are just going to do more 
each year. 
If we keep doing it, we are not going 
to be able to fund the programs that we 
all consider important. 
So it acknowledges a reasonable rev-
enue level. It moves 375 billion that 
used to be discretionary that is now 
mandatory back to discretionary. And 
then it is going to be up to all of us, as 
stewards of the Federal Government, 
to see how we are going to make the 
right decisions to take that amount 
and get it down to where we cut it out 
of the budget. 
That would put us, in 10 years, in pri-
mary balance, meaning that the only 
thing that contributes to our deficit is 
our interest. It would clearly show, 
too, how the big drivers of our current 
deficit—Medicare, 
Social 
Security, 
Medicaid, other mandatory spending 
features—are driving it. 
And, yes, if we want to get to a real 
balanced budget that covers your inter-
est, you would have to actually find 
ways to do the same things with less 
money. 
Defense is always a topic on my side 
of the aisle. This spends on defense—ar-
guably the most important thing we 
need to do as a Federal Government. I 
think there is a lot of bipartisan inter-
est in defending our country and fi-
nancing it accordingly. This spends on 
defense above the CBO line and gets its 
numbers from the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee, plugs it in. 
It is going to be more robust there 
than what the CBO has by a little bit 
because I am a believer that what has 
driven this issue over the long run is 
what I call the unholy alliance. Folks 
on my side, whatever it takes, will 
spend it on defense. I said it is the 
most important thing we do. Medicare, 
Social Security, Medicaid—those are 
important too. They are going broke 
over time. So we need to work on all of 
that to rein it in. But defense, the most 
important thing, is going to be at a 
level that keeps us secure. 
If we don’t exercise fiscal restraint, if 
we don’t make the tough decisions that 
everybody does in running their own 
budgets, whether it is in a business, a 
local or State government or even a 
household, it is going to be a hard land-
ing someday that none of us will like. 
A lot of what is about running any-
thing successfully is having a good 
plan. I don’t think our plan makes 
sense for the future. 
But the other component—and I will 
never forget the first budget meeting I 
was in here. One of the Senators said: 
Mike, the reason this keeps coming 
back and back is we do not have polit-
ical will. 
And whether it is political will that 
you need to make things work here, 
whether it is determination, whatever 
you want to call it—it is the market-
place when you run a business, it is a 
balanced budget amendment in statute 
when you have got a State govern-
ment—there has got to be more dis-
cipline. 
Let’s put that last chart up here. 
And I want to re-emphasize, because 
I got some on my side that think we 
are not being robust enough on defense. 
We just looked at that chart where it is 
the most robust. But I want to go back 
to this one again. This one says it all. 
Look at where we have come from 
where the ‘‘greatest generation’’ left 
us. Remember, they paid off the debt 
from World War II and built the Inter-
state Highway System—to where we 
are now in literally 40 years. 
That is shameful. 
All I am saying is, my budget makes 
it to where we have got 10 years. We 
don’t even have to cover the interest, 
but we need to bring it back into what 
is called primary balance. 
I would hope we have some friends on 
the other side of the aisle that see that 
this makes sense, because we will need 
it for their priorities. All I can tell you

CHIPS ACT OF 2022 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as I 
announced earlier today, in a few mo-
ments, I will file cloture on a major 
piece of legislation that will help our 
country lower costs, increase American 
manufacturing, 
strengthen 
supply 
chains, and preserve American com-
petitiveness on into the 21st century. It 
is a very significant piece of legisla-
tion, and it will ensure that America 
and the American economy remain No. 
1 on into the 21st century. 
Specifically, our chips-plus package 
will now include incentives for domes-
tic 
microchip 
projection, 
including 
ITC; support for our wireless commu-
nication supply chain—ORAN—and bil-
lions dedicated to scientific research, 
which includes many of the provisions 
Senator YOUNG and I authored in the 
Endless Frontier Act in partnership 2 
years ago. 
By filing cloture tonight, we are 
keeping this bill on track for final pas-
sage very soon. There has been strong 
bipartisan support already behind this 
legislation so I hope we can come to an 
agreement to get it done as quickly as 
it can because it is so important for 
the future of the country. 
Mr. President, what is the pending 
business?

CONDEMNING THE USE OF HUN-

RECOGNIZING THE EFFECT OF 
CONFLICT ON GLOBAL FOOD SE-
CURITY AND FAMINE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 434, S. Res. 669. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 669) condemning the 
use of hunger as a weapon of war and recog-
nizing the effect of conflict on global food se-
curity and famine. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution, 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, with an 
amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part 
printed in italic and with an amend-
ment to strike the preamble and insert 
the part printed in italic, as follows: 
Whereas, in 2020, an estimated 155,000,000 peo-
ple experienced crisis levels of food insecurity 
(Integrated Food Security Phase Classification 
phase 3 or above), with nearly 100,000,000 people 
living in environments where conflict was the 
main driver of hunger, and the COVID–19 pan-
demic has exacerbated rising levels of global 
food insecurity; 
Whereas conflict acutely impacts vulnerable 
populations such as women and children, per-
sons with disabilities, refugees, and internally 
displaced persons; 
Whereas the impacts of conflict on food secu-
rity can be direct, such as displacement from 
land, destruction of livestock grazing areas and 
fishing grounds, or destruction of food stocks 
and agricultural assets, or indirect, such as dis-
ruptions to food systems, leading to increased 
food prices or decreased household purchasing 
power, or decreased access to supplies that are 
necessary for food production and preparation, 
including agricultural inputs, water, and fuel; 
Whereas conflict disrupts the distribution and 
buying and selling of food within a food system, 
including by creating shortages in production, 
increasing real and perceived risks for travel 
and transport, enabling the formation of illegal 
distribution channels and markets, and contrib-
uting to the breakdown of a government’s abil-
ity to enforce regulations or perform its judici-
ary functions; 
Whereas aerial bombing campaigns targeting 
agricultural heartlands, and the use of scorched 
earth methods of warfare, landmines, and other 
explosive devices have direct impacts on the 
ability of vulnerable populations to feed them-
selves; 
Whereas effective humanitarian response in 
conflict, including in response to the threat of 
conflict-induced famine and food insecurity, re-
quires respect for international humanitarian 
law by all parties to such conflict, and allowing 
and facilitating the rapid and unimpeded move-
ment of humanitarian relief to all those in need; 
Whereas efforts to restrict humanitarian aid 
and the operational integrity and impartiality 
of humanitarian aid works and distribution ef-
forts, including through the imposition of block-
ades, security impediments, or irregular bureau-
cratic requirements, are another means by 
which combatants employ starvation and food 
deprivation as a weapon of war; and 
Whereas the United States Government has 
multiple tools to fight global hunger, protect 
lifesaving assistance, and promote the preven-
tion of conflict, including through the Global 
Fragility Act of 2019 (title V of division J of 
Public Law 116–94), the Global Food Security 
Act of 2016 (Public Law 114–195), and the Agri-
culture Improvement Act of 2018 (Public Law 
115–334), and has the potential to hold account-
able those using hunger as a weapon of war 
through the Global Magnitsky Human Rights 
Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of 
Public Law 114–328): Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, 
That the Senate— 
SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE. 
The Senate— 
(1) condemns the use of hunger as a weapon 
of war through the— 
(A) starvation of civilians; 
(B) intentional and reckless destruction, re-
moval, looting, or rendering useless objects nec-
essary for food production and distribution, 
such as farmland, markets, mills, food proc-
essing and storage facilities, foodstuffs, crops, 
livestock, agricultural assets, waterways, water 
systems, drinking water facilities and supplies, 
and irrigation networks; 
(C) denial of humanitarian access and the 
deprivation of objects indispensable to people’s 
survival, such as food supplies and nutrition re-
sources; and 
(D) willful interruption of market systems for 
populations in need, including through the pre-
vention of travel and manipulation of currency 
exchange; and 
(2) calls on the United States Government to— 
(A) prioritize diplomatic efforts to call out and 
address instances where hunger and intentional 
deprivation of food is being utilized as a weapon 
of war, including through efforts to ensure that 
security operations minimize civilian harm and 
do not undermine livelihoods of civilian popu-
lations; 
(B) continue efforts to address severe global 
food insecurity through effective humanitarian 
response efforts, including through the provi-
sion of United States in-kind food assistance, 
vouchers, and other flexible food aid modalities; 
(C) ensure existing interagency strategies, cri-
sis response efforts, and ongoing programs con-
sider, integrate, and adapt to conflict situations, 
including by utilizing crisis modifiers in United 
States Agency for International Development 
programming to respond to rapid shocks and 
stress such as the willful targeting of food sys-
tems; and 
(D) ensure that the use of hunger as a weapon 
of war is considered within the employment of 
tools to hold individuals, governments, militias, 
or entities responsible, such as the Global 
Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act 
(22 U.S.C. 2656), where appropriate, and taking 
into consideration the need for humanitarian 
exemptions and the protection of lifesaving as-
sistance.

can arise nearly anywhere in the body; 
Whereas, in the United States— 
(1) about 16,000 individuals are diagnosed

CHIPS ACT 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
come to the Senate floor today to cor-
rect the record, really. Some of my col-
leagues in the Chamber voted yester-
day to begin consideration of this chips 
package that we have talked about a 
lot because they believed it included 
legislation called Safeguarding Amer-
ican Innovation Act, or SAIA, the bi-
partisan, Senate-passed, White-House 
supported, essential legislation to pro-
tect taxpayer-funded research and in-
tellectual property from being taken, 
stolen, by China and other adversaries 
and then used against us. 
It is understandable people thought 
that because the SAIA research secu-
rity provisions were in the broader 
USICA bill that passed the Senate last 
year. In fact, as the coauthors of 
USICA know, it was the reason I was 
one of the then-original Republican co-
sponsors of USICA and only because of 
that. At that time, we needed Repub-
lican cosponsors. And it is understand-
able because, this week, all Republican 
offices were emailed a list of items by 
the lead Republican on this bill which 
included chips-plus legislation, includ-
ing SAIA. 
So Republicans, when they voted yes-
terday, thought SAIA was part of it. 
Even today, Democrats and Repub-
licans alike have come up to me and 
said they thought SAIA was in this 
bill. 
By the way, they want it in this bill, 
but it is not. It was stripped out of this 
USICA. I filed an amendment to get it 
back into this package because it is so 
crucial to the goal of the overall effort, 
which is, of course, to improve our 
country’s competitiveness, especially 
with regard to China. To do that, we 
must not only invest in more American 
research and innovation, which I sup-
port, but we have to protect that tax-
payer-funded research and intellectual 
property from being stolen by our ad-
versaries and used against us. 
Given the current realities, without 
such protections, I believe this chips- 
plus bill, with significantly increased 
levels of Federal funding for research, 
may well become a giveaway to Bei-
jing. 
China’s made no secret of its goal to 
supplant the United States as the glob-
al economic leader, and China has been 
willing to use every tool at its disposal 
to be able to do that. As FBI Director 
Christopher Wray has warned: 
The greatest long-term threat to our na-
tion’s information and intellectual property, 
and to our economic vitality, is the counter-
intelligence and economic espionage threat 
from China.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3530 
July 20, 2022 
Director 
Wray 
has 
characterized 
China as the largest threat to our 
ideas, our innovation, and our eco-
nomic security, noting that the FBI 
has opened 2,000 cases focused on China 
stealing our research, with one case 
being opened approximately every 12 
hours. 
A number of us, in a totally bipar-
tisan process, have been working on 
protecting research for the past 4 
years. In 2019, an investigative report 
of the Permanent Subcommittee on In-
vestigations 
of 
the 
Committee 
on 
Homeland Security, which I chaired 
with Senator CARPER as the ranking 
member, documented, after a yearlong 
investigation, how China uses talent 
recruitment programs—like the Thou-
sand 
Talents 
Plan—to 
target 
the 
science and technology sectors. Talent 
recruitment plans recruit high-quality 
overseas talent—primarily from the 
United 
States—including 
academics, 
scientists, 
engineers, 
entrepreneurs, 
even finance experts. The plans provide 
monetary benefits and other incentives 
to lure experts into providing propri-
etary information or research to China. 
This is in violation of our laws and 
conflict of interest rules. China, in 
turn, exploits American research, in-
tellectual property, and open collabo-
ration—often U.S. taxpayer-funded— 
for its own economic and military gain 
at our expense. 
Really, when you think about it, the 
rise in China’s military and economy 
over the past couple decades is, in part, 
being fueled by American taxpayer- 
paid research, where they have essen-
tially leapfrogged us and commer-
cialized it more quickly than us and 
used it against us. 
In just one of many examples, re-
cently, a researcher in Kansas hid his 
full-time employment with a Chinese 
research university to obtain Federal 
grant funding for six different Depart-
ment of Energy and National Science 
Foundation contracts. 
Remember, the funding in this bill 
primarily goes to the National Science 
Foundation. In fact, the Department of 
Health and Human Services inspector 
general recently released a report that 
found that two-thirds of the NIH grant 
recipients—another place a lot of re-
search is done, NIH—failed to meet 
Federal requirements regarding foreign 
financial interests including instances 
of U.S.-funded researchers failing to 
disclose ties with the Chinese Govern-
ment. 
In fact, since our investigation and 
hearing, there have been at least 23 dif-
ferent researchers that have been ar-
rested by Federal authorities for re-
search theft. In testimony before the 
Permanent Subcommittee on Inves-
tigations, John Brown, then-assistant 
director of the FBI’s Counterintel-
ligence Division said: 
The Communist government of China has 
proven that it will use any means necessary 
to advance its interests at the expense of 
others, including the United States, and pur-
sue its long-term goal of being the world’s 
superpower by 2049. . . . The Chinese govern-
ment knows that economic strength and sci-
entific innovation are the keys to global in-
fluence and military power. So Beijing aims 
to acquire our . . . expertise, to erode our 
competitive advantage and supplant the 
United States as a global superpower. 
Then-commander, U.S. Cyber Com-
mand, General Keith Alexander de-
scribed intellectual property theft and 
cyber espionage in general as ‘‘the 
greatest transfer of wealth in history.’’ 
The sentiment was underscored by 
former national security adviser, re-
tired LTG H.R. McMaster. When asked 
about China’s growing and intertwined 
military and economic threat at a 
March 2021 Armed Services Committee 
hearing, Lieutenant General McMaster 
stressed the need for the United States 
to defend itself saying: 
It’s gut-wrenching to see how much has 
been stolen right from under our noses. And 
much of that research [is] funded by Con-
gress. . . . I think the financial dimension of 
this is something worth a great deal of scru-
tiny. We are, in large measure, underwriting 
our own demise. 
That is why Senator CARPER and I in-
troduced the Safeguarding American 
Innovation Act and insisted it be in-
cluded in the Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs title of USICA. 
And, again, it was, and it passed. And 
it is part of the research funding—addi-
tional research funding to have these 
protections around it. It would be nec-
essary even if there was not additional 
research funding, but now we are 
spending tens of billions of dollars of 
more taxpayer money and not pro-
viding this security. 
Based on feedback from the law en-
forcement and research community, 
the legislation goes directly to the root 
of the problem. It makes it punishable 
by law to knowingly fail to disclose 
foreign funding on Federal grant appli-
cations. 
The FBI wants that badly. It requires 
the executive branch to streamline and 
coordinate grant-making between the 
Federal Agencies so there is con-
tinuity, accountability, and coordina-
tion. It allows the State Department to 
deny visas to foreign researchers com-
ing to the United States to exploit the 
openness of our research enterprise and 
requires research institutions and uni-
versities to do more, including telling 
the State Department whether a for-
eign researcher will have access to ex-
port-controlled technologies. 
The State Department wants this 
badly. The career people at the State 
Department helped us write these pro-
visions. They need this authority. They 
don’t have it now. 
So a vital component of any competi-
tiveness bill must be this common-
sense, 
noncontroversial, 
extensively 
negotiated, bipartisan bill. It is a mat-
ter of our national security. I have de-
scribed the extraordinary theft of tax-
payer-paid 
research 
under 
current 
funding levels. Again, it is unthinkable 
that we would add tens of billions of 
more taxpayer dollars to sensitive re-
search, as we propose, in the CHIPS- 
plus package and not protect that re-
search from China and other adver-
saries. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to sup-
port this amendment to ensure that it 
is part again—as it has been in the 
past; we all voted for it—of the under-
lying package. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
f 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, on 
July 4, we celebrated the founding of 
our Nation, as we do every year. But 
when I woke up on this July 4, I had a 
strange thought, a thought I never had 
before, the question of, What kind of 
country are we celebrating? 
I have always had immense pride in 
the founding vision of our Nation, in 
that vision of equality, of opportunity 
for all, of freedom of religion, of equal 
justice under the law, of equal rep-
resentation, and, most importantly, of 
government of, by, and for the people. 
Our journey as a nation over nearly 
250 years has been a difficult journey of 
moving toward full implementation of 
this vision. That is an inspiring jour-
ney—a journey I have been proud to 
witness, a journey I have been proud to 
be a part of. 
But just days before this year’s July 
4 celebration, we saw the conclusion of 
the Supreme Court’s latest judicial 
term—a term over which the Court dis-
played a far different vision for Amer-
ica: one with devastating repercussions 
that will reverberate in the lives of 
countless Americans for decades to 
come. 
For years now—actually, for decades, 
we have watched a steady, relentless 
effort by rightwing extremists to rig 
the courts so they can transform 
America and American society as we 
have known it. Their big goal is cor-
porations over people and their second 
goal is to implement conservative cul-
tural policy over individual freedom 
and liberty. 
Now, with this Court’s recent deci-
sions, we are left with an inescapable 
conclusion: The extremists have suc-
ceeded. The Court is now operating as 
an unelected super-legislature with a 
MAGA political agenda. Their deci-
sions this term read like planks out of 
the Republican Party platform. 
Here is what the MAGA Court’s vi-
sion is for our Nation. It is a vision 
that obliterates the right to privacy, 
giving an overbearing Federal Govern-
ment the power to be in the medical 
exam 
room 
making 
reproductive 
health decisions for American women, 
when the only people who should be in 
the exam room, under an ‘‘of and by 
the people’’ Republic is the woman, her 
doctor, and whomever else she chooses 
to invite—her partner, her friend, or 
her religious adviser. 
This Court’s vision is a vision that 
embraces never-ending gun violence, 
stripping Congress and the States of

the ability to make commonsense gun 
safety laws. 
It is a vision of a nation where public 
schools can impose religion on their 
students. So much for freedom of reli-
gion and separation of church and 
State. 
It is a vision of a nation where 
wrongfully 
incarcerated 
Americans 
don’t have the right to prove their in-
nocence and can’t find justice if their 
Miranda rights were violated. So much 
for the principle of equal justice under 
law, the very principle carved into 
stone above the doors of the Supreme 
Court. In fact, if you go out this door 
and out the front steps, you can see 
those words while standing here on the 
steps of the Senate. 
This Court’s vision is of a nation 
where the Court strips the Federal 
Government of its legally enacted 
power to regulate fossil carbon and fos-
sil methane pollution that is destroy-
ing our Nation and our planet. 
It is a vision where the powerful cor-
rupt the integrity of our elections with 
gerrymandering and dark money and 
measures to prevent targeted groups of 
Americans from voting. 
This vision is a vision for a govern-
ment by and for the powerful, not by 
and for the people. 
This vision in which the Supreme 
Court becomes a superlegislature for a 
MAGA agenda infuriates me. It infuri-
ates me because I believe in govern-
ment by and for the people, not by and 
for the powerful. It infuriates me be-
cause I know the pain that these deci-
sions will inflict on millions of Ameri-
cans—the pain of a woman forced by a 
State government to carry a fetus to 
term that was conceived through rape 
or incest or the pain of any woman, for 
that matter, who simply is unprepared 
to be pregnant or become a parent; the 
pain of every single person who will 
have to mourn the death of a loved one 
lost to an ever-growing epidemic of gun 
violence and mass shootings like we 
saw in Uvalde and in Highland Park 
and in countless other communities 
with more than one mass shooting per 
day; the pain of the citizens blocked 
from the ballot box, effectively denied 
their most fundamental right as Amer-
icans because of voter suppression 
schemes enacted in many States over 
this past year; the pain of students in 
our public schools pressured to partici-
pate in religious acts in conflict with 
their own beliefs; the pain of rural 
Americans, 
ranchers, 
and 
farmers 
whose farms and ranches will be lost to 
fire and drought because the Court 
says the Federal Government cannot 
regulate fossil carbon and fossil meth-
ane causing climate chaos. 
And I am infuriated because I know 
more Supreme Court decisions like 
these are coming from the six MAGA 
Justices on the Court. They want to ce-
ment their vision of America through 
superlegislative powers rather than 
calling the balls and strikes defending 
the Constitution, which is their job. 
They have announced that next term 
they are going to hear a case on the 
fringe doctrine known as the inde-
pendent State legislature doctrine. It 
has been considered an extremist idea, 
which says only State legislatures have 
the power to make decisions about 
Federal elections and how to appoint 
electors. State courts would have no 
power to ensure checks and balances or 
decide which decisions about elections 
violate a State constitution or ignore 
the will of the voters, nor could State 
Governors veto such legislative deci-
sions. And that is just the start. 
Justice Thomas himself said in his 
concurring opinion that, based on the 
reasoning in Dobbs, he wants the Court 
to consider a whole host of other rights 
that have been secured and protected 
by previous Courts, including the possi-
bility of striking down the right to in-
timacy and marriage for same-sex cou-
ples and the right to contraception. 
Make no mistake, this is not some 
sudden occurrence. It is exactly what 
the Federalist Society has been work-
ing toward for decades. 
Before joining the Court in 1972, 
Lewis Powell wrote about the need to 
rebuild the power of industrial elites 
and fight back ‘‘from the college cam-
pus, the pulpit, the media, the intellec-
tual and literary journals, the arts and 
sciences, and from politicians’’ against 
progressive changes in society. In out-
lining a plan for rebuilding the power 
of Big Business, he declared that, with 
an activist-minded Supreme Court, the 
judiciary may be the most important 
instrument for achieving that goal. 
That is exactly why, as majority 
leader in 2017, Senator MCCONNELL 
stole a Supreme Court seat from one 
President so another President could 
fill it. He stole it in 2016, and he filled 
it in 2017 with MAGA Justice Neil 
Gorsuch. It is why, in 2018, Leader 
MCCONNELL completely ignored cred-
ible accounts of sexual assault and 
rushed through a confirmation without 
giving Senators access to the nomi-
nee’s full records and bypassing com-
mittee quorum rules to fill another 
seat 
with 
MAGA 
Justice 
Brett 
Kavanaugh. And it is why, when a seat 
opened up in another election year, 
2020, just weeks before the voters would 
vote, Leader MCCONNELL
completely 
reversed his argument that he had used 
to justify the theft of a Supreme Court 
seat in 2016, and he rammed through 
the nomination of MAGA Justice Amy 
Coney Barrett. 
The Republican Party has won one 
popular vote for President in the last 
30 years but has appointed two-thirds 
of the sitting Justices, who now see it 
as their job to become a super-legisla-
ture for a cultural agenda and cor-
porate power. 
In one of his columns, Eugene Robin-
son of the Washington Post described 
the resulting unelected, unaccountable 
majority of Supreme Court Justices as 
a ‘‘junta’’—a word used to describe au-
thoritarian leaders who rule through 
edicts rather than through legislative 
determination or deliberation on con-
stitutional principles. It is hard to 
argue with Eugene Robinson’s charac-
terization. 
In spite of what the vast majority of 
Americans want—the protection of a 
woman’s right to full reproductive 
healthcare and more gun safety, not 
less, and free and fair elections—the 
Court’s MAGA majority has chosen to 
rule by Supreme Court edict to inflict 
their narrow preferences for society on 
hundreds of millions of Americans. 
And they are not just using the reg-
ular process for considering cases. Over 
the past 5 years, we have seen a monu-
mental shift in the Court’s use of emer-
gency orders—the so-called 
shadow 
docket—to enact sweeping decisions on 
the American people. These cases don’t 
get the full process we are familiar 
with—formal briefings, formal hear-
ings, lengthy deliberations, and opin-
ion writings—because it is argued that 
the applicant would suffer ‘‘irreparable 
harm’’ if their request were not imme-
diately granted. 
The shadow docket decisions, by the 
way, are usually unsigned and unex-
plained. In the past, they have essen-
tially involved death penalty cases— 
cases of literal life and death—of pret-
ty much extreme importance to the ap-
plicant because, if someone is executed 
before their case is heard, they do suf-
fer ‘‘irreparable harm’’—the standard. 
Then, about 5 years ago, we started 
to see a big shift in the emergency 
cases being taken up and in the sub-
stances of them as well. 
We have seen the shadow docket used 
to stop the Federal Government from 
implementing a vaccine and testing 
mandate on businesses to protect pub-
lic health in the middle of an unprece-
dented global health crisis that has 
killed more than a million Americans. 
We have seen it used to uphold a 
Texas law banning abortion after 6 
weeks. 
We have seen it used when a lower 
court blocked Alabama’s congressional 
map because it violated the Voting 
Rights Act by diluting the political 
power of Black voters. 
The Court said: You have got to draw 
a new map that is fair. 
The Supreme Court stepped in with 
their shadow docket and said: No. Ala-
bama can use this faulty map that di-
lutes the power of Black Americans. 
In this situation, the Court didn’t 
stop the infliction of harm; they in-
flicted the harm on Black Americans, 
who want fair maps, who deserve fair 
maps for voting in our democracy. 
That gerrymandered map is now in 
place to disenfranchise Black voters in 
this November’s election because of the 
Supreme Court’s use of the shadow 
docket. 
It is hard to see how any of these 
cases met the test for the shadow dock-
et. 
The state of abuse of the shadow 
docket has gotten so bad and so bla-
tant that even Justice Roberts, the 
Chief Justice of the Court, joined a dis-
sent in a case reinstating a Trump ad-
ministration Clean Water Act regula-
tion limiting Federal protections for 
streams and wetlands. This dissent

stated that the majority’s decision 
‘‘renders the court’s emergency dock-
et,’’ meaning the shadow docket, ‘‘not 
for emergencies at all . . . . The docket 
becomes only another place for merits 
determinations—except made without 
full briefing and argument.’’ When the 
Supreme Court’s Chief Justice says the 
shadow docket is being abused, you 
know it is true. 
This MAGA Court is so determined to 
impose their legislative priorities and 
values on our country that they have 
abandoned one of the core principles of 
American jurisprudence, going back to 
even before there was a United States 
of America, and that is that the Court 
only rules when there is an actual dis-
pute or controversy in question. 
In their eagerness to cripple the Fed-
eral Government’s ability to fight fos-
sil carbon pollution, the MAGA Jus-
tices weighed in on a regulation that 
had never been enforced—a regulation 
that had been withdrawn by President 
Trump and a regulation which Presi-
dent Biden had indicated was never 
going to be reinstated. Even the utili-
ties that would have been regulated 
didn’t want the Supreme Court to de-
cide this case. This out-of-control 
MAGA Supreme Court super-legisla-
ture wanted to legislate—and legislate 
they did—violating a core principle 
that the Court does not address moot 
cases. Moot cases are cases where there 
is nothing still in dispute, and this cer-
tainly was the case that this case was 
as dead or as moot as it could be be-
cause nobody could be impacted by a 
rule that doesn’t exist. 
Why did the Court take up this case? 
Well, we may not be able to specify 
the exact reasoning by each Justice, 
but the effect is clear. By taking up 
this case, the Court furthered the 
MAGA policy agenda. Their ruling 
handcuffed Federal authorities’ ability 
to pursue future limitations on pollu-
tions from fossil fuels like carbon diox-
ide and fossil methane. This is to the 
enormous benefit of the fossil fuel bil-
lionaires who funded the massive dark 
money campaigns that supported these 
Justices’ confirmations. That situation 
of their breaking precedent to benefit 
the fossil billionaires, who had just 
funded their confirmation campaigns, 
reeks of corruption. 
When generations ahead of us look 
back at this moment, I have no doubt— 
especially when they look at this year, 
2022, and what the Court did in a single 
year—they will look back with a sense 
of 
profound 
disbelief—disbelief—like 
that disbelief that we experience when 
we look back on cases like Dred Scott, 
which dehumanized Black Americans 
and legitimized slavery, or Plessy v. 
Ferguson, which locked in 60 years of 
vicious discrimination and racial ter-
rorism under a separate but equal phi-
losophy. 
The disbelief that future generations 
will have will be directed at Dobbs—a 
decision this year in which the Court 
obliterated privacy and put an over-
bearing government in charge of wom-
en’s reproductive health. 
They will have the disbelief that, in 
Kennedy v. Bremerton—decided this 
year—the Court destroyed freedom of 
religion in our public schools; the dis-
belief that, in West Virginia v. EPA—a 
decision this year—the Court violated 
centuries of precedent to rule on a reg-
ulation that is no longer on books, 
with the effect—perhaps the goal—of 
limiting the future regulation of green-
house gas pollution; the disbelief in 
New York State Rifle & Pistol Associa-
tion v. Bruen—decided this year—that 
the Court ruled that a State legislature 
can’t require folks to have a good rea-
son to carry a concealed weapon in 
public spaces. 
Let me be clear. This activist, ex-
tremist MAGA Court faces a legit-
imacy crisis, and a legitimacy crisis 
for the Court is a crisis for our demo-
cratic Republic. Part of that illegit-
imacy is Justices of the Supreme Court 
selectively using a doctrine of so-called 
originalism to justify their politically 
inspired decisions. The doctrine of 
originalism is based on a reasonable ar-
gument, one on which you and I would 
say makes sense: a goal of under-
standing what the Founders meant 
when they wrote what they wrote in 
our Constitution more than two cen-
turies ago. But if that effort is applied 
selectively, it simply becomes a meas-
ure to justify, after the fact, where the 
Justices want it to come out. They use 
it when it works, and they abandon it 
when it doesn’t. 
For example, the Founders wrote the 
Second Amendment to ensure that 
members of well-regulated militias had 
access to their rifles, but the so-called 
originalists 
on 
the 
Court 
cast 
originalism aside, declaring that the 
Founders wrote that clause to ensure 
that nonmilitia members had the right 
to bring assault rifles—that didn’t 
exist in 1787—onto subways, which 
didn’t exist in 1787. That is bogus 
originalism in its purist form. 
Consider this: Corporations, as we 
know them today, did not exist in 1787. 
Yet the so-called originalists on the 
Court insist that the Founders’ vision 
of the First Amendment, to protect 
freedom of speech, gives corporations 
speech rights even though the word 
‘‘corporation’’ doesn’t appear in the 
Constitution—a point that they use 
when they want to take an originalist 
argument: that the Founders had to 
have it be something written in the 
Constitution and be something they 
discussed and something they consid-
ered and something they envisioned. 
None of those are true. Not a one of 
them is true in this case. 
The MAGA Court also claims that a 
corporation is a person, which no 
Founder would ever have argued. They 
didn’t even know what a ‘‘corporation’’ 
was because they didn’t exist in this 
form that we have now. 
The MAGA Court goes on to claim 
that the members comprising the cor-
porate 
personhood—those 
are 
the 
stockholders of a corporation—have ab-
solutely no right to know how that cor-
poration that they are part of spends 
their money. This is absurdity stacked 
on the fallacy that a corporation is a 
person. 
I have yet to see and yet to hear any 
plausible explanation as to how the 
MAGA Justices can be confident that 
the Founders intended for billionaire 
CEOs to hijack the accumulated wealth 
of their stockholders without their 
stockholders’ knowledge or permission 
or opportunity to know what is being 
said and to use that money as speech 
and to spend it on secretly funded cam-
paigns, including campaigns to confirm 
Supreme Court Justices. 
The problem we face, colleagues, 
isn’t just a MAGA-majority Court en-
acting terrible policy rather than de-
fending the balls and strikes against 
the Constitution. The problem is great-
er if the highest Court in the land loses 
its legitimacy, the law itself loses its 
legitimacy. If the American people see 
the Supreme Court Justices making 
clear that the law has no meaning 
other than their political preferences, 
then the law is not the foundation for 
our society that it is supposed to be. 
We have seen with deadly results on 
January 6, 2021, the consequences to 
our policies, to our politics, and to our 
society when the rule of law is replaced 
by violence and power as the orga-
nizing principle for society. 
The Court is essential in a society 
based on the rule of law, and it is es-
sential to have a Court that honors the 
law rather than trying to write the 
law. 
This MAGA majority and its desire, 
and operation as a super-legislature— 
unelected, lifetime appointments—is a 
dire threat to our Republic. Here in 
Congress, we must not only shine a 
light—a spotlight—on the threat; we 
must stop the runaway MAGA Court 
from corrupting the rule of law and try 
to restore the legitimate role of the 
Court as a panel defending our Con-
stitution. 
Some will say there is no way to re-
store the Court and that any strategy 
for restoring the Court will simply 
compound the problems we are now 
facing, and I agree that there is no sim-
ple way to restore the legitimacy of 
the Court. 
Back in 2017, when then-Majority 
Leader MCCONNELL
was striving to 
complete the theft of the Supreme 
Court seat taken from the administra-
tion of Barack Obama, I took to this 
floor for 151⁄2 hours with one simple 
message: Don’t do it. Don’t do it be-
cause, if you do, you will damage the 
legitimacy of the Court and there will 
be no simple path, no easy remedy to 
restore the Court’s legitimacy. 
But Leader MCCONNELL, he doused 
the Supreme Court with gasoline on 
that day, and he set it on fire. He did 
the damage. I stood here for 151⁄2 hours 
and said don’t do it. 
You know, we take an oath of office 
to a Constitution. That involves de-
fending the Court, not delegitimizing 
the Court, not stealing Supreme Court

July 20, 2022 
seats. It was the first time in the his-
tory of the United States of America 
that this Senate failed to debate and 
vote on a nominee. But here we are; 
the damage is done. What do we do 
now? 
When an arsonist sets fire to your 
house, you don’t let it burn because 
you are worried about water damage. 
You have to strive to put out that fire, 
regardless of how difficult the task. So 
I say to you today, we cannot accept 
the defeatist attitude that fails to con-
front the forces destroying our Repub-
lic. 
There are two things we must do. 
Mission one, we have to reform the 
ability of this broken Senate to serve 
as a legislature because, if it serves ef-
fectively as a legislature, it can serve 
as a counterweight to decisions of a 
corrupted Court. 
The second thing we have to do is put 
all options on the table and debate 
them for directly reforming the Court, 
recognizing that we are left with dif-
ficult choices on how to do that. But 
we have to step up. It is necessary to 
save our Republic. 
So let’s take each of these missions 
in turn. The first is to restore the Sen-
ate. 
Our goal: Restore the Senate as a leg-
islative body to serve as a counter-
weight to the corruption of a MAGA- 
majority Court. 
There are three massive problems 
currently afflicting the Senate’s abil-
ity to serve as a functioning legislative 
body. First, we spend virtually all of 
our time on nominations, so much time 
that it keeps us from doing much legis-
lating, even though we have a mas-
sively complex society and a lot of pos-
sibilities for making it work better. 
When George Washington was assem-
bling his first administration, he had 
to appoint and the Senate had to con-
firm four Cabinet positions: Secretary 
of War, Secretary of the Treasury, Sec-
retary of State, and Attorney Gen-
eral—four positions. Today, the Senate 
is responsible for confirming over 1,200 
Presidential appointments to executive 
branch positions and commissions. 
Now, in the past, both parties worked 
to exercise the Senate’s advice and 
consent responsibilities in a manner 
that minimized the amount of Senate 
time required. Most were done by 
unanimous consent late at night, when 
practically anyone was here because 
most nominations are not ones to 
which anyone has an objection. 
In the entire decade of the 1960s, 
there was one vote required to close de-
bate on a nominee—one, in an entire 10 
years. But, last decade, that number 
went to 545. Now, it is like every nomi-
nation. Virtually every nomination we 
have to file to close debate and vote to 
close debate before we can vote on the 
nominee. And do you know what? The 
way it works, you can also require 30 
hours of debate after the vote to close 
debate succeeds. 
So the rules, which were designed for 
exceptional situations where there is a 
significant objection, are now used as 
partisan obstruction. 
Democrats are in the minority. They 
want to tie up the Republicans. So 
they have little time to legislate. 
Republicans are in the minority. 
They want to tie up the Democrats. So 
they have little time to legislate. 
They want each other to fail, partly 
because they disagree and partly be-
cause they know if the other side suc-
ceeds in making something work, the 
voters might reward them at the ballot 
box. 
We have to massively streamline this 
nomination process. We have to—100 
Senators—work together, not do what 
is best for us when we are in the major-
ity and oppose it when we are in the 
minority, or vice versa. We all have a 
responsibility to completely stream-
line that process so we can return to 
being a legislature. 
The second big problem for the Sen-
ate is that the rules provide a com-
plicated, time-consuming process for 
debating and voting on whether to de-
bate a bill. It involves a motion to pro-
ceed or requirement to close debate on 
the motion to proceed and whose nomi-
nation is up to 30 hours of additional of 
debate—all on the question of whether 
to debate. You have 100 capable people 
sent here by their constituents in their 
various States to solve problems for 
America, not to spend a week debating 
whether to debate a single bill. That 
could be a week spent debating the 
amendments that could make the bill 
better, a week spent considering indi-
vidual pieces of the bills so the public 
knows where we stand and there is pub-
lic accountability. But, instead, we 
have partisan paralysis. A completely 
dysfunctional Senate, that is what we 
have. We have to change the rules to 
stop this completely meritless waste of 
the time and efforts of 100 Senators. 
It is an easy solution: 1 hour spent 
debating whether to debate a bill, and 
then a simple majority vote, either we 
go to the bill or we don’t; easy solu-
tion. One hour makes much more sense 
than 1 week. 
The third big problem this Senate 
Chamber faces is a secret silent fili-
buster. Under the Senate rule—and by 
the way, the term ‘‘filibuster’’ is really 
inappropriate because this involves no 
speaking of any kind. Under the Senate 
rule, 41 Senators can, operating as a 
block, veto the opportunity for the 
Senate to debate a bill, veto the oppor-
tunity for the Senate to consider an 
amendment, and veto the ability, after 
amendments have been considered, to 
have a final vote on the bill. It is the 
triple veto: three opportunities for the 
minority to blockade the majority 
from being able to consider legislation 
to address the issues facing America. 
And both parties have attempted to use 
it when they are in the minority. We 
have to restore the ability to actually 
debate. 
It is exactly what the Founders 
feared. When I lay out that 41 can 
block and veto these 3 steps of the 
process, it means to reverse it—that 60 
out of 100, a supermajority, has to 
agree to go forward through each of 
those three steps. 
The Founders warned us: Never allow 
the minority to make the decisions by 
requiring a supermajority. Don’t to it. 
That is why James Madison said 
that, with a supermajority, when ‘‘the 
general good might require new laws 
. . . the principle of free government 
would be reversed. It would no longer 
be the majority that would rule: the 
power would be transferred to the mi-
nority.’’ 
It is why Alexander Hamilton warned 
that 
a 
supermajority 
requirement 
would result in ‘‘tedious delays; con-
tinual negotiation and intrigue; con-
temptible compromises of the public 
good.’’ 
He also warned that ‘‘the history of 
every political establishment in which 
this principle has prevailed’’—the prin-
ciple of supermajority—‘‘is a history 
impotence, perplexity, and disorder.’’ 
Now, you may wonder if the Found-
ers had simply read about someone 
somewhere requiring a supermajority 
for legislature and said it didn’t work 
very well and thought, We had better 
warn Americans not to do this. No, 
they were writing from their direct ex-
perience because, as they were drafting 
and debating our 1787 Constitution, 
they were actually in the middle of liv-
ing through the impotence and incom-
petence of the Confederation Congress. 
Under the Articles of Confederation, 
which preceded our 1787 Constitution, 
the Congress had to have a super-
majority on every provision; meaning, 
the position of the minority could pre-
vail over the position of the majority. 
The result was paralysis on the most 
fundamental issues they faced. They 
failed to raise the funds to pay the pen-
sions of the veterans who spilled their 
blood in the Revolutionary War that 
created this Nation. They failed to 
raise the funds to put down Shays’ Re-
bellion. 
Well, today, we have not one stage of 
veto, like they faced in the Confed-
eration Congress, we have the triple 
veto power under the current secret, si-
lent filibuster, and we are seeing the 
same impotence, the same paralysis, 
the same partisanship that it drives. 
The triple veto power of the minority 
is destroying the Senate to address 
challenges facing America, and there 
are a lot of them. 
We have got the climate crisis that is 
literally setting our country on fire. 
Right now, at this very moment, 
around 40 million Americans across the 
Plains and the Mississippi Valley are 
dealing with alerts for dangerous and 
intense heat, while firefighters are con-
fronting 89 large fires across 12 States. 
And as of last week, four times as 
much acreage has burned this year as 
last year at this moment. 
And it is not just America, of course. 
Across the Atlantic, Europe is going 
through a recordbreaking heat wave, 
reaching temperatures some of those

places have never seen and causing 
wildfires to burn in France and Spain 
and Italy and Greece. 
Congress should be immersed in con-
sidering bills to address the climate 
crisis that is damaging communities 
across 
our 
country, 
and 
not 
just 
through fires but through rising sea 
levels and rising erosion, through pine 
beetle infestations and mosquito infes-
tations, through stronger hurricanes 
and stronger tornadoes, and, certainly, 
through 
the 
power 
of 
multiyear 
droughts. But we are not because the 
triple veto of the silent, secret fili-
buster afflicting this body is blocking 
us from doing so. 
We have a housing crisis. Out-of-con-
trol rents and prices make it impos-
sible for millions of Americans to af-
ford a decent home to rent or buy. And 
colleagues have one idea after another 
about how we should address it, but be-
cause we are paralyzed and our process 
is taken up, our time is taken up with 
nominations and debating whether to 
debate and we have the triple veto of 
the secret, silent filibuster, they can’t 
move forward. And we aren’t debating, 
discussing, and hopefully passing meas-
ures that can make a difference. 
And Americans are outraged by the 
prices they pay on drugs, which are so 
much higher than any other developed 
country. Eighty percent of Americans 
say: Do something about it. And I 
think the other 20 percent don’t realize 
how much we are getting ripped off. 
And Americans know we should get the 
best price because we invest the most 
in the research and development that 
creates these drugs, not the worst 
price, and they are absolutely right. 
And we would have passed legislation 
by now to get the best prices in the de-
veloped world, but we are blocked by 
the triple veto of the secret, silent fili-
buster. 
And now States are passing laws to 
block targeted groups of Americans 
from voting. We can fix that by passing 
S. 1, the For the People Act, or its re-
incarnation, the Freedom to Vote Act, 
but we can’t because it was blocked by 
the triple veto of the secret, silent fili-
buster. 
Let me be absolutely clear. The sin-
gle most effective way we can counter-
balance an out-of-control Court with a 
MAGA agenda is to have a functioning 
Senate. That is the most immediate 
remedy available to us to respond to 
this terrible affliction undermining our 
Republic. 
If the Court says there is no problem 
with gerrymandered districts, where 
politicians choose their constituents 
instead of Americans choosing their 
leaders, as they did in the 2019 Rucho v. 
Common Cause decision, well, a re-
formed, restored Senate could pass leg-
islation to require nonpartisan com-
missions to draw legislative districts. 
At least we could have a robust debate 
over it, maybe pass a few amendments 
modifying it in different forms—or per-
haps find some other solution—if we 
had a functioning legislative process. 
If the Court says there is no limit to 
dark money from corporations and bil-
lionaires who flood and drown out the 
voices of ordinary Americans and cam-
paigns, as they did in the 2010 Citizens 
United decision, a reformed, restored 
Senate could pass the DISCLOSE Act 
to shine a light on every dollar and 
where it is coming from in American 
campaigns. 
If the Court says that anyone who 
wants to be able to carry a concealed 
weapon should be able to like they did 
in their New York State Rifle & Pistol 
Association v. Bruen decision, a re-
stored, functioning Senate could pass 
stronger gun safety laws that most 
Americans support, like ending the 
background check loophole—when guns 
are bought and sold by unlicensed par-
ties online or at gun shows—or by out-
lawing the kinds of large magazines 
that carry 30 or more bullets that are 
often used in mass shootings. 
And when the Court went to abnor-
mally great lengths to decide in last 
month’s West Virginia v. EPA that the 
Agency can’t regulate fossil carbon or 
fossil methane emissions, a functioning 
Senate would be able to step up and 
create the programs designed to speed 
up the transition to renewable energy, 
which would have the added benefit of 
ending our addiction to oil and drop-
ping the prices at the pump, and it 
would keep money out of the hands of 
dictators in Russia, Saudi Arabia, and 
Iran. But the triple veto of the secret, 
silent filibuster has blocked us from 
doing so. 
The remedy is not to eliminate the 
filibuster. The remedy is to reform it. 
The right reform is to adopt the public, 
talking filibuster. The talking fili-
buster would reassert the fundamental 
principle of legislative conduct: the 
Senate Code, adopted by the original 
Senate. Under that code, the Senate 
listened to every Senator’s perspective, 
and then it took a vote on the issue, be 
it a bill or be it an amendment. That 
was the Senate Code. 
The original rules provided that 
every Senator had the right to speak 
twice to a question. It was rule No. 4 in 
the original rules. It is in our rules 
today. But the spirit of that code—lis-
tening to each Senator and then vot-
ing, with the majority winning, not 
losing—that part is gone. Now, it is the 
minority that can exercise a triple 
veto, a veto absolutely exactly the op-
posite of what the Founders said to us. 
They said: Don’t do it. And we have 
done it in triplicate form, paralyzing 
this place and accentuating the temp-
tation of yielding to partisanship rath-
er than problem-solving. 
Jefferson did say that this rule, this 
code of listening to every Senator and 
voting, should not be abused. In fact, 
he said this in his manual for rules in 
1801: 
No one is to speak impertinently or beside 
the question, superfluously or tediously. 
It worked for the Founders. They ex-
ercised some self-control, so much so 
that they didn’t need the rule that 
they had to close debate. They just 
simply listened to everyone with mu-
tual respect and then said: OK. Let’s 
take a vote. 
You want to see that in action today? 
Watch the committee process on a bill 
with amendments. There is no one fili-
bustering, speaking forever. There is 
no one requiring a supermajority to 
close debate in committee. They oper-
ate—we operate—in committee, much 
like the original Senate, and it works 
pretty well, but we have completely 
lost that discipline when it comes to 
debate here on our floor. 
So the early Senate had a rule for the 
previous question motion, to close de-
bate or accelerate the closure of de-
bate. And when they rewrote the rule 
book—and Aaron Burr was in charge of 
it—in 1806, they dropped the rule be-
cause they never used it, didn’t feel 
they ever needed it. 
Well, we need to reclaim that vision, 
and our rules have gotten so crazy, so 
out of whack, that we encourage par-
tisanship and paralysis rather than 
problem-solving. Let’s fix that. 
So let’s have the talking filibuster. 
The talking filibuster says, Yes, you 
can speak on the issue. We will listen 
to everyone. You can speak twice. But 
then we vote, and the majority wins— 
not a supermajority required. The mi-
nority doesn’t win over the majority. 
The majority wins. 
That was the Senate. That was the 
design of our Constitution that we 
have the responsibility to restore be-
cause we took an oath to the Constitu-
tion. So let’s restore it. And that talk-
ing filibuster encourages bipartisan 
problem-solving. The minority, be it 
the Democratic or Republican, that 
wants to slow things down for leverage, 
they can. So they have significant le-
verage, but, on the other hand, they 
have an incentive to negotiate because 
they are not sure how long they can 
maintain continuous debate. And that 
is the heart of the talking filibuster: 
maintaining 
continuous 
debate. 
If 
there is a break in debate, you go to 
the vote. 
Meanwhile, the majority has an in-
centive to compromise because they 
know the minority can tie this place 
up on a single bill for week after week, 
and they can’t afford to have that 
much time taken over a single bill. So 
the talking filibuster restores an incen-
tive for compromise and bipartisan 
problem-solving and, in the end, re-
stores the vision that the majority 
makes the decision, not the minority. 
In the end, it gives the minority a 
voice, it gives the minority massive le-
verage, but it takes away their veto. 
That is the right way to legislate in a 
democracy. 
As I noted before, fixing the Senate is 
probably the best immediate tool we 
have for repairing the damage from the 
Supreme Court across the grounds. But 
we also have to consider every possible 
remedy to restore the Court itself, to 
restore a Court that calls the balls and 
strikes on the Constitution, defending

its core principles, and recognizes it is 
not there to legislate—not to legislate 
on the left side, not to legislate on the 
right side. They are there to defend the 
Constitution. 
Well, reforming the Court won’t be 
easily done. But President Biden did 
convene a Commission to explore the 
option, and that Commission has pro-
duced a lengthy, lengthy report. This is 
part of it: The Presidential Commis-
sion on the Supreme Court of the 
United States, December of last year. 
I encourage all my colleagues to read 
this and consider the ideas in it. In this 
300-page report, the Commission does 
review the history of how the Court has 
been in different phases, and its size 
has changed all the time because that 
is not established in the Constitution. 
It has been as few as 5, and it has been 
more than 10. There was not nine 
locked in like it is now. 
And, certainly, one of the ideas they 
review is adjustment to the size of the 
Court. Many people have said that is 
something to look at to balance what 
has happened with the Court, with the 
stolen Supreme Court seat and a deci-
sion by several Justices to be a legisla-
ture rather than a court. 
Well, that is one idea. Another is im-
plementing term limits or a mandatory 
retirement age because, when the Con-
stitution was first written, people 
weren’t living the long lives they have 
today, and they didn’t stay in the 
Court forever. 
In 1787, the Founders wrote that Jus-
tices would hold their seats during 
good behavior. Now, I am not sure that 
every Justice across these grounds has 
been engaged in good behavior when 
they are choosing to legislate rather 
than to rule on the defense of the Con-
stitution, but there is no easy way to 
remove them from the Court for mis-
behavior. 
But one possibility is for the Court 
members to rotate out with term lim-
its of some kind. That is one possi-
bility. 
In much of our history, Justices only 
served an average of 15 years on the 
Court. The average is now 26 and get-
ting longer. And, did you know, Amer-
ica is the only constitutional democ-
racy that gives lifetime presence on 
the Court, that doesn’t have either a 
term limit or a mandatory retirement 
age? 
This report, this Commission, has 
other ideas in it: rotating membership 
on the Court with judges selected from 
the circuit court. You know, the origi-
nal Supreme Court, they served as cir-
cuit court writers. They went out and 
made decisions across this country. 
They didn’t just sit in a room in the 
capital. So there is some precedent for 
that idea. 
And others point out that there is 
the power to restrict the Court’s juris-
diction. There are pros and cons for 
these various ideas, and our commit-
ment needs to be to examine them. The 
American public is open to examining 
them. 
Earlier this week, the FOX News poll 
reported that 66 percent of the folks in 
their poll support an 18-year term for 
Justices, and 71 percent support a man-
datory retirement age. So the Amer-
ican people are open to trying to fix 
the challenge with the Court. We have 
to be open to fixing it, and we need to 
look at every option and idea very 
carefully to ensure that the highest 
Court in our land fulfills the vision for 
it in our Constitution. And the vision 
in our Constitution was not that it 
would be an unelected super-legisla-
ture. 
Colleagues, this is a perilous moment 
for our Republic. It is a moment when 
the will of the people is being overrun 
by an extreme agenda of a Court legis-
lating from the Bench, imposing their 
narrow and precedent-destroying will 
on all Americans. We have to restore 
the ability of this Senate to operate as 
a legislature that can be a counter-
balance to what the Court does, and we 
must thoughtfully consider every pro-
posal for reforming the Court directly. 
We can and we must act before it is 
too late. We can’t stand by and watch 
the continuous disintegration of our 
Republic. 
Our oath to the Constitution de-
mands that we protect these institu-
tions and repair them when they go off 
track. And when we do, the next July 4, 
we can all join together and celebrate 
the restoration of our paralyzed and 
partisan Senate into an actual legisla-
tive body. We can celebrate the res-
toration of Americans’ rights that are 
being 
continuously 
stripped 
away 
across the grounds by the Supreme 
Court. We can have a renewed belief 
and confidence in the integrity of all of 
our institutions and our democratic 
form of governance. That would be a 
moment justifying a massive celebra-
tion next July 4.

MORNING BUSINESS 
PEACE CORPS REAUTHORIZATION 
ACT 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise to highlight the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee’s vote to favor-
ably report the Peace Corps Reauthor-
ization Act to the full Senate for its 
consideration. This legislation, the 
first reauthorization since 1999, is criti-
cally 
important 
to 
strengthening 
American leadership in the world. 
Last year, the Peace Corps celebrated 
its 60th anniversary of when President 
John F. Kennedy established this im-
portant program, run by its first Direc-
tor, Sargent Shriver. The Peace Corps’ 
mission then, as it is today, is to ‘‘pro-
mote world peace and friendship’’ by 
encouraging economic growth and well- 
being 
to 
underserved 
populations 
abroad, as well as giving Americans a 
better understanding of 
the 
wider 
world and vice-versa. 
The Peace Corps is emerging from 
one of the most challenging crises it 
has ever faced. On March 15, 2020, as 
the gravity and uncertainty of the 
COVID pandemic gripped the world, 
every mission was suspended for the 
first time in the Peace Corps’ history. 
In addition to executing the enor-
mously complex operation of evacu-
ating more than 7,000 Peace Corps vol-
unteers from all around the globe, the 
Peace Corps was faced with the chal-
lenge of how to operate and serve dur-
ing a period of global social isolation. 
As the world continues to recover 
from the pandemic, the Peace Corps is 
busy executing plans for reentering 
countries and resuming its mission of 
service around the world. While the

S3536 
July 20, 2022 
Peace Corps’ return is a testament to 
the resilience and adaptability of this 
vitally important branch of U.S. for-
eign affairs, COVID’s continued pres-
ence around the world requires the 
Peace Corps to undertake a wide array 
of new public safety measures to keep 
volunteers, staff, and host commu-
nities healthy and safe. 
And so this reauthorization comes at 
a most critical time for the Peace 
Corps. This is a once-in-a-generation 
opportunity to enact long overdue re-
forms and to make sure the agency can 
effectively 
promote 
international 
peace, development, and people-to-peo-
ple engagement. And it represents sig-
nificant reforms and strong bipartisan 
congressional support for the Agency 
at an inflection point in its history. 
This legislation will strengthen the 
Peace Corps, giving it the baseline 
budget it needs to build the program 
that Americans deserve. It sets a $375 
per month minimum for the Peace 
Corps volunteers’ readjustment allow-
ance. It suspends student loan interest 
during volunteer service. It extends 
healthcare coverage for returned Peace 
Corps 
volunteers. 
And 
it 
provides 
greater whistleblower protections so 
the Peace Corps will be transparent 
and accountable, honoring the stand-
ards and aspirations of its original vi-
sion, as outlined in 1961. 
The Peace Corps is on track to rede-
ploy volunteers to 30 countries by the 
end of this fiscal year. And it has set 
an aggressive goal of returning volun-
teers to almost all of the prepandemic 
countries by the end of fiscal year 2023. 
The programs and policy reforms au-
thorized in this legislation are crucial 
to ensuring the safe and successful re-
turn of volunteers to the field. 
I am especially proud of the bipar-
tisan work that has gone into this bill 
and appreciate the collaboration of the 
ranking member of Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee, Senator RISCH, for 
joining me on this important legisla-
tion. And I am pleased that we are 
joined by our colleagues, Senators 
CARDIN, YOUNG, SHAHEEN, PORTMAN, 
FEINSTEIN, and CORNYN, who should be 
commended for their support of the 
Peace Corps and to ensuring the Peace 
Corps can continue to support and en-
hance America’s leading role in the 
world. 
I also want to salute the tremendous 
input from the Peace Corps commu-
nity. Their commitment to improving 
security, conditions, and opportunities 
for future Peace Corps volunteers is 
vital to the introduction of this bill 
and improves our national security as 
well. 
So I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill and its swift passage. Passage 
of this bill will help bring about a revi-
talized, retooled Peace Corps. Making 
this bill law will help ensure the return 
of volunteers executing the important 
work of the Peace Corps, representing 
the United States of America overseas.

Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, on July 
20, 2012, Colorado suffered a horrific 
mass shooting at a movie theater in 
Aurora. A gunman took 12 innocent 
lives from us, each of them full of aspi-
rations for a future that was tragically 
and senselessly cut short. They leave 
behind family, friends, and a commu-
nity in Aurora that still carries the 
pain of their loss a decade later. 
Colorado will never forget and for-
ever honor the 12 victims of the Aurora 
shooting. Today, I ask to read their 
names into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
Jonathan Blunk was 26 years old. He 
was a father of two who moved to Colo-
rado in 2009 after three tours in the 
Persian Gulf and North Arabian Sea for 
the U.S. Navy. He was a certified fire-
fighter and EMT. Jon lost his life pro-
tecting his friend Jansen Young from 
the gunman’s line of fire. Jon shielded 
her from gunfire by pushing her to the 
ground while shots were fired. He was 
supposed to fly that Saturday to Ne-
vada to see his wife Chantel Blunk and 
his 4-year-old daughter and 2-year-old 
son. Instead, his wife had to put up the 
dress her daughter had picked out to 
wear to the airport. She told her 
daughter that they would not see their 
dad anymore, but that he would still 
love them and look over them. 
Alexander Jonathan Boik was 18 
years old. His friends and family called 
him A.J. He had just graduated from 
Gateway High School. He enjoyed base-
ball, music, and making pottery. A.J. 
was supposed to start art classes at the 
Rocky Mountain College of Art and De-
sign that fall. He was described ‘‘as 
being the life of the party,’’ who could 
bring a smile to anybody’s face.’’ He 
was a young man with a warm and lov-
ing heart. 
Jesse Childress was 29 years old. He 
was an Air Force cyber systems oper-
ator based at Buckley Air Force Base. 
He loved to play flag football, softball, 
and bowl. He was a devoted fan of the 
Denver Broncos and held season tick-
ets. His superior officer described him 
as an invaluable part of the 310th fam-
ily who touched everyone with whom 
he worked. 
Gordon Cowden was 51 years old. He 
was originally from Texas and lived in 
Aurora with his family. He was ‘‘a 
quick witted world traveler with a 
keen sense of humor, he will be remem-
bered for his devotion to his children 
and for always trying to do the right 
thing, no matter the obstacle.’’ Gordon 
took his two teenage children to the 
theater the night of the shooting. Both 
of them, thankfully, made it out 
unharmed. 
Jessica Ghawi was 24 years old. She 
was an aspiring journalist, most re-
cently interning with Mile High Sports 
Radio in Denver, and went by the nick-
name ‘‘Redfield.’’’ She was hard-work-
ing, ambitious, and had a generous 
spirit and kind heart. When several 
homes were destroyed by Colorado 
wildfires, 
Jessica 
collected 
hockey 
equipment to donate to the kids af-
fected because she wanted to help. 
That was who she was. 
John Thomas Larimer was 27 years 
old. He was a cryptologic technician 
with the Navy based also at Buckley 
Air Force Base, a job that requires ‘‘ex-
ceptionally good character and skills.’’’ 
Originally from Chicago, John was the 
youngest of five siblings and had joined 
the service just over a year before the 
shooting. Like his father and grand-
father, John chose to serve in the U.S. 
Navy. John’s superior officer called 
him ‘‘an outstanding shipmate, a val-
ued member of the Navy and an ex-
tremely dedicated sailor.’’ Colleagues 
praised his calming demeanor and ex-
ceptional work ethic. 
Matthew McQuinn was 27 years old. 
Matt 
died 
while 
protecting 
his 
girlfriend Samantha Yowler by jump-
ing in front of her during the shooting. 
Matt and Samantha moved to Colorado 
from Ohio last fall and worked at Tar-
get. He and Samantha were in love and 
planning their future life together. 
Matt’s bravery saved Samantha’s life. 
Micayla ‘‘Cayla’’ Medek was 23 years 
old. Cayla was a graduate of William C. 
Hinkley High School in Aurora and a 
resident of Westminster. She worked at 
Subway and was a huge Green Bay 
Packers fan. Cayla would plan weekend 
activities around watching the games 
with her brother and father. She is re-
membered as a loving and gentle young 
woman. 
Veronica Moser-Sullivan was 6 years 
old. She had just learned to swim and 
attended 
Holly 
Ridge 
Elementary 
School in Denver. She was a good stu-
dent who loved to play dress-up and 
read. 
Alex Sullivan was 27 years old. He 
was at the movie celebrating his 27th 
birthday and first wedding anniver-
sary. He loved comic books, the New 
York Mets, and movies. Alex was such 
a big movie fan that he took jobs at 
theaters just to see the movies. Alex 
stood 6 feet, 4 inches, and weighed 
about 280 pounds. He played football 
and wrestled before graduating high 
school in 2003 and later went to cul-
inary school. Alex was known as a 
gentle giant and was loved by many. 
Alexander C. Teves was 24 years old. 
Alex received an M.A. in counseling 
psychology from the University of Den-
ver and was planning on becoming a 
psychiatrist. He also competed in the 
Tough Mudder, an intense endurance 
challenge, and helped students with 
special needs. Alex was at the theater 
on the night of the shooting with his 
girlfriend Amanda Lindgren. When the 
gunman opened fire, Alex immediately 
lunged to block Amanda from the gun-
fire, held her down, and covered her 
head. 
Rebecca Wingo was 32 years old. 
Originally from Texas, Rebecca joined 
the Air Force after high school, where 
she became fluent in Mandarin Chinese 
and served as a translator. She was a 
single mother of two girls and worked 
as a customer relations representative

at a mobile medical imaging company. 
Rebecca was also enrolled at the Com-
munity College of Aurora and had been 
working toward an associate of arts de-
gree. She was known to family and 
friends as a ‘‘gentle, sweet, beautiful 
soul.’’ 
When I came to the floor a decade 
ago, I said that scripture tells us ‘‘not 
to be overcome by evil, but overcome 
evil with good.’’ That is what the peo-
ple of Aurora have done for the past 10 
years. Today, we recommit to not re-
member July 20 for the evil act that 
day. 
We choose to remember the beautiful 
lives lost and the loved ones they left 
behind. 
We 
choose 
to 
remember 
the 
70 
wounded survivors, whose resilience in 
the years since is a testament to hu-
manity’s resolve. 
We choose to remember the heroic 
acts of everyday citizens, our first re-
sponders, and medical personnel who 
saved lives that otherwise surely would 
have been lost. 
And we choose to remember the pro-
found generosity of the Coloradans and 
Americans who donated blood in record 
numbers and raised funds to support 
the survivors. 
A decade later, Colorado and the 
country continue to draw strength 
from the example set by the people of 
Aurora. And we recommit to ending 
the American scourge of gun violence— 
unique among industrialized nations— 
that has cut short too many innocent 
lives in our communities.

AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, fol-
lowing my submission yesterday, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the RECORD the next part of an inves-
tigation directed by the U.S. Central 
Command concerning the Abbey Gate 
bombing in Afghanistan in August 2021. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
ACTS–SCK–DO 
SUBJECT: Findings and Recommendation— 
Attack Against U.S. Forces Conducting 
NEO at Hamid Karzai International Air-
port on 26 August 2021. 
(3) Gate Operations. 
(a) Occupation of Abbey Gate. At approxi-
mately 0800 on 19 August, Golf Company, re-
inforced by Fox Company platoons, arrived 
at Abbey Gate and found U.K. and other for-
eign forces standing in the inner corridor 
(exhibits 77, 89). Golf Company attempted to 
open the gate to process evacuees and enable 
U.K. Forces to move to the Barron Hotel (ex-
hibits 77, 89). This attempt failed because the 
large and desperate crowd in the outer cor-
ridor nearly breached the gate and forced 
Golf Company to stop in less than an hour 
(exhibits 77, 89). On 20 August during the pe-
riod of darkness, Golf Company, reinforced 
by Fox Company platoons, moved the crowd 
approximately 150 meters south passed the 
entrance of the Barron Hotel (exhibits 77, 83, 
89). 24th MEU engineers emplaced several 
shipping containers to form an obstacle, 
known as the Chevron, in the road (exhibits 
77, 83, 86, 87, 89). The Taliban were employed 
to man the outside of the obstacle and con-
ducted initial screening and crowd control 
(exhibits 77, 83, 89). Later on 20 August, 
crowds in the canal breached the southern 
end of the fence separating the canal from 
the outer corridor (exhibits 83, 172). Marines 
identified the need to clear the nearside of 
the canal and keep crowds on the opposite 
side (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 83). 
(b) Steady State Gate Operations. 
(i) After the establishment of the Chevron 
and clearing the nearside of the canal, 2/1 es-
tablished a steady state operation of screen-
ing evacuees and movement to the PAX Ter-
minal (exhibits 53, 77, 83, 89). Steady state 
was between 21–25 August. Marines on the 
canal would search for persons with docu-
ments (passports, immigration forms) meet-
ing the current eligibility requirements for 
evacuation (exhibits 77, 83). Marines at the 
Chevron would do a similar screening (exhib-
its 78, 79). After pulling them into the outer 
corridor perimeter, they would conduct a 
cursory search of the potential evacuees, and 
place them into the holding area (exhibits 77, 
83). 2/1 Marines established the holding area 
in the outer corridor traffic lane, against the 
HKIA exterior wall (exhibits 57, 60, 61, 77, 83). 
When DoS Consular officers were available, 
Marines would escort evacuees from the 
holding area to the search area in the inner 
corridor (exhibits 57, 60, 61, 77, 83). After 
thoroughly searching the potential evacuees, 
Marines would escort them to an area fur-
ther into the inner corridor to be screened by 
the Consular officer (exhibits 57, 60, 61, 77, 
83). The Consular officer would determine if 
the evacuees met the eligibility criteria and 
approve moving the evacuees forward to the 
PAX Terminal, or reject them, and the Ma-
rines would return them to the canal (exhib-
its 56, 57, 60, 61, 77, 79, 80, 82). The FST would 
assist in the searches and the escort of re-
jected civilians back to the canal (exhibits 
77, 83, 107). Corpsmen were staged a CCP in 
the inner corridor and treated casualties at 
the canal or Chevron (exhibits 77, 83, 98). 
(ii) U.K. Forces conducted NEO from the 
Barron Hotel, but also provided personnel for 
security on the canal and the Chevron (ex-
hibits 53, 56, 76, 77, 127). U.K. support to 
steady state gate operations reduced as the 
NEO progressed (exhibits 77). Other partner 
nations provided no assistance with security 
at Abbey Gate (exhibits 56, 57, 60–63. 77, 79– 
88). Partner forces utilized Abbey Gate to es-
cort their own consular officers or to pull 
evacuees from the crowd (exhibits 77, 79–89). 
Partner nations often did not coordinate 
their activities with Marines at Abbey Gate, 
and did not adhere to the established proc-
essing or security procedures (exhibits 79–89). 
(c) Increased Crowds and Attack. 
(i) On 25 August, Echo Company recognized 
an increase in the size and desperation of the 
crowd (exhibits 53, 56). The Echo Company 
[TEXT REDACTED] was concerned with the 
crowd pushing past the jersey barriers at the 
base of the sniper tower and not having 
space to operate (exhibit 56). In response, 
Echo Company cleared the crowd on the 
nearside of the canal (exhibits 56, 60–62). 
Echo Company positioned Marines approxi-
mately 150 meters down the canal, running 
northeast, to maintain control of the near-
side (exhibit 56, 77). At approximately 1600, 
Golf Company relieved Echo company and 
assumed the same positions along the canal, 
the outer corridor, and inner corridor (ex-
hibit 77) [TEXT REDACTED] received sev-
eral updates concerning SVIED attacks at 
gates and determined the positions down the 
canal presented unacceptable risk to force 
and isolated Marines from support, to in-
clude CASEVAC (exhibit 77). Golf Company 
withdrew the Marines back down the near-
side of the canal and crowds backfilled the 
space almost immediately (exhibits 77, 83). 
[TEXT REDACTED] stopped the flow of 
evacuees and took the defensive posture pre-
viously mentioned (exhibits 77, 83). 
(ii) The next day, crowds were even larger 
and more unruly (exhibits 53, 56, 77, 83). Golf 
Company was forced to push additional Ma-
rines to the canal to keep them from cross-
ing the jersey barriers at the base of the 
sniper tower (exhibits 53, 76, 77). Echo Com-
pany assumed inner gate responsibilities so 
Golf Company could maintain the positions 
on the canal (exhibits 56, 57). The crowds 
grew so desperate, they began to crush peo-
ple against the sniper tower walls and jersey 
barriers (exhibits 53, 75, 77, 105). Golf Com-
pany Marines consolidated at the base of the 
tower in response (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 83, Brit 
Video). At 1736, the single explosion oc-
curred, and detonated directly across from 
the platoon gathered at the base of the tower 
(exhibits 5, 53, 76, 77, 83, 89). Shortly after, 
Abbey Gate closed, the 1/82nd IBCT took over 
security of the Gate, U.K. Forces passed 
through for the final time from the Barron 
Hotel, and gate operations ended (exhibits 53, 
56, 77, 124, 127). 
(4) Preventability of the Abbey Gate At-
tack. The attack was not preventable at the 
tactical level without degrading the mission 
to maximize the number of evacuees. Given 
the priority of effort, time, resources, part-
ner nation requirements, and terrain re-
straints, the only mitigation possible would 
have jeopardized the flow of evacuees and po-
tentially risk mission failure. 
(a) The priority for the Marines at Abbey 
Gate was maximizing the flow of evacuees 
through the gate to the ECC (exhibits 11, 15, 
18, 56, 77, 88). Any time spent emplacing ob-
stacles was time not spent searching and 
screening civilian evacuees. Additionally, 
many force protection measures that could 
have been implemented, such as additional 
T-Walls or HESCO barriers, would have in-
herently reduced the flow of evacuees. Clos-
ing the gate was also not an option because 
of U.K. efforts to conclude evacuation oper-
ations at the nearby Barron Hotel (exhibits 
18, 54, 121, 127). Closing the gates would have 
isolated U.K. Forces and jeopardized the JTE 
force flow and timeline, potentially initi-
ating renewed armed conflict with the 
Taliban (exhibits 15, 18, 21, 23, 125). 
(b) Leaders at Abbey Gate on 26 August 
made frequent decisions (multiple times 
daily) to increase the force protection pos-
ture. Electronic countermeasures were al-
ready emplaced to prevent enemy coordina-
tion and radio controlled device use (exhibit 
65). Several times during the 18 hours prior 
to the attack, the company commander 
stopped the flow at the gate and had Marines 
take covered positions (exhibits 77, 83, 84). 
Medics were consolidated in the inner cor-
ridor to ensure their safety and quick reac-
tion to any attack, and additional medical 
assets were surged forward (exhibits 66, 77, 
98). An Afghan interpreter was recruited to 
pacify the crowd using PSYOP capabilities 
(exhibit 107). ISR was increased and the 
Taliban were tasked to screen for the spe-
cific threat (exhibits 18, 125). Leaders struck 
the balance of protecting the force and maxi-
mizing the flow of evacuees as best as pos-
sible under the circumstances. 
D. READINESS 
(1) Key Findings. 
(a) Most units that deployed to HKIA in 
support of the Afghanistan NEO, with the ex-
ception of USFOR–A FWD and JTF–CR, had 
adequate manning levels for the assigned 
mission. USFOR–A FWD and JTF–CR staffs 
were task-saturated due to the nature of the 
NEO. The effects were further exacerbated 
by the fact that many of their personnel 
were forced to expend significant energy try-
ing to find specific evacuees, or groups of 
evacuees, at the gates of HKIA, on behalf of

various U.S. government officials, senior 
military officers, or special interest groups. 
(b) All units deployed to HKIA in support 
of the Afghanistan NEO had trained on their 
respective mission essential tasks (METs) 
prior to deployment. In some cases, this in-
cluded NEG-specific training, while in others 
it did not. Leaders at all levels stated no 
training could adequately prepare them for 
what they experienced at HKIA. 
(2) USFOR–A FWD. 
(a) Manning. USFOR–A FWD, led by RADM 
Pete Vasely, USN, Commander, USFOR–A 
FWD, and Brigadier Thomas Day, United 
Kingdom, Deputy Commander, USFOR–A 
FWD, was originally task organized and 
manned as a SOJTF in anticipation of tak-
ing over the NSOCC–A mission. In June 2021, 
they transitioned Into Diplomatic Assurance 
Platform-Afghanistan (DAP–A), with a focus 
on the medical, flight, and security require-
ments of USEK (exhibit 20). In July 2021, 
RADM Vasely took command from General 
Miller, and assumed the functions of Reso-
lute 
Support 
Headquarters 
(RSHQ) 
and 
USFOR–A, albeit with a drastically reduced 
footprint due to a reduced boots on the 
ground (BOG) force cap of 650 being imple-
mented. In addition to USFOR–A FWD’s or-
ganic staff, they had TACON of one company 
from 2nd IBCT, 10th Mountain Division, and 
two companies from 3rd IBCT, 10th Mountain 
Division (exhibits 20, 21). 
(b) Training. USFOR–A FWD trained to de-
ploy as a SOJTF, and did not train to assume 
the role of RSHQ and USFOR–A, nor did they 
train to conduct a NEO. While deployed, 
USFOR–A FWD participated in the 28 June 
Operational Planning Team (OPT) at USEK, 
focused on pre-NEO planning. USFOR–A 
FWD then participated in the CENTCOM-led 
NEO tabletop exercise (TTX) on 29 June, and 
a National Security Council (NSC)-led NEO 
TTX on 6 August (exhibits 20, 21). 
(3) 82nd Airborne Division. 
(a) Manning. 82nd Airborne Division HQ, 
led by MG Christopher Donahue, initially de-
ployed with a small team of six staff mem-
bers, and arrived at HKIA on 18 August. The 
remainder of the Division HQ staff arrived on 
20 August, bringing the 82nd’s total man-
power to 106 personnel (exhibits 125, 152). The 
1st IBCT, 82nd Airborne Division (1/82 IBCT), 
led by [TEXT REDACTED] deployed as part 
of the IRF, began to arrive at HKIA on 15 
August, and had roughly 1000 soldiers on 
hand by 16 August. The number of personnel 
TACON to 1/82 IBCT would swell to 2360 
throughout the NEO (exhibits 130, 152). The 1/ 
82 IBCT HQ was comprised of 65 personnel, 
and it had TACON of elements from 1/504 PIR 
(515 personnel), 2/504 PIR (378 personnel), 2/ 
501 PIR (504 personnel), 3/319 Artillery (257 
personnel), 307th Brigade Support Battalion 
(BSB) (56 personnel), 127th Airborne Engi-
neer Battalion (24 personnel), 50th Expedi-
tionary Signal Battalion (4 personnel), 16th 
Military Police Brigade (150 personnel), and 
1/194 Armor Regiment (412 personnel) (exhib-
its 152, 153). 
(b) Training. The 82nd Airborne Division 
HQ is trained to deploy rapidly, as part of 
the IRF, and did so in support of the NEO. 
While deployed to HKIA, the Division HQ 
participated in MASCAL TTXs and Re-
hearsal of Concept (ROC) drills, as well as 
Rules of Engagement (ROE) ROC drills with 
subordinate and adjacent units (exhibit 125). 
1/82 IBCT began its IRF preparation training 
in March 2021 during its Joint Readiness 
Training Center (JRTC) rotation. During the 
IBCT’s time at JRTC, units rehearsed civic 
engagement, conducted mock interagency 
engagements, 
utilized 
role 
players, 
and 
trained on entry control point operations. 
They did not train on crowd control or NEO 
(exhibits 121, 123). The 1/82 IBCT conducted 
Leader Professional Development sessions, 
where they executed tactical decision games 
focused on NEO (exhibits 121, 123). The bri-
gade also trained to secure airfields (exhibits 
121, 123, 124). 2/501 PIR executed three deploy-
ment readiness exercises (DREs), where they 
practiced 
deploying 
out 
of 
Joint 
Base 
Charleston, South Carolina (exhibit 123). 
(4) JTF–CR. 
(a) Manning. JTF–CR activated in antici-
pation of the Afghanistan NEO, and initially 
had a joint manning document (JMD) with 
187 personnel associated with it. The JTF 
sent three Liaison Officers (LNOs) forward to 
Afghanistan in May 2021 to coordinate with 
USFOR–A, USEK, and HKIA. Additionally, 
the JTF sent a quartering party comprised 
of three Marines to HKIA to begin prepara-
tions for receiving the JTF in the event of a 
NEO (exhibit 15). On 19 July, JTF–CR sent an 
EEAT comprised of 49 personnel to HKIA to 
assist DoS with processing SIV applicants 
for travel to the U.S., and to continue prep-
arations for receiving the JTF at HKIA in 
the event of a NEO (exhibits 15, 18). By the 
third week of July, JTF–CR had 55 personnel 
on the ground at HKIA, and would send an 
additional 28 personnel forward from Bahrain 
on 4 August (exhibit 15). By 26 August, the 
JTF–CR staff was back down to 59 personnel, 
as some staff members had redeployed. JTF– 
CR staff personnel were chosen for their 
versatility, so they could multi-task, and the 
JTF opted to place a heavy emphasis on 
planning ability, due to the anticipated re-
quirement of multiple, competing planning 
efforts throughout the execution of the NEO 
(exhibit 15). When the NEO began, the JTF– 
CR was forced to employ most of its staff as 
a security force, due to multiple breaches in 
the HKIA perimeter and a limited number of 
security forces being on deck at HKIA (ex-
hibits 15, 18). 
(b) Training. JTF–CR was certified as a 
JTF in 2019 (exhibits 15, 18), and again in 2020 
(exhibit 18). In addition to its certification 
via exercises and training, the JTF had acti-
vated three times within the past year, to in-
clude its planning response to the Beirut 
Port explosion in August 2020, and its deploy-
ment in support of Operation OCTAVE 
QUARTZ off the coast of Somalia in the 
spring of 2021 (exhibit 18). JTF–CR partici-
pated in NEO TTXs with CENTCOM at the 
end of June, and the NSC on 6 August, but 
JTF–CR staff members considered both to be 
ineffective, due to faulty planning assump-
tions (exhibits 17, 18). During NEO execution 
at HKIA, JTF–CR conducted MASCAL re-
hearsals with the Role II clinic and USFOR– 
A FWD, which ultimately paid dividends on 
26 August (exhibits 15, 16, 18). Multiple lead-
ers from JTF–CR stated that no training 
could have truly prepared service members 
for 
the 
tasks 
they 
executed 
at 
HKIA 
throughout the NEO (exhibits 17, 18). 
(5) 24th MEU. 
(a) Manning. The 24th MEU, led by [TEXT 
REDACTED] began sending Marines into 
HKIA as part of its quartering party in mid- 
July, and its CE began flowing into HKIA on 
15 August. At full strength, the MEU had 
1249 Marines and Sailors at HKIA, the bulk 
of which resided within BLT 1/8 and CLB–24 
(exhibits 100, 101, 104). BLT 1/8 deployed 996 
Marines and Sailors across three rifle com-
panies, a weapons company, an artillery bat-
tery, a light armored reconnaissance com-
pany (-), an engineer platoon, and a recon-
naissance company (-) (exhibits 100, 104). 
CLB–24 deployed to HKIA with 225 Marines 
and Sailors, task organized to support 24- 
hour ECC operations, with roughly 70 Ma-
rines supporting three, 8-hour shifts each 
day. CLB–24 personnel provided combat serv-
ice support to other units across HKIA, when 
they were not operating at the ECC. CLB–24 
also task organized a FST, comprised of 35 
female Marines and Sailors, with augmenta-
tion from BLT 1/8. CLB–24 had SPMAGTF’s 
Combat Logistics Detachment–21 (CLD–21), 
and Marine Wing Support Detachment–373 
(MWSD–373) attached to support ECC oper-
ations (exhibit 101). 
(b) Training. 24th MEU completed the 
standard pre-deployment training program 
focused on the MEU’s 13 core METs, includ-
ing NEO (exhibits 100, 101, 104). The unit con-
ducted an additional, four-day NEO training 
package, sponsored by Expeditionary Oper-
ations Training Group (EOTG) in January 
2021, which included DoS and civilian role 
player participants (exhibits 100, 101, 104). In 
June 2021, while ashore in Jordan, 24th 
MEU’s CE and BLT conducted embassy rein-
forcement and NEO training at the U.S. Em-
bassy in Amman (exhibits 100, 104). In July, 
the MEU offloaded in Kuwait to posture for 
a 
potential 
NEO 
in 
Afghanistan, 
and 
throughout the month of July and into Au-
gust, the CE, BLT, and CLB trained daily on 
various aspects of NEO, to include embassy 
reinforcement, fixed site security, ECC oper-
ations, and NEO Tracking System operations 
(exhibits 100, 101, 104). Additionally, the FST 
Marines and Sailors trained on proper search 
techniques to be employed at an ECC or ECP 
(exhibits 101, 107). MEU leadership agreed 
that the NEO training they conducted did 
not adequately train their Marines and Sail-
ors for the conditions they faced at HKIA 
(exhibits 100, 101, 104). 
(6) SPMAGTF. 
(a) Manning. The SPMAGTF deployed a 
‘‘heavy package’’ to HKIA with components 
of the GCE, comprised of 2nd Battalion, 1st 
Marines (2/1), the Logistics Combat Element 
(LCE), comprised of CLD–21, and Aviation 
Combat 
Element 
(ACE), 
comprised 
of 
MWSD–373. 
Additionally, 
the 
SPMAGTF 
‘‘heavy package’’ included an STP and two 
EOD teams (exhibits 55, 65, 66). 2/1 deployed 
its entire battalion, with the exception of 
one platoon from Golf Company, which pro-
vided escort security aboard SPMAGTF 
flights to/from HKIA, two platoons from Fox 
Company, which remained at the Baghdad 
Embassy Complex (BEC) in Iraq to provide 
security, and their Combat Engineer Pla-
toon, which stayed at the BEC to support 
force protection improvements there (exhib-
its 53, 54, 55, 56, 77, 78, 79, 81). As a result of 
the Engineer Platoon not deploying to HKIA, 
2/1 was forced to depend on CLD–21’s engi-
neer section, whose focus at HKIA was ECC 
operations, and the BLT’s Engineer Platoon, 
whose focus was supporting the BLT at 
North and East Gates. 
(b) Training.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING RANDY ‘‘R.D.’’ 
KINSEY 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life of R.D. Kinsey 
who passed away on July 11, 2022, at 
the age of 69. Mr. Kinsey was a hus-
band, father, veteran, civil servant and 
beloved leader in the State of Arkansas 
with a reputation for wisdom and com-
passion. 
A native of South Florida, Kinsey 
moved to Arkansas after his service in 
the U.S. Air Force. After he was honor-
ably discharged in 1972, he realized his 
passion and desire to uplift and advo-
cate for his fellow veterans. 
Stepping into a new platform of serv-
ice with the U.S. Department of Vet-
erans Affairs, Kinsey spent much of his 
time counseling combat veterans even

before post-traumatic stress disorder 
and traumatic brain injuries were for-
mal diagnoses. 
Kinsey’s friends recognized him as a 
man who actively worked to make 
positive changes for veterans through-
out his career. Upon his retirement 
from civil service in 2000, he continued 
to blaze trails within the American Le-
gion, serving in local, State, and na-
tional capacities. He was instrumental 
in founding American Legion Post 74 in 
North Little Rock, where he served as 
founding commander and commander 
for 14 years. 
He made an annual trip to Wash-
ington, DC, during the American Le-
gion’s testimony to Congress about its 
legislative priorities and advocated on 
behalf of Arkansas veterans. 
In 2018, he became the first African- 
American State commander of the 
American Legion of Arkansas. Kinsey 
was not focused on the tag-line and 
pressures that may arise from being 
the first minority to sit in the State 
commander seat because, in his words, 
‘‘All our blood runs the same.’’ This 
was one of many examples of how he 
led his life with humility and selfless-
ness. 
During his time in the Air Force, 
Kinsey specialized in security, where 
he fought to protect his fellow airmen 
in combat. During his time serving vet-
erans, he fought to strengthen the ben-
efits they earned. Service, advocacy, 
and security were his life’s tenets. 
At the celebration of the American 
Legion’s 100th anniversary, Kinsey said 
his time as commander was his way of 
giving back blessings to help others 
and what could be a more rewarding 
experience than to be able and help a 
veteran in need. 
He served in the greatest capacity 
alongside his wife, Dianna and their 
two daughters, Meredith and Allison 
and their grandsons. He was a loving 
father, caring coworker, servant lead-
er, gracious husband, and friend to all. 
His wife recently said that his motto 
was ‘‘For God and country.’’ I hope we 
can learn from his example to remem-
ber 
the 
American 
blood 
flowing 
through all of us and work together to 
make this country better than we 
found it. 
I join R.D Kinsey’s family, friends, 
and all Arkansans in mourning his 
passing. His fingerprint will forever 
mark Arkansas. From Florida, North 
Little Rock, Washington, and every-
where in between, his legacy will carry 
on with current and future genera-
tions. In his spirit we will continue to 
advance the benefits for and meet the 
needs of American veterans.∑

TRIBUTE TO JIM HALVORSON 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
Jim Halvorson of the Montana Board of 
Oil and Gas Conservation for his dedi-
cation to Montana and his 32 years of 
public service. 
Raised near Pendroy, MT, Jim grad-
uated from the Montana School of 
Mines, better known today as Montana 
Tech University. After years of work in 
both Wyoming and Colorado, Jim made 
his way back home to the Treasure 
State and went on to begin his career 
with the Montana Board of Oil and Gas 
Conservation. He started out as a pe-
troleum geologist and was eventually 
appointed as Administrator. Jim’s role 
included administering Montana’s oil 
and gas conservation laws, promoting 
conservation, and overseeing oil and 
gas exploration and production in the 
State. 
As Jim enters into retirement, he 
can rest assured that he has made a 
lasting impact on Montana’s oil and 
gas industry. He will now have the op-
portunity to enjoy the fruits of his 
labor as he plans to spend more time in 
the great outdoors, whether that be 
fishing or enjoying time with his wife 
of 40 years, Diana. 
It is my honor to recognize Jim Hal-
vorson for his dedication to the Mon-
tana Board of Oil and Gas Conservation 
and for his 32 years of public service to 
the great State of Montana. Jim, 
thank you for your many years of pub-
lic service and your commitment to 
preserving our State’s oil and gas re-
serves. I wish you all the best in your 
retirement. 
You 
make 
Montana 
proud.∑

of the Republic of Finland and the King-
dom of Sweden with six declarations and 
one condition (Ex. Rept. 117–5)] 
The 
text 
of 
the 
committee-rec-
ommended resolution of advice and 
consent to ratification is as follows: 
Resolved (two-thirds of the Senators present 
concurring therein), 
Section 1. Senate advice and consent sub-
ject to declarations and conditions. 
The Senate advises and consents to the 
ratification of the Protocols to the North At-
lantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of the 
Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Swe-
den, which were signed on July 5, 2022, by the 
United States of America and other parties 
to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 (Treaty 
Doc. 117–3), subject to the declarations of 
section 2 and the condition of section 3. 
Sec. 2. declarations. 
The advice and consent of the Senate 
under section 1 is subject to the following 
declarations: 
(1) Reaffirmation That United States Mem-
bership in NATO Remains a Vital National 
Security Interest of the United States.—The 
Senate declares that— 
(A) for more than 70 years the North Atlan-
tic Treaty Organization (NATO) has served 
as the preeminent organization to defend the 
countries in the North Atlantic area against 
all external threats; 
(B) through common action, the estab-
lished democracies of North America and Eu-
rope that were joined in NATO persevered 
and prevailed in the task of ensuring the sur-
vival of democratic government in Europe 
and North America throughout the Cold 
War; 
(C) NATO enhances the security of the 
United States by embedding European states 
in a process of cooperative security planning 
and by ensuring an ongoing and direct lead-
ership role for the United States in European 
security affairs; 
(D) the responsibility and financial burden 
of defending the democracies of Europe and 
North America can be more equitably shared 
through an alliance in which specific obliga-
tions and force goals are met by its mem-
bers; 
(E) the security and prosperity of the 
United States is enhanced by NATO’s collec-
tive defense against aggression that may 
threaten the security of NATO members; and 
(F) United States membership in NATO re-
mains a vital national security interest of 
the United States. 
(2) Strategic Rationale for NATO Enlarge-
ment.—The Senate declares that— 
(A) the United States and its NATO allies 
face continued threats to their stability and 
territorial integrity; 
(B) an attack against Finland or Sweden, 
or the destabilization of either arising from 
external subversion, would threaten the sta-
bility of Europe and jeopardize United States 
national security interests; 
(C) Finland and Sweden, having established 
democratic governments and having dem-
onstrated a willingness to meet the require-
ments of membership, including those nec-
essary to contribute to the defense of all 
NATO members, are in a position to further 
the principles of the North Atlantic Treaty 
and to contribute to the security of the 
North Atlantic area; and 
(D) extending NATO membership to Fin-
land and Sweden will strengthen NATO, en-
hance stability in Europe, and advance the 
interests of the United States and its NATO 
allies. 
(3) Support for NATO’s Open Door Pol-
icy.—The policy of the United States is to 
support NATO’s Open Door Policy that al-
lows any European country to express its de-
sire to join NATO and demonstrate its abil-
ity to meet the obligations of NATO mem-
bership. 
(4) Future Consideration of Candidates for 
Membership in NATO.— 
(A) Senate Finding.—The Senate finds that 
the United States will not support the acces-
sion to the North Atlantic Treaty of, or the 
invitation to begin accession talks with, any 
European state ( other than Finland and 
Sweden), unless— 
(i) the President consults with the Senate 
consistent with Article II, section 2, clause 2 
of the Constitution of the United States (re-
lating to the advice and consent of the Sen-
ate to the making of treaties); and 
(ii) the prospective NATO member can ful-
fill all of the obligations and responsibilities 
of membership, and the inclusion of such 
state in NATO would serve the overall polit-
ical and strategic interests of NATO and the 
United States. 
(B) Requirement for Consensus and Ratifi-
cation.—The Senate declares that no action 
or agreement other than a consensus deci-
sion by the full membership of NATO, ap-
proved by the national procedures of each 
NATO member, including, in the case of the 
United States, the requirements of Article 
II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of 
the United States (relating to the advice and 
consent of the Senate to the making of trea-
ties), will constitute a commitment to col-
lective defense and consultations pursuant 
to Articles 4 and 5 of the North Atlantic 
Treaty. 
(5) Influence of Non-NATO Members on 
NATO Decisions.—The Senate declares that 
any country that is not a member of NATO 
shall have no impact on decisions related to 
NATO enlargement. 
(6) Support for 2014 Wales Summit Defense 
Spending Benchmark.—The Senate declares 
that all NATO members should continue to 
fulfill or move towards the guideline out-
lined in the 2014 Wales Summit Declaration 
to spend a minimum of 2 percent of their 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on defense 
and 20 percent of their defense budgets on 
major equipment, including research and de-
velopment, by 2024. 
Sec. 3. condition. 
The advice and consent of the Senate 
under section 1 is subject to the following 
conditions 
(1) Presidential Certification.—Prior to the 
deposit of the instrument of ratification, the 
President shall certify to the Senate as fol-
lows: 
(A) The inclusion of Finland and Sweden in 
NATO will not have the effect of increasing 
the overall percentage share of the United 
States in the common budgets of NATO. 
(B) The inclusion of Finland and Sweden in 
NATO does not detract from the ability of 
the United States to meet or to fund its mili-
tary requirements outside the North Atlan-
tic area. 
Sec. 4. definitions.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. 
MANCHIN, Mr. PORTMAN, Ms. 
SINEMA, Mr. ROMNEY, Mrs. SHA-
HEEN, 
Ms. 
MURKOWSKI, 
Mr. 
WARNER, Mr. TILLIS, Mr. MUR-
PHY, Mrs. CAPITO, Mr. CARDIN, 
Mr. YOUNG, Mr. COONS, Mr. 
SASSE, and Mr. GRAHAM): 
S. 4573. A bill to amend title 3, United 
States Code, to reform the Electoral Count 
Act, and to amend the Presidential Transi-
tion Act of 1963 to provide clear guidelines 
for when and to whom resources are provided 
by the Administrator of General Services for 
use in connection with the preparations for 
the assumption of official duties as President 
or Vice President; to the Committee on 
Rules and Administration. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. 
MANCHIN, Mr. PORTMAN, Ms. 
SINEMA, Mr. ROMNEY, Mrs. SHA-
HEEN, 
Ms. 
MURKOWSKI, 
Mr. 
WARNER, Mr. TILLIS, Mr. MUR-
PHY, 
Mr. 
CARDIN, 
and 
Mr. 
COONS): 
S. 4574. A bill to amend title 18, 
United States Code, to increase pen-
alties for crimes against Federally pro-
tected activities relating to voting and 
the conduct of elections, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Home-
land Security and Governmental Af-
fairs. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to acknowledge the months of bi-
partisan hard work that have gone into 
two bills that we are filing today: the 
Electoral Count Reform and Presi-
dential Transition Improvement Act—I 
repeat—the Electoral Count Reform 
and Presidential Transition Improve-
ment Act—and the Enhanced Election 
Security and Protection Act. 
I would like to commend my dear 
friend Senator SUSAN COLLINS for her 
leadership throughout this process. She 
has been shepherding this through and 
working diligently, as only she can do, 
and she does it so well. 
We started these discussions back in 
January, when partisanship around 
here was at a fever pitch, a toxic envi-
ronment that was absolutely not con-
ducive to things that needed to be 
done. But for those who may not re-
member, we were in the middle of a 
heated debate over voting rights with 
both 
sides—Democrats 
and 
Repub-
licans—equally dug in on their posi-
tions, and it was kind of hard to move 
people off of that. 
The insurrection January 6 and the 
situation that has been going on since 
1887 and should have been corrected 
and had not been—but no one ever felt 
that we would have what we had. So 
now, we needed to take care of it. And 
everyone stepped to the plate. 
By January 19, my Democratic col-
leagues were so frustrated that they 
forced a vote on repealing the fili-
buster to allow that bill to pass with a 
simple majority, along party lines. It 
appeared to many, both inside and out-
side of Washington, DC, that the Sen-
ate was fundamentally broken. But 
Senator COLLINS and I have worked to-
gether for a long time, and we never 
gave up. We were not convinced it was 
broken, and you just have to work a 
little bit harder. 
They call us the most deliberative 
body. Well, to deliberate means to 
talk, to converse; and when that fails, 
then, basically, the deliberative body is 
no longer the deliberative body. And 
we were not going to let that happen to 
us. 
We asked our colleagues and friends 
to come together to start trying to see 
if we could work together and find a 
pathway and find common ground. 
Well—guess what—they did. So I am 
here to thank those who sat down: Sen-
ator PORTMAN, ROB PORTMAN; we had 
Senator MURPHY; we had Senator ROM-
NEY, Senator SHAHEEN, Senator MUR-
KOWSKI, 
Senator 
WARREN, 
Senator 
TILLIS, Senator SINEMA, Senator CAP-
ITO, Senator CARDIN, Senator YOUNG, 
Senator COONS, Senator SASSE, and 
Senator GRAHAM. 
Now, that was truly a team effort 
when you think about it. And this has 
gone on for quite some time. 
What we learned through those dis-
cussions was that there was bipartisan 
support for some important, common-
sense reforms that would help restore 
Americans’ faith in our democracy and 
how we basically apply our democracy, 
how do we select our representative 
form of government. Specifically, most 
of our group felt that we could and that 
we should: 
Reform the Electoral Count Act to 
remove the ambiguity that we saw 
weaponized after the last election. We 
were all in agreement. 
Enhance the protections for local 
election officials who were facing un-
precedented threats and intimidations. 
These are people who volunteer, most 
basically. And it is basically a family 
handing down generation after genera-
tion, people who always believe that 
their civic duty is to be able to perform 
during election times. 
We wanted to establish best practices 
for the U.S. Postal Service to improve 
the handling of mail-in ballots. Mail-in 
ballots have been so convenient to 
older people, shut-ins. And in the situa-
tion where we had this pandemic, my 
goodness, it was the only way that peo-
ple could vote. 
So reauthorize the Election Assist-
ance Commission to help States im-
prove the administration and the secu-
rity of Federal elections. 
The most important thing that we 
can do is that when that vote is cast 
and that vote is counted accurately, it 
has to be counted and reported accu-
rately. And that is what we have to do 
and make sure that there is not even a 
shred of a thought where a person 
might think that count is not valid—it 
is not a valid count. And we have done 
everything we possibly can to make 
sure that we have cleared that up. 
This is not everything that people on 
both sides of that wanted. Some on our 
bipartisan committee wanted a lot 
more, and some didn’t want to basi-
cally interfere with the States’ rights. 
So we were caught in betwixt and be-
tween. We worked back and forth on 
different things we could. We tried to 
put the guardrails on that gave guid-
ance, and we think that we came up 
with a piece of legislation. 
And when you have every Member I 
just mentioned all sign on, with the di-
versity of these memberships—we have 
almost 20; 20 Senators have been in-
volved, coming equally between Demo-
crats and Republicans, and able to 
come to an agreement—this is a bill 
that we should put forward. 
I was proud to be an original sponsor 
of both the Freedom to Vote Act and 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act, and I still believe that 
we can and we must continue working 
to protect every American’s sacred 
right to vote. But we also have an obli-
gation to the American people to do 
the most good that we can right now— 
right now. 
The confusing and antiquated lan-
guage that we have on the books today 
from the 1887 Electoral Count Act is a 
real and present danger to our democ-
racy. We can fix that, and that is ex-
actly what we intend to do. 
The increased threats and attacks we 
are seeing across the country on poll 
workers and election volunteers—we 
can fix that, too. But even more impor-
tant than the policy provisions con-
tained in these two bills is the fact 
that we have Democrats and Repub-
licans standing arm in arm proposing 
commonsense election reforms that 
can begin to restore Americans’ faith 
in our democracy. That is our solemn 
commitment and promise. 
When Benjamin Franklin was asked 
whether the Constitutional Convention 
had given us a republic or a monarchy, 
he famously replied ‘‘A republic, young 
man, if you can keep it.’’ 
He qualified his answer because he 
understood a democracy is fragile and 
can be lost if we are not careful. And 
while today’s introduction is an impor-
tant step in this process, we do have 
much work yet to do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3545 
July 20, 2022 
I look forward to continuing our bi-
partisan effort to get this bill to the 
President’s desk as quickly as possible 
and signed into law. And our journey 
begins. 
And with that, I would like to yield 
to my dear friend from the great State 
of Maine, Senator SUSAN COLLINS. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to join my close friend and dear 
colleague Senator MANCHIN in intro-
ducing bipartisan legislation to reform 
the archaic and ambiguous Electoral 
Count Act of 1887, the important law 
that governs how Congress tallies each 
State’s electoral votes for President 
and Vice President. 
On January 6 of 2017, I was amused to 
learn that I had received one electoral 
vote for Vice President of the United 
States, an office for which I obviously 
was not a candidate. But on January 6, 
2021, I realized that my unearned vote 
from 4 years earlier was really not 
funny at all. Rather, it was an indica-
tion of deep structural problems with 
our system of certifying and counting 
the electoral votes for President and 
Vice 
President. 
These 
unfortunate 
flaws are codified in the 1887 Electoral 
Count Act. 
In four of the past six Presidential 
elections, this process has been abused, 
with Members of both parties raising 
frivolous objections to electoral votes. 
But it took the violent breach of the 
Capitol on January 6 of 2021 to really 
shine a spotlight on the urgent need for 
reform. 
Over the past several months, Sen-
ator MANCHIN and I have worked with a 
terrific, bipartisan group of Senators 
who are united in our determination to 
prevent the flaws in this 135-year-old 
law from being used to undermine fu-
ture Presidential elections. 
I want to express my gratitude to my 
friend Senator MANCHIN and to all the 
members of our bipartisan group for 
their hard work, their constructive 
work, to craft this legislation. Specifi-
cally, 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Senators 
PORTMAN, SINEMA, ROMNEY, SHAHEEN, 
MURKOWSKI, WARNER, TILLIS, MURPHY, 
CAPITO, CARDIN, YOUNG, COONS, and 
SASSE
for their work over several 
months. I also want to thank Senators 
KLOBUCHAR and BLUNT, who head the 
Rules Committee, for their advice and 
counsel throughout this process, and 
Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM for his in-
sights and for joining as a cosponsor. 
The legislation that we are intro-
ducing—the Electoral Count Reform 
and Presidential Transition Improve-
ment Act—will help ensure that elec-
toral votes totaled by Congress accu-
rately reflect each State’s popular vote 
for President and Vice President. 
Our bill includes a number of impor-
tant reforms, but I want to highlight 
just a few. 
First, it reasserts that the constitu-
tional role of the Vice President in 
counting electoral votes is strictly and 
solely ministerial. The idea that any 
Vice President would have the power to 
unilaterally accept or reject or change 
or halt the electoral votes is antithet-
ical to our Constitution and basic 
democratic principles. 
Second, our bill raises the threshold 
to lodge an objection to electors to at 
least one-fifth of the duly chosen and 
sworn members of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the U.S. Senate. Cur-
rently, only a single Member in both 
houses is required to object to an elec-
tor or a slate of electors. 
Third, our legislation will ensure 
that Congress can identify a single, 
conclusive slate of electors by clearly 
identifying a single State official who 
is responsible for certifying a State’s 
electors; requiring Congress to defer to 
the slates of electors submitted by a 
State pursuant to the judgment of 
State or Federal courts; and providing 
aggrieved Presidential candidates with 
an expedited judicial review of Federal 
claims related to a State’s certificate 
of electors. Let me be clear that this 
does not create a new cause of action. 
Instead, it will ensure prompt and effi-
cient adjudication of disputes. 
To help promote the orderly transfer 
of power, our bill also includes clear 
guidelines for when eligible Presi-
dential candidates may receive Federal 
resources to support their transition 
into office. And I want to particularly 
thank Senators PORTMAN, COONS, and 
SASSE for their hard work on those pro-
visions. 
We are also introducing a second 
bill—the Enhanced Election Security 
and Protection Act—to address other 
issues pertaining to the administration 
of elections. In the interest of time, let 
me just quickly note the major provi-
sions of this bill. It would reauthorize 
the Election Assistance Commission 
and require it to conduct additional 
cyber security testing of voting sys-
tems, a concept put forth by Senator 
WARREN. It would improve the Postal 
Service’s handling of election mail. It 
would enhance current penalties for 
violent threats against election work-
ers; and increase the maximum pen-
alties 
for 
tampering 
with 
voting 
records, including certain electronic 
records, that was the work of several 
members, including Senators ROMNEY, 
SHAHEEN, and SINEMA, among others. 
We have before us an historic oppor-
tunity to modernize and strengthen 
our system of certifying and counting 
the electoral votes for President and 
Vice President. January 6 reminded us 
that nothing is more essential to the 
survival of a democracy than the or-
derly transfer of power. 
And there is nothing more essential 
to the orderly transfer of power than 
clear rules for effecting it. I very much 
hope that Congress will seize this op-
portunity to enact these sensible and 
much-needed reforms before the end of 
this Congress. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, while 
my dear friend is here, I want to tell 
her, you know, 6 months ago—we have 
worked on this for 6 months. It started 
in January, and it was 14 Senators who 
came at that time. We just started 
talking, and 14 Senators—with all of 
your support, Mr. President, also—we 
had support from everybody saying 
something had to be done. But as deli-
cate as this was, knowing that some 
might think we are picking on one side 
or the other or supporting or defending 
one side or the other, there was only 
one thing we were concerned about: 
How do we defend this country and the 
Constitution and this wonderful Cap-
itol that we have so this could never 
happen again? 
January 6 is a black mark on the his-
tory of the United States of America. 
And if you want to erase it, you better 
do what we did for 6 months, bringing 
people together to find a pathway for-
ward so that type of opportunity—for 
some looking for an opportunity—to 
degrade our government and our coun-
try and our form of governing our-
selves could never, ever encourage 
them thinking they could do some-
thing here at this Capitol and disrupt 
us. 
When that day happened, the thing I 
was most proud of, we were all down in 
a secured room—and Senator COLLINS 
remembers—and it went on; we didn’t 
know what the extent of this was going 
on. We knew one thing: They didn’t 
come for a friendly visit. But we were 
down there talking; and, all of a sud-
den, someone said: Well, let’s just con-
duct our business down here. Remem-
ber that? And to a T, everybody in that 
room says, No, no, no. They are not 
going to run us out of our body here. 
And we all came back here later that 
night and finished our business. 
What we did—and Senator COLLINS 
has led this admirably—is make sure 
that we are finishing our business. We 
are just starting it now to protect this 
democracy. This form of democracy 
that we have is a representative form 
and the Republic that we are respon-
sible for. And I am just so proud to be 
part of it. And she is my dear friend. 
We worked many, many years to-
gether, and we will continue to. 
But I just want to thank the Senator 
for the hard work—our staffs worked 
together. I am very proud of all our 
staffs that they worked together for 
the betterment of our country. 
So when people think that biparti-
sanship is not capable of happening in 
Washington, I want to say: Watch, we 
have proved them wrong. We have done 
so many things together, and we will 
continue to. Again, I say thank you to 
all those who participated for just 
hanging in there. It took us 6 months 
to get here, but we have just begun. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I, too, 
want to salute all of the members of 
our group who worked so hard over 
many months. As is always the case 
when you delve into a complicated 
issue, it turns out that there are far

more nuances and complexities than 
you would think when you first look at 
the issue. But everyone continued to 
work for the common good to strength-
en the procedures, to update this ar-
chaic and ambiguous law that was 
written in the language of another era. 
And we have accomplished that. And I 
really hope our colleagues will all join 
together and that in the end we can 
have an overwhelming vote. 
Finally, I, too, want to thank our 
staff members for their extraordinary 
work. They worked literally night and 
day to work through the many thorny 
issues and to help bring us together. So 
my thanks not only to the Members 
but to their staffs as well.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 713—RECOG-
NIZING 
RUSSIAN 
ACTIONS 
IN 
UKRAINE AS A GENOCIDE 
Mr. RISCH (for himself, Mr. CARDIN, 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. WICKER, Mrs. 
SHAHEEN, Mr. PORTMAN, and Mr. GRA-
HAM) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 713 
Whereas the Russian Federation’s illegal, 
premeditated, unprovoked, and brutal war 
against Ukraine includes extensive, system-
atic, and flagrant atrocities against the peo-
ple of Ukraine; 
Whereas article II of the Convention on the 
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of 
Genocide (in this preamble referred to as the 
‘‘Genocide Convention’’), adopted and opened 
for signature in 1948 and entered into force in 
1951, defines genocide as ‘‘any of the fol-
lowing acts committed with intent to de-
stroy, in whole or in part, a national, eth-
nical, racial or religious group, as such: (a) 
Killing members of the group; (b) Causing se-
rious bodily or mental harm to members of 
the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the 
group conditions of life calculated to bring 
about its physical destruction in whole or in 
part; (d) Imposing measures intended to pre-
vent births within the group; (e) Forcibly 
transferring children of the group to another 
group’’; 
Whereas, on October 3, 2018, the Senate 
unanimously agreed to Senate Resolution 
435, 115th Congress, which commemorated 
the 85th anniversary of the Holodomor and 
‘‘recognize[d] the findings of the Commission 
on the Ukraine Famine as submitted to Con-
gress on April 22, 1988, including that ‘Joseph 
Stalin and those around him committed 
genocide against the Ukrainians in 1932– 
1933’ ’’; 
Whereas substantial and significant evi-
dence documents widespread, systematic ac-
tions against the Ukrainian people com-
mitted by Russian forces under the direction 
of political leadership of the Russian Federa-
tion that meet one or more of the criteria 
under article II of the Genocide Convention, 
including— 
(1) killing members of the Ukrainian peo-
ple in mass atrocities through deliberate and 
regularized murders of fleeing civilians and 
civilians in passing as well as purposeful tar-
geting of homes, schools, hospitals, shelters, 
and other residential and civilian areas; 
(2) causing serious bodily or mental harm 
to members of the Ukrainian people by 
launching indiscriminate attacks against ci-
vilians and civilian areas, conducting willful 
strikes on humanitarian evacuation cor-
ridors, and employing widespread and sys-
tematic sexual violence against Ukrainian 
civilians, including women, children, and 
men; 
(3) deliberately inflicting upon the Ukrain-
ian people conditions of life calculated to 
bring about their physical destruction in 
whole or in part, including displacement due 
to annihilated villages, towns, and cities left 
devoid of food, water, shelter, electricity, 
and 
other 
basic 
necessities, 
starvation 
caused by the destruction of farmlands and 
agricultural equipment, the placing of Rus-
sian landmines across thousands of acres of 
useable fields, and blocking the delivery of 
humanitarian food aid; 
(4) imposing measures intended to prevent 
births among the Ukrainian people, dem-
onstrated by the Russian military’s expan-
sive and direct targeting of maternity hos-
pitals and other medical facilities and sys-
tematic attacks against residential and ci-
vilian areas as well as humanitarian cor-
ridors intended to deprive Ukrainians of safe 
havens within their own country and the ma-
terial conditions conducive to childrearing; 
and 
(5) forcibly mass transferring millions of 
Ukrainian civilians, hundreds of thousands 
of whom are children, to the Russian Federa-
tion or territories controlled by the Russian 
Federation; 
Whereas the state-level intent of the Rus-
sian Federation in favor of those heinous 
crimes against humanity has been dem-
onstrated through frequent pronouncements 
and other forms of official communication 
denying Ukrainian nationhood and sov-
ereignty, 
including 
President 
Putin’s 
ahistorical claims that Ukraine is part of a 
‘‘single whole’’ Russian nation with ‘‘no his-
torical basis’’ for being an independent coun-
try; 
Whereas some Russian soldiers and bri-
gades accused of committing war crimes in 
Bucha, Ukraine, and elsewhere were re-
warded with medals by President Putin; 
Whereas the Russian state-owned media 
outlet RIA Novosti published the article 
‘‘What Should Russia do with Ukraine’’, 
which outlines ‘‘de-Nazification’’ as meaning 
‘‘de-Ukrainianization’’ or the destruction of 
Ukraine; 
Whereas article I of the Genocide Conven-
tion confirms ‘‘that genocide, whether com-
mitted in time of peace or in time of war, is 
a crime under international law which [the 
Contracting Parties] undertake to prevent 
and to punish’’; and 
Whereas although additional documenta-
tion and analysis of atrocities committed by 
the Russian Federation in Ukraine may be 
needed to punish those responsible, the sub-
stantial and significant documentation al-
ready undertaken, combined with state-
ments showing intent, compel urgent action 
to prevent further acts of genocide: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the Russian Federation for 
committing acts of genocide against the 
Ukrainian people; 
(2) calls on the United States, in coopera-
tion with allies in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization and the European Union, to un-
dertake measures to support the Govern-
ment of Ukraine to prevent further acts of 
Russian genocide against the Ukrainian peo-
ple; and 
(3) supports tribunals and international 
criminal investigations to hold Russian po-
litical leaders and military personnel to ac-
count for a war of aggression, war crimes, 
crimes against humanity, and genocide. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to draw the attention of the Sen-
ate and the American people to a dark 
anniversary on the near horizon. 
On July 24, the world will have seen 
5 full months of the brutal, unjustified, 
and utterly senseless war Russia’s dic-
tator Vladimir Putin has unleashed on 
Ukraine, 
a 
peace-loving 
democracy 
that has never threatened Russia or 
any of its other neighbors. 
It will be 150 days of Mr. Putin and 
his army’s killing and raping Ukrain-
ian women and children; destroying 
homes, hospitals, museums, schools, 
and churches; displacing almost 13 mil-
lion people; and unleashing chaos and 
havoc on the world. The blockage of 
the southern ports of Ukraine has in-
terrupted the vital supply of Ukrainian 
food supplies to a hungry world, wreak-
ing pain and havoc on societies across 
the Middle East, Africa, and South 
Asia. An existing global food security 
crisis has now been severely worsened 
by Russia’s violent assault, as the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee ex-
amined earlier today in a hearing 
where USAID Administrator Samantha 
Power and our permanent representa-
tive to the United Nations, Ambas-
sador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, testi-
fied. They spoke about the U.S. role in 
trying to avert this additional global 
tragedy resulting from Russia’s aggres-
sion and the immensity of the task 
ahead. 
Who could forget the horrors of 
Bucha and Irpin, the shell-shocked 
look in the eyes of Ukrainian children 
who will forever carry the burdens of 
unimaginable trauma or the Ukrainian 
women who had to be carried from a 
maternity ward after the Russians 
struck their hospital with a cruise mis-
sile. 
This is an everyday reality now for 
Ukrainians—unspeakable, cruel mili-
tary assaults. Yet they demonstrate 
the indomitable will to fight for their 
land and freedom; they do not give up; 
and they are truly an inspiration for 
the rest of the world. 
When Mr. Putin started this attack, 
he assumed Russia would conquer 
Ukraine and seize its capital in 3 days. 
Yet it is now day almost 150, and Rus-
sia has suffered heavy losses and re-
treated from Kyiv. While several towns 
in the south of the country have been 
flattened and then occupied, in most of 
the country, the Russian invaders have 
barely advanced from their initial posi-
tions. 
In the towns and cities the Russians 
occupy, they have met heavy resist-
ance from Ukrainian guerillas and reg-
ular citizens who do not want to be 
part of Putin’s evil empire. Despite ef-
forts to indoctrinate Ukrainian chil-
dren in occupied areas with a counter-
factual narrative of the contemporary 
history, Russian speakers are learning 
Ukrainian, and what have been gen-
erally positive relations with the peo-
ple of Ukraine and Russia before this 
invasion have now been completely de-
stroyed. 
Independent analysts have described 
the ongoing violence as a genocide in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

July 20, 2022 
Ukraine, and there is a growing body of 
evidence that it is, sadly, true. A May 
of 2022 study conducted by the New 
Lines 
Institute 
and 
the 
Raoul 
Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights 
concluded that ‘‘Russia bears State re-
sponsibility for breaches of Article II 
and Article III of the Genocide Conven-
tion.’’ 
The report pointed to a pattern of 
Russian forces targeting the Ukrainian 
civilians, with evidence of mass execu-
tions and torture of civilians in Rus-
sian-occupied regions. The report in-
cluded evidence of deliberate attacks 
on shelters, evacuation routes, and hu-
manitarian corridors, as well as reports 
of sexual violence and forcible deporta-
tion of Ukrainians to Russia. 
On July 14, the United States and 44 
other nations signed an International 
Criminal Court declaration to inves-
tigate over 20,000 reports—20,000 re-
ports—of war crimes committed by 
Russia in Ukraine since the beginning 
of the war. 
Make no mistake about it, Vladimir 
Putin has caused the suffering and pain 
in pursuit of his ambition to rebuild 
the Russian Empire. He has said it to 
himself on multiple occasions. He is 
hell-bent on destroying the post-World 
War II world order that has brought 
prosperity and peace to our allies in 
Europe—and to Russia to this point, 
too. 
Therefore, it is not an exaggeration 
to say that the Ukrainians are fighting 
not just for their land and freedom, 
which, as Americans, we should cherish 
and appreciate, but also for the very 
core of the global order that, if de-
stroyed, will marginalize our allies and 
threaten the United States. 
With this in mind, we must remem-
ber that supporting Ukraine is not 
charity. It is in our core national secu-
rity interest to provide the Ukrainians 
with the arms, financing, and moral 
support to defeat the tyrant of Russia. 
If Ukraine falls, it will lead to the sub-
jugation of Ukrainian people, destruc-
tion of its culture and language, and 
bring a hostile and expansionistic Rus-
sian Empire right to the borders of our 
NATO allies that we are committed to 
protect with our troops and weapons. 
Ukraine is the firewall that the world 
cannot afford to see breached. 
So, yes, it is a moral imperative for 
us to support Ukrainians in this just 
war, but it is also a core national secu-
rity necessity for us to do this. 
Ukraine is fighting this war on mul-
tiple fronts: on land and at sea and in 
the air. The security of the Black Sea 
region is a critical aspect of this war 
that has not received enough atten-
tion. As recent reporting suggests, the 
ability of the Ukrainians’ vessels to 
navigate the Black Sea is important 
for the country but also for regional 
stability and global food security. That 
is where Ukraine exports most of its 
agricultural products. Ukraine is a 
major grain exporter, and the Russians 
have been blocking these vessels from 
departing Ukrainian ports. This ex-
poses some of the world’s most vulner-
able people to food scarcity, malnutri-
tion, and worsening poverty—and in 
some cases leading to unnecessary and 
preventable deaths. Truly, the ugliness 
and depravation of the Putin regime 
has no limit. 
It is in this context the U.S. Commis-
sion on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe that I chair conducted a field 
hearing on Black Sea security in 
Constanta, Romania, on July 1. I want 
to thank my friend Senator WICKER for 
chairing that hearing. The Commission 
brought together key decisionmakers 
from the Black Sea states to discuss 
how best to address Russia’s illegal 
naval blockade of Ukrainian ports. 
Subsequently, Senator WICKER and I 
joined Senators SHAHEEN and ROMNEY 
in introducing the Black Sea Security 
Act, S. 4509. This bill would declare 
that it is the policy of the United 
States ‘‘to actively deter the threat of 
further Russian escalation in the Black 
Sea region and defend freedom of navi-
gation in the Black Sea to prevent the 
spread of further armed conflict in Eu-
rope.’’ 
The bill further requires that the Na-
tional Security Council shall deliver to 
Congress an interagency report that 
outlines current policy options toward 
Black Sea countries and the border re-
gion. The report would include a break-
down of funding to support these ef-
forts, including military assistance; 
economic assistance, including support 
for food security; countering Russia’s 
disinformation and propaganda; energy 
diversification; increasing access to 
global capital markets; a plan for help-
ing U.S. allies in the region to accel-
erate their transitions from legacy 
Russian military equipment and pro-
mote 
NATO 
interoperability; 
and 
strengthening the rule of law and 
anticorruption efforts. 
I call on my colleagues to support 
this important piece of legislation. 
Tragically, this war is turning into a 
marathon, and it is incumbent upon us 
not to lose our focus and determination 
in supporting our Ukrainian partners. I 
want to urge my colleagues in this 
Chamber and all my fellow Americans 
to stay the course and continue to sup-
port Ukraine for as long as it takes. 
My final point today is that we 
should say the name of what Russia is 
doing, the atrocities they are commit-
ting. Russia is committing genocide in 
Ukraine. Russia is trying to eviscerate 
not just the people and the buildings of 
Ukraine; they are trying to eliminate 
the Ukrainian language, Ukrainian his-
tory, and Ukrainian culture. That is 
genocide. 
That is why I am joining Senator 
RISCH, along with Senators GRAHAM, 
BLUMENTHAL, SHAHEEN, and PORTMAN 
in introducing a resolution that would 
condemn the Russian Federation for 
committing acts of genocide against 
the Ukrainian people; call on the 
United States, in cooperation with al-
lies in the North Atlantic Treaty Orga-
nization and the European Union, to 
undertake measures to support the 
Government of Ukraine to prevent fur-
ther acts of Russian genocide against 
the Ukrainian people; and support tri-
bunals and international criminal in-
vestigations to hold Russian political 
leaders and military personnel to ac-
count for a war of aggression, war 
crimes, crimes against humanity, and 
genocide. 
We must stand shoulder to shoulder 
with the Ukrainians to lighten their 
load and hasten their victory. We must 
be prepared for the reconstruction of 
Ukraine that will follow the conclusion 
of this war. And, yes, we must pursue 
accountability for those responsible for 
the genocide underway in Ukraine by 
the Russian Federation.

S. RES. 714 
Whereas, in enacting the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et 
seq.), Congress recognized that ‘‘historically, 
society has tended to isolate and segregate 
individuals with disabilities, and, despite 
some improvements, such forms of discrimi-
nation against individuals with disabilities 
continue to be a serious and pervasive social 
problem’’; 
Whereas the Americans with Disabilities 
Act of 1990 recognizes the rights of individ-
uals with disabilities to fully participate in 
their communities through independent liv-
ing, equality of opportunity, and economic 
self-sufficiency; 
Whereas 32 years after the date of the en-
actment of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act of 1990 and 23 years after the date of the 
decision of the Supreme Court of the United 
States in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), 
many individuals with disabilities continue 
to live in segregated institutional settings 
because of a lack of support services; 
Whereas the continuation of segregated in-
stitutional settings has hindered the inclu-
sion of individuals with disabilities in com-
munities, schools, and workplaces, under-
mining the promise of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990;

July 20, 2022 
Whereas individuals with disabilities living 
in institutional and long-term care settings 
have endured disproportionate rates of infec-
tion and death during the COVID–19 pan-
demic; 
Whereas individuals of color with disabil-
ities have been disparately affected by the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas individuals of color with disabil-
ities experience disproportionately greater 
barriers to high quality and accessible 
healthcare, education, and employment op-
portunities, infringing on their right to fully 
participate in their communities under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; and 
Whereas 32 years after the date of the en-
actment of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act of 1990— 
(1) women with disabilities continue to 
regularly 
face 
barriers 
to 
reproductive 
healthcare, including inaccessible and in-
equitable services; 
(2) individuals with disabilities continue to 
face higher rates of unemployment and bar-
riers to accessible workplaces and lack equi-
table access to competitive integrated em-
ployment opportunities; 
(3) nearly a quarter of the population of in-
dividuals with disabilities live below the 
poverty line; 
(4) some telecommunication, electronic, 
and information technologies continue to be 
developed without the goal of making those 
technologies fully accessible for all people of 
the United States; and 
(5) many businesses, public and private or-
ganizations, transportation systems, and 
services remain inaccessible to many indi-
viduals with disabilities: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the importance of inde-
pendent living for individuals with disabil-
ities made possible by the enactment of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 
U.S.C. 12101 et seq.); 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to celebrate the advancement of in-
clusion and equality of opportunity made 
possible by the enactment of the Americans 
with Disabilities Act of 1990; 
(3) pledges to continue to work on a bipar-
tisan basis to identify and address the re-
maining barriers that undermine the na-
tional goals of equality of opportunity, inde-
pendent living, economic self-sufficiency, 
and full participation for individuals with 
disabilities, including by focusing on individ-
uals with disabilities that remain segregated 
in institutions; 
(4) pledges to work with States to improve 
access to home and community based serv-
ices for individuals with disabilities; 
(5) calls on the Department of Labor to de-
velop policies and practices and provide 
technical assistance that enable individuals 
with disabilities to become economically 
self-sufficient; 
(6) calls on the Department of Health and 
Human Services to provide information, re-
sources, and technical assistance related to 
home and community based services and to 
enable individuals with disabilities to live 
independently; 
(7) calls on the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development to provide accessible 
and inclusive homes and communities that 
increase the options available for accessible, 
inclusive, and equitable housing for individ-
uals with disabilities; and 
(8) calls on the Department of Transpor-
tation to create accessible transit and air-
ports and increase the hiring, promotion, 
and retention of individuals with disabilities 
in the transportation workforce.

TITLE I—GENERAL PROVISIONS 
SEC. 101. SCOPE OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES. 
(a) FLOOD AND COASTAL STORM RISK MAN-
AGEMENT.—In carrying out a feasibility 
study for a project for flood or coastal storm 
risk management, the Secretary, at the re-
quest of the non-Federal interest for the 
study, shall formulate alternatives to maxi-
mize net benefits from the reduction of the 
comprehensive flood risk that is identified 
through a holistic evaluation of the isolated 
and compound effects of— 
(1) a riverine discharge of any magnitude 
or frequency; 
(2) inundation, wave attack, and erosion 
coinciding with a hurricane or coastal storm; 
(3) a tide of any magnitude or frequency; 
(4) a rainfall event of any magnitude or fre-
quency; 
(5) seasonal variation in water levels; 
(6) groundwater emergence; 
(7) sea level rise; 
(8) subsidence; or 
(9) any other driver of flood risk affecting 
the study area. 
(b) WATER SUPPLY, WATER SUPPLY CON-
SERVATION, AND DROUGHT RISK REDUCTION.— 
In carrying out a feasibility study for any 
purpose, the Secretary, at the request of the 
non-Federal interest for the study, shall for-
mulate alternatives— 
(1) to maximize combined net benefits for 
the primary purpose of the study and for 
water supply, water supply conservation, and 
drought risk reduction; or 
(2) to include 1 or more measures for the 
purpose of water supply, water supply con-
servation, or drought risk reduction. 
(c) COST SHARING.—All costs to carry out a 
feasibility study in accordance with this sec-
tion shall be shared in accordance with the 
cost share requirements otherwise applicable 
to the study. 
SEC. 102. SHORELINE AND RIVERBANK PROTEC-
TION AND RESTORATION MISSION. 
(a) DECLARATION OF POLICY.—Congress de-
clares that— 
(1) consistent with the civil works mission 
of the Corps of Engineers, it is the policy of 
the United States to protect and restore the 
shorelines, riverbanks, and streambanks of 
the United States from the damaging im-
pacts of extreme weather events and other 
factors contributing to the vulnerability of 
coastal and riverine communities and eco-
systems; 
(2) the Chief of Engineers shall give pri-
ority consideration to the protection and 
restoration of shorelines, riverbanks, and 
streambanks from erosion and other dam-
aging impacts of extreme weather events in 
carrying out the civil works mission of the 
Corps of Engineers; 
(3) to the maximum extent practicable, 
projects and measures for the protection and 
restoration of shorelines, riverbanks, and 
streambanks shall be formulated to increase 
the resilience of such shores and banks from 
the damaging impacts of extreme weather 
events and other factors contributing to the 
vulnerability of coastal and riverine commu-
nities and ecosystems using measures de-
scribed in section 1184(a) of the Water Re-
sources Development Act of 2016 (33 U.S.C. 
2289a(a)); and 
(4) to the maximum extent practicable, 
periodic nourishment shall be provided, in 
accordance with subsection (c) of the first 
section of the Act of August 13, 1946 (60 Stat. 
1056, chapter 960; 33 U.S.C. 426e(c)), and sub-
ject to section 156 of the Water Resources 
Development Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 1962d–5f), 
for projects and measures carried out for the 
purpose of restoring and increasing the resil-
ience of ecosystems to the same extent as 
periodic nourishment is provided for projects 
and measures carried out for the purpose of 
coastal storm risk management.

changing treatments by including Schedule I 
substances that have completed phase 1 clin-
ical studies in the Right to Try Act. 
Oregon has a long legacy of ensuring that 
end-of-life patients have access to the full 
spectrum of treatment options to alleviate their 
condition and improve their quality of life. Pa-
tients and doctors deserve to discuss treat-
ments—including psilocybin—that researchers 
find provide immediate and sustained relief 
from pain, anxiety, and depression for people 
battling terminal illness. 
Federal restrictions have obstructed access 
to end-of-life care for too long, this legislation 
will change that and ensure that all patients 
have the Right to Try. 
The psychedelics laws in this country are 
broken, including our laws governing patients’ 
access to new and promising end-of-life care. 
Forty-one state legislations have passed Right 
to Try laws, in addition to our federal Right to 
Try statute, to allow terminally ill patients ac-
cess to treatments, including psilocybin, that 
are 
still 
in 
investigational 
stages. 
Both 
psilocybin and MDMA have demonstrated tre-
mendous care potential in phase 1 and phase 
2 clinical trials. 
The Drug Enforcement Agency, however, 
has refused to accommodate Right to Try 
laws, denying terminally ill patients their free-
dom to elect their preferred treatments. These 
patients deserve to be able to discuss and 
pursue treatments with their doctors that re-
searchers are finding provide immediate, sub-
stantial, and sustained relief from anxiety and 
depression for people battling terminal illness. 
That is why the Right to Try Clarification Act 
is necessary to ensure patients have the Right 
to Try these treatment options. 
I look forward to working with Senators 
CORY BOOKER and RAND PAUL and my co- 
leads Representatives NANCY MACE, MADELINE 
DEAN, ANDY BIGGS, and LUIS CORREA to enact 
this legislation and clarify and strengthen the 
Right to Try.

CELEBRATING YELLOWSTONE NA-
TIONAL PARK’S 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
HON. MATTHEW M. ROSENDALE, SR. 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 150th anniversary of 
Yellowstone National Park. 
Signed into law in 1872 by President Ulys-
ses S. Grant, Yellowstone became the first na-
tional park in the world. 
As the largest intact ecosystem in North 
America, Yellowstone is home to a few endan-
gered animals, and over 1,700 species of 
trees. 
Montana is the ‘‘Gateway to Yellowstone’’ 
and welcomes 72 percent of guests into the 
park each year. 
The crown jewel of the West, Yellowstone 
has helped to sustain businesses in Montana 
for decades. 
Flooding at the start of June destroyed 
bridges, roads, and homes around Yellow-
stone’s north entrance in Montana, hurting 
many businesses and families, but Montanans 
have shown their resilience and have bounced 
back stronger than ever before. 
This anniversary is not only a celebration 
but also a reminder of the strength and dedi-
cation Montanans have shown during this dif-
ficult time. 
On behalf of the state of Montana, I would 
like to thank the National Park Service for their 
efforts to protect the environment and commu-
nities that make up the greatest national park 
in the country.

RECOGNIZING ELAINE M. WALSH, 
PH.D 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Elaine 
M. Walsh, Ph.D., for her outstanding commu-
nity advocacy as she departs Manhattan Com-
munity Board 8 (CB8) after a quarter century 
of dedicated leadership and service. 
Dr. Walsh first began her long history of 
community engagement during her time at 
Fordham University’s Graduate School of So-
cial Service, where she earned a Master of 
Social Work. She began her career as a social 
worker in New York City, becoming the direc-
tor of senior citizen crime prevention for the 
New York City Department for the Aging and 
the director of elderly services at the Office of 
Victim Services. 
Dr. Walsh has served as Director of the 
Public Service Scholar Program (PSSP) at 
Hunter College since 1986 after joining the 
university as an Associate Professor of Urban 
Affairs. The PSSP works to improve the city 
by preparing talented undergraduate students 
for careers in the public and non-profit sectors. 
The program also aims to increase represen-
tation of women, minority-group members and 
immigrants in leadership positions. Under Dr. 
Walsh’s supervision, over 700 of the pro-
gram’s scholars have contributed more than 
500,000 hours in service to communities 
throughout New York City. 
Dr. Walsh served as a member of CB8 for 
25 years and co-chaired the CB8 Zoning and 
Development Committee. During her tenure, 
Dr. Walsh was a constant advocate for her 
community, particularly in regard to environ-
mental concerns and infrastructure. During her 
time as a member, Dr. Walsh worked to sup-
port policies and programs that increased ac-
cessibility to city services for both businesses 
and individuals and served as the conscience 
of the Board in her consistent, forceful advo-
cacy for the needs of under privileged New 
Yorkers. 
Dr. Walsh serves as President of the East 
86th Street Association, which she helped to 
establish in 2004. The Association seeks to 
‘‘improve the quality of life along the East 86th 
Street corridor by conducting research, edu-
cation, and advocacy projects’’ while facili-
tating community dialogue to encourage civic 
participation and foster neighborhood pride. 
Under the leadership of Dr. Walsh, the East 
86th Street Association has worked on many 
projects which have greatly improved resi-
dents’ quality of life. 
Dr. Walsh has previously received awards 
including the New York City Chapter’s ‘‘NASW 
Leadership Award’’, the NYC Public Advocate 
‘‘Advocate’s Award’’, Fordham University’s 
‘‘Alumni Award’’, the Manhattan Borough 
President’s ‘‘Women’s Leadership Award’’, the 
NYC Comptroller’s Award ‘‘Outstanding Irish 
Educator in Social Policy and Leadership’’, the 
Our Town newspaper’s OTTY award for her 
continued leadership and advocacy in the East 
86th Street Association, and was named one 
of the 2013 New York State Senate’s ‘‘Women 
of Distinction’’. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the accomplishments and 
contributions of Dr. Elaine M. Walsh. Her dedi-
cation and leadership have helped cultivate a 
better, more lively community for the residents 
of Roosevelt Island and Manhattan’s Upper 
East Side. Dr. Walsh’s service and commit-
ment to improving the lives of New Yorkers 
will leave a lasting impact on her community 
and our city.

RECOGNIZING THE RESILIENCE OF 
THE PEOPLE, CULTURE, LAND, 
AND WATER OF NEW MEXICO 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNANDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, as we mark National Latino Conservation 
Week, I rise to celebrate the resiliency of the 
people of Las Vegas, Mora, and the sur-
rounding New Mexico communities. Since 
April, the Forest Service-caused Hermit’s Peak 
Fire and Calf Canyon Fire has ravaged the 
area. I am proud to join my resilient commu-
nity to celebrate our combined strength and 
capacity to recover during challenging times. 
The Hispano heritage of this area is a strength 
we will rely on to heal. 
Now in its fourth month, the fire has burned 
over 340,000 acres and become the biggest

wildfire in New Mexico’s history. It forced thou-
sands of New Mexicans to evacuate and 
burned hundreds of homes and structures. 
Make no mistake, the negligence of the U.S. 
Forest Service caused this fire, and the fed-
eral government bears responsibility for the 
cost and the damage. I thank my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle for their support of 
my legislation to fully compensate affected 
residents and businesses, which passed 
through the House last week. 
After the fire ignited, hurricane-force winds 
and an historic drought enabled the wildfire to 
strengthen and spread dangerously quickly. It 
destroyed places where I, and so many others 
like me, grew up and explored; places where 
we gathered wood and tended to our 
acequias; places where we buried loved ones 
and practiced our faith; places where we 
raised our children; places where we hunted 
and fished; and places of cherished memories. 
Yet, my hometown of Las Vegas and the com-
munities in Mora and San Miguel counties, 
and our other dear neighbors continue to per-
severe 
despite 
devastating 
destruction. 
Hispano, together with Indigenous and Anglo 
families, have been stewards and conserva-
tionists of these lands for centuries, and they 
will not give up on their lands now. 
There is one common thread among the 
countless people I’ve talked to and their sto-
ries of loss and heartache: resiliency. Resi-
dents bravely defended their land, honoring 
shared ancestors. Families and neighbors 
from across the community opened their doors 
to one another in a beautiful, shared sense of 
New Mexico community. Firefighters and first 
responders risked their lives to save others. 
We honor their sacrifice along with those who 
donated their time, resources, and money to 
help those forced from their homes. 
Our land, water, culture, and communities 
will endure despite the catastrophic wildfires 
and ongoing floods. Our faith in each other re-
mains unbroken. Our traditions remain unbro-
ken. We remain unbroken. 
I draw strength and determination from our 
shared commitment to protect the natural, cul-
tural, and recreational resources that make 
these areas so beautiful. We will Rise from the 
Ashes and, as we have done for generations, 
continue to fight for what we love.

HONORING VITA SWARERS 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor Vita Swarers on the occasion of her 
birthday, July 24th. Vita serves as the Deputy 
Director of Casework and the Deputy District 
Director in my Conroe district office, and she 
has spent the past 15 years serving the peo-
ple of the Eighth Congressional District of 
Texas. 
Vita started working for me as a caseworker 
in January of 2008 when my district office was 
originally in Orange, Texas. Vita has always 
been a devoted member of my team and I 
have experienced the depth of her commit-
ment firsthand. Following the last redistricting 
of Texas in 2010, Vita chose to relocate her 
home from Orange to Huntsville in order to 
continue her work in my new district office. 
When Hurricane Ike struck the 8th District, 
Vita’s own home was flooded but she helped 
countless victims’ recover first. Thousands of 
Texans’ lives have been improved because of 
Vita’s tireless efforts on behalf of the commu-
nity. 
In addition to her amazing casework suc-
cess, Vita also directs our Military Service 
Academy Program which, because of the aca-
demic and athletic accomplishments of our 
prospective cadets, typically sends 15 or more 
cadets to the four service academies. The 
staff of the academy admission offices refer to 
the program Vita spearheads as a ‘‘model pro-
gram’’ and Vita frequently consults with new 
Congressional offices on how to set up and 
run a successful program. 
Outside of the office, Vita is a natural care-
giver, loves serving others, and gives her all in 
every aspect of her life. Vita is the type of per-
son who can overcome anything—when life 
gives her lemons, she throws them right 
back—very hard. Vita is a devoted mother to 
three, grandmother to seven, and great-grand-
mother to four. She loves her family deeply 
and says that one of her goals in life is to live 
long enough to meet her greatgreat-grand-
children. 
One of Vita’s favorite ways to spend time 
with her family is to compete in local competi-
tions. Vita is a well-decorated Texas cham-
pion—holding first place trophies throughout 
Texas for her famous chili. 
On behalf of the Eighth Congressional Dis-
trict of Texas, it is a pleasure to formally rec-
ognize Vita for her long years of dedicated 
service and the instrumental role she has 
played on behalf of the constituents of the 8th 
District of Texas. It is an honor to work with 
someone as special as Vita, and I am grateful 
for her service. I thank Vita for everything, and 
wish her a Happy Birthday.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
CORPORAL FOYID MOCKBIL 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Corporal Foyid Mockbil of 
Howell, Michigan on the occasion of his retire-
ment from Dearborn Police Department. His 
25 years of service to the Dearborn commu-
nity are worthy of commendation. 
A graduate of Fordson High School, Cor-
poral Mockbil was the first Yemeni American 
hired at the Dearborn Police Department, join-
ing the team in 1997. Throughout his career, 
he has held various positions in the depart-
ment including in Patrol Operations, Field 
Training, and on the SWAT Team as an oper-
ator. Additionally, he has served as an Honor 
Guard Member, School Resource Officer and 
as a plainclothes officer. At the time of his re-
tirement, he was serving as Senior Officer of 
the Patrol Division on the night shift. 
From the halls of Dearborn’s elementary 
schools to events throughout the community, 
Corporal Mockbil is a familiar face to genera-
tions of Dearborn residents. Known for his 
bravery, professionalism, and compassion, he 
was active in the ACCESS substance abuse 
program and a frequent volunteer at charity 
events all over Metro Detroit. A friend to all 
and a mentor to his peers, Corporal Mockbil 
has been a great representative of the depart-
ment for almost 3 decades. All who have the 
pleasure of knowing him can attest to his in-
fectious energy and joy. Despite being an offi-
cer, he never misses a chance to have fun 
and make memories. Corporal Mockbil resides 
in Howell, Michigan with his wife Marcie and 
their daughters Elayna and Elissa. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in congratulating Corporal Foyid 
Mockbil for his exemplary career at the Dear-
born Police Department. I join with Corporal 
Mockbil’s family, friends, and colleagues in ex-
tending my gratitude to him for his honorable 
service and thank him for his role in protecting 
our community and the people of Dearborn for 
over 2 decades. We wish him the best in re-
tirement and lots of time spent with friends 
and family.

HONORING RODRIGO ‘‘ROD’’ 
GARCIA 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Rodrigo ‘‘Rod’’ Garcia, who 
passed away on July 2, 2022. Rod was a re-
spected 
visionary, 
leader, 
and 
advocate 
whose incredible life was defined by his dedi-
cation to empowering the Hispanic community 
to achieve educational excellence, economic 
opportunity, and social equity. 
Rod Garcia was born in East Los Angeles, 
California in 1943. He graduated from Cali-
fornia State University, Los Angeles with a 
bachelor’s degree of science in engineering 
and also obtained an associate degree in en-
gineering from East Los Angeles College, 
launching a lifelong career in the Science, 
Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) 
field. Rod subsequently served as a civil engi-
neer for the City of Los Angeles and worked 
for the Port of Los Angeles in Public Works, 
Building and Safety. Due to his expertise in 
the field of engineering and his leadership 
abilities, Rod went on to chair the City of Mon-
terey Park’s Planning Commission as well as 
serving on the Dean of Engineering’s Advisory 
Board for his alma mater, California State Uni-
versity, Los Angeles. Rod also served as 
president of Century Diversified, Inc., an engi-
neering and construction firm, for over thirty 
years. 
Rod was one of the few Hispanic engineers 
amidst a tech boom in California in 1973 and 
despite being in the minority in the STEM 
field, he gathered a cohort of fellow Hispanic 
engineers determined to contribute and diver-
sify the sector. That’s why, in 1974, Rod 
founded the Society of Hispanic Professional 
Engineers (SHPE) with the mission of ensur-
ing networking and education opportunities for 
Hispanic students and professionals in the 
Southern California region. Shortly thereafter, 
SHPE’s first collegiate chapters were estab-
lished at California State University, Los Ange-
les, East Los Angeles College, and the Uni-
versity of Southern California. For five dec-
ades, Rod’s high-spirited and fearless leader-
ship propelled the SHPE to reach 13,000 
memberships and 286 chapters nationwide. 
His unique ability to unite community partners

and leaders around the country serve as evi-
dence that closing the STEM education gap 
and increasing the number of Hispanics in 
STEM can and will be done. 
Rod will be remembered by his colleagues 
and thousands of current and former SHPE 
students and professionals for his devotion, 
service, mentorship, and immense contribu-
tions to expanding awareness, access, sup-
port, and development opportunities to His-
panics in STEM so that they may realize their 
potential and positively impact the world. His 
legacy of empowering the Hispanic community 
to achieve educational excellence, economic 
opportunity, and social equity will guide many 
members of the Society of Hispanic Profes-
sional Engineers for generations to come. I

rating the life of this extraordinary individual.

HONORING MR. WILLY ELLIOT- 
MCCREA 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the retirement of Mr. Willy Elliot- 
McCrea from the Second Harvest Food Bank 
Santa Cruz County after thirty-three years of 
dedicated service to communities across the 
central coast of California. The Second Har-
vest Food Bank Santa Cruz County was the 
first food bank in California and the second in 
the nation—it was founded in 1972 as an 
emergency food pantry to distribute U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture surplus food as a part 
of the Community Action Board in the City of 
Santa Cruz. 
Mr. Elliott-McCrea began his public service 
career with the Second Harvest Food Bank in 
1979 as the warehouse manager and driver, 
later taking on the responsibility of purchasing 
food. In that same year, he represented Sec-
ond Harvest Food Bank as one of thirteen 
founding members of Feeding America. In 
1988, Mr. Elliott-McCrea was promoted to Ex-
ecutive Director and later to Chief Executive 
Officer in 1993, the position he held until re-
tirement. Shortly after his promotion to Execu-
tive Director, the 6.9 magnitude Loma Prieta 
Earthquake devastated Santa Cruz and sur-
rounding areas in October 1989. The Food 
Bank became ground zero for disaster relief, 
with the number of people served dramatically 
increasing from 15,000 per month to 25,000 
people per week. 
Throughout his time with the Second Har-
vest Foodbank, Mr. Elliott-McCrea helped 
guide statewide policy, championing progress 
in food security resources. He energized the 
Second Harvest Board of Directors to change 
its mission to be more community-focused, 
thus pioneering a new model for food banks 
and inspiring emergency feeding operations 
nationwide. To this day, food bank distribu-
tions operate around a network of community- 
based food pantries in senior residential living 
centers, homeless service centers, schools, 
churches, and neighborhood resource centers. 
Mr. Elliott-McCrea led Second Harvest Food 
Bank through natural disasters, recessions, 
and, most recently, the coronavirus pandemic. 
In 2011, Second Harvest provided an average 
of 6.7 million pounds of fresh fruits and vege-
tables to the Santa Cruz community, but in the 
first year of the pandemic, Second Harvest’s 
operations grew to providing 16.5 million 
pounds of fresh fruit and vegetables. In addi-
tion to his role with Second Harvest, Mr. El-
liott-McCrea also served as the founding presi-
dent of the California Association of Food 
Banks (CAFB) from 1995 to 1998 and again 
from 2019 to 2021. The CAFB ensures its co-
alition of 41-member food banks have the 
tools and resources to focus on feeding com-
munities across California. The Association 
also provides Nutrition Education Programs 
that work with community volunteers to pro-
vide Nutrition Support Groups and Cooking 
Clubs. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing and thanking Willy Elliot-McCrea for his 
decades of service. His leadership and dedi-
cation to public service have shaped the food 
bank community not just in Santa Cruz Coun-
ty, but across the nation. I extend my personal 
appreciation to Mr. Willy Elliot-McCrea and his 
dedication to the central coast of California.

SPEECH OF 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Chair, I want to commend 
the members of the House Committee on Ap-
propriations, specifically the members of the 
Subcommittee on Military Construction, Vet-
eran Affairs, and Related Agencies Fiscal 
Year 2023 Appropriations bill for including ro-
bust funding for Major Projects Construction. 
This funding for the construction, alteration, 
extension, and improvement of any facilities 
within the jurisdiction or use of the Department 
of Veteran Affairs will help all VA hospitals ex-
pand access to health care to veterans. For 
example, the Lake Nona VA Medical Center 
located in my district has grown substantially 
since established in 2006. The Lake Nona VA 
Medical Center serves more than 110,000 vet-
erans in Central Florida and includes a 120- 
bed Community Living Center, two Mental 
Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment 
Programs/Domiciliaries, located at both Lake 
Nona Campus and the Lake Baldwin Campus, 
one Health Care Center in Viera, two large 
multi-specialty Satellite Outpatient Clinics in 
Orlando and Daytona Beach, and four Com-
munity-Based Outpatient Clinics located in 
Clermont, 
Kissimmee, 
Orange 
City, 
and 
Tavares. 
A facility expansion of the Lake Nona VA 
Medical Center would add at least additional 
twenty beds for inpatient mental health care 
and three additional floors for intensive and 
surgical rehabilitation. I am proud of the 
healthcare provided by Lake Nona VA Medical 
Center to veterans in the Central Florida. I be-
lieve Congress should continue to provide the 
resources necessary to allow for expansion 
and improvement of facilities under the juris-
diction of the Department of Veteran Affairs 
and I look forward to continuing to work with 
my colleagues to support this goal.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
SERGEANT TIM STACY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Sergeant Tim Stacy of the 
Dearborn Police Department on the occasion 
of his retirement, His honorable 22 years of 
service to our community is worthy of com-
mendation. 
A graduate of Southgate Anderson High 
School, Schoolcraft College, and Wayne 
County Community College Sergeant Stacy 
began his career in the Dearborn Police De-
partment in 1994 as a reserve police officer. 
After obtaining his criminal justice degree in

worked his way up the ranks becoming cer-
tified in traffic safety and accident investiga-
tions and was promoted to the position of Ser-
geant and Office in Charge of the Police Motor 
Carrier and Ordinance Enforcement Units in 
2015. 
Known for his caring heart and willingness 
to help those in need, Sergeant Stacy has al-
ways looked for new ways to advance profes-
sionally and better serve his community. He 
has frequently attended trainings at the Fed-
eral Law Enforcement Training Center and 
Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. In 
addition to his duties as an officer, he served 
as a community liaison for the department, 
helping improve the lives of his neighbors 
each day. A dedicated officer and known for 
his commitment to improving his community, 
he was awarded the Chiefs Outstanding Serv-
ice Award in 2018. He has always been there 
to help anyone who needed a helping hand. 
He continues to reside in Lincoln Park, Michi-
gan with his wife Maya and is an outstanding 
father to their children Ava, Emma, and Lily. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Sergeant Tim Stacy for a ca-
reer of exemplary service to the Dearborn Po-
lice Department. I join with Sergeant Stacy’s 
family, friends, and colleagues in extending 
my gratitude to him for his decades of honor-
able service. We thank him for serving the 
people of the City of Dearborn for the past 22 
years. We wish him the best in retirement and 
lots of time spent with friends and family as he 
fights cancer. He is a man of honor and brav-
ery—Cancer has never had a more formidable 
opponent.

RECOGNIZING 
AIR 
FORCE 
VET-
ERAN AND FOUNDER OF 2M COM-
PANY, MR. BILL MILLS 
HON. MATTHEW M. ROSENDALE, SR. 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Bill Mills, a United 
States Air Force veteran and founder of 2M 
Company in Montana. 
In 1978, Mr. Mills founded 2M Company in 
Billings, Montana because he was inspired to 
create a water product and service company 
that directly meets the needs of Montana’s 
families and farmers. 
Over the last 30 years, 2M Company has 
done just that—while serving Montanans’ 
water-related needs, it became the leading 
wholesale supplier of pumps and pumping 
systems within Montana’s water industry. 
Along with 2M Company’s business loca-
tions in Montana, it has expanded over the 
years to serve customers in Idaho, Colorado, 
New Mexico, Arizona, Oregon, Washington, 
and Texas. 
The growth and success of 2M Company is 
certainly a testament to Mr. Mills’ exceptional 
entrepreneurial leadership and 2M Company’s 
excellent service, products, and customer-first 
philosophy that Mr. Mills established in its in-
ception. 
Additionally, I also want to thank Mr. Bill 
Mills for his service to his country as part of 
the United States Air Force.

HONORING GLORIETTA ROWLAND 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the retirement of Ms. Glorietta 
Rowland after 33 years of public service to 
Monterey County and her dedication to sup-
porting the Central Coast’s unhoused commu-
nity. Her legacy of service is one of unwaver-
ing devotion to improving the lives of others. 
Ms. Rowland began her career in 1987 with 
Domestic Crisis Services, kicking off her admi-
rable and wide-ranging career. Following her 
departure from the agency in 1988, Ms. Row-
land worked with the Salvation Army, pro-
viding resources to those experiencing home-
lessness. She then worked for Sun Street 
Center, an organization that provides edu-
cational services, as well as treatment and re-
covery opportunities for those battling addic-
tion. 
In 2005, Ms. Rowland joined the Coalition of 
Homeless Services Providers, where she as-
sumed the role of Executive Officer. In this po-
sition, Ms. Rowland created and developed 
many programs and campaigns, including the 
Lead Me Home Ten-Year Plan for Ending 
Homelessness, Monterey County Stand Down 
for Veterans, and the Monterey County Home-
less Connect Project. 
Following her time with the Coalition of 
Homeless Services Providers, Ms. Rowland 
joined Monterey County Department of Social 
Services in 2012 as a Management Analyst in 
the Community Action Partnership and Direc-
tor’s Office. In this role, Ms. Rowland contin-
ued her career-long pattern of developing pro-
grams to support unhoused people in Mon-
terey County. Here, she influenced programs 
like the Monterey County Safe Parking Pro-
gram and was critical in the creation of the 
Salinas Housing Advancement, Resource and 
Education (SHARE) Center. 
At the start of the COVID–19 pandemic, Ms. 
Rowland took the initiative to support our com-
munity’s relief efforts through the Alternate 
Housing Site project. She also dedicated her 
time and talents to the Commission on the 
Status of Women, the Emergency Food and 
Shelter Local Board, the Salinas Downtown 
Community Board, and the Homeless Census 
Point-in-Time Planning Committee. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing Ms. Rowland’s decades of service to 
Monterey County. Her career will serve as a 
model for selflessness and compassion for our 
community. It is therefore fitting and proper 
that we honor her today.

APPROPRIA-
TIONS ACT, 2023 
SPEECH OF 
HON. PATRICK T. McHENRY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Chair, the report accom-
panying the FSGG appropriations bill includes 
‘‘an increase of $6 million above the budget 
request for USPS to carry out pilot programs 
to modernize its current postal banking serv-
ices, including surcharge-free automated teller 
machines, wire transfers, check cashing, and 
bill payment.’’ 
This ‘‘Postal Non-banking Financial Services 
Modernization Pilot Program’’ is yet another 
attempt by progressives in Congress to ex-
pand the U.S. Postal Service’s core mission 
into the financial system. This concept is ulti-
mately harmful to American consumers be-
cause it will crowd out private sector financial 
innovation to reach underserved communities. 
That’s why Rep. LUETKEMEYER and I offered 
an amendment to prohibit funding in this bill 
from being used to carry out the Postal Non- 
banking Financial Services Modernization Pilot 
Program. Unfortunately, our amendment was 
not made in order to the bill we’re considering 
today. 
Democrats have long called for USPS to be 
able to offer consumer banking services such 
as checking and savings accounts and exten-
sions of credit to consumers and small busi-
nesses. These functions are beyond the Post 
Office’s core competencies, will subject tax-
payers to potential losses, will undermine the 
private sector’s ability to compete with tax-
payer-subsidized banking services, and pose 
a threat to consumers’ privacy when it comes 
to financial data. 
In 2018, the previous Administration created 
a special task force to specifically review the 
Post Office and identify necessary reforms. 
The Treasury Department was directed to re-
lease the Task Force’s recommendations, 
which it did in its report, ‘‘United States Postal 
Service: A Sustainable Path Forward.’’ The 
Task Force’s recommendations were clear: 
‘‘given the USPS’s narrow expertise and cap-
ital limitations, USPS should not pursue ex-
panding into new sectors, such as postal 
banking, the USPS does not have a dem-
onstrated competency or comparative advan-
tage, or where balance sheet risk would be 
added.’’ 
Moreover, the Post Office agreed. In re-
sponse to a widely criticized and highly un-
usual report by the United States Postal Serv-
ice Office of Inspector General (OIG), the Post 
Office made clear that despite any rec-
ommendations to the contrary from the OIG, 
the Post Office’s core mission ‘‘is delivery, not 
banking.’’ Postmaster General DeJoy reiter-
ated this position. 
Progressives argue postal banking is need-
ed to address the decreasing number of bank 
branches and the rise in the number of people 
without access to a checking account or short- 
term credit. Democrats automatically believe 
that means that the government should pro-
vide these banking services, including through 
the Post Office. What Democrats fail to ac-
knowledge is financial institution branch clo-
sures and consolidations result from overly 
burdensome government regulation, which 
won’t be reconciled using more government. 
Postal banking has been tried before. From 
1911 to 1967, the United States had the 
‘‘Postal Savings System,’’ run by the USPS’ 
predecessor. The system provided savings ac-
counts with interest rates set by the USPS 
and funds deposited in national banks near 
depositors’ post offices. The system failed. 
Postal banking couldn’t compete with private 
sector banking institutions. It did not have the 
flexibility to meet the needs of customers. 
Moreover, 
American 
consumers 
dem-
onstrated recently that they are not interested 
in banking with the USPS. Just last year, the 
USPS took it upon itself to create a pilot pro-
gram to offer check cashing services in the 
form of gift cards. According to documents 
submitted to the Postal Regulatory Commis-
sion, only six gift cards were issued under the 
pilot program and total fee revenue was 
$35.70. The failure of the pilot program dem-
onstrates the fact that it was not designed in 
response to customer demand and that con-
sumers are not interested in banking with the 
federal government, including USPS. 
Private sector financial institutions are highly 
regulated and operate competitively and flexi-
bly in a market-based system. The ensures

consumers’ demands for innovative financial 
products and services are met, and they re-
ceive the best pricing for them. Congress 
should not stifle private sector innovation by fi-
nancial institutions and fintech firms that have 
already shown promise for reaching under-
banked and rural consumers. 
The USPS should remain focused on its 
core mission. The fact that only six people 
used the postal banking pilot confirms that 
consumers remain supportive of the free mar-
ket and look to private firms for technological 
solutions to meet their banking needs. 
Postal banking is harmful to the financial 
system and ultimately harmful to consumers. It 
will crowd out private sector financial innova-
tion and ultimately fail to reach the very under-
served communities Democrats claim they 
want to reach. 
The USPS should remain focused on its 
core mission, not creeping into the provision of 
consumer financial services.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
DESTINATION 
ANN 
ARBOR 
PRESIDENT 
AND 
CEO 
MARY 
KERR 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ms. Mary Kerr, President 
and CEO of Destination Ann Arbor on the oc-
casion of her retirement. Her honorable 27 
years of dedication to our Washtenaw County 
community are worthy of commendation. 
Ms. Kerr’s service to Washtenaw County 
started even before her time in tourism. Ms. 
Kerr began her career in hospitality as a man-
ager at the historic Haab’s Restaurant in Ypsi-
lanti, Michigan. She served as the Executive 
Director for the Ypsilanti Convention and Visi-
tors Bureau before becoming Executive Direc-
tor for the Ann Arbor Convention and Visitors 
Bureau. Under Ms. Kerr, the Ann Arbor and 
Ypsilanti Convention and Visitors Bureaus 
were merged into one countywide entity, 
bringing together our diverse communities of 
Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti for good. 
During her time at Destination Ann Arbor, 
Ms. Kerr was instrumental in growing the 
budget of the organization. She also oversaw 
the creation of the Ann Arbor Sports Commis-
sion, a ten-year destination master plan for 
Washtenaw County that consists of a strategic 
plan to boost the local economy and other key 
initiatives to ensure Ann Arbor is a destination 
for travelers and locals alike. Outside of work, 
she continues to advocate for the hospitality 
industry through her roles on various boards in 
Washtenaw County. 
Ms. Kerr has been recognized for her dedi-
cated service through various awards, such as 
the Lifetime Achievement Award by Michigan 
Meetings and Events. She was also named 
CVB Star of the Year at the Pure Michigan 
Governor’s Conference on Tourism. Her stellar 
work as an ambassador for our community 
makes her beyond worthy of this recognition. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Ms. Mary Kerr for her 27 years 
of service. As we come together to celebrate 
her retirement, all of us in the Washtenaw 
community reflect on the great work she has 
done that will benefit our area for years to 
come. I join with her family, friends, and col-
leagues in wishing her the very best in her re-
tirement.

HONORING ANDREW PIERCE FOR 
HIS 
SERVICE 
IN 
THE 
PEACE 
CORPS 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Andrew Pierce for his exceptional 
leadership and service as the Acting Chief Fi-
nancial Officer, Deputy Chief Financial Officer 
and Director of Accounting and Financial Re-
porting at the Peace Corps. 
During his nearly 7 years at the Peace 
Corps, Mr. Pierce played a vital role in ensur-
ing resources were effectively and efficiently 
managed to support the important mission of 
the Peace Corps. He provided solutions during 
the beginning of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
when global evacuations of thousands of 
Peace Corps volunteers were necessary. 
Mr. Pierce was instrumental in ensuring that 
the Peace Corps received a clean audit opin-
ion during his entire tenure. This is particularly 
remarkable because of the inherently transient 
nature of the Peace Corps workforce and the 
global footprint of the agency’s financial oper-
ations. He was highly respected by his col-
leagues for his keen intellect, professionalism; 
kindness, dedication to service and being a 
consummate team player. 
President Kennedy said that by establishing 
the Peace Corps, ‘‘[W]e intend to make full 
use of the resources and talents of private in-
stitutions and groups. Universities, voluntary 
agencies, labor unions and industry will be 
asked to share in this effort—contributing di-
verse sources of energy and imagination— 
making it clear that the responsibility for peace 
is the responsibility of our entire society.’’ Mr. 
Pierce answered the call and did his part, ena-
bling the Peace Corps and our nation to 
strengthen bonds of friendship and foster glob-
al peace. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking 
Andrew Pierce for his service and wishing him 
continued success in his role as the Executive 
Director for Budget and Analysis for Maryland.

RECOGNIZING 
MINNESOTA’S 
2022 
SOMALI-AMERICAN 
HERITAGE 
WEEK 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Ms. MCCULLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Minnesota’s vibrant Somali- 
American community and the many cultural, 
economic and social contributions members 
make to our state, and in recognition of So-
mali-American Heritage Week during July 2– 
17 in Saint Paul and Minneapolis. 
The commemoration of Somali Independ-
ence Day is marked by Somali Week celebra-
tions in Minnesota, hosted by Rising Impact, a 
nonprofit dedicated to the safety and success 
of 
Somali-American 
youth 
in 
Minnesota. 
Hosted in locations throughout Saint Paul and 
Minneapolis, the festivities are a chance to 
unite and celebrate Minnesota’s diversity 
through a broad range of artistic, cultural and 
athletic events. 
This year the celebrations drew together 
more than 45,000 participants to enjoy the 
food, music, dance, films, and the history of 
the Somali people and the Somali-Americans 
who call Minnesota home. Some of the most 
notable events from this year’s celebration in-
clude a roundtable discussion with the U.S. 
Ambassador to Somalia, Larry E. Andre´ and 
community members about ongoing humani-
tarian relief efforts and the United States sup-
port for democracy in Somalia, the ‘‘Xasuuso 
(Remember) 1960’’ event which tells the story 
of Somalia’s independence, and the Growth 
Conference, which is a chance for members of 
the African diaspora to share knowledge and 
resources to build up minority-owned busi-
nesses. 
Led by the Somali Week Chairperson, Daud 
Mohamed, the organizers and volunteers for 
Somali Week continue to forge strong ties with 
various community, corporate and government 
partners to bring this vibrant festival to life 
each year. 
Madam Speaker, Minnesota’s Somali com-
munity has added greatly to the fabric of our 
state and our Nation, and they are a promi-
nent part of the diverse community that makes 
Minnesota a great place to call home. Please 
join me in paying tribute to the community 
members who come together each year to cel-
ebrate Somali Week, and who work every day 
to foster, educate, and promote cultural under-
standing and traditions among all Minneso-
tans.

SUPPORTING U.S. NAVY LT. RIDGE 
ALKONIS AND U.S./JAPAN RELA-
TIONS 
HON. AUMUA AMATA COLEMAN 
RADEWAGEN 
OF AMERICAN SAMOA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of U.S. Navy Lieutenant 
Ridge Alkonis, a sailor currently stationed 
abroad in Japan. Essential to the economic 
and political stability of the Pacific region 
around my home of American-Samoa is the 
U.S.-Japan alliance. As a significant part of 
this alliance, the U.S.Navy and Japanese Mar-
itime Self-defense Force jointly project power 
and security throughout the Pacific; and, ena-
bling this naval partnership are the 19,000 
American sailors stationed there. While the 
U.S. and Japanese naval forces have long 
maintained a strong bond, the relationship is 
deteriorating as a result of Japanese injustices 
against U.S. military members. The case of 
U.S. Navy Lieutenant Ridge Alkonis, who is of 
Samoan descent, exemplifies the disparate 
treatment American sailors receive in Japan. 
While driving his wife and three children to get 
ice cream during a family outing one Saturday 
in May 2021, LT. Alkonis suffered a sudden 
and unforeseen medical emergency which re-
sulted in a tragic car accident, causing the

death of two Japanese citizens. When I be-
came aware of this tragedy last year, I imme-
diately conveyed my condolences to Ambas-
sador Tomita and continue to pray for the fam-
ily of those who passed away. At the scene of 
the accident, LT. Alkonis was immediately ar-
rested by Japanese authorities without receiv-
ing any medical care and imprisoned in soli-
tary confinement for 26 days. He was system-
atically deprived of sleep, denied legal counsel 
while undergoing harsh daily interrogations by 
Japanese authorities, and pressured to sign 
false accusations. Financial compensation 
plays an influential role in the Japanese justice 
system, with Japanese citizens possessing 
considerable leverage over foreigners in court. 
LT. Alkonis was advised into signing a $1.65 
million financial settlement, the largest private 
financial settlement ever entered into by a 
U.S. service member in Japan. Despite there 
being no evidence of negligence on his part, 
LT. Alkonis cooperated fully in the investiga-
tion and paid the financial settlement in full; 
nevertheless, he was still sentenced to three 
years in prison. And last month, the Tokyo 
High Court rejected the majority of evidence 
submitted by LT. Alkonis including the Japa-
nese police arrest warrant and a medical diag-
nosis by military physicians. The Court dis-
missed LT. Alkonis’s appeal last week, even 
disregarding the financial settlement—an un-
precedented decision by a Japanese court. 
Many familiar with these proceedings have 
called this situation the most egregious case 
against an American service member by 
Japan in over 60 years. I’m deeply troubled by 
Japan’s treatment of LT. Alkonis. A review of 
the facts clearly shows that LT. Alkonis did not 
fall asleep and was not negligent, that he did 
in fact suffer a medical emergency. While in-
deed a tragedy, this was an accident in every 
sense of the word. Additionally, there have 
been numerous Status of Forces Agreement 
violations and human rights abuses by Japan. 
I have even heard persuasive allegations of il-
licit domestic political interference in LT. 
Alkonis’s court proceedings by the victims’ 
family, which is strongly connected to the 
Tokyo High Court. The treatment of LT. 
Alkonis has been unacceptable and is hurting 
the U.S.-Japan alliance exactly when it needs 
to be strengthened. America cannot allow our 
brave sons and daughters to be so vulnerably 
exposed while serving abroad. I call on Presi-
dent Biden, as well as our Ambassador to 
Japan—Ambassador Emanuel, to bring LT. 
Alkonis home and to immediately work with 
our Japanese partners to ensure that the 
terms of the Status of Forces Agreement are 
immediately reviewed and enforced at every 
level. Now more than ever, we need to ac-
knowledge and correct injustices and take the 
appropriate steps to strengthen this alliance by 
ensuring service members are treated fairly.

HONORING DIANE PORTER COOLEY 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the vibrant life of Diane Porter 
Cooley, a pillar of the Pajaro Valley and Santa 
Cruz County community, who passed away on 
March 10, 2022. 
Born to a family that settled in Santa Cruz 
County in the 1850s, and raised on Las 
Lomas Ranch in Watsonville, Diane had a 
deep connection to the land and people of the 
central coast of California. Her father Tom was 
one of the four founders of Driscoll Berries, 
and Diane continued her involvement with ag-
riculture until her death. Diane and her hus-
band, Don, were active members of the com-
munity, constantly engaged in the issues they 
cared about. 
A deeply passionate civic leader, Diane 
worked tirelessly to protect and preserve the 
environment, and was an outspoken advocate 
for the people of the Pajaro Valley. She once 
said, ‘‘I care for the trees but for humans, too. 
People should have the chance to thrive just 
like the Sequoia should stand tall.’’ 
She was a dynamic agent of change who 
championed the creation of the Elkhorn 
Slough Foundation, the Pajaro Valley Arts 
Council, the Community Foundation of Santa 
Cruz County, and the Land Trust of Santa 
Cruz County. She was involved with the Na-
ture Conservancy, served on the Pajaro Valley 
Water Management Agency board, and was a 
supporter of many other causes, including 
Pajaro Valley Shelter Services, Salud Para la 
Gente, the University of California, Santa 
Cruz, Cabrillo College, and Second Harvest 
Food Bank in Watsonville. We may never 
know just how many lives she touched, or how 
many people received an education, braces, 
medical care, a home, or love when they 
needed it most thanks to her. 
Madam Speaker, Diane Porter Cooley’s out-
reach and philanthropy extended far and wide 
throughout our community. As Santa Cruz 
County bids farewell to its beloved daughter of 
95 years, may her legacy of giving continue to 
inspire us for generations to come.

Heartland through Junior Achievement USA. 
Mr. Nelson was very honored to win this 
award, which is given to first-time presidents

Cities and surrounding areas for 66 years— 
equipping them with the skillset and mindset 
to create sustainable businesses, find mean-
ingful employment, and build thriving commu-
nities. Mr. Nelson exemplifies the mission 
statement of Junior Achievement of the Heart-
land, which is to ‘‘inspire and prepare young 
people to succeed.’’ As CEO, Mr. Nelson be-
lieves it is his job to put the right people in the 
right places to help children succeed and says 
that his staff and the community are to thank 
for him receiving this award. Because of his 
strong leadership, he was able to build a cul-
ture of trust within the organization and make 
a big difference for youth in the community. I 
commend Mr. Nelson for his resolve to help 
the youth in the Quad Cities and surrounding 
areas. 
It is because of strong community leaders 
such as Dougal Nelson that I am especially 
proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-
trict. Madam Speaker, I would like to again 
formally congratulate Dougal Nelson for win-
ning the Junior Achievement organization’s

AND SERVICE OF JOHN W. SEA-
MAN 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor John W. Seaman, for his brave 
service in the New York Army National Guard. 
John 
Seaman 
was 
born 
in 
1937 
in 
Wantagh, New York. When he was young, his 
family moved to Greenfield and started a farm. 
In 1959, John entered the New York Army Na-
tional Guard and was enlisted with the 247th 
Medical Company. John was deployed twice 
during his tenure with the National Guard. 
Both of his deployments were in the Return 
Forces to Germany Operations in 1990 and 
1992 following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Dur-
ing these deployments, John supported active 
troops with military medical support and deliv-
ering aid. 
For his brave service during the 1990 de-
ployment, John was awarded the Army Com-
mendation Medal. In 1974, John’s unit was 
awarded the National Guard Superior Unit 
Award for maintaining the Guard’s highest 
standards. John retired from the service in 
1997 at the rank of Sergeant First Class E–7 
and was awarded the Army Service Ribbon 
and the National Defense Service Medal for 
many years of service in the National Guard. 
In addition to his time in the National Guard, 
John loyally served his local community in a 
variety of different roles. In 1961, John and his 
wife moved to Corinth, New York, where he 
worked as the Superintendent of Buildings, 
Grounds, Maintenance, Custodial Staff, and 
the Bus Garage for the Corinth School District. 
He worked for the school district for a total of 
37 years. While working for the school, John 
was actively involved in multiple local organi-
zations. He was a member of the village plan-
ning board, president of Rondac Campers As-
sociation, and commander of the Horace D. 
Washburn American Legion Post 533. 
Throughout his life, John showed excep-
tional dedication to serving his country and his 
local community. We are proud to join the 
Saratoga County Veterans Association as part 
of the monthly Honor our Deceased Veterans 
Ceremony to honor John. On behalf of the 
21st District of New York, I would like to thank 
John Seaman and his family for their service 
to the country and to the Corinth community.

GENERAL 
HUGH ROBERT OVERHOLT, U.S. 
ARMY (RETIRED) 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Major General 
Hugh Robert Overholt of the United States 
Army (Retired) for his lifelong service to our 
country’s military, Eastern North Carolina, and 
our great Nation. Born in the town of Beebe, 
Arkansas in 1933, General Overholt attended 
the University of Arkansas where he earned 
both a bachelor’s degree and a law degree. 
While attending law school, he served as the 
Comments Editor for the University of Arkan-
sas Law Review. 
Following his graduation in 1957, General 
Overholt entered the Army’s Judge Advocate 
General’s Corps and was commissioned as a 
First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army. After his 
graduation from the Army’s Judge Advocate 
General’s school, General Overholt would go 
on to serve in various leadership roles within 
the United States Army including Assistant 
Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Army 
from 1981 to 1985 and Judge Advocate Gen-
eral of the U.S. Army from 1985 to 1989. Gen-
eral Overholt served a remarkable ten years 
as a General Officer, which included eight as 
a Major General. General Overholt used these 
years to increase the professionalism and the 
role of the Judge Advocate General’s Corps 
through critical changes and reforms. 
One of the finest accomplishments in Gen-
eral Overholt’s career was the establishment 
of the Masters in Military Law (LL.M.) program 
at the Army’s Judge Advocate General’s Legal 
Center and School located at the University of 
Virginia. General Overholt also greatly ex-
panded the schools’ facilities, automatized the 
delivery of Army legal services, and published 
a revolutionary code of professional responsi-
bility for members of the Army’s Judge Advo-
cate Corps. General Overholt’s changes mod-
ernized the Army’s legal services and exempli-
fied his ability as an outstanding leader. 
General Overholt has received numerous 
awards in recognition of his life of service. 
These 
include 
the 
Distinguished 
Service 
Medal (Oak Leaf Cluster), Legion of Merit, the 
Department of Defense Meritorious Service 
Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal (Oak 
Leaf Cluster), and the Army Commendation 
Medal (Two Oak Leaf Clusters). Along with at-
tending the Army’s Judge Advocate General’s 
Corps Basic and Advanced Courses, General 
Overholt also attended Airborne School, Com-
mand and General Staff College and the Na-
tional Defense University. 
General Overholt has served on the North 
Carolina Board of Transportation (BOT) since 
2009 and was instrumental in creating a new 
2020 Department of Transportation (DOT) law 
that gave the BOT more oversight authority. 
This new legislation also shifted designation of 
board members from the Governor to the 
General Assembly. For the first time under this 
new authority, Speaker of the North Carolina 
House Tim Moore used one of the General 
Assembly’s three appointments for General 
Overholt who was first placed on the BOT by 
Governor 
Beverly 
Perdue 
and 
was 
re-
appointed by Governors Patrick McCrory and 
Roy Cooper. General Overholt is the only BOT 
member who has been appointed by both Re-
publican and Democratic Governors, plus a 
Republican Speaker of the House. 
General Overholt in action means seeing 
good government work. Between 2009 and 
2020, General Overholt was instrumental in 
delivering over $800 million in new road 
projects to Carteret, Craven, Jones, Lenoir, 
and Pitt Counties. Of particular importance 
has been his support for military related trans-
portation projects. One of the most vital mili-
tary projects is the new Marine Corps Air Sta-
tion (MCAS) Cherry Point Slocum overpass 
ramp. General Overholt secured over $30 mil-
lion in special funding for the project as part 
of the North Carolina Department of Transpor-
tation’s (NCDOT) efforts to support the military 
and reduce traffic accidents and congestions 
in Havelock. He also advocated for the High-
way 17 Bypass through Jones County that fi-
nally connected Camp Lejeune and MCAS 
Cherry Point with a four-lane highway. This 
was decades in the making and without Gen-
eral Overholt’s leadership, it would not have 
become a reality. 
Two other major projects General Overholt 
helped shepherd through to construction are 
the Havelock Highway 70 Bypass and the 
James City-New Bern Highway 70 reconstruc-
tion. Today, his focus as an at-large BOT 
member continues to support Craven and 
Carteret Counties, the State Ports, aviation, 
rail, and the Global TransPark as well as over-
all transportation-related economic develop-
ment. 
Prior to his appointment to the BOT, Gen-
eral Overholt was a Governor’s appointee to 
the North Carolina Military Affairs Advisory 
Commission. He also helped lead the State’s 
2004 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 
response team where he focused on advo-
cating for MCAS Cherry Point. General 
Overholt was again successful in preventing 
the closure of this vital base. 
General Overholt also serves as Chairman 
of the North Carolina’s 3rd Congressional Dis-
trict Service Academy Nomination Board, 
where he assists in nominating high school 
students to attend our esteemed service acad-
emies. He continues to be a servant to the 
people and the impact he has made on the 
citizens of this great nation is truly remarkable. 
General Overholt and his wife, Ann, have two 
children, Scott and Sharon, two grandchildren, 
Grayson Overholt and Ashton Overholt Baker, 
and two great-grandchildren, Sebastian and 
Sawyer Baker. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the service of this great patriot and all he has 
done and continues to do for our great state 
and Nation.

RECOGNIZING THE EGYPTIAN 
HERITAGE DAY FESTIVAL 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to convey my good 
wishes to the organizers of this year’s Egyp-
tian Heritage Day Festival in Astoria, Queens. 
Thanks in part to the efforts of dedicated 
groups such as theirs, New York City is one 
of the world’s great cultural melting pots. 
The Egyptian community has long been a 
pillar of New York City’s vibrant immigrant 
landscape and events like the Egyptian Herit-
age Day Festival highlight the essential role 
that Egyptians and all cultural groups play in 
shaping the fabric of our great city and coun-
try. 
I have the privilege of representing Little 
Egypt in Congress, and I have seen firsthand 
the beauty and strength of this community. 
Whether it is with authentic Egyptian res-
taurants, small businesses or community 
events, Little Egypt and our city’s Egyptian 
community play a key role in making New 
York City the multicultural capital of the world. 
Egyptian Americans have made significant 
contributions to our country in the fields of 
science, arts, sports or entertainment. Ahmed 
Zewail was the first Egyptian to be awarded a 
Nobel Prize in a scientific field. He studied in 
and taught at our nation’s finest institutions 
and was nominated by President Obama to 
serve on the President’s Council of Advisors 
on Science and Technology. Mohamed Atalla 
is often described as a pioneer of semi-
conductors and electronics. He was awarded 
the Benjamin Franklin medal in physics and 
was inducted into the National Inventors Hall 
of Fame. Rami Malek has starred in several 
award-winning films and in 2018 he became 
the first actor of Egyptian heritage to win the 
Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in 
Bohemian Rhapsody. Michael Mina, is a grad-
uate of the Culinary Institute of America and 
now heads the Mina Group, a network of 40 
restaurants worldwide. 
As these examples illustrate, Egyptian 
Americans have played a crucial part in our 
country’s scientific, cultural, and artistic ac-
complishments. Their talents, hard work and 
dedication help make our country a global 
beacon of opportunity and discovery. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in congratulating the organizers of this 
festival and celebrating the enormous con-
tributions that Egyptian-Americans have made 
to our country.

RECOGNIZING MS. JANINE GUIDO 
AND 
THE 
SPERANZA 
ANIMAL 
RESCUE 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 20, 2022 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I am honored 
to recognize Ms. Janine Guido for her tireless, 
selfless, and relentless commitment to the pro-
tection and rescue of animals in and outside 
of our community. 
Janine grew up around avid horse-riders— 
where her affection and love for animals and 
all wildlife began. When her family built their 
18-acre horse farm in Mechanicsburg, Penn-
sylvania, she and her sister not only trained 
the horses, but also gave lessons/taught other 
children the joys and value of horses. Though 
horses were her main focus, her heart also led 
her to rescue myriad stray, injured, and un-
wanted animals in her free time. 
In 2011, after several knee injuries that 
made it impossible to train/ride horses any-
more, Janine turned her focus fulltime to res-
cuing animals. Using the family’s farm as her 
home base, Janine went on to save numerous

creatures—dogs, horses, goats, and cows, for 
starters. In the Spring of 2012, she began the 
process of establishing an official, non-profit 
Animal 
Rescue 
organization 
named 
‘‘Speranza’’—the Italian word for ‘‘hope’’— 
which is now known around the world. 
Janine is passionate about rescuing and re-
habilitating 
animals—particularly 
those 
deemed ‘‘lost causes.’’ She ensures that not 
only do these special creatures get a second 
chance at life, but that they truly learn the 
meaning of friendship, acceptance, trust, and 
love. Any animal that is, has been, or will be 
in Janine’s care—which in some cases even 
means at the tragic moment of their last 
breaths in her arms—will know how much 
they’re loved, cared for, and how much their 
lives mattered. 
Janine’s tireless support by her loving family 
and longtime boyfriend continue to allow her 
not only to realize her life’s work, but to give 
100 percent of her time, heart, and soul to this 
critical mission. She has set the standard not 
only for the numerous volunteers and good 
Samaritans who selflessly give of their time 
and/or treasure to share in this calling, but for 
all of us to follow. 
I am humbled and honored to recognize and 
commend Ms. Janine Guido and Speranza 
Animal Rescue of Mechanicsburg, Pennsyl-
vania, on the auspicious occasion of their 10th 
Anniversary, and dedication to, support, and 
protection of our creatures great and small. I 
wish her Godspeed as she continues these 
spectacular and meaningful adventures.
