called to order by the Chief Justice of 
the United States.

TRIAL 
OF 
DONALD 
J. 
TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate 
will convene as a Court of Impeach-
ment. 
The Chaplain will lead us in prayer. 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, the way, the truth, and 
the life, unite our Senators in their 
striving to do Your will. 
Lord, You have been our help in ages 
past. You are our hope for the years to 
come. We trust the power of Your pre-
vailing providence to bring this im-
peachment trial to the conclusion You 
desire. 
Lord, we acknowledge that Your 
thoughts are not our thoughts and 
Your ways are not our ways; for as the 
heavens are higher than the Earth, so 
are Your thoughts higher than our 
thoughts and Your ways higher than 
our ways. 
Lord, we love You. Empower our Sen-
ators. Renew their strength. 
We pray in Your dependable Name. 
Amen. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Chief Justice led the Pledge of 
Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
THE JOURNAL 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. If there is no 
objection, the Journal of proceedings of 
the trial is approved to date. 
The Sergeant at Arms will make the 
proclamation. 
The Sergeant at Arms, Michael C. 
Stenger, made proclamation as follows: 
Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are 
commanded to keep silence, on pain of im-
prisonment, while the Senate of the United 
States is sitting for the trial of the articles 
of impeachment exhibited by the House of 
Representatives against Donald John Trump, 
President of the United States. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
colleagues, we should expect 2 to 3 
hours of session today. We will take a 
quick break if needed. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to 
the provisions of S. Res. 483, the coun-
sel for the President have 24 hours to 
make the presentation of their case. 
The Senate will now hear you. 
The Presiding Officer recognizes Mr. 
Cipollone to begin the presentation of 
the case for the President. 
OPENING STATEMENT 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Senators, Leader MCCONNELL, 
Democratic Leader SCHUMER, thank 
you for your time and thank you for 
your attention. I want to start out, 
just very briefly, giving you a short 
plan for today. We are going to be very 
respectful of your time. As Leader 
MCCONNELL said, we anticipate going 
about 2 to 3 hours at most and to be 
out of here by 1 at the latest. 
We are going to focus today on two 
points. You heard the House managers 
speak for nearly 24 hours over 3 days. 
We don’t anticipate using that much 
time. We don’t believe that they have 
come anywhere close to meeting their 
burden for what they are asking you to 
do. In fact, we believe that, when you 
hear the facts—and that is what we in-
tend to cover today, the facts—you will 
find that the President did absolutely 
nothing wrong. What we intend to do 
today—and we will have more presen-
tations in greater detail on Monday, 
but what we intend to do today—is go 
through their record that they estab-
lished in the House, and we intend to 
show you some of the evidence that 
they adduced in the House that they 
decided, over their 3 days and 24 hours, 
that they didn’t have enough time or 
made a decision not to show you. 
And every time you see one of these 
pieces of evidence, ask yourself: Why 
didn’t I see that in the first 3 days? 
They had it. It came out of their proc-
ess. Why didn’t they show that to the 
Senate? I think that is an important 
question because, as House managers, 
really, their goal should be to give you 
all of the facts, because they are ask-
ing you to do something very, very 
consequential and, I would submit to 
you—to use a word that Mr. SCHIFF 
used a lot—very, very dangerous. 
That is the second point that I would 
ask you to keep in mind today. They 
are asking you not only to overturn 
the results of the last election, but as 
I have said before, they are asking you 
to remove President Trump from the 
ballot in an election that is occurring 
in approximately 9 months. They are 
asking you to tear up all of the ballots

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S568 
January 25, 2020 
across this country, on your own ini-
tiative—take that decision away from 
the American people. And I don’t think 
they spent 1 minute of their 24 hours 
talking to you about the consequences 
of that for our country—not 1 minute. 
They didn’t tell you what that would 
mean for our country—today, this 
year, and forever into our future. 
They are asking you to do something 
that no Senate has ever done, and they 
are asking you to do it with no evi-
dence. That is wrong, and I ask you to 
keep that in mind. I ask you to keep 
that in mind. So what I would do is 
point out one piece of evidence for you, 
and then I am going to turn it over to 
my colleagues, and they will walk you 
through their record, and they will 
show you things that they didn’t show 
you. 
Now, they didn’t talk a lot about the 
transcript of the call, which I would 
submit is the best evidence of what 
happened on the call. And they said 
things over and over again that are 
simply not true. One of them was: 
There is no evidence of President 
Trump’s interest in burden-sharing; 
that wasn’t the real reason. But they 
didn’t tell you that burden-sharing was 
discussed in the call, in the transcript 
of the call. They didn’t tell you that. 
Why? Let me read it to you. Here is 
the President. And we will go through 
the entire transcript. I am not going to 
read the whole transcript. We will 
make it available. I am sure you have 
it, but we will make available copies of 
the transcript so you can have it. 
The President said—and they read 
this line: 
I will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We 
spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. 
But they stopped there. They didn’t 
read the following: 
Much more than European countries are 
doing and they should be helping you more 
than they are. Germany does almost nothing 
for you. All they do is talk and I think it’s 
something that you should really ask them 
about. When I was speaking to Angela 
Merkel she talks Ukraine, but she doesn’t do 
anything. A lot of European countries are 
the same way so I think it’s something you 
want to look at but the United States has 
been very, very good to Ukraine. 
That is where they picked up again 
with the quote, but they left out the 
entire discussion of burden-sharing. 
Now, what does President Zelensky 
say? Does he disagree? No, he agrees. 
They didn’t tell you this. They didn’t 
tell you this. Didn’t have time in 24 
hours to tell you this: 
Yes you are absolutely right. Not only 
100%, but actually [100%] and I can tell you 
the following; I did talk to Angela Merkel 
and I did meet with her. I also met and 
talked with Macron and I told them that 
they are not doing quite as much as they 
need to be doing on the issues with the sanc-
tions. They are not enforcing the sanctions. 
They are not working as much as they 
should work for Ukraine. It turns out that 
even though logically, the European Union 
should be our biggest partner but technically 
the United States is a much bigger partner 
than the European Union and I’m very grate-
ful to you for that because the United States 
is doing quite a lot for Ukraine. Much more 
than the European Union especially when we 
are talking about sanctions against the Rus-
sian Federation. 
You heard a lot about the importance 
of confronting Russia, and we are going 
to talk about that. And you will hear 
that President Trump has a strong 
record on confronting Russia. You will 
hear that President Trump has a 
strong record of support for Ukraine. 
You will hear that from the witnesses 
in their record that they didn’t tell you 
about. 
That is one very important example. 
They come here to the Senate and ask 
you: remove a President, tear up the 
ballots in all of your States. And they 
don’t bother to read the key evidence 
of the discussion of burden-sharing 
that is in the call itself. That is em-
blematic of their entire presentation. 
I am going to turn the presentation 
over to my colleague, Mike Purpura. 
He is going to walk you through many 
more examples of this. With each ex-
ample, ask yourself: Why am I just 
hearing about this now after 24 hours 
of sitting through arguments? Why? 
The reason is, we can talk about the 
process; we will talk about the law; but 
today we are going to confront them on 
the merits of their argument. 
They have the burden of proof, and 
they have not come close to meeting it. 
I want to ask you to think about one 
issue regarding process, beyond proc-
ess. If you were really interested in 
finding out the truth, why would you 
run a process the way they ran it? If 
you were really confident in your posi-
tion on the facts, why would you lock 
everybody out of it from the Presi-
dent’s side? Why would you do that? 
We will talk about the process argu-
ments, but the process arguments also 
are compelling evidence on the merits 
because it is evidence that they them-
selves don’t believe in the facts of their 
case. 
The fact that they came here for 24 
hours and hid evidence from you is fur-
ther evidence that they don’t really be-
lieve in the facts of their case; that 
this is—for all their talk about election 
interference, that they are here to per-
petrate the most massive interference 
in an election in American history, and 
we can’t allow that to happen. 
It would violate our Constitution; it 
would violate our history; it would vio-
late our obligations to the future; and, 
most importantly, it would violate the 
sacred trust the American people have 
placed in you and have placed in them. 
The American people decide elections. 
They have one coming up in 9 months. 
We will be very efficient. We will 
begin our presentation today. We will 
show you a lot of evidence that they 
should have showed you, and we will 
finish efficiently and quickly so that 
we can all go have an election. 
Thank you, and I yield to my col-
league, Michael Purpura. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, good 
morning. 
Again, my name is Michael Purpura. 
I serve as Deputy Counsel to the Presi-
dent. It is my honor and privilege to 
appear before you today on behalf of 
President Donald J. Trump. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. SCHIFF. And what is the President’s 
response? Well, it reads like a classic orga-
nized crime shakedown. 
Shorn of its rambling character and in not 
so many words, this is the essence of what 
the President communicates. We’ve been 
very good to your country. Very good. No 
other country has done as much as we have. 
But you know what? I don’t see much reci-
procity here. 
I hear what you want. I have a favor I want 
from you, though. And I’m going to say this 
only seven times, so you better listen good. 
I want you to make up dirt on my political 
opponent. Understand? Lots of it, on this and 
on that. 
I’m going to put you in touch with people, 
and not just any people. I’m going to put you 
in touch with the attorney general of the 
United States, my attorney general, Bill 
Barr. He’s got the whole weight of the Amer-
ican law enforcement behind him. And I’m 
going to put you in touch with Rudy. 
You’re going to love him. Trust me. You 
know what I’m asking? And so I’m only 
going to say this a few more times in a few 
more ways. And by the way, don’t call me 
again. I’ll call you when you’ve done what I 
asked. 
This is in sum and character what the 
President was trying to communicate. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. That is fake. 
That is not the real call. That is not 
the evidence here. That is not the tran-
script that Mr. Cipollone just ref-
erenced. We can shrug it off and say we 
were making light or a joke, but that 
was in a hearing in the U.S. House of 
Representatives, 
discussing 
the 
re-
moval of the President of the United 
States from office. 
There are very few things, if any, 
that can be as grave and as serious. 
Let’s stick with the evidence. Let’s 
talk about the facts and the evidence 
in this case. 
The most important piece of evidence 
we have in the case, and before you, is 
the one that we began with nearly 4 
months ago—the actual transcript of 
the July 25, 2019, telephone call be-
tween President Trump and President 
Zelensky—the real transcript. 
If that were the only evidence we 
had, it would be enough to show the 
Democrats’ entire theory is completely 
unfounded, but the transcript is far 
from the only evidence demonstrating 
that the President did nothing wrong. 
Once you sweep away all of the blus-
ter and innuendo, the selective leaks, 
the closed-door examinations of the 
Democrats’ hand-picked witnesses, the 
staged public hearings, what we are 
left with are six key facts that have 
not, and will not, change: 
First, the transcript shows that the 
President did not condition either se-
curity assistance or a meeting on any-
thing. The paused security assistance 
funds aren’t even mentioned on the 
call. 
Second, 
President 
Zelensky 
and 
other Ukrainian officials have repeat-
edly said that there was no quid pro

quo and no pressure on them to review 
anything. 
Third, President Zelensky and high- 
ranking Ukrainian officials did not 
even know—did not even know—the se-
curity assistance was paused until the 
end of August, over a month after the 
July 25 call. 
Fourth, not a single witness testified 
that the President himself said that 
there was any connection between any 
investigations and security assistance, 
a Presidential meeting, or anything 
else. 
Fifth, the security assistance flowed 
on September 11, and a Presidential 
meeting took place on September 25, 
without the Ukrainian Government an-
nouncing any investigations. 
Finally, the Democrats’ blind drive 
to impeach the President does not and 
cannot change the fact, as attested to 
by the Democrats’ own witnesses, that 
President Trump has been a better 
friend 
and 
stronger 
supporter 
of 
Ukraine than his predecessor. 
Those are the facts. We plan to ad-
dress some of them today and some of 
them next week. Each one of these six 
facts standing alone is enough to sink 
the Democrats’ case. Combined, they 
establish what we have known since 
the beginning: The President did abso-
lutely nothing wrong. 
The Democrats’ allegation that the 
President engaged in a quid pro quo is 
unfounded and contrary to the facts. 
The truth is simple, and it is right be-
fore our eyes. The President was, at all 
times, acting in our national interest 
and pursuant to his oath of office. 
Before I dive in and speak further 
about the facts, let me mention some-
thing that my colleagues will discuss 
in greater detail. The facts that I am 
about to discuss today are the Demo-
crats’ facts. This is important because 
the House managers spoke to you for a 
very long time, over 21 hours, and they 
repeatedly claimed to you that their 
case is and their evidence is over-
whelming and uncontested. It is not. 
I am going to share a number of facts 
with you this morning that the House 
managers didn’t share with you during 
more than 21 hours. I will ask you, as 
Mr. Cipollone already mentioned, that 
when you hear me say something the 
House managers didn’t present to you, 
ask yourself: Why didn’t they tell me 
that? Is that something I would have 
liked to have known? Why am I hear-
ing it for first time from the Presi-
dent’s lawyers? 
It is not because they did not have 
enough time; that is for sure. They 
only showed you a very selective part 
of the record—their record. And they— 
remember this—have the very heavy 
burden of proof before you. 
The President is forced to mount a 
defense in this Chamber against a 
record that the Democrats developed. 
The record that we have to go on today 
is based entirely on House Democratic 
facts precleared in a basement bunk-
er—not mostly, entirely. Yet even 
those facts absolutely exonerate the 
President. 
Let’s start with the transcript. The 
President did not link security assist-
ance to any investigations on the July 
25 call. Let’s step back. On July 25, 
President 
Trump 
called 
President 
Zelensky. This was their second phone 
call, both were congratulatory. 
On April 21, President Trump called 
to congratulate President Zelensky on 
winning the Presidential election. On 
July 25, the President called because 
President Zelensky’s party had just 
won a large number of seats in Par-
liament. 
On September 24, before Speaker 
PELOSI had any idea what President 
Trump and President Zelensky actu-
ally said on the July 25 call, she called 
for an impeachment inquiry into Presi-
dent Trump. 
In the interest of full transparency 
and to show that he had done nothing 
wrong, President Trump took the un-
precedented—unprecedented—step 
of 
declassifying the call transcript so that 
the American people could see for 
themselves exactly what the two Presi-
dents discussed. 
What did President Trump say to 
President Zelensky on the July 25 call? 
President Trump raised two issues. I 
am going to be speaking about those 
two issues a fair amount this morning. 
They are the two issues that go to the 
core of how President Trump ap-
proaches foreign aid. 
When it comes to sending U.S. tax-
payer money overseas, the President is 
focused on burden-sharing and corrup-
tion. First, the President, rightly, had 
real concerns about whether European 
and other countries were contributing 
their fair share to ensuring Ukraine se-
curity. 
Second, corruption. Since the fall of 
the Soviet Union, Ukraine has suffered 
from one of the worst environments for 
corruption in the world. A parade of 
witnesses testified in the House about 
the pervasive corruption in Ukraine 
and how it is in American’s foreign pol-
icy and national security interests to 
help Ukraine combat corruption—turn-
ing the call right off the bat. 
President Trump mentioned burden- 
sharing to President Zelensky. Presi-
dent Trump told President Zelensky 
that Germany does almost nothing for 
you, and a lot of European countries 
are the same way. President Trump 
specifically mentioned speaking to An-
gela Merkel of Germany, who he said 
talks Ukraine but she doesn’t do any-
thing. 
President Zelensky agreed; you are 
absolutely right. He said that he spoke 
with the leaders of Germany and 
France and told them they are not 
doing quite as much as they need to be 
doing. 
Right at the beginning of the call, 
President Trump was talking about 
burden-sharing. President Trump then 
turned to corruption in the form of for-
eign interference in the 2016 Presi-
dential election. 
There is absolutely nothing wrong 
with asking a foreign leader to help get 
to the bottom of all forms of foreign in-
terference in an American Presidential 
election. You will hear more about 
that later from one of my colleagues. 
What else did the President say? The 
President 
also 
warned 
President 
Zelensky that he appeared to be sur-
rounding himself with some of the 
same people as his predecessor and sug-
gested that a very fair and very good 
prosecutor was shut down by some very 
bad people. Again, one of my col-
leagues will speak more about that. 
The content of the July 25 call was in 
line with the Trump administration’s 
legitimate concerns about corruption 
and reflected the hope that President 
Zelensky, who campaigned on a plat-
form of reform, would finally clean up 
Ukraine. 
So what did President Trump and 
President Zelensky discuss in the July 
20 call? Two issues: burden-sharing and 
corruption. 
Just as importantly, what wasn’t dis-
cussed on the July 25 call? There was 
no discussion of the paused security as-
sistance on the July 25 call. House 
Democrats keep pointing to President 
Zelensky’s statement that ‘‘I would 
also like to thank you for your great 
support in the area of defense.’’ But he 
wasn’t talking there about the paused 
security assistance. He tells us in the 
very next sentence exactly what he was 
talking about—Javelin missiles. ‘‘We 
are ready,’’ President Zelensky con-
tinues, ‘‘to continue to cooperate for 
the next steps specifically we are al-
most ready to buy more Javelins from 
the United States for defense pur-
poses.’’ 
Javelins are the anti-tank missiles 
only made available to the Ukrainians 
by President Trump. President Obama 
refused to give Javelins to the Ukrain-
ians for years. Javelin sales were not 
part of the security assistance that had 
been paused at the time of the call. 
Javelin sales have nothing to do with 
the paused security assistance. Those 
are different programs entirely. But 
don’t take my word for it. Both former 
Ambassador 
to 
Ukraine 
Marie 
Yovanovitch and NSC Director Tim-
othy Morrison confirmed the Javelin 
missiles and security assistance were 
unrelated. 
The House managers didn’t tell you 
about Ambassador Yovanovitch’s and 
Tim Morrison’s testimony. Why not? 
They could have taken 2 to 5 minutes 
out of 21 hours to make sure you under-
stood that the Javelin sales being dis-
cussed were not part of the paused se-
curity assistance. This puts the fol-
lowing statement by President Trump 
in a whole new light, doesn’t it? ‘‘I 
would like you to do us a favor though 
because our country has been through 
a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about 
it.’’ 
As everyone knows by now, President 
Trump asked President Zelensky ‘‘to 
do us a favor.’’ And he made clear that 
‘‘us’’ referred to our country and not 
himself. More importantly, the Presi-
dent was not connecting ‘‘do us a

favor’’ to the Javelin sales that Presi-
dent Zelensky mentioned; that makes 
no sense in the language there. But 
even if he had been, the Javelin sales 
were not part of the security assistance 
that had been temporarily paused. 
I want to be very clear about this. 
When the House Democrats claim that 
the Javelin sales discussed in the July 
25 call are part of the paused security 
assistance, it is misleading. They are 
trying to confuse you and just sort of 
wrap everything in, instead of unpack-
ing it the right way. There was no 
mention of the paused security assist-
ance on the call and certainly not for 
President Trump or from President 
Trump. 
As you know, head-of-state calls are 
staffed by a number of aides on both 
sides. 
LTC 
Alexander 
Vindman, 
detailee at the National Security Coun-
cil, raised a concern about the call, and 
that was just a policy concern. Lieu-
tenant Colonel Vindman admitted he 
did not know if there was a crime or 
anything of that nature, but he had 
deep policy concerns. So there you 
have it. 
But the President sets the foreign 
policy. In a democracy such as ours, 
the elected leaders make foreign policy 
while the unelected staff, such as Lieu-
tenant Colonel Vindman, implement 
the policy. Other witnesses were on the 
July 25 call and had very different re-
actions than that of Lieutenant Colo-
nel Vindman. LTG Keith Kellogg, na-
tional security advisor to the Vice 
President, former Acting National Se-
curity Advisor, and a long-serving and 
highly decorated veteran attended the 
call. 
According to General Kelly: 
I was on the much-reported July 25 call be-
tween President Donald Trump and Presi-
dent Zelensky. As an exceedingly proud 
member of President Trump’s administra-
tion and as a 34-year highly experienced 
combat veteran who retired at the rank of 
Lieutenant General in the Army, I heard 
nothing wrong or improper on the call. I had 
and have no concerns. 
The House managers said that other 
witnesses were also troubled by the 
July 25 call and identified those wit-
nesses as Jennifer Williams and Tim 
Morrison. 
Jennifer Williams, who works for 
Lieutenant 
General 
Kellogg, 
now 
claims that she has concerns about the 
call. You heard that from the House 
managers. They were very careful in 
the way they worded that. What they 
didn’t tell you is that Ms. Williams was 
so troubled at the time of the call that 
she told exactly zero people of her con-
cern. She told no one for 2 months fol-
lowing the call—not one person. Ms. 
Williams didn’t raise any concerns 
about the call when it took place, not 
with Lieutenant General Kellogg, not 
with counsel, not with anyone. 
Ms. Williams waited to announce her 
concerns until Speaker PELOSI publicly 
announced her impeachment inquiry. 
The House managers didn’t tell you 
that. Why not? 
Tim Morrison, who is Lieutenant 
Colonel Vindman’s boss, was also on 
the call. Mr. Morrison reported the call 
to the National Security Council law-
yers, not because he was troubled by 
anything on the call but because he 
was worried about leaks and, in his 
words, ‘‘how it would play out in Wash-
ington’s polarized environment.’’ 
‘‘I want to be clear,’’ Mr. Morrison 
testified, ‘‘I was not concerned that 
anything illegal was discussed.’’ 
Mr. Morrison further testified that 
there was nothing improper and noth-
ing illegal about anything that was 
said on the call. In fact, Mr. Morrison 
repeatedly testified that he disagreed 
with Lieutenant Colonel Vindman’s as-
sessment that President Trump made 
demands of President Zelensky or that 
he said anything improper at all. 
Here is Mr. Morrison: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. SCHIFF. In that transcript, does the 
President not ask Zelensky to look into the 
Bidens? 
Mr. MORRISON. Mr. Chairman, I can only 
tell you what I was thinking at the time. 
That is not what I understood the President 
to be doing. 
Mr. TURNER. Do you believe, in your 
opinion, that the President of the United 
States demanded that President Zelensky 
undertake these investigations? 
Mr. MORRISON. No, sir. 
Mr. WENSTRUP. And you didn’t hear the 
President make a demand, did you? 
Mr. MORRISON. No, sir. 
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Again, there were no de-
mands from your perspective, Mr. Morrison? 
Mr. MORRISON. That is correct, sir. 
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Is it fair to say that as 
you were listening to the call, you weren’t 
thinking ‘‘Wow, the President is bribing the 
President of Ukraine’’? That never crossed 
your mind? 
Mr. MORRISON. It did not, sir. 
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Or that he was extorting 
the President of Ukraine? 
Mr. MORRISON. No, sir. 
Mr. RATCLIFFE. Or doing anything im-
proper? 
Mr. MORRISON. Correct, sir. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
PURPURA. 
Signifi-
cantly, 
the 
Ukrainian 
Government 
never raised any concerns about the 
July 25 call. Just hours after the call, 
Ambassador William Taylor, head of 
the U.S. mission in Ukraine, had din-
ner with then-Secretary of the Ukrain-
ian National Security and Defense 
Council, who seemed to think that the 
call went fine. 
The call went well. He wasn’t disturbed by 
anything. 
The House managers didn’t tell you 
that. Why not? 
Ambassador Kurt Volker, the U.S. 
Special Representative for Ukraine, 
was not on the call, but Ambassador 
Volker spoke regularly with President 
Zelensky and other top officials in the 
Ukraine Government and even met 
with President Zelensky the day after 
the call. He testified that in no way, 
shape, or form in either the readouts 
for the United States or Ukraine did he 
receive any indication whatsoever for 
anything that resembles a quid pro quo 
on the July 25 call. 
Here is Ambassador Volker. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ms. STEFANIK. In fact, the day after the 
call, you met with President Zelensky. This 
would be on July 26. 
Ambassador VOLKER. Correct. 
Ms. STEFANIK. In that meeting, he made 
no mention of quid pro quo? 
Ambassador VOLKER. No. 
Ms. STEFANIK. He made no mention of 
withholding the aid? 
Ambassador VOLKER. No. 
Ms. STEFANIK. He made no mention of 
bribery? 
Ambassador VOLKER. No. 
Ms. STEFANIK. So the fact is that Ukrain-
ians were not even aware of this hold on aid. 
Is that correct? 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. They didn’t 
tell you about this testimony from 
Ambassador Volker. Why not? Presi-
dent Zelensky himself has confirmed 
on at least three separate occasions 
that his July 25 call with President 
Trump was a ‘‘good phone call’’ and 
‘‘normal’’ and ‘‘nobody pushed me.’’ 
When President Zelensky’s adviser, 
Andriy Yermak, was asked if he ever 
felt there was a connection between 
military aid and the request for inves-
tigations, he was adamant that ‘‘We 
never had that feeling’’ and ‘‘We did 
not have the feeling that this aid was 
connected to any one specific issue.’’ 
Of course, the best evidence that 
there was no pressure or quid pro quo is 
the 
statements 
of 
the 
Ukrainians 
themselves. The fact that President 
Zelensky himself felt no pressure on 
the call and did not perceive there to 
be any connection between security as-
sistance and investigations would, in 
any ordinary case in any court, be to-
tally fatal to the prosecution. The 
judge would throw it out. The case 
would be over. What more do you need 
to know? The House team knows that. 
They know the record inside out, up-
side down, left and right. 
So what do they do? How do they try 
to overcome the direct words from 
President Zelensky and his administra-
tion that they felt no pressure? They 
tell you that the Ukrainians must have 
felt pressure regardless of what they 
have said. They try to overcome the 
devastating evidence against them by, 
apparently, claiming to be mind read-
ers. They know what is in President 
Zelensky’s mind better than President 
Zelensky does. President Zelensky said 
he felt no pressure. The House man-
agers tell you they know better. This is 
really a theme of the House case. 
I want you to remember this. Every 
time the Democrats say that President 
Trump made demands or issued a quid 
pro quo to President Zelensky on the 
July 25 call, they are saying that Presi-
dent Zelensky and his top advisers are 
being untruthful, and they acknowl-
edge that is what they are saying. They 
have said it over the past few days. 
Tell me how that helps U.S. foreign 
policy and national security to say 
that about our friends. We know there 
was no quid pro quo on the call. We 
know that from the transcripts. But 
the call is not the only evidence show-
ing that there was no quid pro quo. 
There couldn’t possibly have been a 
quid pro quo because Ukrainians did 
not even know the security assistance 
was on hold until it was reported in the

media by POLITICO at the end of Au-
gust, more than a month after the July 
25 call. 
Think about this. The Democrats ac-
cused the President of leveraging secu-
rity assistance to supposedly force 
President Zelensky to announce inves-
tigations, but how can that possibly be 
when the Ukrainians were not even 
aware that the security assistance was 
paused? There can’t be a threat with-
out the person knowing he is being 
threatened. There can’t be a quid pro 
quo without the quo. 
Ambassador Volker testified that the 
Ukrainians did not know about the 
hold until reading about it in POLIT-
ICO. Ambassador Taylor and Tim Mor-
rison both agree. Deputy Assistant 
Secretary of State George Kent testi-
fied that no Ukrainian official con-
tacted him about the paused security 
assistance until that first intense week 
in September. 
Let’s hear from the four of them. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador VOLKER. I believe that the 
Ukrainians became aware of the hold on Au-
gust 29 and not before. That date is the first 
time any of them asked me about the hold 
by forwarding an article that had been pub-
lished in POLITICO. 
Ambassador TAYLOR. It was only after 
August 29 that I got calls from several of the 
Ukrainian officials. 
Mr. CASTOR. You mentioned the August 
28 POLITICO article. Is that the first time 
that you believed the Ukrainians may have 
had a real sense that the aid was on hold? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Yes. 
Mr. HURD. Mr. Kent, had you had any 
Ukrainian official contacting you concerned 
about—when was the first time a Ukrainian 
official contacted you with concern about 
potential withholding of U.S. aid? 
Mr. KENT. It was after the article in PO-
LITICO came out in that first intense week 
of September. 
Mr. HURD. It wasn’t until the POLITICO 
article? 
Mr. KENT. That is correct. I received a 
text message from one of my Ukrainian 
counterparts forwarding that article, and 
that is the first they raised it with me. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. The House 
managers didn’t show you this testi-
mony from any of these four witnesses. 
Why not? Why didn’t they give you the 
context of this testimony? Think about 
this as well. If the Ukrainians had been 
aware of the review on security assist-
ance, they, of course, would have said 
something. There were numerous high- 
level diplomatic meetings between sen-
ior Ukrainian and U.S. officials during 
the summer after the review on the se-
curity assistance began, but before 
President Zelensky learned of the hold 
through the POLITICO article. If the 
Ukrainians had known about the hold, 
they would have raised it in one of 
those meetings. Yet the Ukrainians 
didn’t say anything about the hold at a 
single one of those meetings, not on 
July 9, not on July 10, not on July 25, 
not on July 26, not on August 27. At 
none of those meetings—none of those 
meetings—did the Ukrainians mention 
the pause on security assistance. 
Ambassador Volker testified that he 
was regularly in touch with the senior, 
highest level officials in the Ukrainian 
Government and that the Ukrainian of-
ficials would confide things and would 
have asked if they had any questions 
about the aid. Nobody said a word to 
Ambassador Volker until the end of 
August. 
Then, within hours of the POLITICO 
article’s being published, Mr. Yermak 
texted Ambassador Volker with a link 
to the article and to ask about the re-
port. In other words, as soon as the 
Ukrainians learned about the hold, 
they asked about it. 
Mr. SCHIFF said something during the 
21 hours—or more than 21 hours—that 
he and his team spoke that I actually 
agree with, which is when he talked 
about common sense. Many of us at the 
tables and in the room are former pros-
ecutors at the State, Federal, or mili-
tary level. Prosecutors talk a lot about 
common sense. Common sense comes 
into play right here. 
The top Ukrainian officials said 
nothing—nothing at all—to their U.S. 
counterparts during all of these meet-
ings about the pause on security assist-
ance, but then—boom. As soon as the 
POLITICO article comes out, suddenly, 
in that first intense week of Sep-
tember, in George Kent’s words, secu-
rity assistance was all they wanted to 
talk about. 
What must we conclude if we are 
using our common sense?—that they 
didn’t know about the pause until the 
POLITICO article on August 28. There 
was no activity before. The article 
comes out, and there is a flurry of ac-
tivity. 
That is common sense, and it is abso-
lutely fatal to the House managers’ 
case. The House managers are aware 
that the Ukrainians’ lack of knowledge 
on the hold is fatal to their case, so 
they desperately tried to muddy the 
water. 
The managers told you the Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of Defense, Laura 
Cooper, presented two emails that peo-
ple on her staff received from people at 
the State Department regarding con-
versations with people at the Ukraine 
Embassy that could have been about 
U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. 
What they did not tell you is that Ms. 
Cooper testified that she could not say 
for certain whether the emails were 
about the pause on security assistance. 
She couldn’t say one way or another. 
She also testified that she didn’t 
want to speculate about the meaning of 
the words in the emails. The House 
managers also didn’t tell you that Ms. 
Cooper testified: ‘‘I reviewed my cal-
endar, and the only meeting where I 
can recall a Ukrainian official raising 
the issue of security assistance with 
me is on September 5 at the Ukrainian 
Independence Day celebration.’’ The 
House managers didn’t tell you that. 
The House managers also mentioned 
that one of Ambassador Volker’s advis-
ers, Catherine Croft, claimed that the 
Ukrainian Embassy officials learned 
about the pause earlier than the PO-
LITICO article; but when asked when 
she heard from Ukraine Embassy offi-
cials, Ms. Croft admitted that she can’t 
remember those specifics and did not 
think that she took notes. 
Ms. Croft also did not remember 
when news of the hold became public. 
Remember though, that Ambassador 
Volker, her boss, who was in regular 
contact with President Zelensky and 
the top Ukrainian aides, was very 
clear: ‘‘I believe the Ukrainians be-
came aware of the hold on August 29 
and not before.’’ 
This is all the House managers have 
in contrast to the testimony of Volker, 
Taylor, Morrison, and Kent, the text 
from Yermak, the words of the high- 
ranking Ukrainians themselves, and 
the flurry of activity that began on Au-
gust 28. That is the evidence that they 
want you to consider as a basis to re-
move the duly elected President of the 
United States. 
The bottom line is, it is not possible 
for the pause on security assistance to 
have been used as leverage when Presi-
dent Zelensky and other top Ukrainian 
officials did not know about it. That is 
what you need to know. That is what 
the House managers didn’t tell you. 
The House managers know how im-
portant this issue is. When we briefly 
mentioned it a few days ago, they told 
us we needed to check our facts. We 
did. We are right. President Zelensky 
and his top aides did not know about 
the pause on security assistance at the 
time of the July 25 call and did not 
know about it until August 28, when 
the POLITICO article was published. 
We know there was no quid pro quo 
on the July 25 call. We know the 
Ukrainians did not know the security 
assistance had been paused at the time 
of the call. There is simply no evidence 
anywhere that President Trump ever 
linked security assistance to any inves-
tigations. 
Most of the Democrats’ witnesses 
have never spoken to the President at 
all, let alone about Ukraine security 
assistance. The two people in the 
House’s record who asked President 
Trump about whether there was any 
linkage between security assistance 
and investigations were told, in no un-
certain terms, that there was no con-
nection between the two. 
When Ambassador to the European 
Union Gordon Sondland asked the 
President in, approximately, the Sep-
tember 9 timeframe, the President told 
him, ‘‘I want nothing. I want no quid 
pro quo.’’ 
Even earlier, on August 31, Senator 
RON JOHNSON asked the President if 
there were any connection between se-
curity assistance and investigations. 
The President answered: 
No way. I would never do that. Who told 
you that? 
Two witnesses, Ambassador Taylor 
and Tim Morrison, said they came to 
believe security assistance was linked 
to investigations, but both witnesses 
based this belief entirely on what they 
had heard from Ambassador Sondland 
before Ambassador Sondland spoke to

the President. Neither Taylor nor Mor-
rison ever spoke to the President about 
the matter. 
How did Ambassador Sondland come 
to believe that there was any connec-
tion between security assistance and 
investigations? Again, the House man-
agers didn’t tell you. Why not? In his 
public 
testimony, 
Ambassador 
Sondland used variations of the words 
‘‘assume,’’ ‘‘presume,’’ ‘‘guess,’’ ‘‘spec-
ulate,’’ and ‘‘belief’’ over 30 times. 
Here are some examples. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. That was my 
presumption, my personal presumption. 
That was my belief. 
That was my presumption. 
I presumed that might have to be done in 
order to get the aid released. 
It was a presumption. 
I have been very clear as to when I was pre-
suming, and I was presuming on the aid. 
It would be pure, you know, guesswork on 
my part, speculation. I don’t know. 
That was the problem, Mr. Goldman. No 
one told me directly that the aid was tied to 
anything. I was presuming it was. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. They didn’t 
show you any of this testimony—not 
once—during 
their 
21-hour 
presen-
tation. It was 21 hours—more than 21 
hours—and they couldn’t give you the 
context 
to 
evaluate 
Ambassador 
Sondland. All the Democrats have to 
support the alleged link between secu-
rity assistance and investigations is 
Ambassador Sondland’s assumptions 
and presumptions. 
We remember this exchange. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. TURNER. Is it correct no one on this 
planet told you that Donald Trump was 
tying this aid to the investigations? Because, 
if your answer is yes, then the chairman is 
wrong, and the headline on CNN is wrong. No 
one on this planet told you that President 
Trump was tying aid to investigations, yes 
or no? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Yes. 
Mr. TURNER. So you really have no testi-
mony today that ties President Trump to a 
scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in ex-
change for these investigations? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Other than my 
own presumption. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. When he was 
done presuming, assuming, and guess-
ing, Ambassador Sondland finally de-
cided to ask President Trump directly. 
What does the President want from 
Ukraine? 
Here is the answer. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador 
SONDLAND. 
President 
Trump, when I asked him the open-ended 
question, as I testified previously, ‘‘What do 
you want from Ukraine?’’ his answer was ‘‘I 
want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell 
Zelensky to do the right thing.’’ That is all 
I got from President Trump. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. The Presi-
dent 
was 
unequivocal. 
Ambassador 
Sondland stated that this was the final 
word he heard from the President of 
the United States, and once he learned 
this, he text-messaged Ambassadors 
Taylor and Volker: ‘‘The President has 
been crystal clear—no quid pro quos of 
any kind.’’ 
If you are skeptical of Ambassador 
Sondland’s testimony, it was corrobo-
rated by the statement of one of your 
colleagues, Senator JOHNSON. Senator 
JOHNSON had also heard from Ambas-
sador Sondland that the security as-
sistance might be linked to the inves-
tigations. So, on August 31, Senator 
JOHNSON asked the President directly 
whether there was some kind of ar-
rangement where Ukraine would take 
some action and the hold would be lift-
ed. 
Again, President Trump’s answer was 
crystal clear. 
No way. I would never do that. Who told 
you that? 
As Senator JOHNSON wrote: ‘‘I have 
accurately characterized his reaction 
as adamant, vehement, and angry.’’ 
They didn’t tell you about Senator 
JOHNSON’s letter. Why not? 
The Democrats’ entire quid pro quo 
theory is based on nothing more than 
the initial speculation of one person— 
Ambassador Sondland. That specula-
tion is wrong. Despite the Democrats’ 
hopes, the Ambassador’s mistaken be-
lief does not become true merely be-
cause he repeated it many times and, 
apparently, to many people. 
Under Secretary of State David Hale, 
George Kent, and Ambassador Volker 
all testified that there was no connec-
tion whatsoever between security as-
sistance and investigations. 
Here is Ambassador Volker. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. TURNER. You had a meeting with the 
President of the United States, and you be-
lieve that the policy issues that he raised 
concerning Ukraine were valid, correct? 
Ambassador VOLKER. Yes. 
Mr. TURNER. Did the President of the 
United States ever say to you that he was 
not going to allow aid from the United 
States to go to Ukraine unless there were in-
vestigations into Burisma, the Bidens, or the 
2016 elections? 
Ambassador VOLKER. No, he did not. 
Mr. TURNER. Did the Ukrainians ever tell 
you that they understood that they would 
not get a meeting with the President of the 
United States, a phone call with the Presi-
dent of the United States, military aid, or 
foreign aid from the United States unless 
they undertook investigations of Burisma, 
the Bidens, or the 2016 elections? 
Ambassador VOLKER. No, they did not. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. The House 
managers never told you any of this. 
Why not? Why didn’t they show you 
this testimony? Why didn’t they tell 
you about this testimony? Why didn’t 
they put Ambassador Sondland’s testi-
mony in its full and proper context for 
your consideration? Because none of 
this 
fits 
their 
narrative, 
and 
it 
wouldn’t lead to their predetermined 
outcome. 
Thank you for your attention. 
I yield to Mr. Sekulow. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Majority Leader MCCONNELL, 
Democratic Leader SCHUMER, House 
managers, Members of the Senate, let 
me begin by saying that you cannot 
simply decide this case in a vacuum. 
Mr. SCHIFF said yesterday—I believe 
it was his father who said it—you 
should put yourself in someone else’s 
shoes. Let’s, for a moment, put our-
selves in the shoes of the President of 
the United States right now. 
Before he was sworn into office, he 
was subjected to an investigation by 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
called Crossfire Hurricane. The Presi-
dent, within 6 months of his inaugura-
tion, found a special counsel being ap-
pointed to investigate a Russia collu-
sion theory. In their opening state-
ment, several Members of the House 
managers tried to, once again, reliti-
gate the Mueller case. 
Here is the bottom line: This is part 
1 of the Mueller report. This part alone 
is 199 pages. The House managers, in 
their presentation, a couple of times 
referenced a ‘‘this for that.’’ Let me 
tell you something. This cost $32 mil-
lion. This investigation took 2,800 sub-
poenas. This investigation had 500 
search warrants. This had 230 orders for 
communication records. This had 500 
witness interviews—all to reach the 
following conclusion. 
I am going to quote from the Mueller 
report itself—it can be found on page 
173—as relates to this whole matter of 
collusion 
and 
conspiracy: 
‘‘Ulti-
mately,’’ in the words of Bob Mueller 
in his report, ‘‘the investigation did 
not establish that the campaign coordi-
nated or conspired with the Russian 
Government 
in 
its 
election 
inter-
ference activities.’’ 
Let me say that again. This, the 
Mueller report, resulted in this—that 
for this: ‘‘Ultimately, the investigation 
did not establish that the campaign co-
ordinated or conspired with the Rus-
sian Government in its election [-re-
lated] interference activities’’—this for 
that. 
In his summation on Thursday night, 
Manager SCHIFF complained that the 
President chose not to go with the de-
termination of his intelligence agen-
cies regarding hard interference and in-
stead decided that he would listen to 
people he trusted and he would inquire 
about the Ukraine issue himself. Mr. 
SCHIFF did not like the fact that the 
President did not apparently blindly 
trust some of the advice he was being 
given by the intelligence agencies. 
First of all, let me be clear. Dis-
agreeing with the President’s decision 
on foreign policy matters or whose ad-
vice he is going to take is in no way an 
impeachable offense. 
Second, Mr. SCHIFF and Mr. NADLER, 
of all people—because they chaired sig-
nificant 
committees—really 
should 
know this, and they should know what 
is happening. 
Let me remind you of something: 
Just six-tenths of a mile from this 
Chamber sits the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Court, also known as the 
FISA Court. It is the Federal court es-
tablished and authorized under the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act 
to oversee requests by Federal agencies 
for surveillance orders against foreign 
spies inside the United States, includ-
ing American citizens. 
Because of the sensitive nature of its 
business, the court is a more secret

January 25, 2020 
court. Its hearings are closed to the 
public. In this court, there are no de-
fense counsel, no opportunity to cross- 
examine witnesses, and no ability to 
test evidence. The only material the 
court ever sees are those materials 
that are submitted on trust—on trust— 
by members of the intelligence commu-
nity, with the presumption that they 
would be acting in good faith. 
On December 17, 2019, the FISA Court 
issued a scathing order in response to 
the Justice Department inspector gen-
eral’s report on the FBI’s Crossfire 
Hurricane investigation into whether 
or not the Trump campaign was coordi-
nating with Russia. We already know 
the conclusion. That report detailed 
the FBI’s pattern of practice, system-
atic abuses of obtaining surveillance 
order requests, and the process they 
utilized. 
In its order—this is the order from 
the court. I am going to read it. ‘‘This 
order responds to reports that per-
sonnel of the Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation provided false information to 
the National Security Division of the 
Department of Justice, and withheld 
material information from the NSD 
which was detrimental to the FBI’s 
case in connection with four applica-
tions to the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Court.’’ 
When the FBI personnel misled NSD 
in the ways that are described in these 
reports, they equally misled the For-
eign Intelligence Surveillance Court. 
This order has been followed up. 
There has been another order. It was 
declassified just a couple of days ago. 
Thanks in large part— 
The court said— 
to the . . . Office of the Inspector General, 
U.S. Department of Justice, the Court has 
received notice of material misstatements 
and omissions in the applications filed by 
the government in the above-captioned docu-
ments. . . . DOJ assesses that with respect to 
the applications in— 
And it lists two specific docket num-
bers— 
. . . 17–375 and 17–679, ‘‘if not earlier, there 
was insufficient predication to establish 
probable cause to believe that [Carter] Page 
was acting as an agent of a foreign power.’’ 
The President had reason to be con-
cerned about the information he was 
being provided. Now, we could ignore 
this. We could make believe this did 
not happen. But it did. 
As we begin introducing our argu-
ments, I want to correct a couple of 
things in the record as well. That is 
what we are doing today. We really in-
tend to show for the next several days 
that the evidence is actually really 
overwhelming that the President did 
nothing wrong. 
Mr. SCHIFF and his colleagues repeat-
edly told you about the intelligence 
community assessment that Russia 
was acting alone, responsible for the 
election interference, implying that 
this somehow debunked the idea that 
there might be, you know, interference 
from 
other 
countries, 
including 
Ukraine. Mr. NADLER deployed a simi-
lar argument, saying that President 
Trump thought ‘‘Ukraine, not Russia, 
interfered in our last Presidential elec-
tion.’’ And this is basically what we 
call a straw man argument. 
Let me be clear. The House man-
agers, over a 23-hour period, kept push-
ing this false dichotomy that it was ei-
ther Russia or Ukraine but not both. 
They kept telling you that the conclu-
sion of the intelligence community and 
Mr. Mueller was Russia alone with re-
gard to the 2016 elections. 
Of course, that is not—the report 
that Bob Mueller wrote focused on Rus-
sian interference, although there is 
some information in letters regarding 
Ukraine, and I am going to point to 
those in a few moments. In fact, let me 
talk about those letters right now. 
This is a letter dated May 4, 2018, to 
Mr. Yuriy Lutsenko, the general pros-
ecutor for the Office of the Prosecutor 
General of Ukraine. It was a letter re-
questing that his office cooperate with 
the Mueller investigation involving 
issues involving the Ukraine Govern-
ment and law enforcement officials. It 
is signed by Senator MENENDEZ, Sen-
ator LEAHY, and Senator DURBIN. 
I am doing this to put this in an en-
tire perspective. House managers tried 
to tell you that the importance—re-
member the whole discussion—and my 
colleague Mr. Purpura talked about 
this—between President Zelensky and 
President Trump and the bilateral 
meeting in the Oval Office of the White 
House, as if an Article of Impeachment 
could be based upon a meeting not tak-
ing place in the White House but tak-
ing place someplace else, like the 
United 
Nations 
General 
Assembly, 
where it, in fact, did take place. 
Dr. Fiona Hill was quite clear in say-
ing that a White House meeting would 
supply the new Ukrainian Government 
with the ‘‘legitimacy it needed, espe-
cially vis-a-vis the Russians,’’ and that 
Ukraine viewed the White House meet-
ing as a recognition of their legitimacy 
as a sovereign state. But here is what 
they did not play. Here is what they 
did not tell you. And I am going to 
quote from Dr. Hill’s testimony on 
page 145 of her transcript. These are 
her words. This is what she said under 
oath: 
It wasn’t always a White House meeting 
per se, but definitely a Presidential-level, 
you know, meeting with Zelensky and the 
President. I mean, it could’ve taken place in 
Poland, in Warsaw. It could have been, you 
know, a proper bilateral in some other con-
text. But, in other words, a White House- 
level Presidential meeting. 
That can be found on page 145. 
Contrary to what Manager SCHIFF 
and some of the other managers told 
you, this meeting did, in fact, occur. It 
occurred at the U.N. General Assembly 
on September 25, 2019. 
Those were the words of Dr. Hill’s 
that you did not hear. 
This case is really not about Presi-
dential wrongdoing. This entire im-
peachment process is about the House 
managers’ insistence that they are able 
to read everybody’s thoughts, they can 
read everybody’s intentions even when 
the principal speakers, the witnesses 
themselves, insist that those interpre-
tations are wrong. 
Manager SCHIFF, Managers GARCIA 
and DEMINGS relied heavily on selected 
clips from Ambassador Sondland’s tes-
timony. I am not going to replay those. 
My colleague Mr. Purpura played those 
for you. It is clear. We are not going to 
play the same clips seven times. He 
said it. You saw it. That is the evi-
dence. 
Ms. LOFGREN said that, you know, 
numerous witnesses testified that—and 
this is the quote—‘‘that they were not 
provided with any reason for why the 
hold was lifted on September 11,’’ again 
suggesting that the President’s reason 
for the hold—Ukrainian corruption and 
burden-sharing—were somehow created 
after the fact. But, again, as my col-
league just showed you, burden-sharing 
was raised in the transcript itself. 
Mr. SCHIFF stated here that, just like 
the implementation of the hold, Presi-
dent Trump provided no reason for the 
release. This also is wrong. 
In 
their 
testimony, 
Ambassadors 
Sondland and Volker said that the 
President raised his concerns about 
Ukrainian corruption in the May 23, 
2019, meeting with the Ukraine delega-
tion. 
Deputy Defense Secretary Laura Coo-
per testified that she received an email 
in June of 2019 listing followups from a 
meeting between the Secretary of De-
fense Chief of Staff and the President 
relating specifically to Ukrainian secu-
rity assistance, including asking about 
what other countries are contributing. 
Burden-sharing. That can be found in 
Laura Cooper’s deposition, pages 33 and 
34. 
The President mentioned both cor-
ruption and burden-sharing to Senator 
JOHNSON, as you already heard. 
It is also important to note that, as 
Ambassador David Hale testified, for-
eign aid generally was undergoing a re-
view in 2019. From page 84 of his No-
vember 6, 2019, testimony, he said the 
administration ‘‘did not want to take 
a, sort of, business-as-usual approach 
to foreign assistance, a feeling that 
once a country has received a certain 
assistance package, it’s a—it’s some-
thing that continues forever.’’ 
They didn’t talk about that in the 23- 
hour presentation. 
Dr. Fiona Hill confirmed this review 
and testified on November 23, 2019—I 
am going to again quote from page 75 
of her testimony—that ‘‘there had been 
a directive for a whole-scale review of 
our foreign policy—foreign policy as-
sistance, and the ties between our for-
eign policy objectives and that assist-
ance. This had been going on actually 
for many months.’’ 
So multiple witnesses testified that 
the President had longstanding con-
cerns 
and 
specific 
concerns 
about 
Ukraine. The House managers under-
standably—understandably—ignore the 
testimony that took place before their 
own committees.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S574 
January 25, 2020 
In her testimony of October 14, 2019, 
Dr. Hill testified at pages 118 and 119 of 
her transcript that she thinks the 
President has actually quite publicly 
said that he was very skeptical about 
corruption in Ukraine. And then she 
said, again in her testimony, ‘‘And, in 
fact, he’s not alone, because everyone 
has expressed great concerns about cor-
ruption in Ukraine.’’ 
Similarly, Ambassador Yovanovitch 
testified that they all had concerns 
about corruption in Ukraine, and, as 
noted on page 142 of her deposition 
transcript, when asked what she knew 
about the President’s deep-rooted skep-
ticism about Ukraine’s business envi-
ronment, she answered that President 
Trump delivered an anti-corruption 
message to former Ukrainian President 
Poroshenko in their first meeting in 
the White House on June 20, 2017. 
NSC Senior Director Morrison con-
firmed on November 19, 2019, at page 63 
in his testimony transcript, that—this 
was during the Volker, Morrison public 
hearing—that he was aware that the 
President thought Ukraine had a cor-
ruption problem—his words, again— 
and he continued, ‘‘as did many others 
familiar with Ukraine.’’ 
According to her October 30, 2019, tes-
timony, Special Advisor for Ukraine 
Negotiations at the State Department, 
Catherine Croft, also heard the Presi-
dent raise the issue of corruption di-
rectly with then President Poroshenko 
of Ukraine during a bilateral meeting 
at the United Nations General Assem-
bly, this time in September of 2017. 
Special Advisor Croft testified she 
also understood the President’s con-
cern that ‘‘Ukraine is corrupt’’ because 
she has—these are her words—tasked 
to write a paper to help then NSA head 
McMaster, General McMaster, make 
the case to the President in connection 
with prior—prior—security assistance. 
These concerns were entirely justi-
fied. When asked—again, a quote from 
Dr. Hill’s October 14, 2019 hearing tran-
script, ‘‘ . . . certainly eliminating cor-
ruption in Ukraine was one of if not 
the central goal of [U.S.] foreign pol-
icy?’’ 
Does anybody think that one election 
of one President that ran on a reform 
platform who finally gets a majority in 
their legislative body that corruption 
in Ukraine just evaporates? 
That is like looking at this—it goes 
back to the Mueller report. You can’t 
look at these issues in a vacuum. Vir-
tually every witness agreed that con-
fronting corruption is at the forefront 
of U.S. policy. 
Now, I think there is some other 
things we have to understand about the 
timing. This again is according to the 
testimony of Tim Morrison in his testi-
mony. This is when President Zelensky 
was first elected, and these are his 
words. There was real ‘‘concern about 
whether [he] would be a genuine re-
former’’ and ‘‘whether he would genu-
inely try to root out corruption.’’ 
It was also at this time, before the 
election, unclear whether President 
Zelensky’s party would actually be 
able to get a workable majority. I 
think we are all glad that they did, but 
to say that that has been tested or de-
termined that corruption in Ukraine 
has been removed, the Anticorruption 
Court of Ukraine did not commence its 
work until September 5, 2019, 121 days 
ago—4 months ago. We are acting as if 
there was a magic wand, that there was 
a new election and everything was now 
fine. 
I will not—because we are going to 
hear more about it—get into some of 
the meetings the Vice President had. 
You will hear that in the days ahead. 
Manager CROW
said this. What is 
most interesting to me about this was 
that President Trump was only inter-
ested in Ukraine’s aid—nobody else. 
The U.S. provides aid to dozens of 
countries around the world, lots of 
partners and allies. He didn’t ask about 
any of them, just Ukraine. 
I appreciate your service to our coun-
try, I really do. I didn’t serve in the 
military, and I appreciate that, but 
let’s get our facts straight. 
That is what Manager CROW
said. 
Here is what actually happened. Presi-
dent Trump has placed holds on aid a 
number of times. It would just take 
basic due diligence to figure this out. 
In September 2019, the administration 
announced that it was withholding 
over $100 million in aid to Afghanistan 
over concerns about government cor-
ruption. In August 2019, President 
Trump announced that the administra-
tion and Seoul were in talks to sub-
stantially 
increase 
South 
Korea’s 
share—burden sharing—of the expenses 
of U.S. military aid support for South 
Korea. 
In June, President Trump cut or 
paused over $550 million in foreign aid 
to El Salvador, Honduras, and Guate-
mala because those countries were not 
fairly sharing the burden of preventing 
mass migrations to the United States. 
In June, the administration tempo-
rarily paused $105 million in aid to Leb-
anon. The administration lifted that 
hold in December, but one official ex-
plained that the administration contin-
ually reviews and thoroughly evaluates 
the effectiveness of all U.S. foreign as-
sistance to ensure that funds go toward 
activities that further U.S. foreign pol-
icy and also further our national secu-
rity interests, like any administration 
would. 
In September 2018, the administra-
tion canceled the $300 million in mili-
tary aid to Pakistan because it was not 
meeting its counterterrorism obliga-
tions. 
You didn’t hear about any of that 
from my Democratic colleagues, the 
House managers. None of that was dis-
cussed. 
Under Secretary Hale, again, in his 
transcript said that, quote, aid has 
been withheld from several countries 
‘‘across the globe’’ for various reasons. 
Dr. Hill similarly explained that 
there was a freeze put on all kinds of 
aid, also a freeze put on assistance be-
cause, in the process at the time, there 
were an awful lot of reviews going on, 
on foreign assistance. That is the Hill 
deposition transcript. 
She added—this was one of the star 
witnesses of the managers—she added 
that, in her experience, stops and 
starts are sometimes common in for-
eign assistance and that the Office of 
Management and Budget holds up dol-
lars all the time, including the path for 
dollars going to Ukraine in the past. 
Similarly, Ambassador Volker con-
firmed that aid gets held up from time 
to time for a whole assortment of rea-
sons. 
Manager CROW
told you that the 
President’s Ukraine policy was not 
strong against Russia, noting that we 
help our partner fight Russia over 
there so we don’t have to fight Russia 
over here. Our friends are on the 
frontlines in trenches and with sneak-
ers. This was following the Russian in-
vasion of Ukraine in 2014, ‘‘the United 
States has stood by Ukraine,’’ and 
those are your words. 
Well, it is true that the United 
States has stood by Ukraine since the 
invasion of 2014. Only one President 
since then took a very concrete step. 
Some of you supported it. That step in-
cluded actually providing Ukraine with 
lethal weapons including Javelin mis-
siles. That is what President Trump 
did. Some of you in this very room— 
some of you managers—actually sup-
ported that. 
Here is what Ambassador Taylor said 
that you didn’t hear in the 23 hours. 
You didn’t hear this. Javelin missiles 
are ‘‘ . . . serious weapons. They kill 
Russian tanks.’’ 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch 
agreed, 
stating that Ukraine policy under 
President Trump actually got stronger, 
stronger than it was under President 
Obama. 
There were talks about sanctions. 
President Trump has also imposed 
heavy sanctions on Russia. President 
Zelensky thanked him. 
The United States has imposed heavy 
sanctions 
on 
Russia. 
President 
Zelensky thanked him. 
Manager JEFFRIES said that the idea 
that Trump cares about corruption is 
laughable. This is what Dr. Hill said. 
They didn’t play this—‘‘ . . . elimi-
nating corruption in Ukraine was one 
of, if the central goal of U.S. foreign 
policy’’ in Ukraine. 
Let me say that again. Dr. Hill testi-
fied that ‘‘eliminating corruption in 
Ukraine was one of, if [not] the central 
goal 
of 
U.S. 
foreign 
policy 
[in 
Ukraine].’’ If you are taking notes, you 
can find that in the Hill deposition 
transcript 34:7 through 13. 
Dr. Hill also said that she thinks: 
. . . [T]he President has actually quite pub-
licly said that he was very skeptical about 
corruption in Ukraine. And, in fact, he’s not 
alone, because everyone has expressed great 
concerns about corruption in Ukraine. 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch—they 
didn’t play this. She also said ‘‘we all 
had concerns.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S575 
January 25, 2020 
National Security Director Morrison 
confirmed that he ‘‘was aware that the 
President thought Ukraine had a cor-
ruption problem, as did many other 
people familiar with it.’’ 
I am not going to continue to go over 
and over and over again the evidence 
that they did not put before you be-
cause we would be here for a lot longer 
than 24 hours, but to say that the 
President of the United States was not 
concerned about burden sharing, that 
he was not concerned about corruption 
in Ukraine, the facts from their hear-
ing established exactly the opposite. 
The 
President 
wasn’t 
concerned 
about burden sharing? Read all of the 
records. 
And then there was Mr. SCHIFF say-
ing yesterday, maybe we can learn a 
lot more from our Ukrainian ally. 
Let me read you what our Ukrainian 
ally said. President Zelensky, when 
asked about these allegations of quid 
pro quo, he said: 
I think you read everything. I think you 
read the text. We had a good phone call. 
These are his words. 
It was normal. We spoke about many 
things. And so, I think, and you read it, that 
nobody pushed me. 
They think you can read minds. I 
think you look at the words. 
I would yield the balance of my time 
to my colleague, the deputy White 
House counsel Pat Philbin. He is going 
to address two issues. 
We are going to try to do this in a 
very systematic way in the days ahead. 
No. 1, involving issues related to ob-
struction—because this came at the 
end of theirs, so I want to do this in a 
sequence, as it relates to some of the 
subpoenas that were issued. He is also 
going to touch on some of the due proc-
ess issues, since it was at the end of 
theirs and is fresh in everybody’s 
minds. 
Mr. Chief Justice. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, 
Senators, 
Majority 
Leader 
MCCONNELL, Democratic Leader SCHU-
MER: Good morning. As Mr. Sekulow 
said, I am going to touch upon a couple 
of issues related to obstruction and due 
process, just to hit on some points be-
fore we go into more detail in the rest 
of our presentation. 
I would like to start with one of the 
points that Manager JEFFRIES focused 
a lot on toward the end of the presen-
tation yesterday relating to the ob-
struction charge in the second Article 
of Impeachment because he tried to 
portray a picture of what he called 
‘‘blanket defiance,’’ that there was a 
response from the Trump administra-
tion that was simply: We won’t cooper-
ate with anything, we won’t give you 
any documents, we won’t do anything, 
and it was blanket defiance really 
without explanation. That was all 
there was. It was just an assertion that 
we wouldn’t cooperate. 
And he said, and I pulled this from 
the transcript, that President Trump’s 
objections are not generally rooted in 
the law and are not legal arguments. 
That is simply not true. That is sim-
ply not true. In every instance, when 
there was resistance to a subpoena, re-
sistance to a subpoena for a witness or 
for documents, there is a legal expla-
nation and justification for it. 
For example, they focused a lot on an 
October 8 letter from the Counsel for 
the President, Pat Cipollone, but they 
didn’t show you the October 18 letter, 
which is up on the screen now, that 
went through in detail why subpoenas 
that had been issued by Manager 
SCHIFF’s committees were invalid be-
cause the House had not authorized 
their committees to conduct any such 
inquiry or to subpoena information in 
furtherance of it. That is because the 
House had not taken a vote to author-
ize the committee to exercise the 
power of impeachment to issue any 
compulsory process. I am going to get 
into that issue in just a moment. 
Not only was there a legal expla-
nation—a specific reason for every re-
sistance, not just blanket defiance— 
every step that the administration 
took was supported by an opinion from 
the Department of Justice in the Office 
of Legal Counsel. Those are explained 
in our brief, and the major opinion 
from the Office of Legal Counsel is ac-
tually attached in our trial memo-
randum as an appendix. 
Mr. JEFFRIES
and other managers 
also suggested that the Trump admin-
istration took the approach of no nego-
tiation, a blanket refusal, and no at-
tempt to accommodate. That is also 
not true. That is also not true. In the 
October 8 letter that Mr. Cipollone sent 
to Speaker PELOSI, it said explicitly: 
‘‘If the Committees wish to return to 
the regular order of oversight requests, 
we stand ready to engage in that proc-
ess as we have in the past, in a manner 
consistent with well-established bipar-
tisan constitutional protections and a 
respect for the separation of powers en-
shrined in our Constitution.’’ 
It was Manager SCHIFF and his com-
mittees that did not want to engage in 
any accommodation process. We had 
said that we were willing to explore 
that. 
The House managers have also as-
serted a number of times—this came up 
in the first long night when we were 
here until 2 as well—that the Trump 
administration never asserted execu-
tive privilege—never asserted execu-
tive privilege. I explained at the time 
that that is technically true but mis-
leading—misleading because the ra-
tionale on which the subpoenas were 
resisted never depended on an assertion 
of executive privilege. 
Each of the rationales that we have 
offered—and I will go into one of them 
today: that the House subpoenas were 
not authorized—does not depend on 
making that formal assertion of execu-
tive privilege. It is a different legal ra-
tionale. The subpoenas weren’t author-
ized because there was no vote, or the 
subpoenas were to senior advisers to 
the President who are immune from 
congressional compulsion, or the sub-
poenas were forcing executive branch 
officials to testify without the presence 
of agency counsel, which is a separate 
legal infirmity again supported by an 
opinion from the Office of Legal Coun-
sel at the Department of Justice. 
Let me turn to the specific issue of 
the invalidity of the subpoenas because 
they weren’t supported by a vote of the 
House authorizing Manager SCHIFF’s 
committee to exercise the power of im-
peachment to issue compulsory proc-
ess. 
Manager JEFFRIES
said that there 
were no Supreme Court precedents sug-
gesting such a requirement and that 
every investigation into a Presidential 
impeachment in history has begun 
without a vote from the House, and 
those statements simply aren’t accu-
rate. 
There is Supreme Court precedent ex-
plaining very clearly the principle that 
a committee of either House of Con-
gress gets its authority only by a reso-
lution from the parent body. United 
States v. Rumely and Watkins v. 
United States make this very clear. 
And it is common sense. The Constitu-
tion assigns the sole power of impeach-
ment to the House of Representatives— 
to the House, not to any Member and 
not to a subcommittee—and that au-
thority can be delegated to a com-
mittee to use only by a vote of the 
House. 
It would be the same here in the Sen-
ate. The Senate has the sole power to 
try impeachments. But if there were no 
rules that had been adopted by the 
Senate, would you think that the ma-
jority leader himself could simply de-
cide that he would have a committee 
receive evidence, handle that, submit a 
recommendation to the Senate, and 
that would be the way the trial would 
occur, without a vote from the Senate 
to give authority to that committee? I 
don’t think so. It doesn’t make sense. 
That is not the way the Constitution 
assigns that authority, and it is the 
same in the House. 
Here, there was no vote to authorize 
the committee to exercise the power of 
impeachment. And this law has been 
boiled down by the DC Circuit in Exxon 
Corp. v. FTC to explain it this way: 
‘‘To issue a valid subpoena, . . . a com-
mittee or subcommittee must conform 
strictly to the resolution establishing 
its investigatory powers.’’ 
There must be a resolution voted on 
by the parent body to give the com-
mittee that power. And the problem 
here is, there is no standing rule. There 
was no standing authority giving Man-
ager SCHIFF’s committee the authority 
to use the power of impeachment to 
issue compulsory process. Rule X of the 
House discusses legislative authority. 
It doesn’t mention impeachment. That 
is why, in every Presidential impeach-
ment in history, the House has initi-
ated the inquiry by voting to give a 
committee the authority to pursue 
that inquiry. 
Contrary to what Manager JEFFRIES 
suggested, there has always been, in

S576 
January 25, 2020 
every Presidential impeachment in-
quiry, a vote from the full House to au-
thorize the committee, and that is the 
only way the inquiry begins. 
There were three different votes for 
the impeachment of President Andrew 
Johnson—in January 1867, in March 
1867, and in February 1868. 
For President Nixon, Chairman Ro-
dino of the House Judiciary Committee 
explained—there was a move to have 
them issue subpoenas after the Satur-
day Night Massacre, and they deter-
mined that they did not have that au-
thority in the House Judiciary Com-
mittee without a vote from the House, 
and he determined, as he explained, 
that ‘‘such a resolution has always 
been passed by the House. . . . It is a 
necessary step if we are to meet our ob-
ligations.’’ 
There has been reference to inves-
tigatory activities starting in the 
House Judiciary Committee in the 
Nixon impeachment prior to the vote 
from the House, but all that the com-
mittee was doing was assembling pub-
licly available information and infor-
mation that had been gathered by 
other congressional committees. There 
was never an attempt to issue compul-
sory process until there had been a 
vote by the House to give the House 
Judiciary Committee that authority. 
Similarly, in the Clinton impeach-
ment, there were two votes from the 
full House to give the House Judiciary 
Committee authority to proceed: first 
a vote on resolution 525 just to allow 
the committee to examine the inde-
pendent counsel report and make rec-
ommendations on how to proceed and 
then a separate resolution, H. Res. 581, 
that gave the House Judiciary Com-
mittee subpoena authority. 
At the time, in the House report, the 
House Judiciary Committee explained: 
Because the issue of impeachment is of 
such overwhelming importance, the com-
mittee decided that it must receive author-
ization from the full House before proceeding 
on any further course of action. Because im-
peachment is delegated solely to the House 
of Representatives by the Constitution, the 
full House of Representatives should be in-
volved in critical decisionmaking regarding 
various stages of impeachment. 
Here, the House Democrats skipped 
over that step completely. What they 
had instead was simply a press con-
ference with Speaker PELOSI announc-
ing that she was directing committees 
to proceed with an impeachment in-
quiry against the President of the 
United States. 
Speaker PELOSI didn’t have the au-
thority to delegate the power of the 
House to those committees on her own. 
So why does it matter? It matters be-
cause the Constitution places that au-
thority in the House and ensures that 
there is a democratic check on the ex-
ercise of that authority and that there 
will have to be a vote by the full House 
before there can be a proceeding to 
start inquiring into impeaching the 
President of the United States. 
One of the things that the Framers 
were most concerned about in impeach-
ment was the potential for a partisan 
impeachment—a 
partisan 
impeach-
ment that was being pushed merely by 
a faction—and a way to ensure a check 
on that is to require democratic ac-
countability from the full House, to 
have a vote from the entire House be-
fore any impeachment can proceed. 
That didn’t happen here. It was only 
after 5 weeks of hearings that the 
House decided to have a vote. 
What that meant, at the outset, was 
that all of the subpoenas that were 
issued under the law of the Supreme 
Court cases I discussed—all those sub-
poenas were invalid, and that is what 
the Trump administration pointed out 
specifically to the House. That was the 
reason for not responding to them, be-
cause under long-settled precedent, 
there had to be a vote from the House 
to give authority, and the administra-
tion would not respond to subpoenas 
that were invalid. 
The next point I would like to touch 
on briefly has to do with due process 
because we heard from the House man-
agers that they offered the President 
due process at the House Judiciary 
Committee. Manager NADLER described 
it as that he sent the President a let-
ter—the President’s counsel a letter— 
offering to allow the President to par-
ticipate, and the President’s counsel 
just refused, as if that was the only ex-
change, and there was just a blanket 
refusal to participate. 
Let me explain what actually hap-
pened. I should note before I get into 
those details that there was a sugges-
tion also that due process is not re-
quired in the House proceeding and 
that it is simply a privilege, but that 
wasn’t the position Manager NADLER 
has taken in the past. In 2016, he said: 
The power of impeachment is a solemn re-
sponsibility, assigned to the House by the 
Constitution, and to this committee by our 
peers. That responsibility demands a rig-
orous level of due process. 
In the Clinton impeachment in 1998, 
he explained: 
What does due process mean? It means, 
among other things, the right to confront 
the witnesses against you, to call your own 
witnesses, and to have the assistance of 
counsel. 
Now, I think we all know that all of 
those rights were denied to the Presi-
dent in the first two rounds of hear-
ings—the first round of secret hearings 
in the basement bunker where Manager 
SCHIFF had three committees holding 
hearings and then in a round of public 
hearings to take the testimony that 
had been screened in the basement 
bunker and have it in a public televised 
setting, which was totally unprece-
dented in any Presidential impeach-
ment inquiry—in both the Clinton and 
the Nixon inquiries. For every public 
hearing, the President was allowed to 
be represented by counsel and cross-ex-
amine witnesses. 
But the House managers say that is 
all right because when we got to the 
third round of hearings, after people 
had testified twice, then we were going 
to allow the President to have some 
due process. But the way that played 
out was this: First, they scheduled a 
hearing for December 4 that was going 
to hear solely from law professors. By 
the time they wanted the President to 
commit whether he would participate, 
it was unclear—they couldn’t specify 
how many law professors or who the 
law professors were going to be, and 
the President’s counsel wrote back and 
declined to participate in that. 
But at the same time, Manager NAD-
LER had asked what other rights under 
the House Resolution 660—the rules 
governing 
the 
House 
inquiry—the 
President would like to exercise. The 
President’s counsel wrote back asking 
specific questions in order to be able to 
make an informed decision and asked 
whether you intend to allow fact wit-
nesses to be called, including the wit-
nesses who had been requested by 
HPSCI Ranking Member NUNES; wheth-
er you intend to allow members of the 
Judiciary Committee and the Presi-
dent’s counsel a right to cross-examine 
fact witnesses; and whether your Re-
publican colleagues on the Judiciary 
Committee will be allowed to call wit-
nesses of their choosing. Manager NAD-
LER didn’t respond to that letter. There 
wasn’t information provided. 
We had discussions with the staff on 
the Judiciary Committee to try to find 
out what were the plans and what were 
the hearings going to be like. The way 
the week played out, on December 4, 
there was the hearing with the law pro-
fessors—the first hearing before the Ju-
diciary Committee—and on December 
5, the morning of December 5, Speaker 
PELOSI announced the conclusion of the 
entire Judiciary Committee process be-
cause she announced that she was di-
recting Chairman NADLER to draft Ar-
ticles of Impeachment. So the conclu-
sion of the whole process was already 
set. 
Then, after the close of business on 
the 5th, we learned from the staff that 
the committee had no plans, other 
than a hearing on December 9, to hear 
from staffers who had prepared HPSCI 
committee reports. They had no plans 
to have other hearings, no plans to 
hear from fact witnesses, and no plans 
to do any factual investigation. 
So the President was given a choice 
of participating in a process that was 
going to already have the outcome de-
termined—the Speaker had already 
said Articles of Impeachment were 
going to be drafted—and there were no 
plans to hear from any fact witnesses. 
That is not due process. That is why 
the President declined to participate in 
that process, because the Judiciary 
Committee had already decided they 
were going to accept an ex parte record 
developed in Manager SCHIFF’s process, 
and there was no point in participating 
in that. So the idea that there was due 
process offered to the President is sim-
ply not accurate.

conference until the Judiciary Com-
mittee began marking up Articles of

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S577 
January 25, 2020 
Impeachment on December 11, lasted 78 
days. It is the fastest investigatory 
process for a Presidential impeachment 
in history. 
For 71 days of that process, for 71 
days of the hearing and taking of depo-
sitions and hearing testimony, the 
President was completely locked out. 
He couldn’t be represented by counsel. 
He couldn’t cross-examine witnesses. 
He 
couldn’t 
present 
evidence. 
He 
couldn’t present witnesses for 71 of the 
78 days. That is not due process. 
It goes to a point that Mr. Cipollone 
raised earlier. Why would you have a 
process like that? What does that tell 
you about the process? 
As we pointed out a couple of times, 
cross-examination in our legal system 
is regarded as the greatest legal engine 
ever invented for the discovery of 
truth. It is essential. The Supreme 
Court has said in Goldberg v. Kelly, for 
any determination that is important, 
that requires determining facts, cross- 
examination has been one of the keys 
for due process. 
Why did they design a mechanism 
here where the President was locked 
out and denied the ability to cross-ex-
amine witnesses? It is because they 
weren’t really interested in getting at 
the facts and the truth. They had a 
timetable to meet. They wanted to 
have impeachment done by Christmas, 
and that is what they were striving to 
do. 
Now, as a slight shift in gears, I want 
to touch on one last point before I 
yield to one of my colleagues, and that 
relates to the whistleblower—the whis-
tleblower, whom we haven’t heard that 
much about—who started all of this. 
We know from a letter that the inspec-
tor general of the intelligence commu-
nity sent that he thought the whistle-
blower had political bias. We don’t 
know exactly what the political bias 
was because the inspector general tes-
tified in the House committee in an ex-
ecutive session, and that transcript is 
still secret. It wasn’t transmitted up to 
the House Judiciary Committee. We 
haven’t seen it. We don’t know what is 
in it. We don’t know what he was asked 
and what he revealed about the whis-
tleblower. 
Now, you would think that before 
going forward with an impeachment 
proceeding against the President of the 
United States, that you would want to 
find out something about the com-
plaint that had started this, because 
motivations, bias, reasons for wanting 
to bring this complaint could be rel-
evant. But there wasn’t any inquiry 
into that. 
Recent reports, public reports sug-
gest that, potentially, the whistle-
blower was an intelligence community 
staffer who worked with then-Vice 
President Biden on Ukraine matters, 
which, if true, would suggest an even 
greater reason for wanting to know 
about potential bias or motive for the 
whistleblower. 
At first, when things started, it 
seemed like everyone agreed that we 
should hear from the whistleblower, in-
cluding Manager SCHIFF. 
I think we have what he said. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. SCHIFF. But, yes, we would love to 
talk directly to the whistleblower. 
We will get the unfiltered testimony from 
the whistleblower. 
We don’t need the whistleblower. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Now, what 
changed? At first, Manager SCHIFF 
agreed we should hear the unfiltered 
testimony from the whistleblower, but 
then he changed his mind, and he sug-
gested that it was because now we had 
the transcript. But the second clip 
there was from September 29, which 
was 4 days after the transcript had 
been released. But there was something 
that came into play, and that was 
something Manager SCHIFF
had said 
earlier when he was asked about 
whether he had spoken to the whistle-
blower. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. SCHIFF. We have not spoken directly 
with the whistleblower. We would like to. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. It turned out 
that that statement was not truthful. 
Around October 2 or 3, it was exposed 
that Manager SCHIFF’s staff, at least, 
had spoken with the whistleblower be-
fore the whistleblower filed the com-
plaint and potentially had given some 
guidance of some sort to the whistle-
blower, and after that point, it became 
critical to shut down any inquiry into 
the whistleblower. 
During the House hearings, of course, 
Manager SCHIFF was in charge. He was 
chairing the hearings. That creates a 
real problem from a due-process per-
spective and from a search-for-the 
truth perspective because he was an in-
terested fact witness at that point. He 
had a reason—since he had been caught 
out saying something that wasn’t 
truthful about that contact—to not 
want that inquiry, and it was he who 
ensured that there wasn’t any inquiry 
into that. 
I think this is relevant here because, 
as you have heard from my colleagues, 
a lot of what we have heard over the 
past 23 hours, over the past 3 days, has 
been from Chairman SCHIFF. He has 
been telling you things like what is in 
President Trump’s head and what is in 
President Zelensky’s head. It is all his 
interpretation of the facts and the evi-
dence, trying to pull inferences out of 
things. 
There is another statement that 
Chairman SCHIFF made that I think we 
have on video. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. TODD. But you admit all you have 
right now is a circumstantial case? 
Mr. SCHIFF. Actually, no, Chuck. I can 
tell you that the case is more than that. And 
I can’t go into the particulars, but there is 
more than circumstantial evidence now. So, 
again, I think— 
Mr. TODD. So you have seen direct evi-
dence of collusion? 
Mr. SCHIFF. I don’t want to go into spe-
cifics, but I will say that there is evidence 
that is not circumstantial and is very much 
worthy of investigation. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. So that was in 
March of 2017, when Chairman SCHIFF, 
as ranking member of HPSCI, was tell-
ing the public—the American public— 
that he had more than circumstantial 
evidence, 
through 
his 
position 
on 
HPSCI, that President Trump’s cam-
paign had colluded with Russia. 
Now, of course, as Mr. Sekulow 
pointed out, after $32 million and over 
500 search warrants—roughly 500 search 
warrants—the Mueller report deter-
mined that there was no collusion, that 
that wasn’t true. 
We wanted to point these things out 
simply 
for 
this 
reason: 
Chairman 
SCHIFF
has made so much of the 
House’s case about the credibility of 
interpretations that the House man-
agers want to place on not hard evi-
dence but on inferences. They want to 
tell 
you 
what 
President 
Trump 
thought. They want to tell you: Don’t 
believe what Zelensky says; we can tell 
you what Zelensky actually thought. 
Don’t believe what the other Ukrain-
ians actually said about not be being 
pressured; we can tell you what they 
actually thought. 
This is very relevant to know wheth-
er the assessments of evidence that he 
presented in the past are accurate. We 
would submit they have not been, and 
that that is relevant for your consider-
ation. 
With that, I yield to my colleague, 
Mr. Cipollone. 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, I have 
good news: just a few more minutes 
from us today. But I want to point out 
a couple of points. 
No. 1, just to follow up on what Mr. 
Philbin just told you, do you know who 
else didn’t show up in the Judiciary 
Committee to answer questions about 
his report in the way Ken Starr did in 
the Clinton impeachment? Ken Starr 
was subjected to cross-examination by 
the President’s counsel. Do you know 
who didn’t show up in the Judiciary 
Committee? Chairman SCHIFF. He did 
not show up. He did not give Chairman 
NADLER the respect of appearing before 
his committee and answering questions 
from his committee. He did send staff, 
but why didn’t he show up? That is an-
other good question you should think 
about. 
They have come here today, and they 
basically said: Let’s cancel an election 
over a meeting with Ukraine. And, as 
my colleagues have shown, they failed 
to give you key facts about a meeting 
and lots of other evidence that they 
produced themselves. 
Let’s talk about the meeting. They 
said it was all about an invitation to a 
meeting. If you look at the first tran-
script—at 
the 
first 
transcript—the 
President said to President Zelensky: 
When you’re settled and you’re ready, I’d 
like to invite you to the White House. We’ll 
have a lot of things to talk about, but we are 
with you all the way. 
President Zelensky said: 
Well, thank you for the invitation. We ac-
cept the invitation, and look forward to the 
visit. Thank you again.

January 25, 2020 
Then, President Zelensky got a letter 
on May 29 inviting him, again, to come 
to the White House. Then, going back 
to the transcript of the July 25 call— 
again, a part of the call that they 
didn’t talk to you about—President 
Trump said: 
Whenever you would like to come to the 
White House, feel free to call. Give us a date, 
and we’ll work that out. I look forward to 
seeing you. 
President Zelensky replied: 
Thank you very much. I would be very 
happy to come and would be happy to meet 
with you personally and get to know you 
better. I am looking forward to our meeting 
and I also would like to invite you to visit 
Ukraine and come to the city of Kyiv which 
is a beautiful city. We have a beautiful coun-
try which would welcome you. 
Then he said: 
On the other hand, I believe that on Sep-
tember 1 we will be in Poland and we can 
meet in Poland hopefully. 
Now, they didn’t read to you that 
part of the transcript, and they didn’t 
tell you what happened. A meeting in 
Poland 
was 
scheduled. 
President 
Trump was scheduled to go to Poland. 
He was scheduled to meet with Presi-
dent Zelensky. 
What happened? President Trump 
couldn’t go to Poland. Why? Because 
there was a hurricane in the United 
States. He thought it would be better 
for him to stay here to help deal with 
the hurricane. So the Vice President 
went. 
Why didn’t they tell you that? Why 
didn’t they tell you that President 
Zelensky suggested: Hey, how about we 
meet in Poland? 
Why didn’t they tell you that that 
meeting was scheduled and had to be 
canceled for a hurricane. Why? That 
was our first question that we asked 
you. You heard a lot of facts that they 
didn’t tell you—facts that are critical, 
facts that they know completely col-
lapse their case on the facts. 
Now, you heard a lot from them: You 
are not going to hear facts from the 
President’s 
lawyers. 
They 
are 
not 
going to talk to you about the facts. 
That is all we have done today. Ask 
yourself—ask yourself: Given the facts 
you have heard today that they didn’t 
tell you, who doesn’t want to talk 
about the facts? Who doesn’t want to 
talk about the facts? 
The American people paid a lot of 
money for those facts. They paid a lot 
of money for this investigation. And 
they didn’t bother to tell you. Ask 
yourself why. If they don’t want to be 
fair to the President, at least out of re-
spect for all of you, they should be fair 
to you. They should tell you these 
things. And when they don’t tell you 
these things, it means something. So 
think 
about 
that. 
Impeachment 
shouldn’t be a shell game. They should 
give you the facts. 
That is all we have for today. We ask 
you, out of respect, to think about it. 
Think about whether what you have 
heard would really suggest to anybody 
anything other than it would be a com-
pletely irresponsible abuse of power to 
do what they are asking you to do—to 
stop an election, to interfere in an elec-
tion, and then to remove the President 
of the United States from the ballot. 
Let the people decide for themselves. 
That is what the Founders wanted. 
That is what we should all want. 
With that, I thank you for your at-
tention, and I look forward to seeing 
you on Monday.
