PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Lord of the universe, thank You for 
giving us another day. 
This morning, I turn toward the word 
of the psalmist who wrote roughly 25 
centuries ago: ‘‘Lord, look toward us 
and have pity on us, for we are much 
afflicted. 
‘‘Relieve the troubles of our hearts 
and bring us out of our distress. 
‘‘Put an end to our affliction and suf-
fering, and take away all our sins. 
‘‘Preserve our lives and rescue us. 
‘‘Let us not be put to shame, for we 
take refuge in You.’’ 
Where we carry guilt for our Nation’s 
woes, help us to see and turn toward 
healing and repentance. Where we have 
been wronged, help us to turn toward 
forgiveness. For our leaders, local and 
national, enlighten them with the wis-
dom and courage to address injustice 
where it resides and bring peace and 
healing into our communities. 
May true leaders and prophets arise 
in our times. Lord, have mercy on us. 
Bless us all this day and every day, 
and may all that we do and can do for 
our neighbors be for Your greater 
honor and glory. 
Amen.

COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
CLERK OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives: 
OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, May 29, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
The Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Pursuant to the 
permission granted in Clause 2(h) of Rule II 
of the Rules of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives, I have the honor to transmit a sealed 
envelope received from the White House on 
May 29, 2020 at 5:12 p.m., said to contain a 
message from the President returning with-
out his approval H.J. Res. 76, a Joint Resolu-
tion providing for congressional disapproval 
under chapter 8 of title 5, United States 
Code, of the rule submitted by the Depart-
ment of Education relating to ‘‘Borrower De-
fense Institutional Accountability’’. 
With best wishes, I am, 
Sincerely, 
GLORIA J. LETT, 
Deputy Clerk of the House. 
PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL 
DISAPPROVAL 
OF 
RULE 
SUB-
MITTED 
BY 
DEPARTMENT 
OF 
EDUCATION RELATING TO ‘‘BOR-
ROWER 
DEFENSE 
INSTITU-
TIONAL 
ACCOUNTABILITY’’— 
VETO 
MESSAGE 
FROM 
THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116–131) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following veto mes-
sage from the President of the United 
States: 
To the House of Representatives: 
I am returning herewith without my 
approval H.J. Res. 76, a joint resolution 
that would undermine the efforts of my 
Administration to protect students and 
taxpayers by nullifying the Borrower 
Defense Institutional Accountability 
Regulation, which the Department of 
Education published in the Federal Reg-
ister on September 23, 2019, following 
extensive public hearings and public 
comment. 
The Borrower Defense Institutional 
Accountability rule sets forth clear 
standards for borrower defense to re-
payment, 
providing 
needed 
trans-
parency to both students and schools. 
Under this rule, a fair process will de-
liver 
deserved 
relief 
to 
students 
harmed by their educational institu-
tions. Whereas the last administration 
promoted a regulatory environment 
that produced precipitous school clo-
sures and stranded students, this new 
rule puts the needs of students first, 
extends the window during which they 
can qualify for loan discharge, and en-
courages schools to provide students 
with opportunities to complete their 
educations and continue their pursuit 
of economic success. H.J. Res. 76 would 
return the country to a regulatory re-
gime in which the Federal Government 
and State attorneys general, rather 
than students, determine the kinds of 
education students need and which 
schools they should be allowed to at-
tend.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2362 
June 1, 2020 
American 
higher 
education 
must 
transform to better meet the needs of 
today’s students. My Administration 
stands ready to work with the Congress 
to foster the development of a more af-
fordable, more flexible, and more inno-
vative system of higher education that 
is better able to meet the educational 
needs of our students, and in which 
schools take on more responsibility for 
the success of the students who enroll 
in their programs. 
H.J. Res. 76 is a misguided resolution 
that would increase costs for American 
students and undermine their ability 
to make choices about their education 
in order to best meet their needs. For 
these reasons, it is my duty to return 
H.J. Res. 76 to the House of Represent-
atives without my approval. 
DONALD J. TRUMP.
THE WHITE HOUSE, May 29, 2020. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The ob-
jection of the President will be spread 
at large upon the Journal, and the veto 
message and the joint resolution will 
be printed as a House document. 
Pursuant to section 3 of House Reso-
lution 981, further consideration of the 
veto message and the joint resolution 
will be postponed until Wednesday, 
July 1, 2020.

S2623 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, JUNE 1, 2020 
No. 101 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, who has placed our 
tears in a bottle, today we weep. We 
weep because every death diminishes 
us. We weep because of the grief of 
George Floyd’s family. We weep be-
cause of the explosive impact of de-
ferred dreams. We weep because of the 
potentially catastrophic consequences 
of peaceful protesting during a pan-
demic. We weep because justice delayed 
is justice denied. We weep because of 
the paralysis of analysis that often im-
pedes Your prevailing providence. We 
weep because of our personal culpa-
bility during these tragic times. We 
weep because of our sins of commission 
and omission. We weep because we 
know You are weeping. 
Today, use Your lawmakers for Your 
glory. May they strive to find a vaccine 
to inoculate our Nation against hate, 
sin, and despair. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to address the Sen-
ate for 1 minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
REMEMBERING GEORGE FLOYD 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, our 
Nation 
is 
hurting. 
George 
Floyd’s 
death was horrific, and justice must be 
served. The Justice Department has 
opened an investigation, and the officer 
has been charged with murder. 
A single act of violence at the hands 
of an officer is one too many. George 
Floyd deserved better. All Black Amer-
icans do. Indeed, all Americans do. The 
last thing we need is more pain, more 
devastation, and more injustice. 
As a country, let’s strive for compas-
sion and listening to others. The best 
way to honor George Floyd is to en-
gage with all members of our commu-
nity, including Members of this body, 
on how to heal these wounds. This is an 
opportunity for Congress to discuss 
what reforms can and should be made 
to address police use of force. Let’s 
move forward and protect our commu-
nities together. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
PROTESTS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, this 
is an hour of great pain and unrest in 
our country. Americans from coast to 
coast have been grieved and horrified 
by the killings of three African-Amer-
ican citizens: Ahmaud Arbery in Geor-
gia, Breonna Taylor in my hometown 
of Louisville, KT, and George Floyd in 
Minneapolis. 
In each disturbing situation, inves-
tigations and reviews are ongoing. In 
Kentucky, I am glad that local au-
thorities are investigating, I am glad 
the FBI is involved, and I am glad our 
attorney general is committed to tak-
ing any necessary action. We need the 
truth, and we need swift justice under 
law. But here is something that re-
quires no investigation: In no world 
whatsoever should arresting a man for 
an alleged minor infraction involve a 
police officer putting his knee on a 
man’s neck for 9 minutes while he cries 
out ‘‘I can’t breathe’’ and then goes si-
lent. 
To me, to a great many of my fellow 
Kentuckians, and to millions of out-
raged 
Americans, 
these 
disturbing 
events do not look like three isolated 
incidents. They look more like the lat-
est chapter in our national struggle to 
make equal justice and equal protec-
tion of the law into facts of life for all 
Americans, rather than contingencies 
that sometimes depend on the color of 
one’s skin. Obviously, this struggle re-
mains incomplete. 
I have spent decades in the Senate 
not only as an advocate for civil rights 
but as a First Amendment purist. So I 
completely support and fully defend 
citizens’ constitutional rights to speak 
their minds and engage in peaceful pro-
tests. Our Nation cannot deafen itself 
to the anger, pain, or the frustration of 
Black Americans. Our Nation needs to 
hear this. 
Yet, over the last several days, citi-
zens have watched with horror as cities 
across America have convulsed with 
looting, riots, and destruction. On a 
nightly basis, initially peaceful dem-
onstrations have been hijacked. Ameri-
cans have watched protests dedicated 
to ending unjust violence mutate into 
riots that inflict unjust violence them-
selves. We have seen small businesses 
destroyed and public property defaced. 
We have seen the men and women of 
law enforcement—the vast majority of 
whom are not bad actors but brave 
public servants—threatened and as-
saulted on our streets. 
Free speech and peaceful protest are 
central American liberties. Looting, ri-
oting, assault, and arson are violent 
crimes that have no place—no place— 
whatsoever in our society. It is not a 
display of courageous citizenship to 
smash and destroy small businesses 
that had just barely hung on through 
the pandemic. It is not an act of prin-
cipled protest to grab expensive mer-
chandise or set fire to a church. It does

not advance freedom or justice to van-
dalize the World War II Memorial that 
stands for those who bled and died for 
exactly those values. You do not ad-
vance peace by committing assault. 
You do not advance justice by inflict-
ing injustice upon your neighbors. You 
do not promote the rule of law through 
anarchy. There is no constitutional 
right to commit violent crime or to 
terrorize communities, period. 
This cannot continue. It has already 
gone on for entirely too long. I hope 
State and local authorities will work 
quickly to crack down on outside agi-
tators and domestic terrorists and re-
store some order to our cities. If State 
and local leaders cannot or will not se-
cure the peace and protect citizens and 
their property, I hope the Federal Gov-
ernment is ready to stand in the 
breach. 
In Kentucky, we are already seeing 
violence and tragedy compound on 
themselves. Several days ago, seven 
people were shot in Louisville—none, 
according to the mayor, by law en-
forcement. Last night, one individual 
was shot and killed by authorities after 
the police were fired upon from within 
a crowd. We are learning about the in-
cident as fast as we can. I was just 
briefed by Governor Beshear today, and 
I support a full and thorough and im-
mediate investigation. But this has to 
end. 
These important protests began with 
the notion that basic physical safety 
and legal protections must be non-ne-
gotiable for every single American, bar 
none; that American liberty and the 
rule of law must be universal truths for 
all, not special privileges for some. 
That point is absolutely right. That is 
a righteous and important mission. 
And it is exactly why these senseless 
and destructive riots need to end. Not 
next week. Not tomorrow night. Right 
now. Right now. 
We have real work to do to build con-
structive paths forward between law 
enforcement and affected communities. 
More violence and destruction is not 
just unfair to many innocent people, it 
also just makes this important work so 
much harder. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
an entirely different matter, these 
events only compound what has al-
ready been a historically challenging 
time for our country. 
As our Nation continues to combat 
and contain the coronavirus, the Sen-
ate will continue to lead the response. 
To name one example, I hope and an-
ticipate the Senate will soon take up 
and pass legislation that just passed 
the House by an overwhelming vote of 
417 to 1 to further strengthen the Pay-
check Protection Program so it con-
tinues working for small businesses 
that need our help. 
Even as we fight the pandemic, we 
will remember that other challenges 
face our Nation as well. Foreign adver-
saries are all too eager to exploit a dis-
tracted world. 
In recent days, agents of the Chinese 
Communist Party have taken to social 
media to openly taunt—openly taunt— 
the United States and defend their vio-
lent crackdown on the autonomy of 
Hong Kong. 
It has been almost a year since the 
world watched Hongkongers embark on 
the latest round of peaceful demonstra-
tions against the repressive grip of the 
Chinese Communist Party. The world 
watched as Hong Kong voters, with 
American flags in hand, dealt crushing 
defeats to Beijing’s preferred puppet 
candidates in elections last fall. But in 
recent weeks, as the coronavirus pan-
demic that China exacerbated has 
dominated the world’s attention, the 
Chinese Communist Party is trying yet 
again to tighten their grip. New laws— 
supposedly related to national secu-
rity—aim to stifle dissent and curtail 
Hongkongers’ civil liberties. 
When I authored the U.S.-Hong Kong 
Policy Act way back in 1992, we wanted 
to ensure future Chinese regimes would 
respect the promises made regarding 
this unique, autonomous region, so we 
made sure the weight and suasion of 
the United States of America would 
stand with Hongkongers if need be. 
Unfortunately, 
these 
years 
later, 
such a time is upon us. Among other 
examples, we received word today that 
for the first time in 30 years—30 
years—authorities in Hong Kong will 
not allow the annual candlelight vigil 
that commemorates the Tiananmen 
Square massacre to occur. For the first 
time in 30 years, no commemoration of 
the Tiananmen massacre will occur in 
Hong Kong. For three decades, Hong 
Kong has been the only place in China 
where full-scale remembrances of the 
massacre are permitted, but now they, 
too, will be going dark. 
So I am encouraged that Secretary 
Pompeo is tapping into that law to for-
mally certify that Beijing’s systemic 
efforts to interfere in Hong Kong have 
eroded the region’s autonomy. I might 
say this is exactly what we were con-
cerned about back in 1992 when the 
Hong Kong Policy Act was introduced 
by me and became law—exactly what 
we feared. 
I hope that the administration will 
soon identify the specific ways it will 
impose costs on Beijing and, just as im-
portant, continue American support for 
the people of Hong Kong. Under my 
original legislation, several tools are 
available. Their primary aim is to be 
an effective friend and partner for 
Hongkongers who share values of de-
mocracy and freedom and to help pre-
serve the region’s unique character, au-
tonomy, and prosperity. 
Our Nation’s commitment to those 
efforts must remain ironclad, and it 
must be 100 percent clear that the re-
sponsibility 
for 
threatening 
Hong 
Kong’s economic, political, and social 
climate rests solely and squarely on 
the Chinese Communist Party—the re-
gime that views free thought as a fun-
damental evil; the regime that sees 
peaceful demonstrations as an existen-
tial challenge. That is who is to blame 
for this, no matter what the Com-
munist Party’s two-bit propaganda is 
trying to claim—not the people of 
Hong Kong, not their friends in the 
United States, just the would-be ty-
rants in Beijing. 
Last year, as Congress passed Sen-
ator RUBIO’s update to my Hong Kong 
Policy Act, I also secured additional 
funding to provide legal protections to 
Hong Kong protestors and support de-
mocracy promotion activities. But if 
China moves in the coming days and 
weeks to implement its draconian new 
laws that strangle Hong Kong, there 
will be no rule of law left for protesters 
to appeal to. That is why the U.S. re-
sponse should mirror those of other de-
mocracies that open their doors to 
Hongkongers fleeing oppression. Our 
Nation has a rich heritage of standing 
as a beacon of light and freedom, from 
refugees of war to those escaping the 
Iron Curtain. We should exercise it 
again for the people of Hong Kong. 
Finally, while we address these latest 
aggressions, we must not miss the 
broader lessons. The Communist Party 
of China does not play by the rules. 
They don’t—not the rules of the inter-
national economy; not the rules of its 
bilateral agreements with other na-
tions; not even its own rules, which are 
increasingly subject to the whims of 
President Xi. 
Whether they are cracking down on 
Hong Kong, trying to cover up a pan-
demic, or herding ethnic and religious 
minorities into modern-day gulags, 
this generation of Chinese leadership is 
telling the rest of the world every sin-
gle day exactly who they are—exactly 
who they are. 
America and the world have watched 
China deepen its tyranny at home, as-
sert its hegemony abroad, and under-
mine basic norms that protect the 
peace. The question before us is, What 
will we do to stop it?

tion having been heard, the bills will be

PROTESTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, 1 
week ago today, a White police officer 
in Minneapolis, MN, knelt on the neck 
of an African-American man named 
George Floyd, pinning him to the 
ground for over 8 minutes as he pled for 
his life. The officer callously refused to 
heed those calls, standing up only after 
Mr. Floyd was unresponsive. Mr. Floyd 
was pronounced dead shortly there-
after. It was 8 minutes—8 minutes— 
that he was pinned there. 
Today, 8 days later, our Nation is 
reeling. It is reeling over the injustice 
and senselessness of George Floyd’s 
death, reeling over the memory of 
Ahmaud 
Arbery, 
Michael 
Brown, 
Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, and the 
unimaginable number of innocent lives 
that 
were 
taken 
in 
similar 
cir-
cumstances. Our Nation is reeling from 
centuries of racial injustice, a legacy 
as old as the Nation itself and one that 
haunts us to this day. 
It took two and a half centuries and 
the Civil War to finally end slavery in 
America. It was 100 years more until 
the descendants of those newly freed 
men and women could fully enjoy the 
rights of citizenship. Even today, slav-
ery is still with us. Its terrible legacy 
and evil effects are felt in real and dis-
cernible ways every single day. 
When the French historian Alexis de 
Tocqueville visited America in the 
1830s, with amazing prescience he pre-
dicted that the United States would be-
come a great nation—the greatest in 
the world—even though at the time we 
were a fledgling country, compared to 
the great powers of Europe. But he also 
said that the one thing that could 
doom our Nation was racism and racial 
prejudice. His words ring true today. 
The racial disparities in our criminal 
justice system have been on full dis-
play, but these disparities permeate 
not just the criminal justice system 
but all of society. There are glaring ra-
cial disparities in healthcare and hous-
ing, racial disparities in income and in 
wealth, in the board room and at the 
ballot box, on our streets and in our 
schools. These disparities have been 
with us a very long time, but COVID 
has placed a magnifying glass on them. 
Perhaps most evident and immediate, 
the COVID–19 pandemic continues to 
infect and kill African Americans at a 
disproportionate rate. We are con-
fronted by the all too often fatal con-
sequences of those disparities on a 
daily basis. 
George Floyd’s killing touched off 
justified protests and demonstrations 
across the country, driven by Ameri-
cans of every age, color, and creed who 
were distressed and upset, frightened 
and angry by the America they see and 
feel compelled to change. The over-
whelmingly peaceful protests do honor 
to the generations of Americans who 
stood up and sat in and shouted at the 
top of their lungs in the urgent mission 
to make America a more perfect union. 
The small minority who exploit the 
moment for violence and mayhem are 
wrong and do not advance the cause of 
justice. 
I would note that while over 4,000 
protesters have been arrested in the 
last week, only 1 in 4 of the police offi-
cers involved in the killing of George 
Floyd has been arrested. While that 
statistic does not excuse the violence 
we have seen, it certainly helps to ex-
plain the frustration and anger right 
now. 
There is accountability when every-
day citizens and protesters violate the 
law, but that same accountability is 
far too often lacking when law enforce-
ment violates the law, and we have to 
fix that. We must work to bring ac-
countability to police departments so 
that bad actors are not shielded from 
culpability and those many officers 
who do the job the right way are 
incentivized and rewarded. 
We must reform our laws and our po-
lice practices so that events like 
George Floyd’s killing are far less like-
ly in the first place. There are many 
examples of departments that have 
made strides at improving community 
relations, transparency, and account-
ability, while reducing unwarranted vi-
olence and racial bias. We need to build 
on those best practices and get all of 
our police agencies to adopt them. 
We must invest in services and pro-
grams necessary to deal with issues un-
related to law enforcement, such as 
housing and mental health, rather than 
asking police officers to be responsible 
for addressing all of our society’s chal-
lenges. There are many ways to address 
the broader disparities in our society, 
the systemic racism, and the injustice 
that follows America around like a 
shackle in our laws, in our customs, 
and in too many of our hearts. We have 
to make progress on these issues right 
now—not later, not next year, not after 
the next George Floyd but right now. 
Senate 
Democrats 
will 
be 
con-
fronting and addressing all of these 
issues this week, and many of my col-
leagues will prepare legislative plans of 
action. We will listen to experts on 
these issues and our constituents who 
face these challenges on a daily basis. 
Be sure of this: We will propose and 
push for bold action. 
Leader MCCONNELL, however, will de-
cide whether or not the Senate will 
take any of that action. At the mo-
ment, he has reserved the floor of the 
Senate for the confirmation of several 
rightwing judges, many of whom will 
become part of the very problem we are 
now discussing: a justice system that 
doesn’t work for everyone, a biased 
system. 
These 
are 
judges 
who 
were 
preselected 
specifically 
because 
of 
their antipathy to voting rights and 
civil rights and criminal justice bal-
ance and fairness. Time and again, the 
Republican majority has confirmed ju-
dicial nominees who pledge loyalty to 
an ideological doctrine that would ex-
acerbate the very inequalities that 
have been laid bare in recent weeks and 
months. Leader MCCONNELL is doing 
that this week, once again. 
At this delicate time, the Senate 
should lead on these issues rather than 
aggravate the problem. Leader MCCON-
NELL should commit to put a law en-
forcement reform bill on the floor of 
the 
Senate 
before 
July 
4. 
There 
shouldn’t be hearings on President 
Trump’s wild conspiracies about the 
2016 election or a month of rightwing, 
anti-civil rights judicial nominees. As 
the COVID pandemic continues to rage 
and Americans are taking to the 
streets to express their anger at police 
violence and racial injustice, the Re-
publican majority in the Senate must 
focus on the national crisis at our 
doorstep. 
Today—just today—the CBO is ex-
pected to release an estimate of the 
damage to our economy caused by the 
pandemic. If the current trends con-
tinue, the CBO predicts a jaw-dropping 
$16 trillion reduction in economic 
growth over the next decade—$16 tril-
lion. 
There are 40 million Americans cur-
rently unemployed. Where is the ur-
gency from Senate Republicans to ad-
dress the economic catastrophe in our 
country, a catastrophe that, like police 
violence, will disproportionately affect 
African Americans and other Ameri-
cans of color? 
We should address both these issues— 
COVID 
and 
police 
violence—this 
month, not spend time on fringe con-
spiracy theories and not spend time on 
putting rightwing judges who have 
shown no sympathy to civil rights and 
racial justice and harmony on the floor 
of the Senate. 
This is a moment that cries out for 
leadership, for compassion, for sym-
pathy, for understanding, for action, 
and for our leaders to bring us together 
instead of letting events tear us apart. 
But the leader of our country, the 
President of the United States, strug-
gles—struggles—to summon even an 
ounce of humanity in this time of tur-
moil. 
The President has reacted to the pain 
and anger in the country by playing 
politics and encouraging police to be 
tougher on protesters by bragging 
about his reelection prospects and his 
personal safety inside the White House.

police chief, who, in 1967 encouraged 
shooting Black people during riots. The 
President seems unable even to address 
the underlying issues that the protests 
are about. He is unwilling—unwilling— 
even to speak to the Nation about ra-
cial justice. 
Unfortunately, none of this is re-
motely new with President Trump. A 
few years ago, President Trump told 
law enforcement officers not to worry 
about injuring suspects when arresting 
them. His administration stopped in-
vestigating State and local police de-
partments for racial discrimination 
and repealed restrictions on police de-
partments 
obtaining 
military-style 
weapons. The President’s policies have 
worsened racial divisions in this coun-
try. His rhetoric has consistently in-
flamed them. 
Either the President is too afraid to 
lead or is simply incapable, but all of 
us, right now, have to engage in the 
difficult work of pulling this country 
together and then forward. We are a 
nation exhausted and dispirited. In the 
midst of a once-in-a-generation chal-
lenge, we have been reminded of a gen-
eration’s-long struggle for racial jus-
tice and equality. The only way—the 
only way—for us to move forward is to 
do it together. 
It is time for the large majority of 
police officers who do a very difficult 
job the right way to be part of a reform 
effort, for our national leaders in the 
Senate and the House to take up 
thorny issues of prejudice and discrimi-
nation and begin changing the laws and 
institutions that perpetuate it, and, 
yes, for the President to finally start 
acting like the leader he is supposed to 
be and the Constitution calls for. 
We are all engaged in this project to 
not only recover from a public health 
crisis and an economic disaster, but to 
build a society when none of our citi-
zens fear the men and women who are 
supposed to protect them—a society 
where Americans of color can live and 
breathe and watch birds in a park and 
walk home with a bag of Skittles with-
out fearing for their lives. 
As millions of Americans take to the 
streets in peaceful and righteous pro-
test, I hope that this moment—one of 
pain and sorrow and grief—can also be 
a watershed moment for action. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

OFFICER 
(Ms.

f 
PROTESTS 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, it 
was 1 week ago today that George 
Floyd died in the streets of Min-
neapolis at the hands of Minneapolis 
police officers exercising and employ-
ing incredible, illegal, unconstitutional 
violence ending in the loss of Mr. 
Floyd’s life. 
This afternoon, we have a medical re-
port from examiners hired by Mr. 
Floyd’s family. The words are just 
shocking. The report concludes: 
George Floyd was killed by asphyxia due 
to neck and back compression and died at 
the scene. 
Sustained pressure on the right side of Mr. 
Floyd’s artery impeded blood flow to the 
brain, and weight on his back impeded his 
ability to breathe. 
Then the report concludes: 
The independent examiners found that 
weight on the back, handcuffs and posi-
tioning were contributory factors because 
they impaired Mr. Floyd’s diaphragm to 
function. From all the evidence, the doctors 
said it now appears Mr. Floyd died at the 
scene. 
Words cannot begin to describe the 
injustice that this report puts into 
plain text: the violation of police pro-
cedures, the abuse of the law, the ap-
palling, illegal, homicidal misuse of 
government authority. Words cannot 
begin to describe the injustice that this 
has done to Mr. Floyd, to his family, to 
his community, and to millions of 
Americans who feel caught up, who feel 
judged by, endangered by, imperiled by 
these actions and too many others like 
them over too many years for too long 
in this country. 
I just want to say as the former at-
torney general of my State—a role in 
which I had the great privilege to work 
day in and day out with law enforce-
ment across the State of Missouri, law 
enforcement who go to work every day 
to prevent this kind of illegal violence, 
to prevent this kind of illicit use of 
power—that the actions by the police 
officer and officers here in this case 
cast an incredible aspersion on those 
valiant and courageous and law-abiding 
police officers, Black and White and of 
every color across our country, who go 
to do their job every day to protect and 
uphold and defend the Constitution of 
the United States and to protect men 
and women like George Floyd. The ac-
tions of these officers in this case are 
an incredible betrayal of those stand-
ards of those officers and of justice 
itself. 
I understand why so many Americans 
have assembled peacefully to witness 
to this abuse of power and to protest it 
and to demand that justice be done. 
They are right to do so, and they are 
right to demand that this pattern of vi-
olence exercised against African-Amer-
icans be acknowledged and it be con-
fronted and it be stopped. 
This is urgent work for us as a nation 
and for this Congress as we go forward. 
I also believe that those who would 
turn this occasion into an opportunity 
for rioting and for looting and for more 
violence and for further attacks and for 
civil unrest do a great disservice to the 
memory of Mr. Floyd, to his family, 
and to this cause of justice that we 
Americans share together, for this is a 
cause that is ours together as a nation. 
This is a cause given to us by our com-
mon Constitution. This is a cause that 
should link us together, American with 
American, and we must resist the ef-
forts of those—all of those—who would 
set us against ourselves as we seek to 
pursue that more perfect union, as we 
seek to pursue justice in this case and 
in other cases and in the future to 
come. 
So I add my voice to those who call 
for an end now to the rioting and to the 
looting, to those who would defame and 
dishonor and disfigure the memory of 
Mr. Floyd and his cause. I hope all law-
ful steps will be taken to protect inno-
cent and law-abiding citizens in our 
cities and in our communities so that 
the peaceful assembly and its righteous 
cause can go forward. 
I just want to say one more thing on 
this subject. We cannot ignore that 
these peaceful protests are taking 
place amid a backdrop of the 20-percent 
unemployment in this Nation—perhaps 
higher in the urban centers of our Na-
tion. I think of a line by a former Sen-
ator, who once said that ‘‘to be unem-
ployed is to have nothing to do, and 
that means having nothing to do with 
the rest of us.’’ 
I hope that as we as a nation and we 
as a body in the U.S. Senate turn our 
attention to what we can do to seek 
that more perfect union, what we can 
do to better secure the promise of our 
Constitution, what we can better do to 
secure that dream we hold together as 
Americans, I hope one thing we will 
discuss is the vitality, the necessity of 
work—work that is meaningful and 
that is rewarding and that is available 
for all Americans, from our urban core 
to our small towns. 
I hope we will have a discussion 
about the policies that for too long in 
this country, for too many decades, 
have sent too much work out of our 
country, away from our cities—away 
from our small towns, for that matter. 
I hope we can discuss what we will do 
to bring work back so that those who 
grow up in our cities—young men who 
grow up in our cities—will have a sense 
of a future, will have a sense of possi-
bility, will think that ‘‘there is some-
thing for me here. I could build a fam-
ily here. I could start something here. 
And yes, I could have a say and a share 
in our society here.’’ For that, they 
have to have work. They have to have 
meaningful work. 
This is a task to which we must set 
ourselves. It is urgent now in this 
present pandemic crisis that has seen 
these unemployment numbers rocket 
to historic, unimaginable levels. It is 
vital we address the crisis of work, but 
it is also vital for our future. It is vital 
for our urban core. It is vital for the 
young men and women who struggle 
there. It is vital for our rural towns 
and our small areas like the one I am 
from. It is vital for every part of this 
country, for every member of this Na-
tion, and it is work I hope we will take 
up urgently together to provide good-

paying, meaningful jobs that can sup-

There is much to do in the months 
and the years ahead. I just hope that 
the loss of Mr. Floyd will serve as a 
fresh beginning, an opportunity for a 
new start, for Americans from every 
corner of this country, from every po-
litical background, from every race 
and ethnicity, to stand together and to 
say: We commit ourselves anew to this 
Constitution that we love, to this Na-
tion that we call home, and we are de-
termined now more than ever to seek 
and to build a more perfect union. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
f 
REMEMBERING GEORGE FLOYD 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, ours 
is a nation with a split screen of a bat-
tle on two fronts. One is the pandemic 
that we have been fighting now for 
many months, and the other is to con-
tinue the fight to defeat racial injus-
tice that has sadly divided our Nation 
since its very inception. 
One week ago today, George Floyd, a 
native Houstonian, tragically died in 
the custody of a law enforcement offi-
cer. As the gut-wrenching video of his 
death has spread, so has the passion 
and the anger among all of us who won-
der, how can something like that hap-
pen? 
Our Constitution guarantees every 
American the right to protest injus-
tice, and I believe we all have a respon-
sibility to stand up for what is right 
and condemn what is plainly wrong. 
People of all colors, backgrounds, 
and ages are demanding that justice be 
served in the case of George Floyd. The 
first step in that process came on Fri-
day when the officer who had him in 
custody 
was 
himself 
arrested 
and 
charged with third-degree murder. 
Devastating events like the death of 
George Floyd remind us that we have a 
long way to go in the fight for equal 
justice under the law, but we cannot 
yield to the temptation to fill the void 
created by this tragedy with violence. 
Too many protests across our coun-
try have turned into riots with looting 
and vandalism and destruction, hurting 
innocent people and tearing our cities 
apart. In response to these escalating 
protests last night, there were more 
curfews in place than at any other time 
since the assassination of Martin Lu-
ther King. 
One man who experienced that period 
of American history firsthand is our 
colleague on the other side of the Cap-
itol, Congressman JOHN
LEWIS. He 
fought and marched alongside Dr. 
King, fighting for equal rights, and 
continues fighting today for equal jus-
tice. 
Over the weekend, he denounced the 
rioting and looting that occurred and 
said: 
‘‘Be constructive, not destructive. History 
has proven time and time again that non- 
violent, peaceful protest is the way to 
achieve the justice and equality that we all 
deserve.’’ 
I understand and share the passion 
and the anger that have spread across 
the country and support those who are 
peacefully protesting and demanding 
that justice be served. There should 
never be a time in which the color of 
someone’s skin determines whether 
they live or die, and we have to do ev-
erything in our power to prevent these 
tragedies from occurring in the first 
place. But that change can’t happen 
when businesses are being looted, when 
vehicles are being set on fire, or when 
innocent people are being harmed. It 
only can happen when we come to-
gether and learn to empathize with one 
another and understand the struggles 
our neighbors are facing. 
I would note that there is good evi-
dence that many of these acts of vio-
lence are being instigated not by vic-
tims of injustice but by outsiders de-
termined to stoke the rage that many 
feel and thus incite them to that vio-
lence. 
I was glad to hear the Attorney Gen-
eral of the United States say on Sun-
day that the Department of Justice 
will treat violence by individuals asso-
ciated with Antifa and other groups as 
domestic terrorism and calling some of 
these protests following George Floyd’s 
death to have been hijacked for an-
other destructive, antisocial agenda. 
Investigators are also tracking social 
media posts and looking into whether 
foreign agents are behind an active 
propaganda 
campaign 
using 
social 
media, trying to divide us further, to 
stoke the anger and rage that many of 
us feel. Officials have seen a huge surge 
in social media accounts with fewer 
than 200 followers created in the last 
month—a 
textbook 
sign 
of 
a 
disinformation campaign by a foreign 
power, much as we saw in 2016 during 
the Russian active measures campaign 
leading up to the election. 
Righteous rage is one thing; being 
manipulated by instigators of violence 
and foreign powers is quite another. 
f 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, on 
to another matter, I was glad to be 
able to get back home to Texas this 
last week, where our communities are 
slowly coming out of a coronavirus 
shutdown. Churches have begun safely 
welcoming 
worshippers, 
restaurants 
are beginning to safely seat customers, 
albeit 
with 
the 
appropriate 
social 
distancing, and retailers are now begin-
ning to safely reopen their doors. After 
weeks and in some cases months of 
hunkering down, it is a welcome sign of 
our progress in the fight against the 
coronavirus and the first step in our 
economic recovery. 
When stay-at-home orders were first 
put in place, small business were wor-
ried—understandably so—about their 
ability to survive. Many said they 
couldn’t survive more than a couple of 
weeks under those circumstances. 
Back in March, Fort Worth chef Tim 
Love described the situation as ‘‘Arma-
geddon.’’ He said: 
It’s worse than a tornado, it’s worse than a 
hurricane, it’s worse than a fire. This is 
going to destroy everything that I have 
built. 
But the restaurants weren’t alone; I 
heard similar concerns from countless 
other small business owners across 
nearly every sector of the economy— 
hospitality, tourism, retail, manufac-
turing, and the list goes on. 
Keeping our small businesses open 
means much more than having another 
restaurant to eat in or a shop to buy 
from on Main Street; it is one of the 
most effective ways to support our 
economy, by protecting those jobs. 
Across the country, small businesses 
have employed nearly half of all U.S. 
workers. They are the lifeblood of our 
local economies and provide critical 
services to each of our communities. 
Without customers coming through 
the front doors each day, it is hard to 
cover your business expenses and keep 
employees on the payroll. In fact, it is 
not just hard, it is impossible. 
Whether you are a new business just 
starting out or a decades-old commu-
nity 
staple, 
the 
financial 
squeeze 
caused by this virus and the mitigation 
efforts that ensued are unavoidable. 
As we worked on coronavirus re-
sponse legislation here in March, we 
knew that small businesses needed our 
support. That is why we established 
the Paycheck Protection Program and 
initially funded it with $350 billion. 
This funded loans that were available 
for these businesses to keep their em-
ployees on their payrolls and cover 
other necessary expenses, and if they 
did so, that loan would turn into a 
grant. 
It was so popular—and it’s not hard 
to see why—and the need was so great 
that that initial funding ran out in 
about 2 weeks, so we wisely, in my 
opinion, decided to replenish it with 
another $320 billion. 
An IT and document management 
company in Sugar Land, TX, called 
Function 4 was one of the recipients of 
one of those PPP loans. One of the 
partners, Bill Patsouras, said that if it 
wasn’t for the PPP, they would ‘‘abso-
lutely have to start letting people go.’’ 
But instead of layoffs, all 89 employees 
of Function 4 are still employed and 
still working. 
This is a familiar story, I am sure, 
not just in Texas but elsewhere. As of 
May 23, small businesses in Texas have 
received more than 350,000 PPP loans 
totaling more than $40 billion. That is 
an average loan size of less than 
$115,000. These are for small and me-
dium-size businesses. 
In speaking to my community bank-
ers last week, I learned that one bank 
had approved a loan request for as lit-
tle as $300. So while the average loan 
was $115,000, some businesses needed 
far less than that, including this one 
loan for $300. 
No matter how large or small, these 
loans have allowed businesses, church-
es, nonprofits, and some of our most

valuable community institutions to 
survive. That is not to say, though, it 
was perfect—at least to start with. 
When it was first established, no one 
expected the rollout to be perfect. I 
think that would be an exercise in hope 
over experience because no government 
program this big and created this 
fast—and we knew both of those were 
important. We needed to go big, and we 
needed to deal with the need urgently. 
We knew there would be some prob-
lems. A brand-new loan program draft-
ed and passed in such a short time-
frame is bound to have some hiccups. 
So over the last several weeks, I have 
been working and talking to my con-
stituents—as we all have—to identify 
what needs to be fixed or improved, 
what gaps need to be filled; figure out 
what is working, what isn’t, and how 
we can make it even more effective. 
Well, I heard repeatedly that the big-
gest need was for flexibility in the use 
of those funds, and that is where they 
are needed the most. 
The main goal of the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program is right in the name— 
protecting paychecks. That is why we 
said that 75 percent of the money need-
ed to be used for payroll; otherwise you 
were going to have to pay the money 
back. We said originally that the re-
maining 25 percent could be used for a 
range of other expenses, like rent or 
utilities. But based on the feedback I 
have gotten—and I am confident that I 
am not alone—we missed our mark by 
establishing that 75-percent require-
ment. For many who had no business 
because they were shut down as part of 
the mitigation efforts, their payroll ex-
penses—they couldn’t use the three- 
quarters of the loan for payroll—at 
least not in the short timeframe we al-
lowed for. They needed to be able to 
spend more on other expenses, like rent 
and mortgage. 
The company owned by Tim Love, 
whom I mentioned a moment ago, who 
described this crisis as Armageddon, 
received a PPP loan and so far has been 
able to hire back 80 percent of their 490 
employees. A couple of weeks ago, he 
participated in a roundtable at the 
White House, and he asked for adjust-
ments to give businesses more flexi-
bility. He said: 
We’re not asking for more money. We’re 
just asking for the opportunity to spend it 
the way that you want us to spend it, the 
way it was intended; to take care of our em-
ployees when we’re able to open up. 
That is precisely what we are work-
ing to do, and I hope we can get legisla-
tion to the President’s desk this week 
to make those needed changes. 
Last week, the House passed a bill to 
provide that flexibility for small busi-
nesses to use these funds where they 
are needed most. This effort was spear-
headed by a fellow member of the 
Texas delegation, Congressman CHIP 
ROY, and it passed by a vote of 417 to 
1—a rare feat these days in the House 
of Representatives. 
The bill will reduce the level of funds 
that must be used on payroll from 75 
percent to 60 percent. This will make 
sure that the bulk of the funding con-
tinues to protect jobs and support 
workers, while giving businesses the 
flexibility they need to stay viable. 
This legislation also gives borrowers 
another valuable asset, and that is the 
asset of time. The PPP as originally 
written gave borrowers 8 weeks to use 
these funds, and I have repeatedly 
heard from my constituents that 8 
weeks is simply not enough. For those 
who received these loans at the outset 
in early April, their window to use the 
PPP loan is quickly closing, and al-
though businesses are now just starting 
to safely reopen, it is going to take 
some time before we find our new nor-
mal. 
I don’t think we want a situation 
where, after being back at work for 8 
weeks, employees are let go because of 
an administrative policy that makes 
no sense. It is completely arbitrary, 
and that is exactly what could happen 
if we don’t act. The bill passed by the 
House would extend that period of time 
to 24 weeks for borrowers to use those 
funds. It will ensure that businesses 
and nonprofits have the time to safely 
reopen and rebuild their operations 
while using the PPP to help cover pay-
roll and other business expenses. This 
would be a win-win. I rarely have heard 
from my constituents back home that 
we have done anything that has been so 
universally appreciated as the PPP 
program, or the Paycheck Protection 
Program. 
This legislation that has passed the 
House and I hope we will take up and 
pass this week extends the benefits of 
this incredible program and provides 
more stability for small businesses 
without spending anymore taxpayer 
dollars. It doesn’t cost us anything. 
Giving small businesses and nonprofits 
more flexibility to use this money 
when and where it is needed is impor-
tant to our long-term recovery. 
I have heard very positive feedback 
about these changes from the small 
business owners I represent, and I am 
eager to support the passage of the lat-
est House bill here in the Senate. 
I yield the floor.

PROTESTS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, his 
name was George Floyd, and 7 days ago 
he was killed on the streets of Min-
neapolis. He was not the first African 
American to be the victim of racism 
and criminal misconduct by the police. 
This has happened in our history many 
times, but this was different. This was 
a 
killing 
which 
we 
watched 
in 
realtime. 
In fewer than 9 minutes, a Min-
neapolis police officer, with his knee 
on the neck of George Floyd, took his 
life away. Despite Mr. Floyd’s begging 
over and over again, his pleas that he 
couldn’t breathe, even invoking the 
name of his mother, it didn’t stop what 
happened. That photo is still embla-
zoned in my mind, as I am sure it is for 
all of those who have seen it. 
The look in that policeman’s eyes, in 
the videotape that was being taken of 
that incident, was cold, hard, distant 
and unmoved by George Floyd’s plea 
and the plea of those around him. What 
a tragic moment for our country. What 
a tragic moment for that family. What 
does it say about who we are in the 
United States of America that in the 
year 2020 this sort of thing can happen 
with such frequency? 
The heartbreaking killing of George 
Floyd follows years of similar trage-
dies and needless loss. In 2012, 17-year- 
old Trayvon Martin was shot and killed 
by a vigilante as he walked home with 
a bag of Skittles that he just bought 
from the local 7-Eleven. His crime? 
Black in America. 
In 2014, the words ‘‘I can’t breathe’’ 
were seared into our minds when we 
saw the video of Eric Garner struggling 
for his life and dying as a police officer 
held him in a choke hold. His crime? 
Black in America. 
Weeks later, Michael Brown was shot 
and killed by a police officer in Fer-
guson, MO, despite being unarmed. A 
couple of months later, on the streets 
of Chicago, IL, Laquan McDonald was 
shot and killed by a police officer. The 
next month, after he was killed, Tamir 
Rice was shot and killed by a police of-
ficer while playing with a toy gun in a 
Cleveland park. 
The tragic list of Black individuals 
whom we have mourned and marched 
for continues to grow: Walter Scott, 
Freddie 
Gray, 
Philando 
Castile, 
Botham Jean, Atatiana Jefferson, and 
many more, including Sandra Bland, 
another resident of Illinois whose life 
was taken when she drove down to 
Texas to interview for a new job. I at-
tended her funeral ceremony. The loss 
of such a wonderful young woman is 
still unexplained. 
Now we come together to mourn the 
lives of two Black men and a Black 
woman—lives that were cut far too 
short in incidents of inexplicable and 
inexcusable violence: Ahmaud Arbery, 
Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd. 
Once 
again, 
those 
gut-wrenching 
words—‘‘I can’t breathe’’—have us to 
tears. 
As 
activist 
Brittany 
Packnett 
Cunningham has pointed out, justice 
for George, Breonna, and Ahmaud 
would mean that they would each still 
be alive and breathing today. 
What we must now seek is account-
ability. The arrest of former Min-
neapolis police officer Derek Chauvin 
is a first step in that direction, but 
there is so much more that must fol-
low. 
Too 
often, 
police 
officers 
have 
crossed the line from lawful protection 
of our communities to baseless tar-
geting, harming, and killing of un-
armed Americans of color. Perhaps an 
arrest of the officer will be made, but 
our system of justice rarely leads to 
real consequences that follow. How

many more names of Black men and 
women and children will be crying out 
in protest before America finally ac-
knowledges the obvious? 
We cannot call ourselves a land of 
justice until we address those funda-
mental issues of racial injustice. That 
will require an honest, candid con-
versation with leaders in the law en-
forcement community about training, 
inherent bias, the use of force, and the 
consequences for their unjust action. It 
will require prosecutors in courts to 
commit to pursuing true account-
ability when injustice occurs, and it 
will require legislators like myself and 
those I serve with in the Senate and in 
the House and in State legislatures 
around this country to continue to 
undo the damage of a criminal justice 
system fraught with racial disparities. 
Most importantly, it will require 
those of us with privilege and power to 
step back and listen to Black Ameri-
cans as they tell us about what a life 
affected by pervasive and systemic rac-
ism is like. If we truly want to reach a 
new day in America, impacted commu-
nities must lead the conversation, and 
allies must play an active and sup-
porting role in confronting and disman-
tling racism. 
We know there are several steps the 
Federal Government can take right 
now to begin the process of moving for-
ward. A good place to start is President 
Barack Obama’s Task Force on 21st 
Century Policing. 
In 2015, President Obama’s Task 
Force released a report outlining cru-
cial reforms to strengthen community 
policing and to restore trust between 
law enforcement and the communities 
they serve. Under President Obama’s 
leadership, the Justice Department’s 
Civil Rights Division investigated civil 
rights abuses in multiple police depart-
ments across the country—Baltimore; 
Ferguson, MO; Cleveland; and, yes, Chi-
cago, IL. 
Unfortunately, the current President 
dismantled these efforts as soon as he 
took control of the Department of Jus-
tice in 2017. In this heartbreaking mo-
ment of crisis, America is pleading 
with 
us 
for 
leadership. 
President 
Trump and Attorney General Barr 
could demonstrate that leadership by 
implementing the recommendations of 
the Task Force on 21st Century Polic-
ing and permitting the Civil Rights Di-
vision to do its job and vigorously in-
vestigate police departments accused 
of engaging in a pattern of practice of 
misconduct. 
We have a role to play here too. We 
must immediately hold hearings on 
systemic racism and police misconduct 
so we can discuss and pursue solutions, 
including accountability and training. 
Chairman GRAHAM of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee has announced that 
the committee will hold a hearing on 
police misconduct. I am glad that he 
made that statement. I hope it is more 
than just one token hearing. 
When I chaired the Senate Judiciary 
Subcommittee on the Constitution, 
Civil Rights, and Human Rights, I held 
several hearings on race in America, 
including my last hearing as chairman 
in December of 2014, on the state of 
civil and human rights in the United 
States. I said then, and I repeat it 
today, that it is important to recognize 
and say clearly that there is still a 
problem with racism in America and 
we still have so much more to do. We 
have got to acknowledge the obvious. 
As one sign said in the demonstra-
tion yesterday, ‘‘All Black people are 
not criminals. All White people are not 
racists. All policemen are not bad.’’ We 
have to find the problems and solve 
them, but we cannot ignore the obvi-
ous. 
Since the Republicans took Senate 
majority control on January 2015, the 
Senate Judiciary Committee rarely, if 
ever, addressed these issues of systemic 
racism in America. In fact, the last 
hearing on policing was almost 5 years 
ago. 
In November of 2015, the junior Sen-
ator from Texas held a hearing enti-
tled: ‘‘The War on Police: How the Fed-
eral Government Undermines State 
and Local Law Enforcement.’’ It was a 
thinly veiled attack on the efforts of 
the 
Obama 
administration’s 
Civil 
Rights Division to improve police in-
tegrity, and 41⁄2 years after that hear-
ing, we still have so much work to do. 
I am committed to joining with my 
colleagues to listen to civil rights lead-
ers, activists, and affected commu-
nities to work with them to improve 
life in my State and across the Nation. 
I hope we can honor George, Breonna, 
Ahmaud, and all of the Black and 
Brown lives that have been lost in bru-
tal acts of racial injustice. We need to 
do this by reforming the system that 
has permitted these atrocities to occur 
and dedicate ourselves to bringing 
about justice and accountability. 
It was many years ago when I was a 
law student in this city. The year was 
1968. I remember it well. It was a his-
toric year, and much of history was 
painful. I was sitting in the student li-
brary of Georgetown Law School, and a 
professor opened the door and asked 
that all students in their second and 
third year come out in the hallway. I 
went out in the hallway, and he said: 
We need your help. As you know, the 
city of Washington is ablaze with dem-
onstrations in anger over the assas-
sination of Dr. Martin Luther King. 
The system of justice has broken down 
in the city. They have run out of attor-
neys to even stand with the accused de-
fendants before the court. We are pre-
paring to empower you, even as law 
students, to walk across the street to 
the DC court and play that role. We 
need you. 
I did it, nervous as could be, uncer-
tain of what I was actually doing but 
realizing that the system of justice in 
this city had all but broken down. 
I think we have learned the hard way 
that to maintain order in a democracy, 
you need a consensus—a consensus on 
what is the common good and the be-
lief that we all must stand together to 
make certain that it is protected. 
There will always be enemies and 
outliers, but ultimately, if we are to 
move together as a democratic nation, 
we have to understand and work to-
gether toward the common good and a 
common goal, and shouldn’t the begin-
ning of that common good and common 
goal be the end of racism in America? 
I read so much history about the 
Civil War and the role of another 
Illinoian, Abraham Lincoln, in bring-
ing that war to a successful conclusion. 
The constitutional amendments that 
followed and the promises that fol-
lowed as we emancipated slaves across 
the 
United 
States—those 
promises, 
sadly, were not kept. The Reconstruc-
tion, Jim Crow laws, and the discrimi-
nation that followed are still with us 
today. 
There was one moment—one shining 
moment in my political life—when I 
stood just a few feet away from a new 
President of the United States by the 
name of Barack Obama, an African 
American. I thought to myself, finally, 
finally, 
DURBIN, 
maybe 
we 
have 
reached that turning point in America 
when it comes to race. If we can accept 
an African American as the leader of 
our Nation, maybe, just maybe, we are 
moving toward the day we all dreamed 
of. 
I am afraid he moved us forward but 
not far enough, and he would be the 
first to acknowledge it. We have work 
to do. 
It used to be a bipartisan effort when 
it came to making certain that minori-
ties—especially African Americans— 
were not denied the right to vote. That 
used to be bipartisan when I first came 
to Congress. Now it has become an-
other sad, divisive, partisan issue, and 
the efforts to restore the Voting Rights 
Act failed because the Republicans no 
longer joined the Democrats in that 
quest. 
There are so many other areas that 
lie ahead that we have to address be-
yond criminal justice. We have to ad-
dress economic justice. We know from 
the COVID–19 pandemic that those who 
are minorities in this country—the 
Black and Brown—are dying at a much 
greater rate than others. There are 
gross disparities—racial disparities and 
poverty disparities—when it comes to 
healthcare in America, and the same is 
true for education and housing and so 
many other aspects of what being an 
American is all about. That agenda is 
before us. 
If we think coming to the floor and 
making a speech, having a hearing, and 
moving on will solve the problem, it 
will not. It will not. We have to envi-
sion, 
moving 
forward, 
rethinking 
America, and we have to acknowledge 
that the process will be far from per-
fect. 
Just the last two nights in the city of 
Chicago and across the United States, 
we have seen incidents occur that I 
thought I would never see again. They 
harken back to that 1968 reaction to

the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther 
King—burnings, 
looting, 
confronta-
tions, things that sadly look exactly 
like they did some 50 years ago. 
The reality is this: In America, we 
are given a constitutional right to ex-
press our feelings, our free speech, and 
our free assembly. Those rights are im-
portant and should be valued and re-
spected, but those rights to march and 
demonstrate, as people are doing right 
outside this building at this very mo-
ment, cannot be taken to the point 
where they have reached an extreme 
and become destructive. Speaking, as-
sembling, exercising your constitu-
tional right does not include looting. It 
doesn’t include arson, vandalism, or vi-
olence. In fact, those actions detract 
from the underlying message that calls 
for positive change in America. 
I am glad that leaders like JOHN 
LEWIS, my dear friend and former col-
league from the House of Representa-
tives, has made that point. His voice on 
the subject is much more articulate 
and more convincing. He has reminded 
us that if we are to move America to 
the place where it must be, then we 
must do it in a nonviolent fashion 
within the law, not breaking the law. 
His name was George Floyd, a 46- 
year-old African American. He died in 
the streets of Minneapolis with the 
knee of a police officer on his neck for 
almost 9 minutes. He cannot be forgot-
ten. And all the others I have men-
tioned must also be remembered. It is 
time for us and it is time for our gen-
eration to say: Enough.

f 
REMEMBERING GEORGE FLOYD 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today at a time of great sorrow, anger, 
and fear for our Nation. We face the 
confluence of a health crisis, an eco-
nomic depression, and a killing that 
laid bare the racial injustice that still 
taints our country. 
The horrific death of George Floyd in 
Minnesota was reprehensible. It was 
beyond a tragedy. It was a crime. 
As Americans, we all need to frankly 
acknowledge and work to resolve our 
longstanding, ongoing struggles with 
racial inequality. The President should 
help to heal the racial divisions in this 
country. It is at times like this that a 
President needs to speak to the Nation 
to pledge to right wrongs and to calm 
inflamed passions. 
The right to gather in protest of in-
justice is enshrined in our Constitu-
tion. The desire for reconciliation is in 
our national character. We must join 
together to ensure that the legacy of 
George Floyd is of progress, not deep-
ening division and hatred. 
Let me be clear. The vast majority of 
our law enforcement officers are brave 
men and women devoted to protecting 
our families, our belongings, and our 
communities. They deserve our heart-
felt gratitude as they willingly risk 
their 
lives 
for 
ours 
when 
danger 
strikes. 
In Maine, we are fortunate to have so 
many terrific professional law enforce-
ment officers devoted to their duty and 
devoted to doing what is right. 
It is, however, imperative that we ex-
amine and act on the racial disparities 
in law enforcement where they occur. 
I cannot believe that George Floyd 
would have had his neck stepped on 
and the life squeezed out of him had he 
been White. Sadly, there are many 
other examples as well. 
I remember our own Senator TIM 
SCOTT describing his being stopped by a 
police officer while driving many times 
during one year, even though he was 
abiding by all the traffic laws. That is 
harassment and simply wrong. 
In confronting these problems, we 
would do well to heed the words of Con-
gressman LEWIS in response to the vio-
lence that overwhelmed peaceful pro-
tests in his city of Atlanta last week-
end. Of course, we all know that the 
Congressman is a civil rights icon as 
well as an extraordinary Member of 
Congress. He said this: 
Justice has, indeed, been denied for far too 
long. Rioting, looting, and burning is not the 
way. Organize. Demonstrate. Sit-in. Stand- 
up. Vote. Be constructive, not destructive. 
History has proven time and again that non- 
violent, peaceful protest is the way to 
achieve the justice and equality that we all 
deserve. 
Those are powerful words from Con-
gressman LEWIS. Those are words that 
should motivate and guide all of us. 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once 
said: 
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only 
light can do that. Hate cannot drive out 
hate; only love can do that. 
By continuing to listen to one an-
other and being guided by the words of 
Congressman LEWIS, Dr. Martin Luther 
King, and the mayor of Atlanta, we can 
work toward improving social justice 
and eliminating racial disparities in 
this country, and we can drive out the 
forces of bigotry. 
Thank you.

The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of John Leonard Badalamenti, 
of Florida, to be United States District 
Judge for the Middle District of Flor-
ida. 
NOMINATION OF JOHN LEONARD BADALAMENTI 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I rise today to proudly support the con-
firmation of Judge John Badalamenti 
to serve as a U.S. District Court Judge 
for the Middle District of Florida. 
Judge Badalamenti has a distinguished 
record of public service, during which 
he has demonstrated a deep and abid-
ing respect for the rule of law and a 
commitment to upholding the U.S. 
Constitution. 
He served as an Assistant Federal De-
fender in the Middle District of Florida 
for nearly a decade, and, as Governor of 
Florida, I had the privilege to appoint 
him to the Second District Court of 
Appeal in 2015. During his time on the 
State appellate bench, he has consist-
ently demonstrated his keen legal acu-
men and devotion to upholding the 
proper function of the judiciary in our 
democratic system. 
I am proud of the work he has done, 
and I am proud to support his con-
firmation to the Federal bench today, 
where he will continue to serve our 
State and Nation well. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is, Will the Senate advise and 
consent to the Badalamenti nomina-
tion? 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
for the yeas and nays.

standing the provisions of rule XXII,

RECOGNIZING BRENDA CONNOLLY 
ON HER RETIREMENT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 1, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, it is with great 
respect and appreciation that I rise today to 
honor Brenda Connolly, who is retiring after 
serving 35 years in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Ms. Connolly has been a member of my 
team since I was first elected to the House of 
Representatives. She is a trusted advisor and 
a centering force throughout the unpredict-
ability of Washington. If you have met Brenda, 
then you know her retirement means more 
than just losing a staff member—it is the loss 
of an incredibly funny, talented and caring per-
son who left a profound impact on everyone 
she has come across. 
I was recently asked if there was anything 
I would change about Brenda’s time in our of-
fice, and without hesitation I simply responded 
‘nothing.’ 
Before coming to Washington, D.C., Brenda 
grew up in Battle Creek, Michigan. She then 
graduated from the University of Michigan— 
Go Blue—where she met her husband Doug 
with whom she has two children, Nicholas and 
Caitlin. Brenda has been such a keystone of 
my team despite our superficial differences, 
because we understand one another. We both 
attended the University of Michigan, we value 
time with our families above all else, our chil-
dren always come first, and we have the same 
sense of humor. 
Our team shared many of Brenda’s firsts 
while she worked with me: her first manicure, 
her first Kahlu´a, and her first viewing of The 
Office. Brenda was also there for one of my 
most significant firsts: my first day in Con-
gress. Brenda taught me more about Capitol 
Hill than she probably realizes. She put my job 
in perspective, made sure I was on time for 
the important things, and helped me under-
stand how to let the small things slide. Brenda 
was always proactive about what we needed, 
always raising potential concerns before I 
thought of them. Brenda has an incredible tal-
ent for making meaningful people-to-people 
connections; and in her 35 years on Capitol 
Hill, I can only imagine the countless connec-
tions she has made through the years. 
I know we will dearly miss Brenda’s nature 
paintings, holiday sweaters, and unrepeatable 
metaphors. From her first day on February 7, 
1985, Brenda understood that the needs of 
the many outweigh the needs of the few. I 
wish her a wonderful and fulfilling retirement 
with many years of happiness. 
On behalf of all the people she has made 
laugh, served, and worked with, I thank Bren-
da for her many years of service to New York 
and the United States of America. Brenda will 
be deeply missed.

IN HONOR OF THE MEMORY OF 
PAULA SPRINGER BOASE 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 1, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor the esteemed 
life of Paula Boase. Paula will forever be re-
membered for her tremendous impact on our 
community, and she will be deeply missed. 
Born in Detroit, Paula Boase was a life-long 
Michigan resident who left a significant mark 
on our state. After graduating from Michigan 
State University, Paula became a buyer for 
Hudson’s and later worked for Heinz. A short 
while later, Paula began her career with the 
Downriver Community Conference (DCC), 
where she remained for the past thirty-six 
years. After initially serving as a job developer 
who helped community members connect with 
employment opportunities, Paula quickly be-
came a fixture in the DCC and eventually rose 
to the position of Director of Economic Devel-
opment. Among her colleagues and peers, 
Paula was regarded as a humble leader who 
endeavored to make a lasting difference, and 
she will always be recognized as the moti-
vating driver behind the Brown Field redevel-
opment in the Downriver community. Paula 
dedicated her life to working for causes she 
believed in, and her efforts truly affected 
change throughout the Downriver community. 
Beyond her impact in a professional capac-
ity, Paula Boase was a generous, kind, and 
compassionate community figure. She was a 
fierce environmental and animal rights advo-
cate, a creative baker, and an adventurous 
traveler. Above all, Paula was a loving mother 
to Hilary and Daniel and doting grandmother 
to Leah, Bryce, Evan, and Elena. Paula’s 
passing represents a loss to the entire Michi-
gan community, but her memory will endure 
through the countless lives she touched. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the legacy of Paula Boase. We 
are saddened by her loss, but we will forever 
remember her remarkable life, work, and com-
munity impact. May she rest in eternal peace.

INTRODUCTION OF SPECIAL DIS-
TRICTS 
PROVIDE 
ESSENTIAL 
SERVICES ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 1, 2020 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Special Districts Provide Essen-
tial Services Act,’’ at the request of the Cali-
fornia Association of Special Districts. I want 
to thank my original cosponsors for their sup-
port of this much-needed legislation. 
Special districts are independent units of 
local government that provide public services 
cities and counties do not provide for resi-
dents. Those services include first responders, 
policing, firefighting, public health, transit, and 
more, making special districts critical to the 
communities they serve. 
However, special districts are currently ineli-
gible for direct federal financial assistance 
under the ‘‘Coronavirus Relief Fund’’ estab-
lished by the CARES Act (Public Law 116– 
136). My legislation would ensure that the 
2,700 special districts in California and 30,000 
special districts nationwide are eligible for any 
additional assistance provided by Congress to 
state, county, and local governments to aid in 
the fight against COVID–19. There are 237 
special districts alone in, California’s third 
Congressional district, which I am honored to 
represent. 
The ‘‘Special Districts Provide Essential 
Services Act’’ would also allow special districts 
access to the Federal Reserve’s Municipal Li-
quidity Facility, which provides states, coun-
ties, and cities federally guaranteed bridge fi-
nancing to offset unexpected short-term rev-
enue shortfalls. Like states, counties, and cit-
ies, many special districts serve large popu-
lations and have the legal authority to issue 
short-term tax and revenue anticipation notes. 
However, special districts are not currently 
granted direct access to the Municipal Liquid-
ity Facility, even to offset revenue shortfalls 
caused by the current pandemic 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to co-
sponsor the ‘‘Special Districts Provide Essen-
tial Services Act’’ to ensure that all local gov-
ernments have the support needed to deliver 
crucial quality-of-life services for our commu-
nities during this global pandemic.

HONORING RAY ‘‘GUMBI’’ SALAZAR 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 1, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Ray ‘‘Gumbi’’ 
Salazar, a true giant of Arizona, who passed 
away on Saturday, April 18, 2020, at the age 
of 71. We will remember him as a civil rights 
pioneer who dedicated his entire life to the ad-
vancement of a more just and equitable Ari-
zona. His unwavering positivity, artistic spirit, 
and commitment to education serve as an in-
spiration to our community and our state. 
Salazar was a changemaker who fought for 
opportunity 
and

future for all. He was born in the Golden Gate 
Settlement in South Phoenix, which the gov-
ernment later razed through eminent domain 
for the expansion of the airport. His commit-
ment to education was shaped by his early 
days at Phoenix Union High School, where 
students walked out over discrimination and 
educational inequities. For decades, Salazar 
served on the board of Chicanos Por La 
Causa, both as chairman and as a member of 
the Board Veteranos, where he never lost 
sight of the importance of education for the 
Latino and underserved communities. Today, 
education remains one of the organization’s 
five mission pillars of impact. 
His dedication to justice was also evident 
through his work with youth and the formerly 
incarcerated. For 28 years, Salazar served at 
the Arizona Department of Corrections, where 
his steadfast belief that everyone deserves a 
second chance led him to working with per-
sons who were returning to society. A long-
time member of the Latino Peace Officers As-
sociation, Salazar actively participated in com-
munity education to combat the influence of 
gangs and drugs and encourage young people 
to choose lives of service. 
Salazar’s creative spirit inspired generations 
of artists. At the young age of five, he devel-
oped a passion and vision for the arts. Salazar 
became an immediate sensation, moving audi-
ences with his choreography, vocals, and live 
performances. He graduated from Arizona 
State University with a major in music and be-
came a Latino trailblazer in music, both as a 
percussionist and vocalist. For more than six 
decades, his beloved music celebrated Mexi-
can culture and brought enjoyment to count-
less Arizonans, forging the path forward for 
the young artists he shaped and inspired. 
Salazar gave all his time, heart, and soul to 
the betterment of the Latino community and all 
Arizonans. I wish to extend my heartfelt grati-
tude and appreciation for his service to our 
state; Arizona is a better place because of 
him. His legacy will continue to live on for 
years to come. Godspeed, Gumbi.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
PRO-
MOTING 
EQUITABLE 
TRANSIT- 
ORIENTED 
DEVELOPMENT 
AND 
MOBILITY CORRIDORS ACT 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 1, 2020 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to introduce the Promoting Equitable 
Transit-Oriented Development and Mobility 
Corridors Act along with my colleague Con-
gresswoman BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN. 
Pent-up demand for walkable communities 
has accelerated land prices and rents which 
has displaced both small businesses and af-
fordable housing faster than state and local 
governments can respond. Additionally, subur-
ban and rural communities lack the resources 
needed to upgrade their local infrastructure, 
housing and economic strategies to remain 
economically viable. 
The Promoting Equitable Transit-Oriented 
Development and Mobility Corridors Act will 
combat housing affordability issues and dis-
placement of businesses by reversing the in-
centive to build luxury dwellings near transit. 
Instead, the bill will promote affordable hous-
ing development near transit and in priority in-
vestment areas. 
This legislation establishes an Office of Eq-
uitable Transit Oriented Development in the 
DOT, 
creates 
incentives 
to 
combat 
gentrification, promotes affordable housing 
near transit, and reduces vehicle miles trav-
eled and carbon emissions. It will also allow 
rural, suburban, and urban governments to de-
velop 
more 
equitable 
planning 
practices 
through Technical Assistance grants. 
I am glad that the Promoting Equitable 
Transit-Oriented Development and Mobility 
Corridors Act is endorsed by Elevated Chi-
cago, The Chicago Community Trust, Smart 
Growth America, LOCUS: Responsible Real 
Estate Developers and Investors and Trans-
portation for America. 
The Promoting Equitable Transit-Oriented 
Development and Mobility Corridors Act will 
ensure all Americans have equal access to 
healthy, walkable and prosperous commu-
nities. 
I urge this body to swiftly pass this legisla-
tion.

IN HONOR OF THE MEMORY OF 
MORRIS ‘‘MO’’ HOOD III 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 1, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor the esteemed 
life of a dear friend, Morris ‘‘Mo’’ Hood III. Mo 
will forever be remembered for his tremendous 
impact on our community, and he will be 
deeply missed. 
Morris Hood embodied every characteristic 
of a passionate public servant. Following in 
the footsteps of both his father and grand-
father, Mo was an active politician who duti-
fully and thoughtfully served Detroit. He was 
elected to the Michigan House of Representa-
tives in 2003 and later was elected to the 
Michigan Senate, where he served as Michi-
gan Senate Minority Leader until 2018. In his 
15 years in the State Legislature, Mo touched 
the lives of countless Michiganders and never 
stopped working to improve the community 
and better the state. 
Morris Hood will be remembered as a kind, 
humble, and dedicated community leader. He 
was a proud Detroiter who never forgot his 
roots and always fought for those he rep-
resented—even before his political career 
began. Prior to his election to the State Legis-
lature, Mo worked on the assembly line in the 
Dearborn Engine Plant and served as an alter-
nate committeeman. In this capacity, Mo 
worked tirelessly to support his fellow workers 
and ensure their rights were being protected. 
After running for public office, Mo never lost 
this passion and continued being a tenacious 
advocate for working people statewide. 
Beyond his political impact, Morris Hood’s 
legacy is one of compassion, warmth, and 
charisma. He brought people together and 
was a rock and voice of reason in turbulent 
times. He focused on the things that united us 
and refused to dwell on negativity or divisive-
ness. He always could be counted on to act 
with integrity, and encouraged all to be thank-
ful, cherish life’s blessings, and take advan-
tage of every single day. Mo’s passing rep-
resents a loss to the entire Michigan commu-
nity, but his memory will undoubtably endure 
through the countless lives he touched. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the legacy of Morris Hood III. 
He was a pillar of Michigan, and we will for-
ever remember his remarkable life, work, and 
community impact. May he rest in eternal 
peace.

RECOGNIZING JENNIFER CATECHIS 
HON. BEN RAY LUJA´N 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 1, 2020 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Jennifer Catechis for her years of serv-
ice to my office and the people of New Mexi-
co’s Third Congressional District. 
Jennifer and I have known each other for 
decades. We first met in high school. Later, 
she would work with me at New Mexico’s Pub-
lic Relations Commission. For the last twelve 
years, she has overseen the district offices of 
New Mexico’s Third Congressional District. 
But the titles and years don’t speak to who 
Jennifer Catechis is—she is family. And she 
treated her team and the fellow New Mexicans 
she was honored to serve like family. 
Under her leadership, she guided my local 
operations, 
helping 
countless 
constituents 
navigate the federal system—ensuring vet-
erans received the medals and benefits they 
earned, helping communities get support in 
times of strife, and always responding to need 
no matter the hour. If you called her for assist-
ance, you didn’t just get a seasoned, indus-
trious professional staffer—you got a voice of 
compassion. 
To our team and those she worked with, 
she responded with similar care. Birthdays 
were never forgotten, milestones recognized, 
and every year Jennifer’s carefully chosen hol-
iday gifts meant the season had truly arrived. 
Coworkers, neighbors, visitors—just about any 
New Mexican within driving distance—would 
be invited to her home for her Greek Easter 
celebration. 
During difficult times, battling cancer, Jen-
nifer maintained her unsinkable spirit—both 
while caring for her own health and continuing 
to fight for the people of New Mexico. After 
her recovery, she lent her voice to the fight 
against cancer—proving that even when a 
cause was personal, it was still about how she 
could be of service to others in need. 
As she transitions onto future endeavors, I 
want to thank and recognize Jennifer—a pub-
lic servant, a team leader and mentor, a fierce 
cancer survivor, an incredible mom, and a 
member of our proud New Mexico family.

GEORGE FLOYD 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 1, 2020 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, America in 2020 is aflame, 
fighting a two-front war. 
On one front, we fight a new virus. On the 
other, we fight an enemy as old as the repub-
lic itself. 
More than a million Americans have suf-
fered from COVID–19. Millions more suffer 
from a different sickness, racism. 
The evidence is overwhelming that George 
Floyd is a victim of the latter. His essential 
right to breathe was taken by the hands of an-
other. And he is not the first. 
Unique among nations, America was born 
not out of one race or religion. Rather, in its 
very founding document was a radical commit-
ment to the full equality of all people. It is 
foundational to the American Experiment. 
Racism is not just an assault on the indi-
vidual of a different race. It is a grievous blow 
against the very idea of America. 
We will soon discover a vaccine for virus 
COVID–19. But we must also, at long last, 
once and for all, eradicate all forms of racial 
prejudice and discrimination. 
Only then can America fully breathe.

PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM 
FLEXIBILITY ACT OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. CHIP ROY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify 
the intent of some of the language in H.R. 
7010, and especially the language in the Bill 
as to loan forgiveness. 
Section 3 adds new paragraph 8 (Limitation 
on Forgiveness) that states that: 
To receive loan forgiveness under this sec-
tion, an eligible recipient shall use at least 
60 percent of the covered loan amount for 
payroll costs, and may use up to 40 percent 
of such amount for any payment of interest 
on any covered mortgage obligation (which 
shall not include any prepayment of or pay-
ment of principal on a covered mortgage ob-
ligation), any payment on any covered rent 
obligation, or any covered utility payment. 
The intent of this provision is to reduce the 
portion of the forgivable amount that must be 
spent on payroll cost, to provide employers 
more flexibility to bring back and retain em-
ployees in a manner that allows compliance 
with state and local reopening restrictions and 
the business reality of individual borrowers. 
The SBA, as set forth in the ‘‘Interim Final 
Rule 1’’ issued on April 2, 2020, has deter-
mined that the forgivable portion of the loan 
(that which is spent during the covered period) 
must be allocated at least 75 percent to pay-
roll costs. In the event a borrower is unable to 
spend in that ratio during the covered period, 
the loan is eligible for partial forgiveness. 
The IFR in section 2(o) states clearly that a 
PPP loan can ‘‘be forgiven in whole or in 
part.’’ 
o. Can my PPP loan be forgiven in whole 
or in part? 
Yes. The amount of loan forgiveness can be 
up to the full amount of the full principal 
amount of the loan and any accrued interest 
. . . The actual amount of loan forgiveness 
will depend, in part, on the total amount [of 
payroll and non-payroll costs] . . . over the 
eight-week period following the loan . . . 
However, not more than 25 percent of the 
loan forgiveness amount may be attributable 
to non-payroll costs[.] 
The overall spending of the loan is similarly 
limited in a 75/25 ratio. Section 2(r) states ‘‘at 
least 75 percent of the PPP loan proceeds 
shall be used for payroll costs.’’ 
The intent of this Bill is to retain the existing 
structure set forth by the SBA, but to amend 
the ratios in both IFR sections from 75/25 to 
60/40 (along with extension of covered period, 
maturity date and other changes) to preserve 
borrower flexibility and the ability to obtain par-
tial or proportional forgiveness of the loan if 
less than 60 percent of covered period ex-
penditures are payroll costs, provided that the 
borrower must spend overall loan proceeds 
subject to the 60/40 ratio.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. HEDWIG 
MURPHY FOR A DISTINGUISHED 
CAREER IN MEDICINE WITH THE 
ANN 
ARBOR 
VA 
HEALTHCARE 
SYSTEM 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, June 1, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the distinguished career of 
Dr. Hedwig Murphy after 22 years of out-
standing service at the VA Ann Arbor 
Healthcare System. Dr. Murphy’s medical ex-
pertise as a pathologist has improved the lives 
of veterans across the state and is worthy of 
commendation. 
Dr. Murphy received her undergraduate de-
gree from Newton College of the Sacred Heart 
in 1970 and earned her M.A. from Johns Hop-
kins University School of Medicine in 1972. 
After earning her Ph.D. in the Department of 
Anatomy at Wayne State University School of 
Medicine in 1979, Dr. Murphy was awarded 
her M.D. from Wayne State in 1990. Upon 
graduation, she entered a Senior Postdoctoral 
Research Fellowship in the Department of Pa-
thology and completed residency in Anatomic 
Pathology in 1994. 
Before joining the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare 
System as a pathologist, Dr. Murphy was an 
instructor at several Michigan institutions. She 
served as an Instructor in the Departments of 
Ophthalmology and Anatomy at Wayne State 
University, and later served as an Instructor 
and Assistant Professor in the Division of 
Ophthalmology at the Michigan State Univer-
sity College of Human Medicine. In 1994, Dr. 
Murphy joined the faculty of the Department of 
Pathology at the University of Michigan as a 
Research Investigator and later was promoted 
to the rank of Assistant Professor. 
At the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, Dr. 
Murphy’s leadership has been paramount in 
the development of the Anatomic Pathology 
Laboratory. Under her guidance, the labora-
tory has become recognized as a national 
center of excellence. Beyond her work in a 
professional capacity, Dr. Murphy is regarded 
among her friends, colleagues, and peers and 
a humble leader who strives to make a dif-
ference. She has fully committed herself to 
serving our nation’s veterans, and encourages 
others to live a life of compassion, service, 
and excellence. Her years of dedicated work 
have made a difference in the lives of vet-
erans across the state, and her work in ana-
tomic pathology will leave a lasting impact on 
the healthcare of veterans in the years to 
come. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Dr. Hedwig Murphy for her ac-
complished career. Dr. Murphy’s work has 
transformed veterans’ healthcare, enabling 
them to live healthy and dignified lives. We 
are grateful for her dedication to patients, 
medicine, and our entire Michigan community, 
and we wish her luck in all future endeavors.

SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS 
Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, 
agreed to by the Senate of February 4, 
1977, calls for establishment of a sys-
tem for a computerized schedule of all 
meetings and hearings of Senate com-
mittees, subcommittees, joint commit-
