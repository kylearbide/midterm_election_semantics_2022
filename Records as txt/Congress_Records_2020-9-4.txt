September 4, 2020 
IN HONOR OF TERRILL HAIGLER 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
Terrill Haigler, an essential worker in Philadel-
phia, before the United States House of Rep-
resentatives. He has stepped up during the 
COVID–19 pandemic to not only perform his 
duties as a sanitation worker with high 
achievement, he has also been an advocate 
for his fellow frontline employees. 
With atypically high demand for waste re-
moval throughout this public health emer-
gency, our sanitation workers have faced an 
unprecedented increase in their workload 
while simultaneously confronting the height-
ened risk of contracting coronavirus. They 
keep the City of Philadelphia safe and clean, 
putting their health on the line to serve their 
neighbors. Terrill Haigler has rejuvenated the 
sanitation department through his selfless ac-
tions that represent the very best of our com-
munity and the nation. 
As trash began to pile up from strained re-
sources at the sanitation department, morale 
among employees was low. A lack of sufficient 
personal protective equipment (PPE) made 
matters even worse. After gauging the needs 
of his coworkers, Mr. Haigler took it upon him-
self to uplift those around him. 
He organized a comprehensive campaign 
through social media platforms to encapsulate 
the public, highlighting the accomplishments of 
his fellow trash collectors, encouraging public 
support and kindness for his colleagues, and 
accentuating the PPE shortfalls for essential 
workers. He then customized a shirt featuring 
a 
sanitation 
worker 
and 
his 
‘‘@lYourFavTrashman’’ account handle to 
continue to raise awareness and funds for the 
cause. 
All told, Mr. Haigler raised over $30,000 for 
PPE to keep his fellow sanitation workers safe 
and united a community around the essential 
workers who continue to serve through harsh 
conditions. I am grateful for his efforts and his 
activism. Our essential workers are our local 
heroes; beyond our utmost gratitude and ap-
preciation, they deserve just compensation 
and hazard pay. 
Terrill Haigler embodies a commitment to 
public good. His efforts will remain a model for 
the patriotism and generosity that has kept 
America going through these difficult times. He 
has shown the nation what Philadelphia is 
made of. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in extending our sincerest appreciation to 
Terrill Haigler for his extraordinary work on be-
half of our community. 
HONORING RUTHIE MCCOY 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
ambitious woman, Ms. Ruthie McCoy. Ruthie 
has shown what can be done through hard 
work, dedication, and a desire to serve others. 
Ruthie is a Vicksburg native and graduate of 
Warren Central High School. After graduation, 
she started working as an armed security offi-
cer at the Army Corp of Engineers. Ruthie 
knew this job was a segue to the career she 
dreamed about as a 9-year-old girl. 
She joined the Yazoo Police Department 
and later enrolled at the state police academy 
where she graduated with the Basic class of 
263 officers. She is also a part of the Domes-
tic Violence Taskforce. 
McCoy is a mother of three who look at her 
as their ‘‘hero.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Ms. Ruthie McCoy for her 
passion and dedication to serving Yazoo City 
and desire to make a difference in the com-
munity.

HONORING VALLE DEL SOL 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Valle del Sol for 50 years of excel-
lence in serving Arizona through its world- 
class healthcare services and programs. Since 
1970, Valle del Sol has touched the lives of 
thousands 
of 
Arizonans, 
inspired 
trans-
formational change, and provided meaningful 
support to families in our communities across 
the Valley. Its incredible work is a model in the 
greater Phoenix area and will continue to help 
many live healthy and fulfilling lives. 
Ever since its inaugural year, Valle del Sol 
has 
invested 
in 
quality 
and 
affordable 
healthcare services for people of all back-
grounds, especially our Hispanic and Latino 
neighbors. They have helped lead the way in 
treating those struggling with substance abuse 
and brought behavioral health to the forefront 
of our community by establishing the first 
Latino centered methadone treatment program 
in the Phoenix area. 
Valle del Sol has built bridges for five dec-
ades and continues to spotlight the best and 
brightest in our community. Above and beyond 
healthcare and human services, its team has 
enriched the social, cultural, and economic 
fabric of Arizona. Its Hispanic Leadership Insti-
tute has brought together an extraordinary, di-
verse network of leaders who will continue to 
make our state a better place to work and live. 
Over the past few decades, the program has 
produced leaders who have carried out posi-
tive change in healthcare, government, busi-
ness, and the non-profit sector—all of who 
lead with a stronger understanding of their 
commitment to the people they serve. 
I thank Valle del Sol, its community part-
ners, and everyone involved in this grassroots 
movement to make it the gold standard for 
healthcare and human services in the south-
west. Congratulations on 50 years of serving 
our children and families in Arizona. I am con-
fident their passion and service will continue to 
leave a lasting impression for the next 50 
years and beyond.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF ALMA 
G. STALLWORTH 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the memory of the late former Michigan 
State Representative Alma G. Stallworth, who 
passed away in August 2020. 
Alma Stallworth was born in Little Rock, Ar-
kansas, and eventually made her home in De-
troit, Michigan, where she attended Wayne 
State University. She went on to pursue public 
office, serving her first term as State Rep-
resentative from 1971 until 1974 and again, 
serving from 1983 until 1996. As a legislator, 
Alma Stallworth broke ground in her work in 
the civil rights movement, as well as crafting 
policy solutions to improve the quality of life 
for Michigan’s children and working families. 
Her example blazed the trail for countless 
women of color to pursue careers in public 
service. 
In 1985, Alma Stallworth founded the Black 
Caucus Foundation of Michigan, a non-profit 
organization dedicated to improving the lives 
of 
African-American 
communities 
across 
Michigan. Ms. Stallworth created the Black 
Caucus Foundation of Michigan’s Legislative 
Internship Program to allow African-Americans 
interested in public policy careers to gain in-
valuable experience while also earning college 
credit. Her work with the Black Caucus Foun-
dation has created a critical link for policy, 
communities, and businesses. 
Alma Stallworth was a true paragon of pub-
lic service. Please join me in honoring her leg-
acy.

September 4, 2020 
my office extends special recognition to 
women on the Central Coast who have made 
a difference in our community. I would like to 
recognize one outstanding Women of the Year 
Award recipient, Kathleen Baushke from Santa 
Barbara, California. 
Kathleen has had an immeasurable impact 
on our community through her work address-
ing our community’s ongoing problem with 
family homelessness. She is the longtime Ex-
ecutive Director of Transition House, a multi- 
faceted shelter, housing, and education non-
profit based in Santa Barbara. Under her lead-
ership, Transition House assists more than 
400 people every year. Approximately 70 per-
cent of the families who work through Transi-
tion House’s multi-stage programs move into 
permanent housing: a success rate of which 
few similar agencies can boast. 
Beyond her work within Transition House, 
Kathleen has consistently reached outside the 
agency to provide logistical support, program 
advising, and financial expertise to other orga-
nizations assisting those experiencing home-
lessness. For example, Kathleen helped cre-
ate the Landlord Liaison Program, within Tran-
sition House, that works with local landlords to 
house mainly homeless veterans and children. 
Kathleen has served on the boards of other 
related nonprofits in Santa Barbara, including 
the St. Francis Foundation and Second Story, 
as well as on the advisory board of Storyteller 
Children’s Center. She is also a founding 
member of the advocacy group National Coali-
tion for Homelessness Solutions. She appears 
regularly in the media, at political events, and 
at community informational gatherings to ad-
vocate for compassionate, thoughtful. positive 
help for families and children experiencing cri-
sis. As many as half of the homeless people 
in America are families with children, and 
Kathleen has brought immense relief to this 
vulnerable population, leading her agency, its 
amazing staff, and hundreds of community 
volunteers toward ongoing solutions. 
She is a worthy candidate for this honor and 
a role model for community leaders of all 
kinds. I am honored to recognize Kathleen for 
her continued commitment to improving our 
community and the residents of Santa Barbara 
county. I ask all Members to join me today in 
honoring an exceptional woman of California’s 
24th 
Congressional 
District, 
Kathleen 
Baushke, for her incredible service to her 
community.

RECOGNIZING 
DR.

AMUNDSON ON HIS SERVICE TO 
THE WASHINGTON CHAPTER OF 
PHYSICIANS 
FOR 
SOCIAL 
RE-
SPONSIBILITY 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
it is my privilege to rise to honor Dr. Bruce 
Amundson on the incredible work he has done 
while serving on the Board of the Washington 
Chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility 
(WPSR) and congratulate him on his retire-
ment. 
Dr. Amundson was a member of the chapter 
for 40 years and served as president in 2014. 
As president he brought a much-needed re-
surgence of energy to the chapter. Through 
tireless effort and countless hours working 
with staff, contacting members, recruiting part-
ners, and securing financial support, Bruce 
succeeded in bringing the chapter back to life, 
with a revitalized purpose for the health-based 
advocacy community. Under Bruce’s leader-
ship he grew the chapter to nearly 1,000 
members, making it one of the most produc-
tive and successful in the country. 
Bruce was vital in bringing a voice to the 
most critical public health issues of our time 
including nuclear proliferation, climate change, 
and more. Bruce was integral in helping estab-
lish the largest anti-nuclear coalition of its kind 
in the country, the Washington Against Nu-
clear Weapons Coalition. His dedication to 
community health advocacy was unmatched 
and his expertise, passion, and efforts will be 
deeply missed by the entire community. The 
state of Washington is lucky to have had such 
a thoughtful voice working for the greater 
good. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Amundson for 
his dedicated service to the Washington Chap-
ter of Physicians for Social Responsibility 
where he never stopped working to bring the 
most pressing public health issues of our time 
to light, and I wish him a happy retirement.

HONORING EDDIE PAYTON 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
community servant, Mr. Eddie Payton. 
Eddie Payton, a native of Columbia, MS, is 
a 1973 graduate of Jackson State University. 
While at Jackson State, Eddie was a four-year 
letterman, three-year all SWAC player, SWAC 
Offensive Player of the Year, Ebony All Amer-
ican, and NAIA All American. 
Eddie was an NFL running back and kick 
returner who played five seasons in the NFL 
from 1977 to 1982. He played for the Cleve-
land Browns, Detroit Lions, Kansas City 
Chiefs, and Minnesota Vikings. In 1980, he led 
the NFL with 53 kickoff returns for 1,184 
yards. Eddie is one of three Detroit Lions to 
register two touchdowns off returns in a single 
game. His 98 yard kickoff return for a touch-
down is the fifth longest in Detroit history, and 
his 87 yard punt return stands as the third 
longest in franchise history. Eddie also played 
in the CFL for two seasons with the Ottawa 
Rough Riders and Toronto Argonauts and was 
the first player signed in franchise history with 
the Memphis Showboats of the WFL. 
After retiring from the NFL, Eddie returned 
to Jackson State to take the helm of the men’s 
golf program. In 1995 he started the women’s 
golf program. During his 30 years at Jackson 
State, his men’s golf team won 25 conference 
championships and his women’s team won 16 
conference championships. Additionally, his 
men’s team won 8 National Minority Cham-
pionships and his women’s team won 4 Na-
tional Minority Championships. Eddie was 
named SWAC Coach of the year 25 times and 
National Minority Coach of the Year 6 times. 
Eddie’s teams made history by becoming the 
first teams from an HBCU to compete in the 
NCAA Men’s and Women’s Golf Champion-
ships. He has also had seven players to com-
pete professionally. Eddie finished his career 
as the winningest coach in SWAC history. 
Eddie has been inducted into the Marion 
County Sports Hall of Fame, Jackson State 
University Sports Hall of Fame, SWAC Hall of 
Fame, National Black Golfers Hall of Fame, 
and the African American Golf Association 
Hall of Fame. 
Eddie is the Executive Director of the 
Payton Family Foundation, which has awarded 
92 scholarships totaling over 3.1 million dol-
lars. He is also a member of Phi Beta Sigma 
Fraternity, Inc. and a member of the Mis-
sissippi Athletic Commission. 
Since his retirement, Eddie does his favorite 
past-times and can be found on the golf 
course, fishing or hunting. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Eddie Payton for his 
dedication and tenacity to serving the commu-
nity and the desire to be an example for all.

LEZOTTE QUICK 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to 
Patricia Lezotte Quick as she celebrates her 
100th birthday. This significant milestone is 
worthy of commendation. 
Over the course of her lifetime, Patricia 
Quick has become a pillar of Rockwood. Patri-
cia was born in the city on August 15, 2020, 
and remained in Rockwood for the next 96 
years. As the only child of Edith and Eugene 
Lezotte, Patricia had a happy childhood play-
ing with neighborhood friends, seeing movies, 
canoeing the Huron River, and taking the 
inter-urban trolley from Rockwood to down-
town Detroit. After receiving her license at the 
age of 12, Patricia enjoyed driving her 1924 
Hudson Super 6 to Detroit to shop at her fa-
vorite stores and occasionally treat herself to 
a famous Sander’s hot fudge cream puff. 
Throughout her youth, Patricia attended Rock-
wood Elementary School, St. Mary’s Catholic 
School, and Rockwood High School, where 
she sang in choir, played basketball, and stud-
ied Latin. She also took ballet lesson, and 
continued dancing throughout her 20s. At the 
age of 18, Patricia began working at the Rock-
wood Post Office. She rose to the position of 
assistant postmistress, and then served as su-
perintendent of postal operations until retiring 
in 1981. In 1940, she also worked as a U.S. 
Census worker throughout Rockwood, Bran-
don Township, and Romulus. 
In 1943, Patricia married her husband, John 
Quick, and the two had an adventurous mar-
riage for 73 years before John’s passing in 
2015. Together, they visited all 50 states, 
every Mexican state, and each Canadian prov-
ince. Patricia is known for her optimistic atti-
tude, love for nature and animals, and com-
passion for all. She has been active in animal 
rescue, her church, community service, and 
other civic organizations. Thanks to her im-
mense knowledge of the city and love of his-
tory, Patricia was one of the founders of the 
Rockwood Area Historical Society in 1973 and

REPRESENTATIVE 
JEAN 
FARMER-BUTTERFIELD TO THE 
NORTH CAROLINA EMPLOYMENT 
SECURITY BOARD OF REVIEW 
HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize and celebrate the confirmation of 
Representative Jean Farmer-Butterfield to the 
North Carolina Employment Security Board of 
Review. 
Representative Farmer-Butterfield proudly 
represented Wilson County for nearly two dec-
ades in the North Carolina House of Rep-
resentatives. During that time, she distin-
guished herself as a committed public servant 
and advocate for the people of Wilson County. 
Farmer-Butterfield was celebrated by her 
peers on both sides of the aisle for her power-
ful skills in negotiation and ability to find com-
promise amongst her colleagues. In her time 
serving in the North Carolina General Assem-
bly, she rightly developed a reputation as a 
lawmaker capable of achieving goals through 
bipartisan agreement. 
As a Representative, she was a champion 
of mental health and substance abuse issues, 
public schools and early childhood education, 
and economic development in Wilson County 
and throughout eastern North Carolina. For 
nine consecutive terms, Wilson County resi-
dents 
voiced 
their 
approval 
of 
Farmer- 
Butterfield’s zealous and impactful advocacy 
for them and demonstrated their appreciation 
and confidence in her through their votes. 
Now, she will continue her long career of 
public service on the Board of Review where 
her intellect and work ethic will benefit many 
across North Carolina. I commend Governor 
Cooper for his nomination of Representative 
Farmer-Butterfield and the General Assembly 
for confirming her appointment. 
On behalf of the residents of the First Con-
gressional District of North Carolina and espe-
cially those in Wilson County, I thank Rep-
resentative Farmer-Butterfield for her many 
years of dedicated service in the North Caro-
lina House of Representatives and wish her 
continued success on the North Carolina Em-
ployment Security Board of Review. 
Congratulations, Jean.

Friday, September 4, 2020 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam

rine Corps, Major Rob Miller honorably served

the local veteran community. He has hosted

secutive years on Veterans Day, and he has 
regularly participated in marathons honoring 
veterans. Miller is active in his community, 
where he is involved with his local church and 
is a member of the Bixby Rotary Club. Rob

Women of the Year Award. I would like to rec-
ognize one outstanding Women of the Year

entire professional life to surgery and care of 
women with gynecologic and breast cancer. 
When patients are in Dr. Rodriguez’s care,

ways. For the last four years, she has served 
on the Board of Directors of the Cottage 
Health System, is the Chair of the Department 
of Surgery at Cottage Hospital and sits on the

ance. She was a founding Board member of

anthropic organization that teaches young 
men from 7th to 12th grade about the impor-
tance of giving back to the community through 
volunteering. Anne has volunteered with nu-
merous local organizations, including the 
Goleta Public Library, Teen Court, Art from 
Scrap, the Santa Barbara Rescue Mission, 
Santa Barbara Bike Coalition, the Santa Bar-
bara Zoo, Santa Barbara Wildlife Care Net-
work, Montessori Center School, and the MAD 
Academy at Santa Barbara High School. 
Anne is humble about the extent of the 
commitments she juggles and her importance 
to the lives of her patients; she will always 
step up to help the community or a patient in 
need. That incredible work ethic and spirit of 
service has made Anne a beloved resident of 
the Central Coast. 
I ask all Members to join me today in hon-
oring an exceptional woman of California’s

Film Series, which comprises film screenings, 
panel 
discussions, 
book 
readings 
and 
signings, and lectures to promote awareness,

fostering cultural exchange. 
Over the years, Mr. Ferrell has worked tire-
lessly to educate the community by creating 
awareness about the countless achievements 
and contributions of African-Americans. Please 
join me in recognizing his fine example.

REMEMBERING 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
OF 
JOHN 
J. 
DOYLE OF ARDMORE, PENNSYL-
VANIA 
HON. MARY GAY SCANLON 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate the life of John J. Doyle, a con-
stituent of mine from Ardmore, Pennsylvania, 
who passed away suddenly earlier this month. 
Mr. Doyle was a devoted and loving husband 
of Maura, father to Kerry and Erin; and grand-
father to Vivian, Rowan, Eve, Peter and Annie; 
and brother to Elaine O’Malley, Bernice Ayers, 
Mary Doyle, and Barry Doyle. John served his 
country as an officer in the Navy and was a 
community and business leader who will be 
sorely missed by his family, friends, neighbors, 
and all who knew him. 
John was an accomplished business execu-
tive who was on the leadership team of the 
international nonprofit, the Project Manage-
ment Institute (PMI). At PMI, John developed 
the accreditation institute’s important relation-
ship with China, promoting high standards for 
business and project management around the 
world. John’s work at PMI capped off a long 
and distinguished career, including work with 
Biological Abstracts and the Archdiocese of 
Philadelphia. 
John served his community as Chairman of 
the Advisory Board of St. Barnabas School, a 
primary school, providing high quality and low- 
cost education to students of all faiths in Phila-
delphia. He earned his Bachelor’s degree from 
St. Joseph’s University and his MBA from the 
University of Notre Dame. 
John had a life well lived and was taken 
from this world too soon. He will be missed. 
RECOGNIZING DEBORAH WRIGLEY 
AND 
HER 
CONTRIBUTIONS 
TO 
AMERICA 
AND 
THE 
HOUSTON 
METROPOLITAN 
AREA 
OVER 
FOUR DECADES AS A LEADING 
AND INFLUENTIAL JOURNALIST 
FOR TELEVISION STATION KTRK 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to honor Deborah Wrigley for the unparalleled 
service she has rendered to the residents of 
the Houston metropolitan area over the past 
40 years as one of the area’s leading journal-
ists and to commend her example to young 
reporters on the fiduciary responsibility of all 
members of the Fourth Estate to understand 
and faithfully execute the responsibilities of 
civic education and governmental account-
ability reposed in them by the drafters of the 
First Amendment. 
Deborah Wrigley will be retiring this month 
after the completion of a 42-year career in 
journalism, most recently with television sta-
tion KTRK–TV. 
Deborah Wrigley graduated from the Univer-
sity of Houston with a degree from its pres-
tigious English department initially did not plan 
a career in television but it is not surprising 
that she finally did given that her father was a 
leading Hollywood cinematographer and her 
mother loved literature. 
Deborah Wrigley was hired by KTRK–TV as 
a minority trainee in 1978 and over the next 
42 years reported on important events affect-
ing or occurring in the Houston area as the 
city grew to become the largest city in Texas 
and the fourth largest in the nation. 
Deborah Wrigley reported live from Gal-
veston, Texas throughout the night when Hur-
ricane Alicia hit, risking driving off the Gal-
veston seawall at the height of the storm to 
get the stories back to the station. 
Deborah Wrigley loved covering politics, 
from City Hall to the Texas Legislature, na-
tional stories and neighborhood issues, hurri-
canes and other natural disasters, including 
the Mexico City earthquake in 1985 for which 
she received a Headliner Club award. 
Deborah Wrigley never forgot or lost sight of 
the fact that another important role of the print 
and electronic media is to serve the people, to 
illuminate their struggles and problems and 
achievements; she knows Houston because 
she always listened to its people and their 
concerns and tirelessly worked to bring atten-
tion to the need to find solutions. 
Deborah Wrigley’s final stories involved the 
work on the frontlines of fighting the COVID– 
19 pandemic, such as efforts to bring testing 
to underserved communities, which she under-
stood would save thousands of lives. 
Not only was Deborah Wrigley an eye-wit-
ness to many historic events, she made his-
tory of her own by becoming the longest-serv-
ing female television news reporter ever in 
Houston and one of the longest serving in the 
history of the country. 
Deborah Wrigley has often expressed how 
grateful she is to those who helped her 
through it all, from the people she interviewed 
to the audiences who watched and trusted her 
to deliver the news fairly and accurately. 
Madam Speaker, I take great pride in recog-
nizing and honoring Deborah Wrigley whose 
extraordinary career and commitment to serv-
ing her community through delivering the news 
fully and fairly has helped make our nation 
better on its inexorable march toward becom-
ing a more perfect union.

HONORING DR. THOMAS 
CAMPBELL 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to recognize Dr. Thomas Campbell, a re-
spected leading researcher in the area of 
speech and language skills and the longtime 
Executive Director of the Callier Center for 
Communication Disorders at the University of 
Texas at Dallas (UTD) in Texas’ Third Con-
gressional District. 
Tom Campbell earned his bachelor’s and 
master’s degrees from the University of Ne-
braska-Lincoln and his Ph.D. from the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin-Madison. After spending sev-
eral years at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hos-
pital in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada where he 
conducted studies of the speech and language 
skills of children recovering from traumatic 
brain injuries, Dr. Campbell’s work took him to 
the University of Pittsburgh where he served 
as a faculty member in the Department of 
Communication Science and Disorders. 
Following his later service as Director of 
Audiology and Communication Disorders at 
the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, in 2006 
Dr. Campbell was named the Executive Direc-
tor of the Callier Center for Communication 
Disorders in Dallas, Texas. 
For the past fourteen years, Dr. Campbell 
has built a successful education and research 
enterprise leading to UTD’s undisputed reputa-
tion as a national model for the study of com-
munication disorders. Due to his steadfast 
leadership, the Callier Center is consistently 
ranked in the top ten of graduate programs 
nationwide in the areas of audiology and 
speech-language pathology. 
Among his many achievements, Dr. Camp-
bell is credited with the establishment of the 
Callier postdoctoral program, the creation of 
both the Callier Prize in Communication Dis-
orders and the Ruth and Ken Altshuler Callier 
Care Award. He is also credited with the 2016 
construction of the new Callier building on the 
UTD Richardson campus. 
Dr. Campbell’s most lasting legacy lies in 
the many lives he has influenced through his 
work. Known as a ‘‘humble teacher and terrific 
role model’’ it is evident respect for this con-
summate servant leader runs deep among all 
who have interacted with him, patients and 
peers alike. 
As Dr. Campbell prepares to begin a new 
season of life, along his wife, Dr. Christine 
Dollaghan, I ask my colleagues in the United 
States House of Representatives to join me in 
recognizing him for his selfless and dedicated 
efforts as the Executive Director of the Callier 
Center at the University of Texas at Dallas 
and to wish him well in his future endeavors.

HONORING THE LIFE OF EDWARD 
M. COURSE JR. 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a re-
markable individual, Edward McCoy Course 
Jr. 
Mr. Course, 68, died Tuesday, July 7, 2020, 
in Greenwood, Mississippi. He was the long-
est-serving deacon at Providence Missionary 
Baptist Church and the church secretary. Mr. 
Course was also a life member of the Mis-
sissippi Valley State University National Alum-
ni Association and past president of its Leflore 
County chapter. He served as chairman of the 
Leflore County Election Commission for 41 
years and worked for the Mississippi State De-
partment of Health for 30 Years, serving as 
district supervisor of environmental quality. 
Working in the civil rights movement at an 
early age, he marched as a boy and later 
worked within the NAACP for a short time. Mr. 
Course displayed a willingness to give back to 
the community, to work, and asked for very lit-
tle in return. He spent all his life at Providence 
and was beloved by many. 
As chairman of the election commission, he 
would help with voter registration drives, going 
to local high schools, and MVSU to ensure 
people understood the processes and volun-
teering to make sure everything was run 
smoothly. He was able to offer a wealth of 
knowledge to all those around him. 
Mr. Course is survived by his wife of 43 
years, Mrs. Linda Course of Greenwood; a 
special niece, Jakayla Rayford of Greenwood; 
six sisters, Marjorie Course of Houston, 
Texas, Joyce Ann Course and Sandra Course, 
both of Greenwood, Katie Course and Denise 
(Thad) Johnson, both of Jackson, and Gail 
(Lucious) Lewis of Clinton; and two brothers, 
Ervin Course of Greenwood and Terrence 
Course (Celdrick) of Carrollton. 
Mrs. Course said that her husband lived by 
a simple sentiment that she feels personifies 
the message they wanted to share to the 
world: ‘‘Never lose faith or give up.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Mr. Edward McCoy 
Course Jr., in which he was a faithful commu-
nity leader, worker, and motivator.

TRIBUTE TO TRACY BEARD—CALI-
FORNIA’S 24TH CONGRESSIONAL 
WOMEN OF THE YEAR 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, each 
year, through the Women of the Year Award, 
my office extends special recognition to 
women on the Central Coast who have made 
a difference in our community. I would like to 
recognize one outstanding Women of the Year 
Award recipient, Tracy Beard of Solvang, Cali-
fornia. 
Tracy Beard currently serves as Executive 
Director of the Solvang Chamber of Com-
merce, the President of the Association of 
California Commissions for Women (ACCW), 
and as Commissioner for Santa Barbara 
County for the past nine years. In her various 
capacities, Tracy is a champion for education 
and works to empower women to be entre-
preneurs and create sustainable businesses. 
She has created programs on entrepreneurial 
education and collaborated with teachers and 
local entrepreneurs in Santa Ynez, Solvang, 
Lompoc, and Santa Barbara to inspire the 
next generation. 
As a board member of TVSB since 2014, 
Tracy is working to increase media literacy for 
youth. She is Co-Founder and Executive Pro-
ducer for the International Women’s Festivals, 
which began in Santa Barbara in 2008 and 
are now celebrated in cities across the country 
and around the world, including in China and 
Ireland. In March 2020 Tracy was named one 
of the most influential people in California by 
the International Women’s Festivals executive 
committee. 
Tracy received the Volunteer of the Year— 
Presidential Award from President Obama for 
her leadership at the Boys and Girls Club of 
Santa Barbara, where she raised awareness 
and funds for STEM programs. It is my honor 
to recognize Tracy who had given countless 
hours to educating the next generation in our 
community. 
I ask all Members to join me today in hon-
oring an exceptional woman of California’s 
24th Congressional District, Tracy Beard, for 
her incredible service to her community.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
KATHLEEN 
LOMAKO FOR A DISTINGUISHED 
CAREER WITH THE SOUTHEAST 
MICHIGAN COUNCIL OF GOVERN-
MENTS 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to 
Kathleen Lomako as she celebrates her retire-
ment and recognize her many years of distin-
guished service with the Southeast Michigan 
Council of Governments. Her contributions to 
Michigan are worthy of commendation. 
Kathleen Lomako has dedicated much of 
her professional career to working in various 
positions at the Southeast Michigan Council of 
Governments 
(SEMCOG). 
She 
joined 
SEMCOG in 1979, and quickly became a pillar 
of the organization. Since 2014, Lomako has 
served as executive director, where she has 
overseen a staff of 66 and has led SEMCOG’s 
efforts to address a variety of multi-commu-
nity, regional issues such as transportation, 
water quality, air quality, solid waste, land use, 
community and economic development, and 
data analysis. Beyond SEMCOG, Lomako has 
also been president of the Metropolitan Affairs 
Coalition (MAC), a nonprofit public/private 
partnership dedicated to enhancing the eco-
nomic vitality and quality of life in Southeast 
Michigan. 
Kathleen Lomako has held several other 
leadership positions and is known throughout 
the community as a passionate leader who ef-
fects change. She was vice chair of the Michi-
gan Infrastructure Council, chair of the Execu-
tive Director Council at the Association of Re-
gional Councils, and served as board member, 
treasurer, and vice president of the Michigan 
Chapter of the American Planning Association. 
Lomako was president of the Heat and 
Warmth Fund, and has also sat on the boards 
of Inforum, the Urban Land Institute, and the 
Michigan Society of Association Executives. In 
addition, Lomako has been a fierce advocate 
for women, serving as a board member and 
officer with the Women’s Economic Club and 
a board member with the Michigan Chapter of 
Women in Transportation. 
Without a doubt, Kathleen Lomako has de-
voted her career to serving Michigan and has 
worked tirelessly to ensure it remains a fruitful, 
safe, and prosperous place. Across all capac-
ities, Lomako has been recognized as a dedi-
cated, compassionate, and humble leader who 
strives to make a meaningful difference. She 
has been the voice of reason in challenging 
times and has encouraged all to work together 
to better our state. Her efforts have trans-
formed Michigan, and her impact will forever 
be remembered. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the retirement of Kathleen 
Lomako. I am proud to honor her work, ac-
complishments, and significant community im-
pact. We thank her for her outstanding service 
and wish her the best of luck in her future en-
deavors.

V-J DAY 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to honor the veterans of the 
First District of Oklahoma, who served in the 
Pacific Theater of the Second World War, in 
remembrance of Victory over Japan Day, com-
monly known as V-J Day. 
Following the surrender of Japanese forces 
on August 15, 1945, President Harry Truman 
proclaimed, ‘‘This is a victory of more than 
arms alone. This is a victory of liberty over tyr-
anny.’’ The dark years of fighting had finally 
come to an end, through the bravery and sac-
rifice of a generation of Americans. 
As we stand here seventy-five years later, 
their legacy reminds us of God’s grace, the 
true meaning of honor, and the unimaginable 
blessing bestowed on each and every one of 
us to live in the United States of America. 
Today, I honor some of the bravest warriors 
on the face of the earth—heroes who were 
willing to venture into unknown territories to 
meet an uncertain fate, who weathered un-
imaginable circumstances. 
When their nation called, men and women 
left their families, spouses, and children to go 
to a foreign place stricken with war and sav-
agery, all because they knew the United 
States of America was the last great hope on 
earth. Those who served not only saved our 
nation and our world from tyranny, but they 
changed the course of history forever. 
As the news of the war ending spread 
around the world, we can only now imagine 
the thrill of emotions that spread like fire 
through country sides and city squares across 
America. Millions of people took to the streets, 
many of which were covered with blizzards of 
confetti, and citizens crowded into churches to

thank God for this victory and for the begin-
ning of a new era of peace. 
Yet, seventy-five years later, we are still re-
minded of the true cost of that peace. Our cur-
rent generation has also witnessed the sac-
rifice of American lives in the name of free-
dom. While our nation always attempts to pro-
tect American lives through any diplomatic 
tools available, human history reveals the sad 
reality that sometimes the liberty of all must be 
defended by a brave few. As Winston Church-
ill is often attributed as stating, ‘‘We sleep 
soundly in our beds because rough men stand 
ready in the night to visit violence on those 
who would do us harm.’’ 
As a society, we must remember and edu-
cate our children to ensure that future genera-
tions never forget the heroes that saved our 
world from tyranny and destruction. Americans 
gather on V-J day to do just that: celebrate the 
greatest generation—those who came back 
home and those who laid down their lives on 
the field of battle. 
With the utmost humility, l recognize and 
honor those who served in the Second World 
War throughout the Pacific Theater and be-
yond. It is the greatest honor to live in a coun-
try with such valiant men and women, much 
less to represent so many of them in Con-
gress. 
Victory over Japan Day is a necessary re-
minder of not only the enormous sacrifice and 
triumph of American warfighters over tyran-
nical empires, but ultimately, it exhibits the ca-
pacity of the American spirit to overcome all 
obstacles in order to complete the task at 
hand. I pray that we now, as Americans, face 
today’s tests and trials with the same resolve, 
unity, and honor as those brave patriots who 
shed their blood from the beaches of Nor-
mandy to the islands of Okinawa. May we, 
too, find victory in our day.

HONORING RUBY MONTGOMERY 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, September 4, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Ruby Mont-
gomery. 
‘‘Mama Ruby has faith’’ . . . her faith en-
abled the love she has shared with others— 
others who have grown now share her faith 
and believe her acts of kindness to be pre-
cious gifts—gifts that touch people’s hearts 
and are rooted right here in the Mississippi 
Delta. 
In fact, Ruby Montgomery, described by her 
children as, ‘‘a dedicated child of God’’, is a 
woman who shapes the lives of others and 
continues to dedicate her life to serve her chil-
dren and neighbors while being led by the 
Holy Spirit. 
As we learned, it is Ruby’s faith, her con-
fident belief and trust in The Lord, which has 
kept her going all these years. In addition, her 
testimony reveals that even from a very young 
age, Ruby was taught to practice kindness 
and humility, two ideals her parents, the late 
Rev. Rollie Lee and teacher Daisy Bell Lee of 
Lambert, Mississippi, taught her well. 
Ruby, the wife of the late TSGT William 
Henry Montgomery of Marks, Mississippi, who 
with her became proud parents of Deborah A. 
Simpson, Rhonda L. Montgomery, and Rod-
erick L. Montgomery. The pair also managed 
to care for their granddaughter, Tashunda 
Montgomery-Vaughn; 
great 
granddaughter, 
Ja’Brea Joiner; and four other grandchildren: 
Lacambrise, Ahbrae, Andre, and Desiree. 
But did the couple stop there? Of course 
not. They also committed to raise five foster 
children: Linda, Shelia, Patricia, Pamela, and 
Stephanie. And as a result, she inherited sev-
eral 
more 
grandchildren: 
Markus, 
Kim, 
Melanie, 
Teon, 
Nekeveonia, 
Herbert 
Jr., 
Altrevia, and Corderio. Onward, she inherited 
several more children: Joel, Anthony, Steph-
anie Reeder, Yolanda, Yameka, Lorraine, 
April, and their children. Now that is a big fam-
ily and makes this author wonder just how 
Mama Ruby had time for anything else. 
Questions come to mind: How does the first 
teacher teach in an integrated school system 
in Quitman County, raise dozens of kids, and 
go to work helping other children learn all 
day? Where did her energy and money come 
from when times were hard? Ruby credits The 
Lord. 
People whose lives have been touched by 
Mama Ruby know that she is a person who 
can be trusted. She is seen by so many as an 
inspiration to those around her and a living ex-
ample of how faith can impact the lives of 
those she has helped. Ruby is the person 
people come to with their problems, the one 
who comforts those in need, and the mother 
who cares for the sick in the body or in the 
spirit. 
By making time to mentor countless of chil-
dren in the community of Marks over the 
years, she unknowingly stepped into the per-
manent role of ‘‘Mama Ruby’’ for generation 
after generation, gaining the respect of the 
community and the trust of its members. 
For example, as a teacher in the Quitman 
County public school system for over 40 
years, retiring in 1993, Ruby gained the trust 
of her students, many of whom she opened 
the doors of her home to and also offered 
rides to church on Sunday. Many of these stu-
dents grew up and had their own children, 
who were also taught by Ruby—allowing her 
to impact one generation after another. 
However, the teaching did not stop in the 
classroom. In fact, at church, Ruby was also 
a teacher who shared the Bible with young 
minds. She serves as both a Sunday school 
and Bible study teacher. Even after teaching 
for over forty years, she does not tire of 
spending her energy toward young children’s 
education. Education, as we all know, is not 
limited to just the classroom. 
Ruby likes to educate teenagers as well. 
She and her husband always helped out the 
youth in the community who wished to work 
by hiring them to help around the store and 
teaching them the value of a dollar. 
You would think with all of this teaching 
going on there would not be room for much 
else in Mama Ruby’s life, but Ruby gives her 
time freely to community activities and out-
reach ministries. Ruby is currently serving as 
an active, committed, and dedicated member 
of Les-Grandes Soeurs Social Club of Lam-
bert, Marks, and Crenshaw, Mississippi, as 
well as in Memphis, TN. Here she serves on 
the planning committee in Marks, MS. The 
purpose of Les-Grandes Soeurs Social Club is 
to serve as big sisters in time of need, to pro-
vide training, recreational, social, and cultural 
activities for the community, and provide edu-
cational support through scholarship. Mama 
Ruby is a board member of Trinity Community 
Center and the Quitman County Development 
Organization of Marks, MS. She also served 
as chairman for the 2019 Annual September 
Song Festival. These experiences are not all 
that make Ruby an amazing person. Ruby be-
lieves this path was chosen for her, not by 
her. By following this path, Ruby has excelled 
at every stage in her life. Mama Ruby ‘‘got 
faith’’ . . . faith found because of God’s love 
for her is the love she has shared with others. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Ruby Montgomery for her 
dedication to serving her community and this 
great state.
