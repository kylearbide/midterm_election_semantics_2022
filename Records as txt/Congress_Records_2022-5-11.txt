PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, in a divided nation and 
world, use our lawmakers to bring 
order from chaos, harmony from dis-
cord, and truth from falsehood. Remind 
them that You alone are the way, the 
truth, and the life in good or bad times. 
Lord, give our Senators wisdom to 
provide our Nation and world with ex-
emplary models of excellence, integ-
rity, and faithfulness. Keep them from 
stumbling or slipping as they face the 
precarious challenges of today and to-
morrow. Lord, do for our legislators 
more than they can ask or imagine. 
And, Lord, continue to strengthen 
Ukraine. 
We pray in Your mighty Name. 
Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
before the day is over, every Member of 
this body will make a choice: vote to 
protect the fundamental rights of 
women across the country or stand 
with five conservative Justices ready 
to destroy these rights in one fell 
swoop. 
For half a century, Roe v. Wade has 
been the bedrock upon which women 
have secured the freedom to make 
their own decisions when it comes to 
their bodies. Few questions are more 
personal, more private, and more com-
plicated than those involving a preg-
nancy. Few decisions should be more 
out of bounds to the whims and judg-
ments of elected politicians, but that is 
precisely the doomsday scenario that 
now faces our country. 
Today’s vote is one of the most con-
sequential we will take in decades be-
cause for the first time in 50 years, a 
conservative 
majority—an 
extreme 
majority—on the Supreme Court is on 
the brink of declaring that women do 
not have freedom over their own bod-
ies—one of the longest steps back in 
the Court’s entire history; a decision, if 
enacted, that will go down as one of 
the worst Court decisions ever. The 
name of the decision will live in in-
famy. 
This morning, reports came out that 
the draft decision of last week remains 
the only one under discussion by the 
Court’s conservatives. If the Supreme 
Court follows through on that decision, 
it will be the greatest contraction of 
individual rights in generations. Our 
children will grow up in a world where 
they have fewer liberties than those 
who came before them. The United 
States, which has always aspired to ex-
pand freedoms, will take a shameful 
step backward. As I said, this decision 
will live in infamy. 
So when we say that today’s vote is 
one of the most important we have 
taken in decades, when we say it is not 
an abstract or theoretical exercise, 
when we say the consequences would be 
real and immediate and far-reaching, it 
is the truth. 
At least 80 million women live in 
States that would either instantly or 
very quickly ban abortions should Roe 
come to an end. If you are a woman 
seeking an abortion, a provider admin-
istering one, or even a friend giving a 
ride to a clinic, you could be pros-
ecuted as a criminal and be thrown in 
jail. This is not an exaggeration; it is

May 11, 2022 
already being proposed by many legis-
latures and in some cases is already 
the law on the books. If, God forbid, 
you are the victim of rape or incest, in 
many States, you discover that the 
laws in place could force you to carry 
your pregnancy to term against your 
will. 
This is a cruel, repressive, and dan-
gerous vision for our country, but it is 
precisely the future that MAGA Repub-
licans are working toward. It is pre-
cisely the outcome that extreme Re-
publicans have planned for. 
For 
years, 
Senate 
Republicans 
rubberstamped one extreme judge after 
another, plucked right out of the Fed-
eralist Society list, with the admitted 
goal to ‘‘pick away at Roe v. Wade,’’ as 
Leader MCCONNELL
stated. Without 
Senate Republicans skewing our courts 
to the hard right, Roe would not be on 
the brink of extinction. 
At the State level, radical MAGA Re-
publicans have pushed or enacted re-
strictions that ban abortions as early 
as 6 weeks, ban abortions with no ex-
ceptions for rape or incest, criminalize 
women and doctors, and prevent other 
States from offering reproductive care. 
The immensely cruel law in Texas 
could even punish doctors who pre-
scribe certain drugs to women in cases 
of a miscarriage. 
It gets worse. It gets worse. Leader 
MCCONNELL says that under a Repub-
lican Senate, a national ban on abor-
tion is ‘‘possible’’ without Roe. Let 
that sink in, America. A national ban 
on abortion is the extreme of extremes, 
and it is now possible in a Republican 
Senate, according to Leader MCCON-
NELL. Americans should listen to that. 
For the hard right, this has never 
been about States’ rights. This has 
never been about letting Texas choose 
its own path while California takes an-
other. Those arguments have now been 
exposed for what they are: hypocrisy. 
For MAGA Republicans, this has al-
ways been about making abortion ille-
gal everywhere, about making the bans 
in Texas apply equally to New York 
and California and Minnesota and ev-
erywhere in between. 
For all the times we heard Repub-
licans oppose expanding healthcare be-
cause 
‘‘the 
American 
people 
want 
healthcare decisions left up to their 
family and doctors,’’ the same hard- 
right radicals are now telling American 
women: Healthcare decisions will now 
be made by politicians and judges, not 
doctors, not families. MAGA Repub-
licans are telling American women: 
Your body, our choice. 
These laws are far outside the main-
stream of the country. According to a 
poll released this morning by POLIT-
ICO and Morning Consult, just 28 per-
cent of voters support overturning Roe 
v. Wade. Nearly 75 percent of Ameri-
cans, including a majority of Repub-
licans, oppose the radical notion of im-
prisoning women who receive an abor-
tion. Nearly 60 percent of Americans 
say they want political candidates to 
support access to abortion. That is why 
this issue will be one of the most im-
portant issues facing the voters in No-
vember. 
As Americans make their decisions 
in this year’s election, this question 
will not go away. Americans strongly 
oppose getting rid of Roe, and they will 
be paying close attention from now 
until November to Republicans who are 
responsible for its demise. 
So to my Republican colleagues who 
have spent the last week trying to talk 
about anything other than Roe, it is 
time to go on record. 
I ask my colleagues to think care-
fully about their vote and to reckon 
deeply about the consequences of a 
world where Roe is a thing of the past. 
Tens of millions of women are watch-
ing what will happen to the rights they 
have relied on for decades, and all of us 
will have to answer for this vote for 
the rest of our time in public office. 
Before the day is over, every Member 
of this body will make a choice: Stand 
with women to protect their freedoms 
or stand with MAGA Republicans and 
take our country into a dark and re-
pressive future. 
UKRAINE 
Madam President, now finally on a 
different note, yesterday, the House 
voted on an overwhelmingly bipartisan 
basis to approve a $40 billion emer-
gency aid package to support the peo-
ple of Ukraine in their fight against 
Putin’s aggression. 
This package is large, it is very much 
needed, and I am going to work with 
my colleagues to make sure we can 
move forward on this package as soon 
as we can. The President has called on 
both Chambers of Congress to act 
quickly, so act quickly we must. The 
House vote was overwhelmingly bipar-
tisan, and it should be no different in 
this Chamber. 
Time is of the essence because Presi-
dent Biden has made clear that the aid 
provided by Congress a few months ago 
is now near its end. As we acted quick-
ly and decisively a few months ago, we 
must do so again very, very soon, and 
I will make sure this is a priority for 
the Senate. 
We have a moral obligation to stand 
with our friends in Ukraine. The fight 
they are in is a struggle between de-
mocracy and authoritarianism itself, 
and we dare not relent or delay swift 
action to help our friends in need. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
the country just received yet another 
terrible inflation report. Yet again, 
overall inflation came in higher than 
expected: 8.3 percent. Inflation con-
tinues to stick right around its worst 
level in 40 years. 
The measure that the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics calls ‘‘core inflation’’ 
increased in April by twice as much as 
it increased in March. Food costs are 
way up. Housing costs are way up once 
again. 
President Biden has presided over 
one of the most expensive years for 
working families in modern American 
history. The national average gas price 
is the highest it has ever been in the 
history of our country. Americans are 
paying an average of $4.33 per gallon 
for regular. Diesel has also hit a record 
high; it is now $5.62 per gallon—a huge 
blow to Americans with trucks and 
tractors, to small businesses and fam-
ily farms. And, of course, it forces up 
the price of practically everything that 
travels on a truck to reach the scene of 
a store or a supermarket. Inflation on 
top of inflation. 
In my home State, Kentuckians are 
paying 34 percent more for propane and 
112 percent more for home heating oil 
than they were paying when Democrats 
took control of the government. 
Let me say that again. The price of 
home heating oil has more than dou-
bled since President Biden took office, 
a crushing blow—a crushing blow—to 
rural America, especially in States like 
Pennsylvania, 
Vermont, 
and 
New 
Hampshire. 
Democratic policies have fueled this 
runaway inflation. Their mistakes are 
why inflation has hit America much 
harder than other developed countries. 
Expert calculations say Democrats’ 
$2 trillion spending spree last March is 
directly responsible for as much as 3 
percentage points of our current infla-
tion. Even the prominent Democratic 
economist Jason Furman puts the 
number at 2.5 percent. If just one— 
one—Senate Democrat had the courage 
to vote with Republicans in March of 
2021, inflation today would be closer to 
5 percent instead of almost 81⁄2 percent. 
Steve Rattner was a top economic 
adviser to President Obama. He says 
the Democrats’ $2 trillion disaster will 
‘‘go down in history as an extraor-
dinary policy mistake’’ that put us 
‘‘way behind the curve on inflation.’’ 
That is Steve Rattner, top economic 
adviser to President Obama. 
Everyone knows where this inflation 
came from, but President Biden just 
can’t seem to admit it. He just makes 
excuses that no one is buying. 
Listen to a Democratic political ad-
viser, David Axelrod. He said: 
[Biden] was saying, you know, everything 
is Putin’s price hikes, inflation is Putin’s 
fault. People [simply] don’t believe that. 
According to David Axelrod: 
They know that we had inflation before 
this. They know that gas prices were high 
before this. . . . You can’t blame everything 
in the economy on Putin. 
David Axelrod. 
So it is this President and his all- 
Democratic 
government 
who 
have 
drained American families’ pocket-
books. And every poll—every poll— 
shows our citizens understand that sad 
reality all too well. 
WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2427 
May 11, 2022 
Democrats will prove their party has 
been totally captured by the far-left 
branch. 
My colleague, the Democratic leader, 
controls the schedule. He decides what 
we vote on. From inflation to the bor-
der crisis, to violent crime, there is no 
shortage of problems that deserve at-
tention, but, alas, today Democrats 
have decided to line up behind an ex-
treme and radical abortion policy. Our 
Democratic colleagues want to vote for 
abortion-on-demand 
through 
all 
9 
months, until the moment before the 
baby is born—a failed show vote that 
will only prove their own extremism. 
The Democrats’ radical bill is as ex-
treme as extreme gets. It ignores mod-
ern science. It is tone-deaf to public 
opinion. Nothing about their bill mere-
ly codifies the current case law on this 
issue. Their extreme proposal goes 
way, way beyond codifying the status 
quo. It would roll back many existing 
laws. 
Democrats’ bill would functionally 
allow elective abortion through all 9 
months, abortion until the moment of 
birth. We are currently one of only 
seven countries worldwide that allow 
elective abortion after 20 weeks. It puts 
us in a group with China and North 
Korea. This bill would take us to an 
even more extreme and darker place. 
Only 19 percent of Americans believe 
that abortion should be legal in most 
or all cases into the third trimester— 
only 19 percent of the American people. 
But 97 percent of House and Senate 
Democrats have cosponsored this bill 
that would have exactly that effect. 
Ninety-seven percent of Washington 
Democrats stand with the most radical 
19 percent of the country. Almost half 
the Senate is about to walk the plank 
for a position that fewer than one in 
five Americans actually support. 
In addition to 9 months of functional 
abortion-on-demand, the Democrats’ 
extreme bill would roll back basic 
health and safety regulations. It would 
roll back overwhelmingly popular safe-
guards such as waiting periods and in-
formed consent laws. Parental notifica-
tion would likely go out the window as 
well. Democrats would even rule out 
restrictions on sex-selective abortions. 
And their legislation takes direct aim 
at conscious protections and religious 
freedoms that protect Americans of 
faith who practice medicine. 
So let’s sum it up. This legislation 
would allow abortion to viable babies 
in the ninth month, with no waiting 
period or informed consent, at the 
hands of a nonphysician. Taxpayers 
could be forced to pay for it, and 
Catholic hospitals would be forced to 
perform it. 
Democrats could not have written 
more extreme legislation. They have 
let fringe activists lead them far away 
from the American people. More than 
60 percent of Americans support 24- 
hour waiting periods and requiring 
that doctors have admitting privileges. 
Even 
majorities 
of 
self-identified 
Democrats 
actually 
support 
those 
things. 
But 
Washington 
Democrats 
want to roll them back. Only 19 per-
cent of Americans want abortions to be 
entirely or mostly legal into the third 
trimester, but 97 percent of Wash-
ington Democrats back this bill. 
Democrats are melting down because 
the Supreme Court may—may—uphold 
a Mississippi law that would limit 
abortion after 15 weeks. That law 
would still be more liberal than the 
abortion laws in Switzerland, Ger-
many, or France. Today’s Democratic 
Party is extreme on an international 
scale. 
So, Madam President, it is chilling 
that anybody would write legislation 
like this in 2022. It is even more dis-
turbing that 97 percent of Washington 
Democrats have put their names on it. 
But the American people need to see 
what the far left has become. 
So I am glad—glad—the Senate will 
vote today. We will stand with the 
American people, stand with innocent 
life, and block the Democrats’ extreme 
bill. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from New Hamp-
shire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
have to disagree with the distinguished 
minority leader. 
The bill that we are going to vote on 
this afternoon is legislation that would 
ensure that the decisions about wheth-
er or not to have a child are made by 
women. It would codify Roe v. Wade to 
ensure that women make those deci-
sions—not the minority leader, not 
Justice Alito, not some politician 
someplace but women. And that is who 
should make those decisions. 
I rise today to add my voice to the 
chorus of American women who are 
standing together, arm in arm, to loud-
ly and clearly declare that we will not 
surrender our rights. 
Like the majority of women in New 
Hampshire and across this country, I 
was outraged by the leaked draft Su-
preme Court decision by Justice Alito 
that said that the Supreme Court 
would overturn Roe v. Wade; that they 
would overturn almost 50 years of 
rights that have been guaranteed to 
women. So I rise today on behalf of the 
women of New Hampshire and the 
women across this country, including 
my daughters and granddaughters and 
the generations that will follow them. 
I rise today that we must preserve a 
woman’s fundamental right to make 
our own decisions about our own bod-
ies, about our futures, and about our 
health. 
Like millions of women across the 
country, I was shocked to see that 
opinion, written by Justice Alito, indi-
cating that five Justices would vote in 
favor of overturning Roe. That deci-
sion, if it stands, would upend nearly 50 
years of precedent that says a woman’s 
healthcare decisions are ours and ours 
alone, in consultation with our fami-
lies, with our physicians, with our cler-
gy. 
This Nation is built on the bedrock of 
liberty. Our founding declaration holds 
that life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness is among the most essential 
of unalienable rights that are guaran-
teed to all Americans. The funda-
mental right to make decisions about 
our own bodies touches on each of 
these. 
The decision to have a child is one of 
the most personal and private that 
women and families make. And that is 
exactly who should make that decision, 
not some extreme politician in Wash-
ington or in State capitals across this 
Nation, not some Supreme Court Jus-
tice—people who know nothing about 
the circumstances that women and 
their families are facing. 
How dare they presume to substitute 
their judgment? What does it say about 
the moral righteousness, the self-right-
eousness of a politician or an unelected 
jurist over individual women on a mat-
ter that is so ultimately personal, so 
pivotal to every single aspect of the 
lives of women and families? 
We have already heard from the mi-
nority leader that Republicans, if they 
gain control of the Senate and the 
House, will seek a nationwide ban on 
abortion. It is a sad day when people at 
the highest levels of government, who 
are entrusted to defend our Constitu-
tion, to safeguard our citizens, can no 
longer be trusted to do either. 
Unfortunately, we know today that 
nearly half of the States in this coun-
try have already pushed through what 
we are calling trigger laws that would 
automatically roll back the clocks by 
half a century if Roe is repealed. That 
would immediately jeopardize the fates 
of millions of women across this coun-
try. Seventeen of those States would 
outlaw abortions even in cases of rape 
and incest. This is the extreme posi-
tion, the position that says that we 
should leave up to government, we 
should leave up to elected officials the 
decision about whether families should 
have 
children, 
the 
decision 
about 
whether a woman should have a child. 
That is who should make that decision, 
not a politician here, not a politician 
in my State capital of Concord, not a 
Supreme Court Justice but a woman— 
and her family—who understands her 
own circumstances, who knows what 
she and her family need. 
We need to ensure that the freedom 
for women to make these decisions is 
guaranteed. That is what this vote is 
about this afternoon to codify Roe v. 
Wade. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2428 
May 11, 2022 
today. One, this legislation does not 
represent the views of a majority of the 
American people, and two, this legisla-
tion is some of the most extreme abor-
tion legislation in the world. 
It is a little hard to believe we are 
having a vote on this bill again mere 
weeks after it was defeated in the Sen-
ate, but I guess when the abortion 
lobby calls, our Democrat colleagues 
come running. 
The bill before us today, the so-called 
Women’s Health Protection Act, would 
prop up the abortion industry and 
make 
abortion-on-demand—at 
any 
time, for essentially any reason—the 
law of the land. 
My Democratic colleagues would like 
to convey the impression that, with 
this legislation, they are merely at-
tempting to codify a widely held belief 
from which no reasonable American 
dissents. That is baloney. The Amer-
ican people don’t even come close to 
supporting 
abortion-on-demand 
up 
until the moment of birth. 
Gallup has been polling on abortion 
for decades. In all that time, the per-
centage of Americans who believe abor-
tion should be legal under any cir-
cumstance has always remained under 
35 percent. An Associated Press poll 
from this past June found that 65 per-
cent of Americans believe that abor-
tion should generally be illegal in the 
second trimester—or from about 13 
weeks of pregnancy—while a whopping 
80 percent of Americans believe that 
abortion should generally be illegal in 
the third trimester. Why? Well, I sus-
pect it is because the American people 
are well aware that when we are talk-
ing about abortion, we are talking 
about the killing of human beings, in-
nocent human beings, and that is not 
exactly something most Americans are 
comfortable with. Americans are used 
to defending the weak and the inno-
cent, not killing. So it is not exactly 
surprising that Americans are not join-
ing the Democratic Party and whole-
heartedly embracing abortion up until 
the moment of birth. 
Democrats do everything they can to 
run away from the humanity of the un-
born baby, but they are fighting a los-
ing battle because science and medical 
technology and plain old common sense 
all point inexorably to the humanity of 
the unborn child. 
It is pretty hard to look at a fully 
formed baby on an ultrasound kicking 
her feet and sucking her thumb and 
think she is anything but a human 
being. Once you have acknowledged the 
self-evident truth that baby is a human 
being, it is pretty hard to argue that 
she shouldn’t be protected. So it is no 
surprise that, almost 50 years after 
Roe, Americans still do not whole-
heartedly embrace abortion. 
In addition to being totally out of 
step with the American mainstream, 
Democrats’ ‘‘Abortion on Demand Act’’ 
is also far outside the mainstream of 
abortion law globally. Thirty-nine of 
the forty-two European countries that 
allow elective abortion limit such 
abortions to 15 weeks or earlier. Thir-
ty-two of those countries limit elective 
abortion to at or before 12 weeks’ ges-
tation. Meanwhile, Democrats here in 
the U.S. Senate want to enshrine abor-
tion-on-demand up until the moment of 
birth. 
Thanks to Roe v. Wade, our country 
is already outside the global main-
stream when it comes to protecting un-
born human beings. In fact, we are cur-
rently one of just a tiny handful of 
countries in the world that allow elec-
tive abortions past 20 weeks of preg-
nancy. Who is on that list among those 
other countries? China, North Korea— 
not exactly the kind of company we 
want to be keeping when it comes to 
defending human rights. 
But the so-called Women’s Health 
Protection Act is even more extreme 
than Roe. Not only would it allow 
abortion through all 40 weeks of preg-
nancy, it would sweep away almost 
every commonsense restriction that 
has been upheld since Roe—parental 
notification, informed consent, waiting 
periods. All of those would be gone 
under Democrats’ abortion-on-demand 
bill. Plus, it would open the door to 
Federal funding of abortion, forcing 
Americans who oppose abortion to sub-
sidize it with their tax dollars—some-
thing that has been bipartisan con-
sensus, again, for decades in this coun-
try. 
Furthermore, under this legislation, 
conscience protections for doctors and 
hospitals who do not want to perform 
abortions would be in jeopardy. The 
Democratic leader has suggested that 
this bill would not jeopardize the right 
of Catholic hospitals to refuse to per-
form abortions. I would like to believe 
it, but it is pretty hard to do so when 
this bill removes the right to invoke 
the Religious Freedom Restoration Act 
as a defense. 
The Religious Freedom Restoration 
Act, of course, is a 1993 law passed by 
Congress to ensure that Americans’ 
constitutional right to live in accord-
ance with their religious beliefs is pro-
tected. That law was actually spon-
sored by the Democratic leader—back, 
I should add, when the Democratic 
Party still believed in protecting reli-
gious freedom. 
While I would love to believe the 
Democrats are still interested in pro-
tecting conscience rights, it is pretty 
hard to believe when their bill takes 
steps to prevent providers from claim-
ing protection under the Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act. Why would 
you include such a provision in your 
legislation unless you intended to 
make sure that healthcare providers 
could not cite their religious faith to 
ensure that they are not forced to par-
ticipate in abortions? 
With the legislation before us today, 
Democrats aren’t attempting to codify 
some widely held consensus on abor-
tion; rather, they are attempting to 
codify the most extreme views of the 
extreme pro-abortion lobby, make no 
mistake about it. 
It is pretty sad that the Democratic 
Party has come to this. The party that 
has historically portrayed itself as the 
defender of the little guy is now the 
party seeking to deny even the small-
est protections to the littlest and most 
vulnerable guys and girls among us, 
unborn human beings. But, hey, I guess 
Democrats can at least claim that they 
are standing up for the abortion indus-
try. 
I believe that we are better than this. 
We have to be better than this. 
I hope that not only Republicans but 
some of my Democratic colleagues will 
stand up today and say that we can do 
better than a law that rips away even 
the smallest protections for unborn 
Americans. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask 
for one minute before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. STABENOW. I find it just very 
frustrating to hear from my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle about how 
we are extreme because we are sup-
porting a woman’s freedom to make 
her own reproductive health decisions. 
That is the vote today. The vote today 
is about who decides, who decides 
under Roe v. Wade when the third tri-
mester—which, by the way, abortions 
can only be done to save the life of the 
health of the mother—who decides 
that? The people on this floor? The Re-
publicans who think it is their right to 
decide it? Who decides it? The United 
States Supreme Court? Who decides in 
the most personal decisions—and some-
times 
those 
agonizing 
decisions—a 
woman will ever have to make, the 
question is: Who decides? Fifty years of 
freedom is what we are talking about 
Republicans 
eliminating 
with 
this 
vote. Fifty years of freedom for women 
to decide what we need to do as it re-
lates to our own healthcare and repro-
ductive freedom. 
So I strongly support the women of 
this country. I believe in them. I be-
lieve in us. I trust them. I trust us. And 
this is about their choice, not a bunch 
of politicians deciding what is best for 
them. 
I yield the floor. 
VOTE ON MOTION TO DISCHARGE 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the question is on 
agreeing to the motion to discharge. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask 
for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll.

WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today at a pivotal 
time for women’s rights in this coun-
try. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Senators 
BLUMENTHAL and MURRAY and many 
others, including Senator BALDWIN, for 
their leadership on this issue and on 
the Women’s Health Protection Act. 
We learned last week that it is very 
likely that the Supreme Court will 
overrule Roe v. Wade. The leaked opin-
ion made it clear. It means the Su-
preme Court is on track to completely 
overrule Roe, stripping women of their 
constitutional right to seek an abor-
tion. It will also be, I note, against the 
wishes of the somewhere between 70 
and 80 percent of Americans who be-
lieve that this is a decision that should 
be made between a woman and her doc-
tor—not with Senator CRUZ, not a 
bunch of politicians in Washington, but 
a decision that should be made between 
a woman and her doctor. 
Fifty years stripped away of women’s 
rights, and the fall will be swift. Over 
20 States already have laws in place 
that could be used to restrict access, 
including 13 which will automatically 
go into effect if the Supreme Court 
issues the decision. We have also seen 
States preparing to take even more ex-
treme steps if Roe is overturned. Last 
week, Republican lawmakers in Lou-
isiana advanced a bill to immediately 
classify abortion as homicide and allow 
the State to prosecute women—pros-
ecute women—for receiving care. Ear-
lier this year, a bill was introduced by 
Republican legislators in Missouri to 
allow private citizens to sue people 
who help women leave the State to get 
care. This comes on top of the 19 States 
that already have laws in place to ban 
or restrict access to medication abor-
tion. 
What this all comes down to is a fun-
damental question: Who is making 
these personal decisions—politicians or 
a woman? And are women equal citi-
zens under the law? If Roe is over-
turned, women in this country will re-
ceive different treatment under the law 
than men, and our access to critical 
care will be at the mercy of a patch-
work of laws. 
We have all seen what happens on the 
ground when these kinds of restrictions 
are enacted. Texas’s law last year de-
nies access to at least 85 percent of pa-
tients seeking abortion-related serv-
ices. Some women in Texas have had to 
drive nearly 250 miles one way to get 
care. No one should have to take a bus 
across the country to make a personal 
healthcare decision. A woman in Lou-
isiana or in Missouri or in Texas should 
not be treated differently than a 
woman in Minnesota. 
While we are all deeply disturbed by 
the impact this decision will have on 
women and the men who stand with 
them, unfortunately, many of us have 
seen this coming. Republicans have 
been methodically preparing for this 
moment, stacking the courts with 
judges who want to overturn Roe and 
introducing over 500 bills in States 
across the country limiting access to 
care. 
While this is still a draft decision, I 
am 
seriously 
concerned 
that 
the 
Court’s apparent willingness to dis-
regard nearly 50 years of rights will not 
only put women’s health at risk but 
will undermine the rule of law. 
This draft leaked opinion brings us 
back to the fifties. The issue is, we al-
ways thought it would be the 1950s 
when it is truly the 1850s. The people of 
this country do not want to go back-
wards when it comes to their freedoms, 
because that is what this is about— 
their freedom to make their own deci-
sions. 
So what can the Senate do in the face 
of this threat to freedom? All three 
branches of the government have a re-
sponsibility to protect people’s rights, 
and if one branch doesn’t do its job— 
that is how this system was set up con-
stitutionally—then it is up to another 
to step in. 
Congress must act to codify the prin-
ciples of Roe v. Wade into law, and we

will have the opportunity to do just 
that on the floor today when we cast 
our votes on the Women’s Health Pro-
tection Act. These protections are des-
perately needed, and it is our responsi-
bility to take action so that this funda-
mental right remains real for the 
women and the men who stand with 
them across this country. 
Freedom and equality under the law, 
for the first time in generations—and I 
want young people out there to think 
about this—we may live in a world 
where women have fewer rights than 
their moms or their grandmas. That is 
not the world we want. 
I urge my colleagues to stand up with 
the majority of Americans who support 
a women’s right to make her own 
healthcare decision, the freedom to 
make her decision, by enshrining the 
protections of Roe v. Wade into law. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have 
never seen so much furor over a case 
that has not been decided, based on a 
leaked draft dated February of this 
year which does not reflect a final deci-
sion by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Unfortunately, this egregious leak of 
this draft opinion has created serious 
security threats for members of the Su-
preme Court and their families. Over 
the last few days, angry protesters 
have shown up at three of the Justices’ 
private family homes. Sadly, the ma-
jority leader of the Senate said he is 
OK with peaceful protest outside the 
Justices’ homes. 
I disagree, and so does his second in 
command. This morning, Senator DUR-
BIN
called this practice ‘‘reprehen-
sible.’’ 
The threats to Justices remain high 
because emotions are high, and the 
Chief Justice has asked Congress take 
action to protect the Justices and their 
families by simply providing the same 
sort of authorities that the Capitol Po-
lice have to provide protection to 
Members of Congress and our families. 
Last week, I introduced legislation 
that would do that. I asked my friend 
and 
frequent 
collaborator, 
Senator 
COONS, if he would be interested in co-
sponsoring the bill to make it bipar-
tisan. 
Initially, he raised concerns with one 
of the provisions, but we worked in 
good faith to address his concerns and 
introduced a new version of the bill 
that could gain broad bipartisan sup-
port. 
And, clearly, we were successful be-
cause our bill passed the Senate unani-
mously on Monday, and now it is time 
for our colleagues in the House to fol-
low suit. 
Yesterday, Congressman ISSA
and 
Congressman CORREA introduced this 
bipartisan bill in the House, and 
Speaker PELOSI should act quickly to 
bring this bill up for a vote as soon as 
possible. 
Unfortunately, some in the House 
disagree. They have chosen to ignore 
the bipartisan bill that received unani-
mous support in the Senate and have 
introduced a partisan version, which is 
guaranteed to slow down the protec-
tions needed by the Supreme Court 
Justices and their families. 
This partisan bill in the House ig-
nores the good-faith work that was 
being done here in the Senate to build 
consensus and expands this legislation 
to include divisive provisions, like po-
tentially extending police protection 
to the very person who leaked the draft 
opinion. 
Well, this stands no chance of becom-
ing law. 
At the end of the day, here is where 
we are: The Supreme Court Justices 
and their families are facing serious se-
curity threats, and the Senate unani-
mously passed a bill to provide them 
with the protection that they need and 
they deserve. I can’t think of any good 
reason why House Democrats would 
delay a vote on this bipartisan bill, or, 
worse, allow the safety of the Justices’ 
families to become a political football. 
WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. President, on another matter, 
later today, the Senate will vote on a 
radical abortion-on-demand bill, which 
our Democratic colleagues are trying 
to sell as a codification of Roe v. Wade. 
But the truth of the matter is, this 
bill sweeps aside all of the protections, 
for example, for conscience, for reli-
gious liberty, for opposing taxpayer 
funding of abortions, and partial birth 
abortions. It sweeps all that aside and 
essentially makes abortion available 
on demand from the time of conception 
until the time of delivery. 
Now, this isn’t the first time our 
friends across the aisle have tried to 
opportunistically capitalize on events 
to check items off of their liberal wish 
list. In fact, we have witnessed this 
strategy numerous times. 
When the pandemic first hit, the 
House Democratic whip referred to the 
crisis as a ‘‘tremendous opportunity to 
restructure things to fit [their] vi-
sion.’’ And to their credit, our Demo-
cratic 
colleagues 
certainly 
didn’t 
squander that opportunity. 
Last year, they crafted a nearly $2 
trillion spending bill that included 
most of the far left’s outbox, their big-
gest priorities, and they tried to brand 
it as necessary pandemic relief, which 
it was not. Backdoor funding for 
Planned Parenthood, a blank check for 
mismanaged 
union 
pension 
funds, 
money for climate justice—it was easy 
to see through this COVID relief facade 
because, in the end, less than 10 per-
cent of the money was directly related 
to the pandemic, and less than 1 per-
cent supported vaccination efforts. 
We saw the same play when it came 
to election law. States across the coun-
try established temporary measures 
during the pandemic to ensure that 
voters could cast a ballot during some 
of the most worrisome days of the pan-
demic. 
When those temporary procedures 
were rolled back to what they were be-
fore the pandemic, our colleagues tried 
to frame that as voter suppression. 
They resurrected a bill that would 
force a one-size-fits-all election for-
mula out of Washington, DC, on every 
State and community in the country 
and, in the process, hand Democrats a 
permanent governing majority. 
And Democrats tried to cast anyone 
who opposed their partisan bill as at-
tacking the sacred right to vote, which 
it was not. 
But here we are seeing the same play 
once again. Our colleagues are now try-
ing to seize on the political firestorm 
from a stolen Supreme Court draft 
opinion to push their radical abortion 
agenda. And no doubt about it, it is 
truly extreme. 
Just as they did with their pandemic 
spending spree and election takeover 
bill, Democrats have taken things to 
the very nth degree, and they are push-
ing for a bill that is far out of line with 
the views of most Americans over this 
divisive and emotional topic. 
Only 19 percent of Americans say 
that abortion should be available in all 
cases, with no exceptions—19 percent. 
That means 81 percent disagree. 
Even though the vast majority of 
Americans oppose unrestricted abor-
tion access, that is exactly what this 
bill would provide. This bill would 
allow for abortions at any stage of a 
pregnancy. 
All 
it 
takes 
is 
one 
healthcare provider who says having 
the baby would present a potential 
harm to the mother’s health, including 
her mental health. 
And I mentioned yesterday the case 
of Kermit Gosnell, who ultimately was 
serving life in prison for running an 
abortion factory involving late-term 
abortions and other illegal abortions 
performed in Pennsylvania. 
So where is the line here? Where is 
the line? 
Democrats see no line. They don’t 
credit an unborn child with its very hu-
manity or else they would see some 
sort of balancing against the mother’s 
right to physical autonomy and the 
child’s right to life guaranteed in our 
Declaration of Independence. 
Is 
anxiety 
about 
motherhood 
a 
strong enough diagnosis to allow a 
woman who is 39 weeks pregnant to 
abort her baby in a late-term abortion? 
Anxiety can be a serious struggle that 
many prospective mothers face. There 
is no question about that. That is why 
I have been advocating for better ac-
cess to mental healthcare services for 
all Americans, including expecting and 
new moms. 
But this legislation is written so 
broadly that in practice, it legalizes 
abortion for virtually any reason up 
until the time the baby is actually de-
livered. 
Now, the American people aren’t the 
only ones who oppose unlimited abor-
tion on demand. This bill doesn’t just 
codify Roe v. Wade; it goes far beyond 
the abortion policies among other 
countries, like those in Europe, for ex-
ample.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2431 
May 11, 2022 
In most European countries, abortion 
access is restricted after a certain 
point in the pregnancy—in Sweden, it 
is 18 weeks of pregnancy; in France, it 
is 14 weeks; in Germany, it is 12 weeks; 
in Portugal, 10 weeks. Each of these 
limits are more restrictive than the 
current law in a number of American 
States, including blue States like Mas-
sachusetts and Nevada, where abor-
tions are restricted after 24 weeks. In 
California, Washington, and Illinois, 
abortions are restricted after viability, 
an arbitrary line, roughly, 20 weeks of 
gestation—20 to 23 weeks of gestation. 
But under this extreme bill, one 
healthcare provider could stop an oth-
erwise constitutional State law pro-
tecting the life of this unborn child in 
its tracks. 
Even though most Americans oppose 
late-term abortions, our Democratic 
colleagues are running full speed ahead 
in order to permit it under this ex-
treme bill. They are so desperate to 
make abortion-on-demand the law of 
the land that this legislation has the 
support of all but a handful of Demo-
crats in Congress. 
As the Republican Senate leader 
pointed out earlier this week, 97 per-
cent of Washington Democrats are 
pushing for policies that only 19 per-
cent of Americans support. This is 
proof, once again, that today’s Demo-
cratic Party is simply not listening to 
the American people; it is taking its 
marching orders from the most rad-
ical—most radical—and extreme mem-
bers of their own political party. 
Our colleagues are trying to frame 
this legislation as codifying Roe v. 
Wade, a 1973 opinion 50 years ago. But 
in reality, this radical bill goes much, 
much further. It doesn’t just maintain 
the status quo; it moves abortion poli-
cies in the direction of those in the 
People’s Republic of China and North 
Korea and away from those of our 
friends and allies in Europe. 
I would think that is not company we 
would feel comfortable keeping, with 
the People’s Republic of China, run by 
the Chinese Communist Party, and 
North Korea, the home of Kim Jong 
Un. 
In addition to allowing abortions up 
to the time of delivery, this bill allows 
abortions to be used as a method of sex 
selection, a shameful practice that be-
came common in China under its one- 
child policy. 
A number of States have laws on the 
book that prevent someone from hav-
ing an abortion based on the baby’s 
sex. In other words, the parent who is 
hoping for a son cannot just have an 
abortion because the baby is a girl. But 
this bill would change that. It would 
invalidate State laws that prevent sex- 
selective abortions. 
This bill would make further changes 
that endanger the very women who are 
receiving abortions. For example, it 
rolls back a commonsense provision in-
cluding requirements that only a li-
censed physician can perform or pre-
scribe an abortion. It removes guide-
lines for how abortion facilities are 
regulated and maintained, and it re-
moves commonsense safeguards like 
consent laws and waiting periods. 
Along with all of these radical and 
extreme 
changes, 
this 
legislation 
comes with no guarantees that tax-
payers won’t be asked to foot the bill 
for these elective procedures, and it 
provides no protection for babies who 
survive a botched abortion. 
It puts healthcare providers with re-
ligious or moral opposition to abortion 
in an impossible position. They have to 
disregard their sincerely held religious 
or moral briefs or they get sued. 
This isn’t the Woman’s Health Pro-
tection Act; it is the ‘‘Abortion on De-
mand Act,’’ without restrictions, with-
out limitations. 
It promotes abortion at a scale far 
beyond Roe v. Wade and far beyond 
what the vast majority of the Amer-
ican people are comfortable with. 
So this is not a serious effort to cod-
ify Roe, and it certainly isn’t an at-
tempt to reinstate policies that are in 
line with most Americans’ view on this 
very emotional and divisive issue. 
What this is, is pandering to the most 
radical elements in their party. 
The good news is that Democrats 
still don’t have the votes to pass this 
bill. Given the opposition of the vast 
majority of Americans, I doubt they 
ever will. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is a 
debate about the Women’s Health Pro-
tection 
Act—protecting 
women’s 
health, protecting half of America’s 
population in their right to seek the 
healthcare they require, protecting 
their ability, half of America, to make 
decisions about their own bodies. How 
is this a question even up for debate? 
Today, the Senate considers the 
Women’s Health Protection Act. A 
woman’s right to make choices about 
her own body is a constitutional right. 
It was affirmed by the Supreme Court 
nearly 50 years ago. Polling—as if that 
should be the benchmark by which we 
legislate—shows that nearly two out of 
three Americans believe the funda-
mental right established in 1973’s Roe 
v. Wade should be upheld. Yet here we 
are today—a body of 100, 76 percent of 
which 
are 
male—making 
decisions 
about the private lives of the nearly 168 
million women in this country. That is 
ludicrous. 
The right of any woman to receive 
the healthcare they choose and seek 
should be important to each and every 
one of us. Women—our mothers, daugh-
ters, sisters, aunts, friends—they know 
what is best for them in their own 
lives. How patronizing to suggest oth-
erwise. How patriarchal. How insult-
ing. How dangerous. 
I am the dean of the Senate; I am the 
longest serving Member of this body 
today. I have worked for decades to 
support legislation that affirms a wom-
an’s right to access comprehensive 
healthcare from a trusted provider 
without interference. The right to com-
prehensive family planning resources— 
whatever those resources may be—is 
not only a fundamental right to pri-
vacy for these women, but it is an im-
portant public health policy as well. 
In 2019, the Vermont House and Sen-
ate, by wide margins, approved the 
Freedom of Choice Act, which guaran-
tees the right to access safe abortion 
care in Vermont. Governor Scott—a 
Republican—signed that bill into law 
in June 2019. If the Court does overturn 
Roe, the Freedom of Choice Act would 
protect 
this 
healthcare 
right 
in 
Vermont, just as the Supreme Court 
case that was ahead of Roe v. Wade, 
Beecher v. Leahy, does the same. Once 
again, Vermont is a leader on an issue 
of national significance. 
The unfortunate reality is that 26 
other States stand ready to ban abor-
tion rights in the absence of Roe. What 
are the women of these States to do? 
And prominent Republican voices in 
the Senate even now say they would 
not rule out the possibility that a fu-
ture Senate and Congress would over-
rule such State laws in Vermont and 
elsewhere and impose a national ban on 
women’s choice. 
And what laws are these States pre-
pared to pass—what resources are they 
prepared to provide—to support these 
women and the children they will bear? 
The answer we know, and I fear, is 
none. States will determine what you 
do, but they won’t do anything to help 
you afterwards. 
The implications of the Supreme 
Court’s opinion, should a final decision 
mirror the leaked draft, go far beyond 
reproductive rights. For decades, the 
Supreme Court has stood as an inde-
pendent arbiter in this country. Strik-
ing down a constitutional right that 
has supported millions of Americans, 
not just women, will cause many to 
lose confidence in the integrity of our 
judicial system. Worse still, it could 
threaten the rights protected under the 
precedent set by Roe and affirmed in 
other cases. I acknowledge the fear 
that many are feeling right now about 
that possibility. Certainly, I hear it in 
my office. And that is why we need to 
pass the Women’s Health Protection 
Act. 
What would the suffragists say of us 
today? What would the icons of the 
civil rights movement say of us today? 
A vote against the Women’s Health 
Protection Act is a vote against equal-
ity. It is a vote against women, plain 
and simple. It is a vote against the 
progress we have made to right the 
wrongs of inequality. And it is at odds 
with what an overwhelming majority 
of the American public believes. It 
says, in many States in this country, 
women will be treated differently than 
men. 
You know, my sons and grandsons 
can travel anywhere in the United 
States knowing the law is the same for 
them. 
My 
daughter 
and 
grand-
daughters, under this, would know they

could not be treated the same as they 
travelled around the country. What 
does that say about America, that our 
sons and our grandsons will be treated 
differently than our daughters and our 
granddaughters? Our daughters and our 
granddaughters will be told by some 
States: You have less rights than your 
brothers or your fathers or your uncles. 
Shame on this Senate today. I stand 
with women—my wife, my daughter, 
my granddaughters—when I say that I 
trust them to make the health deci-
sions that are best for them. And I will 
fight against any effort to erode those 
fundamental, 
constitutional 
rights. 
That is what the Senate should do; 
that is what we should do if we truly 
are going to be the conscience of the 
Nation. That is what this Vermonter 
intends to do. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. 
ROSEN. 
Mr. 
President, 
last 
week, we learned that the United 
States Supreme Court is preparing to 
issue a ruling that would fundamen-
tally 
roll 
back 
the 
constitutional 
rights of millions of American women. 
It has been reported that a group of 
anti-choice Justices on the Supreme 
Court are planning to overturn Roe v. 
Wade, the landmark case decided near-
ly 50 years ago which recognized the re-
productive rights of women. 
This decision centered on one of the 
most fundamental rights we have as 
Americans—the right to control our 
own bodies. For nearly half a century 
Roe has protected a woman’s right to 
make 
extremely 
personal 
decisions 
about 
her 
own 
body, 
her 
own 
healthcare, her own family. But now— 
now we are seeing a clear, coordinated 
attempt by anti-choice politicians to 
roll back the clock on the rights of 
American women, control what hap-
pens to their bodies, and strike down 
reproductive freedom. 
If the Supreme Court moves forward 
with this action, it will have imme-
diate—immediate 
and 
devastating— 
consequences for women’s health. 
So let’s get something straight: over-
turning Roe isn’t going to stop abor-
tions. It is only going to stop women 
from 
getting 
safe 
abortions, 
and 
women will die as a result. This will 
also have a severe impact on how mis-
carriages and other life-threatening 
medical issues related to pregnancy are 
handled. 
For example, if Roe is overturned, ec-
topic pregnancies could become a death 
sentence for women in States that ban 
abortions. This is just one example of 
the harm this will cause. 
This will disproportionately impact 
women who lack the resources to go to 
other States to seek care, and this will 
also make it harder for women of color 
to access the care they need. 
Unfortunately, many States across 
our country already have rigid and ex-
treme restrictions on the books, and if 
Roe falls, many of those laws will go 
immediately into effect. In the States 
that don’t have those restrictions, ex-
treme legislatures are pushing new, 
dangerous, and restrictive anti-choice 
laws as we speak. 
In my home State of Nevada, abor-
tion rights have been enshrined as a 
State law since Nevadans overwhelm-
ingly voted for it in a ballot initiative 
in 1990. This means women across Ne-
vada will continue to have access to re-
productive care if Roe is overturned. 
But this year, anti-choice politicians 
are working to eliminate this protec-
tion from our State code and take 
away Nevadan women’s rights to make 
decisions about their own bodies. This 
is exactly why the Senate needs to pass 
the Women’s Health Protection Act 
today, to ensure that women in all 50 
States continue to have the right to 
make 
their 
own 
reproductive 
healthcare choices. 
I 
helped 
introduce 
the 
Women’s 
Health Protection Act last year be-
cause it is the best option we have to 
codify Roe v. Wade into law. This bill 
will codify the right to receive and pro-
vide reproductive healthcare, and it 
will prohibit States from enacting 
rigid, medically unnecessary restric-
tions that make it harder—make it 
harder—for women to access care. 
We are not living in a hypothetical 
anymore. We are staring a post-Roe 
world in the face and the time to act is 
now. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle have also made it clear that if 
they regain control of this Chamber, 
they will pass a national ban on abor-
tion rights and they may go even fur-
ther. 
I urge every Senator who cares about 
women, 
who 
cares 
about 
women’s 
health, who cares about women’s au-
tonomy and their rights—I urge them 
all to join me in voting to pass the 
Women’s Health Protection Act. Ne-
vadans are watching, the American 
people are watching, and women every-
where are depending on us. We cannot 
let them down. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
INFLATION 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor today to talk about infla-
tion and the impact it is having on 
American citizens across the board and 
particularly energy prices and how the 
energy policy of the Biden administra-
tion is a big part of the problem in 
terms of creating the inflation that we 
face. 
I once again urge the Biden adminis-
tration to reverse course on its harm-
ful energy agenda and instead take the 
handcuffs off our domestic energy pro-
ducers. 
Americans are struggling to afford to 
fill their tanks and to keep the lights 
on. Higher energy prices are fueling 
record inflation. We saw the latest sta-
tistic of 8.3 percent, which is driving up 
the costs of goods across the entire 
economy. 
Yesterday, gasoline prices hit an all-
time high of $4.37 a gallon nationwide, 
and gas is up to an average of $4.06 a 
gallon in my home State of North Da-
kota. Today, gas prices are even high-
er. That is about an 80-percent increase 
since President Biden was inaugurated, 
and that increase—the vast majority of 
that increase came before Russia in-
vaded Ukraine. 
Two years ago, our country was pro-
ducing almost 13 million barrels per 
day of oil. Today, our country is pro-
ducing about 11.3 million barrels a 
day—again, a direct result of the Biden 
administration’s energy policies mak-
ing it more difficult to produce energy 
in America. 
President Biden’s Green New Deal 
policies and hostile approach to Amer-
ican oil and gas have curtailed produc-
tion, and Americans are paying for it 
every day. It began with the adminis-
tration’s moratorium on new energy 
leases—closing off access to our abun-
dant, taxpayer-owned energy reserves. 
The administration continues to hold 
up our ability to move more oil and gas 
across the country by blocking pipe-
lines like the Keystone XL Pipeline. In 
2015, the Senate and the House passed 
my bill, S. 1, to approve the Keystone 
XL Pipeline. If the Obama-Biden ad-
ministration had not vetoed that bill, 
this pipeline would have been bringing 
in more than 800,000 barrels of oil a day 
from our closest friend and ally, Can-
ada. 
We have stranded natural gas re-
sources in North Dakota and in other 
parts of the country, like West Vir-
ginia and Pennsylvania, because we 
can’t get the permits to build the gath-
ering systems and the pipelines to get 
it to market, let alone to our allies. We 
need LNG facilities to help our allies in 
Western Europe and to help Ukraine as 
they 
continue 
their 
valiant 
fight 
against Russian aggression. 
If we really want to cut off the Rus-
sian war machine, we need to cut off 
their ability to sell energy, and that 
means once again embracing our Na-
tion’s most critical economic and na-
tional security assets—our country’s 
vast oil and gas reserves. A good start 
would be to pass my American Energy 
Independence from Russia Act, which 
is bicameral legislation that I intro-
duced with nine of my colleagues in the 
Senate. Our commonsense approach 
takes immediate action in encouraging 
U.S. energy production, including in-
creasing access to taxpayer-owned en-
ergy reserves on Federal lands, author-
izing the construction and operation of 
the Keystone XL Pipeline, and remov-
ing regulatory hurdles to increase liq-
uefied natural gas exports. 
North Dakota and other energy-pro-
ducing States can and should be em-
powered to unleash the full potential of 
our abundant oil and gas and coal re-
serves as well—all of these resources.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2433 
May 11, 2022 
No one does it with better environ-
mental stewardship than we do here in 
America, and we need to produce that 
energy here in America. 
It is long past time for the Biden ad-
ministration to get out of the way and 
take the handcuffs off American energy 
production. Producing more energy 
here at home is the solution to helping 
lower energy costs and providing hard- 
working families with relief from ris-
ing inflation. 
I saw that either the President or one 
of his spokesmen talked about the 
large amount of energy costs and infla-
tion. Well, we have a solution for that. 
Why isn’t the administration taking 
steps so that we can produce more en-
ergy here at home? That is what needs 
to happen, and that will benefit every 
single consumer across this great Na-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Senator from Nebraska. 
WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, abortion 
is a heavy issue. We are used to, in this 
body, debating marginal tax rates and 
debating spending bills, but this issue 
is different. This debate cuts to the 
heart of who we are, what we owe each 
other, what kind of society we want to 
preserve, and what kind of society we 
want to build. The moral weight of this 
debate is heavy. 
Social media, of course, makes it 
worse; makes it ugly; makes it stupid. 
There is too little grace. There is not 
enough compassion. Honesty and gen-
uine good-faith disagreements are real-
ly hard to come by. To talk about abor-
tion well, we need to actually listen to 
each other, and we need to try to un-
derstand the best arguments of the 
other side’s and take those arguments 
seriously. 
For Democrats, debating well has to 
start with recognizing that most Amer-
icans believe that unborn lives deserve 
to be protected at some point during a 
pregnancy. It is deeply human and 
deeply compassionate to recognize the 
humanity of an unborn life. Scientific 
advances like ultrasounds give us a 
glimpse into the lives of the unborn, 
first in black and white and now in 3D, 
and it is going to be clearer and clearer 
over time what that little baby is. Any 
honest conversation about abortion 
must grapple with the fact that every 
abortion begins with two lives and de-
stroys one of them. It is deeply wrong 
to ask Americans to participate in an 
act that they know takes an innocent 
life. 
For Republicans to debate well, we 
need to be willing to be honest about 
the fact that, for some women, preg-
nancy can be frightening and painful. 
Many situations are not ideal situa-
tions. Pregnancy changes a woman’s 
life in a way that is absolutely unique 
in the human experience. There is no 
equivalent to pregnancy. There is no 
example we can compare it to. That is 
why the pro-life cause is not and can-
not ever primarily be about legislation 
or about policy, as important as those 
can be. The pro-life cause must start 
with active compassion for moms and 
babies and especially women whose 
first thoughts upon learning that they 
were pregnant was: I can’t do this. 
To the pro-life movement, I want to 
recognize your patience and your per-
severance over decades. We should 
commend the ethic of love, persuasion, 
and prudence that has brought us to 
the place we are today. 
Pro-lifers show up for women and for 
babies every single day. I see it all over 
Nebraska, and I know that it is true 
across all 50 States. 
Pro-lifers 
and 
especially 
pro-life 
women support women through preg-
nancy care centers. They work in local 
communities to build support net-
works. 
They 
are 
persuading 
their 
neighbors and are growing a movement 
that supports life. 
We don’t have the massive war chest, 
the army of lawyers, or the fancy PR 
shops that Planned Parenthood does, 
but what we do have is truth and love. 
Thousands of pregnancy care centers 
provide women and their babies with 
free help—with lots of free help. The 
volunteers who show up every day to 
help these women obviously don’t do it 
for money; they do it out of love. 
Thousands of pro-life families adopt 
kids every year, and their hearts over-
flow with love as they welcome a new 
child into their families. That is the 
core meaning of the pro-life movement. 
It is not about legislation first or 
about legislation second or about legis-
lation third. 
Advocates 
for 
abortion-on-demand 
are doing a lot of fearmongering. We 
have heard some bizarre speeches on 
the floor in the last couple of days that 
are so disconnected from the reality of 
the text of the legislation that is be-
fore us. So much of what they are push-
ing is wildly out of touch with the pub-
lic and wildly out of touch with mod-
ern science. 
We already know that America’s 
abortion laws are far, far more permis-
sive than Europe’s and that, on this 
subject, our laws have a lot more in 
common with the human rights abus-
ers China and North Korea than with 
anything in French law. The legisla-
tion before us today would make our 
laws even more extreme. Depending on 
how you count, we have the fourth to 
seventh most extreme pro-abortion 
laws of any of the 200 nations on Earth, 
and the legislation before the Senate 
today would make the U.S. position 
even more extreme. 
There was a time when the Demo-
cratic Party talked about abortion as 
being safe, legal, and rare—safe, legal, 
and rare. Not anymore. This legislation 
is not from your mom’s Democratic 
Party. 
In recent years, we have taken votes 
on 
my 
legislation, 
the 
Born-Alive 
Abortion Survivors Protection Act. It 
is a pretty simple, straightforward bill 
that aims to protect babies who sur-
vive botched abortions. There are no 
restrictions on abortion access in my 
bill, just a simple requirement that, if 
a baby is born alive in an abortion clin-
ic, she must receive the same level of 
care she would have received had she 
been born in a hospital. That is it. Yet 
Senator SCHUMER
and the abortion 
lobby have filibustered this legislation 
over and over. It is so weird. 
So here we are today. The abortion 
industry’s lobbyists have bullied Lead-
er SCHUMER and all but one courageous 
Democratic Senator, my friend JOE 
MANCHIN, into an extreme position that 
doesn’t reflect even the majority opin-
ion of the Democratic Party today, let 
alone the position of Americans. 
This bill today is ugly, winner-takes- 
all politics. It is full of aggressive pro- 
abortion provisions. Let’s consider just 
a few. 
One, it would formally create a na-
tional right to abortion up until the 
moment of birth in all 50 States, and it 
would undo even State-based partial- 
birth abortion bans. 
Two, today’s legislation would pro-
hibit States from requiring parental 
consent to perform abortions on a 
child. 
Three, it would prohibit States from 
passing any laws to ban sex-selective 
abortions. It would ban any laws that 
States would have to try to prevent 
sex-selective abortions. 
It would create a right for nondoc-
tors to perform abortions, putting 
women at severe risk of complications 
and botched procedures. 
It would remove conscience protec-
tions that keep Americans from being 
forced to perform or fund abortions if 
they have moral objections. Think 
about that. It would force Catholic hos-
pitals to perform abortions. That is 
new. That is gross. 
Where is the tolerance? Where is the 
compassion? Where is the humanity? 
Where is the attempt to understand 
that the majority of Americans want 
there to be prohibitions on abortions at 
some point in the pregnancy? 
Americans don’t want the kind of 
radicalism we see in this bill before us 
today. In recent polling, 65 percent of 
Americans say they support banning 
abortion in the second trimester, and 
80 percent of Americans support ban-
ning abortion in the third trimester. 
Why? Well, one of the reasons is be-
cause they have seen a lot of images of 
what a baby looks like in utero in the 
second and third trimester. 
Just to reiterate, contrary to the 
last, I guess, couple of speeches ago, 
the last speech on this topic on the 
floor, 80 percent of Americans want to 
see abortion banned in the third tri-
mester. It is hard to get 80 percent of 
Americans to agree on anything, and 
yet 80 percent agree that third-tri-
mester abortions—the kind of thing 
that this bill wants to make sure is ex-
plicitly championed—States could not 
prevent and prohibit third-trimester 
abortions. That is what this bill is 
about.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2434 
May 11, 2022 
This bill is incredibly extreme. There 
is no moderation in this bill, just bru-
tal indifference hiding behind euphe-
misms. Fortunately, it won’t pass. Un-
fortunately, our debate about it isn’t 
very honest here. Fortunately, the pro- 
abortion lobby isn’t winning. Majority 
Leader SCHUMER will earn kudos from 
Planned Parenthood for this show vote 
today, but he is not going to convince 
anyone. 
As we look beyond today’s gross 
vote, as we look to the future, our 
focus should be on continuing to grow 
the pro-life coalition in this country. 
We can and we must build support 
across the country for an ethic that 
protects life. 
I want to lock arms with pro-life 
Democrats and work to build a culture 
of life. If we can pair certain pro-life 
laws with increased spending on pre-
natal care and safety nets for strug-
gling moms, count me in. I am for that 
kind of big, new coalition. Let’s do it. 
This movement is about hearts and 
minds. We have got to have difficult 
conversations and love, and we have 
got to reject the kind of extremism 
that Senator SCHUMER is putting on 
the floor today pursuing this bill. We 
have got to focus our work on our local 
communities, on changing our neigh-
bors’ minds, on understanding each 
other, and on setting an example by 
putting moms and babies first. 
The answer, after this bill fails 
today, is to remember that love is 
stronger than power, and that is why 
life is going to win. Being pro-life 
means being pro-science, pro-mom, and 
pro-baby. It means starting with love, 
not with legislation. Happily, it defi-
nitely doesn’t mean starting with the 
grotesque legislation that will be voted 
down this afternoon. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
last week, a draft opinion was leaked 
out of the Supreme Court, which never 
happens. It literally has not ever hap-
pened until now. The Chief Justice of 
the Supreme Court called it a betrayal 
of the Court. 
That leak sparked protests all over 
the Nation and in Washington, DC, but 
not because two centuries of protocol 
in the Supreme Court was violated; it 
was because the Court dared to say 
that when the Supreme Court ruled in 
1973 on Roe v. Wade, it made a mistake. 
In the draft opinion that was released, 
it stated that the opinion of 1973 ex-
ceeded the constitutional boundaries. 
For 200 years, legislatures deter-
mined when life began, but in 1973 the 
Court determined that States cannot 
protect its youngest citizens of their 
State and created a new standard 
called viability, a standard that had no 
statement in the Constitution and no 
statement in Federal law. They lit-
erally created the viability standard on 
the spot. 
The draft opinion from February of 
this year states that that should not 
have been done in 1973 and that the 
people in each State, in the legisla-
tures, should determine when life be-
gins and that they should have that de-
cision based in law. 
Apparently this body, including the 
Democratic majority, agrees at least 
with the basic finding of the Court’s 
draft decision because the Court says 
these issues should be settled in legis-
lative branches, not in the Court. And 
so today, a week after that draft opin-
ion is out, Senator SCHUMER has called 
up a bill to actually vote on Roe v. 
Wade—and not just vote on Roe v. 
Wade, vote on a very simple decision: 
When does life begin? 
The real question that comes up is, 
‘‘When is that child a child,’’ because 
in the most simple of questions, for 
those two little ones whom I know, 
only a short time before would have 
been in the womb. So the simple ques-
tion that this body is dealing with 
today is pretty straightforward: Who 
gets to decide whether she lives or 
dies? Who gets to pick that? 
I think she should live, and for that 
simple statement that I believe she 
should have a chance at life, I have 
been called a totalitarian, radical ex-
tremist because I believe her life is val-
uable. What kind of upside-down world 
do we live in, when people who believe 
children are valuable are the extrem-
ists, are the radicals, are the totali-
tarians? 
The day before Mother’s Day, the 
headquarters for Concerned Women for 
America, a pro-life organization that 
speaks up for the millions of women 
who believe children are valuable, was 
attacked and vandalized. On Mother’s 
Day—Mother’s Day—just let that soak 
in for a minute. On Mother’s Day, 
someone tried to burn down a preg-
nancy resource center in Wisconsin 
that 
provides 
baby 
formula, 
baby 
clothing, and diapers to new moms and 
provides 
ultrasounds 
to 
expectant 
moms. That facility they attempted to 
burn down, and then they spray-paint-
ed on the wall outside the building: ‘‘If 
abortions aren’t safe then you aren’t 
either.’’ 
Instead of that being condemned by 
the media, a journalist from Rewire 
saw the news story on the attack in 
Wisconsin and immediately tweeted 
out: 
More of this. May these people never know 
a moment of peace or safety until they rot in 
the ground. 
Also, on Mother’s Day, protesters 
showed up at Catholic churches around 
the country to protest the Catholic 
Church’s stand for this little girl and 
for life. Protesters also showed up over 
and over in the last week at the Jus-
tices’ homes to chant on bullhorns and 
to threaten the Justices because they 
dare to follow the Constitution. 
A CNN commentator tweeted out: 
Concrete barriers being put up around the 
Supreme Court. Now we just need to lock 
them in there and keep them away from us— 
and cut off their internet access so they 
can’t send us more opinions based on pro- 
rape judicial theory from the 1600s. 
I have heard it all week—all week 
long on this floor, tweeted out by jour-
nalists, tweeted out by activists—sim-
ple statements like this: equity, pri-
vacy 
rights, 
bodily 
autonomy, 
healthcare 
decisions, 
freedom 
to 
choose, reproductive rights, basic civil 
rights. 
All those are euphemisms for she 
dies. Why are people so passionate 
about this? Because it is not just a per-
son in this conversation; she is in this 
conversation. Her future, her opportu-
nities—that is what this conversation 
is about. And, for that, I am being 
called a radical extremist because I be-
lieve she is valuable. 
Last weekend, when I was at home, I 
ran into someone just out and about 
who wanted to talk to me about this 
issue, about life, who was very pas-
sionate about the freedom to be able to 
take her life just hours before she is 
born. And in that conversation, as we 
got back and forth on it, I asked him 
very simply: You know it is Federal 
law right now that we protect turtle 
eggs. Turtles—if you destroy a turtle 
egg, it is a Federal offense with a very 
big fine. If you destroy an eagle egg, it 
is a very big offense with a Federal 
fine. Do you find that odd? 
I am just in dialogue with this per-
son: Do you find that odd that in Fed-
eral law we protect an eagle egg, ac-
knowledging that is an eagle inside 
that egg, and we protect a turtle egg, 
saying we acknowledge that is a turtle 
inside that egg, but we allow the de-
struction of children? 
And, to my shock, they responded: 
Well, turtles and eagles are endangered 
so they should be protected. 
And I am called the extremist be-
cause I happen to believe she is pre-
cious and, just because there are bil-
lions of other humans around, I don’t 
think she is disposable. 
What are we really talking about? We 
are talking about the right for people 
to be able to speak out to their elected 
officials, in every State, and for each 
State legislature to decide on the issue 
of life. That is what we are talking 
about. 
If the draft opinion ends up being the 
final opinion from the Court, it doesn’t 
end abortion in America; it pushes it 
back out to every State and every leg-
islative branch, including this one, to 
be able to have a State-by-State and a 
national dialogue on this simple ques-
tion: When does life begin? 
Some people will say at conception, 
as I do, and, quite frankly, as science 
also agrees with. That is cell division. 
That is unique DNA. All the makeups 
of her life and of my life and every 
other person in this room’s life were 
there at cell division and conception in 
the earliest days. 
Every single cell in the woman’s 
body is exactly the same, has the same 
DNA in it, except for those cells. Those 
cells are different. They have different 
DNA in them. Why is there different 
DNA in those particular cells than

every other cell in the mom’s body? Be-
cause that is a different body that is 
there. That is why. 
Some people believe that life begins 
at conception. Some people believe at 
heartbeat. Some people believe at 15 
weeks, as the Mississippi law is chal-
lenging. Some people believe at viabil-
ity, others at birth. 
Why don’t we have that conversa-
tion? Why don’t we have that dialogue? 
Because, quite frankly, as I think 
about life and I look at this baby and 
I look at this baby—for some reason, 
there are a whole bunch of people who 
say that baby is alive and that baby is 
tissue and not alive. Some people 
would look at this baby and this baby 
and would say: totally different, com-
pletely different; this baby is alive and 
needs to be protected, and that baby is 
just tissue—which is so strange to me 
because that baby and that baby look a 
lot alike to me. 
I can count fingers on both. In fact, 
as funny as it is, they are both in the 
same position, which, by the way, for 
my wife and I, we call this the touch-
down position, how babies sleep with 
their hands up over their heads. And 
lots of babies do that, including mine 
did. This baby is in the touchdown po-
sition and sleeping, and this one is too. 
What is the difference between these 
two? I don’t see this as alive and tis-
sue. That looks a lot like a baby to me. 
And, for that, I am called the extremist 
and the radical. 
This baby sucks their thumb in the 
womb, responds to their mom’s voice, 
feels pain, has unique fingerprints, has 
unique DNA, kicks around like crazy. 
What is the difference between those 
two? Time. That is it. That is the only 
difference. Just time. 
So what has been brought to the floor 
today? What has been brought to the 
floor today is this bill—this bill—the 
Women’s Health Protection Act of 2022. 
Interestingly enough, that is the last 
time this bill uses the word ‘‘woman.’’ 
It doesn’t use the word ‘‘woman’’ any-
time after the title. It stops after that. 
I find that interesting. 
Let me talk you through a couple of 
things that are in this bill. Section 2 of 
the bill defines ‘‘abortion services’’ and 
details it out but also has a nice little 
note that is tucked into the definition 
here. It defines ‘‘viability’’ and says: 
The term ‘‘viability’’ means the point in a 
pregnancy at which, in the good-faith med-
ical judgment of the treating health care 
provider, based on the particular facts of the 
case before the health care provider, there is 
a reasonable likelihood of sustained fetal 
survival outside the uterus with or without 
artificial support. 
Interestingly enough, it just basi-
cally says the doctor that is there that 
is providing the abortion can deter-
mine when the child is viable or not 
viable. 
We all get the joke on this. We know 
what this really means. This bill is not 
about viability; this bill is about what-
ever age, at whatever time anyone 
wants to perform an abortion—at any 
moment. 
In my State, we are a State that has 
medical marijuana laws. They say it is 
not recreational marijuana; it is med-
ical marijuana. You have to have a 
medical prescription from a doctor to 
be able to get it. Do you know how you 
get it? The medical marijuana place 
actually has a doctor that you can just 
call that will write a script for you 
that will write it for no matter what. 
You can say: My left toe hurts every 
other Thursday. And they would say: 
Great, that is a medical condition, and 
you get a medical prescription for it. 
We get the joke. If the person actu-
ally selling the product is the one actu-
ally prescribing it, that means you can 
do it at any point. This bill, itself, pro-
tects that individual, saying they can 
define viability and they are protected 
in their definition of it. 
This bill is not about protecting chil-
dren prior to viability. This bill is 
about aborting at every single stage of 
pregnancy, all the way up to the end, 
no matter how late that abortion is. 
The bill doesn’t just stop there. Not 
only is there no limit for restriction on 
abortion, it gives a statutory right to 
abortion. Even though 71 percent of 
Americans believe there should be 
some limits to abortion, this bill says 
no, there can’t be. 
Then it reaches into every State and 
abolishes any restrictions that may be 
on abortion at all in any State. For in-
stance, if a State says there has to be 
more information given to a woman, 
like an ultrasound or just information 
about this child, it abolishes that, so a 
State cannot inform the mom before 
the abortion. That is prohibited. 
It also abolishes any other restric-
tion on telemedicine. It abolishes any 
requirement any State has on safety or 
health. It used to be—I heard the term 
from the pro-abortion crowd—‘‘safe, 
legal, and rare.’’ This strips away the 
‘‘safe’’ term on it and says every re-
striction that is out there on safety has 
to be stripped away; no State can put a 
restriction out there on this. 
It takes away any right of any State 
to actually restrict abortions being 
carried out on minors without parental 
consent. It strips away any kind of 
waiting period laws. 
It also strips away religious exemp-
tions. What does that mean? If a doctor 
or physician says: I don’t want to carry 
out an abortion; I believe that is really 
a child right there, not just a lump of 
tissue, then that doctor says for their 
conscience sake—through this bill: I 
am sorry, your conscience doesn’t mat-
ter any more. It strips away all con-
science protections. 
What is interesting is the Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act was passed in 
1993. It has never ever been accepted 
until this bill. This bill, literally, 
reaches into the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act and says: Your reli-
gious conscience doesn’t matter. It is 
an abortion. Get over it. That is what 
this bill says. 
This is not some simple codifying 
Roe bill. This is telling the Nation: I 
am sorry, you may think that little 
girl is a little girl and is valuable; we 
think she is disposable. No. 
Listen, pro-life Members here, like 
myself, have fought to make adoption 
more affordable, expand the child tax 
credit for the unborn, continue to pro-
vide assistance, food, healthcare to 
needy families, maternal health. We 
should all be working to support 
women in very difficult days, but she 
matters in this conversation. We can’t 
lose track of that. 
Mother Teresa once made the com-
ment: 
[I]f we accept that a mother can kill even 
her own child, how can we tell other people 
not to kill one another? 
You may say, well, that is Mother 
Teresa’s opinion that that child is a 
child. I would also tell you, it is Joe 
Biden’s, as well. Joe Biden also made 
the statement just last week. The 
Dobbs’ decision is about the ability to 
abort a child—to abort a child was 
President Biden’s statement. I agree. 
The conversation right now on the 
floor is what is her future? What hap-
pens next will decide a lot. I can assure 
you, I am going to speak about the 
rights for every single child and will 
declare, again, any child is valuable. If 
people call me a radical for believing 
children are valuable, so be it, but I 
think it tells us a lot about our culture 
that I am the radical one because I be-
lieve she has a hope and a future. 
I yield the floor. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, 
like many Americans, I was profoundly 
disappointed to learn from news re-
ports last week of the Supreme Court’s 
draft opinion that would overturn Roe 
v. Wade. Roe has been the law of the 
land for nearly 50 years. Generations of 
women have relied on its protections in 
shaping their lives. In fact, most Amer-
ican women have lived their entire 
lives knowing they have the right to 
make decisions about their own bodies. 
Now, the Supreme Court appears 
ready to take that right away with the 
stroke of a pen. If it does this, I believe 
that this Court would be ignoring 
precedent and gutting a half-century of 
progress for women. And in doing so, 
the 
Court 
would 
devalue 
women’s 
health and women’s lives. 
Make no mistake: If this draft opin-
ion becomes final, the consequences 
would be serious and would affect 
women throughout our country. The 
impacts could be devastating. Accord-
ing to an analysis by the New York 
Times, approximately half of U.S. 
States are poised to ban or severely re-
strict access to abortion if this opinion 
becomes final. 
Some States, including Texas and 
Oklahoma, have already passed laws 
banning abortion after the sixth week 
of pregnancy. That is before many 
women even know they are pregnant. 
Those laws are unconstitutional today 
under Roe, but could be put into effect 
immediately if the Court strikes Roe 
down. Other States may go even fur-
ther, either by banning abortion after

the moment of conception or by mak-
ing abortion a homicide, as a Louisiana 
bill would do. 
And several across the country have 
bans in place that lack any exceptions, 
including for rape or incest. These 
would take effect immediately if Roe 
were overturned. If these draconian 
State laws go into effect, women would 
lose the ability to make a decision 
about a pregnancy after experiencing a 
traumatic sexual assault; women could 
be forced to endure a pregnancy, even 
if that pregnancy could possibly kill 
them; and women could lose access to 
important fertility treatments like in 
vitro fertilization, a medical advance-
ment that many people rely on to build 
their families. 
These State laws could also add to 
the already monumental pain associ-
ated with miscarriage by dangling the 
threat of criminal charges over the 
head of any woman who loses a child 
during pregnancy. 
The majority of Americans alive 
today do not remember a time before 
Roe became the law of the land. They 
don’t know what it was like before the 
United States recognized this impor-
tant right. I remember the days when 
abortion was illegal. I remember pass-
ing a hat in college to collect money so 
a classmate could go to Mexico for an 
abortion. 
Women who could not afford to trav-
el were forced into even more dan-
gerous alternatives at home. They were 
often forced to self-induce, sometimes 
with a fatal result. It is these women, 
many who cannot afford to travel to 
another State for an abortion, who will 
be harmed the most by the Supreme 
Court’s decision if it becomes final. 
If this draft opinion should become 
final, around half of all American 
women would find themselves living in 
States that make access to safe abor-
tion care difficult or impossible. And 
the harm from this decision will fall 
disproportionately on low-income, at- 
risk, and minority women. Forty-nine 
percent of women who have had an 
abortion live below the poverty line. 
And these women would be forced to 
travel long distances at great cost in 
order to secure an abortion. 
For example, women who live in Mis-
sissippi now have to travel an average 
of 67 miles, one way, to receive an 
abortion. If the Court were to strike 
down Roe and abortion clinics were 
forced to shutter, women would have to 
drive on average nearly 500 miles, one 
way, to reach an out-of-state abortion 
clinic. That much travel would be im-
possible for many women, particularly 
those who already have young children 
at home, those who cannot afford the 
cost of the flight or gas money, or 
those who cannot take time off from 
work. 
Furthermore, studies have shown 
that there is a direct link between lack 
of abortion access and maternal mor-
tality. An analysis by the Center for 
American Progress shows that between 
2010 and 2015, when several States en-
acted new laws restricting abortion ac-
cess, the maternal mortality rate rose 
by 136 percent. 
Let’s be clear: Restricting a woman’s 
legal access to abortion healthcare will 
not stop women from seeking out that 
care. It will only make the process of 
seeking an abortion much less safe. 
Many women will be forced to endure 
unregulated and dangerous procedures, 
while others will attempt self-managed 
medication abortions at home. Lives 
will be lost. 
In conclusion, this potential decision 
by the Supreme Court would have dan-
gerous consequences for millions of 
Americans. We reduce the value of a 
woman’s life when we take away her 
ability to control her own body. 
Now, Congress must do everything it 
can to ensure that individuals are able 
to access critical medical care and 
make the best decisions possible for 
their health. It is more important than 
ever that Congress passes the Women’s 
Health Protection Act to safeguard 
Federal protections for women seeking 
abortion care. We cannot stand idly by 
and allow the lives of women every-
where to be endangered by this ill-con-
ceived effort to overturn our funda-
mental rights. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
come to the floor in support of codi-
fying Roe v. Wade through the Wom-
en’s Health Protection Act. 
As the Senate considers this vital 
piece of legislation today, I feel duty 
bound to impress upon my colleagues 
the grave implications should we fail 
to protect a women’s freedom to 
choose. 
After all, the right to choose is a fun-
damental right. It is the right to bodily 
autonomy—to decide when and how 
and with whom to start a family. 
It is a right that, when faced with 
one the hardest decisions of their lives, 
grants women in America the peace of 
mind of knowing the decision is be-
tween them, their doctor, and their 
faith—no one else. 
Last January marked 49 years since 
Roe v. Wade was decided—49 years 
since the fundamental right for women 
to make their own medical decisions 
became the law of the land. 
For nearly half a century, Roe v. 
Wade has been decided, affirmed, and 
reaffirmed as a legal bedrock of the 
constitutional right to privacy. 
Overturning it would take us back to 
a place no one wants to go. A dark 
place in history that would open the 
door to overturning settled decisions 
on critical issues. 
It 
would 
jeopardize 
fundamental 
rights like the right to gay marriage, 
to private consensual sex between 
adults, and even contraception. 
Voting 
rights, 
civils 
rights, 
and 
LGBTQI rights would all be on the 
chopping blocks. 
It is an existential threat, not just to 
women, but to EVERY American. 
I, for one, refuse to accept this 
version of our country. 
I refuse to go back to the days when 
women, 
particularly 
low-income 
women and women of color, were sub-
jected to government intrusion by 
male politicians who think they know 
best. 
One of these women is named Doro-
thy Carlos, an 81-year old constituent 
of mine in Englewood, NJ. After grad-
uating from high school, Ms. Carlos 
planned to go to nursing school and 
then maybe become a doctor. The year 
was 1958. After weeks without a check- 
up, she went in for an exam and found 
out she was pregnant. Ms. Carlos was 17 
years old at the time. In an instant, 
her dreams of going to nursing school 
were dashed. This was before Roe v. 
Wade and before the right to choose. 
The day Ms. Dorothy Carlos’ life 
completely changed was nearly 65 
years ago, but she still remembers it 
like it was yesterday. Not going to 
nursing school meant that she had to 
go on public assistance, relying on 
Medicaid and food stamps to provide 
for her family. Not having the freedom 
to choose stopped her career in its 
tracks—and when she called my office 
last week, her main concern was for 
the women who would be put in a simi-
lar position without the right to 
choose. 
So I say again, I refuse to go back to 
the days when women like Ms. Carlos 
had their dreams deferred because they 
didn’t have control over their own bod-
ies. I refuse to go back to the days 
when abortion was illegal and, there-
fore, unregulated—when thousands of 
women a year were hospitalized and 
even died as a result of unsafe proce-
dures—because, make no mistake, ban-
ning abortion does not stop abortions 
from happening; it just stops safe ones 
from being carried out. Despite what 
others refuse to accept, abortion is an 
integral part of maternal healthcare. 
Just ask Monica Attias, who bravely 
shared her story just a few days ago 
about how an abortion saved her life. 
Twenty-two years ago, Monica had 
complications during her second preg-
nancy that left her in a medically in-
duced coma. Her husband Philippe was 
told that she had a one in four chance 
of survival and to prepare for the 
worst. She thankfully survived, albeit 
with a heart condition that required 
medication. 
However, 9 months after a pregnancy 
nearly killed her, she became pregnant 
again. Neither her cardiologist nor her 
obstetrician could guarantee that she 
would survive another one. The best 
decision for Monica Attias was to have 
an abortion. 
As she puts it, ‘‘I loved the children 
I had too much to possibly allow them 
to grow up without a mother because 
she risked her life trying to have an-
other child.’’ 
Given what would happen if Roe v. 
Wade is struck down, Monica wonders 
if she would have been judged at-risk 
enough to qualify for a legal abortion. 
Thankfully, in New Jersey, the free-
dom to seek and obtain abortion care is 
protected under law. But in far too 
many States, 22 to be exact, over-
turning Roe would immediately roll

back the fundamental right to choose. 
Many of them would not have excep-
tions for rape, incest, or risks to the 
mother’s life like Monica Attias. Some 
of them would ban abortions after just 
6 weeks, before women like Dorothy 
Carlos realize they are pregnant. 
I refuse to go back to patchwork of 
laws. Rights are rights, and I refuse a 
version of our country where some 
women have fundamental rights while 
other women are left behind. I refuse to 
stand by and let our healthcare system 
be split further between the wealthy 
and the working poor. 
The freedom to make medical deci-
sions with your healthcare provider be-
longs to all Americans. Every Amer-
ican has the right to privacy, whether 
you live in Nebraska or New Jersey. We 
will not be silent as it is stripped away. 
It is why we will be voting on the ap-
propriately named Women’s Health 
Protection Act, to protect bodily au-
tonomy and prevent government bans. 
The Women’s Health Protection Act 
would end the undue restrictions on 
abortion by repealing the slew of harm-
ful State laws that have shut down 
healthcare clinics and providers all 
across the country in recent years. It 
would ensure that the protections 
granted by Roe today are the protec-
tions granted tomorrow. 
A strong majority of Americans— 
over 
70 
percent—have 
consistently 
agreed that the constitutional right to 
choose should be the law of the land. 
They support Roe v Wade, despite my 
Republican colleagues who are hell- 
bent on policing women’s bodies. 
These are the same colleagues who 
call themselves pro-life but refuse to 
fund maternal care, childcare, family 
leave, access to healthcare, education, 
and will never prioritize equal pay—the 
same Republican colleagues who would 
force women to give birth while oppos-
ing policies that benefit mothers, those 
who, after waging a decades-long war 
on the rights of 169 million women in 
our country, are now more focused on a 
leak than on the consequences of their 
misguided actions. 
Today, let us reaffirm that women 
deserve to have the full range of op-
tions available when it comes to some-
thing as personal as the decision to 
start a family. Let us unequivocally 
and unapologetically say that repro-
ductive rights are human rights and 
that an attack on the rights of women 
and girls is an attack on all of us. 
Let us pass the Women’s Health Pro-
tection Act and ensure that reproduc-
tive freedom is the law of the land 
across our country for this generation 
and for generations to come. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous 
consent that I be allowed to speak for 
up to 10 minutes, followed by Senator 
MURRAY up to 5 minutes prior to the 
scheduled rollcall votes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Senator LANKFORD 
just said this bill is all about legalizing 
abortion any time, any place in this 
country. He is right, but I am going to 
add that this legislation is being dis-
cussed for political purposes, and we 
are wasting time on this issue because 
we could be spending time on things 
that people want. 
I have been hearing the Democrats 
speak for a year and a half about the 
necessity of getting prescription drug 
prices down. Why couldn’t we be talk-
ing about that instead of wasting time 
on this legislation that is to make a 
political 
point 
instead 
of 
accom-
plishing something? 
I would like to speak, then, about the 
very extreme legislation being pushed 
by Democrats—the Women’s Health 
Protection Act. Democrats are using a 
leaked Supreme Court draft—not even 
a final decision—as an excuse to push a 
very radical legislation that goes be-
yond public opinion or even common 
sense on abortion. This bill goes much 
further than its stated position to cod-
ify Roe v. Wade decision. 
As ranking member of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee, I have raised many 
concerns about this legislation. The so- 
called Women’s Health Protection Act 
would invalidate hundreds of abortion- 
related laws in our various States, such 
as clinic regulations, admitting privi-
leges 
requirements, 
regulations 
on 
abortion-inducing drugs, reflection pe-
riods, conscience protections, sex selec-
tion bans, and limitations on the use of 
State funds and facilities for abortion 
training. 
Iowa and many other States have 
taken action on their own to enact 
commonsense 
restrictions. 
I 
don’t 
think this bill is common sense be-
cause it allows late-term abortions, 
which could be up even to the day of 
birth. Some States have protected indi-
viduals from having to perform abor-
tions against their own religious be-
liefs. 
We can’t stand by as those common-
sense laws are under attack by the 
Democrats. And this legislation at-
tacks those laws. The bill before us 
would invalidate these State laws and 
would allow abortion providers to set 
the standard of care for their patients 
with no oversight from the States. It 
would allow healthcare workers to de-
termine when a life is viable, which 
will lead then to inconsistent practices 
across the country and endanger the 
lives of mothers everywhere. 
If the bill before us were to be signed 
into law, the Federal Government 
would send a message to States that 
enacting laws to protect patients and 
regulate the health and welfare of their 
citizens is not the right of the Federal 
Government. 
It would allow Congress to intrude on 
States’ rights and nullify lifesaving 
laws on the books. It would invalidate 
the police powers of the State under 
the 10th amendment in regard to those 
police powers affecting the health of 
its citizens. In addition, this bill estab-
lishes no private right for women 
harmed by abortions. 
How can we, as Congress, stand up 
and say that we are protecting women 
when, really, this bill disregards any 
loss of life of babies, including full- 
term infants and even some mothers? 
Democrats claim this bill is a nec-
essary and moderate step. How can a 
sweeping 
piece 
of 
legislation 
that 
would overrule dozens of State laws 
and establishing terminating a preg-
nancy as the only option be classified 
as a moderate piece of legislation? No, 
this proposed legislation is an example 
of extreme extremism. 
It is unfortunate that the majority is 
using this issue to appear compas-
sionate and concerned about women’s 
rights when, in reality, the bill dis-
regards popular and commonsense laws 
that 
protect 
women 
and 
children 
across the country. Large majorities of 
Americans support strong abortion re-
strictions this bill would overturn. 
I understand and appreciate the ro-
bust debate around this subject. How-
ever, I am uncomfortable with the 
rhetoric of some of my colleagues. 
They refuse to discuss important prior-
ities of what the American people want 
and only want to push one extreme op-
tion. Let me be clear. Abortion should 
not be promoted as a default contra-
ception and family-planning tool. Let’s 
have a productive discussion on what 
can be done to support women and fam-
ilies. It is important to be open with 
our colleagues and peers on our dif-
ferences, but we must unite to protect 
life because every single life is pre-
cious. 
The Women’s Health Protection Act 
is an extreme piece of legislation that 
completely disregards human life. I in-
tend to vote against the motion to pro-
ceed. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that Senator 
SCHUMER be recognized following my 
remarks prior to the scheduled rollcall 
vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, 
last week, the country learned that the 
Supreme Court is preparing to over-
turn Roe v. Wade, and the constitu-
tional right to abortion, and make this 
the first generation of women in this 
country to have fewer rights than their 
mothers. Think about that for a sec-
ond. My daughter, my granddaughters 
will have fewer rights than I did. I 
truly never thought I would say that 
and it breaks my heart. 
These past few days have just been 
heart-wrenching. I have seen the emo-
tion and I have felt it. Let me tell you 
something. As heartbroken as people 
are, they are also mad and you can’t 
blame them. And I am mad, too, be-
cause we are watching the Supreme 
Court prepare to drag this country 
backward by half a century. 
Across the country, Republicans and 
State legislatures are banning abortion 
and they are making it crystal clear 
they are going to go even further. They

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2438 
May 11, 2022 
are coming after your mail because 
they want to make it illegal to send 
abortion medication in the mail. They 
are coming after your birth control. 
They are coming after Plan B and 
IUDs. 
And right here in the Senate, they 
are talking about a Federal abortion 
ban—a Federal abortion ban. That 
means a ban even in States like mine 
where the right to abortion is now pro-
tected. Senate Republicans want to 
make sure women from Seattle to New 
York 
cannot 
make 
their 
own 
healthcare decisions. 
For many Republicans, this is just 
the beginning. But to everyone who is 
scared, everyone who is furious, know 
this: They have some big roadblocks in 
their way. Me, Senate Democrats, 
House Democrats, and millions of pa-
tients across this country who are 
going to stand up and speak out. 
So I rise today to make sure women 
across the country have their voices 
heard. I rise to make sure Republicans 
have to show their true colors, to make 
sure every single one of them is forced 
to go on the record when it comes to 
the right to abortion, when it comes to 
the right of every patient to make 
their own decisions about their body, 
every mother to make their own deci-
sions about their family, every woman 
to make their own decisions about the 
future, because while Republicans have 
constantly been attacking the right to 
abortion—and they have been pushing 
that day in and day out for decades, by 
the way—they have been almost silent 
on what overturning Roe v. Wade will 
actually mean for people. 
Taking away a woman’s bodily au-
tonomy—which, let’s be clear, is ex-
actly what Republicans are talking 
about here—impacts her whole life. 
Forced pregnancy limits a woman’s en-
tire economic future. It takes away her 
ability to determine the direction of 
her own life. It forces women to be 
pregnant and give birth when they 
don’t want to, no matter their indi-
vidual circumstances. It hurts people 
in real and irreparable ways. 
I know, after so many decades of 
precedent, an end to the right so many 
women have lived with their entire life 
seems completely unthinkable, but this 
is real. This is happening. And Repub-
licans have been preparing for this for 
decades. 
We are about to see a tidal wave of 
abortion bans across the country, so 
this vote today will force Republicans 
to face up to the hurt and suffering 
they have caused and will cause, the 
lives that hang in the balance. 
We all know that if Roe falls, the 
heaviest burdens will land on those 
who already face the greatest chal-
lenges: mothers who are barely scrap-
ing by. It is Black women who already 
face a severe maternal mortality crisis. 
It is indigenous women, especially 
those on Tribal lands, who suffer from 
violence at unprecedented levels. It is 
women with disabilities, who may al-
ready face discrimination in routine 
medical care. It is women in rural com-
munities, who have less resources and 
are often already forced to drive miles 
to get the care they need. It is immi-
grant women, especially undocumented 
women. It is our gay and trans neigh-
bors, whom Republicans never seem to 
miss an opportunity to scapegoat or 
bully. 
People in my State need to know this 
will impact them, too, and many of my 
colleagues know I am not one to grand-
stand or exaggerate the scope of a cri-
sis that comes before the Senate. When 
I said this was a five-alarm fire, I 
meant it. We need to be clear-eyed that 
this will impact all of us. 
For 
one 
thing, 
we 
know 
the 
healthcare crises caused by abortion 
bans—and that is what they are: cri-
ses—will stretch across State lines. 
When Texas passed a law letting people 
sue strangers for getting or providing 
an abortion, desperate patients rushed 
to Oklahoma, only for that State to 
pass an extreme ban as well, meaning 
more patients traveling even farther, 
with fewer options to get the care they 
need. We are seeing this firsthand in 
my home State of Washington. After 
Idaho passed a draconian abortion ban 
of its own, my State had to brace for 
incoming patients surging into Wash-
ington. 
So there can be no question, if Roe is 
struck down nationally, if individual 
States across the country ban the right 
to abortion, people in every single 
State will live with the painful con-
sequences of that decision, and they 
will not forget that Republicans are 
the ones responsible for this. 
Let’s also remember that Repub-
licans have been clear, they have been 
explicit even, that they are not going 
to stop at Roe, they are not going to 
stop at the State level, and they are 
not going to stop at abortion. I can’t 
say this enough. Republicans are al-
ready talking about passing a Federal 
ban on abortion. Republicans are al-
ready talking about how Griswold, the 
case that struck down a ban on birth 
control, might have been ‘‘wrongly de-
cided.’’ Republicans are already talk-
ing about banning IUDs, Plan B. They 
even held a vote a few weeks ago to un-
dermine our Federal Family Planning 
Program and make it harder for people 
to get birth control. 
It is clearer than ever that because of 
Republicans’ extremism, not only is 
the right to abortion at risk but other 
important rights are as well. That is 
why people are so scared, and that is 
why they are so shocked. 
Someone back home said to me last 
week: What can I tell women in our 
State so they don’t worry? 
I said straight up: I am not telling 
anyone not to worry. I am scared, and 
I am frightened for women in this 
country more than I ever have been be-
fore. 
I am very fearful, but I am also de-
termined, and I know people across the 
country do not want to go backwards. 
They do not want politicians planning 
their families for them. They do not 
want politicians forcing people to stay 
pregnant. They do not want this to be 
the first generation of women with 
fewer rights than their mothers, which 
is why today we are now voting on the 
Women’s Health Protection Act. 
What this bill does is simple. It fol-
lows the Constitution and nearly half a 
century of precedent and gives the pa-
tient the right to get an abortion no 
matter where in America that patient 
or doctor lives. And the question every 
single Senator today is asked is simple 
as well: Do you trust women? Do you 
trust patients? Do you trust doctors? 
Do you believe every American should 
be able to make deeply personal deci-
sions about pregnancy and parenting 
according to their own beliefs, without 
government interference? 
If your answer is yes, then your vote 
on this bill should be as well. If your 
answer is no, if you think women 
should have fewer rights, if you think 
it is OK for Republican politicians to 
force someone else to stay pregnant or 
give birth when they don’t want to, 
you are going to have to go on the 
record and let your constituents know 
that you think your personal opinion 
matters more than their own medical 
decisions. And you better believe no 
one will forget this. 
I yield the floor. 
(Disturbance in the Galleries.) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate will be in order. The Senate will be 
in order. Thank you. 
Expressions of approval are not al-
lowed by the Gallery. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
may I first thank my dear friend and 
colleague from Washington for her 
powerful and heartfelt words and for 
her leadership as well. 
Now, the question before the Senate 
is simple. As women’s rights face their 
greatest threat in half a century, will 
this Chamber step into the breach and 
protect the basic right to choose? Will 
we enshrine into law what courts have 
held for decades—that decisions women 
make about their pregnancies belong 
to them and them alone—or will five 
unelected Justices, presiding without 
accountability in a courtroom across 
the street, take a fundamental right 
away from millions upon millions of 
women in this country? 
In a few minutes, it will be time for 
Members to vote. The legislation be-
fore this Chamber is straightforward. 
It would codify what Americans al-
ready believe: that the right to choose 
whether or not to have an abortion be-
longs to women, not elected politi-
cians. It will preserve the safeguard 
that conservative Justices seem ready 
to strike down in just a few weeks. 
If they follow through with their de-
cision, the United States, which has al-
ways aspired to the expansion of 
rights, will take a shameful and repres-
sive step backward. Our kids will grow 
up in a country with fewer rights than 
those who came before them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2439 
May 11, 2022 
This decision, if formalized, would be 
remembered as one of the worst and 
most damaging cases in the entire his-
tory of the Supreme Court. So this is 
not a theoretical exercise, oh, no. Pro-
tecting the right to choose at this crit-
ical moment is one of the most con-
sequential votes we could possibly 
take, and the American people are 
watching. The public will not forget 
which side of the vote Senators fall on 
today. They will not forget who voted 
to protect their freedoms. And they 
will not forget those responsible for the 
greatest backslide of individual lib-
erties in half a century. 
Across the country, the hard right is 
hell-bent on sending women’s rights 
back to the stone age, and we in the 
Senate must respond. We must respond 
to radicals who want to ban abortions 
as early as 6 weeks—before many 
women know they are pregnant. We 
must respond to extremists who want 
to prosecute and imprison women and 
doctors for carrying out an abortion, 
and even friends who merely provide 
rides to clinics could end up in jail. We 
must respond to the swell of hard-right 
ideologues who openly champion re-
strictions without exceptions for rape 
or incest. We must oppose the vision 
that MAGA Republicans clamor for— 
forced pregnancies, punishment for 
women and doctors, and zero excep-
tions for rape or incest. This is not 
what America wants. I hope it is not 
what Members of this Chamber want 
either. 
I implore everyone whose conscience 
has been jolted over the past week to 
vote in favor of today’s measure. In-
deed, I implore everyone who cares 
about the rights of not just women but 
of all Americans to support this meas-
ure because if five unelected Justices 
are allowed to decide the fates of mil-
lions of women, if the rights women 
have relied upon for 50 years wither 
away like ash, if we do not take a 
stand now to protect a woman’s right 
to choose, then, mark my words, it will 
be open season—open season—on our 
God-given freedoms in this great and 
grand country. Today, it will be Roe. 
Tomorrow, it will be a national ban on 
abortion and beyond that, something 
even more dreadful. 
We cannot allow this shameful back-
slide to happen. We cannot allow the 
whims of MAGA Republicans to bully 
the rest of the country into submis-
sion. 
I urge my colleagues, take a stand. I 
urge my colleagues and Americans to 
fight back. I urge Americans and ev-
eryone here to defend the right to 
choose. I urge my colleagues to vote 
yes. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that all postcloture

immediately vote on confirmation of 
Executive Calendar No. 809, the nomi-

WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, earlier 
today, the Senate took one of the most 
significant votes I have been a part of 
in my time in public service. While the 
Women’s Health Protection Act didn’t 
pass, this vote made it very clear 
where every Senator stands. The Re-
publicans unanimously voted to crim-
inalize abortion in more than half the 
States in America in just a few weeks. 
Democrats vowed to stop the Alito 
Court from turning the clock back on 
women’s health by a century. 
Let’s be very clear about the con-
sequences of this ruling when it be-
comes final. It will immediately crim-
inalize abortion in many States. It will 
allow Republicans to pass a law crim-
inalizing abortion in all 50 States. It 
will throw out the constitutional right 
to privacy—a right upon which mar-
riage and choice and many other civil 
rights depend. It will put government 
and governments in control of women’s 
bodies for millions and millions of peo-
ple across America. This is a terrifying 
prospect. 
It is no secret that people have been 
considering what would happen if and 
when this far-right Supreme Court 
would throw out Roe. Less than a 
month ago, I was on the floor talking 
about the end of Roe and the danger to 
Griswold v. Connecticut, the case that 
affirmed the right of married people to 
use contraception. However, it is still a 
shock—a gut punch—to see how eager 
our colleagues on the other side are to 
strip women of their constitutional 
freedoms and endanger their lives. 
They are going a lot further—a lot 
further—than simply overturning Roe. 
All the talk about States’ rights seems 
to have gone out the window. The goal 
is a Federal abortion ban, Federal 
criminalization. 
Already, Republicans, including Gov-
ernors and statehouse leaders, are talk-
ing about banning birth control. I will 
say that again. This year, 2022—not 50, 
75 years ago; 2022—they are talking 
about banning birth control. Already, 
there are plans to restrict people’s free-
dom 
of 
movement, 
criminalizing 
women who travel to other States for 
an abortion and even the person who 
gives them a ride. No sugarcoating can 
be done here. We are talking about en-
acting laws that reach beyond State 
borders, hearkening back to the dark-
est days of our history. 
This far-right Alito Court has al-
ready given far-right lawmakers a 
green light to do what it wishes to do 
when it comes to abortion. There is no 
reason to trust this Court to draw the 
line at restricting women’s freedom of 
movement. 
Another closely related issue that 
ought to frighten millions of women is 
the 
prospect 
that, 
with 
abortion 
criminalized, women’s personal data is 
going to be weaponized against them 
by bounty hunters and the government. 
I have been sounding the alarm for 
years about the abuse of location data 
taken from people’s cell phones. In a 
world where Sam Alito is in charge of 
abortion laws, that is one massive, 
massive crisis. Shady data brokers are 
already tracking women who go to 
Planned Parenthood clinics, and they 
will sell that data to anybody around 
who has a credit card. Imagine for a 
moment what not just prosecutors but 
these deranged far-right vigilantes can 
do with this data. The apps women use, 
the websites they visit, the places they 
go—all of it can be used against them 
by prosecutors. 
In short, this is uterus surveillance. 
That is what is coming down the pike 
unless Congress acts and gets serious 
about consumer privacy and prohib-
iting the government from making end 
runs around the Fourth Amendment. 
It is a shock to me how little concern 
there seems to be for some of these big 
issues. It is a full-out sprint toward 
massive government overreach and se-
vere restrictions on women’s freedom 
and privacy. 
There is zero thought—zero—given to 
victims of rape. There is zero thought— 
zero thought—given to victims of in-
cest. There is zero thought to women 
being exploited after being forced to 
seek 
back-room 
abortions, 
zero 
thought given to how many more 
women will die—die—as a result of this 
ruling. 
Complications 
during 
preg-
nancy could become a death sentence 
in States like Texas, where law en-
forcement has already shown the will-
ingness to arrest a woman for having a 
miscarriage. A woman’s tragedy of los-
ing a baby can be compounded by the 
very real threat of criminal prosecu-
tion. 
Through all of this, abortions will 
still happen; they will just happen in 
conditions that are much less safe than 
they are now. 
I know that there are Members on 
the other side who are always quoted 
as saying they care about these issues. 
They have been saying it for years. Yet 
now the Senate is at this moment. Not 
a single Republican Senator voted to 
protect the law as it stands today. 
The vast majority of people in Or-
egon and all across the country oppose 
what the Alito Court is inflicting on 
them by tossing out Roe. This is ex-
treme judicial radicalism, proof that 
these Justices were pretty much blow-
ing smoke when they told Senators 
they would respect precedent if they 
were confirmed. 
The bottom line now is this: If you 
don’t have control over your own body, 
you are not free. The Alito Court is de-
nying women control over their own

bodies. This is an attack on their free-
dom, a denial of Americans’ right to 
privacy. 
Criminalizing 
abortion 
is 
wrong, 
plain and simple. And you have to ask 
and certainly people from one end of 
the country to another tonight are 
going to ask, how can this be allowed 
to stand? 
Tonight is not the end of this battle. 
The Senate has taken one vote. Now 
Americans must cast their vote and 
make it clear whether they want to be 
part of MITCH
MCCONNELL’s new re-
ality. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
America’s inflation crisis. And it is a 
crisis. 
Today, Americans woke up to basi-
cally two gut punches: One, they found 
that gas prices are the highest they 
have ever been—ever—in the history of 
this country and, the second, that the 
inflation number is still incredibly 
high and actually higher than was an-
ticipated by the government’s so-called 
specialists. 
Well, last week, the senior Senator 
from Illinois came to this floor, and he 
said Republicans want the midterm 
elections to be about inflation and the 
border. I think the Senator intended 
his comments to be a criticism of Re-
publicans, but I would point out to the 
Senator from Illinois, that is exactly 
what the American people say this 
election ought to be about: inflation 
and the border. It is not Republicans 
who are making that the election issue 
for 2022. No, it is what the American 
people say they want to vote on. 
Frankly, it is also the Democrats be-
cause they created both of these crises. 
So this is going to be an up-or-down 
vote on how well the Democrats have 
done with the border and with our 
economy and the inflation that is 
crushing so many families at home all 
across the country. 
Nobody forced the Democrats to vote 
to cram a $2 trillion spending bill 
through Congress last March. Oh, no. 
Party-line vote—the Democrats in this 
body, NANCY PELOSI and the Democrats 
in the House, and Joe Biden only 2 
months into his Presidency. Democrats 
said: Oh, no, no. It is coronavirus. 
That is what they said it was for, but 
when you take a look at that bill, only 
$1 out of every $11 actually went for 
medical care. The rest went to a big 
Democrat wish list that includes gov-
ernment checks to illegal immigrants. 
These are criminals behind bars who 
received checks from the government 
in the name of coronavirus relief. No-
body forced the Democrats to open the 
southern border. So the crisis that we 
have of inflation and the crisis that we 
have on the border are both crises of 
choice by the Democrats. 
Now, here we are, 15 months into the 
Democrats’ administration. The No. 1 
issue in America today is inflation—40- 
year-high inflation numbers. Nine out 
of 
10 
Americans—Mr. 
President, 
I 
would just point out 9 out of 10 Ameri-
cans hardly ever agree on anything, 
but 9 out of 10 Americans are con-
cerned and upset about inflation. It is 
really not hard to see why. 
This week, just like last week, ter-
rible economic news for working fami-
lies: gas prices, again, at an alltime 
high. The price of a gallon of gasoline 
today is $2 higher for each and every 
gallon when people go to fill up than 
the day Joe Biden became President. 
This morning, a new alltime high. Yes-
terday an alltime high. Higher yet this 
morning for gasoline. Inflation, a 40- 
year high. 
The prices are going up much faster 
than wages. In fact, this gap between 
prices and wages continues to grow. 
People are falling further and further 
behind. The average family is poorer 
today than they were the day Joe 
Biden took office in terms of their abil-
ity to buy goods and services in our 
economy from the dollars they have in 
their pockets. This is even for people 
who have gotten raises. 
People can’t afford necessities like 
baby formula, if they can find baby for-
mula—a hard time finding that all 
across the country. It finally made the 
national news last night, but I have 
been hearing about it in Wyoming now 
for a number of weeks. 
Credit card debt is also near an all-
time high. Why? Because people in the 
Biden economy are having to borrow 
more and more money just to get by. 
And the interest rates on these credit 
cards are also at an alltime high. So 
people are being punished again and 
again and again in so many ways that 
they turn in the Biden economy. Peo-
ple are paying more and more and get-
ting less and less, and people are not 
happy. 
People have been pushed to the 
breaking point, and they are angry. 
And they are angry at the Democrats, 
who put us, as a Nation, into this mess. 
Americans haven’t been this pessi-
mistic about the economy since the 
great recession. When they look at 
Washington, DC, they see a Senate 
with CHUCK SCHUMER claiming to be in 
charge, a majority in the Senate; they 
look at NANCY PELOSI claiming to be in 
charge of the House and Joe Biden in 
the White House saying he is in charge 
there. 
Yet the President spoke yesterday 
and spoke today, and for the people in 
charge, he wants no responsibility for 
what is happening in this country with 
this economy. He said it yesterday. He 
said it again today. He was full of 
blame, full of excuses, full of not tell-
ing the truth to the American people. 
He blamed somebody else. 
It took him just 30 minutes in his 
speech. Joe Biden blamed—let me go 
through this whole list of the folks he 
blamed in just 30 minutes. He blamed 
coronavirus. He blamed Russia. He 
blamed meatpacking. He blamed ship-
ping. 
He 
blamed 
Republicans. 
He 
blamed oil companies. He blamed ev-
erybody but himself. 
At the same time, he actually admit-
ted in the speech that Democrats are in 
power. They don’t have power to do 
anything other than blame other peo-
ple. He admitted that Democrats con-
trol the White House and the House 
and the Senate. 
We do not have a Harry Truman mo-
ment here, who said, ‘‘The buck stops 
here.’’ Oh, no, no. Joe Biden keeps try-
ing to pass the buck. He has been fin-
ger-pointing at Republicans, and in 
doing so, he earned three Pinocchios 
from the Washington Post. Those are 
the people who look into this and say, 
Is the President really telling the 
truth? No, no, no. Three Pinocchios. 
Yet Joe Biden, after receiving that 
grade, the failing grade from the Wash-
ington Post, he repeated the same lie 
yesterday, finger-pointing again and 
again. He is telling people that he cut 
spending. He hasn’t. In fact, Joe Biden 
has been the most economically reck-
less President in the history of this 
country—reckless. 
The American people remember that 
Joe Biden took $2 trillion on the credit 
card with a bill that he had passed by 
the House and the Senate and signed in 
March. He was gleeful at the signing 
ceremony. He signed the single most 
expensive spending bill in the history 
of the country. 
Inflation started soon thereafter. The 
crisis mounted month after month 
after he had signed the bill. Oh, you re-
member when the President said: Oh, it 
is transitory. Forget about it. Don’t 
look over there. Go away quickly. 
Month after month after month, the 
President dismissed it, ignored it, de-
nied it. The American people remember 
that, just 6 months later, Joe Biden 
tried to pass another massive spending 
bill. Joe Biden has never cut a dime of 
spending in his life, but he has added 
trillions of dollars to our debt. 
What did he get us? The worst infla-
tion in 40 years and a stagnant econ-
omy. There are still a million fewer 
Americans working today than there 
were before the pandemic struck. 
Under Joe Biden, we have created a 
lot fewer jobs than the economists ex-
pected. The economists have gotten it 
wrong again and again. They got it 
wrong in terms of how many jobs they 
expected to be made, and they got it 
wrong today when they thought what 
the inflation rate would be. And, in 
both cases, their projections were more 
optimistic than the actual results 
turned out to be. 
Last year, we created fewer jobs in 
America than were projected without 
the spending bill, and he said the

spending bill was going to get us more 
jobs. 
Economists’ projections of our econ-
omy just keep going lower and lower 
and lower. Now the experts are pre-
dicting a recession. A recession is when 
the economy shrinks for 6 months. We 
are already halfway there. In the first 
3 months of this year, the economy did 
shrink. Why? Well, because of infla-
tion. 
As former Obama economic adviser 
Austan Goolsbee said on Friday, it is 
an awful situation. Oh, yes, it is. High 
inflation is going to lead to higher in-
terest rates, which will slow down our 
economy even more. 
Last 
week, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
issued the biggest hike in interest 
rates in 22 years. The Fed also indi-
cated that it is just the beginning; we 
are going to have more rate hikes com-
ing. This will slow down the economy 
even further. 
And on top of all this, this may be 
too little, too late by an administra-
tion that is very slow on the trigger. 
The damage of inflation has been done. 
The average American family today is 
paying $100 a week more just to buy 
the same things that they bought last 
year. That is $5,200 a year more this 
year than last year because of the way 
Joe Biden has mishandled and mis-
managed our American economy. 
Prices are going up. Interest rates 
are going up. The economy is slowing 
down. What is Joe Biden going to do? 
Regrettably, he is trying to double 
down. 
So to the senior Senator from Illi-
nois, the midterm elections, as he said, 
will be about inflation and will be 
about the crisis and the chaos at the 
southern border, whether the Senator 
likes it or not. 
The American people are suffering. 
They feel stuck. They feel stressed. 
They feel squeezed. They are begging 
and pleading with Democrats in Wash-
ington: Stop the reckless spending. Un-
leash American energy. We have plenty 
of it in the ground. Let us get it out 
and bring this Democrat inflation 
nightmare to an end. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JULIA RUTH GORDON 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak on the nomination of 
Julia Gordon to serve as HUD Assist-
ant Secretary and Commissioner of the 
Federal Housing Administration, or 
FHA. 
First, some context. Under President 
Biden, inflation has risen to an as-
tounding 40-year high, as we all know 
and as we are reminded every day by 
prices all around us. But inflation isn’t 
the only thing rising under President 
Biden’s watch; so is violent crime. 
Many cities across the country saw a 
rise in murders last year, continuing a 
surge in the national homicide rate to 
its highest level in over two decades. 
We are facing a crimewave, and how 
have our local Democratic leaders re-
sponded? Well, often, we have radical 
prosecutors who recommended lenient 
sentences for violent felons. Some are 
even declining to prosecute whole cat-
egories of offenses. Some States have 
adopted so-called bail reform that is 
designed to keep offenders from jail en-
tirely. And we can’t forget the Demo-
crat efforts to defund the police. 
Police have been vilified for easily 2 
years now, and what has been the re-
sult? Shootings, assaults, and killings 
of police officers have been on the rise 
since 2020. Budget cuts have forced vet-
eran police officers into retirement. 
Municipalities are having real trouble 
finding new police recruits and, in 
many cases, keeping the police they 
currently have on their force. 
We should be doing everything we 
can to support the police who risk 
their lives to keep us safe. 
Despite these terrible developments, 
the 
administration 
has 
repeatedly 
nominated 
individuals 
with 
these 
strong anti-police views. Consider some 
examples. There is Federal district 
court judge Nusrat Choudhury, an 
ACLU lawyer who falsely claimed that 
‘‘cops kill unarmed Black men in 
America every single day.’’ When Sen-
ator KENNEDY confronted her 2 weeks 
ago about this demonstrably false anti- 
police statement, she defended it as 
‘‘rhetorical advocacy.’’ In addition, 
multiple Biden administration nomi-
nees 
have 
expressed 
support 
for 
defunding the police, including HUD 
nominee Solomon Greene and Kristen 
Clarke and Vanita Gupta. 
With National Police Week starting 
this Sunday, what a terrible message 
the Senate is sending to law enforce-
ment by having voted yesterday to 
confirm Lisa Cook for the Federal Re-
serve. Professor Cook publicly called 
for the firing of a professor—a col-
league of hers—because he dared to 
criticize the ‘‘defund the police’’ move-
ment. She actually encouraged dona-
tions to the very bail funds that were 
helping criminals get out of jail during 
the riots after George Floyd was killed. 
She also insulted U.S. police officers by 
comparing their actions to the ‘‘heavy- 
handed tactics’’ of the Russian police. 
Now, to make matters worse, the 
Senate is being asked to confirm Julia 
Gordon for FHA Commissioner. Ms. 
Gordon has a history of very troubling 
statements 
denigrating 
the 
police. 
Among other things, she retweeted an 
inflammatory post that described po-
lice officers as ‘‘the people killing us.’’ 
That is how she describes the police. 
She also suggested in a letter that 
she wrote—not a tweet or retweet, a 
letter she wrote—that cases of police 
violence are not just outliers but 
‘‘stem from flawed and biased systems 
that require structural change.’’ Ms. 
Gordon’s insinuation that the institu-
tion of policing itself requires struc-
tural change because police officers are 
racist—that idea is offensive and, in 
my view, should disqualify her from 
holding a senior position in the Federal 
Government, and that view is shared 
by the National Sheriffs’ Association, a 
leading law enforcement group which 
has publicly opposed her nomination. 
Ms. Gordon has also spread caustic 
rhetoric about her fellow Americans re-
siding 
in 
Southern 
States. 
She 
retweeted an article that asserted that 
the South ‘‘has rejected nearly every-
thing that’s good about this country 
and has become one big nuclear waste 
site 
of 
choleric, 
and 
extremely 
racialized, resentment.’’ 
She has repeatedly disparaged elect-
ed Republican officials, including our 
colleagues Senator GRAHAM and Sen-
ator PAUL and former Vice President 
Pence. Having spread such partisan 
views, it is hard to imagine her work-
ing cooperatively with both parties in 
Congress to help all American house-
holds. 
Unfortunately, we don’t know the 
full extent of Ms. Gordon’s public 
statements because she deleted some of 
her previously public tweets before 
being nominated. I asked her to try to 
recover her deleted tweets from Twit-
ter because that is possible, but she re-
fused to comply with this very reason-
able request. It kind of makes you won-
der, what does she have to hide? 
During the nomination process, Ms. 
Gordon has tried to walk back her past 
statements, but I think we should 
focus on what she said before she was 
nominated and needed the Senate’s ap-
proval. 
I am reminded of something that the 
poet Maya Angelou said: 
When someone shows you who they are, be-
lieve them the first time. 
That is good advice when it comes to 
nominees, especially Ms. Gordon. 
If Ms. Gordon’s anti-police views and 
hostility toward one of our two polit-
ical parties are not sufficient for some 
of my colleagues to oppose her, I urge 
them to look at her record on housing 
policy. 
Despite 
record 
home 
and 
rental 
prices, 
Ms. 
Gordon 
advocates 
for 
throwing more taxpayer money at the 
housing market despite the fact that it 
is government intervention that has 
caused the massive inflation we have 
seen or a large part of the massive in-
flation we have seen in the housing 
market. 
As we prepare to start National Po-
lice Week this Sunday, I urge my col-
leagues: Stand up for law enforcement 
by opposing Julia Gordon. 
I ask President Biden to nominate a 
less radical nominee, someone who sup-
ports the police, someone who can gar-
ner bipartisan support and who won’t 
exacerbate rising housing costs. 
I yield the floor.

S2443 
May 11, 2022 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be able to 
complete my remarks before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to 
support Julia Gordon, who is very, very 
qualified. 
There is a pattern of Republicans 
blocking very qualified women in this 
body—very qualified women nominees 
for all kinds of jobs. We see it night 
after night after night. I could cite lots 
of examples. They will say, ‘‘Well, we 
support women for jobs that aren’t 
quite as important,’’ but these really 
key, extraordinarily important jobs— 
the Federal Reserve, FHFA, the Ex-Im 
Bank, certainly this job at HUD—we 
know—we can read between the lines. 
Let’s just leave it at that. 
Ms. Gordon made clear that she 
doesn’t support defunding the police. 
People have done all kinds of things on 
social media on both sides, left and 
right. We can make all our decisions 
based 
on 
something 
somebody 
retweeted, but it is not the way to run 
a government. We know that. 
I urge my colleagues to support Ms. 
Gordon, who is highly qualified—dec-
ades of experience—and has broad sup-
port from the Mortgage Bankers Asso-
ciation, the Manufactured Housing In-
stitute, and Habitat for Humanity. Her 
support is bipartisan. Brian Mont-
gomery, 
FHA 
Commissioner 
under 
George W. Bush and HUD’s Deputy Sec-
retary under Donald Trump, wrote in 
support. 
Ms. Gordon served as president of the 
National 
Community 
Stabilization 
Trust, the nonprofit that supports 
neighborhood revitalization and afford-
able home ownership. Before that, she 
served as the manager of the single- 
family policy team at the Federal 
Housing Finance Agency, FHFA, work-
ing to help families stay in their 
homes. 
She has devoted her life to housing. 
She has helped people get an oppor-
tunity to live decent lives in clean, af-
fordable, safe housing. 
She has led a whole team of policy 
analysts overseeing all aspects of sin-
gle-family mortgage policy at Fannie 
and Freddie. Hundreds of thousands of 
homeowners and seniors with FHA 
loans and reverse mortgages are at risk 
of losing their homes, either because 
they are falling behind or they are 
exiting forbearance. At this critical 
time, we need her on the job imme-
diately. 
Unfortunately, my colleagues on the 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Committee thought it important to 
delay, delay, delay, to slow-walk, slow- 
walk, slow-walk, to boycott, boycott, 
boycott. The Presiding Officer today 
has seen it up close as a member of 
that committee. 
Her breadth of experience will help 
her work with a variety of stake-
holders to design policies across the Of-
fice of Housing that will strengthen 
families and communities and help us 
bring down the cost of housing. 
I urge my colleagues to confirm Julia 
Gordon today. Let’s do our jobs. Let’s 
focus on the results Americans care 
about and expect from their public 
servants. 
WOMEN’S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. President, I rise to speak in sup-
port of keeping Roe v. Wade, the legis-
lation that the Senate failed to pass 
earlier today. I will enter my remarks 
in the RECORD. I just want to highlight 
a couple of things that we don’t want 
MITCH MCCONNELL, we don’t want Gov-
ernor DeWine in my State making per-
sonal health decisions for Ohio. 
I want Ohio women to make those de-
cisions. I certainly don’t want the 
State legislature in my State making 
those decisions, when these decisions 
are the most personal decision that a 
woman and perhaps her religious coun-
selor, perhaps her doctor—her doctor 
and her partner should be making 
those decisions. 
Men often don’t understand how 
women’s bodies work and how preven-
tive care like birth control works. This 
is not just about Roe. This ruling 
would open the door to all kinds of 
other government interference into 
people’s most personal, private deci-
sions. 
I would—and I have seen—a State 
legislator in Ohio said if a woman is 
raped and gets pregnant, there is an op-
portunity for that woman. That was 
said by sort of a typical far-right legis-
lator in Ohio, and she is one of the 
leaders in the next step—what they are 
going to do on issues of women’s health 
in my State legislature. It is important 
we act. 
I know there are other things we are 
going to do in this body, and I will sup-
port those efforts to make sure that 
women—not MITCH
MCCONNELL
and 
Mike DeWine—make decisions about 
women’s health. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF PHILIP NATHAN JEFFERSON 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I 
urge my colleagues to vote for Dr. 
Philip Jefferson. 
Dr. Philip Jefferson is one of the 
country’s leading thinkers on the eco-
nomics of poverty, and he will be a key 
voice on the Fed as it tackles inflation. 
He is the vice president for academic 
affairs, dean of faculty, and a Paul B. 
Freeland professor of economics at Da-
vidson College. He will serve alongside 
Dr. Cook. It will mark the first time 
ever that two Black Governors will 
have served on the Board at the same 
time. Dr. Jefferson grew up here in 
Washington in the shadow of RFK Sta-
dium. His first job out of school was to 
work at the Federal Reserve. He lit-
erally wrote the book on the economics 
of poverty. 
He was voted out by the presiding of-
ficers of my Banking, Housing, and 
Urban 
Affairs 
Committee, 
unani-
mously, on a strong bipartisan vote. He 
will fiercely guard the Fed’s independ-
ence. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for Dr. 
Philip Jefferson for the Federal Re-
serve.

CONFIRMATION OF ALVARO M. BEDOYA 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
rise tonight to highlight the signifi-
cance of the vote we took earlier 
today, and that is to confirm Alvaro 
Bedoya to be Commissioner of the Fed-
eral Trade Commission. 
Not only is this a critical moment for 
us to act and help American con-
sumers, Alvaro Bedoya is the right per-
son to get this job. 
The FTC is the first line of defense 
for consumers. And if a company is 
lying to its customers about their 
products and what they can do or 
teaming up with competitors to keep 
prices high, the FTC is the officer on 
the beat to stop bad actors and to pro-
tect those consumers. 
Now we need the FTC more than 
ever. We needed them during the 
COVID pandemic when scammers were 
looking to capitalize on the pandemic 
and stole $5.9 billion out of the pocket-
books of Americans. That is just the 
amount that was consumer reported. It 
doesn’t include people who never knew 
they were scammed or were too embar-
rassed to report their losses. 
Just as we needed them then, we 
need them to continue to help us dur-
ing the pandemic to stop scammers 
from selling fake cures and counterfeit 
masks. We need them to tackle rising 
prices that threaten all of us today. 
Protecting consumers is a bipartisan 
issue. In the Senate, we worked across 
the aisle to support the FTC, and Con-
gress pumped the FTC’s power at the 
end of 2020 when we passed the COVID– 
19 Consumer Protection Act to help 
root out the promoters of dangerous 
fake treatments and cures. We also 
gave the FTC $30 million in the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan to protect Americans 
against these scams. 
Today, we will take this important 
step in helping to protect consumers by 
having Mr. Bedoya fill the last seat on 
the Federal Trade Commission. He has 
the right experience to tackle some of 
the most complicated and pressing 
issues that we have, that we are facing 
regarding a variety of issues from pri-
vacy to online privacy. 
Being the Founding Director of the 
Center of Privacy and Technology at 
Georgetown Law where he was a pro-
fessor, he did amazing work. And prior 
to joining Georgetown, he served as 
Chief Counsel of the U.S. Senate Judi-
ciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Tech-
nology, and the Law. 
Many of my colleagues know Mr. 
Bedoya; and I am glad his nomination 
finally has passed here in the Senate, 
and we look forward to working with 
him. 
NOMINATION OF ADMIRAL LINDA L. FAGAN 
Mr. President, I also want to speak 
about the historical significance of an-
other nominee that will be voted on 
shortly. Tonight, hopefully, in the 
wrap-up, we will be passing on the 
nomination of Admiral Linda Fagan to 
be the next Commandant of the U.S. 
Coast Guard. The Coast Guard serves 
the American people by safeguarding 
life at sea, protecting the environment, 
and ensuring our national security. 
The role of Commandant is to lead 
the Coast Guard’s approximately 55,000 
Active Duty, reserve, and civilian 
workers, and approximately 26,000 vol-
unteers in the execution of the Coast 
Guard’s 11 different missions. 
From managing vessel traffic, to 
tackling drug smugglers, to saving 
lives in rough seas, to protecting en-
dangered marine life, no military serv-
ice does more with fewer resources. Yet 
the Coast Guard’s mission is only 
growing. The Coast Guard faces un-
precedented environmental and geo-
political challenges. 
Due to the increasing threat of cli-
mate change, men and women of the 
Coast Guard must respond to increas-
ing and frequent severe weather disas-
ters. In the Arctic, where melting ice 
sheets provide new opportunities for 
shipping and tourism and transpor-
tation, it is very important that the 
Coast Guard play a major role in mak-
ing sure that we know how and have 
the capacity for the United States to 
lead in icebreaking capacity through 
the Arctic. 
Admiral Fagan assumed the role of 
Vice Commandant in June of 2021, and 
she led the largest modernization and 
shipbuilding effort of the Coast Guard 
fleet since World War II. 
But I want people from the North-
west to know she started her career on 
the Polar Star, a 399-foot icebreaker 
homeported in Seattle. During her ca-
reer, she served on all seven con-
tinents. 
She has held numerous leadership po-
sitions, including more than 15 years as 
a marine inspector and commander for 
Sector New York, commander for Coast 
Guard District 1 where she led all 
Coast Guard operations in New Eng-
land, and Commander of the Pacific 
Area in charge of Coast Guard oper-
ations across the entire Pacific. 
She has an impressive science back-
ground, with a bachelor’s degree in ma-
rine science from the Coast Guard 
Academy and two master’s degrees— 
one of which is from the University of 
Washington—in marine affairs. 
In addition to her extraordinary 
qualifications, Admiral Fagan will be 
the first woman and mother to lead the 
Coast Guard. She will also be the first 
woman to lead any branch of our 
armed services. 
Now, more than ever, we must have a 
strong, tested leader as Commandant. 
It is clear from her record that Admi-
ral Fagan is the right woman to do her 
job. 
I look forward to working with her to 
ensure the men and women of the 
Coast Guard have the tools they need 
to execute their mission and support 
their families. And it means continuing 
to make investments on shore infra-
structure, aircraft, and, as I mentioned 
earlier, our polar icebreakers. 
But just as we have fought hard to 
work with the Coast Guard and their 
people, it is time to work with Com-
mandant Fagan to continue the hard 
work to expand paid family leave poli-
cies, to improve access to childcare, to 
champion efforts to retain women and 
underrepresented minorities serving in 
the Coast Guard. 
Recently, we helped secure $429 mil-
lion for the Coast Guard infrastructure 
in the infrastructure bill and $120 mil-
lion of that investment will go to con-
struction of onsite childcare facilities. 
As our working mothers and working 
daughters serve in the Coast Guard, 
Admiral Fagan knows the realities of a

Coast Guard family. She knows that 
with 40 percent of the Coast Guard 
being women, we need to have good 
policies that will continue to encour-
age them to stay in the Coast Guard 
and move up in leadership, just as she 
has done. I know under her, we will 
build world-class, state-of-the-art fa-
cilities to help all our Coasties and all 
our Coast families. I know that we will 
continue to be proud of the mission of 
the Coast Guard in continuing to have 
those many, many challenges that they 
help us deal with every single day. 
But tonight, we are doing more than 
just helping. We are confirming Admi-
ral Fagan. We are sending a strong 
message to women serving in the Coast 
Guard. We are sending a strong mes-
sage to women cadets and the Academy 
and training people at Cape May. We 
are sending a strong message to young 
girls who dream of someday serving in 
the Coast Guard. We are saying now, 
that the leader of this organization, 
that your service matters, your con-
tribution to the Coast Guard and to the 
country matters, and, yes, you too can 
be Commandant someday. 
I want to thank Admiral Fagan for 
her tremendous service, and I thank

Fagan to be Commandant of the U.S.

10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
MASSACRE AT AHUAS, HONDURAS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, 10 years 
ago today a joint counternarcotics 
team of Honduran security agents and 
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion—DEA—officers opened fire on a 
water taxi as it approached Ahuas, a 
small town located in the remote 
Mosquitia region of northeastern Hon-
duras. 
The canoe-like taxi was carrying 
families traveling between the indige-
nous Miskito villages that populate the 
shores of the Patuca River when it was 
shot at repeatedly by the counter-
narcotics officers, leaving two women, 
a teenage boy, and a 21-year-old man 
dead and several other passengers in-
jured. While the Honduran police an-
nounced that a ‘‘successful’’ drug inter-
diction mission had taken place, jour-
nalists and human rights advocates re-
ported the victims were unarmed and 
had no known links to drug trafficking. 
Instead of taking responsibility, as-
sessing their mistakes, and examining 
their methods and partnerships with 
Honduran security forces, DEA and 
State Department officials obstructed 
U.S. and Honduran investigations of 
the incident and falsely reported to 
Members of Congress, including my 
staff, that the boat’s passengers had 
fired on security forces. They also in-
sisted that the DEA bore no responsi-
bility for the discharging of weapons 
and had only played a supportive and 
advisory role during the mission. After 
the horrifying events of May 11, 2012, 
the DEA continued joint operations 
using battlefield tactics in the area 
that resulted in two more fatal shoot-
ings. Following one of these incidents, 
the Honduran police team leader was 
reported to have been instructed by his 
superiors to plant a weapon into evi-
dence. 
It was only thanks to a joint Depart-
ment of Justice and Department of 
State Inspector General investigation 
report—published 5 years ago—that 
Congress was able to learn the truth 
about Ahuas and the two other fatal 
shootings. DEA agents had in fact 
played a central, leading role in the le-
thal operation. They had ordered a 
Honduran machine gunner to open fire 
on the water taxi and never verified 
whether DEA weapons had been dis-
charged. The DEA’s repeated assertions 
that someone on the boat had fired a 
weapon were found to not be credible.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2446 
May 11, 2022 
As senior DEA officials obstructed 
the work of the inspector generals, it 
was not until 5 years after the Ahuas 
shooting that the victims were finally 
cleared of any wrongdoing. But justice 
for the victims and their families re-
mains elusive. Though the lives of 
those left behind have been shattered, 
some by debilitating injuries and oth-
ers by the loss of parents and bread-
winners, they have not received fair 
compensation, and they have lan-
guished in dire poverty. The wrongful 
actions that resulted in their injuries 
or the death of their loved ones have 
not been punished in any way. Those 
who misled Congress, willfully con-
cealing their agencies’ deadly errors, 
were not disciplined at all, and one sen-
ior official even received a promotion. 
The U.S. Embassy and the DEA coordi-
nated this operation with the Honduras 
National Police Director Juan Carlos 
Bonilla. Today, Bonilla is in custody 
after being extradited to the U.S., 
charged with ordering assassinations in 
support of drug traffickers protected 
by former President Juan Orlando Her-
nandez. 
In honor of these and other victims 
of deadly errors committed by U.S. 
counternarcotics agents abroad, it is 
imperative that we hold ourselves and 
our institutions accountable and that 
we recognize our mistakes and correct 
them. If we claim to believe in justice 
and the rule of law, we cannnot allow 
Federal officials to misrepresent the 
facts and cover up their wrongdoing 
when reporting to Congress. 
We must also provide support to vic-
tims of the so-called drug war, not stig-
matize and slander them, and examine 
the impact that our approach to drug 
interdiction has on areas like the 
Moskitia. It was obvious soon after the 
massacre that those who had directed 
and carried it out had minimal knowl-
edge of the people and communities of 
that isolated area. They rushed to 
judgment, assuming that anyone trav-
eling that river, no matter how impov-
erished, must be in some way involved 
in trafficking drugs and therefore a le-
gitimate target of lethal force. Those 
who pay the price for militarized polic-
ing and for the corruption and violence 
drug trafficking organizations use to 
protect their activities are the most 
vulnerable: 
indigenous 
communities 
like Ahuas and the human rights activ-
ists who defend the rights of those 
caught in the crossfire. 
I wish I could say that the DEA and 
the State Department have learned the 
lessons of Ahuas. But that will not be 
possible until those who fired on those 
innocent people and lied about it are 
brought to justice and until the vic-
tims are properly compensated and 
cared for. That is the shared responsi-
bility of the U.S. and Honduran Gov-
ernments. 
RECOGNIZING THE 2022 AMERICAN 
AMBULANCE 
ASSOCIATION 
STARS OF LIFE 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the paramedics, emer-
gency medical technicians—EMTs—and 
other emergency medical services— 
EMS—professionals across the country 
who provide vital 9–1-1 emergency and 
nonemergency medical care across this 
country. 
These 
healthcare 
profes-
sionals are on the frontlines and put 
the needs of their patients before their 
own. I would like to recognize, in par-
ticular, those EMS professionals being 
honored last week as ‘‘Stars of Life’’ by 
the American Ambulance Association. 
Every year, the dispatch of an ambu-
lance is the first response to millions 
of medical emergencies. Often, the sur-
vival of a patient hinges on the prompt 
medical attention provided by para-
medics and EMTs prior to the arrival 
at an emergency room. As a result of 
the selfless acts of these courageous 
and devoted individuals, thousands of 
Americans lives are saved each year. 
This was especially true during the 
COVID–19 pandemic as paramedics and 
EMTs provided medical care, vaccina-
tions, testing, and ambulance trans-
port for 24 hours a day and 7 days a 
week. These professionals deserve our 
utmost gratitude. 
For the past 30 years, the American 
Ambulance Association has honored 
those paramedics, EMTs, dispatchers, 
and other ambulance service personnel 
who exemplify what is best about the 
EMS field. The American Ambulance 
Association 
has 
appropriately 
des-
ignated these exceptional individuals 
as ‘‘Stars of Life.’’ 
I am especially proud of the six Stars 
of Life from our State of Arkansas. 
Devin 
Holland, 
Kenneth 
Jenkins, 
Randy Murry, Amanda Nesbitt, Alvin 
Short of Pafford EMS in Hope, and

SA 5032. Ms. CANTWELL (for Mr. 
DURBIN (for himself and Mr. RISCH)) 
proposed an amendment to the resolu-
tion S. Res. 456, expressing support for 
a free, fair, and peaceful December 4, 
2021, election in The Gambia; as fol-
lows: 
Strike the preamble and insert the fol-
lowing: 
Whereas, in 1965, The Gambia became inde-
pendent from Great Britain; 
Whereas, in 1970, The Gambia became a re-
public following a public referendum, and 
Dawda Jawara was elected president and 
subsequently reelected an additional five 
times; 
Whereas, from 1970 to 1994, The Gambia 
was one of Africa’s longest running democ-
racies and home to the continent’s human 
rights body, the African Commission on 
Human and People’s Rights; 
Whereas, in 1994, President Jawara was 
forcibly removed from office in a coup by the 
Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council 
(AFPRC), led by Lieutenant Yahya Jammeh; 
Whereas, after two years of direct AFPRC 
rule that was heavily criticized by the inter-
national community, a flawed constitutional 
reform process occurred and The Gambia 
scheduled a new presidential election; 
Whereas, in the lead up to the September 
1996 presidential election, the Jammeh mili-
tary government outlawed the country’s 
main opposition parties, restricted media 
freedom, prohibited meetings between rival 
candidates and foreign diplomats, and used 
soldiers to attack opposition rallies; 
Whereas Jammeh won the 1996 presidential 
election in a process widely regarded as 
flawed by international observers; 
Whereas President Jammeh won reelection 
in 2001, 2006, and 2011 in electoral processes 
marred by political repression, intimidation, 
and technical flaws; 
Whereas Jammeh’s presidency saw tar-
geted violence and widespread gross human 
rights violations, particularly against mem-
bers of the media, including the murder of 
editor Deyda Hydara and the disappearance 
of journalist Ebrima Manneh; 
Whereas President Jammeh personally or-
dered the kidnapping and torture of individ-
uals he accused of ‘‘witchcraft’’ and threat-
ened others over their sexual orientation; 
Whereas thousands of Gambians fled into 
exile out of concern for their safety, becom-
ing refugees in Africa at large and elsewhere; 
Whereas the Jammeh government’s human 
rights record was widely criticized by re-
gional 
and 
international 
human 
rights 
groups, as well as the United States, the Eu-
ropean Union, and members of the United 
States Senate; 
Whereas, in December 2016, opposition 
grand coalition candidate Adama Barrow, 
who campaigned on the promise of electoral 
and constitutional reform, won an upset 
election victory against President Jammeh; 
Whereas, immediately after the 2016 elec-
tion, Jammeh publicly accepted the defeat, 
but then later rejected the results and re-
fused to depart the presidency; 
Whereas Jammeh’s refusal to accept defeat 
was widely condemned, with the African 
Union refusing to recognize him as president 
and the Economic Community of West Afri-
can States deploying an international inter-
vention force to The Gambia; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2017, Barrow was 
sworn in as president at the Gambian Em-
bassy in Senegal; 
Whereas, on January 20, 2017, Jammeh and 
his family departed The Gambia, reportedly 
stealing more than $1,000,000,000 from state 
coffers, eventually to appear in Equatorial 
Guinea, where he remains in political exile 
with impunity; 
Whereas President Barrow initially agreed 
to limit his term to a three-year transition 
ending on January 19, 2020, but later stated 
his intent to serve the full five-year con-
stitutional term; 
Whereas the Gambian Truth, Reconcili-
ation, and Reparations Commission (TRRC) 
was established by an act of the Gambian 
Parliament to examine abuses committed 
during the Jammeh era and make rec-
ommendations as to whom to hold account-
able; 
Whereas more than 370 victims and former 
government officials testified at widely 
viewed TRRC hearings that documented 
widespread human rights abuses; 
Whereas on November 25, 2021, the TRRC 
submitted its final report to President Bar-
row detailing the death of more than 240 peo-
ple, torture, rape, and disappearances under 
the Jammeh regime; 
Whereas on December 4, 2021, The Gambia 
held the first post-Jammeh era presidential 
election, which included six presidential can-
didates; 
Whereas the December 4, 2021 election oc-
curred peacefully, with high voter turnout 
and under the observation of a significant 
number of domestic and international mon-
itors; 
Whereas, on December 5, 2021, The Gam-
bia’s 
Independent 
Electoral 
Commission 
(IEC) announced the results, showing that 
President Barrow had won reelection; 
Whereas, on December 5, 2021, domestic 
election observers and other stakeholders re-
leased a joint statement noting that ‘‘the 
elections were conducted generally in an at-
mosphere of transparency and fairness as ob-
served by domestic and international observ-
ers’’ and reminded candidates of the Code of 
Conduct for Peaceful Elections provision to 
‘‘accept the results of the election as an-
nounced by the Chairperson of the IEC’’; 
Whereas, on December 5, 2021, former 
President 
of 
Sierra 
Leone 
Ernest 
Bai 
Koroma, who led an election observation 
mission from the Economic Community of 
West African States (ECOWAS), appealed to 
all the Gambian candidates ‘‘to accept the 
outcome of the election in good faith’’; 
Whereas, on December 24, 2021, the Gambia 
Truth, Reconciliation, and Reparations Com-
mission published its findings that former 
President Jammeh was responsible for more 
than 20 years of killings, torture, and rape 
and recommended that those responsible be 
prosecuted, saying, ‘‘To forgive and forget 
with impunity the violations and abuses ... 
would not only undermine reconciliation but 
would also constitute a massive and egre-
gious cover-up of the crimes committed.’’; 
Whereas, on December 28, 2021, the Gambia 
Supreme Court dismissed a challenge to the 
election results; and 
Whereas, on January 18, 2022, the Inde-
pendent Electoral Commission announced 
that National Assembly elections would be 
held on April 9, 2022: Now, therefore, be it
