LETTER TO CONGRESS FROM THE 
DUDYKEVYCH FAMILY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to read a letter from the 
Dudykevych family, who are originally 
from Ukraine and are now living in 
Tega Cay, South Carolina. They still 
have family who refuse to leave their 
homes and their country which, as we 
all know by now, is under brutal at-
tack by the Russians. 
The father of the Dudykevych family 
literally built their home with his own 
hands, which is now being destroyed 
for one reason and one reason alone— 
they desire freedom. 
The heartfelt letter reads like this: 
‘‘To President Biden and to Members 
of the 117th Congress of the United 
States of America, we highly appre-
ciate your legislative initiatives and 
clear stance against the cruel and dia-
bolic 
Russian 
aggression 
against 
Ukraine. 
‘‘Today, I am urgently asking you to 
actively support immediate delivery of 
Eastern European fighter planes to 
Ukraine. The brave Ukrainian Army 
and the country’s heroic citizens are 
winning the war on the ground. 
‘‘The problem is that Ukraine’s cities 
are being destroyed and the citizens 
are being murdered from the air. I am 
requesting your urgent help in con-
vincing the White House that imme-
diate 
delivery 
of 
MiG 
planes 
to 
Ukraine should be the highest priority 
in support of a free Ukraine. 
‘‘What we are witnessing is a geno-
cide against the Ukrainian people. We 
have an ability in this country and in 
the allied bases in Europe to stop these 
murderous attacks from the air. We 
have a moral obligation to do so. Our 
words are meant to reinforce President 
Zelenskyy’s urgent demand for fighter 
planes. 
‘‘Ukrainian cities are lying in ruins, 
and thousands of citizens are dead and 
will keep dying because Ukraine’s de-
nial of fighter jets. These planes will 
protect the Ukrainian sky from Rus-
sian air raids. 
‘‘There are MiG–29 warplanes sitting 
at Allied bases in Europe ready for an 
immediate transfer. Ukrainian pilots 
are well-trained on these warplanes 
and can use them to stop the mur-
derous attacks from the air tonight. 
‘‘We can no longer sit back and 
watch schools, hospitals, homes, apart-
ment buildings, bomb shelters, every-
day people of all ages being mass mur-
dered on a daily basis. 
‘‘The news that a mother in labor and 
her unborn baby died after a maternity 
ward was bombed in Mariupol broke 
my heart. It is a tragedy that could 
have been prevented if Ukraine had the 
planes to defend the sky. 
‘‘I know you deal with many re-
quests, but this is an existential need. 
Ukraine will not survive without your 
support. Nothing means more to me at 
this moment. The world is in desperate 
need of American leadership. Sin-
cerely, Mila Dudykevych.’’ 
This letter was emailed to me 12 days 
ago on Sunday, March 27, at 2:50 p.m. 
We all have seen the death and destruc-
tion that has occurred since this date, 
all which could have been avoided if 
this President had exercised leadership 
months ago by allowing for the release 
of the fighter jets, which he failed then 
and continues to fail now by refusing 
to honor the request of a desperate 
Ukrainian people whose only desire is 
to live in a free country for which they 
are willing to fight and die. 
President Biden, the Ukrainian peo-
ple and all the free people around the 
world do not deserve this type of bla-
tant incompetence and willful neglect 
by the leader of the free world. Histo-
rians will record this truly sad course 
of events for all the world to see in the 
coming months and years. Mr. Presi-
dent, the words that will be recorded in 
the annals of history will not be kind. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4194 
April 6, 2022 
the town of Bucha revealed the scope of 
the appalling war crimes committed by 
Vladimir Putin’s military. 
Journalists and the Ukrainian mili-
tary discovered mass graves, bodies left 
in the streets, and the evidence of a 
massacre of civilians. These are war 
crimes. 
We know now, with certainty, what 
fate awaits Ukrainians who are sub-
jected to Russian occupation. The 
United States must open its doors to 
welcome Ukrainians who are fleeing 
this invasion. 
As co-chair of the Congressional 
Ukraine Caucus, early on in the con-
flict, I and others called on the Biden 
administration to extend temporary 
protected status to Ukrainians already 
in the United States. I was proud when 
the President heeded that call and 
when he subsequently increased the 
refugee cap. 
We must do everything in our power 
to 
accept 
fleeing 
refugees 
expedi-
tiously. This is a matter of life and 
death. Over 4 million refugees have al-
ready fled the violence in Ukraine. Half 
of those refugees are children. Millions 
more remain trapped in cities and vil-
lages without access to food, clean 
water, or medical care. 
We now know that Putin’s military 
is willing to slaughter any innocents 
left behind. It is absolutely critical 
that the U.S. do everything in its 
power to assist the people of Ukraine. 
This means military assistance, yes, 
but it also means providing for Ukrain-
ians who make the difficult decision to 
leave their homes behind. 
We must support the nations that are 
already taking in refugees. Allies, like 
Poland, have already admitted more 
than 2 million Ukrainian refugees into 
their nation, and we should ensure that 
Poland and other countries that have 
opened their doors are able to help 
these Ukrainians resettle safely. 
This also means continuing to inves-
tigate the reports of refugees of color 
being turned away at border crossings. 
Here in the U.S., we have a long his-
tory as a safe harbor for people of the 
world. 
It has been inspiring to see Ameri-
cans offer unwavering support for 
Ukraine from the outset of the Russian 
invasion. I am confident that this sup-
port will mean Americans will rally to-
gether to support any Ukrainian refu-
gees who arrive on our shores. As they 
do, Congress has an opportunity to re-
form our immigration system to be 
more welcoming to individuals around 
the world who are in need. 
I share the outrage of my constitu-
ents who are watching what is unfold-
ing in Ukraine. As an advocate for 
Ukrainians here at home and abroad, I 
am also reminded that there are other 
atrocities occurring around the world. 
We can, and must, extend the same 
outrage we have for the crimes in 
Bucha to the crimes in Syria, the con-
flict in Tigray, the famine in Yemen, 
and the violence in the Northern Tri-
angle. And just as we open our doors to 
Ukrainian refugees, we can, and must, 
open our doors to refugees from around 
the world. 
In recent weeks, I have urged the 
Biden administration to end title 42. 
This policy allowed the U.S. to use the 
pandemic as justification for expelling 
migrants without a hearing before an 
immigration judge. The administration 
just announced last week that they in-
tend to end this policy. 
One immediate effect will be that 
Ukrainians arriving at our borders will 
be able to seek asylum more easily, 
but, critically, it also means that mi-
grants from the global south will no 
longer be stranded in the immigration 
process. 
The 
Federal 
Government 
should seek out other avenues in which 
providing recourse for Ukrainians will 
make our system more equitable for all 
immigrants. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, 
foreign citizens seeking entry into the 
U.S. have faced months-long waits for 
counselor appointments. That backlog 
now 
threatens 
to 
prevent 
fleeing 
Ukrainians from reaching our shores. 
The lengthy immigrant visa delays 
have caused many Ukrainians to turn 
to nonimmigrant visas so they can 
reach temporary safety with family or 
friends in the U.S. Yet, as Ukrainians 
and other foreign citizens have been in-
creasingly 
forced 
to 
utilize 
non-
immigrant visas, wait times have dras-
tically increased. 
Reporting last month showed that 
wait times in Hungary were 275 days. 
In Moldova, the wait was 329 days. On 
February 28, the wait in Warsaw, Po-
land, was 86 days. Two days later, the 
wait was 134 days for visitor visas and 
more than 40 days for other types. 
I sincerely hope the State Depart-
ment finds a way to dramatically de-
crease processing times for Ukrainians 
who have fled their homelands, but we 
cannot simply prioritize Ukrainian 
cases and leave all others behind. 
These wait times impact immigrants, 
refugees, and asylum seekers from 
around the world. Ukrainians are not 
the only ones whose lives are in dan-
ger. 
The tragedy in Ukraine has shone a 
bright spotlight on the need for our en-
tire immigration system to be more in-
clusive. Congress cannot allow this mo-
ment to pass without finally address-
ing the flaws in our system. Too many 
lives hang in the balance for us to do 
nothing.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MIKE 
JILOTY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. WALTZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, on De-
cember 25, Volusia County, Florida, 
lost a great businessman and valued 
community 
leader, 
Mike 
Jiloty. 
Through Mike’s hard work and per-
sonal approach to business, he received 
hundreds of industry awards. Serving 
as the president of United Way of 
Volusia and Flagler Counties, Mike 
fought for the health, education, and 
stability of every person in his commu-
nity. He dedicated his time to the FU-
TURES Foundation for Volusia County 
Schools to better prepare students for 
their careers. 
As a graduate of the Leadership Flor-
ida Class XIV, Mike used his skills as a 
leader to serve his community and was 
honored by several organizations, in-
cluding the Volusia Association of 
School Administrators, the Daytona 
Beach Community College Foundation, 
the Conklin Center for the Blind, and 
the Lodging and Hospitality Associa-
tion of Volusia County. 
Madam Speaker, Mike Jiloty is a 
true example of a servant leader. He 
sought to inspire others, to make his 
community a better place, and he is 
missed dearly. It is my honor to recog-
nize him on the floor of the House of 
Representatives today. 
HONORING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF JACKIE 
ROBINSON INTEGRATING BASEBALL 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, Jackie 
Robinson once said, ‘‘A life is not im-
portant except in the impact it has on 
other lives.’’ On April 15, 1947, Jackie 
Robinson created a lasting impact on 
the lives of generations of Americans 
when he stepped out of the dugout at 
Ebbets Field before a crowd of more 
than 26,000 spectators. This moment 
would change the course of history and 
have a lasting impact for generations 
as he broke the color barrier as the 
first African-American player in pro-
fessional baseball history. 
Jackie Robinson is a true servant 
leader, and his life and legacy has had 
a major impact across the country, in-
cluding in my own congressional dis-
trict, where I am honored to have a 
piece of his legacy at the Daytona City 
Island Ballpark where, in 1946, Jackie 
Robinson played in the very first inte-
grated major league baseball spring 
training game. In 1990, in honor of the 
life and legacy of Jackie Robinson, the 
Daytona City Island Ballpark would be 
renamed the Jackie Robinson Memo-
rial Ballpark. 
Jackie Robinson’s impact was felt 
across the Nation. It was the first time 
a Black player competed with a minor 
league team against a major league 
team since the color line was imple-
mented in baseball in the 1880s. As we 
observe the 75th anniversary of his cou-
rageous act, it is clear the impact and 
legacy of Jackie Robinson on the ad-
vancement of human rights will be ev-
erlasting. 
A1A DESIGNATED AN ALL-AMERICAN ROAD 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, of the 
approximately 4 million miles of by-
ways and highways that stretch in all 
directions across the United States, 
there are very few that come close to 
the beauty, history, and serenity that 
encompasses the 72-mile stretch of A1A 
that runs from St. Johns County, Flor-
ida, to Flagler County. Flanked by the 
Atlantic Ocean and crisscrossing the 
St. Johns River and Intracoastal Wa-
terway, for more than 75 years the A1A

has provided motorists with breath-
taking views as it seamlessly inter-
twines 
Florida’s 
most 
remarkable 
coastal landscapes and deep-rooted his-
tory. 
As a kid growing up in northeast 
Florida, any drive along the A1A scenic 
and historic coastal byway was a re-
minder of how lucky we were to live in 
such a beautiful place. 
Now, as the Representative of Flor-
ida’s north central region, home to 
beautiful segments of A1A, I was proud 
to cast one of my very first votes in 
support of the Reviving America’s Sce-
nic Byways Act in February of 2019. 
This act requires the Department of 
Transportation to issue a request for 
nominations to be designated under the 
National Scenic Byways Program and 
make publicly available a list speci-
fying the roads designated. President 
Trump signed the bill into law in Sep-
tember of 2019. 
I am pleased to announce in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD that on March 29 of 
2022, the ribbon-cutting ceremony oc-
curred for the Federal Highway Admin-
istration’s designation of this beautiful 
stretch of A1A as an All-American 
Road.

REMEMBERING DR. TERRANCE 
NEWTON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Delaware (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam 
Speaker, today, I rise to remember the 
life of a remarkable public servant, 
leader, and educator, Dr. Terrance 
Newton. 
Today, family, friends, and his be-
loved Warner School community are 
saying good-bye to a person who they 
called Newt. 
Dr. Newton was a fixture in the Dela-
ware education system for decades, 
himself a product of Wilmington’s East 
Side, a Kappa Alpha Psi man, and a 
Delaware State University man. 
Newt would become known to his 
students as their most fervent advo-
cate and ally. Every morning, he would 
stand on the front steps of Warner Ele-
mentary and greet students as they 
passed through the front doors, hug-
ging them, high-fiving them, and in-
spiring every child. 
Dr. Newton was always looking for 
unique and impactful ways to connect 
with his students, going so far as to 
open a barbershop where he could cut 
the students’ hair in school, giving 
them a safe space to talk about their 
academics, 
their 
communities, 
and 
their lives. 
It is no exaggeration to say that Dr. 
Terrance Newton was a powerful pillar 
of the community, a real-life superhero 
who spent every day devoted to the 
next generation of Delawareans. 
We have lost Dr. Terrance Newton far 
too soon, but because of all the energy, 
inspiration, and love that he poured 
into his students, family, and commu-
nity, his legacy will live on for a life-
time. 
To his family, colleagues, students, 
friends, I send sincere condolences. 
Madam Speaker, I close with some 
words from Dr. Newton himself. He 
said of his students: ‘‘When I see them, 
I see me. So, my goal is to change the 
world.’’ 
Indeed, Dr. Newton, you did. 
f 
FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES 
TAKING FARMERS’ WATER SUP-
PLY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
have been speaking a little bit lately 
about our supply chain issues and the 
effects of inflation on real Americans, 
real families, and talking a lot about 
food grown in this country and the ef-
fects of some of the decisions made by 
government on the ability to grow 
food, especially in my home State of 
California, which affects so much of 
the supply chain for fruits, vegetables, 
and nut products that the whole coun-
try, and even the world export market, 
enjoys and uses. 
What we are wrestling with right now 
are decisions made by Federal and 
State agencies on the effects of water 
supply in California and the ripple ef-
fect it has on so many products. 
For example, earlier this year, a de-
cision was made to withdraw what is 
called a TUCP, a temporary urgency 
change petition, for the amount of 
water that would be flowing from our 
storage in California out through the 
delta and into the Pacific. This is 
geared toward how much water is going 
to be there for delta salinity and fish 
habitat situations in the delta and up-
stream, somewhat. 
There was an opportunity back in 
December and January to curtail some 
of the water flows that were coming 
out of limited storage we already have 
in the State of California, mainly Shas-
ta Dam and Oroville Dam, this on the 
heels of a drought last year. 
Lake Oroville, for example, hit its 
lowest number ever. It didn’t even 
make hydropower for the first time in 
50 years because the lake was so low. 
So, decisions were made based on a 
pretty decent amount of rainfall in Oc-
tober and quite a bit of rain and 
snowpack in December to withdraw 
what was called the TUCP, the tem-
porary urgency change petition, which 
would have the ability to let less water 
out through the delta and a little less 
for the salinity and fish habitat issues. 
By the way, the fish, one of the ones 
we are talking about, is called the 
delta smelt. They haven’t found one, in 
what they call trawls looking for the 
fish, in 3 years. They are pretty much 
nonexistent. Yet, we are still allowing 
hundreds of thousands of acre-feet of 
precious water to go out through the 
bay to somehow try to mitigate that 
situation. 
They decided to withdraw the change 
petition, the TUCP, a decision made on 
January 21, to say we are going to go 
ahead and let the water flow at a high-
er level than is necessary. Water will 
be trickling out of our dams, out of our 
storage, at a rate much more than is 
needed for a perception of salinity or 
fish. 
At the time when we are looking at 
drought in California, low water sup-
plies, and all the unrest we have in the 
world’s food supply chain—Hungary, 
for example, is not going to export 
grain this year. Russia and Ukraine 
had been world market participants in 
grain, especially Ukraine. 
Ukraine is a very, very rich country 
in wheat and many other ag products. 
Their farmers, right now, are out there 
trying to plant crops amidst all the 
bombs being dropped on them by Rus-
sia. God bless them. But farmers in 
this country are having bombs dropped 
on them by Federal and State agencies 
taking their water away. 
At a point where we could have cur-
tailed a little bit of the water going 
out through the delta and kept it for 
ag use to grow rice, to grow almonds, 
to grow olives, to grow tomatoes, many 
things that we need, they decided on 
January 21, no, we are just going to let 
the water go out at the same rate. 
At that point, Lake Shasta was only 
at 35 percent of its capacity. Lake 
Oroville was only at 45 percent of its 
capacity. They thought, well, we are 
going to bank on the idea that more 
rain is going to come post-January 21 
up until maybe April 1, when, histori-
cally, the rainfall tapers off. 
These lakes are both well under half 
full. They decided, no, we have plenty 
of water because we had a massive 
amount of rain and snow in December. 
I mean, they threw the baby out with 
the bathwater, so to speak, in making 
this decision because anybody could 
have seen that we needed to keep every 
drop in those lakes that is coming in 
there to build them up. 
Now, had they reached the flood 
stage where they have to allow a buffer 
of space in the dams to provide for 
flood control, which is approximately 
about 850 feet of elevation in Oroville 
and, I am going to guess, about 70, 75 
percent of capacity—they are well 
below that. They thought, oh, we are 
going to have so much water coming in 
that we will meet these marks. 
Well, guess what? The rain did not 
come in the latter part of January or 
February or March, and now we are in 
the first few days of April. 
Here at this point, we are going to be 
short on food, short on water, and they 
are just now thinking about putting 
the TUCP in here in early April. It is 
very shortsighted and appalling.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF DR.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4196 
April 6, 2022 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of an inspir-
ing leader, a great visionary, and my 
friend, Dr. Tom Rivera. 
Dr. Tom was born on September 22, 
1939, in Colton, California. After grad-
uating from Colton High School, he at-
tended San Bernardino Valley College; 
California State University, Los Ange-
les; the University of California, River-
side; and eventually UCLA, where he 
earned his doctorate in education. 
It was at Cal State LA that he met 
the love of his life, Dr. Lily Rivera, 
who shared his passion for service. To-
gether, they served in the Peace Corps 
in Colombia, South America, before 
marrying in 1965. 
In all that he did, Dr. Tom strived to 
inspire his students to achieve their 
dreams. As associate dean for under-
graduate 
studies 
at 
CSU 
San 
Bernardino, he was a pillar of the com-
munity. He devoted himself to the em-
powerment of local youth and main-
tained leadership roles in organizations 
including the Kiwanis Club of Greater 
San Bernardino, LULAC, the Pure 
Land Foundation, and more. 
Dr. Tom was relentless in his advo-
cacy. Even in the face of his own 
health challenges, he continued his 
pursuit of a better future where His-
panic 
youth 
could 
achieve 
their 
dreams. 
In 1984, just 3 years after contracting 
a virus that left him paralyzed, he 
helped found the Inland Empire Future 
Leaders Program, joining forces with 
fellow educators, Susan Castro, Frank 
Acosta, Henry Vasquez, and Bill Alli-
son. 
Dr. Tom founded the organization to 
address dropout rates among Hispanic 
students. His vision was to encourage 
youth to be proud of their roots and to 
make a difference in their commu-
nities. 
All these years later, that vision is 
fulfilled in the Inland Empire Future 
Leaders Program’s tremendous success. 
It is fulfilled in the educators, lawyers, 
doctors, and countless other Inland 
Empire Future Leaders Program grad-
uates who have gone on to achieve so 
many great things. 
It is fulfilled right here in the Halls 
of Congress with the gentleman from 
California (Mr. AGUILAR), my good 
friend, as Democratic Caucus vice 
chair, and with me as chair of the Con-
gressional Hispanic Caucus. 
I stand here because of Dr. Tom. 
Back in the early years, in 1986, I at-
tended 
one 
of 
IEFLP’s 
leadership 
trainings at Camp Seeley. That sum-
mer left a lasting mark on me and 
changed the course of my future. 
I learned the tools of leadership and 
returned home, motivated to serve the 
community. I became the first in 
Coachella Valley High School to be 
class president and ASB president all 4 
years, and I learned to identify prob-
lems that needed to be addressed and 
to become a part of the solution. 
The 
experience 
strengthened 
my 
dream and my resolve to become a doc-
tor and serve the community. You see, 
Dr. Tom’s guidance fueled in me a pas-
sion for social justice, a passion I lived 
as a pre-med student organizer at 
UCLA. 
It is with Dr. Tom’s encouragement 
that I applied to Harvard Medical 
School to earn my medical degree and 
graduate with my master’s in public 
health and my master’s in public pol-
icy from Harvard University. 
I am forever indebted to Dr. Tom for 
his unyielding devotion to my growth 
and the success of my peers. He was al-
ways there for us. He was always there 
to motivate us, to celebrate us, and to 
give us a smile when we needed it 
most. 
He gave us a family, a familia, in 
which 
we 
found 
reassurance 
and 
strength. All IEFLP graduates share a 
common bond because of him. To this 
day, when I meet a fellow Inland Em-
pire Future Leaders Program graduate, 
we reminisce about his kindness and 
grace. 
We said good-bye to Dr. Tom just last 
month, in March 2022. However, we 
know that his legacy will live on in 
each and every one of us. We know that 
his memory will survive in the hearts 
of his beloved wife, Dr. Lily; his broth-
er, Ray; his children, Evelyn, Patricia, 
and Tom; and all of his wonderful 
grandchildren. 
Together, we mourn his passing and 
celebrate his full life, knowing that he 
was a good man and an extraordinary 
public servant whose impact will be 
felt for generations to come.

RECOGNIZING THE LEGACY OF DR. 
TOM RIVERA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. AGUILAR) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to follow the words of my 
good friend, Dr. RAUL
RUIZ, as we 
honor this towering figure from our re-
gion, the Inland Empire. 
For more than 50 years, Dr. Rivera 
served our community as an educator, 
administrator, and community leader. 
His passing in March was felt by all of 
us, and it left too large of a void for 
just one of us to fill. 
Back in 1985, our region suffered. 
More than half of the Latino students 
in our region didn’t finish high school. 
While others ignored the problem, 
Dr. Tom rolled up his sleeves as an 
elected school board member, as a life-
long educator. He joined with commu-
nity leaders to form the Inland Empire 
Future Leaders Program to help these 
students stay in school. 
b 1030 
As a result, more than 99 percent of 
the students who go through this pro-
gram have graduated high school. 
Ninety percent have gone to college. 
Dr. Tom’s positive influence, his beliefs 
in what we could become if given the 
opportunity, helped shape doctors, law-
yers, teachers, and, yes, a couple Mem-
bers of Congress. 
Dr. Tom gave working-class kids like 
me a chance for a better life, for our-
selves and for our family, and he 
taught us that no matter where life 
takes us, never lose sight of our herit-
age and our culture, and always give 
back to our community. 
It is a testament to his unwavering 
faith in our young people that Dr. 
RAUL RUIZ and I are standing on the 
House floor today. I was proud to call 
Dr. Tom a mentor, a friend, and impor-
tantly, a constituent. He would always 
ask me how my grandmother was 
doing. He went to school on the south 
side of Colton with members of my 
family, and he always took the time to 
ask how they were doing, what they 
were up to, how he could help them. 
My thoughts go out to his wife, Dr. 
Lily Rivera, his children, and grand-
children. 
Madam Speaker, now it is our re-
sponsibility, those of us in roles of 
making policy, those of us in our com-
munities who strive to make our com-
munity a better place, it is up to us to 
carry his legacy forward and to lift up 
the next generation of Latino leaders.

CONCERNS ABOUT KETANJI 
BROWN JACKSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK). The Chair rec-
ognizes the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. CLYDE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to emphasize my concern about 
President Biden’s U.S. Supreme Court 
nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, com-
monly known as KBJ, and to express 
my deep disappointment for any Sen-
ator that votes for her confirmation 
this week. 
While I do not have a vote on KBJ’s 
confirmation, I do have a voice. And I 
will continue using my voice to tell the 
American people the truth. 
The truth is that Ketanji Brown 
Jackson is incapable of holding crimi-
nals accountable. 
Throughout her career, Judge Jack-
son’s sentences have been drastically 
lower than the national average, even 
for individuals who have committed 
the most egregious crimes imaginable. 
When analyzing all criminal case 
sentencing imposed by U.S. District 
Courts, Judge Jackson issued signifi-
cantly lighter sentences, almost 34 per-
cent less than the national average. 
Specifically, the statistics reveal a 
more sinister pattern when broken 
down to child pornography and child 
sex torture cases. 
When sentencing criminals for pos-
session of child pornography, KBJ im-
posed sentences 57 percent less than 
the national average. Additionally, she 
issued sentences 47 percent less than 
the national average for those con-
victed of distributing these atrocious 
images of child sex torture. 
Disturbingly, child sex torture, one 
of the most heinous crimes of all, is 
met with compassion and concessions 
from Judge Jackson.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4197 
April 6, 2022 
In fact, here are some quotes from 
KBJ in the U.S. v. Hawkins cases in-
volving Mr. Hawkins, an 18-year-old 
adult man charged with downloading 
many images and videos of innocent 
children being tortured by sex offend-
ers. During this case KBJ said: ‘‘I feel 
so sorry for you’’—in reference to Mr. 
Hawkins himself—‘‘and for the anguish 
that this has caused all of you.’’ 
Judge Jackson feels sorry for the per-
petrator. Excuse me? What about the 
victims and the anguish that this tor-
ture has caused them? 
In addition, KBJ stated: ‘‘This seems 
to be a situation in which you were fas-
cinated by sexual images involving 
what were essentially your peers.’’ 
Peers? Really? 
The vile content Mr. Hawkins pos-
sessed depicted boys as young as 8 
years old. Mr. Hawkins was 18 at the 
time, over twice their age. 
Keep in mind, the sentencing guide-
lines called for up to 10 years in prison 
for Mr. Hawkins, yet Ketanji Brown 
Jackson sentenced this predator to just 
3 months in jail. Three months. 
Madam Speaker, we are not talking 
about someone who disobeyed traffic 
laws. This is a man convicted of pos-
sessing multiple images of child sex 
torture. 
This is sickening and wrong, plain 
and simple. 
It is not just Judge Jackson’s record 
that is worthy of outrage. Revelations 
from her recent testimony speak vol-
umes to KBJ’s interest in legislating 
from the bench. 
When asked to provide the definition 
for the word ‘‘woman,’’ KBJ absurdly 
said she could not, adding that she 
isn’t a biologist. 
Can you think of a more illogical ex-
cuse? The word ‘‘woman’’ is a term I 
am sure that most third graders can 
accurately describe with ease. 
By failing to define a woman, Judge 
Jackson has shown her true narrative 
to the American people, exposing her 
loyalty to the woke left. It is no secret 
that radical activists are waging a bi-
zarre and dangerous war on women. 
From women’s sports to large corpora-
tions, liberals are attempting to erase 
women while claiming to fight for 
women’s rights. 
So by refusing to define a woman, 
Judge Jackson has revealed that she 
both accepts and supports the left’s 
treacherous 
agenda. 
Furthermore, 
KBJ’s inability to accept and acknowl-
edge the differences between men and 
women raises serious doubt and ques-
tions about her ability to decide judi-
cial outcomes regarding sex, such as 
title IX cases. 
Bottom line, Ketanji Brown Jack-
son’s resistance to the realities that 
exist between men and women is deeply 
unsettling and proves that she will ad-
judicate with an agenda, an immoral 
agenda that is blatantly wrong for our 
country. 
In another disheartening display of 
her disqualifications, KBJ also refused 
to recognize Americans’ natural rights. 
From the founding of our great coun-
try, both our citizenry and our govern-
ment have acknowledged that we are 
provided unalienable rights by our cre-
ator. It is unconscionable that a nomi-
nee to our Nation’s highest court 
would reject this foundational prin-
ciple, and it is alarming that Senators 
will still ignore KBJ’s appalling testi-
mony and vote for her to serve our ju-
dicial system for life. 
Mark my words, Ketanji Brown Jack-
son’s refusal to acknowledge Ameri-
cans’ natural rights from God is a Tro-
jan horse for tyranny, presenting yet 
another glaring example of why she is 
unfit for the Supreme Court. 
We know she is soft on crime. We 
know she is a vessel for the woke left’s 
dangerous ideology. And we know she 
cannot definitively defend Americans’ 
God-given rights or precious freedoms. 
Yet, despite KBJ’s frightening record 
and recent testimony, the Senate in-
tends to vote on her confirmation to 
the Supreme Court this week. 
If KBJ becomes a Supreme Court 
Justice, she will serve for decades, so-
lidifying and strengthening the left’s 
menacing grip on our rule of law. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. CLYDE. Her decisions will im-
pact future Americans for generations 
to come, setting precedent that will ul-
timately guide our great Nation once 
you and I are long gone. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. CLYDE. Without question, Amer-
icans from Maine, Utah to Alaska, 
from sea to shining sea, are watching 
intently, praying their Senators’ vote 
will represent—— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is no longer recognized.

JUDGE JACKSON DESERVES 
CONFIRMATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. STRICKLAND) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, 
I stand before you to talk about two 
topics: The confirmation of Judge 
Jackson, as well as the Restaurant Re-
vitalization Fund. 
Judge Jackson is more qualified than 
the people with whom she will serve, 
and she is not soft on crime. It is why 
she has the endorsement of the Fra-
ternal Order of Police and the Inter-
national Association of Police Chiefs, 
hardly the radical left. 
As we look at the opportunity to 
make history, we want to make sure 
that our Supreme Court is representa-
tive and reflective of our entire Nation. 
Judge Jackson deserves confirma-
tion. She has earned it, and she will be 
someone that we are proud to have on 
the Supreme Court. 
RESTAURANT RELIEF 
Ms. STRICKLAND. Madam Speaker, 
this week is one to celebrate. After al-
most a year of bipartisan, bicameral 
negotiations, the House will finally 
take up legislation to replenish the 
Restaurant Revitalization Fund and 
move us one step closer to getting 
much-needed 
relief 
for 
restaurants 
across the finish line. 
The funds provided by Congress in 
2021 were a lifeline for so many busi-
nesses in Washington State and across 
our Nation. Restaurants were hit espe-
cially hard by highly transmissible 
COVID–19 variants, staffing shortages, 
supply chain issues, and inflation, 
which only added to the existing chal-
lenges 
and 
long-term 
effects 
that 
brought many to the brink of closing 
their doors for good. 
Restaurants have lost 2 years’ worth 
of revenue, and it will take them years 
to recover and repay their debts. In 
fact, in Washington State alone, the 
average full-service restaurant reports 
being $160,000 in debt, and it would 
take them over 3 years to repay it. 
I know how critical this second round 
of funding is because I regularly hear 
about it from my constituents. The 
south Puget Sound of Washington 
State is the proud home of so many 
small, 
local 
restaurants, 
including 
Vien Dong in the Lincoln International 
District and Budd Bay Cafe in Olympia, 
to name a few. 
Many businesses are still struggling 
to get back on their feet, and most 
were shut out from ever receiving relief 
in the first place. 
That is why on February 10, I led the 
Washington State delegation in send-
ing a letter to congressional leadership 
urging them to replenish the Res-
taurant Revitalization Fund and help 
these employers and employees in need 
as soon as possible. 
These businesses are often neighbor-
hood anchors and family-owned. They 
are often owned by women, veterans, 
minorities, and immigrants. They are a 
critical part of the south Sound and 
Washington State’s economy. We must 
do everything we can to support them 
and push for an equitable and inclusive 
recovery.

FARMERS FACE ENORMOUS AND 
IMMEDIATE CHALLENGES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss 
the full Agriculture Committee hear-
ing that we held on March 16, the focus 
of which was the 2018 farm bill and the 
role of climate change. 
Recently, The New York Times wrote 
a series of stories and produced several 
videos denigrating rural Americans for 
providing the country with the safest, 
most abundant, and most affordable 
food supply in the history of the world. 
Let’s set the record straight. U.S. ag-
riculture accounts for less than 10 per-
cent of greenhouse gas emissions, and 
that is according to the Environmental 
Protection Agency. Over the last 70

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4198 
April 6, 2022 
years, U.S. agriculture has tripled food 
and fiber production while usage of 
land, energy, fertilizer and other inputs 
has remained steady. 
Early in the first session of this Con-
gress, several of my Republican col-
leagues and I introduced a slate of cli-
mate-friendly and farmer-focused bills. 
These bills are driven by commonsense 
solutions to benefit our environment 
and our farm industry. 
Our farmers, ranchers, foresters, and 
producers are the original climate 
champions. While there is more to be 
done, we must prevent efforts to fun-
damentally upend our commodity, con-
servation, and crop insurance programs 
to appease Washington think tanks. We 
must also reject complicating our pro-
grams and making climate the focus of 
every title of the upcoming farm bill 
reauthorization. 
Madam Speaker, under the umbrella 
of natural land solutions, which in-
cludes farmers that grow crops, live-
stock, and our foresters, the research 
has shown that at this moment, based 
on the technology they use, they are 
responsible 
for 
sequestering 
6.1 
gigatons of carbon annually, green-
house gas emissions. 
To put that into perspective, that 
takes care of all the greenhouse gas 
emissions that are emitted on those 
lands, plus sequestering an additional 
10.1 percent. So truly, the American 
farmer, rancher, and forester are the 
climate change champions anywhere in 
the world because of our science, tech-
nology, and innovation. 
We must ensure agriculture produc-
tion remains viable in rural America to 
keep production from increasing in 
areas of the world with lower environ-
mental standards, worse labor condi-
tions, and fewer food safety consider-
ations. And that is why a robust safety 
net is critical to keeping farms and 
production here in the United States 
while lowering overall global green-
house gas emissions. 
Madam Speaker, our country and our 
farmers face enormous and immediate 
challenges including higher food prices, 
record inflation, and input costs, at-
tacks on our energy independence, 
crop-protection tools, and dependable 
labor. 
Now, these are the issues I hear 
about as I travel my district and the 
country. These are the issues we should 
be addressing. 
I hope at the end of the day we recog-
nize that our voluntary, locally led, in-
centive-based conservation system is 
working as intended, and that we must 
not undermine its continued success in 
supporting the environment and pro-
ducers. 
American 
agriculture 
is 
science. 
American agriculture is technology. 
And American agriculture is innova-
tion. The demands of a 21st century 
farm economy, and economically via-
ble climate solutions, depend on tools 
and policies that continue to unleash 
and increase the United States agri-
culture productivity. 
VIRGIN ISLANDS HISTORY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
STANTON). The Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands 
(Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, the 
Virgin Islands and its people speak of 
great resilience. We are a people rich in 
history and agriculture, struggles and 
triumphs in the face of disenfranchise-
ment. 
March 31, 2022, marked 104 years that 
the Virgin Islands of the United States 
have been part of the United States. 
Our islands were acquired by the 
United States in the costliest per-acre 
sale in U.S. land purchase. We became 
the most easterly point of the United 
States, and served to protect the Carib-
bean Basin and the Panama Canal, par-
ticularly during World War I. 
The sale of the Danish West Indies 
pulled Denmark out of depression and 
gave them the capital resources, gold 
bullion, necessary for them to become 
the happiest country that we know 
today. The brutal slavery and serf sys-
tem that they inflicted on my ances-
tors, however, was not a happy time. 
During the transfer of ceremonies on 
March 31, 1917, the people of the Virgin 
Islands, my people, were citizens of no 
country. All four of my grandparents 
were alive and living on the island of 
St. Croix at the time of the transfer. 
Only qualified Danish citizens living 
in Denmark were able to vote in the 
plebiscite. 
b 1045 
Of my eight great-grandparents, I be-
lieve one may have met the land and 
income requirement mandatory to be 
able to vote. Only one would have been 
able to vote for his destiny. 
And after the purchase, those living 
in the territory, my grandparents, 
great-grandparents, aunts, uncles, my 
family, were citizens of no country, no-
where, for 10 years. 
Yet, after becoming citizens, Virgin 
Islanders came immediately to Wash-
ington and petitioned, pleaded to be 
part of the draft. You see, Virgin Is-
landers, like the other territories, 
serve and give the ultimate sacrifice in 
far greater number per capita than 
those Americans on the mainland. We 
wanted and still are willing to take on 
the responsibility, not just the privi-
lege. 
Until the United States began owner-
ship of territories, largely comprised of 
minority, Black and Brown people, dis-
enfranchisement of territories was a 
temporary condition. From the 1787 
Northwest Ordinance until the acquisi-
tion of Puerto Rico, lands were deemed 
territories with the expectation that 
they would become States. 
The disenfranchisement and unequal 
treatment of people in the Virgin Is-
lands are de jure law. The Insular Cases 
decided at the turn of the century in 
the Plessy v. Ferguson-era by the Su-
preme Court, established a doctrine of 
separate and unequal status for over-
seas territories. 
However, the disenfranchisement and 
unequal treatment continues today 
through court cases in the Bush, 
Obama, Trump, and now Biden admin-
istration, through their oral and writ-
ten arguments to the Supreme Court, 
as well as my own colleagues, Con-
gress’ unwillingness to grant equal 
treatment requests made by represent-
atives from the territories. 
My fight in Washington has been to 
level and create equity, to counter the 
many ways that such disenfranchise-
ment affects our lives, Federal funding, 
healthcare access, veterans’ benefits, 
structural damage after natural disas-
ters due to longstanding unequitable 
funding. 
It is my deepest honor to be grounded 
by my history, my parents, and my an-
cestors from the Virgin Islands, many 
of whom have played an integral role 
in the history of this Nation, long even 
before we were a part of this country; 
from Denmark Vesey, leader of the 
Charleston, South Carolina, slave re-
volt; David Levy Yulee, the first Jew-
ish Senator in the United States; Wil-
liam Leidesdorff, the founder of San 
Francisco; Edward Wilmot Blyden, one 
of the founders of Liberia; even today, 
my predecessor, the first female physi-
cian of this body as a Member of Con-
gress, Donna Christensen; and even 
this weekend, NCAA Women’s Basket-
ball Champion, Aliyah Boston. 
Our contributions to this Nation are 
undisputed, and 104 years after our 
transfer from Denmark to the U.S. pos-
session, our claim to full and inviolable 
rights as citizens of this country are 
long overdue. 
f 
COMMUNITY PROJECT FUNDING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a 
proud Member to support the 13th Con-
gressional District. 
My district is the third poorest Con-
gressional District in the country, and 
direct funding and aid to support our 
most vulnerable communities is so 
critical to communities like mine. 
I want to take a moment to uplift 
the work that my team and I have done 
to deliver for our residents through the 
community projects funding. 
I don’t know if folks know, but we 
have the oldest Boys and Girls Club in 
the Nation, and they are going to see $2 
million in investments to improve the 
facility in Highland Park so more of 
our young people can come into a 
building that is safe and a building 
that is going to be able to help them 
thrive. 
Also, the Urban Neighborhoods Ini-
tiative’s Southwest Detroit Creative 
Connections Collaborative; they are 
going to be able to create a safe space, 
community space for our families, es-
pecially our youth. This is the commu-
nity I grew up in, with 20 different 
ethnicities.

We are also going to be able to help 
Detroit homeowners receive home re-
pair grants for energy efficiency. En-
terprise Community Partners is so 
eager to be able to work with my sea-
soned residents; and my seasoned resi-
dents are eager to see their homes be-
come not only energy efficient, but 
also accessible, as many are struggling 
with access because of disability. 
The Eastside Community Network is 
going to be able to establish the 
Stoudamire Wellness HUB for the 
eastside Detroit residents who are, 
right 
now, 
struggling 
to 
access 
healthcare. 
We are also going to be able to help, 
some relief—and this is just the begin-
ning—to help many of our families in 
Dearborn Heights and Wayne County 
address the number of families that 
continue to be impacted by flooding be-
cause of Ecorse Creek’s challenges. 
We are also going to be able to sup-
port ProsperUS Detroit Micro Lending 
to support some of our small businesses 
and expand some of the work they have 
already done to Detroit all the way to 
western Wayne and Inkster. 
I am also so proud of the investment 
that we are going to have in the Ruth 
Ellis Center to provide safe, affordable, 
identity-affirming 
housing 
for 
marginalized Black and Brown Detroit-
ers, especially my LGBTQ-plus youth. 
I am also going to be able to stand 
there with my City of Wayne residents 
to see, finally, the Goudy Park Amphi-
theater space be able to be rehabbed. It 
is a space that many of our schools use 
for graduations, for gatherings, and 
just really truly coming together as a 
community. 
We are also going to be able to see 
over 300 of our high school students in 
the Western Wayne School District, 
along with the partnership of SEMCA, 
be able to access vocational tech-
nology, career-tech programs. 
We are also going to see a $2.5 million 
investment 
in 
our 
Inkster

to 
thank 
Chairwoman 
DELAURO and the Appropriations Com-
mittee staff, and the incredible hard 
work of my team, for a thoughtful and 
engaging process that really targeted 
communities with the most needs. 
I am proud and committed to contin-

f 
AFFORDABLE INSULIN NOW 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the incredible impact 
the bipartisan Affordable Insulin Now 
Act will have on Americans across the 
Nation. 
It is no secret diabetes poses a major 
health burden to Americans across our 
country. Texas, in particular, suffers 
greatly from the effects of type 2 diabe-
tes. Every day, new Texans are diag-
nosed. On top of that, the rate of new 
cases increases every single year. 
This topic, Mr. Speaker, hits very 
close to home. I have seen firsthand 
the hurdles diabetes creates for fami-
lies simply looking to live a quiet life 
and be alone and have a good, produc-
tive life. In my family, my mother 
faced uphill health battles because of 
diabetes most of her adult life. She 
died eventually of diabetes complica-
tions. 
Diabetes runs in my family. In fact, 
my doctor tells me that no matter 
what I do, I may end up getting diabe-
tes. I am one of 10 children. Five of us 
have already gotten diabetes and are 
dependent on insulin. 
Sadly, this epidemic disproportion-
ately impacts older adults, especially 
Latinos, minorities, and populations 
with lower levels of education. It re-
mains one of the leading causes of 
death in Texas and the United States. 
In my own home county of Harris 
County, diabetes is the fifth leading 
cause of death. 
Even when purchased through Medi-
care, insulin is more than three times 
as expensive in the United States than 
in the U.K. The bipartisan Affordable 
Insulin Now Act is truly needed to save 
lives. 
The Affordable Insulin Now Act caps 
insulin copays at $35 per month or 25 
percent of an insurance plan’s nego-
tiated price, whichever is lower. It is a 
great first step, and it will save lives. 
But more must be done. 
You see, Mr. Speaker, Americans 
without health insurance will not ben-
efit from this bill. This will help those 
residents who are fortunate to already 
have health insurance, and we welcome 
this support. Again, it is a great first 
step. But much more is very needed. 
Texas is the State with the highest 
rate of uninsured individuals and, in 
my district, 33 percent of the residents 
in my district do not have health in-
surance. 
In fact, Mr. Speaker, my district has 
the highest number of uninsured people 
than in any other district in the Na-
tion. To make matters worse, diabetes 
is highly concentrated in east Texas, 
the area where I live. It pains me that 
these folks were not included in the 
bill. 
The immense health and emotional 
challenges diabetes brings to house-
holds are burdensome enough; but its 
economic strain is ruthless to families 
not fortunate enough to have insur-
ance. 
Because of corporate greed and com-
panies focused only on profits, Texans 
without medical insurance face astro-
nomical prices for insulin. In short, 
people with diabetes have medical ex-
penses approximately 2.3 times higher 
than those who do not have diabetes. 
The 
out-of-pocket 
costs 
for 
healthcare and insulin have crippled 
hardworking 
Americans 
across 
our 
country. It has gotten so bad that one 
in four people have rationed, rationed 
lifesaving insulin because they could 
not afford proper dosage amounts. This 
is unacceptable and wrong, and we 
must do better. 
No one—I repeat, no one—should 
have to gamble with their health by ra-
tioning insulin to make ends meet. The 
bipartisan Affordable Insulin Now Act 
will save lives, and it is a great step 
forward. But I will continue fighting 
for residents across my district who do 
not currently have health insurance 
but do need insulin. We will continue 
to fight until we get it done.

STOP MASS SHOOTINGS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. DEUTCH) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, a re-
cently released Violence Project study 
has found that more than half of all 
mass shootings between 1966 and 2019 
occurred since 2000. There have been 
more and more shootings. It is getting 
worse and worse. Mass shootings have 
occurred in the workplace, on college 
campuses, in our houses of worship, 
and in our schools. We must do better. 
These shootings cut off young lives 
and devastate families. We owe it to 
the victims to do more to combat gun 
violence in our communities. We owe it 
to Joaquin Oliver. 
Joaquin was 17 years old when he was 
shot and killed with an assault rifle at 
Marjory 
Stoneman 
Douglas 
High 
School in Parkland, Florida. This is 
Joaquin. 
But this symbol of Joaquin is also an 
assault rifle. You see, this is an assault 
rifle that was purchased by Joaquin’s 
dad, Manny, without a background 
check. 
Manny went to a gun show in Florida 
and bought a high-powered rifle with-
out a background check. Then he went 
home, and he melted it down to make 
this statue of his son, who was killed 
by a similar weapon in his school on 
Valentine’s Day. 
This statue of Joaquin is now a pow-
erful reminder of our weak gun laws 
and the countless American lives that 
have been stolen, families broken by 
gun violence. 
When Manny went to a gun show, the 
seller pushed him to buy the rifle, to 
buy ammunition, to buy a high-capac-
ity magazine, all at one time, without 
a background check. And Manny won-
dered, what’s the rush? 
What is the rush? Why does anyone 
need a deadly arsenal in one afternoon, 
with no questions asked? 
We have put a lot of effort into mak-
ing background checks work well for 
legal gun buyers. The National Instant 
Criminal 
Background 
System, 
the 
NICS system, returns results in as fast 
as 30 seconds. 
Every gun buyer at a gun show, every 
gun buyer online, every gun buyer at a 
licensed dealer, every gun buyer should

go through that system to keep our 
communities safe. But they don’t be-
cause of a dangerous loophole like the 
one that allowed Manny to buy an AR– 
15 at a gun show without a background 
check. 
b 1100 
The background check system is the 
foundation of gun safety in America. 
When that foundation is weak, like it 
is today, it makes all of us less safe. 
We 
need 
universal 
background 
checks. States with laws requiring 
background checks on all sales have 
lower gun homicide rates than States 
that don’t. Guns from States that lack 
background check laws often end up re-
covered from crime scenes in neigh-
boring States without those tough 
laws. 
That is why we need a uniform na-
tional requirement to end weak gun 
laws that contribute to trafficking. 
The President visited New York City 
recently after two police officers were 
fatally shot, and he urged the need for 
universal background checks. He right-
ly said our country needs a comprehen-
sive strategy to dramatically reduce 
gun violence. The Attorney General of 
the United States has directed U.S. at-
torneys to confront gun trafficking 
across State lines and in cities. 
I strongly support the President’s 
call for a comprehensive strategy. As 
part of that strategy, Congress should 
do what many States are currently 
working on to ban untraceable ghost 
guns, similar to the law that was 
signed in New York in October of last 
year. Congress can do this. 
Congress should also pass safe stor-
age legislation to protect kids from 
being harmed by loaded weapons kept 
unsafely in their homes. We should ban 
weapons of war that don’t belong in our 
community and are regularly used to 
hunt innocent people. Who needs to be 
able to fire off 50 or 100 rounds at a 
time? 
Congress should recognize that high- 
capacity magazines have no place in 
our communities and that their only 
purpose is to make it easy to cause 
mass casualties. 
These proposals have significant sup-
port. Ninety percent of Americans, in-
cluding gun owners, want universal and 
stronger background checks. 
Would a stronger background check 
system prevent every instance of gun 
violence? No, of course not. Would end-
ing large-capacity ammunition maga-
zines prevent mass casualties caused 
by guns? No, but they will make us 
safer. They will make our communities 
safer. They will make our schools 
safer. They will make the workplace 
safer. They will make people feel safer 
as they attend religious services. They 
will make it easier for law enforcement 
to do their jobs safely every day. 
Continued inaction on confronting 
gun violence will only lead to more in-
nocent people dying from firearms. 
Congress must take action to get 
strong gun violence prevention legisla-
tion for Joaquin and the 16 others who 
were taken at Stoneman Douglas, for 
their families, and for America.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
PRIVATE ANDREW LADNER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. PALAZZO) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the homecoming of 
World War II Private Andrew Ladner, 
whose remains finally came home 80 
years after being killed in action. 
Private Ladner was assigned to the 
126th Infantry Regiment, 32nd Infantry 
Division. On November 30, 1942, during 
a blockade to prevent a Japanese as-
sault on the island of New Guinea, he 
was killed during the initial wave and 
was reportedly buried 26 yards west of 
the road the unit was blockading. 
After the war, his remains could not 
be found and eventually were declared 
nonrecoverable. However, between a 
little luck and the never-quit Army at-
titude and exhaustive research, they 
located his remains in 2016. 
Now Private Ladner can be laid to 
rest in a way he deserves. I know his 
family takes comfort in his example of 
a life well lived and the legacy he left 
behind all those years ago. 
Private Ladner was part of the 
Greatest Generation of Americans. His 
family can find solace in knowing his 
legacy will never die but lives on with 
every American who puts on the uni-
form of the United States military. 
On behalf of the Fourth Congres-
sional District of Mississippi, we honor 
the memory of Private Andrew Ladner, 
who gave his life for his family and the 
country he so dearly loved. 
Private Ladner, may you rest in 
peace. God bless you, and Semper 
Fidelis.

MAKING HEALTHCARE MORE AF-
FORDABLE 
AND 
ACCESSIBLE 
THAN EVER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK) 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to applaud President 
Joe Biden’s executive order to bring 
down the cost of health insurance and 
expand health coverage. The executive 
order represents the most significant 
action to strengthen the Affordable 
Care Act since it was signed into law. 
Consistent with the administration’s 
mission, my colleagues and I in Con-
gress voted in favor of the Affordable 
Insulin Now Act, which will lower costs 
for hardworking families by capping 
the out-of-pocket costs for insulin at 
$35 per month. 
President Biden’s executive order de-
livers a longstanding Democratic pri-
ority for strengthening the Affordable 
Care Act and fixing the so-called fam-
ily glitch. Without this step, current 
regulations 
define 
employer-based 
health insurance as affordable if the 
coverage is provided solely for the em-
ployee and not for family members. 
For family members of an employee 
offered health coverage through an em-
ployer, the cost for that family cov-
erage can sometimes be very expensive 
and make health insurance out of 
reach. The family glitch affects 5 mil-
lion people and has made it impossible 
for many families to use the premium 
tax credit to purchase an affordable, 
high-quality marketplace plan. 
Fixing the family glitch builds on 
several steps Democrats have taken to 
lower health costs and build on the Af-
fordable Care Act, including the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, which was signed 
into law last year. The American Res-
cue Plan is saving families an average 
of $2,400 in annual premiums and has 
helped enroll 14.5 million Americans in 
marketplace plans. 
Thanks to Democratic leadership, 
healthcare is more affordable and ac-
cessible than ever. Our American Res-
cue Plan dramatically lowered the cost 
of marketplace plans and helped enroll 
millions of Floridians into quality, af-
fordable coverage. 
As House Democrats fight to build a 
better America for all people, I will 
continue to work to lower healthcare 
costs and prescription drug prices for 
all Floridian families.

The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

everything from the wars that rage 
around the world and into the recesses 
of each heart. Everything is uncovered 
and laid bare before Your eyes that all 
must give account. 
Call to account, then, the wicked and 
the good. Unspeakable atrocities have 
taken place throughout Ukraine. Bring 
to justice those who have failed to 
demonstrate any evidence of human de-
cency. Bring to Your court those who 
have disregarded the precious life of 
the innocent.

noble, and give success to their efforts 
to shield and shelter the displaced and

SUPPORTING BIPARTISAN SUPPLY 
CHAIN PROVISIONS 
(Mrs. DINGELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of the bi-
partisan supply chain provisions in-
cluded in the House-passed America 
COMPETES Act. 
Every day, we are hearing from our 
constituents about inflation and rising 
prices, and one critical factor contrib-
uting to these issues is continued dis-
ruptions in the domestic supply chain. 
The 
America 
COMPETES 
supply 
chain subtitle establishes an office of 
manufacturing security and resilience 
within the Department of Commerce to 
monitor, identify, map, and mitigate 
supply chain vulnerabilities. 
It also authorizes billions in grants 
and loans to support the manufac-
turing of critical goods, equipment, 
and cutting-edge technologies that are 
essential to our national and economic 
security. 
The investments included in the bi-
partisan America COMPETES supply 
chain subtitle will allow us to preempt 
future shocks to our supply chain, and 
we must be proactive in strengthening 
our manufacturing capacity to secure 
our future. 
I hope that this critical subtitle re-
mains in the bill and is retained in any 
final package the conference process 
yields.

MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE 
A message from the Senate by Ms. 
Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that 
the Senate has passed without amend-
ment a bill of the House of the fol-
lowing title: 
H.R. 5681. An act to authorize the reclassi-
fication of the tactical enforcement officers 
(commonly known as the ‘‘Shadow Wolves’’) 
in the Homeland Security Investigations tac-
tical patrol unit operating on the lands of 
the Tohono O’odham Nation as special 
agents, and for other purposes. 
The message also announced that the 
Senate has passed a bill of the fol-
lowing title in which the concurrence 
of the House is requested: 
S. 2123. An act to establish the Federal 
Clearinghouse on Safety and Security Best 
Practices for Faith-Based Organizations and 
Houses of Worship, and for other purposes.

SUPPORTING SOUTH CAROLINA 
EXPORT SALES 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I am grateful to report that 
the total export sales from the State of 
South Carolina topped nearly $30 bil-
lion last year. 
Increasing their influence, State ex-
porters reached over 195 countries, 
with Germany and Canada tops. Ko-
rean investments are monumental by 
Samsung, and I praise today the Ko-
rean delegation of Dr. Jin Park and 
Tae-yong Cho. 
Most notably, the Palmetto State 
leads the Nation in export sales of tires 
produced by Michelin, Bridgestone, 
Giti Tire, Continental, and Trelleborg 
Wheel Systems. 
South Carolina also leads in pas-
senger motor vehicle exports, including 
BMW, Volvo Cars, Honda, and Mer-
cedes-Benz Vans. 
In order to further support this vital 
market, South Carolina ports have in-
vested over $2 billion in infrastructure, 
according to South Carolina Port Au-
thority President Jim Newsome, soon 
to be succeeded by COO Barbara Mel-
vin, backed up by Governor Henry 
McMaster. 
In conclusion, God bless Ukraine. 
God 
save 
Ukraine. 
God 
bless 
Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he fights to 
maintain his freedom for all the people 
of the world. 
f 
SUPPORTING THE AMERICA 
COMPETES ACT 
(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, for gen-
erations, America’s innovations, from 
electricity to automobiles, robotics to 
plastics, have shaped the course of his-
tory. 
We prevailed because we were pre-
eminent in our investments in science, 
research, and technology. 
But today, America’s preeminence is 
being challenged. Other countries have 
followed our lead in research, science, 
and technology. 
As a result, more of the technology 
that we are relying on today is made 
abroad, driving up the cost at home, 
contributing to inflation, threatening 
our workers’ financial security and 
their jobs, and eroding our Nation’s 
competitiveness. 
That is why Chairwoman EDDIE BER-
NICE JOHNSON and the Committee on 
Science, Space, and Technology, along 
with 13 other committees of the House, 
crafted a data-driven, results-oriented 
package to help our Nation meet and 
win in the 21st century. 
I associate myself with the remarks 
of the gentlewoman from Michigan in 
support of the COMPETES Act. The 
House America COMPETES Act is pre-
cisely what is needed to ensure Amer-
ica’s might in manufacturing and inno-
vation while creating good-paying jobs 
and lowering costs for our Nation. 
Our bill helps bring manufacturing 
back to our shores, including $52 bil-
lion for chips, which are crucial for 
making cars, cell phones, and more. 
Our bill will help reinvigorate Amer-
ica’s industry, securing $45 billion to 
strengthen our supply chain, reduce de-
pendence on foreign nations, and lower 
costs. 
Our bill invests in research and edu-
cation so that we diversify our STEM 
workforce with apprenticeships and the 
rest. 
And our bill will promote U.S. global 
leadership. 
In the spirit of patriotism and unity, 
the House will champion these prior-
ities when we go to conference to craft 
a bold, bipartisan, bicameral package 
to send to the President’s desk. 
I hope that we will have the oppor-
tunity to go to conference soon. We are 
waiting for the signal from the Senate.

LEAVE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM 
RESERVE FOR WARTIME 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, our 
strategic oil reserves are meant to be 
for emergency use, an emergency re-
source in time of war or other disaster. 
At such an uncertain time that we 
have, with Eastern Europe embroiled 
in a big conflict, it would be wise for us 
to keep the reserve full. 
Indeed, President Trump filled the 
reserve up at the time when prices 
were low on fuel. Now, President Biden 
thinks that by releasing this oil, it is 
going to somehow affect the price of oil

around the world and our own econ-
omy. It is not. 
So far, 80 million barrels have al-
ready been released, but it hasn’t driv-
en down prices. Instead, the reserves 
we have in the ground that oil people 
can produce for us are the things that 
are going to change oil prices, not tap-
ping into our reserves. 
There is only going to be a few days’ 
worth to run the country on, or bleed-
ing it out over 180 days, 1 million bar-
rels at a time. 
Tap into our energy we have so abun-
dantly in this country. That will affect 
the market for us, for our allies in Eu-
rope, and actually truly make a big dif-
ference, instead of playing this little 
game with our oil reserves that doesn’t 
do anything other than look like we 
are doing something. 
Let’s get back to work on putting 
Americans to work and our energy de-
pendability on us and not on others. I 
ask the President to change directions 
on this policy.

PUTIN IS DESTABILIZING THE 
WORLD ECONOMY AND ORDER 
(Ms. HOULAHAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Mr. Speaker, last 
week, I held an in-person townhall to 
hear how inflation impacts our commu-
nity. Too many Pennsylvanians are 
making tough choices to put food on 
the table, gas in their tanks, and other 
budgetary choices. 
Today, I rise to discuss why con-
fronting Putin abroad helps address in-
flation issues here at home. 
It is no secret that we live in a global 
market. We became acutely aware of 
that fact during the pandemic. Ukraine 
and Russia provide us, and the world, 
grain, oil, gas, and even things like fer-
tilizer. 
When we are at war in these areas or 
people are at war in these areas, this 
impacts our economy colossally. We 
are again seeing how connected we are, 
this time not from a global disease but, 
rather, from a diseased man. 
Vladimir Putin is infected, and he is 
inflicting untold horrors on the people 
of Ukraine and simultaneously desta-
bilizing our world economy and order. 
To fully address these rising costs 
and inflation in part caused by this 
Russian war, our top priority has to be 
bringing a just, durable, and lasting 
peace to this conflict in Ukraine. 
The longer the war rages on, the 
longer it will take for our economy to 
recover. That is why we must impose 
strong sanctions against Russia, co-
ordinated with our allies; we must ex-
pedite weaponry to Ukraine; and we 
must return to prepandemic domestic 
oil production levels to meet our do-
mestic needs and to help bring down 
global market costs. 
For the people of the Sixth Congres-
sional 
District 
of 
Pennsylvania, 
I 
promise to keep doing everything in 
my power to make sure we can allevi-
ate pressures that are felt at home 
from abroad.

RECOGNIZING CHRIS DELESANDRI 
(Mr. WEBER of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize and congratu-
late Mr. Chris Delesandri on his retire-
ment after a dedicated 41 years of serv-
ice with United Way of Galveston 
County Mainland, where he served as 
the executive director for the past 10 
years. 
Not only did Chris serve Galveston 
County during his time with United 
Way, but Chris has also served as the 
president of the Rotary Club of Texas 
City. He was elected to the Roll of 
Fame for Rotary District 5910 and 
earned the Rotary Youth Leadership 
Awards volunteer. 
Chris always prioritized giving back 
to his community, and as such, he has 
earned several awards through the 
Chamber of Commerce, such as Citizen 
of the Year in 2008 and the Leslie 
Hayley Community Service Award in 
2014. 
I commend Chris for his numerous 
accomplishments and his dedicated 
service to our district and congratulate 
him on his retirement. I am so glad to 
represent him and call him a friend. He 
deserves a great retirement. 
Have a good one, buddy.

DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO DRIVE 
STABILITY 
AND 
GROWTH 
IN 
SMALL BUSINESSES 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. 
PLASKETT. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank my colleagues for all the good 
work that they have done to support 
American small businesses during the 
pandemic. 
Democrats working with President 
Biden have helped businesses to keep 
their lights on and employees on pay-
roll. 
Biden’s plan has enabled a remark-
able rebound in small business activity 
with small business demand for labor 
and inventory near record high. 
The share of small businesses that 
have created new jobs in the first quar-
ter of this year is higher than at any 
point in the Trump administration. 
Democrats are continuing to drive 
stability and growth in small busi-
nesses. H.R. 3807 is in furtherance of 
that. The bill provides $13 billion to es-
tablish a Hard Hit Industry’s Award 
Program to provide awards to small 
businesses across all industries and 
sectors that were hardest hit by the 
pandemic, regardless of industry or 
business. 
My colleagues and I are proposing so-
lutions focused on assisting small busi-
nesses, the true engine of our Nation’s 
economy, to rebuild and help our econ-
omy be better than before.

CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I have visited our southern border 
three times since I have been in office, 
and the crisis is only getting worse. 
Not only have we seen the most ille-
gal crossings on record over the past 
year, but also fentanyl overdoses are 
the leading cause of death for Ameri-
cans ages 18 to 45, and the top source of 
fentanyl is the U.S.-Mexico border. 
The Biden administration’s decision 
to end title 42 without a plan will only 
worsen this crisis. 
It is past time to stop playing poli-
tics with border security. Federal law 
requires the Department of Homeland 
Security to create and implement a 
strategy to secure our northern border, 
but we currently don’t have one that 
addresses the southern border crisis. 
I 
introduced 
the 
Comprehensive 
Southern 
Border 
Strategy 
Act 
to 
change that and direct the Department 
of Homeland Security to create a strat-
egy to secure our U.S.-Mexico border. 
Our economic prosperity, national se-
curity, and public safety requires se-
cure borders.

DEMOCRATS ARE BUILDING A 
BETTER AMERICA 
(Mr. LIEU asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1

Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, President 
Joe Biden has done an awesome job 
creating jobs. He is a jobs President. 
Last year, 6.6 million jobs were cre-
ated. In the last 14 months working

from their jobs if they refuse to get 
vaccinated. Meanwhile, over 160,000 
unvaccinated 
and 
untested 
illegal 
aliens crossed our border last Feb-
ruary, the most on record in two dec-
ades. 
Now, Joe Biden and his Washington 
Democrat allies want to make a bad 
problem worse. Last week, President 
Biden eliminated President Trump’s 
title 42, which allows DHS to deport il-
legal aliens if they pose a public health 
danger to our citizens. In other words, 
according to Washington Democrats, 
they 
believe 
American 
healthcare 
workers, Federal employees, and serv-
icemembers deserve harsher treatment 
than those crossing our border ille-
gally. 
This is unacceptable. Title 42 must be 
reinstated immediately and kept in 
place until this administration comes 
up with a plan to deal with the border 
crisis created by the administration’s 
policies.

CELEBRATING MATHEMATICS AND 
STATISTICS AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. MCNERNEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the mathematical 
and statistical sciences. 
Fundamental 
research 
in 
mathe-
matics and statistics touches all of our 
Nation’s scientific and technological 
priorities and provides tools to address 
societal changes. 
As recent examples, mathematical 
scientists 
model 
the 
spread 
of 
pandemics and help assess the effec-
tiveness of vaccine programs. 
They produce research needed for ar-
tificial intelligence and help us under-
stand and predict dangerous weather 
patterns. 
And their theoretical work fortifies 
imaging technologies used to detect 
diseases, including cancer. 
We are at a critical time for building 
and ensuring a stable and more diverse 
STEM workforce in the future. 
Mathematics and statistics support 
all of the STEM disciplines and are 
critical to our educational system. 
Every day, mathematicians and stat-
isticians enable advances across all 
science and technology, making our 
Nation more secure and globally com-
petitive, and training the next genera-
tion of researchers and educators. 
Please join me and my fellow mathe-
maticians on the Joint Policy Board 
for Mathematics in celebrating April 
as Mathematics and Statistics Aware-
ness Month. 
f 
ECONOMIC PROSPERITY 
(Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to shed light on an im-
minent threat to our country’s recent 
economic prosperity. 
The Biden administration has cre-
ated jobs and increased our Nation’s 
GDP at unprecedented rates. 
From day one, the President’s eco-
nomic agenda has been about gener-
ating more growth and more innova-
tion by giving America’s middle class 
more opportunities and more financial 
security. 
However, oil companies are using the 
war between Russia and Ukraine as a 
pretext to engage in unlawful price 
gouging to rob American people of 
their hard-earned dollars. 
I applaud my colleagues for taking 
the necessary steps to address this con-
cern by facilitating oversight hearings 
to maintain the integrity of the oil in-
dustry and hold these companies ac-
countable 
for 
their 
unconscionable 
practices. 
Hopefully, 
these 
testimonies 
and 
hearings will lead to changes, and we 
can truly enjoy all the success of our 
current administration and keep dol-
lars in the pockets of the American 
people. 
f 
STANDING WITH BURMA 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 5497, the BURMA 
Act, which would provide badly needed 
resources to civil society actors in 
Burma and impose sanctions on the 
Burmese military for upending years of 
progress, democracy, and human rights 
for a self-serving and brutal agenda of 
repression and violence. 
Having visited Burma, I have seen 
the strength of its people as they have 
struggled to create and sustain democ-
racy. 
Now, 
under 
the 
authoritarian 
Tatmadaw, the divisions, prejudices, 
and violence have been exacerbated 
and progress has been reversed. 
The Rohingya and other vulnerable 
populations continue to be displaced 
and assaulted. Journalists are pur-
posely targeted for harassment and vi-
olence. 
The political opposition has faced un-
speakable violence and imprisonment. 
We must commit to holding those re-
sponsible for the collapse of democracy 
and human rights to account, and we 
must support those that are working in 
dangerous circumstances to reestablish 
the rule of law. 
As we continue to work against glob-
al authoritarianism and for democracy 
and human rights around the world, let 
us stand shoulder to shoulder with the 
people of Burma and their struggle for 
freedom.

RECOGNIZING 
CAMDEN 
CENTRAL 
SCHOOL DISTRICT TRACK AND 
FIELD TEAM 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize seven amazing stu-
dents from the Camden Central School 
District Track and Field team, who re-
cently traveled to Mayfield, Kentucky, 
during their February break to help 
residents after a devastating tornado 
ripped through the State 2 months ago. 
Led by Coach Phil Lucason, seven 
members of the team volunteered their 
time: Lizzy Lucason, Will Carver, Ryan 
Beaulac, Joe Doran, Nate Hurd, Ivy 
Murphy, and Dillon Melchoire. Inciden-
tally, Dillon made a special stop at the 
University of the Cumberlands in Ken-
tucky on the way back to sign a letter 
of intent to run track for them next 
year. But these students worked in a 
large distribution center helping hun-
dreds of residents per day, who were 
seeking food and other household sup-
plies. 
The students also spent time working 
alongside contractors who were re-
building the many buildings devastated 
by the storm. 
Their tireless efforts on behalf of 
those whom they had never met is a 
beautiful example of selfless service. 
The 22nd District is so incredibly 
honored to have these excellent stu-
dents representing us and showing just 
how willing our community is to help 
people in their greatest time of need. I 
thank them for their tremendous serv-
ice to our community. 
f 
REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE STATUS 
QUO 
(Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate 
House Democrats’ efforts to pass the 
Affordable Insulin Now Act, which 
would cap the cost of insulin at $35 a 
month. 
This bill will be a game changer for 
the Rio Grande Valley in south Texas 
and the country as a whole. We have 
the highest rates of diabetes in the 
country, and over 25 percent of the pop-
ulation is uninsured. 
The stark reality is that the sky-
rocketing cost of insulin is crushing 
south Texans and people across our 
country. 
One in four Americans who rely on 
insulin have been forced to ration or 
skip a dose or choose between buying 
groceries and filling prescription drugs. 
Pharmaceutical companies manufac-
ture insulin for less than $10 yet sell it 
to the American people for more than 
10 times that. 
I refuse to accept the status quo. 
This long-overdue legislation is an 
important step to lower healthcare 
costs for families and hold Big Pharma 
accountable. 
I urge my Senate colleagues to pass 
the Affordable Insulin Now Act and 
send it to the President’s desk to sign 
today.

TITLE I—MATTERS RELATING TO THE 
CONFLICT IN BURMA 
SEC. 101. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Since 1988, the United States policy of 
principled engagement has fostered positive 
democratic reforms in Burma, with elections 
in 2010, 2015, and 2020, helping to bring about 
the partial transition to civilian rule and 
with the latter 2 elections resulting in re-
sounding electoral victories for the National 
League for Democracy. 
(2) That democratic transition remained 
incomplete, with the military retaining sig-
nificant power and independence from civil-
ian control following the 2015 elections, in-
cluding through control of 25 percent of par-
liamentary seats, a de facto veto over con-
stitutional reform, authority over multiple 
government ministries, and the ability to op-
erate with impunity and no civilian over-
sight. 
(3) Despite some improvements with re-
spect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms beginning in 2010, and the estab-
lishment of a quasi-civilian government fol-
lowing credible elections in 2015, Burma’s 
military leaders have, since 2016, overseen an 
increase in restrictions to freedom of expres-
sion (including for members of the press), 
freedom of peaceful assembly, freedom of as-
sociation, and freedom of religion or belief. 
(4) On August 25, 2017, Burmese military 
and security forces launched a genocidal 
military campaign against Rohingya, result-
ing in a mass exodus of some 750,000 
Rohingya from Burma’s Rakhine State into 
Bangladesh, where they remain. The mili-
tary has since taken no steps to improve 
conditions for Rohingya still in Rakhine 
State, who remain at high risk of genocide 
and other atrocities, or to create conditions 
conducive 
to 
the 
voluntary 
return 
of 
Rohingya refugees and other internally dis-
placed persons (IDPs). 
(5) The Burmese military has also engaged 
in renewed violence with other ethnic minor-
ity groups across the country. The military 
has continued to commit atrocities in Chin, 
Kachin, Kayah, and Shan. Fighting in north-
ern Burma has forced more than 100,000 peo-
ple from their homes and into camps for in-
ternally displaced persons. The Burmese 
military continues to heavily proscribe hu-
manitarian and media access to conflict-af-
fected populations across the country. 
(6) With more nearly $470,000,000 in human-
itarian assistance in response to the crisis in 
fiscal year 2021, the United States is the 
largest humanitarian donor to populations 
in need as a result of conflicts in Burma. In 
May 2021, the United States announced near-
ly $155,000,000 in additional humanitarian as-
sistance 
to 
meet 
the 
urgent needs of 
Rohingya refugees and host communities in 
Bangladesh and people affected by ongoing 
violence in Burma’s Rakhine, Kachin, Shan, 
and Chin states. In September 2021, the 
United States provided nearly $180,000,000 in 
additional critical humanitarian assistance 
to the people of Burma, bringing the total 
fiscal year 2021 to more than $434,000,000. 
(7) Both government- and military-initi-
ated investigations into human rights abuses 
in Burma involving violence between ethnic 
minorities and Burmese security forces have 
failed to yield credible results or hold per-
petrators accountable. 
(8) In its report dated September 17, 2018, 
the 
United 
Nations 
Independent 
Inter-
national Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar 
concluded, on reasonable grounds, that the 
factors allowing inference of ‘‘genocidal in-
tent’’ are present with respect to the attacks 
against Rohingya in Rakhine State, and acts 
by Burmese security forces against Rohingya 
in Rakhine State and other ethnic minori-
ties in Kachin and Shan States amount to 
‘‘crimes 
against 
humanity’’ 
and 
‘‘war 
crimes’’. 
The 
Independent 
International 
Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar estab-
lished by the United Nations Human Rights 
Council recommended that the United Na-
tions Security Council ‘‘should ensure ac-
countability for crimes under international 
law committed in Myanmar, preferably by 
referring the situation to the International 
Criminal Court or alternatively by creating 
an ad hoc international criminal tribunal’’. 
The Mission also recommended the imposi-
tion of targeted economic sanctions, includ-
ing an arms embargo on Burma. 
(9) On December 13, 2018, the United States 
House of Representatives passed House Reso-
lution 1091 (115th Congress), which expressed 
the sense of the House that ‘‘the atrocities 
committed against the Rohingya by the Bur-
mese military and security forces since Au-
gust 2017 constitute crimes against human-
ity and genocide’’ and called upon the Sec-
retary of State to review the available evi-
dence and make a similar determination. 
(10) In a subsequent report dated August 5, 
2019, the United Nations Independent Inter-
national Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar 
found that the Burmese military’s economic 
interests ‘‘enable its conduct’’ and that it 
benefits from and supports extractive indus-
try businesses operating in conflict-affected 
areas in northern Burma, including natural 
resources, particularly oil and gas, minerals

April 6, 2022 
and gems and argued that ‘‘through control-
ling its own business empire, the Tatmadaw 
can evade the accountability and oversight 
that normally arise from civilian oversight 
of military budgets’’. The report called for 
the United Nations and individual govern-
ments to place targeted sanctions on all sen-
ior officials in the Burmese military as well 
as 
their 
economic 
interests, 
especially 
Myanma Economic Holdings Limited and 
Myanmar Economic Corporation. 
(11) On February 1, 2021, the Burmese mili-
tary conducted a coup d’e´tat, declaring a 
year-long state of emergency and detaining 
State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, Presi-
dent Win Myint, and dozens of other govern-
ment officials and elected members of par-
liament, thus derailing Burma’s transition 
to democracy and disregarding the will of 
the people of Burma as expressed in the No-
vember 2020 general elections, which were 
determined to be credible by international 
and national observers. 
(12) Following the coup, some ousted mem-
bers of parliament established the Com-
mittee 
Representing 
the 
Pyidaungsu 
Hluttaw, which subsequently released the 
Federal Democracy Charter in March 2021 
and established the National Unity Govern-
ment in April 2021. In June 2021, the National 
Unity Government included ethnic minori-
ties and women among its cabinet and re-
leased a policy paper outlining pledges to 
Rohingya and calling for ‘‘justice and rep-
arations’’ for the community. 
(13) Since the coup on February 1, 2021, the 
Burmese military has— 
(A) used lethal force on peaceful protestors 
on multiple occasions, killing more than 
1,500 people, including more than 100 chil-
dren; 
(B) detained more than 10,000 peaceful 
protestors, participants in the Civil Disobe-
dience Movement, labor leaders, government 
officials and elected members of parliament, 
members of the media, and others, according 
to the Assistance Association for Political 
Prisoners; 
(C) issued laws and directives used to fur-
ther impede fundamental freedoms, includ-
ing freedom of expression (including for 
members of the press), freedom of peaceful 
assembly, and freedom of association; and 
(D) imposed restrictions on the internet 
and telecommunications. 
(14) According to the UNHCR, more than 
440,000 people have been internally displaced 
since the coup, while an estimated 39,000 
have sought refuge in neighboring countries. 
Nevertheless, the Burmese military con-
tinues to block humanitarian assistance to 
populations in need. According to the World 
Health Organization, the military has car-
ried out more than 286 attacks on health 
care entities since the coup and killed at 
least 30 health workers. Dozens more have 
been arbitrarily detained, and hundreds have 
warrants out for their arrest. The military 
continued such attacks even as they inhib-
ited efforts to combat a devastating third 
wave of COVID–19. The brutality of the Bur-
mese military was on full display on March 
27, 2021, Armed Forces Day, when, after 
threatening on state television to shoot pro-
testers in the head, security forces killed 
more than 150 people. 
(15) The coup represents a continuation of 
a long pattern of violent and anti-demo-
cratic 
behavior 
by 
the 
military 
that 
stretches back decades, with the military 
having previously taken over Burma in 
coups d’e´tat in 1962 and 1988, and having ig-
nored the results of the 1990 elections, and a 
long history of violently repressing protest 
movements, including killing and impris-
oning thousands of peaceful protestors dur-
ing pro-democracy demonstrations in 1988 
and 2007. 
(16) On February 11, 2021, President Biden 
issued Executive Order 14014 in response to 
the 
coup 
d’e´tat, 
authorizing 
sanctions 
against the Burmese military, its economic 
interests, and other perpetrators of the coup. 
(17) Since the issuance of Executive Order 
14014, President Biden has taken several 
steps to impose costs on the Burmese mili-
tary and its leadership, including by desig-
nating or otherwise imposing targeted sanc-
tions with respect to— 
(A) multiple high-ranking individuals and 
their family members, including the Com-
mander-in-Chief of the Burmese military, 
Min Aung Hlaing, Burma’s Chief of Police, 
Than Hlaing, and the Bureau of Special Op-
erations commander, Lieutenant General 
Aung Soe, and over 35 other individuals; 
(B) state-owned and military controlled 
companies, including Myanma Economic 
Holdings Public Company, Ltd., Myanmar 
Economic Corporation, Ltd., Myanmar Eco-
nomic Holdings Ltd., Myanmar Ruby Enter-
prise, Myanmar Imperial Jade Co., Ltd., and 
Myanma Gems Enterprise; and 
(C) other corporate entities, Burmese mili-
tary units, and Burmese military entities, 
including the military regime’s State Ad-
ministrative Council. 
(18) The United States has also imple-
mented new restrictions on exports and reex-
ports to Burma pursuant to Executive Order 
14014; and 
(19) On April 24, 2021, the Association of 
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreed to 
a five-point consensus which called for an 
‘‘immediate cessation of violence’’, ‘‘con-
structive dialogue among all parties’’, the 
appointment of an ASEAN special envoy, the 
provision 
of 
humanitarian 
assistance 
through ASEAN’s AHA Centre, and a visit by 
the ASEAN special envoy to Burma. Except 
for the appointment of the Special Envoy in 
August 2021, the other elements of the 
ASEAN consensus remain unimplemented 
due to obstruction by the Burmese military. 
(20) On March 21, 2022, Secretary of State 
Antony Blinken announced that the United 
States had concluded that ‘‘members of the 
Burmese military committed genocide and 
crimes against humanity against Rohingya’’. 
SEC. 102. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to support genuine democracy, peace, 
and national reconciliation in Burma; 
(2) to pursue a strategy of calibrated en-
gagement, which is essential to support the 
establishment of a peaceful, prosperous, and 
democratic Burma that includes respect for 
the human rights of all individuals regard-
less of ethnicity and religion; 
(3) to seek the restoration to power of a ci-
vilian government that reflects the will of 
the people of Burma; 
(4) to support constitutional reforms that 
ensure civilian governance and oversight 
over the military; 
(5) to assist in the establishment of a fully 
democratic, civilian-led, inclusive, and rep-
resentative political system that includes 
free, fair, credible, and democratic elections 
in which all people of Burma, including all 
ethnic and religious minorities, can partici-
pate in the political process at all levels in-
cluding the right to vote and to run for 
elected office; 
(6) to support legal reforms that ensure 
protection for the civil and political rights 
of all individuals in Burma, including re-
forms to laws that criminalize the exercise 
of human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
and strengthening respect for and protection 
of human rights, including freedom of reli-
gion or belief; 
(7) to seek the unconditional release of all 
prisoners of conscience and political pris-
oners in Burma; 
(8) to strengthen Burma’s civilian govern-
mental institutions, including support for 
greater 
transparency 
and 
accountability 
once the military is no longer in power; 
(9) to empower and resource local commu-
nities, civil society organizations, and inde-

porate measures to enhance ethnic reconcili-
ation and national unity into its policy 
agenda; 
(E) assisting efforts by the relevant United

SEC. 205. SUPPORT FOR GREATER UNITED NA-
TIONS ACTION WITH RESPECT TO 
BURMA. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that—

has not taken adequate steps to condemn the 
February 1, 2021, coup in Burma, pressure the 
Burmese military to cease its violence 
against civilians, or secure the release of 
those unjustly detained; and 
(2) countries, such as the People’s Republic 
of China and the Russian Federation, that 
are directly or indirectly shielding the Bur-
mese military from international scrutiny 
and action, should be obliged to endure the 
reputational damage of doing so by taking 
public votes on resolutions related to Burma 
that apply greater pressure on the Burmese 
military to restore Burma to its democratic 
path. 
(3) The United Nations Secretariat and the 
United Nations Security Council should take 
concrete steps to address the coup and ongo-
ing crisis in Burma consistent with the UN 
General Assembly resolution 75/287, ‘‘The sit-
uation in Myanmar,’’ which was adopted on 
June 18, 2021.

against the people of Burma and release 
without preconditions the journalists, pro-

Burma; 
(3) pushing the United Nations and other 
United Nations authorities to cut off assist-

resentatives to the United Nations and 
United Nations bodies such as the Human

ities against Rohingya and individuals of

Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 5497, the BURMA Act of 
2022, which I have introduced, along-
side Representative STEVE CHABOT, the 
ranking member of the Asia, the Pa-
cific, Central Asia, and Nonprolifera-
tion Subcommittee, who I want to 
thank for working in a bipartisan way. 
I also want to thank Foreign Affairs 
Committee Ranking Member MICHAEL 
MCCAUL for working with me in a bi-
partisan way on this very important 
and very timely bill. 
Mr. Speaker, democracy is under se-
vere strain across the globe, and the 
current crisis in Burma is a stark re-
minder of this challenge. 
It has been just over a year since the 
Burmese military staged an illegal and 
illegitimate coup d’etat, seizing con-
trol of the Union Government and de-
taining a broad cross section of demo-
cratically elected civilian leaders. As 
the military upended Burma’s fragile 
transition to democracy, it began a 
widespread suppression of fundamental 
freedoms. 
Over the past 14 months, the mili-
tary’s brutal and senseless violence has 
resulted in more than 1,700 people 
killed, including over 100 children. 
Thousands have been unjustly de-
tained, and nearly half a million people 
have been displaced by the military’s 
violence. 
Congress cannot, cannot and must 
not, stand idly by as the military bru-
tally kills its people. As the war in 
Ukraine has reminded us, America 
must stand up with freedom-loving 
people everywhere. 
The Burmese people have coura-
geously resisted the military’s repres-
sion and violence. They have organized 
a civil disobedience movement to erode 
the military’s ability to govern. A 
shadow 
government, 
the 
National 
Unity Government, has emerged to re-
store democratic civilian rule. All they 
are asking of us is that the world come 
to their aid and their cause. 
The Biden administration has taken 
critical steps to stand with the Bur-
mese people, and I want to commend 
Secretary Blinken’s formal determina-
tion last month that the Burmese mili-
tary committed genocide and crimes 
against humanity against Rohingyas, 
something that was long, long overdue, 
and which I advocated for in this cur-
rent bill. 
But now it is Congress’ turn to act. 
The important resolutions, statements 
of condemnation, and letters of soli-
darity this body has sent over the past 
14 months are important, but not suffi-
cient. The people of Burma need us to 
do more. Frankly, the Burmese mili-
tary’s gross abuses demand that we do 
more. 
H.R. 5497 is a comprehensive, bipar-
tisan bill that holds the Burmese mili-
tary 
accountable 
through 
targeted 
sanctions, puts pressure on the junta 
by urging greater action at the United 
Nations, and calling for a Special Coor-
dinator for Burmese Democracy. 
It authorizes humanitarian assist-
ance for the hundreds of thousands of 
Burmese citizens that have been inter-
nally displaced or fled across the bor-
der. It calls on the State Department 
to document the genocide and the 
crimes against humanity committed 
against Rohingyas and other Burmese 
ethnic minorities. 
The same military leaders which per-
petuated a genocide against Rohingya 
are now using the same tactics to un-
leash unprecedented bloodshed across 
the entire country. We must end the 
impunity of the Burmese military and 
make it harder for it to enact its bru-
tality. 
And to every member of the Burmese 
ruling elite that does not support the 
pathway taken by General Min Aung 
Hlaing, let me say to you loud and 
clear: Now is the time for you to think 
about your country’s future and defect, 
defect, because the Burmese people and 
the international community will re-
member which side you stood on. 
The economic and diplomatic pres-
sure that this bill applies is essential 
to changing the junta’s calculus and 
forcing it to the negotiating table. By 
passing this legislation, we will take a 
meaningful step, not just to stand up 
with the Burmese people, but also to 
help bring this crisis to an end. 
Therefore, before this bill becomes 
law, I look forward to working with my 
colleagues in a bipartisan way to refine 
the sanctions in this bill so that they 
remain relevant and effective. 
Thus, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this measure so that we can move 
it one step closer to the President’s 
desk. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: I am writing con-
cerning H.R. 5497, the BURMA Act of 2022. In 
order to permit H.R. 5497 to proceed expedi-
tiously to the House Floor, I agree to forgo 
formal consideration of the bill. 
The Committee on Financial Services 
takes this action to forego formal consider-
ation of H.R. 5497 in light of our mutual un-
derstanding that, by foregoing formal con-
sideration of H.R. 5497 at this time, we do 
not waive any jurisdiction over the subject 
matter contained in this or similar legisla-
tion, and that our Committee will be appro-
priately consulted and involved as this or 
similar legislation moves forward with re-
gard to any matters in the Committee’s ju-
risdiction. The Committee also reserves the 
right to seek appointment of an appropriate 
number of conferees to any House-Senate 
conference involving this or similar legisla-
tion that involves the Committee’s jurisdic-
tion and request your support for any such 
request. 
Finally, I would appreciate your response 
to this letter confirming this understanding, 
and I would ask that a copy of our exchange 
of letters on this matter be included in the 
Congressional Record during Floor consider-
ation of H.R. 5497.

DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS: I am writing 
to you concerning H.R. 5497, the BURMA Act 
of 2022, as amended. I appreciate your will-
ingness to work cooperatively on this legis-
lation. 
I acknowledge that provisions of the bill 
fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee 
on Financial Services under House Rule X, 
and that your Committee will forgo action 
on H.R. 5497 to expedite floor consideration. 
I further acknowledge that the inaction of 
your Committee with respect to the bill does 
not waive any future jurisdictional claim 
over the matters contained in the bill that 
fall within your jurisdiction. I also acknowl-
edge that your Committee will be appro-
priately consulted and involved as this or 
similar legislation moves forward, and will 
support the appointment of Committee on 
Financial Services conferees during any 
House-Senate conference convened on this 
legislation. 
Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of 
letters is included in the Congressional 
Record during floor consideration of the bill. 
Thank you again for your cooperation re-
garding the legislation. I look forward to 
continuing to work with you as the measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
GREGORY W. MEEKS, 
Chairman. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to 
represent New York’s 22nd Congres-
sional District, which is home to gen-
erations of Burmese refugees, dating 
back to the first family arriving in the 
early 2000s, and where nearly 5,000 Bur-
mese refugees reside. 
On February 1 of last year, Burma’s 
military seized power in a violent coup, 
ending 5 years of flawed, but prom-
ising, democracy, dragging Burma back 
into a brutal military rule. 
Over the last year, the world has 
watched in horror as the military tar-
geted innocent Burmese men, women, 
and children. The latest estimates indi-
cate that over 1,700 people have been 
murdered and more than 13,000 arrested 
by the junta. 
In the face of this violence and re-
pression, the resilience of the people of 
Burma is no less than inspiring. The 
legislation we are considering today is 
an important step forward in standing 
with the people of Burma and holding 
their perpetrators accountable. 
The BURMA Act will impose manda-
tory sanctions on the military regime, 
as well as entities that continue to 
support it. 
While the White House has begun to 
take steps to reimpose the sanctions 
regime that the former Democratic ad-
ministration prematurely lifted, it is 
time that the Burmese military is 
again sanctioned as a matter of law, es-
pecially now that the United States

Now, more than ever, I urge all to re-

I thank Chairman MEEKS and Con-

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
think I have any further speakers, so I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, America stands as free 
people against dictators and despots. It 
is part of our values, and it is an im-
portant signal to the world that the 
United States stands firm against 
autocrats, whether in Burma or Russia. 
Last Friday, China’s Foreign Min-
ister, Wang Yi, showed the world how 
true this is. He met with his counter-
part from the Burmese junta regime 
and said that the Chinese Communist 
Party would back the Tatmadaw ‘‘no 
matter how the situation changes.’’ 
We are at a critical point in history. 
Authoritarian regimes like China are 
partnering with their autocratic allies 
around the world to make the globe 
less free; to undermine human dignity 
and individual freedom; and to oppress 
those who stand up and have the cour-
age to speak out as the Burmese people 
have. It is sickening, and it is one more 
reason why this legislation is so time-
ly. 
It is critical that America stands 
united in supporting the people of 
Burma and championing their funda-
mental human rights in the face of 
military oppression. I will continue to 
be a voice for this community as we 
fight to oppose this affront to the peo-
ple of Burma’s dignity and freedom and 
quest for peace. 
I, once again, urge my colleagues to 
support this measure. I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, Congress must do more 
to address this crisis in Burma, and 
H.R. 5497, the BURMA Act of 2021, will 
do just that. It will take concrete steps 
to hold the Burmese military account-
able for its coup and for the perpetra-
tion of gross human rights violations 
and other unspeakable atrocities. 
This bill, Mr. Speaker, sends a strong 
and unequivocal message that there 
are severe consequences for subverting 
democracy, and that the United States 
of America stands firmly with the Bur-
mese people in their struggle for 
human rights and their democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope all of my col-
leagues, all 435 of us, will join me in 
supporting this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of H.R. 5497, the BURMA Act which is impor-
tant legislation to support the courageous peo-
ple of Burma as they struggle to wrest democ-
racy from the hands of their authoritarian mili-
tary. 
On February 1, 2021, after a decade of 
promising democratic reforms in Burma, the 
Burmese 
military 
(also 
known 
as 
the 
Tatmadaw) seized control of the civilian gov-
ernment, declared a state of emergency, and 
unlawfully detained State Councilor Aung San 
Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and many 
Members of Parliament. In response, the peo-
ple of Burma took to the streets to demand 
the restoration of civilian rule, only to be met 
with the Tatmadaw’s brutal campaign of re-
pression, involving extrajudicial executions, 
mass arrests and disappearances, and other 
authoritarian tactics. 
H.R. 
5497 
is 
legislation 
to 
hold 
the 
Tatmadaw accountable for their human rights 
abuses by authorizing targeted sanctions 
against the Burmese military and its affiliated 
entities. These sanctions will deprive the 
Tatmadaw of the resources they need to con-
tinue their violent suppression of the Burmese 
people. H.R. 5497 also provides much-needed 
funds to support pro-democracy civil society 
groups in Burma and alleviate the severe hu-
manitarian crisis caused by the Tatmadaw’s 
violence and mismanagement of the economy. 
I’m pleased that this legislation advances 
many of the goals outlined in H. Res. 896, a 
resolution I introduced on the one-year anni-
versary of the coup to condemn the Burmese 
military’s human rights abuses. My resolution 
calls 
for 
tough 
sanctions 
against 
the 
Tatmadaw, robust humanitarian assistance for 
the Burmese people, and increased efforts to 
hold the Tatmadaw accountable for atrocities. 
At a time when democracy is being threat-
ened around the world, it’s imperative that the 
United States join with the courageous people 
of Burma who are fighting to restore democ-
racy in their country. By passing H.R. 5497, 
Congress will demonstrate our solidarity with 
the Burmese people, and I urge all my col-
leagues to support this bill and vote yes. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, as the Ranking 
Member of the Asia-Pacific Subcommittee, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 5497, the 
BURMA Act, bipartisan legislation Chairman 
MEEKS and I introduced last year in response 
to the coup in Burma. And I want to thank 
Ranking Member MCCAUL and Ms. TENNEY 
and all those who have supported this legisla-
tion on both sides of the aisle. 
As everyone who follows the situation in 
Burma knows, on February 1, 2021 the Bur-
mese military perpetrated a coup against the 
civilian government, detained its elected lead-
ers and set up a junta. 
This is by no means the first time the gen-
erals have seized power but this time the re-
sponse has been different. The people of 
Burma, in all walks of life have courageously 
stood up against the military with peaceful pro-
tests, mass strikes, and other civil disobe-
dience. 
The military’s response bas been predict-
able—they initiated a crackdown that con-
tinues today. They’ve killed over seventeen 
hundred people and imprisoned thousands 
more. This repression has pushed the country 
into civil war, essentially, as the generals stub-
bornly refuse to restore democracy. 
Let me be clear, this coup is a blatant viola-
tion of the rights of the Burmese people. Self- 
government and self-determination are rights 
of all people around the world, not a gift from 
a small handful of elites who pretend to be en-
titled to rule over their fellow citizens. The 
generals cannot simply back out of democracy 
when it no longer serves their purposes. It’s a 
right that’s owed to the people of Burma. 
In response to the coup, Chairman MEEKS 
and I introduced this BURMA Act. Briefly re-
capping the history of this legislation, in Sep-
tember 2017, the Burmese military began a 
genocidal campaign to permanently drive the 
Rohingya out of Burma which resulted in over 
700,000 
Rohingya 
refugees 
fleeing 
from 
Rakhine State, Burma into neighboring Ban-
gladesh. They remain there today without any 
meaningful hope of returning home. 
This campaign consisted of widespread, 
systematic, and premeditated human rights 
abuses, including barbaric killings, gang rapes, 
and the burning of around 400 Rohingya vil-
lages. According to a partial State Department 
report on these atrocities, about half of the 
Rohingya surveyed said they personally wit-
nessed a rape while about 80 percent wit-
nessed killings and the destruction of villages. 
In response to these atrocities, Ranking 
Member Eliot Engel and I wrote the original 
BURMA Act which would have imposed sanc-
tions on the military, and deployed several 
other tools to address longstanding concerns 
with Burma. While the legislation passed in 
the House several times, the Senate failed to 
take it up. 
Last year, in response to the coup, Chair-
man MEEKS and I updated the BURMA Act to 
provide some measure of accountability for 
both the genocide in 2017 and this year’s 
coup, and to reflect the sanctions the Biden 
Administration has already imposed on the 
Burmese military. The new version of the leg-
islation will levy stronger sanctions against the 
military, and provide additional assistance to 
the people of Burma. 
I would specifically like to point out that this 
legislation deals specifically with accountability 
for 
the 
crimes 
committed 
against 
the 
Rohingya, and has for the last several years 
required the State Department to determine 
whether this was a genocide. I’m pleased that 
last month Secretary Blinken took this step, 
and declared officially and on behalf of the 
United States what many of us have known 
for some time that the crimes were indeed a 
genocide. This decision is one we can all sup-
port—and probably one of the few things this 
Administration has done that I can really get 
behind. 
As the coup and its aftermath continue to 
drag on, we must use this determination to 
renew focus on the situation in Burma and in-
tensify our efforts to see that the Burmese 
Military comes to terms with the fact that the 
people have chosen a different path. The 
BURMA Act would go a long way in that effort, 
so I would urge my colleagues to support its 
passage. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 5497, ‘‘Burma Unified 
through Rigorous Military Accountability Act of 
2021’’ or BURMA Act. 
The purpose of this bill is to authorize hu-
manitarian assistance and civil society sup-
port, promote democracy and human rights, 
and impose targeted sanctions with respect to 
human rights abuses in Burma. 
The legislation condemns the actions taken 
by the Burmese military during its coup on 
February 1, 2021 and its aftermath.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4212 
April 6, 2022 
The BURMA Act: 
Authorizes sanctions on individuals and enti-
ties who helped stage the February 1 coup 
d’etat and are responsible for the subsequent 
repression of fundamental freedoms, human 
rights abuses, use of indiscriminate violence 
towards civilians, and other gross atrocities. 
Prohibits the import of precious and semi- 
precious gemstones from Burma into the 
United States. 
Authorizes a new position at the State De-
partment, a Special Coordinator for Burmese 
Democracy, to promote an international effort 
to impose and enforce multilateral sanctions 
on Burma and coordinate United States Gov-
ernment interagency efforts on Burma. 
Authorizes support to civil society and for 
humanitarian 
assistance 
in 
Burma, 
Ban-
gladesh, Thailand, and the surrounding region. 
Calls for the Department of State to make a 
genocide determination with regard to the per-
secution of the Rohingya. 
Calls for the United States to pressure the 
United Nations to take more decisive action 
with regards to Burma. 
By authorizing targeted sanctions against 
the Burmese military, the Burmese Administra-
tive Council and affiliated entities, the bill 
holds accountable those responsible for the 
perpetration of the coup and the ensuing 
atrocities that have claimed over a thousand 
lives. 
It has been a little over a year since the 
Burmese military staged its illegal and illegit-
imate coup, reversing years of reform and 
Burma’s fragile transition to democracy. 
The military regime has killed more than 
1,728 people since February of 2021, includ-
ing around 100 children, and illegally detained 
more than 13,084 people. 
The violence toward its own citizens has 
displaced roughly 400,000 people within the 
country. 
This brings the estimated total of internally 
displaced persons to 776,000 and of refugees 
and asylum-seekers in neighboring countries 
to more than 1 million. 
People in Myanmar desperately need food, 
clean water and protection to survive. 
The BURMA Act would address these gaps 
by funding humanitarian assistance and ad-
dressing issues in Myanmar including human 
rights violations, displacement, and armed 
conflict. 
Having previously lived under military rule 
and authoritarianism for decades, the people 
of Myanmar responded to the coup with cour-
age and resistance. 
Democracy activists flooded the streets, 
formed a shadow government, and carried out 
a massive civil disobedience movement to 
shut down the machinery of the state. 
The tragedy underway in Myanmar epito-
mizes the battle between democracy and 
authoritarianism. 
However, the people of Myanmar have not 
received much support from the international 
community, in efforts to condemn this coup 
the United States must act now by expanding 
targeted sanctions to halt this. 
The toll on the people of Burma has been 
truly staggering, under the military’s harsh 
rule, no one is safe from violence, arbitrary 
detainment, military attack, and infringements 
on human rights. 
I am optimistic that we will pass the BURMA 
Act to apply economic pressure, provide hu-
manitarian support, and redouble diplomatic 
efforts against the military junta. 
The people of Burma can no longer afford 
to wait, so neither should we. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for 
H.R. 5497 because these people who have 
survived crimes against humanity, discrimina-
tion, gender-based violence and forced dis-
placement in Myanmar need the humanitarian 
assistance this bill would provide. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5497, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
UKRAINE INVASION WAR CRIMES 
DETERRENCE 
AND 
ACCOUNT-
ABILITY ACT 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7276) to direct the President to 
submit to Congress a report on United 
States Government efforts to collect, 
analyze, and preserve evidence and in-
formation related to war crimes and 
any other atrocities committed during 
the 
full-scale 
Russian 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine since February 24, 2022, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7276 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ukraine In-
vasion War Crimes Deterrence and Account-
ability Act’’. 
SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) in its premeditated, unprovoked, un-
justified, and unlawful full-scale invasion of 
Ukraine that commenced on February 24, 
2022, the military of the Government of the 
Russian Federation under the direction of 
President Vladimir Putin has committed war 
crimes that include but are not limited to— 
(A) the deliberate targeting of civilians 
and injuring or killing of noncombatants; 
(B) the deliberate targeting and attacking 
of hospitals, schools, and other non-military 
buildings dedicated to religion, art, science, 
or charitable purposes, such as the bombing 
of a theater in Mariupol that served as a 
shelter for noncombatants and had the word 
‘‘children’’ written clearly in the Russian 
language outside; 
(C) the indiscriminate bombardment of 
undefended dwellings and buildings; 
(D) the wanton destruction of property not 
justified by military necessity; 
(E) unlawful civilian deportations; 
(F) the taking of hostages; and 
(G) rape, or sexual assault or abuse; 
(2) the use of chemical weapons by the 
Government of the Russian Federation in 
Ukraine would constitute a war crime, and 
engaging in any military preparations to use 
chemical weapons or to develop, produce, 
stockpile, or retain chemical weapons is pro-
hibited by the Chemical Weapons Conven-
tion, to which the Russian Federation is a 
signatory; 
(3) Vladimir Putin has a long record of 
committing acts of aggression, systematic 
abuses of human rights, and acts that con-
stitute war crimes or other atrocities both 
at home and abroad, and the brutality and 
scale of these actions, including in the Rus-
sian Federation republic of Chechnya, Geor-
gia, Syria, and Ukraine, demonstrate the ex-
tent to which his regime is willing to flout 
international norms and values in the pur-
suit of its objectives; 
(4) Vladimir Putin has previously sanc-
tioned the use of chemical weapons at home 
and abroad, including in the poisonings of 
Russian spy turned double agent Sergei 
Skripal and his daughter Yulia and leading 
Russian opposition figure Aleksey Navalny, 
and aided and abetted the use of chemical 
weapons by President Bashar al-Assad in 
Syria; and 
(5) in 2014, the Government of the Russian 
Federation initiated its unprovoked war of 
aggression against Ukraine which resulted in 
its illegal occupation of Crimea, the unrec-
ognized declaration of independence by the 
so-called ‘‘Donetsk People’s Republic’’ and 
‘‘Luhansk People’s Republic’’ by Russia- 
backed proxies, and numerous human rights 
violations and deaths of civilians in Ukraine. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to collect, analyze, and preserve evi-
dence and information related to war crimes 
and other atrocities committed during the 
full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine that 
began on February 24, 2022, for use in appro-
priate domestic, foreign, and international 
courts and tribunals prosecuting those re-
sponsible for such crimes; 
(2) to help deter the commission of war 
crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine by 
publicizing to the maximum possible extent, 
including among Russian and other foreign 
military commanders and troops in Ukraine, 
efforts to identify and prosecute those re-
sponsible for the commission of war crimes 
during the full-scale Russian invasion of 
Ukraine that began on February 24, 2022; and 
(3) to continue efforts to identify, deter, 
and pursue accountability for war crimes 
and other atrocities committed around the 
world and by other perpetrators, and to le-
verage international cooperation and best 
practices in this regard with respect to the 
current situation in Ukraine. 
SEC. 4. REPORT ON UNITED STATES EFFORTS. 
Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, and consistent with 
the protection of intelligence sources and 
methods, the President shall submit to the 
appropriate congressional committees a re-
port, which may include a classified annex, 
describing in detail the following: 
(1) United States Government efforts to 
collect, analyze, and preserve evidence and 
information related to war crimes and other 
atrocities committed during the full-scale 
Russian invasion of Ukraine since February 
24, 2022, including a description of— 
(A) the respective roles of various agencies, 
departments, and offices, and the inter-
agency mechanism established for the co-
ordination of such efforts; 
(B) the types of information and evidence 
that are being collected, analyzed, and pre-
served to help identify those responsible for 
the commission of war crimes or other atroc-
ities during the full-scale Russian invasion 
of Ukraine in 2022; and 
(C) steps taken to coordinate with, and 
support the work of, allies, partners, inter-
national institutions and organizations, and 
nongovernmental organizations in such ef-
forts. 
(2) Media, public diplomacy, and informa-
tion operations to make Russian military 
commanders, troops, political leaders and 
the Russian people aware of efforts to iden-
tify and prosecute those responsible for the

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 7276, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 7276, the Ukraine Invasion War 
Crimes Deterrence and Accountability 
Act introduced by my good friend and 
the ranking member of the House For-
eign Affairs Committee, Mr. MCCAUL. 
I want to thank Mr. MCCAUL
for 
working collectively across the aisle as 
we do on many bills, but on this impor-
tant bill, for his leadership on it. It is 
very timely and very important. 
Mr. Speaker, each day we see a grow-
ing body of horrifying evidence of 
atrocities that Russian troops have 
wreaked on Ukrainian citizens. Mr. 
MCCAUL and I traveled to Poland, and 
we saw with our own eyes the refugees 
fleeing Ukraine because of Putin’s war; 
not knowing whether they would see 
their husbands or fathers or uncles 
ever again; not knowing what their to-
morrow would be. 
This week, the images, the videos, 
and the firsthand accounts from Bucha 
were nothing short of chilling, and as 
it did seeing the refugees cross the bor-
der in Poland, it pains my heart to 
know that this is likely just the tip of 
the iceberg of what Ukrainians have 
suffered. 
b 1245 
In attempting to justify his war of 
choice on Ukraine, Putin’s relentless 
dehumanization of Ukrainians has laid 
the foundation for atrocities so vile it 
churns one’s stomach. 
We have seen this before, Mr. Speak-
er. It is the same dehumanization that 
has led to every genocide before. I fear 
what we have seen in Bucha is hap-
pening throughout Ukraine right now, 
and it will only get worse. 
Nothing we do on this floor today 
will erase the generational trauma 
that Putin’s forces have inflicted on 
Ukrainians, but we can and must en-
sure that the United States of America 
is doing everything in its power to col-
lect evidence that can be used to pros-
ecute Russian war crimes and other 
atrocities. Hopefully, that will deter 
further systemic human rights abuses 
in this conflict. 
H.R. 7276 would require the adminis-
tration to detail efforts to collect, ana-
lyze, and preserve evidence of war 
crimes, and to describe the process 
through which a domestic, foreign, or 
international court or tribunal could 
request and obtain information related 
to war crimes or other atrocities from 
the United States. 
Every 
day 
of 
this 
illegal 
and 
unprovoked war further unites the 
global community against Russia’s ag-
gression in Ukraine. The images that 
we continue to see day in and day out 
are shocking to the conscience and also 
a call to action. 
To the leaders of the nations who 
have yet to condemn this barbaric war 
of choice, I ask them to please watch 
these videos of civilians being bombed 
and, as we did both in Poland and with 
those who visited us here in the House 
of Representatives, listen to the sur-
vivors who witnessed their neighbors 
and their friends shot in the streets or 
in their homes, some bound with their 
hands behind their backs. 
The camera of history is rolling, Mr. 
Speaker, and it will remember those 
countries that remain silent. 
Russia’s aggression in Ukraine must 
stop. We must unequivocally condemn 
the atrocities that are being carried 
out by Putin and his Russian invading 
forces. Those who are responsible, Mr. 
Speaker, must be brought to justice, no 
matter how long it takes or how hard 
it may be. 
The Ukraine Invasion War Crimes 
Deterrence and Accountability Act will 
help in collecting the necessary evi-
dence so that we can do just that: Hold 
those individuals accountable for the 
atrocities that they have committed. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my col-
leagues to join and support this crucial 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend, 
Chairman MEEKS, for working with me 
on this important legislation. This is a 
historic time, and it is a historic bill. 
This is the largest invasion in Europe 
since World War II, with war crimes in 
Europe the likes of which we haven’t 
seen since my father’s generation in 
my father’s war. 
Mr. Speaker, the world is watching, 
and history will judge us all by how we 
act, by our actions. As the chairman 
said, the tape is filming; the reel is 
filming this. We are seeing these hor-
rific images coming out of Ukraine as I 
speak, and sadly, there will be many 
more. We have just hit the surface. 
Corpses are littering the streets of 
Bucha, their hands tied behind their 
backs and bullets in their heads. Some 
are decapitated. 
A 
pregnant 
woman, 
covered 
in 
blood—these monsters bombed a ma-
ternity hospital, for God’s sake—as she 
gets wheeled out, holding on to her 
womb or baby. Sadly, and tragically, 
both she and her baby did not survive 
that day. 
Mothers are raped in front of their 
children, and young girls are raped in 
front of their families—girls. 
The bodies of families are half-buried 
together in shallow graves, with their 
hands still sticking out of the ground. 
My God, what is happening in this 
world? I never imagined or thought I 
would see this in my lifetime. This is of 
centuries ago, not today. 
The bombing of apartments and pub-
lic buildings providing refuge to chil-
dren and the elderly, including a the-
ater in Mariupol that had the word 
‘‘children’’ written outside so large in 
Russian that the satellites could see 
it—we could see it from satellites. 
What do the Russians do? They bombed 
it. They bombed it knowing that there 
were children inside. 
Today, just today, most disturbing, 
we have reporting out of Ukraine that 
Russia 
is 
bringing 
in 
mobile 
crematoriums to deal with the carnage 
because there are so many bodies in 
the streets. They are bringing in mo-
bile crematoriums in an effort to hide 
the evidence of their crimes. 
These are Putin’s war crimes, and he 
will be held responsible. He and his cro-
nies, and the Russian troops who have 
carried them out, must be held ac-
countable. 
Sadly, these are not the first war 
crimes committed by Putin’s troops, as 
the people of Chechnya, Georgia, and 
Syria can attest. 
We cannot wait for the next atrocity 
before we act. We must do what we can 
now to deter Russian leaders, com-
manders, and troops in the field from 
committing further war crimes. 
That is why we introduced this legis-
lation. It will ensure the United States 
helps the people of Ukraine gather, 
analyze, and maintain the evidence of 
these war crimes. 
It will also put Russian troops—I 
think ‘‘troops’’ is probably not the 
right word—these Russian monsters 
and their leaders on notice that the 
world is watching. 
The world is watching them right 
now, and we are taking names. We are

taking the names of these war crimi-
nals; we are taking photographs; we 
are taking surveillance; and we are 
taking the satellite imagery to docu-
ment this injustice, this crime against 
humanity. And we will seek justice. 
Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the 
bipartisan efforts that our committee 
has made. But on the topic, I just have 
to—my God, I can’t believe we are here 
even talking about this. I can’t believe 
this is actually happening in this 
world, in this century. 
These horrific atrocities in Bucha 
have made one thing crystal clear: No 
country can remain neutral in the face 
of this evil. The entire world needs to 
rally against Mr. Putin and these war 
crimes. Passing this bill is a step for-
ward to getting justice done. 
I was a Federal prosecutor for a good 
part of my life, and I have dealt with a 
lot of victims. I have seen a lot of real-
ly awful things that man can do to 
mankind. I have to say, Mr. Speaker, 
this is probably—in fact, it is abso-
lutely the worst thing I have seen in 
my lifetime. 
The world is watching, and history 
will judge us all. All nations will judge 
us all by what we do here and now. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
me thank the leadership of our chair-
man and the working relationship with 
the ranking member. 
Mr. Speaker, I was in Lithuania as 
the Russians were coming in, and I 
spent a couple of days there with the 
hopes and dreams of many people that, 
in actuality, there would not be an in-
vasion of Russia into Ukraine, even 
though we were being briefed on the 
30,000 to 40,000 troops in Belarus. 
Even on that day, we spoke to 
Ukraine parliamentarians, who indi-
cated that they were leaving the meet-
ing we were in and taking a 17-hour 
trip back to Ukraine as their son was 
standing up to join the Ukrainian mili-
tary. 
Little did we expect—as some people 
said, ‘‘just a couple of days’’—that we 
would be at a point where—we will not 
call it World War III, but we will call it 
the most brutal, vicious, and mur-
derous effort in Europe and the world 
almost since World War II. 
I cannot fathom the bodies found in a 
pit. I cannot understand moms and ba-
bies dying in the street. I cannot un-
derstand or accept the numbers of ci-
vilians targeted, their bodies strewn 
throughout the various cities. 
The movement to the east, the de-
struction of Odessa, and the unwilling-
ness of Vladimir Putin to even think of 
being serious at the peace table—it is 
important 
to 
say 
pronounced 
war 
crimes have been committed, that he 
must be at The Hague. 
I believe Europe should be more pro-
nounced in its annunciation. I frankly 
believe that there is a heavier penalty 
that he must pay. I don’t believe he 
should sit at another table of Western 
civilization. 
Most importantly, I rise to support 
this legislation and believe America is 
right to insist on Mr. Putin being tried 
for war crimes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 7276 the Ukraine Invasion 
War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability 
Act, to direct the President to submit a report 
to Congress on the United States efforts to 
collect and analyze evidence and information 
related to the war crimes committed by the 
Russian Federation during their full-scale inva-
sion of Ukraine. 
This legislation requires the Administration 
to detail the process our government will un-
dertake to collect, analyze, and preserve evi-
dence of these war crimes, so that perpetra-
tors of these and other atrocities are held ac-
countable. 
There is no question of whether the Russian 
Federation, under the direction of Vladimir 
Putin has been defying the laws of war 
throughout its unprovoked, unjust, and unlaw-
ful invasion of Ukraine. 
H.R. 7276 will ensure the U.S. maintains a 
coordinated effort to collect evidence to be 
used to prosecute Russian war crimes in 
Ukraine. 
This bill will help to deter future war crimes 
by ensuring Russian troops and their com-
manders know the world is watching closely. 
In the three decades since gaining its inde-
pendence, Ukraine has sought its own path to 
sovereignty and has pursued closer economic, 
social, and political ties with the free market 
and democratic nations of the West. 
Since 2013, the Russian Federation under 
the direction of President Vladimir Putin, has 
imposed a campaign of political, economic, 
and military aggression against Ukraine. 
In February 2014, the Russian military 
began the invasion of eastern regions in 
Ukraine, including the Crimean Peninsula. The 
military also backed separatist insurgents in 
the Donbass region, where fighting has killed 
over 14,000 people. 
Today 
the 
world 
is 
witnessing 
the 
unprovoked aggression and invasion ordered 
by Vladimir Putin. 
President Putin and his associates must be 
held personally liable for the war crimes com-
mitted against the people of Ukraine. 
Russia claims it is not attacking civilians, yet 
thousands of people have been killed, mostly 
from explosive weapons with a wide impact 
area, including shelling from heavy artillery 
and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile 
and air strikes. 
Families are being separated by war, adults 
and children are being ruthlessly killed, and ci-
vilian infrastructure has been completely oblit-
erated in parts of eastern Ukraine. 
These reckless Russian attacks have lev-
eled homes, preschools, post offices, muse-
ums, sports facilities, hospitals, and factories. 
Power and gas lines have been severed, 
bridges and railway stations blown up inten-
tionally to restrict refugee movement within the 
country. 
Civilians have been killed in their cars, while 
waiting in bread lines, and while seeking treat-
ment in hospitals. 
Remnants of a missile were found in a 
Ukrainian zoo, residential neighborhoods have 
been shelled to pieces and morgues are over-
flowing with bodies. 
Additionally, a rogue Russia is violently 
crushing political speech opposing the war 
from its own citizens. 
As Russian ground forces advance in 
Ukraine, Ukrainians are sheltering from artil-
lery shells and cruise missiles in subways and 
bomb shelters. 
But in addition to the conventional military 
forces that Russia brings to bear, Russia has 
been utilizing nonconventional warfare for 
years. 
Russia has been running a long-running 
campaign to cast Ukrainians as Nazis and the 
perpetrators of genocide against Russian- 
speakers in eastern Ukraine in order to justify 
an invasion. 
The western world must continue to march 
in lockstep against this senseless Russian in-
vasion of a sovereign nation. 
We will make it clear to President Putin that 
there is no possibility for him to win this war 
when our alliances are as united and as for-
tified as they are now and will continue to be 
throughout the entire duration of this conflict. 
Putin may seize ground, but he will never 
hold it. 
Thank you, and I look forward to discussing 
recommended measures to hold Russia ac-
countable for this manufactured war.

Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong 
support 
of 
H.R. 
7276, 
the 
Ukraine Invasion War Crimes Deter-
rence and Accountability Act. 
I am a proud cosponsor of this impor-
tant legislation, and I thank Chairman 
MEEKS and the committee for working 
with Ranking Member MCCAUL on this 
critical, bipartisan bill. 
Last weekend, the world saw in 
Bucha what the Ukrainian people have 
been telling us since the start of this 
invasion, that the Russians are indis-
criminately torturing and executing 
Ukrainian men, women, and children. 
It is important in these periods of 
conflict that the United States con-
tribute to collecting, analyzing, and 
preserving critical evidence of war 
crimes and other atrocities. 
For two decades Putin has gone un-
checked and never paid a diplomatic or 
even economic price for his 22 years of 
mania. He has never faced, until he 
met the Ukrainians, true armed resist-
ance. He leveled Grozny, destroyed his-
toric Aleppo with his coconspirator and 
partner, Assad, and he waltzed into 
Crimea, Mr. Speaker, in 2014 without 
firing a shot. The line has been finally 
drawn in Ukraine. 
This House, on a bipartisan basis, has 
worked to document Assad’s mass mur-
der in Syria. As a result of that work 
and the work of the United Nations 
Mechanism, we have had a recent con-
viction in Koblenz, Germany, of a Syr-
ian intelligence official for crimes 
against humanity. 
The U.N. recently approved an inde-
pendent inquiry into Ukraine. That is 
precisely the same step of a decade ago 
in Syria. Enacting this legislation will 
ensure that the United States contrib-
utes to this effort.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4215 
April 6, 2022 
I encourage all my colleagues to sup-
port this important bill, and I thank 
Mr. MEEKS and Mr. MCCAUL for their 
leadership. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time at this mo-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my good friend for 
yielding, and I thank both Ranking 
Member MCCAUL and Chairman MEEKS 
for their extraordinary leadership on 
this important bill that is before us 
today. 
I want to thank Mr. MEEKS for his el-
oquent remarks a moment ago summa-
rizing the absolute atrocities that are 
being committed by Vladimir Putin, 
his military, and Lukashenko who is 
the enabler, the President of Belarus. 
The gentleman has described in vivid 
detail just how horrific this is. And as 
my good friend from Texas said a mo-
ment ago, my father fought in World 
War II as well in the South Pacific, but 
the crimes that were committed by im-
perial Japan and by the Nazis are now 
being replicated on a grand scale by 
Vladimir Putin. It has to stop, and it 
has to stop yesterday. So I rise in 
strong support of this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, on March 8 I chaired 
a hearing at the Tom Lantos Human 
Rights Commission entitled ‘‘Account-
ability for Russia’s War Crimes and Ag-
gression Against Ukraine.’’ The day be-
fore I also introduced a resolution call-
ing for accountability for Vladimir 
Putin 
for 
his 
crimes 
against 
the 
Ukrainian people and his aggression 
against Ukraine. 
The witnesses could not have been 
more clear that delay is denial and 
that we need to act now. 
I was very much involved with the 
court in the former Yugoslavia and 
very involved with the court for Sierra 
Leone. David Crane led that effort. I 
was very involved with the Rwandan 
court and tried to get a court for Syria 
but failed. I pushed hard for it with a 
resolution on this floor, and the House 
did pass it. 
But the key here is timeliness. Don’t 
wait. 
The ICC, while it may do some good 
here, and they do have an investigation 
that they have instituted, the ICC has 
been notoriously slow. They have had 
less than 10 convictions over 20 years. 
Now, if that venue works, great. But 
my concern—and I think the concern 
shared by many, particularly in the 
NGO community—is that there needs 
to be another venue stood up quickly 
that could make the difference. 
At the March hearing, David Crane, 
the founding Chief Prosecutor of the 
U.N. Special Court for Sierra Leone, 
talked about an international tribunal 
created by the United Nations General 
Assembly. We are all thinking, Hey, 
when it gets to the Security Council, 
the Security Council will have two ve-
toes at least. It will be Russia, and it 
will be China. Not so in the General As-
sembly. They can stand up a court and 
they can do it tomorrow that would in-
dict Vladimir Putin on the next day. 
There is certainly enough evidence— 
keep building the evidence, of course— 
but there is enough evidence to do it 
right now, and that, hopefully, will tell 
everybody around him that the time 
will come when you will be in the dock 
as well. 
I remember meeting with Slobodan 
Milosevic in Serbia and going to Bos-
nia and Croatia many times during 
that horrific war in the Balkans. Time 
and time again he thought he was un-
touchable, total impunity because of 
that. He killed so many because there 
was no accountability. Well, he went to 
The Hague as part of the ad hoc tri-
bunal, and he died while the pro-
ceedings were underway. But he would 
have been held to account. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this. We have al-
ready had one vote in the General As-
sembly, 141 out of 198 voted and a num-
ber of people abstained. You only need 
a simple majority. 
I did ask our number two at the 
State Department, at GREGORY MEEKS’ 
hearing earlier today, to take back to 
the administration the idea of looking 
at all the venues. But let’s get a court 
constituted immediately. If the ICC 
wants to step in at some point, fine. 
But indict Putin. Indict him, and you 
will see some people running like rats 
on the ship who were a part of his re-
gime knowing that they, too, will be 
held accountable and sent to prison for 
the rest of their lives. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time for 
the purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, we rise today not as 
Republicans 
or 
Democrats 
but 
as 
Americans and as a united Congress on 
behalf of the American people con-
demning these atrocities. 
Madam Speaker, there is a group 
called the Wagner Group that is enter-
ing Ukraine right now. They are the 
worst of the worst. They are merce-
naries. They are cold-blooded killers. 
Mr. Putin has sent them to Africa to 
kill people in Mali and Libya, and they 
have been in the Donbas previously. 
They have a saying, these Wagner 
thugs, these monsters, that our busi-
ness is killing, and business is good. 
This is sick. They rape women and 
girls. They kill for a living, and, yes, 
now they are entering Ukraine. 
Sadly, Madam Speaker, I am not sure 
Bucha is the last we are going to see of 
this, and when the dust clears from 
Mariupol, God knows what we are 
going to find there. God only knows. 
When they are talking about mobile 
crematoriums to hide the evidence of 
so much carnage and so many bodies to 
be burned. This has to stop. 
We are standing together united as 
Americans condemning this, and as a 
former Federal prosecutor, yes, to in-
dict Mr. Putin for his crimes against 
humanity. 
Mr. Putin thought his legacy after 
this fiasco was going to be reclaiming 
the glory of the empire. He would be 
known as great as the czars or maybe 
Stalin. Maybe he is like Stalin. His leg-
acy is not going to be reclaiming the 
empire. His legacy is going to be that 
of a war criminal. That will impact his 
psyche, and that will impact all those 
around him, including his oligarchs, 
that no one is safe here, that you will 
be indicted internationally, and that 
you will be brought to justice. 
For without justice in the face of 
these crimes against humanity, what 
good are we? So this is an historic mo-
ment. 
I want to thank the chairman, as al-
ways, on this committee for working 
with me to stand up against evil, be-
cause that is exactly what this is. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for the 
purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, what we are wit-
nessing Russian troops do in Ukraine 
represents some of the worst of human-
kind. Right now, the world is watching 
horrifying war crimes taking place. 
The world is watching the extent to 
which Putin is willing to flout inter-
national norms and values in the pur-
suit of its brutality, and the world is 
also watching what we as a nation are 
going to do about it. 
The Department of State has offi-
cially concluded that Russian forces 
have committed war crimes in Ukraine 
which were made vividly clear by the 
horrifying images emerging over this 
past weekend from Bucha. Investiga-
tions into these war crimes are already 
beginning and must continue. 
I am saying today, as chair of the 
House 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Committee 
working along with my friend and part-
ner, 
the 
ranking 
member, 
MIKE 
MCCAUL, we will work tirelessly to 
make sure that justice is delivered and 
that the administration works strenu-
ously in concert with partners and al-
lies to this end because meaningful jus-
tice for these crimes helps prevent such 
atrocities in the future. 
This legislation requires the adminis-
tration to detail efforts to preserve evi-
dence and hold perpetrators account-
able for the atrocities that are com-
mitted and to detail the means for do-
mestic, hybrid, or international courts 
and their tribunals to request access to 
such information. 
This legislation, the Ukrainian Inva-
sion War Crimes Deterrence and Ac-
countability Act, will ensure that vic-
tims and perpetrators alike know that 
the United States of America and the 
world, we have got to get those off the 
seat, those who abstain in the U.N., 
they see the same thing. We need them 
to stand and have a voice. 
The world is watching. The world 
will hold Putin and the Russian Armed

Forces and those who are in their duma 
and those who keep pushing this war 
that is caused by one man, Vladimir 
Putin—these 
abhorrent 
war 
crimes 
which continue to go on—accountable. 
It is a war of choice that Putin has de-
cided to place on Ukraine. 
That is why, Madam Speaker, I am so 
proud to partner with MIKE MCCAUL in 
bringing H.R. 7276 to the floor today so 
that my children, my grandchildren, 
my 
great-great-grandchildren,

tory and how the United States Con-
gress stood at this time in history. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.

motion offered by the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) that the House 
suspend the rules and pass the bill, 
H.R. 7276, as amended. 
The question was taken.

RELATING 
TO 
THE 
CONSIDER-
ATION OF HOUSE REPORT 117–284 
AND AN ACCOMPANYING RESO-
LUTION 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, by direc-
tion of the Committee on Rules, I call 
up House Resolution 1023 and ask for 
its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1023 
Resolved, That if House Report 117–284 is 
called up by direction of the Select Com-
mittee to Investigate the January 6th At-
tack on the United States Capitol: (a) all 
points of order against the report are waived 
and the report shall be considered as read; 
and (b)(1) an accompanying resolution of-
fered by direction of the Select Committee 
to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the 
United States Capitol shall be considered as 
read and shall not be subject to a point of 
order; and (2) the previous question shall be 
considered as ordered on such resolution to 
adoption without intervening motion or de-
mand for division of the question except one 
hour of debate equally divided among and 
controlled by Representative Thompson of 
Mississippi, Representative Cheney of Wyo-
ming, and an opponent, or their respective 
designees. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
WELCH). The gentleman from Maryland 
is recognized for 1 hour. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, for the 
purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), pending which I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
During consideration of this resolu-
tion, all time yielded is for the purpose 
of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules 
Committee met and reported a rule, 
House Resolution 1023. The rule pro-
vides for consideration of the resolu-
tion accompanying House Report 117– 
284 under a closed rule if the report is 
called up by direction of the Select 
Committee to Investigate the January 
6th Attack on the United States Cap-
itol. The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided among and controlled 
by Chairman THOMPSON, Vice Chair 
CHENEY, and an opponent. 
Mr. Speaker, if 90 percent of success 
in life is just showing up, then 90 per-
cent of acting in contempt of Congress 
is not showing up by failing to respond 
to multiple subpoenas you have been 
lawfully served. The rest of contempt 
is not turning over documents you 
have been ordered to produce and act-
ing with open disregard and scorn for 
the rule of law, Congress, and rep-
resentatives of the American people. 
Neither 
Dan 
Scavino 
nor 
Peter 
Navarro has shown up in response to 
repeated 
congressional 
subpoenas. 
They have blown us off completely. 
Neither Mr. Scavino nor Mr. Navarro 
has produced a single document or of-
fered 1 minute of testimony in response 
to the subpoenas sent by the House of 
Representatives. 
While more than 800 Americans have 
come forward voluntarily or properly 
responded to congressional subpoenas, 
which are orders under penalty of law, 
saying you must show up to testify 
under oath and invoke any asserted 
privileges 
in 
person, 
Scavino 
and 
Navarro have followed Steve Bannon 
and are acting as if they are way too 
busy and way too important to bother 
with the mere United States House of 
Representatives. They think that hav-
ing worked for a former President of 
the United States excuses them from 
complying with lawful orders. 
This is clearly false; this is clearly 
wrong; and we must make an emphatic 
statement about it today. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask America to con-
sider this: If your son or daughter were 
subpoenaed to come testify before the 
Congress of the United States, would 
you advise them to sit home on the 
couch and blow it off? I know I 
wouldn’t. 
Every year, thousands of Americans 
are held in criminal contempt for ig-
noring their legal obligations to com-
ply with a lawful subpoena issued by 
courts or legislative bodies. 
Here in the District of Columbia, you 
can be sent to jail for 6 months and 
fined $1,000 for acting in contempt of a 
subpoena and not showing up. We have 
checked on multiple days and found, on 
any given day, 7, 8, 10, or a dozen peo-
ple are being found guilty of contempt 
in the courts of the District of Colum-
bia. 
That is the exact same criminal of-
fense 
that 
Mr. 
Scavino 
and 
Mr. 
Navarro committed, and that is the 
exact same penalty they are facing for 
their misconduct. 
Each of these witnesses was given 
ample and repeated opportunities to 
comply, opportunities that continue to 
this day. Yet, they openly and brazenly 
flout the authority of the Congress and 
mock their own personal duty to com-
ply with the rule of law. 
Legal contempt exists for those who 
act with open disregard or disobedience 
of the law, especially when acting with 
scorn for the authority of government. 
It exists precisely for cases like this. 
Here is what has happened with Mr. 
Scavino. In September of last year, the 
committee issued its first of three sub-
poenas. We asked him to come testify 
before us on October 15, 2021, last year. 
When he could not be found to actu-
ally accept service of the first sub-
poena, we issued a second subpoena, 
asking him to appear before the com-
mittee on October 28, 2021. He told the 
committee that wasn’t enough time for 
him; he needed 1 extra week. 
We generously gave him a week, and 
we set a third deposition date of No-
vember 4, 2021, but he didn’t come on 
November 4 either. Instead, he re-
quested another extension. 
Bending over backward to accommo-
date this witness, we set a fourth depo-
sition date of November 12, 2021. Still, 
that wasn’t enough time for him. 
We acted in good faith again, and as-
suming he was acting in good faith, we 
set a fifth deposition date of November 
19. When that day arrived, did he fi-
nally show up to do his civic duty? No, 
he did not. Instead, he waited until the 
eve of the deposition and then, for the 
first time, challenged the service of the 
subpoena. 
Out of an abundance of deference and 
caution, and to make every effort to 
demonstrate the respect for the rule of 
law that Scavino was not showing, we 
issued yet a third subpoena inviting 
him to come testify before us once 
again on December 1, 2021. 
Finally, with Scavino completely out 
of excuses and the committee out of 
patience, his final deposition date of 
December 1 arrived, and he simply did 
not show up. 
Six times this committee invited 
Scavino to testify, and six times he 
stood us up. He stood the American 
people up. He refused to testify before 
Congress about what he knows about 
the most dangerous and sweeping as-
sault on the United States Congress 
since the War of 1812, which was by a 
foreign power. 
But even after he failed to show up in 
December, the committee held an open 
door for Mr. Scavino to come in and

testify. But in the more than 6 months 
since the committee’s first subpoena 
was sent to him, he has never once 
come in to speak with us. He has not 
given us a single document, Mr. Speak-
er. 
It is the same basic story with Mr. 
Navarro. On February 9, we issued him 
a subpoena to produce documents on 
February 23 and to testify on March 2. 
There have been repeated evasions and 
contortions by the witness since then. 
Generous accommodations have been 
offered by the committee, all of it lead-
ing to nothing but his open contempt 
and mockery for this process and for 
the rule of law. He never showed up, 
and he never produced a single docu-
ment. 
When more than 800 Americans have 
voluntarily testified and complied with 
the subpoenas rendered by our com-
mittee, the witnesses have nothing but 
excuses for their noncompliance, ex-
cuses you would not accept from a 
teenage child. 
Navarro says he wants us to send him 
written interrogatories, and he will an-
swer his questions in writing. Wouldn’t 
that be nice? Any witness to a car acci-
dent, a murder, an assault, or an insur-
rection in the land would love not to 
have to answer actual questions under 
sworn oath, but that is not how our 
system works. 
The word ‘‘subpoena’’ means ‘‘under 
the penalty of law.’’ ‘‘Sub’’ means 
under; ‘‘poena’’ means ‘‘penalty of 
law.’’ Under the penalty of law, you 
show up and you answer questions in 
the United States of America. If you 
think you have a legal privilege excus-
ing you from answering questions, you 
assert your privileges under oath, at 
the time of questioning that you show 
up, to specific questions, whether it is 
the attorney-client privilege; the Fifth 
Amendment privilege against self-in-
crimination, which a number of wit-
nesses have asserted before our com-
mittee, as it is their legal right to do; 
the priest-penitent privilege; or the ex-
ecutive privilege. 
The Court has been clear. The Su-
preme Court has been clear. If you 
think you have one of these privileges, 
you show up and you assert it to the 
specific questions being asked to you. 
But the privilege against self-incrimi-
nation, the executive privilege, the 
marital privilege, none of these is a 
magic wand that you can wave from 
your sofa and not show up under a sub-
poena to a lawful proceeding. 
But Navarro continues to mutter the 
words ‘‘executive privilege,’’ as if it is 
some kind of magic wand that would 
keep him from ever having to testify 
about anything, like Harry Potter’s in-
visibility cloak. He even says, repeat-
edly, the executive privilege is not 
mine to waive, which is high comedy, 
Mr. Speaker, because it is not his to 
waive, which means, by definition, it is 
not his to invoke in the first place. 
We know it is not his to invoke. The 
Supreme Court has been clear about 
this, too. The executive privilege be-
longs to the President of the United 
States of America, the actual Presi-
dent. President Biden has specifically 
decided not to invoke executive privi-
lege in Navarro’s case or in Scavino’s 
case. 
Yet, Navarro says the executive 
privilege here belongs to ex-President 
Donald Trump, which is not only ex-
tremely dubious but totally irrelevant. 
It is dubious because the Supreme 
Court just rejected a claim by Donald 
Trump himself, in Trump v. Thompson, 
that his materials were protected from 
disclosure to the January 6th Select 
Committee in Congress by executive 
privilege. 
Even if Trump were still the Presi-
dent, the Court essentially said there is 
an overwhelming public interest in 
these materials that dwarfs whatever 
dubious interest in executive secrecy 
may linger. So the claim would fail, 
even if President Joe Biden were him-
self here to assert it on behalf of 
Navarro and Scavino. 
But 
Navarro’s 
attempt 
to 
stand 
above the law by mentioning Donald 
Trump’s name is also completely irrel-
evant. Why? Everyone, please take 
note of this: Because Donald Trump 
has never even asserted the executive 
privilege to cover Peter Navarro, not 
once. We have received no communica-
tion from Donald Trump, either di-
rectly or indirectly from Navarro, 
showing that Trump is trying to exer-
cise 
an 
executive 
privilege 
claim, 
which is doomed to failure anyway 
under the logic of the decision just ren-
dered by the Supreme Court. 
Mr. Speaker, so what do we have? 
Two guys in the District of Columbia 
blowing off a congressional investiga-
tion and subpoenas into a deadly insur-
rection, which caused multiple deaths; 
inflicted brutal, savage injuries on 150 
of our officers, who ended up with bro-
ken jaws, necks, vertebrae, noses, trau-
matic brain injuries, post-traumatic 
stress syndrome; and interrupted Con-
gress from executing its constitutional 
duties of counting electoral college 
votes for the very first time in Amer-
ican history—oh, yes. And it nearly 
succeeded in overthrowing the 2020 
Presidential election and toppling the 
peaceful transfer of power, perhaps for 
all time, as United States District 
Court Judge Carter wrote in a blis-
tering opinion last week, rejecting this 
exact same and equally ridiculous 
claim of John Eastman, who helped 
cook up the absurd legal camouflage 
for this attempted coup in the first 
place against the American constitu-
tional system of government. 
The gentlewoman, I think, said some-
thing about the Russian hoax or Rus-
sian collusion. I accept the heckling, 
Mr. Speaker. That is all right because 
if she wants to continue to stand with 
Vladimir Putin and his brutal, bloody 
invasion against the people of Ukraine, 
she is free to do so. 
We understand there is a strong 
Trump-Putin 
axis 
in 
the 
gentle-
woman’s party. If she wants to con-
tinue to stand with Vladimir Putin and 
Donald Trump, that is her prerogative, 
but please do it on her own time forth-
with. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1330 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman from Mary-
land for yielding me the customary 30 
minutes, and I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today 
provides for consideration of a resolu-
tion holding Peter Navarro and Daniel 
Scavino in contempt of Congress. 
From the very beginning, the select 
committee has been nothing more than 
a partisan tool used by House Demo-
crats to attack their political oppo-
nents. Time and time again, they have 
run roughshod over our Constitution 
and they have run roughshod over the 
very rules of this institution. And to 
what end? To advance their own polit-
ical agenda. 
We need look no further than the res-
olution establishing the committee to 
see their complete disregard for this 
Chamber. House Resolution 503 states 
the Speaker shall appoint 13 members, 
five of whom shall be appointed after 
consultation with minority leaders. 
Neither of those ‘‘shall’’ clauses have 
been met. 
While this may seem insignificant to 
my colleagues across the aisle, it is 
certainly of consequence to the courts. 
Let’s talk about some case law. 
Yellin v. United States. There the 
Court reversed the conviction of con-
tempt of Congress because a congres-
sional committee failed to adhere to 
its own rules. The Court explained, 
‘‘The committee prepared the ground-
work for prosecution in Yellin’s case 
meticulously.’’ Yet, ‘‘It is not too ex-
acting to require that the committee 
be equally meticulous in obeying its 
own rules.’’ I suggest to my Demo-
cratic colleagues, heed those words. 
As a former Navy JAG, I am deeply 
troubled by the committee’s treatment 
of Mr. Scavino, including clear due 
process violations. The select com-
mittee repeatedly demanded almost 
immediate responses from Mr. Scavino, 
while waiting for weeks—weeks—to 
provide responses to his correspond-
ence. 
Further, the select committee has 
shown 
complete 
disregard 
for 
Mr. 
Scavino’s legal duty, his legal duty to 
invoke the executive privilege, which 
he was instructed to do by President 
Trump. There is no legal authority 
that the incumbent President is the 
final arbiter as to whether executive 
privilege may be asserted for congres-
sional testimony of close aides to a 
former President. 
The Presidential Records Act applies 
only to Presidential records within 
control of the National Archives. That 
is it. It is a very narrow statute. That 
act does not control whether testimony 
can be given.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4218 
April 6, 2022 
Let’s talk about some more case law. 
United States v. Nixon. The Supreme 
Court held in that case, ‘‘Communica-
tions between a President and his clos-
est aides are entitled to a presumption 
of privilege of confidentiality which 
can be overcome only by a particular-
ized showing of a need in a criminal 
case.’’ I want to emphasize criminal 
case. This is not a criminal case. 
Finally, the select committee ini-
tially provided Mr. Scavino with 15 
topics which they wanted to discuss. 
That list later grew to 33. The select 
committee then went so far as to place 
the onus on Mr. Scavino, saying that it 
is his responsibility to ‘‘identify the 
specific topics outside the scope of his 
asserted privilege.’’ 
As I am sure my friend across the 
aisle knows, and any lawyer on the 
other side of the aisle knows, the bur-
den is not on the subject of the deposi-
tion to identify the topics on which 
they can be questioned. The Supreme 
Court found—and here is some more 
case law—in Watkins v. United States, 
the Supreme Court found in that case, 
‘‘ . . . a person compelled to testify is 
entitled to have knowledge of the sub-
ject to which the interrogation is 
deemed pertinent. . . . ‘’ 
If the select committee wanted to 
conduct a legitimate investigation, 
they would not be rushing to hold Mr. 
Scavino in contempt after imposing 
unreasonable 
and 
unattainable 
timelines, ignoring legitimate asser-
tions of a privilege, and then refusing 
legitimate accommodations. 
It is clear the resolution before us 
today is not about a witness’ refusal to 
testify or refusing to comply with a 
congressional subpoena. This is all 
about Democrats’ need to further their 
partisan agenda. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
the previous question and vote ‘‘no’’ on 
the rule. Madam Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
This is not a partisan investigation. 
We were created under House Resolu-
tion 503 after, I am afraid, the gen-
tleman and his colleagues voted to 
thwart 
a 
totally 
bipartisan, 
inde-
pendent outside commission made up 
of five Democrats and five Republicans 
with equal subpoena power simply be-
cause Donald Trump exercised his veto 
within the Republican Party; the same 
Donald Trump who calls the madman, 
mass murderer, Vladimir Putin, a ge-
nius, but we know we have some people 
echoing all of Trump’s complicity with 
Vladimir Putin from the Georgia dele-
gation back there. 
This is a bipartisan committee. It is 
the only committee I am aware of that 
has a Democratic chair in a Demo-
cratic-controlled House of Representa-
tives and a Republican vice chair, Ms. 
CHENEY, who was the head of the GOP 
Conference. She was the head of the 
House Republican Conference, now the 
vice chair of this committee, and they 
call it a partisan exercise. 
The second point I need to make is 
that executive privilege must be as-
serted by the President. This one isn’t 
even asserted by the former President. 
It is just somebody going in and say-
ing, ‘‘I have got an executive privi-
lege.’’ 
Is that really the precedent that my 
colleagues want to set, Madam Speak-
er? I mean, that is pretty astonishing if 
that is the position that they are tak-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. SCANLON), my very distinguished 
colleague. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, it 
has been said before, but ours is a 
country of laws, not men, and in our 
democratic Republic, the voters choose 
who leads, not a dictator, and not a 
monarch. 
But in the wake of the 2020 election, 
a small group of people decided to re-
ject the rule of law and the will of the 
voters. They rejected the unanimous 
conclusion of the courts, the Depart-
ment of Justice, Homeland Security, 
and law enforcement and election offi-
cials across the country. They tried to 
pervert the law and throw away the 
free choice of the people. On January 6, 
their plan almost worked. 
As the select committee investigates 
what happened that day, and how it 
can be prevented from ever happening 
again, over 800 witnesses have come in 
to share what they know because that 
is what should happen in a country 
ruled by law. 
Only a handful of people, all of them 
in the former President’s inner circle, 
have refused to obey the subpoenas. 
Their baseless claims that they are im-
mune have been rejected by the actual 
President, by Congress, and by the 
courts. These entitled few have refused 
to honor Congress’ subpoenas, just like 
they rejected the results of the elec-
tion, because they believe they are 
above the law. They are not. 
That is why it is so important that 
we pass this rule and the underlying 
bill and hold those in defiance of these 
subpoenas in contempt, because their 
conduct is not just unlawful and unpa-
triotic, it is contemptible. 
Our Constitution, not any person, is 
what makes our country great. Nobody 
is above the law, and certainly nobody 
is above the Constitution. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support 
the rule and its underlying legislation, 
and I urge all my colleagues who truly 
love 
the 
country 
more 
than 
performative antics to do the same. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
My good friend from Maryland was 
talking about some case law. I will 
talk case law all day. Here are three 
real fast: 
Quinn v. United States. The Supreme 
Court said that Congress cannot issue a 
subpoena for law enforcement purpose. 
Watkins v. United States. Congress 
has no authority to issue a subpoena to 
compel exposure for the sake of expo-
sure. 
McGrain v. Daugherty. Congress may 
not issue a subpoena in an attempt to 
try someone before a committee for 
any crime of wrongdoing. 
I have ample case law up here that 
will show, at the very best, for my 
friends across the aisle that case law is 
unsettled, but it is very likely on the 
side of Mr. Scavino and Mr. Navarro. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
HERRELL) for the purpose of a unani-
mous consent request. 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to ask unanimous consent to call 
up H.R. 471, the PAUSE Act, to protect 
all Americans from Biden’s border cri-
sis. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). The Chair would advise 
that all time has been yielded for the 
purpose of debate. 
Does the gentleman from Maryland 
yield for purposes of this unanimous 
consent? 
Mr. RASKIN. No, I don’t yield for 
that purpose, which is an extraneous 
and irrelevant distraction from the res-
olution. All time yielded is for the pur-
poses of debate only. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland does not yield; 
therefore, the unanimous consent re-
quest cannot be entertained.

Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. MCCAR-
THY), the Republican leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, 
two wrongs don’t make a right. 
Let me be clear: the riot on January 
6 was wrong. Any violence on that day 
should be punished, as I have said be-
fore. 
But make no mistake: the Demo-
crats’ response is also wrong. 
For 15 months, Democrats have used 
January 6 as a blank check to trample 
on 
civil 
rights 
and 
congressional 
norms. 
They broke every rule, violated every 
norm, bullied every skeptic simply to 
hold on to power. 
Let’s be honest: this is a political 
show trial. 
The committee has sent hundreds of 
subpoenas to private citizens for phone 
records, bank records, and private com-
munications. 
To those who invoked their right to 
due process, Chairman THOMPSON re-
plied, ‘‘ . . . you are part and parcel 
guilty to what occurred.’’ 
What a disgusting betrayal of the 
Constitution and the Bill of Rights. 
But think for a second about what 
Chairman THOMPSON is saying. If you 
question his authority, if you disobey 
his demands, then you are a criminal 
and you should be punished. 
Congresswoman LURIA, who is also on 
the select committee agrees. Last 
week, she criticized Attorney General 
Garland for not putting her political 
opponents in jail fast enough. She told 
Garland, ‘‘ . . . do your job so we can 
do ours.’’ 
I am sure some Members got real ex-
cited by that. 
Democrats are using the power of the 
Federal Government to jail their polit-
ical opponents and threatening the At-
torney General for not doing it fast 
enough. 
In their twisted view, this agreement 
is immoral. Dissent is a crime. And 
they are to be obeyed without ques-
tion. 
Today’s resolution is also about 
criminalizing dissent. 
I can pause, Mr. Speaker, if he needs 
to listen more. 
Mr. RASKIN. I am sorry? 
Mr. MCCARTHY. I was going to tell 
Mr. Speaker if the House is not in 
order, and you need to listen to staff, I 
can pause. 
Mr. RASKIN. Are you yielding? 
Mr. MCCARTHY. No. I said to Mr. 
Speaker, the House is not in order.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4223 
April 6, 2022 
There was no yielding. Your staff is 
continuing to communicate. 
I think if I am speaking, the House 
should be in order. I don’t know if that 
is a criminal offense, too. 
Mr. RASKIN. You have not been 
heckled by any of our Members, while 
I was heckled by—— 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I have 
the time. You have the gavel. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
COURTNEY). The gentleman from Cali-
fornia is recognized. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, the 
House is not in order. He has not been 
recognized. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
House will be in order. The gentleman 
from California is recognized. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, for the 
House to be in order, should people be 
in their seats, or should people be talk-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman may proceed. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, the 
House is not in order. People are stand-
ing and talking. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
House will be in order. The gentleman 
from California is recognized. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, to-
day’s resolution is about criminalizing 
dissent. 
Democrats are threatening to throw 
in jail a good man who has done noth-
ing but attempt to follow the law sim-
ply because he is President Trump’s 
closest aid. 
Mr. Scavino does not deserve that. 
He tried to cooperate with the select 
committee’s requests. He sent timely 
letters to the committee to clarify the 
vague scope of the requested testi-
mony. 
He even offered to answer the com-
mittee’s questions in writing, which 
the committee’s rules allow for, so he 
could balance cooperation with fair 
concerns about executive privilege. 
But the committee rejected every 
compromise. It is their way or no way. 
It took them 2 months to reply to 
Mr. Scavino’s letter, then another 6 
weeks. Then they rushed to hold him in 
contempt. 
They also demanded the right to ask 
any question they wanted, including on 
topics that have nothing to do with 
protecting the Capitol, like the 25th 
Amendment. 
Even if you agree that the select 
committee has a legislative purpose, 
the fact is that purpose is not unlim-
ited. 
The committee must identify a spe-
cific nexus between its legislative pur-
pose and the information it wants. But 
it never identified the nexus for the in-
formation it was seeking from Mr. 
Scavino. 
And I bet it won’t identify that nexus 
today either. Why? Because the nexus 
does not exist. 
Without it, their subpoena is invalid. 
Congressional oversight is supposed 
to inform the legislative process and 
must have a valid legislative purpose. 
It is not there so the swamp can bully 
its political enemies. 
Let’s be honest. Mr. Scavino never 
acted like he was above the law, and 
anyone who says otherwise is wrong. If 
anyone has acted like they are above 
the law, it is the Select Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, two 
wrongs don’t make a right. 
The riot on January 6 was wrong, but 
Democrats’ reaction to trample Amer-
ican civil liberties is also wrong. 
Do we really want to live in a coun-
try where politicians can seize your 
phone records, compel your testimony, 
and ignore your rights because they 
disagree with your politics? 
Most Americans don’t want to live in 
a country like that. 
That happens in Russia, in Com-
munist China, in North Korea. It 
should never happen in America. 
But, Mr. Speaker, under one-party 
rule, it is. But to all Americans, when 
we take back the House, it will stop. 
b 1415 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
More than 800 Americans have come 
to testify before our committee, the 
minority leader should be notified be-
fore he leaves the Chamber. Four of 
them have categorically refused and 
blown off the subpoenas of the U.S. 
House of Representatives. 
The minority leader attacks our 
committee as partisan and political, as 
some of his colleagues do. Well, we are 
a bipartisan committee with a Demo-
cratic chair and Republican vice chair. 
But today, the minority leader gave 
the game away as he boiled over with 
rage toward our committee. He gave 
the game away. He is very upset that 
the former chair of the House Repub-
lican Conference has been telling the 
truth about Donald Trump’s big lie, his 
incitement of violent insurrection, and 
the attack on American constitutional 
democracy. 
And that is why he is in the very em-
barrassing position of having sup-
ported, offered, and pressed for an inde-
pendent, 9/11-style commission about 
the January 6 attack. And as the mi-
nority leader, he asked for five Repub-
licans and five Democrats. He asked for 
equal subpoena power on both sides, 
equal staff on both sides. 
And Chairman THOMPSON, who now 
chairs the January 6th Select Com-
mittee and chairs the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee, he agreed to it. A lot 
of Democrats were upset about that. 
They said, we are in the majority. Why 
should we agree to have everything 50/ 
50, right down the middle? But he 
agreed, and the Democrats agreed, be-
cause that is what the Republicans of-
fered. 
Great. We were going to have a 9/11- 
style independent commission. 
And then you know what happened? 
You know who vetoed it? The fourth 
branch of government, Donald Trump, 
who some of their Members slavishly 
report to like sycophants. 
And Donald Trump said he didn’t 
want any investigation into the attack 
on this body, the Congress of the 
United States. He didn’t want any in-
vestigation at all. 
And you know what the minority 
leader did? He walked it back. They 
pulled the plug on the independent 
commission, and that is why we ended 
up with the January 6th Select Com-
mittee in the House of Representatives, 
which the Speaker has made sure is bi-
partisan and has operated, in my expe-
rience, Mr. Speaker, as the most bipar-
tisan committee I have ever been on. 
Why? Because we don’t spend an hour 
at the beginning of each meeting with 
a bunch of empty partisan gimmicks 
and stunts; the kind we just saw, wast-
ing the taxpayers’ money and time; 20 
minutes of that nonsense going no-
where; at the same time that there is 
an actual hearing taking place in Can-
non 310, right now, by the Committee 
on Homeland Security, on the question 
of the border. 
But instead of attending the hearing, 
I counted at least five or six different 
Members who were in that conga line. 
I will be interested to know whether 
they are even going to go to the hear-
ing afterwards. Instead, they come and 
participate in that empty, absurd rit-
ual, wasting the time of this body. 
But the minority leader comes here 
and, 
amazingly, 
attacks 
our 
com-
mittee, when he sabotaged his own 
idea. But this committee is closing in 
on the truth, and that is why we get all 
these circus antics and all the at-
tempts to distract the American peo-
ple. 
Mr. Speaker, if I had been dealt the 
hand that my friend from Pennsylvania 
has been dealt today, as a lawyer, as a 
Member of Congress, I suppose I would 
have done everything in my power to 
distract the House of Representatives 
also from the business at hand. 
We have two people who are fla-
grantly, brazenly defying the authority 
of the House of Representatives of the 
United States in order to avoid coming 
here to tell the truth. They are acting 
in contempt of Congress, and we must 
hold them in contempt of Congress be-
cause of that. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
To my colleague from Maryland, I 
will argue this case any day of the 
week, and I think that, ultimately, 
this will be resolved by the courts. I 
have got stacks, like I said, of case law 
to support my argument. 
But to call what you just saw absurd, 
or a waste of time, I don’t think the 
American people think it is absurd to 
care about the crisis at our southern 
border; the amount of illegal immi-
grants coming across the border; the 
amount of fentanyl that is coming 
across the border that is literally kill-
ing people in the interior. 
Let’s look at some numbers on this. 
Just last week, the CBP confirmed

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4224 
April 6, 2022 
more than 300,000 illegal immigrants 
evaded Border Patrol, just in the last 6 
months alone. 
Alarmingly, Border Patrol warned 
that the Biden border crisis is already 
worsening in anticipation of the ad-
ministration’s rollback of title 42. 
You just heard 68 Republicans, plus 
the Republican leader, request to con-
sider legislation that will provide for 
stringent enforcement of title 42, which 
allows illegal immigrants to be quickly 
expelled from the United States. 
But clearly, House Democrats aren’t 
concerned about the biggest migration 
crisis our Nation has ever faced. So 
let’s try this another way. 
If we defeat the previous question, I 
will personally offer an amendment to 
the rule to immediately consider H.R. 
471, the PAUSE Act of 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment into the RECORD, along with any 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote for the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, here to explain the amendment is 
the bill’s author. I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. HERRELL), my good friend. 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
oppose the previous question so that 
we can immediately consider my bill, 
H.R. 471, the PAUSE Act, which pre-
vents the introduction of new COVID 
cases, as well as other infectious dis-
eases, from our land and sea borders 
with Canada and Mexico. 
This was the very first bill I intro-
duced when I came to Congress, and re-
cent events have proved it to be the 
most important ever. 
Just this week, The New York Times 
warned readers to prepare for a new 
wave of COVID. We also can prepare for 
a new wave of migrants, about 18,000 a 
day, when they take title 42 away. 
The Biden administration has con-
sistently advocated mandates, mask-
ing, lockdowns, and other extreme 
measures on our American citizens. 
Yet, they ignore the single biggest dan-
ger for the new wave of COVID to rav-
age America: unvetted, untested illegal 
aliens who are allowed to flood our 
southern border, unhindered. 
The Biden border crisis has exploded 
after 1 year under this President. His 
administration demonizes the men and 
women of Border Patrol and ICE, re-
fuses to enforce immigration law or en-
hance border security, and allows hun-
dreds of thousands of illegal immi-
grants to disappear into the mainland 
without vetting. 
There were 165,000 encounters at our 
southern border in February, and we 
are on track to hit 2 million in fiscal 
year 2022. 
Despite this clear and present danger 
to the people of the United States and 
the integrity of our borders, the Biden 
administration still seeks to throw 
away the few tools available to fix the 
situation, like remain in Mexico and 
title 42. 
Title 42 has been an effective con-
tainment and mitigation strategy, re-
sulting in the reduced introduction of 
COVID–19 into the U.S. from outside 
our borders, by making it easier to 
turn away illegal aliens traveling from 
or through countries with continuing 
COVID cases. 
My PAUSE Act would keep title 42 in 
place until: All State and Federal man-
dates, requirements, and limitations 
related to COVID end; all public health 
emergencies for COVID are over; and 
the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention reduces the traveler health 
risk level for Canada and Mexico to 
level 1, which they are currently level 
3. 
Eliminating title 42 at this point is 
reckless and harmful to our national 
security and our communities. It will 
lead to more illegal immigration, more 
drugs, and more hardship on everyday 
Americans. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
PAUSE Act, preserve title 42, and 
stand up to protect both the health and 
borders of the American people. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I wanted to go back to something 
else that the minority leader said in 
echo of the minority floor leader’s 
points. 
They cling to the suggestion that 
there is no valid legislative purpose 
being conducted by the January 6th Se-
lect Committee; and they also say it is 
unlawfully composed. 
Well, that has been rejected by sev-
eral courts. In fact, all of the argu-
ments that they are making have been 
rejected by the courts. I don’t think 
they have won a single case in court 
yet. 
But check out Budowich v. Pelosi 
with Judge Boasberg, or Eastman v. 
Thompson, where these courts said, not 
only is there a valid legislative pur-
pose, but this is the quintessential leg-
islative purpose; that is, guaranteeing 
the preservation of democratic self- 
government. If it is not a valid legisla-
tive purpose to investigate violent at-
tacks, insurrections, and attempted 
coups against the government of the 
United States, then what is a valid pur-
pose? The courts have said, the courts 
have got that right. They have written 
opinions. 
I guess we are going to have to send 
a copy to the minority leader because 
he is apparently oblivious to it. 
But even without the courts slapping 
down everything they are saying over 
there, just think about it. Would they 
really want to say that if there are vio-
lent attacks taking place against the 
Capitol we can’t investigate it? 
The Eastman decision also rejected 
the claim that we are somehow unlaw-
fully composed. 
I have got to say something on behalf 
of Representative LIZ CHENEY, who I 
probably disagree with on 90 percent of 
the issues we vote on here. But she was 
just maligned and castigated by the 
minority leader in an utterly unfair 
way. 
She has operated with nothing but 
patriotism for this country and con-
stitutional patriotism for the rule of 
law and the processes that define us. 
And they can overthrow her as the 
head of their caucus because she 
doesn’t bow down on the altar of Don-
ald Trump and Vladimir Putin the way 
that the gentlewoman from Georgia 
was heckling me does. And they can at-
tack her because she thinks for herself 
and doesn’t act like a cult member. 
But we won’t do that, even though we 
disagree with her on a lot of issues, but 
she is a constitutional patriot, and I 
feel she is owed an apology. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Ben Shapiro says the ‘‘facts don’t 
care about your feelings,’’ and they 
don’t. And I will say this: The case law 
doesn’t care about what your political 
position is. 
So if you want to talk about more 
case law, how about Trump v. Thomp-
son, 2022, Justice Kavanaugh ruled: ‘‘A 
former President must be able to suc-
cessfully invoke the Presidential com-
munications privilege for communica-
tions that occurred during his Presi-
dency, even if the current President 
does not support the privilege claim.’’ 
I have got more and more case law 
that I could produce. But let’s just go 
back to the fact that this select com-
mittee is a partisan political hit job. If 
this really had a legitimate legislative 
function, then let me ask you this: 
Where are the subpoenas for the former 
House Sergeant at Arms and the 
former head of the D.C. National 
Guard? We haven’t seen those sub-
poenas. 
What about questions and subpoenas 
that are designed to elicit information 
about why this Capitol was left unpre-
pared and how to prevent it from hap-
pening again? That would be a legiti-
mate legislative function. 
What we are seeing is this committee 
masquerading as if it is some kind of 
grand jury, which is wholly inappro-
priate and a violation of the separation 
of powers. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from the great State of 
Texas (Mr. ROY), to talk more about 
this. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend from Pennsylvania for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the previous question. The gentleman 
from Maryland, my friend, raised some 
issues about saying that we are wast-
ing time when we have stunts, he 
called them, I think, or I am para-
phrasing. 
So here I am, and I am going to be 
talking 
about 
an 
important 
issue 
which, I assume, might be labeled as a

April 6, 2022 
stunt, to say that I oppose the previous 
question because there is something for 
me that is so critical and so existential 
to the people I represent in the State of 
Texas and to the people across this 
country, which is the decision by the 
CDC, in conjunction with the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security Secretary, 
and the President of the United States, 
to end title 42 enforcement on the bor-
der of the United States. 
Now, our mutual colleague and friend 
who was in the chair, and the Speaker 
from Texas, Ms. JACKSON LEE, who is 
on the Judiciary Committee, raised the 
issue about the imminent harm that 
may befall us because of the continued 
and new strains of COVID in April. 
Well, if that is true, why would the 
CDC say that we should stop enforce-
ment of title 42 at our border? 
We have 8,000 people a day coming 
across the border of the United States 
and being apprehended; 8,000. Half of 
those are being turned away under title 
42. The estimates by Border Patrol ex-
perts are that those numbers will swell 
to over 10,000, maybe as high as 15 to 
18,000, when you get to the summer 
months. 
And when that happens, and you stop 
enforcing title 42, then all of those in-
dividuals will be released into the 
United States. 
b 1430 
That is a major problem because it is 
not just the numbers themselves; it is 
the consequences. When Border Patrol 
is processing individuals because of the 
failed policies of the administration, it 
means that you have, as we saw last 
year, half a million people who were 
known got-aways because Border Pa-
trol is now at the locations to process 
individuals. 
Then you have known got-aways, 
which means you have massive num-
bers of people coming here with crimi-
nal records from places all over the 
world, 150 to 160 countries, including 
dangerous individuals from known ter-
rorist states. 
The point here is that we have legis-
lation for this body, the people’s 
House, to require title 42 to be en-
forced. YVETTE HERRELL, my colleague 
from New Mexico, introduced that last 
February. I filed a discharge petition 
for that bill last April because, for the 
people watching at home, the Speaker 
of the House controls the floor, and my 
Democratic 
colleagues 
control 
the 
floor. The only way we have power to 
change that is through a discharge pe-
tition. We have 211 signatures. We have 
all Republicans, I think save maybe 
one, who have signed the discharge pe-
tition. 
We are asking our Democratic col-
leagues to join us in defense of the 
United States to call up this discharge 
petition so we can have a debate on 
title 42 and securing the border of the 
United States, which is what that 
conga line was all about: trying to pro-
tect our country. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, before the gentleman 
goes, I want to tell the gentleman from 
Texas that I would never accuse him of 
performing a stunt. I was referring to 
the people who should have been in the 
Homeland Security Committee hearing 
actually dealing with the issue they 
profess to be talking about here on the 
floor under completely different aus-
pices. 
Let me go back to the questions of-
fered by my distinguished friend from 
Pennsylvania who said, well, if they 
really did have a valid legislative pur-
pose, as all these courts are saying, 
then they would be talking to the 
former Sergeant at Arms—well, we 
have—and we would be talking to the 
National Guard—we have. 
Somebody is going to have to dust off 
the talking points over on that side be-
cause we have heard from more than 
800 people who were involved. 
This has nothing to do with any kind 
of ideological witch hunt; this has to 
do with an assault on American demo-
cratic institutions. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 31⁄2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK). 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I am 
here today to rise in support of order-
ing the previous question on Congress-
woman HERRELL’s bill, the SHIELD 
Act, that would stop the Biden admin-
istration from ending title 42, the very 
necessary public health order used by 
CBP officials at the southwest border. 
Since President Biden took office in 
January of last year, Customs and Bor-
der Protection have encountered over 2 
million 
illegal 
immigrants 
at 
the 
southern border. This number is more 
than at any other time during the 
Trump administration and still con-
tinues to astonish those of us who have 
actually visited the border to see what 
is happening there. 
Unlike the trafficker in chief, who 
would rather retreat to his beach house 
in Delaware than face the American 
people, or the so-called border czar, 
who visited El Paso once and figured 
that that was good enough, I myself 
have been to the border three times to 
see this crisis for myself. In fact, over 
70 percent of my Republican colleagues 
have been to see the tragic crisis un-
folding there. 
As a member of the Homeland Secu-
rity Committee, I have followed this 
issue from the very beginning and have 
feared the very day when title 42 would 
be rescinded for political purposes. 
Speaking of political purposes, I find 
it exceptionally hypocritical that this 
very Chamber is still utilizing proxy 
voting under the guise of a public 
health concern. In fact, on March 29, 
the Speaker extended proxy voting 
through May 14 of this year because of 
‘‘the ongoing public health crisis.’’ 
It is curious that the Speaker doesn’t 
seem to think that our own border 
being overrun by 2 million undocu-
mented people has no bearing on the 
safety of the general American public, 
but a Congress of 435 Members with an 
80 percent vaccination rate seems to 
qualify for an ‘‘ongoing public health 
crisis.’’ That, to me, screams hypoc-
risy. 
Furthermore, there are Members of 
this Chamber who have been voting 
‘‘present’’ via proxy. The hypocrisy and 
the irony are not lost on me nor the 
American people, Mr. Speaker. 
Additionally, every single one of my 
colleagues who decided to show up here 
today had to wear a mask to get on a 
plane. That mandate is still in place 
due to the ongoing public health crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, we have two very clear 
instances here in this Chamber where 
the ‘‘ongoing public health crisis’’ is 
used as a justification for policy deci-
sions. Why not the safety, then, for all 
Americans and our communities across 
this country by securing the border? 
Why not uphold and keep title 42 in 
place? 
If you have ever spoken to a CBP of-
ficer or a Border Patrol agent, they 
will tell you that title 42 is necessary, 
that ending it will send even more peo-
ple to the southern border. It is a mag-
net. 
Ending it will prolong the crisis. It 
will grow the crisis. It will once and for 
all put an end to national security as 
we know it. 
Take it from the wife of a first re-
sponder who deals with this crisis 
every single day. I have had dozens of 
Border Patrol agents text and call me 
the last few days, begging for help to 
hold the line on title 42. They have 
said: Please, Congress, hold the line on 
title 42. It must be protected because it 
is the only policy in place currently 
that, in the slightest, will slow this 
surge that we have watched grow be-
fore our eyes. 
If you stand with our Border Patrol 
agents, if you stand with the American 
people, if you give a damn about our 
communities, then you will support the 
SHIELD Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. KATKO), the rank-
ing member of the Homeland Security 
Committee. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the previous 
question and in support of H.R. 471, the 
Protecting Americans from Unneces-
sary Spread upon Entry from COVID–19 
Act, the PAUSE Act. 
This week, I joined Leader MCCARTHY 
and several of my colleagues at a meet-
ing with the National Border Patrol 
Council, representatives of 18,000 mem-
bers of the Border Patrol, to discuss 
the crisis at the southern border. 
Just as we predicted, the number of 
daily 
border 
encounters 
has 
been 
trending dramatically upward since

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4226 
April 6, 2022 
President Biden took office in 2021. The 
administration has created an unten-
able situation from which it may take 
several years, at a minimum, to re-
cover. 
The irresponsible decision to roll 
back Title 42, the Public Health and 
Welfare authority; the halting of bor-
der wall construction; the lack of sup-
port for frontline law enforcement per-
sonnel; the undermining of the Migrant 
Protection Protocols; and the total ab-
sence of a long-term border security 
plan of any sort have only made mat-
ters worse. 
The U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion is now seeing over 7,000 encounters 
daily, and the Department of Homeland 
Security is said to be bracing for a sig-
nificant mass influx of nearly 18,000 mi-
grants daily when title 42 ends. That is 
absolutely an untenable situation. 
As the U.S. finally gets a handle on 
managing the spread of new variants 
and moves steadily toward a post-pan-
demic recovery, now is not the time to 
end the use of title 42 and jeopardize all 
that progress, especially as numerous 
countries continue to struggle with the 
rapid spread of COVID–19 and strength-
ening variants. 
The very purpose of title 42 is to pre-
vent the introduction of dangerous 
communicable diseases into American 
communities. We should be doubling 
down on protecting our communities 
and economy from these threats, not 
weakening them. 
Our border security and immigration 
system cannot handle any more pull 
factors, as the Biden administration 
has proven unwilling to secure our 
southern border. As we are witnessing, 
the administration continues to strip 
every tool for managing the border cri-
sis away from frontline law enforce-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield an additional 30 seconds to 
the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. 
KATKO. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
transnational criminal organizations 
and drug cartels are taking full advan-
tage by highlighting the weak border 
security posture of the administration 
while profiting from this crisis. The ad-
ministration continues to roll back 
commonsense border security meas-
ures, thereby feeding into a false nar-
rative for would-be migrants and en-
couraging them to come to the United 
States to seek asylum. 
Many migrants who make this dan-
gerous journey to the United States 
will not be eligible under the Federal 
law for asylum, forcing them to seek 
other ways to enter the United States. 
We know for a fact that cartels con-
trol who crosses the U.S.-Mexico bor-
der. They charge migrants exorbitant 
fees knowing that some will never be 
able to repay, leading many of the mi-
grants with only one option: to work 
off their fees. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has again ex-
pired. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield an additional 30 seconds to 
the gentleman from New York. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, this work 
often leads them into a trafficking sit-
uation here in the United States. 
Drugs, 
such 
as 
fentanyl, 
meth-
amphetamine, and other fentanyl-laced 
drugs, are pouring across the southern 
border and destroying our communities 
and ending the lives of thousands of 
Americans every year. This year alone, 
for the first time, more than 100,000 
Americans died of drug overdoses. That 
is directly related to the border. It has 
to stop. 
I appreciate the focus of my col-
leagues on this critical homeland secu-
rity issue, especially my colleague 
from New Mexico, who knows firsthand 
the impact the border crisis is having 
on our communities. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, before the gentleman 
leaves, I want to say a word about the 
distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York. We are all blessed to have Mr. 
KATKO as a colleague. He is a brilliant 
lawyer and a man of exceptional char-
acter and honor. 
He was the one who had been tasked 
by the minority leader to negotiate 
with the majority about creating an 
independent commission to investigate 
the assault on American democracy 
that took place on January 6. He was 
given very specific instructions, and he 
came back a winner. He had gotten an 
agreement for five Republicans and 
five Democrats, equal subpoena power 
right down the middle. 
Alas for his caucus, alas for this Con-
gress, alas for the country, the leader-
ship pulled the rug out from beneath 
him. 
We are going to be very sorry to see 
Mr. KATKO leave Congress at the end of 
this session. We will all be impover-
ished by his absence. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, behold the nonpartisan na-
ture of the January 6th Committee. It 
puzzles me why it would have been so 
different had the allegedly bipartisan 
commission been approved. 
In fact, in the January 6th Commit-
tee’s markup on the contempt resolu-
tions, the grand inquisitor said, in 
opening: ‘‘I can say confidently that 
the many involved in the run-up to 
January 6, an oath, a statement of fi-
delity to our democracy, was nothing 
more to them than meaningless words. 
I fear what happens if those people are 
again given the reins of power.’’ This 
sums up the purpose of the January 6 
inquisition in a way that is both co-
gent and terrifying. 
What the January 6th Committee 
lacks in bona fide legislative purpose, 
not patina of legislative purpose but 
bona fide legislative purpose, it makes 
up for in pure political vendetta. This 
investigation isn’t about truth or de-
mocracy; it is a pure political power 
play. 
The immediate target is President 
Trump, but the ultimate target is 
those people—namely, the millions of 
Americans—who voted for President 
Trump. 
Why is there no dissent from this ob-
jective on this committee? Well, be-
cause the only Members nominally rep-
resentative of the minority, chosen by 
the majority Speaker over the objec-
tion of the minority, share the polit-
ical objectives of the grand inquisitor. 
Accordingly, LIZ CHENEY said during 
the January 6th Committee markup of 
these contempt resolutions: ‘‘Our com-
mittee will continue to litigate to ob-
tain the testimony we need.’’ What 
need? To inform what legislative pur-
pose does the committee need to obtain 
the RNC’s contributor data and infor-
mation, to discover who opened its 
emails and clicked through to donation 
pages? 
On the other hand, it could serve her 
purpose to demonize her political oppo-
nents, especially those who donate to 
President Trump. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield an additional 30 seconds to 
the gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, it is common for the zealot to 
lose the capacity for irony. Hence, 
Chairman THOMPSON
says that laws 
prohibit doing politics on the clock: ‘‘It 
is important that taxpayer dollars 
don’t support political activity.’’ 
Ms. CHENEY waves the Constitution 
even while she poses as the designee of 
the minority, imposed on the minority 
in a historically unprecedented tram-
pling of the institutional norms. This 
is a kangaroo court, a court of the star 
chamber. 
They continue to trample the con-
cepts and the institutional norms of 
the Congress, and I am certain that the 
American people will have an answer 
for it very soon. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the 
people of the United States deserve to 
know the truth. With all the ranting of 
my friends across the aisle, the Con-
stitution indicates that this Nation 
was formed to create a more perfect 
Union. 
b 1445 
There were those who incited Janu-
ary 6. There were those who surrounded 
President Trump who did nothing to 
stop the violence and terrorism of Jan-
uary 6. If witnesses come before a duly 
authorized bipartisan committee and 
refuse to provide the American people 
with the truth, then we need to stand 
here and provide them with a contempt 
order so that the truth can be found.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4227 
April 6, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in voting for this contempt 
order for the truth for the American 
people and the sanctity of the Con-
stitution. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I just want to check if there are any 
further speakers that my friend from 
across the aisle has. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, at this time I have no further 
speakers, and I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I consider 
the gentleman across the aisle a friend, 
and it is certainly an honor and a privi-
lege to debate law with him given the 
fact that he is a renowned constitu-
tional law expert. I mean that sin-
cerely. It is fun being up here with the 
gentleman. So knowing that he has the 
last word, I do just have to cite one 
more case for my good friend. 
I just keep going back to the Trump 
v. Thompson where Justice Kavanaugh 
said that there are only two very nar-
row exceptions to this privilege. Num-
ber one, which can be found in United 
States v. Nixon, relates to a pending 
criminal trial. There is no pending 
criminal trial here. That exception is 
not applicable. 
The second narrow exception is one 
found in Senate Select Committee v. 
Nixon. In there, it is whether the sub-
poenaed evidence is demonstrably crit-
ical to the responsible fulfillment of a 
committee’s function. I am quoting the 
precedent here. That case law goes on 
to state that there are clear differences 
between Congress’ legislative tasks and 
the responsibility of a grand jury. 
He went on further to describe that 
Congress frequently legislates on the 
basis of conflicting information pro-
vided in its hearings all the time. So I 
would submit that that exception does 
not apply either. Reasonable minds can 
differ, but I am very confident that the 
case law here supports the case of Mr. 
Scavino. 
With that said, the law notwith-
standing, it seems that my friends 
across the aisle have proven time and 
time again that they don’t care about 
the separation of powers, they don’t 
care about the protection of our con-
stitutional rights, and they don’t even 
care about the rules of the House. They 
only do if those items fit a political 
narrative. 
It is very clear to me that from the 
Select Committee to Investigate the 
January 6th Attack on the United 
States 
Capitol’s 
treatment 
of 
Mr. 
Scavino and from the resolution before 
us today that they would prefer to 
keep up their political theater rather 
than conduct a legitimate congres-
sional investigation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question and 
‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I do want 
to thank my friend from Pennsylvania. 
Sometimes when I hear him in the 
committee, I think about another 
great Republican who served in the 
House of Representatives from Penn-
sylvania, Thaddeus Stevens. But today, 
my friend let me down a little bit be-
cause Thaddeus Stevens was a great 
enemy of insurrection and rebellion. He 
led the forces in this Congress who in-
sisted upon accountability for the peo-
ple who would dare wage war against 
the Congress of the United States and 
against the Union and the people who 
were all elected to serve and to rep-
resent. 
Justice Kavanaugh, of course, was 
not ruling in the case that my good 
friend cited before. He was just opin-
ing. There was no ruling there. So that 
was one Justice’s opinion. 
My friend cuts me to the quick when 
he says that we don’t care about the 
separation of powers. I think I am 
going to have to turn that insult 
around and say that they don’t care 
about the separation of powers because 
the executive privilege of the Supreme 
Court has repeatedly held, going all the 
way back to 1953, in a case called the 
United States v. Reynolds that the ex-
ecutive privilege may be invoked only 
by the President of the United States. 
And this President of the United 
States, who represents the Article II 
branch, has said he is not invoking it 
on behalf of Scavino or Navarro. He has 
rejected it. 
The funny part is that the former 
President they talked about hasn’t 
even shown up to try to invoke it. And 
what they are talking about doing 
could never be the subject of executive 
privilege anyway because it is political 
activity, which is a crime under the 
Hatch Act. It is criminal activity. It is 
a crime to engage in insurrection and 
coup. 
How could executive privilege—even 
if you had a President who wanted 
nothing more than to try to drape the 
activities of Scavino and Navarro in 
executive privilege, how could that 
President ever prove that it applied? 
Navarro’s job, for example, was the 
trade adviser. This has nothing to do 
with trade. He was engaged in trying to 
overthrow a Presidential election, as 
Judge Carter said last week. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a matter of the 
utmost solemnity and seriousness to 
the American people. We are talking 
about the survival of American demo-
cratic government. For most of human 
history, people have lived under people 
like 
Vladimir 
Putin 
and 
Donald 
Trump, the kings, the queens, the dic-
tators, the tyrants, and the bullies 
whom some people would want to flat-
ter. 
But we have something else going on 
here in America. We have got a project 
in democratic self-government. Lincoln 
knew how tenuous it was. He asked 
whether government of the people, by 
the people, and for the people shall last 
or shall perish from the Earth. 
That is the question facing us, too. 
So let’s deal with all the issues and 
controversies we want. But couldn’t we 
get together and all stand up for the 
institutions of the country? 
We are doing that in our committee, 
which is bipartisan. I fear that some-
times we are moving into a Demo-
cratic/Republican caucus in Congress 
and a Trump caucus. There are those of 
us, 
like 
Ms. 
CHENEY, 
like 
Mr. 
KINZINGER, and like Mr. THOMPSON on 
the committee, who want to work to-
gether to get to the bottom of this and 
then to deal with the problems of the 
country. And then there are those, like 
the minority leader, who will follow 
the will of Donald Trump if he says he 
doesn’t want any investigation at all. 
I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, but that is 
where we are today. These two wit-
nesses have acted with contempt to-
wards Congress and the American peo-
ple. We must hold them in contempt of 
Congress and the American people. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, this rule pro-
vides for consideration of yet another Con-
tempt of Congress resolution that has no pur-
pose other than to punish. If the January 6th 
Select Committee wanted to actually compel 
production of the documents and records they 
subpoenaed, they would instead be suing for 
civil enforcement. But that takes time, and 
there are only eight months left before these 
subpoenas expire. 
Congressional Committees may conduct in-
vestigations in pursuit of a legislative purpose. 
I ask: What legislative purpose would be 
served by referring Peter Navarro and Daniel 
Scavino for criminal Contempt of Congress 
rather than suing for civil enforcement? 
Additionally, the question of executive privi-
lege is not legally settled. President Biden has 
stated he would not grant executive privilege 
regarding Mr. Scavino’s testimony, but the 
Presidential Records Act governs presidential 
records, not the testimony of aides to former 
presidents. The committee also demanded ri-
diculous compliance timelines in requests to 
Mr. Scavino, further indicating a lack of willing-
ness to undertake a legitimate and thorough 
investigation. 
As we get closer to the end of the year, will 
the Select Committee go straight to recom-
mending Contempt of Congress for every sub-
poenaed individual that requests accommoda-
tions or an extended timeline? 
I urge a no vote on this misguided resolu-
tion. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1023 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
471) to prohibit the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services from lessening the strin-
gency of, and to prohibit the Secretary of 
Homeland Security from ceasing or lessening 
implementation of, the COVID–19 border 
health provisions through the end of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and for other purposes. 
All points of order against consideration of 
the bill are waived. The bill shall be consid-
ered as read. All points of order against pro-
visions in the bill are waived. The previous 
question shall be considered as ordered on 
the bill and on any amendment thereto to 
final passage without intervening motion ex-
cept: (1) one hour of debate equally divided

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
A message in writing from the Presi-
dent of the United States was commu-
nicated to the House by Mr. Adrian 
Swann, one of his secretaries. 
f 
PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF H.R. 3807, RESTAURANT REVI-
TALIZATION 
FUND 
REPLENISH-
MENT ACT OF 2021, AND FOR 
OTHER PURPOSES 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, by di-
rection of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 1033 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1033 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to consider in the 
House the bill (H.R. 3807) to amend the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to increase 
appropriations to the Restaurant Revitaliza-
tion Fund, and for other purposes. All points 
of order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. An amendment in the nature of a 
substitute consisting of the text of Rules 
Committee Print 117–39, modified by the 
amendment printed in the report of the Com-
mittee on Rules accompanying this resolu-
tion, shall be considered as adopted. The bill, 
as amended, shall be considered as read. All 
points of order against provisions in the bill, 
as amended, are waived. The previous ques-
tion shall be considered as ordered on the 
bill, as amended, and on any further amend-
ment thereto, to final passage without inter-
vening motion except: (1) one hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the chair 
and ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Small Business or their respective 
designees; and (2) one motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York is recognized 
for 1 hour. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, for the 
purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Mrs. FISCHBACH), my 
colleague and friend, pending which I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. During consideration of this res-
olution, all time yielded is for the pur-
pose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, this 
morning the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 1033, 
providing for consideration of H.R. 
3807, the Relief for Restaurants and 
other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act of 
2022 under a closed rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Small Business, self- 
executes a manager’s amendment from 
Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ, and provides 
one motion to recommit. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my 
colleagues to adopt the rule and sup-
port critical funding for restaurants 
and other small businesses across our 
Nation. 
As we all know, small businesses—es-
pecially restaurants—are the backbone 
of our local economy. Not only for the 
revenue they bring in, but for the 
many local workers they employ; fami-
lies that need their paycheck now more 
than ever. But sadly, restaurants have 
been some of the hardest-hit businesses 
throughout the COVID–19 crisis, and 
many have struggled to keep their 
doors open. 
Many of us have made a promise to 
support workers, families, and busi-
nesses in their time of need, and that is 
why we established the Restaurant Re-
vitalization Fund in the American Res-
cue Plan, which provided $28.6 billion 
in emergency assistance to eligible res-
taurants, bars, and qualifying busi-
nesses impacted by the COVID crisis. 
This program was clearly a success, 
providing relief to more than 100,000 
restaurants and food and beverage 
businesses across the Nation. Some re-
cent estimates show the program saved 
over 900,000 jobs, and 96 percent of re-
cipients said the grant made it more 
likely they would stay in business. 
However, there is no question that 
our initial investment was not enough. 
The program ran out of funds in just 3 
weeks, as the total funding requested 
exceeded $72 billion, far more than the 
$28.6 billion provided for in the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4230 
April 6, 2022 
This funding gap resulted in 178,000 
restaurants who are unable to secure 
funding in this program, even though 
they applied to the program and met 
all of the eligibility requirements. Let 
me say that again, 178,000 restaurants, 
many of which are in danger of perma-
nent closure if Congress does not pro-
vide them with the relief they need. 
The underlying legislation, the Relief 
for Restaurants and other Hard Hit 
Businesses Act, would provide for $42 
billion to replenish the Restaurant Re-
vitalization Fund, giving the Small 
Business Administration the funding 
necessary to close this funding gap and 
process the applications of those enti-
ties who are deemed eligible in the ini-
tial application period, providing a life-
line for the restaurant industry that 
has faced so many challenges over the 
past 2 years. 
In addition to this critical funding, 
the underlying legislation also pro-
vides $13 billion for a new Hard Hit In-
dustries Award Program, which will 
grant much-needed relief to other 
small businesses across industries and 
sectors that were the hardest hit by 
the pandemic but were not eligible for 
the Restaurant Revitalization Fund or 
Shuttered Venue Operators Grant pro-
gram. 
This new program would prioritize 
those eligible small businesses that ex-
perience the heaviest pandemic-related 
losses, beginning with those that lost 
80 percent of their revenue. 
To pay for both the establishment of 
the new program and the replenish-
ment of the Restaurant Revitalization 
Fund, this bill would use funds re-
claimed, seized, or returned to the Fed-
eral Government from bad actors at-
tempting to defraud previous recovery 
programs. 
Back in October 2020, the Small Busi-
ness Administration Office of the In-
spector General had already identified 
$78 billion in potentially fraudulent 
loans and grants to ineligible entities, 
and more than 300 individuals have 
been brought to justice. This legisla-
tion also increases oversight and audit 
requirements, ensuring that this addi-
tional support goes to the businesses 
originally intended to receive assist-
ance. 
Mr. Speaker, I have always been an 
advocate of additional support for the 
restaurant and hospitality industry, 
and many of my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle have dem-
onstrated support for the Restaurant 
Revitalization Fund, as well. I hope we 
continue to see bipartisan support for 
this effort on the House floor. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
the rule and the underlying legislation 
to deliver critical funding for res-
taurants and small businesses in com-
munities across the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from New York 
for yielding me the customary 30 min-
utes, and, Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Today, we are here to consider a rule 
providing for consideration of H.R. 
3807, the Relief for Restaurants and 
other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act. 
This legislation gives a check to the 
Small Business Administration with-
out accountability or oversight mecha-
nisms or even taking into account 
SBA’s feedback. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill appropriates an 
additional $55 billion to restaurants 
and small businesses, none of which is 
paid for. According to the Congres-
sional Budget Office, as much as $340 
billion in unobligated funds from var-
ious COVID relief legislation is avail-
able for expenditure, but we are not re-
allocating those. Instead, we would be 
relying on more deficit spending to 
provide these sums. Structurally, this 
bill is not going to work. This is a lot 
of money, and it seems that Democrats 
just want to throw it to the wind, be-
cause when you look at how the funds 
are being distributed, this bill will not 
fix the problem. This is something that 
could have been addressed had the bill 
gone through the committee process. 
Because this bill is not immediately 
or responsibly paid for, it would fur-
ther fuel the inflation crisis, which 
currently sits at a 40-year high of 7.9 
percent. Inflation is the number one 
problem facing small businesses, ac-
cording to them. That is what they are 
saying. Instead of pushing through 
drastic increases of inflation-inducing 
deficit spending, we must work to-
gether to advance progrowth policies 
that empower small businesses to oper-
ate independently without burdensome 
restrictions. 
I need to point out the political game 
Democrats are playing this session. 
They are proposing bills that have ti-
tles that make them seem like com-
monsense bills, but really, they are dis-
ingenuous attempts to fix real prob-
lems. 
This was true of last week’s insulin 
bill, and it is true of this bill. What is 
worse is they know that they are not 
coming up with real solutions. That is 
why we are now looking at yet another 
bill that has not been through the com-
mittee process, there has been no 
transparency, no opportunity to dis-
cuss, no public or minority input, and 
has real flaws as a result that will only 
exacerbate the problems my colleagues 
have created. My Democratic col-
leagues do not want to negotiate with 
Republicans or allow any input from 
anyone to come up with a bill that 
would actually help people. 
It is also why my colleagues did not 
take up the ENTREE Act, which was 
introduced last summer, at a time 
when restaurants really needed it. 
That bill was also aimed at helping res-
taurants and small businesses recover 
from the damage done by the pandemic 
with proper oversight and constraints 
and didn’t include discriminatory lan-
guage that prioritized certain groups 
based on criteria other than need. That 
eventually, the Supreme Court had to 
put a stop to. 
Now, we need to be focusing on the 
crises that are going on that are going 
to become problems for restaurants 
this year: workforce and inflation. We 
are still seeing ‘‘help wanted’’ signs all 
over the country. Businesses are des-
perate for a workforce. Congress needs 
to stop paying people to stay at home 
and encourage them to work. And in-
flation is hitting every single corner of 
the 
economy. 
Between 
increasing 
prices on all goods, and the effects we 
are already starting to feel in the food 
industry from the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine, consumers are going to start 
feeling the pain. And, unfortunately, 
when you are trying to save money, 
going out to eat is not one of the first 
things a family typically does. We need 
to be getting ahead of these issues, not 
coming up with insincere attempts 
under the guise of COVID relief. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule and 
the underlying bill, and I ask Members 
to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I always appreciate hearing from my 
colleagues and a distinguished member 
of 
the 
Rules 
Committee, 
Mrs. 
FISCHBACH. I do note, however, a couple 
of things before I yield some time. 
The first is that as it relates to how 
the bill is funded, as I indicated, the in-
spector general himself, that office, in-
dicated there is $78 billion in fraudu-
lent claims that are being recouped by 
the Federal Government. This bill will 
cost $42 billion for the Restaurant Re-
vitalization Fund replenishment, an-
other $13 billion, $55 billion. There is 
plenty of money in those reclaimed 
dollars to be able to pay for this with-
out having to appropriate new dollars. 
So this actually should be in line with 
the principles of some of our more con-
servative Members to have claimed 
dollars that are owed to the United 
States and to its taxpayers. 
Secondly, as it relates to workforce 
shortages, and I think we all know in 
every industry, and the businesses I 
talk to back home, are struggling to 
find workers. Yet, I note yesterday in 
the Education and Labor Committee, 
of which I am a member, that we didn’t 
get a single Republican vote for the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity 
Act, WIOA’s reauthorization, which 
will do great things to continue to 
move people into the workplace as 
quickly as possible. Yet, we received no 
support for that. 
So we are going to continue to work 
on these issues here in this Congress. 
We are going to continue to lead. This 
majority is going to continue to look 
out for small businesses, it is going to 
continue to look out for people looking 
for work, and it is going to continue to 
look out for employers who face work-
er shortages. So we will continue to 
support this, and I believe this bill will 
be a great victory for the 178,000 res-
taurants who desperately need our sup-
port.

H4231 
April 6, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
distinguished gentleman from Cali-
fornia 
(Mr. 
DESAULNIER), 
a 
fellow 
member of the Rules Committee. 
b 1600 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank my friend and colleague 
for yielding. And I also want to thank 
my distinguished colleagues on both 
sides for the conversation at the Rules 
Committee. 
I want to speak for a few moments, 
Mr. Speaker, as somebody who has 
spent 35 years in the restaurant busi-
ness, owning and managing restaurants 
in California, small businesses that 
were vital to the communities where 
they were; and how important they are 
to restart Main Street America in 
every district; the multipliers of hav-
ing restaurants open, and the difficulty 
and the cash flow of a small business 
like this, and why this initiative is so 
important. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics esti-
mates that in 2019, there were 12.1 mil-
lion people employed in the restaurant 
and food service industry. So many of 
those people immediately lost their 
jobs and their incomes with no warning 
when the pandemic hit. In April of 2020 
alone, the restaurant industry lost 51⁄2 
million jobs. 
Through the American Rescue Plan, 
we established the Restaurant Revital-
ization Fund, which provided $28.6 bil-
lion in emergency assistance to eligible 
restaurants, bars, and qualifying busi-
nesses impacted by the pandemic. 
Although this program helped more 
than 100,000 restaurants and food and 
beverage businesses across the country, 
in every district, the program received 
applications of nearly three times the 
amount of money that it had to give 
out. We cannot overlook the obvious 
need. 
The Relief for Restaurants and Other 
Hard Hit Small Businesses Act, H.R. 
3807, would inject $42 billion to allow 
the Small Business Administration to 
process the applications of over 150,000 
eligible entities that previously applied 
for relief. 
I met and talked to many of my 
former colleagues in the business who 
have applied for these funds and they 
speak very positively about their expe-
rience and how helpful it was to get 
them through the pandemic. It helps 
these small businesses. Through the 
pandemic, at least 40 percent of pan-
demic-related revenue loss was suffered 
by businesses with fewer than 200 em-
ployees. 
Again, as a former restaurant owner 
myself, I have seen how restaurants 
can bring communities together. We 
owe it to these local business entre-
preneurs, these owners, and millions of 
workers who depend on this help, to 
pass this important bill. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I would just like to mention, we con-
tinue to talk about whether or not this 
is paid for. I respectfully ask: Where is 
the CBO score? That would answer the 
question if we actually had done any— 
put this legislation through any kind 
of process, through committee, getting 
the CBO score. 
So I would question as to whether or 
not it was actually all paid for, as my 
colleague mentions. But I do think 
that if we had the CBO score, we could 
decide, finally, if it was paid for or not. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for yielding. 
I completely agree that we should be 
trying to help small businesses who 
have gotten absolutely railroaded and 
run over by the power of government, 
which amounts to, essentially, a tak-
ing. They have had their livelihoods 
taken away through the sheer power of 
government, Federal, State and local. 
It is absolutely extraordinary. 
It is one of the reasons that I worked 
with my friend, DEAN PHILLIPS, on the 
other side of the aisle, on the PPP 
Flexibility Act 2 years ago. I would 
have preferred we not go down this 
road; that the government not go down 
and shut down our economy. But the 
government did. And I think that 
amounts to something akin to a tak-
ing. 
But now, here we sit and, yet again, 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle have not met an issue that they 
can’t make worse; and that is what we 
are faced with right now. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
my 
colleagues 
are 
bringing forward a $55 billion bill 
which they say is paid for, which is 
paid for and relies on recaptured, 
fraudulent relief funds. We have fraud-
ulent relief funds because you just 
dumped $2 trillion out in the economy 
when you came in here and did it by 
voice vote 2 years ago. 
So you have got these fraudulent 
funds that we may or may not recap-
ture that is, allegedly, what is paying 
for this. This bill should be fully paid 
for out of existing COVID money that 
has not yet been spent. And that is 
what we are offering as an alternative. 
But the real problem that the Amer-
ican people need to understand that my 
colleagues have got themselves in a 
pretty vicious box, is because the ad-
ministration, with the full support of 
my colleagues here, made the alloca-
tion of dollars race-based. They made 
it criteria-based. And they got slapped 
down by the court. They got slapped 
down by the Sixth Circuit. 
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals 
found race and sex prioritization was 
unconstitutional and ordered the Small 
Business Administration to halt the 
practice. But most of the funding had 
been spent. It was underfunded. But 
most of that funding had been spent. 
The court said: ‘‘The case is about 
whether the government can allocate 
limited coronavirus relief funds based 
on the race and sex of the applicants. 
We hold that it cannot. 
‘‘The stark realities of the Small 
Business Administration’s racial gerry-
mandering are inescapable.’’ ‘‘It is in-
deed ‘a sordid business’. . . . ‘‘quoting 
our Chief Justice John Roberts, ‘‘ . . . 
‘a sordid business’ to divide ‘us up by 
race.’ ’’ ‘‘And the government’s at-
tempt to do so here violates the Con-
stitution.’’ 
That is the real story. I have intro-
duced the Restaurant Revitalization 
Fund Fairness Act. We have got other 
bills on this side of the aisle that would 
pay for it; that would ensure that it 
won’t be race-based; that would make 
sure that the 177,000 applicants who 
were left on the outside looking in be-
cause of race-based governing by my 
colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, that that would not occur; and 
that, 
again—I 
want 
to 
reiterate— 
should be paid for without relying on 
the possibility of collecting the fraudu-
lent expenditures. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I want to just reiterate, this is really 
a simple issue. And there may be at-
tempts to distract from what is a sim-
ple issue, but the Office of Inspector 
General indicated that we had $78 bil-
lion in fraudulent claims. That is an 
estimate. Some estimates range as 
high as $200 billion. 
It seems silly to me that we wouldn’t 
take advantage of those dollars which 
are being reclaimed to continue to try 
to get relief for the many, many tens of 
thousands, hundreds of thousands of 
restaurants and their employees across 
the country. 
And I dare say that when I talk to— 
I have sat down with many, many res-
taurant owners in the last several 
months who had made application, and, 
simply, didn’t have the resources in the 
fund that we had allocated to get re-
lief, continue to talk to me about this. 
So this is really a very, very simple 
question. I know there are a lot of com-
plicated, nuanced questions around 
here in Congress that we are always 
dealing with. This is a simple one: Do 
we want to help these small businesses, 
or do we choose not to help them? And 
I think we would argue here that they 
very much deserve and merit this sup-
port. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ROSS), another distinguished member 
of the Rules Committee. 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to highlight the urgent need for addi-
tional relief for our restaurants. 
Since the COVID–19 pandemic began, 
restaurants in my district and across 
the country have been at the front line 
of our battle against COVID–19. 
The Restaurant Revitalization Fund 
offered a vital lifeline at a time when 
restaurants 
desperately 
needed 
our 
help. However, the funds quickly ran 
out, leaving hundreds of thousands of 
restaurants without any relief, includ-
ing in my State of North Carolina. 
In a cruel twist, many restaurants 
were approved for funding, but never 
saw a dime.

For example, Kim Hammer, who 
owns Bittersweet in Raleigh, was ap-
proved for a grant by the Small Busi-
ness Association. Despite this, Kim 
still hasn’t received any relief and said, 
‘‘It feels like no one is listening.’’ 
Well, we are listening. Every time a 
new variant emerges and cases surge, 
the survival of countless restaurants is 
thrown into jeopardy. As I hear from 
restaurant owners in my district, they 
all tell me how essential the restaurant 
relief program was; but that it simply 
was not enough. 
During the peak surge of the Omi-
cron 
variant, 
Cheetie 
Kumar, 
the 
owner of Garland restaurant in Ra-
leigh, said she just hoped she could 
keep the doors open for both her cus-
tomers and for her staff. 
Jennifer 
Cramer, 
the 
owner 
of 
Catalan Taps restaurant in Cary, had 
to start a GoFundMe campaign to keep 
her lights on and her employees on 
payroll. 
Mr. Speaker, our fight against this 
pandemic is not over. It is unaccept-
able that we would leave the res-
taurant industry out to dry. Res-
taurants contribute to the spirit, vi-
brancy, and success of my community 
in Wake County, North Carolina, and 
many communities all across this Na-
tion. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
rule and the underlying legislation and 
replenish this fund. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself as much time as I may 
consume. 
If we defeat the previous question, I 
will offer an amendment to the rule to 
provide for consideration of Congress-
woman MCMORRIS RODGERS and Con-
gressman WESTERMAN’s American En-
ergy Independence from Russia Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with the ex-
traneous material, immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARSON). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, for 
the fifth time, Republicans ask their 
colleagues to consider this bill. The av-
erage price at the pump two days be-
fore President Biden took office was 
$2.38 per gallon. They have been stead-
ily climbing ever since. 
On February 14, 6 days before the 
Russian invasion of Ukraine, the aver-
age price for per gallon was $3.49. These 
prices are affecting every single Amer-
ican. 
When adjusted for the increasing 
prices on all goods, thanks to failed 
Democrat policies, wages and salaries 
are below pre-pandemic levels. My con-
stituents are pleading with Congress to 
focus on this issue and are being ig-
nored by the out-of-touch majority. 
Now, for the fifth time, House Repub-
licans are urging the majority to im-
mediately bring relief at the pump 
now. While my colleagues continue to 
bring flawed, misguided, and unvetted 
legislation to the floor, House Repub-
licans stand ready to work on issues 
that directly affect American’s pocket-
books. 
To further explain the amendment, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK). 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague and friend from 
the great State of Minnesota for yield-
ing. 
I rise today to defeat the previous 
question so that we may immediately 
consider 
H.R. 
6858, 
Congresswoman 
McMorris Rodgers’ bill, that would 
strengthen United States energy secu-
rity, encourage and promote domestic 
production of crude oil and natural gas, 
and help return to and solidify Amer-
ican energy independence. 
You know, I get asked all the time, 
why? Why will Congress do nothing to 
lower the cost of fuel? Why do they 
continue to talk and do absolutely 
nothing? 
Well, right here—right here is your 
answer. Today, Republicans stand, for 
the fifth time, legislation Today, Re-
publicans stand, for the fifth time, leg-
islation in hand, to bring gas prices 
down and to restart our energy produc-
tion right here at home; legislation 
that would make us energy inde-
pendent, once again, and that would 
get thousands of Americans back to 
work; legislation that would be a col-
lective sigh of relief for our seniors, 
and those on fixed incomes, who are 
making the decision between gas or 
groceries. This legislation is the an-
swer, and it is ready to go. 
But you know what? My colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle have al-
ready been given vote recommenda-
tions by the Speaker of the House to 
shoot 
this 
legislation 
down. 
They 
haven’t even read it. They haven’t even 
read it, and they are so blind to and be-
holden to their radical agenda that 
they won’t consider a commonsense so-
lution to one of the most pressing 
issues facing all of our collective con-
stituents, these fuel prices. 
Again, this is the fifth time that this 
legislation has been presented, and it is 
the fifth time that my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle have put 
Russia first and America last. 
The average price of gas today is 
$4.56 and climbing. For our truckers 
and farmers who fuel up on diesel, like 
many in my district, it is costing them 
well over $5 a gallon at the pump. In 
fact, it is $5.19 today for a gallon of die-
sel. 
All across our country, Americans, 
regardless of party, are making deci-
sions, again, between gas in the tank 
or groceries in the fridge. Folks are 
canceling their first road trip with 
their family in 2 years, or visits to 
grandparents, because Biden has de-
cided that Americans who put fuel in 
their own gas tanks and shop for their 
own groceries, they are not the pri-
ority. 
b 1615 
In fact, just 17 hours ago, the Biden 
administration was more concerned 
with 
presenting 
former 
President 
Barack Obama with a ceremonial pen 
than talking about how we are going to 
bring down fuel prices in this country. 
You want to talk about out of touch. 
There it is in a nutshell. 
This is the Biden energy policy: soar-
ing 
prices 
that 
hurt 
hardworking 
Americans and increasing reliance on 
foreign countries to meet our energy 
needs. 
We know that America’s future will 
not be realized by sunshine and pin-
wheels. We will realize it by boosting 
domestic production and ending our de-
pendence on countries that don’t have 
our best interests in mind. Heck, they 
don’t even like us. 
I have spoken to foresters and farm-
ers in my district who have told me 
that energy costs alone are driving 
them out of operation and out of busi-
ness. To illustrate this, one of the top 
timber producers in my own district 
said he is spending $18,000 more a week 
on fuel costs alone. If this continues, 
he will be suspending operations, all 
because this administration has issued 
our domestic energy industry a death 
sentence. That happened even before 
they took office. 
This Biden energy plan, or lack 
thereof, is ruining the financial hopes 
and dreams of hardworking Americans 
and destroying farmers, foresters, fam-
ilies, ranchers, and small businesses. 
We know that we can put an end to 
this energy crisis. We know we can, but 
instead, we are focused on ceremonial 
pens and issues that do not matter to 
the American people. 
It is long past time that we end this 
energy crisis and put American energy 
security and independence at the top of 
the priority list. I stand before this 
body and the American people to say 
that we, too, have had enough. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
defeat the previous question so we can 
immediately 
bring 
Congresswoman 
McMorris Rodgers’ legislation to the 
floor. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, frankly, I am a little 
perplexed. I think when I get home and 
talk to my restaurant owners, they are 
going to say: Why were you having a 
conversation about something not re-
lated to the restaurant revitalization 
act? 
I will explain to them that as much 
as I would like to get into a conversa-
tion about how Putin’s aggressive ac-
tions in Ukraine have affected gas 
prices around the world, as much as I 
would like to have the conversation 
about oil companies that have decided 
to continue to reap record profits and 
not increase supply to meet the de-
mand around the world, as much as we 
can talk about all those things, that is 
not why we are here today. We should 
have that conversation in an appro-
priate venue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4233 
April 6, 2022 
This conversation and the venue 
right now that we are in is to talk 
about the Restaurant Revitalization 
Fund. It is to talk about the 178,000 res-
taurants owned by Republicans, Demo-
crats, and Independents all across 
America in every single district that 
we have the privilege of representing. 
Every single district has restaurants, 
and that is what we are here to talk 
about: how to get relief into the hands 
of those individuals who, for 2 years, 
have struggled under the most difficult 
economic circumstances any of us 
could ever imagine. 
Let’s make sure we keep our eye on 
the ball. Let’s continue to focus on the 
question in front of the House. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
SCANLON), my friend and distinguished 
member of the Rules Committee. 
Ms. 
SCANLON. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
in 
southeastern Pennsylvania, and in cit-
ies and towns across the country, res-
taurants are an essential cornerstone 
of our local communities and our re-
gional economies. These restaurants 
were hard-hit by the pandemic. 
Despite the excellence of their cui-
sine, over the past 2 years, many inde-
pendent restaurants in Philly, Dela-
ware County, and Montgomery County 
struggled to stay in business, and some 
permanently shuttered. 
The Restaurant Revitalization Fund, 
passed as part of the American Rescue 
Plan, was a lifeline for the restaurants 
that received it. The program provided 
grants targeted to the hardest-hit res-
taurants, giving restaurant operators 
financial relief to keep their doors 
open and keep people employed. 
The funds weren’t enough to match 
the need. I have heard it from my con-
stituents, and everybody who is listen-
ing has heard it from their constitu-
ents. While roughly 300,000 restaurants 
applied for aid, only about 100,000 re-
ceived grants. 
For months, I have joined Represent-
ative BLUMENAUER and my colleagues 
in calling to replenish the Restaurant 
Revitalization Fund, using only funds 
recouped from fraudulent claims that 
have been made in earlier small busi-
ness relief programs. The Relief for 
Restaurants and other Hard Hit Small 
Businesses Act will provide additional 
financial support to restaurants and 
small businesses in the industries that 
are still grievously affected by the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Mr. Speaker, I am glad this needed 
bill is getting a vote on the floor. I 
strongly support the rule and its un-
derlying legislation, and I urge all of 
my colleagues to recognize that this 
issue is still before us and to do the 
same. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that my 
colleague from New York would love to 
have the conversation, would love to 
have the conversation in the appro-
priate venue, and I think we would also 
love to have that conversation, par-
ticularly in a committee if we could 
hear the bill. But the majority has cho-
sen to shut out almost every single Re-
publican bill and not hold hearings 
where that would be the appropriate 
venue. 
For now, I suggest to my colleague 
from New York that he talk to his 
leadership about actually hearing this 
bill in committee, having the conversa-
tion, and having the transparency and 
the input that we could from the pub-
lic. Until that time, Mr. Speaker, this 
is our venue. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Alabama (Mr. CARL). 
Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-
position to the previous question so we 
can amend the rules to immediately 
consider H.R. 6858, the American En-
ergy Independence from Russia Act. 
My friends from the other side of the 
aisle want to talk about restaurants, 
and restaurants are very important, 
but understand that when families 
can’t put fuel in their tank, they cer-
tainly cannot afford to eat in a res-
taurant. 
We 
have 
to 
get 
our 
priorities 
straight. Yes, we are bringing them up 
now because we cannot get our bills to 
the floor. We cannot get our message 
out. 
This is the fourth time the Repub-
licans have tried to bring this bill up 
for a vote, and each time, the Demo-
crats have refused. 
Families are suffering as rising fuel 
costs are making everything much, 
much more expensive, including bread, 
clothes, 
and 
everything, 
including 
meals at our restaurants. 
President Biden’s so-called solutions 
do nothing to fix the problems. Tap-
ping into our strategic reserves will do 
almost nothing to bring prices down. 
All it does is risk our reserves and en-
danger our national security. 
This administration is signaling to 
the oil and gas companies that they are 
going to come after them. 
Big Government needs to get out of 
the way. Get out of the way of the busi-
nesses, and let the businesses run 
themselves. 
For example, where I am from on the 
Gulf Coast, the Department of the Inte-
rior has allowed one lease sale in the 
past year and a half. Under Trump, we 
had two a year. We had the one sale 
that I am talking about in a year and 
a half. 
The Biden administration refuses to 
uphold the law of two per year, even 
though the courts struck down the one 
that he had. He refuses to challenge 
that to get those lease bids acknowl-
edged. 
Biden, what he has said is a lie. I am 
sorry, it is an outright lie about what 
the drilling companies are. There are 
so many rules and regulations on the 
drilling companies. I understand it. We 
have to get the foot of the government 
off the back of the necks of our drilling 
companies. 
Let’s save this country. Let’s don’t 
give it away to Russia. Let’s don’t give 
it away to Venezuela. Let’s stand firm 
and be Americans, both sides of the 
aisle here. I am sorry, I will cool off 
here on this one. 
Republicans have a real solution to 
get American energy back on the mar-
ket and get prices down. This bill will 
restart the Keystone XL; it will end 
the moratorium; and it will boost the 
LNG exports. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I do want to just cor-
rect the record as it relates to the En-
ergy 
and 
Commerce 
Committee. 
I 
think, just this morning, the com-
mittee held a hearing with the heads of 
oil companies, multinational oil com-
panies, to bring them in to talk about 
why they refuse to increase supply, 
which would bring down the costs. 
I didn’t do exceptionally well in eco-
nomics when I was in the State Univer-
sity of New York, but I do remember 
the old supply and demand issue. When 
demand is high and supply is low, 
prices rise. We are going to continue to 
work and push and urge those compa-
nies to increase supply to meet demand 
and bring the costs down. 
There is not much we can do about 
what is going on in Ukraine, although 
we are desperately trying to help our 
brothers and sisters there defend their 
democracy, which has had an incred-
ible impact on gas prices. 
Let me also remind everyone who is 
tuning in, who is watching what is 
going on, that the issue before the 
House of Representatives today, the 
rule that is being considered, is dealing 
with the difficulties that have been 
faced by restaurants across this coun-
try during the pandemic, which has 
now lasted for nearly 2 years: the dis-
placement of workers and the impact 
that it has had on communities all 
across this country. We are striving to 
achieve a solution here that will be 
good for everyone across all 50 States 
and these small businesses that con-
tinue to be the backbone of our local 
economies. 
Mr. Speaker, I have been very grate-
ful for the leadership of Mr. BLU-
MENAUER, who has led the charge on 
this issue for some time now. I think I 
have probably bothered him dozens of 
times to ask what we can continue to 
do to advance his efforts, and he has 
continued to provide leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER), the sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman’s courtesy 
and I appreciate his leadership and te-
nacity in terms of trying to help our 
beleaguered neighborhood restaurants. 
Mr. Speaker, our friends on the other 
side of the aisle—even if they got their 
dream piece of legislation—would not

make any difference on the price of 
gasoline this year or next year. We are 
dealing with global supply. One of the 
things that will make a difference to 
break the grip that we have with the 
oligarchs and the sheikhs is being able 
to deal with renewable energy that is 
not going to hold us hostage. 
We have seen remarkable progress 
that is made. I am sad that our friends 
on the other side of the aisle have been 
resistant to these innovations in terms 
of solar, wind, electrification, the 
things that will really make a dif-
ference today and tomorrow and help 
fight the crisis that we face with cli-
mate change and global warming. 
This legislation will make a dif-
ference to 177,000 small neighborhood 
restaurants and other distressed busi-
nesses. From the beginning of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, these neighbor-
hood facilities have been the hardest 
hit. You have heard already that they 
were subject to over 4 million jobs lost 
in the first few months of the pan-
demic. 
The unemployment in the restaurant 
industry remains stubbornly high, and 
approximately 90,000 restaurants have 
permanently closed since the start of 
the pandemic. We have heard from 
countless others that are teetering on 
the edge. 
Restaurants are the cornerstone of a 
livable community. They have em-
ployed nearly 60 percent of Americans 
at some point in their career. I would 
venture to say that many of us on the 
floor of the House have had that expe-
rience. They are a major source of em-
ployment for people of color and 
women, and they support a $1 trillion 
supply chain from farm to table. 
The Federal Government has pro-
vided 
help 
for 
those 
institutions 
through the Restaurant Revitalization 
Fund, a program based on my RES-
TAURANTS Act that I introduced in 
June of 2020, but the program was over-
subscribed and underfunded. Only one- 
third of all applicants were funded, 
leaving 177,000 hanging in the balance. 
The relief for restaurants and other 
hard-hit small businesses will finish 
that job. More than 235 Members of the 
House are cosponsors of this legisla-
tion, the RESTAURANTS Act, includ-
ing two dozen of my Republican col-
leagues. 
My legislation will provide $42 billion 
to help fund those restaurants that had 
not previously received awards fin-
ishing everybody who is in line. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Oregon. 
b 1630 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. The legislation 
provides $13 billion for a separate in-
dustry neutral fund for small busi-
nesses that have been disproportion-
ately hard hit by the pandemic, such as 
live events, travel, hospitality, and fit-
ness. We have all heard from them in 
our Districts. 
Finally, the legislation extends the 
period of time that Shuttered Venue 
Operators Grants can be spent to har-
monize it with the Restaurant Revital-
ization Fund. 
Best of all, this bill can be paid for 
with fraudulent pandemic relief funds 
that are recovered. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to fin-
ish the job protecting our neighbor-
hood restaurants and other distressed 
businesses. I am proud to have spon-
sored this. I deeply appreciate the 
broad bipartisan support in the House 
and the Senate, and I hope we will 
enact it today. I support the rule. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, with 
all due respect, restaurants and small 
businesses are facing difficulties, and 
one of those challenges is high energy 
costs. Delivery costs go up. It costs 
more for their employees to get to 
work. It costs more for all of those 
things because of high energy costs. So 
this does affect restaurants and small 
businesses. I think this affects res-
taurants, small businesses, and every 
American. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
OBERNOLTE). 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to oppose the previous question so that 
we 
can 
immediately 
consider 
the 
American Energy Independence from 
Russia Act. 
Mr. Speaker, last night I held a town-
hall with over 2,000 of my constituents. 
Do you know what was top of mind to 
those people? 
It was not the previous question. It 
was energy prices in America, and par-
ticularly, the price of fuel. 
Mr. Speaker, it was heartbreaking to 
hear 
from 
constituent 
after 
con-
stituent after constituent who said 
that they were unable to afford the en-
ergy required to get to work and back 
just to put food on the table for their 
families. Mr. Speaker, you can imagine 
how embarrassing and heartbreaking it 
was for me to have to admit to my con-
stituents that the reason for those high 
energy prices was the actions of their 
very own government. 
Mr. Speaker, since the beginning of 
the current administration, there has 
been a concerted effort to constrain the 
supply of energy produced here in 
America. What we have is a classic 
problem of supply and demand. We 
don’t have enough supply, and yet this 
administration in its very first week 
issued an executive order completely 
halting the issuance of new gas and oil 
exploration permits on Federal lands in 
this country. It issued an executive 
order stopping the Keystone XL pipe-
line. Mr. Speaker, that pipeline alone, 
if it were in operation today, would 
allow us to import more than enough 
oil to completely offset our oil imports 
from Russia. 
The tragic thing about this situation 
is that the administration is doing this 
out of the mistaken belief that it will 
make the planet greener. But nothing 
could be further from the truth. We 
produce energy more cleanly here in 
America than any other country on 
Earth. 
So when we take actions that require 
us to import more oil from places like 
Venezuela, which has a 50 percent high-
er lifecycle greenhouse gas emission 
per barrel of oil than oil produced here 
in America, and when we increase oil 
imports from places like Russia that 
still utilize dirty practices like meth-
ane flaring—things we haven’t done 
here in years—we are actually increas-
ing global greenhouse gas emissions. 
Mr. Speaker, if we increase energy 
production here, not only will we lower 
prices for our constituents who are suf-
fering, and not only will we increase 
our national security, but we will also 
make our planet a cleaner place. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge immediate con-
sideration of the American Independ-
ence from Russia Act. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from the State of Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the manager for yielding, and I 
thank him for his leadership. I thank, 
of course, the chairwoman of the Small 
Business Committee, Mr. BLUMENAUER, 
and the many supporters who have pro-
vided support for this legislation. 
I am hoping that as my colleagues 
begin to see the light, that they will 
understand that it will be far worse for 
all of the employees who are in res-
taurants that may close that they will 
not even be employed to think about 
paying for any gas prices no matter 
how much they might be. 
I stand with them to ensure that in-
flation goes down and that we respond 
to gasoline prices. But they are not 
clear in what we are doing today. We 
are helping small and hard-hit busi-
nesses—sole proprietors, independent 
contractors, and businesses that are 
not over 200 employees—to keep these 
employees who have suffered from the 
devastation of the pandemic. 
We are doing more. We are not spend-
ing an extra penny because we are cap-
turing those dollars from those who 
fraudulently used dollars before. So we 
are making good on our promise to 
spend the American tax dollars cor-
rectly. We are having a data collection. 
We are going to have oversight on this 
particular program to ensure that it is 
spent effectively. 
We are going to respond, if you will, 
to the needs of the mom and pops, the 
really oldest and distinguished res-
taurants like This is It in Houston, 
Texas; Burns Original BBQ; and J&J; 
as people who have stood the storm 
yet, have kept employees but that 
didn’t know whether they could keep 
their doors open. 
This is an important and vital piece 
of legislation. I support the underlying 
legislation, which is the bill that deals 
with relief for restaurants and other 
hard-hit small businesses and the un-
derlying rule. 
Don’t you get it?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4235 
April 6, 2022 
We are keeping businesses open and 
keeping people employed. That is what 
we are doing today. Support the rule 
and the underlying bill. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the rule to consider H.R. 
3807, the ‘‘Relief for Restaurants and Other 
Hard Hit Small Businesses Act of 2022,’’ 
which provides $70.6 billion in FY2022 for the 
Restaurant Revitalization Fund. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that this com-
mittee is reconsidering this critical piece of 
legislation for America’s restaurant owners. 
The American Rescue Plan made great 
progress in providing the funding in an equi-
table manner, prioritizing women, veteran, and 
economically and socially disadvantaged res-
taurant owners. In addition, the majority of 
funds were reserved for restaurants whose 
gross receipts were no more than $1,500,000 
dollars. 
It is essential to promote equity through the 
Restaurant Revitalization Fund Mr. Speaker, 
considering that only 8 percent of restaurants 
are owned by blacks and 23.8% of Asian 
owned businesses are restaurants. As legisla-
tors we must do everything we can to ensure 
their survival. 
To underscore the personal importance this 
funding holds to me, I would like to mention a 
widely loved, black owned, and historic Third 
Ward restaurant: Cream Burger. 
Cream Burger sits on the corner of Elgin 
and Scott and has been in operation for 60 
years. It is a cash only restaurant that has 
only had two additions to the menu across the 
entirety of its existence: chili cheese fries and 
bacon. 
The Greenwood family has been serving the 
residents of the Third Ward their delicious 
burgers and homemade ice cream for dec-
ades and has no plans of closing any time 
soon. 
The original owners of the restaurant, Verna 
and Willie Greenwood, opened the restaurant 
to generate their own income and create 
generational wealth, which they certainly have 
done. Ever since their tragic passing, the busi-
ness is now owned and operated by their 
daughters, Beverly and Sandra. 
Beverly and Sandra hope to pass the busi-
ness onto the next generation of children so 
they can, ‘‘see it through. Maybe 100 years,’’ 
Beverly said. 
The restaurant sees a range of Third Ward 
customers every day, from the students at the 
University of Houston to the cashiers working 
at the historic Houston Food Mart just down 
the street. 
Cream Burger is iconic in the city of Hous-
ton, and I hold it in the highest reverence. It, 
and so many restaurants like it, is one of 
those restaurants that would receive funds 
from this legislation. 
It is for that reason Mr. Speaker I support 
the rule to consider H.R. 3807, the ‘‘Relief for 
Restaurants and other Hard Hit Small Busi-
nesses Act of 2022.’’ It will help save so many 
businesses like the beloved Cream Burger, so 
I urge my colleagues to support the rule as 
well. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS). 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank my colleague for yielding me 
time to speak on this critical issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to defeat the previous question 
so we can take up H.R. 6858, the Amer-
ican Energy Independence from Russia 
Act. This commonsense legislation in-
troduced by Representatives MCMORRIS 
RODGERS
and WESTERMAN
would re-
quire President Biden to submit an en-
ergy security plan to Congress to 
evaluate U.S. oil and natural gas im-
ports, 
identify 
importing 
countries 
that pose an energy security risk to 
America, and encourage domestic pro-
duction of oil and natural gas to offset 
imports from Russia. 
In fact, in contrast to our colleague’s 
statement, Iowa is a leader in renew-
able energy. Fifty percent of our en-
ergy comes from renewable sources. We 
even pay restaurants for their unused 
and old cooking oil. We are an energy 
exporter, and it is all done without a 
government mandate. All of the oil im-
ported from Russia could be offset by 
ethanol made from corn in Iowa. 
In order for the U.S. to become en-
ergy independent and secure, we must 
have an all-of-the-above energy policy. 
We must unleash our natural resources 
and produce our own clean, efficient 
energy here at home to ensure low en-
ergy prices and promote American jobs 
in our communities. 
Rather than promoting policies that 
hamper U.S. energy production and 
ceding security to adversarial nations 
like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela, we 
should promote exploration here at 
home and unleash our potential. We 
must ensure that the current ban on 
Russian 
energy 
is 
sustainable 
by 
prioritizing U.S. energy production, in-
cluding biofuels. 
Just last week, the President re-
leased a budget proposal that included 
$45 billion on new taxes on domestic 
energy production. This comes on top 
of other disastrous decisions over the 
past year and a half such as those that 
halt the Keystone XL pipeline and the 
current delay over the 5-year program 
for offshore energy leasing in the Gulf 
of Mexico. These policies are not work-
ing for hardworking American families 
and businesses who are dealing with 
high inflation and skyrocketing gas 
prices. 
The American Independence from 
Russia Act would immediately approve 
the Keystone XL pipeline, remove re-
strictions on U.S. LNG exports, restart 
oil and gas leasing on Federal lands 
and waters, and protect energy and 
mineral development. These are key 
steps we can take to promote U.S. en-
ergy security, and we must take action 
now. 
For this reason, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question. Support H.R. 6858 to make 
America energy independent and se-
cure by voting ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I will 
say this, that I suspect when, hope-
fully, this bill becomes law and we 
have 
helped 
save 
the 
178,000 
res-
taurants around this country that a 
number of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle will be taking credit 
for it. I hope many of them vote for it 
despite their unwillingness to really 
have a conversation about it today and 
to talk about extraneous issues. 
Before I reserve the balance of my 
time, I include in the RECORD a Janu-
ary 24, 2022, article from CNBC entitled 
‘‘National Restaurant Association asks 
Congress for more grant money as omi-
cron hits industry.’’ 
[From CNBC, Jan. 24, 2022] 
NATIONAL
RESTAURANT
ASSOCIATION
ASKS 
CONGRESS FOR MORE GRANT MONEY AS OMI-
CRON HITS INDUSTRY 
(By Amelia Lucas) 
The National Restaurant Association is 
asking Congress to replenish the Restaurant 
Revitalization Fund as the Covid omicron 
variant hits operators’ businesses. 
Last year, lawmakers created the $28.6 bil-
lion fund to aid bars and restaurants strug-
gling in the wake of the pandemic. The 
grants were designed to make up for a res-
taurant’s full pandemic losses of up to $5 
million for a single location or $10 million 
for a business with fewer than 20 locations. 
Publicly traded companies were ineligible, 
but their franchisees could still apply. 
Since the fund was depleted, restaurants 
have been pushing for Congress to replenish 
it. Several lawmakers have introduced legis-
lation to do so, but the bills haven’t gained 
traction, 
and 
the 
Biden 
administration 
hasn’t appeared interested in supporting the 
measures. 
But the latest surge in Covid–19 cases and 
its impact on restaurants could change 
minds. 
The National Restaurant Association’s lat-
est survey of operators found that 88% of res-
taurants saw indoor dining demand wane be-
cause of the omicron variant. More than 
three-quarters of respondents told the trade 
group that business conditions are worse now 
than three months ago. And the majority of 
operators said their restaurant is less profit-
able now than it was before the pandemic. 
‘‘Alarmingly, the industry still hasn’t re-
created the more than 650,000 jobs lost early 
in the pandemic, a loss 45 percent more than 
the next closest industry,’’ the trade group’s 
top lobbyist, Sean Kennedy, wrote in a letter 
to congressional leadership for both parties. 
Kennedy also touted the benefits of the 
first round of RRF grants. The trade group 
estimates that more than 900,000 restaurants 
jobs were saved by the initial round of fund-
ing, and 96 percent of recipients said the 
grant made it more likely they could stay in 
business. A full replenishment of the fund 
would save more than 1.6 million jobs, ac-
cording to the trade group’s estimates. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I appreciate 
that my colleague from New York 
talks about an extraneous issue. But 
gas prices and the cost of energy in 
America is a serious issue, and it is fac-
ing every American. Every American is 
paying more at the pump, and they are 
facing the decision in their family 
budget of how they are going to use 
that. 
In 2020, the last administration added 
30 million barrels of oil to the Stra-
tegic Petroleum Reserve. Now the 
Biden administration is weighing a 
plan to release roughly 1 million bar-
rels of oil a day from this reserve for 
months on end, and this is after he re-
leased 30 million barrels in early March

and 50 million barrels of oil back in No-
vember which did nothing to prevent a 
spike in energy prices. 
Congresswoman MCMORRIS RODGERS 
and Congressman WESTERMAN have in-
troduced the American Energy Inde-
pendence Act to reverse President 
Biden’s disastrous anti-American en-
ergy policies. This bill is a real solu-
tion, and it needs to be heard. We need 
to talk about this to the American peo-
ple. 
This bill, H.R. 3807, that we have be-
fore us is not going to help restaurants 
and small businesses. But, of course, 
that is not the Democrats’ intention 
anyway. If it were, they would have 
brought this bill through committee 
and worked with Republicans to build 
an effective piece of legislation. 
Instead, their intention is to push 
this legislation through that sounds 
good so that they can use it as a talk-
ing point to distract from their failed 
policies. This bill is just another exam-
ple of the Democrats’ reckless spending 
habits. Their solution to the effects of 
inflation is to throw even more money 
at it. 
When will my colleagues learn that 
spending is what causes the inflation? 
It is time for more pro-growth poli-
cies, not government handouts. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule and 
the underlying bill, I ask Members to 
do the same, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, first let me thank my 
colleague and friend, Mrs. FISCHBACH. 
We spend a lot of time together in the 
Rules Committee, and I always appre-
ciate our conversations. While we may 
not agree on issues from time to time, 
I always appreciate her earnestness, 
and I appreciate her good work. 
I want to thank all of my colleagues 
for their words in support of the rule 
before us today. 
As I mentioned earlier, Congress 
acted last year to provide much-needed 
relief for restaurants and other small 
businesses, but we must do much more. 
Our economy simply cannot survive 
without small businesses, and it is 
paramount that we redouble our com-
mitment to ensuring their continued 
success. 
I pledge to always be an ally in that 
fight, and I know my colleagues join 
me in that. I look forward to voting in 
favor of this effort to bring much-need-
ed relief to local restaurants and the 
small business community. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. FISCHBACH is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1033 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this

curity, encourage domestic production of 
crude oil, petroleum products, and natural 
gas, and for other purposes. All points of 
order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. The bill shall be considered as read. 
All points of order against provisions in the

PURPOSE AND SUMMARY 
On January 6, 2021, a violent mob at-
tempted to impede Congress’s constitutional 
and statutory mandate to count the elec-
toral votes in the 2020 Presidential election 
and launched an assault on the United 
States Capitol Complex that resulted in mul-
tiple deaths, physical harm to more than 140 
members of law enforcement, and terror and 
trauma among staff, institutional employ-
ees, and press. In response, the House adopt-
ed House Resolution 503 on June 30, 2021, es-
tablishing the Select Committee to Inves-
tigate the January 6th Attack on the United 
States Capitol (hereinafter referred to as the 
‘‘Select Committee’’). 
The Select Committee is investigating the 
facts, circumstances, and causes of the Janu-
ary 6th attack and issues relating to the in-
terference with the peaceful transfer of 
power, in order to identify and evaluate 
problems and to recommend to the House 
and its relevant committees corrective laws, 
policies, procedures, rules, or regulations. 
This inquiry includes examination of the fac-
tors that influenced, instigated, or contrib-
uted to the attack and how various individ-
uals and entities coordinated their activities 
leading up to the attack. 
PETER K. NAVARRO 
According to published reports, Peter K. 
Navarro, a White House trade advisor, 
worked with Stephen K. Bannon and others 
to develop and implement a plan to delay 
Congress’s 
certification, 
and 
ultimately 
change the outcome, of the November 2020 
Presidential election. In November 2021, Mr. 
Navarro published In Trump Time, a book in 
which he described this plan as the ‘‘Green 
Bay Sweep’’ and stated that it was designed 
as the ‘‘last, best chance to snatch a stolen 
election from the Democrats’ jaws of de-
ceit.’’1 In a later interview about his book, 
Mr. Navarro added that former-President 
Trump was ‘‘on board with the strategy,’’ as 
were more than 100 Members of Congress.2 
Previously, Mr. Navarro had publicly re-
leased on his website a three-part report, 
dubbed ‘‘The Navarro Report,’’ repeating 
many claims of purported fraud in the elec-
tion that have been discredited in public re-
porting, by State officials, and by courts.3 
On February 9, 2022, Chairman BENNIE G. 
THOMPSON signed a subpoena for documents 
and testimony and transmitted it along with 
a cover letter and schedule to Mr. Navarro.4 
The subpoena required that Mr. Navarro 
produce responsive documents not later than 
February 23, 2022, and that Mr. Navarro ap-
pear for a deposition on March 2, 2022. 
When Select Committee staff emailed Mr. 
Navarro on February 9, 2022, asking whether 
he would accept service and had an attorney, 
Mr. Navarro replied only: ‘‘yes. no counsel.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

April 6, 2022 
Executive privilege[.]’’5
Select Committee 
staff then emailed the subpoena to Mr. 
Navarro. Within hours of receiving the sub-
poena, Mr. Navarro released a public state-
ment that clearly indicated he had no inten-
tion of complying with the Select Commit-
tee’s subpoena while also acknowledging 
that he had already publicly released infor-
mation that is relevant to the Select Com-
mittee’s investigation in his book: 
President Trump has invoked Executive 
Privilege; and it is not my privilege to 
waive. [The Select Committee] should nego-
tiate any waiver of the privilege with the 
president and his attorneys directly, not 
through me. I refer this tribunal to Chapter 
21 of In Trump Time for what is in the public 
record about the Green Bay Sweep plan to 
insure [sic] election integrity[.]6 
Mr. Navarro also appeared on national tel-
evision on February 10, 2022, discussing sub-
jects that were the focus of the Select Com-
mittee’s subpoena to him.7 
On February 24, 2022, Select Committee 
staff contacted Mr. Navarro via email about 
his failure to produce documents by the Feb-
ruary 23rd deadline in the subpoena. In the 
same email, staff reminded Mr. Navarro 
about the date for his deposition and notified 
him of its location within the U.S. Capitol 
campus. 
Staff 
also 
requested 
that 
Mr. 
Navarro contact the Select Committee for 
further details about the deposition or, alter-
natively, to notify the Select Committee if 
he did not plan to appear for deposition tes-
timony.8 
On February 27, 2022, Mr. Navarro con-
tacted Select Committee staff and said that 
‘‘President Trump has invoked [e]xecutive 
[p]rivilege in this matter; and it is neither 
my privilege to waive or Joseph Biden’s 
privilege to waive.’’9 Mr. Navarro did not 
provide any evidence that former-President 
Trump had ever invoked executive privilege 
with respect to any documents in Mr. 
Navarro’s personal possession or any testi-
mony that Mr. Navarro could provide. Select 
Committee staff responded the same day and 
explained that there are areas of inquiry 
that do not implicate ‘‘any executive privi-
lege concerns at all.’’10 Select Committee 
staff further informed Mr. Navarro that he 
could make executive privilege objections 
during his deposition and that he must do so 
on a ‘‘question-by-question basis’’ to ‘‘enable 
the Select Committee to better understand 
[his] objections and, if necessary, take any 
additional steps to address them.’’11 Select 
Committee staff then asked Mr. Navarro 
again whether he intended to appear for his 
deposition on March 2, 2022, as required by 
the subpoena. 
Later the same day, Mr. Navarro responded 
to the Select Committee’s email correspond-
ence. Instead of saying whether he intended 
to appear for his deposition, Mr. Navarro 
asked: ‘‘Will this event be open to the public 
and press?’’12
Select Committee staff re-
sponded that it would not be open to the 
press, that it would be a ‘‘staff-led deposi-
tion, which members of the Select Com-
mittee may also join and in which they may 
participate.’’13 Select Committee staff asked 
about Mr. Navarro’s document production 
and offered to find a new date for the deposi-
tion ‘‘within a reasonable time’’ if Mr. 
Navarro had a scheduling conflict on March 
2d.14 Mr. Navarro did not respond to that 
offer but, the next day, sent the Select Com-
mittee an email saying that he had ‘‘been 
clear in my communications on this matter’’ 
and that ‘‘it is incumbent on the Committee 
to directly negotiate with President Trump 
and his attorneys regarding any and all 
things related to this matter.’’15 
On February 28, 2022, the White House 
Counsel’s Office issued a letter to Mr. 
Navarro regarding the Select Committee’s 
subpoena. That letter stated: ‘‘[I]n light of 
the unique and extraordinary nature of the 
matters under investigation, President Biden 
has determined that an assertion of execu-
tive privilege is not in the national interest, 
and therefore is not justified, with respect to 
particular subjects within the purview of the 
Select Committee.’’16
The letter further 
noted that ‘‘President Biden accordingly has 
decided not to assert executive privilege’’ 
with respect to the testimony of Mr. Navarro 
‘‘regarding those subjects,’’ or with respect 
to ‘‘any documents [he] may possess that 
bear on them.’’ Further, the letter stated: 
‘‘For the same reasons underlying his deci-
sion on executive privilege, President Biden 
has determined that he will not assert im-
munity to preclude [Mr. Navarro] from testi-
fying before the Select Committee.’’17 
On March 1, 2022, Select Committee staff 
sent another email to Mr. Navarro about his 
appearance for testimony as required by the 
subpoena. Once again, Select Committee 
staff reminded Mr. Navarro that ‘‘there are 
topics that the Select Committee believes it 
can discuss with [him] without raising any 
executive privilege concerns at all, includ-
ing, but not limited to, questions related to 
[his] public three-part report about pur-
ported fraud in the November 2020 election 
and the plan [he] described in [his] book 
called the ‘Green Bay Sweep.’ ’’18
Select 
Committee staff told Mr. Navarro, again, 
that if there were any ‘‘specific questions 
that raise[d] executive privilege concerns, 
[he could] assert [his] objections on the 
record 
and 
on 
a 
question-by-question 
basis.’’19 Select Committee staff also pro-
vided Mr. Navarro with information regard-
ing the time and location of his deposition. 
Mr. Navarro did not respond to the March 
1st email from Select Committee staff. He 
has failed to produce documents or appear 
for his scheduled deposition by the deadlines 
in the February 9, 2022, subpoena.20 
Rather than appear for his deposition or 
respond directly to the Select Committee, 
Mr. Navarro issued a public statement re-
garding his deposition.21 Mr. Navarro pre-
dicted that his interactions with the Select 
Committee would be judged by the ‘‘Supreme 
Court, where this case is headed[.]’’22 Mr. 
Navarro, however, never filed any case seek-
ing relief from his responsibilities to comply 
with the Select Committee’s subpoena. 
In United States v. Bryan (1950), the Su-
preme Court emphasized that the subpoena 
power is a ‘‘public duty, which every person 
within the jurisdiction of the Government is 
bound 
to 
perform 
when 
properly 
sum-
moned.’’23 The Court recently reinforced this 
clear obligation by stating that ‘‘[w]hen Con-
gress seeks information needed for intel-
ligent legislative action, it unquestionably 
remains the duty of all citizens to cooper-
ate.’’24 
The contempt of Congress statute, 2 U.S.C. 
§ 192, makes clear that a witness summoned 
before Congress must appear or be ‘‘deemed 
guilty of a misdemeanor’’ punishable by a 
fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for 
up to 1 year.25 Mr. Navarro’s refusal to com-
ply with the Select Committee’s subpoena in 
any way represents willful default under the 
law and warrants referral to the United 
States Attorney for the District of Columbia 
for prosecution for contempt of Congress as 
prescribed by law. 
DANIEL SCAVINO, JR. 
According to many published reports, Dan-
iel Scavino, Jr., a long-time employee of 
former-President Trump, was responsible for 
social media and communications strategy 
for the former President, including with re-
spect to the Trump Campaign’s post-election 
efforts to challenge the 2020 election results. 
Mr. Scavino worked with Mr. Trump as part 
of the then-President’s campaign to reverse 
the election results. This campaign included, 
among other things, spreading false informa-
tion via social media regarding alleged elec-
tion fraud and recruiting a crowd to Wash-
ington for the events of January 6th. Mr. 
Scavino reportedly attended several meet-
ings with then-President Trump in which 
challenges to the election were discussed. 
Mr. Scavino also tracked social media on be-
half of former-President Trump, and he did 
so at a time when sites reportedly frequented 
by Mr. Scavino suggested the possibility of 
violence on January 6th. The Select Com-
mittee therefore has reason to believe that 
Mr. Scavino may have had advance warning 
about the potential for violence on January 
6th. 
Mr. Scavino did not only work as a White 
House official. He separately promoted ac-
tivities designed to advance Mr. Trump’s 
success as a Presidential candidate. He con-
tinued to do so after the 2020 election, pro-
moting activities designed to reverse the 
outcome of a lost election. 
Mr. Scavino’s public statements and re-
ported conduct make clear the relevance of 
his testimony and documents for the Select 
Committee’s investigation. 
On October 6, 2021,26 Chairman THOMPSON 
signed a subpoena for documents and testi-
mony and transmitted it along with a cover 
letter and schedule to Mr. Scavino.27 On Oc-
tober 8, 2021, U.S. Marshals served this sub-
poena at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Scavino’s reported 
place of employment, to Ms. Susan Wiles, 
who represented herself as chief of staff to 
former-President Trump and as authorized 
to accept service on Mr. Scavino’s behalf.28 
The subpoena required that Mr. Scavino 
produce responsive documents not later than 
October 21, 2021, and that Mr. Scavino appear 
for a deposition on October 28, 2021. Subse-
quent communications between counsel for 
Mr. Scavino and Chairman THOMPSON, how-
ever, did not result in Mr. Scavino’s agree-
ment to appear for testimony or produce 
documents. 
Attempting to reach an accommodation 
with 
Mr. 
Scavino, 
Chairman 
THOMPSON 
granted multiple extensions for the deposi-
tion and production of documents: 
∑ Per Mr. Scavino’s request for an exten-
sion, the Chairman deferred the document 
production deadline to October 28, 2021, and 
the deposition to November 4, 2021.29 
∑ Per Mr. Scavino’s request for an exten-
sion, the Chairman again deferred the docu-
ment production deadline to November 4, 
2021, and the deposition to November 12, 
2021.30 
∑ Per Mr. Scavino’s request for an exten-
sion, the Chairman deferred the document 
production deadline to November 5, 2021.31 
∑ Per Mr. Scavino’s request for an exten-
sion, the Chairman deferred the document 
production deadline to November 15, 2021, 
and the deposition to November 19, 2021.32 
∑ The Chairman extended the document 
production deadline to November 29, 2021, 
and the deposition to December 1, 2021.33 
∑ Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s de-
nial of a stay in Trump v. Thompson, the 
Chairman offered Mr. Scavino an additional 
opportunity to indicate his intent to cooper-
ate with the investigation and comply with 
the subpoena by February 8, 2022.34 
Despite all these extensions, to date, Mr. 
Scavino has not produced a single document, 
nor has he appeared for testimony. 
On March 15, 2022, the White House Coun-
sel’s Office issued a letter to Mr. Scavino’s 
attorney regarding the Select Committee’s 
subpoena. That letter stated, ‘‘President 
Biden has determined that an assertion of

executive privilege is not in the national in-
terest, and therefore is not justified, with re-
spect to particular subjects within the pur-
view of the Select Committee.’’35 Further, 
‘‘President Biden accordingly has decided 
not to assert executive privilege as to Mr. 
Scavino’s testimony regarding those sub-
jects, or any documents he may possess that 
bear on them. For the same reasons under-
lying his decision on executive privilege, 
President Biden has determined that he will 
not 
assert 
immunity 
to 
preclude 
[Mr. 
Scavino] from testifying before the Select 
Committee.’’36 
In United States v. Bryan (1950), the Su-
preme Court emphasized that the subpoena 
power is a ‘‘public duty, which every person 
within the jurisdiction of the Government is

to

any way represents willful default under the 
law and warrants referral to the United

for prosecution for contempt of Congress as 
prescribed by law. 
BACKGROUND ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE’S 
INVESTIGATION 
House Resolution 503 provides that the 
enumerated purposes of the Select Com-
mittee include investigating and reporting 
upon the ‘‘facts, circumstances, and causes 
relating to the January 6, 2021, domestic ter-
rorist attack upon the United States Capitol 
Complex . . . and relating to the interference 
with the peaceful transfer of power.’’40 As 
part of this charge, the Select Committee is 
examining the ‘‘influencing factors that fo-
mented such an attack on American rep-
resentative democracy.’’41 
The Supreme Court has long held that Con-
gress has a constitutional duty to conduct 
oversight. ‘‘The power of the Congress to 
conduct investigations is inherent in the leg-
islative process,’’42 and the capacity to en-
force said investigatory power ‘‘is an essen-
tial and appropriate auxiliary to the legisla-
tive function.’’43 ‘‘Absent such a power, a 
legislative body could not ‘wisely or effec-
tively’ evaluate those conditions ‘which the 
legislation 
is 
intended 
to 
affect 
or 
change.’ ’’44 
The oversight powers of House and Senate 
committees are also codified in legislation. 
For example, the Legislative Reorganization 
Act of 1946 directed committees to ‘‘exercise 
continuous watchfulness’’ over the executive 
branch’s implementation of programs within 
its jurisdictions,45 and the Legislative Reor-
ganization Act of 1970 authorized committees 
to ‘‘review and study, on a continuing basis, 
the application, administration, and execu-
tion’’ of laws.46 
The Select Committee was properly con-
stituted under section 2(a) of House Resolu-
tion 503, 117th Congress. As required by that 
resolution, Members of the Select Com-
mittee were selected by the Speaker, after 
‘‘consultation with the minority leader.’’47 A 
bipartisan selection of Members was ap-
pointed pursuant to House Resolution 503 on 
July 1, 2021, and July 26, 2021.48 
Pursuant to House rule XI and House Reso-
lution 503, the Select Committee is author-
ized ‘‘to require, by subpoena or otherwise, 
the attendance and testimony of such wit-
nesses and the production of books, records, 
correspondence, memoranda, papers, and 
documents as it considers necessary.’’49 Fur-
ther, section 5(c)(4) of House Resolution 503 
provides that the Chairman of the Select 
Committee may ‘‘authorize and issue sub-
poenas pursuant to clause 2(m) of rule XI in 
the investigation and study’’ conducted pur-
suant to the enumerated purposes and func-
tions of the Select Committee. The Select 
Committee’s authorizing resolution further 
states that the Chairman ‘‘may order the 
taking of depositions, including pursuant to 
subpoena, by a Member or counsel of the Se-
lect Committee, in the same manner as a 
standing committee pursuant to section 
3(b)(1) of House Resolution 8, One Hundred 
Seventeenth Congress.’’50 
PETER K. NAVARRO 
A. The Select Committee seeks information from 
Mr. Navarro central to its investigative pur-
poses. 
The Select Committee seeks information 
from Mr. Navarro central to its investigative 
responsibilities delegated to it by the House 
of Representatives. This includes the obliga-
tion to investigate and report on the facts, 
circumstances, and causes of the attack on 
January 6, 2021, and on the facts, cir-
cumstances, and causes ‘‘relating to the in-
terference with the peaceful transfer of 
power.’’51 
The events of January 6, 2021, involved 
both a physical assault on the Capitol build-
ing and law enforcement personnel pro-
tecting it and an attack on the constitu-
tional process central to the peaceful trans-
fer of power following a Presidential elec-
tion. The counting of electoral college votes 
by Congress is a component of that transfer 
of power that occurs every January 6th fol-
lowing a Presidential election. This event is 
part of a complex process, mediated through 
the free and fair elections held in jurisdic-
tions throughout the country, and through 
the statutory and constitutional processes 
set up to confirm and validate the results. In 
the case of the 2020 Presidential election, the 
January 6th electoral college vote count oc-
curred following a series of efforts in the pre-
ceding weeks by Mr. Trump and his sup-
porters to challenge the legitimacy of, dis-
rupt, delay, and overturn the election re-
sults. 
According to eyewitness accounts as well 
as the statements of participants in the at-
tack on January 6, 2021, a purpose of the as-
sault was to stop the process of validating 
what then-President Trump, his supporters, 
and his allies had falsely characterized as a 
‘‘stolen’’ 
or 
‘‘fraudulent’’ 
election. 
The 
claims regarding the 2020 election results 
were advanced and amplified in the weeks 
leading up to the January 6th assault, even 
after courts across the country had resound-
ingly rejected lawsuits claiming election 
fraud and misconduct, and after all States 
had certified the election results. As part of 
this effort, Mr. Trump and his associates 
spread false information about, and cast 
doubts on, the elections in Arizona, Pennsyl-
vania, Michigan, and Georgia, among other 
States, and pressed Federal, State, and local 
officials to use their authorities to challenge 
the election results. 
To fulfill its investigative responsibilities, 
the Select Committee needs to understand 
the events and communications in which Mr. 
Navarro reportedly participated or that he 
observed. He has publicly acknowledged 
playing a role in devising a post-election 
strategy to change the outcome of the elec-
tion and promoting claims of election fraud 
intended to further that strategy. These ac-
tions were outside his official governmental 
duties at the time. 
As Assistant to the President and Director 
of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, Mr. 
Navarro’s role in government was to assist 
the President in formulating and imple-
menting 
trade 
policy. 
Former-President 
Trump created Mr. Navarro’s position by 
Presidential Executive Order No. 13797 in 
2017.52 The mission of the office that Mr. 
Navarro led was to ‘‘defend and serve Amer-
ican workers and domestic manufacturers 
while advising the President on policies to 
increase economic growth, decrease the 
trade deficit, and strengthen the United 
States manufacturing and defense industrial 
bases.’’53 Additionally, the office’s respon-
sibilities included: ‘‘(a) advis[ing] the Presi-
dent 
on 
innovative 
strategies 
and 
promot[ing] trade policies consistent with 
the President’s stated goals; (b) serv[ing] as 
a liaison between the White House and the 
Department of Commerce and undertak[ing] 
trade-related special projects as requested by 
the President; and (c) help[ing to] improve 
the performance of the executive branch’s 
domestic procurement and hiring policies, 
including through the implementation of the 
policies described in Executive Order 13788 of 
April 18, 2017 (Buy American and Hire Amer-
ican).’’54 In March 2020, President Trump also 
signed Executive Order No. 13911, which 
named Mr. Navarro as the National Defense 
Production Act Policy Coordinator, which 
gave the Office of Trade and Manufacturing 
Policy authority to address potential short-
falls in pandemic-related resources such as 
ventilators and personal protective equip-
ment.55 
The Select Committee does not seek docu-
ments or testimony from Mr. Navarro re-
lated to his official duties as a Federal offi-
cial. None of the official responsibilities of 
Mr. Navarro’s positions included advising 
President Trump about the 2020 Presidential 
election or the roles and responsibilities of 
Congress and the Vice President during the 
January 6, 2021, joint session of Congress. 
Nor did those official duties involve re-
searching or promoting claims of election 
fraud. Nevertheless, after the 2020 Presi-
dential election, Mr. Navarro became in-
volved in efforts to convince the public that 
widespread fraud had affected the election. 
Federal law did not allow Mr. Navarro to use 
his official office to attempt to affect the 
outcome of an election.56 When Mr. Navarro 
engaged in these activities, and other activi-
ties described below, he was acting outside 
the scope of his official duties. 
In December 2020, Mr. Navarro released a 
three-part report on purported fraud in the 
election on his personal website. The chap-
ters of the report, titled ‘‘Volume One: The 
Immaculate Deception,’’ ‘‘Volume Two: The 
Art of the Steal,’’ and ‘‘Volume Three: Yes, 
President Trump Won’’ (collectively, ‘‘The 
Navarro Report’’), discuss, among other 
things, disproven claims of alleged voter 
fraud and cite to sources such as Stephen 
Bannon’s ‘‘War Room: Pandemic’’ podcasts 
and unsupported allegations from cases 
around the country that courts dismissed.57 
In a press call on December 17, 2020, to an-
nounce his report, Mr. Navarro acknowl-
edged that he wrote the report ‘‘as a private 
citizen’’ and, in doing so, wanted to address 
what he called ‘‘outright fraud’’ in the 2020 
Presidential election.58 
The Select Committee’s investigation has 
revealed that ‘‘The Navarro Report’’ was 
shared, in whole or in part, by individuals 
who made public claims about purported 
fraud in the election, including Professor 
John Eastman and then-White House Chief 
of Staff Mark Meadows.59
Notably, then- 
President Trump included a link to volume 
one of ‘‘The Navarro Report’’ in the same 
tweet in which he first announced that he 
would speak at a rally in Washington on 
January 6, 2021.60 Mr. Navarro has claimed 
that Mr. Trump ‘‘himself had distributed

April 6, 2022 
Volume One of the report to every member 
of the House and Senate’’ before January 6, 
2021.61 Specific allegations contained in ‘‘The 
Navarro Report’’ were also used as justifica-
tion in attempts to convince State legisla-
tors to de-certify their State’s popular vote 
and appoint Trump-Pence electoral college 
electors.62 And, the report was cited in liti-
gation that, if successful, would have re-
sulted in a declaration that the Vice Presi-
dent alone could decide which electoral col-
lege votes to count during the January 6, 
2021, joint session of Congress.63 
Mr. Navarro also reportedly worked with 
members of the Trump Campaign’s legal 
team to directly encourage State legislators 
to overturn the results of the 2020 election. 
On January 2, 2021, Mr. Navarro joined a call 
with Phill Kline, Rudy Giuliani, Professor 
John Eastman, John Lott, Jr., then-Presi-
dent Trump, and hundreds of State legisla-
tors. During the call, Mr. Navarro discussed 
his report on voter fraud and told the State 
legislators: ‘‘Your job, I believe, is to take 
action, action, action . . . The situation is 
dire.’’64 In that same call, Mr. Trump told 
the State legislators that they were the best 
chance to change the certified results of the 
Presidential election in certain States be-
cause ‘‘[y]ou are the real power . . . [y]ou’re 
more important than the courts. You’re 
more important than anything because the 
courts keep referring to you, and you’re the 
ones that are going to make the decision.’’65 
In the days leading up to January 6, 2021, 
according to evidence obtained by the Select 
Committee, Mr. Navarro also encouraged 
Mark Meadows (and possibly others) to call 
Roger Stone to discuss January 6th.66 When 
Roger Stone appeared to testify before the 
Select Committee and was asked questions 
about the events of January 6th, he repeat-
edly invoked his Fifth Amendment right 
against self-incrimination. 
Mr. Navarro wrote about ‘‘The Navarro Re-
port’’ and his efforts to change the outcome 
of the 2020 election in his recently published 
book, In Trump Time.67
In his book, Mr. 
Navarro described actions he took to affect 
the outcome of the election, including en-
couraging President Trump in early-Novem-
ber 2020 not to announce that he would seek 
election in 2024 because doing so would ac-
knowledge that he had actually lost the 2020 
Presidential election.68
Mr. Navarro also 
wrote that he called Attorney General Wil-
liam P. Barr to ask that the Department of 
Justice intervene and support President 
Trump’s legal efforts to challenge the results 
of the 2020 election, which Attorney General 
Barr refused to do.69 Mr. Navarro also wrote 
in his book that he kept a journal of post- 
election 
activities 
like 
those 
described 
above.70 
Mr. Navarro also claimed credit for con-
cocting a plan with Stephen Bannon to over-
turn the election results in various States 
dubbed the ‘‘Green Bay Sweep.’’71
In his 
book, Mr. Navarro described the ‘‘Green Bay 
Sweep’’ as ‘‘our last, best chance to snatch a 
stolen election,’’ and ‘‘keep President Trump 
in the White House for a second term.’’72 The 
plan was to encourage Vice President Mi-
chael R. Pence, as President of the Senate, 
to delay certification of the electoral college 
votes during the January 6th joint session of 
Congress and send the election back to the 
State legislatures.73 Mr. Navarro’s theory is 
similar to the theory that Professor John 
Eastman advocated before January 6th, and 
that President Trump explicitly encouraged 
during his speech on the Ellipse on January 
6th.74 On January 6th, the day to implement 
the ‘‘Green Bay Sweep,’’ Mr. Navarro had 
multiple calls with Mr. Bannon, including 
during and after the attack on the U.S. Cap-
itol.75 Mr. Navarro has stated that he be-
lieved his strategy ‘‘started flawlessly’’ but 
was thwarted when ‘‘two things went awry: 
[Vice President] Pence’s betrayal, and, of 
course, the violence that erupted on Capitol 
Hill, which provided [Vice President] Pence, 
[and Congressional leaders] an excuse to 
abort the Green Bay sweep.’’76 
This 
information 
demonstrates 
Mr. 
Navarro’s clear relevance to the Select Com-
mittee’s investigation and provides the foun-
dation for its subpoena for Mr. Navarro’s tes-
timony and document production. Congress, 
through the Select Committee, is entitled to 
discover facts concerning what led to the at-
tack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, as 
well as White House officials’ actions and 
communications during and after the attack. 
B. Mr. Navarro has refused to comply with the 
Select Committee’s subpoena for testimony 
and documents. 
On February 9, 2022, Chairman THOMPSON 
signed and issued a subpoena, cover letter, 
and schedule to Mr. Navarro ordering the 
production of both documents and testimony 
relevant to the Select Committee’s inves-
tigation into ‘‘important activities that led 
to and informed the events at the Capitol on 
January 6, 2021.’’77 Chairman THOMPSON’s let-
ter identified public reports describing Mr. 
Navarro’s activities and past statements, 
documenting some of the public information 
that gave the Select Committee reason to 
believe Mr. Navarro possesses information 
about matters within the scope of the Select 
Committee’s inquiry. 
The accompanying letter set forth a sched-
ule specifying categories of related docu-
ments sought by the Select Committee on 
topics including, but not limited to: 
∑ communications, documents, and infor-
mation that are evidence of the claims of 
purported 
fraud 
in 
the 
three-volume 
‘‘Navarro Report’’; 
∑ documents and communications related 
to plans, efforts, or discussions regarding 
challenging, decertifying, delaying the cer-
tification of, overturning, or contesting the 
results of the 2020 election; and 
∑ communications with Stephen Bannon, 
Members of Congress, State and local offi-
cials, other White House employees, or rep-
resentatives of the Trump reelection cam-
paign about election fraud and delaying or 
preventing the certification of 2020 Presi-
dential election. 
The subpoena required Mr. Navarro to 
produce the requested documents to the Se-
lect Committee on February 23, 2022, at 10 
a.m. and required Mr. Navarro’s presence for 
the taking of testimony on March 2, 2022, at 
10 a.m.78 
As described above, Mr. Navarro had a 
brief exchange with Select Committee staff 
after accepting service of the subpoena and 
also made public comments indicating that 
he would not appear or provide documents as 
required 
by 
the 
subpoena. 
Indeed, 
Mr. 
Navarro failed to produce any documents by 
the February 23, 2022, deadline, and did not 
appear for his deposition on March 2, 2022.79 
In his public and non-public communications 
with the Select Committee, Mr. Navarro 
vaguely referred to ‘‘[e]xecutive [p]rivilege,’’ 
with no further explanation, as his only rea-
son for failing to comply with the Select 
Committee’s subpoena. 
C. Mr. Navarro’s purported basis for non-com-
pliance is wholly without merit. 
Congress has the power to compel wit-
nesses to testify and produce documents.80 
An individual—whether a member of the 
public or an executive branch official—has a 
legal (and patriotic) obligation to comply 
with a duly issued and valid congressional 
subpoena, unless a valid and overriding privi-
lege or other legal justification permits non- 
compliance.81 In United States v. Bryan, the 
Supreme Court stated: 
A subpoena has never been treated as an 
invitation to a game of hare and hounds, in 
which the witness must testify only if cor-
nered at the end of the chase. If that were 
the case, then, indeed, the great power of 
testimonial compulsion, so necessary to the 
effective functioning of courts and legisla-
tures, would be a nullity. We have often 
iterated the importance of this public duty, 
which every person within the jurisdiction of 
the Government is bound to perform when 
properly summoned.82 
As more fully described below, the Select 
Committee 
sought 
testimony 
from 
Mr. 
Navarro on topics and interactions as to 
which there can be no conceivable privilege 
claim. Mr. Navarro has refused to testify in 
response to the subpoena ostensibly based on 
a blanket assertion of executive privilege 
purportedly asserted by former-President 
Trump. The Supreme Court has recognized 
an implied constitutional privilege pro-
tecting 
Presidential 
communications.83 
Under 
certain 
circumstances, 
executive 
privilege may be invoked to bar congres-
sional inquiry into communications covered 
by the privilege. However, the Court has held 
that the privilege is qualified, not absolute, 
and that it is limited to communications 
made ‘‘in performance of [a President’s] re-
sponsibilities of his office and made in the 
process of shaping policies and making deci-
sions.’’84 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
D.C. Circuit has already assessed generalized 
privilege assertions by Mr. Trump in relation 
to information sought by the Select Com-
mittee and purportedly protected by execu-
tive privilege. That court concluded that 
‘‘the profound interests in disclosure ad-
vanced by President Biden and the January 
6th Committee far exceed [Donald Trump’s] 
generalized concerns for Executive Branch 
confidentiality.’’85
Executive privilege has 
not been properly invoked with respect to 
Mr. Navarro, is not applicable to the testi-
mony and documents sought by the Select 
Committee, 
and 
does 
not 
justify 
Mr. 
Navarro’s refusal to appear in any event. 
1. President Biden decided not to invoke exec-
utive privilege to prevent testimony by Mr. 
Navarro, and Mr. Trump has not invoked 
executive privilege with respect to Mr. 
Navarro. 
In his February 9, 2022, email to the Select 
Committee before receiving the subpoena and 
reviewing the documents sought by the Se-
lect Committee, Mr. Navarro cryptically 
claimed, ‘‘[e]xecutive [p]rivilege,’’ but of-
fered no reason why executive privilege 
would shield from disclosure to the Select 
Committee all of Mr. Navarro’s testimony or 
the documents in Mr. Navarro’s personal 
custody 
and 
control.86
Moreover, 
Mr. 
Navarro has put forward no evidence to sup-
port a valid assertion of executive privilege. 
President Biden provided his considered 
determination that invoking executive privi-
lege, and asserting immunity, to prevent Mr. 
Navarro’s testimony and document produc-
tion would not be ‘‘in the national interest, 
and therefore is not justified, with respect to 
particular subjects within the purview of the 
Select Committee.’’87 Mr. Navarro has also 
offered no evidence that former-President 
Trump has asserted executive privilege, and 
the Select Committee has had no commu-
nications with the former President regard-
ing Mr. Navarro. Without an assertion of ex-
ecutive privilege by Mr. Trump to the Select 
Committee, and with the considered deter-
mination of the current President not to as-
sert any immunity or executive privilege, 
Mr. 
Navarro 
cannot 
establish 
the 
foundational element of a claim of executive 
privilege: an invocation of the privilege by 
the executive. 
In United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 7–8 
(1953), the Supreme Court held that execu-
tive privilege:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4240 
April 6, 2022 
[B]elongs to the Government and must be 
asserted by it; it can neither be claimed nor 
waived by a private party. It is not to be 
lightly invoked. There must a formal claim 
of privilege, lodged by the head of the de-
partment which has control over the matter, 
after actual personal consideration by that 
officer.88 
Here, President Biden has decided not to 
assert executive privilege. But even if this 
formal determination by the President as 
the head of the executive branch was not 
enough to stop the valid assertion of execu-
tive privilege (and it was with respect to Mr. 
Navarro), Mr. Navarro’s assertion cannot be 
valid because the Select Committee has not 
been provided with any invocation of execu-
tive privilege—whether formal or informal— 
by the former President.89 In any event, Mr. 
Navarro’s second-hand, categorical assertion 
of privilege, without any description of the 
specific documents or specific testimony 
over which privilege is claimed, is insuffi-
cient to activate a claim of executive privi-
lege. 
2. Even if Mr. Trump had actually invoked 
executive privilege, the privilege would 
not bar the Select Committee from law-
fully obtaining the documents and testi-
mony it seeks from Mr. Navarro. 
The law is clear that executive privilege 
does not extend to discussions relating to 
non-governmental business or among private 
citizens.90 In In re Sealed Case (Espy), 121 F.3d 
729, 752 (D.C. Cir. 1997), the court explained 
that the Presidential communications privi-
lege covers ‘‘communications authored or so-
licited and received by those members of an 
immediate White House adviser’s staff who 
have broad and significant responsibility for 
investigating and formulating the advice to 
be given the President on the particular 
matter to which the communications re-
late.’’ The court stressed that the privilege 
only applies to communications intended to 
advise the President ‘‘on official government 
matters.’’91 
The Select Committee does not seek infor-
mation from Mr. Navarro on trade policy or 
other official decision-making within his 
sphere of official responsibility. Rather, as 
noted above, the Select Committee seeks in-
formation from Mr. Navarro on a range of 
subjects unrelated to his or the President’s 
official duties or related to his communica-
tions with people outside government about 
matters outside the scope of Mr. Navarro’s 
official duties. These include the following 
topics: 
∑ Mr. Navarro’s interactions with private 
citizens, Members of Congress, or others out-
side the White House related to the 2020 elec-
tion or efforts to overturn its results, includ-
ing matters related to the ‘‘Green Bay 
Sweep’’ strategy for changing the election 
results that Mr. Navarro developed with Ste-
phen Bannon, who was not a White House 
employee during the relevant period; 
∑ the reports, and purported factual sup-
port for the reports, that Mr. Navarro him-
self acknowledged he prepared in his capac-
ity ‘‘as a private citizen’’; 
∑ the connections, involvement, and plan-
ning for January 6th events by Mr. Navarro, 
Roger Stone, and other individuals who have 
refused to provide testimony to the Select 
Committee; and 
∑ subjects covered by the book that he 
wrote and publicly released, such as private 
calls he made to Attorney General Barr to 
‘‘plead [the] case’’ for the Department of 
Justice to take action related to purported 
election fraud,92 his calls and meetings with 
Rudy Giuliani and others associated with the 
Trump reelection campaign,93 and his experi-
ence in Washington, DC, and around The Na-
tional Mall on January 6, 2021.94 
There is no conceivable claim of executive 
privilege over documents and testimony re-
lated to those topics. 
Moreover, any claim of executive privilege 
and the need to maintain confidentiality is 
severely undermined, if not entirely vitiated, 
by Mr. Navarro’s extensive public disclosure 
of his communications with the former 
President, including on issues directly impli-
cated by the Select Committee’s subpoena. 
Mr. Navarro’s recently published book de-
scribed his efforts to overturn the 2020 elec-
tion and several meetings with then-Presi-
dent Trump about those efforts. The day 
after he was served with the Select Com-
mittee subpoena, Mr. Navarro appeared on 
national television to discuss the subpoena 
and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. 
Mr. Navarro’s public disclosures relating to 
the very subjects of interest to the Select 
Committee foreclose a claim of executive 
privilege with respect to those disclosures.95 
Even with respect to Select Committee in-
quiries that involve Mr. Navarro’s direct 
communications with Mr. Trump, executive 
privilege does not bar Select Committee ac-
cess to that information. Only communica-
tions that relate to official Government 
business can be covered by the Presidential 
communications privilege.96
Based on his 
role as Director of Trade and Manufacturing 
Policy, Mr. Navarro may have had ‘‘broad 
and significant responsibility for inves-
tigating and formulating . . . advice to be 
given the President’’ on manufacturing or 
trade matters, in which case communica-
tions with the President related to those 
‘‘particular matters’’ might be within execu-
tive privilege.97
However, communications 
on matters unrelated to official Government 
business—and outside the scope of Mr. 
Navarro’s official duties—would not be privi-
leged.98 Indeed, the Select Committee did not 
intend to seek any information related to 
Mr. Navarro’s role as Director of Trade and 
Manufacturing Policy, and instead was con-
cerned exclusively with obtaining informa-
tion about events in which Mr. Navarro par-
ticipated or witnessed in his private, unoffi-
cial capacity. 
Moreover, even with respect to any sub-
jects of concern that arguably involve offi-
cial Presidential communications about offi-
cial Government business, the Select Com-
mittee’s need for this information to inves-
tigate the facts and circumstances sur-
rounding the January 6th assault on the U.S. 
Capitol and the Nation’s democratic institu-
tions far outweighs any generalized execu-
tive branch interest in maintaining con-
fidentiality at this point. The U.S. Court of 
Appeals has recognized this in circumstances 
when Mr. Trump has formally asserted exec-
utive privilege (unlike with Mr. Navarro),99 
and the incumbent President has concluded 
that ‘‘an assertion of executive privilege is 
not in the national interest, and therefore is 
not justified, with respect to particular sub-
jects within the purview of the Select Com-
mittee . . . [including] efforts to alter elec-
tion results or obstruct the transfer of 
power.’’100 
3. Mr. Navarro is not immune from testifying 
or producing documents in response to the 
subpoena. 
Finally, even if executive privilege may 
apply to some aspect of Mr. Navarro’s testi-
mony, he, like other witnesses, was required 
to produce a privilege log with respect to 
any withheld documents noting any applica-
ble privileges with specificity, and to appear 
before the Select Committee for his deposi-
tion to answer any questions concerning 
non-privileged information and assert any 
applicable privileges on a question-by-ques-
tion basis. He did none of those things. Al-
though he has not actually claimed that he 
is immune from testifying or producing doc-
uments to Congress, such a claim would not 
prevent Mr. Navarro’s cooperation with the 
Select Committee on the subjects described 
in this Report. 
As explained, President Biden has deter-
mined that it is not in the national interest 
to assert immunity that Mr. Navarro could 
claim would prevent testimony before the 
Select Committee. And neither former-Presi-
dent Trump nor Mr. Navarro have asserted 
any claim of testimonial immunity to pre-
vent Mr. Navarro from testifying in a deposi-
tion with the Select Committee. President 
Biden, on the other hand, affirmatively de-
cided not to assert such immunity. In any 
event, all courts that have reviewed pur-
ported immunity have been clear: even sen-
ior White House aides who advise the Presi-
dent on official Government business are not 
immune from compelled congressional proc-
ess.101 
The general theory that a current or 
former White House senior advisor may be 
immune from testifying before Congress is 
based entirely on internal memoranda from 
the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal 
Counsel (‘‘OLC’’) that courts, in relevant 
parts, have uniformly rejected.102 But even 
those internal memoranda do not claim such 
immunity from testimony for circumstances 
like those now facing Mr. Navarro. Those in-
ternal memoranda do not address a situation 
in which the incumbent President has de-
cided to not assert immunity. And by their 
own terms, the OLC opinions apply only to 
testimony ‘‘about [a senior official’s] official 
duties,’’ not testimony about unofficial ac-
tions or private conduct.103 Indeed, in OLC 
opinions dating back to, at least, the 1970s, 
OLC has qualified its own position by advo-
cating for the testimonial immunity of cer-
tain White House advisors before Congress 
‘‘unless [Congress’s] inquiry is related to their 
private conduct.’’104 As described in this Re-
port, the Select Committee seeks testimony 
from Mr. Navarro about, among other 
things, the ‘‘Green Bay Sweep’’ plan he de-
veloped to overturn the election and his cre-
ation and publication of ‘‘The Navarro Re-
port,’’ conduct that was not part of his offi-
cial duties and that he admittedly engaged 
in ‘‘as a private citizen.’’ Mr. Navarro is not 
immune from testifying before the Select 
Committee. 
Moreover, there is not, nor has there ever 
been, any purported immunity for senior 
White House advisors from producing non- 
privileged documents to Congress when re-
quired by subpoena to do so. Mr. Navarro did 
not produce any documents, and there is no 
theory of immunity that justifies his whole-
sale non-compliance with the Select Com-
mittee’s demand. 
For 
the 
reasons 
stated 
above, 
Mr. 
Navarro’s own conduct and the determina-
tion by the current executive would override 
any claim of privilege or immunity (even as-
suming Mr. Trump had invoked executive 
privilege with respect to Mr. Navarro). Fur-
thermore, Mr. Navarro has refused to appear 
and assert executive privilege on a question- 
by-question basis, making it impossible for 
the Select Committee to consider any good- 
faith executive privilege assertions. And, as 
discussed above, claims of testimonial im-
munity and executive privilege are wholly 
inapplicable to the range of subjects about 
which the Select Committee seeks Mr. 
Navarro’s testimony and that Mr. Navarro 
has seemingly acknowledged involve non- 
privileged matters. 
D. Mr. Navarro’s failure to appear or produce 
documents in response to the subpoena war-
rants holding Mr. Navarro in contempt. 
An individual who fails or refuses to com-
ply with a House subpoena may be cited for

contempt of Congress.105 Pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 
§ 192, the willful refusal to comply with a 
congressional subpoena is punishable by a 
fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for 
up to 1 year. A committee may vote to seek 
a contempt citation against a recalcitrant 
witness. This action is then reported to the 
House. If a contempt resolution is adopted 
by the House, the matter is referred to a U.S. 
Attorney, who has a duty to refer the matter 
to a grand jury for an indictment.106 
In a series of email correspondence, Select 
Committee staff advised Mr. Navarro that 
his blanket and general claim of ‘‘[e]xecutive 
[p]rivilege’’ did not absolve him of his obli-
gation to produce documents and testify in a 
deposition. Select Committee staff made 
clear that it wished to obtain information 
from Mr. Navarro about topics that would 
not raise ‘‘any executive privilege concerns 
at all’’ and that Mr. Navarro could assert 
any ‘‘objections on the record and on a ques-
tion-by-question 
basis.’’107
Mr. 
Navarro’s 
failure to appear for deposition or produce 
responsive documents constitutes a willful 
failure to comply with the subpoena. 
DANIEL SCAVINO, JR. 
A. The Select Committee seeks information from 
Mr. Scavino central to its investigative pur-
poses. 
Mr. Scavino’s testimony and document 
production are critical to the Select Com-
mittee’s 
investigation. 
Mr. 
Scavino 
is 
uniquely positioned to illuminate the extent 
of knowledge and involvement of the former 
President, Members of Congress, and other 
individuals and organizations in the plan-
ning and instigation of the attack on the 
Capitol on January 6th, including whether 
and how these various parties were collabo-
rating. Information in Mr. Scavino’s posses-
sion is essential to putting other witnesses’ 
testimony and productions into appropriate 
context and to ensuring the Select Com-
mittee can fully and expeditiously complete 
its work. 
Mr. Scavino served the former President in 
various roles related to social media ac-
counts and strategy, from the 2016 Presi-
dential campaign through his service across 
the tenure of the Trump administration, in-
cluding as Deputy Chief of Staff for Commu-
nications during the time most critical to 
the Select Committee’s investigation. Mr. 
Scavino’s activities on Mr. Trump’s behalf 
went beyond the official duties of a member 
of the White House staff. Mr. Scavino ac-
tively promoted Mr. Trump’s political cam-
paign through social media. Scavino was also 
reportedly present for meetings in November 
2020 where then-President Trump consulted 
with outside advisors about ways to chal-
lenge the results of the 2020 election.108 
Further, the Select Committee has reason 
to believe that Mr. Scavino was with then- 
President Trump on January 5th and Janu-
ary 6th and was party to conversations re-
garding plans to challenge, disrupt, or im-
pede 
the 
official 
congressional 
pro-
ceedings.109
Mr. Scavino spoke with Mr. 
Trump multiple times by phone on January 
6th,110 and was present with Mr. Trump dur-
ing the period when Americans inside the 
Capitol building and across the country were 
urgently calling on Mr. Trump for help to 
halt the violence at the Capitol, but Mr. 
Trump failed to immediately take actions to 
stop it.111 
The Select Committee also has reason to 
believe that Mr. Scavino may have had ad-
vance warning of the possibility of violence 
on January 6th. Public reporting notes that 
Mr. Scavino had a history of monitoring 
websites where, in the weeks leading up to 
January 6th, users discussed potential acts 
of violence.112 Whether and when the Presi-
dent and other senior officials knew of im-
pending violence is highly relevant to the 
Select Committee’s investigation and con-
sideration of legislative recommendations. 
And again, aside from official duties—in 
which close aides to the President should as-
sist him in fulfilling his oath—Mr. Scavino 
also engaged in activities promoting the 
Trump Campaign.113 Evidence acquired by 
the Select Committee confirms the widely 
known fact that Mr. Scavino worked closely 
with former-President Trump on his social 
media messaging and likely had access to 
the credentials necessary to post on the 
President’s accounts.114 Indeed, Mr. Scavino 
frequently composed specific social media 
posts and discussed specific language with 
the former President.115
During the time 
leading up to the January 6th attack, public 
messages issued from President Trump’s so-
cial media account that the Select Com-
mittee believes had the effect of providing 
false information and enflaming passions 
about a core tenet of our constitutional de-
mocracy. Specifically:

manager, about these and other similar com-
munications. 
Public reporting also notes that Mr. 
Scavino and his social media team had a his-
tory 
of 
monitoring 
websites 
including 
‘‘TheDonald.win,’’ 
an 
online 
forum 
fre-
quented by individuals who openly advocated 
and planned violence in the weeks leading up 
to January 6th.129 In the summer of 2016, 
former-President Trump himself engaged in 
a written question-and-answer session on a 
precursor 
to 
TheDonald.win 
called 
‘‘/r/ 
ThelDonald,’’ which was a subreddit (a 
forum on the website Reddit.com) at the 
time.130 The online Reddit community, which 
had upward of 790,000 users, was banned by 
Reddit in mid-2020,131 after which it migrated 
to 
another 
online 
forum 
located 
at 
TheDonald.win.132 
Mr. Scavino reportedly amplified content 
from this community, while his social media 
team also interacted with the site’s users. 
During the 2016 Presidential campaign, ‘‘a 
team in the war room at Trump Tower was 
monitoring social media trends, including 
[/r/ThelDonald] subreddit . . . and privately 
communicating with the most active users 
to seed new trends.’’133 Trump ‘‘campaign 
staffers 
monitored 
Twitter 
and 
[/r/ 
ThelDonald] subreddit, and pushed any 
promising trends up to social media director 
Dan Scavino, who might give them a boost 
with a tweet.’’134 In 2017, former-President 
Trump tweeted a video of himself attacking 
CNN.135
The video had appeared on /r/ 
ThelDonald 4 days earlier.136 In 2019, Politico 
reported that Mr. Scavino ‘‘regularly mon-
itors Reddit, with a particular focus on the 
pro-Trump /r/ThelDonald channel.’’137

April 6, 2022 
On December 19, 2020, the same day Mr. 
Trump tweeted ‘‘Big protest in D.C. on Janu-
ary 6th . . . Be there, will be wild!,’’ users on 
posts on TheDonald.win, began sharing ‘‘spe-
cific techniques, tactics, and procedures for 
the assault on the Capitol.’’138 The ‘‘ensuing 
weeks of communications on the site in-
cluded information on how to use a flagpole 
as a weapon, how to smuggle firearms into 
DC, measurements for a guillotine, and maps 
of the tunnel systems under the Capitol 
building.’’139 On January 5, 2021, a user on 
TheDonald.win encouraged Mr. Trump’s sup-
porters to ‘‘be prepared to secure the capitol 
building,’’ claiming that ‘‘there will be plen-
ty of ex military to guide you.’’140 
Multiple other posts on TheDonald.win 
made it clear that the U.S. Capitol was a tar-
get, with one poster writing that people 
should bring ‘‘handcuffs and zip ties to DC’’ 
so they could enact ‘‘citizen’s arrests’’ of 
those officials who certified the election’s re-
sults.141 Another post on TheDonald.win was 
headlined ‘‘most important map for January 
6th. Form a TRUE LINE around the Capitol 
and the tunnels.’’142 That ‘‘post included a 
detailed schematic of Capitol Hill with the 
tunnels 
surrounding 
the 
complex 
high-
lighted.’’143
One 
thread 
posted 
on 
TheDonald.win, 
and 
pertaining 
to 
Mr. 
Trump’s December 19, 2020, tweet, reportedly 
received more than ‘‘5,900 replies and over 
24,000 upvotes.’’144 The ‘‘general consensus 
among the users’’ on these threads ‘‘was that 
Trump had essentially tweeted permission to 
disregard the law in support of him.’’145 For 
example, one user wrote, ‘‘[Trump] can’t ex-
actly openly tell you to revolt. This is the 
closest he’ll ever get.’’146 
Just weeks before the January 6, 2021, at-
tack on the U.S. Capitol, former-President 
Trump shared content on Twitter that ap-
parently originated on TheDonald.win. On 
December 19, 2020, former-President Trump 
tweeted 
a 
video 
titled, 
‘‘FIGHT 
FOR 
TRUMP!- SAVE AMERICA- SAVE THE 
WORLD.’’147 The video had reportedly ap-
peared on TheDonald.win 2 days earlier.148 
Mr. Scavino also promoted the candidacy 
of Donald Trump and other political can-
didates on his own social media account. For 
example, he produced these public messages 
on Twitter:

Dan Scavino Jr.[American flag][Eagle]: 
[Tweeting out a video encouraging people 
to ‘‘Be a Part of History’’ and ‘‘Join the 
March’’ on January 6th.]152 
The Select Committee has a legitimate in-
terest in seeking information from Mr. 
Scavino about his activities that were out-
side the scope of his responsibilities as a 
Federal Government official. It is beyond 
reasonable dispute that the ‘‘stolen election’’ 
narrative played a major role in motivating 
the violent attack on the Capitol. Violent ri-
oters’ social media posts, contemporaneous 
statements on video, and filings in Federal 
court provide overwhelming evidence of this. 
To take just a few examples—though there 
are many others—statements from individ-
uals charged with crimes associated with the 
January 6th attack include: 
∑ ‘‘I’m going to be there to show support 
for our president and to do my part to stop 
the steal and stand behind Trump when he 
decides to cross the rubicon.’’153 
∑ ‘‘Trump is literally calling people to DC 
in a show of force. Militias will be there and 
if there’s enough people they may fucking 
storm the buildings and take out the trash 
right there.’’154 
∑ ‘‘Trump said It’s gonna be wild!!!!!!! It’s 
gonna be wild!!!!!!! He wants us to make it 
WILD that’s what he’s saying. He called us 
all to the Capitol and wants us to make it 
wild!!! Sir Yes Sir!!! Gentlemen we are head-
ing to DC pack your shit!!’’155 
Mr. Scavino’s promotion of the January 
6th events, his reported participation in mul-
tiple conversations about challenging the 
election, and his reported presence with 
then-President Trump as the attack unfolded 
and in its aftermath make his testimony es-
sential to fully understanding the events of 
January 6th, including Presidential activi-
ties and responses that day. His two distinct 
roles—as White House official in the days 
leading up to and during the attack, and as 
a campaign social media promoter of the 
Trump ‘‘stolen election’’ narrative—provide 
independent reasons to seek his testimony 
and documents. 
B. Mr. Scavino has refused to comply with the 
Select Committee’s subpoena for testimony 
and documents. 
On September 23, 2021, Chairman THOMPSON 
signed and issued a subpoena, cover letter, 
and schedule to Mr. Scavino ordering the 
production of both documents and testimony 
relevant to the Select Committee’s inves-
tigation into ‘‘important activities that led 
to and informed the events at the Capitol on 
January 6, 2021.’’156
Chairman THOMPSON’s 
letter identified public reports describing 
Mr. Scavino’s activities and past statements, 
and documented some of the public informa-
tion that gave the Select Committee reason 
to believe Mr. Scavino possesses information 
about matters within the scope of the Select 
Committee’s inquiry. 
The specific documents the Chairman or-
dered produced are found in the schedule in 
Appendix II, Ex. 6. The schedule identified 
documents including but not limited to 
those reflecting Mr. Scavino’s role in plan-
ning and promoting the January 6, 2021, rally 
and march in support of Mr. Trump; Mr. 
Trump’s participation in the rally and 
march; Mr. Scavino’s communications with 
Members of Congress or their staff about 
plans for January 6th; and communications 
with others known to be involved with the 
former President’s 2020 election campaign 
and subsequent efforts to undermine or cast 
doubt on the results of that election. 
The subpoena required Mr. Scavino to 
produce the requested documents to the Se-
lect Committee on October 7, 2021, at 10 a.m. 
ET and required Mr. Scavino’s presence for 
the taking of testimony on October 15, 2021, 
at 10 a.m.157 
The Select Committee was unable to lo-
cate Mr. Scavino for service and therefore 
issued a new subpoena on October 6, 2021.158 
On October 8, 2021, U.S. Marshals served this 
new subpoena at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Scavino’s 
reported place of employment, to Ms. Susan 
Wiles, who represented herself as chief of 
staff to former-President Trump and as au-
thorized to accept service on Mr. Scavino’s 
behalf.159 The subpoena required that Mr. 
Scavino produce responsive documents not 
later than October 21, 2021, and that Mr. 
Scavino appear for a deposition on October 
28, 2021.160 
On October 20, 2021, Stanley E. Woodward, 
Jr., of Brand Woodward Law notified the Se-
lect Committee that his firm had been re-
tained to represent Mr. Scavino.161 Per a 
telephone conversation later that day, Mr. 
Woodward notified the Select Committee 
that 
he 
was 
still 
in 
the 
process 
of 
ascertaining whether Mr. Scavino had re-
sponsive documents and requested an exten-
sion of the deadlines in the October 6, 2021, 
subpoena. The Select Committee granted an 
extension of 1 week, delaying the production 
deadline to October 28th and the deposition 
to November 4th.162 
On October 27, 2021, Mr. Woodward emailed 
to request an additional extension, and the 
Select Committee granted that request, 
postponing the production deadline to No-
vember 4th and the deposition to November 
12th.163 
On 
November 
2, 
2021, 
Mr. 
Woodward 
emailed to express difficulty in meeting the 
document production deadline. The following 
day, the Select Committee agreed to an addi-
tional production postponement to Novem-
ber 5th.164 
On November 5, 2021, rather than produce 
any responsive documents in his client’s pos-
session, Mr. Woodward communicated by let-
ter that his client would not be producing 
any documents. Instead, he asserted vague 
claims of executive privilege that were pur-
portedly relayed by the former President, 
but which have never been presented by the 
former President to the Select Committee.165 
Mr. Woodward’s letter cited an attached Oc-
tober 6, 2021, letter from former-President 
Trump’s counsel Justin Clark to Mr. Scavino 
that instructed him to ‘‘invoke any immuni-
ties and privileges you may have from com-
pelled testimony,’’ ‘‘not produce any docu-
ments concerning your official duties,’’ and 
‘‘not provide any testimony concerning your 
official duties.’’166 
On November 9, 2021, the Select Committee 
Chairman responded to Mr. Woodward re-
questing that Mr. Scavino provide a ‘‘privi-
lege log that specifically identifies each doc-
ument and each privilege that he believes 
applies,’’ and explained to Mr. Scavino that 
‘‘categorical claims of executive privilege 
are improper, and any claim of executive 
privilege must be asserted narrowly and spe-
cifically.’’ The Chairman also reminded Mr. 
Woodward that the subpoena demanded ‘‘all 
communications including those conducted 
on Mr. Scavino’s personal social media or 
other accounts and with outside parties 
whose inclusion in a communication with 
Mr. Scavino would mean that no executive 
privilege claim can be applicable.’’167 
The November 9th letter also detailed, at 
Mr. Woodward’s request, the various specific 
topics the Select Committee wished to dis-
cuss with Mr. Scavino at his deposition 
scheduled for November 12, 2021, and re-
quested that Mr. Woodward identify topics 
that he agreed did not implicate any privi-
leges and identify with specificity any privi-
leges that did apply to each specific topic. 
On November 10, 2021, following cor-
respondence with Mr. Woodward, the Select 
Committee agreed to an additional extension 
to November 15, 2021, for document produc-
tion and November 19, 2021, for the deposi-
tion, to allow Mr. Woodward additional time 
to discuss the November 9th letter with his 
client.168 
On November 15th, Mr. Woodward sent a 
letter refusing to provide the requested

privilege log and asserted that a such log 
would undermine the former President’s as-
sertions of privilege. Instead, Mr. Woodward 
identified categories of documents he be-
lieved to be privileged, including commu-
nications between Mr. Scavino and Members 
of Congress, and between Mr. Scavino and 
‘‘non-Government third-parties.’’169 
On November 18, 2021, Mr. Woodward sent 
another letter wherein he, for the first time, 
and following weeks of discussions about the 
items listed in the October 6th subpoena, 
challenged the service of that subpoena as 
deficient. He also challenged the Select Com-
mittee’s legislative purpose and demanded 
that the Select Committee provide a detailed 
explanation of the pertinence of every line of 
inquiry it intended to pursue at the sched-
uled deposition.170 
On November 23, 2021, the Select Com-
mittee issued yet another subpoena to Mr. 
Scavino, whose counsel agreed to accept 
service.171
The November 23rd subpoena 
granted a final extension of the document 
production deadline to November 29, 2021, 
and the deposition to December 1, 2021. The 
same day, the Select Committee transmitted 
a letter explaining the relevance of Mr. 
Scavino’s testimony to the Select Commit-
tee’s authorizing resolution and responding 
to the numerous specious objections in the 
November 18th letter.172 
On November 26, 2021, Mr. Woodward again 
wrote to the Select Committee and declined 
to comply with the subpoena for documents 
and testimony unless the Select Committee 
provided a detailed explanation of the perti-
nence of each of its expected questions and 
lines of inquiry for Mr. Scavino.173 He also 
reasserted Mr. Scavino’s refusal to testify in 
light of Trump v. Thompson,174 the since-re-
solved litigation regarding Mr. Trump’s abil-
ity to assert executive privilege over docu-
ments the incumbent President has already 
approved for release. 
Mr. Scavino failed to produce any docu-
ments by the November 29, 2021, deadline, 
and did not appear for his deposition on De-
cember 1, 2021.175 
On December 9, 2021, the Select Committee 
sent a letter to Mr. Woodward documenting 
Mr. Scavino’s failure to comply with the sub-
poena and informing him that the Select 
Committee would proceed to enforcement.176 
On December 13, 2021, Mr. Woodward re-
sponded in a letter disputing that Mr. 
Scavino had failed to cooperate with the in-
vestigation and reiterating many of his pre-
vious objections.177 
On February 4, 2022, in light of the Su-
preme Court’s denial of a stay and injunction 
sought by former-President Trump in Trump 
v. Thompson178 to prevent the National Ar-
chives from providing documents to the Se-
lect Committee on the basis of executive 
privilege, the Select Committee again con-
tacted Mr. Scavino and gave him an addi-
tional opportunity to comply.179 
On February 8, 2022, Mr. Woodward re-
sponded, asserting that Mr. Scavino still in-
tended to withhold information at Mr. 
Trump’s direction until the ultimate resolu-
tion of Mr. Trump’s claims.180 
C. Mr. Scavino’s purported basis for non-compli-
ance is wholly without merit. 
Congress has the power to compel wit-
nesses to testify and produce documents.181 
An individual—whether a member of the 
public or an executive branch official—has a 
legal (and patriotic) obligation to comply 
with a duly issued and valid congressional 
subpoena, unless a valid and overriding privi-
lege or other legal justification permits non- 
compliance.182 In United States v. Bryan, the 
Supreme Court stated: 
A subpoena has never been treated as an 
invitation to a game of hare and hounds, in 
which the witness must testify only if cor-
nered at the end of the chase. If that were 
the case, then, indeed, the great power of 
testimonial compulsion, so necessary to the 
effective functioning of courts and legisla-
tures, would be a nullity. We have often 
iterated the importance of this public duty, 
which every person within the jurisdiction of 
the Government is bound to perform when 
properly summoned.183 
It is important to note that the Select 
Committee 
sought 
testimony 
from 
Mr. 
Scavino on topics and interactions as to 
which there can be no conceivable privilege 
claim. Examples of those are provided below. 
The Select Committee is entitled to Mr. 
Scavino’s testimony on each of them, regard-
less of his claims of privilege over other cat-
egories of information and communications. 
In United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 703–16 
(1974), the Supreme Court recognized an im-
plied 
constitutional 
privilege 
protecting 
Presidential communications. The Court 
held though that the privilege is qualified, 
not absolute, and that it is limited to com-
munications made ‘‘in performance of [a 
President’s] responsibilities of his office and 
made in the process of shaping policies and 
making decisions.’’184 
Executive privilege is a recognized privi-
lege that, under certain circumstances, may 
be invoked to bar congressional inquiry into 
communications covered by the privilege. 
Mr. Scavino has refused to testify in re-
sponse to the subpoena ostensibly based on 
broad assertions of executive privilege pur-
portedly 
asserted 
by 
former-President 
Trump. Even if any such privilege may have 
been applicable to some aspect of Mr. 
Scavino’s testimony, he was required to 
produce a privilege log noting any applicable 
privileges with specificity and to appear be-
fore the Select Committee for his deposition, 
answer any questions concerning non-privi-
leged information, and assert any such privi-
lege on a question-by-question basis. 
1. President Biden decided not to invoke exec-
utive privilege to prevent testimony by Mr. 
Scavino, and Mr. Trump has not invoked 
executive privilege with respect to Mr. 
Scavino. 
As described above, President Biden con-
sidered whether to invoke executive privi-
lege and whether to assert immunity with 
regard to the subpoena for Mr. Scavino.185 He 
declined to do so with respect to particular 
subjects within the purview of the Select 
Committee, and the White House informed 
Mr. Scavino’s counsel of that decision in a 
letter on March 15, 2022.186 President Biden 
made this determination based on his assess-
ment of the ‘‘unique and extraordinary na-
ture of the matters under investigation.’’187 
Former-President Trump has had no com-
munication with the Select Committee. In a 
November 5th letter to the Select Com-
mittee, Mr. Scavino’s attorney referred to 
correspondence 
from 
former-President 
Trump’s attorney, Justin Clark, in which 
Mr. Clark asserted that the Select Com-
mittee subpoena seeks information that is 
‘‘protected from disclosure by the executive 
and other privileges, including among others 
the presidential communications, delibera-
tive 
process, 
and 
attorney-client 
privi-
leges.’’188 The Committee has received no 
such correspondence from or on behalf of 
former-President Trump. Without a formal 
assertion of executive privilege by Mr. 
Trump to the Select Committee, Mr. Scavino 
cannot establish the foundational element of 
a claim of executive privilege: an invocation 
of the privilege by the executive. 
In United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 7–8 
(1953), the Supreme Court held that execu-
tive privilege: 
[B]elongs to the Government and must be 
asserted by it; it can neither be claimed nor 
waived by a private party. It is not to be 
lightly invoked. There must a formal claim 
of privilege, lodged by the head of the de-
partment which has control over the matter, 
after actual personal consideration by that 
officer.189 
Here, the Select Committee has not been 
provided with any formal invocation of exec-
utive privilege by the President or the 
former President or any other employee of 
the executive branch. Mr. Scavino’s third- 
hand, categorical assertion of privilege, 
without any description of the specific docu-
ments or specific testimony over which 
privilege is claimed, is insufficient to acti-
vate a claim of executive privilege. 
2. Even if Mr. Trump had actually invoked 
executive privilege, the privilege would 
not bar the Select Committee from law-
fully obtaining the documents and testi-
mony it seeks from Mr. Scavino. 
Executive privilege does not extend to dis-
cussions relating to non-governmental busi-
ness or among private citizens.190 In In re 
Sealed Case (Espy), the D.C. Circuit explained 
that the Presidential communications privi-
lege ‘‘only applies to communications [with 
close Presidential advisers] in the course of 
performing their function of advising the 
President 
on 
official 
government 
mat-
ters.’’191
The court stressed: ‘‘The Presi-
dential communications privilege should 
never serve as a means of shielding informa-
tion regarding governmental operations that 
do not call ultimately for direct decision- 
making by the President.’’192 As noted by the 
Supreme Court, the privilege is ‘‘limited to 
communications ‘in performance of [a Presi-
dent’s] responsibilities,’ ‘of his office,’ and 
made ‘in the process of shaping policies and 
making decisions.’ ’’193 And the D.C. Circuit 
recently considered and rejected former- 
President Trump’s executive privilege asser-
tions over information sought by the Select 
Committee. That court concluded that ‘‘the 
profound interests in disclosure advanced by 
President Biden and the January 6th Com-
mittee far exceed his generalized concerns 
for Executive Branch confidentiality.’’194 
The Select Committee seeks information 
from Mr. Scavino on a wide range of subjects 
that it is inconceivable executive privilege 
would reach. For example, the Select Com-
mittee seeks information from Mr. Scavino 
about his interactions with private citizens, 
Members of Congress, or others outside the 
White House related to the 2020 election or 
efforts to overturn its results. And, among 
other things, the Select Committee also 
seeks information from Mr. Scavino about 
his use of personal communications accounts 
and devices. 
Even with respect to Select Committee in-
quiries that involve Mr. Scavino’s direct 
communications with Mr. Trump, it is well- 
established that executive privilege does not 
bar Select Committee access to that infor-
mation. Only communications that relate to 
official Government business and Presi-
dential decision-making on those official 
matters can be covered by the Presidential 
communications 
privilege.195
Here, 
Mr. 
Scavino’s conduct regarding several subjects 
of concern to the Select Committee is not re-
lated to official Government business. These 
include Mr. Scavino’s participation in calls 
and meetings that clearly concerned Mr. 
Trump’s campaign rather than his official 
Government business; participation in meet-
ings with Mr. Trump and others about a 
strategy for reversing the outcome of the 
2020 election; or efforts to promote the Janu-
ary 6th rally on the Ellipse. 
Moreover, even with respect to any sub-
jects of concern that arguably involve offi-
cial Government business, executive privi-
lege is a qualified privilege and the Select

Committee’s need for this information to in-
vestigate the facts and circumstances sur-
rounding the January 6th assault on the U.S. 
Capitol and the Nation’s democratic institu-
tions far outweighs any executive branch in-
terest in maintaining confidentiality.196 As 
noted by the White House, ‘‘an assertion of 
executive privilege is not in the national in-
terest, and therefore is not justified, with re-
spect to particular subjects within the pur-
view of the Select Committee.’’197 
3. Mr. Scavino is not immune from testifying 
or producing documents in response to the 
subpoena. 
Even if some aspect of Mr. Scavino’s testi-
mony was shielded by executive privilege, he 
was required to appear for his deposition and 
assert executive privilege on a question-by- 
question basis.198 Mr. Scavino’s refusal to do 
so made it impossible for the Select Com-
mittee to consider any good-faith executive 
privilege assertions. 
Mr. Scavino has refused to appear for a 
deposition based on his purported reliance on 
alleged ‘‘absolute testimonial immunity.’’ 
No court has recognized any such immunity, 
and Mr. Scavino has not provided any ration-
ale for applying any form of immunity to his 
unofficial actions assisting Mr. Trump’s 
campaign to overturn the election. President 
Biden—who now serves as the President—has 
declined to assert immunity in response to 
the subpoena to Mr. Scavino. 
As noted above,199 the general theory that 
a current or former White House senior advi-
sor may be immune from testifying before 
Congress is based entirely on internal memo-
randa from OLC, and courts have uniformly 
rejected this theory.200
But, as was also 
noted above,201 those internal OLC memo-
randa do not address a situation in which the 
incumbent President has decided to not as-
sert privilege, and by their own terms they 
apply only to testimony ‘‘about [a senior of-
ficial’s] official duties,’’ not testimony about 
unofficial actions or private conduct.202 
Many of the topics Chairman THOMPSON 
identified in his correspondence with Mr. 
Scavino’s counsel are unrelated to Mr. 
Scavino’s official duties and would neither 
fall under the reach of any ‘‘absolute immu-
nity’’ theory nor any privilege whatsoever. 
For instance: 
∑ Mr. Scavino was not conducting official 
and privileged business to the extent he at-
tended discussions regarding efforts to urge 
State legislators to overturn the results of 
the November 2020 election and guarantee a 
second term for Mr. Trump. 
∑ Mr. Scavino was not conducting official 
and privileged business to the extent he as-
sisted Mr. Trump with campaign-related so-
cial media communications, including com-
munications recruiting a violent crowd to 
Washington, spreading false information re-
garding the 2020 election, and any other com-
munications provoking violence on January 
6th. 
∑ Mr. Scavino was not conducting official 
and privileged business to the extent he com-
municated with organizers of the January 6, 
2021, rally, including Kylie Kremer and 
Katrina 
Pierson, 
regarding 
messaging, 
speakers, and even his own appearance and 
scheduled remarks at the event, which was 
not an official White House event but rather 
a campaign appearance.203 
∑ Mr. Scavino was not engaged in official 
and privileged business to the extent he used 
his personal social media accounts and de-
vices to coordinate with Trump campaign of-
ficials, including Jason Miller, throughout 
the fall and winter of 2020 regarding mes-
saging, campaign events, purported election 
fraud, and attempts to overturn the 2020 
election results.204 
∑ Mr. Scavino was not engaged in official 
and privileged business to the extent he 
counseled Mr. Trump regarding whether, 
how, and when to challenge or concede the 
2020 election. 
The Select Committee specifically identi-
fied to Mr. Scavino these and other topics as 
subjects for his deposition testimony, and he 
had the legal obligation to appear before the 
Select Committee and address them on the 
record. 
D. Mr. Scavino’s failure to appear or produce 
documents in response to the subpoena war-
rants holding Mr. Scavino in contempt. 
An individual who fails or refuses to com-
ply with a House subpoena may be cited for 
contempt of Congress.205 Pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 
§ 192, the willful refusal to comply with a 
congressional subpoena is punishable by a 
fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for 
up to 1 year. A committee may vote to seek 
a contempt citation against a recalcitrant 
witness. This action is then reported to the 
House. If a contempt resolution is adopted 
by the House, the matter is referred to a U.S. 
Attorney, who has a duty to refer the matter 
to a grand jury for an indictment.206 
In his November 9th and November 23rd 
letters to Mr. Scavino’s counsel, the Chair-
man of the Select Committee advised Mr. 
Scavino that his claims of executive privi-
lege were not well-founded and did not ab-
solve him of his obligation to produce docu-
ments and testify in deposition.207 The Chair-
man made clear that the Select Committee 
expected Mr. Scavino to produce documents 
and to appear for his deposition, which was 
ultimately scheduled for December 1st. And 
on February 4, 2022, the Chairman again in-
vited Mr. Scavino to appear before the Select 
Committee in light of the resolution of 
Trump v. Thompson. The Chairman again 
warned Mr. Scavino that his continued non- 
compliance would put him in jeopardy of a 
vote to refer him to the House to consider a 
criminal contempt referral. Mr. Scavino’s 
failure to appear for deposition or produce 
responsive documents in the face of this 
clear advisement and warning by the Chair-
man constitutes a willful failure to comply 
with the subpoena.

25 The prison term for this offense makes it a Class 
A misdemeanor. 18 U.S.C. § 3559(a)(6). By that classi-
fication, the penalty for contempt of Congress speci-
fied in 2 U.S.C. § 192 increased from $1,000 to $100,000. 
18 U.S.C. § 3571(b)(5). 
26 As explained below, the Chairman issued three 
subpoenas to Mr. Scavino. The first was dated Sep-
tember 23, 2021, but could not be served because Mr. 
Scavino could not be located. The second was dated 
October 6, 2021, and was served on October 8, 2021. 
After Mr. Scavino challenged service of the second 
subpoena, the Chairman issued a third on November 
23, 2021, and electronically served it on Mr. Scavino’s 
attorney.

56 Federal law requires a separation of duties for 
Federal officials who decide to engage in campaign 
activities. The Hatch Act generally prohibits offi-
cials, such as Mr. Navarro, from using their official 
authority or influence to affect the outcome of an 
election. See 5 U.S.C. § 7323(a); 5 C.F.R. § 734.101 (de-
fining ‘‘political activity’’); 5 C.F.R. § 734.302 (pro-
hibiting use of official title while engaged in polit-
ical activity). This would have prevented Mr. 
Navarro from acting as both a White House official 
and as a campaign official on certain matters or 
communications. See also ‘‘Investigation of Political 
Activities by Senior Trump Administration Officials

health, safety, and well-being of others 
present in the Chamber and surrounding 
areas. Members and staff will not be per-
mitted to enter the Hall of the House with-
out wearing a mask. Masks will be available 
at the entry points for any Member who for-
gets to bring one. The Chair views the failure 
to wear a mask as a serious breach of deco-
rum. The Sergeant-at-Arms is directed to en-
force this policy, Based upon the health and 
safety guidance from the attending physi-
cian and the Sergeant-at-Arms, the Chair 
would further advise that all Members 
should leave the Chamber promptly after 
casting their votes. Furthermore, Members 
should avoid congregating in the rooms lead-
ing to the Chamber, including the Speaker's 
lobby. The Chair will continue the practice 
of providing small groups of Members with a 
minimum of 5 minutes within which to cast 
their votes. Members are encouraged to vote 
with their previously assigned group. After 
voting, Members must clear the Chamber to 
allow the next group a safe and sufficient op-
portunity to vote. It is essential for the 
health and safety of Members, staff, and the 
U.S. Capitol Police to consistently practice 
social distancing and to ensure that a safe 
capacity be maintained in the Chamber at 
all times. To that end, the Chair appreciates 
the cooperation of Members and staff in pre-
serving order and decorum in the Chamber 
and in displaying respect and safety for one 
another by wearing a mask and practicing 
social distancing. All announced policies, in-
cluding those addressing decorum in debate 
and the conduct of votes by electronic de-
vice, shall be carried out in harmony with 
this policy during the pendency of a covered 
period.

CONGRESS 
REGULATIONS 
FOR USE OF DEPOSITION AU-
THORITY 
COMMITTEE ON RULES, 
HOUSE OF REPRH:8!1:NTAT!VES, 
Washington, DC, January 4, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
MADAM SPRAKER: Pursuant to section 3(b) 
of House Resolution 8, 117th Congress, I here-
by submit the following regulations regard-
ing the conduct of depositions by committee 
and select committee counsel for printing in 
the Congressional Record. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES P. MCGOVERN, 
Chairman, Committee on Rules. 
REGULATIONS FOR THE USE OF DEPOSITION 
AUTHORITY 
L Notices for the taking of depositions 
shall specify the date, time, and place of ex-
amination. Depositions shall be taken under 
oath a.dminietered by a member or a person 
otherwise authorized to administer oaths. 
Depositions may continue from day to day, 
2. Consultation with the ranking minority 
member shall include three days' notice be-
fore any deposition is taken. All members of 
the committee shall also receive three days 
written notice that a deposition will be 
taken, except in exigent circumstances. For 
purposes of these procedures, a day shall not 
include Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holi-
days except when the House is in session on 
such a day. 
3. Witnesses may be accompanied at a dep-
osition by personal, nongovernmental coun-
sel to advise them of their rights. Only mem-
bers, committee staff designated by the 
chair or ranking minority member, an offi-
cial reporter, the witness, and the witness's 
counsel are permitted to attend. Observers 
or counsel for other persons, including coun-
sel for government agencies, may not attend. 
4. The chair of the committee noticing the 
deposition may designate that deposition as 
part of a joint investigation between com-
mittees, and in that case, provide notice to 
the members of the committees. lf such a 
designation is made, the chair and ranking 
minority member of the additional com-
mittee(s) may designate committee staff to 
attend pursuant to regulation 3. Members 
and designated staff of the committees may 
attend and ask questions as set forth below. 
5. A deposition shall be conducted by any 
member or committee counsel designated by 
the chair or ranking minority member of the 
Committee that noticed the deposition. 
When depositions are conducted by com-
mittee counsel, there shall be no more than 
two committee counsel permitted to ques-
tion a witness per round. One of the com-
mittee counsel shall be designated by the 
chair and the other by the ranking minority 
member per round. 
6. 
Deposition questions shall be pro-
pounded in rounds. The length of each round 
shall not exceed 60 minutes per side, and 
shall provide equal time to the majority and 
the minority. In each round, the member(s) 
or committee counsel designated by the 
chair shall ask questions first, and the mem-
ber(s) or committee counsel designated by 
the ranking minority member shall ask 
questions second. 
7. Objections must be stated concisely and 
in a non-argumentative and non-suggestive 
manner. A witness·s counsel may not in-
struct a witness to refuse to answer a ques-
tion, except to preserve a privilege. In the 
event of professiona.l, ethical, or other mis-
conduct by the witness's counsel during the 
deposition, the Committee may take any ap-
propriate disciplinary action. The witness 
may refuse to answer a question only to pre-
serve a privilege. When the witness has re-
fused to answer a question to preserve a 
privilege, members or staff may (i) proceed 
with the deposition, or (ii) either at that 
time or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling 
from the Chair either by telephone or other-
wise. If the Chair overrules any such objec-
tion and thereby orders a witness to answer 
any question to which an objection was 
lodged, the witness shall be ordered to an-
swer. If a member of the committee chooses 
to appeal the ruling of the chair, such appeal 
mu11t be made within three days, in writing, 
and shall be preserved for committee consid-
eration. The Committee's ruling on appeal 
shall be filed with the clerk of the Com-
mittee and shall be provided to the members 
and witness no less than three days before 
the reconvened deposition. A deponent who 
refuses to answer a question after being di-
rected to answer by the chair may be subject 
to sanction, except that no sanctions may be 
imposed if the ruling of the chair is reversed 
by the committee on appeal. 
8. The Committee chair shall ensure that 
the testimony is either transcribed or elec-
tronically recorded or both. If a witness's 
testimony is transcribed, the witness or the 
witness's counsel shall be afforded an oppor-
tunity to review a copy. No later than five 
days aftsr the witness has been notified of 
the opportunity to review the transcript, the 
witness may submit suggested changes to 
the chair. Committee staff may make any 
typographical and technical changes. Sub-
stantive changes, modifications, clarifica-
tions, or amendments to the deposition tran-
script submitted by the witness must be ac-
companied by a letter signed by the witness 
requesting the changes and a statement of 
the witness's reasons for each proposed 
change. Any substantive changes, modifica-
tions, clarifications, or amendments shall be 
included as an appendix to the transcript 
conditioned upon the witness signing the 
transcript. 
9. The individual administering the oath, if 
other than a member, shall certify on the 
transcript that the witness was duly sworn. 
The transcriber shall certify that the tran-
script is a true record of the testimony, and 
the, transcript shall be filed, together with 
any electronic recording, with the clerk of 
the committee in Washington, DC. Deposi-
tions shall be considered to have been taken 
in Washington, DC, as well as the location 
actually taken once filed there with the 
clerk of the committee for the committee's 
use. The chair and the ranking minority 
member shall be provided with a copy of the 
transcripts of the deposition at the same 
time. 
· 
10. The chair and ranking minority mem-
ber shall consult regarding the release of 
deposition testimony, transcripts, or record-
ings, and portions thereof. If either objects 
in writing to a proposed release of a deposi-
tion testimony, transcript, or recording, or a 
portion thereof, the matter shall be prompt-
ly referred to the committee for resolution. 
lL A witness shall not be required to tes-
tify unless the witness has been provided 
with a copy of section 3(b) of H. Res. 8, 117th 
Congress, and these regulations.

present in the Chamber and surrounding 
areas. Members and staff will not be per-
mitted to enter the Hall of the House with-
out wearing a mask. Masks will be available 
at the entry points for any Member who for-
gets to bring one. The Chair views the failure 
to wear a mask as a serious breach of deco-
rum. The Sergeant-at-Arms is directed to en-
force this policy. Based upon the health and 
safety guidance from the attending physi-
cian and the Serg·eant-at-Arm11, the Chair 
would further advise that all Members 
should leave the Chamber promptly after 
casting their votes. Furthermore. Members 
should avoid congregating in the rooms lead-
ing to the Chamber. including the Speaker's 
lobby. The Chair will continue the practice 
of providing small groups of Members with a 
minimum of 5 minutes within which to cast 
their votes. Members are encouraged to vote 
with their previously assigned group. After 
voting, Members must clear the Chamber to 
allow the next group a safe and sufficient op-
portunity to vote. It is essential for the 
health and safety of Members, staff, and the 
U.S. Capitol Police to consistently practice 
social distancing· and to ensure that a safe 
capacity be maintained in the Chamber at 
all times. To that end, the Chair appreci11.tea 
the cooperation of Members and &ta.ff in pre-
serving order and decorum in the Chamber 
and in displaying respect and safety for one 
another by wearing a mask and practi.cin!I" 
social distancing. All announced policies, in-
cluding those addressing decorum in debate 
and the conduct of votes by electronic de-
vice, shall be carried out in harmony with 
this policy during the pendency of a covered 
period.

health, safety, and well-being of others 
present in tho Chamber and surrounding 
areas. Members and staff wm not be per-
mitted to enter the Hall of the House with-
out wearing a mask. Masks will he available 
at the entry points for any Member who for-
g-ets to bring one. The Chair views the failure 
to wear a mask as a serious breach of deco-
rum. Tho Sergeant-at-Arms is directed to en-
force this policy. Based upon the health and 
safety guidance from the attending physi-
cian and the Sergeant-at-Arms, the Chair 
would further advise that all Members 
should leave the Chamber promptly after 
Cflst,ing their votes. Furthermore, Members 
should avoid congregatlng in the rooms lead-
ing to the Chamber, including the Speaker's 
lobby. The Chair will continue the practice 
of providing small g-roups of Members with a 
minimum of fi minutes within which to cast 
t,he!r votes. Members are encouraged to vote 
with their previously assigned group. After 
voting, Members must clear the Chamber to 
allow the next gronp a safe and sufficient op-
portunity to vote. It is essential for the 
health and safet,y of Members, staff, and the 
U.S. Capitol Police to consistently practice 
social distancing and to ensure that a sflfe 
capao!ty be maintained in the Chamber at 
i.11 times. To that end, the Chair appreciates 
the cooperation of Members and staff in pre-
serving order and decorum in the Chamber 
and in displaying respect and safety for one 
Rnother by wearing a mask and practicing 
social distancing. All announced policies, in-
cluding those addressing decorum in debate 
and the conduct of votes by electronic de-
vice, shall be carried out in harmony with 
this policy during the pendency of a covered 
period.

Hon. NANCY PJ<JLOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
MADAM SP!IAKER: Pursuant to section 3(b) 
of House Resolution 8, 117th Congress, I here-
by submit the following regulations regard-
ing the conduct of depositions by committee 
and select committee counsel for printing in 
the Oongressional Record. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES P. McGOVERN, 
Chairman, Committee on Rules. 
REGULATIONS FOR THE USE OF DEPOSITION 
AUTHORITY 
1. Notices for the taking of depositions 
shall speotfy the date, time, aud place of ex-
amination. Depoe!tione shall be taken under 
oath administered by a member or a person 
otherwise authorized to administer oaths. 
Depositions may continue from day to day. 
2. Consultation with the ranking minority 
member shall include three days' notice be-
fore any deposition is taken. All members of 
the committee shall also receive three days 
written notice that a deposition will be 
taken, except in exigent circumstances. For 
purposes of these proeedures, a day shall not 
include Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holi-
days except when the House is in session on 
such a day. 
3. Witnesses may be accompanied at a dep• 
osition by personal, nongovernmental coun-
sel to advise them of their rights. Only mem-
bers, committee staff designated by the 
chair or ranlcing minority member, an offi-
cial reporter, the witness, and the witness's 
counsel are permitt,ed to attend, Observers 
or counsel for other persons, including coun-
sel for government agencies, may not attend. 
4. The chair of the committee noticing the 
deposition may designate that deposition as 
part of a joint investigation between com-
mittees, and in thflt case, provide notice to 
the members of the committees. If such a 
designation ls made, the chair and ranking 
minority member of the additional com-
mittee(s) may designate committee staff to 
attend pursuant to regulation 3. Members 
and designated staff of tbe committees mRy 
attend and ask questions as set forth below. 
5. A deposition shall be conducted by any 
member or committee counsel designated by 
the chair or ranking minority member of the 
Committee that noticed t,he deposition. 
When depositions are conducted by com-
mittee counsel, there shall be no more than 
two committee counsel permitted to ques- · 
tion a witness per round. One of the com-
mittee counsel shall be designated by the 
chair and the other by the ranking minority 
member per round. 
6. 
Deposition questions shall be pro-
pounded in rounds. The length of each round 
shall not exceed 60 minutes per side, and 
shall provide equal time to the majority and 
the minority. In each round, the member(s) 
or committee counsel deslgnated by the 
chair shall ask questions first, and the mem-
ber(s) or committee counsel designated by 
the ranking minority member shall ask 
questions second.. 
7. Objections must be stated concisely and 
in fl non-argumentative and non-suggestive 
manner, A witness's counsel may not in-
struct a witness to refuse to answer a ques-
t.ion, except to preserve a privilege. In the 
event of professional, ethical, or other mis-
conduct by the witness's counsel during the 
deposition, the Committee may take any ap-
propriate disolplinflry action. The witness 
may refuse to answer a question only to pre-
serve a privilege. When the witness has re-
fused to answer a question to preserve a 
privilege, members or staff may (i) proceed 
with the deposition, or (ii) either at that 
time or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling 
from the Chair either by telephone or other-
wise. If the Chair overrules any such objec-
tion and thereby orders a witness to answer 
any question to which an objection was 
lodged, the witness shall be ordered to an-
swer. If a member of the committee chooses 
to appeal the ruling of the chair, such appeal 
must be made within three days, in writing, 
and shall be preserved for committee consid-
eration. 'rl1e Committee's ruling on appeal 
shall be filed with the elerk of the Com-
mittee and shall be provided to the members 
and witness no less than three days before 
the reconvened deposition. A deponent who 
refuses to answer a question after being di-
rected to answer by the chair may be subject 
to sanction, except that no sanctions may be 
imposed if the ruling of the chair is reversed 
by the committee on appeal. 
8. The Committee chair shall ensure that 
the testimony is either transcribed or elec-
tronieally recorded or both. If a witness's 
testimony is transcribed, the witness or the 
witness's counsel shall be afforded an oppor-
tunity to review a copy. No later than five 
days after the witness has been notified of 
the opportunity to review the transcript, the 
witness may submit suggested changes to 
the chair. Committee staff may make any 
typographical and technical changes, Sub-
stantive changes, modlfications, clarifica-
tions, or amendments to the deposition tran-
script submitted by the witness must he ac-
companied by a letter signed by the witness 
requesting the changes and a statement of 
the witness's reasons for each proposed 
change. Any substantive changes, modifica-
tions, clarifications, or amendments shall be 
ineluded as an appendix to the transcript 
conditioned upon the wltness signing the 
transcript. 
9. The individual administering the oath, it' 
other than a member, shall eertify on the 
transcript that the witness was duly sworn. 
The transcr1ber shall certify that the tran-
script is a true record of the testimony, and 
the transcript shall be filed, together with 
any electronic recording, with the clerk of 
the committee in Washington, DC. Deposi-
tions shall be considered to have been taken 
in Washington, DC, as well as the location

member shall be provided with a copy of the 
transcripts of the deposition at the same 
time.

ly referred to the committee for resolution.

tify unless the witness has been provided

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4371 
April 6, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, by direction of the Select 
Committee to Investigate the January 
6th Attack on the United States Cap-
itol, I call up the resolution (H. Res. 
1037) recommending that the House of 
Representatives find Peter K. Navarro 
and Daniel Scavino, Jr., in contempt of 
Congress for refusal to comply with 
subpoenas duly issued by the Select 
Committee to Investigate the January 
6th Attack on the United States Cap-
itol, and ask for its immediate consid-
eration. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1023, the reso-
lution is considered read. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1037 
Resolved, That Peter K. Navarro and Daniel 
Scavino, Jr., shall be found to be in con-
tempt of Congress for failure to comply with 
congressional subpoenas. 
Resolved, That pursuant to 2 U.S.C. §§ 192 
and 194, the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives shall certify the report of the 
Select Committee to Investigate the Janu-
ary 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, 
detailing the refusal of Peter K. Navarro to 
produce documents or appear for a deposi-
tion before the Select Committee to Inves-
tigate the January 6th Attack on the United 
States Capitol as directed by subpoena, to 
the United States Attorney for the District 
of Columbia, to the end that Mr. Navarro be 
proceeded against in the manner and form 
provided by law. 
Resolved, That pursuant to 2 U.S.C. §§ 192 
and 194, the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives shall certify the report of the 
Select Committee to Investigate the Janu-
ary 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, 
detailing the refusal of Daniel Scavino, Jr., 
to produce documents or appear for a deposi-
tion before the Select Committee to Inves-
tigate the January 6th Attack on the United 
States Capitol as directed by subpoena, to 
the United States Attorney for the District 
of Columbia, to the end that Mr. Scavino be 
proceeded against in the manner and form 
provided by law. 
Resolved, That the Speaker of the House 
shall otherwise take all appropriate action 
to enforce the subpoenas. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided among and controlled 
by the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
THOMPSON), the gentlewoman from Wy-
oming (Ms. CHENEY), and an opponent, 
or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
THOMPSON), the gentlewoman from Wy-
oming (Ms. CHENEY), and the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. BANKS) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Mississippi. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include any extra-
neous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to start our de-
bate by talking a little bit about what 
the American people ought to expect of 
their leaders, of those who hold posi-
tions of public trust and the respon-
sibilities that come with it. 
I have been thinking about those re-
sponsibilities for more than 50 years, in 
all the time I have been fortunate 
enough to hold a position of public 
trust. It doesn’t matter if you are an 
alderman, a mayor, Member of Con-
gress, President of the United States, 
or a staff member working as a civil 
servant, or a political appointee. When 
you work for the public, when the peo-
ple’s taxes pay your salary, those jobs 
come with serious rules and serious ob-
ligations. 
Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro both 
held positions of public trust. Mr. 
Scavino was a top communications of-
ficial in the Trump White House. Mr. 
Navarro was a trade adviser. They each 
drew salaries paid by the American 
people to the tune of over $180,000 per 
year. They both were to abide by cer-
tain rules and obligations. They both 
swore oaths of allegiance to the Con-
stitution. 
The select committee wants to talk 
to both of them, but about a lot more 
than their White House jobs. We want 
to talk to them about their roles in 
trying to overturn the 2020 election. We 
subpoenaed them for their records and 
testimony. They told us to buzz off. 
Not a single record. No-shows for their 
deposition. 
Their excuse was: As former White 
House employees, the information we 
wanted—again, 
information 
about 
overturning an election—was shielded 
by executive privilege, a protection for 
the President to make sure sensitive, 
official conversations stay private. 
In other words, they are arguing that 
their roles in trying to overturn an 
election had to stay secret because 
they had official roles as advisers to 
the ex-President. 
If they want to make those claims, 
ridiculous as they sound, here is what 
the law requires: They need to show up 
and make those claims on the record, 
under oath. They refused to do that. 
That alone means they are in contempt 
of Congress. But I want to dig a little 
deeper into the argument these men 
are making. 
As I mentioned before, these are 
rules and obligations that bind public 
servants. One of the most important 
rule is that you can’t do campaign 
work on government time or using tax-
payer money. Pretty straightforward. 
Plenty you can do on your own time, 
but not when you are on the clock. 
That is the law. 
If you have heard of the Hatch Act, it 
has probably been when a Cabinet Sec-
retary or White House official had 
crossed the line from their official du-
ties into political matters. In fact, in 
2020, Mr. Navarro was dinged by a gov-
ernment watchdog for violating the 
Hatch Act by using his official role to 
attack President Joe Biden. That law 
prohibits, among other things, some-
one from using ‘‘official authority or 
influence for the purpose of interfering 
with or affecting the results of an elec-
tion.’’ 
Sounds familiar? In the case of Mr. 
Navarro and Mr. Scavino, trying to af-
fect the result of an election wasn’t 
knocking on doors or putting signs in 
people’s front yards. They were trying 
to help a defeated President stay in 
power. It is not conceivable that their 
involvement in that effort could have 
legally overlapped with their official 
duties. 
But beyond that, it was a betrayal of 
the oath these men took. It was a be-
trayal of the public trust. Even if you 
do it on your own time, trying to over-
turn an election is still trying to over-
turn an election. We know that the 
people who stormed this building on 
January 6 had the same goal: trying to 
overturn an election. That is what the 
select committee is investigating. That 
is why we need to hear from Mr. 
Scavino and Mr. Navarro. 
But as the select committee works to 
provide answers to the American peo-
ple, these two are saying: ‘‘I worked at 
the White House when all this took 
place. Even if I was plotting to over-
turn the government, I was collecting a 
government salary at the time, so I 
don’t have to talk about it.’’ 
Can you imagine? I have served my 
community and my country most of 
my life. Like my colleagues in this 
body, I have labored to uphold my oath 
and do right by the people I serve. I 
know my constituents expect that of 
me. 
To run into this kind of obstruction, 
this kind of cynical behavior, as we in-
vestigate a violent insurrection, is just 
despicable. It can’t stand. 
Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro must 
be held accountable for their abuses of 
the public trust. They must be held ac-
countable for their defiance of the law. 
They are in contempt of Congress, 
which is a crime, and I call on my col-
leagues to do their duty to defend this 
institution and the rule of law and to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the select committee 
has now conducted over 800 interviews 
and depositions of witnesses who have 
knowledge of the events of January 6. 
This includes more than a dozen former 
Trump White House staff members. 
Mr. Speaker, when you hear my col-
leagues make political, partisan at-
tacks on the select committee, I hope 
that all of us can remember some basic 
facts: Through these interviews, we 
have learned that President Trump and 
his team were warned in advance, and 
repeatedly, that the efforts they under-
took to overturn the 2020 election

April 6, 2022 
would violate the law and our Con-
stitution; they were warned that Janu-
ary 6 could, and likely would, turn vio-
lent; and they were told repeatedly by 
our State and Federal courts, by our 
Justice Department, and by agencies of 
our intelligence community, that the 
allegations of widespread fraud, suffi-
cient to overturn an election, were 
false and were unsupported by the evi-
dence. 
Yet, despite all of these specific 
warnings, President Trump and his 
team moved willfully through multiple 
means to attempt to halt the peaceful 
transfer of power, to halt the constitu-
tional process for counting votes, and 
to shatter the constitutional bedrock 
of our great Nation. 
As a Federal judge has recently con-
cluded, the illegality of President 
Trump’s plan for January 6 was ‘‘obvi-
ous.’’ 
We are here today to address two spe-
cific witnesses who have refused to ap-
pear for testimony before the com-
mittee. 
The committee has many questions 
for Mr. Scavino about his political so-
cial media work for President Trump, 
including his interactions with an on-
line forum called ‘‘theDonald.win’’ and 
with QAnon, a bizarre and dangerous 
cult. 
Mr. Scavino worked directly with 
President Trump to spread President 
Trump’s false message that the elec-
tion was stolen and to recruit Ameri-
cans to come to Washington on Janu-
ary 6 to ‘‘take back their country.’’ 
This effort to deceive was widely effec-
tive and widely destructive, and Don-
ald Trump’s stolen election campaign 
succeeded in provoking the violence on 
January 6. 
On this point, there is no doubt. The 
committee has videos, interviews, and 
sworn statements from violent rioters 
demonstrating these facts. 
Mr. Navarro will also be a key wit-
ness. He has written a book boasting 
about his role in planning and coordi-
nating the activity of January 6. We 
have many questions for Mr. Navarro, 
including about his communications 
with Roger Stone and Steve Bannon re-
garding the planning for January 6. 
As Judge Carter recently concluded: 
‘‘Based on the evidence, the Court finds 
it more likely than not that President 
Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct 
the joint session of Congress on Janu-
ary 6, 2021.’’ 
In the case of both of these witnesses, 
Mr. Speaker, the committee would 
rather have their testimony than have 
to move this contempt citation. When 
you hear my colleagues attack the se-
lect committee, remember Mr. Scavino 
and Mr. Navarro have chosen not to ap-
pear. They did not have to make this 
choice, but they did. 
In America, no one is above the law. 
Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Scavino 
nor Mr. Navarro is some form of roy-
alty. There is no such thing in America 
as the privileges of the crown. Every 
citizen has a duty to comply with a 
subpoena. 
Mr. Speaker, when you hear my col-
leagues challenge the committee’s leg-
islative purpose, remember the D.C. 
Circuit and the Supreme Court of the 
United States have affirmed our legis-
lative purpose. Too many Republicans 
are, once again, ignoring the rulings of 
the courts, as many of them did in the 
run-up to January 6. 
Mr. Speaker, the tale of what hap-
pened following the 2020 election, re-
sulting in the violence of January 6, is 
a tale of stunning deceit. It is a tale of 
lies about our election and contempt 
for the rulings of our courts. 
The election claims made by Donald 
Trump were so frivolous and so un-
founded that the President’s lead law-
yer did not just lose these cases; he 
lost his license to practice law. The 
New 
York 
Supreme 
Court 
found: 
‘‘There is uncontroverted evidence that 
Mr. Giuliani communicated demon-
strably false and misleading state-
ments to courts, lawmakers, and the 
public at large in his capacity as law-
yer for former President Donald J. 
Trump and the Trump campaign in 
connection with Trump’s failed effort 
at reelection in 2020.’’ 
b 1700 
Mr. Speaker, those in this Chamber 
who continue to embrace the former 
President and his dangerous and de-
structive lies ought to take a good, 
hard look at themselves. At a moment 
of real danger to our Republic, when 
the need for fidelity to our Constitu-
tion is paramount, they have aban-
doned their oaths in order to perform 
for Donald Trump. That will be their 
legacy. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not a close call. 
Mr. Navarro and Mr. Scavino have cho-
sen not to comply with a congressional 
subpoena. They are in contempt. I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this 
resolution, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope this is the last 
time that we do this. Just last week, 
we watched members of the January 
6th Select Committee criticize the DOJ 
for not jailing their political opponents 
fast enough. 
Now the committee is trying to refer 
two more of President Trump’s advis-
ers to the DOJ for criminal prosecu-
tion. The same DOJ, by the way, that 
has slandered concerned parents as do-
mestic terrorists; a DOJ overseen by a 
President who said President Trump 
should be prosecuted. 
So let’s be clear, we aren’t voting 
today to rename a post office. So, 
please, let’s be honest with ourselves. 
A vote to hold Dan Scavino and Peter 
Navarro in contempt of Congress is a 
vote to put them in jail for a year. Nei-
ther of these men deserve this. The 
party line isn’t a good enough excuse 
today. Disliking their politics isn’t an 
excuse. 
Mr. Scavino has two boys. He is a 
good dad. He doesn’t deserve this. His 
boys definitely don’t deserve this. So 
before we vote today, I have got to ask, 
could anyone here explain to those 
boys why their dad deserves to be be-
hind bars for a year? 
Mr. Scavino grew up in a working- 
class family in New York City. He is a 
former caddy who worked his way up 
to the White House through hard work 
and determination. Mr. Scavino lived 
the American Dream. Now, thanks to 
the select committee, he is living an 
authoritarian nightmare. 
The select committee will say that it 
is Mr. Scavino’s fault for refusing to 
cooperate. That is simply not true. Mr. 
Scavino asked time and again for the 
committee to follow the rule of law and 
provide him with a narrow and specific 
legislative purpose for the information 
that they were seeking. He asked, 
‘‘How is what you want from me perti-
nent to your investigation?’’ And they 
refused to explain. 
But remember what they said last 
week. The January 6th Committee 
must enforce its subpoenas. But con-
tempt is not enforcement; it is punish-
ment. Contempt won’t get the com-
mittee any information. Only the court 
can do that. But they don’t want to go 
to the judiciary. They don’t want neu-
tral arbitration. They want political 
punishment. 
The select committee has never been 
interested in factfinding. In fact, JIM 
JORDAN and I were both blocked from 
sitting on the committee because we 
promised to fully investigate the secu-
rity failure at the Capitol. The Demo-
crat leaders don’t want that. They 
claim they blocked us for being too 
partisan. 
Meanwhile, 
the 
committee’s 
lead 
staffer signed his name to a false letter 
calling the Hunter Biden laptop Rus-
sian disinformation. Apparently, lying 
to undermine democracy is a key qual-
ification for employment of this com-
mittee. 
If the January 6th Committee gets 
its way, Congress will have referred 
four former Trump officials for pros-
ecution in under 6 months, another 
record for the 117th Congress. 
The select committee aims to do two 
things: silence legitimate questions 
about the breakdown of security at the 
Capitol and punish their political oppo-
nents. It is that simple. 
Dan Scavino is accused of listening 
to his boss, the former Commander in 
Chief, who told him to ‘‘invoke all ap-
plicable privileges and immunities.’’ 
Today’s vote is not about wrongdoing, 
and it isn’t about anybody’s character, 
no matter what they say. 
Today’s vote is about the character 
of this House. It is about abusing the 
seat of our democracy to attack Amer-
ican democracy. The question is, do we 
live in a country where you can go to 
jail for working for the wrong politi-
cian? Would you want to live in that 
country? The question is, will you help 
create that country? Because I think 
we have had a pretty good thing going 
for the last 240 years, and that is ex-
actly why I urge all of my colleagues

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4373 
April 6, 2022 
to vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolution today. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, just for the record, let 
me say that we are here for this con-
tempt process today, but the Presi-
dent’s own daughter complied with the 
wishes of the committee. I would think 
that if his daughter complied with the 
wishes of the committee, everyone else 
should, even the people who worked for 
him. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER), the distinguished majority 
leader of the House. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from Mississippi 
for yielding. I thank the gentlewoman 
from Wyoming for her courage in 
standing for the truth. 
I disagree with many things that the 
previous speaker said. I disagree with 
his premises and with his conclusion in 
many respects. But I do agree with him 
on one thing: This vote is about the 
character of the House—I agree with 
him on that—which is why 435 of us 
ought to vote for this resolution, so 
that the House can do its duty. 
Madam Speaker, once again we are 
forced to take this step, asking the 
Justice Department to charge individ-
uals with criminal contempt for refus-
ing to answer subpoenas as issued by 
the committee investigating the at-
tack on our Capitol and our democracy 
on January 6, 2021. 
The two gentlemen of which the pre-
vious speaker spoke I don’t know. I 
have no quarrel with them individ-
ually. But we are a Nation of laws, not 
of men, and if we are to be a Nation of 
laws, then we need to respond to legal 
process; and if we think the assertions 
are wrong, we need to make our case. 
On the merits of this resolution there 
should be no doubt, and it is about the 
character of this House, the courage of 
this House to seek honesty, to seek 
truth. The individuals in question had 
intimate knowledge of the former 
President’s actions and decisions on 
that day. No matter who their children 
are, no matter what their life has been, 
they have knowledge that it is impor-
tant for the American people to have 
through their Representatives in Con-
gress. 
Americans must have a full account-
ing of what transpired on January 6 
and in the weeks leading up to it and 
perhaps subsequent. That is what the 
bipartisan select committee has been 
tasked with undertaking, by a vote of 
this House. Sadly, I expect maybe most 
of my colleagues across the aisle will 
vote against this resolution. It is about 
the character of this House. 
Perhaps they agree with the Repub-
lican National Committee, which has 
said that the violent Trump-led insur-
rection at the U.S. Capitol, the deaths 
and injury of U.S. Capitol police offi-
cers, and an effort to prevent the cer-
tification of an election was, and I 
quote the Republican National Com-
mittee, 
‘‘legitimate 
political 
dis-
course.’’ 
How can anybody make that asser-
tion? How can anybody in the Repub-
lican National Committee vote for it? 
Why doesn’t everybody on the Repub-
lican Party side of the aisle say, ‘‘That 
is not what we believe’’? Silence pre-
vails. 
There is no doubt that the insurrec-
tion on January 6 itself was a danger to 
our democracy, but I agree with The 
Washington Post columnist and former 
White House speech writer for Repub-
lican President George W. Bush, Mi-
chael Gerson, who wrote on December 
16, ‘‘It is Republican tolerance for the 
intolerable that threatens American 
democracy.’’ 
Very frankly, my friends on the 
other side of the aisle ought to be cele-
brating those in their ranks who have 
the courage to stand up for the truth. 
I have told LIZ CHENEY, if JOHN KEN-
NEDY were writing his book on Profiles 
in Courage today, I would urge him to 
include her and ADAM
KINZINGER
in 
that book. 
January 6 was a day of peril for 
America, but the greater crisis is when 
one of our two main political parties 
has become so hijacked by extremism 
and so enthralled to a dangerous dema-
gogue that it condones, even celebrates 
insurrection and violence. 
Madam Speaker, how can the same 
party that claims it honors law en-
forcement simultaneously declare that 
violent attacks against police officers 
are legitimate? How can one of our two 
political parties be so craven for short- 
term partisan gain that it is willing to 
encourage and condone insurrection? 
How can its Members use their sacred 
votes in the House, the people’s House, 
in an effort to impede the investigation 
of this dark and dangerous day in the 
history of our democracy? 
That is what this vote is about. Not 
only the character of this House, but 
the character of this country, the char-
acter of the people who demand, hope-
fully, truth, because that is what will 
set us all free. 
Because that is what this vote is 
about: Whether you believe that the 
violent attack on January 6, one in 
which a mob threatened the life of the 
Republican Vice President and threat-
ened the life of the Speaker of this 
House—the Speaker of all the House— 
in an attempt to overthrow our democ-
racy, does that constitute legitimate 
political discourse? Madam Speaker, I 
can’t believe Americans believe that. 
We must reject that theory, that the 
violence that we saw on January 6, the 
hate that we saw on January 6, is 
somehow 
legitimate 
political 
dis-
course, because if people believe that, 
then our democracy is in grave danger. 
This vote is about whether you believe 
a certain individual can be held above 
the law in our country. It is about 
whether you believe the American peo-
ple deserve to know all the facts about 
January 6 and whether those respon-
sible for the attack ought to be held re-
sponsible. And most fundamentally, 
Madam Speaker, it is about whether 
the Congress can fulfill its constitu-
tional responsibility and ability to de-
termine the truth. 
Madam Speaker, this vote will reveal 
to us who was willing to show toler-
ance for the intolerable. It will reveal 
to us who is willing to stand up and de-
fend our democracy and the rule of law, 
irrespective of party, irrespective of 
personality. That is a call to patriot-
ism, to love of country and to love of 
Constitution. 
My fellow colleagues, let us do our 
duty to the Constitution, to the Dec-
laration, to our democracy, and to the 
people we represent. Vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
think it is very important, as our col-
leagues consider their vote on this res-
olution, to keep in mind the facts. 
Number one, neither Mr. Scavino nor 
Mr. Navarro has appeared in front of 
this committee. As I mentioned ear-
lier, we have interviewed over 800 wit-
nesses. The vast majority of them have 
cooperated fully and answered our 
questions. Some of the witnesses have 
taken the Fifth. Some of the witnesses 
have answered some questions and as-
serted a privilege on other questions. 
But the notion that somehow the 
former President can instruct someone 
not to appear, that is not sustainable, 
that is not found anywhere in the law. 
If Mr. Scavino or Mr. Navarro wants to 
assert some kind of a privilege—and 
again, our questions for them have to 
do with their activities that are polit-
ical activities that are not covered by 
executive privilege, but if they wish to 
assert that privilege, they can appear 
and do so. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
would also note that in Trump v. 
Thompson, the D.C. Circuit held, and 
then we were upheld in the Supreme 
Court, that the committee’s need for 
this information outweighs the former 
President’s rights to any kind of con-
fidentiality. 
I think it is important for those facts 
to be clear and to be on the RECORD. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1715 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. GAETZ). 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, gas 
prices are rising; the border has be-
come a turnstile; inflation is crushing 
our fellow Americans; and here we are, 
back on the floor of the House, reliving 
January 6. 
Some of the members of the January 
6th Committee come from the swamps 
of Washington, D.C. I come from the 
swamps of Florida, and I know alli-
gator tears when I see them. Yet, we 
are lectured about performing for the 
former President. 
The reason Scavino and Navarro 
shouldn’t be held in contempt is that 
the January 6th Committee itself is so

performative, illegitimate, and uncon-
stitutional, kicking off the Repub-
licans that Leader MCCARTHY sent to 
serve on the committee. 
We were accused by the majority 
leader of having our party hijacked. 
Our party is ascendant, and time is on 
our side because when we take the ma-
jority back, this nonsense will come to 
an end. 
It is baffling to me that Democrats 
are so eager to conduct oversight over 
the last administration that is out of 
power, but it is hear no evil, see no 
evil, speak no evil when it comes to the 
Biden administration. 
They 
are 
more 
worried 
about 
Trump’s trade adviser than Joe Biden’s 
son 
trading 
influence 
for 
foreign 
money. 
They 
are 
more 
worried 
about 
Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff than 
deputizing the right folks to secure 
America’s border. 
The January 6th Committee is a 
sham. If you took the position of the 
committee, legally, no President would 
ever have privilege that would extend 
beyond the life of that Presidency. No 
President would have the ability to 
have candid conversations with staff 
and advisers that might not imme-
diately come back to bite them the 
moment they left the Oval Office. 
The American people see this for the 
partisan exercise that it is. Probably 
some folks at the Justice Department 
even see that it is a partisan exercise 
because not all of these contempt cita-
tions are well-received at the Justice 
Department right now. 
This contempt referral should simi-
larly be ignored and rejected, and cer-
tainly, it is a stain on this House. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
KINZINGER), a distinguished veteran of 
the Air Force and a member of the se-
lect committee. 
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, for all practical 
purposes, Dan Scavino’s career is Don-
ald Trump. Scavino was 16 when they 
met, and he is, to this day, a Trump 
stalwart. 
Scavino was central to the Trump ad-
ministration’s social media program. 
He was, for 2 years, President Trump’s 
Deputy Chief of Staff for Communica-
tions. Using social media to monitor 
trends and shape political views was 
Dan Scavino’s core business. 
He did that for Donald Trump during 
the 2016 campaign, and he kept doing it 
right on through the ‘‘stop the steal’’ 
and the fraudulent challenge to the 
2020 election. He also monitored ex-
tremist social media sites for the 
President. 
Dan Scavino was with the President 
on January 5 and 6. He spoke with 
Trump by phone several times on Janu-
ary 6 and was with the President as 
many urged him to help stop the vio-
lence at the Capitol. So, Dan Scavino 
could shed light on what then-Presi-
dent Trump thought would happen on 
January 6, especially the potential for 
violence. 
Did the President know that the 
rally could turn violent; that his rhet-
oric on the Ellipse could send an angry 
mob to storm the Capitol; that what on 
the evening of January 5 President 
Trump called a fired-up crowd might 
take it literally when, the next morn-
ing, he told them to ‘‘fight hard’’; that 
he was pouring fuel on the flames? 
Dan Scavino was there, so if he were 
willing to do his duty as a citizen, he 
could tell us a lot about that. But in-
stead, he has chosen to stiff-arm the 
American people. 
President Trump acknowledged that 
Scavino sometimes helped shape his 
tweets. 
On 
December 
19, 
Trump 
retweeted a video that urged viewers to 
‘‘fight for Trump.’’ The January 6 at-
tack was then just 21⁄2 weeks away. 
Why did Donald Trump retweet that 
particular message? Dan Scavino could 
give us the inside scoop. 
While Trump and his stop the steal 
gaggle were working hard to subvert 
the Constitution and steal the election 
for 
themselves, 
President 
Trump 
retweeted, after QAnon already had, a 
video called, ‘‘How to Steal an Elec-
tion.’’ 
What would Dan Scavino say about 
why Trump retweeted a QAnon-blessed 
video on how to steal an election? He 
won’t risk telling us. 
What did President Trump’s extrem-
ist followers on ‘‘The Donald’’ and 
other hard-right sites make of Trump 
urging them to join a wild protest on 
January 6? Polls show that some took 
it as marching orders, in fact. Dan 
Scavino had to know they would. 
Dan Scavino knew very well what his 
boss wanted. He knew that sites like 
‘‘The Donald’’ attracted violent ex-
tremists. Scavino himself sent out a 
video that a user on that site under-
stood as literal marching orders and 
literal war drums. 
President Trump and Dan Scavino 
had been in the White House for 4 years 
by then. They knew the January 6 
crowd could turn violent. They knew 
exactly what they were doing. 
We are here today because Dan 
Scavino, a key witness, is unwilling to 
speak with us. He failed to produce a 
single document in response to the sub-
poena, and he has clearly demonstrated 
his complete and utter contempt for 
Congress. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MCCOLLUM). The time of the gentleman 
has expired. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman 
an additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding time. 
Dan Scavino’s blatant disregard for 
our subpoena is his effort to ensure 
that Congress and the American people 
never get the firsthand story that he 
has to tell. 
None of us should find that accept-
able. It is contempt for the law and 
contempt for Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of this resolu-
tion. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. AGUILAR). 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the vice chair for yielding time. 
Madam Speaker, we have been en-
trusted by the American people to in-
vestigate the attempt to overturn a 
free and fair election. That attempt to 
subvert the will of the American people 
resulted in a deadly attack on the peo-
ple in this building. But it was bigger 
than just 1 day of violence and destruc-
tion that resulted in the deaths of U.S. 
Capitol Police officers. 
For weeks, various schemes were 
hatched by individuals, ranging from 
State legislators to the former Presi-
dent’s senior aides to Members of Con-
gress, with a singular objective: Keep 
Donald Trump in office. 
These are the facts, Madam Speaker, 
facts that were backed up last week by 
a Federal judge, who, after reviewing 
some of the evidence our committee 
has in its possession, said, in part, 
‘‘The illegality of the plan was obvi-
ous.’’ 
We are here today to hold two indi-
viduals involved, Peter Navarro and 
Dan Scavino, in contempt of Congress. 
Peter Navarro has failed to comply 
with our investigation in any way de-
spite the fact that he has given mul-
tiple 
TV 
interviews. 
In 
fact, 
Mr. 
Navarro appeared on television in sup-
port of the former President’s failed re-
election efforts, so much so that he was 
found to have repeatedly violated the 
Hatch Act. 
But his political work did not stop 
when the election was over. We know 
Mr. Navarro led a call with State legis-
lators about the efforts to convince 
Vice President Pence to delay election 
certification for 10 days. We know Mr. 
Navarro spoke to Steve Bannon, both 
during and after the attack on the U.S. 
Capitol. 
Mr. Navarro has publicly stated that 
he is protected by executive privilege, 
but he has never sought counsel, as 
others have, and he has not filed any 
case seeking relief from his responsibil-
ities to comply with our lawful sub-
poena. 
This is a textbook case for contempt, 
Madam Speaker. While I am not sur-
prised by some of my colleagues who 
refuse to pull their heads out of the 
sand and face the facts of what really 
happened and continues to happen, I 
remain deeply concerned about what 
this country looks like if the perpetra-
tors aren’t held accountable. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support House Resolution 
1037. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from North 
Dakota (Mr. ARMSTRONG). 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, 
the fact is, President Trump has ex-
erted executive privilege, and Mr. 
Scavino has raised the issue of execu-
tive privilege at President Trump’s re-
quest.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4375 
April 6, 2022 
No matter how much my colleagues 
on the other side want to say dif-
ferently, it is a legitimate assertion, 
considering the D.C. Circuit Court, in 
Nixon v. Administrator, held that the 
executive privilege can be raised by a 
former President, a determination re-
cently 
reinforced 
by 
Justice 
Kavanaugh in Trump v. Thompson by 
stating that the right of a former 
President to assert executive privilege 
exists, even if the sitting President 
does not support that privilege. Con-
cluding otherwise would, in fact, actu-
ally eviscerate the privilege in total. 
Keep in mind that the ruling on exec-
utive privilege in Trump v. Thompson 
deals with a narrow set of documents 
from the National Archives. It has no 
bearing on whether Mr. Scavino testi-
fies. The ruling does not apply to docu-
ments at issue in this case, nor does it 
apply to the testimony sought by the 
committee or whether the committee 
has a legitimate purpose for conversa-
tions between President Trump and his 
aide. 
The select committee has refused to 
acknowledge President Trump’s asser-
tion of privilege as it applies to Mr. 
Scavino, and the committee takes an 
overexpansive view of what Trump v. 
Thompson actually says and fails to 
even acknowledge that the Supreme 
Court case of Nixon v. Administrator 
exists. 
This is not a settled question, and it 
is not nearly as clear-cut as some 
would have you believe. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
LOFGREN), the chairperson of the Com-
mittee on House Administration and a 
member of the select committee. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, no 
one is above the law. 
We have all heard that phrase. It is a 
bedrock principle, and we know it is 
what distinguishes democracies like 
ours from autocracies such as Russia. 
Sadly, a few of the former President’s 
closest aides and allies seem to think 
they are special, that they are above 
the law, including senior communica-
tions official Daniel Scavino, Jr. 
Now, who is he? According to many 
reports, Mr. Scavino worked with the 
former President to use social media to 
spread lies regarding nonexistent elec-
tion fraud and to recruit a violent, 
angry mob to D.C. 
Mr. Scavino also followed violent, ex-
tremist social media on behalf of Mr. 
Trump. We have reason to believe that 
doing so provided Mr. Scavino with ex-
plicit advance warnings of the violence 
that was to occur on January 6. He 
may have shared these warnings of vio-
lence with Mr. Trump before the 6th, 
and we need to ask him about that. 
He reportedly attended several meet-
ings with Mr. Trump and others re-
garding reversing the legitimate vic-
tory of President Biden and was also 
with the former President during the 
Capitol attack when Mr. Trump failed 
to immediately try to stop it, despite 
urgent bipartisan calls for him to do 
so. 
Madam Speaker, a Federal court re-
cently concluded that Mr. Trump like-
ly committed a Federal felony and that 
he and his allies ‘‘launched a campaign 
to overturn a democratic election’’ 
that ‘‘spurred violent attacks on the 
seat of our Nation’s government, led to 
the deaths of several law enforcement 
officers, and deepened public distrust 
in our political process.’’ 
The court said that his effort was ‘‘a 
coup in search of a legal theory.’’ The 
court found that if President Trump’s 
‘‘plan had worked, it would have per-
manently ended the peaceful transition 
of power, undermining American de-
mocracy and the Constitution.’’ 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
have 
agreed that the very foundation of our 
constitutional republic was threatened. 
We must prevent that from ever hap-
pening again. 
Senate 
Minority 
Leader 
MITCH 
MCCONNELL rightly explained that the 
public needs to know everything about 
what caused and occurred on January 
6. To inform both the American people 
and legislative reform proposals, the 
select committee needs to speak with 
Mr. Scavino. He has to fulfill his legal 
and moral obligation to provide testi-
mony and documents. Otherwise, he 
should face consequences. 
We must vote ‘‘yes’’ on this resolu-
tion to find him in contempt of Con-
gress. In the United States of America, 
no one, including Mr. Scavino, is above 
the law. 
b 1730 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I know my colleague and friend, Mr. 
ARMSTRONG, knows very well that, first 
of all, executive privilege is a qualified 
privilege. 
Secondly, former President Trump 
has not asserted executive privilege. 
Third, I have tremendous respect, ob-
viously, for Justice Kavanaugh, but my 
colleagues continue to quote Justice 
Kavanaugh without noting that the 
opinion in the D.C. circuit, which was 
upheld by the Supreme Court, in that 
opinion the judge found a number of 
things, including ‘‘to allow the privi-
lege of a no-longer sitting President to 
prevail over Congress’ need to inves-
tigate a violent attack on its home and 
its constitutional operations would 
gravely impair the basic function of 
the legislature.’’ 
The Court also held that under any of 
the tests advocated by former Presi-
dent Trump, the profound interests in 
disclosure advanced by President Biden 
and the Select Committee to Inves-
tigate the January 6th Attack on the 
United States Capitol far exceed his 
generalized 
concerns 
for 
executive 
branch confidentiality. 
And I would just repeat again, 
Madam Speaker, that Mr. Scavino and 
Mr. Navarro both have chosen not to 
appear in front of the committee to an-
swer questions that are clearly outside 
of any potential claim of privilege they 
may have, and even if they believe 
there is a claim of privilege, they are 
obligated to appear and make that as-
sertion. They cannot simply refuse to 
respond to the committee’s subpoena. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. 
MURPHY). 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, as a member of the 
committee charged with investigating 
the attack on our Capitol, our Con-
stitution, and our country, I support 
this resolution to refer Peter Navarro 
and Daniel Scavino to the Department 
of Justice for contempt of Congress. 
I will focus my remarks on Mr. 
Navarro. 
There is clear evidence that Mr. 
Navarro was involved in efforts to keep 
President Trump in power after he lost 
the election. 
We subpoenaed Mr. Navarro seeking 
testimony and documents regarding 
the actions he took to discredit the 
election and prevent the results from 
being certified. Mr. Navarro made a 
blanket claim of executive privilege. 
This claim lacks merit as a matter of 
law and common sense. 
No 
President, 
either 
sitting 
or 
former, has claimed privilege regarding 
Mr. Navarro’s testimony or documents. 
And Mr. Navarro has no authority to 
assert privilege himself. 
Beyond that fundamental flaw, since 
the election, Mr. Navarro has written 
and spoken widely about the subjects 
that are the focus of our subpoena. He 
is eager to tell his story, if he can do so 
on his terms in a way that serves his 
interests. 
He published a book where he details 
the actions he took to change the out-
come of the election. He writes that he 
worked with Steve Bannon on a scheme 
called the ‘‘Green Bay Sweep.’’ Its pur-
pose was to encourage Vice President 
Pence to delay certification of the 
votes and send the election back to 
State legislatures. 
Mr. Navarro writes that he called At-
torney General Barr, urging the De-
partment of Justice to support Presi-
dent Trump’s efforts to challenge the 
election in court, which Barr declined 
to do. 
Mr. Navarro notes that he kept a 
journal detailing this episode and other 
actions he took. 
And finally, while he was refusing to 
comply 
with 
our 
subpoena, 
Mr. 
Navarro made numerous media appear-
ances discussing his role in the events 
culminating on January 6. 
Mr. Navarro has significant relevant 
knowledge. He is happy to share it on 
television and in podcasts, but he won’t 
provide this information in response to 
a lawful subpoena. 
Mr. Navarro is in contempt of Con-
gress and should be referred for pros-
ecution. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS.)

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4376 
April 6, 2022 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, 15 months have passed 
since January 6 of 2021, yet I have seen 
little evidence over that time to indi-
cate the necessary progress has been 
made to ensure the Capitol complex is 
more secure. 
And I have seen no evidence that the 
politicized select committee is serious 
about identifying or addressing the 
issues that led to our Capitol being so 
unprepared on that day, which should 
be its top priority. 
On February 17 of this year, the GAO 
released a report detailing the lack of 
security preparedness by Capitol Police 
leadership 
and 
the 
Capitol 
Police 
Board on and in the lead-up to January 
6. The rank-and-file men and women 
who serve Congress as members of the 
Capitol Police put their lives on the 
line every day. Yet, the Capitol Police 
Board, controlled by Speaker PELOSI, 
failed them. They deserve better. 
Instead of working to ensure our Cap-
itol Police officers have the tools and 
the training they need to prevent an-
other event like January 6 or taking 
long-overdue steps to reform the Cap-
itol Police Board, the House is once 
again voting on a contempt resolution 
because two individuals are not com-
plying with another sham subpoena 
issued by House Democrats. 
I have a newsflash for members of the 
Select Committee: You do not have 
limitless power. You cannot demand 
testimony, documents, or even view 
the information of your political oppo-
nents without their consent or without 
the law on your side. You have neither. 
Specifically, Mr. Scavino and Mr. 
Navarro are unable to testify on spe-
cific topics that are related to their 
work in the White House, nor can they 
testify on communications between 
President Trump and the President’s 
closest advisers, as those communica-
tions are protected under President 
Trump’s claim of executive privilege. 
As a reminder, the American tax-
payer is spending millions of dollars on 
this select committee. According to 
The Washington Post, the select com-
mittee is on pace to spend $9.3 million 
by the end of December. 
To put that into perspective, that 
amount exceeds the current budgets for 
the Committees on the Judiciary; Agri-
culture; Budget; Ethics; the Committee 
on 
House 
Administration; 
Rules; 
Science, Space, and Technology; Small 
Business; Natural Resources; Homeland 
Security; Veterans’ Affairs; and the 
Permanent Select Committee on Intel-
ligence. 
That is right, this select committee 
is using more taxpayer resources on 
their 
partisan 
investigation 
than 
Democrats have devoted to serving vet-
erans, addressing rising prices in infla-
tion, or helping our farmers during a 
massive supply chain crisis. 
This is nothing more than a sham in-
vestigation full of misuses of congres-
sional authority, including Speaker 
PELOSI violating 230 years of precedent 
by refusing to allow the minority party 
to select its own committee members, 
failing to investigate pursuant to a 
valid legislative purpose, altering evi-
dence to fit a certain narrative, lying 
to witnesses, falsely accusing wit-
nesses, violating deponents’ right to 
challenge 
subpoenas, 
and 
perhaps 
above all, refusing to investigate why 
Speaker PELOSI and the Capitol Police 
Board left the Capitol so unprotected 
that day. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the 
resolution. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
Virginia (Mrs. LURIA), a veteran of the 
United States Navy. 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I have 
come to the floor many times over the 
last 3 years and discussed the oath of 
office. The oath to protect and defend 
our Constitution against all enemies 
foreign and domestic. 
Every Member of this body swore 
that oath, and it is the same oath that 
our President and military officers, in-
cluding those like Mr. BANKS, swear in 
service to our Nation. 
That is service. 
When an American enlists or com-
missions in our Armed Forces, or when 
someone takes elected office, or even a 
senior position in the executive branch, 
they do so to serve the American peo-
ple. 
Mr. Scavino and Mr. Navarro had the 
duty to serve the American people. Un-
fortunately, they instead chose to 
serve the interests of one man, who 
sought to advance his own agenda at 
the peril of American democracy. 
They now have the duty to respond 
to the subpoenas of this committee, 
but they have apparently decided that 
they are above the law. 
The American people deserve the 
truth about the attack that attempted 
to prevent the peaceful transition of 
power, and the committee is united in 
our duty to investigate. 
This committee has conducted over 
800 voluntary depositions and inter-
views, with more scheduled, including 
witnesses who worked in the previous 
administration and even close family 
members of the former President. 
The committee has received nearly 
90,000 documents pertaining to January 
6, and we followed up over 435 tips re-
ceived through the committee’s tip 
line. 
Hundreds of witnesses have volun-
tarily come forward and cooperated 
with 
our 
investigation, 
but 
Mr. 
Scavino and Mr. Navarro have refused 
to do their part. 
They have been given every oppor-
tunity to come forward, yet they have 
attempted to obstruct the pursuit of 
justice and to stonewall the commit-
tee’s work and conceal the truth, de-
spite 
both 
publicly 
acknowledging 
their roles in promoting election fraud 
conspiracies and counseling the former 
President on changing the outcome of 
the election. 
Mr. MEADOWS, and today Mr. Scavino 
and Mr. Navarro, my question remains: 
What are you covering up, and who are 
you covering for? 
Their failure to answer that question 
about January 6 is disregarding the 
law, and they should be held account-
able. That is why I will vote, and I will 
urge my colleagues to vote to hold Mr. 
Navarro and Mr. Scavino in contempt 
of Congress. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I think it is again very important as 
our colleagues are contemplating their 
vote on this resolution that they keep 
in mind the facts. And we are hearing 
a number of things that are not con-
sistent with the facts. 
First of all, with respect to the estab-
lishment of the committee, Mr. DAVIS 
knows, and my colleagues know that 
we initially attempted to have a bipar-
tisan commission, which, in fact, Lead-
er MCCARTHY instructed Mr. KATKO to 
negotiate with Chairman THOMPSON. 
Mr. KATKO did that, secured everything 
the Republicans asked for, at which 
point, Mr. MCCARTHY
walked away 
from the bipartisan commission, and 
then went over to the Senate side and 
lobbied against the establishment of a 
bipartisan commission. 
The establishment of the select com-
mittee, again, is not what we would 
have hoped. The 35 Republicans who 
voted for the bipartisan commission 
wanted a bipartisan outside commis-
sion, but we cannot let this attack go 
uninvestigated. 
Mr. DAVIS also knows that with re-
spect to the membership of the com-
mittee, Speaker PELOSI said that she 
would not name two Members who had 
been identified by Mr. MCCARTHY; that 
is completely consistent with the reso-
lution. And Mr. MCCARTHY then him-
self withdrew the other three and de-
termined that he would not partici-
pate. 
Finally, Madam Speaker, I continue 
to hear this allegation that the com-
mittee is not investigating what hap-
pened at the Capitol, not investigating 
what happened with respect to the Cap-
itol Police, not investigating what hap-
pened with respect to security that 
day. That is just not true. The com-
mittee has an entire team that is very 
focused on and investigating what hap-
pened with respect to security at the 
Capitol. 
And it is also the case, though, 
Madam Speaker, we must all remember 
that the former President provoked a 
violent assault on this body, and the 
extent to which there were security 
lapses, the extent to which people did 
not anticipate that there would be a 
violent assault on the Capitol, pro-
voked by the former President, is not 
the fault of the Capitol Police. That is 
the responsibility of the former Presi-
dent. 
And I would also note, Madam Speak-
er, that Mr. DAVIS voted ‘‘yes’’ on the 
bipartisan commission when it came 
up.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4377 
April 6, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
RASKIN), my good friend and colleague. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I want 
to underscore first the point that was 
just made by Ms. CHENEY. The distin-
guished ranking member of the House 
Administration Committee was ap-
pointed to this committee, or the ap-
pointment was accepted by Speaker 
PELOSI, but it was withdrawn by the 
minority leader. It was not rejected by 
the majority; it was rejected by the mi-
nority. 
Madam Speaker, we are here in the 
broadest sense to defend American 
democratic institutions and the rule of 
law. And our colleague said before that 
if this investigation were valid, then 
we would be talking to officials from 
the Sergeant at Arms Office and the 
National Guard. 
Well, I have got good news for my 
friends. First, every court that has 
looked at their claim that this is an in-
valid investigation either because of 
its composition or because it was in-
trinsically flawed in its pursuit of the 
facts about January 6, has rejected 
those arguments. Every court that 
looked at it has rejected the precise ar-
guments our colleagues are floating on 
the floor today. 
But I will go even further than that. 
We have, in fact, interviewed precisely 
the people that they set up as a test for 
the validity of our investigation from 
the Sergeant at Arms and the National 
Guard. And as patriotic public officials 
living out their oaths of office and not 
bowing down to the humiliating cult of 
Donald Trump, they didn’t need a sub-
poena from this committee; they came 
voluntarily. They not only understood 
their legal duty to testify, a duty our 
colleagues, like my friend, the gen-
tleman from Ohio, clearly understands 
when they wield the gavel, but they 
have come forward and said that it is a 
patriotic honor for them. It is not just 
a legal duty, it is a patriotic honor for 
them to render truthful testimony on 
this horrific attack against America, 
which interrupted the counting of elec-
toral college votes for the first time in 
American history. 
b 1745 
This is mandated in the 12th Amend-
ment to the Constitution, which says 
that the House and the Senate must 
meet in joint session in order to count 
electoral college votes the first week of 
January, on the Wednesday following a 
Presidential election. 
What is remarkable to me is that the 
caucus that is now so drenched in the 
Trump-Putin propaganda is not just 
trying to denounce the Democrats for 
searching the truth right now. Today, 
they have begun the utterly cannibal-
istic process of vilifying and casti-
gating Republicans just because they 
disagree 
with 
the 
orthodoxy, 
the 
dogma handed down by Donald Trump. 
Ms. CHENEY is the former chair of the 
House Republican Conference, and it is 
left to Democrats to defend her against 
the vilification and the castigating 
that we hear. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. CHENEY. I yield the gentleman 
an additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. RASKIN. It is up to us to defend 
Mr. KINZINGER and to defend Ms. CHE-
NEY, because if you don’t go along with 
what Donald Trump says, if you don’t 
act like you are a robot, or a member 
of a religious cult, they will attack 
you, they will vilify you, they will de-
nounce you. 
These people, Mr. KINZINGER and Ms. 
CHENEY, are constitutional heroes, and 
they don’t deserve your contempt. The 
insurrectionists and the lawbreakers 
deserve your contempt because they 
are acting in contempt of the rule of 
law and the Constitution of the United 
States. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. JACKSON). 
Mr. JACKSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Indiana for 
the time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
speak about two great patriots who I 
am proud to call my friends, Dan 
Scavino and Peter Navarro. These two 
men have served our country honor-
ably. Sadly, they are now targets of 
the political witch hunt simply because 
they served our country and they are 
loyal to our great former President, 
Donald J. Trump. 
The illegitimate January 6th Com-
mittee’s 
ruthless 
crusade 
against 
President Trump and his close allies is 
yet another smear on this great body. 
It will go down in history as another 
failed attempt by my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle to bring down 
good people simply because they dis-
agree with their political beliefs. 
As someone who has been a target of 
the left and their ruthless tactics in 
the past, I know firsthand how dam-
aging this can be. The American people 
are tired of this partisan January 6 cir-
cus. It is time to stop this nonsense 
now. 
I urge my colleagues to stand up 
against this charade and oppose this 
baseless resolution. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN). 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
The majority leader, just a few min-
utes ago said—used the term ‘‘danger 
to our democracy.’’ Danger to our de-
mocracy. 
Think about this. Democrats have 
closed the Capitol, allowed proxy vot-
ing, kicked Republicans off commit-
tees, won’t let Republicans serve on 
this select committee—the first time 
in the history of the Congress the mi-
nority leader was not allowed to put on 
a select committee the individuals he 
or she selected; first time in the his-
tory of our Nation. 
The Democrats are trying to end the 
electoral college; trying to end the fili-
buster; trying to pack the Court. 
This committee, the January 6th 
Committee, altered evidence and pre-
sented it to the American people as if 
it were true. And they accuse us of 
being a danger to our democracy? 
Mr. GAETZ was right. We have got a 
border that is complete chaos. We have 
$6 gas in California, $4 gas everywhere 
else in the country. We have crime at 
record levels in every major urban area 
in this Nation. And we have an infla-
tion problem that is at a 40-year high. 
And this committee has more con-
tempt resolutions for a purely political 
reason. I think the whole committee is 
pure political, designed to do one 
thing; keep President Trump off the 
ballot in 2024. 
The gentlewoman from Wyoming, in 
her opening comments, used the term, 
‘‘false message.’’ False message. She 
used to say big lie. Now I guess it is 
false message. When she said it, I start-
ed jotting things down. 
Think about all the false messages 
we have got from them in the last few 
years. They told us the protests in the 
summer of 2020 were peaceful. We got a 
billion dollars’ worth of damage around 
our cities that says it wasn’t. 
They told us the dossier was real. 
They told us it was Republicans, Re-
publicans who wanted to defund the po-
lice. That one is almost laughable, if it 
wasn’t so serious for our law enforce-
ment and for the families who live in 
those areas where mayors and city 
councils did defund the police. 
They told us the FBI didn’t spy on 
the Trump campaign. We know that 
wasn’t true. We have got inspectors 
general reports that tell us all kinds of 
things of what they did in front of the 
FISA Court. 
They said Trump colluded with Rus-
sia. We have got a Mueller report, 19 
lawyers, 40 FBI agents, 30 million hard- 
earned American tax dollars in that re-
port that said that false message was 
just that, false. 
They told us COVID didn’t start in 
the lab; sure looks like it did. 
They told us the lab wasn’t doing 
gain-of-function research; sure looks 
like it was. 
They told us the vaccinated can’t get 
it. We know that is wrong. Every day 
there is a new announcement: Member 
of Congress is getting it; fully vac-
cinated, boosted, and everything else. 
They told us those who are vac-
cinated can’t transmit it. They told us 
that was wrong. 
And you talk about the biggest false 
message, the biggest false message that 
has just been confirmed in the last 
week, how false it was? The Hunter 
Biden 
laptop 
was 
Russian 
disinformation. 
The 
Hunter 
Biden 
laptop was Russian disinformation.

is asked about his son’s business deal-
ings with foreign companies. He says: 
‘‘Nothing was unethical.’’ He said: My 
son has not made money with business 
interests—with companies with an in-
terest in China. 
And we all know there are 4.8 million 
reasons why that statement was not 
accurate. And how do we know? Wash-
ington Post told us. Not me, not Presi-
dent Trump, not Republicans, The 
Washington Post told us last week, two 
stories last week, a week ago today, 
one at 11 a.m., one at 11:04 a.m.; two 
eight-page articles, 4 minutes apart, 
confirming what we knew, but what big 
media, big tech, Democrats colluded to 
keep from the American people just 
days before, just days before the most 
important election we have, the Presi-
dential election, who is going to be our 
next Commander in Chief. 
The laptop was real. The eyewitness 
was real. The emails were real. The 
only thing fake was that collusion 
from those individuals, those entities 
to keep important information from 
we, the people, in the run-up to the 
most important election we have. 
And oh, by the way, they were joined 
by 51 former intel officials, joined in 
the collusion. 
You know what is also interesting? It 
is funny how that story has changed. 
Eighteen months ago, it started off, it 
wasn’t his laptop. It quickly switched 
to well, it was his laptop, but it was 
Russian disinformation. 
And now it is, well, it wasn’t Russian 
disinformation, but Joe Biden had 
nothing to do with it. Now it was, well, 
Joe knew what was going on, but he 
wasn’t really involved in anything 
wrong. Ron Klain told us that, the 
Chief of Staff told us that Sunday. 
We need to be focusing on the issues 
that the American people want us to 
focus on. You want to talk about dan-
ger to our democracy and the biggest 
false message. I would say what hap-
pened—one of the biggest dangers to 
our democracy and one of the biggest 
false messages is what happened 18 
months ago, where that story was kept 
from the American people. We could 
dig into that, find out what went on 
there, why that happened. 
And we could also focus on the record 
crime, record inflation, record price of 
gas, and the chaos on our southern bor-
der that is about to get worse. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. PA-
NETTA). The time of the gentleman has 
expired. 
Mr. BANKS. I yield the gentleman an 
additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. JORDAN. It is about to get worse 
as the Democrats look to—as the Biden 
administration looks to repeal title 42. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no further speakers, 
and I am prepared to close. I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. I am prepared to 
close. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close. I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, it might feel really 
good today for my opponents on the 
other side of the aisle. It might feel 
really good in a vindictive sort of way, 
to vote to put their political opponents 
behind bars. That might feel really 
good for my opponents across the aisle. 
But I guarantee you, the history will 
not look back kindly on those actions 
in the years to come. I guarantee it. It 
couldn’t be anymore un-American what 
they want to do today, to vote to put 
two men behind bars purely because 
they disagree with their politics and 
the man that they worked for. 
I can’t think of a bigger reason for 
my opponents to vote ‘‘no’’ on such an 
un-American resolution. I urge all of 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ and do the 
same. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, it does not feel really 
good today. It feels sad, and it feels 
tragic that so many in my own party 
are refusing to address the constitu-
tional crisis and the challenge that we 
face. 
The ranking member of the Judiciary 
Committee went to law school. I am 
not sure if he passed the bar. But he 
knows that we all have an obligation 
to abide by the rulings of the courts. 
So, yes, it was a false story. Yes, it 
was a big lie. In fact, former Vice 
President Pence has said that what 
President Trump wanted him to do was 
‘‘un-American.’’ It was also unconsti-
tutional, and it was illegal. 
Mr. Speaker, what gives me tremen-
dous hope though is although so many 
in my party in this body have put loy-
alty to Donald Trump ahead of their 
oath to the Constitution, the com-
mittee has interviewed scores of Re-
publicans from around the country 
who, in fact, have shown the kind of 
tremendous bravery and dedication to 
public service that every American can 
be proud of: Republicans who were ap-
pointed by President Trump to posts in 
the Department of Justice; Repub-
licans who stood firm; Republicans who 
threatened to resign and who refused 
to participate in President Trump’s ef-
forts to corrupt the Department of Jus-
tice with the stolen election lies—yes, 
lies—that led to January 6. 
We have heard from Republicans 
serving in State legislatures, in State 
and local governments who also stood 
firm. 
Mr. Speaker, it is crucially impor-
tant that this body hold these gentle-
men in contempt. It is crucially impor-
tant that they have to abide by their 
subpoena. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, let me say for the 
record, if there is any Member on the 
other side who feels the strength to 
come and testify before our committee, 
I invite them, right now, to let us know 
and we will gladly entertain whatever 
information they have as to what hap-
pened on January 6. Some of them ran 
out of this building fearing for their 
lives, so there is no question that 
something happened. 
And H. Res. 503 says, absolutely, we 
have 
to 
find 
the 
facts 
and 
cir-
cumstances as to what happened and 
why and make recommendations; and 
that is what we have to do. 
We have the constitutional power to 
issue subpoenas. If people do not follow 
subpoenas, we have the right to bring 
them before this body and recommend 
contempt citations; and that is what 
we are doing today. 
So it doesn’t matter if they were a 
father, a mother, a sister, or a brother, 
had children; if they break the law, 
they break the law. No one is above the 
law, and that is the point we are trying 
to make. 
We asked the individuals, subpoenaed 
them to come before the committee, 
and they chose not to come and, there-
fore, they broke the law, and that is 
why we are here today. 
So, Mr. Speaker, as I have men-
tioned, when I testified before the 
Rules Committee, it is absurd that 
there should be any disagreement at all 
about why we are here for this con-
tempt resolution. 
If you listen to the arguments from 
some of my friends on the other side, 
they have very little to say of sub-
stance of this matter. We hear excuses. 
We hear attacks about process. We 
hear scare-mongering about the select 
committee. 
Let me remind my colleagues, we 
have conducted over 830 interviews and 
depositions. And again, I invite any of 
them to come talk to us if they want 
to. Now, if, for some reason, they are 
reluctant or afraid, then I feel sorry for 
them. 
Our constitutional democracy was 
challenged on January 6. We have to 
fix this. Over 200 years, we have oper-
ated in complete freedom, and all of a 
sudden, this institution was attacked; 
and we have to fix that. 
b 1800 
We are the number one democracy in 
the world, but we lead by example. 
Democrats are leading by example. The 
select committee is leading by example 
by bringing these two gentlemen who 
broke the law, who decided that it is 
better to deal with the law of Donald 
Trump rather than the Constitution of 
the United States of America. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, 
especially my friend from Wyoming 
(Ms. CHENEY). 
Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to 
support adoption of this resolution, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of a simple, but sacred principle: No 
one is above the law. 
Peter Navarro was one of the former presi-
dent’s closest allies. And, by his own admis-
sion, played a direct role in planning and co-
ordinating the events of January 6. He speaks

April 6, 2022 
to that role on television, on podcasts, and 
even in his own book—yet he refuses to do so 
before Congress, even when compelled by a 
lawful subpoena. That is unjustifiable, and in 
light of the subpoena, a criminal form of con-
tempt. 
Dan Scavino was similarly close to the 
former president—and similarly involved in the 
events leading up to and on January 6. Mr. 
Scavino played an intimate role in crafting 
former President Trump’s social media strat-
egy and served as his Deputy Chief of Staff 
for Communications. And, like Mr. Navarro, he 
was called before our committee because our 
evidence and public reporting, suggests he 
possesses direct, personal knowledge of the 
events leading up to January 6, and while the 
Capitol was under siege. 
Unfortunately, both Mr. Navarro and Mr. 
Scavino have chosen at every turn to obstruct, 
to conceal their knowledge, forgoing their legal 
duty to comply with a congressional subpoena 
and attempting instead to hide behind spu-
rious claims of privilege. 
But let me be clear: There is no privilege 
that allows a witness to simply refuse to ap-
pear. President Biden has declined to assert 
any privilege and properly concluded that the 
national interests in hearing the testimony of 
Navarro and Scavino clearly outweigh any 
other consideration. And there is certainly no 
privilege that allows a witness to refuse to ap-
pear before Congress while sitting for press 
interviews or discussing the matter in a book. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor 
of this resolution. To do otherwise would set a 
dangerous precedent: That Congress is not a 
body that is capable of, or willing to, carry out 
meaningful oversight. That our subpoenas can 
be shrugged off or ignored. And that the 
American people can no longer have faith in 
our ability to investigate potential abuses of 
power by any president—past, present, or fu-
ture. 
As Judge Carter said last week in his ruling, 
‘If the country does not commit to investigating 
and pursuing accountability for those respon-
sible, the Court fears January 6 will repeat 
itself.’ He is right. We must commit to the pur-
suit of accountability and justice. Not as 
Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans 
who love and cherish our democracy. 
And I will take just one more moment to 
urge the Department of Justice to act with all 
due haste when they receive the criminal con-
tempt referrals for Mr. Scavino and Mr. 
Navarro. And not just with respect to these re-
ferrals, but on any evidence of criminality con-
nected to efforts to overturn the election. The 
rule of law must apply equally to all Ameri-
cans, including former presidents. To do other-
wise, risks another repetition of January 6th— 
or worse. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to the rule, the previous 
question is ordered on the resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on adoption of the resolu-

The question was taken; and the

Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15- 
minute vote on adoption of the resolu-
tion will be followed by 5-minute votes 
on: 
Ordering the previous question on 
House Resolution 1033; 
Adoption of House Resolution 1033, if 
ordered; and 
The motion to suspend the rules and 
pass H.R. 7276.

SAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC.

The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Pursuant to the International Emer-
gency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies 
Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 
301 of title 3, United States Code, I 
hereby report that I have issued an Ex-
ecutive Order in order to take addi-
tional steps with respect to the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 14024 of April 15, 2021, with re-
spect to the unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security, foreign 
policy, and economy of the United 
States posed by specified harmful for-
eign activities of the Government of 
the Russian Federation. 
The order prohibits the following: (i) 
new investment in the Russian Federa-
tion by a United States person, wher-
ever located; (ii) the exportation, re-
exportation, sale, or supply, directly or 
indirectly, from the United States, or 
by a United States person, wherever lo-
cated, of any category of services as 
may be determined by the Secretary of 
the Treasury, in consultation with the 
Secretary of State, to any person lo-
cated in the Russian Federation; and 
(iii) any approval, financing, facilita-
tion, or guarantee by a United States 
person, wherever located, of a trans-
action by a foreign person where the 
transaction by that foreign person 
would be prohibited by this section if 
performed by a United States person or 
within the United States. 
I am enclosing a copy of the Execu-
tive Order I have issued.

CONGRATULATING WEST CAREER 
AND TECHNICAL ACADEMY’S WE 
THE PEOPLE TEAM 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate West Career 
and Technical Academy’s We the Peo-
ple team. They are not only studying 
history; they are making it. 
Mr. Speaker, 1999 was the last time a 
southern Nevada We the People team 
qualified for nationals. But now, 14 stu-
dents from West Tech’s We the People 
team have changed that. 
As part of We the People, these stu-
dents are going that extra mile in their 
civic education to study our history, 
our Constitution, and our democracy. 
To Mrs. Rozar and all the out-
standing We the People teachers, we 
say thank you. 
I have no doubt of West Tech’s suc-
cess later this month when they com-
pete here in Washington, but I am even 
more excited to watch where this pas-
sion takes them as leaders in Nevada’s

HONORING ARMY VETERAN LYNN 
LIPPS 
(Mr. ROSENDALE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Army veteran, 
Mr. Lynn Lipps, from Roundup, Mon-
tana, for being awarded the Army Good 
Conduct Medal. 
The Army Good Conduct Medal is 
awarded for exemplary behavior, effi-
ciency, and fidelity in active Federal 
military service. 
Mr. Lipps demonstrated exceptional 
skills and was a reliable and conscien-
tious worker during his service as a 
medic in the emergency treatment 
clinic at Irwin Army Hospital at Fort 
Riley. 
In addition to his skills, Mr. Lipps 
displayed a genuine concern for the 
well-being of the patients that he tend-
ed to. 
Mr. 
Lipps 
worked 
long, 
arduous 
hours to ensure that the best possible 
medical care was provided to the sol-
diers and their families, and he was al-
ways willing to serve above and beyond 
that which was required. 
Mr. Lipps’ accomplishments not only 
reflected well upon himself but also 
upon his unit. 
Congratulations, Lynn, on receiving 
this noble achievement, and thank you 
for your service to our country.

Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is 
with great pride I rise today to recog-
nize Steve Kramer from Dyer, Indiana, 
as the 2020 recipient of the United 
Steelworkers’ Leo Gerard Visionary

a councilman for the town of Dyer in 
the First District. 
Steve’s hard work and dedication to 
our steelworkers’ labor unions and his 
community is what makes his work 
truly visionary and commendable. 
I am proud that northwest Indiana is 
home to so many hardworking and 
dedicated members of the United Steel-
workers. Every day, I appreciate their 
invaluable 
contributions 
to 
the 
strength of our economy, our work-
force, and our community. 
Congratulations, Steve, for your ex-
emplary leadership of the steelworkers 
and all workers.

NATIONAL 
LIBRARY 
WEEK 
AND 
NATIONAL LIBRARY OUTREACH 
DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate National Library Week and Na-
tional Library Outreach Day. This 
week is dedicated to promoting the im-
portance of our local libraries. 
Our libraries serve as a place to con-
nect. Some use the library as a place to 
connect to the internet. Others may 
use it as a place to connect with new 
ideas or classes. Most importantly, our 
libraries connect our communities. 
Today’s focus, National Library Out-
reach Day, otherwise known as Na-
tional Bookmobile Day, highlights the 
important 
outreach 
activities 
con-
ducted by our local libraries. 
Bookmobiles 
and 
other 
outreach 
events hosted by our libraries connect 
individuals who otherwise might not be 
able to access a local library. From 
events at elementary schools to senior 
living centers, these services are essen-
tial to our community. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage you all 
to make a visit to your local library 
this week and thank the librarians for 
the work that they do.

HONORING THE LIFE OF TREY 
MARSHALL SUTTON 
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
stand here today to honor the life of 
Henrico County Police Officer Trey 
Marshall Sutton. 
Officer Sutton was described as kind, 
confident, and someone who devoted 
his life to others. 
Originally from Chesterfield County, 
Officer Sutton graduated from the po-
lice academy earlier this year, and he 
was training to serve in the Henrico 
County PD’s patrol bureau. He was also 
soon to be married. 
Last week, Officer Sutton’s life was 
cut tragically short in a car crash dur-
ing field training. In an instant, Vir-
ginia lost one of our best, someone who 
demonstrated both bravery and com-
passion through his actions. 
We will remember Officer Sutton for 
his service to our community. We will 
remember his commitment to our 
Commonwealth. And we will remember 
his story as one of purpose and inspira-
tion for our country. 
In the words of the ‘‘Hero’s Wel-
come’’: ‘‘And through your selfless ac-
tions, others will hear the call.’’ 
My prayers are with Officer Sutton’s 
fellow officers in the Henrico County 
Police Department, his classmates at 
the academy, his fiance, Zoe, and all of 
his loved ones. 
Please join me in honoring the life of 
Officer Trey Marshall Sutton. 
f 
FOOD SHORTAGE 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, the Presi-
dent of the United States of America, 
the most prosperous country in the 
world, has warned the American people 
that a food shortage is a real possi-
bility in our near future. 
Much like our national energy short-
age, this potential crisis has been made 
much more likely by President Biden’s 
out-of-control spending and his unwill-
ingness to tap into American re-
sources, ingenuity, and its people. 
Since January of 2021, the prices of 
many of the key inputs used to produce 
our Nation’s food supply have substan-
tially increased. Ammonia is up 203 
percent; liquid nitrogen is up 162 per-
cent; and farm diesel, used in almost 
every piece of farm equipment, is up a 
whopping 95 percent. 
Spending more money won’t fix this; 
in fact, it has made it worse by causing 
the prices of everything to go up. 
If a food shortage does come to the 
United States, the sole person to blame 
will be President Biden, who has wast-
ed no time spending our country into a 
crisis.

UKRAINIAN STORIES 
(Ms. SPEIER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to-
night to condemn Vladimir Putin for 
what he is doing to the children of 
Ukraine. 
Listen to these stories. 
Ukrainian mothers are putting the 
contact details of their relatives on the 
bodies of their children because they 
want to make sure that if the children 
survive and they don’t, there will be 
some place for their children to go. 
Emergency 
service 
workers 
are 
teaching children how to identify Rus-
sian explosives made to look like toys. 
Thousands of children have been ab-
ducted in Ukraine and taken to Russia. 
And Ukrainian children have wit-
nessed the murder and torture of their 
parents, 
including 
severed 
limbs, 
slashed throats, rapes, and burning 
bodies. 
I am proud to colead an appropria-
tions 
request 
with 
Representatives 
SCHIFF, KAPTUR, and QUIGLEY to ensure 
at least $100 million for Eastern Eu-
rope’s demining budget in FY23. 
f 
RECOGNIZING PETIT JEAN MEATS 
(Mr. HILL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the remarkable achieve-
ment of Petit Jean Meats, marking 100 
years of business in central Arkansas. 
Petit Jean Meats was established in 
1922 by the late Felix Schlosser, search-
ing for a better opportunity after es-
caping an inflation-ravaged Germany. 
He 
found 
that 
opportunity 
in 
Morrilton, Arkansas, and opened a 
small retail market, which has now ex-
panded into a 48,000-square foot proc-
essing plant. 
The story of Petit Jean Meats is 
truly inspirational, and today, it is 
still owned by that same family. 
Current owner David Ruff says: ‘‘We 
still do things the old-fashioned way, 
which gives our meats that old-fash-
ioned flavor.’’ 
I commend Petit Jean Meats for this 
outstanding achievement, and I wish 
them continued success. 
f 
UKRAINIAN CHILDREN 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to-
night 
outraged 
over 
the 
systemic 
slaughter of Ukrainian children by 
Russian murderer Vladimir Putin. 
Countless 
Ukrainian 
children 
are 
being murdered and orphaned. An en-
tire generation is watching as every-
thing around them is destroyed by Rus-
sia’s war machine. 
Fathers and mothers are being ripped 
from sons and daughters. The littlest 
are being left to fend for themselves, as 
Russia 
lays 
waste 
to 
everything 
Ukrainians have ever known. 
No little child should be left to weep 
next to the unmarked grave of their 
parent that they will never see again. 
No child should have to ponder how 
they will eat or where they will sleep 
due to the actions of a tyrant who de-
rives satisfaction from their despair. 
We have a global responsibility to 
end this bloodshed. Fully arm Ukraine 
now. Isolate Russia from the commu-
nity of responsible nations. Starve 
Putin and his oligarchs. Make sure 
that we help Ukraine withstand all 
that they must in order to win this war 
against Russia’s killing machine. Let 
all democratic nations do everything 
they can to assure liberty in Ukraine is 
victorious.

DISASTER AT THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to educate my colleagues and the pub-
lic one more time as to what sort of 
disaster we are soon to have on the 
southern border. 
Recently, we have had frequently 
90,000 to 100,000 people cross the border 
every month. People of whom we know 
little. People are skipping to the head 
of the line over people who want to 
come here legally, people that come 
from countries that are hostile to us. 
But as bad as it is to have 80,000 to 
100,000 people come across, the Biden 
administration is claiming that within 
the next month and a half they will re-
move title 42, opening up the border to 
perhaps another 200,000 or 300,000 or 
400,000 people a month above what we 
are already getting here. 
I personally think they are doing this 
because the Ukraine war is going on, 
and they think they can really land a 
death blow to the future of this coun-
try by opening up the border to people 
all over the world. 
I call upon American citizens and my 
colleagues to not forget about what is 
going on at the border. I call upon the 
press to treat this story with the grav-
ity it should be given and to report on 
all the people who are going to come 
here in the second half of May. 
We cannot have 400,000 people a 
month coming across the border. 
f 
UKRAINE CHILDREN 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, while pre-
paring remarks, I considered showing 
much more graphic photos of Ukrain-
ian children brutalized at the hands of 
Vladimir Putin. But then I thought of 
some of the people who might see 
this—refugees of war, war veterans who 
would be reminded of their own pain 
and suffering. 
The truth is, for survivors who actu-
ally see the end to war, the trauma 
never recedes, it never leaves. The cost 
of war is simply too high. 
I come to the floor tonight not as a 
Congresswoman, but as a mother and a 
grandmother. My heart breaks at these 
sights of horror of children lost or 
scarred forever. 
Last night, my son sent me a photo 
of a child who is nearly the same age as 
his daughter, my granddaughter. On 
her back, her mother had written her 
name, her contact information, her 
birth date in case the mother was 
killed, or the daughter was left alone. 
I cannot imagine that planning—the 
fear, the despair, the trauma. 
No matter the war, we must think of 
the children in Syria, Afghanistan, 
Ethiopia, Cameroon, anywhere on our 
planet. 
I pray for peace for anyone suffering 
at the hands of a brutal dictator. 
We must do everything we can to find 
a peaceful resolution. 
‘‘Slava Ukrani,’’ ‘‘Glory to Ukraine.’’ 
‘‘Slava heroem,’’ ‘‘Glory to the he-
roes.’’ 
f 
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
will start with associating myself with 
my colleagues who have just spoken 
and say, ‘‘Glory to Ukraine’’ and to in-
dicate that my heart is broken. The 
words will not elevate the despicable 
actions of Vladimir Putin. 
Today we voted to secure and seek, I 
hope, an indictment. He is a war crimi-
nal, and he is killing children. 
But I must, Mr. Speaker, suggest 
that we have a difficult problem at the 
border exacerbated by Governor Greg 
Abbott, who wishes to make a mockery 
of the desperate people coming, includ-
ing Ukrainian refugees, who gather at 
the southern border. Today, he has an-
nounced that he will bus these mi-
grants to Washington, D.C. 
I am embarrassed. 
With the likes of George H.W. Bush, 
Ann Richards, Henry B. Gonzalez, as 
well as Barbara Jordan, who are broth-
ers and sisters of Texas, I now have to 
live with Governor Greg Abbott who 
disgraces us by suggesting that we 
must take migrants and drop them off 
on the steps of the Capitol. 
I welcome them. 
Why don’t we sit down and resolve 
how we deal with these desperate peo-
ple? Why don’t we find a way, as we 
were trying to do with George W. Bush, 
to have an immigration policy? But 
when he does that, he will also do that 
to Ukrainian refugees at the southern 
border. 
Enough is enough.

CRISES THE WHITE HOUSE IS 
CAUSING AT HOME AND ABROAD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MRVAN). 
Under 
the 
Speaker’s 
an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. JOHN-
SON) is recognized for 60 minutes as the 
designee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, during the last election, the 
Democratic Party managed to win a 
razor-thin majority here in this House 
and a split Senate, 50–50. No objective 
person can look at those numbers and 
suggest that the President of this 
party, President Biden, was given any 
kind of authority whatsoever to try to 
radically transform our country, but, 
you know, that is exactly what he has 
tried to do for the worse. 
And the latest offense, the latest 
overstep, the latest overreach is this 
President has made the most leftwing 
nomination to the Supreme Court in 
American history. 
For those who didn’t see this over the 
weekend, Judge Ketanji Brown Jack-
son testified in her post-confirmation 
hearing 
written 
questions 
for 
the 
record: ‘‘I do not hold a position on 
whether individuals possess natural 
rights.’’ 
You heard that correctly. President 
Biden’s nominee for the highest court 
in this land cannot say whether indi-
viduals possess natural rights. We can 
hardly imagine a more un-American 
position than denying the first self-evi-
dent truth of America. 
The central and foundational premise 
of our great country is that all individ-
uals are endowed by their creator with 
certain 
inalienable 
rights. 
Among 
those are the right to life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness. 
We have a newsflash for the judge: 
Those rights don’t come from govern-
ment; they don’t come from any 
human authority. They come from our 
creator himself. We are endowed with 
those rights by God. 
The fact that Judge Jackson cannot 
or will not acknowledge this simple 
fact is disqualifying for the highest 
court in this land, period, full stop. 
Mr. Speaker, the President’s nomina-
tion is truly out of step with the coun-
try and this fateful moment. 
And 
the 
primary 
job 
Americans 
elected President Biden to do was to 
help unite this country. This is doing 
the opposite. 
His nomination for the Supreme 
Court is the latest example of just how 
badly he has failed. 
I am very thankful to my colleagues 
for joining me on the floor this evening 
to discuss President Biden’s radical 
nominee to the United States Supreme 
Court, but also, as you will hear, the 
myriad number of other crises the 
White House is creating at home and 
abroad. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Illinois (Mrs. MILLER). 
b 1930 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, title 42 is the only thing keeping 
President Biden from fully handing our 
border to cartels and smugglers al-
ready taking full advantage of his in-
competence and neglect. 
Last week, the Biden administration 
announced that they will be stopping 
Border Patrol from enforcing COVID–19 
restrictions on illegal immigrants by 
ending title 42. 
Title 42 must stay in place. It is a 
matter of national security, and my 
colleagues and I are calling on Demo-
crats to act in a bipartisan effort to

April 6, 2022 
force a vote on the bill to keep it in 
place. 
Biden’s open border policies are an 
unmitigated disaster. The crisis at our 
southern border is out of control and 
our Customs and Border Patrol is al-
ready dangerously overwhelmed. 
Ending title 42 expulsions will signal 
to cartels and migrants that our border 
is now wide open, inciting more vio-
lence and lawlessness. 
It is also being reported that the 
Biden administration is going to divert 
resources from our veterans in order to 
give free medical care to illegal mi-
grants. 
I wrote a letter to the secretary of 
Veterans Affairs to oppose these efforts 
because we must put our heroes first 
and stand up for our veterans. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
drawing attention to that. The gentle-
woman is exactly right, and some of 
the Border Patrol officials have said 
that they estimate that by rescinding 
title 42, that the number of illegal bor-
der crossings will double overnight. So 
instead of having 7,000 a day, we will go 
to 18, 20,000 a day. The numbers are 
just staggering. 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 
next to the gentleman from Tennessee 
(Mr. BURCHETT). 
Mr. 
BURCHETT. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding to 
the great State of Tennessee. 
Mr. Speaker, a recent CNBC survey 
illustrates how Americans are feeling 
about inflation. Fifty-two percent of 
adults reported they are under more fi-
nancial stress today than they were 1 
year ago. 
The poll also shows how consumers 
spending habits changed over the last 6 
months in response to rising prices: 
Fifty-three percent say they are cut-
ting back on dining out; 39 percent are 
driving less; 32 percent switched from a 
brand-name product; and 29 percent 
canceled a vacation. 
The economy is in a tailspin, Mr. 
Speaker, thanks to President Biden’s 
Big Government agenda. His failed 
policies are making the cost of doing 
business more expensive, and those in-
creased costs are passed directly on to 
consumers. 
Many companies use catchy slogans 
and taglines to advertise their services 
but, in this economy, some businesses 
might rethink their marketing cam-
paigns. 
Remember the $5 foot-long at Sub-
way? It costs at least $10 for a foot- 
long sandwich from Subway these days, 
Mr. Speaker. 
Southwest Airlines’ low-cost flight 
motto is ‘‘Wanna Get Away?’’ Flights 
are 
now 
so 
expensive; 
Southwest 
should change its offers to Wanna Go 
One Way? Did you catch that? One 
way, since that is all travelers obvi-
ously can afford. 
Walmart tells customers they will 
‘‘Save Money, Live Better’’ by shop-
ping at its stores. Americans are prob-
ably thinking more along the line of 
Spend Money, Live Worse after making 
a trip to Walmart in recent weeks. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, lots of folks 
are doing their banking with Capital 
One, which asks ‘‘What’s in Your Wal-
let?’’ Pretty soon Capital One will be 
asking consumers What’s Left in Your 
Wallet?’’ Thanks to rising prices. 
Mr. Speaker, Americans are really 
just fed up with President Biden’s han-
dling of the economy. From the same 
CNBC poll I referenced earlier, 61 per-
cent disapprove of the President’s re-
sponse to inflation, and 81 percent fear 
a recession is coming in 2022. And I 
would dare say, CNBC is not the most 
conservative folks out there. 
Earlier this week, thank goodness, 
Elon Musk, he swooped into Twitter to 
save the company from the woke poli-
tics that are running it into the 
ground, censorship being one of those. 
President Biden needs a similar hero 
who can come in and stop this adminis-
tration from destroying the economy. 
Alternatively, he could simply give up 
on his Big Government agenda that is 
failing American citizens, Mr. Speaker. 
I appreciate Vice Chairman JOHN-
SON’s lackluster leadership and his con-
stant 
mention 
of 
complimentary 
snacks which are not here, coming 
forthwith. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend; we always 
need a little moment of brevity, don’t 
we? The news is so bad, but the gen-
tleman pointed out and highlighted 
how difficult the times are, and that is 
a serious subject. 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 
next to the gentleman from Michigan 
(Mr. BERGMAN), who holds the distinc-
tion of being the highest-ranking mili-
tary officer ever elected to the United 
States Congress, my classmate, presi-
dent of our freshman class. I still call 
him the general. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my esteemed colleague from Louisiana, 
who I rely on. If you are going to be 
worth anything as a military com-
mander, you rely on the folks who 
work for you. And I can tell you, I 
spent a lot of time with lawyers, and 
the gentleman is the best when it 
comes to constitutional law. So I am 
proud to be here with him today to 
talk about kind of a certain level of, 
you could say, lawlessness. 
President Biden’s favorite policy, 
public policy shop, also known as the 
CDC, announced that it would lift title 
42, which has been used nearly 2 mil-
lion times since March of 2020, to re-
move illegal immigrants. 
When title 42 is lifted this May, even 
more 
illegal 
immigrants 
will 
be 
incentivized to cross our southern bor-
der. This will spark an unprecedented 
surge, considering that we have al-
ready experienced record-high illegal 
border crossings under President Biden 
in his first year plus. 
As border violations rise, so does the 
number of violent criminals allowed 
into our communities. I regret these 
circumstances forced upon our Nation 
by President Biden’s careless policies. 
Because of this, we must be prepared 
for more illegal immigrant crime. 
For this reason, I will be introducing 
legislation next week called the Vic-
tims of Immigration Crime Engage-
ment Restoration Act, or the VOICE 
Restoration Act. 
VOICE was an office set up by Presi-
dent Trump to connect victims of ille-
gal immigrant crimes; connect them to 
their legal representatives, to any wit-
nesses, with supportive resources like a 
hotline to answer questions, local con-
tacts, Social Services referrals, and in-
formation about the custody status of 
detained illegal immigrants. 
In 2021, President Biden dismantled 
VOICE—I repeat, dismantled VOICE. 
Think, for a second, what that says 
about him and his policies, and what he 
thinks about innocent American citi-
zens. 
My legislation will permanently rein-
state the VOICE office, and I look for-
ward to sharing more of the details 
soon. 
We have an out-of-control crisis on 
our southern border; predictable and 
avoidable, but it is so massive that it is 
impacting cities and towns all across 
our country. 
The Democrat leadership in Congress 
and in the White House have done 
nothing about this. This must change 
soon. And I know it is going to change 
here in probably about another 8 
months, because we are going to have 
some new leadership. 
And my promise to you, as a marine 
who doesn’t know the word ‘‘quit,’’ is 
that, in the meantime, every day be-
tween now and then, I won’t stop fight-
ing, along with others, to secure our 
borders. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
that fight and that very worthwhile 
legislation, and we look forward to see-
ing that. 
The gentleman is right. The surge in 
crime is directly related to border in so 
many ways because we know dangerous 
people have come across that border. It 
is completely open to MS–13 gang 
members, violent criminals, convicted 
persons, criminals who come from 
other countries. You have child preda-
tors, even terrorists who have come 
across that border. We know this for a 
fact, and still they won’t change the 
policies. 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 
next to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LAMALFA.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, Presi-
dent Biden recently announced his fis-
cal year 2023 budget, the proposal in-
cludes a plan to spend $73 trillion in a 
10-year period that will add $15 trillion 
to our national debt; this at a time 
when government spending is already 
driving inflation and making all these 
items that much more expensive: Air-
line fares, lodging, gas, the cost of 
automobiles, new or used. 
I stopped in at a dealer the other day 
and they are finding that people are ac-
tually willing to pay more for a used

car than what the car cost new, or 
trucks. It is crazy. 
So the American people are suffering 
right now under these economic condi-
tions, all man-caused, all government- 
caused, pretty much. 
So with record-breaking inflation 
and gas prices, we are, instead, having 
a budget that is crafted to not combat 
these issues, but add to them. It 
radicalizes our energy in the new Green 
Deal that these guys want to do, mak-
ing more cost, making energy even less 
available to Americans. 
It includes zero mention of resuming 
the Keystone Pipeline, since that was 
something on the first day of office 
they decided to put a stop to. 
The budget should be focused on get-
ting people back to work, to making 
America thrive, combating inflation, 
not causing it; strengthening our en-
ergy independence, which will bring 
prices down, not playing around with 
the strategic reserve and, you know, 
bleeding out a million barrels per day. 
That strategic reserve has a purpose, 
and it isn’t playing economics with it; 
it is supposed to be there for, indeed, a 
time of crisis for our country. 
So, instead of relying on Russian oil 
and relying on other imported oil from 
Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, whoever, we 
can do our own national oil independ-
ence with our own known reserves. 
So, the direction the Biden adminis-
tration is taking with all this spend-
ing, it is starting to mimic my home 
State of California really, because our 
regulatory and tax policies there are 
already the model for what not to do. 
The Federal Government shouldn’t fol-
low that. 
So let’s come back to common sense. 
I urge President Biden and the Demo-
crats to not adopt this giant spending 
plan but move in a direction of getting 
people back into production again. 
Come out of this COVID crisis, put 
them back to work, have our economy 
thrive, with our energy independence, 
food independence, because California’s 
ag situation is being decimated by the 
water being taken away. 
I asked the President to help us on 
this. Help us grow food in this country 
and get prices back down and not have 
empty shelves. That should be focus of 
how you help American people, not 
more crazy spending. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman. So 
much of that is just common sense, and 
I appreciate him pointing it out. 
But sadly, unfortunately, this White 
House shows no intention whatsoever 
of reversing its policies and positions, 
which could fix these problems. 
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to yield 
next to the gentleman from the great 
State of Texas (Mr. BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
appreciate my good friend from my 
neighbor, Louisiana, Mr. JOHNSON, for 
having this Special Order. 
No, it doesn’t look like things are 
going to change, as the gentleman said. 
Joe Biden has no interest in securing 
the southern border. He has proven it 
time and time again over the last 14 
months. 
On day one of his Presidency, our 
Commander in Chief stopped com-
pletely the construction of our border 
wall, which is, by the way, something 
that Congress appropriated funds for 
and is something that we know for a 
fact deters illegal crossings. 
In fact, the Department of Homeland 
Security reported that illegal entries 
in areas with the new border wall sys-
tem along the Yuma sector plummeted 
more than 87 percent in fiscal year 
2020, compared with the previous year 
of 2019. 
President Biden’s foolish decision to 
stop construction of this wall left mil-
lions of taxpayer dollars’ worth of steel 
just rusting away in the hot sun and 
the cold, wet winters; millions of your 
tax dollars simply gone to waste. 
He ended remain in Mexico, a policy 
that The Washington Post reported 
made illegal apprehensions fall by 30 
percent in its very first year alone. 
He has tied the hands of ICE who, 
last year, deported the lowest number 
of illegal aliens since 1995, despite more 
than 2 million alien apprehensions. In-
terior enforcement is drying up to 
nothing. 
And now he is scrapping title 42, the 
very last policy that saves CBP from 
drowning in a complete sea of chaos. 
But if all of this isn’t enough to con-
vince you that Joe Biden doesn’t have 
your best interests in mind, take a 
look at his budget request for 2023. He 
wants $73 trillion—that is with a T—in 
spending, $58 trillion—another T—more 
in taxes. And our debt will increase by 
$16 trillion—with a T—over the next 
decade. 
I did a quick search for the phrase 
‘‘border security’’ in this budget. It is 
mentioned twice. We are facing the 
worst border crisis on record and a his-
toric number of fentanyl overdoses 
from drugs illegally smuggled into our 
country, over 100,000 dead Americans 
from drug overdoses, and yet, the 
President mentioned border security 
only twice. 
Do you know how often he mentions 
the word ‘‘climate’’? 187 times. 
Joe Biden claims that he is working 
to protect America but, folks, the facts 
actually say otherwise. The facts show 
that he doesn’t care about keeping you 
and your family safe. The facts show he 
doesn’t care about protecting the live-
lihood that you worked so hard for. 
And the facts show that he doesn’t care 
about the sovereignty or the security 
of our great Nation that we love, a bea-
con of liberty and freedom for all the 
world to look at and envy. 
That is why they are coming here. 
Shame on President Biden. 
b 1945 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, John Adams said facts are 
stubborn things, and those are some 
tough facts. They cannot refute it be-
cause everyone can see for themselves. 
By the way, Dr. Babin, I just pulled 
up the U.S. debt clock, this thing that 
everybody 
can 
see 
on 
their 
smartphone. Currently, right now, as 
we stand here, the national debt is 
$30,367,412,900. You can’t count it or fol-
low it with the naked eye. Unbeliev-
able. And he is proposing more. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I really ap-
preciate your leadership and willing-
ness to highlight the issues facing our 
country, including the very serious 
issue of the possible confirmation of an 
unqualified 
person, 
Judge 
Ketanji 
Brown Jackson, to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
President 
Biden’s 
Supreme 
Court 
nominee, Judge Ketanji Brown Jack-
son, commonly known as KBJ, is sim-
ply unfit to serve our Nation’s highest 
court. 
Throughout her legal career, Judge 
Jackson has garnered a disconcerting 
record of being soft on crime, as evi-
denced by her lenient sentencing, par-
ticularly for criminals convicted of 
egregious acts involving child sex tor-
ture. Judge Jackson simply is incapa-
ble of holding dangerous criminals ac-
countable. 
Additionally, Judge KBJ has revealed 
her allegiance to the radical left by re-
fusing to define what a woman is, ex-
cusing her extremism by claiming she 
isn’t a biologist. There are indisputable 
differences between men and women, 
and those differences must be both ac-
knowledged and accepted in order for 
KBJ to properly adjudicate title IX 
cases. 
Judge Jackson also recently declined 
to recognize Americans’ natural rights, 
the precious rights granted to us by 
God. Failing to accept the basic prin-
ciple 
that 
individuals 
possess 
unalienable rights, a principle that is 
the very foundation of our American 
values, is supremely disqualifying for 
any individual seeking to serve our Na-
tion’s highest court. 
Yet, despite Judge Jackson’s fright-
ening record and recent disqualifying 
revelations, the Senate intends to vote 
to potentially confirm her to the Su-
preme Court this week. 
While it is true that Judge Jackson’s 
confirmation 
will 
not 
immediately 
alter the makeup of the Court, it is 
naive and cowardly to make excuses 
when the stakes are this high. Our 
country, our liberties, and the makeup 
of the Supreme Court are on the line. 
If Judge Jackson becomes a Supreme 
Court Justice, she will serve for dec-
ades, solidifying and strengthening the 
left’s menacing grip of our rule of law. 
Her decisions will impact future Amer-
icans for generations to come, setting 
precedent that will ultimately guide 
our great Nation once many of us in 
these Chambers are long gone. 
This is exactly why Judge Jackson’s 
confirmation is much larger than just 
one vote. It is about preserving justice, 
protecting our freedoms, and defending 
our Constitution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4387 
April 6, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I urge every solitary 
Senator to contemplate their vote and 
the significant weight that it carries 
for our future. I encourage them to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this confirmation. 
Without question, Americans from 
Maine to Utah to Alaska, from sea to 
shining sea, are watching intently, 
praying their Senators’ votes will rep-
resent 
our 
Nation’s 
constitutional 
principles rather than appeasement to 
the left. 
America is watching. Will our Sen-
ators defend America by voting ‘‘no,’’ 
or will they shrink back? We will not 
forget. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend for high-
lighting that. It is a serious issue. 
The longest-lasting legacy of any 
President is who they put on those 
Federal courts, and, of course, the 
most important is the highest court in 
the land. We cannot overstate how im-
portant this is. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE), my good 
friend. 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding and for hosting 
this Special Order tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, President Biden’s budg-
et is symbolic of his wasteful build 
back broke agenda that was filled with 
partisan provisions. 
There is $73 trillion in new spending, 
$58 trillion in taxes, and $16 trillion in 
new debt, all over the next 10 years. 
When hardworking Tennesseans get 
together and come up with a household 
budget, they have difficult conversa-
tions with one another about what ex-
actly they can afford. If something 
falls under the category of unnecessary 
and unaffordable, the last thing they 
do is put it on their grandchildren’s 
credit cards. That is exactly what this 
budget does. 
President Biden and congressional 
Democrats praising his proposal are 
now on record seeming to have no issue 
with mortgaging our country and its 
children’s futures, even amidst the 
largest increase in inflation since 1982. 
There are many wasteful provisions 
in President Biden’s budget proposal, 
like the $11 billion being sent to for-
eign developing countries to help adapt 
to global warming. The one that I 
struggle with the most is the one that 
gives $400 million to Planned Parent-
hood and other entities that perform 
abortions. 
The Hyde amendment has existed in 
every Federal appropriations bill since 
1976. It is one of the most longstanding 
and bipartisan agreements to protect 
Federal taxpayer dollars from going to-
ward abortion. 
President Biden’s decision to pur-
posefully keep this out of his budget 
proposal is wrong and will never get 
my support nor the support of my con-
stituents in middle Tennessee who are 
firmly pro-life. 
Leaving out the Hyde amendment is 
only another partisan attempt to ad-
vertise the President’s anti-life posi-
tion and satisfy those who support the 
horrible atrocities of abortion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members of 
the Congress to stand firm in their 
commitment to protecting life. We 
must restore the Hyde amendment and 
reject President Biden’s budget be-
cause no Tennessean’s tax dollars, nor 
dollars borrowed from our children and 
grandchildren, should go toward sub-
sidizing Planned Parenthood and the 
immoral practice of abortion. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, that was so well said. I appre-
ciate the gentleman highlighting that 
issue. It is one of so many that we have 
deep concerns about with this adminis-
tration and their budget and every-
thing they do. 
We have to protect the sanctity of 
every single human life. To defend the 
defenseless is the job that we have—the 
first job, the primary job. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, our 
country is obviously in bad shape, and 
I think our forefathers, if they saw the 
way we operated today, would be quite 
stunned and wonder where in their 
Constitution they let us down to wind 
up where we are today. 
I think of the three branches of gov-
ernment. The judiciary is the one 
which right now has let down the 
Framers the most. Our forefathers re-
alized that a country with elections 
usually eventually fails because the 
majority can either want, or be manip-
ulated into wanting, more stuff, or or-
dering other people around to order 
them to be obeyed the way they would 
like other people to be behaved. 
The Bill of Rights is almost exclu-
sively about restricting the role of gov-
ernment in American life. Obviously, 
the Supreme Court has largely aban-
doned that function. Things got bad in 
the 1930s and 1940s, and again in the 
1960s. Today, one wonders what the 
Court will ever say no to. 
Where will Judge Jackson fit as we 
try to defend our Constitution? We 
look at her inability to say what a 
woman is and her inability to talk 
about judicial philosophy, and we know 
where she will stand. She stands with 
woke America. I hate that word, but 
that is what it is. It is somebody who 
has no respect for tradition. If you 
have no respect for tradition or com-
mon sense, you certainly don’t have 
that near reverence, which should be a 
requirement for any Supreme Court 
Justice. 
Furthermore, President Biden got 
himself in a position in which he said 
he is going to have to promote a Black 
woman to that position. The very idea 
that you think decisions on a court 
should vary with the background of the 
person who is on that court shows you 
don’t have that respect for the Con-
stitution. 
All 
Americans 
should 
have 
an 
originalist view of the Constitution 
and consider it the great, almost God- 
given, document that it is. 
In any event, when you don’t have 
that respect for the Constitution, you 
know you are not going to respect the 
Second Amendment. You are not going 
to respect the 10th Amendment; it is a 
disaster we have ignored it. You are 
going to continue to stretch the Com-
merce Clause all out of whack. You are 
going to look at every individual as a 
member of a group, never as an indi-
vidual in their own right. 
Right now, about 2 percent of the 
lawyers in the country are Black 
women. So, what Joe Biden did is he 
took 98 percent of the possible resumes 
for this very important job and threw 
them in the garbage. 
I wonder if President Biden does that 
anywhere else in his life? Does he 
throw away 98 percent of the resumes 
or potential resumes when he is look-
ing for a new dentist, a new plumber, a 
new clergyman, throw out 98 percent 
willy-nilly? That is what he has done 
in picking a new Supreme Court Jus-
tice who could well be on the Court for 
the next 40 years. 
Our forefathers felt that by giving us 
this Constitution—they pointed out 
that this Constitution is fit for moral 
and religious people and not fit for 
anyone else. Will Judge Jackson re-
spect that? I don’t know. 
When they finished the Constitution, 
Benjamin Franklin said: We are giving 
you a republic, if you can keep it. 
We are, right now, being tested 
whether we are the moral and religious 
people that can keep the republic that 
the forefathers felt they described in 
the Constitution. 
It looks to me, from everything you 
hear about her, that Judge Jackson is 
not going to have that reverence to 
keep that Constitution, to keep that 
republic. 
We 
will, 
therefore, 
with 
judges like that, wind up collapsing. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, there is a lot of wisdom there. 
The gentleman is exactly right. If a 
judge begins with the premise that we 
have no natural rights, that does not 
bode well for where that logic leads. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, many 
times, we have heard President Biden 
and his administration say that the 
crisis we are facing at our southern 
border is seasonal. There is nothing 
seasonal about 1 million illegal aliens 
crossing our southern border in 6 
months. There is nothing seasonal 
about 400,000 illegal alien got-aways 
going undetected into our country. 
The crisis at our southern border is 
the direct result of President Biden 
overturning successful policies put in 
place by Donald Trump. 
First, Biden halted the construction 
of the border wall. Then, he rescinded 
the remain in Mexico policy. Now, he is 
taking aim at one of the final remain-
ing Trump policies, title 42, which al-
lows law enforcement to expel illegal 
aliens who pose a health risk. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity predicts that as many as 12,000 to

18,000 illegal aliens will cross our 
southern border per day if title 42 is 
lifted—18,000 illegal aliens in 1 day. In 
3 days, that would be greater than the 
population of Pennsylvania’s capital 
city, Harrisburg—in less than 3 days. In 
a little more than a day, it would be 
greater than the population of Wil-
liamsport, Pennsylvania, the largest 
city in Pennsylvania’s 12th Congres-
sional District. 
If President Biden removes title 42, it 
goes beyond bad judgment. It is reck-
less, and it will turn the crisis into 
chaos at our southern border. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Mr. KELLER for that. 
These words are not hyperbole. This is 
what the experts are saying. Customs 
and Border Patrol agents, those offi-
cials who are there every day watching 
this chaos, this calamity that has de-
veloped, they are the ones that are giv-
ing us these numbers. They project 
18,000 illegals a day. It is just hard to 
wrap your mind around that. 
b 2000 
Mr. KELLER. That is the executive 
branch, homeland security. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Abso-
lutely. And these are the results of pol-
icy choices, and they could easily be 
reversed if the White House would 
wake up and do something. 
So I thank the gentleman for bring-
ing that to our attention tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, you have heard Mem-
bers from across the country—north, 
south, east, and west—who have ex-
pressed their outrage and their concern 
with all of the terrible policy choices 
that are leading to absurd results for 
our country. These are very dangerous 
times. There is no leadership in the 
White House. There is no leadership in 
the administration. There is no leader-
ship from the Democratic majority in 
this House or in the split Senate down 
the Hall. We can turn these things 
around, and we can stop these crises if 
we make different decisions, but they 
will not do it. 
Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for my 
colleagues who have shown up tonight 
to articulate this for the American 
people. We can’t say it often enough or 
loudly enough. 
There is going to be a sea change in 
November, and we pray that we can 
hold on and keep this Republic until 
then. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
ENERGY 
INDEPENDENCE, 
NA-
TIONAL 
SECURITY, 
AND 
FOR-
EIGN POLICY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
KELLY) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, today I rise to address some 
of the biggest problems facing the 
United States today and, quite frankly, 
the world. 
As the war between Russia and 
Ukraine wages on, many Americans 
have been quickly reminded of just how 
global our economy really is. 
Now, prior to the war, Russia pro-
vided the United States with 8 percent 
of our Nation’s oil and refined prod-
ucts. A war involving Russia can sud-
denly spike fuel prices at your local 
gas station. Like many nationwide, 
drivers in my home district of western 
Pennsylvania have seen gasoline at 
over $4 a gallon for well over a month. 
The interruption of our Nation’s oil 
supply and subsequent skyrocketing 
prices are just the latest reminder that 
we need to refocus our energy policies 
in Washington and produce more en-
ergy right here at home in America. 
Let’s go back to May 2021, when two 
things happened: the United States im-
ported a record amount of Russian oil, 
and President Biden waived sanctions 
on Nord Stream 2. That is the Russian 
natural gas pipeline set to supply much 
of Europe with energy. 
Now, 4 months earlier the President 
canceled the Keystone XL pipeline be-
tween the United States and Canada. 
That pipeline would have delivered an 
additional 830,000 barrels of crude oil a 
day. That is 830,000 barrels of crude oil 
per day. 
That would have gone to U.S. refin-
eries, and it would have created thou-
sands and thousands of jobs. That is 
more oil than the United States im-
ports from Russia each day. This is a 
no-brainer. Just bring back the pipe-
line. It is so easy to do and so easy to 
institute. 
Why would we not do that? 
Why would we not be energy inde-
pendent? 
We can’t depend on bad foreign ac-
tors such as Russia, Venezuela, or Iran 
to help provide our Nation’s energy. 
Above all I applaud the collective ef-
fort right here in Washington to stop 
bankrolling the Russian war machine 
by buying their products. 
According to the Council on Foreign 
Relations, revenue from the energy 
sector is responsible for more than 40 
percent of Russia’s federal budget. 
Some 
quick, 
back-of-the-envelope 
math, the 8 percent of Russian oil we 
imported equates to 672,000 barrels of 
oil per day. 
But this moment calls for a broader 
push to end our reliance on foreign en-
ergy sources. 
To start, President Biden should re-
verse his executive order banning the 
Keystone pipeline. 
Next, we must return to Trump-era 
energy policies that made the U.S. en-
ergy independent. To amend the former 
President’s 
famous 
tag 
line, 
let’s 
change it to make North America great 
again. 
According to the U.S. Energy Infor-
mation Administration, 61 percent of 
U.S. crude oil imports come from Can-
ada. Another 11 percent comes from 
Mexico. Seventy-two percent comes 
from our neighbors to the north and 
our neighbors to the south. 
We should be expanding oil imports 
from our allies and neighbors rather 
than paying our adversaries who can 
hold our energy sector hostage. Doing 
so not only makes economic sense, but 
it improves relations with those closest 
to us and further strengthens our na-
tional security by becoming less de-
pendent on bullies like Russia, Ven-
ezuela, and Iran. 
Now, on the other hand, President 
Biden has single-handedly made Ameri-
cans poorer and our Nation’s security 
weaker during his first year in office. 
His anti-fossil fuel, Green New Deal 
wish list has placed unnecessary bur-
dens on the oil and gas industry. 
Even as gas prices are reaching 
record highs here nationwide, just last 
month President Biden had announced 
that he is pausing decisions about new 
Federal oil and gas drilling as part of 
his plan to tackle climate change. And 
that is just the beginning. 
So far, President Biden has an-
nounced the release of 80 million bar-
rels of oil from the Nation’s Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve. Just last week 
President Biden announced he will re-
lease up to another 180 million barrels 
of oil over the next 6 months in an ef-
fort to drive down gas prices. That 
doesn’t drive down gas prices. 
That theory really sounds good, but, 
Mr. Speaker, I want you to think about 
where that oil is coming from. The 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve is to be 
used in times of a national emergency 
when we don’t have a supply. It is not 
used to just try and rack up some 
cheap political points by saying: I am 
doing this so you won’t have to pay 
that much at the pump. 
It is not working. It never will work. 
Now, on November 23, the adminis-
tration released 50 million barrels from 
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Ac-
cording to the U.S. Energy Information 
Administration, the average price of 
gas dropped by a whopping 2 cents. In 
following days, by December 6, it 
dropped another 3 cents. So we saved a 
nickel, but we attacked our Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve. 
Now, as of March 25 the reserve sup-
ply was 568 million barrels, meaning 
that President Biden is ready to take 
one-third of our Nation’s reserve and 
use them for his short-term political 
gain that has already proven to not 
lower gas prices for America but has 
weakened the reserve. 
Now, keep in mind, the purpose of 
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is to 
counter severe supply chain disrup-
tions and enhance national security. It 
is not to make your polls look better, 
Mr. President. 
The 80 million barrels the President 
previously released are worth only 
about 4 days of U.S. oil consumption. 
Only the President can decide to with-
draw oil from or refill the reserve. 
What is even more frightening so far is 
China has hardly tapped their oil re-
serves. President Biden’s shortsighted 
decision-making is dangerously harm-
ing our national security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4389 
April 6, 2022 
Now, I am proud to represent the 
great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 
a place once deemed and called the 
Saudi Arabia of natural gas. Pennsyl-
vania produces 21 percent of the nat-
ural 
gas 
extracted 
in 
the 
United 
States. That is second only to Texas, 
according to the Energy Information 
Administration. 
In 2020, the Energy Information Ad-
ministration adds that U.S. dry nat-
ural gas production was about 10 per-
cent greater than U.S. total natural 
gas consumption. That means we can 
export natural gas that we produce cre-
ating energy security for other na-
tions, notably our European allies who 
are currently dependent on Russia for 
their natural gas, and it forges a 
stronger foreign policy in the process. 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the 
spike in fuel costs go hand in hand 
with American foreign policy. If we are 
dependent on bad actors for energy, 
then we are subjecting ourselves to 
their demands. But if we can supply 
the world with affordable energy, then 
we can strengthen our international 
ties and reinforce relationships instead 
of falling behind. Most importantly, we 
give the American people a greater 
sense of security that Russia so des-
perately seeks to have only for itself. 
On the topic of foreign policy, Mr. 
Speaker, I want to quote a great fellow 
Pennsylvanian, 
Benjamin 
Franklin, 
who said: ‘‘By failing to prepare, you 
are preparing to fail.’’ 
Now, I have thought an awful lot 
about our Founding Father’s words as 
we watched current events unfold 
around the world. So much of what we 
are seeing right now mirrors itself in 
history. 
Russia’s 
unprovoked 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine is a stark reminder that bul-
lies like Vladimir Putin will stop at 
nothing to achieve their end game to 
upend democracy and freedom while 
chilling all the opposition in the proc-
ess. 
This type of takeover carries a prece-
dent. Putin’s quest to conquer Ukraine 
should remind all of us of what hap-
pened in the 1930s and 1940s when Ad-
olph Hitler began a similar pursuit 
across Europe. Now, for far too long 
the free world watched from the side-
lines hoping that European forces 
could prevent further escalation only 
to find that Hitler and the Axis Powers 
were relentless. Thankfully, the Allied 
forces defeated the global bullies of 
that era. 
Now, over 80 years later, we can con-
sult history for potential answers to 
modern power struggles. As Russia’s 
military assault on Ukraine continues, 
the United States and NATO allies 
must 
respond 
together. 
After 
all, 
NATO, which is a collection of over 30 
nations, was formed in 1949 after World 
War II to prevent what? 
Soviet aggression. 
NATO has a responsibility to step up. 
Those member countries have a respon-
sibility to step in. All in all, hand in 
hand, the United States—which is also 
the first responder to anything that 
goes wrong in the world—needs to have 
help from other people, not America 
alone, but America with our allies. 
NATO’s purpose remains as impor-
tant today as it was back then. A pow-
erful, unified response has served the 
free world well throughout history. 
Now, much like World War II, we 
have existing or looming conflicts in 
multiple regions or theaters of the 
world including Asia. Today, China is 
threatening Taiwan. Now, as we are de-
flected from watching what is going to 
happen in Taiwan and watching the 
dangerous situation in Taiwan by what 
is going on in Ukraine—and I don’t say 
we should take our eyes off of what is 
going on in Ukraine—we should just 
not think that that is the only theater 
that we have to be concerned with. 
Taiwan is one of our major allies, and 
in recent months multiple reports indi-
cate that China has been quietly con-
ducting combat readiness drills near 
Taiwan, an island territory that China 
still claims to own. This matters for 
two reasons: First, the Chinese are 
watching 
the 
world’s 
response 
to 
Putin’s attempt at a land grab in 
Ukraine because China is threatening 
to take over their own neighbor as 
well. 
Secondly, this could directly impact 
the American consumer. Ninety-two 
percent of the world’s supply of ad-
vanced semiconductor chips—used in 
everything 
from 
automobiles 
to 
cellphones—are made in Taiwan. 
If we have learned nothing from the 
COVID pandemic, it is that we cannot 
depend on other people around the 
world to supply us with those things 
that we need the most. It is a fool’s er-
rand to think that somehow this ends 
well. It does not. It ends terribly for us, 
and it ends terribly for the free world. 
Any large-scale attack on Taiwan 
means these chips would likely become 
very scarce as almost everything else 
in the world is right now, and in some 
cases probably unavailable altogether. 
That is why I am cosponsoring the Fa-
cilitating American-Built Semiconduc-
tors, or the FABS Act, with Congress-
man MIKE MCCAUL. 
This piece of legislation allows for a 
new tax credit through 2032 for invest-
ment in any semiconductor manufac-
turing facility and semiconductor-de-
signed 
expenditures 
right 
here 
at 
home. 
What an unusual concept: to invest 
in American technology with American 
workers to make America safer and 
stronger, not somebody a world away 
from us. Let’s do it right here at home. 
Let’s do it right here at home. 
Now, currently we make just 12 per-
cent of the world’s semiconductor chip 
supply. That is hard for me to imagine 
that we knew at the time how nec-
essary the semiconductor chips were, 
but we had kind of a blind eye and a 
deaf ear to what it was that manufac-
turers were talking about. We said: Do 
you know what? For a couple of pen-
nies we can save, let’s send them over 
to Taiwan and have them make it. And 
we walked away from what is so crit-
ical to us. 
Now, the scary thing is that these are 
just the crises before us right now. His-
tory reflects how a robust American 
foreign policy has significantly shaped 
the world, specifically the Western 
Hemisphere. So when we talk about the 
Western Hemisphere, this is one of the 
things I think that is probably going 
more unnoticed than anything: In the 
1800s President Monroe knew that in 
its infancy the United States was de-
veloping at a very quick rate, and it 
really looked like something that 
other places around the world would 
look at with envy and say: Do you 
know what? They are getting stronger 
every day, and they are getting better 
every day. Maybe we need to get over 
there and colonize. Maybe we need to 
get involved there. 
So the Monroe Doctrine came into ef-
fect, and the whole idea behind that 
was, let’s make sure that people 
around the world cannot make an ef-
fort to come in and get into our West-
ern Hemisphere and cause us great dan-
ger. 
So the Monroe Doctrine came out. 
But then as things went on and we got 
more powerful and we had more and 
more going for us, all of a sudden, the 
world looked to us, and they just didn’t 
take a slight glance at us, but they 
looked at us with covetousness. They 
looked at us with who we were and 
what we were becoming and all the val-
uable things that were right here in 
our hemisphere. 
b 2015 
So Teddy Roosevelt says: You know 
what? I am going to put together the 
Roosevelt Corollary that really estab-
lishes guidelines for any intervention 
in the United States or our Western 
Hemisphere. 
The content within these policies 
largely addressed actions by European 
nations or the inactions of Latin Amer-
ican nations. But I believe they are rel-
evant, once again, and are worth fur-
ther review, and here is why. 
If you were to take a look at the 
Western Hemisphere and just take a 
real broad look at it and say: Okay, 
fine, let’s take a close look. South 
America, Central America, up into the 
triangle, the deepwater ports in Cuba, 
and both ends of the Panama Canal all 
have significant foreign countries—and 
they are mainly China. 
People tell me: You don’t need to 
worry about that Panama Canal; China 
is not really taking it over. I say: You 
know what? If you don’t read history, 
you don’t study history, you are 
doomed to repeat it. 
Why would we not look at what is 
going on right now in our Western 
Hemisphere and say, we have put 
things into place to protect us from 
foreign intervention. 
I want to tell you, you look at the 
Western Hemisphere, South America, 
Central America, the triangle, the

deepwater ports in Cuba, that would be 
ideal for heavy military use, and both 
ends of the Panama Canal. If you don’t 
think that is a threat to American se-
curity, then you need to wake up. We 
are in great danger right now and not 
knowing it. 
First of all, the Chinese are not very 
quiet about what they are trying to do. 
They have a theory that they want to 
take over the world. They don’t whis-
per about it; they don’t sneak around 
about it; they just do what they want 
to do. Their presence in Africa should 
be a great awakening for us. 
We have crippled ourselves with regu-
lations and sanctions on so many 
things that we need, and I don’t know 
for what reason, other than somehow 
we think that we are smarter than ev-
erybody else and we know that we can 
protect ourselves. And the question is: 
Really, how? And the answer is: Well, 
we really can’t. 
I guess our answer will be what it al-
ways is: We will write a strong letter, 
and Jinping will get it. We will tell 
them: Please, stay out of our hemi-
sphere and please stop trying to influ-
ence the rest of the world for evil. And 
we will tell Putin: You need to stop 
doing what you are doing in Ukraine. 
At some point, we will actually read 
history and say we have been down this 
road before, but we failed to take ac-
tion at a time that was absolutely crit-
ical and pushed it on and pushed it out 
of sight, and the price we paid was in-
credible. Let’s not do that again. 
There is an old saying that is: To be 
foretold is to be forewarned. With ev-
erything going on in the world today, 
we hear a lot of people using the term 
‘‘world war III.’’ I am not here tonight 
telling you that that is what is going 
to happen. I am here telling you to-
night that America and the free world 
have to understand that we have seen 
this action before. We know what lies 
ahead of us, and we know the cost of 
not addressing it early. We can do it 
through 
policy, 
but 
peace 
always 
comes through strength, not through 
weakness. 
Diplomacy is one thing, as Teddy 
Roosevelt said: ‘‘Walk softly, but carry 
a big stick.’’ 
I would just suggest to you that if 
you go back to the year 2016—actually 
2017, when our 45th President of the 
United States, Donald Trump, came 
into office, please tell me why for the 4 
years Mr. Trump was in office, the rest 
of the world stayed at bay? The bad ac-
tors of the world didn’t attempt to do 
any of the things that they are doing 
today. 
Certainly, last summer, in our dem-
onstration of how we would leave a 
country high and dry, that we would 
take out our military first and leave 
our military equipment and citizens to 
face what was going on in Afghanistan 
was a warning to the rest of the world 
that you better be careful with the 
United States, because if you are not, 
they will pack up their bags in the 
middle of the night and leave. That is 
not who we are, that is not who we 
have ever been, and that is not who we 
can be in a free world. 
If our friends and allies in the free 
world take a look at what our actions 
have been later—because actions al-
ways speak louder than words—but we 
continue to use words, thinking that 
somehow bad actors will cower and 
walk away from us, that is not the 
America that we know. That is not the 
America that 1.4 million of our men 
and women in uniform have died to 
protect and to send a message to the 
bad actors of the world, we will always 
be here, we will always be on guard, 
and we will never walk away from our 
responsibilities. 
I don’t know what has happened to 
America in a little bit over a year. Peo-
ple always say: I think it is better to 
be respected than feared. I think both 
have a great effect on everybody. I 
want both those to be in effect. 
I will tell you this: When Donald 
Trump was our President, nobody but 
nobody messed with the U.S.A. 
Mr. Speaker, we have so many things 
going on right now. We wonder: What 
is the future? What is the future not 
only for America but for America’s 
friends and allies? We look at energy as 
one of the key issues that we are talk-
ing about today, and we know that in 
America we have endless supplies of 
energy. What is holding us back now 
are our own regulations. 
I heard the administration say: We 
have thousands of permits; why don’t 
you just go ahead and use them? Which 
really shows that they have absolutely 
no idea that having a permit isn’t the 
same as extracting energy. Somehow, I 
guess, if you say it long enough and 
loud enough and to the right crowd, 
they will nod their heads and say: I 
know. You are right. 
You know what? Get out into the 
field and see the people that actually 
do it. Talk to the people that know 
how to extract energy. Talk to the peo-
ple that can go offshore. Talk to the 
people that go deep down into the 
Earth. Talk to all of those people and 
tell them: Don’t worry. You have a per-
mit. Just go ahead and use it. And by 
the way, if you don’t use it, we will 
start taxing you on your nonuse. How 
upside down is this thinking? 
PRO-LIFE INFORMATION 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, the last thing I am going to 
address tonight is probably the most 
important issue of all, because every-
thing we talk about right now, every-
thing we have addressed already, is 
about life. 
There was a tradition here that on 
Wednesdays people would wear red, and 
they would wear red to remind people 
of the girls that had been kidnapped by 
Boko Haram. We wanted those girls 
back, so we would wear red and would 
walk around here and say: We have got 
red on today because we want those 
girls back; Boko Haram has got to re-
turn those girls. 
So I started wearing red on Wednes-
days. Friends on the other side would 
say to me: So you are in concert with 
us; you believe the same things we do? 
I would say: I absolutely do. I abso-
lutely do. They said: You want those 
girls back? I said: Yes, I do. But I don’t 
want just the girls that Boko Haram 
took; I want the girls back that have 
been aborted. I want those girls back 
whose lives were ended. I want you to 
really face the truth of what is going 
on in America today. 
The wordsmithing that takes place 
here in the people’s House, on the floor, 
people 
talk 
about 
abortion 
as 
healthcare, taking the life of a little 
boy or a little girl is healthcare. 
Every night, we see pictures of what 
Russia is doing to Ukraine. Yet, we 
have a deaf ear to the cries of the un-
born, and we don’t look at all to those 
who are being lost every day. Because 
if you don’t see them, I guess they 
don’t count. 
Congress has long required that tax-
payer dollars are not to be used for 
abortions, and President Biden has ac-
tively tried to circumvent this require-
ment. In April of 2021, under President 
Biden’s leadership, the NIH announced 
it would no longer require fetal tissue 
research projects funded by the agency 
to go through an ethics advisory board. 
So the question then becomes: Why 
do we have an ethics advisory board, if 
we are not going to go to them to find 
out what it is that we are talking 
about? 
Then in September of 2021, we began 
hearing the horrific allegations of ille-
gal abortions being performed at the 
University of Pittsburgh for harvesting 
fetal tissue. 
I can tell you, me being on the floor 
tonight will resonate in Pittsburgh 
and, unfortunately, it won’t be by 
those who are pro-life; it will be by 
those that think that somehow this is 
an attack on Pitt and not an attack on 
little unborn boys and girls. 
For all of those who do not like what 
I am saying tonight, please take off 
your blinders and understand what is 
taking place. 
We began hearing all of these hor-
rible allegations of illegal abortions 
being performed at the University of 
Pittsburgh for harvesting fetal tissue. 
These abortions were performed as part 
of Pitt’s participation in an NIH pro-
gram for the university to operate as a 
fetal tissue repository for research hap-
pening around the country. 
The types of abortions Pitt is ac-
cused of performing are horrific. Babies 
that survived the abortion would be 
born alive and then killed. This was to 
preserve—this is really hard to under-
stand—this is to preserve the fetal cells 
longer, a process known as maximizing 
warm ischemia time. 
When you say: Well, what is that? 
When you talk to the scientists, well, 
the idea is the warm tissue is actually 
more valuable for our studies. So a 
baby boy or girl that survives this 
abortion, that is the tissue that is the 
most valuable to us. 
Now, I think if any of us came upon 
some kind of accident or saw somebody

who was in grave danger, we would 
want to save them. Somebody who has 
endured an unbelievable process and 
survived it, we would save them; we 
would not take advantage of that. 
This program was supported by tax-
payer funding through the NIH pro-
gram. So congratulations, Mr. and Mrs. 
Taxpayer, for all the things that you 
hate, you are helping to fund it. 
This isn’t the only abortion project 
that the National Institutes of Health 
is funding, though. The NIH expects to 
spend $88 million on human fetal tissue 
research in this year alone. 
When these allegations began coming 
out—which I thought was a real good 
move by the university—they hired a 
law firm to conduct an independent re-
view of Pitt’s abortion process. Some-
body is questioning the process you do, 
so you say: Here is what I will do. I 
want to participate with you, so I will 
provide the funding to an independent 
research group. That law firm was a 
Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm 
that employs Pitt grads. What a sur-
prise. 
The review determined that Pitt was 
totally in compliance with the law. 
They didn’t say what Pitt was doing 
was right; they said they were in com-
pliance with the law, even though that 
report completely failed to look into 
Planned Parenthood or UPMC, who 
were partners with this NIH program. 
When all of this came out, we sent a 
letter, along with Representative MOR-
GAN GRIFFITH and over 50 of our col-
leagues, asking the NIH for answers on 
how it funds and oversees these abor-
tions programs. It took them months 
to respond to me, which is not unusual 
for any letter you send to any agency 
here in Washington, D.C. 
When they finally did reply to us, 
they simply pointed out to me and to 
the rest of us: Please, look at Pitt’s 
independent review. 
Now, this level of accountability to 
Congress is completely unacceptable, 
and it shouldn’t take months for a gov-
ernment agency to respond to letters 
from any of us here in the House of 
Representatives. 
We 
are 
here 
rep-
resenting the people who voted us in 
office. And when they do respond, they 
should respond with a substantive an-
swer. I don’t need to be horsed around 
and told something and told: Well, you 
just don’t understand. 
Which is absolutely correct. I don’t 
understand. In the United States of 
America, why are we doing things and 
then covering them up and saying, we 
did an independent review. We paid for 
it, and these guys actually came up 
with an answer that we were looking 
for. So they followed the money. 
A few weeks ago, Congress finally 
passed a budget, the first since Presi-
dent Biden has been in office. It was far 
from perfect, but it included strong 
protections for the unborn, protections 
which have been in place since the 
1970s. 
Less than 2 weeks later, President 
Biden released his 2023 budget proposal, 
which included a full wish list of Demo-
crat anti-life priorities. 
Here are some examples from his re-
cent budget: Number 1, it eliminates 
the Hyde amendment, which prohibits 
federal funding for abortions. It be-
came law in 1976. The Hyde amendment 
has saved over 2.4 million lives. 
b 2030 
It also wants to eliminate the Dor-
nan amendment. The Dornan amend-
ment prevents taxpayer dollars from 
being used to pay for abortion in the 
District of Columbia. Without this pro-
tection, D.C. taxpayer dollars could 
pay for an estimated 1,400 to 1,500 abor-
tions every year. Every year. 
It increased Title X family planning 
funding by $113 million. Title X is a 
prime funding source for Planned Par-
enthood, providing it with $56 million 
taxpayer dollars annually. Now, on 
January 21, 2022, the Biden administra-
tion awarded $6.6 million in Title X 
funds from the American Rescue Plan 
to abortion providers. $6.6 million in 
American taxpayer money to provide 
funds for abortion providers. 
Now, I am Catholic, and oftentimes I 
have gone to my priest and I have said, 
‘‘Father, is there some reason you can-
not go into the pulpit and talk about 
the horrendous things that are going 
on in our country today?’’ You know 
what the United States Conference of 
Catholic Bishops said? ‘‘The USCCB re-
mains gravely concerned about the 
continued efforts to expand taxpayer 
funding of abortion, which would occur 
if the Hyde amendment or any other 
lifesaving appropriations riders were to 
be removed from the annual appropria-
tions bill.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. ‘‘We 
take this stand because abortion is not 
healthcare. It is the antithesis of 
healthcare.’’ 
Now, I know I am out of time, but me 
being out of time here on the floor does 
not take this country from being out of 
time to address the most egregious ac-
tions that are taking place. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has again ex-
pired. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Now, I 
just tell you, I am going to use up some 
time, and you can keep hammering me, 
but you know what? In the time we 
have been talking, so far, as of April 
5——

f 
CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Colorado 
(Mrs. 
BOEBERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, this 
past Friday, Biden’s CDC, formally 
known as the Centers for Disease Con-
trol, but often referred to now as the 
center 
for 
Democrat 
control, 
an-
nounced that it would be ending title 
42. 
At a time when liberal mayors across 
our country are extending mask man-
dates on our children in schools, and 
the American public is still being 
forced to mask-up on airplanes, the 
Biden regime has decided that pro-
tecting the American people from dis-
eases, including but not limited to 
COVID, is not a priority if it comes at 
the expense of their amnesty and open 
borders agenda. 
Now, it is no coincidence that the 
Biden regime has decided to drop title 
42, a policy that has been used to pre-
vent 
communicable 
diseases 
from 
spreading into the homeland via illegal 
aliens entering our southern border. 
In fact, more than 2 million illegal 
aliens have been apprehended at our 
southern border since Joe Biden took 
office, and Border Patrol agents esti-
mate another 70 percent of these illegal 
immigrants 
have 
not 
been 
appre-
hended. They call them got-aways. So, 
in fact, that means nearly 3.5 million 
illegal aliens have come across our bor-
der on Biden’s watch. 
Now, Republicans and Democrats 
from both the House and Senate have 
condemned canceling title 42. Some 
have called it dangerous, and others 
have called it frightening. I call it an 
attack on the safety and security of 
the American people. 
It has been reported that by the time 
the mid-terms roll around in November 
of 2022, nearly 7 million illegal aliens 
will have crossed the southern border 
this year. That is larger than the popu-
lations of Denver, San Francisco, At-
lanta, Washington, D.C., Boston, Se-
attle, Miami, Las Vegas, New Orleans, 
Portland, Tampa, and Detroit com-
bined. Can you imagine? 
We have a product here that is work-
ing. We have a policy that is working 
to deter some people away from the 
border, but we are going to take what-
ever sliver we have that is keeping peo-
ple out of our country illegally and do 
away with it. 
Maybe it is to overrun our system, 
maybe it is to create chaos; 8 to 10 
years of backlogs, so then the Amer-
ican people have to accept amnesty. I 
am not sure exactly what the plan is, 
but it certainly is intentional, and that 
is what members of the House Freedom 
Caucus are here to discuss tonight. 
I have with me members from the 
House Freedom Caucus who are going 
to address what has been going on at 
the southern border. We have been to 
the southern border multiple times to 
see firsthand what is happening—the 
invasion that is taking place in our 
country—unlike the border czar, who 
has failed to visit the most dangerous 
parts of our southern border. I think 
she made a trip to El Paso. And then, 
of course, the Commander in Chief, 
who is in command of nothing, he 
hasn’t been there at all.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4392 
April 6, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the former 
chairman of the House Freedom Cau-
cus, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. 
BIGGS), my good friend. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for yielding to me. I 
would like to help set the stage here 
just for a moment. Imagine, if you will, 
100,000 people entering the country ille-
gally and stopped on our border just in 
the first 2 weeks of March of this year. 
But because of title 42, which allows 
the Border Patrol agents to imme-
diately turn people away because of 
communicable diseases, that is the 
term used in title 42, they sent 50,000 of 
them back away. You don’t have to 
imagine it because that is true. That is 
exactly what happened. 
If you extrapolate that out, because 
you can, just looking at it from Janu-
ary, February, March of this year, they 
turned away over a quarter million 
people under title 42. 
Now, when title 42 goes away on May 
23, because that is exactly what this 
administration wants, you will double 
the amount of people who are coming 
in just through the apprehension route. 
We have another record month in 
March. Those numbers are just out. 
That means that you are going to be 
sitting on about 300,000 to 400,000 appre-
hensions that you are going to be re-
leasing right into the United States of 
America. 
What does that do? Everybody in 
here knows this because you have been 
down to the border. I have been down 
to the border with you. The cartels are 
in it to make money. As they see this 
opening up, more and more people get-
ting freedom to the United States 
caught and released, what they will do, 
and what they are already doing, by 
the way, is they will advertise. 
The NGOs that we help fund, that the 
United Nations funds, will advertise. It 
will be chaos, chaos on the border. My 
prediction is somewhere around 400,000 
to 500,000 people a month coming in. 
But it actually could be more. A lot of 
people are talking about the ceiling 
now being 18,000 people a day when that 
goes away. I don’t think it is going to 
be 18,000. I think it will exceed 20,000. If 
it exceeds 20,000, that is 600,000 a month 
coming in. That is bigger than the city 
of Mesa in Arizona, which is Arizona’s 
second largest city. 
You know what that means? In the 
last half of this year, the last half of 
the year alone, you are going to be sit-
ting, as you said, at 41⁄2 to 5 million 
people brought into this country ille-
gally, and that is not counting the get- 
aways. The get-aways last year were at 
least 800,000. 
It is enormous; it is dangerous; it is 
inhumane. I haven’t even touched on 
the inhumanity of it. We are just talk-
ing up here. We are not getting granu-
lar. We are just talking about the over-
running of America, our culture, and 
our sovereignty. We won’t have much 
of a nation after this is done. 
You said it yourself, is this incom-
petence? The answer is no, this is will-
ful. This is willful, and this is what 
they want. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. BIGGS, do you 
believe that the cartels have been 
emboldened during Biden’s first year as 
President of the United States? 
Mr. BIGGS. Absolutely, 100 percent. 
Do you know how we know they have 
been emboldened? Because it used to be 
they would have the coyotes take the 
people up and locate them in the U.S. 
They don’t do that anymore. The 
coyotes take them up, they put them 
on the border and say, ‘‘We don’t have 
to go in with you. Go in. Go in with 
your cell phone.’’ Oh, by the way, 
Biden administration says now they 
are going to give away a cell phone to 
every illegal alien crossing the border. 
But they will just come across. I 
have seen it; you have all seen it. They 
are 
walking 
across, 
they 
are 
FaceTiming their friends back home: 
‘‘Yeah, I made it in.’’ They are dressed 
nice; they are dressed clean. The car-
tels are emboldened not just at the 
southern border any longer. 
This is spilling over into the country, 
and we are seeing violence along the 
border because of it, and you are seeing 
cartel members ship all over. If there 
are drugs being distributed anywhere 
in the United States, you have got car-
tels there. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. What about these il-
legal aliens who are coming through 
with the help of the cartel, what do 
they owe the cartel for getting into the 
United States? 
Mr. BIGGS. The average price right 
now is $4,000 to $7,000, unless you are 
from China, and then it is $35,000. Very 
few of these people have that to pay. 
Guess what happens? Either they can 
work it off by delivering illicit drugs, 
helping to smuggle human beings, in-
cluding sex trafficking, or they come 
in, they get a job, and they are inden-
tured servants. They are effectively 
slaves to the cartel, and they will 
never work it off, because the cartels 
are taskmasters at this. They know ex-
actly how to keep these folks under 
their thumb. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. BIGGS, you also 
chair the Border Security Caucus, and 
you recently brought in Secretary 
Mayorkas. Thank you for bringing him 
here to the Hill so we could ask some 
questions. 
Now, he was talking about title 42 
being a CDC issue, and that is not real-
ly his issue to enforce. That is not his 
policy to enforce. What is a policy that 
he could enforce that would effectively 
secure our border? 
Mr. BIGGS. He could enforce the 
MPP, the migrant protection proto-
cols. That is the remain in Mexico pol-
icy. What he could do is, instead of en-
forcing that at 9 people a day—that is 
the number we heard earlier this week, 
9 people a day—you could actually en-
force it the way it was intended to be 
enforced, and that would be thousands 
a day because we have thousands of 
folks coming in. That would be another 
deterrent. That is just one of the 
things that he could do. 
He could actually go in and encour-
age us to fix the Flores law or the 
TVPRA laws. All of those things would 
be deterrents. But, instead, he has 
opened it wide open. He has taken 
away any deterrent. Instead, he is basi-
cally encouraging people to come into 
this country illegally. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Thank you. Now, 
one final question for you here. You 
are a businessman. We may have 7 mil-
lion undocumented workers in our 
country by November. What does that 
mean for our economy? 
Mr. BIGGS. Well, first of all, the un-
derground economy right now for peo-
ple, my estimate is about 25 to 27 mil-
lion illegal aliens in the country. You 
are going to bring in another 7 million, 
so you are going to have an under-
ground economy. Those people who are 
not skilled laborers are going to have a 
tough time getting jobs. A lot of these 
folks are going to go on social welfare 
programs, even though they are not 
supposed to be allowed to. They will 
get on social welfare programs. 
We are already on the verge of stag-
flation right now, high inflation and a 
shrinking GDP. As that happens, and 
you bring in that many people undocu-
mented, you are going to actually ex-
acerbate both those problems, and we 
may see the likes of something we 
haven’t seen since Jimmy Carter. It 
might even exceed what happened 
under Jimmy Carter, who was probably 
the most unfortunate and incompetent 
President in my lifetime. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. We have more Mem-
bers joining us here from the House 
Freedom Caucus to talk about title 42. 
Thank you so much, Congressman 
BIGGS, for your insight on this. I know 
that you work really hard in studying 
what is going on at the southern bor-
der. 
I have the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) here now. Do 
you believe that this regime is respon-
sible for signaling to poor and des-
perate people that now is the time to 
take this dangerous journey, to break 
our laws, to come into our country, and 
live under the freedoms and protec-
tions our country provides but not as a 
citizen? 
Mr. NORMAN. Well, first of all, 
thank you for organizing this discus-
sion to inform the American people 
what is going on. As Andy has said, 
this President is willfully and directly 
causing this to happen to the American 
people. 
You are a businessperson. You run a 
restaurant. I am in the development 
world. Who would let anybody come 
into your business or to your home, not 
know who they were, not know why 
they were there? 
It is insane what this administration 
is doing. By taking title 42, as has been 
said, it prohibits—that is the only tool 
that President Trump had at his dis-
posal and President Biden has, but he 
is doing away with it because that is 
what he is encouraging. 
Lauren, think about this, how unfair 
is it to that law enforcement agency,

that law enforcement official stopping 
a car not knowing who is in it, not 
knowing what his background is, hav-
ing no information, how safe is that for 
that law enforcement officer? 
b 2045 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, how un-
fair is it to the municipalities and the 
cities that are going to have to pay for 
the hospital care, for the schooling? 
How fair is that? 
Well, it is not. It is intentional. It is 
willful. 
As people ask me all the time, why is 
he doing this? He is burning the house 
down before, I assume, the November 
elections, which the House will turn 
over, and hopefully, we will elect Free-
dom Caucus members who have got the 
steel and the spine to do something 
about it. 
He sold out not only to the citizens; 
he sold out to China and those that he 
is indebted to. We are going to find out 
more and more about that as we move 
forward. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I am so 
happy that the gentlewoman from Col-
orado organized this effort tonight. We 
need to be speaking about it, and of 
course, I would call on our friends from 
this side of the aisle. 
It is interesting that we are standing 
on this side of the aisle. I mean, thank 
goodness somebody is willing to stand 
over here and defend the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I call on my Democrat 
colleagues to start answering some 
questions and start defending their 
country from this invasion. 
But if the gentleman doesn’t know 
this, if you do a quick calculation—this 
isn’t Congressman PERRY, Congress-
woman BOEBERT, Congressman ROY, 
any of us up here. This is DHS. The De-
partment of Homeland Security is 
bracing for 18,000 crossings a day, 18,000 
people coming across the border ille-
gally each day. 
Now, I don’t know, for each one of 
you, the size of your town where you 
come from, but I suspect 18,000 in any 
town would make a pretty big dent un-
less you are talking about one of the 
major cities like Los Angeles or some-
thing like that. 
Even so, 18,000 a day, Mr. Speaker, 
that is over 61⁄2 million people, if we 
keep that rate up, 61⁄2 million people in 
1 year illegally coming to our country. 
Congressman NORMAN
or Congress-
woman BOEBERT, could your business 
sustain something like that? 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, abso-
lutely not. The city of Rifle just hit 
10,000 for our population. I mean, 18,000 
people a day, that right there exceeds 
the little city of Rifle, Colorado. 
But this is something that we abso-
lutely cannot endure, so I am glad that 
we have this time tonight to discuss 
this. 
Representative GOOD, you have been 
to the southern border. You have 
talked to Border Patrol agents. Can 
you tell me what you have seen, what 
you have heard from Border Patrol 
agents? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I 
have been there four times in my first 
year, the first 14 months here in this 
Congress. 
February a year ago was the largest 
February in terms of illegal border 
crossings in the history of the country. 
We had 101,000 cross, some 3,000 a day, 
in February a year ago. 
We exceeded that by 64 percent this 
most recent February. We went from 
101,000 to 165,000. 
Now, it is so bad with what this 
President has allowed to happen in the 
last year that 165,000 in a month 
doesn’t sound like a really bad month 
for this President. 
That is because, again, it was 101,000 
last February, but it increased as the 
year went on to where it was some 
200,000 a month later on into the year, 
as we know, and 2 million in the first 
year this President was in office. 
As others have already pointed out, 
with him rescinding title 42, I guess he 
was afraid that is a policy, a law, that 
might help repel some illegals back 
across the border, might allow us to re-
turn some if we actually would enforce 
the law. 
So, we are rescinding title 42, which, 
as already has been said, will take it 
from 7,000 to 21⁄2 times as large. Mr. 
Speaker, 18,000 a day is the average, 
500,000 in the first 30 days. 
This President is on pace for some 10 
to 15 million illegal entries into our 
country in his first and hopefully only 
term. 
I was in a Budget Committee hearing 
today with Congresswoman BOEBERT. 
We had Secretary Becerra there, the 
HHS Secretary. HHS has been called in 
not to help stop the border crossings 
but to help facilitate those. 
Mr. Speaker, I asked him today, I 
said: Who do you think should be let 
across our border, or who should be 
prevented from going across our bor-
der? Are there any restraints you 
would put upon anyone who wants to 
come across our border, or do you 
think everyone should be able to come 
across illegally? 
He said: Well, we are talking about 
violating the law. You are saying it is 
illegal. Why would we permit anyone 
to violate the law? 
Our President is violating the high-
est law of the land. The Constitution 
that we all and he swore to uphold, Ar-
ticle IV, Section 4 says: ‘‘The United 
States shall guarantee to every State 
in this Union a republican form of gov-
ernment 
and 
shall 
protect 
them 
against invasion.’’ 
As we look to next year, I want to go 
on record and say—some of you were 
on the articles of impeachment with 
me. Congresswoman BOEBERT drafted 
those. How do we declare this the pub-
lic health emergency that it is, the na-
tional security crisis that it is, the 
health crisis that it is, the social serv-
ices crisis that it is, the education cri-
sis that it is, and the unlawful process 
that it is and not hold this President 
responsible when we have the House 
majority, Lord willing, a year from 
now? How can we not impeach this 
President? 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I agree 
that 
that 
absolutely 
needs 
to 
be 
brought up in the next Congress. 
Now, these appointed Secretaries, 
they really have turned our Border Pa-
trol agents into travel agents. They are 
being shipped all throughout our coun-
try, these illegal immigrants, and 
every State is now a border State. 
Congressman GOOD is from Virginia. 
We have Congressman RALPH NORMAN 
here from South Carolina. I am from 
Colorado. But someone who has a front 
seat view here, the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ROY), this has been a really 
hot topic for him, and rightfully so. 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats 
from 
both Houses of Congress have said that 
they don’t support ending title 42, yet 
no legislation or action has been taken 
to reinstate it. What are your thoughts 
on that? 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Colorado 
(Mrs. 
BOEBERT), and I thank all colleagues 
from the House Freedom Caucus for 
joining me here on the floor. 
I thank my friend from Virginia, who 
joined me down in Del Rio, Texas, just 
a month ago, where we saw firsthand 
what is actually happening in real-time 
on the border, something that we know 
and, unfortunately, my colleagues on 
this side of the aisle refuse to acknowl-
edge and refuse to do anything about. 
Now, as you all know, one of our 
Freedom Caucus colleagues from New 
Mexico (Ms. HERRELL) filed, 14 months 
ago, a piece of legislation to require 
that title 42 be enforced at our border. 
For those listening at home, title 42 
is our power as a country to stop com-
municable diseases and people with 
communicable diseases from coming 
across our border. It is an important 
tool that President Trump and his ad-
ministration put in place in the last 
year of his administration to ensure 
that we stop the flow of people across 
the border from inundating and over-
whelming Border Patrol. 
We knew this was coming. Fourteen 
months ago, we knew this was coming. 
A year ago, we came together. I filed a 
discharge petition as part of this team 
to say that we can force a vote on the 
floor of the House. 
Well, the Speaker of the House re-
fuses to bring to a vote a measure to 
enforce title 42. Everybody listening at 
home, the Speaker of the House, who 
has control of the floor, refuses to 
bring forward a vote on title 42 to re-
quire enforcement of the border. We 
are trying to change that. 
We have almost every single Repub-
lican, I think save one, who has filed 
that, 210 signatures. We need 218. 
Where are my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle? Where are those from 
border States? 
Mr. Speaker, we have zero Democrats 
on that title 42 discharge position.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4394 
April 6, 2022 
Now, as the gentlewoman from Colo-
rado (Mrs. BOEBERT) noted, there are at 
least four noteworthy United States 
Senators who are Democrats who said 
we should not end title 42: Mr. TESTER, 
Mr. MANCHIN, Ms. SINEMA, and Mr. 
KELLY. Those four Senators have said 
we should not end title 42. 
Now, I will wrap up and pass it to 
someone else just to say this: How 
many dead migrants is enough? How 
many dead Americans from fentanyl 
poisoning is enough? How much money 
in the pockets of dangerous cartels is 
enough? How many bullets need to fly 
at the border? How many homes need 
to be destroyed? How many cars need 
to be wrecked? 
How many DPS agents need to be 
killed or endangered? How many people 
need to be harmed before this adminis-
tration will do its job? How many 
criminals need to be let off in the 
United 
States 
and 
not 
prosecuted 
under ICE? When are we going to 
change this and actually secure our 
country? 
Those are my questions for Secretary 
Mayorkas. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, we talk 
about this issue regularly in our meet-
ings with the House Freedom Caucus, 
and one question that comes up regu-
larly is, where is KAMALA
HARRIS? 
Where is the border czar in this? Are 
there any plans for her to visit the 
southern border? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, KAMALA 
who? In all seriousness, it is unfortu-
nate that Vice President HARRIS has 
not fulfilled her mission to be the bor-
der czar. It is awful. 
Did you see the news today in regard 
to the free phones that the White 
House Press Secretary talked about 
today, free phones for migrants? 
Think about it. I was down in Pan-
ama almost a year ago and went to the 
Darien Gap. Who did I see? IOM, the 
International Organization for Migra-
tion. Where do they get their money? 
They get a lot of their money from the 
United Nations. Who puts the most 
money into the United Nations? Yes, 
Americans do. 
Back home on the farm, we used to 
refer to this as—my colleague from 
Texas just said how many, how many? 
I would say to you also: How much? 
We used to refer to it as eating your 
seed corn. Americans pay an inter-
national organization to send debit 
cards for these people to take them-
selves up the Panama pipeline all the 
way to the southern border. Then you 
pay for a bus ride to get them to the 
airport. Then you pay for an airline 
ride: Philadelphia, Baltimore, wher-
ever. They are going around the coun-
try. 
Then you pay for the education, the 
free education they are going to get. 
You pay for the healthcare. 
That is what you Americans are pay-
ing for every single day for over 2 mil-
lion people, and it is about to get 
worse. 
To highlight how it is going to get 
worse and how obtuse this side of the 
aisle is, we are sitting in the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary today creating 
another loophole in the Virgin Islands. 
There is another loophole that is being 
created for visa waiver privileges, 
something that we saw in the Mariana 
Islands that was created about a dec-
ade ago under the Obama administra-
tion where they allowed parole for peo-
ple to be able to come in, Chinese na-
tionals. 
There were maybe, like, eight births 
that were being done on those islands 
prior to this change that was quietly 
made in the law. It accelerated to— 
there were, like, 600 births of Chinese 
nationals that happened in the Mar-
iana Islands as a result of this loop-
hole. 
If you want to see the reporting on it, 
The Wall Street Journal did an excel-
lent job. It was one of our intelligence 
agencies in 2017 that really dug into 
this. 
Yes, here is this huge loophole, and 
they want to now create it in the Vir-
gin Islands. That is what we are voting 
on tonight in the Committee on the Ju-
diciary. 
They want to create another loop-
hole, and they are, like, oh, it will only 
be a few people. Do the American peo-
ple believe that? 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
my fellow border Stater being down 
here. You hold those Mounties back up 
there, okay? Keep them at bay. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, every 
State is a border State, including my 
State of Wisconsin. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is not 
just the phones. What about the gas 
cards that are in the latest budget that 
the President had? What about that? 
Just to put some context to this, 
Texas, I think you have about 15 to 20 
million people. South Carolina has 5.3 
million. That is the number that is 
going to be coming into this country in 
the next 4 months if the pace con-
tinues. 
It is a travesty. It is something that 
Americans have to be aware of and 
stop. God help us all if they do exactly 
what was said. To fund all of this, 
America is at the breaking point. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, so if I 
may extend my point a little bit. 
Think about it. Tonight, we are debat-
ing, in the Judiciary Committee, cre-
ating another loophole. It shows how 
unserious they are, how they do not 
have the interests of the American peo-
ple at hand. They want to create an-
other loophole, and this one is in the 
Virgin Islands, not in the South Pa-
cific. 
People are going to be able to be fun-
neled in here by the thousands as a re-
sult of that loophole—just another way 
to bring people into this country to 
compete against hardworking Ameri-
cans who have to not only try to make 
their way up the scale, the economic 
ladder here in America, but now, with 
inflation, they have to fight that, too. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, we are 
wrapping up here. We have 30 seconds. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask the chairman for 
his final thoughts. 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, my final 
thoughts are that there are Democrats 
that are decrying this. We can do some-
thing about it, and they can do some-
thing about it right here in this House. 
They can walk right down there to the 
well and sign this discharge petition. 
We don’t need all of them; we need 
eight of them. 
Bring the bill up. If they don’t be-
lieve we ought to continue to try and 
secure our border with title 42, they 
can vote against it, but let us have a 
vote. 
We are just asking for a vote. Let’s 
see what the vote count is, and then 
the American people will know who 
stands with them and who stands for a 
wide-open border because that is what 
we are going to have. Think about 
that. 
To the gentlewoman from Colorado 
(Mrs. BOEBERT), we certainly appre-
ciate her putting this together for us 
and providing the opportunity to come 
and talk on behalf of our constituents 
that are very concerned about this. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, the 
chairman could lead the way. He could 
lead the way. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I would only 
add that I have seen some reports that 
there are a number of Democrats in the 
Senate joining with Republicans in the 
Senate to try to do something about 
this. I hope that is true. 
But my little warning to that is, I 
keep hearing words about, well, let’s 
keep title 42 in place until we see a 
plan. Look, I don’t want one of these 
plans full of words, okay? I want the

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Ketanji Brown 
Jackson, of the District of Columbia, 
to be an Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court of the United States. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, I explained how Democrats cre-
ated the current norms around judicial 
appointments. 
These days, the Senate takes an as-
sertive role. In particular, most Sen-
ators do not merely check resumes and 
basic legal qualifications but also look 
into judicial philosophy. 
This is a discussion Republicans wel-
comed because judicial philosophy is 
not a routine policy disagreement, like 
debates over spending or tax rates or 
energy. These are the sorts of normal 
policy differences that our system of 
government is built to handle. 
But if judges misunderstand the judi-
cial role, that damages the system 
itself. 
Our genius Founding Fathers set up 
three branches of government. Two of 
them get to make policy. Congress 
writes and passes laws, Presidents sign 
or veto them, and they are both ac-
countable through frequent elections. 
The third branch responsibilities are 
completely and totally different. The 
courts exist not to rewrite laws but to 
apply them as written; to protect every 
American’s right to the consistent, im-
partial rule of law. So the judiciary is 
insulated and independent. 
Republicans want to uphold the sepa-
ration of powers the Framers left us. 
We want judges to honor their limited 
role in our Republic, stick to the text, 
rule impartially, and leave policy-
making to policymakers. And then we 
want those judges to have total free-
dom from political threats and bul-
lying. 
The political left has long held ex-
actly the opposite. They believe the 
Framers got the judicial role wrong. 
They want the Supreme Court to be an-
other forum where progressives can 
pursue policy outcomes and social 
changes. 
When liberals fail to convince 218 
House Members and 60 Senators of a 
position, they want to cross the street 
and try to persuade five lawyers in-
stead. They want judges going beyond 
the text, roaming through policy ques-
tions and moral judgements. 
So this is a huge difference. It has 
consequences for American families on 
issues from crime to border security, to 
religious liberty, and to the health of 
our institutions. 
So the key question for the Senate is 
this: Where does Judge Jackson come 
down? Where does her record land 
along this spectrum?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1990 
April 6, 2022 
Well, before the nominee was an-
nounced, President Biden gave a trou-
bling hint. He said whomever he nomi-
nated to the Court would have to ‘‘have 
an expansive view of the Constitution,’’ 
acknowledge rights that our founding 
documents leave unsaid, and guarantee 
specific outcomes in certain categories 
of cases. The President promised he 
would only nominate a judicial activist 
for the job. 
So I could only support Judge Jack-
son if her record and testimony sug-
gested President Biden actually made a 
mistake; that he had accidentally cho-
sen a nominee who was not the kind of 
liberal activist that he promised. 
But, unfortunately, Judge Jackson’s 
record and testimony suggests she is 
exactly the kind of liberal activist that 
the President promised. In case after 
case, when statutory text, standards, 
or guidelines pointed in one direction, 
Judge Jackson set them aside and 
charted a course for a different out-
come. 
As a district court judge, the nomi-
nee heard the case of a liberal activist 
group challenging the Federal Govern-
ment’s authority to deport illegal im-
migrants. The statute in question 
plainly gave the Department of Home-
land Security ‘‘sole and unreviewable 
discretion’’ to enforce the policy. 
But, apparently, it didn’t lead to the 
policy outcome Judge Jackson wanted. 
So she ignored the statute, sided with 
the activists, and used a nationwide in-
junction—a nationwide injunction—to 
impose her new policymaking on the 
entire country. 
This was such a blatant act of judi-
cial activism that even the liberal DC 
Circuit overturned her ruling. 
Or take another case involving a 
fentanyl trafficker. If you read the ini-
tial trial transcripts, Judge Jackson 
editorialized and expressed regret that 
the law forced her to punish him some-
what harshly. She literally apologized 
to this self-described ‘‘kingpin’’ that 
she wasn’t allowed to go softer. 
But the next time she saw this crimi-
nal at a compassionate release hearing, 
Judge Jackson was ready to legislate 
from the bench to give him the sen-
tence she wished that she could have 
given him before. 
Even after the judge explicitly ac-
knowledged the First Step Act was not 
retroactive, she tortured its compas-
sionate release provisions to make it 
retroactive anyway. 
The fentanyl kingpin will be coming 
soon to a neighborhood near you, 
thanks to Judge Jackson. Congres-
sional intent was no match for Judge 
Jackson’s intent. 
And then there is Judge Jackson’s 
troubling record in a variety of cases 
involving child exploitation. On aver-
age, where these awful crimes are con-
cerned, Judge Jackson’s peers on the 
Federal bench fall within the stiff sen-
tences Congress prefers a third of the 
time. But in 11 cases, Judge Jackson 
didn’t fall within the guidelines even 
once. 
At her confirmation hearing last 
month, the Judiciary Committee gave 
Judge Jackson a chance to clear up the 
activist track record. The nominee did 
not reassure. 
She repeatedly declined to answer 
why her discretion slanted so dramati-
cally and consistently in the direction 
of going soft on crime. She just kept 
repeating that she had the discretion. 
Clearly, what Senators wanted to know 
is why she used the discretion the way 
she did. 
Judge Jackson did tip her hand on a 
few occasions. She acknowledged that 
her ignoring the guidelines amounted 
to ‘‘making policy determinations.’’ 
Another time she referenced her per-
sonal ‘‘policy disagreements’’ to ex-
plain her jurisprudence. 
So if you look at her sentencing tran-
scripts, that is exactly right. Not only 
did the judge herself make frequent 
reference to her ‘‘policy disagreement’’ 
with the guidelines, but you can see 
the prosecutors in her courtroom knew 
they had to acknowledge her bias as 
well before arguing that she should fi-
nally get tough in their particular 
case. But always in vain, of course, be-
cause she never got tough once—not 
once—in this area. But prosecutors 
knew what policy bias they were going 
to get when they showed up in Judge 
Jackson’s courtroom. 
Of course, this is exactly, precisely 
what we do not want judges doing. 
Senate Republicans gave the judge 
many opportunities to reassure, but in 
many cases, the nominee just dug deep-
er. At one point, the judge even echoed 
an infamous quotation from one of the 
most 
famous 
judicial 
activists 
in 
American history, the archliberal Jus-
tice Brennan used to say the most im-
portant rule in constitutional law was 
the ‘‘Rule of Five’’—the ‘‘Rule of 
Five.’’ 
And Judge Jackson told the Senate 
‘‘any time the Supreme Court has five 
votes, then they have a majority for 
whatever opinion they determine.’’ 
That is judicial activism summarized 
in one sentence. 
So to summarize, Judge Jackson’s 
nomination started off on the wrong 
foot because President Biden had prom-
ised he would only nominate a judicial 
activist. I hoped that maybe the 
judge’s record and testimony would 
persuade us otherwise. Maybe she 
would persuade the Senate that she un-
derstands the proper judicial role. Un-
fortunately, what happened was just 
the opposite. 
I opposed Judge Jackson’s confirma-
tion to her current post last year over 
these very same concerns, and this 
process has only made those concerns 
stronger. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
The majority whip. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I lis-
tened to the Republican leader speak-
ing about the Supreme Court nominee 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who is 
coming before the Senate either today 
or tomorrow, we hope, for a confirma-
tion vote. We have solid support for her 
nomination on the Democratic side and 
three Republican Senators who have 
announced that they will join us to 
make it a bipartisan majority in her 
favor. 
She is deserving of this. She has an 
extraordinary background. She has the 
kind of resume that every lawyer 
would dream of: to graduate from Har-
vard Law School and then to clerk at 
every level of the Federal judiciary, in-
cluding clerk to the Justice she hopes 
to succeed, Stephen Breyer; and then 
to serve on the Sentencing Commis-
sion, which is considered one of the 
more prestigious assignments, trying 
to rationalize the sentencing under 
Federal law; and then, of course, to 
serve on the district court in the DC 
district and to issue some 570 or 80 dif-
ferent opinions—written opinions—dur-
ing that time; to be elevated to the DC 
Circuit Court, often called the second 
highest court in the land, where she 
served as well with distinction; and 
now to be the first African-American 
woman nominated to serve on the U.S. 
Supreme Court. It is an incredible 
record. 
And she has made the rounds, as they 
say, in the Senate, visiting 95 or 96 dif-
ferent Senators, sitting down with 
them privately in their offices, answer-
ing any questions or concerns that 
they wish to express. 
So I think she is an exceptional per-
son. If you look at her record in all of 
these cases that she has handed down 
written opinions in—as I said, it is 
close to 600, and 100 of them were 
criminal cases where she imposed sen-
tences, and some 10 or 15 of those cases 
which have been highlighted by her Re-
publican critics, relating to the issue of 
the exploitation of children and por-
nography, in every single case, she im-
posed a prison sentence. 
So to argue that she is soft on crime 
is to ignore that reality and to ignore 
the reality that she is endorsed—en-
dorsed—by the largest law enforcement 
organization in America, the Fraternal 
Order of Police. She is endorsed by the 
International Association of Chiefs of 
Police and other noteworthy organiza-
tions, the National Organization of 
Black Law Enforcement, former pros-
ecutors in the District of Columbia. 
She has made it very clear that when 
it comes to applying the law to the 
facts, she does it with evenhandedness, 
so much so that she is respected by 
both sides of the table—the prosecu-
tor’s side of the table and the defense 
side of the table. That takes some 
doing, but she has achieved it. And

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1991 
April 6, 2022 
that is why her selection by President 
Biden is the right person for the right 
time for the right job. She is going to 
make history if we give her this con-
firming vote. 
Now, I will tell you, when you pub-
lish some 580 to 600 opinions, you are 
going to find something in one of those 
opinions to raise. I listened carefully as 
Senator MCCONNELL
went to one of 
those opinions and drew his own con-
clusions. I would ask him to take care 
in accepting that as the fair way to 
measure a person. People often say 
that in the U.S. Senate—they ask us: 
Are you conservative or are you liberal 
or are you a fiscal conservative? Where 
do you stand on civil liberties? And 
people announce a position that they 
would like to believe they fit in. Then 
folks go back and look at your voting 
record and then ask: Well, how do you 
explain this, Senator? So in any given 
day, any given vote can raise a ques-
tion as to a generalization about who 
you are and what you believe. 
For instance, there was a time, as 
hard as it may be to believe, when peo-
ple were suggesting amending the Con-
stitution of the United States to make 
burning an American flag a violation— 
controversial. All of us revere the flag, 
but the notion of making this an 
amendment to the Constitution was a 
matter of great controversy and de-
bate. 
I remember it well in the Senate Ju-
diciary 
Committee. 
I 
came 
down 
against it, saying that I revered the 
flag, but the principles and values be-
hind it were equally or more important 
to me, and so I opposed flag burning 
and so did the Senator from Kentucky. 
Yes, the minority leader, Senator 
MCCONNELL, opposed flag burning. The 
organization that agreed with our posi-
tion was the ACLU. Now, can I gener-
alize from that position which Senator 
MCCONNELL took years ago that he is 
an ACLU-type of Senator? It would be 
wrong to draw that conclusion. There 
may have been other instances where 
he agreed with them, but it was rare. 
What I am saying is, if you can take 
one vote and measure a Senator and re-
alize that it falls short of being an ac-
curate and honest measurement, the 
same thing is true for a judge, to take 
one opinion and say: Well, she ruled 
against President Trump on the issue 
of immigration, therefore, she is an ac-
tivist liberal judge. She ruled as well 
for President Trump in other cases in 
his favor, and ruled against Democratic 
Presidents when they came up with 
their proposals before the court. So 
generalizations are not fair for her or 
for individual Members of the Senate 
based on one opinion, one vote, and 
that is what many are trying to do. 
I will also tell you that this notion— 
and it pains me to even bring it to the 
floor, but I know it is going to come up 
in the next day or two—that she is soft 
on crime. As I mentioned, the law en-
forcement groups would not be endors-
ing her if they believed she was soft on 
crime. 
And the notion that she is somehow, 
in the words of one Republican Sen-
ator—that her sentencing ‘‘endangers 
children,’’ that is painful because he 
said as much in front of her family. 
And I thought about that, how painful 
that must have been for her to hear 
those words. They are not true. And to 
take one or two situations, each of 
them unique in their factual cir-
cumstances, and to generalize in terms 
of her position on an issue of that grav-
ity is fundamentally unfair. But we 
have done it, too, on the Democratic 
side, and I am going to be the first to 
admit, as I look back in history, there 
are things that should have been han-
dled better when Republican nominees 
were before us. 
And the majority of Republican Sen-
ators on the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, led by Ranking Member CHUCK 
GRASSLEY, I believe, were respectful 
and dealt with the judge in a fair man-
ner. They asked tough questions, as 
they were expected to, but did not 
cross the line into personal attack. 
There were three or four who broke 
that rule, as far as I was concerned, but 
the vast majority of Republican Sen-
ators were factual, were fair, and were 
basing their questions on sound legal 
questions before any Supreme Court 
nominee’s consideration. That I think 
will be talked about over the next cou-
ple days, as it should be. 
TRIBUTE TO ERIK RAVEN 
Mr. President, I want to take a mo-
ment to thank a former member of my 
staff who is an extraordinary man. He 
is smart, he gives wise counsel, and is 
truly devoted to this Nation. He 
worked for me for years. 
I have worked with Erik Raven since 
2014, when I became ranking member of 
the 
Senate 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee on Defense, and Erik was 
the chief clerk of the subcommittee. 
The title ‘‘clerk’’ is misleading. He was 
the brains and the operational force be-
hind that subcommittee. 
As my right hand, Erik led the mas-
sive and critically important effort to 
appropriate an average of $700 billion a 
year for our national defense budget. 
Incidentally, that is about half of our 
Government’s 
annual 
discretionary 
spending—a big assignment—and Erik 
was the right person for that assign-
ment. 
As I mentioned before, my first intro-
duction to the Senate was many years 
ago, as an intern to a former Illinois 
Senator, Paul Douglas. Douglas was a 
respected economist who joined the 
Marines at age 50—50—to defend de-
mocracy in World War II. He was badly 
wounded, became a war hero, and then 
was elected to the Senate. 
Douglas famously said that you don’t 
have to be a wastrel to be a liberal. 
Douglas fought against waste in gov-
ernment because he understood that 
every misspent dollar weakens our na-
tional defense, every wasted dollar un-
dermines our ability to build a better 
future. I think Paul Douglas would 
have liked Erik Raven. 
Erik has been a stalwart ally in my 
efforts to advance our national defense 
capabilities while also protecting tax-
payers’ dollars and investing in things 
like defense medical research and do-
mestic sourcing of the components 
critical to our defense industrial base. 
I traveled with Erik to more places 
than I can remember. There was one 
particularly eye-opening visit to a 
classified facility in a desert outside 
Las Vegas. You might say it was out of 
this world. I will also remember a trip 
we made to Poland and the Baltics in 
2018, wherein we discussed the danger 
of the overreliance on Russian gas and 
other issues. Today, we see that play-
ing out, tragically, in Ukraine. 
It was also a relief to have Erik at 
my side. His deep institutional knowl-
edge, his sense of humor, and his black 
bag full of secrets have served me and 
the committee and America well. 
I know that Senator JON TESTER of 
Montana, the new chair of that same 
subcommittee, and other Senators with 
whom Erik worked share my high re-
gard for him. 
In his 20 years in the Senate, Erik 
has worked for Senator DIANNE FEIN-
STEIN, the late Senator Ted Kennedy, 
Robert 
Byrd, 
Senator 
Inouye, 
our 
former colleague Senator Mikulski, 
and our current chairman, Senator 
LEAHY. To countless Senate staffers 
along the way, Erik has been a mentor, 
a cheerleader, and always a friend. 
In addition to his public service, he is 
a pilot and a black belt in karate. He 
enjoys golfing and running. He is a de-
voted husband to Ann, his wife, and fa-
ther to Edward, his 7-year-old son. 
Very soon, pending Senate approval, 
he will be our Nation’s next Under Sec-
retary of the Navy. 
The Senate’s loss is the Navy’s and 
America’s gain. I am confident that 
Erik will excel in his new challenge 
just as he has in the Senate. I wish him 
the very best of luck and thank him for 
his outstanding service. 
FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES 
Mr. President, it has been almost 6 
years since the disastrous collapse of 
the infamous for-profit college chain 
ITT Tech. 
At that time, ITT Tech was one of 
the largest chains of for-profit colleges 
in the country—130 campuses spread 
over 38 States and 40,000 students en-
rolled. It closed its campuses 2 weeks 
after the Federal Department of Edu-
cation barred the parent company from 
enrolling any more students while 
using Federal student aid dollars. 
I have come to this floor countless 
times to talk about the deceptive, 
predatory, desperate tactics of the for- 
profit college industry at large. 
At the peak of its profitability, in 
2000 to 2003, it was the hottest sector 
on Wall Street. Publicly traded shares 
in for-profit colleges rose 460 percent 
according to one analysis. In 2010, 
these for-profit colleges swept up more 
than $32 billion in Federal student aid 
dollars. Hundreds of millions more 
flowed in through the GI bill. For ITT

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1992 
April 6, 2022 
Tech, the total haul in Federal dollars 
that year reached $1.1 billion. Six years 
later, the whole ITT Tech house of 
cards collapsed in a cloud of scandal, 
leaving students and taxpayers holding 
the bag. 
Now a new report by the Project on 
Predatory Student Lending reveals dis-
turbing facts about ITT Tech—their de-
ception, their high-pressure recruiting 
tactics, and other forms of fraud and 
abuse that they used to rack up mas-
sive profits. The report is entitled 
‘‘Dreams Destroyed: How ITT Tech-
nical Institute Defrauded a Generation 
of Students.’’ 
What makes this new report particu-
larly damning is that the details of 
these abuses came not only from de-
frauded students but from the com-
pany’s own recruiters and top execu-
tives. 
Like 
the 
internal 
company 
memos that finally shed light on the 
inner workings of the tobacco industry, 
the ITT records reveal a company that 
prioritized profits over everything else. 
Two years before ITT Tech’s collapse, 
the company’s disgraced CEO, Kevin 
Modany, wrote in an email to his mar-
keting chief: 
I do not have anything more important on 
my agenda . . . [recruitment] is my personal 
top priority. 
Prospective students were lied to and 
bombarded with high-pressure tactics 
to get them to enroll and sign up for 
more and more and more student loans. 
One former ITT Tech recruiter com-
pared the working conditions to a 
‘‘sweatshop,’’ where all that mattered 
was hitting a ‘‘quota.’’ 
Appallingly, 
recruiters 
were 
in-
structed to use the ‘‘pain funnel,’’ they 
called it, which was a set of eight ques-
tions designed to reveal all prospective 
students’ vulnerabilities. By identi-
fying a student’s pain points, such as 
working at a dead-end job or feeling 
unappreciated, recruiters were trained 
to exploit that pain and present ITT 
Tech as the solution to this poor stu-
dent’s problems. 
ITT Tech then inflated grades and 
falsified attendance records to keep 
students enrolled so they could squeeze 
out more Federal dollars and leave 
more student debt for the kids. The 
company routinely, falsely, filed finan-
cial aid forms, including stealing stu-
dents’ passwords and signing financial 
aid forms without the students’ knowl-
edge or consent. The list goes on and 
on. 
The result: Modany and the ITT 
shareholders made millions. Taxpayers 
got ripped off. Students ended up hold-
ing the bag with worthless diplomas, if 
they finished, and with a mountain of 
student debt whether they finished or 
not. 
What did Modany think about the 
students he was defrauding? 
Look at his words. This is the man 
who was the executive who was doing 
this to these students. 
He said: ‘‘Take off the gloves with 
the student and slug back. Do not hold 
back in any way, and anything that we 
can put out there to question the legit-
imacy of his complaint we should most 
definitely do so. We need to call him 
out publicly.’’ 
That is the kind of respect they had 
for these students. 
Many of these students, as the major-
ity leader knows, were first-generation 
college students. Their mothers and fa-
thers were so proud that they were at 
ITT Tech—that they made it into col-
lege. Mom and dad thought they would 
have to work extra hours, but it would 
be worth it. It was a fraud from start 
to finish—a fraud on American tax-
payers and a terrible fraud on these 
students and their families. 
Modany was equally contemptuous of 
public officials who asked questions 
about ITT Tech’s business practices. 
This 2015 email is a racist tirade 
against an Education Department offi-
cial, Rohit Chopra, a longtime foe of 
predatory lenders who is now Director 
of the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau. 
Mr. Modany rails that Mr. Chopra 
ought to be jailed at Guantanamo and 
waterboarded. 
Now, you might say, ‘‘That’s great, 
but ITT Tech is gone. Why does it mat-
ter?’’ 
First: There are still tens of thou-
sands of ITT Tech students who were 
defrauded. Under the Higher Education 
Act’s Borrower Defense provision, their 
loans should be discharged by the Edu-
cation Department. 
The evidence revealed in this re-
port—evidence collected by the Edu-
cation 
Department 
and 
numerous 
State attorneys general—clearly shows 
that fraud was rampant and systemic 
at ITT Tech. 
The Department should do more to 
provide ITT Tech borrowers with the 
relief to which they are entitled under 
the law—without requiring individual 
applications. 
The second reason is stated in the re-
port’s conclusion, which asserts ‘‘ITT 
was able to escape responsibility for its 
financial insolvency by declaring bank-
ruptcy in September 2016. Its execu-
tives simply walked away from the dis-
aster they created.’’ 
Kevin Modany was fined $200,000. But 
that is essentially a parking ticket for 
a man who made $36 million defrauding 
students, taxpayers, and investors be-
tween 2007 and 2014. 
The Federal Government must use 
its authority to hold for-profit college 
executives 
personally 
accountable. 
Claw back some of their fat profits to 
repay students and taxpayers. 
And third, the for-profit college in-
dustry continues to prey on students 
using the same tactics as the band of 
thieves at ITT Tech. 
For-profit Ashford University and its 
former parent company Zovio were just 
found to have given students false or 
misleading information about career 
outcomes . . . cost and financial aid 
. . . and transfer credits . . . to get 
them to enroll. Sound familiar? 
Ashford was ordered to pay more 
than $22.37 million in penalties. 
But . . . Zovio recently sold Ashford 
to the University of Arizona while con-
tinuing to operate much of the school. 
What actions will the Education De-
partment take to protect students . . . 
and taxpayer dollars . . . at the now- 
renamed Arizona Global Campus—for-
merly Ashford? 
I’ve spoken about these matters with 
both 
Education 
Secretary 
Miguel 
Cardona and Rich Cordray, head of the 
Department’s Federal Student Aid of-
fice. 
I’m glad the Biden administration 
has committed publicly to improving 
enforcement at the Department of Edu-
cation. 
There are other ITT Techs out there. 
For the sake of students and taxpayers, 
the Education Department under this 
administration must begin to use its 
immense enforcement authority to pro-
tect them from the swindlers and 
conmen. 
Mr. President, I have been talking 
about for-profit colleges for a number 
of years. Luckily, we have a President 
and a Secretary of Education who are 
putting watchmen in place, guardians 
of students in place, who believe that it 
is more important that kids are treat-
ed fairly and honestly than it is for 
some executive to make millions of 
dollars off of an abuse of the system. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I 
want to thank my friend and colleague, 
the senior Senator from Illinois, not 
only for his wonderful remarks here 
today but for his passion on this issue. 
He was one of the first to blow the 
whistle on these colleges. 
When you hear about this, it just 
boils your blood—boils your blood. 
These kids did nothing wrong. It is one 
of the reasons we believe student debt 
should be forgiven. The Federal Gov-
ernment gave them the loans—that 
was required by law—but they were 
taken advantage of through no fault of 
their own. 
I wonder if this Mr. Modany has been 
prosecuted for any of these things. He 
does not deserve to have, probably, the 
millions he has on the backs of all of 
these students. 
But I thank the Senator from the 
bottom of my heart. This boils our 
blood, what they did to these kids. 
That is one of the reasons we believe 
that the White House ought to forgive 
up to $50,000 of student debt. 
OK. Let’s go to another subject. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Yesterday, Mr. President, was, truly, 
a sorry sight here on the Senate floor. 
Senate Republicans, down to the last 
Member, blocked critical funding for 
more vaccines, more testing, more life-
saving therapeutics that our country 
needs to protect against the dangers of 
future COVID variants.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1993 
April 6, 2022 
The proposal we had before the Sen-
ate was exceedingly reasonable, care-
fully negotiated, and desperately need-
ed, but Senate Republicans blocked a 
mere debate on COVID aid, knowing 
full well of the consequences for the 
American people. In knowing the con-
sequences, Republicans said no to 
merely debating more money for boost-
er shots and vaccinations and research 
into future treatments. In knowing the 
consequences, Republicans said no to 
merely 
debating 
more 
testing. 
In 
knowing 
the 
consequences, 
Repub-
licans said no to merely debating no 
less than $5 billion for lifesaving thera-
peutics—an indispensable tool for those 
with COVID illnesses. 
And why did Republicans say no? 
Because 
they 
wanted 
to 
cripple 
COVID funding legislation with poison 
pills that they knew would derail this 
bill—would derail the bill. Let me say 
it again. Instead of joining Democrats 
to begin a simple debate on COVID leg-
islation, Republicans wanted to kill 
this bill with unrelated poison pills. 
This is potentially devastating for 
the American people. Vaccines, thera-
peutics, and testing were negotiated in 
good faith, and they should not—they 
should not—be held hostage to extra-
neous, unrelated issues. This is too im-
portant for the health of our country. 
The administration, for months, has 
made clear that new COVID funding is 
a matter of the highest urgency. Some 
critical COVID response measures are 
already being scaled back due to dwin-
dling funding. Their message that Con-
gress had to act—the administration’s 
message—was unmistakable. 
I hope Republicans will get serious 
about this. It should not be so difficult 
to do something so good and important 
for our country. 
Let me say one other thing. 
Our 
Republican 
colleagues 
think 
they may be gaining some temporary 
advantage, but God forbid a second var-
iant hits and people ask: Why aren’t 
the vaccines there? Why aren’t the 
therapeutics there? The answer will be 
that the Senate Republicans, to a per-
son, blocked the ability to move for-
ward and get this legislation done be-
cause they wanted to play politics and 
inject extraneous issues into the de-
bate. 
But it is not going to deter us from 
getting this done. It is vital for keep-
ing schools, churches, business, and 
other communities open if and when a 
future, more potent variant rears its 
ugly head. It is certainly better to act 
now than to pay the price 10 times 
down the line. We are going to keep 
working to make sure that Congress 
sends COVID funding to the President’s 
desk. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. President, on SCOTUS, the U.S. 
Senate, happily, wonderfully, is on the 
brink of completing one of the most 
important responsibilities entrusted to 
it under the Constitution: consenting 
to the President’s nominee for the U.S. 
Supreme Court. As I said, happily and 
wonderfully, it will be the first Afri-
can-American woman to ever serve on 
that august body. 
Any time the Senate elevates some-
one to the highest pinnacles of the Fed-
eral judiciary, the impact literally 
lasts a lifetime and, often, far beyond 
that. The men and women who sit on 
the Supreme Court have the power to 
render judgment on any question they 
see fit that comes before them. The 
consequences of their decisions are 
seen and felt and reckoned with from 
here to the farthest corners of our 
country. So confirming a Supreme 
Court nominee is, in other words, a big 
deal to the Senate—one of the biggest 
deals, in fact. And, before the week is 
out, the Chamber is set to follow 
through, once again, on this august and 
awesome responsibility. 
But, of course, even though this is 
one of the biggest deals for the Senate 
to do in any situation, it is even a big-
ger deal now. This time is different. 
The nominee, the 116th Justice, is dif-
ferent in some important ways than 
those who came before. 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, like 
many before her, is brilliant, accom-
plished, and qualified to be on the 
Court, but never—never before—has 
the Supreme Court had a Black woman 
bear the title of Justice. She will be 
the first, and I have no doubt, in my 
mind, that she will pave the way for 
others in the future. 
The exultation among so many who 
have waited for this moment—of young 
girls throughout America who may 
say, ‘‘I can do this, too’’; the untapped 
potential even for young people, par-
ticularly women of color, who are not 
interested in the law or in the Supreme 
Court but who say, ‘‘I can go some-
where; I can do something; I can get 
there’’—is going to be great for Amer-
ica. 
There are many considerations that 
the Senate should ponder when we are 
faced with the question of confirming 
judges. Diversity and representation is 
certainly one of them. It is a key fea-
ture of a healthy and vibrant democ-
racy. When Americans of all walks of 
life come before the court, of course 
they should have confidence that those 
who don the robes have the ability to 
walk in their own shoes—to see and un-
derstand their sides of the story. 
That is why diversity of background 
and experience has been one of the 
most important priorities in the Sen-
ate as we have confirmed the Presi-
dent’s judges, and over the last year, as 
has been noted, we have made incred-
ible progress on that front. 
Of the 58 Senate-confirmed judges, 
three-quarters have been women, and 
two-thirds have been people of color. 
To be clear, these judges are diverse 
not just through their backgrounds but 
in their experiences. More public de-
fenders, more civil rights attorneys, 
more nonprofit lawyers have been 
added to the Federal bench. 
After years of the previous adminis-
tration’s confirming judges who were 
disproportionately 
White, 
dispropor-
tionately 
male, 
disproportionately 
from big law firms, Senate Democrats 
are working to bring balance back to 
our judiciary. It will make our democ-
racy healthier, fairer, and stronger. 
As the country grows increasingly di-
verse in this century, Judge Jackson’s 
confirmation will be a major step to-
ward achieving that goal, and I so look 
forward to finishing the work to con-
firm this most qualified, most deserv-
ing, most historic nominee. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. President, finally, as Russia’s 
war in Ukraine reaches an abominable 
level of brutality—you see these pic-
tures of the people, innocent civilians 
who were shot—young, old, children, 
men, women—every single American 
should unite on the side of the Ukrain-
ian people and against Putin’s indis-
criminate violence. 
The pictures we have seen coming 
out of Ukraine and coming out of the 
town of Bucha are a pure manifestation 
of evil, hundreds of civilians murdered 
in cold blood—men, women, children, 
the elderly, the defenseless, people who 
were tied with their hands behind their 
backs, clearly civilians, shot in the 
back of the head because they are 
Ukrainians. It is the only reason. It is 
a genocide. It was called a genocide 
today by a Ukrainian official. It is a 
genocide. When these people are shot 
simply because of their nationality— 
they don’t have arms—that is genocide, 
especially when it occurs in the large 
numbers it has already, individuals 
trying to live their own lives, targeted 
to be killed because of their nation-
ality. 
Putin is a war criminal. When Putin 
says Ukraine and Russia are together 
after he did this, no Ukrainian is ever 
going to believe it. Even the isolated 
Putin must know that, but he is cor-
nered. And so he is a war criminal. 
Any nation that indiscriminately and 
intentionally targets civilians should 
not enjoy doing business with Amer-
ican companies. But, shamefully, Koch 
Industries is continuing to do business 
in Putin’s Russia and putting their 
profits ahead of defending democracy. 
There is an explosive report this 
morning that the Koch political arm is 
now pushing for the United States to 
abandon our allies and back off the 
hard-hitting sanctions the Biden ad-
ministration has imposed on Russia. 
The Kochs are selling out democracy 
for their own profits. 
Every 
Senator—Democrat, 
Repub-
lican—we 
all 
care 
about 
Ukraine. 
Every Senator needs to condemn this 
push by the Koch brothers and call on 
Koch Industries to immediately sus-
pend their operations in Russia. I look 
forward to every tough-talking Senate 
Republican to come here to the floor 
and call out the Koch brothers for un-
dermining America’s resolve against 
Putin’s illegal, unprovoked, and crimi-
nal invasion of Ukraine. 
Senate Democrats are working on 
legislation to add Russia to existing

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Virginia. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I proudly 
rise to speak about the nomination of 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an 
Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
When I began law school in the fall of 
1979, the only woman Justice at the Su-
preme Court was a white marble statue 
on the steps. There were no women 
members of the Court. There had never 
been women members of the Court. 
The motto engraved over the Court’s 
entrance, ‘‘Equal Justice Under Law,’’ 
sounded great, but it also rang hollow 
for the more than half of the U.S. popu-
lation that had never seen themselves 
represented 
on 
the 
U.S. 
Supreme 
Court. 
And it was more than just the ab-
sence of women on the Court. In 1868, 
the 14th Amendment to the Constitu-
tion was adopted in core memorable 
phrase guaranteeing to all persons the 
equal protection of the law. But the 
Court, for more than 100 years, refused 
to extend equal protection to women. 
In one of the first cases testing the 
meaning of the phrase ‘‘equal protec-
tion of the law to all persons,’’ the Su-
preme Court considered an Illinois 
State law restricting the practice of 
law to men only. A dynamic, young, 
feminist 
activist, 
Myra 
Bradwell, 
passed the Illinois bar exam and ap-
plied for a law license to practice law 
in Illinois. She was turned down be-
cause she was a woman. She appealed 
her case to the Illinois Supreme Court, 
and they turned her down because she 
was a woman. And then she came to 
the U.S. Supreme Court and said: We 
have just changed the Constitution to 
guarantee equal protection of the law 
to all persons, surely, you cannot turn 
me down in my quest to practice law 
after I have passed the Illinois bar 
exam. 
The Supreme Court of the United 
States, in 1873, by a vote of 8 to 1, ruled 
that she was not entitled to an equal 
right to practice the profession of her 
choosing. 
Let me read you a key part of the de-
cision in that case: 
The paramount destiny and mission of 
women are to fulfill the noble and benign of-
fice of wife and mother. This is the law of 
the Creator. 
So a wife and mother can’t be a law-
yer? So every woman must be a wife 
and mother? That is what the Supreme 
Court determined in analyzing the sim-
ple phrase ‘‘all persons are entitled to 
equal protection of the law.’’ 
Here is a great trivia question: When 
did the Supreme Court finally decide 
that equal protection of the law ap-
plied to women? 1971. It took 103 years 
after the 14th Amendment was adopted 
for the Supreme Court to say: Wait a 
minute, equal protection of the law to 
all persons, that means women. 
In the case of Reed v. Reed, the Court 
ruled that a State statute providing 
that males must be preferred to fe-
males in the administration of es-
tates—it was an estate administration 
case—the Court ruled, wait a minute, 
that violates women’s rights to equal 
protection. Who was the lawyer in that 
case? A dynamic, young civil rights 
lawyer with the ACLU named Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. 
So within my career as a civil rights 
attorney, from when I started law 
school in 1979 to today—43 years later— 
I have seen great change in the law’s 
treatment of women and in their rep-
resentation on the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The nomination of Judge Ketanji 
Brown Jackson will make history. She 
will be the first African-American 
woman on the Court. And she will 
move a Court that had never had a 
woman member when I started law 
school to a Court where four of the 
nine members are women. 
What powerful evidence of the capac-
ity we have as a nation to come closer 
and closer to the equality ideal that 
was articulated as our moral North 
Star in the opening phrase of the Dec-
laration of Independence drafted by a 
Virginian in 1776. 
So I celebrate the history-making na-
ture of this appointment, but it is not 
the reason for my support. 
I support Judge Jackson’s nomina-
tion because of her stellar academic 
credentials, her prestigious judicial 
clerkships, her dedicated service as an 
attorney and member of the U.S. Sen-
tencing 
Commission, 
her 
well-re-
spected tenure as a Federal trial and 
appellate judge, and the multiple attes-
tations that she has received attrib-
uting to her fairness and to her char-
acter. 
In particular—in particular—I think 
that her successful confirmation as a 
Justice will add two critical skill sets 
to this nine-member collegial body: 
first, that she is a public defender; and, 
second, that she has been a trial judge. 
That she was a public defender—so 
much of the Court’s docket deals with 
issues that are at the heart of the 
American 
criminal 
justice 
system. 
There are currently members of the 
Court—Justice 
Sotomayor, 
Justice 
Alito—who had experience as prosecu-
tors in both the State and Federal 
courts before they began their service 
in the judicial branch. That experience 
as prosecutor is really important expe-
rience, and it is an important expertise 
to have on the Supreme Court. 
But a Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson 
will be the first public defender ever to 
sit on the Court. And for a Court of 
nine to share perspectives and grapple 
with resolution of questions involving 
the criminal justice system, for that 
Court only to have people who pros-
ecuted cases and not have people who 
have defended, in particular, the most 
indigent criminal defendants—it is a 
Court that doesn’t have the balanced 
360-degree perspective that we would 
want in these important matters. So 
the fact that she served honorably as a 
Federal public defender, in my view, is 
a strong trait for her, but it is even a 
better trait if you think about what we 
would need in a nine-member Supreme 
Court. 
Second, she has been a trial judge, a 
Federal district court judge in the dis-
trict court for the District of Colum-
bia. And that is really, really impor-
tant. There is only one other member 
of the Court now who was a trial judge, 
and that is Justice Sotomayor. Some 
of the members of the Court, as far as 
I know—I can find no evidence—not 
only were they not trial judges, some 
of them I am not sure ever tried cases. 
What does it mean to have a trial 
judge on the Court? Well, again, think 
about the docket of the Supreme 
Court. So much of the docket of the 
Supreme Court is ruling on questions 
and controversies, whose ultimate goal 
is to make the Nation’s trials—civil 
and criminal trials—more fair: admis-
sibility of evidence, sentencing stand-
ards, definitions of police misconduct 
that could either gain or shed sov-
ereignty immunity in a trial going on 
in a trial court, how to impanel jurors, 
how to instruct jurors, when to strike 
a juror if there is evidence that the 
juror may have a bias or prejudice. 
These are all cases that come before 
the Supreme Court all the time. And 
these kinds of cases, it is particularly 
important to have a Court that is well- 
represented by people who have actu-
ally been in the courtroom and done it. 
What trial judges have to do is they 
have to figure out how to instruct and 
impanel jurors and deal with the juror 
who may have a bias question. They 
have to rule on evidentiary objections 
in a split second; dispose of discovery 
disputes; rule on dispositive motions 
like motions to dismiss or summary 
judgment motions; in bench trials, ac-
tually render judgments, which usually 
involves 
credibility 
determinations 
among competing witnesses. 
The judges in the Federal system are 
those with the power of sentencing, the 
most difficult power of all. If you have 
not been a trial lawyer or a trial judge, 
you might underestimate how difficult 
and challenging each of those tasks 
are. But if you have had the experience 
of being a trial lawyer or trial judge, 
you understand how important they 
are. 
I asked Judge Jackson as I inter-
viewed her, tell me how you think that 
being a trial judge might help you on 
the Court. She said, so much of our 
opinions are essentially instructions to 
State and Federal trial courts, here is 
how to conduct a fair trial. I think my 
experience will enable me to write 
opinions that are more workable; that 
are more understandable; that are 
more practical; that are more likely to 
lead to a result that is fair to the par-
ties, but also one that will increase the

respect for the decision making in 
courts themselves. 
When I was Governor of Virginia, I 
did not have the power to put judges on 
the bench, except in rare instances. In 
the Virginia State system, I wouldn’t 
even nominate judges. The legislature 
would choose the judges, and the Gov-
ernor had no role, except—except— 
when the legislature would deadlock. If 
the house and senate couldn’t agree on 
filling a position, then the Governor 
got to put in a judge or a justice until 
the legislature came back next year, 
and then they would have to vote on 
whether to ratify what the Governor 
had done. 
Three times, when I was Governor, 
my two Republican houses deadlocked 
on an appellate judge: one on the court 
of appeals and two on the Virginia Su-
preme Court. So I had this oppor-
tunity. As somebody who practiced 
civil rights law for 17 years, as some-
body who was married to a juvenile 
court judge, I had the opportunity to 
consider and then nominate people to 
be appellate judges. 
I decided pretty quickly, as I ana-
lyzed who should be appellate judges— 
and I followed this rule in all three of 
my opportunities—that I would ap-
point a great trial judge. In each of the 
three instances, I appointed a great 
trial judge because I knew that that 
great trial judge would be able to sit on 
an appellate court and render rulings 
that weren’t sort of philosopher, king- 
or-queen rulings that might sound good 
in a law review article or in a panel 
discussion, but they could render rul-
ings that would be instantaneously un-
derstood in courtrooms all across the 
Commonwealth and be able to be im-
plemented by the other trial judges, 
who were doing their best every day to 
conduct fair trials. 
So that is why I think the second fac-
tor that Judge Brown Jackson was a 
district court judge handling trials, 
multiple trials and motions every day, 
will put her in such good company as 
she joins Justice Sotomayor as the 
only other member with that experi-
ence. 
I will conclude and just say a Justice 
Ketanji Brown Jackson will add depth 
and perspective to a Court that needs 
it. As we near the 150th anniversary of 
Myra Bradwell’s quixotic case, the con-
firmation of Justice Ketanji Brown 
Jackson will make the statue of justice 
and the engraved phrase ‘‘Equal Jus-
tice Under Law’’ more accurate reflec-
tions of our Nation’s highest Court. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from South Dakota. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the following 
Senators be permitted to speak prior to 
the scheduled vote: myself for up to 15 
minutes, Senator CRUZ for up to 25 
minutes, and Senator STABENOW for up 
to 10 minutes. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
TITLE 42 AND THE BORDER 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we are 
moving from disaster to catastrophe at 
our southern border. Last week, the 
Biden administration announced that 
title 42 COVID–19 restrictions, which 
had provided for the immediate depor-
tation of those who crossed the border 
illegally, will end in May. 
Now, it is ironic that just as the ad-
ministration presses for more COVID 
funding, it is apparently declaring 
COVID is over at the border. Now, I 
just want everybody to think about the 
inherent contradiction in what is being 
said here. By ending title 42, the ad-
ministration says, for all intents and 
purposes, the pandemic is over; it is 
over at the border. But, today, it was 
announced that the student loan pro-
gram—repayments on student loans— 
would be extended until the month of 
August. Why? Presumably because of 
the pandemic. 
There is still a policy in place, Mr. 
President, if you can believe this—yes-
terday, I had the chance to question, at 
the Senate Finance Committee, Sec-
retary Becerra of the Health and 
Human Services Department about a 
policy that is in place right now that 
has not yet been repealed that requires 
children under 5 in Head Start facili-
ties to wear masks—masks not just 
when they are in the classroom but 
when they are outside on the play-
ground—children under 5, to wear 
masks. 
Now, who says that is a bad idea? 
Well, for one, the World Health Organi-
zation. The World Health Organization 
isn’t exactly a conservative-leaning in-
stitution. The World Health Organiza-
tion says that it is not necessary for 
children under 5 to wear a mask be-
cause there is no discernible health or 
safety benefit derived from that. 
So that policy is still in place. Kids 
under the age of 5 at Head Start facili-
ties still have to wear masks, not just 
inside but when they are outside. 
Now student loans, again, have been 
deferred. You don’t have to repay your 
student loans at least until August. It 
has been extended again. 
These policies reflect a belief on be-
half of the administration that we are 
evidently still in a pandemic that re-
quires these policies to stay in place. 
So the student loan deferral request 
has been made or is going to happen. 
They are just going to do it. So they 
are doing that by fiat. And this rule 
that requires children under 5 to wear 
masks suggests we are still very con-
cerned about the pandemic and about 
the spread of COVID–19. Yet, Mr. Presi-
dent, title 42 is going to be lifted at the 
border, which is a pandemic measure. 
It was put in place as a result of the 
pandemic and has enabled our officials 
at the border, Customs and Border Pro-
tection, to be able to at least some-
what manage the flow of illegals com-
ing across the border. Think about 
that. Think about the inherent con-
tradiction, the messages that you are 
sending—in addition, I would add, to 
the $10 billion, which was originally $15 
billion, that is being requested by the 
administration to deal with COVID. 
So you are asking for more funding. 
You are requiring kids to wear masks. 
You are extending the deferral on stu-
dent loan repayments. Yet you are lift-
ing title 42 restrictions. 
Let me tell you what that means. 
Once title 42 restrictions are officially 
lifted, the flood of illegal immigration 
across our southern border is expected 
to become a tsunami. The Department 
of Homeland Security expects as many 
as 18,000 per day to attempt to cross 
our southern border after the policy is 
lifted—18,000 per day. That adds up to 
more than half a million migrants per 
month. 
To put those numbers in perspective, 
in fiscal year 2021, Border Patrol en-
countered more than 1.7 million indi-
viduals attempting to cross our south-
ern border. That was the highest num-
ber ever recorded in a single year. Now 
we are talking about a rate of migra-
tion that would lead to our hitting that 
1-year record in just over 3 months. 
Title 42 restrictions were never in-
tended to be a permanent border solu-
tion, and lifting them would not be a 
problem if the President had some 
meaningful plan in place for dealing 
with the border crisis that has been 
going on since he took office, but he 
doesn’t—again, evidenced by the fact 
that the President has no interest in 
visiting the border, nor has his border 
czar, the Vice President of the United 
States. Neither has been to the border. 
Lifting title 42 without a plan to curb 
illegal immigration is nothing more 
than an invitation for our current cri-
sis to get exponentially worse, which is 
exactly, exactly what the Department 
of Homeland Security expects is going 
to happen. 
Now, you don’t have to take my word 
for it on these problems with the ad-
ministration’s decision. Here is what 
one Democratic Senator had to say 
about the administration’s title 42 de-
cision: 
This is a wrong decision. It’s unacceptable 
to end Title 42 without a plan and coordina-
tion in place to ensure a secure, orderly, and 
humane process at the border. 
This is a wrong decision. It’s unacceptable 
to end Title 42 without a plan and coordina-
tion in place to ensure a secure, orderly, and 
humane process at the border. 
That is from a Democratic Senator. 
Another Democratic Senator noted: 
I think this is not the right time and we 
have not seen a detailed plan from the ad-
ministration. We need assurances that we 
have security at the border and that we pro-
tect communities on this side of the border. 
Another Democratic Senator. 
This is another Democratic Senator, 
a third one: 
Today’s announcement by the CDC and the 
Biden Administration is a frightening deci-
sion. Title 42 has been an essential tool in 
combatting the spread of COVID–19 and con-
trolling the influx of migrants at our south-
ern border. We are already facing an unprec-
edented increase in migrants this year, and 
that will only get worse if the Administra-
tion ends the Title 42 policy. We are nowhere 
near prepared to deal with that influx.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1996 
April 6, 2022 
We are nowhere near prepared to deal with 
that influx. 
Again, a third Democratic Senator 
on the subject of ending title 42. 
Mr. President, under the Biden ad-
ministration, we have had 12 straight 
months of border encounters in excess 
of over 150,000. In February, U.S. Cus-
toms and Border Protection encoun-
tered 164,973 individuals attempting to 
cross our southern border illegally— 
the highest February number in more 
than 20 years. And, of course, those 
numbers only reflect individuals the 
Border Patrol has succeeded in appre-
hending. There is no question that 
many other illegal immigrants have 
crossed the border in the past year 
without being apprehended and have 
disappeared into the United States. 
The President is largely responsible for 
this situation thanks to the series of 
actions he has taken to weaken border 
security and immigration enforcement 
since his administration began. 
Mr. President, illegal immigration is 
a very serious problem for several rea-
sons. First of all, it is dangerous for 
any country not to know who is enter-
ing the country, who is crossing its 
borders. Illegal border crossings are 
not confined to individuals wanting to 
build a better life for themselves. Weak 
borders are an invitation to human 
traffickers, drug smugglers, gangs, and 
even terrorists. 
We currently have a very serious 
fentanyl problem in this country. In 
fact, fentanyl overdose is the leading 
cause of death for U.S. adults between 
the ages of 18 and 45. And where is this 
fentanyl coming from? It is being traf-
ficked across our southern border. In 
fact, Mexico has replaced China as the 
dominant source of fentanyl in the 
United States. There is no question 
that the worse the situation at the bor-
der gets, the easier it is for drug smug-
glers to evade detection and capture. 
Our Border Patrol officers do heroic 
work, but they are stretched incredibly 
thin and have been for the past year. It 
is simply common sense to acknowl-
edge that the greater the flood of ille-
gal immigration they have to contend 
with, the easier it is going to be for bad 
actors to get across the border. 
So there are real security concerns 
that illegal immigration represents. 
There are also serious humanitarian 
concerns. The journey to our southern 
border for those attempting to cross il-
legally is frequently fraught with dan-
ger, and there is nothing compas-
sionate about encouraging individuals 
to undertake that journey, to run the 
risk of exploitation and disease and ex-
posure. 
Finally, encouraging or tacitly en-
dorsing illegal immigration shows a 
real disregard for the rule of law. I am 
a strong supporter of legal immigra-
tion. I am one generation removed 
from immigrants in this country, and I 
hope this country will always serve as 
a refuge for individuals seeking a new 
life for peace and for freedom. But im-
migration laws are not exceptions to 
the principle that the law must be re-
spected. 
We can and should make changes to 
immigration laws as needed to address 
problems or to expand opportunities, 
but immigration must proceed accord-
ing to the law. To suggest otherwise is 
to cultivate contempt for the rule of 
law, not to mention how unfair it is to 
those who have done what is required 
to come here legally. 
As President, President Biden has a 
particular responsibility to care for the 
country’s security. When it comes to 
the border, at least, he is failing in 
that responsibility, and he is betraying 
the duty he owes to the American peo-
ple, who should be able to count on 
their President to care about security 
concerns, including border security. 
We are less than 2 months away from 
the end of title 42 restrictions and the 
border surge that we expect to follow. 
I hope that the President will use that 
time to get serious about developing a 
plan to secure our southern border be-
cause he owes the American people 
nothing less. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Texas. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today 
ahead of the Senate’s vote on Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson to be a Justice 
on the U.S. Supreme Court. There are 
few responsibilities the Senate has that 
are more important than confirming 
judges and, in particular, confirming 
Justices on the Supreme Court of the 
United States. 
The Supreme Court is charged with 
the responsibility of defending and up-
holding the Constitution and the Bill 
of Rights. It is charged with the re-
sponsibility of upholding the rule of 
law and protecting your rights and my 
rights. 
Judge Jackson is someone that I 
have known personally for 30 years. 
She and I went to law school together. 
We were both on the law review to-
gether. Judge Jackson is someone who, 
on a personal level—she is smart; she is 
talented; she is charming. I have al-
ways liked Judge Jackson. But the re-
sponsibility given to the Senate is not 
to make an assessment on a personal 
level, but rather to assess a nominee’s 
record and the kind of job they would 
do for the position to which they have 
been appointed. 
Now, many Democrats in this Cham-
ber and their cheerleaders in the cor-
porate media insist that we cannot ex-
amine Judge Jackson’s record. They 
insist, in fact, that any scrutiny of her 
record, any difficult questions directed 
her way, and, certainly, any opposition 
to her nomination must, must, must be 
rooted in racism or sexism. Sadly, this 
is a common talking point for Demo-
crats. Whenever anyone disagrees with 
them on substance, you must be a rac-
ist. If you are not a socialist, you are a 
racist. That is their standard go-to. 
And in this instance, all should ac-
knowledge and should celebrate the 
historic milestone that would be hav-
ing the first African-American woman 
serve as a Justice on the Supreme 
Court. Given our Nation’s troubled his-
tory on race, that is a major important 
milestone. I would note, though, that 
the Democrats celebrating that fact— 
patting themselves on the back—there 
is more than a little irony in their 
celebrating that fact because the rea-
son that we have not, to date, had an 
African-American woman on the Su-
preme Court—a major reason—is that 
the Democrats who are so proud of 
themselves filibustered a qualified Af-
rican-American woman nominated to 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC 
Circuit. Her name was Janice Rogers 
Brown. She was a justice on the Cali-
fornia Supreme Court, and 20 years 
ago, President George W. Bush, a Re-
publican, nominated her to the DC Cir-
cuit. And Senate Democrats realized 
that 
a 
qualified 
African-American 
woman on the DC Circuit was a real 
threat to go to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
Janice Rogers Brown is a conserv-
ative and a constitutionalist, and for 
Democrats, that was unacceptable. So 
Democrats filibustered Janice Rogers 
Brown. CHUCK
SCHUMER
filibustered 
Janice Rogers Brown. Joe Biden fili-
bustered Janice Rogers Brown. DICK 
DURBIN
filibustered 
Janice 
Rogers 
Brown. PAT LEAHY filibustered Janice 
Rogers Brown. DIANNE FEINSTEIN fili-
bustered Janice Rogers Brown. 
So now, all the Democrats who are 
celebrating putting the first African- 
American woman on the Supreme 
Court have themselves to thank for 
that because it could have happened 20 
years ago. 
But in Senate Democrats’ way of 
viewing things, if a Black woman or a 
Black man or a Hispanic woman or a 
Hispanic man dared to disagree with 
leftist orthodoxy, they do not count. 
Indeed, it was not just Janice Rogers 
Brown. Democrats also filibustered 
Miguel Estrada to the DC Circuit. 
Miguel Estrada, an advocate with su-
perb credentials, was criticized, as the 
staff for Senator Ted Kennedy wrote at 
the time in internal memos that they 
could filibuster ‘‘because he is His-
panic.’’ 
Mr. President, this was before your 
time and my time in this body. 
Here is what Ted Kennedy’s staff told 
them: 
Identify [Miguel Estrada] as especially 
dangerous . . . because he is Latino. 
That is racism—which the Democrats 
put in writing. If you are Black, if you 
are Hispanic, we will target you, we 
will filibuster you, we will block you, 
and that is what they did. For that 
matter, that is what Democrats have 
done for three decades now to Justice 
Clarence Thomas, one of the greatest 
Justices to ever serve on the U.S. Su-
preme Court. And yet, in Democrats’ 
minds, he is not a Black man because 
he dares disagree with their leftist ide-
ology. It is wrong; it is racist; it is cyn-
ical; and it is offensive.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1997 
April 6, 2022 
What we should be doing—what every 
Senator should be doing—is examining 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s record, 
her actual record. If you look at her 
substantive record, it is far out of the 
mainstream. It is an extreme record. If 
you look at her record, I believe it 
demonstrates that Judge Jackson, if 
she is confirmed, will be the single 
most liberal Supreme Court Justice 
ever to serve on the Supreme Court. I 
believe she will be to the left of Justice 
Sotomayor; she will be to the left of 
Justice Kagan; and she will be way, 
way, way to the left of Justice Stephen 
Breyer, the Justice she would be re-
placing. 
What does that mean as a practical 
matter, left and right? Why do the 
American people care about the Su-
preme Court? They care because they 
care about their rights. As a practical 
matter, what it means—I believe the 
odds are nearly 100 percent that Judge 
Jackson would vote to overturn the 
case of Heller v. District of Columbia. 
What is that case? It is the landmark 
case that upholds the Second Amend-
ment right to keep and bear arms, a 
fundamental protection for all of us. 
That case was decided 5 to 4. Judge 
Jackson, I believe, is a vote to over-
turn that case to take away our Second 
Amendment rights, and that means 
every Senator who votes to confirm her 
is voting to take away the Second 
Amendment rights of Americans. 
Judge Jackson, I believe the odds are 
nearly 100 percent that she would vote 
to overturn the Citizens United case. 
What is Citizens United? It is a land-
mark case that protects our right to 
free speech, our right to speak in the 
political process to support candidates, 
to oppose candidates, to express our 
views, and participate in democracy. 
Citizens United was 5 to 4, one vote 
away from being taken away. 
By the way, in the Citizens United 
case, the Obama Justice Department 
argued that the Federal Government 
has the power to ban books. The case 
was 5 to 4. There were four Justices 
willing to go there. Judge Jackson, I 
believe, would support the assertions of 
government power to silence you, to si-
lence me, to silence the men and 
women we represent. 
When it comes to religious liberty, I 
believe Judge Jackson will vote con-
sistently over and over again against 
the religious liberty of Americans, 
against our right to live according to 
our faith, according to our conscience. 
One of the most precious rights, the 
very first right protected in the first 
clause of the First Amendment of the 
Bill of Rights—that is what our Fram-
ers thought about it—is that without 
the right to seek out and worship the 
Lord God Almighty with all of your 
heart, mind, and soul, no other rights 
matter. I believe she will consistently 
vote to undermine that right and, in 
particular, one of the applications of 
that right, the context of school 
choice. 
School choice is the civil rights issue 
of the 21st century. If you care about 
civil rights, if you care about advance-
ment and opportunity for young kids, 
for young African-American kids, for 
young Hispanic kids, there is nothing, 
nothing, nothing that matters more 
than school choice. And yet, the Su-
preme Court, in the case of Zelman v. 
Simmons-Harris, upheld Ohio school 
choice program by one vote, 5 to 4. I 
believe Judge Jackson would vote to 
overturn Zelman v. Simmons-Harris 
and vote to strike down school choice 
programs across the country. 
You know, one of the problems with 
politics today is Members of this body 
like to avoid accountability for what 
they are doing. But everyone in this 
body is on notice that this is a Justice 
who will vote to take away our free 
speech rights, vote to take away our 
religious liberty rights, vote to take 
away our Second Amendment. And 
that means every Senator that votes 
for her cannot avoid responsibility for 
those lawless outcomes. 
When it comes to abortion, Judge 
Jackson’s record is extreme. I believe 
she would vote to strike down every 
single restriction across the country on 
abortion. I believe she would vote to 
strike down prohibitions on Federal 
partial-birth abortion, a truly horrific 
practice opposed by the vast majority 
of Americans. The Supreme Court 
upheld the Federal ban on partial-birth 
abortion by a vote of 5 to 4—one vote 
away. Judge Jackson, based on her 
record of being a radical advocate for 
abortion, will consistently vote to 
strike down reasonable restrictions. 
All of those are extreme positions. 
But if you want to understand just how 
extreme, there was one portion of the 
confirmation hearing that I thought 
spoke volumes: when Senator Marcia 
Blackburn 
asked 
Judge 
Jackson, 
‘‘What is a woman?’’ 
‘‘What is a woman’’ didn’t used to be 
a trick question. One hundred fifteen 
men and women have served on the Su-
preme Court, and all 115 of them would 
have no difficulty whatsoever answer-
ing the question, ‘‘What is a woman’’— 
not so Judge Jackson. Judge Jackson’s 
response: I can’t define a woman. 
‘‘I am not a biologist’’ was her de-
fense. 
Now, does that really mean that 
Judge Jackson doesn’t know what a 
woman is? Of course not. What it does 
show is her sensibility that she is com-
pletely in line with the radical left 
that wants to redefine what a woman is 
and erase it from the dictionary. You 
know, yesterday, a reporter stopped 
me. A reporter from a left-leaning pub-
lication said he was asking every Sen-
ate Republican on the Judiciary Com-
mittee the following question: What is 
a woman? 
You could tell from the expression on 
his face he thought this was a great 
‘‘gotcha’’ question. 
I looked at him and said: An adult fe-
male human. 
He looked at me astonished, and he 
said: Did you look it up? He said, That 
is actually the dictionary definition. 
I said, No. I just speak English. If you 
would like another definition, how 
about this one: A Homo sapien with 
two X chromosomes. For all of re-
corded history, people have known 
what a woman is, but Judge Jackson is 
such a fellow traveler with the radical 
left that she cannot acknowledge com-
mon sense. 
There is a reason the radical left 
groups in this country pressured the 
Biden White House to nominate Judge 
Jackson because she was the most ex-
treme of the nominees being consid-
ered. There is a reason they pledged 
billions of dollars to support her con-
firmation because she is the most ex-
treme of the nominees being consid-
ered. 
Let me give an example of just how 
extreme. In the written questions, I 
submitted a question to Judge Jackson 
that says: 
The theory that humans possess inherent 
or inalienable rights is reflected in the Dec-
laration of Independence, which states: 
We hold these truths to be self-evident, 
that all men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights, that among these are life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
Do you hold a position on whether in-
dividuals possess natural rights, yes or 
no? 
Judge Jackson answered—this is in 
writing: 
I do not hold a position on whether individ-
uals possess natural rights. 
That is a radical broad statement. 
Our country was founded on the quote 
I just read from the Declaration of 
Independence, with those words that 
Thomas Jefferson penned. 
We declared our independence from 
Great Britain. We declared that we 
were our own Nation. We started a rev-
olutionary war. We drafted a Constitu-
tion based on the proposition ‘‘We hold 
these truths to be self-evident.’’ They 
are not evident to Judge Jackson. 
She doesn’t hold a position that ‘‘all 
men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights, that among these 
are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of 
Happiness.’’ Judge Jackson says she 
has no position on whether you have a 
right to life. She has no position over 
whether you have a right to liberty. 
She has no position on whether you 
have a right to the pursuit of happi-
ness. 
If you are a modern leftist, if you are 
a socialist who wants the government 
to control every aspect of your life, 
every aspect of your freedom, then a 
judge who has no view on whether we 
have natural rights is exactly the kind 
of judge you want. 
By the way, to understand how rad-
ical her opinion is, you can look at the 
Make the Road decision. This is a deci-
sion in her court, in the district court, 
that was challenging the Trump De-
partment of Homeland Security deport-
ing people illegally in this country. 
The statute under which the Sec-
retary was removing illegal aliens ex-
plicitly gave the Secretary discretion

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1998 
April 6, 2022 
and 
said 
that 
discretion 
is 
unreviewable in Federal courts. It was 
a clear and explicit authorization and a 
removal of the authority of Federal 
courts to second-guess the policy deter-
minations. That didn’t stop Judge 
Jackson at all. She ignored the plain 
text of the statute. She issued a na-
tionwide injunction to stop the Federal 
Government 
from 
removing 
illegal 
aliens. Her decision was so extreme 
that, on appeal, it was reversed by the 
Federal Court of Appeals for the DC 
Circuit unanimously. This is a left- 
leaning court, with a majority of Dem-
ocrat appointments, and unanimously, 
the DC Circuit reversed her because she 
ignored the plain language of the stat-
ute. 
But there is no area that is more ex-
treme than Judge Jackson’s record on 
crime. This was the central focus of the 
confirmation hearing, and her record is 
far, far, far out of step with the main-
stream. 
When it comes to crime generally, 
nationally, the average for Federal 
judges sentencing criminals is 45.1 
months. That is the average sentence 
nationally. Judge Jackson’s average is 
29.9 months—33.8 percent less than the 
national average. If you are a criminal, 
you want to be in Judge Jackson’s 
court because you are going to get a 
sentence more than a third less than 
you will get in the average district 
court. That is far out of the main-
stream. 
As you know, there was considerable 
focus not just on her leniency on crimi-
nals, her leniency on violent criminals, 
her leniency on sexual predators, her 
leniency on drug dealers, but there was 
a particular focus on her very dis-
turbing record as it concerns child por-
nography. 
When it comes to child sex offenders, 
it is a truly grotesque problem we face 
in this country. I spent a number of 
years in law enforcement. As the solic-
itor general of Texas, I worked on 
many criminal cases. There were no 
cases that were more disturbing to me 
personally than the cases where people 
abused kids, where they hurt kids, the 
evil, sick predators who carry out un-
speakable acts on little children. 
I have to say, when I first heard that 
there was a concern about her record 
on child pornography, I thought, come 
on now, that can’t possibly be the case. 
Who is soft on child pornography? That 
didn’t sound plausible. Then I exam-
ined her actual record. I examined 
cases. She had roughly a dozen child 
pornography cases as a district judge. 
In every single case where she had dis-
cretion, 100 percent of the time where 
she had discretion, she sentenced the 
defendant way, way, way below the 
Federal sentencing guidelines and way, 
way, way below what the prosecutors 
recommended, the very liberal DC 
prosecutors. 
Now, when this issue was first raised, 
the Democrats responded: Well, Fed-
eral judges across the country sentence 
defendants below the sentencing guide-
lines, especially concerning child por-
nography. And that claim, insofar as it 
goes, is true. But her record is not sim-
ply sentencing below the guidelines; it 
is sentencing way, way, way below 
prosecutors. 
Then we examined, how does she sen-
tence in child pornography cases com-
pared to other Federal judges? Let’s 
compare apples to apples. When it 
comes to possession of child pornog-
raphy, the national average for all Fed-
eral judges is 68 months, a little over 5 
years. It is a serious crime with a seri-
ous prison sentence. Judge Jackson’s 
average is 29.2 months. Now, note, the 
national average sentences child porn 
offenders to a longer sentence than 
your typical crime. Judge Jackson sen-
tences child porn defendants to a short-
er sentence than your typical crime. 
When it concerns possession of child 
pornography, it is a 57-percent dif-
ference. 
But it is even more disturbing in a 
separate category, and that is distribu-
tion of child pornography. Distribution 
of child pornography, the national av-
erage is 135 months—11 years—a long 
time for a horrific crime. Judge Jack-
son’s 
average 
sentence 
was 
71.9 
months. That is a full 47 percent less 
than the national average. 
But it is even more egregious than 
that when you understand that with 
distribution of child pornography, Con-
gress has passed into law a minimum 
sentence of 60 months. So Federal 
judges have no discretion to sentence 
below 60 months. That is the bare min-
imum. When you look at that, you re-
alize that judges across the country— 
and we are not talking just Republican 
judges; 
we 
are 
talking 
Democrat 
judges: Bill Clinton judges, Barack 
Obama judges, Joe Biden judges—they 
sentence, on average, 75 months longer 
than the minimum. Judge Jackson sen-
tences on average 11.9 months longer. 
It is a consistent and disturbing pat-
tern. 
Now, why does she do this? Well, 
when you sit down and read the tran-
scripts of her sentencing hearings, 
which I have done, it is disturbing 
stuff. When you read the transcripts, 
she is very explicit that she has clear 
policy concerns. 
Under 
the 
sentencing 
guidelines, 
there is a stricter sentence for child 
pornography involving very young chil-
dren. She refuses to apply that. There 
is a sentencing enhancement for child 
pornography involving sadomasochistic 
abuse of children, children being tor-
tured. She refuses to apply that. 
If you look at what she has said, she 
said to the prosecutors—this is a quote 
from Judge Jackson at a sentencing 
hearing in United States v. Cane—she 
said, ‘‘[You are] obviously aware’’—she 
is talking to the prosecutors—‘‘[You 
are] obviously aware of my policy dis-
agreement. I just think it’s very, very 
hard to deal with number of images as 
a significant aggravator.’’ 
Now, what does this mean? There are 
two other aggravators for child pornog-
raphy. One is use of a computer, and 
the other is number of images. In case 
after case, she refuses to apply them. 
On use of a computer, she says: Well, 
at the time the guidelines were passed, 
this crime was primarily carried out 
through the mail. Now, everybody does 
it through a computer, so I am not 
going to use an enhancement for a 
computer. 
Now, I don’t agree with her on that, 
but I understand that point. That point 
is not out of the mainstream. But there 
is another aggravator, an aggravator 
up to five levels for the number of im-
ages, and over and over again, she says 
she won’t apply the number of images. 
I asked at her hearing. I said: So you 
are saying that somebody who has vid-
eos of a thousand children being sexu-
ally abused and somebody who has an 
image of one child being abused—that 
those are the same crimes, that you 
shouldn’t punish the one offender more 
than the other? 
She refused to answer that question. 
That is extreme. It is radical, and 
that is not the law. Her disagreement— 
I would note, I believe I have 25 min-
utes, and Senator THUNE extended—had 
a UC to change the time. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator has used the 25 min-
utes allotted. 
Mr. CRUZ. When it comes to Judge 
Jackson’s record, it is far out of the 
mainstream. This is a judge who, as a 
Justice—the odds are 100 percent, I be-
lieve, she will vote to strike down the 
death penalty nationwide, and she will 
rule 
repeatedly 
to 
release 
violent 
criminals, to release murderers, to re-
lease sex offenders. This is a pattern 
that is highly, highly disturbing. 
Our Democratic colleagues like to 
say they don’t support abolishing the 
police. When you nominate and con-
firm judges who let criminals out of 
jail, you have the responsibility for the 
consequences of your actions. 
Judge Jackson’s record is extreme, 
and I urge my colleagues to vote 
against her confirmation. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). The Senator from Michi-
gan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, 
first let me say, after listening to my 
colleague from Texas, if half of what he 
said I thought was accurate, I would 
not be supporting Judge Jackson. For-
tunately, it is not. So I rise today to 
urge the Senate to confirm Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson to the United 
States Supreme Court. I am so excited 
about her nomination. 
Her nomination, we know, is his-
toric—not just because Judge Jackson 
is eminently qualified for the position. 
Both 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
agree. In fact, based on her broad range 
of experience, you could argue she is 
more qualified to serve on the Supreme 
Court than any sitting judge. It is not 
just historic because of the dignified 
and honorable way she has conducted 
herself during this entire nomination 
process. If you think your last job

interview was rough, take a look at 
hers. Judge Jackson showed incredible 
grace during more than 20 hours of 
questioning that at times was incred-
ibly hostile and rude. I would challenge 
any Member of this Chamber to endure 
that level of pressure without crack-
ing. I am quite certain I couldn’t do it. 
She is eminently qualified, and we have 
seen 
her 
judicial 
temperament 
up 
close. 
What really makes Judge Jackson’s 
nomination historic is this number: 
115. One hundred and fifteen. That is 
how many U.S. Supreme Court Justices 
have served in our Nation’s entire his-
tory—115. Out of those 115 Justices, 108 
have been White males. Just think 
about it for a moment. In other words, 
nearly 94 percent of the Supreme Court 
Justices in our Nation’s history have 
been White men. That is a very exclu-
sive club. 
And like many very exclusive clubs, 
it has tended to leave a lot of folks out 
in the cold. In a country as magnifi-
cently diverse as ours, that is simply 
not right, and I am so grateful that 
President Biden understands this. 
The decisions made by the U.S. Su-
preme Court touch every single Amer-
ican. What does the right to vote truly 
mean under our Constitution? Freedom 
of religion; our freedom of speech. How 
are we as consumers or workers treated 
under our Constitution? Can a public 
school district force White students to 
attend one school while sending Black 
students to another? Can that same 
public school district refuse to educate 
students with disabilities? Can a couple 
be prevented from marrying and spend-
ing the rest of their lives caring for one 
another because they happen to be 
gay? And can a State override a wom-
an’s right to privacy and force her to 
continue a pregnancy that puts her 
own health and future at risk? 
These are some of the types of deci-
sions made by the U.S. Supreme Court 
every day. And when the Supreme 
Court doesn’t look like America, it 
means that its decisions are less likely 
to take into account the lives and the 
needs of all Americans. 
The late Justice Ruth Bader Gins-
burg had a straightforward answer 
when she was asked how many women 
should serve on the U.S. Supreme 
Court. How many was enough? ‘‘Nine,’’ 
she would say. 
Well, we are not quite there yet—but 
four? I would say that is a pretty good 
start. And a Black woman Justice? It 
is about time. It is past time. 
You may have seen a wonderful 
photo making the rounds. It is of Judge 
Jackson’s 17-year-old daughter Leila. 
It was from the first day of the nomi-
nation hearing. Leila is wearing a 
beautiful lavender suit and sitting be-
hind her mom. 
The expression on her face is abso-
lutely priceless. She is looking at her 
mom with such admiration and pride. 
Well, Leila isn’t alone. Millions of 
young Black girls and their moms and 
their grandmas are looking at Judge 
Jackson with that same pride and ad-
miration. They have never had some-
one who looks like them serving on our 
Nation’s highest Court. 
And how many of these young girls 
will see this incredibly accomplished 
woman and think, ‘‘Hey, that could be 
me’’? I hope they all do. 
I will be honored to support Judge 
Jackson’s confirmation. I am excited. I 
am proud of her. And I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. It is past time. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
NOMINATION OF JAMES C. O’BRIEN 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise today to express my support for 
the nomination of James O’Brien to be 
Coordinator of Sanctions Policy at the 
U.S. Department of State. 
At a time when we must keep the 
pressure 
on 
Putin 
to 
end 
his 
unprovoked, brutal, and illegal war 
against Ukraine, we need experienced 
officials at the helm to ensure that we 
are using every sanctions tool against 
Russia. As the power of our sanctions 
has been amplified by working closely 
with our allies and partners around the 
world, the long-term success of those 
efforts will be greatly enhanced by hav-
ing a Senate-confirmed official in place 
to ensure that those coordination ef-
forts continue and that we maximize 
the costs on Russia’s economy. 
Mr. O’Brien is exactly the type of 
leader that the Office of Sanctions Co-
ordination needs. And he brings im-
pressive substantive expertise and pro-
fessional background to this role. 
Mr. O’Brien is a former career em-
ployee of the State Department and re-
cipient 
of 
numerous 
performance 
awards. He has served two U.S. admin-
istrations as a special envoy, for Hos-
tage Affairs, and for the Balkans. Over 
the course of his career at the State 
Department, he has led a large and suc-
cessful sanctions program and advised 
on a range of issues, including peace 
negotiations in Europe, scientific and 
environmental agreements, and initia-
tives to investigate and prosecute per-
sons responsible for war crimes. 
In addition, Mr. O’Brien has nego-
tiated agreements protecting intellec-
tual property rights for scientific co-
operation with China, promoted envi-
ronmentally sound international trade 
regulations for hazardous and recycla-
ble materials, and worked to make 
public-private partnerships and cor-
porate social responsibility an impor-
tant element in American foreign pol-
icy. As the first Presidential Envoy for 
Hostage Affairs, he helped establish the 
office and worked for the safe return of 
100 American citizens. 
I have no doubt that he will bring the 
same dedication and rigor to advancing 
and coordinating U.S. sanctions policy 
as he has his prior roles. 
I strongly support confirming Mr. 
O’Brien. His confirmation will be crit-
ical to enhancing our sanctions efforts 
at this critical time. I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting his 
nomination, along with all of the for-
eign affairs nominations pending be-
fore this body, to advance our national 
security interests and improve our rep-
resentation abroad.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2000 
April 6, 2022 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak on the nomination of 
Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as an 
Associate Justice on the Supreme 
Court of the United States. 
When confirmed later this week, 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson will be 
the first Black woman on the U.S. Su-
preme Court in its 233-year history. 
Yesterday morning, I had the privi-
lege of meeting with her, and we dis-
cussed her judicial methodology as 
well as her story and her path in the 
law. Rising up to overcome so many 
barriers, Judge Jackson’s story and her 
family’s story is truly an American 
story. It is a story of hard work and 
sacrifice. It is a story of commitment 
to excellence. 
Judge Jackson’s academic creden-
tials are impressive: graduating from 
Harvard College and Harvard Law 
School with honors from both college 
and law school. 
Her unparalleled professional creden-
tials and the breadth of her legal expe-
rience equal or exceed that of any 
nominee in recent history. She has 
worked in private practice. She has 
worked as an assistant public de-
fender—Federal public defender—and 
as a law clerk at every level of the Fed-
eral judicial branch, including a law 
clerk to Justice Breyer, who is going to 
be retiring from the Court. Perhaps 
most important, she has worked as a 
Federal judge for nearly 10 years, pre-
siding over trials and later hearing ap-
peals. 
During our meeting yesterday, Judge 
Jackson spoke about her career transi-
tion from attorney to Federal judge 
and specifically highlighted how her 
career as a trial attorney helped her 
grow into becoming a Federal judge. 
Often lost in our discussions regard-
ing Federal judges are the people, the 
people who are impacted directly by 
our legal system in our judges’ deci-
sions. At its core, our court system, 
more so than any other institution, is 
dedicated to the idea that everyone— 
everyone, not just the wealthy or pow-
erful—should have a fair shot at justice 
and that no one—no one—is above the 
law. 
The Beatitudes in the New Testa-
ment speak to this idea of justice. We 
have all heard it over and over again: 
Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for 
justice, for they shall be satisfied. 
The power—the power—of our judi-
cial system and our judiciary stems 
from the integrity and the independ-
ence of our judges. It stems from their 
unrelenting commitment to the rule of 
law and to equal justice for all Ameri-
cans. 
Throughout her career but particu-
larly as a public defender—a Federal 
public defender—Judge Jackson has 
fought for a more equitable and a more 
just America, representing individuals 
accused of committing crimes and 
those who cannot afford a lawyer. All 
of those cases are difficult cases for 
any lawyer. The lawyer must be com-
mitted to upholding a core American 
value that our legal system must pro-
tect all Americans, including defend-
ants, to ensure ‘‘Equal Justice Under 
Law,’’ as is inscribed on the front of 
the Supreme Court itself. 
Judge Jackson has lived this com-
mitment to justice, to equal justice. 
She understands the awesome power 
that will be bestowed upon her as a Su-
preme Court Justice. She has seen 
firsthand the impact that a judge’s de-
cision can have on plaintiffs and de-
fendants alike. It is why Judge Jack-
son has discussed how, when she was a 
district judge, she would often take 
extra care to communicate with de-
fendants in her courtroom to ensure 
that they understood the complexities 
of the legal proceedings happening be-
fore them. For when a defendant is be-
fore the bar of justice, their liberty is 
at stake, and Judge Jackson wanted to 
make sure that they understood what 
was happening before them and what 
could happen to them. 
Her commitment to equal justice is 
also evident by her impartial rulings 
and the widespread support she has re-
ceived from across the political spec-
trum. 
As a district court judge and as a cir-
cuit court judge, Judge Jackson has 
ruled for and against the government, 
in favor of prosecutors and for criminal 
defendants, for labor and for business, 
for civil plaintiffs and defendants. 
Her nomination received the support 
from several Republican Senators, Re-
publican-appointed judges, and former 
Republican-appointed officials. 
She received broad support from law 
enforcement organizations, including 
the Fraternal Order of Police, the 
International Association of Chiefs of 
Police, and other top law enforcement 
officials, including former Philadelphia 
Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey, 
as well as crime survivors, and other 
advocates. 
Her nomination has received further 
support from civil rights organizations 
as well as business organizations. 
Of course, Judge Jackson’s nomina-
tion is about more than simply the 
great support that she has received and 
her impeccable credentials. Both are 
important, but that is not it. 
Yesterday morning, after my meet-
ing with Judge Jackson, she was kind 
enough to meet with several members 
of my staff who have graduated from 
law school or who are getting ready to 
apply to law school, some of whom 
have been accepted. She offered some 
salient advice about law school. I won’t 
disclose what it was here, but it was 
good advice. And she encouraged them 
to keep going, to persevere. 
Now, Judge Jackson is already today, 
and has been for weeks and months 
now, an inspiration to tens of millions 
of Americans. Her graciousness, her 
humility, and her legal acumen are 
simply unmatched. Her confirmation 
to the Supreme Court will also inspire 
many future generations, those yet to 
come and not simply future lawyers 
and advocates. And certainly and par-
ticularly, her nomination and her con-
firmation will be particularly inspiring 
to young Black women and girls to per-
severe, as she said to our staff yester-
day. 
The day of her confirmation will be a 
good day for America. She lifts our 
spirits at a very difficult time for our 
Nation. And while we have a long way 
to go, Judge Jackson’s nomination is 
an important step to bringing us closer 
to having our institutions better re-
flect the great diversity of our Nation 
as we strive to be a more perfect 
Union. 
I will go back to the Beatitudes 
again. ‘‘Blessed are they who hunger 
and thirst for justice, for they shall be 
satisfied.’’ Judge Jackson, I have no 
doubt, will continue her work to strive 
for justice, to act with justice, as one 
of the great hymns tells us. She will do 
all of this as she discharges her duty as 
Justice Jackson. 
I look forward to voting for her to 
serve as an Associate Justice on the 
Supreme Court of the United States of 
America. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise today in strong support of Judge 
Jackson to be the 116th Justice of the 
Supreme Court of the United States. 
As a Senator, one of the most impor-
tant responsibilities I have under the 
Constitution is whether to provide my 
consent to a President’s nomination to 
the Supreme Court, the highest Court 
in our land. 
The Framers carefully designed our 
Constitution using an intricate system 
of checks and balances. The Framers 
designed the third branch of govern-
ment, the judiciary, to be an inde-
pendent branch from the political 
branches of government: the legisla-
ture and the executive branch. 
Judges were given the unusual pro-
tection—unlike Congress and the Presi-
dent—to have lifetime tenure and to 
hold their offices during good behavior. 
Judges, therefore, do not have to fear 
retribution or loss of their office or 
diminution of their paycheck if they 
make an unpopular decision. 
So while the Supreme Court must 
show a healthy respect for the other 
coequal branches of government, it 
must, at the same time, preserve its 
own independence and ultimately in-
terpret the laws and Constitution of 
the United States. A critical part of 
the Supreme Court’s role is to preserve 
and protect the Constitution and to 
make sure that all Americans are 
treated equally under the law. 
The marble entrance of the Supreme 
Court has etched above it the promise 
of equal justice under the law for all 
persons who enter. The Supreme Court 
must vigorously uphold the civil rights 
and civil liberties of all Americans and 
pay special attention to safeguarding 
and enforcing the constitutional rights

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2001 
April 6, 2022 
guaranteed in our system of govern-
ment. 
As we know from our history, the Su-
preme Court has not always protected 
all Americans and, indeed, in the past 
has treated some Americans as less 
equal than others, simply due to their 
race, religion, or gender, among other 
factors. So let us remember the pre-
amble to the Constitution, which de-
clares that ‘‘We the People of the 
United States, in Order to form a more 
perfect Union, establish Justice’’—it is 
certainly not a perfect union, but I do 
believe in the words of Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., that ‘‘the arc of the 
moral universe is long, but it bends to-
ward justice.’’ 
Americans know that the Supreme 
Court makes profound decisions every 
day that impact the lives of people 
across this country. The Supreme 
Court regularly tackles so many of the 
controversial issues of the day that in-
volve issues such as voting rights, 
criminal justice, labor law rights, envi-
ronmental protection, and many, many 
more. 
Turning now specifically to Judge 
Jackson’s nomination, she would re-
place Justice Stephen Breyer on the 
Court, who, fittingly, she had clerked 
for after graduating from law school. 
Judge Jackson has an extremely im-
pressive background and legal creden-
tials and now sits as a judge on the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District 
of Columbia Circuit, often called the 
Nation’s second highest court. 
The 
American 
Bar 
Association’s 
Standing Committee on the Federal 
Judiciary gave Judge Jackson a unani-
mously ‘‘Well Qualified’’ rating for the 
Supreme Court, which is its highest 
rating. The committee notes that to 
receive this highest rating: 
A Supreme Court nominee must be a pre-
eminent member of the legal profession, 
have outstanding legal ability and excep-
tional breadth of experience, and meet the 
very highest standards of integrity, profes-
sional competence and judicial tempera-
ment. 
Judge Jackson passed all these tests 
with flying colors during her Senate 
confirmation process. 
I had the privilege of chairing Judge 
Jackson’s first Senate confirmation 
hearing in 2009, when President Obama 
nominated her to serve on the U.S. 
Sentencing Commission. I then had the 
opportunity to visit with Judge Jack-
son earlier this month, prior to her 
confirmation hearing. It was a real 
pleasure to speak with her. I am famil-
iar with her background and many of 
her rulings. She is also a former Mary-
land resident. We had much to talk 
about, as she had many connections to 
my State. 
Her brother served both as an infan-
tryman and officer in the Maryland 
Army National Guard, during which he 
was twice deployed overseas; and he 
also served as an undercover narcotics 
recovery officer in the Baltimore City 
Police Department. 
Judge Jackson is eminently quali-
fied. In our meeting, we talked about 
her personal experience and her com-
mitment to equal justice under the 
law, especially for those who have had 
difficulty accessing our legal system. 
She discussed her work as a public de-
fender and providing defense free of 
charge to the most vulnerable members 
of our society. In this work, Judge 
Jackson carried out the mandate of the 
Sixth Amendment of the Constitution, 
which provides that: 
In all criminal prosecutions, the accused 
shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public 
trial . . . and to have the Assistance of Coun-
sel for his defence. 
She talked about her outreach to our 
next generation, in terms of talking to 
students in high school and college, as 
well as our next generation of lawyers 
in law school. I am often reminded of 
the words of my dear friend, the late 
Congressman Elijah Cummings of Bal-
timore, that ‘‘our children are the liv-
ing messages we send to a future we 
will never see.’’ 
I do think Judge Jackson is having 
an important and ongoing conversation 
about democracy with our students. I 
frankly think she will be a powerful 
role model for so many who will follow 
in her footsteps—in particular, women 
and women of color who see Judge 
Jackson break yet another barrier and 
glass ceiling at the Supreme Court. 
These students can believe that, yes, 
they belong even in the highest Court 
in the land and the most elite corridors 
of power in our Nation’s Capital. 
We discussed the importance of an 
independent judicial branch of govern-
ment and protecting the rights of indi-
viduals against powerful special inter-
ests that would abuse their power. I 
was impressed with Judge Jackson 
throughout our conversation. 
Judge Jackson exemplifies the Amer-
ican story and experience. Her parents 
were public schoolteachers, and Judge 
Jackson said she was inspired to go 
into law by watching her father study 
when he was in law school. Raised in 
Miami, FL, she attended Florida public 
schools. She then went on to earn her 
BA magna cum laude from Harvard 
University and, later, her JD cum 
laude from Harvard Law School. 
She went on to clerk for three dif-
ferent Federal judges: Judge Patti 
Saris in the District of Massachusetts, 
Judge Bruce Selya of the First Circuit 
Court of Appeals, and then Justice Ste-
phen Breyer on the Supreme Court of 
the United States. 
After working in private practice, 
she joined the U.S. Sentencing Com-
mission as an assistant special counsel 
before serving as an assistant Federal 
public defender in Washington. Judge 
Jackson then returned to private prac-
tice again before being nominated in 
2009 by President Obama to serve as a 
commissioner and, later, vice chair of 
the U.S. Sentencing Commission. 
As I noted earlier, I had the privilege 
to chair this confirmation hearing for 
Judge Jackson, after which she was 
unanimously confirmed by voice vote 
in the Senate in 2010. In this role, I 
noted that Judge Jackson often worked 
to find common ground with her fellow 
commissioners, who brought very dif-
ferent backgrounds and perspectives to 
the Commission. In particular, Judge 
Jackson made significant strides to 
make our criminal justice system and 
sentencing policy more fair and just. 
For example, she worked on a bipar-
tisan basis to effectively implement 
the Fair Sentencing Act, which ad-
dressed the 100-to-1 disparity in the law 
regarding crack cocaine and powder co-
caine, which had led to dispropor-
tionate and discriminatory treatment 
of minorities in our criminal justice 
system. 
I am hopeful that Judge Jackson can 
use these same skills of finding com-
mon ground with individuals from dif-
ferent backgrounds and build a con-
sensus as a Justice on the Supreme 
Court. 
In 2013, President Obama nominated 
Judge Jackson to serve as the U.S. dis-
trict judge for the District of Colum-
bia, and again, the Senate unanimously 
confirmed her nomination by voice 
vote. As a district court judge, Judge 
Jackson wrote more than 500 opinions 
and considered a wide array of issues 
that would come before the Supreme 
Court. She has a real breadth of experi-
ence here, including cases involving 
constitutional, civil rights, and na-
tional security issues; administrative 
issues involving Federal Agencies; en-
vironmental issues; criminal law and 
procedure issues; and matters involv-
ing government transparency. 
On the bench, her record clearly dem-
onstrates that Judge Jackson impar-
tially applies the law and precedent to 
the facts in a fair and impartial man-
ner, regardless of her own personal 
views on the subject. Judge Jackson 
took special care to make sure the par-
ties before her understood her approach 
to deciding cases, and she issued clear-
ly reasoned decisions. 
As Judge Jackson said in her con-
firmation hearing for the district court 
circuit, When I worked with clients as 
a defender, ‘‘[m]ost of my clients didn’t 
really understand what had happened 
to them. [N]o one really explained to 
them what they were supposed to ex-
pect, so they did not know where 
things might have gone wrong.’’ 
Therefore, as a judge, Judge Jackson 
said that she will ‘‘take extra time to 
communicate with’’ the parties. ‘‘I 
speak to them directly and not just to 
their lawyers. I use their names. I ex-
plain every stage of the proceeding be-
cause I want them to know what is 
going on.’’ 
In reviewing her record, I notice that 
Judge Jackson’s analysis and decision 
making have led her to rule both for 
and against the government in dif-
ferent cases, both for and against em-
ployers and workers, for and against 
criminal defendants and prosecutors, 
based on the merits of the case and her 
application of the law to the facts of 
that particular case. 
In her confirmation hearing and writ-
ten answers to questions for the record,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2002 
April 6, 2022 
Judge Jackson pledged to support and 
defend the Constitution and further 
pledged to rule without fear or favor or 
prejudice or passion, consistent with 
her judicial oath. She indicated she un-
derstood the limits of the judicial role 
and the importance of adhering to 
precedents of the Court. 
Just last year, President Biden ele-
vated Judge Jackson to the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit. The Senate confirmed Judge 
Jackson to this position by a bipar-
tisan vote of 53 voting in favor in an 
evenly divided Senate. 
In that confirmation hearing, Judge 
Jackson again stressed the importance 
of courts having ‘‘a duty of independ-
ence from political pressure, meaning 
that judges must resolve cases and con-
troversies in a manner that is con-
sistent with what the law requires, de-
spite the judge’s own personal views of 
the matter, and this is so even with re-
spect to cases and controversies that 
pertain 
to 
controversial 
political 
issues.’’ She is committed to carrying 
out her oath as a judge. 
She particularly noted that she did 
not pay attention to who was in the ad-
ministration when ruling on cases, 
which is consistent with her case 
record, ruling both for and against the 
Trump 
administration 
in 
different 
cases. 
Judge Jackson did a superb job dur-
ing the recent confirmation hearings, 
as our Presiding Officer knows, and 
consistently impressed me with her 
talents. Not only was she eminently 
qualified—we already knew about her 
outstanding qualifications; not only 
was she in command of all the legal 
subjects—we knew that she would excel 
in discussing the law and her job as a 
judge; but her demeanor in the face of 
repeated and often outrageous assaults 
by Republican Members of the Senate 
truly set her apart. She maintained her 
judicial temperament throughout this 
week’s hearing and showed why she 
will be a major factor on the Supreme 
Court. Judge Jackson’s confirmation 
hearing reinforced to me how critical 
it will be to have her on the Supreme 
Court. 
Members of the committee unsuc-
cessfully tried to distort Judge Jack-
son’s sentencing record. The record 
clearly rebuts these charges, as Judge 
Jackson’s sentences are well within the 
judicial mainstream, and Judge Jack-
son often followed the recommenda-
tions made by the probation office. 
The ABA Standing Committee de-
bunked several of these myths when 
they analyzed Judge Jackson’s record 
as part of their review process before 
her confirmation hearing. 
The ABA testified at the hearing: 
We did speak to various prosecutors and 
defense counsels for Judge Jackson. . . . 
None of them felt that she demonstrated bias 
in any way. . . . One prosecutor said, ‘‘I did 
not observe any bias, and the Judge was fair 
to all sides in connection with sentencing in 
all aspects.’’ . . . We asked pointed questions 
as it related to bias—whether it be to defend-
ants, whether it be to the government, and 
we found no bias. 
That was the ABA. 
In terms of the allegations that 
Judge Jackson is ‘‘soft on crime,’’ the 
ABA testified: 
We heard consistently, from not only de-
fense counsel but prosecutors, how unbiased 
Judge Jackson is. We heard phrases like 
‘‘doing things by the books.’’ For example, 
one prosecutor described the sentencing 
hearing involving a very high profile, sen-
sitive national security matter. What she 
said was, it was classic Judge Jackson. . . . 
What really impressed this prosecutor was 
that after oral argument, Judge Jackson 
took a recess, went back to [her] chambers, 
and when she resumed the bench, came out 
with a sentence that was more in favor of 
the government. What more impressed the 
prosecutor was that the Judge’s ruling in-
cluded arguments that had been made both 
by the defense and [the] prosecutors during 
oral arguments. It is not as if she came into 
the hearing with her mind made up. She lis-
tened to what counsel on both sides said and 
came up with a sentence that the prosecu-
tion was quite happy with. 
Several prominent law enforcement 
organizations support Judge Jackson’s 
nomination. 
The Fraternal Order of Police wrote: 
From our analysis of Judge Jackson’s 
record and some of her cases, we believe she 
has considered the facts and applied the law 
consistently and fairly on a range of issues. 
There is little doubt that she has the tem-
perament, intellect, legal experience, and 
family background to have earned this ap-
pointment. We are reassured that, should she 
be confirmed, she would approach her future 
cases with an open mind and treat issues re-
lated to law enforcement fairly and justly. 
The 
International 
Association 
of 
Chiefs of Police supports Judge Jack-
son’s nomination. They wrote: 
[W]hen the IACP chooses to support an in-
dividual, we do not take it lightly, and [we] 
take into careful consideration their back-
ground, experience, and previous opinions 
issued as they relate to law enforcement and 
criminal justice issues. . . . During her time 
as a judge, she has displayed her dedication 
to ensuring that our communities are safe 
and that the interests of justice are served. 
We believe that Judge Jackson’s years of ex-
perience have shown she has the tempera-
ment and qualifications to serve as the next 
Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. 
That was the International Associa-
tion of Chiefs of Police. 
Judge Jackson has an unusually 
broad range of support from law en-
forcement groups, crime victims and 
survivors, business associations, and 
civil rights groups. 
Former DC Circuit Judge Thomas 
Griffith introduced Judge Jackson at 
her confirmation hearing. Judge Grif-
fith, a President George W. Bush ap-
pointee, vouched for Judge Jackson’s 
‘‘careful approach, extraordinary judi-
cial understanding, and collegial man-
ner. . . . Judge Jackson has a dem-
onstrated record of excellence, and I 
believe, based upon her work as a trial 
judge when I served on the Court of Ap-
peals, that she will adjudicate based on 
the facts and the law and not [in a] 
partisan [manner]. 
Former Fourth Circuit Judge Mi-
chael Luttig, a President George H. W. 
Bush appointee who recently advised 
Vice President Pence, offered a similar 
endorsement when he wrote that she is 
‘‘eminently qualified to serve on the 
Supreme Court’’ and is ‘‘as highly 
credentialed and experienced in the law 
as any nominee in [recent] history.’’ 
Her colleagues have given her the 
highest ratings. Those who know her 
best, those who have worked with her, 
give us all great confidence in her 
qualifications and ability to serve on 
the Supreme Court. 
A group of conservative lawyers— 
many of whom served in previous Re-
publican 
administrations—wrote 
in 
strong support of Judge Jackson and 
said: 
While some of us might differ concerning 
particular positions she has taken as a judge, 
we are united in our view that she is excep-
tionally well-qualified, given her breadth of 
experience, demonstrated ability, and per-
sonal attributes of intellect and character. 
Indeed, we think that her confirmation on a 
consensus basis would strengthen the Court 
and the nation in important ways. 
It is long past time for the Supreme 
Court to seat a highly qualified, Black, 
female attorney as a member. As we 
strive to provide equal justice under 
the law to all Americans, she would be 
only the sixth woman out of 116 Jus-
tices to serve on the Supreme Court 
and only the second woman of color 
and the first Black woman. A Justice 
Jackson will bring sorely needed diver-
sity to the Supreme Court, both demo-
graphically and professionally. 
The Leadership Conference on Civil 
and Human Rights noted: 
This professional diversity is another crit-
ical step in ensuring our courts look more 
like America. Judge Jackson will be the first 
justice with any significant criminal defense 
experience since the retirement of Justice 
Thurgood Marshall in 1991, and she would be 
the only Supreme Court justice to have 
served as a public defender. Public defenders 
play a [critical] role in our legal system, yet 
they are vastly underrepresented on the fed-
eral bench. At all levels of our judiciary, 
there are nearly six times as many former 
prosecutors on the federal bench than former 
criminal defense lawyers, and just over 5 per-
cent of federal appellate judges have experi-
ence as a public defender. . . . Our highest 
court should reflect the diversity of the legal 
profession, and Judge Jackson’s meaningful 
experience is greatly needed on our Supreme 
Court. 
I believe that Judge Jackson will 
faithfully uphold her judicial oath, 
which contains a special provision 
whereby judges promise to ‘‘administer 
justice without respect to persons, and 
do equal right to the poor and the 
rich.’’ I believe she respects the separa-
tion of powers and checks and balances 
in our system and that she is com-
mitted to uphold the civil rights and 
civil liberties of all Americans. 
I will proudly vote to confirm Judge 
Jackson so she will become Justice 
Jackson. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2003 
April 6, 2022 
every day, and that is our supply chain 
shortage as it relates to semiconduc-
tors, or abbreviated here as ‘‘chips.’’ 
I can’t emphasize how important this 
issue is to Americans. It is affecting 
Americans who can’t buy a used car. 
There is a 41-percent increase over 
what they would have normally been 
able to buy. It is really impacting 
Americans. Why? Because Americans 
can’t get new cars. They can’t get new 
cars because they don’t have semi-
conductors. It is impacting our trans-
portation sector that ships goods. It is 
affecting our ability on national secu-
rity. It is affecting our communication 
systems. 
I know that a year ago, we passed 
this legislation out of the Senate. I am 
pretty sure that if we would have 
passed the funding a year ago out of 
the U.S. Senate and it would have been 
adopted and gone to the President’s 
desk, we would be in a different supply 
chain issue today. 
I want to ask my colleagues to move 
quickly at going to conference on this 
legislation. Reporting indicates that 
semiconductor 
shortages may have 
cost the United States a full percent of 
economic input-output in 2021. Other 
reports highlight the fact that the 
semiconductor shortage is driving in-
flation. Yet our colleagues don’t want 
to help get us to conference. When you 
don’t have chips, you don’t have trucks 
to drive. 
We have an opportunity to invest in 
American workers and to show inter-
national leadership and innovation by 
going to conference and passing this 
Innovation and Competition Act. 
I want to thank Senator SCHUMER 
and Senator YOUNG for their work in a 
bipartisan fashion to get this legisla-
tion before us, to help us move it 
through the process, and now to help us 
deliver on what is impacting Ameri-
cans—critical supply chain shortages. 
My colleagues have long spoken 
about the need to reshore our semicon-
ductor supply chain. That is why, when 
we passed this bill a year ago, we had 
strong bipartisan support, and we have 
continued to grow the support for this 
action. 
We are here today, though, to say 
that if we continue to delay this issue, 
the investment is going to go some-
where else; that is, companies are try-
ing to figure out how to deal with the 
shortage. They have a shortage; they 
want to get going on it. They know 
that not only is the shortage here 
today, but we have to double and triple 
the amount of chip fabrication that we 
need to do for the future economy. The 
longer that we don’t get at that task, 
the more this supply chain issue is 
going to be exacerbated. So our col-
leagues need to sign up for helping 
America with a critical supply chain 
shortage issue and come help us deal 
with this issue. 
I have spoken many times about the 
importance 
of 
semiconductors. 
We 
know that the cost of a used car has 
risen 41 percent since the semicon-
ductor shortage, bringing them almost 
to the price of a new car. I have heard 
so many stories from my constituents 
about this. They just need to get to 
work. But all of a sudden, going and 
trying to find a used car or repair their 
car because they can’t afford to get a 
new or a used car—all of this has had a 
huge impact. Yet people here don’t 
want to solve that problem of moving 
forward. 
The lack of security in the semicon-
ductor supply chain isn’t just affecting 
automotive industries; it is part of 
critical agricultural equipment. We are 
hearing stories now about agricultural 
equipment that had a chip in it, some-
thing has happened, and now you can’t 
fix or replace that because there are no 
chips to do so. So, literally, our agri-
cultural production is being slowed 
down, and they may miss growing sea-
son because they don’t have the semi-
conductors. 
All of these industries are being im-
pacted. 
In December of this past year, 59 dif-
ferent company CEOs—Apple, Cisco, 
Ford, GE Healthcare, and many oth-
ers—wrote to Congress saying that 
they supported this important invest-
ment in design and research of manu-
facturing of semiconductors, and they 
pointed to the domestic vulnerability 
of our supply chain as the main reason 
to get this done. They knew that our 
domestic capabilities were sagging. 
Companies like John Deere and other 
precision agriculture equipment com-
panies depend on those chips to maxi-
mize the yield in the field so that our 
farmers can be fed. 
Chip shortages create delays of 40 
weeks or more for new equipment and 
parts needed to repair those of farmers 
and ranchers and those working in our 
important agriculture sector. 
About two-thirds of the medical tech-
nology companies have semiconductors 
in over half of their products, like ven-
tilators, respirators, and pacemakers. 
These medtech companies need mature 
chip technologies and compete with al-
ready impacted automotive and indus-
trial sectors. They know what the 
shortage is about, and yet we continue 
to delay to go to conference. 
If you care about anything in the 
supply chain and the shortages, then 
help us go to conference and get this 
legislation. Medical tech component 
delays of 1 year or more have been re-
ported. Knowing the hard-fought expe-
riences of the pandemic, we need to 
have this issue with our healthcare 
system addressed. 
Early on in the pandemic, the avia-
tion industry avoided supply chain ex-
periences that we now see with the 
autos, and they know how much the 
safety depends on those chips. But now 
airlines are having to upgrade and 
modernize, and they also are seeing the 
chip shortage. This is coming from lots 
of different people in the aviation sec-
tor. 
Space X Starlink, which is a satellite 
internet service provider, is trying to 
provide internet service to underserved 
areas and beneficiaries of some of the 
investments that we just made in 
broadband to the very, very hard-to- 
serve remote areas of our Nation. They 
say that the semiconductor chip short-
age had impacted their ability to fulfill 
orders. 
What more do my colleagues need to 
know? 
We have a supply chain crisis. We 
have a chip shortage. And now people 
want to continue to delay going to con-
ference and getting this done. 
The aerospace and defense industries 
are important to our national defense, 
and they are impacted. In February, 
the Department of Defense published a 
report on our vulnerabilities. They 
said: 
[The] decline in domestic manufacturing 
represents a substantive security and eco-
nomic threat for the United States and many 
[of our] allied nations. 
And yet people want to delay. 
They also said that U.S. companies 
are finding it so expensive to build 
leading-edge chips that they are choos-
ing not to do so, especially in face of 
the fact they can get foreign subsidies. 
It is 30 or 40 percent cheaper to build a 
semiconductor fabrication facility in 
Asia than it is in the United States. 
And this is one of the things, I think, 
our colleagues don’t understand; that 
is, how expensive these facilities are, 
in the billions of dollars to get done, in 
the capital investment. 
And I know some of my colleagues 
are concerned that ‘‘Why should we 
help in this supply chain crisis?’’ Well, 
we know that the United States wants 
to be a leader in this technology for 
our own national security issues. As 
one of my own constituents said, ‘‘if 
there is a reason we support agri-
culture for food security, we should 
support chips for national security.’’ I 
couldn’t agree more. 
I am not going to see the most ad-
vanced chips made by somebody else, 
threatening us at some point in time 
that they won’t give us the chips that 
we need for the operations of our econ-
omy. We need to build this equipment 
now, and we need to move forward. 
American companies know that semi-
conductor supply chains are vital and 
that reshoring in the United States 
now—as we look at how supply chains 
due to COVID, now due to Ukraine— 
have caused national security issues. 
So these companies understand that 
being more secure by having the supply 
chain in the United States should be a 
national priority. 
It should have strong bipartisan sup-
port. We have companies trying to in-
vest, but they also are saying: Is this 
legislation really going to get done? 
The fact that it was basically passed 
out of the Senate and now we are de-
laying in tactics to go to conference is 
frustrating. 
Earlier this year, Intel announced 
they were investing $20 billion in Ohio 
to build semiconductor fabrication fa-
cilities. The CEO of Intel testified be-
fore the Commerce Committee about

the importance of this investment and 
the importance of this underlying pas-
sage of legislation. 
He testified that this investment of 
$20 billion could soon become as big as 
$100 billion, but not if we don’t pass 
this legislation. 
GlobalFoundries announced that it 
would invest billions of dollars in semi-
conductor manufacturing equipment in 
places in the northeast part of the 
United States, but they too are contin-
gent upon us passing this legislation. 
When I think about the workforce 
that is going to be needed to produce 
this kind of product or the workforce 
that is going to be needed in cleaner 
sources of energy, I know that passing 
this legislation is key to getting the 
training and skilling of that workforce 
underway, right now, as soon as pos-
sible. 
There is one reason that Apple, one 
of the largest sellers of smart phones in 
the world, announced last year that 
they would have to bring back some of 
their production to the United States. 
It is because the government worked to 
bring leading-edge semiconductor man-
ufacturing into Arizona. 
This is about securing leadership in 
innovation. It is about this ‘‘ah-ha’’ 
moment that everybody around the 
world has seen, because of COVID and 
Ukraine, that the security of doing this 
needs to be done now and invested in 
the United States. 
But some people are still dragging 
their feet. Congress needs to act now 
and act swiftly to go to conference, to 
reconcile these differences, and support 
this supply chain crisis that is affect-
ing our economy. 
Every day that we wait, our compa-
nies, our manufacturers, our univer-
sities, our workforce are questioning 
whether we are going to invest in the 
United States of America. The CEO of 
Intel told us that Europe has put $49 
billion in a chips package, and they 
had the money available before we had 
our legislation done. That is right. 
People listened to this issue of bring-
ing, for more secure reasons, invest-
ment out of Asia and back to the 
United States, but, yes, Europe lis-
tened and went and got the money and 
got the bill done. That is why some 
people have said: We are not going to 
be buying chips in U.S. dollars. We will 
be buying them in euros. 
This is so important. We must get 
this legislation done. Companies may 
test their ideas in Europe. Maybe the 
R&D is in Europe. But is that what we 
want? We want to be the leaders of 
this. There is an entire ecosystem in an 
information age that is about the next 
generation of advanced chips that leads 
to the next advanced manufacturing. 
If you want our auto makers, if you 
want our truck makers, if you want the 
communications technology and the 
defense people to also have that eco-
system, you have to send this price sig-
nal now—that the Congress, the House 
and Senate, are serious about resolving 
this issue. 
This is not a summertime issue. It is 
not 
an 
after-the-November-election 
issue. It is a now issue. Show the Amer-
ican consumer that you have concern 
for their costs and shortages that are 
plaguing them in all aspects of their 
lives and get an agreement, and let’s go 
to conference and show Americans that 
we can work on a bipartisan basis to 
address the supply chain crisis. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The Senator from Min-
nesota. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today on two very 
important subjects. The first is about 
an issue that is of vital importance for 
the United States across economic, se-
curity, and humanitarian spheres, and 
that is vaccinating the world’s popu-
lation. 
I think we all have learned in a very 
hard, hard way the last 2 years that the 
coronavirus does not respect inter-
national borders. It started in China. It 
came to America. It went all over the 
world. 
Experts 
have 
been 
warning 
for 
months that if the virus continues to 
spread in other parts of the world, new 
variants could continue to emerge, just 
as we are emerging and seeing each 
other again and going to family gath-
erings and having people and tour 
groups come into the Capitol. We can-
not let our guard down. 
American companies have worked 
with the world to create the most ef-
fective vaccines in existence. We put 
our faith in science, and now we have 
an incredible vaccine that we can be 
proud of. And as we continue to ensure 
that Americans get their shots and 
their boosters, we know that ending 
this pandemic is going to require a sus-
tained, multinational approach to get-
ting these lifesaving shots to the rest 
of the world. 
This makes sense from a humani-
tarian perspective, it makes sense from 
an economic perspective, and it is just 
common sense, because we can’t let 
this happen again, and we certainly 
can’t put our heads in the sand and pre-
tend that, just because it is going on in 
another continent or across the ocean, 
it won’t affect us. 
For those in America who have lost 
loved ones, that couldn’t even say 
goodbye to their loved ones, because 
they were in a hospital, holding the 
hand of a nurse, and all they could do 
was see them in the hospital bed over a 
Zoom screen or on an iPad, we can’t let 
any of that happen again. And that 
means that we not only do our work at 
home and get the vaccines out and the 
leadership that we have seen out of the 
White House on that front, but it is 
also about leading in the world. 
The United States has long been a 
leader 
in 
global 
health 
programs. 
President George W. Bush established 
PEPFAR, which stands for President’s 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. That 
program saved over 20 million lives and 
prevented millions of infections. It was 
a bipartisan effort that was led by 
President Bush. 
The United States has also connected 
global towns and villages with clean 
water, thought to prevent malaria, and 
led efforts to end smallpox and polio 
around the world. This is our legacy, 
but we can’t rest on our success and 
the leadership from the past. We have 
to lead now. 
At this point, only about 56 percent 
of the world’s population is fully vac-
cinated. In nations around the world, 
the individual rate is much lower. In 
Nigeria, Africa’s most populous coun-
try, only 5 percent of people are fully 
vaccinated. Few people would disagree 
with the assessment that new variants 
will continue to form—ask Dr. Fauci— 
as long as much of the world remains 
unvaccinated, and that makes every 
nation vulnerable, including ours. 
And we can do this at such a rel-
atively small cost to what the gain will 
be—the gain in saving lives abroad and 
in America, the gain in keeping a sta-
ble economy around the world, because 
you know we export to the world, and 
we know we are interconnected with 
the world. 
So when it comes to beating this 
virus, we have to recognize that our 
destiny is linked with the rest of the 
world. We can’t give up this fight. Now 
is not the time to cut corners. We have 
suffered enough through this virus, and 
we have the needed tools to vaccinate a 
global population. We have the vac-
cine. We just have to get it to the peo-
ple that need it. 
I will keep fighting to get the re-
sources to get this done. We will work 
with our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle until we get this done and 
vaccinate the world. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. President, a second important 
topic is in front of us right now, and 
that is Judge Jackson’s nomination to 
be an Associate Justice of the Supreme 
Court. I enthusiastically support the 
nomination of Judge Jackson. I sup-
ported it at a recent committee hear-
ing and in our committee vote on Mon-
day. As a member of the Senate Judici-
ary Committee, I have had the oppor-
tunity to spend a lot of time with the 
judge, in my office for nearly an hour 
and then watching her persevere—that 
is a good word—through 2 full days of 
questions. And I know that she is going 
to be confirmed by the Senate. And, by 
the way, I appreciate the support of 
every Democrat for her nomination, as 
well as of Senators COLLINS and MUR-
KOWSKI and ROMNEY. 
She showed the American people why 
she is the person to meet this moment 
in our country’s history. She is some-
one that showed such grace under pres-
sure, as so many people have had to do, 
by the way, in the last 2 years. She 
showed herself to be a true person, 
someone that when asked about how 
you balanced work with being a mom, 
she said: We are not all perfect. I can’t 
do everything all the time, but I try 
my best, and I love my kids.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2005 
April 6, 2022 
And she clearly is a shining example 
of a good mother. She talked about her 
faith. Even under direct, over-the-top 
questioning by our colleagues, she kept 
true to her faith and to her values and 
to her view of a judge, which is to take 
the facts and the law and make a deci-
sion without fear or favor. She showed 
the American people why she is the 
person to meet this moment as the 
first Black woman nominated to the 
Court and only the sixth woman in the 
history of our country. 
One hundred fifteen Justices—she is 
the sixth woman. She will open a door 
that has been long shut for so many, 
and she will do it by virtue of her 
strong presence, her skills, and her ex-
perience. She will show little girls and 
boys across the country that every-
thing is possible. 
She was already an inspiration to one 
11-year-old girl by the name of Maddi 
Morgan. I met Maddi’s dad when I was 
on a walk in Washington, DC. He 
parked his car, sprung out of his car, 
and showed me the letter that his 
daughter had written President Biden 
when President Biden announced that 
he was going to make a nomination but 
didn’t reveal who it was and was inter-
viewing candidates. 
Maddi, his 11-year-old, decided that 
she would be appropriate for the job. 
She noted that she would live many 
more years and so, therefore, would be 
the longest serving Justice in history. 
She noted that she could be a voice for 
kids. She also noted that she lived very 
close to the courthouse, and she could 
walk to work all the time. 
And then when Judge Jackson was 
announced by President Biden as the 
nominee, Maddi said this: 
If I’m going to be snubbed, it couldn’t be 
for a better candidate. 
So that little 11-year-old girl was sit-
ting in the hearing room watching as a 
woman who is truly an inspiration to 
her, Judge Jackson, answered question 
after question. 
And by the way, I am not surprised 
at some of our Republican colleagues 
either supporting Judge Jackson or 
voicing their belief that she is a quali-
fied person and a smart person and 
someone who deserves to be nominated, 
even if they, for other reasons, aren’t 
voting for her. I think they are pretty 
consistent in saying, with the Amer-
ican public, that Judge Jackson is 
qualified. 
In fact, two-thirds of Americans, ac-
cording to one recent poll, say Judge 
Jackson should be confirmed. 
As we learned during the hearing, 
Judge Jackson grew up in a family who 
values public service. Her parents, 
whom I had the chance to meet, start-
ed their careers as teachers. And when 
Judge Jackson’s dad set his sights on 
becoming a lawyer, her mom figured 
out how to support the family while he 
attended law school. 
As a lawyer, she balanced work with 
parenthood. 
I 
appreciated 
hearing 
about how Judge Jackson would sit 
with her dad while he was studying the 
law books and she was doing a coloring 
book. 
She, as someone who has been a Fed-
eral public defender—the first with 
that experience who will be in the 
room where it happens—but also hav-
ing many relatives in law enforcement 
has a unique perspective of the law and 
a very important respect for people in 
law enforcement. 
Her brother was a police officer who 
also served in the military. One of her 
uncles was a detective, and the other 
uncle was the chief of police for the 
Miami Police Department. 
It was from that family of public 
servants that Judge Jackson set her 
sights high. 
After graduating from law school, 
doing very well there, she was a clerk 
for Justice Breyer. And then as she 
heads into this nomination after three 
votes—this will be her fourth vote in 
front of this Senate with bipartisan 
support—she will come to the Court 
with more—with more—judicial experi-
ence than four other Justices had when 
they went on the Court. These are cur-
rent Justices. 
She is the person we need right now. 
We know that trust in the Court has 
been fading, and so to have someone 
that has her legal acumen and back-
ground but also to have someone who 
gets that these decisions aren’t just 
words on a page; that the words on the 
page and the decisions you make as a 
judge are connected to real people; 
they affect whether someone is going 
to get healthcare; they affect their own 
healthcare choices; they affect if you 
are going to have clean water or air; 
and they affect whether or not you can 
actually vote and how you can vote 
and when you can vote and if you can 
vote—she gets it. 
I appreciated her willingness to take 
so many questions. We talked about 
antitrust, a subject true to my heart, 
as well as the importance of the First 
Amendment and many other detailed 
questions that she got. And I know a 
lot of those questions that got atten-
tion were the over-the-top ones, the at-
tacks on her, but, nevertheless, the 
bulk of the questions in that hearing 
got to true questions about the law and 
her views and her knowledge of the 
cases, and she passed every single thing 
with flying colors. 
At this critical moment, Judge Jack-
son has the qualities to make sure that 
the Court and the Constitution, in Jus-
tice Breyer’s words, ‘‘work for the peo-
ple of today.’’ 
She has a quintessentially American 
story, and as she put it, her success is 
a ‘‘testament to the hope and promise 
of this country.’’ 
I urge my colleagues to embrace the 
hope and promise of Judge Jackson and 
the hope and promise of this country. 
Vote for her. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am 
here to voice my very strong, enthusi-
astic support for Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson’s nomination and to urge all 
of our colleagues in joining me to vote 
to confirm her. 
Judge Jackson is one of the most ex-
ceptional Supreme Court nominees I 
have met, and I am so excited she is on 
her way to the Supreme Court. It is in-
credibly well deserved and incredibly 
good news for our country. 
The bottom line for me is always, can 
I tell my constituents back home in 
Washington State that if they ever 
have a case before this judge, this is 
someone who will listen, who will un-
derstand, and someone who will make a 
thoughtful, fair decision for them 
based on the laws of our Nation? And 
the answer with Judge Jackson is a re-
sounding yes. 
It is clear from her record she has the 
experience. It was clear from her hear-
ing that she has a masterful under-
standing of the law and a seemingly 
endless supply of perhaps unwarranted 
patience. 
And I think it is clear to anyone, 
after a few minutes with her, she has 
heart, compassion, and a commitment 
to justice. 
So it should be no surprise her nomi-
nation was met with wide acclaim, in-
cluding from prominent Republican 
lawyers and retired judges appointed 
by Republican Presidents. 
As a professional, Judge Jackson’s 
record doesn’t merely check the boxes 
we have come to expect from our Su-
preme Court nominees: a clerkship for 
Justice Breyer, experience as a district 
court judge and a circuit court judge. 
She also has experience that is less 
common to the highest Court in the 
land, and for that reason, all the more 
important—like her experience on the 
U.S. Sentencing Commission, a per-
spective 
only 
the 
retiring 
Justice 
Breyer brought to the Supreme Court 
or her experience as a public defender, 
something no other Supreme Court 
Justice has ever had. This is so impor-
tant and so long overdue. 
Being a public defender means devel-
oping an in-depth understanding of the 
legal needs of everyday people. Judges 
from these kinds of legal backgrounds 
can be better equipped to understand 
the experiences of each person before 
them to recognize the burden laws 
often place on people who are living 
with 
low 
income 
or 
otherwise 
marginalized, and ultimately to render 
more informed, more just decisions. 
And Judge Jackson’s background is 
more than simply a resume. It is her 
perspective growing up as the daughter 
of two public school teachers, her per-
spective as a working mother with two 
daughters of her own, and her perspec-
tive as a Black woman working in a 
profession where stories like hers were 
few and far between.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2006 
April 6, 2022 
I have no doubt that perspective will 
serve her and the people who come be-
fore her well as a Supreme Court Jus-
tice. 
And while her personal story tells us 
a lot, the way she gracefully and 
knowledgeably handled her confirma-
tion hearings shows us even more. Dur-
ing a confirmation process that a few 
Republicans tried to make incredibly 
ugly, she showed the kind of poise and 
patience befitting a U.S. Supreme 
Court Justice. 
Over the course of hundreds of ques-
tions, she offered thoughtful answers 
that 
demonstrated 
expert 
under-
standing of the law, a carefully consid-
ered methodology for how she ap-
proaches each case, and an unmistak-
able commitment to ensuring justice 
and upholding the liberties of all 
Americans, not just the powerful and 
well connected. 
And that is so important, especially 
at a time when so many rights are 
under attack. We continue to see Re-
publicans pushing through blatantly 
unconstitutional laws on the right to 
abortion. We are seeing the tragic con-
sequences of those reckless restrictions 
every day. 
We are also seeing attacks on the 
rights of workers as they seek to orga-
nize or form a union and fight for a 
better workplace. 
We are even seeing attacks on the 
cornerstone 
of 
our 
democracy—the 
right to vote—as Republicans have con-
tinually pushed through measures to 
block the ballot box and some even 
continue to dangerously deny the legit-
imacy of the last election. 
We need a Supreme Court Justice 
who understands, as Judge Jackson 
once 
put 
it, 
‘‘Presidents 
are 
not 
kings;’’ 
someone 
who 
understands 
equal justice is for all, not just the 
wealthy and the powerful. There are so 
many critical issues which come before 
the Court that matter so deeply to the 
American people—cases about workers’ 
rights or reproductive rights or voting 
rights or Tribal sovereignty, climate 
change, gun safety, immigration, and 
so much more. 
My constituents deserve to know the 
Justices hearing these cases are really 
going to listen to their concerns, un-
derstand their experiences, uphold our 
Constitution, and defend their rights. 
They deserve a Justice as thoughtful, 
compassionate, 
and 
committed 
as 
Ketanji Brown Jackson. 
I first ran for Senate because of the 
Supreme Court, watching the hearings 
with Anita Hill. I was frustrated that 
there was no one on the dais who 
looked like me, no one asking the ques-
tions that I would ask; and for most of 
the country throughout most of our 
history, our courts have been the same 
way. They have not represented the di-
versity of our Nation—not by a long 
shot. I am proud to say we are finally 
fixing that, including in my home 
State of Washington. And soon, we will 
take another historic step at the high-
est level possible. We will vote to put 
another mom on the Supreme Court. 
Ketanji Brown Jackson will make 
history as the first Black woman to 
serve on the highest Court in the land, 
though I am sure she will not be the 
last, because I know now there are lit-
tle girls across the country watching 
as the Senate confirms someone who 
looks like them to the Supreme Court 
for the first time ever. They are not 
just watching history being made; they 
are watching a barrier fall down, a 
path open up, and a new future that 
seems more possible than ever before. 
You know, I first ran for office be-
cause I watched the Supreme Court 
process and I was frustrated. Today, I 
am no less energized, but for a very dif-
ferent reason. Today, I am excited. I 
am inspired, even. And I hope people 
across our country watching this are as 
well. 
I hope a future Senator or a future 
Justice or even a future President is 
able to talk about what this moment 
meant to them and what doors Justice 
Jackson 
opened 
for 
others. 
I 
am 
thrilled to be voting yes on this nomi-
nation, and I strongly urge all of our 
colleagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BROWN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, it is 
an honor to support a thoughtful, expe-
rienced, historic nominee to our high-
est Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson. 
I met with her yesterday. It was so 
clear she has the experience, she has 
the character, she has the commitment 
to justice needed to be an excellent Su-
preme Court Justice. We talked about 
the legacy and the unfinished fight of 
Dr. King, how we could never forget 
that he was martyred in Memphis 
while fighting for the rights of sanita-
tion workers, some of the most ex-
ploited workers in segregated Amer-
ica—segregated in Memphis, TN. 
Dr. King understood better than per-
haps anybody how worker rights and 
voter rights come together. It is clear 
that Judge Jackson understands the 
dignity of work and that the rights of 
workers are integral civil rights. Peo-
ple think of the Supreme Court as 
something like an ivory tower de-
tached from people’s everyday lives, 
and we know that decisions these Jus-
tices make affect America’s work-
places and their paychecks and their 
safety on the job. That is why it mat-
ters so much whom we promote to 
these jobs. 
I am confident that Judge Jackson 
will be a Justice who protects the 
rights of all Americans, not just the 
powerful, not just the privileged. She 
brings with her a diverse set of experi-
ences and a perspective that has long 
been lacking from our Nation’s highest 
Courts. 
We, of course, know she is the first 
Black woman nominated to serve on 
the Court. She is a daughter of a public 
schoolteacher. She went to public 
schools 
herself—not 
that 
common, 
frankly, on the U.S. Supreme Court— 
and she is a former public defender. 
The nomination is truly historic. 
Her parents attended segregated pri-
mary schools, and now, their daughter 
will ascend to the highest levels of our 
government. Think about that. 
Judge Jackson has a history of bipar-
tisan support. Republicans supported 
her confirmation to the U.S. Court of 
Appeals. I am glad a few of my Repub-
lican colleagues have recognized those 
unimpeachable qualifications and are 
supporting her confirmation this week. 
I don’t know how anyone could doubt 
her intelligence, her thoughtfulness, 
her knowledge of the law, and her com-
mitment to justice. She clerked for 
Justice Breyer. She has shown she is 
the ideal nominee to carry on his leg-
acy of building consensus, in listening 
to all perspectives. 
It was an honor to talk with her yes-
terday and to hear her views. It will be 
an honor to vote for her later this 
week. 
Over the coming months and years, 
the Supreme Court is set to make deci-
sions on everything from Ohioans’ 
healthcare to workplace safety to their 
right to vote. If the Court makes these 
decisions that affect all Ohioans’ lives, 
I am confident that Judge Jackson un-
derstands the importance of equal jus-
tice and as a commitment to our Con-
stitution, including civil rights and in-
cluding worker rights. She will serve 
Ohioans and all Americans with the 
same grace and dignity and commit-
ment to our country she has shown 
over the past several weeks—meeting 
with Senators, speaking to the Presi-
dent, and in speaking to the Nation 
through the Judiciary Committee hear-
ings. I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting her confirmation.

DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.’S LETTER FROM 
BIRMINGHAM JAIL 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, it is 
my honor to—this is something I get to 
do once a year now—it is my honor to 
join Senator ROUNDS of South Dakota 
and Senator HIRONO from Hawaii, and 
then Senator COLLINS later, Senator 
BALDWIN, Senator ROMNEY, and Sen-
ator WARNOCK, to join my colleagues of 
both parties on the floor to read one of 
the greatest pieces of writing of the 
20th century, Dr. King’s letter from the 
Birmingham jail. 
I thank those Senators for joining us. 
Our former colleague, Senator Doug 
Jones, began this tradition. He did it in 
2019 and 2020. As he left the Senate in 
late 2020, he asked me to continue the 
tradition that he began. He would have 
been here on the floor with us to watch 
and to listen, but he was called to the 
White House on his work with Judge 
Jackson. 
This is a bipartisan reading. I very

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2007 
April 6, 2022 
friends—Senator ROUNDS will go first— 
and three Democrat friends, followed 
by Senator HIRONO. And let me just lay 
out where we are and what we are 
doing. 
It is April 1963. Dr. King was held in 
the Birmingham Jail for the supposed 
crime of leading a series of peaceful 
protests and boycotts in the city of 
Birmingham, AL. The goal was to put 
pressure on the business community to 
end discrimination in their hiring for 
local jobs. Some White ministers from 
Alabama would take issue with these 
boycotts. They said: Slow down, Dr. 
King. Don’t move too fast. We are for 
voting rights, too. We are for ending 
discrimination, but don’t demand too 
much all at once. 
Dr. King rejected that premise. That 
is what this letter is about. It is about 
demanding justice now for people in 
Alabama whose skin was Black and 
who simply could not vote because of 
the color of their skin. 
We can’t wait around and hope that 
problems in families’ lives will solve 
themselves. It is up to us as citizens, as 
leaders, as members of our churches in 
our communities. 
Dr. King made this point more elo-
quently and persuasively, certainly, 
than I can. We will begin the reading of 
the letter with Senator ROUNDS from 
South Dakota. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
Mr. ROUNDS. Madam President, la-
dies and gentlemen of the Senate: First 
of all, to my friend and colleague, Sen-
ator BROWN, I thank you for the oppor-
tunity to participate today, and I hope 
to do my best to add a feeling of 
strength to the message that Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King shared in his letter. 
This is a reading from a ‘‘Letter 
From Birmingham Jail,’’ Dr. Martin L. 
King Jr., April 16, 1963. 
My Dear Fellow Clergymen: 
While confined here in the Birmingham 
city jail, I came across your recent state-
ment calling my present activities ‘‘unwise 
and untimely.’’ Seldom do I pause to answer 
criticism of my work and ideas. If I sought 
to answer all the criticisms that cross my 
desk, my secretaries would have little time 
for anything other than such correspondence 
in the course of the day, and I would have no 
time for constructive work. But since I feel 
that you are men of genuine good will and 
that your criticisms are sincerely set forth, 
I want to try to answer your statement in 
what I hope will be patient and reasonable 
terms. 
I think I should indicate why I am here in 
Birmingham, since you have been influenced 
by the view which argues against ‘‘outsiders 
coming in.’’ I have the honor of serving as 
president of the Southern Christian Leader-
ship Conference, an organization operating 
in every southern state, with headquarters 
in Atlanta, Georgia. We have some eighty 
five 
affiliated 
organizations 
across 
the 
South, and one of them is the Alabama 
Christian Movement for Human Rights. Fre-
quently, we share staff, educational and fi-
nancial resources with our affiliates. Several 
months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham 
asked us to be on call to engage in a non-
violent direct action program if such were 
deemed necessary. We readily consented, and 
when the hour came we lived up to our prom-
ise. So I, along with several members of my 
staff, am here because I was invited here. I 
am here because I have organizational ties 
here. 
But more basically, I am in Birmingham 
because injustice is here. Just as the proph-
ets of the eighth century B.C. left their vil-
lages and carried their ‘‘thus saith the Lord’’ 
far beyond the boundaries of their home 
towns, and just as the Apostle Paul left his 
village of Tarsus and carried the gospel of 
Jesus Christ to the far corners of the Greco 
Roman world, so am I compelled to carry the 
gospel of freedom beyond my own home 
town. Like Paul, I must constantly respond 
to the Macedonian call for aid. 
Moreover, I am cognizant of the interrelat-
edness of all communities and states. I can-
not sit idly by in Atlanta and not be con-
cerned about what happens in Birmingham. 
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice ev-
erywhere. We are caught in an inescapable 
network of mutuality, tied in a single gar-
ment of destiny. Whatever affects one di-
rectly, affects all indirectly. Never again can 
we afford to live with the narrow, provincial 
‘outside agitator’ idea. Anyone who lives in-
side the United States can never be consid-
ered an outsider anywhere within its bounds. 
You deplore the demonstrations taking 
place in Birmingham. But your statement, I 
am sorry to say, fails to express a similar 
concern for the conditions that brought 
about the demonstrations. I am sure that 
none of you would want to rest content with 
the superficial kind of social analysis that 
deals merely with effects and does not grap-
ple with underlying causes. It is unfortunate 
that demonstrations are taking place in Bir-
mingham, but it is even more unfortunate 
that the city’s white power structure left the 
Negro community with no alternative. 
In any nonviolent campaign there are four 
basic steps: collection of the facts to deter-
mine whether injustices exist; negotiation; 
self purification; and direct action. We have 
gone through all these steps in Birmingham. 
There can be no gainsaying the fact that ra-
cial injustice engulfs this community. Bir-
mingham is probably the most thoroughly 
segregated city in the United States. Its ugly 
record of brutality is widely known. Negroes 
have experienced grossly unjust treatment in 
the courts. There have been more unsolved 
bombings of Negro homes and churches in 
Birmingham than in any other city in the 
nation. These are the hard, brutal facts of 
the case. On the basis of these conditions, 
Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the 
city fathers. But the latter consistently re-
fused to engage in good faith negotiation. 
Then, last September, came the oppor-
tunity to talk with leaders of Birmingham’s 
economic community. In the course of the 
negotiations, certain promises were made by 
the merchants—for example, to remove the 
stores’ humiliating racial signs. On the basis 
of 
these 
promises, 
the 
Reverend 
Fred 
Shuttlesworth and the leaders of the Ala-
bama Christian Movement for Human Rights 
agreed to a moratorium on all demonstra-
tions. As the weeks and months went by, we 
realized that we were the victims of a broken 
promise. A few signs, briefly removed, re-
turned; the others remained. As in so many 
past experiences, our hopes had been blasted, 
and the shadow of deep disappointment set-
tled upon us. We had no alternative except to 
prepare for direct action, whereby we would 
present our very bodies as a means of laying 
our case before the conscience of the local 
and the national community. Mindful of the 
difficulties involved, we decided to under-
take a process of self purification. We began 
a series of workshops on nonviolence, and we 
repeatedly asked ourselves: ‘‘Are you able to 
accept blows without retaliating?’’ ‘‘Are you 
able to endure the ordeal of jail?’’ We de-
cided to schedule our direct action program 
for the Easter season, realizing that except 
for Christmas, this is the main shopping pe-
riod of the year. Knowing that a strong eco-
nomic-withdrawal program would be the by-
product of direct action, we felt that this 
would be the best time to bring pressure to 
bear on the merchants for the needed 
change. 
Then it occurred to us that Birmingham’s 
mayoral election was coming up in March, 
and we speedily decided to postpone action 
until after election day. When we discovered 
that the Commissioner of Public Safety, Eu-
gene ‘‘Bull’’ Connor, had piled up enough 
votes to be in the run off, we decided again 
to postpone action until the day after the 
run off so that the demonstrations could not 
be used to cloud the issues. Like many oth-
ers, we waited to see Mr. Connor defeated, 
and to this end, we endured postponement 
after postponement. Having aided in this 
community need, we felt that our direct ac-
tion program could be delayed no longer. 
Ms. HIRONO. 
You may well ask: ‘‘Why direct action? 
Why sit-ins, marches and so forth? Isn’t ne-
gotiation a better path?’’ You are quite right 
in calling for negotiation. Indeed, this is the 
very purpose of direct action. Nonviolent di-
rect action seeks to create such a crisis and 
foster such a tension that a community 
which has constantly refused to negotiate is 
forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to 
dramatize the issue that it can no longer be 
ignored. My citing the creation of tension as 
part of the work of the nonviolent resister 
may sound rather shocking. But I must con-
fess that I am not afraid of the word ‘‘ten-
sion.’’ I have earnestly opposed violent ten-
sion, but there is a type of constructive, non-
violent 
tension 
which 
is 
necessary 
for 
growth. Just as Socrates felt that it was nec-
essary to create a tension in the mind so 
that individuals could rise from the bondage 
of myths and half-truths to the unfettered 
realm of creative analysis and objective ap-
praisal, so must we see the need for non-
violent gadflies to create the kind of tension 
in society that will help men rise from the 
dark depths of prejudice and racism to the 
majestic heights of understanding and broth-
erhood. The purpose of our direct action pro-
gram is to create a situation so crisis packed 
that it will inevitably open the door to nego-
tiation. I therefore concur with you in your 
call for negotiation. Too long has our be-
loved Southland been bogged down in a trag-
ic effort to live in monologue rather than 
dialogue. 
One of the basic points in your statement 
is that the action that I and my associates 
have taken in Birmingham is untimely. 
Some have asked: ‘‘Why didn’t you give the 
new city administration time to act?’’ The 
only answer that I can give to this query is 
that the new Birmingham administration 
must be prodded about as much as the out-
going one, before it will act. We are sadly 
mistaken if we feel that the election of Al-
bert Boutwell as mayor will bring the mil-
lennium to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell 
is a much more gentle person than Mr. Con-
nor, they are both segregationists, dedicated 
to maintenance of the status quo. I have 
hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable 
enough to see the futility of massive resist-
ance to desegregation. But he will not see 
this without pressure from devotees of civil 
rights. My friends, I must say to you that we 
have not made a single gain in civil rights 
without determined legal and nonviolent 
pressure. Lamentably, it is an historical fact 
that privileged groups seldom give up their 
privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see 
the moral light and voluntarily give up their

unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has 
reminded us, groups tend to be more im-
moral than individuals. 
We know through painful experience that 
freedom is never voluntarily given by the op-
pressor; it must be demanded by the op-
pressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a 
direct action campaign that was ‘‘well 
timed’’ in the view of those who have not 
suffered unduly from the disease of segrega-
tion. For years now I have heard the word 
‘‘Wait!’’ It rings in the ear of every Negro 
with piercing familiarity. This ‘‘Wait’’ has 
almost always meant ‘‘Never.’’ We must 
come to see, with one of our distinguished 
jurists, that ‘‘justice too long delayed is jus-
tice denied.’’ 
We have waited for more than 340 years for 
our constitutional and God given rights. The 
nations of Asia and Africa are moving with 
jetlike speed toward gaining political inde-
pendence, but we still creep at horse and 
buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at 
a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those 
who have never felt the stinging darts of seg-
regation to say, ‘‘Wait.’’ But when you have 
seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and 
fathers at will and drown your sisters and 
brothers at whim; when you have seen hate 
filled policemen curse, kick and even kill 
your black brothers and sisters; when you 
see the vast majority of your twenty million 
Negro brothers smothering in an airtight 
cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent 
society; when you suddenly find your tongue 
twisted and your speech stammering as you 
seek to explain to your six year old daughter 
why she can’t go to the public amusement 
park that has just been advertised on tele-
vision, and see tears welling up in her eyes 
when she is told that Funtown is closed to 
colored children, and see ominous clouds of 
inferiority beginning to form in her little 
mental sky, and see her beginning to distort 
her personality by developing an uncon-
scious bitterness toward white people; when 
you have to concoct an answer for a five year 
old son who is asking: ‘‘Daddy, why do white 
people treat colored people so mean?’’; when 
you take a cross country drive and find it 
necessary to sleep night after night in the 
uncomfortable corners of your automobile 
because no motel will accept you; when you 
are humiliated day in and day out by nag-
ging signs reading ‘‘white’’ and ‘‘colored’’; 
when your first name becomes [a racial slur], 
your middle name becomes ‘‘boy’’ (however 
old you are) and your last name becomes 
‘‘John,’’ and your wife and mother are never 
given the respected title ‘‘Mrs.’’; when you 
are harried by day and haunted by night by 
the fact that you are a Negro, living con-
stantly at tiptoe stance, never quite know-
ing what to expect next, and are plagued 
with inner fears and outer resentments; 
when you are forever fighting a degenerating 
sense of ‘‘nobodiness’’—then you will under-
stand why we find it difficult to wait. There 
comes a time when the cup of endurance 
runs over, and men are no longer willing to 
be plunged into the abyss of despair. 
Ms. COLLINS. 
I hope, sirs, that you can understand our 
legitimate and unavoidable impatience. You 
express a great deal of anxiety over our will-
ingness to break laws. This is certainly a le-
gitimate concern. Since we so diligently 
urge people to obey the Supreme Court’s de-
cision of 1954 outlawing segregation in the 
public schools, at first glance, it may seem 
rather paradoxical for us to consciously 
break laws. One may well ask: ‘‘How can you 
advocate breaking some laws and obeying 
others?’’ The answer lies in the fact that 
there are two types of laws: just and unjust. 
I would be the first to advocate obeying just 
laws. One has not only a legal but a moral 
responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, 
one has a moral responsibility to disobey un-
just laws. I would agree with St. Augustine 
that ‘‘an unjust law is no law at all.’’ 
Now, what is the difference between the 
two? How does one determine whether a law 
is just or unjust? A just law is a man made 
code that squares with the moral law or the 
law of God. An unjust law is a code that is 
out of harmony with the moral law. To put 
it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An 
unjust law is a human law that is not rooted 
in eternal law and natural law. Any law that 
uplifts human personality is just. Any law 
that degrades human personality is unjust. 
All segregation statutes are unjust because 
segregation distorts the soul and damages 
the personality. It gives the segregator a 
false sense of superiority and the segregated 
a false sense of inferiority. Segregation, to 
use the terminology of the Jewish philoso-
pher Martin Buber, substitutes an ‘‘I it’’ re-
lationship for an ‘‘I thou’’ relationship and 
ends up relegating persons to the status of 
things. Hence segregation is not only politi-
cally, economically and sociologically un-
sound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul 
Tillich has said that sin is separation. Is not 
segregation an existential expression of 
man’s tragic separation, his awful estrange-
ment, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that 
I can urge men to obey the 1954 decision of 
the Supreme Court, for it is morally right; 
and I can urge them to disobey segregation 
ordinances, for they are morally wrong. 
Let us consider a more concrete example of 
just and unjust laws. An unjust law is a code 
that a numerical or power majority group 
compels a minority group to obey but does 
not make binding on itself. This is difference 
made legal. By the same token, a just law is 
a code that a majority compels a minority to 
follow and that it is willing to follow itself. 
This is sameness made legal. Let me give an-
other explanation. A law is unjust if it is in-
flicted on a minority that, as a result of 
being denied the right to vote, had no part in 
enacting or devising the law. Who can say 
that the legislature of Alabama which set up 
that State’s segregation laws was democrat-
ically elected? Throughout Alabama all sorts 
of devious methods are used to prevent Ne-
groes from becoming registered voters, and 
there are some counties in which, even 
though Negroes constitute a majority of the 
population, not a single Negro is registered. 
Can 
any 
law 
enacted 
under 
such 
cir-
cumstances be considered democratically 
structured? 
Sometimes a law is just on its face and un-
just in its application. For instance, I have 
been arrested on a charge of parading with-
out a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in 
having an ordinance which requires a permit 
for a parade. But such an ordinance becomes 
unjust when it is used to maintain segrega-
tion and to deny citizens the First-Amend-
ment privilege of peaceful assembly and pro-
test. 
I hope you are able to see the distinction I 
am trying to point out. In no sense do I advo-
cate evading or defying the law, as would the 
rabid segregationist. That would lead to an-
archy. One who breaks an unjust law must 
do so openly, lovingly, and with a willing-
ness to accept the penalty. I submit that an 
individual who breaks a law that conscience 
tells him is unjust, and who willingly ac-
cepts the penalty of imprisonment in order 
to arouse the conscience of the community 
over its injustice, is in reality expressing the 
highest respect for law. 
Of course, there is nothing new about this 
kind of civil disobedience. It was evidenced 
sublimely 
in 
the 
refusal 
of 
Shadrach, 
Meshach, and Abednego to obey the laws of 
Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher 
moral law was at stake. It was practiced su-
perbly by the early Christians, who were 
willing to face hungry lions and the excru-
ciating pain of chopping blocks rather than 
submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman 
Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a 
reality today because Socrates practiced 
civil disobedience. In our own nation, the 
Boston Tea Party represented a massive act 
of civil disobedience. 
We should never forget that everything 
Adolf Hitler did in Germany was ‘‘legal’’ and 
everything the Hungarian freedom fighters 
did in Hungary was ‘‘illegal.’’ It was ‘‘ille-
gal’’ to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitler’s 
Germany. Even so, I am sure that, had I 
lived in Germany at the time, I would have 
aided and comforted my Jewish brothers. If 
today I lived in a Communist country where 
certain principles dear to the Christian faith 
are suppressed, I would openly advocate dis-
obeying that country’s antireligious laws. 
Mr. BROWN. 
I must make two honest confessions to 
you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. 
First, I must confess that over the past few 
years I have been gravely disappointed with 
the white moderate. I have almost reached 
the regrettable conclusion that the Negro’s 
great stumbling block in his stride toward 
freedom is not the White Citizen’s Counciler 
or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white mod-
erate, who is more devoted to ‘‘order’’ than 
to justice; who prefers a negative peace 
which is the absence of tension to a positive 
peace which is the presence of justice; who 
constantly says: ‘‘I agree with you in the 
goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your 
methods 
of 
direct 
action’’; 
who 
paternalistically believes he can set the 
timetable for another man’s freedom; who 
lives by a mythical concept of time and who 
constantly advises the Negro to wait for a 
‘‘more convenient season.’’ Shallow under-
standing from people of goodwill is more 
frustrating than absolute misunderstanding 
from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance 
is much more bewildering than outright re-
jection. 
I had hoped that the white moderate would 
understand that law and order exist for the 
purpose of establishing justice and that when 
they fail in this purpose they become the 
dangerously structured dams that block the 
flow of social progress. I had hoped that the 
white moderate would understand that the 
present tension in the South is a necessary 
phase of the transition from an obnoxious 
negative peace, in which the Negro passively 
accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive 
and positive peace, in which all men will re-
spect the dignity and worth of human per-
sonality. Actually, we who engage in non-
violent direct action are not the creators of 
tension. We merely bring to the surface the 
hidden tension that is already alive. We 
bring it out in the open, where it can be seen 
and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be 
cured so long as it is covered up but must be 
opened with all its ugliness to the natural 
medicines of air and light, injustice must be 
exposed, with all the tension its exposure 
creates, to the light of human conscience 
and the air of national opinion before it can 
be cured. 
In your statement you assert that our ac-
tions, even though peaceful, must be con-
demned because they precipitate violence. 
But is this a logical assertion? Isn’t this like 
condemning a robbed man because his pos-
session of money precipitated the evil act of 
robbery? Isn’t this like condemning Socrates 
because his unswerving commitment to 
truth and his philosophical inquiries precip-
itated the act by the misguided populace in 
which they made him drink hemlock? Isn’t 
this like condemning Jesus because his 
unique God consciousness and never ceasing

devotion to God’s will precipitated the evil 
act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, 
as the federal courts have consistently af-
firmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to 
cease his efforts to gain his basic constitu-
tional rights because the quest may precipi-
tate violence. Society must protect the 
robbed and punish the robber. I had also 
hoped that the white moderate would reject 
the myth concerning time in relation to the 
struggle for freedom. I have just received a 
letter from a white brother in Texas. He 
writes: ‘‘All Christians know that the col-
ored people will receive equal rights eventu-
ally, but it is possible that you are in too 
great a religious hurry. It has taken Christi-
anity almost two thousand years to accom-
plish what it has. The teachings of Christ 
take time to come to earth.’’ Such an atti-
tude stems from a tragic misconception of 
time, from the strangely irrational notion 
that there is something in the very flow of 
time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actu-
ally, time itself is neutral; it can be used ei-
ther destructively or constructively. More 
and more I feel that the people of ill will 
have used time much more effectively than 
have the people of good will. We will have to 
repent in this generation not merely for the 
hateful words and actions of the bad people 
but for the appalling silence of the good peo-
ple. Human progress never rolls in on wheels 
of inevitability; it comes through the tire-
less efforts of men willing to be coworkers 
with God, and without this hard work, time 
itself becomes an ally of the forces of social 
stagnation. We must use time creatively, in 
the knowledge that the time is always ripe 
to do right. Now is the time to make real the 
promise of democracy and transform our 
pending national elegy into a creative psalm 
of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our 
national policy from the quicksand of racial 
injustice to the solid rock of human dignity. 
You speak of our activity in Birmingham 
as extreme. At first I was rather dis-
appointed that fellow clergymen would see 
my nonviolent efforts as those of an extrem-
ist. I began thinking about the fact that I 
stand in the middle of two opposing forces in 
the Negro community. One is a force of com-
placency, made up in part of Negroes who, as 
a result of long years of oppression, are so 
drained of self respect in the sense of 
‘‘somebodiness’’ that they have adjusted to 
segregation; and in part of a few middle-class 
Negroes who, because of a degree of aca-
demic and economic security and because in 
some ways they profit by segregation, have 
become insensitive to the problems of the 
masses. The other force is one of bitterness 
and hatred, and it comes perilously close to 
advocating violence. It is expressed in the 
various black nationalist groups that are 
springing up across the nation, the largest 
and best known being Elijah Muhammad’s 
Muslim movement. Nourished by the Negro’s 
frustration over the continued existence of 
racial discrimination, this movement is 
made up of people who have lost faith in 
America, who have absolutely repudiated 
Christianity, and who have concluded that 
the white man is an incorrigible ‘‘devil.’’ 
I have tried to stand between these two 
forces, saying that we need emulate neither 
the ‘‘do nothingism’’ of the complacent nor 
the hatred and despair of the black nation-
alist. For there is the more excellent way of 
love and nonviolent protest. I am grateful to 
God that, through the influence of the Negro 
church, the way of nonviolence became an 
integral part of our struggle. If this philos-
ophy had not emerged, by now many streets 
of the South would, I am convinced, be flow-
ing with blood. And I am further convinced 
that if our white brothers dismiss as ‘‘rabble 
rousers’’ and ‘‘outside agitators’’ those of us 
who employ nonviolent direct action, and if 
they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts, 
millions of Negroes will, out of frustration 
and despair, seek solace and security in 
black nationalist ideologies—a development 
that would inevitably lead to a frightening 
racial nightmare. 
Ms. BALDWIN. 
Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed 
forever. The yearning for freedom eventually 
manifests itself, and that is what has hap-
pened to the American Negro. Something 
within has reminded him of his birthright of 
freedom, and something without has re-
minded him that it can be gained. Con-
sciously or unconsciously, he has been 
caught up by the Zeitgeist, and with his 
black brothers of Africa and his brown and 
yellow brothers of Asia, South America and 
the Caribbean, the United States Negro is 
moving with a sense of great urgency toward 
the promised land of racial justice. If one 
recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed 
the Negro community, one should readily 
understand why public demonstrations are 
taking place. The Negro has many pent up 
resentments and latent frustrations, and he 
must release them. So let him march; let 
him make prayer pilgrimages to the city 
hall; let him go on freedom rides—and try to 
understand why he must do so. If his re-
pressed emotions are not released in non-
violent ways, they will seek expression 
through violence; this is not a threat but a 
fact of history. So I have not said to my peo-
ple: ‘‘Get rid of your discontent.’’ Rather, I 
have tried to say that this normal and 
healthy discontent can be channeled through 
into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct 
action. And now this approach is being 
termed extremist. But though I was initially 
disappointed at being categorized as an ex-
tremist, as I continued to think about the 
matter I gradually gained a measure of satis-
faction from the label. Was not Jesus an ex-
tremist for love: ‘‘Love your enemies, bless 
them that curse you, do good to them that 
hate you, and pray for them which despite-
fully use you, and persecute you.’’ Was not 
Amos an extremist for justice: ‘‘Let justice 
roll down like waters and righteousness like 
an ever flowing stream.’’ Was not Paul an ex-
tremist for the Christian gospel: ‘‘I bear in 
my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.’’ Was 
not Martin Luther an extremist: ‘‘Here I 
stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me 
God.’’ And John Bunyan: ‘‘I will stay in jail 
to the end of my days before I make a butch-
ery of my conscience.’’ And Abraham Lin-
coln: ‘‘This nation cannot survive half slave 
and half free.’’ And Thomas Jefferson: ‘‘We 
hold these truths to be self evident, that all 
men are created equal . . . ’’ So the question 
is not whether we will be extremists, but 
what kind of extremists we will be. Will we 
be extremists for hate or for love? Will we be 
extremists for the preservation of injustice 
or for the extension of justice? In that dra-
matic scene on Calvary’s hill three men were 
crucified. We must never forget that all 
three were crucified for the same crime—the 
crime of extremism. Two were extremists for 
immorality, and thus fell below their envi-
ronment. The other, Jesus Christ, was an ex-
tremist for love, truth and goodness, and 
thereby rose above his environment. Perhaps 
the South, the nation and the world are in 
dire need of creative extremists. 
I had hoped that the white moderate would 
see this need. Perhaps I was too optimistic; 
perhaps I expected too much. I suppose I 
should have realized that few members of the 
oppressor race can understand the deep 
groans and passionate yearnings of the op-
pressed race, and still fewer have the vision 
to see that injustice must be rooted out by 
strong, persistent and determined action. I 
am thankful, however, that some of our 
white brothers in the South have grasped the 
meaning of this social revolution and com-
mitted themselves to it. They are still all 
too few in quantity, but they are big in qual-
ity. Some—such as Ralph McGill, Lillian 
Smith, Harry Golden, James McBride Dabbs, 
Ann Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle—have 
written about our struggle in eloquent and 
prophetic terms. Others have marched with 
us down nameless streets of the South. They 
have languished in filthy, roach infested 
jails, suffering the abuse and brutality of po-
licemen who view them as ‘‘dirty nigger- 
lovers.’’ Unlike so many of their moderate 
brothers and sisters, they have recognized 
the urgency of the moment and sensed the 
need for powerful ‘‘action’’ antidotes to com-
bat the disease of segregation. Let me take 
note of my other major disappointment. I 
have been so greatly disappointed with the 
white church and its leadership. Of course, 
there are some notable exceptions. I am not 
unmindful of the fact that each of you has 
taken some significant stands on this issue. 
I commend you, Reverend Stallings, for your 
Christian stand on this past Sunday, in wel-
coming Negroes to your worship service on a 
nonsegregated basis. I commend the Catholic 
leaders of this state for integrating Spring 
Hill College several years ago. 
But despite these notable exceptions, I 
must honestly reiterate that I have been dis-
appointed with the church. I do not say this 
as one of those negative critics who can al-
ways find something wrong with the church. 
I say this as a minister of the gospel, who 
loves the church; who was nurtured in its 
bosom; who has been sustained by its spir-
itual blessings and who will remain true to it 
as long as the cord of life shall lengthen. 
Mr. ROMNEY. 
When I was suddenly catapulted into the 
leadership of the bus protest in Montgomery, 
Alabama, a few years ago, I felt we would be 
supported by the white church. I felt that 
the white ministers, priests and rabbis of the 
South would be among our strongest allies. 
Instead, some have been outright opponents, 
refusing to understand the freedom move-
ment and misrepresenting its leaders; all too 
many others have been more cautious than 
courageous and have remained silent behind 
the anesthetizing security of stained glass 
windows. 
In spite of my shattered dreams, I came to 
Birmingham with the hope that the white re-
ligious leadership of this community would 
see the justice of our cause and, with deep 
moral concern, would serve as the channel 
through which our just grievances could 
reach the power structure. I had hoped that 
each of you would understand. But again I 
have been disappointed. 
I have heard numerous southern religious 
leaders admonish their worshipers to comply 
with a desegregation decision because it is 
the law, but I have longed to hear white min-
isters declare: ‘‘Follow this decree because 
integration is morally right and because the 
Negro is your brother.’’ In the midst of bla-
tant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I 
have watched white churchmen stand on the 
sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and 
sanctimonious trivialities. In the midst of a 
mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial 
and economic injustice, I have heard many 
ministers say: ‘‘Those are social issues, with 
which the gospel has no real concern.’’ And I 
have watched many churches commit them-
selves to a completely other worldly religion 
which makes a strange, un-Biblical distinc-
tion between body and soul, between the sa-
cred and the secular. 
I have traveled the length and breadth of 
Alabama, Mississippi and all the other 
southern states. On sweltering summer days 
and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at

the South’s beautiful churches with their 
lofty spires pointing heavenward. I have be-
held the impressive outlines of her massive 
religious education buildings. Over and over 
I have found myself asking: ‘‘What kind of 
people worship here? Who is their God? 
Where were their voices when the lips of 
Governor Barnett dripped with words of 
interposition and nullification? Where were 
they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion 
call for defiance and hatred? Where were 
their voices of support when bruised and 
weary Negro men and women decided to rise 
from the dark dungeons of complacency to 
the bright hills of creative protest?’’ 
Yes, these questions are still in my mind. 
In deep disappointment I have wept over the 
laxity of the church. But be assured that my 
tears have been tears of love. There can be 
no deep disappointment where there is not 
deep love. Yes, I love the church. How could 
I do otherwise? I am in the rather unique po-
sition of being the son, the grandson and the 
great grandson of preachers. Yes, I see the 
church as the body of Christ. But, oh! How 
we have blemished and scarred that body 
through social neglect and through fear of 
being nonconformists. 
There was a time when the church was 
very powerful—in the time when the early 
Christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy 
to suffer for what they believed. In those 
days the church was not merely a thermom-
eter that recorded the ideas and principles of 
popular opinion; it was a thermostat that 
transformed the mores of society. Whenever 
the early Christians entered a town, the peo-
ple in power became disturbed and imme-
diately sought to convict the Christians for 
being ‘‘disturbers of the peace’’ and ‘‘outside 
agitators.’’ But the Christians pressed on, in 
the conviction that they were ‘‘a colony of 
heaven,’’ called to obey God rather than 
man. Small in number, they were big in com-
mitment. They were too God-intoxicated to 
be ‘‘astronomically intimidated.’’ By their 
effort and example they brought an end to 
such ancient evils as infanticide and glad-
iatorial contests. Things are different now. 
So often the contemporary church is a weak, 
ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound. So 
often it is an archdefender of the status quo. 
Far from being disturbed by the presence of 
the church, the power structure of the aver-
age community is consoled by the church’s 
silent—and often even vocal—sanction of 
things as they are. 
But the judgment of God is upon the 
church as never before. If today’s church 
does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of 
the early church, it will lose its authen-
ticity, forfeit the loyalty of millions, and be 
dismissed as an irrelevant social club with 
no meaning for the twentieth century. Every 
day I meet young people whose disappoint-
ment with the church has turned into out-
right disgust. 
Perhaps I have once again been too opti-
mistic. Is organized religion too inextricably 
bound to the status quo to save our nation 
and the world? Perhaps I must turn my faith 
to the inner spiritual church, the church 
within the church, as the true ekklesia and 
the hope of the world. But again I am thank-
ful to God that some noble souls from the 
ranks of organized religion have broken 
loose from the paralyzing chains of con-
formity and joined us as active partners in 
the struggle for freedom. They have left 
their secure congregations and walked the 
streets of Albany, Georgia, with us. They 
have gone down the highways of the South 
on tortuous rides for freedom. Yes, they have 
gone to jail with us. Some have been dis-
missed from their churches, have lost the 
support of their bishops and fellow ministers. 
But they have acted in the faith that right 
defeated is stronger than evil triumphant. 
Their witness has been the spiritual salt that 
has preserved the true meaning of the gospel 
in these troubled times. They have carved a 
tunnel of hope through the dark mountain of 
disappointment. I hope the church as a whole 
will meet the challenge of this decisive hour. 
But even if the church does not come to the 
aid of justice, I have no despair about the fu-
ture. I have no fear about the outcome of our 
struggle in Birmingham, even if our motives 
are at present misunderstood. We will reach 
the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all 
over the nation, because the goal of America 
is freedom. 
Mr. WARNOCK. 
Abused and scorned though we may be, our 
destiny is tied up with America’s destiny. 
Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we 
were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched 
the majestic words of the Declaration of 
Independence across the pages of history, we 
were here. For more than two centuries our 
forebears labored in this country without 
wages; they made cotton king; they built the 
homes of their masters while suffering gross 
injustice and shameful humiliation—and yet 
out of a bottomless vitality they continued 
to thrive and develop. If the inexpressible 
cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the op-
position we now face will surely fail. We will 
win our freedom because the sacred heritage 
of our nation and the eternal will of God are 
embodied in our echoing demands. Before 
closing I feel impelled to mention one other 
point in your statement that has troubled 
me profoundly. You warmly commended the 
Birmingham police force for keeping ‘‘order’’ 
and ‘‘preventing violence.’’ I doubt that you 
would have so warmly commended the police 
force if you had seen its dogs sinking their 
teeth into unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I 
doubt that you would so quickly commend 
the policemen if you were to observe their 
ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes 
here in the city jail; if you were to watch 
them push and curse old Negro women and 
young Negro girls; if you were to see them 
slap and kick old Negro men and young boys; 
if you were to observe them, as they did on 
two occasions, refuse to give us food because 
we wanted to sing our grace together. I can-
not join you in your praise of the Bir-
mingham police department. 
It is true that the police have exercised a 
degree of discipline in handling the dem-
onstrators. In this sense they have con-
ducted themselves rather ‘‘nonviolently’’ in 
public. But for what purpose? To preserve 
the evil system of segregation. Over the past 
few years I have consistently preached that 
nonviolence demands that the means we use 
must be as pure as the ends we seek. I have 
tried to make it clear that it is wrong to use 
immoral means to attain moral ends. But 
now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or 
perhaps even more so, to use moral means to 
preserve immoral ends. Perhaps Mr. Connor 
and his policemen have been rather non-
violent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in 
Albany, Georgia, but they have used the 
moral means of nonviolence to maintain the 
immoral end of racial injustice. As T.S. Eliot 
has said: ‘‘The last temptation is the great-
est treason: To do the right deed for the 
wrong reason.’’ 
I wish you had commended the Negro sit 
inners and demonstrators of Birmingham for 
their sublime courage, their willingness to 
suffer and their amazing discipline in the 
midst of great provocation. One day the 
South will recognize its real heroes. They 
will be the James Merediths, with the noble 
sense of purpose that enables them to face 
jeering and hostile mobs, and with the ago-
nizing loneliness that characterizes the life 
of the pioneer. They will be old, oppressed, 
battered Negro women, symbolized in a sev-
enty two year old woman in Montgomery, 
Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity 
and with her people decided not to ride seg-
regated buses, and who responded with 
ungrammatical profundity to one who in-
quired about her weariness: ‘‘My feets is 
tired, but my soul is at rest.’’ They will be 
the young high school and college students, 
the young ministers of the gospel and a host 
of 
their 
elders, 
courageously 
and 
non-
violently sitting in at lunch counters and 
willingly going to jail for conscience’s sake. 
One day the South will know that when 
these disinherited children of God sat down 
at lunch counters, they were in reality 
standing up for what is best in the American 
dream and for the most sacred values in our 
Judeo Christian heritage, thereby bringing 
our nation back to those great wells of de-
mocracy which were dug deep by the found-
ing fathers in their formulation of the Con-
stitution and the Declaration of Independ-
ence. 
Never before have I written so long a let-
ter. I’m afraid it is much too long to take 
your precious time. I can assure you that it 
would have been much shorter if I had been 
writing from a comfortable desk, but what 
else can one do when he is alone in a narrow 
jail cell, other than write long letters, think 
long thoughts and pray long prayers? 
If I have said anything in this letter that 
overstates the truth and indicates an unrea-
sonably impatience, I beg you to forgive me. 
If I have said anything that understates the 
truth and indicates my having a patience 
that allows me to settle for anything less 
than brotherhood, I beg God to forgive me. 
I hope this letter finds you strong in the 
faith. I also hope that circumstances will 
soon make it possible for me to meet each of 
you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights 
leader but as a fellow clergymen and a Chris-
tian brother. Let us all hope that the dark 
clouds of racial prejudice will soon pass away 
and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be 
lifted from our fear drenched communities, 
and in some not too distant tomorrow the ra-
diant stars of love and brotherhood will 
shine over our great nation with all their 
scintillating beauty. 
Yours for the cause of Peace and Brother-
hood, 
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. 
BROWN. 
Madam 
President, 
thanks to my colleagues, Senator 
WARNOCK, Senator BALDWIN in the Pre-
siding Officer’s Chair, Senator ROUNDS, 
Senator HIRONO, Senator COLLINS, and 
Senator ROMNEY for joining me to read 
these powerful words today. 
This tradition began in 2019 when 
Senator Doug Jones from Alabama, a 
leader in the civil rights movement, as 
Senator WARNOCK who just spoke also 
is—he began this tradition in 2019. And 
then when he left the Senate in 2020, he 
asked me to continue and together 
read these powerful words—a diverse 
group on the floor today. We come 
from different backgrounds. We dis-
agree on a number of things. We love 
this country. We know we can do bet-
ter for the people who make it work. 
In my meeting yesterday with Judge 
Jackson—soon to be Justice Jackson— 
we talked about the deep connection 
between 
civil 
rights 
and 
workers’ 
rights. Dr. King spoke to labor audi-
ences throughout his life. He preached 
with a unique eloquence about the in-
herent dignity of work. He said that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2011

‘‘so often we overlook the work and 
significance of those who are not in 
professional jobs, of those who are not 
in the so-called big jobs . . . Whenever 
you are engaged in work that serves 
humanity and is for the building of hu-
manity,’’ Dr. King said, ‘‘it has dignity 
and it has worth.’’ He said that ‘‘no 
labor is really menial unless you’re not 
getting adequate wages.’’ 
I think about the campaign Dr. King 
waged when he was assassinated. We 
will never forget that he was martyred 
in Memphis while fighting for some of 
the most exploited workers in the 
country: sanitation workers in seg-
regated Memphis. 
We know too many workers face a 
similar exploitation today. We have 
seen, over the past 2 years, how many 
workers corporations call essential but 
treat as expendable. It is their whole 
business model. 
It is not a coincidence that many of 
those workers look like the ones for 
whom Dr. King was fighting for, that 
they are not the ones in the so-called— 
his words—‘‘big jobs.’’ 
When on occasion, a company tries to 
do the right thing when they announce 
a pay raise or investment in workers, 
often Wall Street punishes them. 
This week, Starbucks—a corporation 
currently fighting its own workers try-
ing to organize a union—announced 
they are throwing a bone to workers. 
The company is going to do a little 
tiny bit less in executive compensation 
in the form of stock buybacks this year 
and do some investment in the workers 
instead, and their stock price went 
down. The Wall Street business model 
doesn’t just do nothing for workers— 
pardon the grammar—it actively dis-
courages investment in workers. 
It has to change. Until hard work 
pays off for all workers, Dr. King’s 
work remains unfinished. That means 
paying all workers a living wage. Sen-
ator WARNOCK is still on the floor, and 
Senator BALDWIN, the Presiding Offi-
cer, are two of the people that fight the 
hardest for that. 
All workers must make a living 
wage, have more power over their 
schedule, provide good benefits and 
safety on the job, and not fight orga-
nizing a union. That means all workers 
get a fair share of the wealth that they 
create. It means recognizing the dig-
nity of the communities that Black 
Americans have built over generations. 
That is how we bring ourselves closer 
to the society that Dr. King envisioned 
where all labor has dignity. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, I 
rise in support of Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson’s confirmation to be an Asso-
ciate Justice on the Supreme Court of 
the United States and look forward to 
proudly voting for her confirmation. 
There are few constitutional duties 
more important in my role as a U.S. 
Senator than providing the advice and 
consent on judicial nominations, and 
this is especially true for the Supreme 
Court. 
As we consider Judge Jackson’s nom-
ination before this body, we are on the 
cusp of a historic, barrier-breaking mo-
ment and on the verge of confirming 
the first African-American woman to 
serve on the Supreme Court. 
This is not only a significant mile-
stone, but a moment to recognize 
Judge Jackson, who is one of our Na-
tion’s brightest legal minds and an in-
credibly impressive nominee. 
Before I talk about Judge Jackson’s 
exceptional experience, her qualifica-
tions, and support from all across the 
legal spectrum, I think it is important 
to reflect on the critical importance of 
our Nation’s highest Court. 
Without question, Supreme Court 
rulings have a direct and a consequen-
tial 
impact 
on 
the 
lives 
of 
Michiganders and all Americans. Issues 
before the Court include healthcare, 
women’s reproductive rights, workers’ 
rights, environmental protections, vot-
ing rights, and many life-or-death deci-
sions that shape the law of the land. 
Simply put, the Supreme Court is 
often the last line of defense for every-
day 
Americans 
and 
an 
important 
guardian of the Constitution itself. 
There is no question that a lifetime 
appointment to the Supreme Court is a 
tremendous 
responsibility, 
and 
we 
must have qualified, committed Jus-
tices who will exercise judicial inde-
pendence—follow the facts—and apply 
law and precedent fairly and impar-
tially, without regard for their own 
personal views, partisanship, or poli-
tics. 
It is clear that on every single meas-
ure, Judge Jackson has the credentials, 
the qualities, the work ethic, and char-
acter needed to serve on the Supreme 
Court. And she will not only bring di-
versity but a unique life perspective 
and passion for the law that she devel-
oped at a very young age. 
Judge Jackson’s interest in the law 
actually started as a preschooler, sit-
ting next to her father while he studied 
cases for law school, while she worked 
on her coloring book. 
Despite being ambitious and a star 
student, growing up, Judge Jackson 
faced resistance. When Judge Jackson 
told her high school guidance counselor 
that she was interested in attending 
Harvard University, the counselor told 
her that maybe she should set her 
sights lower than that. 
Judge Jackson was not going to be 
deterred, and she credits her high 
school debate coach for introducing her 
to several colleges. And then she went 
on to graduate magna cum laude from 
Harvard as an undergraduate and cum 
laude from Harvard Law School. 
This was the beginning of Judge 
Jackson’s distinguished legal career. 
She clerked for three Federal judges, 
including 
Supreme 
Court 
Justice 
Breyer, worked in private practice at 
prestigious law firms, and has served 
on the Federal bench on both the dis-
trict court and the court of appeals, a 
position she was confirmed to just last 
year by bipartisan support by this very 
Senate. 
Judge Jackson’s experience has also 
been shaped by representing everyday 
Americans and hearing their cases. She 
will be the first Justice who previously 
served as a Federal public defender, 
and the only Justice who has served as 
a member of the bipartisan U.S. Sen-
tencing Commission. She will also 
bring considerable criminal law experi-
ence to the Court. 
Her breadth of experience, her record, 
and temperament were on full display 
during her Senate judiciary confirma-
tion hearing. Over the course of 24 
hours and more than 600 questions, 
Judge Jackson not only demonstrated 
why she is qualified to serve on the Su-
preme Court but also why she was 
unflappable, even when she faced out-
rageous—absolutely outrageous—false 
attacks on her record during the com-
mittee hearings. 
During this process, Judge Jackson 
has not only earned bipartisan support 
for her confirmation but has the back-
ing of diverse voices, including from 
the American Bar Association, which 
unanimously gave her its highest rat-
ing of ‘‘well qualified.’’ 
Lawyers across the political spec-
trum, civil rights organization, law en-
forcement groups, and chambers of 
commerce have all offered not just sup-
port but glowing support for her nomi-
nation. 
Former George H. W. Bush’s ap-
pointed Fourth Circuit Judge Michael 
Luttig called Judge Jackson ‘‘emi-
nently 
qualified’’ 
and 
‘‘as 
highly 
credentialed and experienced in the law 
as any nominee in history.’’ 
Two dozen conservative and former 
Republican-appointed officials said: 
We are united in our view that she is ex-
ceptionally well-qualified, given her breadth 
of experience, her demonstrated ability, and 
personal attributes of intellect and char-
acter. We think that her confirmation on a 
consensus basis would strengthen the court 
and the nation in important ways. 
And the International Association of 
Chiefs of Police said: 
During her time as judge, she has displayed 
her dedication to ensuring that our commu-
nities are safe and that the interest[s] of jus-
tice are served. [We believe that] Judge 
Jackson’s years of experience have shown 
[that] she has the temperament and quali-
fications to serve as the next Associate Jus-
tice of the United States Supreme Court. 
After my one-on-one meeting with 
Judge Jackson last week, I was con-
vinced that she is extraordinarily 
qualified and prepared to serve on the 
Supreme Court, particularly at this 
challenging moment. 
This is, without question, a chal-
lenging time, not only for the Supreme

it is clear that Judge Jackson has the

fidelity to the law that will undoubt-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, Russia’s invasion into Ukraine is 
changing the global order, the likes of 
which the world has not witnessed 
since the end of the Cold War. Vladimir 
Putin launched an unprovoked and bru-
tal war—one that left the United 
States and our allies shocked and en-
raged. The global response to Putin’s 
provocation was a mix of sharp words, 
hastily delivered weapons, and targeted 
sanctions, but even as we speak, the 
actions from the Biden administration 
are still too weak. 
As airwaves were flooded with mes-
sages of support and solidarity with 
Ukraine, one major power was very 
vocal in their support against Ukraine, 
and that was China. 
China vocally took Russia’s side very 
quickly. The two countries share a 
land border, but they also issued a 
statement of solidarity on February 4, 
just 20 days before the invasion. And 
there is no doubt that China is looking 
at the Western response to the war un-
folding in Ukraine, and it plans to con-
sume its neighbor, Taiwan, in the same 
fashion. 
Yesterday, an article in the New 
York Times detailed the lengths China 
is going to in order to convince its peo-
ple that their support for Russia is 
righteous and their hatred of the West 
is justified. The article goes on to out-
line 
China’s 
pro-Putin 
propaganda, 
stating: 
Chinese universities have organized classes 
to give students a ‘‘correct understanding’’ 
of the war, often highlighting Russia’s griev-
ances with the West. Party newspapers have 
run a series of commentaries blaming the 
United States of America for the conflict. 
China’s political posturing should be 
taken very, very seriously. The CCP is 
building the foundation for its future 
actions. Since 1949, the Chinese Com-
munist Party has been eyeing Taiwan 
and patiently waiting. They have not 
attacked because the United States 
and other free nations have strength-
ened the tiny island. That is the es-
sence 
of 
deterrence. 
We 
want 
Xi 
Jinping to look out his window each 
morning and think: Not today. 
Our President’s response to Russia’s 
invading Ukraine has not inspired con-
fidence in the Pacific. Joseph Wu, Tai-
wan’s Foreign Minister, recently stat-
ed: 
When we watch the events in Ukraine 
evolving . . . we are also watching very care-
fully what China may do [to us] in Taiwan. 
Alarmingly, the White House is indif-
ferent to the warming relations be-
tween China and Russia. When asked 
about a recent call between President 
Biden and President Xi, regarding the 
war in Ukraine, White House Press 
Secretary Jen Psaki said, in part: 
China has to make a decision for them-
selves about where they want to stand. 
In July, President Biden’s climate 
czar, John Kerry, said that he is ‘‘gen-
uine friends with China’’ and continued 
to praise President Xi. 
Let’s get this straight. Russia and 
China both stand against the United 
States. Neither country is our friend— 
period. Both seek to expand authori-
tarian world order and diminish Amer-
ican leadership. The key difference is 
that Russia is a small bully, but China 
is a huge, huge threat. 
China’s growing economy affords its 
growing ambition. China became the 
world’s largest exporting nation in 
2009, and today, China controls the 
world’s supply of titanium, rare earth 
metals, 
shipbuilding, 
and 
clothing 
manufacturing, among others. 
China seeks to control the South 
China Sea and all the trade that flows 
through it. China wants to replace the 
dollar as the global reserve currency 
and aims to exceed the military might 
of the United States. 
And there is no secret—there is no 
secret at all—that China wants Tai-
wan’s semiconductor industry. 
Semiconductors power our everyday 
life. If it has an on-and-off switch, it 
has a chip. Chips are even found nearly 
everywhere, from our credit cards to 
our phones, to the processors in our 
weapons, and even in our satellites. 
For the sake of our national security, 
we need to increase domestic invest-
ment and produce these chips on Amer-
ican soil. 
Currently, the Taiwan-based Semi-
conductor Manufacturing Company is 
responsible for over 90 percent—90 per-
cent—of these chips, one small, little 
island. 
Over the last decade, China has made 
investments in their domestic semicon-
ductor industry, but Chinese-produced 
chips don’t match the quality of those 
in Taiwan. 
While Taiwan’s semiconductor indus-
try is second to none, American mar-
kets have experienced a surge in pri-
vate sector investment and domestic 
production. 
In the past year alone, private sector 
investment in domestic semiconductor 
manufacturing increased to $127 bil-
lion, with all signs indicating contin-
ued growth and investment in the 
years to come here in the United 
States. 
And that is the way growth and inno-
vation should happen, through the pri-
vate sector, not Federal funding. Con-
tinued reliance on offshore suppliers 
for these chips poses too great a threat 
and risk to the supply chains from the 
CCP. 
As we saw with Putin in the years 
prior to his invasion of Ukraine, Chi-
nese leaders are clear about their plans 
for Taiwan. 
Just last year, the CCP warned of 
‘‘drastic measures’’ if Taiwan declares 
independence. Taiwan is independent. 
Beijing refuses to recognize and reckon 
with reality. 
To deter Chinese aggression, the 
United States must have our forces in 
the Pacific modernized and ready at 
any time. That is why it was a major 
win that last year’s NDAA secured 
funding for a robust missile defense 
system for Guam to counter CCP- 
launched cruise or ballistic missiles. 
Guam is our first line of defense from 
these, home to 160,000 Americans who 
are forward-deployed to defend the 
west coast and our country. Guam is 
the first island to defend. 
However, as the CCP has continued 
to grow its military capabilities over 
the last decade, our own military has 
been hampered by cuts to defense 
spending, leaving our artillery anti-
quated and our defense capabilities 
weakened. 
President Biden has been no dif-
ferent, offering up disappointing cuts 
to defense priorities in both of his first 
two budgets. These cuts most certainly 
caught the attention of our adver-
saries. This is yet another example of 
how sorely out of touch with reality 
the Biden administration is when it 
comes to defense. We cannot—we can-
not—continue to ask our men and 
women in uniform to do more with 
less, especially with China watching 
everything that we do. 
While the world focuses on Eastern 
Europe, we must remain focused on 
Beijing. China is watching every move 
we make with regard to Putin, and 
they are taking notes. 
We cannot allow Vladimir Putin’s 
war to set a dangerous precedent. We 
must not make the same mistakes with 
Taiwan that the administration made 
with Ukraine, and that begins by send-
ing a strong, clear message to our al-
lies and adversaries that America will 
always be the world’s most foremost 
superpower. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2013 
April 6, 2022 
record gas prices at the pumps were 
even here that we are seeing today— 
the biggest decline in satisfaction sat 
squarely with energy policies. In fact, 
only 27 percent of Americans said they 
were satisfied with his energy policies. 
But, if you ask the Biden administra-
tion and congressional Democrats, who 
seem more interested in finger-point-
ing than in finding solutions, the cul-
prit changes on a nearly daily basis. 
First, it was OPEC+ not producing 
enough oil. Then it was the evil cor-
porations’ price gouging at the expense 
of hard-working American families. 
Then it was Vladimir Putin’s fault 
with his invasion of Ukraine. Now, it is 
oil and gas companies sitting on 9,000 
leases. Of course, we have come back 
around today to those greedy oil com-
panies again. 
But the 9,000 leases is where I want to 
spend a little time today and explain 
the problem with the claim of the 9,000 
leases. Let’s drill deeper—if you will 
excuse the expression—into that num-
ber to truly understand what is going 
on here and why this type of rebuttal 
argument does a total disservice to the 
American people and our allies abroad. 
The first and most fundamental mis-
take that White House spokesperson 
Ms. Psaki has made is in using the 
words ‘‘lease’’ and ‘‘permit’’ inter-
changeably. ‘‘Lease’’ and ‘‘permit’’ are 
not the same thing. They are not syn-
onymous other than that both are reg-
ulatory hurdles required by the Federal 
Government for a producer to work on 
Federal lands. 
Second, it is important to understand 
the vast majority—in fact, two-thirds— 
of oil and gas leases on Federal lands 
are producing. There are 35,871 total oil 
and gas leases in effect, with about 66 
percent of them producing oil or gas. 
The rest are going through this abused 
regulatory process or are being held up 
in litigation by environmental NGOs. 
In fact, over 2,200 of the leases are cur-
rently in litigation, and if there is one 
thing that liberals love more than reg-
ulation, it is litigation. 
Third, a lease does not mean the 
rented land contains oil and gas. Not 
all 9,000 of these leases ‘‘not being 
used’’ even contain oil and gas. Pro-
ducers first have to perform explor-
atory work to discover whether their 
leases even contain the minerals that 
they are after. Oil and gas producers 
procure multiple leases because they 
need to mitigate the financial damage 
which could result from acquiring only 
dry leases. It is called a robust port-
folio, a comprehensive portfolio. 
Fourth, before any development on 
leases can occur, producers and Agen-
cies must navigate this bureaucratic 
maze—this labyrinth of permitting and 
environmental laws covered by the En-
dangered Species Act, the National 
Historic Preservation Act, and the Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act, just 
to name a few, which can take years to 
complete. Rarely, do these things all 
get done at the same time. They are 
never done simultaneously but, rather, 
consecutively. They each take the 
number of days they need apart from 
one another rather than all together. 
Fifth, just because a producer ob-
tains a lease and navigates the regu-
latory hurdles required to permit a 
well does not mean they can begin ex-
traction. They must first secure ad-
joining leases for horizontal drilling. 
You don’t just drill a hole straight 
down 
anymore 
and 
suck 
the 
oil 
straight up from one silo. You have to 
get leases from the neighborhood. They 
must secure these leases and then ac-
crue the capital to finance mineral de-
velopment. It is not done for free, and 
it is not going to be done cheaply. They 
have to schedule the rigs, construct ac-
cess roads, obtain pipeline rights-of- 
way, establish infrastructure to cap-
ture the natural gas, and hire capable 
workers. All of these steps have been 
delayed by the administration’s road-
blocks and Biden’s supply chain and 
labor crisis. 
Finally, after obtaining an adequate 
number of leases clearing all of the 
regulatory hurdles and planning the lo-
gistics of the projects, a company must 
obtain an approved application for a 
permit to drill, otherwise known as an 
APD. There are currently 4,604 Federal 
APDs awaiting approval from the Bu-
reau of Land Management, BLM, and 
another 162 APDs on Indian land. 
The 
Biden 
administration’s 
BLM 
could approve these permits now and 
enable companies to move forward with 
the development to supply much need-
ed domestic energy at home and 
abroad. However, the BLM is approving 
them at the slowest rate since the 
Obama administration—a fact that Ms. 
Psaki conveniently leaves out when 
she claims President Biden is doing ev-
erything possible to lower gas prices. 
In fact, to this specific point, the Bu-
reau of Land Management has State of-
fices in places like Dickinson, ND. 
They have regional offices in places 
like Billings, MT. That is where the de-
cisions have been made as to whether 
the application for a permit to drill be-
comes a permit to drill—until this ad-
ministration. They changed that and 
gave the final authority not to Dickin-
son, ND, and not to Billings, MT, but 
rather to Washington, DC—at the very 
height of power. In fact, it goes all the 
way to the Deputy Secretary of the In-
terior. 
Now let’s look at some of the data on 
APDs, applications for permits to drill, 
and the timelines. 
In March of 2020, the BLM testified in 
front of the House Natural Resources 
Committee about the Trump adminis-
tration’s efforts to improve oil and gas 
permitting processes. In fiscal year 
2019, the BLM approved 3,741 APDs on 
Federal and Indian lands. The average 
APD processing time for a single appli-
cation dropped from 139 days in fiscal 
year 2016 to just 44 days in fiscal year 
2019. In fiscal year 2021, which included 
4 months of the Trump administration, 
APD approval times shot back up to 89 
days, doubling the amount of time. 
This is yet another example of the 
Trump administration’s energy success 
being eliminated by the Biden adminis-
tration’s incompetence. 
The Biden administration approved 
just 97 permits for oil and natural gas 
wells across Federal lands in January 
of this year—a significant plunge from 
the 643 issued in April of last year. All 
of the leases in the world don’t matter 
if you can’t get a permit to drill on 
them even if, in fact, there is oil—and 
you don’t even know that for sure. 
On top of the regulatory hurdles, in-
dustry considerations, supply chain 
issues, and labor shortages, producers 
must have certainty that their prod-
ucts can reach the global market. A 
key aspect of reaching the global mar-
ket, of course, and reducing the Euro-
pean Union’s reliance on dirty Russian 
gas are the U.S. liquefied natural gas 
terminals, or LNG export terminals. 
As of March 16, 2022, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Energy had 16 applications 
pending or under review for increasing 
U.S. 
LNG 
exports. 
If 
Secretary 
Granholm were to sign off on or were 
to streamline the review of these appli-
cations, we could increase our export 
capacity to help our allies abroad and 
grow our economy right here at home. 
The Biden administration has ex-
tended its onshore and offshore oil and 
gas leasing ban quarter after quarter 
despite being required by the Mineral 
Leasing Act to conduct quarterly lease 
sales. At this point in the Obama ad-
ministration, they had held 35 onshore 
lease sales—35 under Barack Obama— 
and that is not all. 
The Biden administration is actively 
working to starve the fossil fuel indus-
try of financial capital in order to push 
them out of existence. That is right. 
They keep talking about the supply 
and the demand; yet they crush the 
supply by starving it of the capital 
that it needs. This is capital-intensive 
stuff. 
In March, the Securities and Ex-
change Commission released a pro-
posed rule on climate disclosure—cli-
mate disclosure. This authority of forc-
ing publicly traded companies to de-
velop and disclose their risks from cli-
mate change is not in the purview of 
the SEC. They don’t have the author-
ity to do that. Congress has never 
passed a law granting them new au-
thority in this space. It only serves to 
further discourage investment in do-
mestic energy development and to pre-
vent American energy independence, a 
critical tool for peace and the reduc-
tion of global emissions. 
Now, isn’t that ironic? 
The Biden administration is suc-
ceeding in its mission to destroy any 
chance to once again be energy inde-
pendent. Their radical nominees, ac-
tions in the courtroom, regulatory 
schemes, budget proposals, and foot- 
dragging exude hostility toward fossil 
fuels, inflicting a distinct chilling ef-
fect on the oil and gas industry.

ducers in North Dakota, and they are

capital-starved. If the right messages 
were being sent to the markets, we 
could pick up another 200,000 to 400,000 
barrels of oil per day. In January of 
2022—this 
year—North 
Dakota 
pro-
duced 1.1 million barrels per day. To 
put this in context, Europe imports 2.3 
million barrels per day from Russia. At 
North Dakota’s peak, we produced 1.5 
million barrels per day. North Dakota 
alone could provide two-thirds of the 
product Europe imports from Russia. It 
would be cleaner than Russian oil, and 
it would lessen Putin’s malign leverage 
over Europe and, really, the rest of the 
world. 
Investors in domestic oil and gas 
have to receive the right market sig-
nals in order to invest their capital. 
The administration seems to believe 
energy production is simply a switch 
you turn on or a valve you turn when 
you need it. Then, if you don’t need it, 
you just turn it off—no harm, no foul. 
It is very capital-intensive, as I said, 
and it is reliant on regulatory cer-
tainty. I am not talking about 6 days of 
certainty or 6 months of certainty but 
more like 6 years of certainty. No sane 
energy CEO would invest millions or 
billions of dollars in a project with the 
backdrop of an administration that is 
seeking to ‘‘transition’’ them out of ex-
istence within months. 
Let’s take a walk down memory lane 
on some of the signals this administra-
tion has sent to the industry. 
First, the President himself said dur-
ing a campaign stop in 2019: 
I guarantee you, I guarantee you we are 
going to end fossil fuel, and I am not going 
to cooperate with them. 
Well, congratulations, Mr. President. 
You kept the promise. 
Secretary Granholm appeared in a 
video and called for leaving fossil fuels 
‘‘in the ground,’’ she said. She then 
spoke to reporters at the Energy and 
Environmental 
Research 
Center 
in 
Grand Forks, ND. It is an exceptional 
organization at the forefront of pro-
moting carbon capture and other inno-
vative solutions to reduce CO2 emis-
sions. 
During 
her 
comments, 
she 
pro-
claimed the United States doesn’t—get 
this now. The Secretary of Energy pro-
claimed, We don’t have ‘‘much moral 
authority’’ to criticize China over its 
emissions. We, the United States of 
America, don’t have moral authority 
over China? 
Really, Madam Secretary? That is 
what you believe about the country 
you serve? 
How about the climate czar John 
Kerry? He flies around the world while 
making outlandish comments like ‘‘the 
United States won’t have coal in 2030,’’ 
and he discourages the world from buy-
ing our products—U.S. energy—while 
fanning the flames of radicalism and 
proclaiming Ukrainian war refugees 
are nothing compared to climate refu-
gees. It is like he is the bishop of the 
Church of Climatology or something. 
He has even expressed concern that the 
pesky war crimes that are going on 
over there by Vladimir Putin are tak-
ing the focus away from the real trag-
edy: climate change. Then he gets in 
his jet and flies home. 
Meanwhile, recent reports indicate 
the administration has turned to des-
pots, like Iran and Venezuela, instead 
of to producers right here in America 
in order to help bring the Biden infla-
tion under control by producing more 
of their dirty oil instead of our cleaner 
production. It makes no sense, and it is 
offensive to every American worker. 
We have a geopolitical opportunity 
right now to cut Putin’s malign influ-
ence, and we should be taking full ad-
vantage of it. What we ought to be 
doing is encouraging production not 
just with our rhetoric but with our ac-
tions. Producing more U.S. oil and gas 
will—believe it or not, proclaim it or 
deny it as it is the truth—will reduce 
global greenhouse gas emissions. 
Now, if you don’t want to take my 
word for it or trust the extensive stud-
ies, science, and documentation of this 
fact, Biden EPA Administrator Michael 
Regan, just last week, told the Finan-
cial Times that recent calls for in-
creased oil output are compatible—get 
this now, this is from Biden EPA Ad-
ministrator Regan—with goals to cut 
CO2 emissions. 
In fact, he specifically said: 
These are not mutually exclusive goals. 
Administrator 
Regan 
is 
exactly 
right. Producing more U.S. oil and gas 
will reduce the West’s reliance on dirti-
er fuels from our adversaries. Doing so 
also avoids unilaterally disarming our 
economy and losing ourselves to a 2050 
fantasy that has come straight up to 
being a 2022 reality. Some in the Biden 
administration may finally be starting 
to understand: Energy security is na-
tional security and economic security. 
And so I say: Let’s make the world 
safer, let’s make the world cleaner, and 
let’s unleash American energy produc-
tion. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The Senator from Flor-
ida. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
in my 8 years as Governor, I had the 
opportunity to appoint more than 400 
Floridians to the bench. I interviewed 
thousands of applicants for these seats, 
and my standards in each of those 
interviews were the same. I asked them 
if they understood that they intended 
to be part of the judiciary and not part 
of the legislature. And I asked them if 
they intended to interpret the law and 
enforce the law but not make new laws. 
If they couldn’t convince me that they 
believed that was their duty as a mem-
ber of the judicial branch, then I 
wouldn’t appoint them. 
We need qualified jurists committed 
to fairly and accurately interpreting 
our Constitution and our laws as they 
are written, not activist judges who 
will rewrite the laws according to their 
own policy preferences. 
Now, I have had the chance to meet 
with Judge Jackson. We had a nice 
conversation, and she seems like a nice 
person. But I have very serious con-
cerns about her record as a Federal 
judge, which includes numerous in-
stances of the type of judicial activism 
that we cannot and should not tolerate 
from the Federal judiciary. 
The fact is that Judge Jackson has 
written only two appellate opinions in 
her current position. So we have no 
evidence of how she will approach seri-
ous constitutional issues as an appel-
late judge. And she has refused to dis-
close how she would interpret the Con-
stitution as a Supreme Court Justice, 
despite being repeatedly and directly 
asked by Senators on the Judiciary 
Committee. 
And while serving as a district court 
judge, she had a high rate of being re-
versed on appeal for applying the 
wrong legal standards, exceeding her 
authority, or simply ignoring clear law 
in her decisions. 
And a peek into her history shows an 
alarming pattern of being weak on sex 
offenders, including easier sentences in 
child pornography cases. Judge Jack-
son imposed sentences that were 47 per-
cent shorter than the national average 
in cases of child pornography distribu-
tion, and 57 percent shorter than the 
national average in cases of child por-
nography possession. She has even 
apologized from the bench when issuing 
such sentences—not to the victims of 
those heinous crimes. Of course, they 
never got an apology. She apologized to 
the offenders for the ‘‘anguish’’ the 
sentences for their horrific crimes 
would cause them. 
What about the anguish of their vic-
tims—innocent children? 
These are individuals who harm chil-
dren. They don’t deserve easy sen-
tences or our sympathies. 
And this sympathy for child preda-
tors has consequences. We recently 
learned that a child rapist, someone to 
whom Judge Jackson gave a very le-
nient sentence, sexually abused an-
other victim after his light sentence. 
Had Judge Jackson given him the sen-
tence he deserved and the one that the 
prosecution recommended, he would 
have been in prison, not out in the 
streets. 
These are crimes that Judge Jackson 
has the power to prevent, but she has 
chosen every time to give these gross 
criminals easier sentences. That is why 
I have joined Senator HAWLEY to intro-
duce the Protect Act, which protects 
children from sexual exploitation by 
enhancing the penalties for possessing 
child 
pornography 
and 
preventing 
judges from sentencing offenders below 
Federal guidelines. Our communities 
must be protected from sick individ-
uals who exploit and victimize chil-
dren, and also from liberal activist 
judges who abuse their sentencing 
guidelines to let offenders off the hook. 
Federal sentencing guidelines for these 
heinous crimes are critical, and we

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2015 
April 6, 2022 
must ensure guidelines are strictly en-
forced. I hope the Senate quickly 
passes this good bill. 
We can’t have a soft-on-crime Justice 
on the Supreme Court, and we can’t 
have activist judges in the highest 
Court in the land. 
I also don’t think it is too much for 
the nominee to the highest Court in 
the land to be able to say what a 
woman is or to take a stand against 
partisan Court packing, which even lib-
eral Justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
and Stephen Breyer have done. We 
have the right to be concerned and de-
mand answers on behalf of the Amer-
ican people. I think our country de-
serves better. 
That is why I can’t support the nomi-
nation of Judge Jackson to the Su-
preme Court. I am committed to giving 
the American people qualified judges 
who understand their role in govern-
ment and who apply the law as it is 
written, not as they want it to be. It is 
a simple standard, and it is one that 
Floridians 
expect. 
Unfortunately, 
based on my best assessment of her 
record on the bench, that is unfortu-
nately not the case with Judge Jack-
son. 
The Democratic Party needs to un-
derstand that the Supreme Court is not 
just another institution to infiltrate 
with their leftist ideology. I have no 
hope that they will, but, until they do, 
I will continue fighting to uphold the 
Constitution and ensure that there re-
mains a separation of powers between 
branches of Government, and that 
judges who are appointed to the bench 
understand that they are there to in-
terpret the law, not to make the law. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, through-
out 2 days of questioning in front of 
the Judiciary Committee on which I 
sit, Judge Jackson proved, without a 
shadow of a doubt, what we all knew to 
be true: She is eminently qualified to 
serve on the Supreme Court of our 
country. 
Judge Jackson has the intellect, the 
integrity, and the temperament befit-
ting an Associate Justice of the U.S. 
Supreme Court, and she doesn’t have 
an ideological axe to grind. Judge 
Jackson is exceptionally qualified and 
well regarded across the political spec-
trum. 
And yet not a single Republican 
voted to advance Judge Jackson’s nom-
ination out of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, and only three Republicans 
have publicly expressed support for 
her. 
So I ask my Republican colleagues: 
What is it going to take? What is it 
going to take to put politics aside to 
support a nominee like Judge Jackson? 
Because, clearly, intelligence, extraor-
dinary breadth of experience, and sup-
port from prominent conservatives— 
conservatives—did not suffice. Clearly, 
a candidate who has support from orga-
nizations from across the political 
spectrum—from the Black and His-
panic U.S. Chambers of Commerce to 
the National Education Association, 
with thousands of teachers; to the Fra-
ternal Order of Police, the largest po-
lice union—they would not be sup-
porting somebody who is soft on 
crime—to child advocacy groups that 
would not be supporting her, either, if 
she was not being appropriate in her 
sentencing of child pornography de-
fendants. So even with this breadth of 
support, she didn’t make the cut with 
the Republicans on the Judiciary Com-
mittee. So, clearly, a nominee who was 
uniformly called ‘‘brilliant,’’ ‘‘beyond 
reproach,’’ ‘‘first rate,’’ and ‘‘impec-
cable’’ by her colleagues across the Na-
tion was not enough. 
So, truly, what will it take? 
Sadly, some of my Republican col-
leagues resorted to unfounded and mis-
leading attacks in an unsuccessful at-
tempt to smear her character. To high-
light 
how 
ridiculous 
the 
attacks 
around the sentencing of child pornog-
raphy offenses were, I asked Judge 
Jackson about the history of the sen-
tencing guidelines for these crimes and 
the concerns that these guidelines do 
not reflect what is happening with 
child pornography offenses. 
And these facts bear repeating. A 
decade ago, the U.S. Sentencing Com-
mission first addressed the issue of sen-
tencing in this area. Even way back 
then, only 40 percent of convicted of-
fenders were receiving sentences within 
the guidelines. Now, 10 years later, 
even fewer offenders are receiving sen-
tences within the guidelines. In 2019, 
just 30 percent of non-production of-
fenders were sentenced within the 
guidelines. In the DC Circuit, in which 
Jackson served, the average goes down 
to just 20 percent of offenders. This 
puts Judge Jackson well within the 
mainstream in her sentencing in this 
area. She is not an outsider. 
I named numerous other judges nom-
inated by President Trump and sup-
ported by the Republicans on the Judi-
ciary Committee who have also sen-
tenced offenders to sentences well 
below the sentencing guidelines. So 
these judges also expressed concern 
about how the sentencing guidelines do 
not reflect the circumstances in the 
child pornography cases of today. 
I will repeat this. Judge Jackson is a 
mainstream judge. She has issued deci-
sions and sentences similar to other 
judges across the Nation, including 
those nominated by both Republicans 
and Democratic Presidents. Despite 
some of my Republican colleagues’ at-
tempts to distort the truth to get more 
likes on Twitter, what Americans 
across the country saw was an incred-
ibly impressive, highly qualified indi-
vidual demonstrate that she has the in-
tellect and the temperament to serve 
on our highest Court. Throughout the 
course of this week, Americans also 
learned about her character. 
I was particularly moved to hear the 
testimony of an individual who has 
known Judge Jackson for nearly 38 
years—when they were in elementary 
school. He said, in part: 
Ketanji’s incandescent brilliance was obvi-
ous to all of us from day one. But even more 
importantly, she has always been one of the 
kindest, warmest, most humble and down-to- 
earth people I have ever met. All this, while 
still possessing boundless charisma, drive, 
maturity, and grace. 
These qualities, apparently from a 
young age, have clearly guided her 
throughout her life and her career, par-
ticularly when it comes to treating 
every single person she encounters 
with dignity and respect. 
During the hearing, I asked Judge 
Jackson the same two questions on 
sexual assault and harassment that I 
ask of all nominees—male and female. 
In follow-up questioning, I named 
judges who had committed such mis-
conduct and asked Judge Jackson what 
she does to ensure her court is a safe 
and inclusive place to work. After 
Judge Jackson’s hearing concluded, a 
woman who had clerked for one of the 
judges I named who had engaged in this 
kind of harassing behavior reached out 
to me. And this is a person who had 
clerked for one of the judges that I had 
named. During her clerkship with this 
judge, she endured extreme and perva-
sive sexual harassment. She came forth 
publicly about this judge’s conduct, an 
experience 
she 
described 
as 
‘‘a 
harrowing ordeal.’’ 
She went on to a second clerkship, 
this time for Judge Jackson. In Judge 
Jackson’s court, she said, she was 
treated like a valued and talented em-
ployee who could make meaningful 
contributions to the law. She says 
clerking for Judge Jackson was the 
most meaningful professional experi-
ence she has ever had. She stated: 
Judge Jackson is the reason I am still a 
lawyer. I have no doubt I would have left the 
profession were it not for the way she treat-
ed me the year after my ordeal. 
Judge Jackson is exactly the kind of 
judge and individual we need on the 
U.S. Supreme Court: experienced, even-
handed, with dignity, integrity, and 
humanity. Moreover, Judge Jackson is 
not just extremely qualified to serve on 
the Supreme Court; her nomination is 
a historic one. 
The Supreme Court has existed for 
over 233 years, and of the 115 Justices 
in the history of the Court, only 5 of 
them have been women, only 2 have 
been Black, and not a single one has 
been a Black woman. This is the Court 
that has decided cases that have had 
sweeping impacts on our lives, includ-
ing decisions that have solidified rights 
for LGBTQ-plus people, empowered 
women, 
strengthened 
unions, 
and 
more. But this is also the same Court 
that has throughout the course of his-
tory upheld slavery, Jim Crow, and the 
unlawful 
internment—incarceration— 
of Japanese Americans in World War II. 
So it is about time. It is about time 
we have a highly qualified, highly ac-
complished Black woman on the Su-
preme Court. It is about time our high-
est Court better reflects the country it

serves. It is about time that Black 
women and girls across the country 
can finally see someone who looks like 
them sitting on the highest Court, 
making decisions that will impact 
their lives—our lives. And they will 
know that the possibility is there for 
them. 
I close by noting that during the 
hearing, Judge Jackson told the com-
mittee that as a freshman at Harvard, 
she wondered whether she could fit in 
or whether she could make it, and a 
Black woman she didn’t know leaned 
into her as they were walking by, prob-
ably in Harvard Yard, and said to 
Judge Jackson—she wasn’t a judge 
then: ‘‘Persevere.’’ That is something 
that a lot of us can relate to: persever-
ance, including myself, who came to 
this country as a poor immigrant kid, 
persevering to learn the language, to 
learn the culture of a country I knew 
nothing about. Judge Jackson being on 
the Supreme Court would send such a 
powerful message of perseverance to 
everyone in this country. 
I will be honored to vote to confirm 
Judge Jackson. I look forward to call-
ing her Justice Jackson.

UNIVERSITY 
OF 
KANSAS JAYHAWKS MEN’S BAS-
KETBALL TEAM FOR WINNING 
THE 2022 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE 
ATHLETIC 
ASSOCIATION 
BAS-
KETBALL NATIONAL CHAMPION-
SHIP 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I am on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate today to 
congratulate and to commend the Uni-
versity of Kansas men’s basketball 
team on its national championship vic-
tory. This is KU’s fourth NCAA na-
tional championship title, the second 
under the tenure of Hall of Fame Head 
Coach Bill Self. 
The University of Kansas’s men’s 
basketball program boasts a storied 
history and track record of excellence 
and success, and the inventor of the 
game 
of 
basketball, 
Dr. 
James 
Naismith, served as the program’s first 
coach. 
KU can also now boast having the 
most NCAA victories of any Division I 
basketball program in the country in 
addition 
to 
now 
four—four—NCAA 
championships. 
It is moments like this that Kansans 
remember forever. Whether you are 
watching the game from your living 
room, on the jumbotron at Allen Field-
house, or from your favorite hangout 
on Mass Street, 10, 20, 30 years from 
now, Kansans from across the country 
will remember where they were on 
April 4, 2022, when KU clinched the na-
tional title in a nail-biting game 
against North Carolina’s Tar Heels. 
It was the KU men’s basketball team 
that inspired me to go to the Univer-
sity of Kansas when I was in high 
school. I am a first-generation college 
graduate, and the University of Kansas 
was probably not the place that most 
of my peers and friends from my small 
town in Northwest Kansas went to. 
But, no, it wasn’t because I was re-
cruited to play basketball for the bas-
ketball team; it was that I had the op-
portunity to attend on my first visit to 
the University of Kansas a basketball 
game in Allen Fieldhouse. From that 
one game, I knew this was where I 
wanted to go to college. The energy 
and excitement of KU basketball in-
spired me, encouraged me, caused me 
to wonder—and I think it is true of 
countless others, to decide they wanted 
to be a Jayhawk. 
On Monday night, KU rallied to over-
come a deficit of 15 points at halftime 
to beat North Carolina 72 to 69—the 
largest comeback in an NCAA basket-
ball national championship game. I am 
not sure what Coach Bill Self—but I 
am going to ask him—I am not sure 
what Coach Self said to his players in 
the locker room during that halftime, 
but in true Kansas fashion, the KU 
Jayhawks came back and beat the odds 
to clinch the championship. The team 
showed tremendous heart, determina-
tion, and resolve in that comeback vic-
tory. 
KU’s Ochai Agbaji scored 12 points 
and was named ‘‘Most Outstanding 
Player’’ of the Final Four. 
Kansas forward David McCormack 
scored 15 points and had 10 rebounds 
and made 2 critical baskets late in the 
game. 
Kansas forward Jalen Wilson scored 
15 points and had 4 rebounds. 
Kansas guard Remy Martin contrib-
uted 14 points to help the Jayhawks se-
cure the title. 
Kansas guard Christian Braun of Bur-
lington, KS—a smalltown, middle-of- 
the-State native—scored 12 points and 
had 12 rebounds, demonstrating to 
other smalltown athletes like him that 
they, too, could be a star in the Na-
tion’s biggest tournament in college 
basketball. 
Jordan Juenemann, a former walk-on 
for the Jayhawks men’s basketball 
team from my hometown of Hays, 
noted that this 2022 championship team 
might not be the best according to the 
stats, but they played like a team. 
They care about the game, and they 
care about each other. Only a team 
that sees the glass half full could come 
back after being down 16 points and 
clinch the victory. This speaks to the 
team’s 
perseverance 
and 
belief 
in 
themselves. 
Coach Keith Riley, a basketball 
coach from Hill City, KS, in the west-
ern part of our State—I visited with 
him the other day, and he pointed out 
to me the lesson that kids around the 
State will take away from Monday 
night: You may not always have all of 
the best players on the court at the 
same time, and you may not have all 
the talent that is out there on that 
court, but you can still find ways to be 
successful because of how hard you 
work. 
My guess is that kids, ever since 
Monday, back home in Kansas and 
maybe across the country, are in their 
driveway, they are at the school bas-
ketball court, and they are shooting 
free throws or 3-point shots one after 
another. It inspires us to know that we 
can do more, and the University of 
Kansas basketball team is inspiring 
kids today to go out and work harder. 
I commend these players and the en-
tire Kansas Jayhawks men’s basketball 
team, as well as the coaches and staff, 
for their hard work which culminated 
in this victory. 
While these young men on the team 
may be known for their talent on the 
court, many should be recognized for 
the adversity they faced off court. 
Dajuan Harris, KU’s point guard, has 
overcome tremendous loss in his 21 
years. He lost both his father and his 
brother just a few years apart, and 
Sunday night, he came out and he 
played for them. 
These young men came to college to 
play some great basketball, but along 
the way, they are learning how to give 
back to their community. At Christ-
mastime, this team goes to the local 
Walmart and purchases Christmas pre-
sents for families who might be facing 
financial hardship. They learn the im-
portant lesson of giving back to their 
community. 
Finally, to Coach Bill Self, I know 
you are probably still feeling that very 
deep loss—and maybe even more so on 
Monday night—of your father, who 
died just recently—Bill Self, Sr.—but 
you can be sure he is smiling down 
with pride on you and your whole 
team. You took his advice. He advised 
you: 
Don’t worry about the mules, just load the 
wagon. 
As a graduate of the University of 
Kansas, as a Kansan, I share the excite-
ment of Jayhawks fans across the 
world 
in 
Sunday 
night’s 
stunning 
achievement, and I am pleased to in-
troduce this resolution with Senator 
MARSHALL to honor this achievement. 
To 
my 
fellow 
Jayhawks, 
‘‘Rock 
Chalk.’’ 
Mr. President, I am pleased that on 
such a bipartisan basis, in cooperation 
between Republicans and Democrats— 
something I know Kansans and Ameri-
cans don’t see enough of—this resolu-
tion normally would take a few more 
days than it has taken to get to the 
U.S. Senate this week. I am pleased 
that both the Republican and Demo-
crat leadership and their staff worked 
with us in cooperation to be able to 
commend the Jayhawks this early this

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
stand here to proudly support Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination 
to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The Nation has had the opportunity 
to watch Judge Jackson during her 
confirmation hearing 2 weeks ago and 
see firsthand the temperament, knowl-
edge of the law, and qualifications she 
brings to the highest Court in the land. 
She will be a fair and impartial jurist, 
just as she has proven herself to be on 
the district court and on the DC Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals. 
President Biden made a commitment 
before he was elected to appoint the 
first Black woman to the Supreme 
Court. Judge Jackson’s historic nomi-
nation is long overdue. 
It was in my home State of New York 
where Constance Baker Motley became 
the first Black woman to be a Federal 
judge—in the Southern District. 
Having diverse representation on the 
Court does not mean someone will rule 
a certain way, and it doesn’t mean that 
is why they deserve to be on the Bench. 
It is important because it strengthens 
our institutions. It is critical because 
it shows who we are as a nation, and it 
makes a difference to the girls and 
women across the country, who will 
now have a role model and know that 
they can aspire to do the same. 
That is why President Biden made 
that promise because he knew that it 
was beyond time to ensure the Su-
preme Court has that representation; 
and it is clear that Judge Jackson will 
be a highly qualified Justice to fulfill 
that promise. 
Who we confirm to the Supreme 
Court matters. While the work of the 
Court may feel distant from our daily 
decisions and day-to-day lives, the Su-
preme Court actually makes key deci-
sions on whether individuals are pro-
tected when they go to school, work, or 
out in public; on who can and how we 
can cast our votes to determine our 
elected officials; on whether our future 
generations will have clean air to 
breathe, clean water to drink; on who 
we can choose to marry; and on what 
decisions women can make about their 
own bodies and their reproductive fu-
ture. 
The nine Justices on the Supreme 
Court make important decisions that 
impact all Americans; and in the Sen-
ate, in our advice and consent role, we 
have a critical role to play in ensuring 
that we confirm Justices who follow 
the rule of law and provide equal jus-
tice to all. 
The perspectives Judge Jackson will 
bring to the highest Court of the land, 
both personally and professionally, will 
have a critical impact on all Ameri-
cans. Judge Jackson will bring to the 
Bench significant criminal defense ex-
perience as a former public defender. 
She will also bring nearly a decade of 
judicial experience to her rulings. 
When I met Judge Jackson, I asked 
her which of her experiences have pre-
pared her most for this moment to 
serve on the Supreme Court if she was 
confirmed. She answered by talking 
about her clerkships, which she com-
pleted at each level of the judiciary: 
the district court; First Circuit Court 
of Appeals; and for Supreme Court Jus-
tice Breyer, whose seat she is being 
nominated to fill. She talked about 
how she learned from others how to 
serve as a judge. She experienced first-
hand what it means to fulfill the con-
stitutional requirement of being a 
member of our Nation’s Federal judici-
ary. 
I know that Judge Jackson will bring 
all of those perspectives and meaning-
ful experiences with her to the Su-
preme Court, and those are critically 
needed on the highest Court of our 
land. It is those experiences and her 
record that have led to Judge Jack-
son’s nomination receiving broad sup-
port—from the civil and human rights 
community to the law enforcement 
community and from colleagues in the 
judiciary nominated by Presidents of 
both parties, to name just a few. Given 
the fact that she was confirmed three 
times before this body with bipartisan 
support, the Senate should be able to 
once again confirm her with votes from 
my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle. 
I look forward to enthusiastically 
casting my vote in support of Judge 
Jackson’s confirmation to the Supreme 
Court of the United States. I urge my 
colleagues to join me and support her 
nomination as well. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
have come to the floor today to go into 
a little bit more detail about why I will 
not be voting for and in favor of Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation 
to the Supreme Court. 
Now, as we have all heard and as we 
appreciate, there is no doubt that 
Judge Jackson is highly educated; she 
has an impressive resume; she is cor-
dial; she was very gracious with her 
time, but as I listened to her responses 
over a 2-day period of time, I was really 
dissatisfied with the specifics. 
As I got home to Tennessee and 
talked to Tennesseans, they had want-
ed to hear specifics from her and were 
disappointed that she did not come for-
ward with those specifics. 
My colleague Senator DURBIN, help-
fully, pointed out this morning that 
Judge Jackson did, indeed, make the 
rounds up here prior to her hearing. 
Yes, indeed, she did do that. She came 
to my office, and we spent about an 
hour together talking about her record. 
I, of course, didn’t give her a list of 
questions to study, but I did clue her in 
on some of the things that I thought 
were going to be important for us to 
discuss. 
Some are items we had discussed 
when she came before us for her appel-
late court hearing. Some of those 
things we never got a complete answer 
to, but we needed to get that complete 
answer. This is a lifetime appointment, 
and it was disappointing that we did 
not, even now, get that complete an-
swer. 
What I have learned is, normally—as 
we at Judiciary Committee conduct 
these hearings for judges for the Fed-
eral bench, for Supreme Court nomi-
nees—they walk into the hearing room, 
and they are prepared. They kind of 
come loaded with their remarks and 
their answers. They have a general idea 
of what is going to come their way 
from different ones of us because we 
have spent the time meeting with them 
individually, making certain that they 
know what is going to be important. 
So there is no doubt she knew that I 
was going to press her on her lack of a 
clear articulation on a judicial philos-
ophy, and she knew that there were 
concerns and criticisms of her record 
and some of the decisions that she had 
made. She knew that we would ask 
tough 
constitutional 
law 
questions 
about abortion, substantive due proc-
ess, and interstate commerce. 
And I know that I—and I think most 
of my colleagues on the Judiciary 
Committee—would say that I expect 
nominees to be familiar with all of 
these things, to have an opinion and be 
willing to share that opinion. This is 
an appointment, as I said a moment 
ago, a lifetime appointment to the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2018 
April 6, 2022 
highest Court in the land. This is not 
supposed to be an easy process. This is 
to be tough questions that are appro-
priately placed. You know, tough ques-
tions are not attacks. Tough questions 
are placed in search of answers—an-
swers for the people we represent. But 
instead of showcasing what we were 
told was her extraordinary prowess for 
the 
law, 
Judge 
Jackson’s 
hearing 
turned into a showcase of things that 
she just did not want to talk about. 
My Democratic colleagues have spent 
a lot of time trying to provide cover for 
her, but the fact of the matter is that 
at the end of this week, the majority 
leader will ask us to green-light a Su-
preme Court nominee who has not ar-
ticulated a judicial philosophy, who 
filibustered her way through basic con-
stitutional questions, and who repeat-
edly pled ignorance of the most con-
troversial items in her record. 
We have received Judge Jackson’s re-
sponses to our written questions, and 
unfortunately she still is refusing to 
open a window into her thinking. 
I asked her again about her ruling in 
Make 
the 
Road 
New 
York 
v. 
McAleenan, which focused, in part, on 
how a judge should interpret a statute 
that 
grants 
an 
agency 
‘‘sole 
and 
unreviewable discretion’’ under the 
rules available. When Congress wrote 
those words, I am sure we believed that 
‘‘sole and unreviewable discretion’’ 
meant exactly, precisely that this law 
was sole and unreviewable. 
But rather than focusing on the plain 
meaning of the text, Judge Jackson 
took it upon herself to evaluate and re-
ject the DHS rule in question and es-
tablish a nationwide injunction. 
Well, as we all know, fortunately, the 
DC Circuit overruled her. But the ques-
tion remains: How in the world could 
any judge read those words and decide 
Congress wanted the opposite result of 
what Congress specifically said, ‘‘sole 
and unreviewable’’? 
But in a show of lack of respect for 
Congress and what Congress explicitly 
said because she disagreed with the 
policy, what did she do? She picked it 
up; she basically tore up that policy; 
and she did what she thought—what 
she thought—was best. 
In her written response, Judge Jack-
son offered no new information, but be-
cause she tends to editorialize in her 
opinions, we can still glean some in-
sight from what she had to say about 
the DHS case. She suggested that the 
Department of Homeland Security’s 
position was a ‘‘terrible proposal’’ that 
‘‘reeks of bad faith’’ and ‘‘demonstrates 
contempt for the authority that the 
Constitution’s Framers have vested in 
the judicial branch.’’ 
Those are her words. 
I think that language might give us a 
hint as to why she ignored the statu-
tory text. In Tennessee, Tennesseans 
look at that and say: Well, that is the 
work of an activist judge. They are try-
ing to legislate from the bench. They 
didn’t like what Congress did, so they 
said: We are going to pick it up; we are 
going to toss it out; we are going to do 
what we think that policy ought to be. 
That was the effect of that ruling be-
cause she ignored the statuary text. 
I have lingering questions about 
other times Judge Jackson has used 
this type of rhetoric to signal her pol-
icy disagreements. Again, Tennesseans 
say that is judicial activism. 
During the height of the COVID–19 
pandemic, she used a written judicial 
opinion to advocate for the mass re-
lease of all 1,500 criminals in the cus-
tody of the DC Department of Correc-
tions. That is right, the release of all 
1,561 detainees—all of them. 
During her hearing, she claimed she 
was merely repeating one of the attor-
ney’s arguments, but we went back and 
we read the opinion. And when we read 
the opinion, it is very clear: That was 
not accurate. 
If you take her words at face value, 
you will get the impression that she 
believes a mass release—a mass release 
of detainees, of criminals—a mass re-
lease is appropriate during the pan-
demic. So if you look at our past 
pandemics and if you say, ‘‘Well, a pan-
demic is going to come around; we are 
going to have something every 5 or 10 
years,’’ I think it is reasonable to ques-
tion her judgment on this. What hap-
pens when you have the next Spanish 
flu or the next SARS? What happens 
the next time there is a pandemic? I 
think American citizens, I think Ten-
nesseans want an answer on that. Why 
would someone think, ‘‘Open the doors 
and release them,’’ and then lament 
that they are not able to release all of 
them? 
I have questions about her record of 
being lenient with criminals. Over the 
course of her career, Judge Jackson 
has developed a disturbing habit of 
granting leniency to dangerous crimi-
nals. She released a man who murdered 
a U.S. marshal and gave a reduced sen-
tence to a criminal who was known for 
attacking police officers. She under-
sentenced child porn offenders at every 
available 
opportunity—not 
once 
or 
twice but every time. If the guidelines 
gave her discretion, she used it to go 
easy on pedophiles. 
She looked for ways to go easy on 
dangerous drug offenders and, at one 
point, she actually apologized to a self- 
described fentanyl ‘‘kingpin’’ for his 
harsh sentence. That is of concern. It is 
of concern to many moms whose top 
issues right now are inflation, open 
borders, crime in the streets. They are 
worried about that. They are worried 
about what is happening. 
She had the opportunity to clear this 
up, but at no point did she offer a reas-
suring explanation of why she so con-
sistently used her discretion to tip the 
scales not in favor of victims but tip-
ping those scales in favor of criminals. 
On this point, we are not questioning 
her methodology; we are questioning 
her judgment. 
When I was back home in Tennessee 
this weekend, everyone wanted to talk 
about Judge Jackson’s inability to de-
fine the word ‘‘woman.’’ 
The media has spent a great deal of 
time mocking that question, and I will 
tell you, that is quite all right because 
out there in the real world, people care 
about how she chose to respond to that 
question. Their position is that if the 
media felt justified in mocking the 
very fact that I did ask that question, 
why did Judge Jackson have so much 
trouble answering that question? As 
my colleague Senator CRUZ mentioned 
this morning, we have 
journalists 
today running around the Capitol, de-
manding that Republican Senators an-
swer the question. Why aren’t they 
asking the same of Judge Jackson? 
Every day, Tennesseans are subjected 
to this assault on common sense, and 
they are not interested in playing 
along with this. Why, they want to 
know, is the left so terrified to con-
front how the American people define 
the word ‘‘woman’’ and ‘‘womanhood’’? 
And why would my Democratic col-
leagues continue to prop up a nominee 
who squandered her hearing by dodging 
questions and claiming ignorance of 
her very own record? 
Tennesseans 
aren’t 
interested 
in 
playing politics. They just want the 
Democrats to reveal what rule book 
they are using because Tennesseans 
want to see constitutionalist judges on 
the bench. They want people to call 
balls and strikes. They want people 
who believe in equal treatment under 
the law, equal justice for all. 
They see what is happening in our 
country. It is frightening to them. For 
a long time now, radical activists have 
wanted to handpick a Supreme Court 
Justice. Some of these dark money 
groups that are all there helping the 
left, they said: Give us your money. We 
will make certain there are Federal 
judges and a Supreme Court Justice 
who are progressive. 
In the meantime, we have seen them 
make inroads in the media, on school 
boards, and in some of the country’s 
most respected universities. 
So Tennesseans are very familiar 
with what happens when activism be-
gins to replace common sense. They 
are very familiar with the tactics of 
the left that continue to try to dimin-
ish freedoms of individuals and give 
that power to the government. That is 
why they want constitutionalists on 
the Court, not activist judges who are 
there to take up arms in the culture 
war. They don’t want an agenda. They 
don’t want to hear about a method-
ology. They want proof that Judge 
Jackson has a vision for America that 
is rooted in the Constitution. They 
want to have proof that this is some-
body who believes in preserving our 
faith, our families, our freedoms, pre-
serving hope and opportunity for all. 
They want somebody who is going to 
say: I believe in the American dream, 
and I am going to preserve the right for 
every girl and boy to live their version 
of the American dream.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2019 
April 6, 2022 
Unfortunately, just like the Presi-
dent who nominated her, Judge Jack-
son has provided no evidence of that vi-
sion. I am a ‘‘no’’ vote on her confirma-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I 
have already announced that I intend 
to support Judge Jackson’s nomina-
tion. Her character and her qualifica-
tions are unassailable, but, unfortu-
nately, that hasn’t stopped a number of 
Senate Republicans from treating her 
disgracefully. Too often, behavior in 
the hearings was simply shameful. 
It doesn’t have to be this way, and it 
wasn’t always this way. For example, 
even though I disagreed with him on 
plenty of issues, I voted for Chief Jus-
tice John Roberts, and he was treated 
very fairly by Democrats. Serious ques-
tions were asked and answered, and 
there wasn’t anything resembling the 
over-the-line, juvenile theatrics like 
those shown for Judge Jackson. 
Things 
changed 
when 
President 
Obama’s final nomination was stolen 
by Republicans. They refused to even 
hold a hearing or consider the sitting 
President’s nominee on just fabricated 
grounds. 
Democrats are trying to maintain a 
sharp focus on legal questions and per-
sonal 
qualifications. 
Faced 
with 
sideshows and personal attacks, we 
stuck to issues. What was particularly 
striking about those attacks was they 
were attacks against somebody whom 
Senate 
Republicans 
had 
voted 
for 
unanimously when she was nominated 
to a lower level court. 
My view is, the radicalization of the 
Court and the nominations process are 
just poisonous to our democracy, but 
that was what was on display when Re-
publicans attacked Judge Jackson. 
I want to start setting the record 
straight on several of the key issues. 
First, Judge Jackson is squarely 
within the sentencing norm for cases 
involving child sexual abuse material. 
She was smeared anyway as going soft 
on predators. It was a gross and base-
less accusation, more of a dog whistle 
to conspiracists than an attempt at 
honestly vetting a nominee. Even the 
National Review—nobody’s idea of a 
liberal publication—published a col-
umn that called the comments of our 
colleague 
from 
Missouri, 
Senator 
HAWLEY—it 
called 
his 
attack 
‘‘meritless to the point of dema-
goguery.’’ Those were the words of the 
National Review. 
The fact is, on this hugely important 
issue, the whole question of kids’ safe-
ty, as the Presiding Officer of the Sen-
ate knows, there is a big difference be-
tween talking about protecting child 
victims and actually doing the work. 
Far too many of our Republican col-
leagues just come down on the wrong 
side of the divide. 
It is absolutely right that govern-
ment at every level has failed to pro-
tect kids from exploitation online. 
That failure has a lot of causes. One is 
that the Justice Department, for rea-
sons I will never understand, has con-
sistently declined to put enough man-
power and funding behind protecting 
these vulnerable kids. Another reason 
is that Members of Congress talk a 
really big game, but when there is seri-
ous legislation to protect vulnerable 
kids, they disappear. 
Now, I have proposed an alternative. 
It is the Invest in Child Safety Act. It 
puts serious funds into tracking down 
the child predators and prosecuting 
these god-awful monsters and pro-
tecting the kids they target and abuse. 
It would create a new executive posi-
tion, to be confirmed by the Senate, to 
raise this level of protecting kids and 
strengthen oversight. 
Now, instead of supporting that legis-
lation, where we put real prosecutors 
and real investigators to the task of 
protecting our kids, putting more law 
enforcement on the beat, a number of 
Senate Republicans spend their days 
going after section 230 of the Commu-
nications Decency Act. So, yet again, 
vulnerable kids are being used as 
pawns by politicians to advance their 
agenda. 
I simply believe that child abuse and 
exploitation is too serious an issue for 
U.S. Senators to cheapen it with base-
less accusations and ill-conceived legis-
lation. This is the last subject—pro-
tecting our kids—that elected officials 
ought to be playing politics with. 
WOMEN’S HEALTHCARE 
Madam President, I am going to use 
the remainder of my time to discuss 
another issue that came up often in the 
debate, and that is the right of Amer-
ican women to control their bodies. I 
am talking here about Roe v. Wade. 
The Supreme Court has effectively 
overturned Roe already when you look, 
for example, at the various States. The 
Court has overturned Roe for millions 
and millions of people. They did it on 
the shadow docket by allowing an obvi-
ously unconstitutional bounty law in 
Texas to go into effect. Now States all 
over the country are passing similar 
laws, and in some States, they are 
going even further to restrict the fun-
damental right of women to control 
their own bodies. 
The fact of the matter is, this debate 
is not just about Roe. It is becoming 
commonplace for Republicans to say 
out in the open that the Supreme 
Court ruled incorrectly in Griswold v. 
Connecticut, the 1965 case that af-
firmed the right of married people to 
use contraception. That is what this 
debate has become all about—not just 
the right to a safe and legal abortion; 
it is about rolling back the right to 
birth control. 
Republicans are saying that the case 
that affirmed the right to use birth 
control was wrongly decided. That is 
what our colleague from Tennessee 
who just spoke said ahead of the hear-
ings on Judge Jackson’s nomination. 
It is enough to leave you wondering: 
What year is this? What century is 
this? 
Connecticut’s ban on contraception 
was based on a Federal law from the 
1870s, a law from a time when women’s 
rights were few. They couldn’t even 
vote. 
For Connecticut to have that kind of 
law on the books in 1965 was a ridicu-
lous infringement on the liberty and 
body autonomy of American women. 
Estelle Griswold, the women’s rights 
activist whose name is atop the case, 
once half-joked that the State would 
have to ‘‘put a gynecological table at 
the Greenwich toll station’’ to prevent 
women from going to New York to get 
the contraception they needed. 
But 
the 
history 
in 
Connecticut 
shows, as is often the case, this old re-
striction on personal liberty fell hard-
est on women without means, even 
when the law was badly out of date. 
The Supreme Court ruled correctly 
when it struck down Connecticut’s law 
in 1965. To say otherwise is appalling 
and alarming. The Court recognized 
that the government ought to stay out 
of people’s private decisions about fam-
ily planning. A few years later, the 
court correctly applied the Griswold 
precedent to single women. A year 
after that came Roe. 
These cases are linked. Put together, 
the attacks on Roe, and now Griswold, 
they are about letting the government 
control when somebody decides to start 
a family. We are talking about rolling 
back 80 years of basic human rights. 
Prior to her appointment on the Su-
preme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
wrote in these debates over Roe: 
Also in the balance is a woman’s autono-
mous charge of her life’s full course . . . her 
ability to stand in relation to man, society, 
and the state as an independent, self-sus-
taining equal citizen. 
When the Court upheld Roe in 1992, 
the majority ruled that ‘‘[t]he ability 
of women to participate equally in the 
economic and social life of the Nation 
has been facilitated by their ability to 
control their reproductive lives.’’ 
If women can’t legally obtain birth 
control and they can’t legally obtain 
abortion care, they no longer have 
legal control over their bodies. Let’s be 
clear. 
If women do not control their own 
bodies, they don’t control their own 
lives. And if Americans don’t control 
their own lives, they are not free and 
equal under the law. 
Tossing out Roe—the way this Court 
has—is an act of judicial radicalism. 
Every 
Republican 
Supreme 
Court 
nominee swears up and down that they 
respect precedent; they won’t legislate 
from the bench. Then they go out and 
toss out Roe on the shadow docket. 
For Republicans now to be going 
after Griswold is staggering and dan-
gerous. For Senators to be attacking 
this ruling 57 years after the case was 
decided is ridiculous. 
This is not just because birth control 
is part of basic health regimens. It is 
because women in America have an 
equal right to chart the course of their 
lives and when to become pregnant.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2020 
April 6, 2022 
Now, Republicans often talk about 
their position in the context of States’ 
rights. Too often, what they are saying 
is they believe in States’ rights only if 
they believe the State is right, and we 
see that on issue after issue. 
And, finally, it is important to con-
sider these debates in the context of 
what 
is 
happening 
in 
statehouses 
around the country. Republican legis-
latures are effectively banning abor-
tion. They are passing laws that do 
more to protect rapists than rape vic-
tims. They criminalize abortion care, 
and in other cases they are criminal-
izing the act of helping women obtain 
the healthcare they need. 
Some States want to make it impos-
sible to use these kinds of medicines 
and therapies to safely end pregnancies 
early. A Republican lawmaker in Mis-
souri recently proposed forcing women 
to carry ectopic pregnancies to term, 
which is effectively a death sentence. 
The bottom line is, what is hap-
pening today, in 2022, is collectively 
the most extreme attack on reproduc-
tive health, freedom, and equality in 
America I can remember. 
And I am just going to close by say-
ing this is not the same debate as we 
have had over Roe. State-level Repub-
licans are going way beyond that point. 
For Republicans here in this Con-
gress to be going after Griswold—after 
birth control—is a shocking escalation 
in the fight they are making to roll 
back the rights of women. 
American lives and liberty are at 
stake. Americans need to be prepared 
to fight for freedom and equality in the 
months and years ahead. I am sure 
going to be out there with them. 
In the meantime, I believe Judge 
Jackson is going to make an out-
standing Supreme Court Justice and a 
bulwark for the rights of women and 
all Americans. 
This is a historic confirmation, one 
that is long overdue. I am proud to give 
Judge Jackson my vote, and I urge my 
colleagues to support her nomination 
as well. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3959 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, I 
am here today to discuss what I saw 
this past weekend when I took a trip to 
our southern border in Texas. 
I led a delegation of eight sheriffs 
and mayors from my home State of 
Tennessee. We went to see what is hap-
pening, what the effects of the border 
crisis are, and to hear from them and 
allow the border agents to hear from 
them the effects of the border crisis in 
our own communities in Tennessee. 
Our mayors and sheriffs are seeing 
record drug overdoses, gang violence, 
and other forms of criminal activity 
right there in Tennessee. 
We learned that what is really hap-
pening at our border is quite simple: 
Well-financed, operationally sophisti-
cated drug cartels, with the help of the 
Chinese Communist Party, are exploit-
ing 
our 
immigration 
policies 
and 
human economic desires to make bil-
lions of dollars from drug and human 
trafficking. 
Ignored by the Biden administration 
and the corporate media, this increas-
ingly powerful criminal enterprise is 
expanding further into American com-
munities. 
Our trip revealed two key insights. 
First, under Biden policies, this na-
tional security crisis is unmanageable. 
Second, and paradoxically, this crisis is 
well within the Federal Government’s 
ability to fix. 
My central takeaway was this: If 
every American saw what we saw and 
heard, 
this 
would 
end. 
America 
wouldn’t tolerate this. It is a crisis. 
Here is the cartels’ business model: 
Fentanyl ingredients are shipped from 
China to Mexico. In Mexico, the cartels 
turn these chemicals into astonish-
ingly potent drugs bound for the 
United States. 
Last year, fentanyl seized at the bor-
der was more than enough to kill every 
American. And that is just what we 
caught. Think about what has not been 
caught. Think about what is getting 
through. 
The cartels control the entire Mexi-
can side of the U.S. border, and each 
migrant must pay thousands of dollars 
for safe passage to these cartels. Often, 
they have to pay through subsequent 
indentured 
servitude. 
Many 
young 
women become victims of human traf-
ficking. 
So in this vicious cycle, the more il-
legal immigration, the more money for 
the cartels; and the more money for 
the cartels, the more drugs they 
produce. 
For cartels, the illegal immigrants 
are more than an expendable revenue 
source. They are a tool for facilitating 
transport of drugs and criminals. The 
cartels push scores of migrant cus-
tomers across the border so they can 
occupy American border agents. Then 
they exploit the resulting gaps in pa-
trol coverage to move across drugs, 
gang members, those they refer to as 
‘‘high-value’’ 
individuals, 
terrorist- 
watch-list members, and others. 
Border Patrol agents told me that, 
given the recordbreaking border cross-
ings they are currently facing, there 
are times when every agent is busy 
processing migrant paperwork, leaving 
the border wide open for drug and 
human trafficking. The drugs and gang 
members and the accompanying vio-
lence will then flood into our American 
communities. 
As one agent put it: The people cross-
ing the border don’t stay in this area, 
and neither do the drugs. 
More than 100,000 Americans died last 
year from drug overdoses, mostly from 
fentanyl, which are really more akin to 
CCP-engineered 
poisonings. 
Several 
thousands were Tennesseans. The Ten-
nessee sheriffs and mayors on this trip 
told me that deaths from illicit drug 
overdoses in their counties are at 
record highs. Our Tennessee sheriffs 
know the families in their commu-
nities. They told me the toughest part 
of their job is to see a mother or a 
grandmother, to go to their home and 
tell them that their son or their grand-
son will never return. It is heart-
breaking. Each one of these obituaries 
has the CCP’s fingerprint on it. 
The migrants’ money and usefulness 
to distract border agents are essential 
to the cartels’ operations. These illegal 
immigrants are incentivized to come 
because of our current catch-and-re-
lease policies. 
To illustrate the current policy of ab-
surdity, last Friday, around midnight, 
near a stretch of—of course—unfin-
ished border wall, right outside of 
McAllen, TX, our vehicle came across 
about 15 recently arrived migrants. 
They approached us and asked us 
where they could find the Border Pa-
trol agents. They wanted to turn them-
selves in, having been coached by their 
cartel handlers that this was the first 
step to U.S. Government-funded release 
into America. Our policies are so up-
side-down that the suspects are looking 
for the officers. 
Nevertheless, U.S. Border Patrol and 
other law enforcement Agencies are 
working tirelessly day and night to 
protect our Nation. Understandably, 
morale is at an all-time low with a 
Biden administration that refuses to 
give them the tools that they need to 
deal with this crisis. 
Border Patrol can process a max-
imum of roughly 5,000 migrants a day. 
Right now, they are facing nearly 8,000 
migrants a day. And when the Biden 
administration lifts title 42 authority, 
they fear that the number could exceed 
15,000 per day. 
Therefore, and unsurprisingly, the 
constant plea I heard from Border Pa-
trol agents was this: We need effective 
policy, not more agents, not more 
equipment. Bad policies are what have 
created this incentive to cross the bor-
der, and eliminating these policies is 
the only fix. Our agents signed up to 
protect our border, not to facilitate its 
demise. 
Border agents in Laredo told me that 
the 
Migrant 
Protection 
Protocols, 
known as MPP, were a perfect illustra-
tion of the need for policy change. MPP 
was a policy that required migrants 
seeking asylum in the United States to 
remain in Mexico until it was deter-
mined whether or not they were actu-
ally entitled to asylum. Most are not. 
When it was implemented in 2019, the 
agent said it was like flipping a switch 
because this stopped people coming 
when they knew that they wouldn’t get 
in. 
This ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy cut 
illegal border crossings dramatically in 
fiscal year 2020. Yet the Biden adminis-
tration nixed the MPP, and, not sur-
prisingly, border crossings more than 
quadrupled in fiscal year 2021. 
With the help of their media allies, 
Washington Democrats ignore this cri-
sis and they hope that the American 
people will too. They don’t travel to

the border because they don’t want to 
answer for the crisis that they have 
created. They have chosen appease-
ment of loud, radical immigration 
groups over American security, over 
American sovereignty. 
President Biden and Vice President 
KAMALA HARRIS haven’t seen the bor-
der stations where the agents sacrifice 
day and night, mentally and phys-
ically, battling a crisis that their De-
partments haven’t given them the 
tools to address. 
For many Americans, this crisis 
seems far away, at least until it is too 
late—until it is their child, their 
grandchild, their brother and sister 
who become a statistic. 
That is the other thing that I heard 
constantly from Border Patrol and law 
enforcement agents: We need someone 
to tell America what is happening here. 
With the President and media avert-
ing their eyes and abdicating their re-
sponsibilities, it becomes even more 
critical to spread the word before more 
American lives are needlessly lost, be-
fore more migrants’ lives are destroyed 
in the journey or through indentured 
servitude once they arrive, and more 
communities are damaged beyond re-
pair. 
So what can we do to address this 
crisis? 
Even though the border cries is worse 
than ever, the Biden administration is 
voluntarily ending title 42 pandemic- 
related authority for expedited re-
moval. 
The Border Patrol agents I met this 
weekend believe that this will make 
this recordbreaking crisis substantially 
worse. Such a surrender of American 
security would be intolerable. 
And there is another health crisis 
that title 42 is critical to battling. The 
cartels send migrants across at stra-
tegic points to bog down Border Patrol 
agents with paperwork processing that 
takes five times longer without title 
42. Then they use the resulting enforce-
ment gaps to move fentanyl across the 
border. 
We have to close these enforcement 
gaps with better policy. 
So I have introduced legislation to 
add drug smuggling as an additional 
basis for title 42 authority. Overdoses 
have become an epidemic in America. 
This legislation would allow the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
to use title 42 to combat drug traf-
ficking across the border. This bill 
would give our Border Patrol agents 
the tools they need to quickly remove 
migrants who illegally cross the bor-
der, substantially freeing up agents to 
focus on actually stopping drug traf-
fickers. 
More than 100,000 Americans died last 
year from drug overdoses, many from 
fentanyl coming from across our south-
ern border. We desperately need title 42 
to fight this drug epidemic. It is a tool 
that would quite literally save Amer-
ican lives in every State in the Union 
immediately. 
So, as in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 3959 and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration. I further ask that the bill 
be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Hawaii. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
This is not the right way to get at 
the fentanyl problem. This gives the 
Secretary permission to shut down all 
asylum seekers from a country on the 
basis of any type of drug, no matter 
how much is in possession, how fre-
quently that drug is possessed, what 
country they are coming from. We are 
calling for essentially a complete shut-
down of the asylum program because 
there might be fentanyl somewhere. 
But it also gives the Secretary author-
ity to stop asylum seekers coming 
from any country for any drug at any 
scale. 
Now, title 42 authority is a serious 
thing. It is a blanket authority to 
block anyone presenting themselves for 
asylum. We have seen the horrific im-
ages in Ukraine. We know between 4 
and 5 million people are already refu-
gees, and we know that the United 
States, as the indispensable Nation, 
wants to take a leadership role in ac-
commodating these refugees in Europe 
and, if necessary, in the United States. 
People presenting themselves for asy-
lum, escaping their dangerous home 
country—that is actually part of the 
American dream. That is, in a lot of 
ways, how many of us arrived, right? 
There may not have been this statu-
tory framework, but the principle in-
volved was not just that you came 
from some other place far away to 
make a better life for yourself—some-
times it was that, but sometimes it 
was to escape the pogrom, as was the 
case with my grandparents, from Kyiv 
to Odesa, actually to Canada, and then 
to Hawaii. 
And so this authority is no small 
thing. And to give the Secretary of 
HHS this blanket authority to essen-
tially shut down all asylum seekers be-
cause 
we 
are 
afraid—appropriately 
afraid—of a specific drug is just a little 
ham-fisted. 
And I appreciate the Senator’s re-
marks. I think there are better ways to 
work on this, and therefore I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, I 
want to thank my colleague from Ha-
waii for his remarks, but I want to ex-
plain what just happened here. 
My colleague objects, despite the fact 
that recordbreaking numbers of Ameri-
cans 
are 
currently 
dying 
from 
overdoses, fueled by fentanyl coming 
across our border. This legislation is a 
tool to help save American lives. In-
deed, 100,000 American lives were lost 
last year to drug overdoses. These lives 
are being deprived of the American 
dream forever. So Democrats are cat-
egorically opposed to commonsense 
border security tools to prevent drug 
trafficking into America no matter 
how bad the drug overdose numbers 
get? How much longer will it take to 
change course from the Biden adminis-
tration policies that have created this 
national security crisis? How much 
longer will we allow our immigration 
system to be manipulated by a massive 
transnational 
criminal 
alliance 
be-
tween the Chinese communists and bil-
lion-dollar cartels who are shipping 
deadly quantities of illicit drugs into 
the United States? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, today, I 
rise to share my concerns with the 
nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson to serve as an Associate Jus-
tice on the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Let me begin my remarks by noting 
that I have enjoyed getting to know 
Judge Jackson. My visits with her and 
conversations with her in the com-
mittee and otherwise and also my 
interaction with Judge Jackson’s fam-
ily have all reinforced what I know of 
her generally, which is that she is a 
good person, a noble citizen, and some-
one who has earned very impressive 
academic and professional credentials. 
After graduating from Harvard Law 
School, she ended up clerking at all 
three levels of the Federal judiciary 
and worked at a number of positions 
over the years as a lawyer. She has 
now, as a judge, served as a Federal 
district judge, which is a trial court po-
sition, and has served on the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the DC Circuit, which is 
an appellate court position. If con-
firmed to the U.S. Supreme Court, she 
will have served at all three levels of 
the Federal judiciary, which is itself an 
impressive accomplishment and one 
that I think would benefit the Supreme 
Court. Any time they have the insight 
of someone who has served in that 
many roles, it can be helpful. 
She is a good person in many re-
spects 
and 
comes 
with 
impressive 
qualifications academically and profes-
sionally, but I do have concerns, and 
those concerns are what I want to turn 
to now. 
Many of them date back to efforts by 
groups like Demand Justice to shame 
and intimidate Judge Jackson’s former 
boss and the Justice whom she would 
be replacing if confirmed to this posi-
tion, Justice Breyer, into retiring by 
paying for a billboard mounted on a 
truck to drive around the Supreme 
Court of the United States, bearing the 
slogan ‘‘Retire, Breyer.’’ These same 
groups are now the same groups that 
are spending money—millions of dol-
lars—to advocate for Judge Jackson’s 
speedy confirmation. Then there was 
the 
shameless 
leaking 
of 
Justice

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2022 
April 6, 2022 
Breyer’s decision to retire well before 
he was ready to announce it. 
Now we find ourselves in the midst of 
a needlessly rushed nomination proc-
ess, where liberal dark money groups 
are pressuring Senate Democrats to 
confirm their preferred Supreme Court 
nominee 
months—many 
months—in 
advance of when she could actually be 
seated on the Court. 
Because of this false sense of urgency 
being presented by the radical left, we 
have also seen the chairman of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee refuse to 
accommodate reasonable and common-
sense document requests from Repub-
lican members of that committee. The 
same members of the committee who 
demanded more time to review and in-
terrogate a nominee about his high 
school yearbook are now feigning out-
rage and insisting that it is somehow 
unacceptable that we should demand 
more time to review a nominee’s own 
judicial record. The contrast is signifi-
cant. 
Let me provide some additional con-
text to illustrate how outrageous that 
aspect of this situation is. 
My Republican colleagues and I have 
been very keen to hear from Judge 
Jackson about her judicial philosophy. 
This is something that is an essential 
part of assessing any judicial nomi-
nee’s fitness for office. The higher level 
the nomination, the more important it 
is to understand that. Nowhere is this 
more important than when the nomi-
nee is someone who has been nomi-
nated to serve on the highest Court in 
the land, the Supreme Court of the 
United States. 
Judge Jackson, significantly, has re-
fused to describe her judicial philos-
ophy or even to agree that she has one. 
Instead, she has told us that she has a 
methodology, but this methodology— 
neutrally applying the law to all rel-
evant facts—is nothing more than a 
simple statement—a simple rote reci-
tation—of what judges do, not an ex-
planation of how they do it. 
When Republicans on the Judiciary 
Committee pressed Judge Jackson for 
more information about her judicial 
philosophy or any statement about it, 
Chairman DURBIN
and the nominee 
both directed us to her judicial record. 
So we asked Judge Jackson about her 
record. We inquired about questionable 
sentences in child pornography cases, 
sentences that appeared to constitute a 
pattern 
and 
practice 
of 
giving 
inexplicably light sentences to crimi-
nals—people 
who 
are 
caught 
traf-
ficking in what can only be described 
as the products of the commercializa-
tion of child sex torture. These are vile 
offenses. Her response was that we sim-
ply couldn’t understand her sentencing 
decisions. 
We 
couldn’t 
understand 
them just by looking only at the public 
record because we didn’t see what she 
saw. We didn’t have the information 
that she had. 
Now, Chairman DURBIN told us that 
we can discern Judge Jackson’s judi-
cial 
philosophy 
from 
her 
judicial 
record. Judge Jackson told us that we 
can’t understand her judicial record 
without all of the supporting docu-
ments that informed her decisions. So 
we asked for those supporting docu-
ments, which included presentence re-
ports from those cases involving child 
pornography 
possession. 
Chairman 
DURBIN’s response? Not on my watch— 
his words, not mine. Democrats dis-
missed our requests as baseless attacks 
on Judge Jackson herself. 
What if we said, ‘‘That isn’t true’’? 
Do they contest that Judge Jackson 
presided over those cases? That she, in 
fact, imposed those sentences? Do they 
contest that she imposed those sen-
tences or that Judge Jackson’s sen-
tences departed from both the sen-
tencing guideline ranges and from the 
requests of the prosecutors? These are 
simply the facts in the record, and we 
have questions about them, legitimate 
questions. 
So, if this is a baseless attack to a 
nominee’s factual record, what exactly 
is the purpose and scope of the Senate’s 
duty to offer our advice and consent 
with regard to such nominations? 
After we pushed back, Chairman 
DURBIN based his continued refusal on 
the sensitive nature of the documents 
at issue. Now, I agree completely that 
presentence reports are highly sen-
sitive. They contain sensitive informa-
tion in them, and this body of written 
work product deals with necessarily 
sensitive materials on a regular basis. 
The U.S. Senate deals with sensitive 
records, so the fact that these are sen-
sitive documents doesn’t mean that we 
can’t handle them. In fact, we already 
have security measures in place to pro-
tect that kind of information. We even 
have specified rooms where we can and 
routinely do review sensitive informa-
tion. So hiding behind a glib quote 
about protecting children at the ex-
pense of thousands upon thousands of 
actual child victims is shameful. 
The chairman says that parents are 
living in fear that presentence reports 
that discuss harm to their children 
would be confidentially shared with 
this body for the limited purpose of al-
lowing us to do our job, to review 
Judge Jackson’s record. I think it is 
more likely—far more likely, in fact— 
that parents of sexually exploited chil-
dren live in fear that their children 
may be victimized again when one of 
Judge Jackson’s defendants gets re-
leased from prison after an unconscion-
ably, indefensibly short sentence. 
To make matters even worse, not 
only have Democrats refused Repub-
lican requests for more information on 
Judge Jackson’s judicial record, but 
they have withheld information from 
me and my Republican colleagues on 
the Judiciary Committee. I am refer-
ring in this context to a chart ref-
erenced accidentally by a Democratic 
member of the Judiciary Committee 
that summarized probation office sen-
tencing recommendations gleaned from 
the 
presentence 
reports—the 
same 
presentence reports that we have re-
quested and that we have not been al-
lowed to see. 
Now, I have to admit I am still un-
clear as to how the majority obtained 
this information. Chairman DURBIN 
wrote to Republicans that the chart 
was given to him by the White House, 
which, in turn, obtained the chart from 
Judge Jackson’s chambers. However, 
when I and every other Republican 
member on the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee wrote to Judge Jackson to re-
quest further information, she replied 
that she had no way of obtaining the 
requested information because it ‘‘is 
the property of the U.S. District Court 
for the District of Columbia, and I am 
no longer a member of that court.’’ 
How, then, did her chambers obtain the 
information that was provided to the 
White House and then provided to Sen-
ate Democrats which came from the 
presentence reports? 
Do the Democrats have something to 
hide—something that they can avoid 
having to reveal and have discussed by 
rushing Judge Jackson’s nomination? 
What might it be? It may be the one 
thing Judge Jackson steadfastly re-
fused to share—her judicial philosophy. 
Despite my Democratic colleagues’ 
pretending that judicial philosophy is 
some arcane and esoteric legal concept 
that doesn’t matter, Americans every-
where instinctively understand its im-
portance. While they may not all use 
the 
same 
terminology, 
Americans 
know that justice—as we imagine Lady 
Justice always depicted as being blind 
or blindfolded—is to ensure equal jus-
tice under the law for everyone regard-
less of their race, their religion, their 
background, their creed. That kind of 
justice matters to every petitioner, 
every respondent, every plaintiff, and 
every defendant who comes before our 
courts. That kind of justice can be en-
sured only by judges adhering to a 
guiding principle by which they bring 
clarity out of often unclear language. 
The Supreme Court is not a rep-
resentative body; Congress is. Justices 
are not accountable to the people once 
they are confirmed, but we are. That is 
why we have heard from virtually 
every nominee that their personal per-
spectives on X, Y, and Z don’t matter— 
because they are fully committed to 
applying the law without their own 
personal perspectives getting in the 
way. That is exactly right and could 
not more fully demonstrated the im-
portance of judicial philosophy. When a 
Justice is swayed by her natural incli-
nations or fails to get to a neutral 
place when deciding a particular case, 
adherence to her judicial philosophy 
keeps her from violating that commit-
ment. That guiding principle con-
stitute a judge’s judicial philosophy. 
Now, look, judicial philosophy is not 
a methodology or, as I said earlier 
when Judge Jackson described her judi-
cial methodology as simply applying 
the law to the facts, that is not de-
scribing her unique approach to judi-
cial decision making. She was simply 
reciting the definition of what a judge 
does.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2023 
April 6, 2022 
Every judge applies the law to the 
facts. That is literally what it means 
to be a judge. The question is, How? 
Because statutory and constitutional 
language is often unclear, whether on 
its face or as applied in a particular 
context. What matters is how a judge 
resolves that ambiguity. Laws are not 
self-interpreting, and interpretation is 
rarely obvious, especially in the dif-
ficult cases that tend uniquely to come 
before the Supreme Court of the United 
States on the merits. You have to have 
a guiding principle by which to bring 
clarity out of unclear language. That is 
your judicial philosophy. 
So a judge without a judicial philos-
ophy is no more useful than a pastor 
without a theology. It is just someone 
making it up as they go along, dressing 
up their opinions as holy writ. A nomi-
nee who claims to have no judicial phi-
losophy is either being misleading or is 
perhaps unsuited to a lifetime appoint-
ment on the Federal bench, let alone 
on the highest Court in the land. Yet 
the vast majority of President Biden’s 
judicial nominees have repeatedly as-
serted that they simply don’t have one; 
that they lack a judicial philosophy. 
This sudden and uniform shift suddenly 
and strongly suggests that they are 
being coached to give precisely that in-
explicable, indefensible answer. 
And yet every judge does, in fact, 
have a judicial philosophy. Whether 
they acknowledge it or not, whether it 
is easily definable by a few words or a 
few sentences, they do have one. When 
a nominee refuses to describe her judi-
cial philosophy, the likely explanation 
is simply that she does have one; she 
just knows that neither the public nor 
this body would approve of it. In that 
case, we are left to infer what her judi-
cial philosophy is from her record, 
which is precisely what Chairman DUR-
BIN and Judge Jackson suggested that 
we do. Except, as I have already point-
ed out, they don’t want us to have the 
whole record, and they are unreason-
ably denying our access to the whole 
record. 
So, again, Judge Jackson refuses to 
tell us what her judicial philosophy is. 
Senator DURBIN says we can find it in 
her record; Judge Jackson says we 
can’t fully understand her record with-
out all the supporting documents, but 
neither of them will let us see these 
documents. If this makes you nervous, 
that is because it should. 
So why does this matter? Well, we 
got to see this firsthand 2 weeks ago. 
While Judge Jackson insisted that she 
didn’t have a judicial philosophy, she 
actually did give us a small peek into 
it. In response to a question from Sen-
ator DURBIN
about the sentencing 
guidelines and child pornography of-
fenders, she acknowledged Congress 
implemented a statutory scheme with 
specific directives to courts to help 
them determine how they are to sen-
tence defendants found guilty of pos-
sessing or distributing child sexual as-
sault material. But then she admitted 
that she and other judges have made a 
habit of using the discretion they are 
given in applying the sentencing guide-
lines that disregard or discount the 
parts that, in their view, no longer 
make sense, saying: 
Courts are adjusting their sentences in 
order to account for the changed cir-
cumstances. 
With all due respect, that is not her 
or any other judge’s decision to make. 
Courts don’t change the law; Congress 
changes the law. If Congress one day 
decides that receiving child sexual as-
sault material electronically is some-
how less offensive than receiving it 
through the mail, then we will change 
the law. 
Judge Jackson insists that she was 
statutorily required to consider the 
factors—the very factors she relied 
upon—to depart from the guidelines, 
consistently sentencing defendants to 
prison terms considerably below where 
the sentencing guidelines would have 
sent her. 
All that is true, but all the factors 
listed in the statute in question, codi-
fied in 18 U.S.C. Section 3553, Judge 
Jackson seems to weigh quite heavily 
those factors that will decrease an of-
fender’s sentence and gives, appar-
ently, short shrift to those who would 
lengthen the sentence in these child 
pornography cases. 
This kind of cherry-picking of con-
siderations resulted in astonishing out-
comes, like giving one defendant 3 
months in prison instead of 10 years. 
Her willingness to change the outcome 
based not on the law but based on her 
own sense of ‘‘changed circumstances’’ 
demonstrates a lack of judicial humil-
ity and restraint, and that is troubling. 
Unfortunately, this lack of judicial 
humility and restraint was not limited 
to any narrow line of cases. It wasn’t 
limited to those cases that involved 
the production and distribution and 
possession of child pornography. 
In the case of Make the Road New 
York v. McAleenan, Judge Jackson ig-
nored clear statutory language, stating 
that she didn’t even have jurisdiction 
to review the case. She set aside that 
language and instead reached back in 
time to apply the previously enacted 
and much broader Administrative Pro-
cedures Act to obtain her preferred 
outcome, the outcome advocated for by 
the dark money group Arabella Advi-
sors, which happens to be funding the 
campaign for her confirmation. When 
asked about this case, Judge Jackson 
doubled down on her faulty reasoning, 
even though it had been overturned by 
the left-leaning DC Circuit. 
Unfortunately, this was not the only 
case where Judge Jackson ignored 
clear statutory language to assert ju-
risdiction and reach her preferred pol-
icy outcome. 
To make matters worse, Judge Jack-
son took multiple opportunities in her 
responses to my colleagues’ written 
questions to separate herself from prin-
ciples that form the bedrock of our 
constitutional Republic. 
When asked by Senator CRUZ if she 
believed that individuals possess nat-
ural rights, she said: 
I do not hold a position on whether individ-
uals possess natural rights. 
This is after she acknowledged that 
these lines from our Declaration of 
Independence reflect natural rights: 
We hold these truths to be self-evident, 
that all men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable Rights, that among these are 
Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. 
When asked by Senator CORNYN if she 
believed that natural law is reflected 
in the Bill of Rights, she stated that 
she ‘‘would interpret the Bill of Rights 
based on the methods of constitutional 
interpretation the Supreme Court em-
ploys, not based on principles derived 
from natural law.’’ 
These responses eliminate any hope 
that I had that even if Judge Jackson 
interprets and applies statutes incor-
rectly, she would still be guided by our 
Founding documents. Every part of 
Judge Jackson’s record—that is, every 
part that we have been given—seems to 
indicate something of a desire to sepa-
rate herself from grounding principles 
in order to reach her desired outcomes. 
This is why judicial philosophy mat-
ters. This is why it isn’t just some eso-
teric exercise for law nerds. This is 
why it matters and should matter to 
every American. 
When a judge can impose her own 
policy views in contradiction of the ex-
pressed will of the people through their 
elected representatives in Congress, it 
doesn’t just undermine our representa-
tive system of government. As we have 
seen here, it can put child predators 
back on the streets. 
In one case, the convict, upon release 
from his inexplicably short jail sen-
tence, resumed seeking out suggestive 
images of children to the point that 
Judge Jackson had to agree to send 
him to 6 months in a halfway house. 
In another case, the convict who had 
been convicted of raping his 13-year-old 
niece and then falsifying his address to 
evade the sex offender registry, sexu-
ally assaulted another family member 
after being released from the light sen-
tence imposed previously by Judge 
Jackson. 
Neither of these defendants would 
have had these opportunities to re-
offend had Judge Jackson just followed 
the sentencing guidelines and what the 
law required. 
Judicial philosophy matters. It is 
foundational to the very fabric of our 
constitutional Republic. And, again, 
there are no magic words we are look-
ing for. There is not a single judicial 
philosophy that is either going to deem 
it acceptable or not acceptable, but 
they need to have one. They need to be 
willing to talk about it and explain 
what animates, what motivates their 
decision making, how they will go 
about construing these statutes. 
If judges won’t commit to giving ef-
fect to the words of the laws that Con-
gress passes, as understood at the time

they were written and enacted, then 
American voters have no control over 
the laws that govern them. We will be 
ruled in that kind of scenario by a self- 
anointed class of five philosopher Kings 
in black robes. 
I fear Judge Jackson may see the 
Court in that very way. I fear that 
based on her answer to a question in 
the hearing raised by one of my col-
leagues. In response to that question, 
she said: 
Well, anytime the Supreme Court have five 
votes . . . they have a majority for whatever 
opinion they determine. 
The Constitution demands more, and 
the American people deserve better. 
For all these reasons, I oppose Judge 
Jackson’s nomination. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from Delaware. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, we are in 
the middle of a horrible global pan-
demic. Later this month, we will pass a 
tragic milestone of a million Ameri-
cans killed by COVID–19. Already, 
more than 6 million globally have died. 
And I know we are all sick and tired 
of it, completely tired of it, done with 
it. I hear all the time at home and here 
that we are done with this pandemic, 
but, unfortunately, it is not done with 
us. 
This week, this body has failed to 
take 
minimally 
responsible 
action. 
And I am going to speak for a few min-
utes to what it means that we have 
failed to come together to pass another 
urgently needed appropriations bill 
both to meet our domestic needs for 
therapeutics 
and 
vaccines 
and 
for 
treatment and for the development of 
the next vaccine for the next variant 
and what it means that we have deliv-
ered zero additional resources for glob-
al public health to address this worst 
global pandemic in a century. 
The bill that we should be taking up 
now and is being blocked by disagree-
ments would have provided $10 billion 
to help provide additional protection 
for 330 million Americans, to buy the 
therapeutics that we need, to invest in 
the research to make sure that we are 
ready for the next variant, to finish 
providing the public health support for 
vaccinations. 
While we may think we are done with 
the virus, 30,000 Americans yesterday 
tested positive. It has touched all of 
our communities, our families, my own 
family, our own neighborhoods. We are 
not done with this. 
Senator SCHUMER and others of my 
colleagues have been saying on this 
floor and in public and in private re-
lentlessly, we must deliver more re-
sources. Well, I am here to say that we 
cannot get this pandemic under control 
here in the United States and secure 
the safety and health of our people 
until we have delivered meaningful 
vaccine protection around the world. 
It is shortsighted for us to say that 
because we are done with it, it is done 
with us. I will remind you, we have 
twice before gone through periods 
where things were looking better, 
things were looking up, and then the 
Delta variant emerged, the Omicron 
variant emerged in other places in the 
world where vaccination rates were not 
what we might hope for, not what we 
have achieved here and in other coun-
tries. 
So let me briefly explain why this is 
a case of ‘‘pay me now or pay me 
later.’’ I understand the fiscal concerns 
that have driven some to say we should 
spend no more, but I think we will dis-
cover the foolishness of a view that 
says we need not spend more. 
First, it is just a waste of money, 
folks. We have already bought hun-
dreds of millions of vaccine doses that 
are now not going to be delivered in 
countries in the world, and particu-
larly in Africa, where the public health 
systems are not developed enough to 
actually translate vaccine doses into 
vaccinations. 
As I learned during the Ebola epi-
demic in Liberia, that last mile from 
the capital to the regions to villages is 
really hard to navigate. It is hard to 
navigate here in the United States, 
heck. But in countries without cold 
storage chains, without rural public 
health resources, without the resources 
to pay for people to go and vaccinate, 
not having that last dollar to go that 
last mile means that we are letting 
people die when we have got the vac-
cines to save their lives; and it means 
we 
continue 
to 
have 
2.8 
billion 
unvaccinated people around the world. 
Second, this is a moment where we 
can teach the world, again, that the 
United States, long the most reliable 
global public health partner, can be 
counted on in this critical moment. 
Dozens of countries could not get our 
vaccines 6 months or a year ago, so 
they have relied on Chinese and Rus-
sian 
vaccines 
that 
are 
ineffective 
against Omicron. A variant emerged 
able to get around Sinopharm and 
Sputnik, the vaccines delivered by the 
Chinese and Russians. 
So we have a moment when dozens of 
countries around the world are asking 
for our help. We have got the vaccines; 
we have got the opportunity; and we 
are failing to take advantage of this 
moment. 
The 
most 
compelling 
reason, 
of 
course, is our own people’s health. We 
have seen this cycle before, and we will 
see this cycle again. 
How bad is the vaccination status in 
other places around the world? Well, 
briefly: Yemen, a country undergoing a 
horrific war with widespread famine, 
their vaccination rate is less than 1.5 
percent. In Haiti, in our hemisphere, a 
nation of 11 million people, their vac-
cination rate is below 1 percent. The 
number of folks fully vaccinated in two 
great countries on the continent of Af-
rica—Tanzania, 60 million people; Nige-
ria, 200 million people—below 5 per-
cent. 
We cannot afford to allow this virus, 
COVID–19, which is like a safecracker, 
out there in the world to just keep 
twisting the dials and testing, testing, 
testing—because every time it infects 
someone, it has a chance to mutate. 
Every time it mutates, it has a chance 
to get past our defenses. 
We will regret this failure. We need 
to treat this like the global health 
emergency it is, and we need to realize 
that we already had hundreds of mil-
lions of people facing food insecurity 
before the Russian invasion of Ukraine 
accelerated the vulnerability of mil-
lions of people around the world be-
cause Ukraine is the breadbasket from 
which is fed countries all over the re-
gion: the Middle East and North Africa, 
from Syria to Somalia. We are going to 
see food riots, increased instability, 
and millions more in hunger. 
So, folks, I will keep at this. I will 
keep working. I will keep mobilizing 
and engaging my colleagues, both 
Democratic and Republican, in making 
the case until it is done; but we have a 
moral imperative, an economic impera-
tive, a political imperative, a humani-
tarian imperative to save our own 
country and our own people by pro-
viding the resources the world needs 
and deserves. 
We have so many good partners in 
this—organizations like One, USGOC, 
Care, Catholic Relief Services, Save 
the Children, Bread for the World, and 
many others—too many to name. But 
we need the same level of energy and 
commitment and engagement in this 
Chamber that we have heard from calls 
from around our country and our 
world. The world is looking to the 
United States to use the vaccines we 
have, use the resources we have, pro-
vide the support to get us on the other 
side of this pandemic globally. Mr. 
President, this is the moment that we 
should do it. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. President, I want to speak briefly 
to a great accomplishment that will 
occur in this Senate later this week: 
the confirmation to the U.S. Supreme 
Court of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. 
As a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, I have lived through—I have 
endured—several 
confirmation 
proc-
esses. I will say, this is one that brings 
me some joy, a sense of lift that we are 
making history for this Chamber and 
for the Supreme Court. 
Justice Breyer, who has announced 
his intention to retire, is someone who 
has spent decades on the Federal 
bench, on the Supreme Court, and has 
lived up to the highest ideals of Amer-
ican jurisprudence; and I am confident 
Judge Jackson, as Justice Jackson, 
will continue in that tradition. She 
has, as we learned in our week of con-
firmation 
hearings, 
a 
deep 
under-
standing of the Constitution, a great 
sense of the balance and the role of a 
judge, limited to understanding the 
Constitution, law, and facts passed in 
front of her and with a limited role to 
decide the questions presented based on 
the law and the facts. 
We also got to hear about her family, 
her history, her experiences, her serv-
ice, her impeccable legal credentials,

her service on the Sentencing Commis-
sion, her work as a trial and appellate 
court judge, her experience as a clerk 
at all levels of the Federal judiciary, 
and her time as a Federal public de-
fender. 
She is a devoted daughter, sister, 
wife, mother, friend, and someone who 
is humble enough to say that she 
knows and loves the Constitution from 
which our freedoms flow. She stands on 
the shoulders of those who went before 
her—her parents, both proud HBCU 
graduates and the first in her family to 
go to college. Her uncles and her broth-
er served in law enforcement, in the 
military. She is so well grounded in 
those institutions and traditions that 
have made our Nation great; and it fills 
me with confidence to know that a per-
son of this skill, of this background, of 
this sense of judicial temperament— 
who endured a grilling that was, at 
times, tantamount to harassment by 
other members of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee—demonstrated her grace, 
her courage, and her integrity under 
sustained fire. 
I very much look forward to the 
votes we will take in this Chamber 
later this week, and I will be honored 
to vote to confirm Judge Ketanji 
Brown Jackson to be the next Asso-
ciate Justice of the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
rise again, with my increasingly bat-
tered poster, to call on this body and in 
particular on corporate America to 
wake up to the threat of climate 
change. 
Just this week, the IPCC report came 
out saying that we are now at the do- 
or-die, last-chance moment. The other 
interesting thing about that IPCC re-
port was that it, for the first time, fo-
cused on the role of malicious fossil 
fuel political influence in preventing 
the solution. 
Political influence is actually con-
tributing to the climate change prob-
lem, and it is the scientists who are 
now pointing this out. 
Well, one of the worst expositors of 
that political influence, the monster in 
the middle of that political influence 
campaign here in the United States, is 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. And I 
want to talk about them in a minute; 
but, first, let’s do just a quick recap be-
cause we have known about climate 
change for a long time. 
Scientists knew about the green-
house effect back when Abraham Lin-
coln was riding around Washington in 
his tophat. In the 1950s—in the 1950s— 
the oil industry began research on the 
effects of greenhouse gas pollution. In 
1977, nearly a half century ago, Exxon’s 
top scientist warned management of 
what he called ‘‘general scientific 
agreement’’—half a century ago, mind 
you—‘‘general 
scientific 
agreement 
that the most likely manner in which 
mankind is influencing the global cli-
mate is through carbon dioxide release 
from the burning of fossil fuels.’’ 
A Republican-led committee led by 
my predecessor, John Chafee, held a 
Senate hearing on climate change in 
1986; and in 1989, the Chamber of Com-
merce—one of the most influential 
forces in Washington and now one of 
the biggest lobbyists for fossil fuel in-
terests—the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce issued a report for business lead-
ers about the threat of climate change. 
We have dug out that report because 
they entered it into the RECORD in a 
House proceeding later that day, and 
here is what that report said. I will 
quote at some length. 
[T]here is qualitative agreement among 
prognosticators that sea levels will rise . . . 
wetlands will flood, salt water will infuse 
fresh water supplies, and there will be 
changes in the distribution of tree and crop 
species and agricultural productivity. 
A significant rise in sea levels will flood 
now inhabitable land in some countries. . . . 
These same actions will affect wetlands and 
it may not be possible [to] protect both 
coastal and wetland areas. 
Georgia, very susceptible to this, as 
the Presiding Officer knows. 
Flooding will intrude into water supplies, 
such as in coastal cities (e.g., Miami and 
New Orleans). . . . Changes in temperature 
patterns will affect natural ecosystems by 
altering the distributions of species, and af-
fecting forestry and silviculture. . . . [C]rop 
lands will change. . . . The stress will depend 
on changes in precipitation patterns. 
Global warming will affect snowfall pat-
terns, hence melt, and affect water supplies. 
Most of California’s water supplies are from 
snow melt and if snow is reduced to rain, or 
melts quickly during the winter, water sup-
plies in the summer will be less than now. 
Does any of that sound familiar? Of 
course. It is what we are looking at 
around us now, and it is what the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce predicted in 
1989. 
Knowing that, what did the chamber 
do? I will tell you what the chamber 
did. 
Over the past two decades, every 
time Congress took up good climate 
bills, the chamber conspired to kill 
them. 
The reason is pretty simple: The 
chamber serves as the arm of the fossil 
fuel industry. It takes its money, and 
it does its dirty work. 
A couple of years ago, a witness at 
our Special Committee on the Climate 
Crisis explained how big trade groups 
like the chamber ‘‘adopt the lowest 
common denominator positions on cli-
mate of their most oppositional mem-
bers.’’ 
Fossil fuel pays the chamber to kill 
anything that threatens what the IMF 
estimates is an over $600 billion annual 
subsidy for fossil fuel in the United 
States. On climate, it is not the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce; it is the ‘‘U.S. 
Chamber of Carbon.’’ 
Here are some of the corpses in the 
chamber’s legislative graveyard. In 
2005, the chamber opposed bipartisan 
cap-and-trade legislation. It issued a 
‘‘key vote alert,’’ a signal that whoever 
voted in favor of the bill could face an 
onslaught of political attack ads. 
Down the legislation went. 
The chamber used the same playbook 
to kill cap-and-trade bills in 2007, in-
cluding the aptly named Wake up to 
Climate Change bill that had started to 
gain steam until the ‘‘Chamber of Car-
bon’’ dug in against it. 
In 2009, the chamber led the charge 
against the most promising climate 
bill in decades: the Waxman-Markey 
bill. The chamber spared no effort kill-
ing it. It harangued members, issued 
more vote alerts, and published ‘‘How 
They Voted’’ scorecards, with a clear 
message: Cross us and we will come 
after you. 
Since then, the chamber’s axis of in-
fluence in Congress has refused to hold 
hearings on, mark up, debate, or vote 
on any serious climate legislation. 
At the same time, the chamber 
fought climate action in the courts and 
in executive Agencies. Here are a few of 
their cadavers there: In 2010, the cham-
ber sued EPA to overturn the finding 
that greenhouse gas emissions endan-
ger public health and welfare. Dis-
abling that ‘‘endangerment finding’’ 
would cripple the Agency’s ability to 
regulate carbon pollution under the 
Clean Air Act. 
When courts rejected the chamber 
lawsuit, the chamber then set up as 
central command for fossil fuel law-
yers, coal lobbyists, and Republican po-
litical strategists, who devised the 
legal schemes to fight climate regula-
tions. This produced another chamber 
lawsuit to block the Clean Power Plan 
to reduce carbon pollution from power-
plants. And on this occasion, five Re-
publican appointees on the Supreme 
Court killed the Clean Power Plan 
using the shadow docket. They didn’t 
even have proper hearings on it. 
Once President Trump took office, 
the 
chamber 
began 
attacking 
and 
undoing Obama administration rules 
limiting carbon pollution. The cham-
ber even funded the phony and de-
bunked report that the Trump adminis-
tration relied on to justify leaving the 
Paris accord. 
The chamber’s climate obstruction 
has continued across all fronts under 
President Biden. It released a position 
paper championing ‘‘clean’’ coal, which 
is right up there next to dry water and 
chilly heat. And, of course, it led the 
charge against our reconciliation bill, 
attacking more than $500 billion in cli-
mate-related investments. 
To make all this dirty work possible, 
the 
chamber 
weaponized 
the 
dark 
money powers afforded by the Supreme 
Court’s ruling in Citizens United. The 
chamber knew the power that this de-
cision would grant them. Indeed, it 
filed an amicus brief in that case, tell-
ing the Court to knock out limits on 
so-called outside spending. 
And Citizens United then allowed 
outside groups to spend unlimited sums 
on electioneering activities, which teed 
up the chamber to funnel roughly $150 
million into congressional raises. And 
they bought a lot of climate denial 
with that money. It made them the

largest spender of dark money in con-
gressional races. 
Dark money talks, as we see every 
election on our television screens. But 
every bit as important, dark money 
threatens. 
Republican colleagues have told me 
how this works. When a Republican 
dares to engage with Democrats to do 
something about climate change, a 
warning shot flies above their head. 
Chamber 
dark 
money 
and 
threats 
killed Republican support for substan-
tial climate legislation. 
When I got here in the Senate in 2007, 
there was a steady heartbeat of bipar-
tisan climate activity, climate bill 
after climate bill, hearing after hear-
ing. John McCain ran for President as 
a Republican with a strong climate 
platform. That all dropped dead in 2010 
with that Citizens United dark money 
power in the hands of the chamber of 
commerce, which brings us to the 
present day. 
American corporations, today, need 
to tell consumers and shareholders 
that they care about climate change. 
They need to for a couple of reasons. 
First, some of them actually are get-
ting hurt by climate change—big insur-
ers, the tourism industry, agribusiness. 
Tropical cyclones, more frequent heat 
waves, floods and droughts, more in-
tense wildfires, higher sea levels—these 
things cost American businesses enor-
mous amounts of money. According to 
NOAA, America sustained over 300 
weather- and climate-related disasters 
since 1980, where the damage in that 
disaster topped a billion dollars and 
the total damage among all those dis-
asters is over $2 trillion—$2 trillion 
lost to uncontrolled climate change, 
thanks to dark money efforts by the 
fossil fuel industry and, specifically, 
its operative, the ‘‘U.S. Chamber of 
Carbon.’’ 
Of course, consumers expect corpora-
tions to face up to the climate threat. 
The public wants us to do something 
and big brands like Coke and Pepsi 
need to say the right things when it 
comes to climate. And many of these 
companies have great internal climate 
policies within the corporation. But 
then—but then—those companies turn 
around and they pay dues to the ‘‘U.S. 
Chamber of Carbon.’’ And the cham-
ber—the corporate serial killer of all 
things climate in this building—goes 
out and kills the things that the com-
panies say they want. 
According to a new report from the 
watchdog 
group 
InfluenceMap, 
the 
chamber remains one of the biggest im-
pediments to climate action in Amer-
ica. They said: 
There has been no material improvement 
in the Chamber’s climate change policy en-
gagement over the past five years, despite its 
positive ‘‘high-level messaging’’ on climate. 
InfluenceMap concluded in this re-
port last month: 
The organization remains a significant 
blockage to U.S. climate policy. 
And it is supported by a whole swath 
of corporate America. 
Many of us want a phone call with 
TechNet, the Silicon Valley trade asso-
ciation. Ten of its members are mem-
bers of the ‘‘Chamber of Carbon.’’ They 
fund climate denial. They think they 
are doing the right thing on climate, 
but they are not. They are paying the 
biggest monster in the middle of a cli-
mate denial operation in this country. 
So when Coke and Pepsi pay dues to 
the ‘‘Chamber of Carbon,’’ Coke and 
Pepsi’s corporate net effect on climate 
legislation goes negative. The chamber 
keeps secret how much the fossil fuel 
industry paid it to turn the chamber 
into a ‘‘worst climate obstructor.’’ It 
has corralled its pro-climate members 
into what it calls a ‘‘climate conversa-
tion’’ that has been going on since 2019. 
I know that because I kicked it off. I 
thought something good might happen. 
But what has happened in that climate 
conversation since 2019 is that any-
thing good on climate gets routed by 
the chamber into that climate con-
versation from which nothing serious 
has emerged in more than 2 years. It is 
where the good climate policy goes to 
die. It is the black hole of good climate 
action. 
In the meanwhile, all the climate 
evil that doesn’t get sent to the cli-
mate conversation goes straight by and 
out into chamber operations. At the 
end, the effect is clear: The ‘‘Chamber 
of Carbon’’ works the will of the fossil 
fuel 
industry 
and 
blocks 
climate 
progress in Congress, and it does so 
with corporate America’s acceptance 
and financial support. 
If the IPC is right that this is last 
call, that this is dangerous, that this is 
our make-or-break, do-or-die moment, 
then it is time for corporate America 
to tell the ‘‘Chamber of Carbon’’ to 
knock it off or to quit and disassociate 
themselves from the ‘‘worst climate 
obstructor’’ in America. We should no 
longer tolerate this. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. 
LANKFORD. 
Mr. 
President, 
there has been a lot of conversation in 
the past several weeks about Judge 
Jackson’s judicial philosophy—right-
fully so. This is a lifetime appointment 
on the U.S. Supreme Court. It is a seri-
ous position. I don’t know a single Sen-
ator in this room that doesn’t take 
their responsibility seriously. This is a 
big issue when you put anyone on the 
Supreme Court for a life appointment. 
Everyone has had the opportunity to 
be able to go through case law, cases 
that she has handled, things she re-
sponded to, things that she has writ-
ten, ways that she has responded. Actu-
ally, I had time last week to sit down 
with her for about 45 minutes in the of-
fice just to be able to talk and to be 
able to get back-and-forth with her a 
little bit. 
I want to give a little bit of context 
to 
that 
because 
many 
Americans 
watched all the hearings that happened 
last week—a full week of just conversa-
tion with her, asking her all kinds of 
different questions. I don’t serve on the 
Judiciary Committee so I am on the 
outside looking in. That is why I got 
time individually with her for about 45 
minutes to be able to ask her questions 
and get to know her. 
By the way, I had folks in Oklahoma 
say: You had the opportunity to sit 
down with her; what is she like? 
To all of them, I answered the same 
way. She is actually the kind of person 
you would want to invite over for din-
ner, just to be able to sit and visit 
with—extremely 
pleasant, 
outgoing, 
personable, smart, sharp, wonderful 
smile and interaction. You would want 
to invite her over to dinner to be able 
to visit with. 
But my decision is not about whether 
to invite her over for dinner to be able 
to spend time with. My decision is, 
How will they handle a lifetime ap-
pointment on the Supreme Court and 
how will they handle the law? 
The difficult part of this conversa-
tion has been interesting. It really cir-
cled around judicial philosophy. How 
would you handle cases? 
We can’t ask: How are you going to 
actually rule on this specific case? Be-
cause if she answers, then she has to 
recuse herself from that case in the 
days ahead, and everyone knows that. 
So we are always trying to deter-
mine: How will you treat cases in the 
days ahead and what lens will you look 
through? That is a reasonable con-
versation. 
Her response has been interesting. 
Her response was that she had a ‘‘meth-
odology’’ as a judge, and it has three 
aspects to it: Neutrality, which is a 
good thing; receiving all the appro-
priate inputs, which is making sure ev-
eryone is heard; and looking at the fac-
tual record and the text of the statute. 
That is actually a very good starting 
point with this. 
The question then goes to the next 
set of questions on it: How do you han-
dle the U.S. Constitution and where 
does that document fit in? Is it living? 
Is it changing? Is it the original text 
and the meaning of it, or does it have 
a living version that changes? 
That is a reasonable conversation be-
cause there have been different Jus-
tices on the Supreme Court that have 
handled that differently. 
The late Justice William Brennan 
wrote: 
For the genius of the Constitution rests 
not in any static meaning it might have had 
in a world that is dead and gone, but in the 
adaptability of its great principles to cope 
with current problems and current needs. 
Well, that is not an original meaning 
in the original context and locked into 
that. 
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote: 
The Constitution that I interpret and 
apply is not living, but [it is] dead, or as I 
prefer to call it, enduring. It means, today, 
not what current society, much less the 
court, thinks it ought to mean, but what it 
meant when it was adopted. 
In other words, those words had 
meaning at that time. They couldn’t

predict what those words might mean 
100 years from now. They could only 
deal with what those words mean right 
now. And if it is going to have a dif-
ferent meaning at a different time, 
well, then, there has to be different law 
to be able to deal with that at a dif-
ferent time. We never got a really clear 
answer on that. We get things toward 
her methodology. That is a critical 
issue to be able to deal with. 
There were issues about sentencing 
that came up and how she chose to do 
sentencing when she was at the district 
court level and handled cases. They 
were all over the news about some 
cases that she handled that were very 
lenient in the sentencing. 
There were also a lot of questions 
about the Second Amendment or about 
due process. 
There was kind of the moment of the 
judicial hearings when Senator BLACK-
BURN asked—not a trick question but a 
real 
conversational 
question—about 
how you handle the law and culture. 
And that is, Can you define a woman? 
I honestly don’t think that Senator 
BLACKBURN meant for that to be a trick 
question, but it really is a question in 
culture at this point. It will determine 
how you are going to handle the law 
and to be able to read the law. 
Her response was she couldn’t answer 
the question of how to define a woman 
because she is not a biologist. Well, I 
am not a biologist either, but I think I 
can define that question. And it is just 
a conversational issue that we have as 
a nation to be able to determine: Let’s 
deal with things that are self-evident. 
There were all those issues that were 
dealt with during the hearing time, but 
when I got with her, I didn’t want to go 
back and revisit those issues. I wanted 
to spend time with her talking through 
the things that weren’t actually dis-
cussed. 
Obviously, it was over days of her 
hearings. There were several issues dis-
cussed about how she handles the law. 
One of those is Tribal law. In some 
areas of the country, this is a very big 
deal and in some areas, not at all. So I 
understand why it didn’t come up in 
the hearings. 
In her past history in her cases, she 
has had one case to deal with Tribal 
law. So there are a lot of questions to 
be able to talk about. 
Oklahoma is very proud of who we 
are as a State. We have great diversity 
as a State. We have a unique relation-
ship in Indian Country in our State. I 
thought it was important for us to be 
able to talk about the relationship that 
our State has with 39 Tribes and, quite 
frankly, the history our State has, as 
we were the State where Tribes were 
relocated to from the Southeast. We 
spent a lot of time talking about that. 
We talked about issues of religious 
liberty, First Amendment issues, how 
you handle those cases. There are dif-
ferences even in the Court, even on 
what is the more liberal side of the 
Court. Sotomayor and Kagan often dis-
agreed on issues of religious liberties. 
They handle it with a different perspec-
tive, and it is not uncommon for a reli-
gious liberty case to come up and 
Sotomayor and Kagan to be on either 
side. So, quite frankly, I was trying to 
discern: Is this person more like 
Sotomayor or more like Kagan on how 
to handle the issues of religious lib-
erty? 
It didn’t come up a lot in the hear-
ings, but I really think that is a 
foundational issue. 
Quite frankly, this is the fourth Su-
preme Court Justice I have had the op-
portunity to be able to sit down with 
personally, and with each of them, the 
issues that I just brought up were the 
issues that I talked with all four of 
them about because they don’t often 
come up in the other issues, but to me 
it is foundational. 
We have three branches of govern-
ment defined by our Constitution. 
Those branches are coequal, and they 
check each other. And it is exception-
ally important that they really do 
check each other; that the legislative 
branch doesn’t just give it away to the 
executive branch or to the courts or 
that the legislative branch doesn’t run 
over the courts or the executive branch 
and neither can the executive branch 
or the judicial branch do for either. 
But if the judicial branch sits passive 
at a moment that they should engage, 
the other two branches are not checked 
or if the judicial branch engages in a 
moment when they should be silent, 
they have exceeded their authority as 
well. 
It is exceptionally important that 
the three branches both check each 
other and also know their lane and do 
their lane well. 
There are two cases that popped out 
that became very significant to me and 
were part of our conversation as well. 
There was a case that came up during 
the Trump administration when Judge 
Jackson was at the district court level 
and dealt with this issue of expedited 
removal. Now, it is my guess that she 
doesn’t like the expedited removal 
process in immigration, but I didn’t 
ask that; I didn’t drill down on that, so 
it was only my guess. But what was in-
teresting was she ruled on a case on ex-
pedited removal and forbid the Trump 
administration from actually putting 
in place what they did and did it na-
tionwide. 
The problem was, when that was ap-
pealed up to the DC Circuit Court, the 
DC Circuit Court actually reversed 
Judge Jackson’s preliminary injunc-
tion and reminded Judge Jackson, at 
that point, that the way the law was 
written made this statement: that the 
Secretary had ‘‘sole and unreviewable 
discretion.’’ 
She literally reviewed a decision 
made by a Secretary, where specifi-
cally in the law it stated a judge can-
not review this decision, though she 
overturned it, only to go to the circuit 
court and have them overturn her. 
That tells me a balance of power issue, 
of knowing what your lane is and de-
termining how that lane is taken on. 
There is another case that came up, 
actually during the Trump administra-
tion as well, when Judge Jackson was 
also in the district court, and she dealt 
with the issue about what unions could 
do and what the executive branch could 
do in relationship to unions. 
It has been a contentious issue, quite 
frankly, for decades. It is entirely rea-
sonable to be able to have that kind of 
dialogue about it. She ruled in the 
favor of the unions, and the DC Circuit, 
again, reversed her decision when it 
came there, but it is not just that they 
reversed her decision, it is that they 
reversed her decision, and this was the 
statement from the DC Circuit: 
We reversed because the district court 
lacked subject matter jurisdiction. 
In other words, that is not your re-
sponsibility in that lane. Specifically, 
that kind of issue has to be taken up by 
the Federal Labor Relations Board. In 
statute, it says it can’t go to a district 
court; it has to go to a different place. 
Typically, other judges look at it and 
say, ‘‘You can’t be in this spot to be 
able to argue this,’’ and send it to the 
correct place. Instead, she ruled on it 
in favor of the unions and declared it 
done, until the circuit came back and 
said: That is not your lane. That is ac-
tually the executive branch’s lane. 
And one of the most interesting dia-
logues we had to be able to talk 
through things was the issue about def-
erence. 
Now, why does this matter? Well, for 
about 80 years, Congress has been writ-
ing a law that gets broader and broader 
and broader. Quite frankly, it has been 
a problem with both parties. If we want 
to see something done, we write a 
broad law; we send it to the executive 
branch; and we say figure it out. 
And each executive branch is getting 
more and more creative on how they 
figure it out. And we deal with all 
kinds of regulations, and both parties 
argue with the executive branch and 
say: Why do you do that? And the exec-
utive branch responds back sometimes: 
Well, you gave me the ability to make 
that decision on my own and so I did. 
This issue of deference and of delega-
tion is a very significant constitutional 
principle. It is an issue that we have 
got to resolve here as a body—quite 
frankly, on both sides of the aisle—to 
be jealous of the responsibility that we 
are given in the Constitution. 
But it is also an issue, I think, that 
is very important for the courts to be 
able to engage in because the courts 
are able to step in uniquely to the ex-
ecutive branch in a way the legislative 
branch cannot. The legislative branch 
can complain about it, but the courts 
actually can look at it and say, ‘‘You 
are out of your lane,’’ to the executive 
branch. 
And if the court is passive in this, 
then whoever the executive is gets to 
run. One of the clearest examples of 
those is something that is called Chev-
ron deference or our deference. I won’t 
go into all the details on it, but it basi-
cally says, if a piece of legislation, the

way that it is written, is ambiguous, 
then the executive branch can inter-
pret it the way that they choose. 
I have a problem with that interpre-
tation because I believe if the law was 
written poorly, we shouldn’t just give 
it to the executive branch and say: Fig-
ure it out. What do you want it to 
mean? If it doesn’t mean something 
clearly, it doesn’t mean anything at 
all. 
Now it is about two issues: One is a 
constitutional issue. If you go back to 
1803, 
Marbury 
v. 
Madison 
is 
a 
foundational piece for the Supreme 
Court. This is the piece that has come 
up over and over again over the last 
two centuries. 
The 
foundational 
statement 
that 
came out of Marbury v. Madison was 
this simple statement: 
It is emphatically the duty of the judicial 
department to say what the law is. 
If the judicial hands to the executive 
and says, ‘‘We can’t tell what the law 
says, so we will give it to you,’’ it is 
literally the judicial handing to the ex-
ecutive something that is uniquely the 
judicial’s power. 
Now, this is no simple issue. This 
goes back to our balance of power. 
What we have is a situation now over 
the past several decades where Con-
gress has given its power to the execu-
tive branch. If the judicial branch does 
the same, giving its power to the exec-
utive branch, we have a rising execu-
tive branch and the other two bodies 
will look at it and say: How did that 
happen? Because we gave it away is 
how it happened. And we have a more 
and more powerful President of either 
party and a less and less powerful Con-
gress and judicial branch. 
In my conversation with Judge Jack-
son, she repeated over and over to me 
that the court is limited, the court is 
limited, the court is limited. And I 
said, yes, they are limited, but they 
have a responsibility, and the court’s 
responsibility is to say what the law is. 
And at the moment—as I said to her, 
if I threw letters on the table, the exec-
utive branch doesn’t have the ability 
to say: I will make them say whatever 
I want to. 
I can’t—if a law was written and the 
law said, ‘‘Orange, penny, Ford, desk, 
Reagan,’’ now all those are English 
words, but, quite frankly, they don’t 
really make a sentence. The authority 
shouldn’t be given to the executive 
branch to be able to figure out what 
they could make of that. The responsi-
bility should be in the judicial branch 
to be able to look at that and say: That 
means nothing. Congress, go do your 
homework. Clean it up. 
The executive branch can’t just make 
it mean what they want it to say and 
say what the law is. Congress has to 
say make it clear and the judicial 
branch has to say what the law is and 
the executive branch has to apply it. 
Now, 
again, 
this 
is 
very 
philo-
sophical, but it is also foundational in 
our constitutional construct. It is why 
I find myself in the position of voting 
no for someone I personally liked when 
I met her but do not align with on how 
you handle the Constitution, separa-
tion of powers, and the responsibility 
of the court to align with original in-
tent of the Constitution. 
This is not a new dialogue for us in 
the Senate body. It is a conversation 
we have had for two centuries that is 
still unresolved for us. But we cannot 
select individuals that are not com-
mitted to the original meaning of the 
Constitution and can hand to the exec-
utive branch what the law says. This is 
one that we need to guard. 
And so for that reason, when the vote 
comes tomorrow on Judge Jackson, I 
will vote no. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Ms. BALDWIN. I rise today in strong 
support of Judge Ketanji Brown Jack-
son’s confirmation as our Nation’s next 
Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Oftentimes, the debate in the Senate 
on judicial nominations loses sight of 
the personal stories of those who are 
put before us, so let me start there. 
Let me start by talking about where 
Ketanji Brown Jackson came from to 
reach this extraordinary point where 
we are poised to write an important 
chapter of progress in our Nation’s his-
tory. 
Ketanji Brown Jackson was born in 
our Nation’s Capital and grew up in 
Miami. She is the daughter of two 
former public school teachers, who 
themselves were raised in the Jim 
Crow South. Two of Judge Jackson’s 
uncles were police officers in Miami, 
one who ultimately became the police 
chief. Her brother served in the U.S. 
Army and as a police officer in Balti-
more. 
Judge 
Jackson 
attended 
public 
school 
in 
the 
Miami-Dade 
County 
school system. She credits her father 
for starting her on a path to the law, as 
he went back to school to earn a law 
degree and became a lawyer working 
for the school board. 
Family, education, hard work, public 
service, all guiding Judge Jackson on 
the path that brought her to this mo-
ment, to today. 
She was elected mayor of her junior 
high school class and president of her 
high school class. She grew to be a 
standout on the speech and debate 
team. And when her high school coun-
selor told her not to set her sights too 
high, she never accepted the limits of 
others—she persevered. 
Judge 
Jackson 
went 
to 
Harvard 
where she graduated magna cum laude. 
She went to Harvard Law School where 
she was a top student and editor of the 
prestigious Law Review. 
Following 
graduation 
from 
law 
school, this nominee worked for three 
consecutive 
Federal 
judges, 
culmi-
nating with a clerkship from 1999 to 
2000 for Supreme Court Justice Breyer. 
As Judge Jackson has said, this is 
the lesson she took from her experi-
ence: 
Justice Breyer exemplified every day, in 
every way, that a Supreme Court Justice can 
perform at the highest level of skill and in-
tegrity while also being guided by civility, 
grace, pragmatism and generosity of spirit. 
Guided by her belief in the power and 
promise of the Constitution and this 
Nation’s founding principles—freedom, 
liberty, and equality—Judge Jackson 
went on to serve as an assistant Fed-
eral public defender in the DC Circuit, 
representing defendants who did not 
have the means to pay for a lawyer. 
When confirmed, Judge Jackson will 
be the first former Federal public de-
fender to serve on the U.S. Supreme 
Court. And to me, this is an extremely 
important qualification that Judge 
Jackson holds and will bring with her 
to the Supreme Court. 
As a former public defender, she had 
firsthand 
experience 
delivering 
the 
Constitution’s promise of due process. 
This promise, given to all Americans 
without regard to financial means or 
political connections, is an essential 
element of our system of justice. 
We all should want this experience 
and the perspective it brings on our 
highest Court because it is a funda-
mental protection in our justice sys-
tem. 
Judge Jackson has been confirmed by 
the U.S. Senate three times previously. 
She was first confirmed by the Senate 
to serve as the Vice Chair of the U.S. 
Sentencing Commission. Following in 
the footsteps of Justice Breyer, she 
would become the only member of the 
current Court who previously served as 
a member of that bipartisan, inde-
pendent commission dedicated to re-
ducing sentencing disparities and pro-
moting transparency and proportion-
ality in sentencing. 
Next, after President Obama nomi-
nated Judge Jackson to be a district 
court judge for the District of Colum-
bia, she was once again confirmed by 
the U.S. Senate in 2013. During Judge 
Jackson’s 8 years on the bench as a dis-
trict judge, she issued more than 500 
written opinions. And last year, she 
was again confirmed by the U.S. Sen-
ate with bipartisan support to serve on 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Dis-
trict of Columbia Circuit. 
In confirming her to each of these po-
sitions, the Senate voiced its con-
fidence in Judge Jackson’s character, 
integrity, and intelligence. Experience 
matters, and the fact is, Judge Jackson 
is as qualified and experienced in the 
law as any nominee in our Nation’s his-
tory, bringing more experience as a 
judge than four of the current Justices 
did combined at the time they joined 
the Court. This strong experience has 
provided her a clear understanding of 
the role of a judge and the role of the 
judiciary in our system of government. 
As she has said herself, ‘‘A judge has 
a duty to decide cases based solely on 
the law, without fear or favor, preju-
dice or passion.’’ 
That is precisely why she has a prov-
en record of being faithful to the Con-
stitution and being an independent,

fair, and impartial judge. That is why 
Judge Jackson has earned the support 
of the law enforcement community, in-
cluding the Fraternal Order of Police 
and the International Association of 
Chiefs of Police, as well as victims of 
crime, including domestic violence and 
sexual assault survivors. 
I had the pleasure and, in fact, joy of 
meeting with Judge Jackson last week. 
No fairminded person can deny her im-
pressive credentials and experience, 
and no one should deny the moment 
she has rightfully earned to be consid-
ered for a seat on the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
Our meeting wasn’t long, but it was 
long enough for me to know that she 
has a quality that everyone we work 
for wants in a judge and certainly in a 
Justice on the Supreme Court. She 
knows how to listen, and I have every 
confidence that Judge Jackson under-
stands how important that quality is 
for a judge to carry out their responsi-
bility and commitment to the rule of 
law. 
Judge Jackson’s lifetime of hard 
work and perseverance has prepared 
her well for this inspiring moment. I 
believe the people I work for in Wis-
consin agree. 
A young high school student in Mil-
waukee recently said: 
Knowing she is the first person to do that, 
it like, gives me the idea that I can do big 
stuff too. 
Jada Davis, the first Black woman to 
be crowned Miss Milwaukee and a law 
student at Marquette University, said 
this: 
The more you see yourself in other people 
the more confidence you will have to do 
those same things or go after what you want. 
I know Judge Jackson has the char-
acter, temperament, and experience we 
want in a Justice on our highest Court. 
I also know what this moment means 
to thousands of girls across Wisconsin 
who, after Judge Brown Jackson’s con-
firmation, will have even more proof 
that they can achieve ‘‘big stuff’’ too. 
I believe she has a deep appreciation 
for the fact that the Supreme Court 
makes decisions that have a profound 
effect on the lives of all Americans and 
that she will work to serve and protect 
the constitutional rights and freedoms 
of all Americans. 
I will proudly vote for this historic 
confirmation, 
the 
confirmation 
of 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the 
United States Supreme Court. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KELLY). The Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am 
honored to follow my colleague from 
Wisconsin, and I rise as well regarding 
the 
nomination 
of 
Judge 
Ketanji 
Brown Jackson to serve as an Asso-
ciate Justice on the Supreme Court of 
the United States. 
As some of you will recall, one of our 
colleagues from New Jersey, Senator 
BOOKER, delivered unusually poignant 
and unscripted remarks recently in the 
Senate Judiciary Committee about 
Judge Jackson’s nomination and cre-
dentials and character. He moved many 
of those who were present to tears and 
spelled out as only he can what this 
nomination means for our Nation and 
particularly for the millions of Black 
Americans who look at Judge Jackson 
and see their own mothers, their own 
daughters, their own sisters, and their 
own friends. 
Unfazed by the unfair attacks that 
day on Judge Jackson, our colleague 
said these words: 
Nobody is going to steal my joy. 
I second that emotion. This historic 
moment and this historic nominee 
bring me great joy as well. 
For the next several minutes, I am 
going to talk about Judge Jackson’s 
impeccable qualifications. I am going 
to discuss her sterling record as a pub-
lic servant, including nearly a decade 
as a Federal judge, that makes her su-
premely qualified to serve on our Su-
preme Court. 
I also want to talk for a bit about the 
historic nature of this nomination and 
attempt to put in context just what it 
means for our Nation and for me per-
sonally to cast a vote to confirm the 
first Black woman to serve on the Su-
preme Court, because today, indeed, it 
brings a lot of us real joy in this body 
to know that we have the opportunity 
and the privilege to play a small part 
in Judge Jackson’s confirmation. 
Similar to President Reagan deliv-
ering on his promise years ago to nomi-
nate the first woman—Justice Sandra 
Day O’Connor—to the Supreme Court, 
President Biden has delivered on his 
own promise. He has nominated the 
first Black woman to the highest Court 
in our land, and our Nation can be 
proud of the nominee we are here to de-
bate and to confirm. 
Let me begin, however, by taking 
just a moment to thank Justice Ste-
phen Breyer for his exemplary service 
to our country. 
As many of our colleagues know, Jus-
tice Breyer was nominated to the Su-
preme Court by President Clinton in 
1994, when I was serving as Governor of 
Delaware. Our Presiding Officer was an 
astronaut up in the ether above our 
planet. Justice Breyer was confirmed, 
some will recall, by an overwhelming 
bipartisan vote—87 to 9. 
Justice Breyer served our country 
with distinction for over six decades, 
including as a corporal in the Army 
Reserve, a Federal circuit court judge, 
and for nearly three decades on the 
Bench of the highest Court in our land. 
Justice Breyer is known as a con-
sensus builder on the Bench—a trait I 
have long admired in judges dating 
back to my time as Governor of Dela-
ware, when I had the opportunity to 
nominate literally dozens of highly 
qualified individuals to serve on Dela-
ware’s highly respected courts. Over 
the past three decades, Justice Breyer 
has 
helped 
forge 
principled 
com-
promises to protect the constitutional 
rights of all Americans and to uphold 
the rule of law. 
During a small ceremony at the 
White House in January when Justice 
Breyer first announced that he would 
be retiring, he brought with him a 
pocket copy of the U.S. Constitution. 
In his brief remarks, Justice Breyer re-
minded us of how Lincoln and Wash-
ington and so many other giants of 
American history have described that 
document, our Constitution. They de-
scribed it as an experiment. 
As Justice Breyer reminded us, dur-
ing the time of Washington and Lin-
coln, there were plenty of folks who 
doubted our system of government 
could ever work, plenty of folks who 
said: Well, that is a great idea in prin-
ciple, but it will never work, at least 
not for long. But, as Justice Breyer 
said that day—he said: It is our job to 
show them that it does work and it will 
continue to work. 
Our Constitution has made possible 
the greatest experiment in democracy 
in the history of the world. Over the 
past several years, I have spoken any 
number of times on the Senate floor 
about the wisdom of the Framers of 
our Constitution. In the hot summer of 
1787, they met in Philadelphia, as you 
will recall, and designed an intricate 
system of checks and balances. Article 
I dealt with the Congress; article II 
dealt with the executive branch of our 
government; and article III, the judici-
ary. 
America is the longest running ex-
periment in democracy, and our Con-
stitution is more replicated across the 
globe than any other Constitution in 
the world. But our Constitution has 
never been perfect. The Framers never 
pretended that it was perfect. 
This past weekend, I was privileged 
to give the keynote address during a 
commissioning ceremony at the Port of 
Wilmington for a new Virginia-class, 
fast-attack, nuclear submarine that 
bears the name of Delaware—the first 
Navy vessel named after the State of 
Delaware in over 100 years. At the end 
of my remarks, there was a crowd of 
about several thousand people gathered 
on the Delaware River, right beside the 
submarine and its crew. Among the 
folks in that crowd were the President 
of our country and the First Lady of 
the United States, Dr. Jill Biden, who 
was the sponsor of the boat. 
I asked everyone there to stand and 
hold hands and join me in reciting the 
preamble to the Constitution, which 
begins something like this: 
We the People of the United States, in 
Order to form a more perfect Union— 
It doesn’t say ‘‘a perfect Union’’; 
rather, it says ‘‘a more perfect Union.’’ 
Why is that? Because our Framers un-
derstood that this would be an experi-
ment and that it would be up to each 
generation that follows to decide how 
this experiment will proceed and if it 
will succeed, up to each generation to 
face those who say that this great ex-
periment in democracy will never 
work. 
It is through our actions on days like 
this that we show them that it does

still work. Judge Jackson’s nomination 
is proof that, indeed, we have made 
this Nation more perfect over time and 
that despite our divisions—and we have 
them—generations of Americans have 
worked together, often across party 
lines, across State lines, across philo-
sophical lines, to make a nomination 
like this possible. 
Like many Americans, I have seen 
remarkable progress in my own life-
time. While my sister and I were born 
in a coal-mining town in Beckley, WV, 
we were raised in Danville, VA, right 
on the North Carolina border, just 
north of Greensboro. 
Danville, VA, was known as the Last 
Capital of the Confederacy. Forced to 
flee Richmond after Union victories 
started piling up in early 1865, Confed-
erate President Jefferson Davis actu-
ally held his Cabinet’s last meeting— 
their last meeting—in Danville, where 
I grew up. He did that a few days before 
Lee surrendered to Grant at Appo-
mattox. 
Although it was nearly a century 
after the Civil War ended when my 
family moved to Delaware—nearly a 
century—racial prejudice and discrimi-
nation still prevailed there. 
Growing up, my sister and I wit-
nessed racism up close and personal. 
Every 
morning, 
for 
example, 
our 
schoolbus would take us to an all- 
White high school 10 miles away from 
our home, and about half an hour later, 
another schoolbus would come by and 
pick up Black students who had been 
waiting along with us and take them to 
their school, past my school and an-
other 10 miles to their school, which 
was not a better school. It was a school 
that none of us would be especially 
proud of. 
If my sister and I went to lunch with 
our family, we would sit at the lunch 
counter, but Black families were de-
nied service. 
If we went to the movie theater in 
Danville, VA, we sat on the ground 
floor; the Black patrons had to sit up 
in the balcony. 
That is the America many of us lived 
in not all that long ago—the same 
America that Judge Jackson’s parents, 
Johnny and Ellery Brown, were born 
into. It was an America where dis-
crimination on the basis of race was 
sanctioned by State governments; an 
America where the judicial doctrine of 
‘‘separate but equal’’ was still en-
shrined into our laws by the Supreme 
Court; where arbitrary literacy tests 
kept Black Americans away from poll 
booths; an America that treated back 
Americans like second-class citizens 
despite a civil war, an Emancipation 
Proclamation, and ratification of the 
13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to our 
Constitution. It was an America that 
was far from perfect. 
But through decades of struggle, and 
thanks to the heroes of the civil rights 
movement, our Nation began to con-
front injustice in our communities and 
inequality in our laws. And thanks to 
brilliant Black lawyers like Thurgood 
Marshall and Wilmington, Delaware’s 
Louis Redding, a number of legal chal-
lenges to America’s separate but un-
equal classrooms went all the way to 
the Supreme Court. 
And perhaps the greatest decision in 
the Supreme Court’s history, Brown v. 
Board of Education declared to the Na-
tion that the principle of separate but 
equal could never truly be equal. 
Brown v. Board of Education did not 
make our Nation perfect. But it was 
proof that when the Supreme Court is 
at its best, America and our Constitu-
tion are at their best. 
The Supreme Court changed the 
America that my sister and I lived in— 
that Judge Jackson’s parents lived in— 
for the better. Combined with the land-
mark civil rights bills of the 1960s, in-
cluding the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it made 
the America that Judge Jackson was 
born into more perfect than it was for 
the generations that came before her. 
And I hope and pray that each gen-
eration will continue to recognize the 
uniquely American opportunity that 
our Constitution affords us—the ability 
to change our communities and our 
laws for the better—and take on the 
task themselves. 
As Judge Jackson stated in her con-
firmation hearing, her parents taught 
her that—and I want to quote her. This 
is a quote from her: 
Unlike the many barriers that they had to 
face growing up, my path was clearer, such 
that if I worked hard and believed in myself, 
in America I could do anything or be any-
thing I wanted to be. 
And, my goodness, did she work hard. 
The daughter of two graduates of 
HBCU colleges, Judge Jackson was a 
star on her high school debate team 
and was elected ‘‘mayor’’ of Palmetto 
Junior High School and student body 
president of Miami Palmetto Senior 
High School. Judge Jackson then grad-
uated magna cum laude from Harvard 
University and cum laude from Har-
vard Law School, where she was an edi-
tor of the Harvard Law Review. She 
clerked for not one, not two, but three 
Federal judges, including for Supreme 
Court Justice Stephen Breyer. 
Judge Jackson could have done any-
thing she wanted with a resume like 
that—anything—including 
pursuing 
any number of well-paying opportuni-
ties in the legal profession. Instead, 
Judge Jackson chose public service, in 
part because service was instilled in 
her by her parents, both of whom were 
public schoolteachers. And public serv-
ice, no doubt, runs in her family. 
Her younger brother felt a similar 
call to serve. After graduating from an-
other fine HBCU university, Howard 
University right here in Washington, 
Judge Jackson’s brother enlisted—en-
listed—in the U.S. Army right after the 
9/11 attacks. He was deployed to Iraq. 
He also ended up going to Egypt. And 
then following in the footsteps of two 
of Judge Jackson’s uncles, he became a 
Baltimore police officer. 
When I had the opportunity to meet 
with Judge Jackson in my office last 
month, we talked about a wide range of 
things. Among them, we talked about 
the diversity of her professional experi-
ence, including her time as a public de-
fender right here in the Nation’s Cap-
ital. 
As most of us know, public defenders 
work very long hours for very little 
pay. They represent clients who cannot 
afford an expensive lawyer, and in 
some cases, they cannot afford any 
lawyer at all. But our system of gov-
ernment affords every person charged 
with a crime the presumption of inno-
cence, the right to a fair trial, and the 
right to a competent defense. 
It is a testament to the character of 
Judge Jackson that she is so com-
mitted to equal justice under the law 
that she was willing to commit the 
early stages of her career to this im-
portant work. 
If confirmed, Judge Jackson would be 
the first Supreme Court Justice to 
have served as a Federal public de-
fender in this Court’s long, storied his-
tory and the first with significant 
criminal defense experience since Jus-
tice Marshall. 
Now, in 2005, I voted to confirm Chief 
Justice John Roberts to the Supreme 
Court; not every Democrat did that. As 
you may recall, he was appointed by 
former President George W. Bush, a 
Republican. Some of my colleagues 
might remember, before Chief Justice 
Roberts was ever nominated to a Fed-
eral judgeship, he worked in private 
practice where his firm represented an 
individual appealing a death penalty 
conviction for the murder of eight peo-
ple. 
During his 2005 confirmation hearing 
to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice 
Roberts was asked about it and stat-
ed—and I want to quote him right now. 
Here is what he said: 
In representing clients, in serving as a law-
yer, it’s not my job to decide whether that’s 
a good idea or a bad idea. The job of the law-
yer is to articulate the legal argument on be-
half of the client. 
Chief Justice Roberts likened this 
work to John Adams defending British 
soldiers after the Boston Massacre, 
saying that Adams: 
. . . helped show that what our [Founding 
Fathers] were about was defending the rule 
of law, not undermining it. And that prin-
ciple that you don’t identify the lawyer with 
the particular views of a client or the views 
that the lawyer advances on behalf of the cli-
ent is critical to the fair administration of 
justice. 
Like Chief Justice Roberts, Judge 
Jackson has lived up to the values set 
out over 230 years ago, and in doing so, 
she has protected and defended our 
Constitution. 
After her time as a public defender, 
Judge Jackson served as a vice chair 
for the U.S. Sentencing Commission. 
She was confirmed unanimously by the 
U.S. Senate. 
Judge Jackson was then nominated 
to the U.S. District Court for the Dis-
trict of Columbia. She was confirmed 
unanimously by the U.S. Senate for 
that post.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2031 
April 6, 2022 
And last year, President Biden nomi-
nated Judge Jackson to serve on the 
DC Circuit Court of Appeals, often-
times referred to as our Nation’s sec-
ond highest court. Yet again, she was 
confirmed by the U.S. Senate with bi-
partisan support. 
During the decade that she served as 
a Federal judge, Judge Jackson estab-
lished a track record as a consensus 
builder, just like Justice Breyer. Dur-
ing the decade that she served as a 
Federal judge, Judge Jackson has been 
evenhanded and she has been impartial. 
During the decade that she has served 
as a Federal judge, Judge Jackson has 
ruled for and against the government, 
in favor of prosecutors and for criminal 
defendants, and for both civil plaintiffs 
and defendants. 
As Judge Jackson told our colleagues 
on the Judiciary Committee recently, 
she has, she said: 
a duty to decide cases based solely on the 
law, without fear or favor, prejudice or pas-
sion. 
Judge Jackson is always guided by 
our Constitution. And it is why she re-
ceived the support of judges nominated 
by Democrat and Republicans alike, by 
law enforcement and the civil rights 
community, and by Republicans and 
Democrats in this body on multiple oc-
casions. 
Now, these past few weeks, I heard 
some of our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle use this confirmation 
process to mention the unfairness to-
ward past nominees. Well, every one of 
these nominees—every nominee that 
they referred to received a hearing and 
a vote. The same cannot be said of 
Merrick Garland, former chief justice 
of the DC Court of Appeals who was 
nominated by former President Obama 
to serve on the Supreme Court. Judge 
Garland did not receive a hearing. 
Judge Garland did not receive a vote 
because our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle decided to invent a 
new rule, and most of them even re-
fused to meet with Merrick Garland, 
one of the finest servants I have ever 
known. And this shameful blockade led 
to what many Americans, myself in-
cluded, view as a stolen Supreme Court 
seat, a permanent stain on this body’s 
reputation and a reduction in the Su-
preme Court’s credibility. 
Then 4 years later, our colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle broke their 
own precedent and invented yet an-
other new rule to confirm a Supreme 
Court Justice 8 days—8 days before 
election day, when tens of millions of 
ballots had already been cast. 
And while I will never forget this 
truly shameful behavior, this week we 
have a chance to move away from poli-
tics. We have a chance to place an ex-
tremely well-qualified nominee to the 
Supreme Court and to do so with the 
support of Senators from both sides of 
the aisle. 
In the end, the American people need 
to trust the Supreme Court to make 
decisions on questions that impact 
every single American: whether we 
have access to clean air is one of those 
issues, whether we have access to clean 
water, whether we have access to good 
healthcare, whether women have the 
right to make their own healthcare de-
cisions. We need a Supreme Court that 
stays above the political fray. We need 
a Supreme Court that calls ‘‘balls and 
strikes,’’ as Chief Justice Roberts once 
said—a Supreme Court that maintains 
the trust of the American people as the 
arbiter of a Constitution that protects 
the civil rights of all Americans. 
Judge Jackson will bring a breadth 
and a diversity of experience to the Su-
preme Court not often seen. Judge 
Jackson’s resume—Harvard; Harvard 
Law; clerk to three Federal judges, in-
cluding Justice Breyer; a public de-
fender; U.S. Sentencing Commission 
vice chairman; Federal district court 
judge; 
and 
Federal 
Circuit 
Court 
judge—is evidence that she is among 
the most-qualified individuals in our 
country for this esteemed role. 
Her character and her intellect are 
beyond reproach. She weathered a 
grueling confirmation process with 
grace and dignity. 
Let me close by noting that Judge 
Jackson’s nomination is proof that 
today in America one’s qualifications 
and unrelenting work ethic earn you 
your spot, that public service is valued 
and commitment to the principles that 
protect our country do mean some-
thing, that the sacrifices of one genera-
tion slowly but surely make for a bet-
ter America for the next generation. 
So count me among the millions of 
Americans who are inspired by Judge 
Jackson’s life story, a uniquely Amer-
ican story that provides proof that our 
Nation can be made more perfect over 
time. 
And it brings this Senator from Dela-
ware, who grew up in Danville, the last 
capital of the Confederacy, into a much 
different America. It brings me great 
joy to be able to cast a vote for Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as an 
Associate Justice on the Supreme 
Court of the United States. 
And with that I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
MOTIONS TO INSTRUCT CONFEREES 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I look 
forward to offering two rollcall votes 
on motions to instruct conferees to the 
so-called ‘‘competitiveness’’ bill based 
on the assurances given to me by the 
majority leader. I am not quite sure 
when we are going to get to that, but I 
look forward to offering those two roll-
call votes. 
The first motion would instruct the 
conference committee not to provide 
$53 billion to the highly profitable 
microchip industry without protec-
tions for the American people. 
The second motion would instruct 
conferees not to provide a $10 billion 
bailout to Blue Origin, a space com-
pany owned by Jeff Bezos, the second- 
wealthiest person in America, who is 
also the owner of Amazon. Amazon is a 
company which, in a given year, pays 
nothing—zero—in Federal income taxes 
after making billions in profits; and, by 
the way, in a given year, Mr. Bezos 
himself, one of the wealthiest people in 
the country, has paid nothing in Fed-
eral income taxes despite being worth 
nearly $200 billion. 
Let me be very clear. Mr. Bezos has 
enough money to buy a very beautiful 
$500 million yacht. It looks very nice to 
me, not that I know much about 
yachts; but that one looks very nice. 
Mr. Bezos has enough money to pur-
chase a $23 million mansion with 25 
bathrooms. I am not quite sure you 
need 25 bathrooms, but that is not my 
business—and here is that mansion. So, 
no, count me in as somebody who does 
not think that the taxpayers of this 
country need to provide Mr. Bezos a $10 
billion bailout to fuel his space hobby. 
When all is said and done, both of 
these motions are—the one on $53 bil-
lion for the microchip industry and $10 
billion for Mr. Bezos—touch on an ex-
tremely important issue that is very 
rarely discussed in the corporate media 
or on the floor of the Senate, and that 
is how we proceed—how we go forward 
with industrial policy in this country. 
I should be very clear in saying I be-
lieve in industrial policy. I believe that 
it makes sense on certain occasions for 
the government and the private sector 
to work together in a mutually bene-
ficial way to address a pressing need in 
America. 
Industrial policy, to me, means co-
operation between the government and 
the private sector—cooperation. It does 
not mean the government providing 
massive amounts of corporate welfare 
to extremely profitable corporations 
without getting anything in return: 
Here is your check. Do what you want. 
Have a nice day. 
In other words, will the U.S. Govern-
ment develop an industrial policy that 
benefits all of our society or will we 
continue to have an industrial policy 
that benefits just the wealthy and the 
powerful? 
In 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
said: 
The problem is that we all too often have 
socialism for the rich and rugged free enter-
prise capitalism for the poor. 
I am afraid that what Dr. King said 
54 years ago was not only accurate 
back then but is even more accurate 
today. 
We hear a lot of talk around here 
about the need to create public-private 
partnerships. That all sounds very 
good, but when the government adopts 
an industrial policy that socializes all 
of the risk and privatizes all of the 
profits, whether it is handing the 
microchip industry a $53 billion blank 
check or giving Mr. Bezos a $10 billion 
bailout to fly to the Moon, that is not 
a partnership. That is the exact oppo-
site of a partnership. That is corporate 
welfare. That is crony capitalism. 
Each and every day, I have heard my 
Republican colleagues and some cor-
porate Democrats blame inflation on 
runaway government spending. In fact,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2032 
April 6, 2022 
one of my colleagues in the Democratic 
caucus has even suggested that we need 
to take a strategic pause when it 
comes to making urgent Federal in-
vestments in childcare, healthcare, 
education, 
affordable 
housing, 
paid 
family and medical leave, and home 
healthcare—policies that would sub-
stantially improve the lives of the 
American people. Well, you know what 
I believe. I believe that maybe—just 
maybe—the time has come to take a 
strategic pause when it comes to pro-
viding tens of billions of dollars in cor-
porate welfare to some of the most 
profitable corporations and wealthiest 
people on this planet. 
The American people are becoming 
increasingly sick and tired of corpora-
tions making recordbreaking profits 
while ordinary people struggle to pay 
outrageously higher prices for gas, for 
rent, for food. They are sick and tired 
of the high cost of prescription drugs, 
childcare, housing, groceries. They are 
sick and tired of CEOs making 350 
times more than the average worker 
while over half of our people live pay-
check to paycheck. The American peo-
ple are sick and tired of the wealthiest 
people in our country and the most 
profitable corporations in some cases 
not paying a nickel in Federal income 
tax. 
What does this so-called competitive-
ness bill do? Instead of addressing any 
of these issues, this bill provides $53 
billion in corporate welfare to the 
microchip industry, with no protec-
tions for the American people, and a 
$10 billion bailout to Mr. Bezos. Now, 
that may make sense to Mr. Bezos, and 
it may make sense to other corporate 
leaders, but it does not make sense to 
me nor do I think it makes sense to the 
American people. 
In terms of the microchip industry, 
the American people should know the 
truth. We are talking about an indus-
try that has shut down over 780 manu-
facturing plants in the United States 
and eliminated 150,000 American jobs 
over the last 20 years as a result of 
moving 
their 
productions overseas. 
They have shut down plants in Amer-
ica and moved them overseas for cheap 
labor. 
In other words, in order to make 
more profits, these companies closed 
plants in America and hired people— 
sometimes 
at 
starvation 
wages—in 
other countries, and now, believe it or 
not, these very same people, these very 
same companies, are in line to receive 
$53 billion in corporate welfare to lit-
erally undo the damage that they 
caused. 
Now, some of my colleagues make 
the point that the microchip industry 
is enormously important for our econ-
omy and that we must become less de-
pendent 
on 
foreign 
nations 
for 
microchips. I agree. There is no argu-
ment about that. But we can and must 
accomplish that goal of breaking our 
dependence on foreign countries for 
microchips without simply throwing 
money at these huge corporations 
while the taxpayer gets nothing in re-
turn. 
I suspect five major semiconductor 
companies will likely receive the lion’s 
share of this taxpayer handout. They 
are Intel, Texas Instruments, Micron 
Technology, 
GlobalFoundries, 
and 
Samsung. These five companies that 
are in line for a $53 billion bailout 
made over $75 billion in profits last 
year. 
The company that will likely benefit 
the most from this taxpayer assistance 
is Intel. I have nothing against Intel. I 
wish them the very best, but let us be 
clear: Intel is not a poor company. 
Intel is not going broke—far from it. In 
2021, Intel made nearly $20 billion in 
profits. We are talking about a com-
pany that had enough money to spend 
over $14 billion during the pandemic 
not on research and development but 
on buying back its own stock to reward 
its 
executives 
and 
wealthy 
share-
holders. We are talking about a com-
pany that could afford to give its CEO, 
Mr. Pat Gelsinger, a $116 million com-
pensation package last year. We are 
talking about a company that could af-
ford to spend over $100 million on lob-
bying and campaign contributions over 
the past 20 years. Does it sound like 
this company, as well as the others, 
really needs corporate welfare? I don’t 
think so. 
Another company that would receive 
taxpayer assistance under this legisla-
tion is Texas Instruments. Last year, 
Texas Instruments made $7.8 billion in 
profits. In 2020, this company spent $2.5 
billion in buying back its own stock 
while it has outsourced thousands of 
good-paying American jobs to low-wage 
countries and spent more than $40 mil-
lion on lobbying over the past 20 years. 
That is Texas Instruments. 
And on and on it goes. 
So the first amendment that I would 
like a vote on and expect a vote on 
would instruct the conference com-
mittee to prevent microchip companies 
from receiving taxpayer assistance un-
less they agree to issue warrants or eq-
uity stakes to the Federal Govern-
ment. If private companies are going to 
benefit from over $53 billion in tax-
payer grants, the financial gains made 
by these companies must be shared 
with the American people, not just 
wealthy shareholders. 
In other words, all this amendment 
says is that, if these investments turn 
out to be profitable as a direct result of 
these Federal grants, the taxpayers of 
this country have a right to get a re-
turn on that investment. 
This is by no means a radical idea. 
These exact conditions were imposed 
on corporations that received taxpayer 
assistance in the bipartisan CARES 
Act, which, as you will recall, passed 
the Senate 96 to 0. In other words, 
every Member of the U.S. Senate has 
already voted for the conditions that 
are in this amendment. 
In addition, this amendment would 
instruct the conference committee to 
require these highly profitable compa-
nies not to buy back their own stock, 
not to outsource American jobs, not to 
repeal 
collective 
bargaining 
agree-
ments, and to remain neutral in any 
union-organizing efforts. 
Again, this is not a radical idea. All 
of these conditions were imposed on 
companies that received funding from 
the CARES Act, and that passed the 
Senate by a vote of 96 to 0. 
The second motion that I have intro-
duced touches on an issue that we have 
very, very rarely discussed on the floor 
of the Senate. Unbelievably, the so- 
called competition bill would provide 
some $10 billion in taxpayer money to 
Jeff Bezos, the second wealthiest per-
son in America, for his space race with 
Elon Musk, the wealthiest person in 
America. So we are looking at a space 
race between the two wealthiest guys 
in America. 
You know, when I was a young man 
a few years ago and Neil Armstrong 
went to the Moon, I recall like yester-
day the kind of incredible joy and pride 
in this country because the United 
States of America did something that 
people never ever thought would be 
possible. Who would have dreamed of 
sending a man to the Moon? Extraor-
dinary. The entire world, not only peo-
ple in America, watched that event 
with bated breath. All over the world, 
TV sets were on on every continent on 
Earth. It was just an extraordinary ac-
complishment for all of humanity. 
That is what Neil Armstrong said when 
he stepped onto the Moon—that it was 
not just for the United States—but we, 
of course, our Nation, took special 
pride because that was an American 
project. 
I worry very much that what we are 
seeing now is not a space race between 
the United States and other countries 
as to which nation will return to the 
Moon or perhaps get to Mars but, rath-
er, a space race between Mr. Musk and 
Mr. Bezos—the two wealthiest people 
in America—as to who will gain con-
trol over NASA and future space explo-
rations. 
In other words, if we are able to ac-
complish the unbelievable, extraor-
dinary goal of sending a person to 
Mars, I want the flag that will be fly-
ing on that planet to be the flag of the 
United States of America, not the flag 
of SpaceX or Blue Origin. 
Let us be clear: The $10 billion in this 
bill for Jeff Bezos and his space com-
pany, Blue Origin, is just the tip of the 
iceberg. The reality is that the space 
economy, which today mostly consists 
of private companies using NASA fa-
cilities free of charge to launch sat-
ellites into space, is already very prof-
itable and could become and will likely 
become even more so in the future. 
Bank of America predicts that by 
2030, the space economy will triple in 
size to $1.4 trillion. That is ‘‘trillion’’ 
with a t. 
According to the most recent data, 
private corporations made over $94 bil-
lion in profits a year for goods or serv-
ices that are used in space—profits

S2033 
April 6, 2022 
that could not have been achieved 
without the assistance of NASA, a gov-
ernment Agency funded by the tax-
payers of America. 
And while we are talking about the 
profitability of satellites today—and 
that is already a very profitable indus-
try—sometime in the future—not next 
year, not 10 years from now, but some-
time in the future—the real money 
may come to those who not only pro-
vide satellites but those who figure out 
how to mine lucrative minerals or as-
teroids. Does this sound like science 
fiction? It is not. This is exactly what 
is being worked on right now, mining 
lucrative minerals on asteroids. 
In 2015, the famous astrophysicist, 
Neil deGrasse Tyson, predicted: 
The first trillionaire there will ever be is 
the person who exploits the natural re-
sources on asteroids . . . . There’s this vast 
universe of limitless energy and limitless re-
sources. I look at wars fought over access to 
resources. That could be a thing of the past, 
once space becomes our backyard. 
End of quote, Mr. deGrasse Tyson. 
Who gets to own the resources dis-
covered by private corporations in 
space? 
Well, as a result of a little-known 
2015 SPACE Act that passed the Senate 
by unanimous consent with virtually 
no floor debate, private corporations 
are able to own all of these resources. 
In other words, the taxpayers of this 
country will get a zero-percent return 
on the investment they made in these 
private enterprises, which could turn 
out to be unbelievably lucrative. 
Is that what we want space explo-
ration to become? Do we really think 
that it is acceptable for NASA to hand 
out billions of dollars to some of the 
wealthiest 
billionaires 
in 
America 
today to make them even wealthier? Or 
do we want to use space exploration to 
benefit all of the American people and 
improve life here on the planet for ev-
eryone? 
It is time that we had a serious de-
bate on the future of NASA, instead of 
just handing out $10 billion to Mr. 
Bezos. 
Let me conclude by saying that I 
happen to believe and support space ex-
ploration. I think the benefits could be 
extraordinary for the American people 
and for people all over the world. But if 
we 
continue 
down 
the 
path 
of 
privatizing space exploration, it also 
has the potential to make the ob-
scenely rich even richer and more pow-
erful than anyone can possibly imagine 
today. In my view, we cannot and must 
not allow that to happen. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise 
tonight 
to 
support 
Ketanji 
Brown 
Jackson’s nomination to serve as an 
Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
Judge Jackson comes to this floor 
with impeccable credentials. She grad-
uated from Harvard magna cum laude. 
She graduated with honors from Har-
vard Law School, where she edited the 
Harvard Law Review. 
After 
graduation, 
Judge 
Jackson 
worked at top firms in private practice 
and secured three prestigious clerk-
ships, including one for Justice Breyer 
on the Supreme Court of the United 
States. Later, she served as a public de-
fender, 
representing 
people 
who 
couldn’t afford a lawyer. 
I can’t think of better evidence of her 
commitment to equal justice under the 
law, where everyone, regardless of 
their means, has the right to fair rep-
resentation. 
Judge Jackson is clearly qualified for 
this position. There is nobody who 
doubts that. My colleagues know it be-
cause the Senate has confirmed her 
three times with bipartisan support: 
first, to serve as Vice Chair of the U.S. 
Sentencing Commission; second, for 
the U.S. District Court for the District 
of Columbia; and, last, for the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. 
Taken 
together, 
Judge 
Jackson 
comes to this floor with the best legal 
training America can offer: a decade of 
experience on the Federal bench and a 
consistent record of bipartisan support 
here on this floor. 
I had the opportunity to meet with 
Judge Jackson 2 weeks ago, after she 
had been rolled around in the barrel— 
that is one way of saying it—during the 
confirmation hearings that people all 
over the country watched. And in our 
conversation, 
after 
she 
had 
been 
through all of that turmoil, she told 
me about how her parents had attended 
segregated schools in Miami before 
working as public school teachers here 
in Washington, DC. Her dad went on to 
be a lawyer, a lawyer for the Miami 
school district, something I appreciate, 
having 
been 
a 
superintendent 
of 
schools. 
Unlike her parents, Judge Jackson 
grew up in America after the civil 
rights laws of the 1960s and remem-
bered how hard her parents worked 
every single day to give her opportuni-
ties they never even dreamed of for 
themselves. And she seized those op-
portunities. She earned top grade. She 
was elected student body president. 
And when she told her guidance 
counselor she wanted to apply to Har-
vard, 
the 
counselor 
warned 
she 
shouldn’t set her ‘‘sights so high.’’ For-
tunately for America, she set her 
sights high. She set her sights where 
they should have been set. She followed 
the high example of her parents, work-
ing hard and impressing everyone 
along the way, friends and colleagues 
and mentors, who are virtually beating 
down the doors of this Capitol to tell 
us what a thoughtful, fairminded, and 
principled Justice she would be. 
That hasn’t stopped some colleagues 
from distorting her record, trying to 
say to the American people that she is 
soft on crime. That would come as 
news, I think, to the Fraternal Order of 
Police, who has endorsed her candidacy 
for the Court. It would come as news to 
the International Association of Chiefs 
of Police. Both have endorsed her nom-
ination. They see what is obvious to 
anyone who fairly reviews her record, 
which is that Judge Jackson has spent 
her entire career devoted to the rule of 
law. 
Her brother and two uncles served as 
police officers. So law enforcement 
isn’t some academic abstraction for 
her. It is literally her family. 
The Presiding Officer knows some-
thing about that, I think, in his family 
history as well. 
In our meeting, I asked Judge Jack-
son what makes a good judge. We had 
a long talk about that. One of the 
things she said was communication, be-
cause judges have to explain their rea-
soning in every decision, which is a lot 
more than I can say for the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
She also said that it is the unique 
role of the judge to identify and to ex-
tract their bias before every case. And 
if you look at her more than 570 writ-
ten decisions, it is clear how seriously 
she takes that responsibility. 
I was just on the phone with some 
people from Colorado before I came 
over here. And I said to them—I told 
them I was coming out here to give 
this speech. And I said to them—these 
are old, old friends of mine—that I 
can’t remember a time when I sat down 
with somebody and had a 30-minute 
conversation where I came away more 
impressed than I was by Judge Jack-
son. 
I found her to be both brilliant and 
completely down-to-earth, which is, I 
think, a particularly important com-
bination for a judge at any level—at 
any level—to have both the intellect to 
grapple with the nuances of the law 
and the experience to appreciate how it 
affects real people. 
It wasn’t that long ago that Judge 
Jackson would have received over 90 
votes on this floor, just like her men-
tor, Justice Breyer, did; just like quali-
fied judges when I was in law school 
myself. The Senate confirmed Justice 
Breyer 96 to 3, just like we confirmed 
Justice Scalia 98 to 0, and Justice San-
dra Day O’Connor got 91 to nothing. 
Somebody was out that day. I guar-
antee you they would have voted for 
her if they had been here. 
Each time that happened, the Senate 
reinforced the independence of the ju-
diciary, set aside our partisan politics, 
and stood up, I think, for integrity and 
for the rule of law. 
I am sad. I am sad tonight that Judge 
Jackson won’t get 99 votes tomorrow, 
even though she deserves it. And that 
is not a reflection on her. As I said, if 
this were an earlier day in the Senate, 
she would get 99 votes. She would have 
gotten 99 votes if she had come in a dif-
ferent era. It is a reflection of how we, 
as Senators—and I among them—have 
shredded our constitutional responsi-
bility to advise and consent. 
It is my hope that by the time—I was 
going to say, when my children are 
adults; they almost are adults; they

are adults—but by the time they are 
running the country, with everybody 
else in their generation, that we will 
have figured out a way to return the 
Senate to a place where we take our re-
sponsibility—our 
constitutional 
re-
sponsibility—to advise and consent se-
riously, and we find a way to make it, 
once again, a bipartisan effort in this 
place, and find a way to stitch our-
selves back together again. I am pre-
pared to work with anybody on the 
floor to try to do that. But in the 
meantime, this really, in my view, is a 
moment to celebrate. It is a moment to 
celebrate. 
In the last few weeks, my office has 
literally been flooded with messages 
from Coloradans telling me what an ex-
traordinary 
Justice 
Judge 
Jackson 
would make. And they don’t have to 
persuade me. Judge Jackson is an in-
spiration to me and to so many Ameri-
cans, to millions and millions of Amer-
icans. 
In the past few weeks, I couldn’t help 
but imagine what it would mean to the 
students I used to work for in the Den-
ver Public Schools to see Judge Jack-
son on the Court, the same Court that 
once ruled in Dred Scott v. Sandford 
that her ancestors were little more 
than property, a Court that codified in 
Plessy v. Ferguson the segregated 
schools that her parents were forced to 
attend and the segregated hotels and 
buses and movie theaters they endured 
every single day, day after day. 
And it is a reminder that change is 
possible in America. Our country isn’t 
perfect—far from it. Our history has al-
ways been a battle between the highest 
ideals expressed in our Constitution 
and our worst impulses as human 
beings. 
And if you look at our history, if you 
really look at our history, the path 
from cases like Dred Scott and Plessy 
to Brown and Obergefell was cleared, as 
it always is, by Americans who refused 
to give up on our highest ideals; who 
insisted, as Dr. King once said, that we 
make real the promise of our democ-
racy. 
This week is a victory for our highest 
ideals and for the promise of American 
democracy. It is a moment to celebrate 
a nation that, as Judge Jackson said, 
in one generation went from forcing 
her parents to live under Jim Crow to 
elevating her to the highest Court in 
the land. 
After carefully reviewing her record, 
I believe that Judge Jackson will join 
the ranks of Earl Warren, Thurgood 
Marshall, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 
Justices who have helped bridge the 
gap between the words written in our 
Constitution and their reality in Amer-
ica today, and I hope she will join the 
Court’s great dissenters, Justices like 
Justice Harlan, who opposed decisions 
that outlawed the minimum wage, or 
Justices Roberts and Murphy, who re-
fused to condone the internment of 
Japanese Americans in Colorado and 
across the country. All of those Jus-
tices stood not for an ideology but for 
the American values etched in our Con-
stitution: freedom, equality, democ-
racy, and the rule of law. 
I am confident that Judge Jackson 
will stand for those values fairly, im-
partially, and without prejudice; and 
tomorrow I will enthusiastically vote 
for her confirmation. I would suggest 
that everybody in this Chamber would 
have a good reason to vote for her con-
firmation, and I hope they will con-
sider it. 
I yield the floor.

made and laid upon the table; that any 
statements related to the nominations 
be printed in the RECORD; that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action; and that the Sen-
ate resume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the nominations of 
Glen S. Fukushima, of California, to be

TRIBUTE TO BETTY REID SOSKIN 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, as the chair 
of the Senate National Parks Sub-
committee and on behalf of Senator 
DAINES, the Ranking Member of the 
Senate National Parks Subcommittee, 
today, I wish to recognize Betty Reid 
Soskin, who recently retired as the Na-
tional Park Service’s oldest active 
ranger. Betty spent a decade and a half 
sharing her personal experiences as a 
ranger at the Rosie the Riveter/WWII 
Home Front National Park in Rich-
mond, CA. I want to thank Betty for 
her service and wish her well in her 
much-deserved retirement. 
Betty had a long path before landing 
at the National Park Service. She grew 
up in a Cajun-Creole, African-American 
family in Oakland, CA. Her family was 
forced to leave their home in New Orle-
ans after the ‘‘Great Flood’’ in 1927, 
and they moved to Oakland to join Bet-
ty’s maternal grandfather. After grad-
uating from Castlemont High School, 
Betty went to work as a file clerk in a 
segregated union hall, Boilermaker’s 
A–36, during World War II. Later, she 
and her husband, Mel Reid, opened 
Reid’s Records, one of the first Black- 
owned music stores; the store remained 
open until fall of 2019. Betty also 
worked for a Berkley city council 
member and as a field representative in 
West Contra Costa County for two 
members of the California State As-
sembly. 
In the early 2000s, Betty was involved 
in the planning meetings with the city 
of Richmond and the National Park 
Service to develop the management 
plan for the Rosie the Riveter/WWII 
Home Front National Historic Park. 
She also worked with the National 
Park Service on a grant to cover un-
told stories of African-Americans on

the home front during WWII, which led 
to a temporary position working for 
the National Park Service at the age of 
84. Betty became a permanent National 
Park Service employee in 2011 and has 
been leading public programs and shar-
ing her personal stories and observa-
tions with park visitors ever since. 
Betty gained national fame in 2013, 
during the government shutdown, when 
media outlets wanted to interview her 
as the oldest National Park Service 
ranger, to get her take on the shut-
down. Betty participated in numerous 
national television interviews but man-
aged to stay out of the political fray, 
saying that she wanted to focus what 
little time she had left on getting back 
to work, sharing her stories of the 
WWII home front. In 2015, Betty was se-
lected by the National Park Service to 
participate in the national tree-light-
ing ceremony at the White House and 
introduced President Barack Obama in 
the national telecast on the annual 
PBS special. In fall 2019, Betty suffered 
a stroke and spent months in therapy, 
returning to work just before the 
COVID–19 pandemic struck. Prior to 
her retirement, Betty started doing 
weekly virtual visits to continue to 
share her perspectives with visitors. 
Like many park rangers, Betty’s 
path to the National Park Service may 
not have been the most direct, but we 
have all benefited from her decision to 
dedicate herself to public service. Her 
firsthand experiences on the home 
front during WWII help provide critical 
lessons for all Americans, regardless of 
their age, and we are so thankful that 
Betty chose to spend so many years of 
her life sharing her experiences with us 
all. We will certainly miss her insights 
and passion, but she has earned this re-
tirement. On behalf of myself and Sen-
ator DAINES, I extend our best wishes 
to Betty and thank her again her serv-
ice.

TRIBUTE TO KAY GUINANE 
∑ Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise as 
chairman of the Banking, Housing and 
Urban Affairs Committee to honor and 
recognize the contributions of Kay 
Guinane upon her retirement from the 
Charity and Security Network. 
In 2009, Ms. Guinane founded the 
Charity and Security Network—C and 
SN—a resource and advocacy center for 
nonprofit organizations to promote and 
protect their ability to carry out effec-
tive programs that support peace and 
human rights, aid civilians in areas of 
disaster and armed conflict, and build 
democratic governance. 
Kay formed C and SN after observing 
significant obstacles in achieving crit-
ical humanitarian, peacebuilding and 
human rights programs. She recognized 
laws that restricted interactions with 
and financial support for designated 
groups and individuals were also se-
verely limiting the critical work of 
civil society programs that provided 
assistance to the most vulnerable pop-
ulations around the world. C and SN 
blazed a trail in being one of the first 
nonprofit 
organizations 
to 
address 
these issues. 
Early on, in concert with colleagues 
around the world who had experienced 
similar impediments, Kay began engag-
ing with elected officials and adminis-
tration policymakers, seeking solu-
tions, including the committees in 
Congress responsible for illicit finance 
and sanctions policy. Kay and her orga-
nization were a critical resource for 
the Senate Banking Committee for 
years as we addressed important policy 
issues, and unintended consequences of 
certain policies around illicit financ-
ing, bank de-risking, the conveyance of 
remittances overseas from families in 
the US—including large communities 
of Somalis, Ethiopians, and people 
from across Latin America—and other 
issues. 
In May 2010, Kay testified in the first 
congressional oversight hearing since 
September 11, 2001, to look at the im-
pact of anti-terrorist financing en-
forcement policies on the U.S. chari-
table sector. The hearing entitled, 
‘‘Anti-Money 
Laundering: 
Blocking 
Terrorist Financing and Its Impact on 
Lawful Charities,’’ was held by the 
House 
Financial 
Services 
sub-
committee on Oversight and Investiga-
tions. During the hearing, a Treasury 
official acknowledged that the laws 
aimed at stopping terrorist financing 
could have the unintended consequence 
of harming the effectiveness of certain 
charitable programs. Kay outlined spe-
cific problems faced by the U.S. non-
profit sector, including the issue of 
banks freezing accounts indefinitely, 
and noted the negative impact of U.S. 
Treasury enforcement actions on le-
gitimate charitable organizations oper-
ating solely to assist vulnerable popu-
lations. 
Over the next decade, Kay and the 
work of C and SN were a driving force 
in efforts to address challenges civil so-
ciety groups had in implementing their 
essential lifesaving, peacebuilding and 
human rights work. Kay’s vision and 
efforts built an impressive network of 
nearly 200 organizations internation-
ally with a shared goal of assisting the 
most vulnerable and protecting funda-
mental civil liberties. These organiza-
tions addressed issues surrounding civil 
societal concerns and financial access 
restrictions for nonprofits to com-
bating obstacles in reaching general 
populations due to specific sanctioned 
entities. 
By drawing on legal expertise, first-
hand experiences of those working with 
these limitations, and policy analysis, 
the work of C and SN has helped raise 
awareness of and craft solutions for 
civil society and human rights con-
cerns around the world. It has also re-
sulted in tangible improvements in 
regulations, international guidelines, 
and policies. One notable and tangible

legislative victory was in key provi-
sions of the Anti-Money Laundering 
Act of 2020, which assisted to improve 
financial access for charities. 
While her steadfast work will be 
missed, Kay’s legacy at C and SN and 
its network of affiliates will have an 
impact on global civil liberties and 
human rights issues going forward. I 
offer her my heartfelt congratulations 
to her on her retirement, and wish 
her—and C and SN, which she leaves in

TRIBUTE TO CHIEF WARRANT 
OFFICER 5 DAVID HAMMON 
∑ Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to the re-
markable 
career 
of 
CW5 
David 
Hammon, a 42-year servicemember of 
the Illinois Army National Guard who 
will retire on April 30, 2022. Chief 
Hammon was the fifth command chief 
warrant officer of the State of Illinois 
and only the third full-time soldier to 
hold the position. 
Chief Hammon enlisted in the Army 
as an aircraft mechanic in 1980. He 
served with the 219th Transportation 
Company, 40th Aviation Battalion (At-
tack Helicopter), 1144th Transportation 
Battalion, and 1st Battalion, 106th 
Aviation Regiment. In 1996, he became 
an aviation warrant officer with the 
106th. He served in various units and 
positions, to include aviation inter-
mediate maintenance, light medium 
transportation, lift, and aviation unit 
maintenance. His latest assignment 
was as a maintenance test pilot for 
Company D, 1st Battalion, 106th Avia-
tion Regiment in Decatur, flying the 
UH–60 Blackhawk. Chief Hammon de-
ployed twice in support of Operation 
Iraqi Freedom/New Dawn. In 2004 to 
2005, he deployed with Headquarters, 
1st Battalion, 106th Aviation Regi-
ment, and in 2009 to 2010, he deployed 
with Company A, 1st Battalion, 106th 
Aviation Regiment. His overseas de-
ployment training missions include 
Germany, El Salvador, Panama, Ice-
land, and Hawaii. 
Chief Hammon’s military awards and 
decorations include Meritorious Serv-
ice Medal, Air Medal (Numeral 2), 
Army Commendation Medal (3 oakleaf 
clusters), 
National 
Defense 
Service 
Medal (1 Bronze Star), Iraq Campaign 
Medal (3 Bronze Service Stars), Global 
War on Terrorism Service Medal, Hu-
manitarian 
Service 
Medal, 
Armed 
Forces Reserve Medal (M 2 Device), 
Overseas Service Ribbon (Numeral 2), 
Army Reserve Component Overseas 
Training Ribbon (Numeral 7), Illinois 
State Active Duty (Numeral 2), Army 
Combat Action Badge, Master Army 
Aviator Badge, Army Excellence in 
Competition Badge Bronze Rifle, Driv-
er and Mechanic Badge. 
Chief Hammon’s leadership, deter-
mination, and commitment have no 
doubt changed lives and helped to 
make our country safer. As his Army 
career ends, may he continue to be 
‘‘Always Ready, Always There!’’ and 
forever take pride in knowing that his 
exemplary efforts and unwavering pro-
fessionalism contributed greatly to the 
success of the Army and the National 
Guard mission.∑

REMEMBERING COLONEL GAIL S. 
HALVORSEN 
∑ Mr. LEE. Mr. President, Col. Gail S. 
Halvorsen is known as the ‘‘Candy 
Bomber’’ 
because 
in 
1948, 
Colonel 
Halvorsen brought not only much need-
ed supplies to the besieged residents of 
Berlin, but he brought joy in the form 
of candy bars and bubble gum with 
miniature parachutes dropped from his 
airplane. This story of hope, light, and 
service is but a highlight in a life dedi-
cated to serving others. 
While Colonel Halvorsen passed away 
earlier this year at the notable age of 
101 years, the people of Utah hold him 
and his story close to our hearts. Re-
cently, my staff and I were honored to 
join the Gail S. Halvorsen Foundation 
and other groups in Utah to help facili-
tate the donation of six tons of school 
and baby supplies along with 9,000 let-
ters from Utah schoolchildren to refu-
gees fleeing Ukraine. While logistical 
challenges are characteristic of inter-
national donations of this type, the 
dedication of the Halvorsen Founda-
tion and all involved ensured these 
vital supplies made it safely to those 
within a critical timeline. 
In a time of violence and evil, when 
our friends are under attack, Gail 
Halvorsen is again leading the way for 
American generosity, kindness, and 
compassion. 
The 
parallels 
between 
these two tragic situations are moving. 
The men and women of America’s mili-
tary volunteered in aiding in delivering 
supplies 
to 
those 
in 
need. 
The 
Halvorsen family and foundation were 
involved intimately in the effort. Colo-
nel Halvorsen’s daughter brought along 
chocolate bars to induct the Navy pi-
lots as some of the next generation of 
‘‘candy bombers.’’ These supplies land-
ed at Tempelhof airbase where the leg-
end began. Now, as then, the people of 
the United States are showing char-
acteristic kindness. It is particularly 
moving to me that alongside the sup-
plies and necessities of life, this ship-
ment included touching letters from 
the 
schoolchildren 
of 
Utah. 
Gail 
Halvorsen is remembered not for his ef-
ficiency or logistics, but his kindness 
and gift for human connection. 
These diapers, packages of formula, 
and school supplies will be used by the 
most vulnerable of the Ukrainian refu-
gees. This gesture of kindness will lift 
up weary hands and encourage strug-
gling hearts of the mothers and fathers 
of these children. Importantly, at this 
moment of difficulty and despair, the 
Gail Halvorsen Foundation and the 
people of Utah are also remembering 
the people behind the tragedy and are 
remembering kindness, humanity, and 
an individual touch in the effort to re-
lieve suffering. 
The people of Utah are not unfa-
miliar with stories of displacement. 
Utah was settled by religious refugees 
seeking freedom from persecution and 
violence. Indeed, the history of the 
United States is broadly marked by 
groups fleeing violence, persecution, or 
turmoil in their homelands. The Amer-
ican empathy for refugees and desire to 
help those in desperate need is alive 
and well in the hearts and minds of 
Utahns. 
Col. Gail S. Halvorsen lived a life 
dedicated to service. His signature 
kindness shines brightly in telling his 
signature story. His glowing smile 
matched his glowing personality. In 
Utah, we miss the ‘‘Candy Bomber’’ 
and his personal touch. Neverthless, 
his mission and influence continues. 
The dedicated work of the Gail S. 
Halvorsen Foundation is changing lives 
today. Be it caring for refugees, inspir-
ing kindness, or building future genera-
tions of STEM professionals, the Gail 
S. Halvorsen Foundation continues the 
legacy of one of Utah’s greatest citi-
zens. Col. Gail S. Halvorsen’s story, his 
legacy, and his influence carry on 
bringing smiles and relief all along the 
way.∑

TRIBUTE TO DAVID MICHAEL 
THOMAS 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, while it is 
not possible to specifically recognize 
every Vietnam veteran who honorably 
served our Nation, each time we cele-
brate one, we also focus our attention 
on thousands of others, many of whom 
lost their lives decades ago. 
Today, I want to honor David Mi-
chael Thomas, who followed in the 
footsteps of his own father, Glenn 
Elmore Thomas, a personal bodyguard 
for Dwight D. Eisenhower, and joined 
the U.S. Army in 1970. Specialist 
Thomas was stationed outside the Tan 
Son Nhut Air Field with the 519th Mili-
tary Intelligence Battalion, 525th Mili-
tary Intelligence Group for 2 years. He 
received the National Defense Service 
Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal 
with 2 Stars, Vietnam Campaign Medal 
with 60 Device, Meritorious Unit Cita-
tion, and the Army Commendation 
Medal. 
Upon his return from Vietnam, he 
graduated from Western Kentucky Uni-
versity in my hometown of Bowling 
Green and, most notably, met his fu-
ture wife, Julia Kirk at the Baptist 
Student Union. Together, they em-
barked on his 40 years of pastoral min-
istry in seven different States, finally 
retiring back in our community. He 
and Julia are blessed with four children 
and a host of grandchildren and great- 
grandchildren. 
His legacy of serving others, first in 
the Armed Services and then in pas-
toral ministry, continues in a unique 
way with which I have a personal con-
nection. His daughter, Amy Bee, is a 
constituent service representative in 
my office in Bowling Green. She is one 
of the many talented staff members

RECOGNIZING MALVAGIO’S 
RESTAURANT 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month I recognize 
and celebrate the American entrepre-
neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-
cess of a small business in my home 
State of Idaho. Today, I am pleased to 
honor Malvagio’s Restaurant as the 
Idaho Small Business of the Month for 
April 2022. 
Malvagio’s Restaurant brings a taste 
of Italy to Coeur d’Alene with their 
sampling of hand-crafted wood-fired 
pizzas, pastas, salads, and breads. With 
a dream of bringing their community 
together with food and a passion for 
the tradition of wood-fired cooking, 
owners Svitlana and Matthew Petersen 
dedicated a year to perfecting the craft 
and designing an innovative, mobile 
wood-fired oven. Using this unique 
oven as the cornerstone of their res-
taurant, the couple founded Malvagio’s 
in 2016. 
In the 5 years since Malvagio’s first 
opened its doors, the restaurant has be-
come a mainstay of the Coeur d’Alene 
community. While they have brought 
smiles to countless faces in their mom- 
and-pop restaurant, the Petersen’s mo-
bile wood-fired oven has allowed the 
business 
to 
branch 
into 
catering. 
Today, Malvagio’s pizzas are a common 
sight at weddings, parties, and other 
celebrations across northern Idaho. 
Thanks to this growth, the restaurant 
now employs eight Idahoans and is the 
official dealer of Forno Bravo wood- 
fired ovens in Idaho. 
Malvagio’s success is matched only 
by the Petersen’s dedication to giving 
back. As the world watched Russia’s 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine, 
Svitlana—a 
Ukrainian native—and Matthew began 
serving an authentic Ukrainian dish at 
Malvagio’s. During the week of March 
2, 2022, all proceeds from each purchase 
of a cup of borscht, a Ukrainian 
beetroot soup, were donated to Ukrain-
ian humanitarian needs. By virtue of 
these efforts, Malvagio’s has raised 
thousands of dollars in support of 
Ukraine and has become a champion of 
Idahoan entrepreneurship and philan-
thropy. 
Congratulations to Svitlana, Mat-
thew, and all of the employees at 
Malvagio’s Restaurant for being se-
lected as the Idaho Small Business of 
the Month for April 2022. You make our 
great State proud, and I look forward 
to your continued growth and success.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. REED: 
S. 4019. A bill to protect airline crew 
members, security screening personnel, 
and passengers by banning abusive pas-
sengers 
from 
commercial 
aircraft 
flights, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
introducing the Protection from Abu-
sive Passengers Act, a bill that is 
aimed at eliminating the rash of vio-
lence and abuse that is occurring on 
commercial flights across the country. 
I am pleased to be joined in this effort 
by Representative ERIC SWALWELL of 
California, who is introducing com-
panion legislation in the other body. 
The goal of our bill is to send a clear 
signal that individuals who engage in 
serious abusive or violent behavior on 
an aircraft or at an airport security 
checkpoint will be banned from flying. 
Since 2020, we have seen an extraor-
dinary increase in the number of cases 
of violence and abuse against crew-
members and airline passengers. In 
2021, the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion received 5,981 reports of ‘‘unruly 
passengers.’’ Those complaints led to 
1,124 investigations, nearly the same 
number of investigations as the pre-
vious 10 years combined. From those 
investigations, the Federal Aviation 
Administration, FAA, has initiated 350 
enforcement actions and proposed $5 
million in fines. In February, it was 
widely reported that the FAA had re-
ferred 80 cases to the FBI for criminal 
investigation. Clearly, these are not 
minor infractions. Here some recent 
examples: 
In December 2021, the FAA proposed 
a record $52,500 fine against a passenger 
who tried to open the cockpit door on 
a Delta flight from Honolulu to Se-
attle, struck a flight attendant twice, 
and threatened him. 
The FAA also proposed a $45,000 fine 
against a passenger ‘‘for throwing ob-
jects, including his carry-on luggage, 
at other passengers; refusing to stay 
seated; lying on the floor in the aisle, 
refusing to get up, and then grabbing a 
flight attendant by the ankles and put-
ting his head up her skirt.’’ 
It proposed a $30,000 fine against a 
passenger on a Jan. 3, 2021, flight from 
Atlanta for ‘‘allegedly interfering with 
the flight attendants’ deplaning proce-
dures upon arrival. He attempted to 
gain entry to the flight deck by phys-
ically assaulting two flight attendants, 
threatening to kill one of them, and de-
manding them to open the door.’’ 
Last 
December, 
a 
passenger 
on 
Southwest Airlines pleaded guilty to 
punching a flight attendant in the face 
multiple times in a May 2021 incident 
in Sacramento. According to prosecu-
tors, the flight attendant was taken to 
a hospital with injuries that included a 
swollen eye, a bruised arm, and a cut 
under her eye that had to be stitched. 
She also had three chipped teeth, two 
of which: had to be replaced with 
crowns. 
Such actions in any setting would be 
deplorable and reprehensible, but on an 
airplane, such behavior can also rep-
resent a real threat to all passengers. 
Clearly, the existing regime of civil 
and criminal penalties has not been 
enough to deter the upsurge in cases. 
We need to send a signal that such 
types of behavior will not be tolerated. 
The Protection from Abusive Pas-
sengers Act would require the Trans-
portation 
Security 
Administration, 
TSA, to create and manage a program 
which bars passengers who are fined or 
convicted of serious physical violence 
and abuse from flying. Transparency 
and notice will be provided to banned 
individuals, including guidelines for re-
moval. The bill would also perma-
nently ban abusive passengers from 
participating in the TSA PreCheck or 
Customs’ Global Entry programs. 
The bill provides appropriate fairness 
and due process by ensuring that only

April 6, 2022 
individuals who have been assessed a 
civil or criminal penalty for abusive 
and violent behavior will be included 
on the list of banned fliers. The bill 
also requires the TSA to explain how it 
will maintain its list of banned fliers, 
provide an explanation of how long the 
individual may be barred from flying 
based on the severity of the offense, 
and provide how the individual can 
seek to be removed from the list of 
banned fliers. 
I believe this bill strikes the appro-
priate balance to assure fairness and 
transparency while sending a strong 
signal that violent and abusive behav-
ior will not be tolerated. I am pleased 
that the bill is supported by both labor 
and the airlines, including American 
Airlines, Delta Airlines, Southwest 
Airlines, the Association of Flight At-
tendants-CWA, the Association of Pro-
fessional Flight Attendants, Transport 
Workers Union of America, and the 
Transportation Trades Department of 
the AFL–CIO. I hope that my col-
leagues will join me in supporting this 
important bill.

son’s disease in the United States will nearly 
double, and the disease will cost the United 
States at least $79,000,000,000 annually; 
Whereas the symptoms of Parkinson’s dis-
ease can include dementia and cognitive im-
pairment, tremors, slowness of movement, 
‘‘freezing’’ in place, inability to walk and 
maintain balance, speech difficulties, depres-
sion, losing the ability to swallow, and a va-
riety of other symptoms; 
Whereas there are millions of family care-
givers, friends, and loved ones whose lives 
are greatly affected by Parkinson’s disease; 
and 
Whereas more research, education, and 
community support services are needed to— 
(1) find better treatments and a cure for 
Parkinson’s disease; and 
(2) maintain dignity for those living with 
the disease today: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates April 2022 as ‘‘Parkinson’s 
Awareness Month’’; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Parkin-
son’s Awareness Month; 
(3) continues to support research to find 
better treatments and a cure for Parkinson’s 
disease; 
(4) recognizes the individuals living with 
Parkinson’s disease who participate in vital 
clinical trials to advance the knowledge of 
the disease; and 
(5) commends the dedication of organiza-
tions, volunteers, researchers, and millions 
of individuals across the country working to 
improve the quality of life of people living 
with Parkinson’s disease and their families.

NIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF BIG BERTHA, ONE OF THE 
LARGEST BASS DRUMS IN USE 
BY 
A 
UNIVERSITY 
IN 
THE 
UNITED STATES AND LOCATED 
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS 
AT AUSTIN 
Mr. CRUZ submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 579 
Whereas Big Bertha, one of the largest bass 
drums in use by a university in the United 
States, is known as the ‘‘Sweetheart of the 
Longhorn Band’’ and an icon of The Univer-
sity of Texas at Austin; 
Whereas Big Bertha is so large that, fol-
lowing her construction, part of the walls of 
the factory where she was assembled had to 
be removed so Big Bertha could leave the 
factory for shipping; 
Whereas the year 2022 marks the 100th an-
niversary since Big Bertha was first put into 
service on October 28, 1922, in support of the 
football team for the University of Chicago, 
which was led by Coach Amos Alonzo Stagg 
and his assistant Fritz Crisler, both of whom 
would go on to be inducted into the College 
Football Hall of Fame; 
Whereas, in 1938, Big Bertha made a special 
trip to Carnegie Hall in New York City to 
join an orchestra directed by famed Italian 
conductor Arturo Toscanini for a perform-
ance of Verdi’s Requiem, where Big Bertha 
was the star of the show, used to play a sin-
gle note; 
Whereas Big Bertha was a witness to his-
tory, having been present at the dawn of the 
Atomic Age, when, at approximately 3:25 PM 
on December 2, 1942, Enrico Fermi and his 
colleagues at the Metallurgical Laboratory 
at the University of Chicago engineered the 
first 
controlled, 
self-sustaining 
nuclear 
chain reaction as part of their work in sup-
port of the Manhattan Project; 
Whereas the nuclear chain reaction oc-
curred on a squash court under the west 
stands of the former Stagg Field on the Uni-
versity of Chicago campus adjacent to where 
Big Bertha was in storage, resulting in Big 
Bertha becoming radioactive; 
Whereas The University of Texas at Austin 
purchased Big Bertha from the University of 
Chicago in 1955, at which time Big Bertha 
moved to Texas, making her new home in 
Austin; 
Whereas Big Bertha now resides in the 
north end zone concourse of Darrell K. 
Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, where she 
has been admired by Longhorn football fans 
for generations; 
Whereas, due to her important role sup-
porting The University of Texas at Austin 
Longhorns football team (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘Texas Longhorns’’), Big 
Bertha has an endowment to provide for her 
care; 
Whereas, since moving to Austin, Big Ber-
tha has been a witness to football history on 
multiple occasions, including witnessing the 
Texas Longhorns win national champion-
ships in 1963 and 2005, back-to-back national

championships in 1969 and 1970, 19 conference 
championships, 8 Cotton Bowl Champion-
ships, and many other prominent bowl 
games; 
Whereas Big Bertha supported the Texas 
Longhorns during each of Hall of Fame 
Coach Darrell K. Royal’s 20 years coaching 
the Texas Longhorns to a record that in-
cluded 167 wins, 47 losses, and 5 ties; 
Whereas Big Bertha boomed in support of 
the winning Heisman Trophy campaigns of 
Texas Longhorns greats Earl Campbell in 
1977 and Ricky Williams in 1998; 
Whereas Big Bertha’s name was given to 
her on the 50th anniversary of her move to 
Austin; 
Whereas Big Bertha is a television celeb-
rity, having been the focus of a 2015 episode 
of the Arts and Entertainment Network tele-
vision show ‘‘Shipping Wars’’ in which Big 
Bertha was shipped to London, England, to 
participate in a New Year’s Day parade; 
Whereas photogrammetry is the science 
and technology used to obtain reliable infor-
mation about the size and dimensions of 
physical objects; 
Whereas photogrammetry has been used to 
measure and compare the size of Big Bertha 
with other large university bass drums and 
has scientifically proven that Big Bertha is, 
in fact, larger than other drums that have 
been claimed to be the ‘‘world’s largest’’; 
Whereas Big Bertha and her handlers, the 
‘‘Bertha Crew’’, are an essential part of 
United States history and The University of 
Texas Longhorn Band; and 
Whereas Big Bertha has been part of many 
historic performances across Texas, the 
United States, and the world: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate recognizes— 
(1) the 100th anniversary of the construc-
tion of Big Bertha, one of the largest bass 
drums in use by a university in the United 
States; 
(2) The University of Texas Longhorn Band 
as an important cultural and historical icon 
of The University of Texas at Austin and the 
State of Texas; 
(3) Big Bertha for her preeminence in band 
and musical performances, including on the 
national stage as the star of the show at an 
historic performance at Carnegie Hall in 1938 
and the international stage as part of a New 
Year’s Day parade in London, England, in 
2015; 
(4) the Bertha Crew and The University of 
Texas Longhorn Band for their continued 
legacy of excellence in musical performance 
and in support of school spirit; and 
(5) that the ongoing debate between uni-
versities in the United States regarding 
which institution possesses the largest bass 
drum is reflective of the spirit of competi-
tion that has helped the United States reach 
new heights in academic and scientific 
achievement and ingenuity for more than a 
century.

NIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE CREATION OF THE PUR-
DUE 
‘‘ALL-AMERICAN’’ 
MARCH-
ING BAND’S WORLD’S LARGEST 
DRUM 
Mr. BRAUN (for himself and Mr. 
YOUNG) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 580 
Whereas the World’s Largest Drum is a sig-
nificant piece of the ‘‘All-American’’ March-
ing Band and an icon of Purdue University; 
Whereas, in 1921, ‘‘All-American’’ Marching 
Band Director Paul Spotts Emrick commis-
sioned the World’s Largest Drum from the 
Leedy Corporation of Indianapolis; 
Whereas, in 1921, the World’s Largest Drum 
was the largest drum in existence and was 
displayed at the Indiana Statehouse and In-
diana State Fair; 
Whereas it is a Purdue ‘‘All-American’’ 
Marching Band tradition to honor national 
leaders and heroes with the privilege to beat 
the World’s Largest Drum, with President 
Harry Truman, Gus Grissom, and Neil Arm-
strong being among those accepting the invi-
tation; and 
Whereas the World’s Largest Drum is an 
essential element of the ‘‘All-American’’ 
Marching Band’s performances across Indi-
ana, the United States, and the world: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the Purdue ‘‘All-American’’ Marching 
Band, which is celebrating the 100th anniver-
sary of the construction of the World’s Larg-
est Drum, continues to remain an important 
cultural and historical icon of Purdue Uni-
versity and the State of Indiana; 
(2) the World’s Largest Drum deserves rec-
ognition for the continued legacies of excel-
lence and discipline exhibited by the World’s 
Largest Drum crew and the Purdue ‘‘All- 
American’’ Marching Band; and 
(3) continued admiration of the World’s 
Largest Drum exemplifies the spirit of inge-
nuity of the people of the United States to 
push the bounds of engineering and create 
new products.

581—SUP-
PORTING THE DESIGNATION OF 
THE 
WEEK 
OF 
APRIL 
24 
THROUGH APRIL 30, 2022, AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 
WEEK’’ 
Mr. GRASSLEY submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 581 
Whereas crime and victimization in the 
United States have significant, and some-
times life-shattering, impacts on victims, 
survivors, 
and 
communities 
across 
the 
United States; 
Whereas research suggests that there are 
several million violent victimizations each 
year in the United States, yet less than half 
of all violent crimes are ever reported to po-
lice; 
Whereas crime victims and survivors need 
and deserve support and access to services to 
help them cope with the physical, psycho-
logical, financial, and other adverse effects 
of crime; 
Whereas Congress has recognized the im-
portance of supporting crime victims and 
survivors through the passage of legislation 
concerning this important issue, including— 
(1) the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (34 
U.S.C. 20101 et seq.); 
(2) the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 
(34 U.S.C. 12291 et seq.); 
(3) the Survivors’ Bill of Rights Act of 2016 
(Public Law 114–236; 130 Stat. 966); 
(4) the Family Violence Prevention and 
Services Act (42 U.S.C. 10401 et seq.); 
(5) the Trafficking Victims Protection Act 
of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.); 
(6) the Elder Abuse Prevention and Pros-
ecution Act (34 U.S.C. 21701 et seq.); 
(7) the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Por-
nography Victim Assistance Act of 2018 
(Public Law 115–299; 132 Stat. 4383); 
(8) the Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, 
Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila 
Lynn Crime Victims’ Rights Act (Public Law 
108–405; 118 Stat. 2261); and 
(9) the Justice for All Act of 2004 (Public 
Law 108–405; 118 Stat. 2260); 
Whereas crime can touch the life of any in-
dividual, regardless of the age, race, national 
origin, religion, or gender of that individual; 
Whereas a just society acknowledges the 
impact of crime on individuals, families, 
schools, and communities by protecting the 
rights of crime victims and survivors; 
Whereas crime victims and survivors in the 
United States, and the families of those vic-
tims and survivors, need and deserve support 
and assistance to help cope with the often 
devastating consequences of crime; 
Whereas, since Congress adopted the first 
resolution designating Crime Victims Week 
in 1985, communities across the United 
States have joined Congress and the Depart-
ment of Justice in commemorating National 
Crime Victims’ Rights Week to celebrate a 
shared vision of a comprehensive and col-
laborative response that identifies and ad-
dresses the many needs of crime victims and 
survivors and the families of those victims 
and survivors; 
Whereas the Senate applauds the work of 
crime victims advocates to ensure that all 
crime victims and survivors, and the fami-
lies of those victims and survivors, are— 
(1) treated with dignity, fairness, and re-
spect; 
(2) offered support and services, regardless 
of whether the victims and survivors report 
crimes committed against them; and 
(3) recognized as key participants within 
the criminal, juvenile, Federal, and Tribal 
justice systems in the United States when 
the victims and survivors report crimes; and 
Whereas the Senate recognizes and appre-
ciate the continued importance of— 
(1) promoting the rights of, and services 
for, crime victims and survivors; and 
(2) honoring crime victims and survivors, 
and the individuals who provide services for 
those victims and survivors: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of the week of 
April 24 through April 30, 2022, as ‘‘National 
Crime Victims’ Rights Week’’; 
(2) recognizes that crime victims and sur-
vivors, and the families of those victims and 
survivors, should be treated with dignity, 
fairness, and respect; 
(3) applauds the work carried out by thou-
sands of victim assistance organizations and 
agencies that serve crime survivors at the 
local, State, Federal, and Tribal levels; 
(4) remains committed to funding pro-
grams authorized by the Victims of Crime 
Act of 1984 (34 U.S.C. 20101 et seq.) and the 
Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (34 
U.S.C. 12291 et seq.), among other Federal 
programs, which help thousands of public, 
community-based, and Tribal victim and 
survivor assistance organizations and agen-
cies that provide essential, and often life- 
saving, services to millions of crime victims 
throughout the United States; and 
(5) encourages the observance of the 41st 
anniversary of National Crime Victims’ 
Rights Week with appropriate public aware-
ness, education, and outreach activities.

S. RES. 582 
Whereas, on March 1, 1872, Congress estab-
lished Yellowstone National Park as the first 
national park for the enjoyment of the peo-
ple of the United States; 
Whereas, on August 25, 1916, Congress es-
tablished the National Park Service with the 
mission to preserve unimpaired the natural 
and cultural resources and values of the Na-
tional Park System for the enjoyment, edu-
cation, and inspiration of current and future 
generations; 
Whereas, on March 1, 2022, Yellowstone Na-
tional Park was the first national park with-
in the National Park System to celebrate its 
sesquicentennial; 
Whereas the National Park Service con-
tinues to protect and manage the majestic 
landscapes, hallowed battlefields, and iconic 
cultural and historical sites of the United 
States; 
Whereas the units of the National Park 
System can be found in every State and 
many territories of the United States and 
many of those units embody the rich natural 
and cultural heritage of the United States, 
reflect a unique national story through peo-
ple and places, and offer countless opportuni-
ties for recreation, volunteerism, cultural 
exchange, education, civic engagement, and 
exploration; 
Whereas visits and visitors to the national 
parks of the United States are important 
economic drivers, responsible for contrib-
uting $28,600,000,000 in spending to the na-
tional economy in 2020; 
Whereas the dedicated employees of the 
National Park Service carry out their mis-
sion to protect the units of the National 
Park System so that the vibrant culture, di-
verse wildlife, and priceless resources of 
these unique places will endure for per-
petuity; and 
Whereas the people of the United States 
have inherited the remarkable legacy of the 
National Park System and are entrusted 
with the preservation of the National Park 
System throughout its second century: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week of April 16 through 
April 24, 2022, as ‘‘National Park Week’’; and 
(2) encourages the people of the United

IDEALS 
OF 
NATIONAL 
SAFE 
DIGGING MONTH 
Mr. 
PETERS 
(for 
himself, 
Mrs. 
FISCHER, Mr. WICKER, and Ms. CANT-
WELL) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 583 
Whereas, each year, the underground util-
ity infrastructure of the United States, in-
cluding 
pipelines, 
electric, 
gas, 
tele-
communications, water, sewer, and cable tel-
evision lines, is jeopardized by unintentional 
damage caused by those who fail to have un-
derground utility lines located prior to 
digging; 
Whereas some utility lines are buried only 
a few inches underground, making the lines 
easy to strike, even during shallow digging 
projects; 
Whereas digging prior to having under-
ground utility lines located often results in 
unintended consequences, such as service 
interruption, environmental damage, per-
sonal injury, and even death; 
Whereas the month of April marks the be-
ginning of the peak period during which ex-
cavation projects are carried out around the 
United States; 
Whereas, in 2002, Congress required the De-
partment of Transportation and the Federal 
Communications Commission to establish a 
3-digit, nationwide, toll-free number to be 
used by State ‘‘One Call’’ systems to provide 
information on underground utility lines; 
Whereas, in 2005, the Federal Communica-
tions Commission designated ‘‘811’’ as the 
nationwide ‘‘One Call’’ number for home-
owners and excavators to use to obtain infor-
mation on underground utility lines before 
conducting excavation activities; 
Whereas the 1,800 members of the Common 
Ground Alliance, States, ‘‘One Call’’ centers, 
and other stakeholders who are dedicated to 
ensuring public safety, environmental pro-
tection, and the integrity of services, pro-
mote the national ‘‘Call Before You Dig’’ 
campaign to increase public awareness about 
the importance of homeowners and exca-
vators calling 811 to find out the location of 
underground utility lines before digging; 
Whereas the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory 
Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (Pub-
lic Law 112–90; 125 Stat. 1904) affirmed and 
expanded the ‘‘One Call’’ program by elimi-
nating exemptions given to local and State 
government agencies and their contractors 
regarding notifying ‘‘One Call’’ centers be-
fore digging; 
Whereas, according to the Common Ground 
Alliance’s 2020 Damage Information Report-
ing Tool (DIRT) Report published in October 
2021, there were an estimated 468,000 in-
stances of excavation-related damage to un-
derground facilities in the United States dur-
ing 2020, and failing to contact 811 in advance 
of a digging project caused over 30 percent of 
these damages; 
Whereas, in 2021, the Common Ground Alli-
ance conducted a survey of active diggers 
who have completed a project within the 
past 12 months and found that 74 percent of 
the more than 1,800 respondents were aware 
of 811; 
Whereas the Common Ground Alliance es-
timated that the societal costs of exca-
vation-related damage to buried utilities 
were $30,000,000,000 in 2019, including costs for 
facility repair, property damage, medical 
bills, and costs to the surrounding businesses 
affected by the resulting utility outages; and 
Whereas the Common Ground Alliance has 
designated April as ‘‘National Safe Digging 
Month’’ to increase awareness of safe digging 
practices across the United States and to 
celebrate the anniversary of 811, the national 
‘‘Call Before You Dig’’ number: Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Safe Digging Month; 
(2) encourages all homeowners and exca-
vators throughout the United States to call 
811 before digging; and 
(3) 
encourages 
all 
damage 
prevention 
stakeholders to help educate homeowners 
and excavators throughout the United States 
about the importance of calling 811 before 
digging.

SA 5020. Mr. SCHUMER submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed by 
him to the bill H.R. 7108, to suspend 
normal trade relations treatment for 
the Russian Federation and the Repub-
lic of Belarus, and for other purposes; 
which was ordered to lie on the table; 
as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Suspending 
Normal Trade Relations with Russia and 
Belarus Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The United States is a founding member 
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and 
is committed to ensuring that the WTO re-
mains an effective forum for peaceful eco-
nomic engagement. 
(2) Ukraine is a sovereign nation-state that 
is entitled to enter into agreements with 
other sovereign states and to full respect of 
its territorial integrity. 
(3) The United States will be unwavering in 
its support for a secure, democratic, and sov-
ereign Ukraine, free to choose its own lead-
ers and future. 
(4) Ukraine acceded to the Marrakesh 
Agreement Establishing the World Trade Or-
ganization (WTO Agreement) and has been a 
WTO member since 2008. 
(5) Ukraine’s participation in the WTO 
Agreement creates both rights and obliga-
tions vis-a`-vis other WTO members. 
(6) The Russian Federation acceded to the 
WTO on August 22, 2012, becoming the 156th 
WTO member, and the Republic of Belarus 
has applied to accede to the WTO. 
(7) From the date of its accession, the Rus-
sian Federation committed to apply fully all 
provisions of the WTO. 
(8) The United States Congress authorized 
permanent normal trade relations for the 
Russian Federation through the Russia and 
Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei 
Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act 
of 2012 (Public Law 112–208). 
(9) Ukraine communicated to the WTO 
General Council on March 2, 2022, urging 
that all WTO members take action against 
the Russian Federation and ‘‘consider fur-
ther steps with the view to suspending the 
Russian Federation’s participation in the 
WTO for its violation of the purpose and 
principles of this Organization’’. 
(10) Vladimir Putin, a ruthless dictator, 
has led the Russian Federation into a war of 
aggression against Ukraine, which— 
(A) denies Ukraine and its people their col-
lective rights to independence, sovereignty, 
and territorial integrity; 
(B) constitutes an emergency in inter-
national relations, because it is a situation 
of armed conflict that threatens the peace 
and security of all countries, including the 
United States; and 
(C) denies Ukraine its rightful ability to 
participate in international organizations, 
including the WTO. 
(11) The Republic of Belarus, also led by a 
ruthless dictator, Aleksander Lukashenka, is 
providing important material support to the 
Russian Federation’s aggression. 
(12) The Russian Federation’s exportation 
of goods in the energy sector is central to its 
ability to wage its war of aggression on 
Ukraine. 
(13) The United States, along with its allies 
and partners, has responded to recent aggres-
sion by the Russian Federation in Ukraine 
by imposing sweeping financial sanctions 
and stringent export controls. 
(14) The United States cannot allow the 
consequences of the Russian Federation’s ac-
tions to go unaddressed, and must lead fel-
low countries, in all fora, including the WTO, 
to impose appropriate consequences for the 
Russian Federation’s aggression. 
SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF NORMAL TRADE RELA-
TIONS WITH THE RUSSIAN FEDERA-
TION

REPUBLIC 
OF 
BELARUS.

LATIONS TREATMENT FOR THE RUS-
SIAN FEDERATION AND THE REPUB-
LIC OF BELARUS. 
(a) TEMPORARY APPLICATION OF HTS COL-

rarily resume, for one or more periods not to

Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United 
States to the products of the Russian Fed-

ning on the date that is 90 calendar days

BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Mr. President, 
in a few moments, I will lock in an 
agreement on a number of important 
votes tomorrow. 
First and foremost, we have reached 
an agreement for the Senate to con-
clude 
the 
confirmation 
process 
of 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson tomor-
row. We will hold a cloture vote tomor-
row morning at approximately 11 a.m., 
and the final vote for her confirmation 
is on track to take place at around 1:45 
tomorrow afternoon, depending on how 
many Members wish to speak. 
It will be a joyous day—joyous for 
the Senate, joyous for the Supreme 
Court, joyous for America—but we still 
have a long way to go. America, tomor-
row, will take a giant step to becoming 
a more perfect nation. 
I will have more to say on this his-
toric occasion tomorrow, but, for now, 
I wish to thank my Senate colleagues 
for working together to advance and fi-
nalize this historic nomination to the 
Supreme Court. 
Second, I will also lock in an agree-
ment to hold a series of votes on PNTR 
and the oil ban tomorrow. 
After many rounds of negotiations 
with Republicans, we have reached an 
important and crucial breakthrough. 
This agreement clears the path to fi-
nally approve legislation that will strip 
Russia of permanent normal trade rela-
tions with the United States. It will 
also allow the Senate to take separate 
action on an oil ban proposal as we 
originally sought. These proposals both 
have the support of the White House, 
and it is a big, big deal that we are fi-
nally getting them done. I wish this 
could have happened sooner, but after 
weeks of talks with the other side, it is 
important that we have found a path 
forward to getting PNTR done on a bi-
partisan basis. 
I want to sincerely thank Senator 
CRAPO, who worked in good faith with 
us, together, and we wouldn’t have 
reached an outcome—this outcome— 
without his diligence and good faith. 
f 
SUSPENDING NORMAL TRADE RE-
LATIONS 
WITH 
RUSSIA 
AND 
BELARUS ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, Putin 
absolutely must be held accountable 
for the detestable, detestable, des-
picable war crimes he is committing 
against Ukraine. The images we have 
seen coming out of that country, espe-
cially out of the town of Bucha, are 
just pure evil—it reminds us of the 
worst moments in human history— 
caused by the evil man, Putin: hun-
dreds of civilians murdered in cold 
blood—men, women, children, the el-
derly, the defenseless; people with 
hands tied behind their backs and left 
dead on the streets; civilians shot in 
the back of the head—all for one rea-
son: They are Ukrainians. It is one des-
picable reason. 
This is genocide when you murder, 
wantonly, innocent civilians because of 
who they are. Whether it be their reli-
gion, their race, or their nationality, 
that is genocide, and Mr. Putin is 
guilty of it. 
Formally revoking normal trade re-
lations with Russia is precisely the 
right thing for the Senate to do be-
cause it will land another huge blow to 
Putin’s economy. It is a key part of

for their good work and look forward 
to passing PNTR in the Senate tomor-

ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwith-
standing rule XXII, at 10 a.m. tomor-
row, April 7, the Senate resume legisla-
tive session and proceed to the en bloc 
consideration of H.R. 6968, the Russian 
oil ban, and H.R. 7108, the Russia 
PNTR, both of which are at the desk; 
that amendment No. 5021 to H.R. 6968 
be considered and agreed to; that 
amendment No. 5020 to H.R. 7108 be 
considered and agreed to; and that 
those be the only amendments in order 
to either bill; that the bills, as amend-
ed, be considered read a third time en 
bloc; that the Senate vote on the pas-
sage of H.R. 7108, as amended, and H.R. 
6968, as amended; and that with respect 
to both bills, the motions to reconsider 
be considered made and laid upon the 
table without further intervening ac-
tion or debate; further, that upon the 
disposition of H.R. 6968, the Senate re-
sume executive session and vote on the 
motion to invoke cloture on Executive 
Calendar No. 860, the nomination of 
Ketanji Brown Jackson. Finally, I ask 
unanimous consent that the manda-
tory quorum call for the cloture mo-
tion with respect to the Jackson nomi-
nation be waived; that if any nomina-
tions are confirmed during Thursday’s 
session of the Senate, the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table and the President be im-
mediately notified of the Senate’s ac-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise in 
strong support for Senator SCHUMER’s 
request for unanimous consent for the 
Senate to proceed to the en bloc con-
sideration of H.R. 6968, the Russian oil 
ban, and H.R. 7108, the Russian perma-
nent normal trade relations legisla-
tion. 
I want to thank Senators SCHUMER, 
WYDEN, WICKER, PAUL, CARDIN, MUR-
KOWSKI, MANCHIN, LANKFORD, RISCH, 
MENENDEZ, CORNYN, and SULLIVAN. It is 
a long list of Senators who worked 
hard on this legislation to get us to 
this point. They exemplify how you can 
be both principled and reasonable. 
I want to especially again thank Sen-
ator SCHUMER. We did work carefully 
and long together. We spent tireless 
days working to try to make sure that 
this worked out. We, I think, both ac-
knowledge that we respect the good 
faith that each of us has shown in mov-
ing this forward and getting it to this 
point. 
Thanks to the efforts of all of these 
Senators, the Senate is in a position to 
pass these important bills. Impor-
tantly, their efforts in this Chamber 
reflect the best of what Ukraine des-
perately seeks to preserve and that 
which Vladimir Putin is determined to 
destroy: freedom and representative 
government. 
That is why the legislation at issue is 
so important. It strikes directly at 
Putin and cuts off the lifeblood for his 
war machine and his autocracy by ban-
ning U.S. imports of Russian energy 
products, including petroleum, natural 
gas, and coal. It places Russia and 
Belarus in the same pariah status as 
North Korea and Cuba for trade. 
The congressional action, including 
the certification criteria in the bills, is 
critical because it signifies a standing 
commitment to the Ukrainian people 
and to our NATO allies that is more 
durable than Putin’s machinations in 
Ukraine. This legislation will inspire 
our allies to take similar actions 
against Russia. 
As President Zelenskyy told us when 
he asked for the ban, ‘‘[It] can be called 
an embargo [or it can be] just moral-
ity.’’ 
Because this legislation is so critical 
to the support of Ukraine, we must act 
in unison on these bills and call on 
Speaker PELOSI to promptly vote on 
this legislation in the House, where it 
will also receive a resounding vote in 
favor. 
Therefore, I strongly second Senator 
SCHUMER’s request and also ask that 
the Senate agree to it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my friend, 
the Senator from Idaho.

The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
for a third reading and was read the 
third time. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I know of no further 
debate on the bill. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there 
is no further debate and the bill having 
been read the third time, the question 
is, Shall the bill pass? 
The bill (S. 3522), as amended, was 
passed. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the

HONORING THE LIFE OF BEVERLY 
CAMP 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of a dear 
friend, Beverly ‘‘Bev’’ Camp, of Bakersfield, 
California. After battling cancer for nearly two 
years, Bev passed away on February 19, 
2022, surrounded by loved ones. 
Born in Queens, New York, Bev entered the 
world on July 29, 1962 to two loving parents. 
As the youngest of three children, she was cu-
rious and patient, always putting others before 
herself. In 1979, when Bev was 17, her family 
packed their bags and moved out to Bakers-
field, California—the city where Bev would 
meet her husband and partner in life, raise 
three beautiful children, and make countless 
contributions to our community. 
A woman of faith and compassion, Bev de-
voted her time to charitable causes. As a 
member of Catholic Charities, Bev advanced 
the launch of Harvest of Hope, an annual 
fundraiser that provides financial support to 
low-income families facing hardship, and 
helped found the organization’s Career and 
Education Center, which helps students de-
velop career skills for future employment. 
Along with her husband Jim, Bev’s philan-
thropic efforts were impactful to many other 
community initiatives. In 2019, the pair helped 
establish the county’s first burn unit at Bakers-
field Memorial Hospital and more recently, 
were leading the expansion project for Mercy 
Hospital Southwest to address the growing 
needs of Bakersfield residents. 
In recognition of her efforts, Bev was regu-
larly recognized with awards by local organiza-
tions, including Community Action Partnership 
of Kern County’s Humanitarian of the Year, 
the Kern County Hispanic Chamber of Com-
merce’s Community Service Award, and Gar-
den Pathways’ Woman with a Heart for Ba-
kersfield. 
Above all, Bev loved her family. She en-
joyed watching her kids grow and took pride in 
the Sunday family dinners she cooked after 
church. Bev is survived by her husband Jim; 
her parents Bruce and Margaret Murray; and 
her three sons, Bruce and wife, Kayla; Kurt 
and wife, Montse; and Scott. 
On behalf of the 23rd Congressional District 
of California, it is my privilege to honor Bev’s 
life and the remarkable service and impact 
she had on our community. My thoughts and 
prayers are with her loved ones as they mourn 
the loss of an incredible woman. 
RECOGNIZING OFFICER JONATHAN 
DIAZ 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life and service of Offi-
cer Jonathan Diaz as the California legislature 
dedicates the Lemoore overpass for Highway 
198 and 19th Avenue in his honor. 
A Huron native, Mr. Diaz graduated from 
Coalinga High School. He went on to earn his 
associates degree in criminal justice from 
West Hills College. Following his passion for 
serving his community, he joined the Huron 
Police Department as a reserve police officer 
during the summer of 2014. Just one year 
later, he was named Officer of the Year by the 
Huron Police Department. He would later join 
the Lemoore Police Department in 2016, 
where he earned Officer of the Year in 2018. 
Mr. Diaz was equally committed to helping 
those in his community outside of his regular 
duties. He was involved in the Youth Adult 
Awareness Program, where he helped to men-
tor and guide at-risk children in the commu-
nity. He also participated in developing juve-
nile awareness programs to teach local youth 
about the realities of prison and incarceration 
and put them on a path to success. Through 
his dedication to his community and his com-
mitment to service, Mr. Diaz uplifted so many 
during his life. 
Mr. Diaz’s courage, dedication, profes-
sionalism, and selflessness was well-known 
throughout his entire department. He played a 
vital role in solving a significant number of 
cases, helping to bring justice to those he 
swore to protect. While he is missed by his 
loved ones every day, his service still inspires 
us all. 
I ask all my colleagues in the United States 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring the life and service of Officer Jonathan 
Diaz of the Lemoore Police Department.

HONORING ATTORNEY YEMI KINGS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
public servant, Attorney Yemi Kings from 
Jackson, Mississippi. 
He graduated from Lanier High School and 
went on to Tougaloo College. Then, received 
his law degree from Thurgood Marshall School 
of Law in 2009. Little did the Kings realize that 
when he valiantly saved the life of a man, who 
was tragically shot on Thanksgiving Day in 
2021, in Jackson, that he was walking straight 
into fame’s arena. 
On Thanksgiving Day 2021, around 4:30 
p.m., when there was still a glimmer of day-
light outside, Kings’ friends and family were 
eating dinner. During the celebration, they 
heard about 15–gun shots from what sounded 
like an assault rifle close to where they gath-
ered. Then they heard someone yelling, ‘‘I 
have been shot.’’ 
Kings went outside and saw a man lying on 
the ground in a pool of gushing blood. He was 
crying, screaming, and saying, ‘‘Please help 
me! Don’t let me die!’’ After calling 911, Kings 
asked him where he was shot. The victim re-
plied, ‘‘I can’t feel my arm! Help me! I have 
been shot! I am fading out! I am dying!’’ Kings 
grabbed sweaters and shirts from a car, 
wrapped them in layers and pressed them on 
the bullet wound until the bleeding stopped. ‘‘I 
kept pressure on his wound and continued 
talking to him, telling him that he was going to 
live.’’ Kings said. 
Firefighters came and took over. They told 
everyone to step aside as they did their job. 
The good Samaritan who courageously 
saved the person’s life was Deputy Hinds 
County Attorney Yemi L. Kings. 
When asked what motivated him to be so 
daring in such a dangerous escapade, he 
said, ‘‘One thing that came to mind was that 
I had to try to help save this man’s life. As a 
prosecutor, I am always helping people on the 
other side of tragic situations. I never thought 
I would ever come that close to a shooting or 
a shooting victim.’’ 
Kings is the son of Yemi L. Kings and Terri 
Lyn Smith. 
Kings’ motivation is his family. He comes 
from a large family that includes four brothers, 
two sisters and one son. He wants to continue 
being there for his loved ones. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Attorney Yemi Kings for his 
dedication to serving.

MICHIGAN WORLD WAR II LEGACY 
MEMORIAL 
HON. ANDY LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the groundbreaking of 
the Michigan World War II (WWII) Legacy Me-
morial, which will take place in Royal Oak, 
Michigan on April 7, 2022. 
This effort has been a fifteen-year labor of 
love for a dedicated group of volunteers, many 
of whom had family members who served in 
the military, including in World War II, and 
some who are veterans themselves. In 2007, 
Honor Flight Michigan began providing one- 
day trips to Washington, D.C. to allow World 
War II veterans to visit the national World War 
II Memorial on the National Mall. Between 
2007 and 2010, Honor Flight Michigan oper-
ated 33 flights, ensuring that all 1,400 vet-
erans on its waiting list made the trip to our 
nation’s capital. The group then committed 
itself to creating a memorial in Michigan. Its in-
tent is best described in the words of the orga-
nization itself: ‘‘The Michigan WWII Legacy

Memorial will serve as a place to gather, re-
member, and inspire. It is a memorial de-
signed with the desire to engage the commu-
nity and educate future generations on the vi-
sion, values, and heroic efforts of the Greatest 
Generation.’’ 
The organization chose Royal Oak as the 
location for the memorial because of its cen-
tral location in the heart of Southeast Michi-
gan, and with the strong support of the City of 
Royal Oak to host the memorial at Memorial 
Park on Woodward Avenue and Thirteen Mile 
Road. The memorial has been designed to be 
educational and interactive and as a center of 
community activities as well as serving as a 
place for contemplation and remembrance. 
This week, after fifteen years of work, 
ground will be broken for the construction of 
this important tribute to a defining point in his-
tory and to the vital contributions millions of 
Americans made to the essential cause of 
winning World War II. So many people have 
played important roles in guiding this project to 
this significant day, and it would be impossible 
to name all of them. But I would like to recog-
nize the Board of Directors of the Michigan 
World War II Legacy Memorial for their efforts: 
President John Maten, Vice-President Chris 
Graveline, Secretary Kim Jones, Treasurer J. 
Michael Mastentuono; board members Debi 
Hollis, Russell Levine, Judy Maten, Ryan 
Friedrichs and Molly Gale; and Honorary Di-
rector Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Alexander Jef-
ferson who served in the legendary Tuskegee 
Airmen. I would also like to recognize two 
members of the board who sadly passed away 
before this occasion: Michael Cameron and 
former Oakland County Executive L. Brooks 
Patterson. 
Madam Speaker, I invite my colleagues to 
join me in celebrating the groundbreaking of 
the Michigan World War II Legacy Memorial, 
which I have no doubt will be viewed as a 
jewel in Southeast Michigan, and in congratu-
lating all those who made vital contributions to 
this truly momentous occasion.

COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
THE 
MASSACHU-
SETTS STATE LOTTERY 
HON. KATHERINE M. CLARK 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Mas-
sachusetts State Lottery as it celebrates its 
50th anniversary. 
Since selling its first ticket on March 22, 
1972, the Mass Lottery has generated over 
$137 billion in revenues, returning over $29 
billion in net profit to the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts. These funds have been dis-
tributed to all 351 cities and towns in Massa-
chusetts as unrestricted local aid, supporting a 
wide range of initiatives, including public safe-
ty, snow removal, road improvements, school 
staffing and services, programs for seniors, 
and parks and recreation projects. 
The Mass Lottery has awarded over $96 bil-
lion in prizes to its loyal customers. Prize win-
ners have been able to put their winnings to-
ward the purchase of homes, sending their 
kids to college, opening their own businesses, 
covering medical expenses and making dona-
tions to charitable organizations. 
The Mass Lottery has been a valuable 
source of additional income for thousands of 
businesses across the state, and collectively 
the Mass Lottery’s retail partners have earned 
over $7.8 billion in commissions and bonuses 
over the last fifty years. 
Under the guidance of the Mass Lottery, 
Charitable Gaming events have given non- 
profit organizations in Massachusetts opportu-
nities to raise money to support their causes 
while providing social entertainment in their 
communities. 
Over the last five decades, Mass Lottery 
employees have worked diligently to build the 
Mass Lottery into one of the most successful 
lotteries in the world. In turn, the Mass Lottery 
has been a valuable employer in the state, of-
fering a wide range of career opportunities 
with pathways for advancement within the or-
ganization. 
The Mass Lottery will be commemorating 
‘‘50 Years of Winning’’ throughout 2022 by 
showing its appreciation for the customers, re-
tailers, communities and employees who are a 
part of its amazing success story. 
Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to 
recognize the Massachusetts State Lottery as 
it celebrates its 50th anniversary.

REMEMBERING ALCEE HASTINGS 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the one-year anniversary of the 
passing of Representative Alcee Hastings, a 
civil rights advocate and active leader of the 
Commission on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (U.S. Helsinki Commission) for more 
than twenty years. His work included pro-
moting principled foreign policy, human rights, 
strengthened democracy across Europe, do-
mestic and international election observations, 
and diversity and inclusion at all levels of gov-
ernment and foreign policy decision making. 
Alcee Hastings passed away on April 6, 2021. 
As a U.S. Helsinki Commissioner, Rep. 
Hastings served as Ranking Member, Co- 
Chairman, and twice as Chairman from 2007– 
2008 and 2019–2020. He was the first African 
American Chair of the Commission, and over 
the full span of his time on the Commission, 
visited all 57 participating States (pS) of the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe (OSCE), 11 Asian and Mediterranean 
OSCE Partners for Co-operation countries, 
and attended over three dozen meetings of 
the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE 
PA). 
In addition to holding various leadership po-
sitions at the U.S. Helsinki Commission, Alcee 
Hastings also held offices with the OSCE PA, 
including Rapporteur of the First Committee 
on Political Affairs and Security, Vice Chair of 
the First Committee, Chair of the First Com-
mittee, Special Representative of Mediterra-
nean Affairs, Vice President of the OSCE PA, 
President of the OSCE PA, and President 
Emeritus of the OSCE PA. Alcee remains the 
only American to hold the office of President 
of the 323-member body. 
Alcee brought attention to several issues 
throughout the OSCE region and pushed to le-
gitimize U.S. authority on human rights stand-
ards. He was a staunch opponent of Russian 
attempts to undermine security and stability in 
Europe and beyond, holding hearings as Chair 
on Russia’s support for separatists and intro-
ducing legislation aiding Georgia following the 
2008 invasion by Russia and supporting 
Ukraine’s democratic gains since the 2004 Or-
ange Revolution. He was an outspoken sup-
porter of Europe’s largest ethnic minority, the 
Roma, and he led efforts to address anti-Sem-
itism and anti-Jewish violence in OSCE pS. 
Alcee was deeply engaged in the Middle East 
peace process, improving relations with Medi-
terranean partners, protections for minorities in 
the Kosovo independence plan, and strength-
ening democracy and expansion within the 
European Union. Thanks to his efforts stress-
ing the importance of having election observ-
ers monitor U.S. elections, the OSCE PA held 
its first election observation mission in the 
U.S. in 2002. 
Representative Hastings believed that diver-
sity and inclusion in foreign policy was critical 
for upholding democratic values. This included 
equal representation across different racial, 
ethnic, gender identity, sexual orientation, reli-
gious and geographic communities, including 
youth participation. He held hearings, intro-
duced legislation, supported programs at the 
State Department and fellowship programs 
geared towards promoting minority participa-
tion, and worked with European partners on 
initiatives to meet this end. 
Alcee Hastings was born in Altamonte 
Springs, Florida and received his bachelor’s 
degree from Fisk University in Nashville, Ten-
nessee and his law degree from Florida A&M 
University. Prior to serving in government, he 
tirelessly fought racial injustice as a civil rights 
lawyer and activist. In 1979, Representative 
Hastings became the first African American 
Federal Judge in the State of Florida when 
President Jimmy Carter appointed him to the 
bench. When elected to Congress in 1992, he 
was one of the first three African Americans to 
represent Florida since the reconstruction era. 
He has long championed the rights of minori-
ties, women, the elderly, children, and immi-
grants. 
It was an honor to serve with Representa-
tive Alcee Hastings in Congress and to have 
the privilege to work with him on the Helsinki 
Commission. He was the reason I sought ap-
pointment. I am proud to have called him my 
friend and will be forever grateful to him for in-
troducing me to the Commission on which I 
now serve as Co-Chairman. He is remem-
bered by all here and at the OSCE PA. His 
was a life well-lived.

E361 
April 6, 2022 
Born in Bristow, Oklahoma, Mrs. Wilson 
graduated from Langston University, an his-
torically Black university, with a bachelor’s de-
gree in business administration. After her 
graduation, she moved to Vallejo, California, in 
1973, where she co-founded the Kappa Beta 
Omega Chapter of the Alpha Kappa Alpha So-
rority. Kappa Beta Omega Chapter focuses on 
introducing students to the different options of 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities 
and the benefits of attending these schools. 
Mrs. Wilson also served on the Vallejo City 
Unified School District governing board for 14 
years and still attends their meetings to sup-
port Vallejo students by addressing community 
concerns to the district and its board. 
As a Community Liaison Volunteer for the 
CC and Amber Sabathia PitCCh-In Founda-
tion, Mrs. Wilson has worked to provide free 
backpacks and school supplies to elementary 
school children and teachers in Vallejo. She 
also contributes to an annual scholarship for a 
high school senior who will be attending an 
historically Black college or university. 
Mrs. Wilson is an advocate and a con-
sensus builder for students across the city. 
Through her extensive work with the school 
district and other non-profits like the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People, the African American Alliance of 
Vallejo, and the Solano County Chapter of the 
Link, Inc., she has directly impacted the lives 
of so many children. 
Her husband, a retired teacher, Michael Wil-
son and their two children, Michael Wilson III, 
a teacher, and Andrinee Wilson-Tucker, Ph.D., 
a psychologist, also graduated from Histori-
cally Black Colleges and Universities. Mrs. 
Wilson’s family and the rest of the community 
describe her as incredibly compassionate, dig-
nified, and motivated in supporting students 
with their education. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Hazel 
Wilson has dedicated her life to the students 
of Vallejo through her public service. There-
fore, it is fitting and proper that we honor her 
here today.

HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to pay a tribute to the 
heroic crew members of Tow Boat US Beau-
fort (TBUS). On February 13, 2022, TBUS 
was alerted to a possible downed aircraft east 
of Cape Lookout shoals near Drum Inlet. This 
aircraft was comprised of eight individuals, in-
cluding four high school students. The honor-
able crew quickly departed towards the vicinity 
of the last known position of the aircraft. At 
this time, weather conditions were deterio-
rating, and seas were a rough 3 to 5 feet. 
The wreckage of the aircraft was found be-
fore dark, and it was clear that there were like-
ly no possible survivors. The next morning, 
emergency services called TBUS seeking their 
assistance in locating the aircraft on the sea 
floor. While local first responders focused on 
chasing floating debris offshore, the TBUS 
crew investigated where the plane struck the 
water using sonar to locate the wreckage. By 
4:00 PM on February 14, 2022, TBUS con-
firmed they had found the crash site and had 
remotely operated vehicle footage of the de-
bris on the bottom. That night, TBUS crews 
would be tasked with running the dive oper-
ations, while providing divers and surface sup-
port for body recovery. 
The next day, February 15, 2022, TBUS 
had put together a dive plan and divers to try 
and access the aircraft. Water temperatures 
were around 52 degrees on the surface, the 
current was running approximately 3.9 knots 
on the bottom in 60 feet of water, and seas 
were rough at 3 to 5 feet, making this an ex-
traordinarily difficult dive to achieve with lim-
ited bottom time. TBUS crews worked until the 
next day, when all the remains had been re-
covered for the families. While this was a 
strenuous job, the selfless heroes at TBUS 
thought it was a necessary mission to help the 
grieving families of the victims. Putting divers 
in during small craft conditions, 50-degree 
water, and heavy currents makes for very dan-
gerous conditions that highlight the heroic ac-
tions of the TBUS crew. 
TBUS crew members involved were Lee 
Sykes, Johnathon Evans, Jay Boone, Crockett 
Henderson, Luis Herron and John Wilson. 
None of this would have been possible were 
it not for the selflessness and servant attitude 
of the aforementioned members. Madam 
Speaker, please join me in honoring these in-
credible and wonderful heroes.

RECOGNIZING MR. RONALD 
D’ARTENAY, SR. 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Mr. Ronald ‘‘Ron’’ 
d’Artenay, Sr., who passed away on Sunday, 
January 23, 2022. 
Mr. d’Artenay was born in Hanford, Cali-
fornia on June 29, 1943. He was raised in 
nearby Kettleman City where he first began 
helping his father on the farm. His interest in 
farming and agriculture continued to grow 
while attending Avenal High School. 
After graduation, Mr. d’Artenay chose to 
stay in the industry and started his first busi-
ness, d’Artenay Hay Service, early in his ca-
reer. In the 1980s, he started d’Artenay Farms 
in Coalinga, California, where he successfully 
grew pistachios for over thirty years. 
Mr. d’Artenay was also a fixture in the local 
racing community. He served as a founding 
member and president of the Avenal Sand 
Drags Association. He became known for his 
sand drag race car, ‘The Red Warrior.’ Mr. 
d’Artenay was a valued member of our local 
community, and it is with great pride that I rec-
ognize him for his service to the Central Val-
ley. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives to 
join me in honoring the life and legacy of Mr. 
Ronald ‘‘Ron’’ d’Artenay, Sr. 
IN MEMORIAM—ROBERT ‘‘BOB’’ 
FOOTE 
HON. TRACEY MANN 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
commemorate the memory of Bob Foote, a 
tremendous Kansan who passed away on 
March 25th. Bob was a man of many talents. 
He built one of the largest cattle operations in 
America, feeding 550,000 head a year and 
employing 400. He and his wife Gail also built 
an amazing family who will carry on his legacy 
and lead the Foote Cattle Company into the 
future. 
Bob had tenacity, grit, confidence, and he 
wasn’t afraid to embrace an aggressive ap-
proach to business. His motto was ‘‘Get It’’— 
which he would say to remind those around 
him to never give up and keep pushing for-
ward. Bob was a staunch conservative who 
could often be found giving one of his trade-
mark ‘‘Bob Foote lectures’’ on politics. He was 
a true patriot, and most importantly, now that 
he has gone on to heaven, he was a man of 
great faith. 
From the farm and headquarters in eastern 
Kansas, to ranchland in the Flint Hills, to feed 
yards in Western Kansas. I am hard pressed 
to think of any Ag producer who had such an 
impact on the entirety of Kansas agriculture. 
Whether he was buying cattle or sharing his 
faith and work ethic with his grandchildren, 
Bob believed that he should use the talents 
that God gave him to be the best man he 
could be. He is now able to reunite with his 
beloved Colleen and together watch over his 
legacy—the Foote Cattle Company—and gaze 
proudly on his spouse Gail and sons Scott, 
Brad, and Greg as they continue to lead the 
industry and Kansas Agriculture forward. 
May Bob Foote rest in peace.

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam

CELEBRATING 
THE 
COMMITTED 
SERVICE

SER-
GEANT 
MAJOR 
MICHAEL 
P. 
GEDEON 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the committed service 
of Command Sergeant Major Michael Gedeon. 
CMS Gedeon has been a fearless leader 
and public servant since he joined the Army 
on November 24, 1982. Serving 39 years of 
Active and Reserve Army service, he has 
shown tremendous courage and dedication to 
this country. 
Following Basic Training and Advanced Ini-
tial Training, he was allocated to the 1st Sig-
nal Battalion in Kaiserslautem West Germany 
from 1983 to 1985, and afterward served in 
the 501st Signal Battalion, 101st Airborne Divi-
sion. 
CSM Gedeon was deployed from 2004 to 
2005 and 2009 to 2010 to Haiti for Operation 
Uphold Democracy, Operation Joint Endeavor 
in Bosnia, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
Returning to American soil, he entered the 
US Army Reserve in the HHC second Psycho-
logical Operations Group and settled in Parma 
Ohio. 
As a life-long learner, CSM Gedeon started 
his military education with the Combat Life-
saver Course and ultimately ending with the 
Battalion Pre-Command Course in 2015. 
Since 1987, he has served in various sec-
ond 
POG—non 
combat—units 
and 
rose 
through the ranks to ultimately become a 
Command Sergeant Major in February of 
2013. The rank of CMS is the most senior en-
listed member of a color-bearing Army unit, 
and serves as a spokesman to address all the 
issues of soldiers to the unit commander. He 
also began working as the Director of Instruc-
tion in the twelfth/100th CA/MISO Training 
Battalion. 
In the latter half of his military career, CSM 
Gedeon accepted his first Command Sergeant 
Major assignment for the 16th Psychological 
Operations Battalion in Fort Sheridan, Illinois 
in January of 2014. His second assignment 
was the 11th Psychological Operations Bat-
talion in White Plains, Maryland in April of 
2016 to July of 2019 and his final assignment 
was in February of 2019, as the 2nd Psycho-
logical Operations Group Command Sergeant 
Major. 
With over 3 decades of experience, the 
Army has honored CSM Gedeon with multiple 
awards signifying his dedication and service to 
this country. His many decorations include the 
Bronze Star, the Meritorious Service Medal, 
the Army Commendation Medal and many 
others. 
After a lifetime of service at home and 
abroad, CSM Gedeon is now retired from duty 
and currently resides in Cleveland, Ohio 
where he works at a law firm and parents two 
young daughters, Paige and Molly. 
A huge congratulations to Hon. CSM Mi-
chael P. Gedeon. We thank him for his serv-
ice.

CONGRATULATING ENTERPRISE 
HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL TEAM 
HON. BARRY MOORE 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I am proud to honor an outstanding group of 
young men from my hometown who rep-
resented both their school and state this sea-
son. 
Enterprise Native, Head Coach, and friend, 
Coach Rhett Harrelson, led his team to their 
first-ever Wildcat 7A championship win. This 
team showed dedication and determination 
this season as they rallied around one another 
for the final game. To the players, Keion 
Dunlap, Jordan Hines, Elijah Terry, Tomar 
Hobdy, Kenneth Mitchell, Jr., Tre Kemmerlin, 
Mykel Johnson, Eric Winters, Dylan Baldwin, 
Tristan Agard, Quentin Hayes, Matther Reed, 
Nick Roberts, Talmadge Sessions, and Reese 
Dowling, cherish this win and continue to rep-
resent the wildcats with the same attitude you 
showed throughout the season and through 
long hours of practice. You knew as a team 
what it meant to get to this point in your bas-
ketball career and how to accomplish the 
goals you set for your team and yourself. Cel-
ebrate this win and remember the legacy you 
are creating as the first team in Enterprise his-
tory to win the championship. 
To assistant coaches and staff Clark 
Quisenberry, John Wadsworth, and Keith 
Sesions, I thank them for molding these stu-
dents into the young men that we see today. 
I thank them for their dedication to their stu-
dent-athletes as they worked long hours to 
teach them not only how to play the game 
well, but also how to love the sport. I know 
they will cherish this win and will continue to 
mentor students for years to come. 
To the fans, we thank them for always going 
the extra mile to be at games and always 
making sure their team was represented 
throughout the season. 
As a fellow wildcat, I want to honor this 
amazing team for all that they have accom-
plished, and I can’t wait to see their legacy 
continue. May this commemoration forever be 
preserved. 
AFFORDABLE INSULIN NOW ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. GARRET GRAVES 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 31, 2022 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
Pharma Bro Martin Shkreli should have doz-
ens of jailbird colleagues for the unethical 
practices of many in the pharmaceutical indus-
try. There is no question that the price of insu-
lin, EpiPens, asthma inhalers and hundreds of 
other drugs are multiple times what they 
should be and that needs to change. While I 
support the goal of H.R. 6833, as written the 
bill does nothing to actually lower the price of 
insulin—and zero for other drugs. The bill sim-
ply mandates that the out-of-pocket cost not 
exceed $35 for insulin. If you think insurance 
companies are just going to eat this extra cost 
then I’ve got a bridge to sell. Insurance com-
panies will simply increase premiums to cover 
the extra cost. This means everyone pays 
more. It’s a shell game. Obamacare has been 
a mess and that law doesn’t need any help in 
further raising insurance premiums. For that 
reason, I will vote ‘NAY’ for the bill. The solu-
tion here is to actually lower the cost of the 
prescriptions. This can be done by stopping 
patent abuse by pharmaceutical companies, 
allowing importation of drugs from countries 
with 
appropriate 
quality 
control, 
and 
incentivizing generic manufacturers. H.R. 19 is 
a bill that takes steps in the right direction. I 
would vote for that, but I am working with an-
other bipartisan group on a better solution.

Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Roy Sekine on his retirement 
from the County of Kern in California after 31 
years of service to our community. 
A friend and public servant, Roy attended 
college at California State University, Bakers-
field, graduating in 1991 with a Bachelor’s de-
gree in Computer Science. While still a college 
senior, Roy began working at the Kern County 
Library—which currently serves over 850,000 
county residents—as a systems coordinator. 
Maintaining his employment with the organiza-
tion upon graduation, Roy spent the next six 
years transforming the library system. Roy’s 
tireless efforts led to the installation of the first 
public internet terminal at Beale Library, the

implementation of Netscape browsers through-
out the 30 County Library Branches, and a 
swift transition to the electronic book checkout 
system for Kern County residents. 
One year after transferring to the Bakers-
field Municipal Court in 1997, Roy was re-
cruited to the Kern County Department of 
Child Support Services (KCDCSS). Named the 
Local Area Network Systems Administrator for 
KCDCSS, Roy led critical improvements to the 
Department’s technology systems for over 20 
years, enabling the organization to better as-
sist parents and youth in our community. With 
a savviness in computer networking and oper-
ations management, Roy helped start the 
KIDZ Child Support Program and implement 
the State of California’s CASES Child Support 
Program 
locally. 
Additionally, 
when 
the 
coronavirus pandemic forced KCDCSS oper-
ations online, Roy helped County staff work 
through technological issues so they could 
continue to serve Kern County residents in a 
seamless fashion. 
Roy’s service to Kern County is undeniable. 
In 2020, he was recognized with the KCDCSS 
Values Award for Teamwork for his patience, 
work ethic, and respect for all. On behalf of 
the 23rd Congressional District of California, l 
want to thank my good friend Roy for his un-
wavering commitment to bettering our commu-
nity and Kern County government that serves 
many of my constituents. Judy and I wish him 
the best as he enters this new chapter in his 
life.

HONORING DR. BRIANNA 
THOMPSON 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
innovative woman, Dr. Brianna Thompson. Dr. 
Thompson has shown what can be done 
through hard work, dedication, and a desire to 
achieve success. 
Dr. Brianna Thompson has been awarded 
top honors with the 2022 Black Engineer of 
the Year Awards (BEYA), which recognizes 
African-American scientists and engineers 
around the country. The winners chosen are 
leaders shaping the future of science, tech-
nology, 
engineering, 
and 
mathematics 
(STEM), as well as promoting diversity and in-
clusion in the STEM pipeline. She was recog-
nized at this year’s BEYA STEM Global Com-
petitiveness Conference, which was held in 
Washington, D.C. Feb. 17 through 19. 
Dr. Thompson began her career at ERDC in 
ITL three years ago as a mathematician and 
was chosen for the BEYA Modern-Day Tech-
nology 
Leader 
Award. 
Her 
research 
in 
hypersonic systems evaluation and design and 
the coupling of fluid, thermal and structure 
models 
for 
computational 
simulation 
of 
hypersonic systems is making a difference 
and advancing the capabilities of the Army 
and the DOD in developing state-of-the-art so-
lutions to challenging problems. Dr. Thompson 
earned her doctorate degree in computational 
science from the University of Southern Mis-
sissippi. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Dr. Brianna Thompson for 
her passion and dedication to the field of Engi-
neering.

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SE-
CURITY 
INSPECTOR 
GENERAL 
TRANSPARENCY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 5633. This bill requires 
the OIG to submit to Congress any report that 
substantiates a violation of specified provi-
sions regarding prohibited personnel practices, 
protected communications, or retaliatory per-
sonnel actions. 
The bill also requires the OIG to submit to 
Congress any report about a violation of Presi-
dential 
Personnel 
Directive–19 
(protecting 
whistleblowers with access to classified infor-
mation); or an allegation of misconduct, waste, 
fraud, abuse, or a violation of policy within 
DHS involving a senior DHS official. 
The OIG must make each report publicly 
available on its website, with some exceptions. 
The bill requires the OIG’s semiannual re-
ports to include specified information regarding 
ongoing audits, inspections, and evaluations. 
Mr. Speaker, the importance of this bill can-
not be understated. Inspectors General are in-
credibly important in the justice process, and 
especially so when Homeland Security is 
under review. 
The Department of Homeland Security has 
one of the hardest jobs of all federal agencies: 
protecting the homeland from terror. 
As a senior member of the Committee on 
Homeland Security, I am fervently committed 
to overseeing and improving the Department 
of Homeland Security and keeping America 
safe from terrorism. 
One way we do that is through enforcing ac-
countability in all the Department’s functions, 
which is the purpose of this bill. 
To underscore its importance, I want to re-
mind this body of critical reports from the Of-
fice of Inspector General in the Department of 
Homeland Security in 2018 and 2019. They 
brought to light the cruel humanitarian situa-
tion migrants were suffering through under the 
previous administration’s zero-tolerance immi-
gration policies. 
In 2018, the Office of Inspector General re-
leased a scathing report detailing the previous 
administration’s child separation policy. 
The details of the report were damning. 
Specifically, it stated that: Department of 
Homeland Security was not prepared to deal 
with the staggering repercussions of sepa-
rating children from their parents and there 
was no computer or automated system to fa-
cilitate the reunification of parents after they 
have been separated. 
The OIG determined that, despite a 72-hour 
limit on the time a child may be separated 
from their parents, many children were sepa-
rated for five days, and some as long as a 
dozen days. 
The report concluded that the government 
failed to adequately notify parents of the child 
separation policy, and the process to initiate 
reunification. 
The OIG found that government officials 
gave inconsistent information to parents arriv-
ing at the border, which had the effect of insti-
tuting confusion at these ports of entry. 
The report made special note of how the 
former 
Secretary 
of 
Homeland 
Security, 
Kristjen Nielsen signed off on the actions 
which led to the child separation policy, which 
is in stark contrast to Secretary Nielsen’s May 
15, 2018, testimony to the United States Sen-
ate. 
In another report published in 2019, the Of-
fice of Inspector General discussed the pitiful 
conditions for those being held in detention fa-
cilities along the border. 
During the Inspector General’s visits to five 
Border Patrol facilities and two ports of entry 
in the Rio Grande Valley, they reviewed com-
pliance with CBP’s Transport, Escort, Deten-
tion and Search (TEDS) standards, which gov-
ern CBP’s interaction with detained individ-
uals, and observed serious overcrowding and 
prolonged detention of unaccompanied alien 
children (UACs), families, and single adults 
that require immediate attention. 
Specifically, Border Patrol was holding 
about 8,000 detainees in custody at the time 
of our visit, with 3,400 held longer than the 72 
hours generally permitted under the TEDS 
standards. Of those 3,400 detainees, Border 
Patrol held 1,500 for more than 10 days. 
In addition to the overcrowding they ob-
served, Border Patrol’s custody data indicates 
that 826 (31 percent) of the 2,669 children at 
these facilities had been held longer than the 
72 hours generally permitted under the TEDS 
standards and the Flores Agreement. 
For example, of the 1,031 UACs held at the 
Centralized Processing Center in McAllen, TX, 
806 had already been processed and were 
awaiting transfer to HHS custody. Of the 806 
that were already processed, 165 had been in 
custody longer than a week. 
Additionally, there were more than 50 UACs 
younger than 7 years old, and some of them 
had been in custody over two weeks while 
awaiting transfer. 
In addition to holding roughly 30 percent of 
minor detainees for longer than 72 hours, sev-
eral Rio Grande Valley facilities struggled to 
meet other TEDS standards for UACs and 
families. 
For example, children at three of the five 
Border Patrol facilities the Inspector General 
visited had no access to showers, despite the 
TEDS standards requiring that ‘‘reasonable ef-
forts’’ be made to provide showers to children 
approaching 48 hours in detention. 
At these facilities, children had limited ac-
cess to a change of clothes; Border Patrol had 
few spare clothes for the children and no laun-
dry facilities. While all facilities had infant for-
mula, diapers, baby wipes, and juice and 
snacks for children, the Inspector General ob-
served that two facilities had not provided chil-
dren access to hot meals—as is required by 
the TEDS standards—until the week the In-
spector General arrived. 
Instead, the children were fed sandwiches 
and snacks for their meals. Additionally, while 
Border Patrol tried to provide the least restric-
tive setting available for children (e.g., by leav-
ing holding room doors open), the limited 
space for medical isolation resulted in some 
UACs and families being held in closed cells. 
These investigations and reports provide 
just a snapshot of the work the Office of In-
spector General under the Department of 
Homeland Security does. Time and time 
again, they have shone a much-needed light 
on affairs that are all of public interest.

REPORTING 
EFFICIENTLY 
TO 
PROPER 
OFFICIALS 
IN 
RE-
SPONSE TO TERRORISM ACT OF 
2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 1540, the Reporting Ef-
ficiently to Proper Officials in Response to Ter-
rorism Act of 2021 or the REPORT Act. 
The purpose of this bill is to provide reports 
to Congress that are jointly developed by rel-
evant federal agencies regarding incidents of 
terrorism. 
This bill requires the Department of Home-
land Security, in coordination with the Depart-
ment of Justice and the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation, whenever an incident of terrorism 
occurs in the United States, to submit to Con-
gress an unclassified report upon completion 
of the investigation by the primary U.S. gov-
ernment agency conducting the investigation 
concerning the incident. 
The report should contain: 
1. A statement of the facts of the incident 
that are known at the time of the report. 
2. Any recommendations for changes in 
practices or law, consistent with the Constitu-
tion, with particular attention to changes that 
could help prevent future incidents of ter-
rorism. 
The bipartisan bill requires the Department 
of Homeland Security, the Justice Department, 
the FBI, and/or the National Counterterrorism 
Center to work together to submit a report to 
Congress after a foreign or domestic terrorist 
attack, which must include an explanation of 
what happened, any gaps in national security, 
and recommendations for additional measures 
to improve homeland security and prevent fu-
ture terrorist attacks. 
After a terrorist attack, federal agencies will 
be required to report to Congress with infor-
mation about exactly what happened and rec-
ommendations to prevent future attacks. 
The first priority of government should be 
making sure that all Americans are safe, se-
cure, and free. 
The 9/11 attack on American soil on Sep-
tember 11, 2001 took the lives of nearly 3,000 
innocent civilians and since that day, the role 
of virtually every federal, state, and local law 
enforcement agency changed. 
The 9/11 attack remains a tragedy that de-
fines our nation’s history. But the final chapter 
will be written by those who are charged with 
keeping our nation and people safe while pre-
serving the way of life that terrorists sought to 
change. 
On January 6, 2021, during a joint session 
of Congress, a mob breached the U.S. Cap-
itol, illegally entering the complex, violent par-
ticipants, incited by the former President’s 
rhetoric, injured scores of D.C. Police and 
U.S. Capitol Police officers—killing one, while 
four civilians also died. 
The escalation in violent domestic attacks 
since the January 6 attack has been felt by 
our nation’s law enforcement officers, as well 
as others which is evidenced by the rise in 
murder and assaults across the nation. 
Today, we find ourselves in a nation where 
the terrorism landscape is more complex, it is 
imperative that we recognize and commu-
nicate the evolving and unorthodox nature of 
the terrorism threats we face today. 
This bill is the most effective way for us to 
protect our country through solid reporting and 
communicating. 
To prevent terrorist attacks and ensure effi-
ciency and effectiveness in responding to an 
attack, agencies need to coordinate with each 
other to determine what went wrong so that 
we can strengthen our counterterrorism efforts 
moving forward. 
Congress must have all available informa-
tion to make the most informed policy deci-
sions following a terrorist attack. 
The REPORT Act ensures that members of 
Congress will receive the full accounting of the 
facts, so that they can hold federal agencies 
accountable. 
Information sharing with both Congress and 
the American people, is a vital element of pre-
venting, and responding to, terrorism. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for 
H.R. 1540 because our mission has been and 
will continue to be focused on preventing and 
preparing for all issues surrounding terrorism. 
We owe a debt to those who have lost their 
lives and we must do all that we can to pre-
vent another attack on United States soil.

DHS ILLICIT CROSS-BORDER 
TUNNEL DEFENSE ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 4209, the ‘‘Department 
of Homeland Security Illicit Cross-Border Tun-
nel Defense Act.’’ 
This bill authorizes for FY2022 and FY2023 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection activities 
to identify and close tunnels criminals use to 
illegally cross our Southern Border. 
This bill also directs the Customs and Bor-
der Patrol to develop and report to Congress 
a strategic plan to improve tunnel closures. 
According to Customs and Border Patrol, 
Cross-border tunnels are dug by transnational 
criminal organizations to smuggle contraband 
into the U.S. from neighboring countries. Cur-
rent detection capabilities rely on random tips 
and the laborious collection of human intel-
ligence (HUMINT). 
When tunnels are discovered, U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement have limited ability 
to access the tunnel to arrest and prosecute 
those involved in creating and using the tun-
nel. 
The reason behind such limited ability is be-
cause Customs and Border Patrol lack the 
needed fiscal resources needed to combat 
tunnel construction and usage. This bill aims 
to ameliorate that problem. 
Mr. Speaker, after considering statements 
from Customs and Border Patrol, it is clear 
that people seeking a better life do not use il-
legal tunnels to achieve such ends. The tun-
nels are instead used by those seeking to 
wreak havoc and bring crime into our commu-
nities, with no other purpose. 
For example, upon discovery of a 183-foot- 
long subterranean tunnel in Mexicali, Baja 
California, 
near 
the 
international 
border, 
Cardell T. Morant, special agent in charge of 
HSI San Diego said, ‘‘These types of tunnels 
enable drug traffickers to conduct illicit activi-
ties virtually undetected across the U.S.–Mex-
ico border.’’ 
Morant continued, ‘‘Discovering and shutting 
down these tunnels deals a major blow to 
drug trafficking organizations because it de-
nies them the ability to smuggle drugs, weap-
ons and people across the border.’’ 
That tunnel had an entrance measuring 12 
feet by 10 feet and extended 3 feet north of 
the international border wall but had no exit on 
the U.S. side of the border, apparently cre-
ating temporary exits on an ad hoc basis. 
The Drug Trafficking Organization who de-
signed it equipped the tunnel with electricity, 
ventilation, a rail system with a cart, and an 
electric hoist. 
Mr. Speaker, these tunnels, even if they are 
only open for a short period, can allow traf-
fickers to move massive amounts of drugs, 
humans, currency, and firearms back-and-forth 
between Mexico and the United States. 
As Chair of the Crime, Terrorism, and 
Homeland Security Committee, I am com-
mitted to ensuring our internal and homeland 
security. Fighting these criminals at every turn 
is critical to achieving of that objective, and 
this bill provides the CBP additional tools for 
that purpose. 
I am therefore proud to support H.R. 4209, 
the ‘‘Department of Homeland Security Illicit 
Cross-Border Tunnel Defense Act’’ and urge 
my colleagues to as well.

Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 4476, the ‘‘Department 
of Homeland Security Trade and Economic 
Security Council Act of 2021.’’ 
This bill establishes the DHS Trade and 
Economic Security Council, which shall pro-
vide trade and economic security advice and 
recommendations to the Department of Home-
land Security (DHS). 
This includes identifying high priority risks 
and setting priorities for protecting the nation’s 
trade and economic security. 
The bill also establishes the position of As-
sistant Secretary for Trade and Economic Se-
curity within DHS’s Office of Strategy, Policy, 
and Plans. 
Mr. Speaker, the mission of the Department 
of Homeland Security is to secure the nation 
from the many threats we face. 
Those threats encompass not only threats 
abroad but also at home, and our economic 
security is integral to national security.

April 6, 2022 
Securing our economy means we will have 
safeguards in place to help prevent another 
economic disaster like the one brought about 
by the COVID–19 pandemic, from which 
countless Americans suffered. 
The COVID–19 pandemic and resulting eco-
nomic fallout caused significant hardship. In 
the early months of the crisis, tens of millions 
of people lost their jobs. 
While employment began to rebound within 
a few months, unemployment remained high 
throughout 2020. 
Improving employment and substantial relief 
measures helped reduce the very high levels 
of hardship seen in the summer of 2020. 
Nonetheless, considerable unmet needs re-
mained near the end of 2021, with 20 million 
households reporting having too little to eat in 
the past seven days and 10 million house-
holds behind on rent. 
In early 2022, some 3 million fewer people 
are employed than before the pandemic, 
though steady progress has been made, in-
cluding in recent months. 
Hardship in 2020 and 2021 would have 
been far worse without the extraordinary steps 
taken by the federal government, states, and 
localities to respond to the pandemic and its 
economic fallout. 
Key hardship indicators showed strong im-
provement during early 2021, aided by job 
growth and government benefits. 
Hardship rates fell especially fast thanks to 
the American Rescue Plan enacted on March 
11, 2021, which included $1,400 payments for 
most Americans as well as other assistance to 
struggling households. 
Food hardship among adults with children 
also fell after the federal government began 
issuing monthly payments of the enhanced 
and expanded Child Tax Credit, which was 
first distributed on July 15, 2021, along with 
improvements in food assistance. 
While those measures taken by the Biden 
Administration were swift and, I believe, life-
saving, much of the suffering the American 
people went through could have been miti-
gated through extensive planning. 
This bill provides those means, which drives 
my support. No more Americans should suffer 
because the federal government refused to 
plan in the case of a disaster. 
The DHS Trade and Economic Security 
Council Act of 2021 is a legislative embodi-
ment of that understanding, so I am proud to 
support it. I urge my colleagues to as well.

RESILIENT ASSISTANCE FOR MITI-
GATION FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY 
RESILIENT 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND CONSTRUCTION BY AMERI-
CANS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
MS. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 5689, the Resilient As-
sistance for Mitigation for Environmentally Re-
silient Infrastructure and Construction by 
Americans Act or the Resilient AMERICA Act. 
This bill bolsters U.S. disaster resilience and 
expands resources and strategies for hazard 
mitigation by state, local, tribal, territorial gov-
ernments, and some nonprofit organizations. 
The bill permits the redistribution of hazard 
mitigation funds that are unclaimed or unobli-
gated for use in addressing a future major dis-
aster. 
The legislation also increases from 6 per-
cent to 15 percent the estimated aggregate 
amount of grants made for national public in-
frastructure pre-disaster mitigation assistance 
so that we’re better prepared to respond to 
disasters. 
It also makes private nonprofit facilities eligi-
ble for technical and financial assistance in the 
implementation of cost-effective pre-disaster 
hazard mitigation measures. 
The overall effect would be to expand the 
use of hazard mitigation assistance to cover 
certain 
activities 
pertaining 
to 
wildfires, 
tsunamis, and ice storms. 
Additionally, the Federal Emergency Man-
agement Agency (FEMA) must set aside 10 
percent of the funds annually to update rel-
evant building codes on which consensus has 
been reached. 
FEMA must also carry out a pilot program 
through which states and localities award 
grants to individuals for retrofitting their resi-
dences with appropriate hazard mitigation 
measures. 
This legislation will build on the resilience 
initiatives contained in the recent bipartisan in-
frastructure law and provide additional tools to 
reduce risks posed by the changing climate. 
For every dollar invested in resilience and 
predisaster mitigation, the taxpayer receives 
anywhere from $3.00 to $11.00 in return. 
The Resilient AMERICA Act returns unspent 
funds from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Pro-
gram to the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF), which 
ensures that these expiring and unspent funds 
will still help our communities prepare for and 
respond to disasters. 
This bill doubles the funding stream dedi-
cated to FEMA’s Pre-Disaster Mitigation pro-
gram and extends eligibility for Pre-Disaster 
Mitigation (PDM) to include private nonprofits 
(PNPs), which ultimately will reduce the im-
pact and damage from a disaster. 
It also expands the reach of the post-dis-
aster 
Hazard 
Mitigation 
Grant 
Program 
(HMGP) to prevent utility outages in the face 
of extreme wildfire, wind, tsunami, and ice 
events. 
It additionally funds residential resilience ret-
rofit block grants to states, tribes, and terri-
tories to strengthen homes for maximum pro-
tection and safety. 
It is clear that climate change is making ex-
treme weather more intense and severe. 
The snow and ice that unleashed a cas-
cading effect of power and water outages in 
Texas and surrounding states was caused by 
a series of rare winter storms in 2021 and 
2022. 
My constituents were without potable water 
weeks after the storm, a lot of this damage 
was a direct consequence of a decades-long 
failure to maintain and upgrade our essential 
infrastructure. 
We cannot leave our constituents living in 
mold-ridden homes, in the freezing cold, 
awaiting implementation of better, large-scale 
infrastructure. 
We need our federal agencies and state 
governments to be proactive, anticipating po-
tential infrastructure failures and working 
quickly to resolve them before Americans pay 
the price of our aged infrastructure. 
This will reduce risk, save costs and encour-
age long-term planning and proactivity, rather 
than on-the-fly response to the impending 
challenges to our infrastructure. 
Storms are inevitable, but they don’t need to 
become life, threatening disasters. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for 
H.R. 5689 because we all deserve better pro-
tection from the things we know are coming.

UPHOLDING THE FOUNDING DEMO-
CRATIC 
PRINCIPLES 
OF 
THE 
NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY OR-
GANIZATION AND ESTABLISHING 
A CENTER FOR DEMOCRATIC RE-
SILIENCE 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 5, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of House Resolution 831, 
which reaffirms unequivocal support for the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as 
an alliance founded on democratic principles. 
This resolution also calls on the President to 
use the voice and vote of the United States to 
adopt a new Strategic Concept for NATO that 
is clear about its support for shared demo-
cratic values and committed to enhancing 
NATO’s capacity to strengthen democratic in-
stitutions within NATO member, partner, and 
aspirant countries. 
Finally, the resolution calls on the President 
to use the voice and vote of the United States 
to establish a Center for Democratic Resil-
ience within NATO headquarters. 
First, I would like to commend all Ukrainians 
for their outstanding courage, resilience, for-
titude, and bravery. It is truly inspiring for 
Americans, and for people around the world. 
America stands with Ukraine and the Ukrain-
ian people. 
Russia’s launch of a premeditated war 
against Ukraine is an attack on democracy 
and a grave violation of international law, glob-
al peace, and security. 
The fighting has sparked massive displace-
ment and has forced over two million Ukrain-
ians to flee their homes to neighboring states 
and has put women and girls at heightened 
risk of violence. 
Although the world hopes for peace, Rus-
sia’s invasion of Ukraine shows no signs of 
ending. Russian forces continue their bom-
bardment of Ukrainian cities, including the 
capital, Kyiv, and the southern port city of 
Mariupol. 
Additionally, as a body we must condemn 
the recent execution style killings of Ukrain-
ians in Bucha. 
It is abundantly clear that Russian soldiers 
were out to torture, rape, and kill innocent 
Ukrainian civilians. These actions amount to 
war crimes, and we must treat them as such. 
Therefore, along with the President I believe 
we must hold Russian authorities and Presi-
dent Putin accountable before the International 
Criminal Court via a War Crimes trial. 
This will bring the justice so greatly de-
served to those families who lost their moth-
ers, fathers, sons, and daughters to savagery. 
I additionally believe that this is a good first 
action under NATO’s new Strategic Concept, 
which this bill seeks to redefine. 
Considering the direness of the situation in 
Ukraine, it is absolutely critical that NATO

powers continue to bind together in opposition 
to President Putin’s soulless actions. 
Adopting a new Strategic Concept and es-
tablishing a Center for Democratic Resilience 
will further display to Putin and those like him 
that the West will not back down to autocrats 
and dictators. 
I therefore am proud to support H. Res 831, 
and urge my colleagues to do the same.

IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 4738 COVID–19 
AMERICAN HISTORY PROJECT ACT 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 4738, the 
‘‘COVID–19 American History Project Act.’’ 
This bill directs the American Folklife Center 
at the Library of Congress to establish the 
COVID–19 American History Project which will 
collect and make publicly available individual 
stories and records of experiences during the 
COVID–19 pandemic in the United States. 
The bill includes a requirement to collect 
video and audio histories and testimonials of 
those who were affected by the pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, the United States will soon 
reach a grave milestone. As of 9 o’clock this 
morning, there have been 974,277 American 
deaths from COVID–19. In the coming weeks, 
we will reach 1,000,000 deaths. 
However, I believe that only focusing on that 
horrific number, though nonetheless important, 
makes us forget about who we lost. 
Therefore, with this time I would like to tell 
the stories of my fellow Houstonians who 
sadly passed because of this unprecedented 
public health crisis. 
The stories I will be recounting are all cour-
tesy of Houston Public Media, of whose jour-
nalists I have been a strong supporter. 
Knowing that his daughter would be unable 
to walk at her college graduation commence-
ment due to the COVID–19 pandemic, Dr. 
Carlos Araujo-Preza threw his daughter, An-
drea Araujo, a belated graduation celebration 
with her close friends and family in late Octo-
ber. She said he really put in the effort to give 
her the best ceremony he could. 
Dr. Araujo-Preza always went out of his way 
to make sure his daughter and her brother 
were taken care of, despite a busy work 
schedule at Tomball Regional Hospital. The 
siblings and their father spent their weekends 
together binge-watching movies and TV shows 
together. 
But in 2020, Andrea Araujo was forced to 
spend her 23rd birthday without her father. 
Araujo-Preza was two weeks away from re-
ceiving his first round of the COVID–19 vac-
cine before he passed away. He died Nov. 30, 
2020, at the age of 51. 
He knew at a young age he was meant to 
pursue a career in the medical field. Coming 
from a family of doctors himself, Araujo-Preza 
was viewed as a loving caregiver and some-
one his patients could always rely on. 
Araujo-Preza was the leading doctor at his 
hospital who specialized in plasma research, 
while also distributing COVID–19 vaccines to 
nurses. 
‘‘His colleagues were fans of him,’’ she said. 
‘‘They loved when he came into work.’’ 
He would go out of his way to give his per-
sonal phone number to patients and would ac-
commodate their needs at any time of day. 
Araujo said her father would wake up as early 
as 3 a.m. to go into work. Araujo-Preza would 
sleep in the hospital for days and sometimes 
weeks at a time to always be on call for his 
patients. 
Now, Araujo said she tries to live by a say-
ing her father used to share in Spanish: ‘‘The 
sun always rises the next day.’’ Araujo-Preza 
would tell his children to not let daily chal-
lenges in life hold them back. Because, he 
said, as life goes on, you should too. 
‘‘I feel like people always say, ‘with time, 
things get better’, but I’ve noticed it’s quite the 
opposite,’’ she said. ‘‘Every day gets harder.’’ 
That 
story 
was 
courtesy 
of 
Emily 
Jaroszewski at Houston Public Media. 
The next story is one that is especially close 
to my heart: Dick Cigler from the University of 
Houston. 
Those who were mentored by Dick Cigler 
would tell you he left a lasting impression as 
one of the most influential staff members at 
the Daily Cougar—a highly regarded cham-
pion of free speech at the University of Hous-
ton’s newspaper. 
‘‘He taught us about the importance of jour-
nalism,’’ said Tanya Eiserer, an Emmy-award 
winning reporter for WFAA in Dallas and 
former Daily Cougar student editor. ‘‘He really 
taught us the importance of doing the right 
thing, doing it for the right reasons, and stand-
ing up for the underdog.’’ 
Nowhere was that more evident than when, 
in the 1990s, a group of UH journalists wrote 
a series of articles challenging the decreased 
university budget for UH downtown students 
and the increased budget for subsidiary cam-
puses. 
Dick allowed the students to voice their con-
cerns brazenly. 
‘‘He didn’t try to, you know, tell us to back 
down,’’ Eiserer said. ‘‘He ran interference, and 
they knew that we were an independent news 
operation.’’ 
Eiserer remembers Cigler as being a listen-
ing ear and a guiding mentor when she trans-
ferred from Baylor University to UH. She re-
garded him as one of the people who helped 
her become the reporter she is today. 
‘‘I learned how to be a journalist at the Daily 
Cougar,’’ said Eiserer. ‘‘I would not give that 
time back for all the money in the world.’’ 
Cigler worked as Director of UH’s Student 
Publications department, now known as the 
Center for Student Media, for 23 years until 
his retirement in 2010. 
His impact on the Daily Cougar can be felt 
to this day. 
Cigler died on Jan. 24, 2021, at the age of 
79. He leaves behind his two daughters Kerri 
Runge and Michelle Cigler. 
That story was courtesy of Myrakel Baker at 
Houston Public Media. 
The last individual I want to mention is 
someone who is a local hero but should be a 
national one. That person was John Bland. 
More than 60 years ago, a group of Texas 
Southern University students took seats at the 
lunch counter at Weingarten’s Supermarket at 
4110 Almeda Road, knowing they wouldn’t be 
served. 
It was Houston’s first sit-in, and that spring, 
Black college students in cities across the 
country forced the beginning of an end to ra-
cial segregation—at lunch counters, depart-
ment stores, and city halls. 
One of the TSU students at the sit-in was 
John Bland, a 20-year-old who spent the rest 
of his life working to advance civil rights and 
equal opportunity. 
Bland worked as a bus operator at 
HouTran, now called Metro, and he spent 
more than 50 years organizing with the Trans-
port Workers Union. He served as a vice 
president of the Texas State AFL-CIO, a presi-
dent of the Houston chapter of the Coalition of 
Black Trade Unionists, a precinct judge, and a 
member of the Houston Police Department 
Citizen Review Committee. 
‘‘When workers would doubt their ability to 
beat the odds and make change, Mr. Bland 
would say, ‘When we fought for integration in 
the 1960s, they arrested me 27 times, jailed 
me, and fined me, but that didn’t stop us,’ ’’ 
Hany Khalil, Executive Director of the Texas 
Gulf Coast Area Labor Federation, said. 
Bland died on July 9, 2020, at the age of 
80. He leaves behind his wife, Betty Davis 
Bland, and their two daughters and grandson. 
That story was courtesy of Jen Rice at 
Houston Public Media. 
I wish I could mention every Houstonian and 
honor their lives because they all deserve it. 
They were mothers, wives, fathers, husbands, 
sons, daughters, and so much more. They will 
all be missed and are not just another num-
ber. 
It is for that reason, Madam Speaker, that I 
strongly support H.R. 4738 and urge my col-
leagues to support it as well.

HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of this body and the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary, I want to offer praise 
and a message of appreciation for a beloved 
man, who served as a member of my personal 
staff in service of the constituents of the 18th 
Congressional District of Texas, located in the 
city of Houston. 
He was a member of the baby boom gen-
eration that directly benefited from and was in-
spired by the work of President John F. Ken-
nedy, President Lyndon Banes Johnson, Mar-
tin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and many 
other leaders that worked for equality and jus-
tice for all. 
I am proud but heart-broken to later today 
participate in a tribute to his service in the 
U.S. House of Representatives, because 
Gregory Berry is an American original, my 
friend and valued member of my staff who 
died on March 15, 2022, at the age of 66 
years old. 
Gregory Alan Berry, long-time legislative 
counsel in the U.S. House of Representatives, 
died 
unexpectedly 
from 
hypertension 
on 
March 15, 2022, at his home in Gaithersburg, 
Maryland. 
Greg was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on Feb-
ruary 16, 1956, the second son of Jesse 
Frank Berry and Bonnie Allena Berry. His fa-
ther preceded him in death. He is survived by

his mother; his two sons, Michael Jeffrey 
Berry and Connor Sias Berry, and their mother 
Elva Bowden Berry; his two brothers, Jeffrey 
(Donene) and Michael Berry, his sister, Bonnie 
Berry LaMon (Andre´); two nieces, one neph-
ew, two great-nieces, one great-nephew, five 
aunts and four uncles. 
When Greg was four years old, his family 
moved to California where he attended various 
schools including Saddleback High School in 
Santa Ana. He graduated from Evergreen 
High School in Seattle after his family moved 
there the summer before his senior year. 
Greg played both baseball and football in 
high school but was best known for his copi-
ous understanding of current political events, 
his debate skills, and his ability to recite on- 
demand the famous speeches of Abraham 
Lincoln and other seminal politicians and ora-
tors. Greg graduated from the University of 
Washington with a B.A. in Business Adminis-
tration. In 1980, he obtained his J.D from Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania Law School. 
Greg began his career as a Senior Attorney- 
Advisor in the U.S. Department of Energy, Of-
fice of Hearing Appeals, where he received 
the DOE Special Achievement Award for su-
perior performance and sustained excellence 
and originality in legal analysis, research, and 
writing. 
Four years later he became a Senior Trial 
Attorney in the Office of General Counsel at 
the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 
where he received several Special Achieve-
ment and High Quality Awards as well as Cer-
tificates of Appreciation for Outstanding Per-
formance. 
Greg excelled at both these positions, but 
the call on his heart and mind since the early 
1960s had always been American politics. 
In 1989 he answered that call by matricu-
lating into the University of Michigan Political 
Science Department. He graduated in 1991 
with an M.A. in American Politics and Govern-
ment, and within two years thereafter had 
completed 
all 
coursework 
and 
qualifying 
exams in connection with a Ph.D from the 
same program. 
While still a Ph.D candidate at the University 
of Michigan, Greg accepted a position as Vis-
iting Lecturer of Political Science at the Uni-
versity of Canterbury in Christchurch, New 
Zealand. 
He taught several courses in American na-
tional government, politics, and American polit-
ical thought. 
The University of Canterbury offered him a 
full-time position and he returned to the Uni-
versity of Michigan where he taught introduc-
tory and advanced courses in American poli-
tics, government, political theory, race and pol-
itics, and political communication. 
He then taught similar courses at James 
Madison University, in Virginia, before accept-
ing a position as Legal Writing Professor at 
Howard University School of Law (HUSL), in 
Washington, D.C. 
At HUSL he taught litigation related courses, 
Legal Reasoning, Research and Writing, Ap-
pellate Advocacy, and Legal Methods. 
He was the Faculty Advisor to an award- 
winning National Moot Court Team and was 
voted ‘‘Law Professor of the Year’’ in 2003, 
and several times received the Warren S. 
Romarin Award for Excellence in Teaching 
and Service. 
In 2006, Greg ‘‘entered Congress’’ as my 
Legislative Director/Senior Policy Adviser. 
I knew then that I had found an extraor-
dinary mind to serve in my personal office and 
the Hill had a great scholar who would con-
tribute to the work of this great democracy. 
Gregory over the years, also served as Leg-
islative Counsel to Representative Barbara 
Lee (D–CA). 
At the time of his passing Greg had worked 
for nine years as my Chief Counsel and Legis-
lative Director. 
He enjoyed developing, drafting, and man-
aging legislation for the Appropriations, Judici-
ary, Foreign Affairs, Transportation & Infra-
structure, Homeland Security, Science, and 
Rules Committees. 
He negotiated with senior staff officials in 
the House leadership and standing commit-
tees, frequently on behalf of the office. 
He sat in countless meetings with Executive 
Department officials at the federal and state 
level, and often met with lobbyists and policy 
entrepreneurs to garner support for important 
legislative initiatives. 
He especially enjoyed writing statements 
and speeches for delivery in committee hear-
ings and markups; before the Rules Com-
mittee and on the House floor; in the congres-
sional district, across the nation, and abroad; 
and for print, electronic, and online media. 
In his capacity as Legislative Director, Greg 
thrived on supervising, mentoring, and training 
the junior staff of legislative assistants, cor-
respondents, and interns. 
Greg was also a kind hearted person who 
treated everyone with dignity and respect. 
His family is exceedingly grateful to Greg’s 
colleagues and friends on the Hill for sharing 
his love of public service in the United States 
House of Representatives because he was 
able to spend the last sixteen years of his life 
steeped 
in 
the 
political 
world 
which 
unrelentingly captured his imagination as a 
young boy. 
A fitting and proper means of paying tribute 
to Gregory Berry’s extraordinary life is to join 
with family, friends and co-workers to salute 
this great democracy, which he loved without 
ceasing through his years of dedicated serv-
ice. 
I ask the House to observe a moment of si-
lence in memory and thanks of Gregory Alan 
Berry, the three year old boy who visited the 
Capitol with his mother who returned to work 
in the job that gave him immense joy.
