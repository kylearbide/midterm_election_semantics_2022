THE NEED FOR WATER 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of a much-needed in-
vestment in our Nation’s infrastruc-
ture, specifically our water infrastruc-
ture. 
Let me be very clear: Our crumbling 
and outdated water infrastructure is in 
a state of emergency. It is leaving our 
most vulnerable Americans struggling 
with water access and unaffordable 
rates, including my hometown of De-
troit, Michigan. 
I want to commend President Biden 
and my colleagues for promoting the 
American Jobs Plan, a comprehensive 
Federal 
investment 
to 
repair 
and 
strengthen our infrastructure. 
This could not be more timely, as 
Federal investment in public water in-
frastructure projects have fallen from 
63 percent of our overall investment in 
1977 to just 9 percent in 2014. 
The American Jobs Plan will deliver 
the investments we need and eliminate 
all lead pipes and service lines in our 
drinking water systems. 
It is unacceptable that in the United 
States of America, schools are forced 
to put plastic bags over their drinking 
fountains because it is not safe for our 
children to drink water because there 
are elevated levels of lead. 
Too much of our existing infrastruc-
ture is jeopardized because of lead 
pipes. My home State of Michigan 
knows about this issue all too well. 
The Flint water crisis brought national 
attention to the dangers of elevated 
levels of lead in our drinking water. 
Unfortunately, 
what 
happened 
in 
Flint is happening all across this coun-
try. In my district, the same problem 
exists in the city of Detroit. About 
1,500 children under the age of 6 test 
positive for elevated levels of lead 
every year, and of those tested, about 7 
percent are diagnosed with lead poi-
soning. 
Congress cannot stand by and watch 
as Americans get sick and poisoned 
from their own drinking water. 
I always like to emphasize: Water is 
not a luxury. A pothole is an inconven-
ience, but water is a necessity to life. 
We have the opportunity to address 
this issue right now by passing the 
American Jobs Plan. It is a once-in-a- 
generation investment in our commu-
nities and families. It also includes 
provisions similar to my legislation, 
the WATER Act. My bill would fully 
fund the Drinking Water and Clean 
Water State Revolving Funds, provide 
funding for public schools to test and 
replace drinking water infrastructure, 
provide grants to replace lead service 
lines leading to our households, and 
much more to fix and strengthen our 
water infrastructure. 
Earlier this Congress, I submitted 
Community Project Funding requests 
to support water system improvements 
for two of my communities: Pontiac 
and Royal Oak Township. These com-
munities are not alone. Similar water 
system improvement projects are need-
ed across the country. With the Amer-
ican Jobs Plan, we can make that a re-
ality. 
I look forward to continuing to fight 
for access to clean, safe, and affordable 
drinking water for every American.

THE NEED FOR BROADBAND 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, this April, the House Ag-
riculture Committee hosted an impor-
tant hearing on one of America’s most 
pressing 
issues, 
broadband 
connectivity. 
For years, the digital divide has left 
many Americans unable to access reli-
able high-speed internet service, re-
sulting in lost opportunities to expand 
businesses, learn new skills, or even 
participate in daily activities. 
I see this cost and frustration every 
day. I am fortunate to live in the serv-
ice territory of a rural electric cooper-
ative which offers quality internet 
services to my home. But, just a few 
miles away, my neighbors are on the 
wrong side of the digital divide. 
I represent 14 counties in rural Penn-
sylvania, and I can tell you, it is like

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3012 
June 23, 2021 
this all across my district, with digital 
haves and have-nots just down the road 
from one another. It is a checkerboard 
of connectivity. 
In the height of the pandemic, I 
heard one too many home-schooling 
horror stories that were a result of not 
having reliable access to the internet. 
A number of families were driving to 
the nearest local library, sitting in the 
parking lot, and connecting to the pub-
lic WiFi in hopes of completing assign-
ments. 
COVID–19 laid bare the urgency of 
rural broadband, but the connectivity 
struggles in rural communities predate 
this pandemic, and they will not ease 
as we return to normal. As more of 
American life is being put online, more 
of it is being put out of reach of Ameri-
cans without high-speed internet ac-
cess, and those without are falling fur-
ther behind. 
Despite years of efforts and billions 
of dollars spent, too many commu-
nities are being left behind. 
Broadband is not just needed for our 
homes; it is desperately needed on our 
farms as well. The demands of a 21st 
century farm economy depends on reli-
able connectivity. 
The Agriculture Committee has done 
tremendous work on a bipartisan basis 
to address the digital divide, most re-
cently with the broadband provisions 
in the 2018 farm bill. Those changes re-
flected 2 years of work to develop poli-
cies and design programs which meet 
the unique challenges of rural commu-
nities. That farm bill became law with 
broad bipartisan support in both the 
House and the Senate. 
Unfortunately, those policies and 
programs are languishing. Changes and 
improvements championed by Members 
of both parties regarding eligible areas, 
long-term network viability, assistance 
for our most rural communities, pro-
gram integrity, and more, remain un-
funded and unimplemented more than 2 
years after they were signed into law. 
This is unacceptable. That is why I 
recently introduced the Broadband for 
Rural America Act. This bill is the re-
sponsible path forward to bridging the 
digital divide. It prioritizes the needs 
of rural communities and is a step in 
the right direction as we begin to re-
bound into a resurgent post-COVID 
economy. I urge my colleagues to join 
me on this critical piece of legislation. 
The one issue that unites rural Mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle is the 
need to address the digital divide. This 
critical infrastructure void has been 
exacerbated by the challenges faced by 
rural families and businesses during 
the pandemic. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
tell the story of the 2018 farm bill and 
the improvements we made and con-
tinue to fight for broadband invest-
ments so desperately needed in our 
rural communities. 
RECOGNIZING PRIDE MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Mrs. LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to stand in support of the 
LGBTQ community and to recognize 
this Pride Month. 
This month is one of reflection: re-
flection on the strides our country has 
made toward acceptance and inclusion 
and on the struggles that still exist 
today. 
From Stonewall, to the AIDS epi-
demic, to attacks on transgender youth 
across our country today, the struggle 
for equality continues. 
This month is one of recognition for 
the trailblazers of decades past and the 
advocates on the ground today who 
make this country welcoming for ev-
eryone. 
But most of all, this month is one of 
celebration. I am here to say loudly 
and clearly to all of my LGBTQ con-
stituents in Nevada’s Third District, 
you are respected and loved, and I have 
your back here in Washington. 
While we mark 6 years of marriage 
equality this week and have continued 
to reach milestones in the time since, 
we have more work to do. 
I am proud to have voted to pass the 
Equality Act out of the House, and it is 
time for the Senate to join us. 
I hope you all take time this month 
to celebrate who you are. And from the 
bottom of my heart, Happy Pride 
Month.

HONORING CHRIS OBERHEIM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Cham-
paign Police Officer Chris Oberheim of 
Monticello, Illinois, who tragically lost 
his life in the line of duty on May 19 of 
this year. 
Officer Oberheim was a 21-year vet-
eran of law enforcement. He joined the 
Champaign Police Department in 2013 
after beginning his career with the De-
catur Police Department in 2000. Dur-
ing his career, he received two medals 
of valor for selfless acts of bravery. 
In his time off duty, Chris enjoyed 
coaching softball and spending time 
with his family. He was a loving hus-
band, father, son, coach, and trusted 
friend. His four daughters were his in-
spiration. Those who knew Chris re-
member him most for his commitment 
to loving his family and serving his 
community. 
My prayers are with his wife, Amber, 
and daughters Hannah, Avery, Addison, 
and Aubree, as well as the rest of his 
family, friends, and fellow officers. 
Chris was nothing short of a hero. 
In closing, I would like to share a 
Bible verse that Chris’ family says he 
lived by: ‘‘Blessed are the peace-
makers, for they shall be called chil-
dren of God.’’ 
HONORING GRACE HERSCHELMAN 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Grace 
Herschelman of Hillsboro, Illinois, who 
passed away on May 19 at the age of 9 
after a lifelong battle with infantile 
neuroaxonal dystrophy, INAD. 
When Grace was 3 years old, she was 
diagnosed 
with 
INAD, 
a 
neurodegenerative disease that results 
in a loss of muscle strength, move-
ment, and the ability to speak. Grace 
did not let this stop her from enjoying 
many trips to the Saint Louis Zoo; 
rooting on her favorite soccer, softball, 
and basketball teams; and having a 
blast with her sister and best friend, 
Charlotte. 
Grace and her family also had a huge 
impact on awareness and fundraising 
for INAD research. Since Grace was di-
agnosed in 2014, the Herschelman fam-
ily has raised about $200,000 for the 
INAD Cure Foundation, with donors 
from all 50 States. 
Grace was an inspiration to all who 
met her, never failing to light up any 
room with her smile. 
My prayers go out to her parents, 
Kyle and Mary, her sister, Charlotte, 
and the rest of her family. 
Grace, may you rest in peace. 
CONGRATULATING MARK BUTCHER 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Mark Butcher on his retirement after 
30 years of teaching math and science 
in the Rochester school district, Lin-
coln Christian University, and Lincoln 
Land Community College. 
After working in the private sector 
for many years, Mark decided to go 
back to school to get his teaching cer-
tificate in 1991. Ever since then, he has 
taught at Rochester and also part-time 
at night at Lincoln Land where he 
would frequent my family’s McDon-
ald’s in Taylorville for a quick dinner. 
Over the past 30 years, Mark has 
taught, mentored, and given valuable 
career advice to thousands of students. 
Mark is known for his Einstein-like ap-
pearance 
and 
science 
experiments, 
which were highly educational but 
sometimes caused heartburn among 
the administration and school board 
members. He was instrumental in de-
veloping the dual credit program at 
Rochester, which has allowed hundreds 
of students to receive college credit for 
courses while still in high school. 
Mark 
received 
numerous 
awards 
throughout his career, including the 
Rochester Teacher of the Year, the 
Golden Apple Excellence in Leadership 
award, Lincoln Land’s Outstanding Ad-
junct Faculty Award, and being named 
the 
State 
Journal 
Register’s 
Top 
Teacher of the Year. 
Congratulations on your retirement, 
Mark. Enjoy your time with your wife, 
Brenda, four children, and your six 
grandchildren.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
MARVIN ALTON HYATT, SR. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of Marvin 
Alton Hyatt, Sr. 
Marvin passed away on May 7, 2021, 
and returned to the God he faithfully 
served for 87 years. 
Marvin was born in Dillon, South 
Carolina on May 12, 1933. He attended 
and graduated from the University of 
South Carolina in 1959, with a degree in 
pharmacy, and later established a 
scholarship fund within the University 
of South Carolina School of Pharmacy 
for those students choosing to enter 
the lifelong profession that he loved 
and cherished for so long. 
He founded Good Pharmacy in Rock 
Hill, South Carolina, which he operated 
for 58 years. Marvin was the face of 
Good Pharmacy, where he greeted ev-
eryone with a smile, true compassion, 
and a desire to serve the hundreds of 
customers, regardless of race, standing 
in life, or ability to pay. 
Marvin was legendary for meeting 
anyone, anywhere, at any time, and 
was genuinely concerned and inter-
ested in the well-being of his cus-
tomers. In short, when it came to cus-
tomer service, Marvin Hyatt not only 
talked the talk, but he walked the 
walk, which is rare in today’s world. 
Marvin Hyatt was active in his 
church, Woodland Methodist, for over 
60 years, where he served as treasurer 
and as a board member. His community 
service included serving as a board 
member of Guardian Fidelity bank, 
WRHI radio station; past president of 
the Sertoma Club, Rotary Club, Elks 
Lodge, and the Alexa R. Good ALS 
Foundation. 
Marvin was married to the love of his 
life, Lois Jones Hyatt, for 63 years. To-
gether, they had two children: Marvin 
Alton Hyatt, Jr., and Laura Hyatt 
Sweat, both of whom are registered 
pharmacists and are working in Good 
Pharmacy today. Marvin and Lois have 
three grandchildren: Alton, Katie Jane, 
and Tyler. 
The legacy of Marvin Alton Hyatt 
will be that of a man who served his 
God, his country, and his fellow man. 
He exemplified service above self, and 
for the 87 years that he walked on this 
Earth, his life was a true testament of 
living out his Christian faith in word 
and in deed. 
f 
O.V. LEWIS CELEBRATES 90 YEARS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and honor 
O.V. Lewis of Blairsville, Georgia, for 
his 90th birthday on June 16. 
O.V. has dedicated the majority of 
his life to Young Harris College. He 
served as an instructor of accounting 
for 48 years, and registrar for 31 years 
at Young Harris College, and retired 
with the longest tenure of any previous 
employee. 
During his time at the school, Lewis 
had an unparalleled commitment to his 
students, both inside and outside the 
classroom, that has lasted well beyond 
graduation. Those who have been influ-
enced by Lewis, such as myself, praise 
his positive impact on their education 
and career. 
Throughout his whole life, Lewis has 
been generous with his time, talent, 
and resources as he continues to devote 
his life to improving those around him. 
As a graduate of Young Harris Col-
lege, I am proud to rise today to recog-
nize O.V. Lewis’s 90th birthday and 
lifetime of mentoring and inspiring our 
future generations. 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF FRITZ NOACK 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to remember and honor the 
life of Fritz Noack, who passed away on 
June 3, 2021. 
After serving as an organ building 
apprentice in Germany, Fritz immi-
grated to the United States and found-
ed the Noack Organ Company in 1960 in 
Lawrence, Massachusetts. 
As a leading figure of the organ re-
vival movement, Fritz influenced the 
American organ building scene during 
the late 20th century. After priding 
himself on the production of first-rate 
organs for 55 years, Fritz retired in 
2015. 
Fritz directed the construction of 160 
organs during his time in the industry. 
His 
instruments 
are 
found 
across 
America, as well as Iceland and Japan. 
In fact, Fritz’s 100th organ is located at 
Wesley Monumental United Methodist 
Church in Savannah, Georgia. The 
music provided by this organ has enter-
tained the congregation of Wesley 
Monumental for many years, and I am 
certain Fritz’s legacy will continue 
through his instruments around the 
world. 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF HARRY STRACK 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and honor 
Harry Strack for his remarkable serv-
ice to our country. 
Harry was drafted into the military 
in 1968, and completed his basic train-
ing at Fort Bragg. He served in Viet-
nam from 1969 to 1970, in the 196th 
Light Infantry Brigade. 
Harry has become a recognized vet-
eran in the Sea Isle community by 
sharing his story and honoring those 
who served alongside him. Since re-
turning from Vietnam, Harry has been 
proud to honor those who made the ul-
timate sacrifice for our country. 
During the Sea Isle Memorial Day 
ceremony, Harry received a Quilt of 
Valor to recognize his selfless service 
and sacrifice. Harry’s pride in his serv-
ice and duty to honor and remember 
those who made the ultimate sacrifice 
is extraordinary, and I am honored to 
recognize him today. 
I know that everyone in Georgia’s 
First Congressional District thanks 
him for his service. 
RECOGNIZING REVEREND JAMES OWENS AS A 
PROVISIONAL ELDER 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Reverend 
James Owens’ commission as a provi-
sional elder in the South Georgia Con-
ference 
of 
the 
United 
Methodist 
Church. 
Reverend Owens has served at Wesley 
Monumental United Methodist Church 
in Savannah, Georgia, for the past 7 
years. Before moving to Savannah, 
Reverend Owens earned a bachelor of 
arts in journalism from the University 
of Georgia and a master of divinity 
from Denver Seminary and Duke Uni-
versity Divinity School. 
As a provisional elder, Reverend 
Owens will faithfully serve Wesley 
Monumental United Methodist Church 
and the Savannah community. With 
his passion to share and teach the gos-
pel, I know Reverend Owens will con-
tinue his tremendous work as a provi-
sional elder at Wesley Monumental 
United Methodist Church. 
I am proud to rise today to recognize 
Reverend Owens for his tremendous 
achievement, and I know that he will 
continue to inspire his congregation. 
f 
THE STAFF AT THE ARC OF 
SOUTH CAROLINA ARE HEROES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
South Carolina (Ms. MACE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to commend an incredible effort put 
forth in my State during the pandemic. 
The Arc of South Carolina is a non-
profit organization that advocates for 
the rights of people with intellectual 
and developmental disabilities. Their 
work is critical in South Carolina and 
South Carolina’s First Congressional 
District, and they deserve to be recog-
nized for all of their efforts. 
Like many organizations during the 
past year and a half, the Arc of South 
Carolina has struggled to acquire PPE, 
hiring staff, and coping with different 
social distancing guidelines, particu-
larly given the scope of their work. 
Margie Williamson and her team had 
to continue providing services at dis-
proportionately high costs compared to 
businesses who received State and Fed-
eral assistance. A staggering number of 
their staff fell ill to COVID–19 during 
the pandemic, but their team and their 
organization was able to provide supe-
rior support to all of these families 
with enormous needs nonetheless. 
I cannot begin to thank the staff, not 
only at the Arc of South Carolina, but 
every worker across the State every-
where who persevered. You are the he-
roes of South Carolina’s pandemic 
story. 
The Arc of South Carolina is dedi-
cated to helping families, and I wanted 
to highlight all they were able to ac-
complish during the most challenging 
of times.

ANTONIO GREENE’S ACT OF KINDNESS 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize a local Amazon driver 
named Antonio Greene, who learned 
that someone living along his route 
was undergoing chemotherapy. 
When 
Antonio 
learned 
this, 
he 
thought back to his own family. He 
lost his parents and grandmother over 
the last couple years, and occasionally 
he would buy cards and flowers for 
members of his family to offer encour-
agement and support. 
Greene, a North Charleston native, 
did the same last summer for another 
individual in South Carolina’s First 
Congressional District who had been 
immunocompromised during the pan-
demic. 
Antonio’s act of kindness has landed 
him among seven people to be recog-
nized by the JFK Foundation, and I ap-
plaud all of those individuals carrying 
out small acts of kindness during the 
pandemic. I commend Antonio and 
anyone who has risked their own 
health and safety to protect others 
during COVID–19. Those who showed 
compassion in ways like this always 
deserve this kind of recognition. 
RESTAURANTS OVERCAME UNCERTAINTY DURING 
PANDEMIC 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to bring attention to restaurants and 
the resilience of so many in this indus-
try; 
specifically, 
Vintage 
Lounge, 
Butcher & Bee, Harold’s Cabin, and 
Chasing Sage in South Carolina’s First 
Congressional District. 
These restaurants did not take any 
aid or receive any relief during the 
COVID–19 crisis. They were even closed 
during the beginning of the pandemic 
and they were unable to receive any 
restaurant relief funds as well, but 
they survived despite these challenges. 
Every restaurant owner with hopes of 
making it through the COVID–19 crisis 
had to choose a survival strategy that 
worked. I would like to bring attention 
to all four of these restaurants, which 
are now open or in the process of re-
opening post-pandemic. This is a major 
feat worth celebrating, especially since 
they faced unprecedented challenges to 
an already vulnerable industry. 
In Charleston, in South Carolina’s 
First Congressional District, our hospi-
tality and restaurant industry has been 
critically hit. These companies and 
restaurants had to prompt guests to 
wear masks, in line with city regula-
tions; and if they weren’t out by 11 
p.m., they had to go, by State order. 
But so many were determined to up-
hold the same hospitality standards 
they had in place prior to the pan-
demic. Vintage Lounge, Butcher & Bee, 
Harold’s Cabin, and Chasing Sage, 
among hundreds of other restaurants, 
are now open for business again. I com-
mend their stories of success during 
the pandemic. 
RECOGNIZING TEE YOUNG AND PRESTON WHITE 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
with great honor and pride to bring 
awareness to two constituents in South 
Carolina’s First Congressional District 
for their fantastic effort they put forth 
in our community. 
Tee Young and Preston White helped 
facilitate the First Annual Crosstown 
Basketball Tournament, which was 
held in Hampton Park this last Satur-
day, just next door to my alma mater, 
the Citadel. 
These young men arranged the tour-
nament as a way to bring the east and 
west sides of the city of Charleston to-
gether and provide a nice evening for 
the community filled with food and 
basketball. 
I cannot be more proud of Tee and 
Preston showing Charleston and South 
Carolina and all of our communities 
how we are stronger and better to-
gether 
and 
showing 
how 
strong 
Charleston is. 
God bless these young men, the State 
of South Carolina, and the United 
States of America.

PUBLIC-PRIVATE 
PARTNERSHIPS 
CAN REBUILD INFRASTRUCTURE 
EFFECTIVELY FOR LESS MONEY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. BARR) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak about the importance of our 
Nation’s infrastructure and how to re-
build our transportation system the 
right way. 
While we are hearing about the var-
ious proposals from Congress and the 
administration that would raise taxes 
or add to the deficit to spend hundreds 
of billions of dollars and even trillions 
of dollars on infrastructure, I would 
suggest that this body take a closer 
look at how frequently infrastructure 
can be built effectively without further 
burdening the taxpayer or our children 
for generations to come. 
As a member of the House Financial 
Services Committee, I hear routinely 
from the private sector, the financial 
services industry, banks, insurance 
companies, asset managers, pension 
funds, private equity firms, life insur-
ance firms, and the like that trillions 
of dollars of private capital is readily 
available to efficiently rebuild our Na-
tion’s infrastructure without under-
mining 
American 
competitiveness 
through higher taxes. 
Public-private 
partnerships 
utilize 
the best features of the public sector 
and the private sector to finance, de-
sign, build, and even operate our crit-
ical infrastructure necessary to sup-
port safe and efficient channels of com-
merce, grow our economy, and sustain 
our quality of life. 
The best example I have seen comes 
from my own State of Kentucky, where 
the small community of Brandenburg 
partnered with a contractor, The Walk-
er Company, and GRW Engineers, to 
design, build, and finance a new waste-
water treatment plant for Branden-
burg. This project had significant ur-
gency due to the announcement that 
Nucor Steel intended to build a new 
$1.7 billion steel mill on the property 
that included the site of the existing 
treatment plant. 
The P3 delivery method, authorized 
by Kentucky statutes passed in 2016, 
was utilized to cut $3.5 million in cost 
from the $8.3 million project and to 
save at least one year over the normal 
taxpayer-financed, 
design-bid-build 
process. 
Relocating this plant in a timely and 
cost-effective manner allowed Nucor 
Steel to begin construction of its facil-
ity, which soon will bring over 400 
good-paying jobs to the region. 
Mr. Speaker, whatever infrastructure 
bill emerges from this Congress, I 
would urge my colleagues to reject the 
Biden administration’s call for growth- 
destroying tax increases and instead 
look to America’s deep and liquid cap-
ital markets as the solution and use 
public-private partnerships as a signifi-
cant feature of the legislation. 
RECOGNIZING OUR NATION’S POLICE OFFICERS 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize our Nation’s police offi-
cers and honor the sacrifices that 
many brave men and women of law en-
forcement make every single day. 
We mourn for Detective James Kirk, 
Officer Martez Hughes, and Special 
Deputy Sheriff Lee Daniel Manns from 
Kentucky, as well as the hundreds of 
other law enforcement officers from 
across the country who have given 
their lives in the line of duty over the 
last year. 
Beginning in 1962, President John F. 
Kennedy signed into law a proclama-
tion designating May 15 as Peace Offi-
cers Memorial Day, and the week in 
which that date falls as National Po-
lice Week. Republicans and Democrats 
continued the tradition of honoring of-
ficers who serve and officers who died 
in the line of duty each year since. 
Sadly, Mr. Speaker, President Biden 
broke this tradition in his proclama-
tion on May 7 and politicized this 
year’s National Police Week and Peace 
Officers Memorial Day by criticizing 
police for the distrust that some Amer-
icans have of law enforcement. 
Mr. Speaker, blaming the police for 
the increase in antipolice sentiment is 
not how we honor those who swear an 
oath to uphold public trust, even 
though the officers may become tar-
gets for senseless acts of violence. 
b 1030 
According to the FBI’s Law Enforce-
ment Officers Killed and Assaulted 
database, fatal felony attacks on offi-
cers spiked 31.6 percent in early 2021. 
This comes on the heels of our Nation’s 
major cities, Chicago, New York, and 
Los Angeles, all vowing to defund their 
police departments. It is no wonder 
why these cities have tragically seen a 
devastating and dramatic increase in 
homicides and shootings in 2021. This is 
what you get when you call for 
defunding the police. 
To our brave law enforcement offi-
cers who protect and serve our commu-
nities, I stand with you, and I am 
grateful for all you do to keep us safe.

HONORING SHEILA CURRANS 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor a dedicated leader in rural 
healthcare. 
After 48 years, Sheila Currans retires 
as the CEO of Harrison Memorial Hos-
pital. Mrs. Currans’ service began as a 
high school candy striper. She served 
as a medical-surgical nurse, an ICU/ 
CCU head nurse, and supervisor of 
nursing. She led for 5 years as COO and 
then was named CEO in 2009. 
Harrison Memorial Hospital, located 
in rural Cynthiana, Kentucky, serves 
people from a seven-county region and 
is one of the few remaining inde-
pendent, 
not-for-profit 
hospitals 
in 
Kentucky. 
The people of Harrison County and 
the surrounding counties have been 
fortunate to have a great leader in Mrs. 
Currans and her passion for healthcare 
excellence, leadership experience, and 
understanding 
of 
rural 
healthcare 
needs. She will be missed, and I wish 
Sheila Currans all the best in her well- 
deserved retirement. 
f 
PRESERVE HYDE AMENDMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
West Virginia (Mr. MOONEY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MOONEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss our most fundamental 
God-given right, our right to life. 
Enshrined in our Declaration of Inde-
pendence is life, liberty, and the pur-
suit of happiness. Our government 
should reflect this commitment to life, 
but the continued practice of abortion- 
on-demand across the country runs 
contrary to this commitment. Abor-
tion deprives innocent, defenseless, un-
born babies of their right to life. 
Thankfully, there are certain legal 
protections, like the Hyde amendment, 
in place to safeguard hardworking 
Americans’ tax dollars and save lives. 
The Hyde amendment simply prevents 
the taxpayer funding of abortions. 
Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has 
saved 2.5 million lives. 
According to a Marist poll taken this 
year, the vast majority of Republicans 
and Independents, and nearly a third of 
Democrats, believe that tax dollars 
should not be used to pay for abortions. 
Since 1976, Republican and Democrat 
Members of Congress have found agree-
ment in keeping the Hyde amendment. 
President Biden himself publicly sup-
ported the Hyde amendment for dec-
ades. In a 1977 letter to constituents, 
which I have right here, Senator Biden 
wrote that voting to support the Hyde 
amendment ‘‘is the position which I 
have consistently supported.’’ 
He goes on to say: ‘‘The Senate, how-
ever, passed a broader definition of the 
circumstances under which Medicaid 
funds could be used to pay for an abor-
tion. I did not support this version.’’ 
Those are Senator Biden’s words. 
Furthermore, in 1994, in another let-
ter to a constituent at the time, Sen-
ator Biden upheld his support of Hyde 
protections, saying: ‘‘Those of us who 
are opposed to abortion should not be 
compelled to pay for them.’’ 
But 
today, 
President 
Biden 
has 
kowtowed to the radical left and has 
removed Hyde protections from his 
budget proposal. President Biden is 
turning his back on innocent life in 
their mother’s womb. 
The Hyde amendment has saved mil-
lions of lives and has stopped Ameri-
cans who are morally opposed to abor-
tion from being forced to pay for it. 
I call on President Biden to return to 
his previous position, which opposed 
the taxpayer funding of abortion, abide 
by the teaching of his own self-pro-
fessed Catholic faith, and follow the 
lead of his predecessors from both sides 
of the aisle who preserved the Hyde 
amendment in their Presidential budg-
et proposals. 
f 
HONORING KENNETH C. THAYER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. TENNEY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the incredible life 
and military career of one of New York 
State’s most decorated World War II 
veterans, U.S. Army National Guard 
veteran Private First Class Kenneth C. 
Thayer, the handsome man you see pic-
tured behind me. 
Mr. Thayer is part of a distinguished 
National Guard unit that displayed he-
roic and patriotic service in defense of 
the United States. In recognition of his 
unwavering service to our Nation, I re-
cently had the opportunity to present 
Mr. Thayer with the Presidential Unit 
Citation, one of the highest honors a 
military unit can receive. Here is the 
picture of me meeting Mr. Thayer this 
weekend. 
The Army has requested this Presi-
dential Unit Citation for the 30th In-
fantry Division since 1946. It wasn’t 
until last year, nearly 75 years later, 
that President Trump recognized this 
unit and the well-deserving group of 
men for their selfless acts of bravery 
and devotion to our country. 
Mr. Thayer was a soldier in the Na-
tional Guard’s 30th Infantry Division, a 
unit known for their exemplary con-
duct in both World War I and World 
War II. The 30th Division was formed in 
1917, soon after the United States had 
entered World War I. They fought hero-
ically in France against the German 
Army, and once the war ended, they re-
turned to their prewar status in the 
National Guard. 
Then, on September 1, 1939, Hitler in-
vaded Poland, initiating World War II. 
The 30th Division was quickly rein-
stated by 1940 and called upon to fight. 
They first saw combat on Omaha Beach 
on June 11, 1944. 
Mr. Thayer entered Active service on 
December 9, 1943, just 2 years after the 
Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. A 
Utica native, Mr. Thayer was sent to 
the 30th after recovering from an in-
jury he sustained in 1944. His division 
was nicknamed ‘‘Old Hickory’’ because 
the majority of the men were from 
Southern 
States 
closely 
associated 
with President Andrew Jackson, and 
Mr. Thayer would grow very close with 
many of them. 
The 30th would go on to become one 
of the most important forces in the 
United States’ European Theater Oper-
ations. The 30th Division was in active 
combat from June 1944 to April 1945, a 
total of 282 days. 
One of its most challenging battles 
was fought at Mortain, France. From 
August 6, 1944, to August 12, 1944, the 
30th Infantry Division was faced with 
continuous attack from German forces, 
who were attempting to break through 
Allied lines. 
Over 2,000 men in this division alone 
died while fighting to drive Germans 
from France, but the courage of this di-
vision helped turn the tide of the war 
and will be remembered for generations 
to come. 
Mr. Thayer coauthored two volumes 
titled ‘‘The Young Liberators: From 
Civilian to Soldier’’—I have the book 
here, a wonderful account—with histo-
rian Allan Foote, whose father also 
served in the 30th Infantry Division 
during World War II, Master Sergeant 
Arthur A. Foote. 
Writing about one of the artillery 
barrages 
during 
that 
period, 
Mr. 
Thayer states in his book: ‘‘I kept on 
scrambling around in a futile attempt 
to find someone, anyone I could help. 
. . . Out of 220 men, I was the only sur-
vivor. It was an absolute nightmare.’’ 
It is almost impossible to imagine 
the atrocities that these men wit-
nessed. As Americans, we remember 
the bravery and sacrifice that Mr. 
Thayer and so many of the 30th en-
dured. 
Between June 1944 and May 1945, the 
men of the United States 30th Infantry 
Division participated in every major 
Western European campaign, from Nor-
mandy to the Elbe River. Known as the 
‘‘Workhorse of the Western Front,’’ the 
30th was ranked as the top infantry di-
vision by a team of historians who 
worked under General Eisenhower. His 
chief historian, Colonel S.L.A. Mar-
shall, declared the 30th ‘‘the finest in-
fantry division in the European The-
ater of Operations.’’ 
The reputation of Old Hickory is that 
of resolute dedication and valor. They 
are viewed as heroic not only to Ameri-
cans but to those whom they saved 
overseas. 
For instance, in the Netherlands, 
where the 30th Division liberated the 
town of Maastricht, the townspeople 
created a cemetery for these lost souls. 
To this day, the community continues 
to 
place 
American 
flags 
at 
the 
gravesites every May in their memory. 
The town officials still keep in touch 
with Mr. Thayer even though he is liv-
ing in assisted living. 
For this service, Mr. Thayer has been 
awarded 
the 
Distinguished 
Service 
Cross, two Bronze Stars, and three Pur-
ple Hearts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3016 
June 23, 2021 
A man of incredible courage and per-
sonal fortitude, Mr. Thayer is a true 
hero. He served our Nation through 
tremendous strife, yet he remains hum-
ble, gracious, and incredibly sharp. 
It was an honor to meet Mr. Thayer, 
along with his coauthor, Allan Foote, 
this past weekend and present him 
with this well-deserved recognition. 
His life of courage and commitment to 
our Nation is unparalleled. It would 
have been easy for him to give up in 
the face of evil, but Mr. Thayer and the 
men of the 30th Infantry never gave up. 
They were fiercely dedicated to chang-
ing the course of the war, and they 
worked fearlessly to ensure that Amer-
ica and freedom would prevail. 
It is truly an honor to share Mr. 
Thayer’s unique story in this historic 
Chamber today. It was the opportunity 
of a lifetime to spend time with Mr. 
Thayer and hear his firsthand account 
of his experiences as a critical player 
in this major event of human history. 
At age 95, nearly 96, he is the last 
survivor of this venerable group of he-
roes. We will remember him, and we 
thank him for his great service. 
I highly recommend this wonderful 
book by this great veteran of World 
War II. 
f 
REPUBLICANS PLAN FOR REAL 
AMERICAN INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. NEHLS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, as the 
American economy struggles to re-
cover from COVID, the last thing we 
need is more wasteful spending on lib-
eral priorities. 
Inflation is higher than it has ever 
been in over a decade, and businesses 
are struggling to get workers back to 
work because of the lavish handouts 
from our Federal Government. 
What our country needs is a pure in-
vestment in American infrastructure, 
one that would put people back to 
work and increase mobility for Ameri-
cans; new roads, bridges, and pipelines 
built by Americans for Americans. 
Unfortunately, the Democrats have 
yet again decided to play politics with 
America’s future. Rather than invest-
ing heavily in new roads, pipelines, and 
bridges, Democrats are using their in-
frastructure bill as a means to push 
radical left ideas on energy, leaving 
out oil and gas workers while funding 
goes toward achieving the Green New 
Deal. 
House Republicans have introduced 
our version of real American infra-
structure. It is $460 billion versus the 
Democrats’ $1 trillion plan. It includes 
investment in roads, bridges, and tran-
sit, 
water 
infrastructure, 
and 
broadband. It will help put Americans 
back to work and build a brighter fu-
ture for America. 
That is what real American infra-
structure is about, not pushing far-left 
policies to appease the base. If the 
Democrats 
ever 
get 
serious 
about 
wanting to build out America’s infra-
structure, Republicans are ready to 
work with them.

The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Loving God, You who have been re-
vealed 
in 
Scriptures, 
proclaimed 
through countless testimonies, and 
made known through innumerable and 
profound displays of Your steadfast 
love, how humbling it is to realize that 
You, O God, have called each one of us 
to this time and to this place to have 
a role to play in the revelation of Your 
gracious plan for all of creation. 
When we are called to account for 
this hope we find in You, may we not 
be found wanting, but may we be pre-
pared and willing to give answer. 
When we are confronted by the 
counter-narratives of cynicism and bit-
terness, may our words provide witness 
to Your truth. 
When we are convinced of our self- 
sufficiency only to discover our inad-
equacy, may You be merciful to us. 
And when we stray from the calling 
to which You have called us, call us 
back that we may once again respond 
to Your grace and follow You. 
Today may our words be as if they 
were Your own and our service be for-
tified with the strength that You alone 
provide, that You would be glorified in 
the living of our lives. 
It is in Your sovereign name we pray. 
Amen.

NATION-BUILDING HERE AT HOME 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Innovation Centers Acceleration Act, 
introduced by my friend and colleague, 
JOE MORELLE. 
This bill creates an $80 billion na-
tional competition that could direct 
new resources for communities like 
Rochester, Buffalo, and western New 
York to foster innovation and create 
new jobs and opportunities. 
I am also a cosponsor of the Endless 
Frontiers Act, a version which passed 
the Senate with the support of our Sen-
ators, that would create similar oppor-
tunities and competition. 
For too long, Congress has lacked the 
vision to nation-build here at home. 
Now we can enact a plan to compete 
with China and foster new opportunity 
and growth. 
Groups like the Northland Workforce 
Training Center, the M&T Bank’s tech-
nology hub, and the Thomas Beecher 
Innovation Center are leading the way 
in creating tech ecosystems in my re-
gion. 
Enacting this bill could help propel 
these entities to achieve their full po-
tential for the benefit of the entire 
community that could last for genera-
tions. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
f 
PROTECTING THE HYDE 
AMENDMENT 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, one of the most sacred Amer-
ican values is the right to life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness. 
The right to life is not to be for-
saken, and today we see Democrats re-
ject the science of life and the fact that 
life begins at conception. 
One of the longstanding acts of bipar-
tisanship is the Hyde amendment, with 
one of its most vocal supporters being 
then-Senator Joe Biden. Since first en-
acted in 1976, it has saved over 2.4 mil-
lion innocent lives. 
Americans who hold their pro-life 
convictions should not be forced to 
front the bill for abortion services and 
violate their belief that life is worthy 
of protecting. 
President Biden’s recent budget pro-
posal excludes this lifesaving amend-
ment after 40 years of being included. 
This should not be controversial.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3017 
June 23, 2021 
I will continue to fight to uphold the 
Hyde amendment and make sure not 
one dollar of taxpayer dollars goes to 
destroy the life of an unborn child. 
These children are the future of our 
country. 
Life is too sacred, and we must re-
spect the millions of Americans who 
believe everyone has a right to life. 
In God we trust. 
f 
HELP IS ON THE WAY 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, 
many families across the country have 
felt the crushing economic burden of 
the pandemic, but additional help is on 
the way. 
The American Rescue Plan is deliv-
ering on President Biden’s promise to 
help working families make ends meet. 
This once-in-a-generation investment 
includes an expanded child tax credit, 
and many American families are eligi-
ble for a refund of up to $3,600 per child, 
with $300 monthly payments beginning 
on July 15. 
This direct assistance to families will 
help parents put food on the table, buy 
clothing for their children, or pay for 
other expenses while building better 
lives for their families. These tax cred-
its will also help lift millions of fami-
lies and children out of poverty, includ-
ing more than 145,000 children in my 
district of Ventura County in Cali-
fornia. 
Ending childhood poverty will help 
increase educational attainment and 
lifetime earnings, allowing for a pros-
perous future for America’s families 
and children. The expanded child tax 
credit also ensures families can keep 
more of their hard-earned money and 
keep our Nation on the path to recov-
ery. 
f 
ABORTION IS NOT HEALTHCARE 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of the Hyde amendment and 
stand to denounce President Biden’s 
budget that proposes the most radical 
pro-abortion budget in decades. 
For nearly 45 years, the Hyde amend-
ment has saved millions of lives by en-
suring no taxpayer dollars are appro-
priated to support abortion services. 
This amendment has been included in 
every single government funding bill 
with widespread support since 1976. 
Even President Biden himself voted in 
favor of the amendment for decades. 
What has changed? Who is running 
the show at the White House? 
The Democrats love to talk about the 
big lie. The biggest lie in the country 
right now is President Biden’s promise 
to be bipartisan. 
The good people of eastern North 
Carolina do not want their hard-earned 
tax dollars paying for abortions, like 
done with Planned Parenthood. We 
must put faith and family back in the 
center of our lives and promote policies 
that support our innocent unborn. 
I am a physician. Abortion is not 
healthcare. It is murder. The Constitu-
tion is clear on our right to life, and 
the Hyde amendment protects that. I 
believe the Hyde amendment should be 
included in every budget. 
f 
WHEN FAMILIES DO WELL, OUR 
NATION DOES WELL 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, with each pass-
ing week, we are seeing the tremendous 
impact of the American Rescue Plan on 
our Nation, in New York State, in New 
York City, and in my own district of 
New York 12. 
Included in the American Rescue 
Plan is the 1-year expansion of the 
child tax credit. Next month, families 
will begin to receive credits of up to 
$300 per month to help with food, to 
help with rent, to help with the cost of 
childcare. 
It is estimated that this funding will 
cut childhood poverty in half. Let me 
repeat that. It will cut childhood pov-
erty in half. In my district alone, New 
York 12, this will help 54,000 children 
and lift nearly 5,000 children out of 
poverty. 
Knowing the impact this tax credit 
will have on our families, I am asking 
all of my colleagues to join me in 
working to make it permanent. 
When families do well, our Nation 
does well. 
f 
WE DESERVE ANSWERS ON COVID– 
19’S ORIGINS 
(Mr. PFLUGER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to demand answers and call 
for all intelligence into the origins of 
the COVID–19 virus to be declassified. 
The United States should not rely on 
the World Health Organization, the 
same organization that covered for the 
Chinese Communist Party in the early 
days of the pandemic, to deliver an-
swers to the American public about the 
origins of a virus that wrecked our 
economy and tragically claimed hun-
dreds of thousands of American lives. 
In April of last year, President 
Trump and Secretary Pompeo raised 
concerns of a COVID–19 lab leak. These 
concerns were completely ignored and 
censored by social media companies 
and traditional news outlets due to 
their vitriol and hatred for the former 
President. Now Speaker PELOSI
and 
House 
Democrats 
are 
stonewalling 
House Republicans’ efforts to deliver 
answers. 
It is our responsibility to keep this 
country safe. If the CCP is indeed found 
responsible for the leak and cover-up, 
they must be held accountable for the 
needless loss of life and for our econ-
omy. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to immediately join Repub-
licans in our call for answers. The 
American people, and all those around 
the world who have lost loved ones, de-
serve answers.

CHILD TAX CREDIT BRINGS MUCH- 
NEEDED RELIEF 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, 
on Monday, I had the privilege of join-
ing my colleagues, Representatives 
BILL FOSTER and SEAN CASTEN, and 
three incredible working mothers from 
my community, to speak about the im-
portance of the expanded child tax 
credit. 
We heard from these working moms 
how the child tax credit will deliver 
much-needed relief for their families 
after an incredibly difficult year. They 
will no longer have to worry about how 
they 
will 
afford 
their 
mortgage, 
childcare, and putting food on the table 
for themselves and their kids. 
It is estimated that the expanded 
credit will cut child poverty in half, 
lifting 5,400 kids in my district out of 
poverty 
and 
benefiting 
thousands 
more. 
We must sustain this investment in 
our kids and working families by mak-
ing the child tax credit permanent to 
ensure millions of children have the re-
sources they need for a brighter future.

June 23, 2021 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, yes-
terday, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 486, 
providing for consideration of H.R. 
2062, the Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act, under a 
structured rule. It provides 1 hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority 
member of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. It self-executes a 
manager’s amendment from Chairman 
SCOTT and makes in order five amend-
ments. The rule provides for en bloc 
authority to Chairman SCOTT or his 
designee and for one motion to recom-
mit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 239, the Equal Access to 
Contraception for Veterans Act, under 
a closed rule. It provides 1 hour of de-
bate equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Veterans’ Af-
fairs and provides for one motion to re-
commit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 1443, the LGBTQ Business 
Equal Credit Enforcement and Invest-
ment Act, under a closed rule. It pro-
vides 1 hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee 
on Financial Services and provides for 
one motion to recommit. 
The rule further provides for consid-
eration of S.J. Res. 13, S.J. Res. 14, and 
S.J. Res. 15 under closed rules. It pro-
vides the Committees on Education 
and Labor, Energy and Commerce, and 
Financial Services each 1 hour of de-
bate equally divided and controlled by 
their respective chairs and ranking mi-
nority members. It also provides each 
joint resolution one motion to recom-
mit. 
Finally, the rule deems passage of H. 
Res. 485 and provides the majority 
leader or his designee the ability to en 
bloc requested rollcall votes on suspen-
sion bills considered on June 22 or 23. 
This authority lasts through June 25. 
Madam Speaker, the House is set to 
take up a number of critical bills and 
resolutions in this rule, but I would 
like to begin by saying a few words 
about H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older 
Workers Against Discrimination Act. 
Instances of age discrimination at 
the workplace, including being passed 
up for a promotion or forced to retire 
early, are far too common across the 
country. A recent survey conducted by 
AARP found that nearly two out of 
three workers 45 years and older have 
seen or experienced age discrimination 
while on the job. 
Importantly, we can expect this prob-
lem to be exacerbated in the coming 
years by the continued growth of the 
number of older workers in America, 
which is outpacing the growth of the 
overall labor force. 
Discrimination against workers is 
not only unfair and morally wrong; it 
creates a major drag on the U.S. econ-
omy. According to a recent report, the 
economy missed out on an additional 
$850 billion in GDP in 2018 all because 
older workers aged 50 years and older 
were not given the opportunity to re-
main in or re-enter the labor force, 
switch jobs, or be promoted within 
their existing company. Clearly, age 
discrimination not only harms older 
workers; it harms the country as a 
whole. 
Despite the enormity of this problem, 
the Supreme Court in 2009 made it 
much more difficult for age discrimina-
tion lawsuits to be successful. The 
Court’s ruling in Gross v. FBL Finan-
cial Services, Inc. imposed a much 
higher burden of proof on plaintiffs al-
leging discrimination than previously 
required under the Age Discrimination 
in Employment Act passed by Congress 
in 1967. 
This new standard from Gross re-
quires plaintiffs to prove that age dis-
crimination was the decisive, deter-
minative but-for cause for any adverse 
employment action taken by the em-
ployer. The new sole-factor test re-
placed decades of precedent allowing 
that employees need only show that 
their age was a key factor, potentially 
among other factors, in the employer’s 
adverse employment action. 
The 
Protecting 
Older 
Workers 
Against Discrimination Act simply re-
stores the pre-2009 evidentiary thresh-
old, allowing individuals to show a dis-
criminatory motive was merely a key 
factor for the adverse employment ac-
tion, which is consistent with the 
standard for other workplace discrimi-
nation claims based on race, religion, 
sex, or national origin. This legislation 
ensures that older workers can pursue 
their livelihoods and hold employers 
accountable for age discrimination. 
This rule also sets up consideration 
of three Congressional Review Act res-
olutions, all of which overturn harmful 
rulemaking implemented by the Trump 
administration. 
S.J. Res. 13 overturns a rule finalized 
by the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission that provides employers 
with significant unfair advantages dur-
ing the informal conciliation process, 
which allows parties to settle a charge 
of employer discrimination without 
going to court. 
S.J. Res. 14 overturns efforts by the 
Trump EPA to gut a 2016 rule finalized 
by the Obama administration, which 
placed critically important limits on 
methane emissions from the oil and gas 
industry sector. 
The last CRA resolution overturns 
the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency’s true lender rule, which 
makes it easier for predatory lenders 
to launder loans through out-of-State 
banks that are not subject to State in-
terest rate caps. Prior to this rule, the 
‘‘true lender’’ in partnerships between 
banks and nonbank financial service 
companies was whichever entity had 
the primary economic interest in the 
loan. This harmful OCC action changed 
the test for the ‘‘true lender’’ to be 
simply whichever bank is listed on the 
loan origination documents, making it 
extraordinarily easy to create a rent-a- 
bank relationship between nationally 
chartered banks and nonbanks, allow-
ing nonbanks to avoid State interest 
rate cap laws where they are actually 
doing business. 
Especially during the midst of a 
once-in-a-lifetime pandemic and eco-
nomic crisis, it is astounding that the 
Trump administration chose to focus 
on making it easier for predatory lend-
ers to take advantage of Americans in 
need. 
Finally, the House is also set to con-
sider two additional bills. The Equal 
Access to Contraception for Veterans 
Act, H.R. 239, prohibits the Department 
of Veterans Affairs from requiring co-
payments for contraception coverage, 
bringing the policy in line with the De-
partment of Defense and the private 
sector. The second bill, LGBTQ Busi-
ness Equal Credit Enforcement and In-
vestment Act, H.R. 1443, requires finan-
cial institutions to collect the sexual 
orientation and gender identity of the 
principal owners of small businesses, in 
addition to existing requirements that 
institutions collect data on sex, race, 
and ethnicity. 
Both of these bills should be non-
controversial. Although Members of 
the 
House 
Republican 
Conference 
inexplicably blocked these bills from 
passing under suspension last week, I 
am pleased that we will not further 
delay passage of this critical legisla-
tion. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this rule, the Protecting Older Workers 
Against 
Discrimination 
Act, 
three 
CRAs to overturn harmful administra-
tion actions of the previous adminis-
tration, and commonsense legislation 
to support women veterans and the 
LGBTQ business community. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Mr. 
MORELLE
for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes. I would parentheti-
cally note that it took about 30 min-
utes to read the actual rule itself, so 
this is one of the longer rules that we 
have had under consideration. 
There are six measures included in 
this rule. First is a bill that seeks to 
protect older Americans from discrimi-
nation in the workplace, protection

June 23, 2021 
which already exists. There are two 
bills that failed to pass on suspension 
last week, and three Congressional Re-
view Act resolutions. 
The legislation considered in this 
rule will revoke commonsense regula-
tions, expand the Federal Government, 
and create duplicative and unnecessary 
red tape for America’s small busi-
nesses, employees, and consumers. 
b 1230 
In 1967, Congress enacted the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act to 
protect applicants and employees over 
40 years old from discrimination on the 
basis of age in employment matters. 
This act is enforced by the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission. 
In 2009, the Supreme Court held in 
the case of Gross v. FBL Financial 
Services that the standard of proof for 
a claim under the Age Discrimination 
in Employment Act requires that age 
stand alone as the cause of the adverse 
action rather than in conjunction with 
other evidentiary factors. 
In 2013, the Supreme Court also 
ruled, in the University of Texas 
Southwestern Medical Center v. Naiel 
Nassar, that the plaintiff must prove 
that a retaliatory motive was the deci-
sive cause of an adverse employment 
action. 
H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Work-
ers Against Discrimination Act, would 
reverse the Supreme Court decisions by 
allowing mixed-motive claims in Age 
Discrimination Employment Act cases 
where age would only need to be a mo-
tivating factor for discrimination, even 
though other factors also motivated 
discrimination. In other words, the bill 
shifts the burden of proof to allow 
plaintiffs in age discrimination cases 
to demonstrate that any practice by an 
employer for which age was a moti-
vating factor is covered. Eliminating 
the decisive factor approach disregards 
two Supreme Court cases and existing 
law. 
Other provisions of H.R. 2062 prohibit 
a court from awarding damages or re-
quiring any employment activity other 
than injunctive relief, making the only 
true beneficiaries of this legislation 
members of the plaintiffs’ bar. 
The Supreme Court stated in the 
Nassar case that ‘‘lessening the causa-
tion standard could also contribute to 
the filing of frivolous claims, which 
would siphon resources from efforts by 
employers, 
administrative 
agencies, 
and courts to combat workplace har-
assment.’’ 
Republicans are committed to elimi-
nating discrimination in the work-
place; that includes for older Ameri-
cans. Discrimination of any kind is al-
ready against the law through the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act, 
the Americans with Disabilities Act, 
the Rehabilitation Act, and the Civil 
Rights Act. 
Today’s rule also contains two bills 
that were brought up on suspension 
last week but were unable to pass with 
the 
required 
two-thirds 
vote: 
The 
Equal Access to Contraception for Vet-
erans Act, and the LGBTQ Business 
Equal Credit Enforcement and Invest-
ment Act. 
The final three measures included in 
the rule utilize the Congressional Re-
view Act to overturn three Trump-era 
rules that attempted to provide com-
monsense regulations, reduce red tape, 
and to promote transparency. But in 
the zeal to repeal all things Trump, 
commonsense reduction of red tape, 
and promoting transparency may just 
be regarded as collateral damage, as 
everything associated with the former 
President must be undone in the eyes 
of House Democrats. 
First, S.J. Res. 15 nullifies a rule sub-
mitted by the Office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency relating to National 
Banks and Federal Savings Associa-
tions as Lenders. This agency rule pro-
vides clarity by determining exactly 
when a national bank or a Federal sav-
ings association is, in fact, the ‘‘true 
lender’’ when partnering with a third 
party to provide loans. 
In today’s markets, it is common for 
financial 
technology 
companies 
to 
partner with banks to meet the needs 
of 
their 
consumers. 
Unfortunately, 
Court rulings have created uncertainty 
when partnerships occur in deter-
mining who is the ‘‘true lender’’ in 
these circumstances. 
This Office of Comptroller of the Cur-
rency rule provides much-needed clar-
ity for market participants and ensures 
consumers are, in fact, adequately pro-
tected. Federal law requires ‘‘true lend-
ers’’ to comply with certain consumer 
protection laws, and clearly delin-
eating the ‘‘true lender’’ will eliminate 
this uncertainty. 
While the majority claims that this 
rule gives a green light to predatory re-
lationships by allowing a ‘‘rent-a-char-
ter’’ partnership, this could not be fur-
ther from the truth. This rule provides 
greater transparency into such prac-
tices, allowing better protections for 
consumers. With more transparency 
comes more accountability; after all, 
sunlight is the best disinfectant. 
The next resolution, S.J. Res. 13, uses 
the Congressional Review Act to nul-
lify the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission’s rule titled ‘‘Up-
date of Commission’s Conciliation Pro-
cedures.’’ Conciliation is a process by 
which two parties may resolve disputes 
informally and confidentially without 
ever having to go to court. 
The Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission rule is designed to bring 
its conciliation procedures in line with 
the Supreme Court’s decision in Mach 
Mining, LLC v. EEOC, and would up-
date these procedures for the first time 
since 1977. 
By encouraging the Equal Employ-
ment Opportunity Commission claims 
to be resolved outside of court, this 
rule ensures that disputes can be re-
solved at less expense in a more timely 
basis and ensure accountability. 
Passing S.J. Res. 13 would not pro-
mote a better workplace for employees; 
it would only encourage more litiga-
tion. And by utilizing the Congres-
sional Review Act, this resolution 
would prevent the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission from ever up-
dating 
its 
conciliation 
procedures 
without additional Congressional ac-
tion. Simply put, this resolution would 
only make it more difficult to settle 
workplace disputes. 
The final resolution in this rule is 
S.J. Res. 14, which would use the Con-
gressional Review Act to nullify the 
Environmental 
Protection 
Agency’s 
rule titled ‘‘Oil and Natural Gas Sec-
tor: Emission standards for New, Re-
constructed, and Modified Sources Re-
view.’’ Should this be signed into law, 
it would have significant ramifications 
for America’s energy industry but, in 
fact, it would have little impact on 
America’s public health or America’s 
environment. 
In 2020, the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency issued new regulations 
that right-sized New Source Perform-
ance Standards for the oil and gas in-
dustry. Despite the hyperbolic lan-
guage in the media and from interest 
groups, the Environmental Protection 
Agency found that these methane rules 
had no real impact on emissions. 
Let’s say that again, because it is so 
important: Despite the language in the 
media and from interest groups, the 
EPA found that these methane rules 
had no real impact on emissions. Si-
multaneously, barriers to entry were 
lifted and companies of all sizes were 
able to compete. This allowed America 
to regain its position as a global en-
ergy leader. 
Throughout the Trump administra-
tion, Americans benefited from histori-
cally clean air and cleaner water. 
Greenhouse gas emissions fell through-
out the Trump Presidency. The lesson 
is quite simple: Promoting innovation 
and investment in the energy sector is 
a better way to promote economic and 
environmental success. 
I am very concerned about this reso-
lution’s impact, especially in my home 
State of Texas. In recent months, 
Americans have seen sharp increases, 
sharp increases in the price of gasoline, 
sharp increases in the price of elec-
tricity. Energy costs are rising, and 
this resolution only threatens to send 
them higher. History shows us that the 
most substantive changes that can be 
made occur faster through innovation 
and not greater regulation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
the rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate very 
much the comments from my friend 
and my colleague on the Committee on 
Rules, Mr. BURGESS. 
I do want to just note that when it 
comes to discrimination, the standard 
that we use for discrimination in the 
workplace that relates to race, reli-
gion, sex or national origin, is that

those factors are a key motivating fac-
tor in an employment decision that al-
lows a claimant to come forward. That 
is what we wish to make the standard 
for age discrimination for older Ameri-
cans. 
What is being suggested by my 
friends on the other side of the aisle, 
however, are two different standards. 
In this case, when it comes to age dis-
crimination, that it needs to be the 
sole factor. Prior to the 2009 Supreme 
Court case, indeed these were on par. 
The same standards would apply, the 
same criteria that it be a key moti-
vating factor. 
And frankly, when you think about 
it, if you are an older American and 
you are being denied a promotion, you 
are being denied a pay raise, and your 
employer suggests, well, you are a lit-
tle older, and oh, by the way—and lists 
a couple other things. Well, because it 
is not the sole factor that they articu-
lated, you don’t have a cause for a 
claim. And we believe that there 
shouldn’t be two different standards 
when it comes to discrimination. If it 
is a key motivating factor, which it 
was up until the 2009 opinion, that is 
how it should stand. And we should 
make certain that the law of the land 
when it relates to employment dis-
crimination is the same, whether or 
not it is because of race, religion, sex, 
national origin, or age. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BROWNLEY). 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the rule pro-
viding consideration for my bill, the 
Equal Access to Contraception for Vet-
erans Act. 
As you know, this rule is necessary 
to bring critical veterans’ healthcare 
legislation to the floor, because last 
week House Republicans failed to sup-
port the Equal Access to Contraception 
for Veterans Act when it was consid-
ered under the suspension of the rules. 
They voted ‘‘no’’ despite the bill hav-
ing passed in the 116th Congress by 
voice vote with broad support. 
They voted ‘‘no’’ despite the fact 
that veterans’ service organizations 
overwhelmingly support the bill. 
They voted ‘‘no’’ despite the fact 
that women veterans have put their 
lives on the line for our country and 
overwhelmingly want equal access to 
healthcare. 
They voted ‘‘no’’ despite 87 percent of 
the American people supporting wom-
en’s access to contraception. 
While it is both disappointing and 
perplexing to me that anyone would 
vote to deny women veterans equal ac-
cess 
to 
healthcare—the 
same 
healthcare we give women currently 
serving in the military—I am grateful 
the Speaker and the majority leader 
have given us—all of us—a second 
chance to do what is right. I thank the 
Committee on Rules for its swift ac-
tion. 
Contraception is a medication used 
by millions of Americans for a wide 
range of conditions, and it is estimated 
that 62 percent of our Nation’s 2 mil-
lion women veterans use contracep-
tion. In addition to family planning, 
contraception is used to treat or allevi-
ate migraines, acne, endometriosis, and 
PCOS. 
In fact, the median number of contra-
ception methods used by women in the 
U.S. is three, and nearly one-third of 
women in the U.S. have used five or 
more methods over their lifetime. Con-
traception is essential to a women’s 
whole health and to her economic secu-
rity. Yet women veterans who use VA 
healthcare are not treated the same as 
women in the military or civilian 
women. 
Addressing this inequality is long 
overdue. All veterans and former serv-
icemembers 
deserve 
the 
very 
best 
healthcare without any unnecessary 
barriers. They earned it, and they de-
serve it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to demonstrate their commit-
ment to the patriotic women who make 
up 20 percent of our military and 10 
percent of our veteran communities 
and vote ‘‘yes’’ on the rule so we can 
bring the Equal Access to Contracep-
tion for Veterans back to the floor. 
Let’s do the right thing, for equality, 
health, and economic security for our 
women who bravely served our country 
for all of us to have the same. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to immediately con-
sider H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding 
for Abortion and Abortion Insurance 
Full Disclosure Act of 2021. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment into the RECORD, along 
with extraneous material, immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, this 
bill, 
introduced 
by 
Representative 
CHRIS SMITH, prohibits the use of Fed-
eral funds for abortions or for health 
coverage that includes abortions. 
The Hyde Amendment first passed 
Congress in 1976 to ban Federal funding 
for most abortions. President Biden’s 
fiscal year 2022 budget request omits 
this ban for the first time in over 40 
years, breaking longstanding prece-
dent. 
H.R. 18 would make the ban on Fed-
eral funding for abortions permanent, 
with exceptions for rape, incest, or if 
the mother’s life is in danger. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 31⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
SMITH), my good friend, and a true 
leader on this issue, to further explain 
the amendment. 
b 1245 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, more than 20 peer-reviewed 
studies show that more than 2.4 million 
people are alive today in the United 
States because of the Hyde amend-
ment, with about 60,000 babies spared 
death by abortion each and every year. 
Over 2.4 million girls and boys who 
would have been aborted instead sur-
vived because taxpayer funding was un-
available to effectuate their violent de-
mise. Growing numbers of Americans, 
Madam 
Speaker, 
continue 
to 
be 
shocked to learn that the methods of 
abortion include dismemberment of a 
child’s fragile body, including decapita-
tion, and that drugs like RU–486 starve 
the baby to death before he or she is 
forcibly expelled from the womb. There 
is nothing benign or compassionate 
about abortion methods. 
The multibillion-dollar abortion in-
dustry cleverly markets the sophistry 
of choice while going to extraordinary 
lengths to ignore, trivialize, and cover 
up the battered baby victim. By reason 
of their age, dependency, immaturity, 
inconvenience, 
fragility, 
and 
unwantedness, unborn children have 
been denied justice and the most funda-
mental of all human rights, the right 
to life. 
The right to life, Madam Speaker, is 
for everyone, not just the planned, the 
privileged, and the perfect. 
Ultrasound has not only been an 
amazing diagnostic tool for treating 
disease and disability before birth, it 
has also made the unborn baby more 
visible. Today, for many expectant 
moms, first baby pictures aren’t of 
their precious newborn baby, but of 
ultrasound imaging photos and videos 
chronicling the amazing miracle of 
their child’s journey before birth. 
Madam Speaker, 166 Members of Con-
gress have cosponsored my bill, H.R. 18, 
the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion 
Act, to make the Hyde amendment and 
other current abortion funding prohibi-
tions permanent. 
According to public opinion polls, 
most Americans, by a decisive margin 
of 58 percent to 38 percent in a recent 
Marist 
Poll, 
agree 
that 
taxpayers 
should not, I say again, should not be 
compelled against their conscience to 
fund abortion. 
Years ago, then-Senator Joe Biden 
wrote to constituents explaining his 
support for the Hyde amendment and 
said it would ‘‘protect both the woman 
and her unborn child.’’ 
He said in another letter, ‘‘I have 
consistently—on no fewer than 50 occa-
sions—voted against Federal funding of 
abortions. Those who are opposed to 
abortion should not be compelled to 
pay for them.’’ 
So says Joe Biden in the past. 
I wholeheartedly agree. Those of us 
opposed to abortion should not be com-
pelled or forced to pay for them. 
Madam Speaker, someday future gen-
erations of Americans will look back 
and wonder how and why such a seem-
ingly smart, enlightened, and compas-
sionate society could have enabled and 
facilitated the extermination of over 
62.5 million children, a number of child

deaths that equates with the entire 
population of Italy. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. So with 
deep respect for my colleagues, I be-
lieve unborn children need the Presi-
dent of the United States and Members 
of Congress on both sides of the aisle to 
be their friends and advocates, not 
powerful adversaries. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to just talk 
for a moment about H.R. 239, the Equal 
Access to Contraception for Veterans 
Act, which is actually before us today. 
Although some might want to make 
this debate about other issues, it is 
not. 
Comprehensive 
healthcare 
for 
women, including access to contracep-
tion, is critically important. Access to 
contraception is an economic issue. It 
helps people stay in the workforce, 
earn wages, support stronger families. 
It has even been shown to lift women 
out of poverty. 
Even relatively small copays have 
been found to be a barrier to accessing 
contraception. Costs associated with 
contraception result in women fore-
going it completely, choosing less ef-
fective methods, or using it inconsist-
ently. 
Congress eliminated copays for con-
traception as part of the Affordable 
Care Act. And, as I said, for members 
of the Defense Department, for people 
in military service, there is no copay. 
It is time we did the same for those 
brave women who entered armed serv-
ices and now are veterans. 
We also want to make sure that we 
have equal access. Women represent 
the fastest growing subpopulation of 
veterans in the Nation, yet they lack 
access 
to 
the 
basic 
preventative 
healthcare needs like contraception. 
So I want to make sure that we focus 
on what is before us, the bills before 
the House, what this conversation is 
about, and not to be distracted by 
things not before us and part of an ex-
treme agenda. 
This is a simple issue. It has passed 
by voice vote in the last Congress, and 
it is not clear to me what has changed. 
This is an important issue for women 
all across America, and we owe that to 
our veterans to make sure that they 
don’t have additional barriers to con-
traception that no one else in Amer-
ican has. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Louisiana (Ms. LETLOW), one of 
our newest Members, to speak again on 
defeating the previous question and 
considering the amendment. 
Ms. LETLOW. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to oppose the previous question so that 
we can amend the rule to allow the 
consideration of H.R. 18, the No Tax-
payer Funding for Abortion Act. 
This critical bill will finally codify 
the Hyde amendment and uphold the 
longstanding 
bipartisan 
agreement 
that prevents taxpayer dollars from 
funding abortions. 
While Republicans and Democrats 
have engaged in heated debates over 
abortion in the past 40 years, we were 
always able to agree on the simple 
principle that public funding should 
not be used for abortions. The Hyde 
amendment, which explicitly spelled 
this policy out, has been included in 
every single appropriations bill since 
1976, including those passed under the 
Clinton and Obama administrations. 
This commonsense, lifesaving amend-
ment has been supported by many 
Members of this body, including many 
of my colleagues across the aisle. It is 
incredibly disappointing to see that 
this administration and the Demo-
cratic majority have decided to ignore 
four decades of consensus and instead 
embrace a controversial new policy op-
posed by over 60 percent of Americans. 
As both a Christian and a mother, I 
deeply understand the preciousness of 
an innocent child’s life. When I arrived 
in Congress a few months ago, one of 
my first actions was to sign on to H.R. 
18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abor-
tion Act. But whether you are a strong 
pro-life advocate like me, or hold an 
opposing view, we should all be able to 
get behind this bill. 
Taxpayer dollars should not be used 
to fund abortions. It is a simple, com-
monsense measure that should have as 
much bipartisan support this year as it 
has in the past. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), the ranking 
member of our Rules Committee. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the previous 
question, and I fully support the imme-
diate consideration of H.R. 18, the No 
Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and 
Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act 
of 2021. 
The bill would codify protections for 
the unborn and would make them per-
manent. These protections are com-
monly carried as part of the Hyde 
amendment, which has been carried in 
the appropriations bills produced by 
the Labor, Health and Human Services, 
and Education, and Related Agencies 
Subcommittee 
of 
Appropriations, 
where I am the ranking member, for 
the past 45 years. 
There is no cause greater for any 
Member of Congress than defending 
life, especially amongst the most vul-
nerable. When I was privileged to be 
chair of the subcommittee, every one 
of 
the 
annual 
appropriations 
bills 
passed out of the subcommittee carried 
this important protection. 
Yet the majority has once again 
begun the misguided assault on life; 
first, with President Biden’s revocation 
of the Mexico City policy, followed by 
legislative efforts to dismantle the 
Hyde amendment, both of which pro-
tect life and prevent taxpayer-funded 
abortions. 
Since the Hyde amendment was first 
enacted in 1976, it is estimated that 
this provision has saved more than two 
million lives. It has been supported by 
lawmakers of both parties on both 
sides of the aisle, and signed into law 
by Presidents of both parties every sin-
gle year since then. Indeed, every 
Democratic Member, other than fresh-
men, has voted for legislation con-
taining the Hyde Amendment. 
When he was serving in the United 
States Senate, President Biden, at that 
time, expressed his support for the in-
clusion of this provision, a stance he 
has since abandoned. Eliminating this 
provision in the annual appropriations 
bills would be a terrible mistake and at 
odds with the beliefs of a strong major-
ity of the American people. 
A recent Marist Poll found that 58 
percent of Americans oppose the tax-
payer funding for abortion, while only 
38 percent support it. Hyde protects the 
conscience rights of the great majority 
of Americans who are opposed to pub-
licly funded abortions for religious, 
moral, or fiscal reasons. It allows 
States to choose to fund elective abor-
tions or not with State taxpayer dol-
lars, and the people of 34 States have 
voluntarily chosen not to do so. 
As we look ahead to the annual ap-
propriations process, I would remind 
my friends on the other side of the 
aisle that 200 Republicans, including 
every single Republican member of the 
Appropriations Committee, signed a 
letter to congressional leadership stat-
ing that they would oppose any spend-
ing bill that did not include Hyde pro-
tections. 
I see no better way for us to continue 
to celebrate life and ensure protections 
for the unborn than by making the 
Hyde amendment permanent, which we 
can do if we pass H.R. 18 into law. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK) on the 
motion against the previous question. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to urge immediate consider-
ation of H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer 
Funding for Abortion and Abortion In-
surance Full Disclosure Act. 
Our Nation has stood unified in our 
opposition to federally funded, on-de-
mand abortion services for the past 40 
years. The Hyde amendment has acted 
as a stopgap against publicly funded 
abortion and as a safeguard for our Na-
tion’s most vulnerable, the unborn. 
Before the Hyde amendment took ef-
fect in 1980, over 300,000 American chil-
dren per year were denied their most 
basic right to life and were aborted 
using taxpayer-funded dollars. This 
fight is one that we must undertake in

Congress to protect our most funda-
mental rights and important tenets 
that make our country great. 
The Biden administration and con-
gressional Democrats seem to have for-
gotten the bipartisan support the Hyde 
amendment has received from both Re-
publican and Democrat administra-
tions in the past, as well as the over-
whelming support from the American 
public, for this important provision. 
It is a national shame for this admin-
istration and congressional Democrats 
to overlook and marginalize the right 
to life that we, as Americans, hold 
dear. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of 
happiness is not just a saying; it is a 
guiding principle by which we should 
all govern. 
Let’s come together as Americans, 
leave party lines behind, and support 
the right to life because America’s fu-
ture depends on it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to defeat the previous question 
and provide for immediate consider-
ation of H.R. 18 for the sake of Amer-
ica’s future generations. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
just note that we have in front of us 
two CRAs. We have two important 
bills: The LGBTQ Business Equal Cred-
it Enforcement and Investment Act, as 
well as the Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act of 2021. 
And we are not talking about any of 
those. So I am prepared to talk about 
those, which are actually before the 
House, whenever my friends choose to. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Mrs. FISCHBACH), a 
valuable member of the Rules Com-
mittee, to speak against the previous 
question. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
in 1994, then-Senator Joe Biden said: 
‘‘Those of us who are opposed to abor-
tion should not be compelled to pay for 
them.’’ 
Well, 
Mr. 
President, 
I 
certainly 
agree. 
For more than four decades, the Hyde 
amendment has ensured the American 
people are not forced to fund abortion 
on-demand, a procedure at great odds 
with so many of our personal and reli-
gious beliefs, and an injustice that 
leaves an irreversible mark on so many 
lives. 
Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has 
had bipartisan support from Congress, 
has been signed into law by both Re-
publican and Democrat Presidents, and 
has been supported by the majority of 
the American people. 
b 1300 
It has saved the lives of millions. But 
President Biden and the Democrats 
want to end those protections, forcing 
the American people to fund a proce-
dure that is at such serious odds with 
our personal, religious, and moral be-
liefs. 
There is no more vulnerable person 
than a child in the womb. Do they not 
deserve our care and our protection? 
Does that life not also have value, just 
like the lives of you and me, Mr. 
Speaker? 
Mr. Speaker, I will say it again: We 
are treading in dangerous territory. In-
stead of working toward a government 
that builds all people up for the com-
mon good, we are choosing to subsidize 
the deaths of unborn babies. 
I believe that is appalling, and I urge 
my colleagues to reconsider their posi-
tions. We must pass H.R. 18 and respect 
the wishes of the American people: Tax 
dollars should not be used to fund abor-
tions. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge ‘‘no’’ on the pre-
vious question. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire as to how much time remains. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MFUME). The gentleman from Texas 
has 71⁄2 minutes remaining. The gen-
tleman from New York has 151⁄2 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further speakers. I am prepared to 
close if that is in accordance with the 
wishes of the majority, so I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, the bills in this lengthy 
rule will not achieve the benefits for 
the American people that are being 
claimed. 
The 
Protecting 
Older 
Workers 
Against Discrimination Act lowers the 
threshold for age discrimination cases 
in the workplace. It is already illegal 
to discriminate against an employee 
because of age. Lowering the burden of 
proof to allow for mixed-motive claims 
will, in fact, only benefit the trial law-
yers who actually bring the suits. 
I do want to direct attention to a let-
ter that most Members received from 
the United States Chamber of Com-
merce. It is a very good letter opposing 
S.J. Res. 15. This is the Congressional 
Review Act repeal of the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency’s rule on 
national banks and Federal savings as-
sociations and lenders. 
The reason I bring this up is because 
I know many of my friends on the 
other side of the aisle do claim that 
their support from the United States 
Chamber of Commerce is what makes 
them 
bipartisan 
and, 
hence, 
they 
should be reelected. But here we have 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sending 
each of us a letter talking about how 
damaging excluding that rule from the 
Office of the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency would be. 
If I may just read a portion of this 
letter: ‘‘Partnerships between banks 
and third parties have become a crit-
ical avenue for making credit available 
to both consumers and small busi-
nesses. . . . Fintech partnerships pro-
vided funding for many of America’s 
smallest businesses which, according to 
McKinsey & Company, are dispropor-
tionately minority-owned.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, by undoing this Trump- 
era rule, you are, in fact, going to be 
hurting some of the smallest busi-
nesses in the country, and I don’t think 
that is what you would have intended. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the letter from the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce. 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Washington, DC, June 18, 2021. 
TO THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES: The U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce strongly supports the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) rule on 
‘‘National Banks and Federal Savings Asso-
ciations as Lenders,’’ also known as the 
‘‘True Lender’’ Rule, and strongly opposes 
S.J.Res. 15, which would effectively overturn 
it. 
The True Lender Rule provides important 
legal certainty for national banks and fed-
eral savings associations regarding loans 
they may issue in conjunction with third- 
parties. Various judicial rulings have created 
legal uncertainty as to who is the ‘‘True 
Lender’’ of a loan when a bank works with a 
third party, thus calling into question the 
laws that apply to these loans. This legal un-
certainty discourages financial institutions 
from partnering to provide credit to con-
sumers and small businesses. 
Partnerships between banks and third par-
ties have become a critical avenue for mak-
ing credit available to both consumers and 
small businesses. In fact, FinTech partner-
ships represented 15% of Paycheck Protec-
tion Program (PPP) loans to small busi-
nesses last year. More importantly, the me-
dian value of FinTech partnership-enabled 
PPP loans was $15,000. That median value 
amount was the smallest of all lending pro-
viders including Minority Development In-
stitutions 
and 
Nonprofits. 
That 
means 
FinTech partnerships provided funding for 
many 
of 
America’s 
smallest 
businesses 
which, according to McKinsey & Company, 
are disproportionately minority-owned. 
The OCC’s rule establishes a clear test for 
determining the ‘‘True Lender’’ when a bank 
makes a loan, which clarifies what legal 
frameworks are applicable to a loan. The 
rule provides that a bank is the ‘‘True Lend-
er’’ when it, as of the date of origination, (1) 
is named as the lender in the loan agreement 
or (2) funds the loan. This clarification is 
critical for banks to partner with third par-
ties and does not undermine the myriad con-
sumer protection laws enforced by state and 
federal regulators. 
The Chamber opposes S.J.Res. 15. 
Sincerely. 
NEIL L. BRADLEY. 
Mr. BURGESS. The Congressional 
Review Act is a legitimate tool to re-
view executive actions, but it should 
not be used as a political tool to over-
turn a previous administration’s ac-
tions simply because, Mr. Speaker, you 
don’t like the previous occupant of the 
White House. 
The CRAs in this rule are not based 
on sound policymaking. They are in-
stead being used as an attempt to score 
political points by undoing Trump-era 
policies. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow Mem-
bers to reconsider these measures by 
simply focusing on the policy and not 
the policymaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I have no other conclu-
sion than to urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the 
previous question, a ‘‘no’’ vote on the 
rule, and a ‘‘no’’ vote on the underlying 
measures. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3024 
June 23, 2021 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I do want to thank the 
gentleman, Dr. BURGESS, a colleague 
and friend on the Rules Committee. I 
always appreciate hearing from him. 
I think there are compelling issues 
here in this rule and the reasons that 
the House should adopt the rule. 
The 
Protecting 
Older 
Workers 
Against Discrimination Act is a crit-
ical tool for so many Americans who 
are discriminated against in the work-
place. It deserves our support. I am 
confident that it will pass the House, 
but we should remember how impor-
tant it is, not only to those workers, 
but to the U.S. economy. 
H.R. 239, the Equal Access to Contra-
ception for Veterans Act, makes sure 
that women who have served and are 
veterans have the same rights that 
every other person in America has to 
not have to pay copays in order to re-
ceive 
contraception 
from 
their 
healthcare policy. 
We also take up critical legislation 
regarding LGBTQ businesses, to make 
sure they get equal access to credit and 
equal access to investments. H.R. 1443 
would require lenders to start to gath-
er information on those businesses that 
are owned by LGBTQ individuals. 
The CRAs, in my judgment, Mr. 
Speaker, are all well-informed, and 
they do focus on the policies, policies 
which, frankly, we don’t agree with 
here in the House and which the Senate 
didn’t agree with. The Senate has 
passed these on to us in bipartisan 
fashion, so these aren’t simply ques-
tions of whether or not we approve of 
the previous President. This is about 
the policies themselves, and they have 
found themselves here to be voted on 
because our colleagues across the cor-
ridor in the Senate agree with us that 
these rules ought to be overturned 
using the CRA process. 
This is an important rule. It affects 
millions of Americans in so many 
ways. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. BURGESS is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 486 
At the end of the resolution, add the 
following: 
SEC. 12. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
18) to prohibit taxpayer funded abortions. All 
points of order against consideration of the 
bill are waived. The bill shall be considered 
as read. All points of order against provi-
sions in the bill are waived. The previous 
question shall be considered as ordered on 
the bill and on any amendment thereto to 
final passage without intervening motion ex-
cept: (1) one hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and ranking mi-
nority member of the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recom-
mit. 
SEC. 13. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 18. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
f

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

clines to enter into such an agreement, an-
other appropriate entity) under which NAM, 
or such other appropriate entity, agrees to 
conduct a study on the following: 
(1) The uniform screening panel review and 
recommendation processes to identify fac-
tors that impact decisions to add new condi-
tions to the uniform screening panel, to de-
scribe challenges posed by newly nominated 
conditions, including low-incidence diseases, 
late onset variants, and new treatments 
without long-term efficacy data. 
(2) The barriers that preclude States from 
adding new uniform screening panel condi-
tions to their State screening panels with 
recommendations on resources needed to 
help States implement uniform screening 
panel recommendations. 
(3) The current state of federally and pri-
vately funded newborn screening research 
with recommendations for optimizing the ca-
pacity of this research, including piloting 
multiple prospective conditions at once and 
addressing rare disease questions. 
(4) New and emerging technologies that 
would permit screening for new categories of 
disorders, or would make current screening 
more effective, more efficient, or less expen-
sive. 
(5) Technological and other infrastructure 
needs to improve timeliness of diagnosis and 
short- and long-term follow-up for infants 
identified through newborn screening and 
improve public health surveillance. 
(6) Current and future communication and 
educational needs for priority stakeholders 
and the public to promote understanding and 
knowledge of a modernized newborn screen-
ing system with an emphasis on evolving 
communication channels and messaging. 
(7) The extent to which newborn screening 
yields better data on the disease prevalence 
for screened conditions and improves long- 
term outcomes for those identified through 
newborn screening, including existing sys-
tems supporting such data collection and 
recommendations for systems that would 
allow for improved data collection. 
(8) The impact on newborn morbidity and 
mortality in States that adopt newborn 
screening tests included on the uniform 
panel. 
(b) PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER MEETING.—In the 
course of completing the study described in 
subsection (a), NAM or such other appro-
priate entity shall hold not less than one 
public meeting to obtain stakeholder input 
on the topics of such study. 
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 18 months

under subsection (a), such agreement shall 
require NAM, or such other appropriate enti-
ty, to submit to the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services and the appropriate com-
mittees of jurisdiction of Congress a report

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 2062, 
the Protecting Older Workers Against 
Discrimination Act of 2021. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2062, the Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act, which I 
reintroduced this year with our col-
league, the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS). 
For decades, the Federal Government 
has recognized the need to protect 
older workers against discrimination 
on the basis of age. Unfortunately, in 
2009, the Supreme Court severely erod-
ed protections for older workers in the 
case of Gross v. FBL Financial Serv-
ices, Inc. 
In its decision, the Court set a sig-
nificantly higher burden of proof for 
workers alleging age discrimination. 
Under this standard, workers must 
prove that age discrimination was the 
decisive cause of an employer’s action 
rather than just one of the motivating 
factors, as was the case before the 
Gross decision. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the NAACP supporting 
the bill and discussing the Gross deci-
sion. 
NAACP, 
Washington, DC, June 19, 2021. 
Re NAACP Support for H.R. 2062, the Pro-
tecting Older Workers Against Discrimi-
nation Act of 2021 (POWADA) Urges a 
‘‘Yea’ Vote on Final Passage. 
Hon. ROBERT (BOBBY) SCOTT, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE SCOTT: On behalf of 
the National Association for the Advance-
ment of Colored People (NAACP), our na-
tion’s oldest, largest and most widely recog-
nized grassroots based civil rights organiza-
tion, I thank you for your leadership and 
work for the passage of H.R. 2062, the Pro-
tecting Older Workers Against Discrimina-
tion Act of 2021 (POWADA). This bill is a 
crucial component of the NAACP’s vision for 
ensuring a society in which all individuals 
have equal rights and equal protection under 
the law as a key measure to ensure that ille-
gal workplace discrimination is ended for 
all. To that end, we are convinced that 
POWADA takes a critical steps forward to 
ensure older workers, especially those who 
are persons of color and women, are pro-
tected from age discrimination in the work-
place. 
The Supreme Court’s 2009 decision Gross v. 
FBL Financial Services, Inc., significantly re-
duced the ability for employees to challenge 
an employer’s age discriminatory employ-
ment practices in court. The decision forces 
employees to prove that age is a ‘but-for’ 
cause of an age discrimination employment 
action. Worse, some circuit courts extended 
the Gross but-for standard into other civil 
rights statutes as well. The NAACP urges 
full Congressional support for, and passage of 
POWADA, a bill that restores the ability of 
plaintiffs to challenge age and other forms of 
discrimination in court by returning the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act, the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, the Reha-
bilitation Act of 1973 and the retaliation pro-
visions of Title VII to the mixed-motive 
standard of proof used under Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act for decades. 
The importance of countering age dis-
crimination cannot be understated, espe-
cially since age discrimination often inter-
sects with other forms of discrimination 
based on race and gender. The evidence for 
this is clear: Nearly two-thirds of women and 
more than three-fourths of African American 
workers age 45 and older say they’ve seen or 
experienced age discrimination in the work-
place. Over 9 percent of African Americans 
felt pressured into early retirement because 
of their age, compared to 6.7 percent for 
other races. During the COVID–19 pandemic, 
the decline in employment for older African 
American, Hispanic, and Asian worker was 
twice that of older white workers. The abil-
ity for workers to confront age discrimina-
tion is an integral part of confronting dis-
crimination generally in our Country. 
For the preceding reasons, the NAACP 
strongly urges Congress to pass POWADA 
(H.R. 2062) and protect our nation’s older 
workers as soon as possible. 
Thank you again for your leadership and 
attention to this crucial issue of civil rights 
and equal protection under law. If you have 
any questions or other concerns with the 
NAACP’s position on this matter, please do 
not hesitate to contact me. 
Sincerely, 
HILARY O. SHELTON, 
Director,

dent for Policy and 
Advocacy. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
making cases more difficult to prove 
contradicts our responsibility to sup-
port older workers who have been vul-
nerable to workplace discrimination. 
In fact, more than half of older workers 
are pushed out of longtime jobs before 
they choose to retire. 
Age discrimination also holds back 
our economy. Research by AARP and 
the Economist Intelligence Unit found 
that, absent age discrimination, older 
workers would have contributed $850 
billion more in 2018 to the gross domes-
tic product. Clearly, our labor market 
and economy cannot fully recover from 
the pandemic if we fail to support our 
older workers. 
The 
Protecting 
Older 
Workers 
Against Discrimination Act is a bipar-
tisan initiative that would restore the 
pre-2009 evidentiary standard for age 
discrimination claims. This would ef-
fectively realign the burden of proof 
for age discrimination claims so it 
would again be the same standard that 
is required for proving discrimination 
based on sex, race, religion, and na-
tional origin. 
This legislation also reinstates this 
standard for disability discrimination 
claims under the Americans with Dis-
abilities Act and the Rehabilitation 
Act, as well as claims for retaliation 
for rights protected under the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964. These statutes have 
all been implicated by the Gross deci-
sion. 
Last Congress, 261 bipartisan House 
Members voted in favor of passing the 
Protecting Older Workers Against Dis-
crimination Act. This Congress, I hope 
we can come together again and take 
this next step to ensure that older 
workers can achieve justice. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a Statement of Administration Policy 
in support of H.R. 2062. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 
2062—PROTECTING
OLDER
WORKERS 
AGAINST
DISCRIMINATION
ACT—REP. SCOTT, 
D–VA, AND 112 COSPONSORS 
The Administration supports House pas-
sage 
of 
the 
Protecting 
Older 
Workers 
Against Discrimination Act (POWADA). The 
bipartisan legislation would restore legal 
protections for older Americans and hold em-
ployers accountable for age discrimination. 
The bill amends the Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act (ADEA), Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Rehabilita-
tion Act of 1973, to replace the ‘‘but-for’’ test 
established in Gross v. FBL Financial Serv-
ices, Inc. with the ‘‘motivating factor’’ test. 
The bill thereby aligns the burden of proof 
for age discrimination with similar stand-
ards for proving discrimination based on race 
and national origin. In addition, the bill al-
lows individuals claiming discrimination to 
rely on any type or form of admissible evi-
dence to prove an unlawful practice oc-
curred. 
Workplace discrimination prevents people 
from fully accessing the American dream 
and limits the contributions that they can 
make to our shared prosperity. Ending it is 
a priority for the Administration. The Presi-
dent supports this bipartisan legislation that 
protects workers from age discrimination. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3054 
June 23, 2021 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older 
Workers Against Discrimination Act. 
Every worker—every worker—includ-
ing older Americans should have the 
law on their side to protect them from 
workplace discrimination. The good 
news is that existing Federal statutes 
already prohibit workplace discrimina-
tion. 
Despite what Democrats might have 
you believe, Mr. Speaker, there are a 
number of laws protecting Americans 
of all ages against discrimination in 
the workplace. The Civil Rights Act of 
1964, CRA; the Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act of 1967, ADEA; the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Rehab Act; 
and the Americans with Disabilities 
Act of 1990, ADA, make employment 
discrimination based on an individual’s 
race, color, religion, sex, national ori-
gin, age, or disability unlawful. 
My Republican colleagues and I ap-
preciate the stated purpose behind H.R. 
2062. Age discrimination is wrong, but 
the bill before us today is fundamen-
tally flawed and a classic example of a 
solution in search of a problem. 
Age discrimination in the workplace 
is already illegal. Mr. Speaker, I am 
going to say that over and over and 
over today. Age discrimination in the 
workplace is already illegal. 
There is no evidence indicating this 
bill is necessary. The committee’s cur-
sory examination of the bill earlier 
this year failed to uncover any sugges-
tion that workers have been discour-
aged from filing discrimination or re-
taliation charges with the Equal Em-
ployment 
Opportunity 
Commission, 
EEOC, the primary agency that en-
forces Federal laws that make it illegal 
to discriminate. 
Over the last couple of decades, rates 
of age discrimination charges, a signed 
statement asserting employment dis-
crimination, filed with the EEOC have 
remained 
steady. 
Additionally, 
the 
available data from the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics show unemployment 
trends for older workers are heading in 
a positive direction. 
In 2018, older Americans earned 7 per-
cent more than the median for all 
workers, a large increase from 20 years 
ago. For workers age 65 and older, em-
ployment tripled from 1988 to 2018, 
while 
employment 
among 
younger 
workers grew by about one-third. Like-
wise, over the past 20 years, the num-
ber of older workers on full-time work 
schedules grew 21⁄2 times faster than 
the number working part-time. 
The legislation we are debating today 
is another sweeping one-size-fits-all 
scheme. This ill-advised bill rewards 
Democrats’ favored political friends, 
disregards real-world workplace experi-
ence, and rejects decades of Supreme 
Court precedent. 
Our 
Nation’s 
uncertain 
economic 
times demand pro-growth and pro- 
worker policies, but House Democrats 
would rather consider misguided pro-
posals such as H.R. 2062. The Pro-
tecting Older Workers Against Dis-
crimination Act stifles job creation 
and harms small businesses and aging 
workers at a time when our lan-
guishing post-pandemic economy most 
needs their contributions. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation enriches 
trial lawyers, not plaintiffs. H.R. 2062 
overturns Supreme Court precedent by 
allowing the plaintiffs to argue that 
age was only a motivating, not deci-
sive, factor that led to an employer’s 
unfavorable employment action. It al-
lows 
these 
kinds 
of 
mixed-motive 
claims across four completely different 
nondiscrimination laws. 
H.R. 2062 also allows mixed-motive 
claims where the plaintiff alleges the 
employer has taken action against a 
plaintiff because of a prior complaint 
of discrimination. Allowing mixed-mo-
tive claims in cases alleging retalia-
tion puts employers in the impossible 
position of trying to prove that a le-
gitimate employment decision was not 
in response to a prior complaint. 
The only party that will be paid in 
nearly all mixed-motive cases is the 
plaintiff’s attorneys. We know this will 
happen because, under the legislation, 
employers will be able to demonstrate 
that they would have taken the same 
action in the absence of the impermis-
sible motivating factors. 
Simply 
put, 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
older 
Americans, the very people this legis-
lation is purported to help, will in the 
vast majority of cases receive no mone-
tary damages or other redress under 
H.R. 2062. 
H.R. 2062 also increases frivolous 
legal claims against business owners. 
Job creators will spend valuable time 
and 
resources 
battling 
these 
undeserving claims, as the Supreme 
Court pointed out in the 2013 Nassar 
case. These same resources could be 
better used to prevent workplace har-
assment and discrimination. 
When H.R. 2062 was considered by the 
Education and Labor Committee, Re-
publicans offered amendments to ad-
dress fundamental flaws in H.R. 2062. 
We offered an amendment to strike 
the ill-advised and unworkable provi-
sions allowing for mixed-motive retal-
iation claims. 
We proposed collecting data and evi-
dence to understand how age discrimi-
nation and retaliation charges and law-
suits have changed because of Supreme 
Court rulings. 
We attempted to make sure the pub-
lic understands that even successful 
plaintiffs under the bill will likely not 
receive any monetary damages while 
their lawyers will be paid. 
We proposed a noncontroversial clar-
ification to maintain protections for 
workers with disabilities. 
And we tried to clarify the evi-
dentiary standard for proving a claim 
under the bill. 
b 1500 
Unfortunately, 
our 
commonsense 
amendments were defeated by Demo-
crats along party lines. 
Mr. Speaker, all workers should be 
protected from workplace discrimina-
tion, and they already are under cur-
rent law. 
H.R. 2062 is a distraction from the 
real problems plaguing our Nation, like 
the crisis at the border, over 9 million 
jobs begging for qualified workers, 
unaffordable college costs, and run-
away economic inflation. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no’’ on H.R. 2062, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), the co- 
chair of the House Democratic Caucus 
Task Force on Aging. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my leader here who has done 
such a great job to protect workers. 
We are here today to fix a terrible 
2009 
Supreme 
Court 
decision 
that 
weakened protections against age dis-
crimination under the Age Discrimina-
tion in Employment Act. 
A 2020 AARP survey found that three 
in five workers age 45—yes, age 45 and 
older—had seen or experienced age dis-
crimination in the workplace. So, there 
is absolutely evidence that this exists. 
It is real, and we need to do something 
to fix it. 
Meanwhile, Americans are working 
more and longer than they ever have. 
Workers deserve strong workplace pro-
tections throughout their entire ca-
reers, full stop. 
I am absolutely proudly and enthu-
siastically looking forward to voting 
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 2062, the Protecting 
Older Workers Against Discrimination 
Act, to ensure that older workers can 
hold employers accountable for age dis-
crimination. 
When asking workers, ‘‘Have you 
ever experienced any kind of discrimi-
nation based on age?’’ and when the an-
swer is three out of five say yes, begin-
ning at age 45, I trust that this is true. 
This was in a survey that was done by 
the AARP, which has millions of mem-
bers, that told us that. So, the current 
laws that were cited across the aisle 
are not doing the job that needs to be 
done right now to protect our older 
workers. 
Let’s pass this bill today. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Dr. FOXX for her leadership. 
Every small business has its own 
unique characteristics and challenges, 
and that is a good thing. Having diver-
sity of business structures and oper-
ations is what makes America produc-
tive and competitive. The Federal Gov-
ernment should move with caution 
when they pass legislation which puts 
every detail and decision of American 
businesses under overbearing rules and 
regulations. 
There are already laws in effect 
which prevent employers from dis-
criminating against older Americans. 
As it should be, age discrimination in 
the workplace is illegal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3055 
June 23, 2021 
I oppose H.R. 2062 because there has 
not been thoughtful deliberation with 
the real Americans involved. The pro-
ponents of this bill have not provided 
the Members of this body with data 
and evidence which shows that the reg-
ulatory changes in this bill are needed 
or even wanted. 
The legislation before us today rep-
resents big wins for the Democrats’ 
special interests—namely, trial law-
yers, not working-class America. 
Our land is the land of opportunity 
because everyone from all ages and 
walks of life has the chance to partici-
pate and prosper, and thankfully, they 
are protected by law against discrimi-
nation. Rather than successfully ad-
dressing real-world problems, this bill 
will only enrich Democrats’ political 
allies. 
I strongly urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this 
bill. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI), chair of 
the Subcommittee on Civil Rights and 
Human Services. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman SCOTT for yielding and for 
his leadership on this important legis-
lation. I rise in strong support of the 
bipartisan Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act. 
My home State of Oregon has one of 
the most rapidly aging populations in 
the country, and I have heard from 
many workers, particularly those in 
the technology industry, who believe 
they have been dismissed or denied em-
ployment because of their age. In fact, 
6 in 10 older workers say they have ex-
perienced age discrimination, and 90 
percent say that it is common. 
My office has helped older workers 
who have filed age discrimination com-
plaints before the Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, but the bur-
den of proof is very high and often re-
sults in uncertain outcomes. 
Congress recognized the need to pro-
tect older workers from pervasive age 
discrimination when it enacted the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act of 
1967. But decades later, in 2009, the Su-
preme Court, in Gross v. FBL Financial 
Services, imposed a much higher bur-
den of proof for workers to prove age 
discrimination under the ADEA. Be-
cause of the Court’s holding in Gross, 
workers now must prove that age dis-
crimination was the decisive cause for 
their employer’s adverse action rather 
than just a motivating factor in their 
employer’s adverse action. 
Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I 
joined Chairman SCOTT
in reintro-
ducing the bipartisan Protecting Older 
Workers Against Discrimination Act. 
This needed bill is a commonsense leg-
islative fix that will simply restore the 
pre-2009 standard in age discrimination 
claims and, importantly, align the bur-
den of proof with the same standards 
for proving discrimination in other 
areas, such as those based on sex, race, 
religion, and national origin. 
As we discussed during the joint Civil 
Rights 
and 
Human 
Services 
Sub-
committee and Workforce Protections 
Subcommittee 
hearing 
earlier 
this 
year, Americans are living longer and 
working longer. We must make sure 
they are protected from age discrimi-
nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the Leadership Council of 
Aging Organizations in support of the 
Protecting Older Workers Against Dis-
crimination Act. 
LEADERSHIP COUNCIL OF 
AGING ORGANIZATIONS, 
May 13, 2021. 
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: The Leader-
ship Council of Aging Organizations (LCAO) 
is a coalition of 69 national nonprofit organi-
zations concerned with the well-being of 
America’s older population and committed 
to representing their interests in the policy- 
making arena. We are writing to urge you to 
vote for passage of the Protecting Older 
Workers 
Against 
Discrimination 
Act 
(POWADA, H.R. 2062, S. 880). POWADA is bi-
partisan and bicameral legislation intro-
duced in the House by Representatives 
Bobby Scott (D–VA) and Rodney Davis (R– 
IL). In the Senate, the bill is sponsored by 
Senators Bob Casey (D–PA), Chuck Grassley 
(R–IA), Patrick Leahy (D–VT) and Susan 
Collins (R–ME). 
Age discrimination is pervasive and stub-
bornly entrenched. It often starts in the hir-
ing process when employers circumvent anti- 
age discrimination laws by using such tac-
tics as setting a maximum number of years 
of experience that a prospective employer 
will consider. Whether it starts at the hiring 
process or not, six in 10 older workers say 
they have experienced age discrimination 
and 90 percent of them say it is common. It 
is even more pervasive among older women 
and African American workers—nearly two 
thirds of women and three-fourths of African 
Americans say they have seen or experienced 
workplace discrimination. The COVID–19 
pandemic has wreaked havoc on employment 
for everyone, with older workers taking a 
harder hit. Older workers experienced a 1.1 
percent higher unemployment rate from 
April through September of 2020 than their 
mid-career counterparts (9.7 percent were 
unemployed versus 8.6 percent). The rates 
were worse for older workers who were 
black, female, or who did not have a college 
degree. 
Courts have not taken age discrimination 
as seriously as other forms of discrimination 
and older workers have fewer protections as 
a result. Over ten years ago, the Supreme 
Court decision in Gross v. FBL Financial 
Services Inc. (2009), set a higher standard of 
proof for age discrimination than previously 
applied, and much higher than for other 
forms of discrimination. Since Gross, court 
decisions have continued to chip away at 
protections. As a result plaintiffs now must 
prove that age was a determinative cause for 
their employers adverse treatment of them. 
Before the Gross cases it was enough for 
plaintiffs to prove that age was one of the 
motivating factors. 
POWADA would restore the standard of 
proof in age discrimination cases to the pre- 
2009 level and treat age discrimination as un-
just as other forms of employment discrimi-
nation. Moreover, because courts have ap-
plied Gross’ higher burden of proof to retal-
iation charges and to disability discrimina-
tion, POWADA would also amend the Age 
Discrimination in Employment Act, Title 
VIT’s provision on retaliation, the Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabili-
tation Act of 1973. 
Please vote to restore fairness for older 
workers by passing the Protecting Older 
Workers Against Discrimination Act (H.R. 
2062, S. 880).

Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
all of my colleagues to stand up for 
older workers and to support this bi-
partisan, bicameral bill. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, our colleagues on the 
other side say that workers feel they 
have been discriminated against. Well, 
we all have feelings and perceptions 
that are not accurate. I think my col-
league from Illinois pointed out that 
the data simply does not support the 
feelings of many people, and I think we 
understand that in day-to-day life. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle also contend that the 2009 Su-
preme Court decision in Gross v. FBL 
Financial Services has weakened age 
discrimination protections. They also 
contend this decision has deterred 
workers from seeking relief from age 
bias. But let’s look at the data; let’s 
not go on feelings. 
In the 11 years preceding the 2009 Su-
preme Court decision in Gross, the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission, EEOC, the primary agency 
that enforces Federal laws that make 
it illegal to discriminate, received an 
average of 18,548 charges of discrimina-
tion per year related to age discrimina-
tion. An EEOC charge is a signed state-
ment asserting employment discrimi-
nation. Now, in the 11 years following 
Gross, the EEOC received an average of 
19,783 charges per year relating to age 
discrimination, a slight increase from 
the previous 11 years. 
So, it is obvious from EEOC data 
that there is clearly no evidence work-
ers have been discouraged from filing 
age discrimination charges with the 
agency since the 2009 Supreme Court 
decision. And we had a Democrat ad-
ministration during that time and 1 
year of a Republican administration. 
We also find that age discrimination 
charges as a percentage of all charges

filed with EEOC are approximately the 
same for the 11 years before and after 
the Gross decision, 22.4 percent and 22.5 
percent, respectively. Again, this does 
not indicate workers are somehow dis-
couraged from filing age discrimina-
tion charges. 
Congress should make fact-based de-
cisions, Mr. Speaker, and in this case, 
the facts do not support feelings or the 
assertions made by the proponents of 
H.R. 2062. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Rhode Island (Mr. LANGEVIN). 
Mr. 
LANGEVIN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Today, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Work-
ers Against Discrimination Act. 
Fifty-four years ago, Congress passed 
the Age Discrimination in Employment 
Act. This law prohibits workplace dis-
crimination against Americans over 
the age of 40, yet too many older Amer-
icans still face discrimination in the 
workplace. 
In 2018, the U.S. Equal Employment 
Opportunity 
Commission 
acknowl-
edged that ‘‘age discrimination re-
mains a significant and costly problem 
for workers, their families, and our 
economy.’’ This is corroborated by a 
2019 AARP survey which found that 
roughly 60 percent of older workers 
have witnessed or experienced age dis-
crimination. 
Making matters worse, a misguided 
Supreme Court ruling in 2009 set a 
precedent which now requires a plain-
tiff in an age discrimination suit to 
prove that his or her age was the only 
motivating factor in an employer’s ad-
verse actions. This is, quite frankly, 
unacceptable. 
Older Americans bring unrivaled ex-
perience and wisdom to their jobs. It is 
up to us to restore the workplace pro-
tections to what Congress intended. 
I would also like to note that age dis-
crimination affects many workers with 
disabilities. This is an added challenge 
for the disability community, which 
faces several other barriers to competi-
tive, integrated employment. 
Even more disheartening is that 
some courts have applied the same 
misguided 2009 Supreme Court standard 
of claims to disability-based employ-
ment discrimination. In doing so, these 
lower courts are undermining the key 
promise of the Americans with Disabil-
ities Act and throwing the congres-
sional intent to the wind. 
H.R. 2062 will correct that record. In 
fact, the Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act will re-
store vital employment protections to 
millions of older American workers 
and workers with disabilities. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to join me today 
in supporting its final passage. It is the 
right thing to do. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, when con-
sidering any legislation, Congress first 
should determine whether the legisla-
tion is needed and, next, whether the 
bill under consideration will provide a 
workable, feasible, and effective re-
sponse to the issue at hand. 
Proponents of H.R. 2062 claim that 
the Supreme Court’s decision in Gross, 
2009, and Nassar, 2013, have harmed 
workers who faced age discrimination 
or unlawful retaliation. Publicly avail-
able data does not show that the Su-
preme Court decisions in Gross or 
Nassar have discouraged individuals 
from filing Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission charges of discrimi-
nation, which is a signed statement as-
serting employment discrimination. 
b 1515 
Unfortunately, 
the 
one 
sub-
committee-level hearing earlier this 
year in the Committee on Education 
and Labor on H.R. 2062 also covered 
several other unrelated bills. 
At the very least, this far-reaching 
legislation deserves more than a cur-
sory examination. 
Furthermore, 
a 
Democrat-invited 
witness who testified at the hearing in 
favor of H.R. 2062 acknowledged that 
‘‘it is difficult to quantify the impact 
that the Gross decision has had on the 
number of older workers who bring 
cases and the number of those who win 
them.’’ 
The reality is that a review of EEOC 
data shows that the rate of EEOC age 
discrimination charges as a percentage 
of all charges filed is approximately 
the same for the 11 years before and 
after the Gross decision. 
In fact, there has been an uptick in 
title VII retaliation charges as a per-
centage of all charges filed in the 7 
years following the Nassar decision, 
which does not indicate individuals 
have been discouraged from filing these 
charges. 
Court decisions show that plaintiffs 
have continued to win age discrimina-
tion and title VII retaliation cases in 
the wake of the Supreme Court’s deci-
sions in Gross and Nassar. 
Like other Democrat-sponsored legis-
lation in the 117th Congress, H.R. 2062 
has been rushed through the com-
mittee without necessary examination, 
discussion, or consideration. 
We should go back to the drawing 
board on this bill, because H.R. 2062 
begs for reliable data and evidence, 
thoughtful deliberation, and genuine 
consideration. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank Chair-
man SCOTT for the time that he has put 
in on this incredible piece of legisla-
tion, and thank Representative DAVIS 
for the work done to put together this 
important work. 
As my colleagues today have said, 
this is a bipartisan, commonsense bill. 
It is exactly the type of work and 
things that Congress should be doing. 
This is our system at work. 
The facts are very simple: Right now, 
because of a court decision, the stand-
ards for age discrimination are higher 
than that of any other type of discrimi-
nation. This bill fixes that and returns 
the country to what it was intended to 
be; that all forms of discrimination are 
illegal and must be stopped; that no 
form of discrimination is less wrong 
than another form of discrimination. 
This is the right thing to do and this 
is the right time to do it. That higher 
standard has made it harder to prove 
cases and leaves older workers exposed 
to discrimination. 
Age discrimination is wrong, plain 
and simple. It is also costly. According 
to a study by AARP, we lose out on 
$850 million of GDP each year because 
of it. 
The cost is not just in abstract dol-
lars. It comes from Americans who 
were skipped over for promotions they 
deserved. It comes from constituents 
who want to switch jobs but don’t get 
a call back. It comes from your neigh-
bor who lost their job and can still 
work but can’t get anyone to even look 
at their resume. 
The standard for proving age dis-
crimination must be fair, it must be 
level, and it must be treated as other 
forms of discrimination. 
Americans of all ages deserve the 
chance to work and to provide for their 
families, and the law should recognize 
their ability to work. 
There is no place for ageism in the 
workforce, and this must stop. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Louisiana. 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD a let-
ter of support from The Leadership 
Conference on Civil and Human Rights 
dated June 22, 2021, asking for a yes 
vote on the Protecting Older Workers 
Against Discrimination Act, H.R. 2062.

VOTE YES ON THE PROTECTING OLDER WORK-
ERS
AGAINST
DISCRIMINATION
ACT 
(POWADA), H.R. 2062 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of The 
Leadership Conference on Civil and Human 
Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse 
membership of more than 220 national orga-
nizations to promote and protect the civil 
and human rights of all persons in the 
United States, we urge you to vote yes on 
H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Workers 
Against 
Discrimination 
Act 
(POWADA), 
without amendments that would limit the 
bill’s scope or undermine its protections. 
POWADA is a priority of The Leadership 
Conference, and we will include your vote in 
our voting record for the 117th Congress. 
Despite longstanding federal prohibitions 
against workplace discrimination based on 
age, pervasive age discrimination in the 
United States continues to harm older work-
ers—denying working people dignity on the 
job and threatening their economic security. 
In 2020, 78 percent of older workers reported

having seen or experienced age discrimina-
tion in the workplace, with Hispanic workers 
perceiving slightly more age discrimination 
at 82 percent. These numbers reflect an in-
crease in age discrimination during the 
COVID–19 pandemic for all workers, across 
race and gender. Previous research on age 
discrimination before the pandemic reflects 
that women workers and workers of color, 
especially Black workers, have been more 
likely to experience age discrimination, and 
unemployment rates suggest that workers of 
color may continue to be more vulnerable. 
For example, although the unemployment 
rate in May 2021 for White workers ages 45– 
59 was 4.2 percent, for Black workers, the 
rate was 10.6 percent. 
The ability to enjoy employment opportu-
nities, free from unlawful discrimination, is 
key to promoting economic security for 
marginalized and multi-marginalized com-
munities. Systemic racism and decades of 
structural inequality in almost every area of 
life, including education, health care, hous-
ing, and employment, have resulted in eco-
nomic disparties that have severely threat-
ened the lives and well-being of far too many 
people in the United States. Women, for ex-
ample, are nearly two-thirds of all individ-
uals aged 65 and over living in poverty, with 
women of color struggling at increased rates. 
LGBTQ older adults are also at increased 
risk of poverty compared to non-LGBTQ 
older adults, and people with disabilities are 
twice as likely to live in poverty than people 
without disabilities. Congress must ensure 
that our federal laws are able to protect all 
persons in the United States from unlawful 
discrimination. A key step toward that goal 
is to ensure that unlawful discrimination 
plays no role in employment practices, 
POWADA is critically needed legislation 
that would restore fairness by reinstating 
well-established legal protections against 
workplace discrimination that were under-
mined by the 2009 Supreme Court decision in 
Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc, which 
imposed a higher burden of proof on working 
people in age discrimination cases. After 
Gross, working people must prove not only 
that age discrimination influenced an em-
ployer’s conduct but that age played a deci-
sive role in the employer’s conduct. The bur-
den of proof for age discrimination is now 
higher than the standard of proof for allega-
tions of discrimination based on sex, race, 
religion, or national origin, sending the sig-
nal that some amount of age discrimination 
in the workplace is acceptable. Just as trou-
bling, though, is that the Gross decision 
paved the way for the same unreasonably dif-
ficult burden of proof in cases in which an 
employer retaliates against workers who 
challenge workplace discrimination based on 
race, sex, or other grounds. POWADA is nec-
essary to return the law to what it was be-
fore the Gross decision. 
Simply put, no amount of unlawful dis-
crimination in the workplace is acceptable. 
We therefore urge you to vote yes on H.R. 
2062, the Protecting Older Workers Against 
Discrimination Act. If you have any ques-
tions or would like to discuss this matter 
further, please contact Gaylynn Burroughs, 
senior policy counsel. 
Sincerely, 
WADE HENDERSON, 
Interim 
President 
& 
CEO.

Managing 
Director 
and Interim Execu-
tive Vice President 
for Government Af-
fairs. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, Democrats claim H.R. 
2062 merely conforms age discrimina-
tion and retaliation claims with cur-
rent law regarding mixed-motive dis-
crimination claims under title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act. 
However, Congress specifically draft-
ed the Age Discrimination in Employ-
ment Act, ADEA, to be different from 
title VII, because age is uniquely dif-
ferent from the characteristics on 
which title VII prohibits discrimina-
tion, namely, race, color, religion, sex, 
or national origin. 
The ADEA states that it is lawful for 
an employer to take an employment 
action otherwise prohibited by the 
statute if the differential treatment is 
‘‘based on reasonable factors other 
than age.’’ 
Notably, this provision is not found 
in title VII. 
The Supreme Court has also ex-
plained in several cases why age dis-
crimination differs from other forms of 
discrimination. 
For example, the Supreme Court, in 
Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab-
oratory, in 2008, wrote that, ‘‘Congress 
took account of the distinctive nature 
of age discrimination and the need to 
preserve a fair degree of leeway for em-
ployment decisions with effects that 
correlate with age.’’ 
In addition, the Supreme Court, in 
the 2013 Nassar case, explained why a 
mixed-motive standard is ill-suited for 
retaliation claims. 
The Supreme Court observed that 
with regard to mixed-motive standards 
in retaliation cases, ‘‘lessening the 
causation standard could contribute to 
the filing of frivolous claims, which 
would siphon resources from efforts by 
employers, 
administrative 
agencies, 
and courts to combat workplace har-
assment.’’ 
Allowing mixed-motive claims in age 
and retaliation cases, which H.R. 2062 
does, will lead to more frivolous legis-
lation. 
We should heed congressional and Su-
preme Court precedents and vote down 
H.R. 2062. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I include in the RECORD a letter from 
the AARP, which says, in part, ‘‘Older 
workers are valuable assets to their 
employers and the economy. Despite 
that, 78 percent of older workers re-
ported having seen or experienced age 
discrimination in the workplace in 
2020, up markedly from 61 percent in 
2018. More than half of older workers 
are forced out of a job before they in-
tend to retire. Nine out of 10 of those 
who do find work never again match 
their prior earnings. Making matters 
worse, the COVID–19 pandemic has sig-
nificantly diminished job prospects and 
future retirement security of older 
workers. In April, over half of job seek-
ers ages 55 and older continued to be 
long-term unemployed, 53.3 percent, 
compared to 42.3 percent of job seekers 
ages 16 to 54. The labor force participa-
tion rates for older women workers, 
along with their earning power and fu-
ture retirement security, have been 
particularly hard-hit by COVID.’’ All of 
that is in the letter.

Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to repeat: 
Republicans hate discrimination in any 
form. We particularly do not want any 
kind of discrimination in the work-
place, and we do not want discrimina-
tion against older workers. 
We know that older workers were ex-
celling in the pre-pandemic economy. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics, BLS, employment for workers 
age 65 and older tripled from 1988 to 
2018, while employment for younger 
workers grew by only a third. 
The number of employed people age 
75 and older nearly quadrupled from 
461,000 in 1988 to 1.8 million in 2018. 
As the country continues to recover 
from the COVID–19 pandemic, BLS re-
cently 
reported 
that 
job 
openings 
reached a record high of 9.3 million in 
April 2021, while hiring lags far behind.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3058 
June 23, 2021 
Employers are desperate to fill good- 
paying jobs, but qualified workers are 
hard to find because of Democrat-en-
acted policies. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle continue to paint a bleak pic-
ture of job opportunities for older 
Americans, when, in fact, employment 
trends for older workers have been 
positive in recent decades and will con-
tinue to improve as the country fully 
reopens following the pandemic. 
According to BLS, in 1998, the me-
dian weekly earnings of older, full-time 
employees was 77 percent of the median 
for workers 16 and up. In 2018, older 
workers earned 7 percent more than 
the median for all workers. 
The labor force participation rate for 
older Americans has been rising stead-
ily since the late 1990s. Participation 
rates for younger age groups either de-
clined or flattened over this period. 
Over the past 20 years, the number of 
older workers on full-time work sched-
ules grew 21⁄2 times faster than the 
number working part time. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to strongly support your bill 
to protect older Americans against dis-
crimination. 
It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, but 
age discrimination and ageism are still 
very common in many American work-
places. 
During the worst of this pandemic, 
older workers and women experienced 
many of the demotions and layoffs that 
we have heard about so much. 
Protections against age discrimina-
tion are more important than ever as 
we seek to ensure that employers do 
not use someone’s age as a motivating 
factor to deny them a promotion, to 
demote them, or to even fire them. 
When 
age 
discrimination 
occurs, 
many people do not report it. But when 
they do, under current law, it is incred-
ibly difficult to prove that age was the 
motivating factor. 
Therefore, Congress must ensure that 
we do not place burdensome require-
ments of proof of age discrimination on 
those who actually bring age discrimi-
nation claims to the forefront. 
That is why this bill is so very, very 
important, and I thank the chairman 
for his tireless efforts on this cause. 
While this is an excellent bill, there 
is one provision I wish we had included 
that currently is not. In the fight 
against age discrimination, we need to 
clearly protect folks at the very first 
opportunity, the hiring process. 
That is why I introduced a bill last 
week, the Protect Older Job Applicants 
Act. It simply clarifies that the provi-
sions under the Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act also apply to job ap-
plicants. Most people already assume 
this is the case. However, it is not. 
After two recent Federal court cases 
about age discrimination, there has 
been confusion about the applicability 
of protections to applicants or employ-
ees only. 
My bill seeks to provide clarity and 
ultimately protect older Americans 
from the very beginning, at the appli-
cation. 
I know that this is a priority for the 
chairman also, and I will continue to 
work with him to make sure that we 
continue the conversation on this 
shared priority, because nobody should 
be denied a job opportunity solely be-
cause of their age.

Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS), the 
chair of the Subcommittee on Work-
force Protections. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his work on this bill. 
Although House Democrats continue 
to work for an end to the pandemic, 
COVID–19 has changed the American 
workforce. People from all walks of life 
have suffered. Older Americans in the 
workforce continue to feel the fallout 
from the coronavirus. 
The perception that older workers 
are not as valuable as their younger 
counterparts persists. The myth that 
older workers are unproductive and 
costly persists. The idea that older 
Americans do not value their careers, 
their job, or their work persists. Be-
cause of these challenges, older work-
ers are more likely to remain out of 
the workforce when they lose a job. 
Age discrimination is a real threat to 
our workforce, but it doesn’t have to be 
that way. That is why the Protecting 
Older Workers Against Discrimination 
Act is so very important. Older work-
ers need specific protections under the 
law. 
As we look ahead to a stronger econ-
omy and upcoming legislation, I urge 
Members to remember the importance 
of older workers to our economy, to 
our workforce, and to our families. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the group Paralyzed Vet-
erans of America. 
PARALYZED VETERANS OF AMERICA, 
Washington, DC, May 24, 2021. 
Hon. ROBERT SCOTT, 
Chairman, Education and Labor Committee, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Paralyzed Veterans of 
America (PVA) is pleased to support reintro-
duction of the Protecting Older Workers 
against Discrimination Act (POWADA). PVA 
is the nation’s only Congressionally-char-
tered veterans service organization solely 
dedicated to representing veterans with spi-
nal cord injuries and/or disorders. POWADA 
is important to our members as people with 
disabilities because it will restore well-es-
tablished legal standards on workplace dis-
crimination that were undermined by a 2009 
Supreme Court decision. 
In 2009, in the case of Gross v. FBL Finan-
cial Services, the U.S. Supreme Court de-
cided to impose a much higher burden of 
proof on workers who allege age discrimina-
tion than on those who allege discrimination 
based on race, sex, national origin, or reli-
gion. By changing the legal standards in age 
discrimination cases—from having to prove 
that age played a role in the worker’s treat-
ment to having to show that age played the 
decisive role in the worker’s treatment—the 
Court set aside decades of legal precedent 
and signaled to employers that some amount 
of age discrimination is permissible. More-
over, the decision made it exponentially 
more difficult for workers who have experi-
enced age discrimination to seek redress in 
court and prove their case. 
Many courts began applying the Gross de-
cision to weaken other civil rights laws, in-
cluding disability discrimination cases. In 
2019, in the case of Natofsky v. City of N.Y., 
the Second Circuit joined the Fourth, Sixth, 
and Seventh Circuits in ruling that dis-
ability discrimination under the ADA and 
the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 must be estab-
lished under the higher, ‘‘butfor’’ standard. 
Federal courts have consistently, but in our 
view erroneously, applied Gross to claims 
under the Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA), ADA retaliation, and the Rehabilita-
tion Act of 1973. Some courts have ques-
tioned the applicability of Gross to disability

claims without deciding the issue, but no 
court has declined to apply Gross to the 
ADA/Rehabilitation Act. Some courts have 
even begun to apply Gross to disability dis-
crimination in public accommodations. 
The unemployment rate for workers with 
disabilities is almost double the rate for 
workers without disabilities. For all the 
workers affected by the Gross decision, 
POWADA is a jobs bill. 
By clarifying that discrimination may play 
no role in employment decisions under the 
ADA and certain other laws, this legislation 
would simply restore the law prior to the 
Gross decision. 
PVA appreciates your continued pursuit of 
this important legislation and urges Con-
gress to act swiftly on its passage. 
Sincerely, 
HEATHER ANSLEY, MSW, ESQ., 
Associate Executive Director. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume to 
close. 
Mr. Speaker, older Americans make 
vital contributions in the workplace. 
Committee Republicans are committed 
to eliminating discrimination in the 
workplace, 
rebuilding 
our 
sluggish 
economy, and producing a competitive 
workforce. 
Unfortunately, H.R. 2062 is a destruc-
tive and misleading bill that does not 
protect older workers, and it rewards 
trial lawyers at the expense of sound 
public policy. It is Democrats prom-
ising deliverance, but delivering dis-
appointment. 
This sweeping one-size-fits-all ruse is 
not the answer, unless Congress decides 
it wants to benefit trial lawyers at the 
expense of older American workers. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 
2062, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time 
to close. 
The 
Protecting 
Older 
Workers 
Against Discrimination Act is a bipar-
tisan bill that has been introduced over 
many Congresses with growing sup-
port. Over the last decade, Members 
have debated this bill through multiple 
legislative hearings, and bills in both 
the House and the Senate have been in-
troduced and improved every Congress 
since 2009. 
Despite the bipartisan legacy of this 
proposal, some of my colleagues have 
raised disappointing opposition today. 
But let’s be clear. This bill is not about 
increasing the number of age discrimi-
nation claims. It is about giving vic-
tims of discrimination a fair shot at 
getting relief. It is simply restoring 
basic protections for older workers. 
Yes, discrimination against older 
workers is already illegal, but, regret-
tably, it is unnecessarily harder to 
prove because of the 2009 decision. In 
spite of the fact that it is more dif-
ficult, cases are still being brought. 
But if the cases were as easy to bring 
or the same difficulty to bring as other 
cases, even more cases would have been 
filed. 
We know this is more difficult be-
cause in the original case of Gross v. 
FBL Financial Services, Jack Gross 
successfully proved that his employer 
had demoted older workers who refused 
to accept a buyout, while giving their 
jobs to younger workers. Yet it was 
only after the Supreme Court changed 
the rules and required Mr. Gross to 
retry his case that he lost with the 
higher standard, because, despite hav-
ing the same facts, the same parties, 
and the same court, he lost his case. 
The 
Protecting 
Older 
Workers 
Against Discrimination Act is designed 
to ensure that older workers like Mr. 
Gross are not denied justice and fair 
treatment that they deserve. 
We have heard about attorneys’ fees. 
We need to just remind everybody that 
lawyers are only awarded attorneys’ 
fees when they win the case. So if you 
want to reduce attorneys’ fees, the 
businesses can stop discriminating. 
I hope we can all agree that it is time 
to stand up for older workers and treat 
all 
workers 
facing 
discrimination, 
whether it is on the basis of sex, race, 
religion, national origin, or age, with 
consistency and fairness. 
I thank the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) again for working 
with me on this bipartisan priority. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of H.R. 2062, the 
Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimina-
tion Act of 2021. I am pleased to be a cospon-
sor of this measure. 
I’m so pleased to see bipartisan support for 
this bill. Providing older workers with the legal 
tools they need to challenge unjust discrimina-
tion in the workplace should not be a partisan 
issue. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 
our workforce is working longer than they 
have before. Those who are still working at or 
above the retirement age may be forced to do 
so because they have no other choice. 
This vulnerable part of the American work-
force deserves to have the same promotions 
and prospects as any other age group in a 
truly fair labor force. Unfortunately, age-based 
discrimination in the workplace can make it 
difficult for older individuals. 
And since a 2009 Supreme Court ruling, 
employees who felt that they were wrongly 
discriminated against based on age have had 
to meet a much more burdensome standard to 
get relief in court under federal law. 
That ruling went against decades of legal 
precedent and weakened protections for our 
working class, burdening victims and shielding 
those employers who in engage in discrimina-
tory actions from accountability. 
That is why it is so important that we pass 
H.R. 2062, and help older workers who have 
suffered discrimination. 
Those facing discrimination should not have 
to jump through more hoops to ensure that 
their rights are protected. As noted by the 
Leadership Conference on Civil and Human 
Rights, ‘‘The ability to enjoy employment op-
portunities, free from unlawful discrimination, 
is key to promoting economic security for 
marginalized and multi-marginalized commu-
nities.’’ 
I urge my colleagues to vote in support of 
this bill to protect our American workers and 
hold companies accountable for discriminatory 
practices. 
I thank the Chairman for his leadership on 
this issue. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Judiciary Committee 
and the Democratic Task Force on Aging and 
Families, and as cosponsor, I rise in strong 
support of the bipartisan H.R. 2062, the ‘‘Pro-
tecting Older Americans Against Discrimina-
tion Act of 2021,’’ which restores the burden of 
proof standard for workers alleging age dis-
crimination back to the pre-2009 standard—re-
turning the burden back to the same standard 
used for alleged discrimination based on race, 
sex, national origin, and religion. 
This important bill is supported by numerous 
key organizations, including AARP, Leadership 
Council of Aging Organizations, National 
Council on Aging, Justice in Aging, AAUW, 
Consortium 
for 
Citizens 
with 
Disabilities 
(CCD), American Association of People with 
Disabilities (AAPD), Disability Rights Edu-
cation & Defense Fund (DREDF), National 
Disability Institute, Easter Seals, National Part-
nership for Women & Families, National Wom-
en’s Law Center, National Education Associa-
tion, AFSCME, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic 
Social Justice, and Paralyzed Veterans of 
America. 
Mr. Speaker, prior to 2009, older workers al-
leging age discrimination in the workplace 
faced the same burden of proof as those who 
allege discrimination based on race, sex, na-
tional origin, or religion. 
This burden of proof is called the ‘‘mixed- 
motive’’ standard, where the complaining party 
need only prove that age (or whatever type of 
discrimination is being alleged) was one of the 
motivating factors behind the employer’s ad-
verse action. 
This situation changed dramatically in 2009, 
when in a 5–4 decision in Gross v. FBL Finan-
cial Services Inc., 557 U.S. 157 (2009), the 
Supreme Court erected a new and substantial 
legal barrier in the path of older workers—im-
posing a much higher burden of proof on 
workers alleging age discrimination. 
This higher burden of proof requires the 
older worker alleging age discrimination to 
prove that age was the decisive and deter-
minative cause for the employer’s adverse ac-
tion rather than just a motivating factor in the 
employer’s action. 
Mr. Speaker, this Supreme Court decision 
sent a terrible message to employers and the 
courts that some types of discrimination are 
not as wrong, or as unlawful, as other forms 
of discimination. 
H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Americans 
Against Discrimination Act of 2021, simply re-
turns the burden of proof for workers alleging 
age discrimination back to where it was before 
the odious decision in Gross v. FBL Financial 
Services. 
In addition, since the Gross decision in 
2009, some courts have extended the Gross’s 
unreasonably difficult burden of proof to two 
other types of worker discrimination com-
plaints: retaliation cases, in which an employer 
retaliates against a worker who challenges 
workplace discrimination; and disability dis-
crimination cases. 
As a result, in returning to the pre-Gross 
burden of proof standard, H.R. 2062 ensures 
that all victims of workplace discrimination 
face the same burden of proof—the ‘‘mixed 
motive’’ burden of proof that has historically

been used in worker discrimination cases—by 
amending not only the Age Discrimination in 
Employment Act (ADEA), but also the anti-dis-
crimination provision of Title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, 
and the Rehabilitation Act. 
Mr. Speaker, it should be noted that age 
discrimination continues to be a significant 
problem in the workplace. 
Enforcement statistics from the Equal Em-
ployment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) 
show complaints of age discrimination to be 
climbing. 
In 2000, the EEOC received roughly 16,000 
charges of age discrimination; in 2017, the 
EEOC received over 20,000 complaints—ac-
counting for 23 percent of all discrimination 
charges filed. 
A 2013 AARP study found that more than 6 
in 10 workers ages 45 to 74 said they have 
seen or experienced age discrimination in the 
workplace . 
In this 2013 AARP study, nearly 20 percent 
of respondents said they were not hired for a 
job because of their age and nearly 10 per-
cent said they were laid off or fired due to 
their age. 
Age discrimination is a key reason it takes 
unemployed older workers nearly a full year, 
on average, to find another job. 
And when they do land a new job, it is often 
for less money, which can have a crushing im-
pact on older workers’ long-term financial se-
curity and ability to live independently as they 
age. 
Older workers are a valuable asset to their 
employers and the economy, yet more than 
half of older workers are forced out of a job 
before they intend to retire, and even if they 
find work again, 9 in 10 never match their 
prior earnings. 
This is wrong; it is unfair and that is why I 
strongly support H.R. 2062, the Protecting 
Older Americans Against Discrimination Act of 
2021, and urge all Members to join me in vot-
ing for its passage by a resounding and over-
whelming margin.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 486, the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) and 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. FOXX) each will control 10 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself 1 minute. 
Mr. Speaker, there are two amend-
ments in this en bloc amendment. 
Mr. BROWN has offered an amendment 
to require the EEOC to submit an an-
nual report to Congress on the number 
of age discrimination claims brought 
under this act. 
Ms. WILLIAMS has offered an amend-
ment to require the EEOC to submit a 
report to Congress on any remaining 
disparities faced by workers pursuing 
relief under the mixed motive standard 
whose cases were covered by the 
ADEA, as well as other antidiscrimina-
tion laws. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the Democrat amendments. 
As I understand it, Representative 
BROWN’s 
amendment 
requires 
the 
EEOC chair to submit five annual re-
ports to Congress on the number of age 
discrimination claims brought to the 
EEOC under this act. If H.R. 2062 some-
how gets signed into law, these reports 
will be a day late and many dollars 
short because the law will have already 
harmfully reduced the burden of proof 
in these cases and nullified decades of 
Supreme Court precedent. 
Before discussing my concerns with 
this amendment, I admit I am puzzled 
that it requires a study on how this 
legislation will affect future age dis-
crimination claims when evidence is 
sorely lacking that there is a need for 
H.R. 2062 in the first place. 
A witness who testified on H.R. 2062 
before the Committee on Education 
and Labor acknowledged that EEOC 
data has not shown workers are dis-
couraged from filing age discrimina-
tion charges with the EEOC following 
the Supreme Court’s 2009 decision in 
Gross v. FBL Financial Services. 
With respect to this amendment, I 
have concerns about the feasibility and 
viability of the mandated reports. The 
amendment requires the EEOC to re-
port each year for 5 years on charges 
filed with the agency under H.R. 2062. 
H.R. 2062 drastically expands liability 
by allowing mixed motive claims in 
cases involving the Age Discrimination 
in Employment Act—ADEA—and three 
other statutes. However, when workers 
file charges with the EEOC, the worker 
will likely not indicate whether the 
charge involves mixed motives, nor is 
EEOC likely to be able to classify 
charges as being mixed motive or not. 
EEOC will therefore be unable to deter-
mine whether charges have been filed 
pursuant to H.R. 2062. 
I am very doubtful EEOC would be 
able to comply with this amendment’s 
requirements, and Congress should not 
include an unworkable mandate on an 
agency. Congress has enacted signifi-
cant laws prohibiting employment dis-
crimination, including the ADEA, the 
Americans with Disabilities Act, the 
Rehabilitation 
Act, 
and 
the 
Civil 
Rights Act, CRA. 
Congress purposefully enacted sepa-
rate nondiscrimination statutes, in-
cluding the ADEA, because age dis-
crimination involves unique and com-
plex factors, as do the other forms of 
discrimination addressed in these stat-
utes. 
H.R. 2062 overturns Supreme Court 
precedent, allows a plaintiff to argue 
that age was only a motivating but not 
decisive factor that led to an employ-
er’s unfavorable employment action. 
Allowing such mixed motive claims 
will eliminate the carefully balanced 
standard Congress adopted when it 
passed the ADEA, resulting in more 
frivolous lawsuits. 
Here’s why: Under H.R. 2062, a plain-
tiff is very unlikely to receive any

monetary award from the defendant be-
cause most employers will be able to 
demonstrate they would have taken 
the same employment action regard-
less of the worker’s age or other imper-
missible reasons. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Ms. WILLIAMS). 
Ms. 
WILLIAMS 
of 
Georgia. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Protecting Older Workers Against Dis-
crimination Act and my amendment to 
the bill. 
For older job seekers and workers, 
age discrimination remains a barrier to 
both getting employed and staying em-
ployed. According to an AARP survey 
released in 2019, three in five older 
workers report that they have seen or 
experienced age discrimination on the 
job. 
Age discrimination should have no 
place in decisions about an employee. 
It doesn’t matter if age is one factor or 
the only factor in these decisions. Dis-
crimination is still wrong. 
Under current law, an older worker 
must prove that a negative action was 
taken against them solely because of 
their age to pursue legal remedy for 
age discrimination. That leaves out a 
lot 
of 
workers 
who 
have 
been 
marginalized because of their age. 
The bill before us would create a rea-
sonable burden of proof under the law 
to allow more workers who have faced 
age discrimination to pursue relief. 
Enacting this legislation would be a 
monumental step, but we have more to 
do to ensure that all older workers are 
served well by protections under law 
because the circumstances facing older 
workers are not all the same. 
Many 
older 
workers 
face 
inter-
sectional 
discrimination 
based 
not 
only on their age, but also due to fac-
tors like their race, their gender, or 
disability status. For example, in a 2017 
experimental study published by the 
Federal 
Reserve 
Bank, 
researchers 
found that older women encounter 
more age discrimination in the hiring 
process and callback process than men. 
To ensure equitable protection for in-
dividuals experiencing intersectional 
discrimination, we have to understand 
any disparities they may face in pur-
suing relief from discrimination as this 
legislation is implemented. 
My amendment tasks the Equal Em-
ployment 
Opportunity 
Commission 
with completing a study on these dis-
parities and reporting back to Congress 
within 2 years. This analysis will be 
crucial to ensuring our laws are serv-
ing all of us and that we are truly 
reaching the ideal of equality for all. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support my amendment and the under-
lying legislation. 
b 1545 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, as I understand it, Rep-
resentative WILLIAMS’ amendment re-
quires EEOC to submit a contrived and 
convoluted report to Congress ana-
lyzing disparities that individuals face 
in pursuing relief under the mixed-mo-
tive evidentiary standard. The report 
must examine age discrimination com-
bined with discrimination based on 
race, color, religion, sex, national ori-
gin, or disability. 
This amendment does nothing to ad-
dress the fatal flaws in the bill that 
would allow mixed-motive claims in 
age retaliation and disability cases, 
which will increase frivolous litigation 
while not providing any monetary 
damages for nearly all plaintiffs. 
As a practical matter, I question 
whether EEOC will be able to complete 
the tortuous analysis proposed in the 
amendment. 
As I noted previously, workers filing 
discrimination or retaliation charges 
with EEOC do not indicate whether 
they involve a mixed-motive claim, 
and EEOC does not collect this data. A 
mixed-motive claim is something a 
plaintiff’s attorney adds to a lawsuit. 
As such, I am skeptical whether 
EEOC will be able to find any data re-
lating to mixed-motive claims. 
More importantly, the amendment, 
which was submitted and then amend-
ed after the Rules Committee’s stated 
deadline, will not fix the bill’s many 
shortcomings, such as allowing mixed- 
motive claims in age discrimination 
and retaliation cases, even though con-
gressional and Supreme Court prece-
dents strongly advise against these 
changes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
this amendments en bloc, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. BROWN). 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to first recognize the hard work 
and the leadership of Chairman BOBBY 
SCOTT and the entire Education and 
Labor Committee on this outstanding 
underlying bill. 
When older workers lose their jobs, 
they are much more likely to join the 
ranks of the long-term unemployed. 
Unfortunately, discrimination seems to 
be a significant factor in this. 
Enforcement 
statistics 
from 
the 
EEOC show age discrimination com-
plaints are climbing. In 2000, the EEOC 
received roughly 16,000 complaints of 
age discrimination, and 17 years later, 
the EEOC received 20,000 complaints 
that year, accounting for 23 percent of 
all discrimination charges filed. 
As Ms. WILLIAMS mentioned, a 2018 
survey conducted by the AARP found 
that three in five workers age 45 and 
older have seen or experienced age dis-
crimination in the workplace. 
The 
Protecting 
Older 
Workers 
Against Discrimination Act would re-
store legal protections for older Ameri-
cans and hold employers accountable 
for age discrimination. 
My amendment would require the 
EEOC to submit annual reports to Con-
gress on the number of age discrimina-
tion claims brought under this act. 
Congress needs this information in a 
timely and transparent way to ensure 
our older workers are being properly 
protected and heard. 
Discrimination 
is 
discrimination, 
whether it be age, race, gender, reli-
gion, gender identity, or sexual ori-
entation, and all should be treated fair-
ly under the law. 
My amendment and the underlying 
bill are commonsense pieces of legisla-
tion that would restore fairness for all 
workers. I strongly encourage my col-
leagues to support this amendments en 
bloc and the underlying legislation. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to state that these two 
amendments would improve the bill. 
The one from Mr. BROWN would give 
information that is already being pro-
vided now, but this would just make 
sure it continues. It is being provided 
on a voluntary basis, these annual re-
ports. 
And Ms. WILLIAMS offers a very inter-
esting analysis that some people may 
be being discriminated against on mul-
tiple grounds and pointed out the Fed-
eral Reserve study that showed that 
older workers who happen to be women 
fared a lot worse than the older work-
ers who happen to be men. We may 
need to figure out how we deal with 
that, but we need the data before we 
can move forward. 
I hope that we adopt this amend-
ment, and, Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, the only 
parties who will win in nearly all cases 
under H.R. 2062 with these amend-
ments, if they are passed, are trial law-
yers. Unfortunately, Democrats have 
chosen to further their pro-trial lawyer 
agenda by putting forward H.R. 2062, 
legislation that masquerades as protec-
tion for workers. 
H.R. 2062 is yet another one-size-fits- 
all approach that fails to address the 
purported problem, neglects real-world 
experiences, and disregards decades of 
Supreme Court precedent. 
These poorly drafted fig leaf amend-
ments in the en bloc do nothing to ad-
dress the fundamental flaws in H.R. 
2062 and place an unworkable mandate 
on EEOC. I urge my colleagues to op-
pose them. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 486, the pre-
vious 
question 
is

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 486, the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) and 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. FOXX) each will control 10 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, as I said 
earlier, when considering any legisla-
tion, the House should first determine 
whether legislation is needed and, next, 
whether the bill under consideration 
will adequately address or improve the 
situation. 
Before H.R. 2062 was brought to the 
House floor, the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor did not have a stand-
alone hearing on the bill and instead 
held a subcommittee-level hearing on 
multiple, wide-ranging topics. 
This complex and sweeping legisla-
tion deserves further examination by 
the committee so Members can gather 
more information from a variety of ex-
perts to make an informed decision re-
garding its practicality. 
Supporters of H.R. 2062 claim the Su-
preme Court’s 2009 decision in the 
Gross case and 2013 decision in the 
Nassar case have harmed workers who 
faced age discrimination or unlawful 
retaliation for claiming discrimina-
tion. Publicly available data does not 
show that the Supreme Court decisions 
in the Gross or Nassar cases have dis-
couraged individuals from filing EEOC 
charges. 
A Democrat-invited witness who tes-
tified acknowledged that ‘‘it is difficult 
to quantify the impact that the Gross 
decision has had on the number of 
older workers who bring cases and the 
number of those who win them.’’ 
This witness also acknowledged that 
‘‘when we might have expected a drop 
in charges due to Gross-inspired dis-
couragement from employment attor-
neys, there was a sizeable jump in the 
number of ADEA charges filed with the 
EEOC.’’ 
In addition, a review of the Equal 
Employment Opportunity Commission, 
or EEOC, data shows that, as a percent-
age of all charges filed, the rate of 
EEOC age discrimination charges is ap-
proximately the same as 11 years be-
fore the Gross decision, with a slightly 
higher percentage of age discrimina-
tion charges filed after the Gross deci-
sion. 
As a percentage of all charges filed in 
the 7 years following the Nassar deci-
sion, there has also been an increase in 
title VII retaliation charges, which 
shows that individuals have not been 
discouraged from filing these charges. 
Further, a review of court decisions 
shows that plaintiffs have continued to 
win age discrimination and title VII re-
taliation cases in the wake of the Su-
preme Court’s decisions of Gross and 
Nassar. 
Bottom line, we must ensure that be-
fore we continue to legislate on an 
issue that may not need additional 
Washington interference, we have accu-
rate data. 
My amendment simply states that 
before H.R. 2062 goes into effect, the 
Government 
Accountability 
Office 
must conduct a study and report to 
Congress on whether individuals have 
been discouraged from filing age dis-
crimination or title VII retaliation 
charges and from filing lawsuits fol-
lowing the decisions in Gross and 
Nassar and whether there have been 
fewer plaintiffs winning age discrimi-
nation and title VII retaliation law-
suits. 
If the GAO finds that individuals 
have not been discouraged from filing 
charges and lawsuits, and have, in fact, 
won more lawsuits than prior to the 
Supreme Court decisions, then the bill 
would not go into effect. 
Let’s not put the cart before the 
horse. I urge my colleagues to vote in 
favor of my amendment to ensure this 
legislation is actually needed and ade-
quately addresses the purported con-
cerns of the bill’s sponsors. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. JONES), a distin-
guished member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-
position to my Republican colleague’s 
amendment mandating a study before 
the bill can go into effect. 
This is not an earnest attempt to 
look into the Supreme Court’s impact 
on age discrimination cases. It is a 
delay tactic and nothing more. 
We know that age discrimination 
happens. In fact, not long ago, we 
heard compelling witness testimony in 
the Education and Labor Committee 
highlighting the need for this very leg-
islation. 
Ageism is one of the most common 
and, sadly, most accepted forms of dis-
crimination in the workplace. Last 
year, the EEOC received over 14,000 age 
discrimination complaints, accounting 
for over 20 percent of all discrimina-
tion charges filed in this country. 
This is a problem that impacts not 
just workers but our entire economy, 
and it particularly harms women and 
people of color. According to the 
AARP, nearly two-thirds of women and 
more than three-quarters of Black 
workers age 45 and over say they have 
seen or experienced age discrimination 
in the workplace. 
We don’t need a study to tell us that 
a substantially higher burden of proof 
for 
some 
forms 
of 
discrimination 
makes it more difficult for workers 
who can prove discrimination to get 
their day in court and to prevail. That 
is just common sense. 
What we need is a return to a mixed- 
motive standard, which says that any 
consideration of age, as opposed to 
ability to perform a job, is impermis-
sible in employment decisions. 
We can look at two cases that were 
proceeding 
under 
a 
mixed-motive 
standard but were dismissed following 
the 
Supreme 
Court’s 
precedents. 
Courts dismissed both of these cases on 
the grounds that the facts, which were 
sufficient under a mixed-motive stand-
ard, were no longer sufficient under the 
heightened but-for standard. 
First, there is the case of Jack Gross, 
an older gentleman who had been de-
moted after refusing a buyout when his 
employer underwent a merger. As he 
and many older workers were demoted,

his younger colleagues received pro-
motions. 
Mr. Gross challenged his demotion 
under the Age Discrimination in Em-
ployment Act and won his case at trial 
under the motivating factor frame-
work. However, after the Supreme 
Court changed the rules and required 
him to retry his case under the new 
and more stringent but-for causation 
standard, he lost despite the fact that 
he had proved the same set of facts 
with the same parties in the same 
courts as before. 
b 1600 
Second, consider the impact of the 
Nassar case on anti-retaliation claims 
under the Civil Rights Act. In the case 
of Shumate v. Selma City Board of 
Education, an elementary school cafe-
teria worker alleged that she had been 
passed over for promotion due to hav-
ing filed earlier discrimination claims, 
and that those claims had been dis-
cussed by the interview panel. 
The district court denied the employ-
er’s motion for summary judgment on 
her retaliation claim. However, the 
Nassar decision was issued a few 
months later and the employer moved 
for reconsideration under the new cau-
sation standard. This time, the district 
court dismissed the worker’s retalia-
tion claim and granted summary judg-
ment to the employer, stating that, 
‘‘the Supreme Court has changed the 
rules since then.’’ 
Same facts. Same case. Different 
causation standard, and a win was 
turned into a loss. 
The 
Protecting 
Older 
Workers 
Against Discrimination Act reinstates 
the legal standard for proving age dis-
crimination and aligns it with the ex-
isting standard for proving discrimina-
tion based on sex, race, or national ori-
gin. 
Mr. Speaker, there is simply no ex-
cuse for discrimination of any kind in 
the workplace, and there is no reason 
to delay this legislation any further. 
We have already had a 12-year delay in 
restoring justice. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
reject the Allen amendment and sup-
port the underlying bill. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time I have remain-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina has 61⁄2 
minutes. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, again, I 
simply state this: My amendment says 
that the Government Accountability 
Office must conduct a study and report 
to Congress on whether individuals 
have been discouraged from filing age 
discrimination or title VII retaliation 
charges and from filing lawsuits fol-
lowing the decisions in Gross and 
Nassar, and whether there have been 
fewer plaintiffs winning age discrimi-
nation and title VII retaliation law-
suits. 
We must have the data before we 
move in this body. We do not have suf-
ficient 
information 
at 
this 
point. 
Again, no one wants discrimination in 
the workplace, but we have a justice 
system that provides for relief for peo-
ple who bring these cases. And I have 
just cited the cases presented here 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a vote for this 
amendment so that we can get the 
proper data. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina, (Ms. MANNING), a 
distinguished member on the Com-
mittee of Education and Labor. 
Ms. MANNING. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the Foxx amendment. 
The amendment proposed by my col-
league from North Carolina would 
weaken the essential civil rights pro-
tections that are the very purpose of 
the Protecting Older Workers Against 
Discrimination Act. 
The goal of the bill we are voting on 
today is to treat workers who are dis-
criminated against based on age, the 
very same way we treat workers who 
are discriminated against because of 
their race, gender, national origin, or 
religion. 
In our world of rising costs, shrink-
ing pensions and retirement savings, 
and longer life spans, many workers 
must work longer in order to be able to 
live out their retirement years in dig-
nity. That, in addition to the reasons 
of basic fairness, is why the Protecting 
Older Workers Against Discrimination 
Act is so important. 
This bill would apply the same bur-
den of proof to age discrimination 
claims that are currently applied to 
other forms of employment discrimina-
tion and retaliation prohibited by the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other stat-
utes. 
The Foxx amendment would weaken 
these protections by creating two dif-
ferent burdens of proof; one, for prov-
ing an act of discrimination, and a 
tougher burden of proving retaliation 
against a worker who has reported that 
discrimination. 
The Foxx amendment would actually 
make it harder for an employee to se-
cure relief from employer retaliation 
under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as 
well as other civil rights statutes. In 
other words, an employer who retali-
ates against an older worker for report-
ing discrimination would have an easi-
er time getting away with it. 
If an employer has less risk of being 
held 
accountable 
for 
retaliating 
against an older worker who reports 
discrimination, by firing or otherwise 
penalizing the employee, then the un-
derlying protections of the law are 
weakened because people will be de-
terred from reporting retaliatory acts. 
H.R. 2062, the Protecting Older Work-
ers Against Discrimination Act, clari-
fies the standard applied to age dis-
crimination 
and 
retaliation—the 
mixed-motive 
standard—that 
was 
originally applied to claims under title 
VII of the Civil Rights Act prior to the 
Supreme Court’s wrong-headed deci-
sions in the 2009 Gross case. This is the 
same standard applied to discrimina-
tion claims under the Age Discrimina-
tion in Employment Act, the Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act, and the Re-
habilitation Act. 
It is important to note that the 
changes in language proposed by the 
Foxx amendment would have a particu-
larly egregious effect because the en-
forcement of civil rights laws rely 
heavily on individuals to assert their 
rights. That is why every civil rights 
law makes it a separate act of dis-
crimination for an employer to retali-
ate against employees for exercising 
their civil rights or opposing unlawful 
acts. Charges of retaliation are the 
most filed type of charge with the 
EEOC. 
In 2020, more than half of the charges 
filed involved retaliation claims. Since 
so many workers who report discrimi-
nation also report retaliation, it is 
critical that H.R. 2062 correct the legal 
standard set by the 2013 case, Univer-
sity of Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center v. Nassar. 
In that case, the Supreme Court ap-
plied the but-for standard to retalia-
tion claims under title VII of the Civil 
Rights Act instead of the mixed-motive 
standard used for all other types of em-
ployment discrimination. It makes no 
sense to have separate provisions of 
title VII requiring different standards 
of causation. 
The legislation before us today fixes 
the problem created by the Supreme 
Court rulings in the 2009 Gross decision 
and the 2013 Nassar decision by apply-
ing a mixed-motive standard to cases 
of age discrimination and retaliation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina. 
Ms. MANNING. The Protecting Older 
Workers Against Discrimination Act 
establishes the use of a mixed-motive 
standard, settling the confusing sepa-
ration of related civil rights claims and 
strengthening workers’ rights. 
We should reject the Foxx amend-
ment because prohibitions on retalia-
tion do not punish employers multiple 
times for the same offense; rather, they 
help to deter employers from punishing 
employees multiple times—first, by 
discriminating and denying the equal 
opportunity, then again by punishing 
employees for challenging that dis-
crimination. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
this amendment, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on the underlying bill, H.R. 2062. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to point out to 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle that there was a higher percent-
age of Republicans who voted for the 
1964 Civil Rights Act than Democrats, 
a higher percentage of Republicans 
voted for the ADEA, the Age Discrimi-
nation in Employment Act, and under

the ADA. It was President Bush who 
signed that bill. 
So Republicans have a pretty good 
record on promoting and protecting the 
civil rights of Americans in this coun-
try, all Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, for an employer to re-
taliate against an employee because 
that employee has previously made a 
discrimination complaint is wrong and 
it is already illegal. 
H.R. 2062 reduces the standard of 
proof in retaliation cases by allowing 
mixed-motive claims, overturning the 
Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in the 
Nassar case. 
Allowing mixed-motive claims in re-
taliation cases is unworkable and con-
trary to the text, structure, and his-
tory of title VII, the Age Discrimina-
tion in Employment Act and the Amer-
icans with Disabilities Act. 
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in 
the majority opinion in Nassar that in 
retaliation cases, ‘‘lessening the causa-
tion standard could contribute to the 
filing of frivolous claims, which would 
siphon resources from efforts by em-
ployers, administrative agencies, and 
courts to combat workplace harass-
ment.’’ 
Justice Kennedy also wrote in his 
opinion that the concern about divert-
ing resources was especially true be-
cause retaliation charges filed with the 
EEOC had nearly doubled in the past 15 
years and had become the second most 
frequently filed category of complaint. 
This concern is even more relevant 
today because retaliation is now the 
most frequently filed EEOC charge. All 
retaliation claims are inherently about 
differing explanations. 
In these situations, the plaintiff has 
already made a discrimination com-
plaint, and under the mixed-motive 
standard required under H.R. 2062, it 
will be a mere formality to plead that 
any subsequent negative action by the 
employer related to the employee was 
retaliatory. 
Under H.R. 2062, a plaintiff claiming 
retaliation will always survive the 
summary judgment stage of the litiga-
tion and the case will either settle or 
go to trial. This will increase the num-
ber 
of 
frivolous 
claims 
against 
unsuspecting business owners and im-
pose related financial costs noted in 
the Supreme Court decision, thus lim-
iting important resources that could 
otherwise be used to combat discrimi-
nation. 
Furthermore, there is no evidence to 
support the claim that employees have 
been harmed by the Nassar decision. 
And, by the way, when employees win 
lawsuits claiming retaliation under the 
current standard, they can receive 
monetary damages, back pay, and rein-
statement, as well as attorneys’ fees 
and costs. Under H.R. 2062, this won’t 
happen in nearly all of the cases. Only 
the trial lawyers will be paid. 
Mr. Speaker, my amendment strikes 
the harmful, overly broad, and unwork-
able provision in H.R. 2062, which al-
lows mixed-motive claims in retalia-
tion cases. 
The amendment protects the current 
standard of proof as described in the 
Nassar case, and I urge Members to 
support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, very briefly, the first 
amendment that requires the GAO 
study only seeks to say whether the 
cases went up or down. The cases can 
go up because there is more discrimi-
nation. It has nothing to do with 
whether or not it was because of the 
change in standard. It could be in spite 
of the standard. And all it does is delay 
the implementation of the bill. 
The other sets a different standard 
for retaliation, where you can win your 
case that you didn’t get promoted but 
lose your case on the fact that you got 
hired just because there is a differen-
tial standard. Well, that doesn’t make 
much sense. 
It seems to me that we should go 
back to the way it was before the Gross 
decision, have one standard in all of 
the discrimination cases, and have peo-
ple be able to prove their case the way 
they have always been able to prove 
their case. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this amendments en bloc, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the amend-
ments en bloc containing Representa-
tives ALLEN’s and FOXX’s amendments,

Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end, add the following: 
SEC. 5. STUDY AND REPORT TO CONGRESS. 
Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
Labor and the Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity Commission shall jointly conduct a 
study to determine the number of claims 
pending or filed, in addition to cases closed, 
by women who may have been adversely im-
pacted by age discrimination as a moti-
vating factor in workplace discrimination or 
employment termination. The Secretary of 
Labor and Chairman of the Commission shall 
jointly submit to the Congress, and make 
available to the public, a report that con-
tains the results of the study, including rec-
ommendations for best practices to prevent 
and to combat gender and age discrimination 
as it relates to women in the workplace. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 486, the gen-
tleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
RODNEY 
DAVIS) and a Member opposed each will 
control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Illinois. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my bipartisan amendment to the 
Protecting Older Workers Against Dis-
crimination Act, a bill that I am proud 
to be working on with my good friend, 
Chairman SCOTT. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. SCOTT). 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from Illinois for 
his hard work on this amendment and 
on the bill itself. He has been a leader 
on helping older workers avoid dis-
crimination. 
This amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Illinois and cosponsored 
by the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. 
PINGREE), would provide further infor-
mation on how many women are ad-
versely affected by age discrimination 
as a motivating factor in the work-
place, as well as provide best practices 
to combat gender and age discrimina-
tion. These practices will help support 
older women who may face multiple 
kinds of discrimination. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague 
for offering the amendment, and I also 
want to thank him for his distin-
guished leadership on the underlying 
legislation. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I reclaim my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill provides an im-
portant fix caused by the outcome of 
the 2019 Gross v. FBL Financial Serv-
ices, Inc., Supreme Court decision in 
order to ensure that older workers can 
seek the justice they deserve when 
they face age discrimination in the 
workplace, on a level playing field. 
The amendment that I introduced 
with Representative CHELLIE PINGREE 
highlights 
the 
discrimination 
that 
women face in the workplace based not 
only on gender, but on age as well. 
According to a 2018 report from the 
EEOC, women, especially older women, 
but also those at middle age, were sub-
jected to more age discrimination than 
older men. Research suggests that 
ageism at work begins at age 40 for 
women, 5 years earlier than men. This 
is unacceptable and we must find ways 
to correct this problem.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3065 
June 23, 2021 
This amendment would require the 
DOL and EEOC to conduct a com-
prehensive study on these age discrimi-
nation cases. DOL and EEOC would 
then be required to make recommenda-
tions for best practices to combat age 
discrimination of women in the work-
place. 
Challenges that women face are not 
partisan 
issues 
and, 
together, 
we 
should make every effort to address 
them. Employers should make, and 
have the right tools to make, conscious 
efforts to ensure that women have 
equal rights and opportunities in the 
workplace, regardless of their age. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
PINGREE
for co-leading this amend-
ment, and also Chairman SCOTT for his 
kind words and support of its inclusion. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
my amendment and to vote ‘‘yes’’ on

CONGRATULATING MICHAEL PAUL 
WILLIAMS 
ON 
WINNING 
PUL-
ITZER PRIZE 
(Mr. MCEACHIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Michael Paul 
Williams, a columnist from the Rich-
mond Times-Dispatch, the primary 
newspaper of record for the Common-
wealth, which is located in my district. 
Mr. Williams was recently awarded 
the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary. He 
is the first Pulitzer Prize recipient at 
the Times-Dispatch since 1948. 
Throughout his nearly 40-year career, 
he has been a dedicated and effective 
journalist who has focused much of his 
work on issues of race and racial in-
equality in Virginia. 
The first commentator of color at the 
Times-Dispatch, 
he 
has 
provided 
unique, insightful, and impactful com-
mentary that has sparked public dis-
course, helped shape narratives and un-
derstandings of race in Virginia, and 
challenged readers to consider the in-
equities that communities of color 
face. 
It is with great honor that I con-
gratulate Michael Paul Williams for 
his award-winning commentary on the 
issues impacting our communities in 
Richmond.

RECOGNIZING RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM WEEK 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Reli-
gious Freedom Week. Religious Free-
dom Week began on Monday and runs 
through June 29. 
Freedom of religion is a fundamental 
human right. Our Founding Fathers 
made sure it would always be pro-
tected. The First Amendment protects 
freedom of religion along with the free-
dom of speech and the freedom of the 
press. 
This assurance of freedom gives us 
all the opportunity to openly practice 
and speak our beliefs. It allows me to 
speak on the House floor right now. 
The United States is a place where 
all faiths can be peacefully practiced 
free from the fear of persecution. 
The very foundation of our Nation, a 
place of freedom and liberty for all, 
was conceived by individuals in search 
of religious freedom. 
Mr. Speaker, the United States of 
America will always be a beacon of 
light in the world, and we will always 
protect our fundamental, unified com-
mitment of religious freedom because 
no person should live in fear for their 
beliefs. 
f 
FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS BLOCK 
FOREST CLEANUPS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, access 
to our public lands is being cut off by 
road closures throughout the national 
forests in Region 5. The U.S. Forest 
Service is citing public safety concerns 
due to hazardous trees from past fire 
seasons. 
But this blocks the public from ac-
cessing the public lands, and it also 
prevents those roads being used as 
evacuation routes or access points to 
fight fires in coming seasons. 
One road that has been closed, the 
Greyback Road in the Rogue River- 
Siskiyou National Forest in northern 
California, is a California Office of 
Emergency Services designated evacu-
ation route for the town of Happy 
Camp, California. If Highway 96 is 
blocked, this is the only other way out 
of Happy Camp. 
Litigation is preventing the U.S. For-
est Service from working with private- 
sector partners to clean up the forests. 
For example, in the Mendocino Na-
tional Forest, 300,000 acres burned in 
2018. The Forest Service wanted to do 
4,700 acres, a tiny 2 percent of that, yet 
it was blocked by a lawsuit from doing 
that cleanup work. 
Without offering the salvage timber 
sale, that means it is going to cost tax-
payers $5.5 million instead of being 
able to recover some of the money. 
This litigation harms the public by 
leaving hazardous trees and snags out 
in the forest, which create safety issues 
and become fuel for the next fire sea-
son. 
We must reform NEPA and ESA.

HONORING FORMER 
CONGRESSMAN PAUL MITCHELL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to join several of my colleagues 
tonight to recognize our former col-
league, Mr. Paul Mitchell. 
Paul was recently diagnosed with 
cancer, and so many of us wanted to 
send our well-wishes that we decided 
the best way we could do it was from 
the well of the House, a place that Paul 
Mitchell loved and spent so much of his 
time. 
Paul represented Michigan’s 10th Dis-
trict in our State’s thumb from 2017 
until his retirement just this year. In 
that time, he proved himself to be the 
kind of principled, practical leader 
that Michigan is known for. 
Paul knew that the path to good gov-
ernment runs through reaching across 
the aisle. The proof is in his record. 
Paul was intentional about ensuring 
key legislation be introduced in a bi-
partisan fashion, and the folks he drew 
to his legislation ran the gamut of the 
political spectrum. 
Paul was an advocate for students, 
for investing in innovation, and for

economic development. Whether you 
were on the left or the right, Paul 
worked with you to get things done. 
These days, some might call that be-
havior an independent, being a mav-
erick. But to us, that was just Paul. 
When he announced his retirement in 
July 2019 in order to spend more time 
with his family, we, of course, wished 
him all the best. But I also felt a 
twinge of sadness in losing a funny, 
charming, and humble servant leader. 
He charted his own course in Con-
gress as both a legislator and a friend. 
His presence is deeply missed in this 
Chamber. 
Earlier this month, we received the 
news that Paul had been diagnosed 
with renal cancer. Weeks before, he had 
had emergency surgery to remove a 
mass and a blood clot that had moved 
to his heart. His doctors at Henry Ford 
Macomb Hospital estimated a 10 per-
cent chance of survival, but true to 
form, Paul pulled through. 
I am happy to announce that last 
night Paul went home to his family in 
Dryden. He has a long road of recovery 
ahead of him, one that will require 
things 
like 
physical 
therapy 
and 
immunotherapy, but Paul is approach-
ing his recovery with a typical can-do 
approach. 
We want to send him all of our love 
and all of our strength for recovery, 
those of us who spent so much time 
with him. Here assembled, we have 
members of the Michigan delegation 
and members of the Problem Solvers 
Caucus, two groups that spent a ton of 
time with Paul Mitchell. 
Mr. Speaker, it is, therefore, my 
privilege to turn the floor over to some 
of those friends to recognize him in the 
place that we know he loved so much. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
b 1745 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Ms. SLOTKIN for yielding and 
for organizing this Special Order in 
honor of our dear friend, Paul Mitchell. 
Mr. Speaker, I represent parts of 
Macomb and Oakland counties. And 
during my first term in Congress, Paul 
and I shared representation of Macomb. 
Paul represented the northern part; I 
represent the southern part. And while 
there were plenty of policies we dis-
agreed on, there were a lot of things we 
connected on, too. 
We wanted to bring better water in-
frastructure to Macomb. And, Paul, I 
am still working on it, and we are 
going to get there. 
We talked about our shared history 
in the workforce world. Paul was a real 
leader in workforce policy through his 
company, and I used to run the State 
workforce system in Michigan. And he 
was a real leader and a thought leader 
in that area. And, Paul, I am trying to 
carry that on as best I can, too, as we 
look towards WIOA reauthorization. 
And when we did spar over policy po-
sitions, it wasn’t mean-spirited. In 
fact, it was really close to my ideal of 
what it means to serve in this body. It 
was real, honest debate, the kind I was 
happy to have and honored to have. 
Paul and I now share one more con-
nection, and it is one we didn’t share. 
As a two-time cancer survivor, I know 
what it is like to get that diagnosis, 
and I know the stress and the pain that 
Paul and his family are facing. It is 
something I wouldn’t wish on anyone, 
and I am devastated that they have to 
go through it. 
I want Paul to know that Mary and I 
are thinking about you and praying for 
you as your treatment begins, and that 
I am here to lend an ear or even talk 
through this experience, the same way 
that you did for me when I was just 
coming to Congress. You were one of 
the most generous colleagues I knew. 
Mr. Speaker, I was lucky to have a 
neighbor like Paul Mitchell, and I look 
forward to the day we can celebrate 
your remission, Paul, and joust happily 
once again over the issues of the day. 
God bless you. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on this Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. 
SPANBERGER). 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my dear colleague from Michi-
gan for putting together this Special 
Order for us to talk about our former 
colleague—and for so many of us—our 
friend, Representative Paul Mitchell. 
Mr. Speaker, I first had the oppor-
tunity to meet Representative Mitchell 
on the floor of the House when his 
youngest son was visiting. We were on 
the House floor, entering our cards in 
for a vote, and Paul’s son wanted to 
help push the voting button for dif-
ferent Members. Paul, at that time, 
was a Republican; I am a Democrat. 
And if you gave your card to Paul’s 
son, he would invariably vote with the 
Republicans, regardless of who you 
were. So there were quite a few en-
gaged Democrats who thought they 
were being so kind letting a child vote, 
who had to run over to the well right 
behind me to change their vote, be-
cause, indeed—I believe he was 10 at 
the time—a 10-year-old had somehow 
mischievously voted incorrectly. 
Paul was simultaneously delighted 
by what was a bit of a funny experience 
on the House floor, but also a little bit 
embarrassed that people were running 
over, 
That was Paul. He would bring, and 
does bring, joy to every meeting. He is 
a serious person, focused on policy, fo-
cused on truth, on reality, on the 
things that matter to him, which were: 
his incredible career in business, on his 
wonderful family, eminently proud of 
his children; and, particularly, always 
willing to draw on his personal experi-
ences in business, as a parent—as a 
parent of a law enforcement officer—to 
find commonality and to advocate for 
the things that he believes in. 
And during our time in Congress, I 
was so grateful to serve on the Problem 
Solvers Caucus, or to be part of the 
Problem Solvers Caucus with Paul, 
where invariably during our weekly 
meetings, he would be a jovial part of 
those meetings, focused on the hard 
work of legislating, but also on bring-
ing a bit of humanity and commonality 
to the people gathered around the 
table, sometimes engaging in very, 
very difficult conversations. 
Paul made the very hard decision to 
retire after his terms in Congress. It 
was one that, as a friend, I heard him 
talk through the pros, the cons, wheth-
er he was ready to leave this place. A 
place that, while he was here, he so 
deeply loved, and a place where I be-
lieve as a colleague, I saw him make a 
significant impact. But ultimately, 
with a young child at home, a beautiful 
farm with lots of sheep, and a renewed 
interest in a love of racing, Paul did 
decide that it was time for him to re-
tire. 
Since his retirement, I have been a 
friend who has been on the receiving 
end of so many photos, as I am sure so 
many of our colleagues here have been, 
of snowy days on the farm in Michigan, 
beautiful views of the water, and race 
cars. 
As a Virginian, we have a NASCAR 
racetrack just on the line of my dis-
trict—I generally like to claim it. And 
Paul was scheduled before his diagnosis 
to come to Virginia for a race. And I 
just thought how hysterical is that for 
a man I used to talk hard policy issues 
and debate policy and disagree—some-
times very fervently—with is now 
going to be literally racing through my 
district—or just adjacent—in his race 
car. 
So I look forward to the time when 
Paul—because he is a fighter, regard-
less of any diagnosis—I think we know 
that he is intent on getting back in his 
race car, back to his farm, and cer-
tainly continuing to be engaged and fo-
cused. 
I look forward to the time when we 
could welcome him in Virginia for him 
to race around the track. I am unsure 
whether or not I may choose to enter 
into that vehicle with him, but I might 
stand on the sidelines and cheer. 
Mr. Speaker, Paul was an incredible 
friend. He was an incredibly good Mem-
ber of Congress, because at every mo-
ment, he just was focused on what was 
right. I know that is how he was in 
business, in his personal life before he 
came here. I know that is how he con-
tinues to be. 
Certainly, as a new Member of Con-
gress, witnessing someone who has al-
ways genuinely shown kindness and 
heart, every conversation he had here 
in the Halls of Congress was a great ex-
ample to me. I am so proud to have

served with him during his time in 
Congress, but far more than that, I am 
deeply honored to call Paul Mitchell a 
friend, a real friend, and deeply hon-
ored to know that he is someone who 
will always stand up for truth, who will 
always stand up for what is right, who 
will always stand up for his family, for 
his friends, and for his country. 
So my dear friend, I wish you the 
very best as you continue in your re-
covery. We are all thinking of you. I 
am so grateful for your friendship. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, in honor 
of Mr. Mitchell, we will now start 
going 
Democrat-Republican, 
Demo-
crat-Republican to demonstrate our bi-
partisanship. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. MEIJER). 
Mr. MEIJER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from the great State of 
Michigan, and I guess, I would thank 
Paul for all of the service he has given 
this body, has given our country, has 
given our State. 
The morning when I was supposed to 
first meet Paul, was the same morning 
that he announced that he was not run-
ning for reelection. He defined that 
spirit of making decisive moves. 
It is no secret that for the freshman 
class who have entered, the past 6 
months have been less than normal. I 
take the assurances of my colleagues, 
who have been in this body for many 
terms, that what we have seen so far 
has been atypical. But I cannot thank 
Paul enough for the example that he 
set, for the wisdom that he shared, and 
for his perennial, ever-blunt honesty. 
All too often people, especially poli-
ticians, can walk and dance and do a 
jig around the truth. And Paul was al-
ways incredibly clear about where he 
stood and what he believed. So I am 
grateful for the friendship that I have 
been able to develop with him as a 
freshman, and I look forward to many 
more of those moments. 
I want Paul and his family to know 
that he is in our prayers. My wife, 
Gabrielle, and I will keep him in our 
prayers. The challenges that he is deal-
ing with are being felt by too many, 
but I am proud to call him a friend as 
he continues to fight on. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. 
UPTON). 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for doing this, and I 
am sorry to sort of jump people in line, 
but we are in a committee markup, so 
I have to get back. 
Mr. Speaker, I have to say that my 
friend, Paul Mitchell, grew up the eld-
est of seven kids. Literally, a natural 
born leader of the pack. He was the 
first of his extended family to graduate 
from college. He has noted that his 
mom raised him to believe that those 
with talents and resources were ex-
pected by God to make a difference in 
the world. And by God, he did. 
Tenacious and focused like a laser 
beam, he set and met goals. A scrappy 
fighter, he has now met his most formi-
dable foe, that is for sure, and he is all 
in for that fight. 
And in a text that I got from him a 
little bit earlier today, he said, ‘‘as you 
know, I am one tough cuss.’’ 
Yes, Paul, you are. And you know 
what, everybody knows it—not only 
your Republican and Democratic col-
leagues, but certainly the former Presi-
dent, and probably all of your constitu-
ents back in Michigan as well. You are 
a tough cuss. 
Yesterday, 
my 
colleague, 
DIANA 
DEGETTE, and I introduced a discussion 
draft called 21st Century Cures 2.0. 
Mr. Speaker, 392 of us in this Cham-
ber, including Paul, voted for the 21st 
Century Cures enacted in 2016, which 
expedites the approval of new drugs. 
This bill that we are working on now, 
2.0, could well indeed speed the ap-
proval of new drugs even faster. So it 
indeed could be the very lifeline for 
Paul and so many like him—thousands 
of Americans and around the world— 
that somehow are impacted by this ter-
rible disease that we all want to sur-
vive. 
Paul’s life is characterized by exceed-
ing expectations, defying the odds. And 
we know that is what he intends to do 
now, for sure. And if anybody can, it is 
Paul. So we are with you, Paul—you 
may be watching—every step of the 
way. All of us. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
Paul’s farewell address that he stated 
back in July of 2019 as part of this trib-
ute. 
REPRESENTATIVE PAUL MITCHELL’S (MI–10) 
FLOOR REMARKS ON WEDNESDAY JULY 24, 2019 
Madam Speaker, America is an amazing 
place and we too often as Americans take 
that for granted. Opportunities exist in this 
country that simply aren’t available in much 
of the world. And my life is an example of 
the many possibilities in the United States 
of America. 
I ask you: Where else can a kid born into 
poverty, beginning life in a subsidized hous-
ing project, become a national legislator? 
Yet—here I stand as a Member of Congress. 
In how many countries can the oldest of 
seven children with parents that were an 
hourly autoworker and a Salvation Army of-
fice manager become the first in their ex-
tended family to graduate from college, 
build a career and become CEO of a major 
workforce development company and, after 
retiring, be elected to Congress? 
America is truly a unique and special place 
that we must love and respect with all our 
heart and soul. 
My mother raised me to believe that those 
with talents and/or resources were expected 
by God to make a difference in the world. I 
have tried to do that throughout my life. 
My mission for 35 years was to assist peo-
ple in identifying and securing career oppor-
tunities. My professional career allowed me 
to support my family while assisting adults 
of all ages and backgrounds develop skills to 
support their families and build careers. 
I assisted individuals ranging from laid off 
steel workers and autoworkers to long term 
public assistance recipients develop the 
skills they needed to secure a job and build 
a new career. 
I worked with individuals requiring lit-
eracy education or ESL and adults that had 
worked in the same job for years and sud-
denly found their jobs and industries had 
evaporated, and their lives turned upside 
down. 
I worked, in some way or another, with 
tens of thousands of people searching for as-
sistance in securing a job and a career path. 
I believed then, and I continue to believe, 
that most Americans find value and oppor-
tunity in working—sometimes they just need 
a hand and assistance to overcome adversity. 
I brought that passion and commitment to 
Washington. I was, and remain, committed 
to making a difference in the world. I lit-
erally approached being a Member of Con-
gress like my earlier career—full tilt and 
leaving no stone unturned to have a mean-
ingful impact, and to make a difference on 
issues where I could. 
It is an honor to stand on this floor, debate 
issues, and represent the people of Michi-
gan’s 10th Congressional District. I am proud 
to be among the 12,500 or so Americans that 
have had the privilege of serving in Congress. 
But I have also begun asking myself about 
making a difference for my family. My chil-
dren of all ages—but the youngest just nine 
years old—have accepted their dad traveling 
this country extensively, working a demand-
ing schedule, and frequently interrupting 
‘‘family time’’ with calls, emails and text 
messages. My spouse Sherry has been so sup-
portive and more patient than probably war-
ranted. 
A career in Washington has never been my 
objective. My objective has always been sim-
ply to work to address significant challenges 
this nation faces: health care, immigration, 
and infrastructure for example. 
However, it appears to me that rhetoric 
overwhelms policy, and politics consumes 
much of the oxygen in this city. 
The time has come to make a difference 
for my family—to focus my time and energy 
upon them—their needs and goals. 
As George Washington is quoted: ‘‘I would 
rather be on my farm than emperor of the 
world.’’ 
As a result—I have decided I will not seek 
to continue to represent Michigan’s 10th Dis-
trict next term. After serving out the re-
mainder of the 116th Congress—I will return 
to my family and our small farm.. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
ELISSA, again, for organizing this time 
for many of his friends that would like 
to say a few words tonight and push 
him forward to get to that finish line 
and come back. 
God bless you. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Ms. STEVENS). 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my 
colleague, 
Congresswoman 
SLOTKIN, for organizing this tribute 
session to our friend and former col-
league, Paul Mitchell. 
It is very symbolic of what it is like 
to be a member of the Michigan delega-
tion. There are 14 of us—7 Democrats, 7 
Republicans—representing a State of 
just a little over 10 million people. And 
yet, we come together time and time 
again to champion matters and issues 
for our State, whether it is the Great 
Lakes or veterans’ issues or our auto-
motive industry. 
Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we 
are doing here today. We are standing 
up for our friend who is in a fight—a 
fight against cancer. And we are doing 
it on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives, for this man loves the 
floor of the House of Representatives.

So there is no place more symbolic 
than this to tell Paul, ‘‘You have got 
this.’’ 
Sherry, you have got this. And to 
your kids, who I know you love dearly, 
we are standing by you every step of 
the way. 
b 1800 
Paul was certainly a champion not 
only for the legislative process and the 
business of doing government right by 
people, but he was a champion for 
Michigan. And if you hear his words, if 
he has talked about his experience, his 
recent diagnosis, you hear Paul saying: 
This was a gift from God. This was a 
gift from God. 
Even when it got scary, because he is 
getting a little bit more of life. He is 
getting more of a chance to continue to 
push and to stand up for what he knows 
he has worked his life for, which is the 
creation of his wonderful family, and 
being in the State he loves so dearly. 
Paul, I will just tell you, I have so 
many fond memories of you. I have 
fond memories from learning from you 
on this very floor. I have fond memo-
ries of being at Chrysler with you, 
which was really exciting for a first- 
term Congresswoman to be alongside 
you, seeing the new vehicles, and hav-
ing discussions with the workforce at 
Chrysler in my district, but I know you 
have many Chrysler employees in the 
Michigan 10th District as well. 
So those are the memories and those 
are the things that we celebrate with 
your service and also with your contin-
ued dedication. So it is a real privilege 
and honor to be here with my col-
leagues, telling you, Paul: You have 
got this, you are going to keep going, 
and we are going to keep fighting an-
other day. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
REED). 
Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I truly 
thank my colleague for organizing this 
Special Order this evening for our 
friend Paul Mitchell. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
come 
here 
this 
evening with no prepared remarks 
other than to make some comments, as 
shared by my colleagues about this 
great man. 
Paul Mitchell is truly a friend. Paul 
Mitchell is someone I have gotten to 
know over the years here in Congress, 
and watched him develop in his own 
right. I watched him become a very se-
rious and astute legislator. I watched 
him join the Problem Solvers Caucus 
that we started, and many of the col-
leagues have talked about the Problem 
Solvers Caucus. 
Paul came to us from leadership, and 
in that process he did some things, be-
cause that is a very special club, and 
we have some very special rules and 
commitments to each other. In order 
to fulfill those commitments and those 
terms of honor in serving in that cau-
cus with our colleagues, he dem-
onstrated publicly, privately, and to 
our fellow members of the Problem 
Solvers Caucus what it means to be an 
honorable Member of Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I will tell you, for that, 
I was forever grateful to have been in a 
position to encourage Paul to join the 
Problem Solvers Caucus. And he, in 
particular, one day exhibited that very 
limited leadership quality that is so 
lacking here in the United States 
House of Representatives today, in my 
opinion. He showed true courage, true 
statesmanship, true leadership. 
I just have to tell you, Paul, as we 
got the news about your diagnosis—and 
I am speaking to you directly here 
from the floor, Paul—we all imme-
diately came to your side. We all, im-
mediately in our thoughts, in our pray-
ers, in our bond of friendship, stood 
with you and your family. And we are 
standing with you and your family as 
you go through this next chapter of 
your life, and please know that you are 
not alone. 
To you and to your family, as a Mem-
ber of this body, as a member of the 
Problem Solvers Caucus, as a member 
serving your country, as a great cit-
izen, we all stand with you and your 
family as you go through this ordeal 
that you face. 
That being said, I join with my col-
leagues in saying, We know Paul 
Mitchell. We know your heart, Paul. 
We know your tenacity and your perse-
verance. And we know you are going to 
get through this, and you are going to 
get through this in a way only Paul 
Mitchell can get through it. 
So as we come here today to give 
some fine words on behalf of you, Paul, 
and on behalf of your family, know we 
are also sending more than words. We 
are sending our shoulders to cry upon; 
our shoulders to lean upon; and, as you 
have exhibited over the years, even a 
shoulder to laugh upon during this dif-
ficult time. 
And it is those lessons of life that 
you taught me, serving with you here 
in the House, that you cannot take life 
too seriously; that life is too short. 
That is why, as my colleagues noted, 
Paul retired to be with his young fam-
ily and his other children, to make 
sure 
that 
he 
kept 
his 
priorities 
straight. 
And you did, Paul. You put your fam-
ily, you put your health, and you put 
your future first in regards to the time 
of your life to make that decision to 
retire from this body. 
So I am just humbled to be here with 
my colleagues. I truly thank my col-
leagues on the Democratic side and on 
the Republican side for coming here to-
night to honor one of our best from the 
U.S. House of Representatives, Paul, 
and that is you. And for that, we will 
be forever grateful to be able to call 
you a friend; a colleague; and, in the 
end, a survivor. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. REED for those heartfelt words. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS), an-
other member of the Problem Solvers 
Caucus. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Michigan and all 
my friends for this Special Order hour. 
Paul, you might not know this, but 
you are an important mentor of mine, 
one of the most important mentors I 
have had in my brief career in this 
Chamber. You represent the very most 
precious and sometimes rare of at-
tributes in the U.S. Congress, and that 
is principle. 
You are a man of principle at a time 
when our country needs that and you 
more than ever. You are a man of great 
intelligence and success and decency 
and empathy and honesty and integ-
rity. 
I remember my first conversation 
with Paul, we were speaking about 
higher education. And it was that con-
versation that reminded me that we 
can learn so much more from people of 
different perspectives than we do from 
those who are cut from the same cloth. 
And when Paul made the difficult but 
very principled decision to become an 
Independent at the end of his career 
here in Congress, he wrote a letter to 
the House Clerk to announce the 
change in affiliation, and the last line 
of the letter read: ‘‘While admittedly 
symbolic, we all know that symbols 
matter. We all know that symbols mat-
ter.’’ 
And when you retired from Congress, 
Paul, you said: ‘‘I can’t begin to ex-
press to you how difficult it is to say 
something like ‘I am done’ because I 
have never been done before.’’ 
And let me tell you, my friend, you 
are not done yet, and we sure as heck 
are not done with you. We love you, 
Paul, and America joins me in sending 
our love to you and yours as well. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. PHILLIPS for his heartfelt words. 
In conclusion, Paul, as you can imag-
ine, we, of course, had our schedule 
changed 12 different times today. There 
are many, many more of our colleagues 
who are submitting official notes for 
the RECORD, and who are stuck in var-
ious places and will reach out directly. 
But to you and your family, for the 
legacy that you left in this place, 
please know that we see you, we recog-
nize you, we believe in your will to 
fight, and we are behind you 100 per-
cent. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
for joining on both sides of the aisle. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman, and I wouldn’t have 
missed this. 
We have an Energy and Commerce 
markup that continues on. 
I guess through the chair to Paul, I 
wouldn’t miss the opportunity to en-
courage you, and express through the 
chair, Paul, my deep appreciation for 
you as a friend, as a colleague, as a 
fighter. 
Though I have not heard all the com-
ments of my colleagues, I am sure that 
they have said to you: We love you. We 
are pulling for you, for Sherry, for the

family. We are in your corner. But we 
also know that you are the one who has 
to fight this; and friends sometimes 
feel that, in a very unique way, it is a 
helpless feeling. 
As we think about you and pray for 
you, and as a co-chairman of the Con-
gressional Prayer Caucus, you probably 
ought to expect that I am praying for 
you, and I will. I am praying that God 
will give you strength, patience, endur-
ance, and even a joy in the process of 
what you are modeling to your family 
as you go through this. 
I know you are a tough guy. We have 
had our verbal battles together all the 
time, and I am not even going to admit 
today that you may have won on a few 
occasions. I know that you race cars, 
and you race cars not to lose, and you 
race cars to take that victory lap after 
you went through the checker flag. 
And right now we are expecting you to 
race, to give it your absolute best, to 
use all the resources necessary to con-
tinue on because your life is important 
to your family, to your friends, and to 
those of us who look on. 
If we admit, though you are going 
through a physical challenge that none 
of us are going through right now, but 
in the reality of life, none of us on the 
floor right here now have any more 
certainty about any longer time given 
to us than you have. I might not make 
it tomorrow. So it is important that we 
buy up the day that we have. And my 
prayers are that you are doing that in 
the challenges that you face, Paul, in 
the disappointments, in the discourage-
ments that come, and the dark hours 
at night. 
Yet there is someone. And I am not 
saying this to you simply because I am 
a preacher, even though I have gone to 
the dark side. I am saying it to you be-
cause my relationship with the Savior 
makes it possible for me to look to the 
future, whatever that future means, 
with hope, with certainty. The Jesus 
who I hope is a spirit I exude to my col-
leagues, my friends, my neighbors, and 
to you tonight, Paul, is the same one 
who said: I come that you might have 
life and have it abundantly. 
He is the same one who came to die 
for each of us and understands our 
needs. He is the same one who said: I 
am the resurrection and the life. He 
that believes in me, though he die—and 
we all will—yet shall he live. For who-
soever lives and believes in me shall 
never abide in death. 
That is an eternal thing. And, Paul, 
you and I have talked about those spir-
itual things as well. Pull on to your 
faith. You and Sherry pull on that 
faith. Let it strengthen you. Let it en-
courage you. Let the loving, loving 
Savior who gave himself for you and 
me and everyone give you the strength 
to battle on, to go on that racetrack of 
challenge and whatever, to find a cer-
tainty that in Him there is an eternity, 
there is an eternity that begins here 
and now. 
Paul, we love you. I love you. I will 
be praying for you. I am counting on 
you to do everything you can. I am 
counting on your family to be blessed 
because of the example you are setting. 
But I am also saying to you that we are 
going to keep on supporting you. God 
bless you, brother. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. WALBERG for those kind words. 
Paul, I hope you know the strength 
that we are sending you, all of us on 
both sides of the aisle. We feel it, we 
have been talking about you and Sher-
ry and the kids constantly. And we 
hope that from our convening on you, 
you feel that strength and the power to 
fight back and beat this thing. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

REPUBLICANS ARE ADDRESSING 
THE MAJOR CRISES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. GIMENEZ) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, during 
our time tonight, my colleagues and I 
will address the major crises happening 
here at home and happening abroad. 
Our message tonight will all have a 
consistent theme: House Republicans 
are leading the fight, whether it is pro-
tecting the Hyde amendment, taking 
action to fix President Biden’s eco-
nomic crisis, or holding China account-
able for the COVID–19 coverup once and 
for all. 
On the last point, the time has come 
for Congress to take seriously its job to 
hold China accountable for their role in 
the proliferation of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. This pandemic has killed over 
600,000 Americans, ruined the American 
economy, forced into closure many 
people’s livelihoods, and destabilized 
our way of life. 
Just as we did in the aftermath of 9/ 
11 and in response to the Great Reces-
sion, Speaker PELOSI
and her col-
leagues on her side of the aisle cannot 
abdicate Congress’ constitutional re-
sponsibility to investigate the origins 
of COVID–19 and the roles both the Chi-
nese Communist Party and the World 
Health Organization played in pre-
venting an expeditious global response. 
A March 2020 report by the Univer-
sity of Southampton found that if 
interventions in China could have been 
conducted 1, 2, or 3 weeks earlier, then 
cases could have been reduced by 66 
percent, 86 percent, and 95 percent, re-
spectively. That is inexcusable. 
Luckily for the American people, Re-
publican Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY and 
House Republicans have a plan to hold 
China accountable and ensure an atroc-
ity such as the CCP virus never hap-
pens again. 
The American people deserve trans-
parency. That is why Congress must 
declassify information related to the 
origins of COVID–19. Yes, that includes 
any report that comes from President 
Biden’s recent requests. 
For far too long, the government has 
allowed individuals with known ties to 
the CCP or Chinese state-owned enter-
prises to benefit from American re-
search and innovation. That is why we 
must continue to pursue policies that 
curb any gains made by the Chinese 
Communist Party. 
It is also time for Congress to pro-
hibit the National Institutes of Health 
or any entity that receives grants and 
funding from NIH from conducting re-
search or spending resources on re-
search with malicious foreign actors. 
This includes China. Our taxpayer dol-
lars should not be going into arming 
our adversaries. 
Foreign policy is a crucial element in 
holding China accountable. Congress 
must compel the administration to flex 
its foreign policy posture and reform 
the World Health Organization. As 
more information comes forward, it is 
evident that the WHO was complicit in 
China’s coverup of the exploding pan-
demic. Their negligence is directly re-
sponsible for the loss of millions of 
lives. We need trusted actors such as 
Taiwan to form part of the organiza-
tion. 
In keeping in line with a tough for-
eign policy stance, Congress must im-
plement a new round of tough and de-
liberate sanctions on anyone—whether 
they are Chinese nationals with ties to 
the CPP or high-level executives at the 
World Health Organization—who will-
fully participated in the coverup of the 
COVID–19 pandemic and helped prevent 
a robust global response. Millions of 
lives are on their hands. 
Another tool at our disposal is for 
Congress to pass the resolution intro-
duced by my Florida colleague, Con-
gressman MICHAEL WALTZ, and Senator 
RICK SCOTT to prevent Beijing from 
hosting the Winter Olympics. 
Finally, we need to allow them to sue 
the Chinese Communist Party and any 
CCP official who participated in the 
coverup that killed over half a million 
Americans. They deserve no sovereign 
immunity. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to do 
our jobs and join Leader MCCARTHY and 
the 
House 
Republicans 
in 
holding 
China accountable, holding our adver-
saries accountable, and ensuring an 
atrocity such as this never happens 
again.

duce the Congressman from Texas, 
Congressman VAN
TAYLOR. Congress-
man VAN TAYLOR is a decorated Iraq

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3072 
June 23, 2021 
War veteran and an important member 
of the Financial Services Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. TAYLOR). 
Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Florida’s 26th Dis-
trict for yielding. 
On the heels of a global pandemic, 
which crippled small businesses and 
hurt workers, President Biden has of-
fered a budget that doesn’t address the 
problems that we so desperately con-
front as Americans. 
There is not any additional funding 
for border security at a time right now 
when our border is in crisis, despite the 
fact that this budget has the highest 
sustained tax burden and is the largest 
budget ever in the history of this coun-
try. It is the largest budget to ever be 
before this body. 
The prescription in that budget is ex-
actly the opposite of where we need to 
be going. As our economy comes out of 
the fits and starts of recovering from 
COVID, this threatens to overheat even 
further our economy. 
We know our economy is overheated. 
Let me give you a couple of examples. 
Since May 2020, home prices have in-
creased by almost 13 percent. Used car 
and truck prices are up over 20 percent. 
Lumber prices are up over 300 percent. 
Cold rolled steel has gone from $630 a 
ton to $1,450 a ton. 
Our economy is overheated. The last 
thing we need is the massive $55 tril-
lion of taxes and spending that is in 
the budget today in front of this body. 
You heard me correctly, Mr. Speaker, 
$55 trillion directly from the pockets of 
Americans who are already struggling 
to pay these higher gas prices and to 
pay for higher prices for groceries. This 
is all a result of President Biden’s mis-
guided fiscal policies. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my Democrat 
colleagues to please reconsider your 
support for Biden’s broken budgeting 
methods. In the great State of Texas, 
small businesses and families live with-
in their means. We must do the same. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my esteemed colleague from Texas for 
his great words. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from the 22nd District of Texas (Mr. 
NEHLS), who is a veteran law enforce-
ment officer. 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to highlight some of the stated 
goals of the INVEST in America Act. 
The INVEST in America Act creates 
and sustains good-paying jobs, restores 
global competitiveness, tackles cli-
mate change, modernizes infrastruc-
ture, and spurs long-term economic 
growth. 
These are laudable goals that most if 
not all of us here support. However, 
Mr. Speaker, when you focus on the 
rail title, the INVEST in America Act 
misses on all of those marks and, in 
fact, has the potential to turn back the 
clocks on our envy-of-the-world freight 
rail system. 
Freight railroads provide excellent, 
high-paying jobs, with a Class 1 freight 
employee’s 
compensation 
averaging 
$132,000 per year. 
On competitiveness, the freight rail 
industry met the demands of our Na-
tion during the pandemic by never 
closing and continually moving the 
goods we needed to preserve public 
health. They did all of it, I might add, 
without asking for any bailout money. 
On the environment, freight railroads 
are also the most fuel-efficient way to 
move freight over land. On average, 
railroads move 1 ton of freight more 
than 480 miles on 1 gallon of fuel. 
On modern infrastructure, unlike the 
rest of our Nation’s transportation sys-
tem, our freight rail system receives 
the highest grade from the civil engi-
neers for their infrastructure, a B. 
On economic opportunity, freight 
rail’s economic impact in 2017 alone 
manifested itself in over 1.1 million 
jobs, $219 billion in economic output, 
$71 billion in wages, and nearly $26 bil-
lion in total tax revenues. 
The freight railroads can meet all of 
these goals because the railroads, not 
the American taxpayers, spend the $25 
billion annually needed to improve and 
maintain their infrastructure. Private 
companies are simply better custodians 
of infrastructure networks than the 
Federal Government, and we should be 
utilizing that simple reality, not be-
moaning it. 
While President Biden, Secretary 
Buttigieg, and Chairman DEFAZIO regu-
larly profess their love for trains, the 
truth is that it only extends to the 
highly subsidized passenger version. 
The INVEST in America Act spends 
almost $100 billion on Amtrak. Amtrak 
ridership was already collapsing out-
side of the Northeast Corridor before 
COVID. Where passenger rail makes 
sense, private companies like Virgin 
Trains are building new passenger 
lines. 
The rail title couldn’t include provi-
sions to accelerate the deployment of 
new safety technologies on freight rail 
but ensures that French toast will be 
served on every Amtrak train. It does 
nothing to expand freight rail service 
by moving new and in-demand products 
like liquefied natural gas but will pay 
to roll empty Amtrak trains through 
new parts of the country. 
If Amtrak is so good and deserves an 
850 percent funding increase from the 
previous rail title, I challenge everyone 
voting for the INVEST in America Act 
to use Amtrak instead of an airline the 
next time you need to head from your 
district to the Capitol. 
This rail title is too expensive, too 
damaging to the economy, and too par-
tisan to pass. However, it is not too 
late to work together. 
I introduced an amendment to the 
Rules Committee to strike the entire 
rail title. The base text is simply too 
flawed to fix, and we must do better. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor to introduce the Congressman 
from California, MIKE
GARCI´A. Con-
gressman GARCI´A flew over 30 combat 
missions during Operation Iraqi Free-
dom as a naval aviator. We thank him 
for his service. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. GARCI´A). 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to call on Con-
gress and the Biden administration to 
hold China accountable for its role in 
the COVID–19 pandemic. The evidence 
suggests that this virus, like too many 
other things in the world, was made in 
China. 
Despite the growing evidence sur-
rounding China’s lack of transparency 
and mishandling of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, House Democrats continue to 
stonewall Republican efforts to inves-
tigate the origins of COVID–19. Repub-
licans have made numerous calls for 
the need to investigate the origins of 
COVID and hold China accountable, 
but the majority has yet to hold a sin-
gle hearing on it. 
This is shameful. Americans deserve 
transparency, and they deserve an-
swers. We must hold China accountable 
for its coverup of this deadly virus that 
has taken the lives of 3.8 million hu-
mans 
worldwide, 
including 
600,000 
American lives. 
Under the Trump administration, we 
had an investigation in place to inves-
tigate the origins of COVID–19, but 
that necessary investigation was ended 
by this Biden administration. Instead 
of holding our adversaries accountable, 
the current administration is bowing 
down to them. They have chosen a 
strategy of appeasement rather than 
accountability. 
If America wants to remain a leader 
on the global stage and if we want to 
remain a safe and secure nation, then 
we must hold China and other adver-
saries absolutely accountable. 
My Republican colleagues and I stand 
ready to work across the aisle to de-
liver the transparency and answers 
that Americans deserve. I hope that 
our colleagues across the aisle will join 
us in our efforts. 
b 1830 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, GLENN 
GROTHMAN from Wisconsin is an experi-
enced legislator in Wisconsin and a 
United States Congressman. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
As we turn on the news every night 
and we think again and again about all 
of the changes to America that have 
happened in the last 4 months, it is so 
easy to just focus on the border or 
focus on the inflation or focus on the 
constant drumbeat that America is a 
horrible, racist nation. And by doing 
so, we forget the huge changes we have 
had in American law and American 
funding that affect the number of abor-
tions that happen not only in the 
United States, but around the world. 
It is hard to believe that throughout 
most of this country’s history, even be-
fore ultrasounds were invented, the 
consensus in this country was that 
abortion was horrific; it was murder.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3073 
June 23, 2021 
What have we done in the last few 
months? 
First of all, we have repealed the 
Mexico City policy so that funds are 
once again going to organizations 
abroad that don’t directly but indi-
rectly fund abortions. 
Secondly, we have overturned Presi-
dent Trump’s Protect Life rule, which 
will reopen Title X Family Planning 
funding for Planned Parenthood. We 
believe that under this, Planned Par-
enthood has received $60 million a 
year, which not only, in part, goes to 
fund abortions, but also goes to fund an 
organization that is designed to en-
courage or change America’s tradi-
tional dislike of abortion. 
We are restoring funding to the U.N. 
Population Fund, which supported Chi-
na’s birth limit law, and is also pros-
elytizing for abortion. 
In the latest attack on unborn babies 
and 
pro-life 
Americans, 
President 
Biden released a fiscal year 2022 budget 
that removes the Hyde amendment, the 
longstanding provision that prohibits 
Federal funding of abortions. 
We don’t believe this is what Ameri-
cans want. The vast majority of Ameri-
cans do not support taxpayer funding 
of abortion. So much for the unity that 
President Biden promised us. 
There is, over time, more and more 
scientific literature that demonstrates 
unborn babies can feel pain at a very 
earlier gestational age, at the 15-week- 
old gestational age. So much for 
science. This is pro-abortion extre-
mism. We can start by making the 
Hyde amendment permanent by pass-
ing H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding 
for Abortion Act. 
Mr. 
GIMENEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
couldn’t agree more with the gen-
tleman about the Hyde amendment. I 
think 
the 
majority 
of 
Americans 
couldn’t agree with the gentleman 
more about the Hyde amendment. We 
need to maintain that the majority of 
Americans do not want to fund tax-
payer-funded abortions. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Congressman 
JOHN 
ROSE from Tennessee is an eighth-gen-
eration farmer and a key member of 
the Financial Services Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Rep-
resentative GIMENEZ for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise before you to-
night to speak on behalf of those who 
cannot speak for themselves. The right 
to life is one of the founding principles 
of our Nation. Every human being born 
or unborn is entitled to life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness. 
Our government was created to se-
cure these rights without exception, 
not to take them away. Yet, today, we 
see this right under attack as the 
Biden administration continues their 
war on the unborn by seeking to re-
move the Hyde amendment, a long-
standing pro-life protection that has 
saved 2.5 million lives from abortion 
since 1976. 
As a father of two sons, Guy and 
Sam, I have been blessed to watch 
them grow from a tiny dot on a med-
ical monitor to the strong and healthy 
boys they are today. When I look at my 
sons, I am crestfallen for the millions 
and millions of children whose lives 
have been cruelly taken right as they 
were beginning. 
Not too long ago, President Joe 
Biden stated: ‘‘Those of us who are op-
posed to abortion should not be com-
pelled to pay for it.’’ 
But this proposed budget fails to in-
clude the Hyde amendment, making it 
clear that President Biden does not 
value life. Before coming to Wash-
ington, I vowed to be unapologetically 
pro-life. 
I stand before you tonight because I, 
along with most of my fellow Ten-
nesseans, disagree with this adminis-
tration and believe taxpayer dollars 
should never be used to fund abortions. 
Societies are measured by how they 
treat their most vulnerable. That in-
cludes the unborn. This is why it sick-
ens me to see the Biden administra-
tion’s intention to use the power of the 
Federal Government to force us to sup-
port and fund organizations that per-
form abortions. 
I thank God for the miracle that is 
life, and I will work to secure a chance 
at life for every unborn baby so that we 
may hear their voice, see their poten-
tial, and give them the same basic op-
portunity at living that we have se-
cured and received ourselves. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his comments. 
Congressman GLENN THOMPSON from 
Pennsylvania is the ranking member of 
the 
Agriculture 
Committee. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON and I share a common expe-
rience as former firefighters. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON), a 
Congressman and a former firefighter. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my brother fire-
fighter for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address 
the importance of the Hyde amend-
ment. 
In the Declaration of Independence, 
Thomas 
Jefferson 
penned 
three 
unalienable rights: life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness. 
As Members of Congress, it is our job 
to uphold those rights, and that can 
start with protecting the Hyde amend-
ment. For over 40 years, the Hyde 
amendment has maintained bipartisan 
support and passed through Congress. 
Even President Joe Biden, then-Sen-
ator Joe Biden, supported this amend-
ment. 
The Hyde amendment ensures that 
Americans are not forced to pay for 
abortions with their tax dollars. But 
this year, the Hyde amendment is 
under attack. The current administra-
tion budget proposal calls for the Hyde 
amendment to be removed from the fis-
cal year 2022 budget. This is radical, 
even for Democrats. 
The Hyde amendment saves lives. 
Since its original introduction, nearly 
2.5 million lives have been saved from 
abortion. With nearly 60 percent of 
Americans agreeing that taxpayer dol-
lars should not be used to fund abor-
tions, we must keep the Hyde amend-
ment in the fiscal year 2022 budget and 
beyond. 
For these reasons, I am proud to be 
an original cosponsor of H.R. 18, the No 
Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. 
This bill would make the Hyde amend-
ment permanent and governmentwide. 
Mr. Speaker, we know life begins at 
conception. That is why we must stand 
up and continue to fight for the un-
born. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. THOMPSON for his comments. 
Mr. Speaker, Congressman SCOTT 
PERRY from Pennsylvania retired as a 
brigadier general in the Army and now 
represents the people of Pennsylvania’s 
10th District. I thank the gentleman 
for his service. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. GIMENEZ for being here and invit-
ing us. 
Over the past year and a half, the 
American people have endured a na-
tionwide pandemic and its impact on 
every aspect of all of our lives. More 
than 600,000 Americans have died, and 
their families have suffered the im-
measurable grief of that. This was all 
preventable. 
The Communist Party is directly re-
sponsible. I don’t know why we can’t 
say it. I don’t know why we can’t look 
into it. Our economy was devastated 
and lives were crushed; things that can 
never be gotten back. People lost jobs. 
People lost their dreams. It can’t be 
gotten back. 
It is going to take our economy years 
to rebuild. Americans want answers 
and they deserve answers. I don’t un-
derstand why the majority party here 
doesn’t want to investigate this. They 
want to investigate everything else, 
but they are not interested in this. 
Let me tell you what we know. In No-
vember of 2019, scientists at the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology came down with a 
sickness consistent with COVID–19. We 
know that the World Health Organiza-
tion’s initial report—and I say initial 
because it was so politically charged, 
they had to come up with another 
one—China maintained sole authority 
of those investigating it. 
Oh, by the way, 60 of the people who 
were 
investigating 
it 
weren’t 
sci-
entists. Somehow we trust them, but 
we can’t have our own investigations. 
The 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party 
is 
guilty of obstruction of evidence. It is 
clear. It is clear. 
Now, while the majority has denied 
calls for an investigation, continuing 
the cult of fear—and let me talk to you 
about the cult of fear. Remember when 
touching a doorknob was supposed to 
give you the virus? 
You couldn’t shake hands. You had 
to buy as much toilet paper and water 
as you could because you couldn’t go to 
the store. You couldn’t visit your loved

ones. And heaven forbid your kids go to 
school. And even today, when we want 
our kids to go to school, we are told we 
are terrorists and science deniers. 
Let’s stop the cult of fear. Let’s stop 
it. Let’s get the majority party, let’s 
beseech the majority party to open an 
investigation because the American 
people deserve to know the origins of 
this virus. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the Congressman for his comments. I 
couldn’t agree with him more. My 
opening statements were about China 
and their complicity, and we do need to 
investigate China and the World Health 
Organization and find out what did 
they know and when did they know it. 
Again, as I said, if we had known about 
this 1, 2, or 3 weeks earlier, we could 
have saved an incredible number of 
lives. 
Mr. Speaker, Congressman MICHAEL 
CLOUD represents the 13th District of 
Texas and is the only Texas Republican 
on the Agriculture Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. CLOUD). 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate being here, and I thank the gen-
tleman for leading this. This is such an 
important topic. 
We have seen ourselves in the last 
year and a half go from the greatest 
economy the world has ever seen to 
very perilous times for the American 
people. 
Some of it not of our choosing; some 
of it, unfortunately, of our choosing. 
About a year and a half ago I would 
ask in virtually every meeting I went 
to in my district throughout Texas, I 
would ask every industry: What is your 
biggest problem right now? 
And they would tell us: We can’t find 
enough people. 
Now, the reason was very different a 
year and a half ago than it is today. I 
get the same answer, but for very dif-
ferent reasons. A year and a half ago 
the economy was doing so good. Busi-
nesses were booming. We were hiring. 
Wages were growing across every de-
mographic. Now it is because we are 
paying people to stay home. 
This is an attack against the Amer-
ican worker, against the American 
economy, against the American work 
ethic that took us from struggling 
Colonies to an amazing, amazing influ-
ence on the world stage, to the greatest 
economy ever in all of humanity. 
Now, what is really troubling is to 
see the attack against the American 
worker that this administration has 
chosen to pick out, certain industries 
that were very strong for us, particu-
larly the energy industry. We have 
seen pipelines shut down here, while 
pipelines are encouraged to be built in 
our adversarial nations. We have seen 
this push toward green energy so that 
we can buy solar panels from China, 
while China continues to build hun-
dreds of coal power plants. 
So this, obviously, isn’t about the en-
vironment. This is about destabilizing 
the economy here at home, while we 
empower adversarial nations abroad. 
Recently, I was at the border. And we 
funded border infrastructure in the last 
administration. 
But 
now 
we 
have 
stopped it, even though the contract is 
already signed, and we won’t even con-
tinue the contracts enough to plug in 
the lights that are already built at the 
border. 
What is going on at the border is 
wreaking 
havoc 
on 
communities 
throughout our States and throughout 
this Nation. 
We talk also about China and the 
devastating impact they have had on 
the coronavirus. We need to investigate 
that. This administration needs to step 
up and investigate that. There was 
some talk some time ago about how 
Fauci had sent money to the Wuhan 
lab and whether or not that was fund-
ing gain-of-function research or not. 
Whether or not it was, what in the 
world are we doing sending money to a 
Wuhan lab when China is the number 
one thief? 
They steal more intellectual prop-
erty than any other nation-state from 
us. 
We can make America work. America 
works when we support the American 
worker. Let’s get back to doing that. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman CLOUD for his comments. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Congressman 
JOHN 
JOYCE of Pennsylvania is part of the 
Doctors Caucus and has worked with 
the U.S. Navy at Naval Hospital Ports-
mouth in Virginia during Operations 
Desert Shield and Desert Storm. I 
thank the gentleman for his service. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, my commitment to life is 
rooted in the unequivocal truth that 
every person is created in the image 
and likeness of God. As a father and a 
grandfather, I can tell you that there is 
no greater gift than new life. 
As a doctor, I can tell you that 
science confirms what we have known 
for centuries. Every unborn child is a 
person 
deserving 
of 
fundamental 
rights. During the span of my own 
medical career, I have witnessed re-
markable 
innovation. 
With 
today’s 
technology, there can be no doubt that 
a child in the womb is a living person. 
Despite this evidence, Democrats are 
mounting unprecedented attacks on 
pro-life protections. First, President 
Biden repealed the Mexico City policy. 
Then House Democrats blocked the 
Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protec-
tion Act. Now they are attempting to 
repeal the Hyde amendment, which 
bans Federal funds from being used to 
pay for abortion services. 
b 1845 
Since 1976, this key protection has 
been attached to all legislation passed 
in Congress, preventing American tax-
payers from funding abortion against 
their will. 
It is wholly reprehensible to require 
pro-life Americans to pay for abortion 
against their conscience. As Congress 
considers appropriations legislation, I 
urge my colleagues to dispense with 
their attack on the longstanding Hyde 
amendment. 
To uphold the dignity of human life, 
we must preserve this protection. It is 
simple: The Hyde amendment saves 
lives. 
Despite the challenges ahead, we 
must persevere in this fight. As we 
read in Romans 12: ‘‘Do not be over-
come by evil, but overcome evil with 
good.’’ 
Our enduring commitment to protect 
image-bearers and defend the sanctity 
of human life will prevail. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, who 
would know better about protecting 
life and saving life than the good doc-
tor from Pennsylvania and my col-
league, Congressman JOHN JOYCE. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. HILL), who has led 
a distinguished career in business and 
public service and serves as a member 
of the Financial Services Committee. 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend and appreciate him calling us to-
gether tonight to talk about the mis-
takes that President Biden is making, 
the crises that his policies are brewing 
across a number of areas. 
Tonight, I rise, Mr. Speaker, to ad-
dress the state of our economic future. 
In the wake of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, Congress came together last 
year on a bipartisan basis and targeted 
relief to provide for families and hard-
working Americans. 
Now, as vaccines are distributed and 
Americans are returning to work, the 
Biden administration is spending an 
unprecedented amount of money in an 
untargeted way. Six trillion dollars, 
Mr. Speaker, and $6 trillion of deficits 
for 10 years to come. They are funding 
a manic, untargeted wish list that, in 
my view, is going to impoverish our 
kids and grandkids and contribute to 
too many dollars chasing too few 
goods. 
When you combine this fiscal policy 
with the Federal Reserve buying of $120 
billion 
of 
Government 
debt 
every 
month, you are brewing inflation, Mr. 
Speaker. In my view, inflation is just a 
tax on hardworking Americans trying 
to save for retirement, trying to save 
money for kids in college, trying to 
buy the necessities of gas, food, build a 
new home, add onto a home; and this 
inflation is a tax on working Ameri-
cans. Joe Biden and his illiterate eco-
nomic policy, both in monetary policy 
and fiscal policy, are contributors. 
Mr. Speaker, Republicans have a bet-
ter way. We have a better way to tar-
get spending, balance our budget, and 
not impoverish our kids and grandkids. 
If Republicans take this House back, 
Mr. Speaker, we will get our economic 
house in order. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. MEUSER), who comes from a fam-
ily dedicated to public service. He 
serves as a member of the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee and the Education and 
Labor Committee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3075 
June 23, 2021 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, we are 
here with over 600,000 American fatali-
ties from the COVID virus. 
Anyone who referred to the COVID 
virus as the China virus, or originating 
in Wuhan, has been somewhat ridiculed 
along the way. Yet, the evidence con-
tinues to mount that the origins of the 
virus were certainly from Wuhan and 
very likely from the Wuhan virology 
lab. 
Leader MCCARTHY recently put out 
eight pillars of action, an action plan, 
for what we, in a bipartisan manner, as 
Americans, should mandate, should re-
quire, should pursue. 
The first, number one, is declassifica-
tion of intelligence; bringing trans-
parency to U.S. intelligence about 
what China knew about the virus, 
about its origins, and when they knew 
it. 
Number two, prohibit the dangerous 
gain of function research in and with 
China. 
Number three, prohibition on the Na-
tional Institutes of Health that are 
funding adversarial foreign govern-
ments. We need to ensure American tax 
dollars don’t fund foreign governments 
intent on harming the U.S. and our al-
lies. 
Number four, an overhaul of the 
World Health Organization and coun-
terintelligence 
investigation. 
Trans-
parency and clear understanding of the 
inner workings of the World Health Or-
ganization is what Americans and the 
world are demanding. 
Number five, utilizing existing au-
thorities to perform investigations and 
launch independent investigations of 
COVID’s origins. 
Number six, visa restrictions and 
sanctions on any agency or individual 
who there is evidence to show was in-
volved in any form of coverup or mis-
leading of the general public when it 
comes to COVID’s origins. 
Number seven, yes, waive Chinese 
sovereign immunity; allow families of 
COVID victims to sue China for any 
damages. 
And, unless the above is met, we relo-
cate the 2022 Olympics from China. The 
world cannot gather in China for peace-
ful games when we have strong evi-
dence to believe that this virus origi-
nated in Wuhan and was covered up. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank my colleague from Pennsylva-
nia’s 13th District for those strong 
words and strong ideas on why we need 
to hold the people accountable who un-
leashed this horrific virus on the 
United States and the world at large. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Illinois (Mrs. MILLER), 
who is a farmer, a business manager, 
and a member of the Agriculture Com-
mittee and Education and Labor Com-
mittee. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, the Biden administration is pro-
moting its American Jobs Plan as an 
infrastructure proposal. In reality, it is 
just a tax-and-spend package that has 
little to do with actual infrastructure. 
We can all agree that the Nation’s in-
frastructure is a key component to a 
well-functioning 
economy. 
However, 
Democrats are disguising a liberal wish 
list of big government programs as in-
frastructure. 
Of the $2.25 trillion in total spending, 
only 5 percent is going to go toward 
traditional 
road 
infrastructure 
projects. 
The Biden administration is labeling 
everything they propose as infrastruc-
ture in an attempt to deceive the 
American people into thinking that 
they are talking about roads and 
bridges. 
Our constituents deserve an honest 
accounting of what Congress proposes 
to do with their hard-earned tax dol-
lars. 
President Biden’s infrastructure plan 
is not about infrastructure; it is about 
growing the size and power of the Fed-
eral Government. 
This plan is fiscally irresponsible, 
and it adds to the massive debt burden 
that we are leaving our children and 
grandchildren. We should mourn over 
what we are leaving our children and 
grandchildren. 
The American people deserve better. 
Mr. 
GIMENEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
couldn’t 
agree 
with 
the 
Congress-
woman more. As a father and a grand-
father, it is atrocious, the debt that we 
are going to be leaving our children 
and our grandchildren. We are stealing 
their future. They will not have the 
money that they need to provide for 
their programs and their infrastructure 
that they are going to need to fund in 
the future. That is one of the reasons 
why I wholeheartedly agree with her. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Kansas (Mr. MANN), who is a fifth 
generation Kansan and proudly serves 
on the Agriculture Committee and Vet-
erans’ Affairs Committee. He rep-
resents Kansas’ First District. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to dis-
cuss winners and losers under Presi-
dent Biden’s policies. 
When I was a kid playing eight-man 
football for the Quinter Bulldogs in 
rural Kansas, there wasn’t much room 
for debate on the winners and losers of 
the game. You either won or you 
didn’t. You either scored more touch-
downs, more 2-point conversions, and 
got more tackles than the other team, 
or you didn’t. Plain and simple. 
The same is true with America 
today. President Biden’s progressive 
policies make for very clear winners 
and very clear losers. Consider these 
three examples: 
Winner 
number 
one: 
Communist 
China. Loser: America. 
On January 31, 2020, America re-
ceived warning that the coronavirus 
had possibly been engineered in the 
Wuhan Institute of Virology in Wuhan, 
China. In late 2020, America began in-
vestigating the link between the spread 
of the coronavirus and the Wuhan lab. 
In one of his first acts as President, 
Joe Biden prematurely ended the inves-
tigation into the Wuhan lab. 
Now, with new, insurmountable evi-
dence that the coronavirus could have 
been engineered in the Wuhan lab, 
President Biden and Speaker NANCY 
PELOSI refuse to investigate the origins 
of COVID–19 even with overwhelming 
support for an investigation. On top of 
that, President Biden refuses to stop 
American taxpayer-funded research at 
that very Wuhan lab. 
It has been more than a year since 
the pandemic shut down the country. 
Today, nationwide, coronavirus cases 
have dramatically decreased. America 
is finally getting back to normal. Busi-
nesses across the country are ready to 
reopen and welcome back customers. 
Unfortunately, 
President 
Biden’s 
bonus, the new monthly unemployment 
checks being distributed on top of the 
already 
existing 
unemployment 
checks, is paying a premium for work-
ers to remain at home rather than find-
ing work. The data doesn’t lie. There 
are nearly 8 million job openings in 
America right now, a new record. I 
have heard from countless small busi-
ness owners in the Big First who cite 
the Biden bonus as the reason they 
cannot find workers and completely re-
open. 
While Communist China covers up 
COVID–19, President Biden is denying 
science, keeping people unemployed, 
and 
hurting 
America’s 
prosperity. 
Under 
President 
Biden’s 
policies, 
America loses. 
Winner two: The Mexican cartels. 
Loser: America. 
President Biden created a full-scale 
crisis at our southern border. He prom-
ised outright citizenship to more than 
11 million illegal immigrants, placed a 
moratorium on deportations, and halt-
ed border wall construction. 
These lax policies lure drug cartels, 
who in turn make hundreds of millions 
of dollars exploiting children. The car-
tels will even throw migrant children 
in the Rio Grande as a distraction, to 
avoid being apprehended. The daily av-
erage of unaccompanied minors cross-
ing the southern border has sky-
rocketed since President Biden took of-
fice. 
These policies also create chaos for 
Americans living near the border. 
American farmers and ranchers on the 
border are forced to check their live-
stock in the daylight, as it is too dan-
gerous for them to leave their homes at 
night. American families are keeping 
their kids indoors at all hours of the 
day. American law enforcement offi-
cers and Border Patrol are overworked 
and shorthanded. 
Meanwhile, President Biden and Vice 
President Harris have yet to visit the 
border and refuse to secure our country 
and enforce immigration laws. Under 
President Biden’s policies, America 
loses. 
Winner 
three: 
Socialism. 
Loser: 
America. 
Just a few weeks ago, later than any 
other President in a transition year, 
President Biden released his $6 trillion

budget. The budget is the most egre-
gious, most shortsighted, and costliest 
budget America has ever seen. 
President Biden’s budget is a progres-
sive wish list in disguise. He wants us 
funding the Green New Deal, spending 
$174 billion on subsidies to the electric 
car market and $40 billion to retrain 
employees who lost their jobs after he 
blocked the Keystone Pipeline, all in 
an attempt to replace the oil and gas 
industry. He wants $63.5 billion for 
international spending, but none for 
America’s longtime ally, Israel, clearly 
bowing to Democrats on their record of 
anti-Semitic language and slurs. And 
he refuses to protect our dollars from 
being spent on abortions, removing a 
pro-life protection that 77 percent of 
Americans support and a protection 
even Biden supported for years before 
his Presidential campaign. 
While socialists are pleased with 
Biden’s latest spending spree, the eco-
nomic disaster to follow will cripple 
American families’ purchasing power 
and leave future generations with the 
crushing burden of the national debt. 
Under 
President 
Biden’s 
policies, 
America loses. 
Sadly, the greatest loser in all of this 
is our freedom, the freedom to open our 
businesses and make a living when we 
choose, the freedom to own land with-
out the fear of a land grab, the freedom 
for law-abiding Americans to own and 
use firearms, the freedom to live out 
our faith without being persecuted by 
the government, the freedom to speak 
freely on college campuses, and the 
freedom to win. 
Our Founding Fathers ensured that 
these freedoms do not flow from a king, 
another country, or government, and 
they never will. Under freedom, Amer-
ica always wins. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. 
CARL), who is a successful small busi-
ness owner and a valued member of the 
Armed Services Committee and Nat-
ural Resources Committee. 
Mr. CARL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. 
GIMENEZ for overseeing this and calling 
us together. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s not forget what we 
have gone through in the last year and 
a half. 
In the last year and a half, person-
ally, I have seen a campaign that we 
have had to run while talking through 
doors. We had campaigns that were vir-
tually unheard of in the past. 
Those of us that did win, when we 
came to Washington, we were all treat-
ed equally, but we were treated like a 
disease. We were locked down in a 
hotel; our food was slipped to us 
through a plastic cover, in a paper bag; 
and that is the way we lived for a week 
through orientation. 
b 1900 
I am not blaming anyone. We had no 
idea what was going on. We all lived in 
fear. We all worried about this. But we 
are Americans and we are tough. We 
are tough. So we have made it. We have 
made it so far. 
The changes we have seen, the birth-
days that we have missed, the parents 
that we have seen that have passed 
away without us being there with 
them, I mean, we have all lived 
through this. We have got to reach 
across the aisle, and we have got to get 
America answers, answers to where 
this pandemic actually started. I en-
courage everyone to do that. 
Millions have lost jobs and necessary 
incomes while countless others lost 
loved ones to the virus. Meanwhile, the 
American public is constantly being 
misled over the origins of the spread of 
this COVID–19. 
First, we need to declassify all infor-
mation 
related 
to 
the 
origins 
of 
COVID–19. Then we need to prohibit 
the National Institutes of Health from 
giving funds to irresponsible foreign 
governments, like China. And, finally, 
we need to investigate the Chinese 
Communist Party’s role in the origin 
and the spread of this virus. 
The evidence is clear that the Chi-
nese Communist Party intentionally 
hid information and lied about the 
truth about this virus. It is time for 
answers, and it is time for us to hold 
them accountable for the spread of this 
horrific pandemic. The American peo-
ple and the whole world deserves to 
know the truth. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to stop, hesitate, and let’s 
work together on this. Let’s join to-
gether and find out the truth and pre-
vent something like this from hap-
pening again. It is very important to 
this country and this Nation. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I now 
yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
BABIN), who represents Texas’ 36th Dis-
trict. He is a lifelong resident of east 
Texas and my colleague on the Trans-
portation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Com-
mittee and the Science, Space, and 
Technology Committee. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend from Florida, a former 
mayor, for yielding. I am a former 
mayor myself. 
Mr. Speaker, every single action that 
the Chinese Communist Party takes 
leaves me with no doubt that they are 
not friends of ours. For years, Beijing 
has stolen American intelligence, tech-
nology, and intellectual property in 
their relentless pursuit to supersede us 
as the number one superpower in the 
world. 
So it should come as no surprise to 
anyone that more than a year after 
COVID–19 magically manifested itself 
and escaped China and took the world 
by storm, killing millions, we are still 
asking ourselves: How did it happen? Is 
there something that China is not tell-
ing us? 
The simple answer is yes, there is 
plenty that the CCP is not telling us. 
We can’t even begin to solve the ques-
tion of how this happened until we 
start a formal investigation. 
Unfortunately, it is not just the CCP 
who refuses to allow a transparent and 
thorough 
investigation 
into 
the 
pandemic’s origins. It is also my col-
leagues across the aisle. After all, se-
crecy and diversion seem to be a stand-
ard practice for both the Democrat 
Party and Beijing. 
Why are the Democrats refusing to 
allocate resources so that we can solve 
the 
problems 
and 
questions 
sur-
rounding something this major? 
They are perfectly happy to spend 
$1.9 billion of Americans’ hard-earned 
tax dollars for security upgrades to the 
Capitol complex due to the events of 
January 6, where one person died, but 
cannot be bothered to spend a dime to 
investigate how 600,000 Americans died. 
There is mounting evidence that the 
COVID–19 pandemic started in a Chi-
nese laboratory and that the Chinese 
Communist Party covered it up. 
Don’t the more than 33 million Amer-
icans who have been infected with 
COVID and the loved ones of the more 
than 600,000 Americans who passed 
away from it deserve an explanation? 
To blindly just believe that this glob-
al pandemic started from a bat in a wet 
market in the very same city where ge-
netic analyses of coronaviruses are 
done at the Wuhan Institute of Virol-
ogy without doing any sort of an inves-
tigation is a dereliction of our duty. It 
is inexcusable and downright ignorant. 
This administration and this Con-
gress must hold the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s feet to the fire and give 
us some answers. We deserve the truth. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
FRANKLIN), my friend and colleague. He 
has served as a naval aviator in the 
U.S. Navy for 26 years. I thank him for 
his service. 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, because of its great 
weather, beautiful beaches, and low 
taxes, a friend who once served as my 
Congressman liked to say that, for 
many around the country, Florida is 
the reward for a life well lived. 
As liberal States continue to run 
their governments into the ground and 
the pandemic has accelerated our abil-
ity to work remotely, it is no longer 
just retirees who are moving to the 
Sunshine State in droves. In fact, near-
ly 330,000 have relocated there in the 
past year alone. 
With its strategic location along cen-
tral Florida’s I–4 corridor, Florida’s 
15th Congressional District is one of 
the fastest growing areas in the coun-
try. Our current transportation infra-
structure is already inadequate. It is a 
problem that will only accelerate going 
forward unless we act now. I am sure 
many communities across the country 
can relate. 
Both sides of the aisle can agree that 
our Nation’s highways, airports, water 
infrastructure, ports, and broadband 
networks are the arteries of our na-
tional commerce and worthy invest-
ments of taxpayer money. 
The good news is Republicans are 
taking the lead to meet these infra-
structure needs. First, we are pro-
posing a major overhaul of our Federal

project review and permitting proc-
esses. When I formerly served on the 
board of the Transportation Planning 
Organization in my home district, we 
routinely had critical needs that wait-
ed years for funding. Some of those 
have still not been funded. So speeding 
up that process is a critical first step. 
We are also proposing a $460 billion 
framework that will make crucial in-
vestments in our Nation’s transpor-
tation system, water infrastructure, 
and broadband networks. This frame-
work represents an investment in the 
real infrastructure Americans need, 
not bizarre reinterpretations of infra-
structure or partisan pet projects. 
Congress has talked about infrastruc-
ture investment for years. It is time to 
put words into action. I hope the Presi-
dent will continue to listen to voices 
on both sides of the aisle to enact a bi-
partisan solution that our country so 
desperately needs. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentlewoman from Tennessee 
(Mrs. HARSHBARGER). She has been a 
successful 
pharmacist and business 
owner for over three decades. 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak about the impor-
tant need for an investigation into Chi-
na’s role in the origin of COVID–19. 
More than 600,000 Americans and 3.8 
million people have died worldwide 
from the virus, and now it is becoming 
more evident than ever that the virus 
may have originated from a leak at the 
Wuhan Institute of Virology. 
It is also clear that China withheld 
critical information at the beginning 
of the pandemic to cover up how deadly 
the virus could become. We have de-
manded an investigation to find out 
what Chinese Communist Party leaders 
knew and when they knew it. My col-
leagues from across the aisle have 
blocked our attempts. 
Millions have died and countless oth-
ers have suffered from the economic ef-
fects of the pandemic. The American 
people deserve answers as to how the 
outbreak originated, and the Chinese 
Communist Party must be held ac-
countable if they are responsible for 
the outbreak and its global spread. 
The bottom line is this: China lied 
and people did die. We need an inves-
tigation now. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
WITTMAN). He is an experienced govern-
ment official. We share a common 
background in local government, hav-
ing both served as mayors. 
Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, over 3.8 
million people across the world have 
died from COVID–19, over 600,000 Amer-
icans have died. We deserve to know 
how the COVID–19 pandemic began. 
There is mounting evidence to show 
that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is 
a probable source of that. If we look at 
the assertions by China to say that this 
was transmitted naturally from a bat 
through a wet market, things just 
don’t add up. 
If we look at the information we have 
gotten from our intelligence commu-
nities, if we look at what we have seen 
to this point across the whole spec-
trum, we deserve to know exactly what 
has happened. 
If we want to uncover the truth be-
hind COVID–19, if we are serious about 
preventing future pandemics, if we are 
serious about holding China account-
able, then I believe we need to do ev-
erything we can to follow the science. 
By profession and by education, I am 
a biologist. In fact, I worked in and ran 
laboratories 
for 
years, 
laboratories 
that handled pathogenic organisms. I 
know the things that need to be done 
to uncover exactly what happened at 
the Wuhan lab. 
It doesn’t make sense to look at the 
assertions that China makes and some-
how believe that that is indeed the 
case. I don’t think that this is a ran-
dom event. I do believe that there are 
links to the Wuhan lab that must have 
an independent and thoughtful evalua-
tion of exactly what happened. 
We have to force China to allow a 
free, objective, and independent eval-
uation of exactly what happened at the 
Wuhan Institute of Virology and deter-
mine what role did it play in the ori-
gins of this pandemic. We have to do 
that. 
I want to ensure the investigation 
happens and that we hold Chinese offi-
cials accountable. That is why I intro-
duced The World Deserves to Know 
Act, because, indeed, the world de-
serves to know. The World Deserves to 
Know Act will sanction key Chinese of-
ficials in their Centers for Disease Con-
trol, in their national health commis-
sion who obfuscated data, the data nec-
essary to determine exactly what hap-
pened; and also, through our intel-
ligence gathering, to identify those in-
dividuals in the Chinese Communist 
Party that persecuted scientists, that 
persecuted 
citizen 
journalists 
that 
sought to divulge the truth about what 
happened there. There must be a free, 
open, and independent evaluation that 
is allowed in order for us to know. 
Again, the world deserves to know. 
In the meantime, what my bill would 
do is also prohibit funding from going 
to China from any U.S. institution, our 
universities, our colleges, anyplace 
that would send money either to the 
National Health Commission or any en-
tity 
associated 
with 
the 
National 
Health Commission, like the Wuhan 
lab for the research that we have seen 
going on there, the gain-of-function re-
search. We have to make sure that that 
happens. 
I want to make sure, too, that we 
identify where dollars have gone from 
the U.S., from the National Institutes 
of Health or any other governmental 
entity or any entity associated with 
our Federal Government, State govern-
ments, or local governments that may 
have sent money to China for gain-of- 
function research. We have to know ex-
actly where the money went, where it 
came from, and who was the decision-
maker about how that money got 
there. And that needs to go all the way 
up through our bureaucracies not only 
at the Federal level, but at the State 
level also. Anywhere there is an asso-
ciation, that needs to be known. 
I want to make sure, too, that my 
bill allows Taiwan observer status in 
the World Health Organization to make 
sure that they check China’s malign 
influence over the organization. Tai-
wan was at the very beginning of mak-
ing sure that this was transparent. 
This is not about political games-
manship. This is about getting to the 
truth not only for the sake of truth 
itself, but to make sure the United 
States never suffers another pandemic 
like the one we just endured. 
I hope that all my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle will join me in hold-
ing China accountable and supporting 
and cosponsoring The World Deserves 
to Know Act. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I now 
yield to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LAMALFA). He represents Califor-
nia’s First District. He serves on the 
Agriculture Committee and the Trans-
portation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Com-
mittee. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, we talk 
a lot about infrastructure around here. 
The American people wonder what is 
that actually going to mean coming 
out here. Well, it really needs to be fo-
cused on things that we are short of, 
but would be fixing our highways, fix-
ing our bridges, things like that. 
In California, where I come from, the 
subject is water. Water storage is des-
perately needed. We have had some 
years of drought, but we also have not 
added to our water storage in a signifi-
cant way in 40 years. With a growing 
population, there is a growing need. 
For example, what does that mean to 
all Americans, not just Californians? 
The food we eat. The top crops in 
California that are grown approxi-
mately 99 percent or more in California 
are almonds, artichokes, celery, figs, 
garlic, raisins, kiwis, honeydew, nec-
tarines, 
olives, 
cling 
peaches, 
pis-
tachios, plums, sweet rice, and wal-
nuts. 
If California is not growing those 
items, where do we intend to get those? 
b 1915 
For almonds especially, California 
grows all the domestic production 
Americans use and 77 percent of the 
global production. We also produce 92 
percent 
of 
the 
Nation’s 
avocados, 
grapes, lemons, and mandarins. No avo-
cados? No guacamole. 
What are we going to do, import all 
this? We have to be producing this stuff 
in the State of California. 
What does that mean? We need to in-
vest in water infrastructure. We can be 
raising Shasta Dam, which is a Federal 
project. 
Eighteen 
feet 
yields 
over 
600,000 new acre-feet for these crops. 
We could be building Sites Reservoir. 
Both of these have been invested in 
slightly by the Federal Government 
lately. We need to do much more be-
cause we are the leading State in so

many of the important products that 
Americans actually use. 
So, we have to talk a lot more about 
water storage. 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
f 
HIGHLIGHTING JUNETEENTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. OWENS) for 
30 minutes. 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to once again highlight our newest 
Federal holiday, Juneteenth, or Eman-
cipation Day. 
For Americans who are not familiar 
with this day, it has been celebrated 
within the Black community for over 
150 years. This was the day when the 
message finally reached Black Texans 
living in Galveston that slavery was 
over and that they were indeed free. 
The Emancipation Proclamation was 
signed by President Abraham Lincoln 
on September 22, 1862. Union General 
Gordon Granger arrived with over 2,000 
troops to deliver this message to the 
former slaves on June 19, 1865, 3 years 
later. 
The lesson that can be learned from 
this special day is twofold. For almost 
3 years, Black Texans lived as slaves at 
a time when the price had already been 
paid for them to live free. As it was 
with Juneteenth 1865, it would be the 
Republican Party that delivered the 
message to my race: You are free. 
In America, in the land of freedom, 
success is a personal choice. It is not 
easy, nor is it guaranteed. But if you 
choose to dream, work, sacrifice, and 
remain patient, you can, regardless of 
your skin color, live your American 
Dream. 
The remarkable success of the late 
1800s all-Black Greenwood community 
speaks to the tenacity, pride, innova-
tion, and entrepreneurial spirit of a 
race that rose in less than 50 years 
from slavery. Its destruction in 1921, 
within 12 hours, also highlights the 
vulnerability of the American Dream 
in the absence of the rule of law. Deep 
Greenwood, referred to as ‘‘Little Afri-
ca’’ and ‘‘Black Wall Street,’’ was the 
most wealthy and prosperous Black 
community in America in the early 
1900s. 
During the 1820s, several successful 
and prominent Black entrepreneurs 
were drawn to Oklahoma due to a na-
tionwide economic depression and the 
discovery of oil. The local economy 
boomed, with Blacks in Tulsa rep-
resenting all professional occupations, 
from day laborers, cooks, and shoe 
shiners to physicians, schoolteachers, 
and entrepreneurs. 
Racism and the influence of Jim 
Crow laws made it so that Blacks could 
work in White areas but could not 
spend their money there. This led to 
the creation of Deep Greenwood. 
With 
business 
dollars 
circulating 
only within their own community, 
many Blacks began to buy land and 
start their businesses. Black Wall 
Street became the center of the town, 
featuring restaurants, jewelry stores, 
hotels, theaters, places of worship, and 
three Black newspapers. 
By the way, in the 1960s, when I was 
growing up, this describes my seg-
regated community, a community of 
entrepreneurs where, across our coun-
try, 50 to 60 percent of Black Ameri-
cans belonged to the middle class. 
Over 
600 
business 
owners 
helped 
Black Wall Street become influential, 
including a funeral parlor, barbershops, 
dental and medical offices, schools, li-
braries, a hospital, insurance and loan 
companies, airline charter services, a 
bus service, international businesses, 
and nightclubs. 
The Black community was thriving, 
and their collective success rivaled 
that of Tulsa. But in these times of 
racism and deep prejudices, the success 
of Black Wall Street created a tinder-
box of tension. 
On May 30, 1921, a 17-year-old White 
woman accused Dick Rowland, a Black 
shoe shiner, of criminally assaulting 
her when he accidentally stepped on 
her foot. She slapped him, and in re-
sponse, he grabbed her arm to prevent 
her from hitting him. 
Realizing his self-defense move might 
cause problems, he fled the scene. The 
next day, he was jailed. The Tulsa 
Tribune printed a story announcing 
that a ‘‘negro would be lynched to-
night.’’ 
Three hours after the Tulsa Tribune 
released the story, hundreds of White 
men gathered at the Tulsa courthouse 
where Rowland was being held. Many 
Blacks who wanted to protect Rowland 
from being lynched rushed to the 
courthouse to defend him. 
False rumors about the incident 
caused 
a 
struggle 
between 
White 
protestors and Blacks in front of the 
courthouse. Shots rang out, and 12 men 
were killed. 
As the fighting continued, Tulsa 
Whites began an all-out assault on 
Deep Greenwood, including dropping 
firebombs from the air. Fire engulfed 
the entire Black district. Deep Green-
wood burned all day on May 31. At the 
end of the attack, Black Wall Street 
was no longer standing. 
In total, 300 people were murdered; 35 
acres of commercial and residential 
property were destroyed; 1,400 homes 
and businesses were looted and burned; 
10,000 people were left homeless; $1.8 
million in damage, which in today’s 
dollar amounts would be $27 million. It 
was estimated the total value lost 
would be valued at $200 million in to-
day’s dollars. Over 600 businesses were 
destroyed, and as is today, these busi-
nesses were the engine that powered 
the self-sufficient middle class. 
By the time the police chief asked 
the National Guard to help quell the 
‘‘negro uprising,’’ it was too late. The 
city was already destroyed. A grand 
jury held him responsible for derelic-
tion of duty. He was removed from of-
fice, found guilty in the trial, but never 
served any time in jail. 
I would like to introduce you to some 
of the Black leaders in Deep Green-
wood, Oklahoma, the city of million-
aires. 
Dr. A.C. Jackson, a physician, tran-
scended the color lines, servicing both 
Black and White patients. He was con-
sidered the most skilled Black surgeon 
in America, with a net worth of over 
$100,000, which, in 2019, would have a 
value of over a million dollars. Dr. 
Jackson was murdered during the mas-
sacre at age 40. 
E.W. Woods was the first principal of 
the all-Black Booker T. Washington 
High School. Woods set the standard 
for high expectations at school. 
John Stradford was the owner of a 45- 
room luxury hotel in Greenwood, the 
largest 
Black-owned-and-operated 
hotel in Oklahoma, and one of the few 
Black-owned 
hotels 
in 
the 
United 
States. He was the son of an escaped 
slave, and he came to Oklahoma in 1899 
and was the wealthiest man on Black 
Wall Street. 
Simon Berry owned a nickel-a-ride 
jitney service, a bus line, a boutique 
hotel, and a charter plane service. 
John and Loula Williams owned a 
1911 luxury Norwalk Touring. This cou-
ple launched multiple venues, a the-
ater, a confectionary, a rooming house, 
and a garage. 
Buck Colbert Franklin, an attorney 
in Deep Greenwood, was known for de-
fending the survivors of the Greenwood 
massacre. He was the father of civil 
rights advocate and historian John 
Hope Franklin. 
These successful Black leaders all 
faced the darkness of the 1921 mas-
sacre. 
John Stradford’s hotel laid in ruins 
after the burning of Deep Greenwood 
and was never rebuilt. Stradford was 
indicted for inciting a riot and fled 
Greenwood. 
The Mt. Zion Baptist Church was just 
40 days old and was destroyed. The cost 
to rebuild and furnish was $135,000. 
During the riot, homes were looted 
and burned, and thousands of Black 
people were left homeless. 
There were 88 indictments served 
against Blacks and Whites alike, but 
all charges were either dismissed or ig-
nored. 
The KKK used the massacre as a re-
cruiting tool, stating that ‘‘the riot 
was the best thing that ever happened 
to Tulsa’’ and sold postcards in Tulsa’s 
downtown streets to raise money. 
Republican Representative Dyer from 
Missouri 
introduced 
a 
Federal 
antilynching 
bill, 
the 
Dyer 
Anti- 
Lynching Bill. Democrats in the Sen-
ate delayed the bill and eventually 
killed it. Between 1882 and 1968, nearly 
200 antilynching bills were introduced 
in Congress, and seven U.S. Presidents 
between 1890 and 1952 also asked Con-
gress to pass a Federal antilynching 
law. All efforts failed to pass due to the 
stalling tactics by the Democratic Con-
gress and Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H3079 
June 23, 2021 
The comparison of 1921 Tulsa and the 
2020 summer can be summarized in 
these words: a lack of rule of law. 
In 1921, what had taken nine decades 
to build in Greenwood was destroyed 
within a matter of 12 hours. Ninety- 
nine years later, following the murder 
of 
George 
Floyd, 
riots 
stretched 
throughout our country in predomi-
nantly Black urban cities. Over the 
summer of 2020, more than 1,500 busi-
nesses, 
residences, and government 
buildings were destroyed, along with 
the lives of 25 Americans. 
Jeremiah Ellison, a councilman in 
Minnesota, where a police precinct 
house itself was set on fire, advised the 
mayor to leave the vandals alone. ‘‘The 
focus of anger is the police and this 
building,’’ he reasoned. ‘‘If we let the 
crowd do its thing, we might spare the 
neighborhood.’’ History will forever 
note how wrong he was. 
In Portland, Oregon, the summer 
riots of 2020 have resulted in $23 mil-
lion lost. Yet, the Portland mayor, Ted 
Wheeler, tweeted that Federal officers 
were bringing violence and life-threat-
ening tactics to the city. ‘‘The best 
thing they can do is stay inside their 
building or leave Portland altogether,’’ 
he said. 
In Kenosha, Wisconsin, over half the 
people arrested in the aftermath were 
from out of town. Property damage 
topped $50 million and put close to 40 
businesses out of business. 
Even in my own Salt Lake City, cop 
cars were burned. The Salt Lake City 
Council chairman declared that over-
turning and burning a police cruiser 
was a ‘‘small sacrifice over physical 
clashes between officers and civilians.’’ 
Meanwhile, 21 police officers were in-
jured. 
At the end of the summer riots of 
2020, over 20 States witnessed violent 
riots, with insurance claims between $1 
billion and $2 billion. 
Once again, most tragically, 25 Amer-
ican citizens lost their lives, including 
a respected retired Black officer who 
was murdered in cold blood protecting 
the store of a friend. 
In New York City, politicians passed 
no-bail laws, allowing criminals and ri-
oters to return to the streets the very 
next night to loot and again attack 
New York City police. 
In Portland, as the city is still reel-
ing and businesses remained hostages 
to criminals, thousands of rioters’ 
charges have been dropped. 
We must learn several things from 
our history. Whether it be the destruc-
tion of 1921 Black Wall Street busi-
nesses or 2020 Black urban cities 
throughout our Nation, consistent is a 
pattern of failure of elected officials to 
uphold the rule of law. Instead of 
championing Black and minority busi-
ness owners, many of these officials 
stood aside as these communities were 
destroyed. Consistent with the acts in 
1921 and that of 2020 was the criminal 
predators’ justification, always in the 
name of so-called racial justice. 
From these two dark chapters, ac-
countability must be a lesson learned. 
As we demand equal opportunity for all 
Americans for life, liberty, the pursuit 
of happiness, and property, we the peo-
ple become more unified and free. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

f 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
yesterday, the Senate was given an op-
portunity to begin debate on a subject 
that by all rights should be beyond de-
bate: protecting the right to vote. 
As we all know, Republican legisla-
tures across the country are passing 
some of the most draconian restric-
tions on the right to vote in decades— 
a throwback to Jim Crow. 
Every single Democrat yesterday 
voted to begin debate on legislation to 
fight back against this assault—and 
that is what it is, an assault on our de-
mocracy—every single one. It was the 
first time in this Congress that we 
have united all 50 Democrats on mov-
ing forward with strong and com-
prehensive voting rights legislation. 
Senate Republicans, to the very last 
Member, voted against allowing the 
Senate to even have a debate on voting 
rights. Not a single Republican voted 
to move forward with a simple debate. 
In fact, the Republican leader went so 
far as to say that ‘‘regardless of what 
may be happening in some states’’— 
voter suppression laws, phony audits, 
or the partisan takeover of election 
boards—he believes the Federal Gov-
ernment should not intervene. Who 
said that? Southern Senators from the 
Civil War all the way through said 
States’ rights—used as a tool to pre-
vent particularly people of color from 
voting. And to invoke that in 2020? The 
majority leader is way off—way off 
base. It is disgraceful that he would 
even invoke that. 
Yesterday’s vote was another piece of 
evidence that voter suppression is now 
part of the official platform of the Re-
publican Party. But I want to be clear 
about one thing. As I said last night, 
the fight to protect voting rights is far, 
very far from over. Yesterday’s vote 
was the starting gun, not the finish 
line. 
As the Senate majority leader, I re-
serve the right to bring up this issue 
for debate again. Yesterday was the 
first time we tried to consider major 
voting rights legislation, but it won’t 
be the last. Democrats will explore 
every option available to us for recon-
sidering legislation on this topic. We 
will leave no stone unturned. Voting 
rights are too important. The fight 
against modern-day voter suppression 
is just beginning. 
One other point. Some of them like 
to make this point: Oh, this is just a 
partisan fight. Bull. This is a fight for 
the soul of America, and it shouldn’t be 
partisan, and it never was in the past. 
When legislatures try to prevent poor 
people, people of color, urban people, 
and young people from voting, that is 
not a political fight; that is what 
America is all about. So don’t try to 
hide under that guise. 
It is Republican legislatures doing 
this. But in the past, when legislatures, 
usually in the South, tried to do these 
things—and in other places—both par-
ties united to stop it. No more, sadly. 
Shame, shame, shame, shame on my 
Republican colleagues. This is a very 
bad day for them that history will rec-
ognize.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4708 
June 23, 2021 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
now on another matter, this week, the 
Senate will continue restoring balance 
to the Federal courts by considering 
more of President Biden’s judicial ap-
pointments. 
Over the next 2 days, we will consider 
Deborah Boardman to serve as district 
judge in Maryland and Candace Jack-
son-Akiwumi to serve as judge on the 
Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. To-
gether, Ms. Boardman and Ms. Jack-
son-Akiwumi have had over 20 years of 
experience as Federal defenders. 
I believe that bringing professional 
diversity as well as personal diversity 
to the bench should be and is now a top 
priority. There are plenty of former 
prosecutors 
and 
corporate 
lawyers 
wearing black robes. It is time that 
some voting rights attorneys, civil 
rights attorneys, and former Federal 
defenders, like these two nominees, 
bring their perspectives to the bench. 
A final vote on Ms. Boardman’s nom-
ination will come this afternoon, and 
then we will proceed to the nomination 
of Ms. Jackson-Akiwumi, which we will 
finish before the end of the week. 
Again, the Senate will not leave for the 
week until we finish considering these 
judges. The Democratic majority in the 
Senate will continue to swiftly fill ju-
dicial vacancies. 
On a related note, today, Chairman 
PETERS will ask the Senate to approve 
two critical cyber security nominees: 
Jen Easterly to be the Director of the 
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Secu-
rity Agency and Robin Carnahan to be 
the Administrator of the GSA. Both of 
these Agencies play a critical role in 
our Nation’s cyber security. 
The threat of ransomware attacks 
and other cyber crimes is on the rise 
from State actors as well as cyber ban-
dits who were given sanctuary by our 
adversaries. We need people at the 
helm on these important Agencies to 
focus on hardening our Nation’s cyber 
security. This should be a completely 
nonpartisan issue, and my Republican 
friends should not object. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, in 
addition to our important work on ju-
dicial appointments, the Senate is 
moving forward on multiple legislative 
proposals to make historic investments 
in our Nation’s infrastructure. 
We have a chance in this Congress to 
get something big and bold done on in-
frastructure—something 
we 
haven’t 
managed in a very long time. If we 
want America to prosper in the 21st 
century, we can’t do it with infrastruc-
ture that is stuck in the last century. 
This is our chance to update, mod-
ernize, repair, and rebuild for another 
century of American economic growth, 
creating thousands upon thousands of 
good-paying jobs in the process. 
Later today, Speaker PELOSI and I 
will meet with representatives from 
the White House to discuss the next 
steps on this very topic. Here in the 
Senate, Democratic members of the 
Budget Committee continue to build on 
the fruitful conversations we had last 
week. In fact, earlier today, I spoke 
with all of our committee chairs about 
a forthcoming budget resolution. 
As I have said, discussions about in-
frastructure are progressing along two 
tracks. The first is bipartisan, and the 
second incorporates elements of the 
President’s American jobs and families 
plan. The second track is something we 
must support even if it doesn’t get any 
Republican support. For several weeks, 
the trains have been chugging down 
both tracks quite well. When the Sen-
ate returns after the July 4 work pe-
riod, it will be time to take the next 
step forward. 
This summer, the Senate will begin 
considering the fiscal 2022 budget reso-
lution and a bipartisan infrastructure 
bill on the floor. It is my hope to have 
both a bipartisan infrastructure bill 
and a budget resolution for the Senate 
to consider this summer. I believe the 
progress we have made in recent weeks 
will ultimately produce the result that 
will set our economy on a path to pros-
perity for generations to come. 
f 
STUDENT LOANS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
one final matter: student loans. Today, 
I have joined Senator WARREN and a 
number of my House and Senate col-
leagues to urge the Biden administra-
tion to extend the pause on payments 
and interest for the vast majority of 
Federal student loans. 
For millions of student borrowers, 
one of the most difficult challenges is 
balancing their debt with their dreams 
of starting a career, starting a family, 
and buying a home. When the pandemic 
hit, these challenges were magnified a 
hundredfold. Job opportunities dis-
appeared, and our economy came to a 
halt. The pause on student loan repay-
ment during the pandemic was a life- 
altering policy that allowed tens of 
millions of young people to escape fi-
nancial ruin. 
Right now, the current pause on re-
payment of student debt is set to ex-
pire on September 30. I believe that is 
too soon. Our economy is still recov-
ering. 
Americans 
are 
still 
pulling 
themselves up and dusting themselves 
off after one of the greatest economic 
crises in our history. The October 1 ex-
piration date could risk putting mil-
lions of student loan borrowers back 
into financial hardship. 
Very simply, I am urging the Biden 
administration to extend the pause on 
student loan repayment by another 6 
months, until March 2022. Even as the 
economy recovers, young people, bor-
rowers with a load of debt, will strug-
gle more than most to get back on 
their feet. Why not give them a little 
more breathing room? 
I urge the Biden administration to 
extend the pause, and I will continue 
working with Senator WARREN on ways 
to provide even more comprehensive, 
life-changing 
student 
loan 
forgive-
ness—a policy, I believe, that will ex-
pand opportunity for millions, millions 
of young Americans. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
RUSSIA 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
for the first time earlier this month, 
President Biden traveled to Europe. 
The primary purpose for this trip was 
to engage with some of America’s clos-
est friends and allies, but the agenda 
also included a one-on-one meeting 
with a staunch adversary, Vladimir 
Putin. 
The President took office armed with 
a great deal of tough talk on Russia. 
He called his counterpart a ‘‘killer’’ 
and a ‘‘KGB thug’’ and warned he 
would ‘‘pay [the] price’’ for inter-
ference in U.S. elections. The world 
wondered whether this rhetoric would 
be underpinned by tough action. I cer-
tainly hoped it would. 
Back in January, I made it clear that 
if the Biden administration was serious 
about ‘‘imposing real costs on Mos-
cow,’’ it would ‘‘find willing partners 
on Capitol Hill.’’ But so far, there have 
been few encouraging signs for those of 
us who take Russia’s threats very seri-
ously. 
Remember, after less than a week in 
office, President Biden agreed to Rus-
sian requests for a full 5-year extension 
of the New START Treaty, no strings 
attached. He gave it up for free, under-
mining our leverage to extract conces-
sions in future negotiations. 
Then, his administration rolled out a 
budget proposal that would cut invest-
ment in defense, in real terms—short-
changing the modernization we need to 
keep pace with both Russia and China. 
And 2 weeks ago, the President left 
for Europe, having already given the 
Kremlin two other gifts: a high-profile 
summit that experts predicted Putin 
would use to help legitimize his regime 
at home and abroad and a waiver of 
sanctions on the Russian-owned com-
pany behind a lucrative gas pipeline 
project. 
So I will repeat for President Biden 
the same warning I offered to the pre-
vious administration: The Kremlin is

June 23, 2021 
not our friend, and it is high time our 
actions started reflecting that. 
Back home, of course, the Biden ad-
ministration has proven it knows per-
fectly well how to crack down on en-
ergy pipeline projects when it wants to. 
In fact, on the day he left for Europe, 
the firm behind the Keystone XL Pipe-
line project announced that the Presi-
dent’s revocation of its construction 
permit would be fatal. That is the end 
of it. What a striking image. The Presi-
dent of the United States heads over-
seas and meets with a major adversary 
whom he has handed a major geo-
political win, and here at home, the 
last nail goes in the coffin of the job- 
killing crusade against reliable North 
American energy that he said on day 
one was a priority. 
It is a tale of two pipelines: the deci-
sive rejection of thousands of American 
jobs here at home and the empower-
ment of America’s adversaries abroad. 
And it is only the latest sign that the 
Biden administration’s strategic prior-
ities are simply out of order. 
Recall, this administration rushed to 
rejoin a climate agreement that has 
failed to hold major signatories to 
their commitments on reducing emis-
sions, even as the United States re-
corded multiple years of reductions on 
our own. 
This administration made it harder 
to cap our abundant and domestic en-
ergy, even at the risk of greater reli-
ance on imports from countries with 
lower environmental standards. And, of 
course, they proposed to squander 
years of accumulating economic pres-
sure on Iran in exchange for no mean-
ingful concessions on its nuclear ambi-
tions or regional aggression. 
So when President Biden elected to 
pass on another opportunity to check 
the influence of a major adversary, we 
had heard this story before. 
Here in Congress, opposition to the 
completion of the Nord Stream 2 Pipe-
line has been vigorous and bipartisan. 
Last 
year’s 
Defense 
authorization, 
which earned 84 votes here in the Sen-
ate, expanded the scope of sanctions 
against critical entities involved in its 
construction. We are talking about a 
project that would give Putin a new ar-
tery of influence in Western Europe 
and rob Ukraine of critical leverage 
over the way Russian energy currently 
flows throughout the region. 
But, apparently, the Biden adminis-
tration’s own opposition to the project 
was just rhetorical. When the chips 
were down, the President used a waiver 
to avoid having to place sanctions on 
the biggest company behind the project 
and its CEO—a Putin crony. According 
to reports, his decision even overruled 
the objections of senior diplomats and 
the concerns of his very own Secretary 
of State. 
Oddly enough, the administration’s 
decision to snuff out union jobs in the 
energy sector here at home didn’t seem 
to prompt as vigorous an internal de-
bate. In fact, President Biden’s Execu-
tive action to kill the Keystone XL has 
been followed by a steady stream of 
radical proposals that illustrate just 
how deep his administration is in 
thrall to the environmental fringe. 
Under the guise of infrastructure, 
they pitched trillions of dollars in Fed-
eral spending, aligned so closely with 
most liberal interests in Congress that 
the authors—the authors—of the Green 
New Deal boasted President Biden’s 
agenda had their manifesto’s DNA all 
over it: unprecedented spending on 
electric vehicles, huge increases in 
funds for transit projects that dis-
proportionately benefit blue States on 
the coast, and plans to pick winners 
and losers in the market for affordable, 
reliable American energy. 
So American workers know what a 
thriving energy sector looks like. It is 
exactly what Republicans spent 4 years 
working to encourage here at home. 
As a matter of fact, if you hit pause 
on Washington Democrats’ radical cli-
mate rhetoric, you will notice that 
smart energy policy isn’t limited by 
political stripe. For years, the liberal 
government up in Canada has recog-
nized pipelines as a safe and efficient 
way to connect people with affordable, 
reliable energy and grow what is al-
ready the largest sector of United 
States-Canada trade. So it was hardly 
surprising to hear one Canadian official 
greet President Biden’s decision to 
sink the Keystone XL Pipeline as ‘‘an 
insult’’—an insult—or to read that the 
Canadian firm behind the project is 
now pursuing legal action to recoup its 
investment. 
So capitulation to our rivals, painful 
blows to our neighbors, legitimizing 
corrupt foreign leaders, and jamming 
hard-working Americans—whatever his 
motives, and despite his own rhetoric, 
the consequences of President Biden’s 
actions are already clear. 
It is not too late to impose real costs 
on Russia’s pipeline windfall and pro-
vide serious, lethal support to Ukraine 
and other vulnerable States on the 
frontlines of Putin’s aggression. It is 
not too late to get serious about the 
defense investment that bipartisan as-
sessments say that we need—that we 
need—in order to compete with China 
and Russia. It is not too late to recom-
mit to bipartisanship on infrastructure 
and on energy and show radical climate 
activists the door. 
I hope the Biden administration 
changes courses sometime soon. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
f 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, what 
is the weather like in Las Vegas? What 
is it like in Reno? I am not sure, but I 
will bet it is hot. And the reason I am 
sure that it is likely to be hot is the 
weather forecast. 
I looked at that map, and it was solid 
red in the western half of the United 
States, with extreme high tempera-
tures at a level never recorded. They 
said in the city of Seattle, there have 
only been a handful of times that they 
have had temperatures over 100 degrees 
in that city. It is going to happen again 
this weekend, at least that is the pre-
diction. That is the weather forecast. 
It is not just confined to the blue 
coastal States, as some call them. We 
have a drought in the Midwest. I hope 
it ends soon, but when it comes to corn 
country—Iowa, 
Illinois, 
Indiana—we 
are worried. I hope it doesn’t happen, 
but it could, and we know it can hap-
pen soon. And then in the southeastern 
part of the United States, there are ex-
treme storms—rains they haven’t seen 
before. 
I just say that after listening to the 
Republican leader describe the situa-
tion with the environment, wondering 
if he reads the papers or talks to people 
back home because extreme weather is 
happening all over the United States, 
and it isn’t just in Republican areas or 
Democratic areas; it is virtually every-
where. 
So when President Biden comes in 
and says: Shouldn’t we do something 
about this for the good of our children 
and our grandchildren? Shouldn’t we be 
willing 
to 
sacrifice 
a 
little 
bit? 
Shouldn’t we be willing to change some 
if it means that they are going to have 
a planet that is worth living on—about 
10 years ago, I started asking my farm-
ers who come and visit me from Illinois 
a couple of questions. These are good 
people. They never vote for me, I know 
that, but I still like meeting with 
them. They are good people. They 
bring their wives. They dress up in 
their suits. They take it seriously. 
They are coming to Washington. This 
is before COVID–19, of course. And they 
would sit upstairs in my conference 
room. There would be about 20 or 30 of 
them from organizations like the Farm 
Bureau or the corn growers or the soy-
bean growers. And I would say to 
them—this is 10 years ago—how many 
of you believe that what we are doing 
on Earth is changing the environment 
of the Earth we live on? I mean that 
our human activity is having some-
thing to do with it. And I would ask for 
a show of hands. And the response was, 
not one hand would go up. 
And I finally said to them: Well, 
things are changing. What do you 
think is behind all of it? And one fellow 
said—and he did this seriously, and I 
believe he was speaking from the 
heart—he said: ‘‘Senator, some years 
God sends me a drought; some years 
God sends me a flood; I got to deal with 
whatever God sends me.’’ 
I respect him for that. That is his 
deep-hearted belief, and it is sincere. 
But I think there is more to the 
story. And now when I ask these same 
farmers the same question, I get a dif-
ferent response. The Illinois corn grow-
ers, looking around, thinking some-
thing is happening here in this wonder-
ful, bountiful State that I live in. The 
crops that are grown traditionally are 
not producing what they did tradition-
ally, unless some hybrid seeds and 
other fertilizers are being used. There

are new weather conditions and it is 
changing every year and it is not get-
ting better. It is getting dryer and hot-
ter. 
So when Joe Biden starts talking 
about the next generation of energy in 
America, I think about my grand-
daughter, ‘‘Little Jo.’’ I think about 
Jo, and I am wondering what kind of 
world she is going to live in and what 
I am going to do about it. 
One thing that President Biden said 
was, we are moving toward electric ve-
hicles. You would think that it was 
some Federal mandate that is bringing 
this on. But if you read the newspapers, 
you know it isn’t. General Motors has 
accelerated the timetable to go to elec-
tric vehicles, Ford as well. They see 
the writing on the wall. 
What we currently use for transpor-
tation will not be what we use in 10 or 
15 years. It is going to change. We are 
going to move to electric vehicles for a 
variety of reasons, not the least of 
which is there are fewer emissions, 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
The country of Norway just an-
nounced last week that over 50 percent 
of their vehicles are electric vehicles. 
If you had been there in the recent 
past, you see Teslas in every direction, 
electric vehicles in every direction. 
I spoke to the Ambassador from Nor-
way, and I said: How did that happen? 
How did you move to a point where 
more than half the vehicles in Norway 
are electric vehicles? 
She said: Tax breaks. We gave them 
tax breaks. And all of a sudden, every-
one had a new lifestyle with electric 
vehicles. And they think that protects 
them in the future or at least holds the 
possibility of reducing the pollution 
that they are dealing with, and I think 
they are right. So does Joe Biden. But 
when we get into an infrastructure de-
bate with Republicans, the first thing 
they say is: Take electric vehicles off 
the table. We don’t want to even talk 
about it. No subsidies, no encourage-
ment for those. 
Traditionally, we have been encour-
aging oil companies, with all sorts of 
tax breaks throughout their history, to 
continue to explore and grow in size 
and make a lot of money. But the no-
tion of encouraging electric vehicles is 
somehow heretical to our friends on 
the Republican side. I think it is very 
shortsighted. 
I think we should look at the obvi-
ous. I tell this story, and it is worth re-
peating. Six years ago, we had an auto 
plant in Normal, IL—yes, that is the 
name of it: Normal, IL. Six years ago, 
Mitsubishi closed their auto plant. 
There were more than 1,000 people 
working there, and there was that big 
sprawling complex just off of Interstate 
55. Every time you took that interstate 
and looked out there, you thought: 
That is going to be there forever. That 
building is just going to deteriorate 
and be there forever. 
Well, guess what. A year after they 
closed, the mayor of Normal, IL, whose 
name 
is 
Chris 
Koos—a 
wonderful 
mayor—called me and said: Senator, I 
think I have a buyer for the Mitsubishi 
plant. 
I said: What kind of buyer? 
He said: There is a man who wants to 
build electric vehicles. He came down 
and took a look, and he liked that 
plant. He said it was way too big for his 
purposes, but he is actually thinking of 
building electric vehicles in the old 
Mitsubishi plant. 
Darned if it didn’t happen. The com-
pany is called Rivian. They bought 
that plant, and they started building 
electric vehicles—just this month, offi-
cially, in production. 
How many workers will they have? 
Up to 4,000, maybe even 5,000. Will they 
be able to use the whole plant? They 
are now building an addition to the 
plant. Is it a viable company? Is it 
going to last? Well, obviously Amazon 
thinks so because they have invested a 
billion dollars in Rivian. And the com-
panies are coming from all around 
thinking this is the future. 
So I say to the Senator from Ken-
tucky, yes, there will be transitions in 
jobs, but there are job opportunities at 
Rivian and places just like that. Lion 
Electric is another company. It came 
in from Canada. They build electric 
buses. One of the things we are envi-
sioning 
is 
moving 
toward 
electric 
schoolbuses across America. That is a 
big move. This is a company that 
builds them. 
We need more just like it, and there 
are going to be good-paying jobs associ-
ated with it. 
EVBox is a company out of the Neth-
erlands, located in my State again. 
They build the charging stations. 
Closing your eyes to the opportuni-
ties here is very shortsighted. Things 
are changing, and changing for the bet-
ter. And because there is change, it 
doesn’t mean it is bad for everybody. 
There are transitions, and we ought to 
help with educating people, preparing 
them for the new jobs. 
But if you look around at this world 
and what is happening with the weath-
er patterns and the environment, how 
shortsighted it would be for us to say 
to our kids and grandkids: Well, we had 
a chance back in 2021 to do something 
about it, but we decided it just might 
make people uneasy to think about 
that much change. 
Well, I feel uneasy about the change 
that is coming if we do nothing. It is 
going to be a dramatic change for the 
worse for our kids. 
f 
VLADIMIR PUTIN 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, on 
another topic, this notion that Joe 
Biden is being pushed around by Vladi-
mir Putin—the Senator who made that 
statement on the floor, or one just like 
it, has he ignored what happened over 
the last 4 years? 
Every time the President of the 
United States, Donald Trump, would 
meet with Vladimir Putin, they would 
ask the translators to leave the room, 
the people from the intelligence agen-
cies to leave the room, and they would 
just play pat-a-cake. I mean, we know 
what was going on there. There was 
some sort of political bromance be-
tween the President and Vladimir 
Putin. 
I don’t believe that is ever going to 
happen with Joe Biden. He is a realist. 
He made it clear that he went in that 
meeting with Putin to lay down the 
law in terms of infiltrating our elec-
tions in the future and the activities 
that we have seen in hacking and cyber 
crimes. 
That is the kind of leadership we 
need in dealing with Vladimir Putin. 
f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
today I want to speak about two really 
highly qualified judicial nominees the 
Senate Judiciary Committee came up 
with through the White House. 
The 
first 
is 
Candace 
Jackson- 
Akiwumi, who has been nominated to 
an Illinois seat on the Seventh Circuit. 
With her qualifications, temperament, 
and range of experience, she is out-
standing. 
She is the daughter of two judges. 
Her father, Raymond Jackson, is a 
Federal district court judge, and her 
mother, Gwendolyn Jones Jackson, is a 
retired State court judge. 
She went to Princeton and then Yale 
Law School—not bad. She clerked for 
Judge David Coar on the U.S. District 
Court for the Northern District and for 
Roger Gregory on the Fourth Circuit. 
After her clerkships, she worked in 
private practice, and then she made an 
interesting career decision, and not 
many people make it. She decided to 
stop practicing in the private practice 
of law and become a staff attorney at 
the Federal Defender Program for the 
Northern 
District 
of 
Illinois, 
rep-
resenting people who couldn’t afford 
counsel. 
Ms. Jackson-Akiwumi spent 10 years 
as a Federal public defender. She de-
fended hundreds of indigent clients at 
every stage of the legal process. She is 
a real lawyer. She knows that court-
room inside and out, and she knows the 
legal process as well. 
Ms. Jackson-Akiwumi’s experience 
and perspective on the criminal justice 
system will be an asset in the Seventh 
Circuit. If she is approved, she will be 
the second woman of color to be in that 
circuit. It is about time. 
Her skills and legal expertise will be 
invaluable. She received a ‘‘well quali-
fied’’ rating by the ABA. 
She has a great temperament. One of 
our Senators on the Judiciary Com-
mittee tried to trap her with a ques-
tion, seeing just whether she knew 
enough about the law. When it was all 
over, I think he was satisfied that she 
did. 
She spoke to the fact that her moth-
er taught her how important it is for 
judges to listen and for litigants to be 
heard. This is a fundamental principle

in our system of justice. She is going 
to devote her life to defending the rule 
of law in the future, as she has in the 
past. I really think she is going to be 
extraordinary. 
The second nominee the Senate will 
vote on this week has my strong sup-
port as well, Judge Deborah Boardman, 
nominated to the U.S. District Court 
for the District of Maryland. 
She serves as a U.S. magistrate judge 
in the Maryland District Court. Like 
Jackson-Akiwumi, she has received a 
‘‘well qualified’’ rating from the ABA. 
She, too, will bring diversity to the 
courts. 
She spent 11 years as a Federal public 
defender herself. She is bringing a per-
spective which is often not found in 
these court cases with sitting judges. I 
have nothing against former prosecu-
tors. I have named a lot of them to the 
bench. But we ought to have diversity 
in background, experience, and the 
like. 
She has experience in private prac-
tice. She is a dedicated public servant, 
and I hope my colleagues will support 
her. 
f 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
watched television Sunday night with 
my wife. There was a movie called 
‘‘Selma.’’ Oprah Winfrey had some-
thing to do with it because she was in 
it, and it was, as you might expect, a 
quality production. 
It told the story of what happened in 
1965 in Selma, AL. It showed the hor-
rific images of Americans being beaten 
and brutalized in Selma for daring to 
protest peacefully. For what? For the 
right to vote. 
Fewer 
people 
know about Turn-
around Tuesday. That was the day, 2 
days after Bloody Sunday, when many 
of the same people who had been beat-
en on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on 
Bloody Sunday went back to that 
bridge to make it plain that they were 
going to come back again and again 
until every right of every citizen to 
vote was secured. That was Turnaround 
Tuesday. 
I had a lucky experience. The late 
John Lewis, who marched across that 
Edmund Pettus Bridge and almost gave 
his life in the process, took me, one 
foggy Sunday morning, for a walk 
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and 
he told me what he remembered from 
that day. 
I have seen pictures over and over 
again. There he is in his white rain-
coat, with a backpack, marching in the 
front of the line, and how he was 
bashed in the head by either a trooper 
or someone who came along trying to 
stop them from marching. He almost 
died as a result of it. It was something 
I will never forget. I feel blessed that I 
had that experience. 
And then there was the vote on the 
floor yesterday. What a disappoint-
ment. Today, I want to say it is ‘‘wel-
come back’’ Wednesday. Welcome back 
to the fight to preserve voting rights 
that has never ended. 
It didn’t start on that bridge in 
Selma, and it won’t end in this Cham-
ber in Washington. This battle is going 
to continue because there are those 
people who know that if you want to 
control America politically, you have 
got to control those who vote. 
We saw it after the Civil War, when 
we ended slavery and African Ameri-
cans initially had an opportunity to 
vote and lead in Southern States. And 
then, sad to report, my political party, 
the Democratic Party at that time, 
was part of initiating the Jim Crow 
laws, which made it difficult, if not im-
possible, to vote. 
And the battle was on, and it is being 
waged to this day, about whether or 
not African Americans have a right to 
vote. Make no mistake. When Repub-
licans come to the floor and go through 
these long, elaborate explanations of 
why a coordinated effort by Republican 
legislatures in 20 different States is 
just good government, I think they 
know better. It is not good govern-
ment, and it is not good for the people 
of those States, particularly if you are 
a minority. 
Well, this fight to prevent billion-
aires from buying elections and root 
out corruption in government didn’t 
end with that filibuster yesterday. Re-
publicans succeeded in delaying this 
debate for a time, but they are not 
going to derail it. This is too impor-
tant. Our democracy is on the line. 
Five months ago—I am sure Madam 
President will never forget it, as I 
won’t—a murderous mob—five people 
died—a murderous mob attacked this 
Capitol and tried to overturn the Presi-
dential election. 
Who sent them? Well, it is clear to 
me who sent them: a vain, self-pitying 
former President who couldn’t accept 
defeat or the will of the American peo-
ple. So Donald Trump created a Big Lie 
that the election was stolen. He used 
that lie to incite that mob to attack 
this Capitol. He continues to peddle the 
Big Lie from his exile at some country 
club. 
Now the party that coddled that 
failed President when he was in power 
is weaponizing the Big Lie and using it 
to justify a relentless attack on voting 
rights across America. 
Three weeks ago, Senate Republicans 
used the filibuster to kill a bill cre-
ating an independent, bipartisan com-
mission to investigate who was behind 
this January 6 insurrection. They 
killed it with the filibuster, just as 
they tried to kill the voting rights bill 
yesterday. That filibuster is an echo, 
sadly, of how it has been used in the 
area of civil rights for as long as it has 
been in the Senate. 
This Big Lie is metastasizing; it is 
growing. Instead of stopping it, Repub-
licans are using all their leverage to 
prevent us from confronting it. The fil-
ibuster yesterday was day one of this 
fight. It wasn’t the end of the story. 
Welcome to day two. We mean to 
keep marching until we cross that 
bridge and stop this assault on our de-
mocracy and put an end to the Big Lie 
once and for all. 
I yield the floor.

DEMOCRATIC AGENDA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, it seems that for the past month 
Senate Republicans have watched as 
our Democratic colleagues send up one 
partisan test balloon after another. 
They threatened a battle over a so- 
called equal pay bill, which turned out 
to be chum in the water for the trial 
lawyers but really not much else. Then 
they, once again, threatened the Sec-
ond Amendment, but they couldn’t find 
a friend across party lines to join them 
in that fight. So that trial balloon was 
popped. 
And who could forget their promise 
to bring the improperly named Equal-
ity Act to the floor for a vote? Well, 
that balloon didn’t take flight either. 
And, yesterday, the Democrats’ democ-
racy-destroying election takeover bill 
almost survived, but it too came crash-
ing back to Earth after failing to clear 
a procedural hurdle. 
Still, they have made the most of 
their time over the past month, hold-
ing up their string of failures as evi-
dence that it is the filibuster and not 
the radically partisan nature of their 
agenda 
that 
is 
thwarting 
their 
progress. 
As the Republican leader said at the 
beginning of this month, it was an 
agenda that was designed to fail. It 
failed to bring them the power that 
they are craving to have over the lives 
of millions of Americans. It failed to 
kill the filibuster, and it certainly 
failed the millions of Americans who 
have been forced to watch, dumb-
founded, as this circus played out in 
realtime on their television screens.

It was a complete waste of our time. 
It is what one of my Tennesseans said 
this weekend, talking about these trial 
balloons, talking about this lurch to 
the left—and Madam President, this 
was a friend of mine who is a Demo-
crat—as he said, it was a complete 
waste of our time, the American peo-
ple’s time. He added: It was a complete 
waste of my dime—for the tax dollars 
that he sends to Washington, DC. He 
went on to say: Think about the prob-
lems you could have solved if you had 
been focused on making some progress 
instead of creating chaos. 
Yesterday, the Commerce Committee 
held a hearing on achieving broadband 
resiliency. As you well know, this is 
one of the most important infrastruc-
ture problems that not only faces our 
committee but also faces this body. We 
had a great discussion, and I thanked 
Chairman LUJA´ N for that hearing. But 
I can’t help but wonder how much more 
progress we would have been able to 
make on this issue if the 14 million 
unserved 
rural 
Americans—yes, 
unserved; they have nothing—think 
about the progress we could have made 
if those 14 million unserved Americans 
had taken precedence in the minds and 
in the agenda of our friends across the 
aisle. It would have been great to focus 
on that. 
Speaking of infrastructure, perhaps 
we could have focused more energy on 
giving the needed authority to our 
local officials so they can fix crum-
bling roads and bridges and getting 
regulations out of their way so they 
can go to work helping people get to 
work and helping children get back to 
school. Certainly, I know a few officials 
in Memphis who would love to see us 
start thinking long term about prac-
tical 
infrastructure 
support 
that 
doesn’t include the Green New Deal 
fantasies that are favored by this 
White House. 
The American people have noticed 
this lack of focus and this freewheeling 
attitude when it comes to spending 
taxpayers’ money. When they look 
around, they see real need. There are 
businesses and families who are still 
struggling to pull themselves out of 
the ashes of the pandemic. Policies 
that are favored by the Democrats 
would be policies that would bankrupt 
their businesses, that would drive up 
the debt, and that would cause massive 
inflation. Tennesseans know these poli-
cies are not going to help them. What 
it does do is to frustrate them. Neither 
will the Democrats’ continued failure 
to manage President Biden’s border 
crisis. 
In April, Customs and Border Protec-
tion apprehended 178,000 people at-
tempting to illegally cross our border. 
Fourteen thousand of these were unac-
companied alien children. It is a record 
year for drug runners, for the cartels, 
for bootleggers, for human traffickers, 
and for sex traffickers. We caught the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services actually finishing the work of 
the cartels, trafficking many of those 
unaccompanied minors through the 
Chattanooga 
Airport 
without 
the 
knowledge or the involvement of local 
officials. 
Meanwhile, 
my 
Democratic 
col-
leagues are treating this humanitarian 
crisis as if it is nothing more than a lo-
gistics challenge. But perhaps if we had 
spent more time on this in the past 
month, we could have convinced them 
that until they get this crisis under 
control, they would have to admit, in 
this country right now, every town is a 
border town; every State, a border 
State. Just ask your local law enforce-
ment. They will tell you. Perhaps they 
didn’t want to put the time there be-
cause they had been busy putting a 
show on for the cameras and their 
friends on the left. 
Tennesseans noticed what went on 
here this month. They are not happy 
about it. They have been reaching out. 
They don’t have the luxury of playing 
political games. They don’t have the 
spare resources to gamble on woke pol-
itics. They are trying to keep the doors 
of their businesses and their churches 
and their schools and their factories 
open. 
We did a lot of talking this month, 
but the friends on the left chose not to 
take action to solve problems. I would 
encourage them to do a little soul- 
searching over the next couple of 
weeks and address the agenda that the 
American people would seek to have 
addressed. 
I yield the floor.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 1652 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last 
week, I told the story of a mother who 
received critical support from an orga-
nization called Life Span in Chicago 
after her daughter was sexually as-
saulted by the mother’s husband. The 
services provided by Life Span were 
paid for by the Victims of Crime Act, 
VOCA. 
This week, I want to tell you another 
story that is even more troubling, but 
it dramatizes the need for us to act 
today, this afternoon. I am going to 
use the name ‘‘Sasha,’’ not the real 
name of the woman involved. She is a 
mother of three kids, and she was liv-
ing with a man who was unpredictable 
and dangerous. 
He tried to kill her—not once but 
three times. He tried strangling her, 
and the third time, she passed out. 
When she woke up with the kids near-
by, she knew that was it. She couldn’t 
take it anymore. So she went to a hos-
pital. She was scared to death. She 
heard about a group called Harbor 
House. Harbor House is basically a do-
mestic violence survivors center. 
I would tell my colleagues in the 
Senate, if you have ever visited a do-
mestic violence survivors center and 
met with any of the victims, you will 
never forget it. I swear, you will never 
forget it. I can remember the first time 
I met with one of the victims in one of 
the shelters. She was crying. Her eyes 
were red, one eye was blackened, and 
she choked back the tears and told me 
the story of what she lived through. 
For some reason—and I am not a psy-
chologist; 
I 
can’t 
explain 
it—she 
blamed herself. And it happens so 
often.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4713 
June 23, 2021 
What happens to these women who 
are the victims of domestic violence 
abuse? Where do they go? Some of 
them can’t find anywhere to go and end 
up dying as a result of it. What hap-
pens to their kids who witness these 
acts of violence in the home when mom 
is getting strangled by this man? What 
happens to them? Well, luckily, we 
care enough in America to do some-
thing about it. Through VOCA and the 
Crime Victims Fund, we send money to 
Harbor House and Life Span and other 
agencies and say: Do your best. Help 
them put their lives back together 
again. Protect them. 
Well, I want to fast-forward and tell 
you that 6 months after Sasha’s experi-
ence, things are much better. She lives 
safely in an apartment. She still works 
with adult counselors and youth coun-
selors to get herself and her kids 
through this, and she knows that she is 
not alone. These VOCA-funded advo-
cates stepped into her life at just the 
right moment and saved her life. They 
may have saved the lives of her chil-
dren too. 
So when we cut back on funding for 
whatever reason, we are jeopardizing 
the services that I just described that 
are so critical. 
With decreased VOCA funding—if we 
do 
nothing 
today, 
with 
decreased 
VOCA funding, Harbor House will have 
to cut its staffers, exactly the types of 
professionals who helped Sasha and her 
family. 
The executive director said: 
If VOCA is cut, imagine being Sasha and 
having to go through all of that alone. 
That is why we have to pass this bill. 
That is why it is so critical. 
As I noted last week, VOCA passed in 
1984 to establish the Crime Victims 
Fund. We can’t even count the number 
of people who have been helped over 
the years. Three thousand applicants 
come through my State Attorney Gen-
eral’s Office in Illinois, and every State 
has a similar story to tell of thousands 
of victims helped by service providers, 
victims of domestic violence, sexual as-
sault, child abuse, trafficking, and 
drunk drivers. 
And the Crime Victims Fund doesn’t 
receive a dime of taxpayers’ dollars. 
How about that? What I just described 
for you doesn’t come out of the Treas-
ury. It is funded through criminal 
fines, penalties, forfeited bail bonds, 
and special assessments collected by 
the Federal Government. 
Historically, most of the money 
comes from criminal fines, but in re-
cent years, deposits have dropped off 
significantly. That is why we are here 
at this moment. They need help, and 
they need it now. 
Monetary penalties from deferred 
prosecutions and nonprosecution agree-
ments are currently deposited in the 
Treasury instead of the fund. As a re-
sult, the shift has had a devastating 
impact on the fund. That is why a bi-
partisan, bicameral group of Members 
of Congress, working with advocacy or-
ganizations, have come up with this 
VOCA fix. Our bill would stabilize the 
depleted fund by redirecting monetary 
penalties from deferred prosecutions 
and nonprosecution agreements to the 
victims and service providers who need 
the help. 
The reduced deposits into the fund 
have already had a devastating impact. 
Victim assistance grants have been re-
duced by more than $600 million in this 
year. And more cuts are coming if we 
don’t do something today. 
Like Harbor House, advocates across 
the State and across the country are 
begging for help. We don’t have any 
time to waste. Every day that goes by, 
we miss an opportunity to help replen-
ish the fund and to put these services 
on the street. 
So far this year, the fund has already 
missed out on a total of nearly $550 
million in deposits that could be help-
ing these agencies, and we are not even 
halfway through the year. That is why 
it is imperative that we pass this bill. 
The House already did it in March, 3 
months ago—broad bipartisan support. 
Here in the Senate, we have a broad bi-
partisan 
coalition 
of 
Senators—36 
Democrats and 21 Republicans. We all 
get it. We are all for crime victims. But 
we have been stopped because of an ob-
jection on the floor. 
Let’s end this today. Whatever the 
merits of any budgetary argument, for 
goodness’ sake, lives are at stake here. 
Unfortunately, this objection about 
moving forward was made last week, 
and it probably will be made again 
today. It involves Senator TOOMEY’s 
concern about a budgetary issue. It is a 
complicated issue about something 
called CHIMPs, for goodness’ sake, 
which he can explain, and I am sure he 
will. 
But after last week’s argument on 
this, I went to the advocates who are 
telling us that we should send this 
money as quickly as we can and said: Is 
he right? Is this designed, without his 
amendment, so that this money will 
not go to the people who need it? 
They said he is wrong. This is not 
going to happen. 
Here is their statement: ‘‘During 
floor remarks for the unanimous con-
sent [last week], it was represented the 
VOCA Fix Act fails to correct certain 
structural issues that prevent the 
funds from reaching victims and their 
advocates. The premise of this state-
ment—that these structural issues im-
pact the distribution of VOCA funds to 
survivors and advocates—is not accu-
rate.’’ 
This is from the actual agencies 
themselves. 
‘‘While the use of CHIMPS (Changes 
in Mandatory Programs) as budget off-
sets continues to be a contentious 
issue, the claim that Appropriators 
hoard money rather than releasing it 
to victim service providers is false.’’ 
Inaccurate and false. 
‘‘In reality, Appropriators have sub-
stantially decreased the size of the 
budget offset by releasing far more 
than the amount required by the pro-
posed substitute, and the proposed sub-
stitute intended to restructure the en-
tire appropriations process is incred-
ibly controversial.’’ 
In other words, we are going to dive 
into the deep end of the pool on budget 
process, budget rules, and budget regu-
lation while people are literally drown-
ing in violence—victims of domestic 
abuse. 
For goodness’ sake, isn’t there a bet-
ter time and place and a better group 
to hold hostage? It shouldn’t be these 
domestic violence cases. 
I yield at this point to the Senator 
from Rhode Island. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I won’t speak long, but I wanted 
to echo the comments of our distin-
guished Judiciary chairman, because I 
have had a similar experience. 
As we were going through COVID, I 
was hearing from our domestic vio-
lence groups in Rhode Island that two 
things were happening at once. In-
stances were going up. People were 
trapped together. It was very difficult 
to find sanctuary houses to go to, and 
the experience of domestic violence 
was soaring. And while that was going 
on, the funding coming into these 
agencies through VOCA was declining. 
Now there is a pretty simple—well, 
first let me thank the Rhode Island Co-
alition Against Domestic Violence and 
Sojourner House, which provides sanc-
tuary services, and Progreso Latino, 
which works in this space in our 
Latino community, for their great 
work. There are a lot of organizations 
in this space, and I want to start by ap-
preciating them. 
The problem has nothing to do with 
domestic violence or domestic violence 
victims as to the money. The problem 
is that more and more of these cases 
are resolved by deferred prosecution 
and nonprosecution agreements, but 
the funding for VOCA comes out of 
criminal sentences, criminal prosecu-
tions. So because of that change in the 
way these cases are treated—which is 
actually a good thing, generally—the 
money is diverted, and, as a result, the 
Crime Victims Fund has reached its 
lowest level in 10 years. 
The 
victim 
assistance 
grants 
in 
Rhode Island fell 50 percent—5–0 per-
cent—cut in half from fiscal year 2016 
to fiscal year 2021, from $7.6 million to 
$3.8 million, which means that many of 
these local organizations that put their 
heart and soul into protecting these 
victims at the worst time in their lives 
have to deal with 50-percent cuts. 
This is simple. It will allow monetary 
penalties in those deferred prosecu-
tions and nonprosecution agreements 
to flow the same way they flow when 
traditional prosecutions take place. 
This is endorsed across the board. 
This is as noncontroversial as you 
get—56 State and Territorial attorneys 
general, more than 1,700 local, Tribal, 
State, regional, and national advocacy, 
government, and law enforcement or-
ganizations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4714 
June 23, 2021 
Just this year, $545 million has been 
lost to the VOCA fund because we 
haven’t corrected this. So I would echo 
my chairman’s remarks and urge my 
friend, the Senator from Pennsylvania, 
to find another point of leverage, an-
other fulcrum, for his efforts to solve 
unrelated problems, but let this prob-
lem be solved and let these victims be 
served. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The Senator from Illi-
nois. 
Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator 
from Rhode Island. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of H.R. 1652, which was received 
from the House and is at the desk; fur-
ther, that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed, and the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I have good 
news for my colleagues from Illinois 
and Rhode Island, and that is that the 
modification that I am suggesting to 
the unanimous consent request prof-
fered by the Senator from Illinois is 
not complicated. It has nothing to do 
with budget rules, and, in fact, it is the 
simplest thing in the world. 
Now, the Senator from Illinois wants 
to put more money and money from a 
new source into the Crime Victims 
Fund. I completely agree. I fully sup-
port it. I have liked this idea from the 
first time I heard of it, and I supported 
it. 
But there is something that is impor-
tant to note here. The Crime Victims 
Fund is a Federal Government account, 
and the Senator is very determined 
that more money go into that account. 
So what do we disagree on? Well, it is 
very simple. The Senator from Illinois 
seems to be equally determined that 
there can be no requirement that the 
money actually come out of that ac-
count and go to crime victims and 
their advocates. That is the only thing 
that I want to do differently. It is to 
insist that money going into that ac-
count actually comes out and goes to 
the victims of crime and their advo-
cates. 
Now, if my concern that this money 
is not going to end up going where it is 
advertised to go is not valid, then, I 
don’t 
know 
why 
my 
colleagues 
wouldn’t agree to my very narrow 
amendment which, by the way, doesn’t 
have a thing to do with budget rules. I 
don’t attempt to change budget rules 
in this effort. We should change them, 
but this isn’t where I am trying to do 
it. What I am simply trying to do is to 
make sure that the money that goes 
into the account—the increase, too— 
actually goes to where it is supposed to 
go, which is to the victims of crimes 
and their advocates. 
So you have to ask yourself: Why 
would somebody oppose the proposal 
that this money actually be required to 
go to victims and their advocates? Why 
would somebody oppose that? 
Maybe it is because there is some 
other place that some of this money is 
meant to go, and that is at the heart of 
this. See, under the ridiculous rules we 
operate under, if the money doesn’t end 
up going to crime victims and their ad-
vocates, then, it frees up additional 
money to be spent on whatever any-
body else wants to spend it on. The 
money that is withheld from the people 
who are supposed to get it, crime vic-
tims and their advocates, creates the 
opportunity to spend more on who 
knows what. 
Now, would anyone actually do this 
or is this just a theoretical construct 
that I have made up? Well, let’s take a 
look at the recent history. The fact is, 
since 2000, in the year 2000, over $80 bil-
lion that could have and should have 
gone to crime victims and their advo-
cates was intentionally withheld so 
that more money could be spent in 
other categories. 
What this chart shows is the amount 
of money year in and year out. It starts 
in 2000. You see these low bars. Well 
under a billion dollars was actually al-
located to crime victims. 
There was much more money going 
into 
those 
accounts—much 
more 
money—because, you see, how much 
going into the account isn’t the only 
thing that matters. What is actually, 
ultimately, much more important is 
how much comes out of the account 
and goes to the crime victims. And 
only when I and some of my colleagues 
started raising hell about this—the dis-
honesty, the deception, the fact that 
the crime victims and their advocates 
weren’t getting nearly what they were 
supposed to be getting—only then—this 
is the red line that represents when we 
started doing this—that is when the al-
locations started to change. 
This graph represents the huge surge 
in funds that we have been sending to 
crime victims and their advocates in 
recent years because some of us were 
no longer willing to tolerate this and 
we were raising Cain about what had 
been going on. 
Now, what I am simply trying to do 
is to prevent us from going back to 
what was routine around here, what 
was 
standard 
operating 
procedure, 
which was to deceive people, pretend 
that money was going to end up going 
to the Crime Victims Fund when every-
body knew it wasn’t. 
Now, why would I be concerned that 
we might be going back in that direc-
tion? Well, I will tell you why. Presi-
dent Biden has been very instructive 
about this. In his budget that he re-
leased just months ago, he actually 
specifies that in his budget he wants 
money to be diverted from the crime 
victims fund, which is mentioned by 
name, and one other fund, so that more 
money can be spent on other purposes. 
This is my concern. This isn’t some-
thing that has been made up. This is 
President Biden in his budget asking us 
to go right back to what we used to do. 
So, then, when I come down here and 
I suggest one modification to the very 
constructive idea that we add this set-
tlement money to the fund, and the 
modification is that the money actu-
ally has to go to crime victims and 
their advocates, that is objected to. 
People are insistent that we not have a 
requirement that this money actually 
be allocated. 
So someone might think that that is 
a pretty strong body of evidence that 
suggests that maybe all of this money 
isn’t going to end up where it is sup-
posed to go. 
Therefore, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senator modify his request to 
include my amendment, which is at the 
desk; that it be considered and agreed 
to; and that the bill, as amended, be 
considered read a third time and 
passed, and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, if you listen to 
this explanation, there is one thing 
missing and it is critical. There is a 
suggestion that this money for the 
Crime Victims Fund is being spent for 
another purpose. You never heard that, 
did you? It said it could be, maybe it 
will be, it might be—but it hasn’t been. 
Listen to what they say, these people 
in the advocacy groups are jealously 
watching every penny. They want 
every dollar, just as you do and I do. 
And what do they say about your argu-
ment? 
The premise of your statement that 
these structural issues impact the dis-
tribution of the victims funds to sur-
vivors and advocates is not accurate. It 
goes on to say that the claim that ap-
propriators hoard the money rather 
than releasing it to victims services is 
false. This is from the very agencies re-
ceiving the money. 
Are they in on the deal, Senator? 
I don’t think so. They are desperate 
for these funds, and without them, they 
are going to have a serious cutback in 
services. 
The proposed substitute intended to 
restructure the entire appropriations 
process is incredibly controversial, and 
you know it and I know it as a member 
of the Appropriations Committee. Yet 
you are tangling up this relief for the 
victims of crime, victims of domestic 
abuse, women who are seeking shelter 
and hospital care and trying to care for 
their children and what they are going 
through. You want to hold back on the 
possibility—the possibility—that some-
body is going to spend this on some-
thing else, even though you have no 
proof that it has been done—none. 
And the people who are the advocates 
for these groups are saying to you: 
What you are saying is inaccurate and 
false. 
And you won’t give it up.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4715 
June 23, 2021 
I would suggest: Pick another target. 
Find some other group to make your 
budget point of order. Please don’t 
take this out on these people who are 
in the most desperate situations in 
their life. This is not the time and 
place to raise this budget debate. I seri-
ously hope that you will think about 
them for a moment. 
I object to your modification. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection to the original request? 
Mr. TOOMEY. Reserving the right to 
object, this is an amazing argument 
that the Senator from Illinois is mak-
ing. He is saying: Don’t worry. He 
would never do what the Senator from 
Pennsylvania is suggesting might hap-
pen and which, by the way, always used 
to happen, and, which, by the way, the 
President is asking us to do. We would 
never do it. Oh, but I will object to a 
requirement that the money actually 
go where we say it is going to go. 
I think that tells us all we need to 
know. So I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2084 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
it has been a trying year for our Na-
tion. 
Thankfully, 
the 
vaccine 
has 
brought so much hope and a semblance 
of normalcy back to the lives of many 
Americans. 
As families and businesses in Florida 
and across the United States continue 
to work hard to recover from the dev-
astation of COVID–19, travel is critical 
to get our economy fully reopened. 
From the beginning of the pandemic, 
I encouraged everyone to wear a mask 
as we learned more about this virus, 
but now the science is clear that broad 
mask mandates aren’t necessary. Un-
fortunately, the CDC has decided to 
buck the science when it comes to 
travel and is still requiring face masks 
on public transportation. 
We have all heard the stories of how 
this mandate impacts families: a moth-
er and her six children traumatized by 
being kicked off a flight after her 2- 
year-old daughter refused to wear a 
mask; a New Jersey couple forced to 
deplane 
because 
their 
2-year-old 
wouldn’t wear a mask; a Colorado 
mother and their family booted off a 
flight over fears their 3-year-old son, 
who has a disability, wouldn’t wear a 
mask; an Orthodox Jewish family 
kicked off a flight because their 15- 
month-old baby was not wearing a 
mask. 
You can’t make this stuff up. It has 
made traveling with children nearly 
impossible. After a year of hardships 
and being apart from loved ones, these 
families were denied the ability to re-
connect. It is awful and unnecessary. 
And I hear stories all the time about 
parents with young children deciding, I 
am not getting on an airplane because 
I know I will get kicked off or I might 
get kicked off. 
And to make guidelines even more 
confusing, you are allowed to remove 
your mask to eat and drink. So why is 
it OK and totally safe to not have a 
mask while you eat a snack but dan-
gerous to be unmasked any other time? 
The CDC itself has been clear that 
mask mandates aren’t needed. You 
don’t have to wear a mask in a res-
taurant. You don’t have to wear a 
mask in a hotel. You don’t have to 
wear a mask at a school. You don’t 
have to wear a mask in a stadium. So 
why is the CDC singling out airlines 
and public transportation? It doesn’t 
make any sense. 
This isn’t a political argument. In 
fact, during our Commerce Committee 
markup of the surface transportation 
measure last week, both Democrats 
and Republicans expressed frustration 
at the continuation of the mask man-
date. Republican and Democratic Gov-
ernors and mayors across the country 
have followed the science and lifted 
mask mandates. 
Just like the Federal Government 
should not be in the business of requir-
ing Americans to turn over their vac-
cination records, the Federal Govern-
ment should not be mandating citizens 
wear masks on public transportation. 
That is why I introduced the Stop 
Mandating 
Additional 
Requirements 
for Travel, or SMART Act, which 
would revoke the Federal requirement 
for Americans to wear masks on public 
transportation. Americans should be 
free to make choices they feel are in 
the best interest of their own health 
and the health of their loved ones. 
If someone wants to wear a mask, 
they are absolutely free to do so, but 
the government has no right to tell 
them what to do. If an airline or other 
private company decides it wants to 
implement a mask policy, so be it. This 
does not prohibit them from doing so. 
I have been clear. Private companies 
should be able to make decisions that 
they feel are appropriate for their em-
ployees and their customers. And their 
customer gets to make a decision. 
This bill is pure common sense, and I 
am glad to be joined today by my col-
league from Utah, Senator LEE, and he 
will be speaking after I ask for the con-
sent. 
The science just doesn’t support 
keeping the mask mandate in place. 
We have to listen to the science and 
work together to move America for-
ward. I know Americans will do the 
right thing to stay safe, and I hope my 
colleagues join me in passing this im-
portant bill. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on HELP be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 2084 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration. I ask unanimous 
consent that the bill be considered read 
a third time and passed and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, right now, 
experts at the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention are continuing to 
update their mask requirements based 
on the latest developments, including 
requirements related to travel. They 
need us to be reinforcing their science- 
based work to keep people safe, not 
overruling it. 
We cannot pretend this pandemic is 
over. This virus is still spreading; it is 
still mutating; it is still costing lives; 
and it is still leaving survivors with 
long-haul symptoms. And the new 
Delta variant is more contagious, more 
likely to send people to the hospital, 
and already in our country. 
We have made great progress on vac-
cinations, but there are still people 
who are not vaccinated, as well as peo-
ple who cannot yet get vaccinated. We 
know masks remain a simple, effective 
way to protect everyone, especially in 
small crowded spaces—in an airplane, 
on a bus, or a train. 
Getting rid of mask requirements for 
travel before the experts tell us it is 
safe to do so is not going to get people 
to their destinations any faster, and it 
is not going to end this pandemic any 
faster. Instead, it will draw things out. 
It will cost time, and it will cost lives. 
To get everyone safely through this 
pandemic, we need to listen to the ex-
perts and let them do their jobs; there-
fore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I echo the 
remarks presented by my friend and 
colleague, the junior Senator from 
Florida. I agree wholeheartedly with 
his analysis. I think it is unfortunate 
that we missed this opportunity to 
enact meaningful change today, change 
that is backed up by science. 
It was in January of this year that 
the Centers for Disease Control ordered 
the mandatory use of masks on planes, 
trains, buses, and other modes of public 
transit of every kind everywhere across 
this country. If Americans failed to 
comply with this mandate, they risked 
being fined or even criminally pros-
ecuted. 
Six months later, the coronavirus 
continues with the CDC refusing to rec-
ognize its own research that the man-
date is no longer defensible. It is now 
June. The vaccine has been made avail-
able for months, COVID cases are 
plummeting, and the country is anx-
ious to return to the way things once 
were. The CDC has even said that vac-
cinated Americans don’t have to wear 
masks and can get their lives back to 
normal. 
More than 45 percent of Americans 
are now fully vaccinated. States are 
lifting their restrictions, and in res-
taurants, stores, and workplaces across 
the country, it is no longer required, 
mercifully, to wear a mask. If Ameri-
cans still want to wear one, they can 
make that decision for themselves. 
They are free to do so. But the CDC’s 
requirement that vaccinated individ-
uals—even 
vaccinated 
individuals—

must wear masks on all forms of public 
transit now blatantly contradicts the 
Agency’s own policies and the Agency’s 
own scientific research. It needlessly 
promotes fear and plays politics with 
the lives of the American people, not to 
mention it has imposed absurd expecta-
tions and serious consequences on chil-
dren and families, especially families 
with children trying to travel. 
You see, after the January mandate, 
the CDC issued a corresponding man-
date that exempted only children over 
the age of 2, in keeping with their 
original mask-wearing guidance, guid-
ance that is among the most stringent 
in the world and, I would add, the most 
unrealistic in the world, when you con-
sider that they require it up to and in-
cluding children as young as 2 years 
old. 
So what have been some of the re-
sults of this guidance? Parents have 
been kicked off and banned from 
flights if their small children refuse to 
wear a mask. For parents of kids with 
disabilities and many parents of espe-
cially small children, compliance has 
been nearly impossible. 
We already know that children, espe-
cially young children, are unlikely to 
contribute to the spread of the virus. 
What we do not know, however, is what 
scientific studies, if any at all, the CDC 
happens to be relying on in reaching 
this guidance—in reaching the conclu-
sions underlying this guidance. 
In fact, several of my colleagues and 
I sent a letter to the Agency with this 
very question more than 2 months ago, 
on April 22, 2021. And now, more than 2 
months later, we have yet to receive an 
answer. It is a very simple question, 
and we have yet to receive any shred, 
any semblance, any scintilla of an an-
swer. I find that unacceptable. 
If the CDC actually believes its own 
research, then it should act like it. And 
if it believes in the vaccines, the very 
vaccines on which we have spent bil-
lions of taxpayer dollars, then it should 
act consistently and instill confidence 
in the American people, rather than 
fear. 
And with the vaccine now free and 
widely available, Americans should be 
able to weigh the cost of the options 
before them and choose for themselves 
whether to receive the vaccine, wheth-
er to wear a mask, or whether to take 
their own precautions free of any man-
dates imposed by their government. 
But if the Federal Government is 
going to have a say in whether or not 
there should be a mandate, it should be 
up to Congress, the sole branch of the 
Federal 
Government 
empowered 
to 
enact law and, not coincidentally, the 
branch elected by and held most ac-
countable to the people at most regular 
intervals. It should be up to this 
branch of government, the legislative 
branch, to enact such a mandate. 
To the extent that the CDC issued 
this mandate, it did so using authority 
delegated to it from Congress. We, in 
Congress, did not pass the mask man-
date, and we do not have to defer to 
those bureaucrats who did. 
The science—the science shows that 
wearing masks should not be Federal 
law, and we should act accordingly. We 
should, moreover, give Americans some 
reason to want to be vaccinated. When 
there is light at the end of the tunnel 
and when they can see there is some 
tangible, immediate benefit to them 
getting vaccinated, they are more like-
ly to do it. If they can safely enter a 
place of mass transit without a mask, 
if they choose to do so, many more peo-
ple will choose to get vaccinated if we 
give them that benefit or if we at least 
allow the operators of those modes of 
transportation to allow people to do 
that. 
We can assert our rightful authority 
and promote sound science and com-
mon sense by supporting the bill intro-
duced by my friend and colleague, Sen-
ator SCOTT of Florida. We need this to 
pass. The American people have suf-
fered through a very, very long COVID 
winter. It is time for them to be able to 
make their own choices. That is what 
we do best as Americans because we be-
lieve in freedom. 
We also believe that whenever the co-
ercive power of government, especially 
the coercive power of the Federal Gov-
ernment is exercised, it must do so 
with the authority of Congress. We 
should never tacitly acquiesce to the 
authority of overlords within a bureau-
cratic Agency who are elected by no 
one and ultimately accountable only to 
themselves. 
We are in charge here. We make the 
law. We shouldn’t blindly defer to any-
one, certainly not the CDC when the 
CDC ignores its own science. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I thank my colleague from Utah for his 
comments. I want to thank his contin-
ued commitment always to make sure 
that we, Congress, handles everything 
we can. We don’t defer constantly to 
the executive branch in making deci-
sions that we should be making. 
This is a simple example of why we 
should be making this decision. This is 
following the science, and I am actu-
ally shocked that my colleague from 
the State of Washington does not want 
to follow the science. 
I don’t understand why my colleague 
from the State of Washington wants 
government to be dictating things. 
Why do we want to dictate to Ameri-
cans how to lead their lives? Why does 
she think that the government—why 
has the government lifted mandates in 
States all across the country but not— 
and why is the CDC fine with every 
place but public transportation? It just 
doesn’t make any sense. 
Americans will do the right thing. It 
is not our job to dictate, to tell them 
how to lead their lives. If someone 
wants to wear a mask, so be it. They 
should do it, but the government has 
no right to tell them that they have to 
wear a mask. If an airline or another 
private company decides it wants to 
implement a mask policy, have at it. 
We shouldn’t prohibit them from want-
ing to do that, but we should not be 
dictating this. 
So I am disappointed that my col-
league from the State of Washington 
didn’t go along, but I think it is impor-
tant for us to always make sure we are 
doing the right thing for the American 
public and, right now, the right thing 
is eliminate the mask mandate on pub-
lic transportation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of two critical nomi-
nations: Jen Easterly’s nomination to 
be the Director of the Cybersecurity 
and Infrastructure Security Agency— 
commonly referred to as CISA—within 
the Department of Homeland Security, 
as well as Robin Carnahan to be the 
Administrator of the General Services 
Administration, or GSA. 
Our country is under attack. Nation- 
state actors and criminal organizations 
are relentlessly targeting our govern-
ment, critical infrastructure, and key 
industries to infiltrate networks, steal 
information, conduct espionage, and 
demand ransom payments. 
These cyber attacks pose a serious 
threat to our national security. As we 
saw from the SolarWinds hack, as well 
as the Colonial Pipeline and JBS 
ransomware attacks, cyber criminals 
are constantly looking to exploit cyber 
security vulnerabilities and find the 
weakest link. We must be vigilant 
about preventing these attacks, and we 
need a strong, coordinated approach 
from across the Federal Government to 
better 
secure 
America’s 
networks. 
That means the Senate needs to con-
firm qualified cyber security nominees 
so that they can get to work imme-
diately. 
CISA is the lead domestic Agency for 
cyber security in the Federal Govern-
ment. It is responsible for ensuring 
that Federal Departments and Agen-
cies—our private sector critical infra-
structure partners—and the American 
people have the resources to detect, to 
withstand, and to respond to cyber at-
tacks. GSA provides a wide range of 
support to Agencies across the govern-
ment. One of GSA’s key functions is to 
provide funding and expertise to help 
Agencies both modernize and secure 
their IT systems and their networks. 
We need Senate-confirmed leadership 
at the top of these critical Agencies, 
and we need it today. 
Ms. Easterly has served for over 
three decades in the Federal Govern-
ment and the private sector. 
Since 2017, Ms. Easterly has led the 
operations center for Morgan Stanley’s 
cyber defense strategy. She was also a 
critical member of the Cyber Solarium 
Commission, which has made 80 rec-
ommendations for cyber deterrence, 25 
of which have already become law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4717 
June 23, 2021 
Prior to joining the private sector, 
Ms. Easterly served as the Special As-
sistant to the President and Senior Di-
rector for Counterterrorism, the Dep-
uty for Counterterrorism at the Na-
tional Security Agency, and was in-
strumental in the design and creation 
of the U.S. Cyber Command. 
On top of all of these incredible ac-
complishments, Ms. Easterly is a two- 
time recipient of the Bronze Star and 
retired from the U.S. Army after more 
than 20 years of service in intelligence 
in cyber operations. 
Ms. Easterly is more than qualified 
for this position, and this body needs 
to confirm her nomination today to 
lead CISA. 
Every day that this body delays con-
firming critical leaders like Ms. Eas-
terly and Ms. Carnahan leaves our Fed-
eral system and our Nation vulnerable 
to cyber attacks. We have already seen 
the damage and the chaos from these 
attacks. The Colonial Pipeline attack 
disrupted the lives of millions of Amer-
icans, created fuel shortages, and sad-
dled customers with high gas prices for 
weeks. The next major breach could be 
even worse. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting Ms. Easterly’s nomination 
to lead CISA and to take on the vital 
mission of strengthening our defenses 
and fighting back against the per-
sistent cyber attacks that threaten our 
Nation each and every day. Cyber secu-
rity and strengthening our Federal net-
works are not partisan issues. Cyber 
attacks put each and every one of us at 
risk. 
I would hope my colleagues will 
allow these nominees to be confirmed 
today so they can keep us safe. 
With that, Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that notwithstanding 
rule XXII, the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of Calendar 
No. 176, Jen Easterly, of New York, to 
be Director of the Cybersecurity and 
Infrastructure Security Agency, De-
partment of Homeland Security, and 
the Senate vote on the nomination 
without intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Reserving the 
right to object, I want to make one 
thing very clear. I am here today to en-
sure accountability to the American 
people. 
I voted to support Ms. Easterly’s con-
firmation in committee last week, and 
if Senator SCHUMER filed for cloture, 
like he has done for dozens of other 
nominees this year, I would vote to 
support her confirmation here on the 
Senate floor. This isn’t about Ms. Eas-
terly. This isn’t about cyber security. 
Remember, we unanimously confirmed 
the National Cyber Director just last 
week. 
I am here today because families in 
my State of Florida and across our Na-
tion deserve accountability, and Presi-
dent Biden has shown a total lack of 
accountability when it comes to ad-
dressing the border crisis. That is why 
I announced last month that I would be 
holding all of President Biden’s nomi-
nees for the Department of Homeland 
Security from being approved through 
our expedited process until he and Vice 
President HARRIS visit the border and 
they see for themselves the crisis their 
failed policies of open borders and am-
nesty have created. 
I understand the White House has 
just announced that Vice President 
HARRIS will be visiting the border later 
this week. I hope that is true. The ad-
ministration has made a lot of prom-
ises that they haven’t kept, like not 
raising taxes, reopening schools quick-
ly, being tough on Communist China— 
the list goes on and on. 
Trust me, I am glad the Vice Presi-
dent seems to be taking my advice and 
finally listening to the American peo-
ple. I truly hope that she gets down to 
the border to see the crisis firsthand 
that her administration and their 
failed policies have created. 
I hope she meets with the National 
Border Patrol Council and hears from 
them what our brave CBP agents are 
going through every day to keep us 
safe. 
I hope she meets with border commu-
nity sheriffs who are responsible for 
keeping our families safe. 
I hope she meets with ICE and CBP 
section chiefs so she can hear firsthand 
the impact on them. 
I hope she takes an aerial tour, like 
I did, and sees the gaps in the wall. 
I hope she sees where the lights and 
cameras are sitting powerless, without 
electricity, and unable to be used to 
monitor our border. 
I hope she meets with families who 
have been the victims of trafficking 
and hears the horrific stories they have 
and what they have been through be-
cause of this crisis. 
I hope she visits border communities 
that have been put in a position to 
house and care for the historic number 
of people illegally crossing our border. 
I hope she talks with families who 
have tragically lost loved ones from 
the massive amounts of fentanyl that 
the cartels are moving across our bor-
der. 
I hope she talks to the ranchers im-
pacted by people illegally crossing 
their lands. 
More than anything, I hope this isn’t 
a political stunt. If she truly goes to 
see this crisis, I will lift all of my holds 
of DHS political nominees. It is that 
simple. 
What is happening at the border is a 
crisis; there is simply no other word for 
it. It has been 3 months since I traveled 
to the southern border to see exactly 
how President Biden’s open borders and 
amnesty policies are wreaking havoc. I 
took a tour with Governor Ducey. We 
did an aerial tour. What you see is a 
wall and then all of a sudden, these 
openings. They intentionally didn’t put 
up the gates. 
I remember my colleagues were say-
ing: Oh, we don’t need the wall. We 
have lights and cameras so they can 
monitor from someplace else. 
They are out there; they are just not 
hooked up to electricity, intentionally. 
I mean, you can’t make this stuff up. 
It has been 3 months since I made 
clear that President Biden and Vice 
President HARRIS need to get to the 
border and see the crisis their adminis-
tration has created. It has been 3 
months since they pledged to visit the 
border. Since then, as you all know— 
you look at all the numbers—apprehen-
sions at our southern border are at a 
record high. More than 180,000 illegal 
aliens tried to cross our southern bor-
der last month and were apprehended— 
the highest in 21 years. This is a crisis. 
It threatens our national security and 
the safety of American families. And 
we don’t know how many people we 
didn’t apprehend. 
President Biden’s immigration poli-
cies are putting unaccompanied minors 
at risk of human trafficking, violence, 
sexual abuse, and separation from their 
families. They are leading to an alarm-
ing increase in human trafficking and 
drug smuggling by cartels. 
FBI Director Wray said this month 
that there is ‘‘no question’’ that cartel 
activity from Mexico is ‘‘spilling over’’ 
into the United States. We are seeing it 
here in Florida. I talk to sheriffs. What 
they are telling me is that unbeliev-
able amounts of fentanyl are coming 
across the border and getting into our 
State, putting Florida families in dan-
ger. I was down at one lab, and they 
were telling me that two people died 
that week from fentanyl. 
But instead of securing the border 
and 
finishing 
wall 
construction 
projects, President Biden is termi-
nating all of the wall projects. Why 
would you be doing this? 
The inaction by President Biden and 
Vice President HARRIS is inexcusable. I 
don’t know what they are waiting for. 
Why can’t they acknowledge that a se-
cure border is the best thing for our 
Nation? If you talk to people around 
this country, they want a secure bor-
der. Why can’t they stand up against 
the radical left and say that open bor-
ders are dangerous to American fami-
lies? 
Two weeks ago, the Vice President 
went to Guatemala and Mexico. While 
she was there, she was asked by Lester 
Holt when she was going to go to the 
border, and she laughed. I mean, this is 
not a laughing matter. This is a crisis, 
and people are dying because of this 
crisis. It should make all of us furious. 
People are dying. Children are being 
exploited, and they are being aban-
doned in the desert. Earlier this week, 
two Ecuadorian children—two little 
girls, 3 and 5 years old—were dropped 
over a 14-foot section of the border 
wall. We all saw the pictures. They 
were abandoned there in the middle of 
the night, two innocent little girls, 
just 3 and 5 years old. Can you imagine 
how terrified they were? I mean, I

think of my daughters. I think of my 
grandchildren. We all do. We all think, 
how would our family deal with that? 
It just breaks your heart. 
The Vice President claims the Vice 
President’s trip down to Guatemala 
and Mexico was to talk about the root 
cause of immigration. I don’t believe 
that. The Vice President’s trip wasn’t 
anything more than a poorly executed 
political stunt. 
President Biden and Vice President 
HARRIS need to stop avoiding the crisis, 
stop laughing off this threat, get to the 
border, and take real steps. As I said, 
once they actually go to the border and 
actually see the crisis, I will lift my 
hold. This is all to make sure they go 
to the border. But as long as they 
refuse to help those risking their lives 
every day to keep us safe, as long as 
they refuse to visit the border and put 
an end to the humanitarian crisis they 
created, I am going to keep my holds 
on. 
Those two little girls and all the peo-
ple who have been trafficked—they de-
serve better. The millions of immi-
grants in our country going through a 
legal process—they deserve better. Our 
Border Patrol agents—they deserve 
better. All American families deserve 
better. Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Michigan.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I would 
like to discuss Ms. Carnahan’s quali-
fications further before asking for con-
sent on her confirmation. 
Ms. Carnahan has an extensive career 
spanning Federal and State govern-
ment, as well as the private sector. 
During the Obama administration, she 
founded and led the State and Local 
Practice 
at 
18F, 
a 
technology 
consultancy within GSA. In this role, 
Ms. Carnahan worked with State and 
local government agencies to improve 
and modernize their digital services. 
Prior to her tenure at 18F, Miss Carna-
han served as Missouri’s secretary of 
state, where she focused on modern-
izing IT infrastructure to improve serv-
ice for hundreds of thousands of cus-
tomers. 
Ms. Carnahan is a nationally recog-
nized government technology leader 
and in 2017 was named one of the Fed-
eral Government’s Top Women in Tech. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting Ms. Carnahan’s nomination 
to lead GSA. 
From modernizing and securing Fed-
eral networks to strengthening supply 
chain security, GSA plays a critical 
role in bolstering our national secu-
rity. 
With that, I ask unanimous consent 
that notwithstanding rule XXII, the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of the following nomination: 
Calendar 175. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the nomination. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Robin Carna-
han, of Missouri, to be Administrator 
of General Services. 
Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to 
consider the nomination. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
vote on the nomination without inter-
vening action or debate and, if con-
firmed, the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table, all without intervening action or 
debate; that no further motions be in 
order to the nomination; that any 
statements related to the nomination 
be printed in the RECORD; and that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Carnahan nom-
ination? 
The nomination was confirmed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, after 
months of unnecessary handwringing, 
Vice President HARRIS has finally an-
nounced that she intends to visit the 
U.S.-Mexico border. 
She was, as you will recall, tapped by 
the President to lead the efforts to 
stem the current humanitarian crisis 
back in March. But 3 months in, she 
has spent more time trying to figure 
out how to support Central American 
countries than how to help American 
law enforcement and community lead-
ers in Texas. 
In the absence of any action from the 
administration—in fact, any acknowl-
edgement of the crisis, at all—the hu-
manitarian crisis has gotten nothing 
but worse. In March, the first month of 
her heading up the administration’s re-
sponse, there were 173,000 migrants 
that crossed our southern border. Then, 
in April, the number went up to 178,000 
and, in May, 180,000 migrants. We are 
now on track to see the highest num-
ber of total yearly border crossings in 
two decades, according to the Sec-
retary 
of 
Homeland 
Security, 
Mr. 
Mayorkas. 
At the center of this crisis are unac-
companied children, who are brought 
to this country by cartels and human 
smugglers. We know that the migrant 
children endure a long and dangerous 
journey to our border, often arriving 
malnourished, abused, and in critical 
health. Some of the young girls even 
arrive pregnant, and we know that 
many of them have been sexually as-
saulted en route by these human smug-
glers who care nothing for their wel-
fare. All they care about is the cold, 
hard dollar. I have talked to a number 
of these children and heard them retell 
their horrific stories about their jour-
ney from their home to our border. 
Since January, since the time that 
President Biden and Vice President 
HARRIS were inaugurated, more than 
65,000 unaccompanied children have en-
tered our country with no parent and 
no adult guardian, an absolutely dev-
astating figure. These children are 
then placed with sponsors in the inte-
rior of the United States—sometimes a 
family member, sometimes a complete 
stranger. Thirty days after these chil-
dren are placed with their American- 
based sponsor, not necessarily even an 
American citizen, a full 20 percent of 
them don’t respond to a phone call or a 
wellness check when a person associ-
ated with the U.S. Government knocks 
on the door. And we have no idea what 
happens to these children once they are 
lost to the system. 
The Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Val-
ley Sector is the epicenter of this 
human crisis. Between October and 
April, that is where nearly half of all 
unaccompanied children were encoun-
tered. In the 3 months since the Vice 
President has been in charge of this 
crisis, I have visited the Rio Grande 
Valley Sector twice. I have spoken 
with law enforcement, elected officials, 
and 
nongovernmental 
organizations 
that try to be of assistance to the mi-
grants while they are in the country, 
and a long list of other people who are 
trying to do everything in their power 
to manage this overwhelming number 
of humanity coming across our border. 
On Friday, Vice President HARRIS 
won’t get to speak with these men and 
women. Why is that? Well, she will be 
more than 1,000 miles away, down the 
border from the Border Patrol sector 
experiencing the worst of this crisis. 
I know there are probably folks who 
are not from Texas who think that the 
whole border is exactly the same, but 
that is not true. I had the chance to 
travel to Tucson with Senator SINEMA, 
the Senator from Arizona, and I got a 
chance to observe how different the 
border is in the Tucson Sector from the 
Rio Grande Valley, which she traveled 
with me to see after we left Tucson. 
But since October, the Rio Grande Val-
ley Sector has encountered nearly 
three times as many unaccompanied 
children as the El Paso Sector and 
more than seven times more family 
units. 
The situation along the entirety of 
the U.S. border is challenging, to be 
sure, and El Paso has suffered during 
the crisis too, no doubt. Law enforce-
ment, nongovernmental organizations, 
and community leaders in every border 
sector are struggling to manage the 
massive surge of migrants. 
When asked why she hadn’t visited 
the border yet, the Vice President said 
she wasn’t interested in grand ges-
tures. Yet here she is planning a trip in 
a way that reflects, again, that she 
doesn’t really fully comprehend the 
magnitude of the crisis and where it 
really exists on steroids, which is in 
the Rio Grande Valley. It is not even 
fair to say that she is a day late and a 
dollar short. She is nearly 100 days late 
and 1,000 miles short. 
By ignoring the Rio Grande Valley, 
the busiest Border Patrol sector along

the U.S.-Texas-Mexico border, the Vice 
President is shifting the focus away 
from the most serious problems of the 
crisis that she has failed to solve or 
even contribute any constructive ideas 
to. It won’t surprise you to know that 
during my time in the Senate, because 
my State does have a 1,200-mile com-
mon border with Mexico, I have spent a 
lot of time listening to and learning 
from folks who live and work along our 
border. Our border is a beautiful part of 
our State, rich in a unique culture and 
a rich sense of community that you 
can’t find in many parts of the coun-
try. 
Through no fault of their own, these 
border communities are being over-
whelmed by the sheer number of mi-
grants crossing the border, and the 
local leaders are beyond frustrated 
with the failures of the Federal Gov-
ernment to live up to its obligation to 
provide security along an international 
border. 
The President and Vice President 
have, I have to acknowledge, verbally 
encouraged migrants not to come to 
the United States. But those words 
mean nothing. They are hollow rhet-
oric indeed when somebody can simply 
pick up the phone and call a family 
member in the United States or watch 
the evening news and see how easy it is 
to make your way across the border, 
not to mention the fact that the 
human smugglers, the cartels who 
charge thousands of dollars per head, 
are whispering in their ear saying: We 
can get you across the border if you 
just pay us our fee. 
The reality of the situation is we are 
nearing a breaking point, and the Vice 
President and President could see that 
if they were only willing to join me and 
others who would be more than happy 
to host them by visiting the Rio 
Grande Valley. The administration has 
wasted valuable time that could have 
been spent addressing the crisis. 
This is a crisis in policy. This is not 
where building an additional physical 
barrier would stop many of these mi-
grants. Some of that would, and the 
Border Patrol said it has a part to 
play, but the truth is many of these 
migrants are turning themselves over 
to law enforcement authorities. They 
are not running away because they 
have figured out the gaps in our law 
better than we have. 
The administration has wasted valu-
able time that could have been spent 
addressing this crisis, and instead, it 
has just gotten worse. Now the ques-
tion is, What are they going to do 
about it? If they are looking for ideas, 
I am happy to offer a suggestion. 
There is already a grassroots plan 
out there that was built from the bot-
tom up by Senators and Congressmen 
most familiar with this crisis. Last 
month, Senator SINEMA, the Senator 
from Arizona, and I introduced the Bi-
partisan 
Border 
Solutions 
Act, 
a 
straightforward, commonsense way to 
address this crisis. We have been proud 
to work with two House Members. The 
Presiding Officer knows Congressman 
CUELLAR from Laredo, TX, along with 
TONY GONZALES, who represents one of 
the biggest congressional districts con-
tiguous to the U.S.-Mexico border, and 
they are our cosponsors in the House. 
So a bipartisan, bicameral bill to ad-
dress the very crisis that Vice Presi-
dent HARRIS and President Biden have 
been trying to avoid learning more 
about, at least until now—this legisla-
tion has the support, as I said, of Mem-
bers of both parties and in both Cham-
bers, as well as a diverse range of well- 
respected organizations. The U.S. His-
panic Chamber of Commerce, the Na-
tional Border Patrol Council, the Na-
tional Immigration Forum, and more 
than a dozen other organizations sup-
port this legislation. 
I would be more than happy to sit 
down with the President and the Vice 
President to discuss our bill, which in-
cludes the input of leaders who are 
dealing with the brunt of the crisis 
along the border. If the administration 
truly wants to address this crisis, they 
need to get serious about how to do so, 
and a photo op simply will not get the 
job done. 
The Vice President, I think, would be 
well served and would be serving the 
people of this country well if she would 
visit the Rio Grande Valley and listen 
to the law enforcement, elected offi-
cials, NGOs, and other men and women 
who are doing their best to try to deal 
with this crisis without much help 
from the administration. 
The administration has wasted too 
much time already. Now is not the 
time for another empty gesture. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
NOMINATION OF DEBORAH L. BOARDMAN 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
this afternoon in support of the nomi-
nation of U.S. Magistrate Judge Debo-
rah Boardman to be a U.S. district 
judge for the District of Maryland. 
Judge Boardman was favorably re-
ported by the Judiciary Committee on 
June 10. I have recommended Judge 
Boardman, along with Senator VAN 
HOLLEN, to President Biden, and I 
strongly 
support 
her 
nomination. 
Judge Boardman was nominated to fill 
the future vacancy created when Judge 
Richard Bennett, appointed by Presi-
dent Bush in 2003, announced his inten-
tions to take senior status upon the 
confirmation of his successor. Presi-
dent Biden nominated Judge Boardman 
for this position on March 30, and the 
Judiciary Committee held her con-
firmation hearing on May 12. 
Shortly after the November 2020 
Presidential election, I worked with 
Senator VAN HOLLEN to establish a ju-
dicial selection committee in Mary-
land. We used an open application proc-
ess with public advertisement and com-
municated closely with the State, 
local, and specialty bar associations in 
Maryland. In particular, we sought out 
a highly qualified and diverse applicant 
pool. 
Our committee interviewed everyone 
who submitted an application, which 
involved several dozen interviews. Sen-
ator VAN
HOLLEN
and I personally 
interviewed 
several 
finalists 
before 
making our recommendations to the 
White House. 
I 
strongly 
agree 
with 
President 
Biden’s request that Senators consider 
nominating individuals whose legal ex-
periences have been historically under-
represented on the Federal bench, in-
cluding those who are public defenders, 
civil rights and legal aid attorneys, and 
those who represent Americans in 
every walk of life. Judge Boardman fits 
that request. 
Judge Deborah Boardman was born 
in Silver Spring, raised in Frederick, 
and lives in Baltimore. She received a 
B.A. from Villanova University. After 
graduating from college, she accepted a 
Fulbright 
scholarship 
to 
study 
in 
Amman, Jordan. She received her J.D. 
from the University of Virginia School 
of Law. After law school, she clerked 
for a Federal judge in the Eastern Dis-
trict of Virginia, known as the ‘‘rocket 
docket’’ for the speed of its caseload. 
Judge Boardman brings tremendous 
experience to the courtroom as a sit-
ting U.S. magistrate judge in Maryland 
since 2019, which is the same Federal 
judicial district in which she would be-
come a district judge, if confirmed by 
the Senate. She already handles a 
heavy caseload in our Federal court. 
As 
a 
magistrate 
judge, 
Judge 
Boardman presides over civil cases by 
consent of the parties, resolves civil 
discovery disputes, conducts settle-
ment conferences, and presides over 
preliminary criminal proceedings. Ad-
ditionally, she administers the District 
of Maryland’s Social Security appeals 
docket. 
In civil cases before her by consent of 
the parties, Judge Boardman rules on 
motions to dismiss, resolves discovery 
disputes, decides whether a case should 
proceed to trial, and presides over 
bench and jury trials. These cases have 
involved claims of unemployment dis-
crimination in violation of title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Ameri-
cans With Disabilities Act, the Reha-
bilitation Act; claims under 42 United 
States Code 1983, the Fair Labor Stand-
ards Act, the Fair Debt Collection 
Practices Act; qualified and sovereign 
immunity defenses; and State law 
claims stemming from contract dis-
putes and personal injuries. 
As you can see, she has broad experi-
ence in regards to her tenure as a mag-
istrate 
judge. 
She 
has 
previously 
served as the First Assistant Federal 
Public Defender of Maryland. During 
her 11-year tenure with the Federal De-
fender’s Office, Judge Boardman rep-
resented individuals in both the Green-
belt and Baltimore courthouses that 
were charged with Federal crimes. 
She also has experience in private 
practice, as she served as a litigation 
associate at Hogan Lovells, formerly 
known as Hogan & Hartson, in Wash-
ington, DC, from 2001 to 2008. During

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

June 23, 2021 
those years, Judge Boardman worked 
exclusively on civil matters. She has 
experience both on the civil side and 
criminal side. She represented a wide 
range of corporate and individual cli-
ents in State and Federal courts. Spe-
cifically, she counseled insurance com-
panies, universities, and healthcare 
and pharmaceutical companies, among 
others, in business and contract dis-
putes. 
As a fifth-year associate, the firm se-
lected Judge Boardman to serve as the 
senior pro bono associate in its nation-
ally recognized pro bono department. 
She managed the firm’s largest pro 
bono cases full-time and appeared in 
Federal and State courts as the lead 
attorney in several of these pro bono 
cases. 
She tried a wrongful eviction action 
before a DC jury. She was lead counsel 
on a 3-day evidentiary hearing on ha-
beas corpus petitions in the circuit 
court for the city of Norfolk. She ar-
gued numerous discovery motions be-
fore the U.S. magistrate judge in the 
District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia in an unemployment discrimi-
nation class-action lawsuit. 
The 
American 
Bar 
Association’s 
Standing Committee on the Federal 
Judiciary gave Judge Boardman its 
highest, unanimous ‘‘well qualified’’ 
recommendation after evaluating her 
integrity, professional competence, and 
judicial temperament. 
As Judge Boardman said at her con-
firmation hearing, she is the daughter 
of the American Revolution on her fa-
ther’s side and a first-generation Amer-
ican of Palestinian descent on her 
mother’s side. Her father was born in 
New York and was drafted to serve in 
the U.S. Army in the Vietnam war and 
then went on to be a successful busi-
nessman. Her mother was born in 
Ramallah, a Palestinian city in the 
West Bank. She immigrated to the 
United States in the 1950s with her par-
ents and eight brothers and sisters 
when she was just 13 years of age. She 
spoke no English. When she began at-
tending public school in suburban 
Maryland, she then learned, of course, 
English and went on to a successful ca-
reer as a beautician. 
Judge Boardman has testified that 
her parents taught her the value of 
hard work, the importance of edu-
cation, the value of family, and the 
need to be generous to those who are 
less fortunate in life. 
In my discussions and meetings with 
Judge Boardman, I have some impres-
sions that stand out from her as a per-
son. She is fully committed to public 
service through her diverse profes-
sional career as a lawyer, law firm 
partner, public defender, and now a 
U.S. magistrate judge. She regards 
being a sitting judge as the ultimate 
and highest calling of public service in 
the legal profession. She wants to in-
spire the public’s confidence in the ju-
diciary and to hear parties’ concerns 
compassionately, while upholding her 
duty to fairly apply the law. Now as a 
U.S. 
magistrate 
judge, 
Judge 
Boardman has told me she understands 
the absolute importance of adjudi-
cating disputes neutrally and fairly. 
She clearly has the temperament for 
this position. She has told me that she 
is naturally curious and tries to avoid 
making assumptions. 
Judge Boardman shared with me that 
her internal compass directed her to-
ward service. Judges are first and fore-
most public servants, but they hold 
certain powers over individuals’ lives. 
She understands that. In her view, a 
district court judgeship is much more 
than achievement; it is a serious public 
responsibility which requires a judge to 
put the public first as they uphold the 
rule of law. 
Numerous individuals wrote to me on 
Judge Boardman’s behalf, including 
several sitting judges, law firm associ-
ates, and colleagues from her service in 
the 
public 
defender’s 
office. 
They 
unanimously praise Judge Boardman’s 
courtroom skills as a litigator, in par-
ticular praising her courtroom pres-
ence, sharp legal and analytical skills 
in both written and legal advocacy, and 
her high level of professionalism, excel-
lent temperament, and unfailing cour-
tesy to all parties. 
As a person, I have repeatedly been 
told by those who know her well that 
Judge Boardman is the best kind of 
person to be a judge. She is smart, pa-
tient, kind, and tough when she needs 
to be. She is a hard worker. She sees 
all sides of an argument and is always 
fair and professional in her treatment 
of others. 
I was delighted to recommend the 
nomination of Judge Boardman to 
President Biden, along with Senator 
VAN HOLLEN. Judicial nominees must 
meet the highest standard of integrity, 
competency, and temperament. Judge 
Boardman will safeguard the rights of 
all Marylanders and all Americans, up-
hold the Constitution and rule of law, 
and faithfully follow the judicial oath 
to do equal right to the poor and to the 
rich. 
I 
am 
confident 
that 
Judge 
Boardman will serve the people of 
Maryland very well once she is con-
firmed. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for the 
confirmation of Judge Boardman, who 
is an outstanding judicial nominee 
from Maryland. She is already a sitting 
U.S. magistrate judge on the U.S. Dis-
trict Court for the District of Mary-
land, where she has served with district 
judges. I look forward to her continued 
public service to Maryland and to the 
Nation. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as if in 
morning business for such time as I 
shall consume. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RETAIN ACT 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, last 
year, 
the 
Federal 
Communications 
Commission approved an application 
by Ligado Networks to repurpose the 
Federal spectrum in a way that will 
drastically interfere with GPS and sat-
ellite communications. This a big deal. 
There are so many people who under-
stand this situation. There is a list of 
companies behind us that grows every 
day. Almost every company in America 
that you know of or have heard of— 
their name is on this list. 
The decision that was made will 
threaten GPS and satellite commu-
nications reliability for millions of 
Americans who depend on it. The reli-
ability of GPS and satellite commu-
nications is necessary for safety of life 
operations, national security, and eco-
nomic activity. 
I am going to pause here for a minute 
to drive home what this actually 
means for every American because peo-
ple don’t know this. They don’t know 
how important GPS is. Yet there is not 
an American I can think of by descrip-
tion who isn’t using it every day. So if 
something happens to it, there is a se-
rious problem. Here are some of the 
day-to-day activities that would be dif-
ficult when experiencing GPS inter-
ference from Ligado. 
A big one—using your credit card or 
your debit card. When you are making 
a purchase or using an ATM, our finan-
cial systems rely on GPS timing in 
order to work. 
Another one—making a phone call. 
Cell phone networks rely on GPS to 
synchronize cell towers so calls can be 
passed seamlessly. If they experience 
interference, 
your 
call 
could 
be 
dropped when moving from one tower 
to another. 
Another one that people are not 
aware of and don’t expect is energy, 
whether that is filling up your tank 
with gas at the pump or electrical grids 
to light our homes. We rely on GPS 
timing to safely operate underground 
pipelines and our electricity grid. 
Farmers and ranchers—this is some-
thing that a lot of people are not aware 
of, but they depend on GPS and sat-
ellite communications when planting 
crops, applying fertilizer, and during 
harvesting operations to move large 
and critical machinery with precision. 
Working out—a lot of people don’t. I 
don’t as much as I used to, but a lot of 
people do. They say that one-fifth of 
the population, 20 percent of the popu-
lation, of all Americans, use a fitness 
tracker or a smartwatch. The majority 
have used GPS to count steps to track 
distance. We all know that. You see 
them out there every day. They depend 
on GPS. 
Taking a flight—I have been involved 
in aviation for over 70 years now and 
had occasion with three friends to fly 
around the world in 1991 using GPS. At 
that time—it may have been the first— 
the equipment I used was a Trimble 
TNL 2000. Trimble is one of the big 
GPS companies. I was using one, the 
TNL 2000. At that time, that may have 
been—we are checking to see—the first 
time that had been used for private

aviation, flying all the way around the 
world. Again, that is GPS, and that 
was 1991. 
Driving around right now, each day, 
countless Americans rely on Google 
Maps, Waze, Apple Maps, and any other 
navigation system to get them from 
point A to point B. While no one hopes 
to ever need a firetruck or an ambu-
lance or the 9–1-1 operators, the EMS, 
they use GPS on a daily basis. 
There is more—weather forecasting, 
the movement of goods on our high-
ways, 
surveying 
maritime 
harbors, 
channels, and everything else. The list 
goes on and on. 
How do we know that Ligado will 
cause interference? The FCC told us 
when they approved the Ligado order. I 
will read that now because people need 
to understand. I guess you could say we 
were warned. 
The FCC said in their document— 
that was the document they used on 
their approval order. They said: 
Ligado shall expeditiously repair or re-
place as needed any U.S. Government GPS 
devices that experience or are likely to expe-
rience harmful interference from Ligado’s 
operations. 
That is a quote. That is what they 
said. That is what the FCC said at that 
time. 
Over 21 organizations and companies 
and industries filed petitions for recon-
sideration after the order was released, 
documenting the damage they would 
face from the Ligado interference. This 
thing right behind me is now up to 82; 
it was 78 this morning. The list goes on 
and on. You can hardly think of a cor-
poration in America that isn’t on this 
list. So it is something that is a very 
serious problem and widespread. 
Here is one way to put the inter-
ference into perspective. Because GPS 
signals travel from satellite in space, 
by the time those signals get to 
Earth’s surface, they are low power. 
Because the FCC order allows Ligado 
to repurpose spectrum to operate a ter-
restrial-based network, Ligado’s sig-
nals on Earth’s surface will be much 
more powerful than GPS, causing sub-
stantial and harmful interference. 
While the FCC required Ligado to re-
pair damage to Federal Agencies that 
results from the interference, congres-
sional action is needed because the 
FCC’s Ligado order fell short in two 
important ways. 
First, the order did not provide an 
adequate description of costs to the 
Federal Agencies that would result 
from Ligado’s interference. 
We took bipartisan steps to correct 
this last year in the NDAA. 
The NDAA is the largest bill of the 
year. I happen to have been for several 
years the chairman of this thing. The 
NDAA is the national defense author-
ization bill. It does all the things that 
we do in the military. So that is the 
bill we are talking about. 
We included in that bill a provision 
directing the Department of Defense to 
produce an estimate of damages and 
costs associated with the harmful in-
terference to GPS. We also directed 
DOD—Department of Defense—and the 
National Academy of Sciences to con-
duct an independent technical review 
of the harmful interference that Ligado 
can cause. 
Secondly, the FCC failed to require 
that Ligado bear the costs of inter-
ference in State governments or pay 
for interference to devices owned by in-
dividual users. Now, we are talking 
about all Americans out there now— 
not just government, not State govern-
ment, not Federal government, but ev-
eryone else, these individual users. I 
talked already about how many ways 
we rely on GPS in everyday life. None 
of that would be protected from inter-
ference 
under 
the 
existing 
Ligado 
order. 
That is why I am introducing legisla-
tion—it is a long name, but I am going 
to say it anyway. It is called the Rec-
ognizing and Ensuring Taxpayer Access 
to Infrastructure Necessary for GPS 
and Satellite Communications Act, 
2021. Got that? All right. I call it the 
RETAIN Act. That is a little more ac-
curate and easy to understand. 
My legislation ensures that Federal 
Agencies, State governments, and all 
others negatively impacted by the ac-
tions of a private actor are not left 
holding the bag when it comes to costs, 
the amount of money it would cost to 
rectify, and, worse, aren’t put in a posi-
tion where they have to push the costs 
onto the American consumers. 
Why is this legislation necessary? 
Reliable GPS and satellite communica-
tions are important to everyone in the 
world and drive much of the Nation’s 
economy. That is why I am going to 
ask my colleagues to embrace, endorse, 
and cosponsor this legislation. Other-
wise, others may be forced to pay for 
damage that is done by the system. 
Anyway, I am going to ask our col-
leagues to join me in cosponsoring this 
legislation. If we don’t do this and 
something happens, then it will be paid 
for not by those responsible parties but 
by the taxpayers. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from New York. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. As if in legisla-
tive session, I ask unanimous consent 
that at a time to be determined by the 
majority leader in consultation with 
the Republican leader, the Senate 
Armed Services Committee be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 1520 and the Senate proceed to its 
consideration; that there be 2 hours of 
debate, equally divided in the usual 
form, and that upon the use or yielding 
back of that time, the Senate vote on 
the bill with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I rise for the 14th 
time to call for every Senator to have 
the opportunity to consider and cast 
their vote on the Military Justice Im-
provement and Increasing Prevention 
Act, which would ensure that service-
members who have been subject to sex-
ual assault and other serious crimes 
get the justice they deserve. 
For nearly a decade, the DOD has ar-
gued that removing convening author-
ity from command, as our bill does, 
would undermine military readiness 
and good order and discipline. But yes-
terday, our Secretary of Defense Sec-
retary Lloyd Austin endorsed the Inde-
pendent 
Review 
Commission’s 
rec-
ommendation that sexual assault and 
related crimes be moved from the 
chain of command to trained military 
prosecutors. 
It is historic. It is historic that we 
have, for the first time ever, a Sec-
retary of Defense agreeing that good 
order and discipline does not rest on a 
commander deciding whether a case 
goes forward or not. 
But we have to remember that the 
limited changes he endorsed come from 
a panel that was only asked to look at 
one type of crime. They were specifi-
cally asked to look at ways to solve 
the problem of military sexual assault 
and harassment. They drilled down on 
those issues of sexual assault, sexual 
harassment, domestic violence, and 
child abuse, and they agreed that all of 
those crimes must be taken out of the 
chain of command and put in the hands 
of specialized, highly trained military 
prosecutors. They see no conflict with 
making those changes and retaining 
command control. 
I remind my colleagues the mission 
we are tasked with is larger than the 
mission that the IRC was tasked with. 
Our job is to provide our servicemem-
bers with a military justice system 
that is worthy of the sacrifices they 
make for our country every day. That 
is why our bill addresses the funda-
mental flaw in the military justice sys-
tem that puts the fate of our service-
members in the hands of commanders 
who often know both the accuser and 
the accused and are not trained law-
yers. 
Our reform draws a bright line and 
moves all serious crimes, which can 
lead to serious consequences, to inde-
pendent military prosecutors. 
Secretary Austin’s endorsement of 
the IRC’s reforms makes it clear that 
he understands what we understand— 
convening authority is not necessary 
for maintaining command control or

for maintaining good order and dis-
cipline. Right now, 97 percent of com-
manders maintain good order and dis-
cipline without having convening au-
thority for general court-martial. Only 
3 percent, level 06 and above, have that 
unique authority. 
Our allies have drawn a similar 
bright line. They decided that in their 
military, serious crimes should be 
taken out of the chain of command and 
given to trained prosecutors. They 
have told us, through letters and testi-
mony, that they saw no diminution in 
command control or good order and 
discipline. 
Good order and discipline rests not 
on the commander’s ability to act as 
judge and jury but on their ability to 
do their job of instilling a culture of re-
spect between servicemembers and in-
stilling a command climate where 
these types of actions aren’t tolerated. 
There is no reason to continue to 
subject servicemembers to a system 
where 
commanders, 
rather 
than 
trained military prosecutors, are decid-
ing which cases go to trial. We must 
move decisions about whether to move 
forward on cases dealing with serious 
crimes to the most qualified, most 
highly trained person. That would be 
trained military prosecutors. That is 
all that our bill does. That is what the 
Military Justice Improvement and In-
creasing Prevention Act does. 
In addition to having a filibuster- 
proof support in the Senate, this is now 
a bipartisan, bicameral piece of legisla-
tion. This morning, I stood with Con-
gresswoman SPEIER, Speaker PELOSI, 
Congressman TURNER, and a bipartisan 
group of Members in the House as they 
introduced this version of the legisla-
tion. The bipartisan support we have in 
the House includes Republicans with 
years 
of 
military 
service—former 
JAGs, former commanders. We had a 
general from the Republican Party 
stand up and support that bill this 
morning. 
Not only do they understand the im-
portance of having a military justice 
system that is impartial and highly 
trained but also the importance of 
command and what their role is. We 
have a great deal of bipartisan support. 
This type of bipartisan, bicameral 
support is rare. It speaks to the impor-
tance of this reform, the importance of 
us meeting our obligation to provide 
oversight of our military, and the im-
portance of serving those who serve our 
country in uniform. 
This morning, we were also joined by 
the sisters of Vanessa Guillen. Her 
youngest sister Lupe talked about 
what happened to Vanessa. She said: 
‘‘The system that we have now failed 
my sister, [and] it’s up to us to change 
[it].’’ 
To change the system that failed 
Vanessa, moving just sex crimes out of 
the chain of command would not be 
enough. She was murdered. We must 
move all serious crimes, including 
murder, 
to 
independent, 
impartial 
military prosecutors. 
This morning, Lupe said: ‘‘Someone 
will always have to suffer for someone 
to care—but that stops now and it 
stops with us.’’ 
It is time for us to do the job right, 
to prove Lupe right. Our servicemem-
bers, as Secretary Austin said, deserve 
nothing less. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, ear-
lier this week—in fact, yesterday—the 
Senate Democrats attempted an un-
precedented power grab in the Senate 
that, in my view, clearly would have 
affected the sanctity of our elections 
and violated our Constitution. 
S. 1 was one of the most monstrous 
bills I have seen during my time in 
Congress, and it certainly didn’t meet 
my standard of doing things that are 
constitutional. 
In doing so yesterday, the Senate 
Democrats underscored for me some-
thing I thought I knew well, and they 
reaffirmed it, and that is the impor-
tance of maintaining the legislative fil-
ibuster, the 60-vote threshold for legis-
lation. 
I am sorry we went down the path of 
changing the rules for judges, then for 
the Supreme Court, and now, poten-
tially, for legislation. Sixty votes is a 
good thing. Sixty votes allow—people 
say they want us to work together—60 
votes require us to do that. In the ab-
sence of 60-vote rule, everything be-
comes political. In the absence of 60- 
vote rule, there is no certainty. 
A party in power, one that has the 
majority of the Senate, the President— 
the election changes, and there is a 
new majority, and then we change 
what we just passed 2 years before. 
There is nothing good for job creation 
and economic security. There is noth-
ing good for families and trying to fig-
ure out what is next in their life when 
the law can change every time a new, a 
different party has the majority in the 
U.S. Senate and House or there is a 
new President. 
My view is that what happened yes-
terday was not by design. As a matter 
of fact, the vote, among others, was de-
signed to fail in order to pressure 
Democratic Senators into altering the 
rules of the Senate and render this 
place a majority-run institution. 
Democrats achieved control—the vot-
ers gave them control of both Cham-
bers of the Congress and the White 
House—and are convinced that they 
have a mandate to erode the governing 
norms of the Senate. By my count, the 
Senate stands at an evenly divided, 50– 
50, and the majority, by a slight num-
ber, Democrats have in the House of 
Representatives. Surely, this is hardly 
a mandate for a radically progressive 
agenda, much less changing the thresh-
old for which minority rights are pro-
tected and bipartisan cooperation is 
promoted. 
Should the legislative filibuster meet 
its demise at the hands of this Senate 
because Democrats decide on a major-
ity vote, that the rules that have been 
in place for decades should be changed 
overnight on a whim, the august U.S. 
Senate will be condemned to a partisan 
spectacle. 
The idea that everything should be 
decided by one vote means that every-
thing here becomes political and that 
the American people become even more 
partisan. If every vote in the U.S. Sen-
ate—every outcome—is determined by 
one person, then politics become the 
passion of the American people by ne-
cessity. The 60-vote rule is designed to 
moderate both sides of a question, to 
bring us together, to pull us to the 
middle in something that is more ac-
ceptable to the American people than 
anything we might decide if we could 
decide it on our own, Republican or 
Democrat. It means that every citizen 
would feel the need to lobby us. 
The normal course of life becomes 
much more about politics. While poli-
tics is important to the country and 
while it is important for the American 
people to be engaged, they send us here 
to make decisions. That 60-vote rule al-
lows us to make decisions that are 
more acceptable to them so they can 
spend their lives living their lives, not 
worrying about what, on any given 
day, the U.S. Senate might pass. 
I don’t think the motivation by the 
Senate Democrats is what it may seem 
to some. The suggestion is that we 
can’t seem to pass any legislation here. 
I read this week in the Wall Street 
Journal an editorial, an op-ed piece, by 
Mike Solon and Bill Greene, and this 
was a comment that stood out to me: 
The movement to end the filibuster is less 
about a Senate that doesn’t work than it is 
about a socialist agenda that doesn’t sell. 
The idea that everything is decided 
on the margin of one means that we be-
come politics, that politics rules in 
this country. The freedoms and lib-
erties that the American people enjoy 
every day because they can rely on not 
radical change but modest change—on 
improvements day by day, not im-
provements overnight—means that we 
have a different country. We certainly 
would have a different Senate, but a 
consequence of having a different Sen-
ate means America is not what it is 
today. 
Again, I say this in a way that would, 
I hope, remind my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle: I stand ready to work 
on many issues on which we can bring 
ourselves together. I hope this week— 
tomorrow, today—that we learn there 
is an infrastructure agreement, a bi-
partisan agreement. This isn’t a belief 
that I have the ability to dominate the 
agenda of the U.S. Senate or that one 
party should. It is a reminder that 
America is better when we work to-
gether and that eliminating the 60-vote

FILIBUSTER 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, my 
State proudly calls itself the Land of 
Steady Habits. Some people in Con-
necticut think it is kind of a funny 
thing to be proud of—being resistant to 
change—but honestly, in the North-
east, in the crucible of America, we 
know there is real value to consistency 
and tradition. 
A nation as unique as ours—multi-
cultural, democratic, ever expanding in 
scope and ambition—we probably can’t 
hold together unless there is some 
agreement between all of our different 
peoples about the expectations that we 
have for each other in the conduct of 
our national business. Without tradi-
tion, our Nation’s defining dynamism, 
it might break us. 
Yes, it is wildly old-fashioned to hold 
town meetings, where every citizen has 
to show up on one particular day, to 
make decisions about how you spend 
money or what rates you pay in taxes, 
but that way of governing, created in 
New England some four centuries ago, 
is still the method of decisionmaking 
in many of our towns. It may not be 
the most efficient means of govern-
ment, but tradition matters. It helps to 
hold us together as a country. 
I know and appreciate the value of 
consistency. I don’t deny it. So earlier 
this week, I read with interest an opin-
ion piece, penned by one of my friends 
in the Senate Democratic caucus, mak-
ing the argument that amongst the 
most important reasons to preserve the 
60-vote threshold in the Senate is to 
advance the value of consistency and 
tradition in American politics. 
I was glad to read it. I am proud of 
my colleague because for too long, the 
punditry and the activists have had 
near exclusive domain over the debate 
about the wisdom of changing the rules 
of this body. So it has been strange, 
given how much this place means to 
the 100 of us who serve here, that we 
have mostly left the dialogue over its 
future to those who don’t work inside 
this Chamber every day. 
Yes, right now, there is a disagree-
ment amongst Senate Democrats and 
between the majority of Senate Demo-
crats and the majority of Senate Re-
publicans about how the Senate should 
operate, but there is no merit in hiding 
this dispute. There is no valor in let-
ting others define the terms that lay 
out the conflicting arguments, which I 
readily submit are compelling on both 
sides. So let’s have the debate. Let’s 
have it right here. No more shadow-
boxing. The stakes, I would argue, are 
too important. 
Let me start here. The argument to 
keep the 60-vote threshold, to guar-
antee policy consistency or to uphold 
Senate tradition, is downright dan-
gerous because this argument essen-
tially prioritizes consistency over de-
mocracy. 
At the very moment when Americans 
have less faith than ever before that 
this place has the capacity to imple-
ment the will of the people, the 60-vote 
threshold is a slap in the face of 
majoritarianism, which is the bedrock 
principal of American democracy, the 
idea that the majority of people get to

decide the direction of this country— 
not elites, not oligarchs, like in other 
nations; people, regular people. 
To say that Americans can have an 
election, choose leaders of a particular 
view, and then watch while the rules of 
democracy deliberately stop the vot-
ers’ will from being enacted is to 
thumb our noses at the American elec-
torate—at the very moment when they 
are actively considering whether Amer-
ican democracy has anything left to 
offer them. 
My colleague argues quite powerfully 
that the requirement to achieve 60 
votes to pass legislation in the Senate 
guards against rapid policy change, 
giving several examples, including edu-
cation and environment policy and vot-
ing rules as areas where danger might 
lie if one majority imposed the policy 
in one Congress that would be undone 
by the next. I want to walk us through 
this argument. 
My first approach might be to post-
pone the harder question of whether or 
not to value consistency over democ-
racy and to simply accept for a mo-
ment the prioritization of consistency 
and tradition. I do so knowing that our 
Founding Fathers also prioritized con-
sistency. 
In Federalist 9 and 10, Hamilton and 
Madison discuss what they call the 
problem of factions. Madison says that 
a faction is ‘‘a number of citizens, 
whether amounting to a minority or 
majority of the whole, who are united 
and actuated by some common impulse 
of passion, adverse to the rights of 
other citizens.’’ Now, notice here that 
Madison doesn’t really care whether 
the faction represents a minority or 
majority of citizens; he simply defines 
it by its cause’s malevolence. This was 
and still is tricky business—rich White 
men defining for everybody else what 
cause is righteous and which cause is 
wicked. But our Founding Fathers 
built a system of government to make 
rapid policy change—even change sup-
ported by the majority of voters—very, 
very hard to implement. 
Now, how do they do this? I want to 
lay this out because if you do care 
about preventing rapid policy shifts, it 
is important to understand why the 60- 
vote threshold isn’t necessary, is over-
kill given all the other barriers our 
system has to prevent rapid policy 
shifts. 
First, our Founding Fathers estab-
lished a bicameral legislature as op-
posed to a unicameral parliamentary 
system. That meant that no change 
could be implemented until two dif-
ferent legislative bodies agreed to the 
exact same text. 
Second, they layered on top of that 
bicameral legislative structure a uni-
tary President with the power to veto 
that legislation. 
Third, they put in place an unelected 
body, the Supreme Court, that could 
invalidate any statutory changes that 
conflicted with the Constitution. 
Fourth, they put the House and the 
Senate and the Presidency all on over-
lapping, conflicting election schedules, 
guaranteeing that it would be 100 per-
cent possible for the voters to sweep 
out all elected officials and replace 
them with a new slate all at one mo-
ment. 
Fifth, the Founders built a few super-
majority requirements but only for se-
lective occasions: treaties, impeach-
ments, constitutional amendments— 
the stuff that could last forever. The 
Founding Fathers did want extra con-
sensus around that. 
All of that design has lasted. It is 
still with us today. 
There are other parts of the original 
design intended to protect the value of 
consistency to protect against the dan-
ger of faction that have not lasted. The 
Founders also believed that only White 
men should vote and that citizens 
shouldn’t be trusted to directly select 
the Members of this body. That is all 
history because for all of the anti-fac-
tion design that we have kept, we 
changed just as much, and all of that 
change has moved in only one direc-
tion—toward more majoritarian de-
mocracy. 
Why? Well, because as our grand ex-
periment—the American experiment— 
matured, we saw proof of concept. The 
people could be trusted to govern 
themselves. They could choose leaders 
who were more able, more honest, more 
effective than any King or Queen, any 
Sultan or Emperor. So we extended the 
franchise 
universally. 
We 
directly 
elected the Senate. 
As America expanded, the new States 
out West gobbled up even more democ-
racy. The West decided to not just 
elect legislators but judges, prosecu-
tors, dog catchers and commissioners. 
Majoritarian rule became addictive, 
and our country grew and it demanded 
more and more of it. 
That brings us to the 60-vote thresh-
old. The 60-vote threshold in a country 
built on the strength of direct democ-
racy stands out like a sore, rotting 
thumb—this 
anti-majoritarian 
drain 
clog designed intentionally to stop the 
majority of Americans from getting 
what they want from government. 
Proponents of existing Senate rules 
say that in the name of bipartisanship 
or tradition or consistency of policy, 
we should purposefully frustrate the 
changing will of the electorate. But 
why? Why not trust voters? For in-
stance, voters elected a President and a 
Congress in 2008 that promised to enact 
a system of universal healthcare. It 
just so happened that at that moment, 
for the first time in 40 years, there 
were 60 votes for the party of that view 
in 
the 
Senate, 
so 
a 
universal 
healthcare law was passed. 
But why should it not be up to the 
voters and not politicians to review the 
efficacy of a major policy change like 
that and, if they so choose, elect lead-
ers to rescind or revise it? I don’t want 
the ACA repealed, but I am deeply un-
comfortable that a 60-vote threshold 
robs from voters that decision. 
This preference for policy consist-
ency, intentionally blind to the merits 
of policy over direct democracy, is par-
ticularly insidious at this moment in 
American history, first because the 60- 
vote threshold is being used in a very, 
very different way today than it has 
anytime prior in our Nation’s history. 
Up until the 1970s, cloture votes were 
almost nonexistent in the Senate. Leg-
islative filibusters were used in those 
days mostly by racist southern White 
Senators to stop civil rights bills. Be-
ginning in the seventies, that tactic be-
came more widely employed but was 
still used sparingly. 
Consider this. In 1994, our colleague 
Senator FEINSTEIN forced a vote on one 
of the most controversial of all pro-
posals that come before this body—a 
ban on assault weapons. It received 
fewer votes than the Manchin-Toomey 
background check bill did 30 years 
later. Senator FEINSTEIN’s proposal got 
52 votes; Manchin-Toomey got 54 votes. 
But the assault weapons ban became 
law while the background checks bill 
did not. Why? Because in 1994, many 
important votes, even the assault 
weapons ban, were allowed to proceed 
on a majority-vote basis. Not so by 
2013. 
I could make the argument that it 
was Republicans who started this rapid 
escalation of the use of the 60-vote 
threshold, but who really cares? It 
doesn’t matter because today both par-
ties use it almost without exception in 
a way that looks radically different 
from the way the tactic was utilized 
half a century ago. 
I would argue that if you want to do 
an overview of the history of the 60- 
vote threshold, it doesn’t tell a story of 
the value the Senate places on consist-
ency. No, it is the opposite. Watching 
the way the tactic has been used so dif-
ferently over time, it demonstrates the 
value the Senate places on change in 
practice and tradition. Reforming this 
rule would, frankly, just pay heed to 
this reality. 
The second danger of valuing consist-
ency over democracy at this moment 
lies in the signal that it sends to an 
American public that is in, frankly, no 
mood for the choices of the elites to be 
continually substituted for their own 
collective judgment. 
Right now, Americans are in kind of 
a revolutionary mood, and for good 
reason. More Americans today than at 
any time in recent history see them-
selves on the precipice of financial and 
sometimes spiritual ruin. They are 
done with economic and political elites 
jealously protecting the status quo. 
And the election of Donald Trump, al-
though revealed by time to be a false 
prophet, was an unmistakable foot 
stomp by an electorate tired of being 
taken for granted. 
So why on Earth would our message, 
amidst this growing populist tempest, 
be to tell voters that rules in the Sen-
ate are required to protect them from 
their own bad judgment, to take from 
them, purposely, the ability to change 
policies whenever and however they 
wish?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4725 
June 23, 2021 
I submit to you that today, right 
now, this replacement of popular will 
by anti-majoritarian rule-rigging could 
destroy us. Today more than ever, vot-
ers want to know that their vote 
counts every election. And continuing 
to give minorities here in the Senate 
power to stop change is dangerously 
disconsonant with the current political 
mood of this country. Take power away 
from the American people at your 
peril. 
Finally, on this question of the value 
we should place on consistency, I want 
to raise the problem of the city fire-
house. Firehouses are places that value 
consistency and tradition. Firefighters 
spend a lot of time in close quarters to-
gether. When that alarm rings, they 
are required to work together in pre-
cise and disciplined unison to get out 
the door in seconds in order to save 
lives and property. Practices change in 
a firehouse but carefully and through 
consensus decision making. Keeping 
everybody together matters when the 
stakes are so high. 
But what would happen if inside that 
firehouse, a sizable group of fire-
fighters decided one day that the mis-
sion of the department should no 
longer be to put out fires but maybe, 
instead, just to let them burn a little? 
Wouldn’t then the value of consensus 
decision making become a little less 
important? If you were a homeowner, 
wouldn’t you want to make sure that 
the firefighters who still wanted to 
fight fires were setting the rules and 
not the guys who are OK with the 
houses in the neighborhood burning 
down? 
I know this is a crude analogy, but to 
value consistency or tradition above 
everything else, I think you have to be 
pretty certain that everybody in your 
club, everybody on your team is guided 
by the same foundational goal. 
In the case of the U.S. Senate, our 
goal, our endgame has always been 
simple: the preservation of American 
democracy, the belief that every Amer-
ican should have a say in who governs, 
and the persons whom they choose and 
no one else should be seated in power. 
We have had fights—often vicious in 
nature—over the course of our Nation’s 
history over how fast we should expand 
the vote, how quickly we should reform 
our Constitution to allow for more di-
rect democracy. But never before has 
one party actively advocated for the 
lessening of democracy. Never before 
has one party openly advocated for 
candidates who receive the smaller 
share of the vote to be made President 
of the United States. 
In the last year, a democratic Rubi-
con has been crossed by one party, and 
we can’t ignore this devastating blow 
to our Nation. You cannot value con-
sistency in practice when a large fac-
tion of your group’s members don’t be-
lieve in the underlying mission of your 
organization any longer. The firehouse 
can’t just keep doing the same things 
it always does year after year for the 
sake of consistency or tradition or con-
sensus when two or three of the mem-
bers who hop on the firetruck when 
that alarm sounds aren’t intending to 
actually put out the fire when they ar-
rive at the building. 
Giving Republicans a veto power over 
legislation when they no longer believe 
in the same way the Democrats do or 
Republicans used to in the sacredness 
of the vote is to risk the voluntary de-
struction of our democracy. 
Consistency as a value has merit. It 
does. But in this business, consistency 
is often put on an unhealthy pedestal. 
What is the value of being consistent 
when all of the circumstances around 
you 
are 
changing? 
Where 
is 
the 
strength in sticking to your position 
when everything around you is in met-
amorphosis? When democracy itself is 
being attacked in a brutal, coordi-
nated, unprecedented volley of blows, 
what is the good of holding to a posi-
tion just for the sake of being con-
sistent if the primary consequence is to 
simply green light the assault to con-
tinue? 
Consistency and tradition and bipar-
tisanship—they matter but not at the 
expense of democracy, not in a moment 
when millions of voters are questioning 
the wisdom of American democracy be-
cause no matter whom they elect, 
nothing seems to change, and not when 
one party has increasingly abandoned 
the joint project to which all Members 
of this body swore an oath as a condi-
tion of our membership. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I know Senator MAR-
SHALL is ready to speak, and I apolo-
gize for delaying him with my rather 
long remarks. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to legislative session and be in 
a period of morning business, with Sen-
ators permitted to speak for up to 10 
minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
SESQUICENTENNIAL OF CALVERT 
CITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, for 
150 years, Calvert City has been a cen-
tral hub of the Jackson Purchase, serv-
ing as a focal point for pioneers, farm-
ers, and railroaders from all over west-
ern Kentucky. The town’s enduring 
legacy is a tribute to the enterprising 
demeanor of those trailblazing Ken-
tuckians who first called the Purchase 
home. In recognition of Calvert City’s 
sesquicentennial, I am privileged to 
join this vibrant Kentucky community 
in celebrating 150 years of Bluegrass 
heritage. 
Calvert City started off as nothing 
more than a depot alongside the Padu-
cah & Elizabethtown Railroad, but 
quickly blossomed as settlers spread 
west into the Jackson Purchase to 
profit from the region’s fertile soil and 
easy access to the Tennessee, Cum-
berland, Ohio, and Mississippi Rivers. 
By the time the Kentucky Dam was 
completed nearby in 1944, bringing jobs 
and hydroelectric power to the region, 
the town was a flourishing center of 
commerce. Today, Calvert City is home 
to numerous advanced chemical manu-
facturing facilities and continues to 
play a critical role in western Ken-
tucky’s economy. 
In recognition of Calvert City’s pio-
neer spirit, the town is celebrating 150 
years 
of 
history 
with 
150 
events 
throughout the calendar year. These 
ceremonies are made especially poign-
ant by the passing of Mayor Lynn Boyd 
Jones this January. He had dreamed 
about Calvert City’s 150th anniversary 
since the town’s centennial 50 years 
ago and was an early planner of this 
year’s festivities. 
As 
Kentucky 
emerges 
from 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic, the celebration 
will be a uniquely joyous tribute. All 
aspects of Calvert City’s storied his-
tory will be on display, from railroad 
cars, to an auto show, to events at Oak 
Hill, the original home of town founder 
Potilla Calvert. 
I want to give special thanks to the 
Calvert City civic leaders who made 
this year’s sesquicentennial celebra-
tion possible. It is through their hard 
work and dedication that the town con-
tinues to prosper, so many years after 
its founding. On behalf of the Senate, I 
share our congratulations with every 
Calvert City family and join them in 
honoring 150 years of proud Kentucky 
traditions. 
f 
LGBTQ PRIDE MONTH 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise in 
recognition of LGBTQ Pride Month of 
2021. For more than 50 years, Pride 
Month has offered us a chance to cele-
brate 
lesbian, 
gay, 
bisexual, 
transgender, 
and 
queer—LGBTQ— 
Americans and to reflect upon the 
progress that our Nation has made in 
how we treat this community in law, 
policy, custom, and everyday life. It 
also is an opportunity to redouble our 
efforts to end enduring discrimination 
based on sexual orientation or gender 
identity. 
President Biden promptly issued a 
Presidential proclamation recognizing 
June of 2021 as Pride Month. With the 
authorization of Secretary of State 
Antony Blinken, U.S. diplomatic mis-
sions around the world are displaying 
the pride flag as a clear visual rep-
resentation of American values. On the 
very first day of his administration, 
President Biden issued an executive 
order on preventing and combating dis-
crimination based on gender identity 
or sexual orientation. This decision has 
already driven new policies at the 
agency level making an important dif-
ference in real people’s lives, from pro-
tecting transgender individuals seek-
ing 
safe 
shelter 
to

Trump-era 
ban 
that 
prohibited 
transgender people from serving in the 
military. It is clear that LGBTQ Amer-
icans can count on the Biden-Harris ad-
ministration to do everything possible 
to 
champion 
fundamental 
human 
rights on their behalf. 
The bad news is that while we see 
progress at a Federal level, the Human 
Rights Campaign assesses that 2021 is 
the worst year in terms of State-level 
anti-LGBTQ legislation in recent his-
tory. Governors have signed 17 anti- 
LGBTQ bills into law, already exceed-
ing the 15 anti-LGBTQ laws passed in 
2015, which held the previous record in 
recent history. There are even more 
bills waiting Governors’ signatures or 
veto override votes. Most of these bills 
shamefully target transgender chil-
dren. 
These 
bills 
and 
laws 
are 
untethered from trends in real public 
opinion. Recent polling from Gallup 
finds that support for same-sex mar-
riage is at a new high of 70 percent of 
all Americans. A PBS/NPR/Marist poll 
published in April revealed that two- 
thirds of all Americans oppose legisla-
tion to ban transgender student ath-
letes from joining sports teams that 
match their gender identity, a number 
that barely changes across partisan 
lines. 
The American people clearly agree 
with the principle expressed in Presi-
dent Biden’s executive order: ‘‘All per-
sons should receive equal treatment 
under the law, no matter their gender 
identity or sexual orientation.’’ It is as 
simple as that. 
When it comes to human rights, civil 
rights, and being treated with dignity 
and respect, everybody in this country, 
regardless of where they live, should 
receive equal treatment. The House of 
Representatives passed the Equality 
Act in February to prohibit discrimina-
tion based on sexual orientation and 
gender identity in education, employ-
ment, housing, credit, Federal jury 
service, public accommodations, and 
with regard to receiving Federal finan-
cial assistance. These protections build 
upon and align with the Supreme 
Court’s landmark decision 1 year ago 
in Bostock vs. Clayton County, which 
affirmed that the sex discrimination 
prohibition in the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 also applies to discrimination 
based on sexual orientation or gender 
identity. That ruling states, ‘‘it is im-
possible to discriminate against a per-
son 
for 
being 
homosexual 
or 
transgender 
without 
discriminating 
against that individual based on sex.’’ 
We still urgently need to pass the 
Equality Act, however, to apply this 
interpretation to all areas of civil 
rights law and to apply protections 
against discrimination based on sex, 
sexual orientation, and gender identity 
to a broader scope of entities. I am 
proud to be an original cosponsor of 
the legislation and will work to ad-
vance it this Congress. 
As Harvey Milk said, ‘‘It takes no 
compromise to give people their rights. 
It takes no money to respect the indi-
vidual. It takes no political deal to 
give 
people 
freedom.’’ 
This 
Pride 
Month, I urge my colleagues in the 
Senate to join me in supporting the 
Equality Act to ensure that we protect 
the human and civil rights all Ameri-
cans. Our government should do all it 
can to promote equality, compassion, 
and empathy—not discrimination, big-
otry, and hate. 
f 
CONFIRMATION OF KIRAN 
ARJANDAS AHUJA 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to support the nomination of Kiran 
Ahuja to serve as the Director of the 
Office of Personnel Management. Mrs. 
Ahuja is highly qualified and has a 
deep commitment to public service 
that will serve her well as the Director 
of OMB. I am confident that she has 
the skills to rebuild the civil service 
and restore protections for civil serv-
ants that were rolled back by the 
Trump administration. 
Mrs. Ahuja spent her childhood trav-
elling across the South with her par-
ents as they worked to provide des-
perately needed mental health services 
to 
underserved 
communities. 
After 
graduating from Spelman College and 
the University of Georgia School of 
Law, Mrs. Ahuja began her career in 
public service as a civil rights attorney 
at the Department of Justice. She went 
on to lead the White House Initiative 
for Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers and then serve as the Chief of 
Staff for OPM as it responded to a data 
breach that exposed the personal infor-
mation of millions of Federal employ-
ees and contractors. 
Kiran Ahuja will be tasked with lead-
ing OPM as it faces a new set of chal-
lenges. After 4 years of attacks by the 
Trump administration on the protec-
tions at the core of our merit-based 
civil service system, OPM needs a lead-
er who understands that Federal work-
ers serve our country, not the indi-
vidual or political party currently oc-
cupying the White House. 
OPM is an independent Federal agen-
cy tasked with a vital mission: ensur-
ing that the Federal workforce delivers 
top-notch service to the American peo-
ple. The next OPM Director must rec-
ognize, as President Biden and Mrs. 
Ahuja do, that union organizing and 
collective bargaining are in the public 
interest and that these rights are vital 
safeguards to protect the merit system 
principles of the civil service. The next 
OPM Director must also work to at-
tract new talent to Federal agencies 
that have lost valuable expertise and 
modernize OPM’s outdated information 
technology systems. I am confident 
that Mrs. Ahuja has the skills and 
knowledge to meet these challenges 
and to carry out the agency’s mission.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO MAL LEARY 
∑ Mr. KING. Mr. President, I rise today 
to honor a Maine legend who will soon 
be leaving his post after nearly a half 
century of diligent, inquisitive jour-
nalism that has kept our State’s citi-
zens better informed. At the beginning 
of July, Mal Leary will sign off for the 
final time from Maine Public Broad-
casting, concluding a 45-year career 
during which he became one of the 
most trusted voices in Maine media. 
When listeners heard Mal’s distinc-
tive Maine rasp come across the air-
waves, they knew they were getting 
the straight news from a model jour-
nalist. His integrity and intelligence 
came through in every story, diving 
into the policy details in a measured, 
well-reasoned way that did not betray 
a bias toward any ideology, political 
party, or elected officials. Most impor-
tantly, every time you finished listen-
ing to a Mal story, you knew more 
about your community and your State 
than you did just a few moments be-
fore. 
Mal wasn’t only held in high esteem 
by listeners. I can tell you from per-
sonal experience that when Mal is in a 
room, elected officials notice his pres-
ence. He loomed large among the 
Maine press corps, and his ability to 
unravel and explain a complicated pol-
icy question was only matched by his 
political instincts. While others, in-
cluding legislators, were focused on the 
questions of the day, Mal would look 
two or three steps down the road to an-
ticipate the pitfalls facing any given 
proposal. I learned quickly that I al-
ways needed to have my facts straight 
before I talked to Mal Leary. 
His innate understanding of both pol-
icy 
and 
policymakers 
made 
Mal’s 
interviews one-of-a-kind. I would often 
start a conversation with him, expect-
ing to discuss the issues of the day, 
only to be questioned on an issue that 
wouldn’t come up for another few 
months or review a legislative hearing 
from 3 weeks prior. Refusing to be a 
prisoner of the moment, he always 
looked at the big picture, and, criti-
cally, he made sure that the elected of-
ficials he covered did the same. 
Maine will be poorer without Mal 
Leary roaming the State capitol, but 
he is leaving the Maine press corps in 
good hands that he had a part in train-
ing. A fountain of institutional knowl-
edge, Mal was always generous with his 
time and his experience, filling in 
young reporters on the historical con-
text behind long-gestating problems or 
making sure folks were up to speed on 
legislative procedures. This next gen-
eration of reporters have each grown 
by absorbing Mal’s wisdom, working to 
compete with him, or a combination of 
the two, so although he may be leaving 
for greener pastures, his lessons and in-
fluence will remain. 
I find a bit of irony in these remarks 
because even as I attempt to honor 
Mal, I sense that he will have some dis-
comfort taking the compliment. The 
definition of a model reporter, Mal 
wasn’t focused on befriending his sub-
jects or accumulating personal acco-
lades; he was always dead set on get-
ting to the truth and bringing that

truth back to the people of Maine. 
That is why he is so beloved by all— 
OK, by most—even when he was asking 
hard questions; at the end of the day, 
Mal always told the story straight. He 
was always fair. 
I have long believed that journalists 
are people we, the public, hire to tell us 
about priorities that we don’t have 
time to attend to ourselves; instead, we 
rely on friends to give us the scoop. 
That is exactly who Mal was for thou-
sands across Maine—a friend, who 
filled them in on the latest goings-on 
in Augusta, Washington, and every-
where in between. As our friend rides 
off into the beautiful sunsets of Maine, 
I want to express to him my best wish-
es and Maine’s enormous gratitude for 
his work to make our State better.∑

TRIBUTE TO ISAIAH LEE

over the past several weeks. 
Isaiah is a graduate of Roosevelt 
High School in Sioux Falls, SD. Cur-
rently, he is attending Northwestern 
College in Orange City, IA, where he is 
majoring in political science. He is a 
hard worker who has been dedicated to

on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 283 
Whereas June 20 is observed as ‘‘World Ref-
ugee Day’’, a global event to acknowledge 
the courage, resilience, and determination of 
individuals and families who are forced to 
flee their homes due to persecution; 
Whereas December 14, 2020, signified 70 
years since the founding of the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
gees; 
Whereas July 28, 2021, is the 70th anniver-
sary of the Convention Relating to the Sta-
tus of Refugees, signed in Geneva on July 28, 
1951, which defines the term ‘‘refugee’’ and 
outlines the rights of refugees and the legal 
obligations of states to protect them; 
Whereas, in 2020, according to the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees— 
(1) there were more than 82,400,000 forcibly 
displaced people worldwide, the worst dis-
placement crisis in recorded history, includ-
ing 26,400,000 refugees, more than 48,000,000 
internally displaced people, and 4,100,000 peo-
ple seeking asylum; 
(2) on average, 1 out of every 95 people 
worldwide was a refugee, an internally dis-
placed person, or a person seeking asylum; 
(3) 11,200,000 people were newly displaced 
due to recent conflict or persecution; 
(4) 68 percent of the world’s refugees came 
from Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, South 
Sudan, and Burma; 
(5) 2,600,000 Afghan refugees were displaced 
worldwide, making them one of the world’s 
largest and longest-running displaced popu-
lations; 
(6) more than 50 percent of the population 
of Syria, at least 13,500,000 people, were dis-
placed, either across the international bor-
der or within Syria, which represents the 
largest displacement crisis in the world 
today;

(7) children accounted for 30 percent of the 
world’s population but 42 percent of all forc-
ibly displaced people, millions of whom were 
unable to access basic services, including 
education; and 
(8) 86 percent of all refugees were hosted by 
developing nations, and less than 1 percent 
of vulnerable refugees in need of resettle-
ment had the opportunity to resettle because 
sufficient numbers of places do not exist; 
Whereas refugees are major contributors to 
local economies and served as critical front-
line health professionals and essential work-
ers 
combating 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
worldwide; 
Whereas the United States has an obliga-
tion to provide humanitarian protection to 
refugees, as well as interpreters, translators, 
and others in Afghanistan who served along-
side United States and NATO troops, dip-
lomats, and development workers; 
Whereas the United States supports the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
gees to increase protection for LGBTQI+ ref-
ugees overseas and to support global reset-
tlement of LGBTQI+ refugees; and 
Whereas the United States Refugee Admis-
sions Program, which was established over 40 
years ago, is a lifesaving solution crucial to 
global humanitarian efforts, strengthens 
global security, advances United States for-
eign policy goals, supports regional host 
countries, and assists individuals and fami-
lies in need: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms the bipartisan commitment of 
the United States to promote the safety, 
health, and well-being of millions of refu-
gees, including the education of refugee chil-
dren and displaced persons, who flee war, 
persecution, or torture in search of peace, 
hope, and freedom; 
(2) recognizes those individuals who have 
risked their lives working, either individ-
ually or for nongovernmental organizations 
and international agencies, such as the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
gees, to provide lifesaving assistance and 
protection for people displaced around the 
world; 
(3) underscores the importance of the 
United States Refugee Admissions Program 
as a critical tool for the United States Gov-
ernment to strengthen national and regional 
security and encourage international soli-
darity with host countries; 
(4) calls upon the Secretary of State and 
United States Ambassador to the United Na-
tions to— 
(A) continue providing robust funding for 
refugee protection overseas and resettlement 
in the United States; 
(B) uphold the United States international 
leadership role in responding to displace-
ment crises with humanitarian assistance, 
and restore its leadership role in the protec-
tion of vulnerable refugee populations that 
endure sexual violence, human trafficking, 
persecution and violence against religious 
minorities, forced conscription, genocide, 
and exploitation; 
(C) work in partnership with the inter-
national community to find solutions to ex-
isting conflicts and prevent new conflicts 
from beginning; 
(D) continue supporting the efforts of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refu-
gees to advance the work of nongovern-
mental organizations to protect refugees re-
gardless of their country of origin or reli-
gious beliefs; 
(E) continue to alleviate pressures on 
frontline refugee host countries that absorb 
the majority of the world’s refugees through 
humanitarian and development support; and 
(F) respond to the global refugee crisis by 
meeting robust refugee admissions goals; and 
(5) reaffirms the goals of ‘‘World Refugee 
Day’’ and reiterates the strong commitment 
of the United States to protect the millions 
of refugees who live without material, social, 
or legal protections.

f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, it 
seems like every week, we get a new 
update on the timeline for the origin of 
the COVID–19 virus. This week, we 
learned that in October of 2019—Octo-
ber 2019—that over 1,000 soldiers from 
over 100 countries had gathered in 
Wuhan, China, for a military Olympics, 
if you will. 
Then what we learned is that, several 
weeks after that event, many of our 
own athletes and our own military per-
sonnel became ill, as well as folks from 
other countries. We went back further 
and talked to some of those soldiers. 
They told us that Wuhan, China, 
looked like a ghost town during that 
event. A town of over 11 million people 
looked like a ghost town. 
What I am frustrated about is that 
the CDC has not investigated this, that 
the military has not investigated it, 
and that, during the proper times, we 
could have tested their antibodies. 
When we learned of this, maybe, per-
haps, in March or in April, they prob-
ably still had antibodies. Even today, 
we could investigate it, but we need

the FDA to do its job as well. We need 
the FDA to pass a T-cell test so we can 
go back and see if these soldiers who 
became ill after this event—to see if, 
indeed, this was from the COVID–19 
virus. 
Certainly, the timeline, by all ac-
counts, 
is 
going 
backward 
every 
month, but I think it is time to update 
the American public, too, on what I 
feel are the lab origins of this virus. 
Certainly, this is just a theory, but I 
think we need to look into and discover 
and talk more about the biological ori-
gin of this virus. 
This is a model of COVID–19, the 
virus that has killed millions of people 
across the world. It looks very much 
like the original SARS virus, with an 
exception, and that exception is a pro-
tein spike. The protein spike that I am 
talking about is composed of two units. 
We will call those two units S–1 and S– 
2, and this is a model of that COVID–19 
protein spike. It is very special. It is 
very unique. 
Let’s talk about the S–1 spike just 
for a second. The S–1 spike looks very 
similar—it looks exactly like viral 
gain-of-function research that was con-
ducted between a lab in North Carolina 
and with Dr. Shi, the ‘‘bat lady’’ from 
the Wuhan Institute of Virology. That 
S–1 spike sticks to lung cells like glue. 
Again, this is NIH-funded research, the 
North Carolina lab, and the Wuhan In-
stitute of Virology. 
What we did is we took the basic, 
original SARS virus, and we slapped a 
protein spike on it that made it stick 
to human cells like glue. Think of it as 
being like a key in a lock. Think 
about, if you have a human cell as the 
lock, that there needs to be a special 
key. So they invented a special key 
that would impact and go into only 
human cells. That was done in about 
2015, but then, after that, things go 
dark. We don’t know what happened, 
but, somehow, this COVID–19 virus has 
another part of this protein spike, and 
we will call it the S–2 unit. 
The theory is that, in the Wuhan In-
stitute of Virology and, possibly, in the 
Wuhan CDC Lab, further research was 
done. They developed a special part of 
this spike—again, the S–2 unit. This is 
what is so special about it: It has what 
we call a furin cleavage site. The furin 
cleavage site is—and don’t take it from 
me; take it from Nobel Laureate Dr. 
David Baltimore. 
Dr. Baltimore said that the furin 
cleavage site with its double arginine 
codon—and I am paraphrasing here—is 
the smoking gun for the lab origin of 
the virus in that this double arginine 
codon just doesn’t occur in nature and 
that only human cells have the ability 
to use that furin cleavage site and 
break this into two separate units. 
That is what allows this virus to dump 
its genetic material into human lung 
cells and replicate. 
As a physician, as a person who has 
studied virology a bit, this protein 
spike just doesn’t look like it comes 
from 
nature. 
Everything 
about 
it 
would suggest that it was made in a 
laboratory. It is just too mean. It is 
too angry. It is just too perfect. It is 
too infectious. The unique thing about 
it is, though some would make us be-
lieve that this virus comes from bats, 
this virus doesn’t like bats. 
It only took American scientists and 
Chinese scientists 4 months to discover 
the origin of the original SARS virus, 
that it came from a bat and then it 
went to another animal, an inter-
mediate host. It only took us 4 months 
to discover that virus. The MERS 
virus, on the other hand, it took us 
about 9 months. Here we are 18 months 
later, and we don’t have any type of an 
intermediate host. All of the mapping 
that we are seeing points to this virus 
being made in a laboratory. 
Now, the Wuhan lab could disprove 
me. They have the data to prove me 
wrong, but I am afraid that the data is 
now gone. It is gone forever—most 
likely destroyed—unless, of course, we 
can find it in a cloud somewhere. 
It is outrageous that a comprehen-
sive investigation on the origins of 
COVID–19 has still not been carried 
out. Now, I am proud that this body 
passed a resolution that Senator GILLI-
BRAND and I put together that calls for 
a transparent investigation of the 
COVID–19 outbreak, mandated by the 
World Health Assembly. It unani-
mously passed this body, and that reso-
lution demands a full and transparent 
investigation to include the United 
States and our allies and our partners 
around the world. 
Now, it is time for the Senate to do 
our job. It is time for the Senate to 
fully investigate the origins of this 
virus as well. It would be utterly irre-
sponsible to suffer through the worst 
pandemic in a century and not have 
the origins fully investigated. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING JAMES TIMOTHY 
‘‘MUDCAT’’ GRANT, JR. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, last 
week, America lost a baseball legend, a 
pioneer in civil rights, Jim ‘‘Mudcat’’ 
Grant. 
He joined the Cleveland Indians in 
1958. He spent 14 years in the Major 
Leagues. I remember watching him 
play when I was a kid growing up in 
Cleveland in the 1960s. 
Cleveland has been, more than any 
other franchise, perhaps, a pioneer for 
change in baseball. Cleveland had the 
first Black player in the American 
League, Larry Doby, Hall of Famer. He 
came into the league only about 2 
months after Jackie Robinson inte-
grated the National League. Cleveland 
had the first Black manager, Hall of 
Famer Frank Robinson. Cleveland also 
had ‘‘Mudcat’’ Grant, who refused to be 
silent in the face of segregated hotels 
and racist slurs and discrimination 
from management. 
Grant was an accomplished singer 
with a beautiful voice. He organized 
the singing group ‘‘Mudcat and the Kit-
tens’’ to make up the income he was 
denied that other players had, that 
White players had, in advertising and 
endorsements. 
Companies 
wouldn’t 
hire a Black player. They toured the 
country during the off-season, per-
forming with Johnny Carson and in 
places a little less known. 
I remember Grant in later years serv-
ing as an announcer for Cleveland In-
dian games with a southern drawl that 
was unmistakable. 
He didn’t just use that voice, though, 
for entertainment or commentating on 
plays; he used it to speak out for civil 
rights. 
During the national anthem at one 
game, 
predating 
Colin 
Kaepernick, 
Mudcat Grant—in the 1960s, before civil 
rights and voting rights had passed 
this Congress, he said this during the 
national anthem. He said: 
This land is not free. I can’t even go to 
Mississippi and sit down at a lunch counter. 
A Major League Baseball player. 
In 1958, he and his White teammate 
Gary Bell roomed together for away 
games, becoming the first time—play-
ers, in those days, when they were paid 
less than management, charged less, 
whatever, players roomed together. 
Two players would room together. 
Gary Bell and Mudcat Grant were the 
first Black and White roommates in 
the major leagues in 1958. 
While running for President, Senator 
John F. Kennedy invited Mudcat Grant 
to breakfast. Grant didn’t hold back. 
He talked openly with Senator Ken-
nedy, with the future President, about 
the poverty he grew up in, the racism 
he endured every day—this was 1960—as 
a Major League Baseball player. 
Of course, it wasn’t only his activism 
we remember Mudcat Grant for. We 
know his talent on the field. He was 
Minor League’s Rookie of the Year in 
1954, only 7 years after baseball was in-
tegrated. 
In 1965, he was the first Black player 
to win 20 games in the American 
League. He should have been the first, 
but listen to this: For years, major 
league managers conspired to prevent 
Black pitchers from becoming 20-game 
winners. That almost doesn’t make 
sense. 
Well, Grant said some catchers would 
tell the hitters, the opposing hitters, 
while they were catching, what was 
coming because they didn’t want you 
to do well as a pitcher. 
Other managers, when a player was 
reaching—a pitcher was getting close 
to 20 games, other managers sat the 
player down so he couldn’t win 20 
games as a Black man. 
After Black players pass away, we 
often hear about how they were among 
the underappreciated talents of the 
game. That is not a coincidence. In ad-
dition to being a singer, Grant was also 
a writer. He published a book in 2007 
called ‘‘The Black Aces.’’ It is about 
the great African-American pitchers. 
Part of his project is to tell more sto-
ries about Black players and to teach

IN REMEMBRANCE OF OTTIE 
MOORE 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 23, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
deep sadness but great respect that I take this 
time to remember one of my constituents, 
Ottie Jackson Moore, Sr. of Bowling Green, 
Virginia. 
Mr. Moore passed away on Monday, May 
31, 2021 after nearly a century of life. Ottie 
Moore honored his country with a long career 
of service first with the United States Army, 
and then seven-terms as Caroline Counties 
Sheriff. His life was an example of commit-
ment, dedication, and service from which all of 
us would be wise to emulate. 
When Ottie was not working, he was spend-
ing his time improving the community in any 
way he could. He served as President of the 
Virginia Sheriffs’ Association, advised the Vir-
ginia Assembly in passage of legislation to ad-
vance local law enforcement and was a found-
ing member of the Board that led to the cre-
ation of the Rappahannock Regional Training 
academy in 1977. 
In addition to his life of leadership in the 
military and local law enforcement, Ottie was 
known as a family man and valuable member 
of the community. Along with his wife Dana 
Moore,—together they raised a daughter Mary 
and son ‘‘Jack’’ and worshipped as members 
of the Bowling Green Methodist Church. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring Mr. Ottie Moore, Sr. and in thanking 
the Moore family for his incredible sacrifices, 
devotion, and service to our Nation; words 
cannot express our gratitude. On behalf of 
America’s First District, we say thank you.

HONORING THE LIFE OF COLONEL 
HOUSTON T. ‘‘TERRY’’ HAWKINS, 
RET. USAF 
HON. JEFF DUNCAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 23, 2021 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Colonel Houston T. ‘‘Terry’’ 
Hawkins, who made his trip home on June 14, 
2021, with his wife, Martha Butts Hawkins by 
his side. 
Born in Seneca, South Carolina, Colonel 
Hawkins was known by his friends and family 
as ‘‘Terry.’’ In 1959, Terry graduated from 
Seneca High School with honors and went on 
to further his education at Clemson College, 
which is now known as Clemson University. 
There, he was a member of the ROTC pro-
gram and graduated with a B.S. in Chemistry 
in 1963. Following his graduation, he was sta-
tioned at Wright Patterson Air Force Base 
(AFB) in Dayton, Ohio. While on leave, he 
asked Martha Butts on a date, which began a 
beautiful and lifelong love. The two were mar-
ried on October 3, 1965, and later welcomed 
two beautiful daughters into the world. He was 
a devoted disciple of Christ and a member of 
the White Rock Baptist Church. 
In 1967, Terry was stationed at Kadena Air 
Base in Okinawa, Japan to serve in the Viet-
nam War. After returning home to the U.S., 
Terry and Martha moved to several different 
locations as he rose through the ranks within 
the United States Air Force (USAF). Terry was 
later promoted to Lieutenant Colonel which 
brought his family to the Washington, D.C. 
area where he completed three consecutive 
assignments. Terry became the leader of the 
Defense Intelligence Agency’s Nuclear Energy 
Division from 1979 to 1983. After, he served 
as the Special Assistant to the Secretary of 
Defense for Air Force Nuclear Matters, then 
transferred to the Defense Nuclear Agency in 
1987. Finally, Terry joined the Los Alamos Na-
tional Laboratory where he served our great 
nation for 30 more years. Terry received nu-
merous awards and recognitions throughout 
his career, most notably the Chief Justice Earl 
Warren Medallion awarded by the CIA. He will 
be laid to rest on June 23, in his hometown of 
Seneca. 
Reflecting on the life of Colonel Hawkins, I 
am reminded strongly of the verse John 15:13: 
‘‘Greater love has no one than this: to lay 
down one’s life for one’s friends.’’ From a 
young age, Colonel Hawkins selflessly and 
nobly served his country. I am proud of the 
leadership 
and 
service 
Colonel 
Hawkins 
showed. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to be able 
to serve the Third District of South Carolina 
and to honor the lives of patriots like Colonel 
Hawkins. My thoughts and prayers are with 
his family and friends during this time.

JUNETEENTH NATIONAL 
INDEPENDENCE DAY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, and 
Chairman MCGOVERN, I thank the Committee 
for today’s markup of H.R. 1320/S. 475, 
Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, 
the companion to H.R. 1320, the Juneteenth 
National Independence Day Act, which I intro-
duced in the House and has over 166 mem-
bers as sponsors. 
Earlier this week the CBC; led by myself 
and Congressman TORRES of New York, held 
a Special Order, on Juneteenth and so many 
of my CBC colleagues commemorated this 
historically significant day for all Americans, 
but especially African Americans. 
Juneteenth is as significant to African Amer-
icans as July 4 is to all Americans because on 
that day, June 19, 155 years ago, General 
Gordon Granger, the Commanding Officer of 
the District of Texas, rode into Galveston, 
Texas and announced the freedom of the last 
American slaves; belatedly freeing 250,000 
slaves in Texas nearly two and a half years 
after Abraham Lincoln signed the Emanci-
pation Proclamation. 
When General Granger read these words of 
General Order No. 3 set off joyous celebra-
tions of the freedmen and woman of Texas: 
‘‘The people of Texas are informed that in 
accordance with a Proclamation from the 
Executive of the United States, all slaves are 
free. This involves an absolute equality of 
rights and rights of property between former 
masters and slaves, and the connection 
therefore existing between them becomes 
that between employer and hired laborer.’’ 
Juneteenth was first celebrated in the Texas 
state capital in 1867 under the direction of the 
Freedmen’s Bureau. 
Juneteenth remains the oldest known cele-
bration of slavery’s demise, commemorating 
freedom while acknowledging the sacrifices 
and contributions made by courageous African 
Americans towards making our great nation 
the more conscious and accepting country that 
it has become. 
As the Nation prepares to celebrate July 
4th, our national day of independence, it is a 
time to reflect on the accomplishments of our 
nation and its people. 
I want to thank the Members of the House 
for their bipartisan support of this annual 
Juneteenth Resolution, which has 214 cospon-
sors, of which 202 are original sponsors. 
General Granger’s reading of General Order 
No. 3 ended chattel slavery, a form of per-
petual servitude that held generations of Afri-
cans in bondage in the United States for two- 
hundred and forty-eight years and opened a 
new chapter in American history. 
Recognizing the importance of this date, 
former slaves coined the word ‘‘Juneteenth’’ to 
mark the occasion with a celebrations the first 
of which occurred in the Texas state capital in 
1867 under the direction of the Freedmen’s 
Bureau. 
Juneteenth was and is a living symbol of 
freedom for people who did not have it. 
Juneteenth remains the oldest known cele-
bration of slavery’s demise. 
It commemorates freedom while acknowl-
edging the sacrifices and contributions made 
by courageous African Americans towards 
making our great Nation the more conscious 
and accepting country that it has become. 
The celebration of Juneteenth followed the 
most devastating conflict in our country’s his-
tory, in the aftermath of a civil war that pitted 
brother against brother, neighbor against 
neighbor and threatened to tear the fabric of 
our union apart forever that America truly be-
came the land of the free and the home of the 
brave. 
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once 
said, ‘‘Freedom is never free,’’ and African 
American labor leader A. Phillip Randolph 
often said ‘‘Freedom is never given. It is won.’’ 
Truer words were never spoken. 
We should all recognize the power and the 
ironic truth of those statements, and we

June 23, 2021 
should pause to remember the enormous 
price paid by all Americans in our country’s 
quest to realize its promise. 
Juneteenth honors the end of the 400 years 
of suffering African Americans endured under 
slavery and celebrates the legacy of persever-
ance that has become the hallmark of the Afri-
can American experience in the struggle for 
equality. 
The poet Langston Hughes reminds us in 
his famous poem, ‘‘Mother to Son,’’ life in 
America for African Americans ‘‘ain’t been no 
crystal stair.’’ 
The post-bellum period in America was 
marked by violence and terrorism against Afri-
can Americans as they sought to make real 
the promises of the Declaration of Independ-
ence and the Constitution. 
Nowhere was the reign of terror to which 
they were subjected more horrific than the 
1921 Tulsa-Greenwood Race Massacre, which 
occurred a century ago this past May 31 
through June 1. 
Tulsa’s Greenwood District was known as 
‘‘Black Wall Street,’’ and was the most pros-
perous African American community in the 
United States. 
The Greenwood community with a popu-
lation of over 10,000 Black people had stores 
that sold luxury items, 21 restaurants, 30 gro-
cery stores, a hospital, a savings and loan 
bank, a post office, three hotels, jewelry and 
clothing stores, two movie theaters, a library, 
pool halls, a bus and cab service, a nationally 
recognized school system, six private air-
planes, and two black newspapers. 
But on May 31st of that year, the 35 city 
blocks of Greenwood went up in flames, at 
least 300 Black persons were murdered and 
more than 800 were injured; it is estimated 
that not less than 9,000 were left homeless 
and destitute. 
The message of the Tulsa Race Massacre 
was clear to Black America: ‘‘Stay in your 
place. Do not attempt to accumulate and be-
queath wealth or own property. Remember 
your history in America is as chattel property.’’ 
If they were still alive, the domestic terrorists 
of the mob in Greenwood would see their evil 
reenacted—and then followed by a similar at-
tempt to cover it up and foster collective am-
nesia—a century later in the siege and dese-
cration of the hallowed halls of the U.S. Cap-
itol, the ‘Citadel of Democracy’. 
It should not be overlooked that the source 
of the January 6 white mob’s irrational anger, 
hatred, and violent reaction was that Black 
Americans voted in overwhelming numbers in 
Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and 
other enclaves to oust the most pro-White su-
premacy President since the Civil War. 
Some might ask ‘‘Why dwell on the past? 
Let us forget unpleasant things and move on 
into the future.’’ 
My answer is to quote the great southern 
writer William Faulkner: ‘‘The past is never 
dead. It is not even the past.’’ 
The hatreds, prejudices, resentments, and 
white supremacy that Black Americans wit-
nessed and suffered in Greenwood a century 
ago are not dead; they are not even past. 
So my message to the descendants of the 
survivors and victims of slavery, America’s 
Original Sin, is to keep fighting for justice, to 
never be silent, to affirm the truth, and seek 
accountability. 
In his famous Second Inaugural Address, 
President Lincoln spoke of the profound moral 
debt owed for ‘‘all the wealth piled by the 
bondsman’s two hundred and fifty years of un-
requited toil,’’ and that the Civil War was the 
judgment of the Lord, which was ‘‘true and 
righteous altogether.’’ 
That debt remains to be paid, which is why 
African Americans have always peacefully pe-
titioned the government for the redress of its 
grievances. 
As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King said at 
the 1963 March on Washington: 
‘‘In a sense, we have come to our Nation’s 
capital to cash a check. When the architects 
of our republic wrote the magnificent words 
of the Constitution and the Declaration of 
Independence, they were signing a promis-
sory note to which every American was to 
fall heir. 
‘‘This note was a promise that all men, 
yes, black men as well as white men, would 
be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
‘‘It is obvious today that America has de-
faulted on this promissory note insofar as 
her citizens of color are concerned. Instead 
of honoring this sacred obligation, America 
has given the Negro people a bad check, a 
check which has come back marked ‘insuffi-
cient funds.’ But we refuse to believe that 
the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to 
believe that there are insufficient funds in 
the great vaults of opportunity of this na-
tion. So we have come to cash this check— 
a check that will give us upon demand the 
riches of freedom and the security of jus-
tice.’’ 
In recent years, a number of National 
Juneteenth Organizations have arisen to take 
their place alongside older organizations—all 
with the mission to promote and cultivate 
knowledge and appreciation of African Amer-
ican history and culture. 
Juneteenth celebrates African American 
freedom while encouraging self-development 
and respect for all cultures. 
But it must always remain a reminder to us 
all that liberty and freedom are precious birth-
rights of all Americans, which must be jeal-
ously guarded and preserved for future gen-
erations. 
I am pleased to see this important legisla-
tion before this Committee on the eve of it be-
coming law.

IN RECOGNITION OF FORMER REP-
RESENTATIVE PAUL MITCHELL 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 23, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize former Michigan Rep-
resentative Paul Mitchell. He served Michi-
gan’s 10th District from 2017 until his retire-
ment at the beginning of this year. After being 
diagnosed with Stage IV renal cancer this 
month, he recently underwent multiple sur-
geries in addition to starting immunotherapy 
treatment. Even though my heart hurts for 
Paul and his family, I know he is courageous 
and brave, and I know he will fight through 
this illness. 
Representative Mitchell served on numerous 
committees, including on the Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee and the House 
Committee on Armed Services. As a member 
of Congress, Representative Mitchell was a 
champion for Michigan’s families and small 
businesses, as well as a strong advocate for 
our armed forces and strengthening our na-
tional security. 
As a colleague and a friend, Representative 
Mitchell has always been a man of principle 
and has been committed to working with oth-
ers for the betterment of this nation. He’s 
crossed party lines to work on police reform 
and joined the bipartisan fight to keep Michi-
gan’s Great Lakes safe and clean for all. In 
his last term as a Member of Congress, he 
notably stood up for democracy during the 
2020 election even when it was an unpopular 
position for him to take. His bravery will be a 
part of his legacy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in thanking former Representative Paul 
Mitchell for his leadership and service. I join 
the entire Michigan delegation in sending our 
colleague Paul Mitchell and his family strength 
and love as he begins treatment and con-
veying our many thanks to the team at Henry 
Ford Health System for their continued care.

IN MEMORY OF PATRICIA 
O’SULLIVAN SRAMEK 
HON. ALAN S. LOWENTHAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 23, 2021 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
in 
memory 
of 
Patricia 
O’Sullivan 
Sramek, a lifelong resident of Long Beach, 
California, an outstanding person, and a dear 
personal friend. Patti passed away suddenly in 
her home on June 16, 2021. 
She is survived by her husband Nicholas, 
her children David and Bridget, her daughter- 
in-law Mary, her grandchildren Eleanor, Abra-
ham, Ingrid and Levi, and her brother Patrick 
Burke. She was a sister-in-law to Debbie, 
Hilda and Kathy. She was a loving aunt to 
Patrick, April, Tom, Tracy, Alex and Carla. 
She was predeceased by her parents Patrick 
O’Sullivan and Marguerite (Margie) O’Sullivan. 
Patti was born in 1942 in Long Beach, Cali-
fornia. She grew up in West Long Beach, 
where she lived with her family, and attended 
Poly High School. She met her future husband 
Nick, whose family lived half a mile away on 
Delta Avenue. On July 27, 1968 they were 
married in a small ceremony at St. Lucy’s Par-
ish and their reception was held on a rainy 
afternoon in her parents’ backyard—she al-
ways noted that the rain was good luck. She 
and Nick moved to North Carolina where he 
was enlisted in the United States Army at Fort 
Bragg. In August 1970 and September 1976, 
she and Nick welcomed their children into the 
world at Long Beach Memorial Hospital. 
Patti held many jobs in her life including 
making milkshakes at Tom’s Burgers on Santa 
Fe Avenue as a teenager and sewing pockets 
on pants in a factory in Sanford, North Caro-
lina. She was a champion for the communities 
of the West Side and served as a Field Dep-
uty for the City of Long Beach’s Seventh 
Council District for many years. She was 
known for driving the neighborhood daily to 
spot sidewalks and streets that needed repairs 
and to visit with neighbors. Along with her 
brother Burke, Patti helped care for her aging 
parents Pat and Margie prior to their passing. 
She later retired and welcomed her four

grandchildren in succession—Ella, Abe, Ingrid 
and Levi. She was a devoted and beloved 
grandmother who was known simply as ‘‘GG’’. 
Patti was a towering beauty, a one-in-a-mil-
lion woman, and a force of nature. She was 
famous for her ability to strike up a conversa-
tion with anyone and everyone she crossed 
paths with. She loved a good martini, big sun-
glasses, Frank Sinatra, art museums and 
beautiful gardens. As COVID-related restric-
tions began to lift, she daydreamed about trav-
eling the English and Irish countryside. She 
would say that in her life she was most proud 
of her 52-year marriage, motherhood, and the 
fierce love she held for her family. She will be 
greatly missed, but her family takes comfort 
that she has joined her mother and father 
whom she adored.

EXTENSION

MANAGEMENT 
PLANNING DEADLINE FOR NA-

GELL ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 23, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduced a bill to extend the statutory dead-
line for submitting a management plan for the 
six National Heritage Areas designated under 
the John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Manage-
ment, and Recreation Act of 2019 (Public Law 
116–9). 
Current law directs the local coordinating 
entity for each National Heritage Area to sub-
mit a management plan to the National Park 
Service within three years of the date of en-
actment: March 12, 2022. However, due to the 
COVID–19 pandemic, many of the local co-
ordinating entities need additional time to final-
ize their management plans, including com-
pleting a robust public engagement process 
not possible during much of 2020. 
As Deputy Secretary of the Interior during 
the Clinton Administration, I know that local 
coordinating entities for National Heritage 
Areas need sufficient time to prepare effective 
management plans that reflect substantial 
public feedback. The John D. Dingell Jr. Con-
servation, Management, and Recreation Act of 
2019 (Public Law 116–9) included the House 
sponsor of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta 
National Heritage Area Act, of which I spon-
sored with Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D–CA). 
More time will allow California’s first and the 
other newly designated National Heritage 
Areas to conduct greater public engagement, 
preform fulsome tribal consultations, and com-
plete all necessary field work to ensure these 
new National Heritage Areas are set up for 
success. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representatives 
MCKINLEY (R–WV), SMITH (D–WA), SCHRIER 
(D–WA), KILMER (D–WA), JAYAPAL (D–WA), 
GRIJALVA (D–AZ), and STRICKLAND (D–WA) for 
their support as original cosponsors. I look for-
ward to working with Natural Resources Chair-
man RAU´ L GRIJALVA to ensure this critical 
piece of legislation becomes law. 
RECOGNIZING FORMER DIRECTOR 
OF THE NEW JERSEY OFFICE OF 
HOMELAND SECURITY AND PRE-
PAREDNESS JARED MAPLES ON 
HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 23, 2021 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor former Director of the New 
Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Pre-
paredness Jared Maples on his retirement. 
Director Maples retirement from public serv-
ice is much deserved. Prior to working at New 
Jersey’s Office of Homeland Security and Pre-
paredness, Director Maples served his country 
for over a decade at the Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA) and the U.S. Department of De-
fense. 
As Director of the New Jersey Office of 
Homeland Security, Jared Maples committed 
himself to making life safer for all residents of 
New Jersey. He led New Jersey’s counterter-
rorism efforts, and cybersecurity efforts and 
served as a critical link in New Jersey’s 
COVID–19 response. Director Maples was a 
staunch advocate for the interfaith community 
and worked hard to ensure that they remained 
safe from bias crimes. I was honored to par-
ticipate on numerous events with Director 
Maples and found him to be an individual who 
truly cares about the safety and well-being of 
all residents in my district and throughout New 
Jersey. 
I commend Director Maples for his work, 
and I know I speak on behalf of my constitu-
ents when I say congratulations.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. 
THOMAS JAMES OSBORNE 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 23, 2021 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Mr. Thomas James 
Osborne, beloved husband, father, grand-
father, friend, community leader, and sports 
enthusiast. 
Tom was born January 5, 1956, in St. 
Cloud, Minnesota, to Irene and Bill Osborne. 
Tom was the third of eight children. He grad-
uated from high school from Central High 
School in Billings, Montana in 1974. At a 
young age, he developed a love for adventure, 
sports, and the great outdoors. Tom received 
a basketball scholarship to Eastern Montana 
College (now Montana State University—Bil-
lings) and earned a bachelor’s degree in 
Physical Education, graduating in 1978. 
Tom founded the Big Sky State Games, an 
Olympic-style sports festival in Montana, and 
served as the executive director from 1985 to 
1993. In addition, he served as the executive 
director of the National Congress of State 
Games from 1993 to 2003 and assisted in the 
creation of the States Games of America. Tom 
also served as a member of the U.S. Olympic 
Committee Board of Directors from 1996 to 
2000. 
Tom met his wife, Amy (Tompson), during a 
fly-fishing class in Billings in 1995. Tom and 
Amy began dating, and he immediately started 
a careful pursuit for her heart and the hearts 
of her children, Ellie and Ben. After five years, 
they were married on November 3, 2001, in 
Midland, Texas, and became a family. 
In 2003, Tom and his family began a new 
adventure, moving to Colorado Springs so that 
Tom could join Colorado Springs Sports Cor-
poration as the president and CEO. It didn’t 
take long for Tom to find his footing in the 
Pikes Peak region. He quickly worked to bring 
various sporting events to Colorado Springs, 
including the Warrior Games, Pikes Peak Air-
strip Attack, premier cycling events, youth 
sports programs, and much more, including 
the Labor Day Lift Off. In addition, Tom served 
as the Chairman of the Pikes Peak Inter-
national Hill Climb for over a decade and was 
a member of the World Arena Board of Direc-
tors. 
Tom and Amy were members of the Pauline 
Chapel at The Broadmoor, attending the inter-
denominational service. Much of Tom’s work 
coincided with non-profits across the commu-
nity, helping people in all situations, including 
troubled youth and veterans, to find respite 
care and comfort in sports and the great out-
doors. When asked about his relationship with 
the Lord, Torn would say, ‘‘Me and Jesus, 
(crossing his fingers) we’re good.’’ 
Tom is described by his wife Amy, and his 
many co-workers, as the kindest, most sup-
portive, humble, ambitious dreamer they have 
ever known. He had an extensive network of 
friends, staff, and community who often found 
themselves in awe of Tom’s ambition and vi-
sion. A few words that Tom scribbled inside of 
a book cover sum up his life perfectly, ‘‘Bars 
are meant to be raised,’’ and indeed, he 
raised them. 
Tom is survived by his beloved wife of near-
ly 20 years, Amy; children: Ellie (Cameron) 
Kuehn and Ben (Kassy) Haughton; grand-
children: Charlie Rose and James Bridges; 
siblings: Doug (Jan) Osborne, Pat (Kathi) 
Osborne, Jeanne (Larry) Fritz, Mary (Michael) 
Andres, Cathy (Mark) Johnson, Jan (Doug) 
Grotiz, Will (Tina) Osborne; and many nieces, 
nephews, cousins, and in-laws. 
Tom leaves a legacy in which no stone went 
unturned and no mission unconquered. Be-
cause of his ability to dream big, countless 
children and adults have a life-long passion for 
sports and athletics, many of whom made a 
career out of these passions. The lasting im-
pact of his influence in the sports and out-
doors community of the Pikes Peak region will 
endure and benefit many generations to come.

RECOGNIZING LOU SPIOTTI 
HON. JOSEPH D. MORELLE 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 23, 2021 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, rise today 
in recognition of Mr. Lou Spiotti as he retires 
from an outstanding career as the Athletic Di-
rector at the Rochester Institute of Tech-
nology, a career spanning four decades of un-
wavering commitment to his student-athletes 
both on and off the field. 
Mr. Spiotti arrived at RIT in 1974 as head 
football coach, after six years he was chosen 
to lead the athletic program. Under his leader-
ship, RIT athletics experienced unprecedented 
success and growth. From an original fifteen 
programs, Mr. Spiotti oversaw the expansion 
to twenty-four programs totaling well over 600 
student-athletes and staff. During his forty- 
one-year tenure, RIT secured forty-one Divi-
sion III conference championships—including 
ten consecutive league titles by the men’s la-
crosse program and women’s basketball play-
ing in three straight NCAA Tournaments. Mr. 
Spiotti’s decades of service make him the 
longest-tenured intercollegiate athletic director 
in the nation—a remarkable accomplishment. 
Academic success was always as important 
to Mr. Spiotti as athletic success. During his 
career, the athletic department’s cumulative 
grade point average regularly exceeded that of 
the overall student body. Additionally. Mr. 
Spiotti spearheaded multiple athletic facility 
upgrades including the completion of the 
4,300 seat Gene Polisseni Center. For his 
body of work as a leader, coach, and adminis-
trator Mr. Spiotti has earned the respect and 
admiration of the RIT community. He leaves 
behind a culture of integrity, character, and 
class. 
Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you 
join me in extending congratulations on Mr. 
Spiotti’s well-deserved retirement and in ex-
pressing our appreciation for his years of serv-
ice to the RIT community.

TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF 
DELOS ‘‘DEE’’ ORAN CIRCLE 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 23, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of a great American and life- 
long friend, Dee Circle. 
Dee died peacefully at home in Rancho Mi-
rage, California, on May 20, 2021. He was 
predeceased by his father, mother, sister, and 
grandson, Taylor. Dee leaves behind his lov-
ing wife, Candace, daughters Lori (Gil Solon), 
Jenny (Dermot Cronin), and Jamie, grand-
children Ryan, Tommy and Lily, and his broth-
er Dick Circle. 
Delos Oran Circle was born in Selah, Wash-
ington, on August 20, 1938, to Gracia Fern 
Lancaster and William Oran Circle. He had 
two older siblings, Dick and Sharon, and spent 
his childhood in Washington. After high school 
he joined the Coast Guard and moved to 
northern California. He was a Peninsula resi-
dent for over 50 years. 
In 
1974, 
Dee 
married 
Candace 
Lee 
Edmondson and their flower girl was my 
daughter, Karen. They had two daughters, 
Jennifer Dee and Jamie Leigh. Dee was a 
successful real estate loan broker and devel-
oper in the San Francisco Bay area. He was 
an avid golfer and sports fan, cheering on his 
beloved Warriors, 49ers, and SF Giants, and 
never missed a minute of The Masters. Dee 
was Jenny’s No. 1 fan as she played basket-
ball through college. 
In 2003, Dee and Candy retired to the 
desert and built a home at PGA West. Dee 
was a loving husband, father, grandfather, 
brother and friend. He was kind, generous and 
funny, and was always the biggest personality 
in the room surrounded by friends. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring the life 
of this good man. Dee Circle lived a purpose-
ful life by being a loving family man, a loyal 
friend, a patriot and a man of integrity. He will 
be sorely missed by all those who had the 
good fortune to know him and he will always 
be remembered as a true blessing to each of 
us.

JUNETEENTH NATIONAL 
INDEPENDENCE DAY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 16, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee, the Chair of the Subcommittee on 
Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, and 
the principal sponsor in the House of the 
Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, I 
rise in strong and enthusiastic support of S. 
475, the Senate companion to the Juneteenth 
National Independence Day Act for my bill 
H.R. 1320 introduced on February 25, 2021, 
which establishes June 19 as a federal holi-
day. 
Research by the Library of Congress look-
ing back to the beginning of the Congress’s 
existence as a legislative body could find no 
bill that sought to make Juneteenth a federal 
holiday, prior to the bill I introduced on June 
18, 2020. 
I have introduced the Juneteenth resolution 
annually since 2013. 
In 2020, the resolution received 214 spon-
sors in the House of Representatives. 
This surge in support let me know that the 
nation was ready for a new holiday and there-
fore I introduced H.R. 7232, the Juneteenth 
National Independence Day Act which re-
ceived 158 sponsors in the 116th Congress. 
Senator Doug Jones and Senator EDWARD 
MARKEY contacted my office seeking to intro-
duce a Senate companion. 
Later ED MARKEY’S staff reached out to col-
laborate 
on 
a 
Senate 
version 
of 
my 
Juneteenth Holiday bill and ultimately intro-
duced the Senate version of the bill, which fol-
lowed the text of H.R. 1320. 
I applaud the U.S. Senate for passing S. 
475/1320, Juneteenth National Independence 
Day Act, companion legislation to H.R. 1320, 
which I introduced to make Juneteenth a fed-
eral holiday to commemorate the end of chat-
tel slavery, America’s Original Sin, and to cel-
ebrate the perseverance that has been the 
hallmark of the African American struggle for 
equality. 
I thank Senator MARKEY of Massachusetts 
for contacting my office with his request to in-
troduce the Senate companion to H.R. 1320 
for this Congress, and to my senior senator, 
Senator JOHN CORNYN of Texas for his stead-
fast support of the Juneteenth holiday over the 
years, and others who spearheaded this effort 
in the Senate, and Senate Majority Leader 
SCHUMER for his support and for using his leg-
islative skills to ensure the bill was voted on 
and passed. 
Madam Speaker, the process that has 
brought us to this day has been bipartisan, bi-
cameral, cooperative, and constructive begin-
ning with my collaboration in the 116th Con-
gress with former Senator Doug Jones of Ala-
bama and Senator CORNYN of Texas to co-
ordinate the introduction and cultivate the nec-
essary support for the Juneteenth National 
Independence Day Act. 
That partnership has continued through the 
117th Congress with the addition of Senator 
MARKEY of Massachusetts as the lead Demo-
cratic sponsor in the Senate. 
The bipartisan H.R. 1320, the House 
version of S. 475/H.R. 1320, is sponsored by 
166 Members from all regions of the country, 
including two of my Republican colleagues 
from Texas, Congressman VAN TAYLOR and 
Congressman RANDY WEBER. 
Madam Speaker, now it is time for the 
House of Representatives to act swiftly and 
bring to the floor, vote on, 
pass 
the 
Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, 
and send it to the desk of President Biden for 
signature. 
With the President’s signature, the federal 
government will join 47 states in recognizing 
as a holiday Juneteenth, the day that has 
been celebrated by African Americans for 156 
years and has been called rightly as ‘Amer-
ica’s second Independence Day.’ 
Let me extend on behalf of all of us who 
have labored to pass this important legislation 
our deep appreciation to the House leader-
ship, particularly Majority Leader HOYER, for 
their support which paved the way for the 
House last year to pass by unanimous con-
sent H. Res. 1001, the resolution I introduced 
recognizing Juneteenth Independence Day. 
As I have said many times, Juneteenth is as 
significant to African Americans as July 4 is to 
all Americans because on that day, June 19, 
155 years ago, General Gordon Granger, the 
Commanding Officer of the District of Texas, 
rode into Galveston, Texas and announced 
the freedom of the last American slaves; belat-
edly freeing 250,000 slaves in Texas nearly 
two and a half years after Abraham Lincoln 
signed the Emancipation Proclamation. 
When General Granger read these words of 
General Order No. 3 set off joyous celebra-
tions of the freedmen and women of Texas: 
‘‘The people of Texas are informed that in 
accordance with a Proclamation from the 
Executive of the United States, all slaves are 
free. This involves an absolute equality of 
rights and rights of property between former 
masters and slaves, and the connection 
therefore existing between them becomes 
that between employer and hired laborer.’’ 
Juneteenth thus made real to the last per-
sons living under the system of chattel slav-
ery, of human bondage, the prophetic words 
of President Abraham Lincoln delivered No-
vember 19, 1863, at Gettysburg ‘that this na-
tion, under God, shall have a new birth of 
freedom—and that government of the people,

June 23, 2021 
by the people, for the people, shall not perish 
from the earth.’ 
Juneteenth was first celebrated in the Texas 
state capital in 1867 under the direction of the 
Freedmen’s Bureau and remains the oldest 
known celebration of slavery’s demise, com-
memorating freedom while acknowledging the 
sacrifices and contributions made by coura-
geous African Americans towards making our 
great nation the more conscious and accept-
ing country that it has become. 
As the nation prepares to celebrate July 4th, 
our Nation’s independence day, it is a time to 
reflect on the accomplishments of our nation 
and its people. 
The celebration of Juneteenth followed the 
most devastating conflict in our country’s his-
tory, in the aftermath of a civil war that pitted 
brother against brother, neighbor against 
neighbor and threatened to tear the fabric of 
our union apart forever that America truly be-
came the land of the free and the home of the 
brave. 
Juneteenth honors the end of the 400 years 
of suffering African Americans endured under 
slavery and celebrates the perseverance that 
has been the hallmark of the African American 
experience in the struggle for equality. 
But as the poet Langston Hughes reminds 
us in his famous poem, ‘Mother to Son,’’ life 
in America for African Americans ‘‘ain’t been 
no crystal stair.’ 
The post-bellum period in America was 
marked by violence and terrorism against Afri-
can Americans as they sought to make real 
the promises of the Declaration of Independ-
ence and the Constitution. 
General Granger’s reading of General Order 
No. 3 ended the remaining vestiges of the 
system of chattel slavery, a form of perpetual 
human bondage that held generations of Afri-
cans in captivity in the United States for two- 
hundred and forty-eight years and opened a 
new chapter in American history. 
Recognizing the importance of this date, 
former slaves coined the word ‘‘Juneteenth’’ to 
celebrate the occasion, the first of which oc-
curred in the Texas state capital in 1867 under 
the direction of the Freedmen’s Bureau. 
Juneteenth was and is a living symbol of 
freedom for people who did not have it. 
Juneteenth remains the oldest known cele-
bration of America’s freedom from slavery. 
I commemorates freedom while acknowl-
edging the sacrifices and contributions made 
by courageous African Americans in the quest 
to make our more perfect. 
The celebration of Juneteenth followed the 
most devastating conflict in our country’s his-
tory, in the aftermath of a civil war that pitted 
brother against brother, neighbor against 
neighbor and threatened to tear the fabric of 
our union apart forever that America truly be-
came the land of the free and the home of the 
brave. 
The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once 
said, ‘‘Freedom is never free,’’ and African 
American labor leader A. Phillip Randolph 
often said ‘‘Freedom is never given. It is won.’’ 
Truer words were never spoken. 
We should all recognize the power and the 
ironic truth of those statements, and we 
should pause to remember the enormous 
price paid by all Americans in our country’s 
quest to realize its promise. 
In recent years, a number of National 
Juneteenth Organizations have arisen to take 
their place alongside older organizations—all 
with the mission to promote and cultivate 
knowledge and appreciation of African Amer-
ican history and culture. 
I am reminded that the first legislation intro-
duced in Congress recognizing Juneteenth oc-
curred a quarter century ago, in 1996, when 
H.J. Res. 195 was introduced by Congress-
woman Barbara Rose Collins of Michigan and 
I have introduced similar legislation annually 
since the 109th Congress. 
So it has been a long road we have trav-
elled to get to this day, even longer that the 
15-year journey taken to pass the bill making 
the Birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. a national holiday. 
Juneteenth celebrates African American 
freedom, and in so doing celebrates America’s 
history 
and 
promise, 
while 
encouraging 
selfdevelopment and respect for all cultures. 
But it must always remain a reminder to us 
all that liberty and freedom are precious birth-
rights of all Americans, which must be jeal-
ously guarded and preserved for future gen-
erations. 
In conclusion, I wish to take a moment to 
salute two of the unsung heroes who helped 
bring us to this day: the late Texas State Rep-
resentative Al Edwards and nonagenarian 
Opal Lee, known affectionately as the ‘‘Grand-
mother of Juneteenth.’’ 
In 
1852, 
Frederick 
Douglass 
famously 
asked: ‘‘What to the slave is the 4th of July?’’ 
In 2021, we can reply that it is the beginning 
of the American Promise that would be fulfilled 
and made real for all Americans, including the 
descendants of slaves, on June 19, 1865, 
‘Juneteenth Day.’ 
That is why we celebrate Juneteenth and 
that is why I urge all Members to join me in 
voting 
to 
pass 
H.R 
1320/S. 
475, 
the 
‘‘Juneteenth National Independence Day Act.’’
