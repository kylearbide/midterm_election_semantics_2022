PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Lord of Heaven’s Army, we find our 
joy from trusting You. Today we are 
trusting Your promise to supply all our 
needs from Your celestial riches. 
Lord, as we differ in faces, so we are 
different in our needs. Provide for the 
myriad needs of our Nation and world. 
Bring healing to the sick, comfort to 
those who grieve, and wisdom to those 
who seek to meet the challenges of a 
global health crisis. 
Lord, 
give 
our 
lawmakers 
Your 
strength. We claim Your promise that 
You will not withhold any good thing 
from those who do what is right. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The Senate resumed consideration of 
the nomination of Michael Jay New-
man, of Ohio, to be United States Dis-
trict Judge for the Southern District of 
Ohio. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
FISCHER). The President pro tempore. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask to speak for 1 minute as in morn-
ing business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
what we have seen over the last week 
are attempts to get COVID relief up 
and Democrats won’t let us bring it up, 
even though there is widespread agree-
ment on the need for more COVID re-
lief for families, for small businesses, 
for farms, for schools and colleges, and 
for additional funding for testing and 
vaccines. These are all noncontrover-
sial items being held up by Democrat 
leaders’ all-or-nothing negotiating po-
sition. 
One controversial item they insist on 
is bailing out irresponsible State gov-
ernments. 
Iowa’s years of sound governance and 
fiscal responsibility, including a rainy 
day fund that is full, has paid off in 
times like this. A study for the Council 
of State Governments ranked every 
State’s ability to weather the eco-
nomic impact of the pandemic. It found 
my State of Iowa to be fiscally sound— 
the most resilient State in the coun-
try. 
In addition to the Council of State 
Governments, 
the 
CATO 
Institute 
ranked our Governor’s fiscal policy sec-
ond out of all 50 States. Other States 
haven’t made the same tough decisions 
and weren’t ready before the pandemic. 
Now Democrats want Iowans’ Federal 
tax money to bail out irresponsible 
State governments and somehow this 
is worth holding up relief for strug-
gling families. Come on. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday evening the Directors of Na-
tional Intelligence and the FBI updated 
the public on foreign efforts to influ-
ence our election and our government’s 
work to prevent them. They announced 
that Iran and Russia exploited voter 
information to send misleading emails. 
This is just another reminder that mul-
tiple different adversaries with mul-
tiple different objectives want to fuel 
divisions among Americans and create 
chaos. Iran, China, Russia, and other 
adversaries may have different goals, 
but they all share the same primary 
objective of undermining America’s 
confidence in our democracy, and they 
are thrilled when their disinformation 
causes us to point fingers at each other 
rather than at them. 
The good news is that we have spent 
the last 4 years gearing up for this. Un-
like the Obama-Biden administration, 
on whose watch even Democrats admit 
we were caught flatfooted, the Trump 
administration has worked overtime 
with Congress and other actors to get 
us ready.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6384 
October 22, 2020 
The White House has imposed harsh 
new sanctions on Russians who inter-
fered in 2016. The Department of Jus-
tice, Department of Homeland Secu-
rity, and the intelligence community 
have led efforts to strengthen and co-
ordinate our defenses. Here in the Sen-
ate, the Intelligence Committee spent 
years studying what went wrong in 2016 
and published a 1,300-plus-page report 
with recommendations. 
In the last 2 years alone, we passed 
more than $800 million to fund and sup-
port secure elections. The Iranian and 
Russian operations described last night 
are being combatted by the Federal 
Government in close coordination with 
State and local officials and the pri-
vate sector. Details are being shared 
with Congress and the public, as appro-
priate. 
This is precisely how the process 
should work. We are literally miles 
ahead of where we were. 
Even the Washington Democrats who 
spent years talking up the threats to 
our election infrastructure are now ad-
mitting that we have made huge 
strides. Just a few days ago, the junior 
Senator for Connecticut admitted: ‘‘We 
are going to have a free and fair elec-
tion . . . because we have spent signifi-
cant money from the Federal Govern-
ment, and through States, to beef up 
protections of our voter lists and our 
voting systems.’’ 
It is a separate question whether 
Democrats’ ability to express basic pa-
triotic confidence in our institutions 
should be so contingent on whether 
their preferred candidate seems to be 
up in the polls. But, regardless, that is 
the truth. 
I will close with one point I keep 
making. The work of protecting our de-
mocracy is not just the job of experts 
and government buildings. This is also 
a duty that falls upon every one of us, 
every single citizen. At this point, it is 
a patriotic duty for Americans to be 
educated consumers of information. 
Citizens who need information about 
voting should look to their local offi-
cial sources, and all of us on all sides 
should take a deep breath and realize 
division, disinformation, and chaos are 
exactly what our adversaries want. We 
are all in this together. All of us Amer-
icans are in this together. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Madam President, this morning, the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
reported 
the 
nomination of Judge Amy Coney Bar-
rett to the floor. Their recommenda-
tion was that she be confirmed. It was 
actually unanimous. As one CNN jour-
nalist stated last week, ‘‘Let’s be hon-
est, in another [political] age . . . 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett would be 
getting 70 votes or more in the U.S. 
Senate because of her qualifications.’’ 
It is supremely ironic that our Demo-
cratic colleagues delivered through a 
temper tantrum what they should have 
delivered through a fair appraisal: a 
unanimous 
endorsement. 
They, 
of 
course, were not there. 
All last week, the legal brilliance and 
judicial temperament our Nation de-
serves in a Supreme Court Justice were 
on full display. We saw why legal peers, 
fellow 
scholars, 
nonpartisan 
eval-
uators, 
students, 
and 
clerks 
from 
across the political spectrum have 
praised this nominee in the very high-
est terms. 
In just a few days, she will receive a 
vote on this floor. I anticipate we will 
have a new Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court of the United States. That 
is exactly what the American people 
want to happen. Clear majorities of 
Americans want Judge Barrett con-
firmed. Of our fellow citizens who 
formed an opinion, roughly two out of 
three want confirmation. 
The Democratic leader’s histrionics 
are proving just as unpersuasive out-
side the Chamber as they have proven 
inside it. His anger and false state-
ments failed to persuade the Senate 
and failed to persuade the American 
people. Day after day, our colleague 
from New York performs the same 
angry speech with the same falsehoods 
and forces a vote on some pointless im-
permissible motion. 
The Democratic leader is just lashing 
out in random ways. A few weeks ago, 
he torpedoed a bipartisan counterintel-
ligence briefing for no reason. This 
week, he blocked a pandemic rescue 
package and tried repeatedly to ad-
journ the Senate for multiple weeks. 
Today, I understand he stood outside 
the Senate to shout that Democrats 
would be boycotting the committee 
vote, and the committee vote had al-
ready ended. 
Look, I understand that some outside 
pressure groups have been badgering 
the Democratic leader to act more 
angry. I am just sorry for the Senate 
that he obeys them. I am sorry our col-
league felt the need to publicly brag 
that he had scolded the senior Senator 
from California for being too civil. 
Scolding somebody for being too civil, 
one of our colleagues? It is not a good 
idea to be civil? 
Really, I am sorry that he feels the 
need to constantly say things that are 
false. The American people know that 
we 
disagree. 
They 
do 
not 
expect 
‘‘kumbaya,’’ but they deserve an adult 
discussion. 
Let’s review some facts. First, the 
timeline. 
The 
Democratic 
leader’s 
claims this process has been rushed are 
simply false. Sixteen days passed be-
tween President Trump’s announce-
ment and the start of the hearings. In 
the last 60 years alone, eight Supreme 
Court 
confirmations 
moved 
faster. 
Only eight moved faster in the last 60 
years. Then 1 week elapsed between the 
end of Judge Barrett’s hearings and to-
day’s committee vote. Half of all the 
confirmations since 1916 have moved 
faster than that. Half of all the con-
firmations since 1916 have moved faster 
than that. 
Justice John Paul Stevens was con-
firmed in 19 days from start to finish. 
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor took just 
over a month. Chief Justice John Mar-
shall was confirmed in 1 week after 
John Adams already lost reelection. 
John Adams appointed Chief Justice 
John Marshall after he had already lost 
the election. President Lincoln got 
someone confirmed in 1 day. 
Obviously, it is completely false to 
say that this has been anywhere close 
to the fastest process ever. It is just 
disinformation. 
Here is another nonsense claim: that 
Judge Barrett is somehow the most 
partisan or politicalized nominee ever. 
Really? Andrew Jackson nominated a 
political operative to the Court at the 
end of his Presidency. Lincoln put his 
own campaign manager on the Court. 
Eisenhower nominated Earl Warren 
after Warren had stopped competing 
with him in the 1952 election and cam-
paigned for him. 
But this professor from Indiana who 
got multiple Democratic votes for con-
firmation to her current job just 3 
years ago is going to be the most polit-
ical confirmation ever? In the previous 
century, 
they 
put 
their 
campaign 
chairman on the Supreme Court. That 
is pretty political. Eisenhower put the 
Governor of California who ran against 
him for the nomination on the Court. 
That is pretty political. 
I will give you an example. 
The great John Marshall Harlan, 
from Kentucky, had a partner who was 
a Cabinet member in the Grant admin-
istration—a 
guy 
named 
Benjamin 
Bristow. Bristow was sort of thought of 
as ‘‘Mr. Clean’’ in the Grant adminis-
tration, which had a lot of scandal 
problems. The GOP convention in 1876 
was going to be in Cincinnati. In those 
days, of course, if you wanted to be 
President, you couldn’t admit it. You 
sort of had to act like you were being 
drafted. So John Marshall Harlan, the 
largely unknown partner of the better 
known Benjamin Bristow, went to Cin-
cinnati, to the GOP convention, to get 
his law partner, Mr. Clean, the nomina-
tion—the perfect choice after 8 years of 
scandal in the Grant administration. 
It became clear after a few rounds of 
voting that he wasn’t going to be able 
to pull it off for his partner, Benjamin 
Bristow, so Harlan threw Bristow’s 
votes to the Governor of Ohio, Ruther-
ford B. Hayes. Amazingly enough, right 
after President Hayes was sworn in in 
March of 1877, it was John Marshall 
Harlan, not Benjamin Bristow, who 
ended up on the Supreme Court. 
He served for 30 years with great dis-
tinction and was the sole dissenter in 
Plessy v. Ferguson. He was the one 
Member of the Court in 1896 who got it 
right with regard to desegregation and 
public accommodations. That actually 
became the majority opinion 58 years 
later in Brown v. Board of Education. 
Talk about a political appointment. 
That was a political appointment. Amy 
Coney Barrett is not the most political 
appointment ever to the Supreme 
Court by any objective standard. So 
these are not really arguments. They 
are just kind of angry noises. 
The Democratic leader said: ‘‘Abra-
ham Lincoln, when [he] had the oppor-
tunity to fill a Supreme Court seat,

October 22, 2020 
said it would be unfair to do it so close 
to an election.’’ 
That is not true. It never happened. 
President Lincoln never said that nor 
did he do that. The Washington Post 
already debunked this disinformation 
when 
another 
Democratic 
Senator 
tried to spread it. 
Now the Democratic leader is claim-
ing Chairman GRAHAM did something 
unprecedented 
in 
committee 
this 
morning. That would be news to Sen-
ator LEAHY, who had a Democratic ma-
jority vote multiple judges to the floor 
in 2014 when there were not two Repub-
licans present. Chairmen of both par-
ties have done the same thing multiple 
times. 
The Democratic leader continues to 
misstate what the Republicans said in 
2016. Let me quote verbatim from my 
very first floor speech after Justice 
Scalia passed away. Here is what I said: 
‘‘The Senate has not filled a vacancy 
arising in an election year when there 
was divided government since 1888.’’ 
That is what we had then, a divided 
government—a Republican Senate and 
a Democratic President. Now, my 
friend the Democratic leader may be 
emotionally invested in this idea that I 
said something else, but that is, in 
fact, what I said. Historical precedent 
supported no confirmation in 2016, and 
it supports confirming Judge Barrett 
now. 
Look, everybody knows what is going 
on here. We know why the Democratic 
leader feels this need to keep saying 
things that aren’t true. Our colleague 
is trying to invent a justification to de-
clare war on judicial independence and 
pack the Supreme Court if the Demo-
crats should win power. That is what 
this is all about. 
Back in March, he walked across the 
street and threatened Justices by name 
if they ruled against his wishes, and 
now, even though this Court ended up 
delighting the political left with sev-
eral decisions this very year, he still 
wants an excuse to pack the Court. 
The American people know what a 
terrible idea this is. Polls show major-
ity support for confirming Judge Bar-
rett and overwhelming opposition to 
court-packing. The American people 
are glad that Franklin Roosevelt didn’t 
get to blow up our independent judici-
ary in 1937, and they strongly oppose 
Democratic threats now. 
The Democratic leader may support 
court-packing, and former Vice Presi-
dent Biden may call it a ‘‘live ball,’’ 
but the American people know these 
threats are anathema to the rule of 
law. 
This Senate majority will not let 
falsehoods drown out facts. We will not 
reward hostage-taking, and we will not 
be bullied out of doing what is right. 
We are going to follow history and 
precedent and do our job. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute as in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
throughout my tenure in the Senate, I 
have been a leader in promoting renew-
able energy sources, like being called 
the father of the wind energy tax cred-
it. This has led to a cleaner environ-
ment and has increased America’s en-
ergy independence. 
It is concerning to see legislation 
from progressive Members of Congress 
that would eliminate internal combus-
tion engine vehicles like the vast ma-
jority of us drives and depends on. In 
other words, we will all have to buy 
electric cars. This is supposed to help 
the environment, but, remember, most 
electrical generation is from fossil 
fuels. 
There are more practical solutions 
available. Currently, renewable fuels 
can reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
by 43 percent, but they would be to-
tally eliminated under this extreme 
bill. By adding more ethanol and bio-
diesel to our energy mix, we can reduce 
emissions while still keeping transpor-
tation costs low for working families. 
I ask my colleagues across the aisle 
to abandon this radical scheme. If they 
want a cleaner environment, then they 
should look to renewable fuels pro-
duced in our Nation’s heartland. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
before I get into the substance of my 
remarks, I will briefly redress the Re-
publican leader. 
He came on the floor and, with his 
typical vitriol, made all kinds of accu-
sations. The bottom line is MCCONNELL 
is angry. Why? Because we Democrats 
have exposed that he has defiled the 
Senate as an institution more than any 
person in this generation and many 
generations, because we Democrats 
have exposed the hypocrisy of holding 
up Merrick Garland because it was 8 
months before an election and rushing 
through Amy Coney Barrett because it 
is ‘‘something we can do.’’ 
The bottom line is Leader MCCON-
NELL, of course, doesn’t like hearing 
these things, but they are the truth, 
and they will live on in history. The 
man who defiled the Senate, the man 
who created one of the greatest hypo-
critical acts in the history of the Sen-
ate, sits in that chair. 
Now, the Republican majority is 
steering the Senate toward one of the 
lowest moments in its long history, 
and the damage it does to this Cham-
ber may very well be irrevocable. 
After thwarting the constitutional 
prerogative of a duly elected Demo-
cratic President to appoint a Supreme 
Court Justice because it was an elec-
tion year, the Republican majority is 
rushing to confirm a Justice for a Re-
publican President 1 week—1 week—be-
fore election day. 
Four short years ago, all of our Re-
publican friends argued that it was 
principle—that is the world they used, 
‘‘principle’’—to let the American peo-
ple have a voice in the selection of a 
Supreme Court Justice because an 
election was 8 months away. 
Those same Republicans are pre-
paring to confirm a Justice with an 
election that is 8 days away. What a 
stench of hypocrisy. 
In the process, the majority has 
trampled over every norm, rule, or 
standard that could possibly stand in 
its way. It ignored health guidelines to 
conduct in-person hearings in the mid-
dle of a pandemic after Republicans 
Members of the committee themselves 
had contracted COVID. 
It has broken longstanding Senate 
precedent. Never in the history of the 
Senate has a Supreme Court nominee— 
a lifetime appointment—been consid-
ered so close to an election. The Pre-
siding Officer of the Senate confirmed 
this yesterday in response to this Sen-
ator’s inquiry. Never in the history of 
the Senate has a Supreme Court nomi-
nee been confirmed after July of an 
election year. 
Before even we arrived at this sordid 
chapter, 
the 
Republican 
majority 
broke the rules of the Senate to change 
the rules of the Senate, lowering the 
number of votes required for a Supreme 
Court nomination so that Republicans 
could confirm whomever they wanted. 
They changed the rules of the Senate 
again to limit the amount of time the 
Senate 
spends 
considering 
judicial 
nominations so they could pack the 
courts with their rightwing appointees 
even faster. 
It is a hallmark of democracy that 
might does not make right, but the Re-
publicans are blatantly ignoring this 
principle. Here, in Leader MCCONNELL’s 
Senate, the majority lives by the rule 
of ‘‘because we can.’’ They completely 
ignore the question of whether they 
should. 
Morality, 
principles, 
value, 
consistency are all out the window. 
Here, now, we have the culmination 
of this Republican majority’s systemic 
erosion of rules and norms in pursuit of 
raw political power: a Supreme Court 
nominee who will be confirmed on a 
party-line vote after the rules were 
changed to allow it, in complete con-
tradiction to the supposed principle

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6386 
October 22, 2020 
that the same party so vehemently ar-
gued only 4 years ago, 8 days before an 
election in which the American people 
will choose exactly whom they want to 
pick Supreme Court Justices for them. 
This idea that because now the Presi-
dency and the Senate are in one party, 
the rule doesn’t apply—they never said 
that when they blocked Merrick Gar-
land. It is fakery. It is, again, part of 
the house of lies that is being built by 
the majority to rush a Supreme Court 
Justice like this. 
It is absurd. It is outrageous. It is a 
stain on this body and an indelible 
mark on this Senate majority that will 
live in history. The Senate Republican 
majority 
is 
conducting 
the 
most 
rushed, most partisan, and least legiti-
mate process in the long history of Su-
preme Court nominations, and Demo-
crats will not lend an ounce of legit-
imacy to that process. 
Today the members of the minority 
on the Judiciary Committee have boy-
cotted the markup of Amy Coney Bar-
rett. The rules of the Judiciary Com-
mittee require that two members of 
the minority be present in order to 
conduct a markup. 
True to form, Chairman GRAHAM de-
cided to break the rules to move for-
ward with a vote on Judge Barrett any-
way—steamrolling over the rules of the 
Judiciary Committee, just like Repub-
licans have steamrolled over principle, 
honesty, fairness, consistency, and de-
cency in their mad rush to confirm a 
Justice before the election. To steam-
roll over rules—that is the mark of an 
autocratic society, not the mark of a 
democracy, and the Republican major-
ity is going along with that kind of au-
tocracy, the same kind exhibited by 
President Trump. It is a shame that 
the principles of the Republican Party 
are out the window. 
Today, the Democratic seats on the 
dais in that committee room remained 
empty. In their place were reminders of 
what is ultimately at stake in this 
nomination—the fundamental rights of 
the American people. In their place 
were photographs of Americans whose 
lives would be devastated if Judge Bar-
rett delivers the decisive vote to strike 
down the Affordable Care Act, ripping 
away healthcare from tens of millions 
of Americans and eliminating protec-
tions for 130 million Americans with 
preexisting conditions. 
You could imagine, alongside their 
faces, the faces of women who cherish 
the right to make their own private 
medical decisions; the faces of LGBTQ 
Americans who want to marry whom 
they love and not be fired for who they 
are; the faces of American workers who 
are breaking their backs to make ends 
meet, who need their union to help 
them get a better wage; the faces of 
young people who know the planet is in 
peril in their lifetimes. 
I hope that when Republican mem-
bers of the committee took their seats 
this morning, they looked at those 
faces. They ought to think about what 
this nomination means for them. I 
hope they actually took one moment 
to think about what it says about their 
sham of a process that Democrats were 
forced to take the extraordinary step 
of refusing to participate. 
While they may realize it or not—or 
they may not even care—the Repub-
lican majority’s monomaniacal drive 
to confirm this Justice in the most 
hypocritical of circumstances will for-
ever defile the Senate and curtail the 
fundamental rights of American people 
for generations to come. 
To every one of my colleagues: His-
tory will remember what you have 
done. Democrats will play no part in it. 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION—MOTION TO PROCEED 
Madam President, while the Senate 
majority rushes to confirm the Su-
preme Court Justice, it is ignoring a 
number of very important priorities. 
Earlier this week, the Republicans 
had a series of stunt votes on COVID 
relief on an emaciated bill that left 
most Americans behind and that was 
even designated to fail. 
Now I want to mention a foreign pol-
icy issue the Republican majority is ig-
noring. We have a resolution by Sen-
ators MENENDEZ and MURPHY to invoke 
statutory authority under the Foreign 
Assistance Act to require the Sec-
retary of State to assess and report to 
the Congress on Turkey’s potential 
human rights abuses in Syria. 
My colleagues introduced this resolu-
tion as a result of Turkey’s invasion of 
northeast Syria and its campaign to 
ethnically cleanse Kurds from the re-
gion, which has resulted in numerous 
reports 
of 
horrific 
human 
rights 
abuses. 
The tragic events were the result of 
the President’s decision to abandon our 
Kurdish partners. The administration 
didn’t lift a finger to uncover the 
atrocities committed by Turkish prox-
ies. 
Even more recently, the Turkish 
Government, led by President Erdogan, 
has blood on his hands for his role in 
the conflict between Armenia and 
Azerbaijan. 
President Erdogan is sending individ-
uals responsible for the atrocities in 
Syria to this region now. He must be 
exposed—he must be exposed—for these 
actions. This President has a record of 
cozying up to dictators, and action 
must be taken. 
So in order to proceed to S. Res. 409, 
a resolution requesting information on 
Turkey’s human rights practices in 
Syria, I move to proceed to legislative 
session. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on the motion to proceed. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the vote 
occur at 12:59 today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask for the yeas and nays on the mo-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The yeas and nays are ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from South Dakota. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, Amy 
Coney Barrett’s first Judiciary Com-
mittee hearing back in 2017 has become 
infamous for the grilling she under-
went for her religion. 
Then, as now, she was an outstanding 
choice who received a rating of ‘‘well 
qualified’’ from the American Bar As-
sociation and praise from peers on both 
sides of the political spectrum. 
But despite her superb qualifications, 
it soon became clear that more than 
one Democrat thought she couldn’t be 
objective and thus shouldn’t be con-
firmed to the court simply because she 
was a practicing Catholic who took her 
faith seriously. 
‘‘The 
dogma 
lives 
loudly 
within 
you,’’ the Democratic ranking member 
on the Judiciary Committee said, ‘‘and 
that is of concern.’’ 
‘‘Do you consider yourself an ortho-
dox Catholic?’’ the Democratic whip 
asked, while the junior Senator from 
Hawaii suggested that Judge Barrett 
would use her Catholic faith rather 
than the law to decide questions. 
And while Democrats toned down the 
anti-religious questioning in Judge 
Barrett’s Supreme Court hearing last 
week, apparently realizing that openly 
displaying their suspicion of her reli-
gion might offend the tens of millions 
of American voters who take their 
faith seriously, their suspicion of her 
faith has still been on display. 
Meanwhile, Democrats’ media allies 
haven’t hesitated to trot out articles 
on Judge Barrett’s beliefs, usually with 
the faint—or in some cases not so 
faint—suggestion that her adherence to 
the teachings of the Catholic Church 
cast doubt on her fitness for the Su-
preme Court. 
Yesterday’s AP article on the fact 
that Judge Barrett served as a trustee 
at her children’s Christian school—not 
exactly breaking news, as it was some-
thing that Judge Barrett had already 
disclosed—was just one more example 
of the media’s implicit suggestion that 
the nominee’s religion makes her unfit 
for public office. 
As a side note, I am still waiting for 
bipartisan condemnation of media cov-
erage of Judge Barrett’s adopted chil-
dren. Somehow the New York Times 
felt that Judge Barrett’s brief men-
tions of her adopted children at her in-
troduction and hearing warranted an 
article full of unsavory insinuations. I 
am wondering if Democrats would have 
found this appropriate coverage of a 
Democratic nominee’s children. 
From 
the 
attitude 
displayed 
by 
Democrats and the media, you would 
think that Judge Barrett was a mem-
ber of some remote and bizarre reli-
gious cult instead of one of the largest 
faith groups in the world. 
And Judge Barrett has not been the 
only judicial nominee subjected to

October 22, 2020 
scrutiny for her faith. The Democrats’ 
Vice Presidential candidate grilled one 
judicial nominee on his membership in 
the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic 
charitable organization known for dan-
gerous activities like selling Christmas 
trees and providing coats for kids in 
need and partnering with other dan-
gerous charities like Habitat for Hu-
manity and Special Olympics. 
Nor is this kind of suspicion of prac-
ticing Catholics and other Christians 
limited to the judicial realm. Demo-
crats’ 
suspicion 
of 
religious 
court 
nominees is just one feature of the 
left’s growing hostility to religion gen-
erally. 
More and more, Democrats and lib-
erals are telling religious Americans 
that they should close their mouths 
and restrict their religion to the pri-
vacy of their homes. 
In September, the former Democratic 
Presidential candidate, Hillary Clin-
ton, suggested that Christianity has 
become 
‘‘judgmental’’ 
and 
‘‘alien-
ating.’’ 
One of the current Democratic Presi-
dential candidate’s staffers recently 
said that she doesn’t think orthodox 
Catholics, Muslims, or Jews should sit 
on the Supreme Court. 
The current Vice Presidential can-
didate introduced legislation in this 
Congress to weaken the Religious Free-
dom Restoration Act, a key law in-
tended to protect Americans’ right to 
live out their religion. 
And forget religious liberty under a 
Democratic administration. The Demo-
cratic Presidential candidate has pub-
licly announced that if he becomes 
President, he intends to go after the 
Little Sisters of the Poor—an order of 
nuns who spend their lives caring for 
the elderly poor—to force them—to 
force them—to offer a health insurance 
provision that violates their religious 
faith. 
That is right. The Democrats’ Presi-
dential 
candidate 
has 
proudly 
an-
nounced that his administration will 
do the heroic work of pursuing a group 
of nuns who serve the poor to ensure 
that they are not allowed to fully live 
out their religious beliefs. 
Where to start? Perhaps I should 
start by noting what should be obvi-
ous—that hostility to religion is fun-
damentally un-American. America was 
founded on religious liberty. Long be-
fore the Declaration of Independence or 
the Constitution was signed, people 
came to these shores seeking the right 
to practice their religion in freedom, 
and that concern for religious liberty 
continued through the founding. 
Religious freedom was regarded as so 
fundamental that it is the very first 
freedom mentioned in the Bill of 
Rights. ‘‘Congress shall make no law 
respecting an establishment of reli-
gion,’’ the Bill of Rights begins, ‘‘or 
prohibiting the free exercise thereof.’’ 
Now, some have interpreted ref-
erences to religion in the Constitution 
to somehow mean that the Founders 
were looking to preference secularism 
over religion and exclude religion from 
the public square. Nothing could be 
further from the truth. Far from want-
ing to diminish the place of religion or 
exclude it from public life, the Found-
ers saw religion as something to be fos-
tered. In fact, religion was widely re-
garded as an essential ingredient in 
producing good citizens—the kinds of 
citizens who could maintain the repub-
lican government the Constitution had 
created. 
To quote George Washington: 
Of all the dispositions and habits which 
lead to political prosperity, religion and mo-
rality are indispensable supports. In vain 
would that man claim the tribute of patriot-
ism, who should labor to subvert these great 
pillars of human happiness, these firmest 
props of the duties of men and citizens. The 
mere politician, equally with the pious man, 
ought to respect and to cherish them. A vol-
ume could not trace all their connections 
with private and public felicity. 
Democrats would like to reduce free-
dom of religion to a grudging tolera-
tion and religious people to second- 
class citizens. That is not what reli-
gious freedom has meant in America. 
In America, religious freedom has al-
ways been a robust freedom—permis-
sion to live out your faith not just in 
the confines of your home but in the 
public square. 
I find it the height of irony that cri-
tiques of religious people like Amy 
Coney Barrett focus on the supposed 
dogmatism or intolerance of religious 
individuals because there are few peo-
ple as dogmatic and intolerant as mem-
bers of the left wing in America. 
Remember when the Women’s March 
was founded at the start of the current 
administration? More than one pro-life 
group wanted to join the march and 
stand for women’s rights, but they 
were quickly kicked off the march’s 
list of partners because the grand pooh- 
bahs of the pro-abortion left have de-
cided that you can’t stand for the dig-
nity of both mother and child and still 
be a feminist. 
It is pretty much the same in the 
Democratic Party. While a few pro-life 
Democrats are tolerated in spots where 
Democrats might not otherwise win, 
the pro-life Democrat is on the way to 
extinction at the party level. Last 
year, for example, the Democratic At-
torneys General Association announced 
that it would not endorse or finance 
candidates who do not support abor-
tion. So I find it the height of irony 
when Democrats complain about the 
supposed dogmatism of religious indi-
viduals. 
Do Democrats evince the same con-
cerns about dogmatism when avidly 
pro-abortion or avidly secular individ-
uals are nominated to the Federal 
bench, or do they assume that these in-
dividuals can set aside their beliefs and 
rule fairly in cases involving abortion 
or religion? I am pretty sure they as-
sume these individuals will be able to 
rule fairly according to the law. Yet 
they deny this respect to religious indi-
viduals. Instead, Democrats offer the 
demeaning and insulting suggestion 
that religious people alone are incapa-
ble of setting aside their personal be-
liefs. 
I would like to see the attacks on 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s faith stop, 
but more than that, I would like to see 
the Democratic Party return to a deep-
er respect for religion and the central 
place of a robust religious freedom in 
American life. I would like to be con-
fident that future nominees will not 
face the suggestion that their faith 
should prohibit them from participa-
tion in the public sphere. 
President Obama once spoke of work-
ing-class Americans as bitter individ-
uals who cling to their religion. Need-
less to say, he didn’t mean it in a posi-
tive way, but he should have. Many 
great Americans have clung to their re-
ligion and been inspired by it to do 
great things, from serving the needy to 
fighting for the oppressed. America has 
been made better by individuals who 
cling to their faith. 
I look forward to seeing the great 
things that are to come from religious 
Americans serving in the public square, 
and we can start by confirming the 
eminently qualified Amy Coney Bar-
rett to the Supreme Court. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the 
Constitution of the United 
States 
makes three references to religion. The 
First Amendment to the Bill of Rights 
says that we have the right to believe 
or not believe as a matter of personal 
conscience and, secondly, that there 
will be no established government reli-
gion in the United States. The only 
other provision is in article VI, where 
it expressly says there will be no reli-
gious test for public office—three sim-
ple assertions which for over 200 years 
have guided this Nation in dealing with 
religion. 
The statement just made by the Sen-
ator from South Dakota really tells me 
that he didn’t tune in to the hearings 
that were held just a week or two ago 
when it came to Amy Coney Barrett. I 
did. I was there for all 4 days, start to 
finish, with maybe 10 minutes that I 
stepped aside. So I know what was said 
and who said it, and I know what the 
Democrats said, and I didn’t believe 
there was one instance—not one— 
where any Democrat raised the issue of 
this nominee’s religion. We took seri-
ously what article VI says in the Con-
stitution: There is no religious test for 
office. 
I will state that on the other side of 
the aisle, there were frequent ref-
erences to her religion—express ref-
erences to her religion. That is their 
right as Senators to decide how they 
want to handle this issue. But the sug-
gestion that I heard from the Senator 
from South Dakota tells me he did not 
follow the hearing and he didn’t listen 
to it. Had he done so, he wouldn’t have 
made the statements that he just did 
on the floor. 
As a lifelong Catholic, I want to state 
that I have voted for Catholics to serve

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6388 
October 22, 2020 
on every court, both the Supreme 
Court and other courts in the land, and 
I have voted against some as well. I 
take the admonition of the Constitu-
tion seriously. I don’t take a person’s 
religion into account when I cast a 
vote when it comes to a judge, nor 
should anyone if they follow this Con-
stitution. 
One last point I would like to make 
that was clearly wrong: When it came 
to the scurrilous and disgusting at-
tacks on the adopted children of this 
nominee, the Senator from Louisiana 
spoke up against them, and so did I on 
the Democratic side. They are unac-
ceptable on either side of the aisle, and 
for any Senators to suggest otherwise 
tells me he did not listen to the hear-
ing itself. 
I condemn the attack on her family, 
and I repeat that condemnation on the 
floor of the Senate today. For that 
Senator to ignore that fact troubles me 
greatly. I count him as a friend. I hope 
when he reads the record of the actual 
proceedings before the Senate Judici-
ary Committee, he will come and clar-
ify and correct his remarks. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, the last point I 
want to make—and I know we have a 
vote in a few minutes—is this: If you 
ask the American people ‘‘What is the 
business of the Senate for the next 5 
days?’’ I don’t think anyone, if they 
follow it closely, would ever guess the 
business that we are about. 
We live in a country now where 
222,000 people have died from this 
COVID–19 pandemic—222,000. Eight mil-
lion have been affected. A country that 
represents 4.5 percent of the world’s 
population, the United States counts 
for 20 percent of all the COVID–19 
deaths in the world. Sadly, it is getting 
worse before it gets better. 
In the State of Illinois, the Governor 
announced yesterday that because of 
the increased incidence of infection 
from COVID–19 in the four major coun-
ties surrounding the city of Chicago, 
we have to close down restaurants and 
other 
establishments. 
It 
is 
heart-
breaking. I know what it means to 
these business owners. But it is also 
heartbreaking to read the numbers day 
in and day out of what this COVID–19 
virus is doing in America—not just to 
the poor hapless souls who are infected 
and some dying but to the economy of 
this country. 
Wouldn’t you think that would be the 
focus of business on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate? Wouldn’t you think that 
the Senate majority leader, Senator 
MCCONNELL from Kentucky, who con-
trols the business of the floor, would 
make that job one for all of us and 
stick together on a bipartisan basis to 
come up with an agreement before we 
did anything else? Well if you guessed 
that, you are wrong, because for the 
next 5 days, we will be consumed with 
filling one Supreme Court vacancy. He 
is determined to fill that vacancy at 
any cost, including ignoring the major 
issue of our time, the major issue of 
the moment—the pandemic, which af-
fects this country so gravely. 
We have lost 222,000 souls, sadly, in 
America, and it is estimated that it 
may reach half a million by January 1. 
What a heartbreak. And we are here 
spending 5 straight days not dealing 
with COVID–19 relief, not providing the 
testing that is needed, not providing 
unemployment benefits to those who 
lost jobs, not providing help to small 
businesses—no. We are focused on one 
nomination for one vacancy in the Su-
preme Court. As important as that 
may be in the ordinary scheme of 
things, we are not in the ordinary 
scheme of things. We are dealing with 
an extraordinary pandemic, which is 
causing grave damage to this country, 
to its families, and to our economy. 
The President may not take it seri-
ously. Obviously the Senate Repub-
licans don’t take it seriously. If they 
did, they would be engaged. 
I cannot explain or even imagine how 
he explains why Senator MCCONNELL 
refuses to sit down for the negotiations 
for COVID–19 relief. That is right. They 
have had negotiations that have in-
volved 
Senator 
SCHUMER, 
Speaker 
PELOSI, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, 
and the President’s Chief of Staff, and 
Senator MCCONNELL refuses to attend 
those negotiations where they are try-
ing to come up with a bipartisan meas-
ure to help us through this crisis. All 
he does is offer throwaway votes on the 
floor, take-it-or-leave-it votes on the 
floor that don’t have any bipartisan 
route to them. They come to us be-
cause he wants to have a symbolic roll-
call—a symbolic rollcall—for his Mem-
bers to take home and say: Well, I 
tried. 
No, you didn’t try. 
If for 5 straight days we do nothing 
about COVID–19 and focus exclusively 
on this nominee, how in the world will 
any Senator explain that was the 
American priority of the moment? It is 
not. The American priority of the mo-
ment is not this vacancy on the Su-
preme Court; it is the fact that there 
are vacancies in homes across America 
from 222,000 deaths in this country, and 
they continue apace every single day. 
We ought to be coming together on a 
bipartisan 
basis. 
The 
person 
who 
should be leading us in the Senate is 
the Senate Republican leader. He does 
not, and as a consequence, we waste 
our moments here when they should be 
spent helping America with its highest 
priority. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this 
morning, 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
voted Amy Coney Barrett out in viola-
tion of its rules. The rules of the Judi-
ciary Committee say, before you can 
vote a nominee to the floor, there must 
be two members of the minority. That 
has been obeyed by Democrats and Re-
publicans for a very long time. I re-
member it in existence for all of the 
years I was on the Judiciary. Yet, typ-
ical of this Republican majority, when 
there were not two Democrats there, 
they just steamrolled the nominee 
through in violation of the rules. That 
has been typical. This whole thing has 
been a steamroller operation of one of 
the most important appointments we 
can all make—weeks before a Presi-
dential election—of a nominee whose 
views, in the judgment of most Ameri-
cans, are far away on healthcare, on re-
productive rights, on labor unions, and 
on guns from where the average Amer-
ican is. 
It is a steamroller, and this was in 
violation of the rules, which is not sur-
prising given this rush to judgment— 
given this maniacal desire to get this 
nominee through before Americans 
vote. It is in violation of the rules. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. President, I make a point of 
order that the Barrett nomination 
should not be placed on the Executive 
Calendar because it was reported in 
violation of the rules of the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
nomination was reported in accordance 
with the Standing Rules of the Senate. 
The point of order is not sustained. 
APPEAL RULING OF THE CHAIR 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ap-
peal the ruling of the Chair and ask for 
the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There is a sufficient second. 
The yeas and nays are ordered. 
The question is on the appeal of the 
ruling of the Chair. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk

The

The 
Chair wants to be clear about the ques-
tion before the body.

of the Chair stand as the judgment of 
the Senate? 
The clerk will continue to call the 
roll.

NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
spent some one-on-one time yesterday 
with Amy Coney Barrett. I had the op-
portunity to be able to ask her ques-
tions about agency deference, about re-
ligious liberty, and about the responsi-
bility of the three branches of govern-
ment and the separation of those. We 
spent time talking about antitrust 
laws, Tribal laws, and all sorts of 
things to walk through some things 
that were not covered in the hearing 
time. 
I walked away even more impressed 
with her as a leader, her knowledge, 
her judicial temperament, her sense of 
responsibility, the awe that she is tak-
ing on this responsibility that the Na-
tion would ask her to do. 
It stands in stark contrast to some of 
the conversations I have had with some 
of my colleagues on the other side and 
from the hearings over the last week 
where, most of the time, my colleagues 
spent their time saying that people 
should be afraid of this mother of 
seven, that she is a terrifying indi-
vidual 
who 
will 
take 
away 
your 
healthcare, who will take away your 
right to be able to destroy your unborn 
child if you choose to, that she is racist 
and that she is anti-woman, which I 
thought were the ultimate challenges 
to her as a woman herself, obviously, 
and when she was challenged over and 
over again about being a racist and a 
segregationist. She is the mother of a 
multiracial family. 
It is a bizarre side-by-side to actually 
meet the actual person and to go 
through the law versus hearing the de-
scriptions. 
Amy Coney Barrett is a native of 
New Orleans, LA. She is the daughter 
of a lawyer and a teacher, the oldest of 
seven children. She has been married 
to her husband Jesse for 21 years. She 
herself is the mother of seven children, 
as I mentioned before—Emma, Vivian, 
Tess, John Peter, Liam, Juliet, and 
Benjamin. We got to watch them sit-
ting behind her, quietly watching, 
proudly, their mom. 
She graduated summa cum laude 
from Notre Dame Law School. After 
graduating 
from 
law 
school, 
she 
clerked for DC Circuit Judge Laurence 
Silberman and for Supreme Court Jus-
tice Antonin Scalia. She was chal-
lenged over and over again, with people 
saying: You are just like Scalia. She 
kept responding very calmly to people: 
‘‘I have my own mind.’’ She practiced 
both trial and appellate litigation. 
Judge Barrett also worked for more 
than 15 years in academia. She was a 
distinguished 
legal 
scholar 
at 
the 
Notre Dame Law School, the Univer-
sity of Virginia School of Law, and 
George Washington University Law 
School. She published articles in the

October 22, 2020 
Columbia, Virginia, Texas, and Cornell 
law reviews. Three graduating classes 
at Notre Dame Law have selected 
Judge Barrett as the Distinguished 
Professor of the Year. 
In 2017, she was nominated by Presi-
dent Trump to serve on the Seventh 
Circuit Court of Appeals and was con-
firmed by this Senate with a bipartisan 
vote. Judge Barrett’s colleagues at 
Notre Dame signed a letter supporting 
her 2017 nomination, calling her ‘‘a 
model of the fair, impartial and sympa-
thetic judge.’’ Since joining the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Cir-
cuit in 2017, Judge Barrett has partici-
pated in over 600 cases. 
The ABA Standing Committee issued 
Judge Barrett a ‘‘well qualified’’ rating 
based on ‘‘the qualities of integrity, 
professional competence, and judicial 
temperament.’’ 
When confirmed, Justice Barrett will 
be the fifth woman to serve on the Su-
preme Court in its history. She will be 
the first mother of school-age children 
to serve on the Court. She will be the 
only sitting member of the Court to 
have graduated from a law school other 
than Harvard or Yale. She will also be 
the second sitting member of the Court 
to have been born in the South and 
only the second member in the Court’s 
history to have been born in Louisiana. 
She will be the only sitting member of 
the Court to have served on the Sev-
enth Circuit, which hears cases arising 
out of Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. 
During 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
hearings, we heard testimony from 
Laura Wolk, a former student of Judge 
Barrett’s. It was remarkable testi-
mony. 
She said, in part: 
[S]hould you confirm Amy Barrett, the 
country will receive something far greater 
than simply an unparalleled legal mind. The 
Supreme Court—and therefore all Ameri-
cans—will gain the service of one of the 
kindest individuals I have ever known. Her 
brilliance is matched only by her compas-
sion, and her honesty is beyond reproach. 
I do not speak in mere abstractions. Rath-
er, I have experienced these characteristics 
firsthand, with life-changing results. . . . 
Judge Barrett described a mentor who gave 
her a treasured book of literature to com-
memorate their relationship. Judge Barrett 
has now passed that torch onto me, giving 
me a gift of immeasurable value: the ability 
to pursue an abundant life with the potential 
to break down barriers so that I can leave 
this world a better place than I found it. 
I could not agree more with her or 
with her colleagues and peers about her 
superb qualifications and preparedness 
to serve in this role. As an originalist 
and a textualist, her commitment to 
both the role of the Court and the rule 
of law are clear. To read her opinions 
from the perspective of the losing 
party demonstrates her fairness, her 
empathy, and her temperament as a 
judge. 
Beyond her resume and accolades, 
her character, her commitment to 
faith and family, and her service to her 
students and the community should 
not go overlooked. Judge Barrett has 
my unqualified, full support, and I look 
forward to voting for her nomination 
in the next few days. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). The Senator from Maryland. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1060 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
every day we see more Americans 
dying from COVID–19 and more Ameri-
cans contracting this virus. As of 
today, we have hit the awful mark of 
over 
220,000 
Americans 
dead 
from 
COVID–19, the highest death level in 
the entire world, and, with that, we are 
also experiencing the economic fallout 
and pain that has come with it. 
It did not have to be this way. Presi-
dent Trump knew about this deadly 
virus early on, and he could have and 
should have acted. But even at this mo-
ment, there are things that this U.S. 
Senate can be doing to both stop the 
spread of the virus and ease the eco-
nomic pain. We could be taking up and 
voting on the legislation that passed 
the House of Representatives called the 
Heroes Act, which is a comprehensive 
emergency 
relief 
package 
for 
the 
American people—both addressing test-
ing and contact tracing and other 
issues to stop the spread of the virus 
and providing essential economic relief 
to American families, workers, and 
businesses that are struggling from the 
fallout. 
But we haven’t even had a chance to 
vote on that bill here in the U.S. Sen-
ate. The Heroes Act was passed by the 
House more than 5 months ago, and 
then, recently, the House passed a re-
vised version called Heroes 2.0. We 
tried to get a vote on that just this 
past Tuesday here in the U.S. Senate. 
It was blocked by the Republican lead-
er, Senator MCCONNELL, and here we 
have 12 days to go until the election. 
Instead of focusing on that relief, we 
are trying to rush through and use an 
illegitimate process to put another 
Justice on the Court. 
But there is something else that we 
should also be doing now instead of 
rushing a Justice on the Court, in addi-
tion to the Heroes Act, and that is de-
fending the integrity of our democratic 
process and the integrity of our elec-
tions. 
That is what brings me to the floor 
today because we have, of course, a few 
days to go—12 days, to be exact—to get 
to the election. Yet it has been years— 
not just 1 year, not just 2 years, not 
just 3 years—years when some of us 
have been pushing to enact legislation 
here to defend against foreign inter-
ference in our elections—Russian inter-
ference, which we have known about 
since 2016, and interference from other 
adversaries. 
So, yesterday, we heard from the Di-
rector of National Intelligence that 
there are foreign actors interfering in 
our elections and attempting to disrupt 
our process—Russia and Iran. Well, the 
question for the U.S. Senate is not the 
issue of whether we were going to have 
foreign interference. The question for 
the U.S. Senate is, Why did we sit back 
and do nothing about it for 3 years—for 
3 years? 
Senator RUBIO and I introduced a bi-
partisan bill. It is called the DETER 
Act, which is very straightforward. It 
says that if we catch Russia and Putin 
interfering in our elections again, 
there will be automatic, swift sanc-
tions, so if you are Vladimir Putin and 
you are thinking about interfering in 
our elections, you will know there will 
be a certain price to pay. Right now, it 
is cost-free to the Russians and cost- 
free to other adversaries. 
Our bill called for the executive 
branch to put together a plan to re-
spond and establish upfront penalties 
not just for Russian interference but 
for interference from any adversary. 
That is the way you deter interference 
in the first place. You can’t stop inter-
ference if there is no cost to be borne 
by the adversary seeking to disrupt 
your process. That is pretty simple. 
We have used the idea and concept of 
deterrence in many other cases to try 
to keep the peace. Yet, here we are, 
talking about safeguarding our democ-
racy by putting in place a very simple 
mechanism to say to anyone who 
wants to undermine faith in the demo-
cratic process or support a particular 
candidate—as Russia did in 2016 and as 
they have worked to do over the last 
couple of years in favor of President 
Trump—to put in place a process where 
they know if they get caught, they will 
be punished, and I don’t mean pun-
ishing a few oligarchs. I am not talking 
about punishing a few bureaucrats who 
may be responsible for actually doing 
the disruption, but creating penalties 
on the Russian economy—the banking 
sector, the energy sector—because we 
all know that you don’t have Russian 
bureaucrats and intelligence officials 
interfere in our elections without the 
green light from the very top, and that 
is true of other adversaries who seek to 
interfere in our elections. 
So the real question is, Why do we 
continue to see stonewalling on this 
simple 
legislation? 
Why 
does 
the 
Trump administration continue to op-
pose it? And why doesn’t the Senate do 
its job as an independent body, sup-
posedly, to protect the integrity of our 
elections? 
Here is what President Trump said 
just a few years ago in Helsinki when 
he was side by side with President 
Putin. President Trump said: 
My people came to me—Dan Coats came to 
me and some others—they said they think 
it’s Russia. I have President Putin; he just 
said it’s not Russia. 
I will say this: I don’t see any reason why 
it would be. . . . I have confidence in both 
parties. 
Then he went on to say: 
I have great confidence in my intelligence 
people, but I will tell you that President 
Putin was extremely strong and powerful in 
his denial today. 
This was years ago, yet we hear from 
our intelligence officials that Russia is 
still interfering. We heard that just 
yesterday and that other adversaries 
are interfering.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6391 
October 22, 2020 
But the Trump administration didn’t 
want to do a damn thing about it, and, 
unfortunately, this body has been 
complicit 
in 
doing 
nothing—doing 
nothing—to seriously protect the in-
tegrity of our elections. We have to 
keep asking ourselves the question why 
we would leave ourselves defenseless. 
The only thing you can keep going 
back to are these continuing state-
ments by President Trump talking 
about how he respects his friendship 
with Vladimir Putin and President 
Trump’s actions time and again favor-
ing the Russian position. 
We have a last-minute opportunity 
here. There are 12 days to go before our 
election. Let us, finally, in light of the 
information we got yesterday and the 
information we have gotten on a 
monthly basis, let us, as the U.S. Sen-
ate, at least say today: If we catch you, 
Russia, if we catch you, Iran, we don’t 
care who you are, if you are an adver-
sary interfering in our elections, there 
will be a price to pay. 
That was a bipartisan idea more than 
2 years ago. We still get a lot of lip-
service in favor of it here on a bipar-
tisan basis. But when it comes to actu-
ally doing something about it and hold-
ing a vote, time and again we are de-
nied that opportunity. 
What is interesting is when this issue 
came up just last year as part of the 
national defense authorization bill, we 
had a motion on this floor to instruct 
the conferees from the House and the 
Senate that as part of the Defense au-
thorization bill, we thought it was im-
portant to also protect our democracy 
from interference. We said that you 
should include a provision like the 
DETER Act. But as soon as that got 
behind closed doors, there was a furi-
ous effort by the Republican Senate 
leader and the Trump administration 
to prevent that from happening. I had 
numerous conversations with my col-
league from the House side, the chair-
man of the Armed Services Committee, 
and it was opposed by the administra-
tion and opposed by the Republican 
Senate. 
So here we are. Nobody should be 
surprised by what we heard yesterday. 
The surprise for the American people 
has got to be: Why the hell didn’t we do 
anything about this for 3 years? We 
brought everybody together after 2016. 
I remember we lined up all the intel-
ligence officials, including recent ap-
pointees by President Trump, and they 
all told us what had happened in 2016. 
Everybody said we are going to work 
really hard to stop it from happening 
in 2020. Yet one thing that we could do 
to make it clear upfront that there 
would be a price to pay, we have not 
done. Shame on the U.S. Senate for not 
moving forward. 
There are 12 days left. The clock is 
ticking. Let’s finally take action so at 
least our adversaries will know that 
there will be a price to pay if they con-
tinue in these final 12 days to try to 
interfere in our election process. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 1060, the 
DETER Act, and the Senate proceed to 
its immediate consideration. I further 
ask unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and 
passed, and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, this morning the 
Senate Judiciary Committee reported 
out Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s nomi-
nation to the U.S. Supreme Court. I 
was proud to vote for her in com-
mittee. 
Unfortunately, my friends on the 
other side of the aisle decided to boy-
cott the executive session. In addition, 
each day, the Democratic leader has 
attempted to adjourn the Senate. 
They say that the Senate should not 
be working on the nomination of Amy 
Coney Barrett, and that it is delaying 
work on COVID relief. Now we hear 
today that we are delaying work and 
not even engaging in any response to 
the election interference that we knew 
4 years ago occurred and which, as my 
colleague said, nobody should be sur-
prised that we heard again that there 
are efforts on election interference by 
Russia, by Iran, and others. 
Yesterday, there were three different 
live unanimous consent requests like 
this to bypass committees and imme-
diately pass legislation without debate 
or amendments. These motions to ad-
journ and take-it-or-leave-it requests 
are a fight over the Senate floor sched-
ule rather than building the necessary 
bipartisan support to pass needed legis-
lation. 
We are told that we haven’t done 
anything for 4 years, turning to focus 
specifically on the question of election 
interference. The reality is that we 
have already signed into law the Coun-
tering America’s Adversaries Through 
Sanctions 
Act—or 
CAATSA—the 
BRINK Act; the Hong Kong Autonomy 
Act that substantially expanded sanc-
tions on Russia, North Korea, and 
China; and the White House, in addi-
tion, has taken steps to use its IEEPA 
authority to impose additional tar-
geted sanctions on those who at-
tempted to interfere in the U.S. elec-
tion. 
We are told we aren’t doing anything 
to work on the COVID relief package. 
My colleague from Maryland men-
tioned that they tried to pass the He-
roes Act here in the Senate through a 
similar tactic that we are seeing today 
with regard to the DETER Act. What 
he didn’t point out was that twice we 
have tried to bring forward a $500 bil-
lion COVID relief package on the floor 
of this Senate only to have the effort 
to even move to the bill rejected by our 
colleagues on the other side. And we 
tried to bring forward the PPP Act just 
2 days ago, only to have that act 
stopped by our colleagues on the other 
side of the Senate who now tell us that 
we aren’t trying to pass legislation to 
help deal with COVID relief. 
The reality is that we won’t accept— 
without debate or amendment—their 
take-it-or-leave-it proposals, and we 
need to get a bill on the floor to start 
dealing with these things. 
Let’s go back to election interference 
because I found it just remarkable that 
the claim is made that when we passed 
major legislation—with over 90 Sen-
ators on this floor voting for it—that 
put specific sanction authority and 
sanctions on Russia for election inter-
ference, for its aggression in Crimea, 
and for its other aggressive behavior 
around 
the 
globe—particularly 
its 
cyber security violations—and we have 
been implementing sanctions for that 
entire period of time. I just want to re-
view a little bit of it. 
On top of it, as I indicated, the Presi-
dent has used his IEEPA authority for 
additional 
sanctions 
activity. 
The 
President signed an Executive order 
that allows for sanctions on any nation 
or individual who authorizes, directs, 
or sponsors interference in our elec-
tions. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act, signed by the President last year, 
included numerous provisions designed 
to strengthen our deterrence against 
foreign interference. 
The President has taken a strong 
stand against Russia for its malign ac-
tivities, including imposing sanctions 
on more than 300 separate Russian-re-
lated targets through 32 distinct ac-
tions; imposing sanctions against 7 
Russian oligarchs, their 12 companies 
and 17 senior Russian government offi-
cials; establishing rolling designations 
to strengthen sanctions in response to 
Russian aggression against Ukraine 
and Russian efforts to evade sanctions 
on North Korea, Syria, Iran, and oth-
ers; imposing sanctions against 16 enti-
ties and individuals, including affili-
ates of the Russian Internet Research 
Agency for their roles in Russian inter-
ference in our elections; imposing sanc-
tions against three individuals and five 
entities in Sudan assisting the IRA fin-
ancier, 
Prigozhin, 
in 
evading 
pre-
viously imposed sanctions; designating 
three additional IRA actors for sup-
porting the IRA’s crypto currency ac-
counts; imposing sanctions on Russian- 
related oil brokers for their role in as-
sisting the circumvention of sanctions 
against Venezuela; expelling 60 Russian 
intelligence officers from the United 
States. And the list goes on. The argu-
ment that this administration and this 
Senate have done nothing is simply 
false. 
Let’s just talk a little more about 
election interference. The administra-
tion here, domestically, has taken un-
precedented action to bolster the secu-
rity of our elections and to counter for-
eign 
malign 
influence. 
President 
Trump signed into legislation passed 
by this Senate that spent more than 
$1.2 billion in the States for election

security, infrastructure strengthening, 
and technological enhancements. 
The President funded the formation 
of the Election Infrastructure Informa-
tion Sharing and Analysis Center, a 
center which helps share security in-
formation with elected officials across 
all 50 States and more than 2,400 local 
and territorial electoral offices. 
The administration has conducted 
hundreds of cyber security assessments 
at no cost to election officials and pro-
vides vulnerability reports on a weekly 
basis. 
The administration has traveled the 
country to hold exercises in training 
with State and local election officials 
and their private sector partners to im-
prove and test their ability to prepare 
for and respond to cyber incidents. 
The administration has held multiple 
national-level 
tabletop-to-vote 
exer-
cises with thousands of State and local 
election officials and private sector 
partners nationwide. 
The administration has provided tai-
lored security guidance to nearly 6,000 
local election jurisdictions. 
Under President Trump, the adminis-
tration has pushed to increase the se-
curity of elections through auditable 
paper ballots, and now more than 92 
percent of the voters in the general 
election will cast their ballots with an 
auditable paper record. 
I could go on and on about this, but 
the bottom line is, yes, we do need to 
work and continue to be alert—and my 
colleague from Maryland knows that I 
am willing to work on these issues— 
but we can’t just continue to have 
these 
take-it-or-leave-it, 
no-amend-
ment, no-opportunity-for-change unan-
imous consent requests in the context 
of the obstruction effort being under-
taken right now to try to delay and 
interfere with a vote on Amy Coney 
Barrett. 
We can work on all of these issues. I 
invite my colleagues on the other side 
to vote yes the next time we try to 
bring a COVID relief bill to the floor. 
Because of these reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague for the comments, 
but to suggest that this is a fight over 
the schedule and not an effort to pro-
tect our elections from what we know 
is an ongoing and continuing imminent 
threat, I believe, misses the point en-
tirely. 
He mentioned that this is a take-it- 
or-leave-it proposition. I would suggest 
that the Senate has already taken this 
because we voted unanimously last 
year, as part of the Defense authoriza-
tion bill, to adopt this provision as 
part of our national defense to defend 
our democracy. Every single Senator 
voted—or no one came forward to ob-
ject at that time. Yet here we are 12 
days out from election, no action 
taken. We get this report yesterday 
about foreign interference, and nobody 
should say: Oh, we are shocked there is 
foreign interference in our election 
going on. The shocking thing is we 
haven’t done enough. 
I appreciate him listing some of the 
actions the administration took about 
particular 
Russian 
individuals, 
oligarchs, but as you know, and as we 
know, the DETER Act is not aimed at 
just punishing particular bureaucrats 
and apparatchiks who are obeying the 
orders of President Putin. The whole 
idea is to deter President Putin by 
making him understand that he and his 
country will pay a price if they inter-
fere by sanctions on the banking sector 
and on the all-important energy sector 
in Russia. 
In order to stop interference, we need 
to do two things: We need to harden 
our systems at home. My colleague 
mentioned some of the actions that 
have been taken to do that. I will re-
mind my colleagues that Democrats 
put forward the proposal for more re-
sources for State and local govern-
ments to harden those defenses, and it 
was only after a big fight and lots of 
opposition from the Republican leader 
here in the Senate that we were able to 
get those funds. Additional funds have 
been sitting in the Heroes Act which 
passed the House 5 months ago and yet 
nothing. 
In the proposal put forward the other 
day by the Republican leader, there 
was no more money to harden our de-
fenses. But hardening our defenses is 
not enough. What you want to do is 
prevent the attacks in the first place, 
prevent the interference in the first 
place. And so long as that is cost-free 
to Vladimir Putin or any other adver-
sary, they are going to go for it. They 
have got nothing to lose. They have 
got everything to gain by sowing more 
unrest and lack of confidence here. 
So the way to deal with that is the 
DETER Act. And the Senate agreed, at 
least with that unanimous vote a little 
while ago, and then nothing happened. 
Yet, we got report after report from 
our intelligence community that—no 
surprise—we have this ongoing inter-
ference. 
The Senator mentioned all these ac-
tions the Trump administration has 
taken. 
Obviously, 
Vladimir 
Putin 
didn’t get the message. He didn’t get 
the message. Taking pinprick actions 
after the fact isn’t going to scare off 
Vladimir Putin or any of our adver-
saries. The only way to get them to 
focus and stop interfering is to say 
now, up front, that if you cross this 
wire, if you trip this threshold and 
interfere in our elections in certain 
substantial ways, it is going to hurt— 
not just somebody in the bowels of 
your bureaucracy or one intelligence 
officer or five or ten, but it is going to 
hurt, and you are going to feel the pain 
in your country. 
So I must say I remain incredibly 
disappointed that, even at this late 
hour, we are unwilling, as a body, to 
take this very important action, just 
as we have been unwilling to act on the 
Heroes Act, both the first version and 
the second version. 
I think, as my colleagues know, the 
Democratic leader has proposed that 
we adjourn subject to being called back 
for the purpose of acting on a bipar-
tisan agreement, which we would all 
like to see, on a COVID–19 response bill 
but something which the Republican 
Senate leader has said he is unwilling 
to pursue, even the contours of an 
agreement that have been discussed be-
tween Speaker PELOSI and the adminis-
tration. The majority leader continues 
to block that, and we continue to see 
today blocking a measure to protect 
our democracy with 12 days to go be-
fore November 3. 
So, again, I think we are going to rue 
the day that we weren’t clear, up front, 
that the United States is going to 
stand up and protect its democratic 
process. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, just to 
briefly respond. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, first of 
all, the notion that there has been 
blockage of a deal on this side is news 
to me. The notion that we did not ac-
cept the Heroes Act from the House is 
not news. Trying to put the Heroes Act 
on the floor of the Senate without the 
opportunity for debate or amendment 
is also not the right way to try to build 
bipartisan legislation for a deal. 
I also find it incredible that this ad-
ministration’s 
actions 
sanctioning 
Russia are considered to be a pinprick 
in comparison to whatever greater 
sledgehammer is supposedly needed. 
The CAATSA legislation that I ref-
erenced, which was passed in the first 
year following the election of Presi-
dent Trump, which President Trump 
signed and supported, was a massive in-
crease in American sanction authority 
against Russia—and North Korea, by 
the way—and has been utilized more by 
this President than any sanction au-
thority that any other President has 
ever had. The sanction regime that we 
are putting in place today against Rus-
sia is designed to go aggressively at 
election interference. The argument 
that nobody is doing anything is sim-
ply wrong. 
Now, I stand ready to work to build 
even stronger sanction regimes that 
can work without destroying our own 
economy or work without destroying 
our own industry in different sectors, 
which is part of the problem with the 
bill that is being proposed without 
amendment here today. But we need to 
recognize that the accusations that 
this administration and this Senate do 
not take election interference seri-
ously when we passed the most signifi-
cant, sweeping legislation that has 
ever been passed in this country to deal 
with it—and that there is no effort to 
try to work on the COVID relief pack-
age—is just part of, frankly, the polit-
ical attack of the day. 
I am sorry. This is simply wrong. If 
we want to work together on either of 
these two issues or other issues, we can

on this floor, but we can’t do it by 
these kinds of motions to adjourn and 
unanimous consent requests to bring 
bills to the floor and pass them with-
out amendment. It is just not the way. 
And my colleague knows this is the 
kind of thing that Republicans and 
Democrats do. They want to bring at-
tention to their legislation. But that is 
not the way you build a bipartisan 
agreement that can actually become 
law. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
will be very brief in response. 
This is a bipartisan bill. It has bipar-
tisan cosponsorship. We have been 
working for 3 years. We have made 
changes. And the proof that everything 
we are doing right now is not working 
is the fact that we just had the DNI say 
we continue to have Russian inter-
ference and other interference in our 
election. That is why we have to do 
something. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I have 
enjoyed the colloquy here between our 
colleagues on election interference. I 
am privileged to serve on the Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence that 
has undertaken a 31⁄2-year-long inves-
tigation of the election interference 
that occurred in 2016, and I think the 
five-volume report of the Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence—bipartisan re-
port—is indicative of the seriousness 
with which we all treat this subject. 
But I appreciate the Senator from 
Idaho, the chairman of the Banking 
Committee, for his comments, for re-
freshing all of our memories about the 
huge amounts of money that we have 
spent in assistance to State and local 
election authorities, as well as the 
good work being done by the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security to help 
them secure their networks against 
cyber attacks, as well as other ele-
ments of the U.S. Government, includ-
ing our intelligence community, the 
National Security Agency, and others. 
This is important work, but I agree 
with him—this is not how we actually 
build bipartisan consensus here, by 
coming and asking for unanimous con-
sent without going through the appro-
priate procedures and, frankly, the 
hard work that it takes to build con-
sensus. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. President, on another matter, 
today the Senate Judiciary Committee 
advanced the nomination of Judge 
Amy Coney Barrett to serve on the Su-
preme Court. 
Throughout her hearing last week, 
Judge Barrett wowed America and cer-
tainly my constituents in Texas with 
her impressive knowledge of the law 
and her clear understanding about the 
limited but important role that judges 
play in our Republic. 
She followed the precedent set down 
by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the so-called 
Ginsburg rule, and refrained from an-
swering questions on how she would 
rule in future cases or commenting on 
contentious political issues. I think she 
was correct to do so. We shouldn’t em-
broil judges in the political controver-
sies that we debate here. Judges are 
not policymakers, primarily. They are 
certainly not accountable to the vot-
ers. They have lifetime tenure. That is 
why their responsibilities are limited 
but important at the same time. Nor 
by asking her questions back in 2017 
about her religious beliefs, whether she 
is an orthodox Catholic, having to lis-
ten to statements like ‘‘Well, the 
dogma lives loudly within you’’ be-
cause she is a woman of faith, sug-
gesting that somehow she would vio-
late her oath as a judge and impose her 
own views instead of the law from the 
role—from the bench. 
Well, I think Judge Barrett took all 
of us to school a little bit and reminded 
us very clearly that it is a judge’s job 
to impartially apply the law as writ-
ten, whether it is the Constitution 
itself or the laws that Congress passes. 
She not only stated her commitment 
to this most basic principle, but she 
also has a record to back it up. During 
her time on the Seventh Circuit Court 
of Appeals, Judge Barrett has sided 
with her colleagues 95 percent of the 
time in more than 600 cases. 
It is no surprise that the American 
Bar Association, which the minority 
leader has called the gold standard, 
gave Judge Barrett its highest rating, 
saying she is well qualified to serve on 
the Supreme Court. But we all knew 
that. 
As I looked around the room during 
the first day of questioning, I noticed 
all the binders that people like me and 
my other colleagues had—notebooks, 
piles of paper, books, reference books 
on both the desks of Republican and 
Democratic 
members 
of 
the 
com-
mittee. If my colleagues’ materials 
preparing for this historic hearing were 
anything like mine, they included pre-
vious decisions by Judge Barrett, aca-
demic writings, letters of support, and 
detailed background information about 
her career. 
But I noted that, as Judge Barrett 
was 
answering 
our 
questions, 
she 
seemed to be doing so without even 
glancing down at any notes. So I asked 
Judge Barrett—I violated the No. 1 rule 
that you learn as a lawyer not to ask a 
question you don’t know the answer to. 
I did it anyway because I had a hunch. 
I asked her to hold up the notepad sit-
ting in front of her to show us what 
materials she had been using during 
the hearing. It was a memorable mo-
ment. She held it up and smiled, and it 
was blank. I think that spoke volumes 
about her competency, her preparation, 
her intelligence—all things that would 
commend her confirmation. 
Well, with each question she an-
swered, Judge Barrett demonstrated 
her vast knowledge of the law. She 
made clear she understood, as I said, 
the limited role of judges, and she 
showed compassion and heart as she 
poured herself into her work each and 
every day. 
Numerous Senators have noted that, 
under ordinary circumstances, a nomi-
nee like this would get overwhelming 
support, but unfortunately these aren’t 
normal circumstances. Our colleagues 
on the other side made clear from the 
get-go that, for them, this confirma-
tion process wasn’t even about the 
nominee or her qualifications. They at-
tempted to hijack the hearing and use 
it for—well, it is a harsh word, but it is 
true—fearmongering. 
Last week’s hearing was like split- 
screen TV. On one half, Republican 
Senators asked the judge about her ju-
dicial philosophy, prior rulings, and a 
range of constitutional doctrines. On 
the other half, our Democratic col-
leagues delivered monologues about 
ObamaCare—about a future case that 
she may be called upon to participate 
in. They attempted to convince the 
American people that if she was con-
firmed, she would somehow take away 
their healthcare. Well, that is, at bot-
tom, an insult to the judge. It somehow 
presumes that she is essentially audi-
tioning for the job based on her ruling 
in a future case. That would violate 
every aspect of a judge’s oath. 
As Judge Barrett noted, judges don’t 
make policy pronouncements; they de-
cide cases. And she very carefully de-
scribed the case that is pending in 
front of the Supreme Court. It is not 
about ObamaCare writ large; it is 
about a technical doctrine called sever-
ability: If one part of a statute is 
deemed unconstitutional—and this one, 
I believe, is, the individual mandate, 
because we zeroed out the penalty 
under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—the 
question is, Does the rest of the legisla-
tion—does 
the 
rest 
of 
ObamaCare 
stand, or does it all have to be struck 
down? 
Well, she noted that there had been a 
number of cases decided recently by 
the 
current 
Supreme 
Court 
that 
seemed to treat severability with par-
ticular care. Indeed, as a scholastic, as 
an academic, I think she and others 
noted that it is not exactly appropriate 
for judges to go out and strike down 
statutes except to the extent that they 
are unconstitutional. 
They said: If she is not coming for 
your healthcare, she will serve cor-
porate interests, destroy the environ-
ment, somehow chip away at our lib-
erties. 
These are nothing but baseless scare 
tactics and stunts from our Democratic 
colleagues. The latest one came this 
morning, when they actually boycotted 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
vote 
on 
Judge Barrett. They couldn’t even be 
bothered to show up and vote against 
the nominee they claim is a threat to 
our democracy. So do you know what? 
Judge Barrett was confirmed unani-
mously by the Senators present today. 
Instead, in their chairs, they had 
large photographs, much like we have 
seen at sports arenas and ballparks in 
the wake of the pandemic, since we 
have had to socially distance. You 
can’t have a large crowd at the ball-
park. So people have these cutouts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6394 
October 22, 2020 
That is what it looked like in the Judi-
ciary Committee today. 
As I said, because of their antics, be-
cause of this stunt, Senator GRAHAM 
asked for unanimous consent to pro-
ceed with the markup, and, of course, 
there was no objection because any po-
tential objector had voluntarily ab-
sented themself. 
The truth of the matter is, Judge 
Barrett’s qualifications speak louder 
than the unsubstantiated claims made 
by her opposition. She graduated at the 
top of her class from Notre Dame Law 
School. She held two prestigious clerk-
ships, including on the Supreme Court. 
She has litigated in the trenches before 
transitioning into academia, where she 
wrote and taught constitutional law, 
about our Federal courts and statutory 
interpretation. And, as I said, for the 
last 3 years, she has put all of that 
great experience and training to work 
on the Seventh Circuit. 
This is an exceptional judge with a 
clear record of faithfully and impar-
tially applying the law, and she will 
bring additional value to the U.S. Su-
preme Court. 
One of the things I thought was so re-
markable is that Judge Barrett is also 
an incredible role model. I think her 
elevation to the highest Court in the 
land should be an encouragement to 
young women who aspire to profes-
sional success and as a great role 
model on how to balance what we all 
try to figure out how to balance, which 
is your professional and your personal 
life. She and her husband do a mar-
velous job with their seven children, 
both being full-time professionals. 
If confirmed, she would be the first 
mother of school-aged children to serve 
as a Justice and only the fifth woman 
to serve on the high Court. She would 
also be the first Justice on the current 
Court with a degree from a law school 
other than Yale and Harvard and bring 
much needed educational diversity to 
the bench. 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett will serve 
our country well on the high Court, 
and I have full faith in her ability to 
faithfully and impartially apply the 
law as written. 
I want to thank Chairman GRAHAM 
for leading a fair and respectful hear-
ing. The ranking member, Senator 
FEINSTEIN, made that observation, and 
I thought that was very generous and 
civil of her. I would note that many of 
the more radical folks on the left have 
attacked Senator FEINSTEIN for her ci-
vility, and they are just wrong. I think 
she remains a good role model for all of 
us. We can have our disagreements 
without being rude or uncivil or dis-
agreeable. I think Senator FEINSTEIN is 
a model for that. 
I 
am 
proud 
to 
support 
Judge 
Barrett’s nomination in the Judiciary 
Committee, and I look forward to vot-
ing for her next week on the Senate 
floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, there 
are a lot of inscriptions—famous words, 
inspirational 
sayings—that 
are 
de-
tailed into and painted onto the walls 
of the Capitol. One of my favorites, 
which I think also happens to be one of 
the shortest, adorns a wall, I believe, 
on the way into the House Chamber. 
The saying is attributed to Alexander 
Hamilton, and it reads, simply: Here, 
Sir, People Govern. 
Here, Sir, People Govern. It is pur-
poseful that that quote finds its way 
onto the walls of the Capitol Building 
because this is the branch of govern-
ment that is given primacy by our 
Founders. It is no coincidence that we 
are the article I branch. Governing— 
the process of setting the rules by 
which the country lives—is supposed to 
happen here, in the article I branch, 
the elected wing of American democ-
racy. 
But as all of my colleagues know, 
there has been very little governing 
here happening of late. This Congress— 
this Senate—has been effectively dead. 
Here in the Senate, half the normal 
bills have been passed during this Con-
gress, compared to normal years, and 
nearly one-third of that legislation 
that we have finished has just been re-
naming postal buildings or authorizing 
commemorative coins. In fact, over the 
last 2 years, the Senate has spent floor 
time on a grand total of 20—20—pieces 
of legislation that weren’t routine or 
emergency spending measures. That is 
less than one bill a month. We are get-
ting paid $170,000 a year to work on one 
substantive piece of legislation every 
30 days. 
Now, perhaps you could intellectu-
ally reconcile this legislative desert if 
there were no problems to solve in 
America, if not a single major change 
in law was necessary. That, of course, 
is not the case. A pandemic disease has 
killed 
over 
200,000 
Americans. 
An 
opioid crisis that rages largely un-
checked took another 70,000 lives last 
year, just in drug overdoses alone. One 
out of 10 Americans are out of work 
today. Wildfires and hurricanes and 
droughts, caused by a man-made warm-
ing of the planet, ravage our landscape. 
No, there are really big problems that 
need to be solved—deadly problems, ex-
istential problems. 
I keep searching for the reason that 
no legislation is happening here, espe-
cially since the Senate does actually 
seem to be doing something. I mean, I 
am here voting most weekdays. So we 
must not be totally out of business. No, 
in fact, the Senate has been doing 
something, and that something is con-
firming judges to a record number of 
vacancies in the Federal court system. 
Those record vacancies were created 
by Senator MCCONNELL, who refused— 
refused—to confirm any judicial nomi-
nees, including to the Supreme Court, 
during President Obama’s final 2 years 
in office. And the primary reason that 
Senator MCCONNELL has stopped pass-
ing legislation and has turned this in-
stitution into a judge-confirming sim-
ple machine is because the modern Re-
publican Party currently owns a policy 
agenda that is about as popular as a 
pair of wet socks. 
More people without health insur-
ance and higher rates? Nobody wants 
that. Easier access for dark money to 
influence Congress? Not very popular. 
Less regulation of financial companies 
and polluters? No, few people out there 
are clamoring for that. The criminal-
ization 
of 
abortion? 
Not 
a 
big 
groundswell in America. The elimi-
nation of the firearms background 
check system? Yes, pretty much every-
body hates that idea too. 
You see, no parts of that agenda can 
actually pass Congress. Certainly not 
now, with Democrats in charge of the 
House. But they couldn’t even get it 
done when they had control of the Sen-
ate, the House, and the White House. 
They spent months trying to repeal the 
Affordable Care Act, for instance, but 
because Republicans figured out that 
they would all lose their seats if they 
repealed the law, they gave up and 
walked away. 
Frankly, they gave up on it all, not 
just because they feared the electoral 
backlash—no, also because they found 
another way to get their agenda done. 
You see, Republicans found another 
place for that Alexander Hamilton 
quote. It turns out that they can’t—or 
they don’t want to—govern here. But 
they found a way to get another branch 
of government, insulated almost com-
pletely from popular opinion, to imple-
ment their world view. They want that 
inscription—Here, Sir, People Govern— 
to move to a building a block away, on 
the other side of First Street—the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
With the elevation of Amy Coney 
Barrett to that Court, Republicans will 
have completed their methodical, care-
ful surgical procedure—the transplant 
of American rule setting from the ab-
dominal cavity of this building to that 
of the building across the street. 
I want to explain what I mean by 
this, but, first, let’s just lay down an 
obvious predicate about the process 
that brought us to this moment. It is 
important. Senate Republicans were 
not telling the truth, as it turned out, 
when they said in 2016 that they be-
lieved the Senate shouldn’t confirm a 
Supreme Court Justice in the final 
year of a President’s term. Shocker— 
they didn’t actually mean what they 
said. They said it, in 2016, to try to put 
some lazy, razor-thin veneer of intel-
lectual legitimacy on their refusal to 
let President Obama fill a vacancy on 
the Supreme Court, as was his duty and 
right under the Constitution. But we 
know now that their obstruction of 
Merrick Garland was, of course, just a 
simple, naked, anti-democratic, anti- 
constitutional power grab. 
They should have just admitted it 
then because at least it would have 
avoided the mind-blowing hypocrisy of 
this sudden, stunning reversal of posi-
tion. Now, suddenly, all of a sudden it 
is OK to confirm a Justice in the last 
year of a President’s term—in the last 
few months of an election, while people

October 22, 2020 
are actually voting, as it turns out. Of 
course, it is, because all that matters 
here now is power. We get that. We will 
remember. The rules have changed. 
The Republicans changed them. You 
went back on your word. And it makes 
this whole process lack legitimacy. 
It is important to stipulate that, but 
it is an insufficient explanation, admit-
tedly, of my opposition to Amy Coney 
Barrett, because the consequences of 
this nomination go far beyond the 
downward spiral upon which Repub-
licans have placed this institution. No, 
the real travesty here is that trans-
plant of lawmaking from here to the 
Supreme Court and what it is going to 
mean for regular people out there when 
5 of 300 million Americans—5 people 
who are unelected and totally unac-
countable to popular opinion—start 
changing the rules under which we all 
live because the rule changes they sup-
port and their political movements 
support are so wildly unpopular that 
they couldn’t be passed in Congress. So 
they had to be enacted over in the Su-
preme Court. 
Seventy times since the passage of 
the Affordable Care Act, Republicans 
have tried to gut all or part of the law. 
Thirty-one times the Republicans tried 
to repeal it in its entirety. They shut 
down the entire Federal Government 
for 2 weeks, trying to strong-arm 
Democrats to acquiesce to their de-
mands to end health insurance for 20 
million Americans. But all 31 times, 
they 
failed—most 
spectacularly, 
of 
course, in the summer of 2017. 
So, having failed here at this polit-
ical imperative, Republicans turned to 
the courts. Senator CORNYN kind of ex-
plained what they did for you in his re-
marks just before mine. He said, Re-
publicans put into the 2017 tax bill a 
relatively small change to the Afford-
able Care Act that opened it up to judi-
cial assault. Then, not coincidentally, 
Republican attorneys general, joined 
by President Trump, sued to invalidate 
the entire law because of that one 
small change. Senator CORNYN talked 
about severability. That is not what 
the plaintiffs in the case, including 
President Trump, are asking for. They 
are asking for that change in law to 
bring down the entirety of the ACA, 
and President Trump confirmed that, 
once again, today in an interview on 
‘‘60 Minutes.’’ 
A Republican-appointed judge ruled 
for Trump at the district court, and 
then a Trump-appointed, McConnell- 
confirmed judge provided the decisive 
vote at the appeals court in favor of 
striking down the law. Now that entire 
law is up for legal challenge at the Su-
preme Court, and—surprise—the hear-
ing to invalidate the entirety of the Af-
fordable Care Act is in 3 weeks. 
You wonder why we are rushing 
through this nomination in record 
time. Amy Coney Barrett, who has al-
ready stated on the record that she 
thinks the law, even before the changes 
in the tax bill were made, is unconsti-
tutional, has been selected specifically 
in order to be the fifth vote to invali-
date the Affordable Care Act. 
That is not conspiratorial thinking. 
That is the President’s word. He has 
said he is not going to put people on 
the Supreme Court unless they do the 
opposite of what John Roberts did. 
The same goes for Neil Gorsuch and 
Brett Kavanaugh. They have all been 
picked for the Court because of their 
willingness to bend the law and the 
Constitution, through this riotously 
flexible doctrine called originalism, to 
comply with Republican requests of the 
Court. This new crowd of jurists that 
are trained, midwifed, and championed 
by Republican political associations 
like the Federalist Society are brought 
up through the farm system and up to 
the majors to do one thing, to win 
games for the franchise—the pro-cor-
porate, anti-worker, modern Repub-
lican Party. 
Really, Coney Barrett’s confirmation 
is just the final act of this plan to 
make the Supreme Court do what the 
Republican Congress couldn’t—in this 
case, end the Affordable Care Act and 
the insurance it provides for 23 million 
Americans and the protections that it 
gives to 130 million Americans with 
preexisting conditions. 
I love this argument that Repub-
licans use that all of a sudden we 
shouldn’t worry about what is about to 
happen on the Supreme Court, that it 
is all a construction of our imagination 
that there is some effort under way to 
invalidate the Affordable Care Act. 
I didn’t just wake up yesterday. I 
have been in Congress since the pas-
sage of the Affordable Care Act. I have 
watched 
the 
methodical, 
daily, 
unending campaign of Republicans to 
strike down the entirety of the Afford-
able Care Act. I watched them make 
the change to the tax law when they 
couldn’t repeal it through Congress. I 
then watched mainstream Republican 
attorneys general all together, en 
masse, bring a case to invalidate the 
entire law. I watched the Trump ad-
ministration break with precedent and 
join that suit, arguing against his own 
government’s position. 
Now I have watched this Senate ele-
vate three people to the Supreme Court 
who have been brought up through that 
same political movement and will vote 
to end those protections in the Afford-
able Care Act. My eyes have been 
opened these last 10 years. I know what 
is going on, and so do the American 
people. 
Joe is a constituent of mine from 
East Haven. He says: 
After working for decades, I was one of 
millions laid-off due to the covid-19 eco-
nomic disaster. Not only was my livelihood 
destroyed, but my health insurance dis-
appeared along with it. I am not old enough 
for Medicare nor young enough to feel secure 
without health insurance. Private insurance 
and COBRA are simply too expensive for the 
average middle class individual who now has 
no income. The ACA is my only option for 
healthcare coverage. 
Margaret from Enfield, CT, says: 
My husband had a near fatal heart attack 
2 years ago. He has recovered but requires 
on-going monitoring. He now has a ‘‘pre-
existing condition.’’ He was laid off from his 
job . . . six weeks ago [a job he had for 28 
years]. We have no income, and [we have] to 
pay . . . to have his health care continued. 
Without the ACA, we would not only have no 
income, but also no health insurance. We 
would be destitute trying to pay his health 
care bills. 
Imagine 23 million people losing 
health insurance in the middle of a 
pandemic. But that is why we are rush-
ing through Amy Coney Barrett’s nom-
ination—because there is this chance, 
finally, to grab the brass ring, to get 
rid of the Affordable Care Act. If you 
don’t get Amy Coney Barrett on the 
Court by the time that hearing hap-
pens in 3 weeks, it makes that effort a 
lot harder. 
Healthcare isn’t the only area of our 
daily lives that will be changed if Amy 
Coney 
Barrett 
turns 
the 
Supreme 
Court into a new legislative body. Let 
me take you down another rabbit hole: 
the use of the Supreme Court to re-
write the Nation’s firearm laws. 
The National Rifle Association’s vice 
grip over Congress is nearly over. Evi-
dence of that comes from the 2017–2018 
legislative session, when the NRA con-
trolled both Houses of Congress, had 
their man sitting in the Oval Office, 
and they had priorities, but they 
couldn’t get any of them called up for 
a vote. Then, in 2018, 30-plus NRA A- 
rated House Members were removed 
from office by their voters and replaced 
by supporters of measures like uni-
versal background checks and bans on 
AR–15s. NRA-sponsored measures can’t 
even get a vote in a Republican Con-
gress anymore because they are so un-
popular. 
But just like ACA repeal, the win-
dow, though it is closed here to weaken 
our Nation’s gun laws, remains open on 
the Supreme Court. Once again, it is 
time to abandon legislative action and 
for Republicans to turn to the Court. 
Amy Coney Barrett represents the 
vanguard of the new, radical, out-of- 
the-box pro-gun industry thinking on 
the definition of the Second Amend-
ment. It is the kind of radical, new 
thinking that is necessary if one wants 
the courts, rather than the legislature, 
to invalidate background checks laws, 
something an elected body could never, 
ever, ever do, what with 90 percent of 
the Americans supporting universal 
background checks. 
Amy Coney Barrett’s opinion in 
Kanter v. Barr is a sight to behold, 
really. In it, she argues it is unconsti-
tutional for a legislature to prohibit 
felons from owning a gun. She says the 
Second Amendment guarantees certain 
felons the right to own firearms, even 
though 90 percent of Americans think 
otherwise. 
What she writes to back up her view 
is even more radical, even more dan-
gerous. She says that courts, not the 
legislature, should be the finder of fact 
on whether a person is too dangerous 
to own a gun. And she says that the 
courts can overturn any gun restric-
tion if they find evidence that refutes 
the efficacy of the law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6396 
October 22, 2020 
Basically, she is saying the courts 
are now going to micromanage our gun 
laws. She believes the Second Amend-
ment puts the courts, not the legisla-
ture, in charge of choosing who can 
own a weapon and who can’t. That is, 
of course, a curiously convenient view 
for a Republican Party that would love 
to weaken our gun laws but can’t do it 
through 
Congress. 
Now—surprise 
again—the Supreme Court rides to the 
rescue. 
This, of course, would be devastating 
for the safety of Americans if criminals 
could once again buy guns. Last week, 
I was spending time with Janet Rice, 
whose son Shane was killed just a few 
blocks from my house in Hartford. An 
argument over a girl turned deadly 
when one angry young man went to the 
front seat of his car and grabbed an il-
legal weapon, likely bought through a 
loophole in the background checks sys-
tem, and used it to shoot Shane in the 
back. 
Weaker background checks systems 
mean more illegal weapons, more sui-
cides, more domestic violence murders, 
but they probably mean higher profits 
for the NRA’s members. 
Let’s move on to one last priority of 
Republicans that is stuck, that can’t 
move, in the legislative branch: more 
power and influence for dark money po-
litical groups. 
No Member of the Senate who wants 
to run for reelection in this body would 
ever introduce a piece of legislation al-
lowing anonymous billionaire donors 
to gain more influence over the polit-
ical process. That would be career sui-
cide. No one in America supports that. 
But these dark money groups are a 
boon for Republicans because most of 
the billion-dollar interests that want 
to influence elections—like the oil and 
gas industry, for instance—support Re-
publican candidates. 
Once again, the Supreme Court be-
comes that back door to get rules put 
in place that advance a Republican po-
litical interest that could never get en-
acted by Congress. Amy Coney Barrett 
will join five other Justices who will 
all likely rule that most regulations of 
campaign finance laws, like our Fed-
eral and State laws restricting the size 
of donations to campaigns, are con-
stitutionally invalid. 
The Court has already ruled that the 
Constitution protects a corporation’s 
right to spend limitless amounts of po-
litical money. That is just the begin-
ning. Billionaires want all of our cam-
paign finance laws eviscerated, and 
that new radical, out-of-the-box think-
ing on the First Amendment suggests 
that day is coming if Amy Coney Bar-
rett does what is expected of her and 
joins other ultraconservatives on the 
Court to strike down our remaining 
campaign finance laws. 
Here, Sir, People Govern. That is 
what the inscription says on the walls 
of the U.S. Capitol. It used to be true. 
Now the inscription should probably 
read ‘‘Here, Sir, People Confirm’’ be-
cause now, with an activist, rule-set-
ting, norm-busting Supreme Court, 
there is really no need for Republicans 
to pass laws anymore. The Coney Bar-
rett Court will do all the lawmaking 
Republican 
interests 
require. 
And, 
frankly, if Democrats win this Novem-
ber, that same Coney Barrett Court 
will just invalidate any attempts that 
Congress tries to make to expand the 
Affordable Care Act or pass universal 
background checks or protect voters’ 
access to the polls. 
I get it. I know it feels weird to hear 
somebody like me describing Amy 
Coney Barrett as extreme because she 
doesn’t look extreme; she doesn’t talk 
in extreme tones. But, really, look at 
what she stands for: the elimination of 
the Affordable Care Act, the right of 
felons to own guns, the interpretation 
of a Constitution to allow for the flood 
of billionaire money into politics. 
Those are extreme views. Do you know 
why I know that? Because none of 
that—the repeal of the ACA, the invali-
dation of our background checks sys-
tem, the erosion of campaign finance 
laws—none of that could pass Congress 
even when the most partisan Repub-
licans were in charge of all of the rel-
evant lawmaking institutions here. 
That agenda was so unpopular, so mar-
ginal, that even a Republican Congress 
and a Republican President wouldn’t 
touch it in the end. 
But over there at the Supreme Court, 
that is now the place where people will 
govern after Amy Coney Barrett is 
rammed through in the quickest con-
firmation process in modern history, 
an abomination of a process that 
makes a mockery of the Senate and the 
Constitution. Over there, that will be-
come the new power in American de-
mocracy, and we are all worse off for 
it. 
I will oppose Amy Coney Barrett’s 
nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
NOMINATION OF MICHAEL JAY NEWMAN 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, at 4:20 
p.m. today, which is in about 5 min-
utes, we are going to vote on a Federal 
judge. We are going to vote on whether 
to confirm Judge Michael Newman to 
be the next Federal judge for the 
Southern District of Ohio. 
I have known Mike Newman for over 
three decades, and he is an excellent 
choice for this role. He is an active 
member of the legal community in 
Ohio and is particularly active in his 
community of Dayton. He is also in-
volved nationally. He was the first 
magistrate judge ever to be appointed 
national president of the Federal Bar 
Association, through which he created 
an impressive national civics program 
to allow young people, including a lot 
of young people in the Southern Dis-
trict of Ohio, to meet with Federal 
judges. He started and presides over 
the Southern District of Ohio’s Federal 
Veterans Treatment Court, which has 
helped more than 70 veterans with 
PTSD and opioid addiction. I have seen 
the court in action. 
Mike is doing a great job. In fact, 
this year, he was selected to receive 
the Ohio State Bar Foundation’s Ritter 
Award, which is a lifetime service 
award given to one lawyer or judge in 
Ohio every year to recognize a long- 
term commitment to ethics, profes-
sionalism, and integrity. That is Mike. 
Judge Newman is the right choice for 
this important seat in his having 
served the community of Dayton with 
honor and distinction, and I am con-
fident he will do the same in this new 
role. I urge my colleagues to, in a mo-
ment, strongly support his confirma-
tion. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. President, of course, this week, 
we are also continuing to consider an 
important nomination of another Fed-
eral judge—Seventh Circuit Judge Amy 
Coney Barrett—to fill the Supreme 
Court vacancy. 
Yesterday, I had the chance to sit 
down one-on-one with Judge Barrett to 
ask her questions and follow up on 
what I thought was an impressive per-
formance before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. Even before our meeting, 
what I knew about Judge Barrett sug-
gested she would be a good candidate 
for this important role. Based on what 
I heard in our meeting, it is clear to me 
she is not only well qualified to serve 
on the Court but that she is also a 
great listener and has the right under-
standing of what the Court’s role is. 
She will be a terrific Supreme Court 
Justice. I believe she also understands 
the need to address the lack of faith in 
our institutions in this city, including 
the Court, and is willing to play an im-
portant role in helping to rebuild trust. 
Importantly, she reiterated to me 
what she said in the committee, which 
is that she has a commitment to inter-
pret the text of the Constitution and 
the laws as they are written rather 
than through the lens of her own policy 
and personal preferences. I appreciate 
that modest approach. It leaves the 
legislating to the representatives, who 
have been elected by the people, rather 
than to the unelected judges. Of course, 
we are also all inspired by her personal 
story and her commitment to her faith, 
to her family, and to her profession. 
Let’s be honest. During normal, less 
partisan times, this woman would be 
confirmed overwhelmingly. I believe 
she is an excellent choice. I commend 
the President for nominating her, and I 
strongly support her confirmation to 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Ohio. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, while 
we have another minute, let me just 
say on another topic, which is the 
coronavirus pandemic, I am deeply dis-
appointed that yesterday we had an-
other vote here on the floor of the Sen-
ate wherein we offered legislation 
which passed by a majority of the Sen-
ators but not the supermajority needed 
that simply focused on the coronavirus

pandemic 
and 
the 
economic 
con-
sequences of it. Unbelievably, it was 
blocked. In other words, we were not 
able to move forward because the 
Democrats were not willing to at least 
get on the issue and begin to discuss 
and debate the issue. This is sad to me. 
We are not out of the woods yet ei-
ther in terms of the economy or in 
terms of the pandemic. In fact, we are 
in the third phase now of the pandemic 
in many of our States, including in 
mine, Ohio. We need help. This legisla-
tion had that help—as an example, $30 
billion-plus for a vaccine. We need that 
funding to be able to get a vaccine as 
quickly as possible. We need money for 
therapies, money for our schools, and 
money for small businesses to be able 
to keep their doors open. 
I am concerned that we are not using 
the same bipartisan approach we used 
four other times in this Chamber to 
help deal with the coronavirus pan-
demic. 
I yield the floor.

MORNING BUSINESS 
TRIBUTE TO PAUL IGNATIUS 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
next month, our country will salute 
the life and achievements of former 
Secretary of the Navy Paul Ignatius as 
he celebrates his 100th birthday. I 
would like to join Paul’s family and 
friends in recognizing his years of lead-
ership and service to our country. 
The son of Armenian immigrants, 
Paul 
completed 
his 
undergraduate 
studies at the University of Southern 
California. There, he entered the Phi 
Kappa Tau brotherhood, the same col-
lege fraternity I would later join at the 
University 
of 
Louisville. 
Paul’s 
achievements on campus were just the 
beginning of his remarkable life. 
Like so many other members of the 
Greatest Generation, Paul put his life 
on hold to serve in uniform during 
World War II. He interrupted his stud-
ies at Harvard Business School to en-
list in the U.S. Navy and was commis-
sioned as a lieutenant. As an aviation 
ordnance officer, Paul served aboard 
the escort aircraft carrier USS Manila 
Bay in the Pacific. 
Returning home after 4 years in the 
Navy, Paul completed his MBA at Har-
vard and began a successful career in 
the private sector. However, our coun-
try would call on him once again. When 
it did, Paul was ready to answer. 
In 1961, Secretary of Defense Robert 
McNamara asked Paul to serve as As-
sistant Secretary of the Army. He 
agreed and began 8 years of prominent 
leadership in the Pentagon under both 
President John F. Kennedy and Presi-
dent Lyndon B. Johnson. Paul served 
in several capacities, including Assist-
ant Secretary of Defense for Installa-
tions and Logistics. Finally, in 1967, 
Paul was chosen to lead the same Navy 
he joined as a lieutenant more than 
two decades before. 
Paul left the Pentagon and began 
new ventures in journalism, philan-
thropy, and scholarship. He has earned 
several honors and awards for the last-
ing impacts of his leadership. Last 
year, Paul received a premier recogni-
tion for a Navy veteran and leader. He 
joined his successor, Secretary of the 
Navy Richard V. Spencer, at a commis-
sioning ceremony of the USS Paul Ig-
natius, an Arleigh-Burke class guided- 
missile destroyer. 
So it is a privilege to join those pay-
ing tribute to Paul Ignatius’ lifetime of 
accomplishments for our Armed Forces 
and our Nation. As he celebrates his 
100th birthday, appropriately on Vet-
erans Day, I wish him the very best. On 
behalf of the Senate, I extend my sin-
cere gratitude for his service.

REMEMBERING JOHN MCNAMARA 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Winston 
Churchill famously said: ‘‘If you’re 
going through hell, keep going.’’ Per-
severe, don’t give up. It is good advice. 
Here is another bit of good advice for 
weathering hard times: Look to a 
brighter future, but also study the 
past. Look at how others before you 
have triumphed over similar difficul-
ties, and learn from their example. 
During these hard, pandemic times, 
leaders and communities—and anyone,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6398 
October 22, 2020 
really—would do well to study the life 
and accomplishments of an exceptional 
leader, the former mayor of Rockford, 
IL, John McNamara. 
John died on September 30 at the age 
of 81. As Rockford’s mayor from 1981 to 
1989, he helped guide Rockford through 
a national recession, which crippled 
the manufacturing industry in his city. 
When he took office, Rockford’s jobless 
rate stood at 11.5 percent. Eighteen 
months later, it had ballooned to near-
ly 25 percent, the highest unemploy-
ment in the Nation. For the first time 
since the Great Depression, the city’s 
population declined. The New York 
Times reported that Rockford was 
‘‘bleeding away its jobs and its people.’’ 
Speaking with a Rockford Register 
Star reporter in 2006, John McNamara 
recalled those times. He said: ‘‘People 
would come into my office to tell me 
about their situation. It was very 
heart-wrenching and emotional. It hit 
you in the gut.’’ 
John McNamara steered Rockford 
through those dark years with a strong 
leadership style and an irrepressible, 
infectious sense of optimism. He be-
lieved in Rockford’s people and possi-
bilities, and he inspired others to be-
lieve in them, too. 
By the start of his second and final 
term in 1985, the city’s economy was on 
an upswing. While part of the improve-
ment was due to a broader, national 
economic recovery, much of Rockford’s 
rebound was the result of bold deci-
sions by McNamara to overhaul the 
city’s government. 
He professionalized the mayor’s of-
fice and realigned the city’s finances. 
He worked to create opportunities for 
economic growth and prosperity. He 
made smart investments in infrastruc-
ture to create new jobs and attract new 
industries to Rockford and to diversify 
and strengthen the city’s economic 
base. He spearheaded the resurrection 
of downtown Rockford. 
He helped to establish a local tour-
ism bureau and an arts council. He 
committed public funds to turn an old 
Sears Roebuck building into the Rock-
ford Museum Park, home to the Rock-
ford Art Museum, the Discovery Cen-
ter, and the Rockford Dance Company. 
He worked for social justice for all of 
his city’s residents. In a city where the 
school district had twice faced lawsuits 
for racial discrimination, he made ra-
cial healing a priority. He told his chil-
dren that his favorite day of the year 
was Martin Luther King Day; he loved 
the inspiration he drew from visits to 
African-American churches. He estab-
lished a Mayors Task Force on Home-
lessness. 
He was famous for his blunt speaking 
style and his booming voice, which 
echoed throughout city hall. He was 
funny, with a loud laugh. In his days as 
mayor, he stood 6-foot-4 and weighed 
about 180 pounds, tops. People used to 
marvel that such a big laugh could 
come from such a thin frame. He greet-
ed people with a big hug and a big 
smile. He listened. 
He was a Democrat who didn’t be-
lieve that any political party has a mo-
nopoly on good ideas. He was elected 
by Democrats and Republicans, and he 
appointed people from both parties to 
serve in city committees. One of his fa-
vorite sayings was: ‘‘If you can’t make 
a friend, don’t make an enemy.’’ 
A Republican who served during his 
years as mayor, current Rockford Al-
derman Frank Beach said: ‘‘John was a 
strong man [who] loved our commu-
nity—a man of integrity, a man that 
put shoe leather to his convictions.’’ 
He motivated and inspired people, 
and he was energetic and tireless. 
Rockford was John’s adopted home-
town. He grew up in Whiting, IN, where 
his folks ran a small mom-and-pop gro-
cery. He had two sisters. In his school, 
he was class president. He also played 
football, basketball, and baseball, and 
he was on the bowling team. He earned 
a bachelor’s degree from Notre Dame 
University and a law degree from the 
University of Michigan. 
In 1965, on a blind date, he met Bar-
bara Runkle, a young woman from the 
northern suburbs of Chicago. They ate 
at a diner and walked around Chicago. 
The next day, he drove 60 miles to see 
her again. He made that same 60-mile 
drive to see Barbara every day for 
months until they married on June 26, 
1965. 
John and Barbara were married for 55 
years and raised six children, three 
daughters and three sons, including 
Rockford’s current mayor, Tom McNa-
mara. 
Shortly after their wedding, John did 
a tour of duty in Vietnam as a captain 
in U.S. Army intelligence and earned a 
Bronze Star. After his military service, 
he passed up a chance to practice law 
in downtown Chicago and moved to 
Rockford to work as an assistant pub-
lic defender in Winnebago County. He 
said his work in steel mills and fac-
tories during college and law school 
pushed him toward a practice in which 
he could help people. 
He had public service in his blood. 
His father had served on the city coun-
cil and school board in Whiting, and 
two of his uncles were mayors. John’s 
own career in public office started in 
1974, when he was appointed by Rock-
ford’s mayor to fill a vacancy in the 
city’s Third Ward. He ran for reelection 
the following year, winning a 4-year 
term. He took a year off after his term 
ended and, a year later, announced 
that he would run for mayor. 
If you asked him what accomplish-
ment he was most proud of as mayor, 
John didn’t mention new buildings or 
economic development deals. He was 
proudest that he had helped the people 
of Rockford believe in a better future 
during a dark time. He was proud that 
he chose not to seek a third term, in-
stead endorsing his protege, then-city 
administrator Charles Box, who would 
go on to become Rockford’s first Black 
mayor, serving for three terms. 
John remained active in Rockford’s 
civic life. He joined William Charles In-
vestments Ltd. He also worked part- 
time for Rockford University; as the 
liberal arts college’s first vice presi-
dent for development, he helped save it 
from going under during tough times. 
In 2009, I was honored to nominate 
John to serve on a Federal Advisory 
Committee on Student Financial As-
sistance, an independent, bipartisan 
panel formed to advise Congress and 
the U.S. Secretary of Education on 
making college more affordable. He 
just never stopped trying to help peo-
ple. 
I will close with this story. On a 
chilly spring day in 1978, when John 
was serving on the city council, he 
helped save the life of a man who 
jumped off the State Street Bridge. 
John was in the Rockford Register 
Star building when he saw the man tee-
tering on the bridge’s railing. He took 
off running, but by the time he reached 
the 
bridge, 
the 
man 
had 
already 
jumped into the frigid Rock River. 
With the help of another man and a 16- 
year-old boy who happened to be pass-
ing by, John pulled the man out of the 
river. The only casualty was the new 
suit he was wearing, a bit of a luxury 
for a defense lawyer with six young 
children. 
John McNamara later told a col-
umnist: ‘‘I was shaking all the rest of 
that afternoon—not because I was cold. 
You just hate to see a guy get that de-
spondent.’’ 
That was John McNamara in a nut-
shell, willing to act boldly yet humbly 
to give someone else hope. He was a 
class act who led by example, and he 
was my friend. Loretta and I offer our 
condolences to John’s wife Barbara, 
their six children—John, Kate, Dan, 
Mary, 
Nell, 
and 
Tom 
and 
their 
spouses—and to John and Barbara’s 16 
grandchildren. He loved them all deep-
ly. He will be missed.

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EMER-
GENCY NURSES ASSOCIATION 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, on be-
half of myself and Senator WICKER, I 
rise today to recognize and celebrate 
the 50th anniversary of the Emergency 
Nurses Association. Made up of 51,000 
members from all across the globe, the 
Emergency 
Nurses 
Association, 
or 
ENA, is the only professional organiza-
tion dedicated to advancing excellence 
in 
emergency 
nursing 
and 
is 
the 
world’s premier organization for emer-
gency nurses. 
Founded in 1970 to set standards for 
best practices in emergency nursing 
care, the ENA has provided continuing 
education 
programs 
for 
emergency 
nurses, as well as a united voice for 
nurses involved in emergency care. 
Among its accomplishments, ENA 
has worked successfully to raise aware-
ness and improve outcomes for the Na-
tion’s trauma patients. For Americans 
aged 44 years or younger, traumatic in-
juries—including 
car 
crashes, 
falls, 
head injuries, burns, and firearm inju-
ries—are currently the leading cause of

death. Working to improve outcomes 
for those who have suffered a trau-
matic injury, ENA offers courses for 
emergency nurses that provide them 
with the knowledge, skills, and hands- 
on training needed to deliver high- 
quality trauma care. ENA’s trauma 
nursing core course is one such course. 
Since its inception in 1986, this course 
has been taken by more than 1 million 
emergency nurses and is now consid-
ered the gold standard for the edu-
cation of nurses in lifesaving trauma 
care techniques. 
ENA was also at the forefront of sup-
porting the MISSION ZERO Act, or the 
Military Injury Surgical Systems Inte-
grated Operationally Nationwide to 
Achieve ZERO Preventable Deaths Act. 
When this legislation was signed into 
law last year, it created an innovative 
program 
allowing 
military 
trauma 
teams and professionals to work in ci-
vilian trauma centers to ensure the 
highest quality trauma care in both 
peace and war. 
Finally, ENA has been the leader in 
raising awareness regarding the issue 
of workplace violence directed towards 
emergency nurses and other emergency 
department personnel. At the State 
level, it advocated for stronger crimi-
nal laws to hold those who assault 
healthcare workers in hospitals ac-
countable for their actions. At the Fed-
eral level, ENA has fought for tougher 
workplace standards to ensure that 
hospitals provide a safe working envi-
ronment for their employees. 
On the occasion of the Emergency 
Nurses Association’s 50th anniversary, 
Senator WICKER
and I ask our col-
leagues to join us in extending our 
deepest gratitude to the ENA and all 
its members for their commitment to 
improving the quality of emergency 
care that has and will continue to save 
the lives of millions of Americans 
across our country. 
f 
USHER SYNDROME 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would 
like to talk about a genetic condition 
called Usher syndrome. Usher syn-
drome is a rare genetic disease that af-
fects at least 25,000 people in the 
United States. Usher syndrome causes 
deafness or hearing loss, as well as a 
retinal disease that progressively leads 
to blindness. Some children may be di-
agnosed at birth, while others are diag-
nosed at later stages of adolescence, af-
fecting education, employment, and 
quality of life. 
Usher type 1 individuals are born 
deaf and then learn, often before ado-
lescence, that they are also losing their 
vision. Usher type 2 individuals are 
born with moderate to severe hearing 
loss and then in the prime of their ado-
lescent lives are told that they are los-
ing their vision. Usher type 3 are usu-
ally 
diagnosed 
during 
adolescence, 
leading to the slow loss of both hearing 
and vision. 
At present, there are no treatments 
or cure for Usher syndrome, but that 
could change with awareness and sup-
port. Finding a cure has never been 
more urgent or more achievable. Prom-
ising research and positive clinical 
trials are occurring right now at uni-
versities, medical centers, and private 
laboratories across the country. 
Even though there is currently no 
cure for Usher syndrome, I am proud 
that Oregonian researchers are leading 
the way searching for treatments and 
therapies. The Casey Eye Institute at 
Oregon Health & Science University— 
OHSU—is conducting the first human 
study of gene therapy for Usher syn-
drome, and researchers at the Univer-
sity of Oregon are generating animal 
models that represent the genotypes of 
the major Usher patient groups—both 
necessary steps towards the develop-
ment of effective treatments. It is a 
privilege to serve a State that is home 
to such cutting-edge research into 
Usher syndrome. 
To 
accelerate 
this 
research, 
the 
Usher Syndrome Coalition, including 
Emily Creasy from Oregon, is raising 
public awareness. Last month, on Sep-
tember 19, they helped recognize the 
6th annual Usher Syndrome Awareness 
Day. The day fell near the autumnal 
equinox, which marks the start of days 
that contain more darkness than light, 
a powerful metaphor for the threat of 
Usher syndrome. I am proud to support 
the Usher syndrome community and 
am committed to doing what I can as 
Oregon’s senior Senator to support re-
searchers hard at work finding treat-
ments and, hopefully, a cure. I am com-
mitted to working with my colleagues 
to raise awareness regarding this dis-
ease, and I applaud the hard work of 
the Usher Syndrome Coalition in mak-
ing Usher syndrome research a priority 
at the National Institutes of Health.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO VIC BIRD 
∑ Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to recognize Mr. Vic Bird on 
the occasion of his retirement. Vic has 
been a champion for the Oklahoma 
aviation community for nearly two 
decades. He most recently served as the 
director of the Oklahoma Aeronautics 
Commission for 18 years, the longest 
serving director in Oklahoma history. 
You would never know it, but back in 
2002, Vic Bird was a newcomer to avia-
tion. Nevertheless, there is no one in 
State government who worked harder 
to make Oklahoma the aviation capital 
of America. Vic Bird led the charge on 
numerous State legislative initiatives 
that brought aviation employers to 
Oklahoma, and the proof is in one num-
ber. Today, aviation and aerospace is 
Oklahoma’s second largest industry, 
with an annual economic impact of $44 
billion. 
Throughout his tenure at the Okla-
homa Aeronautics Commission, Vic has 
been a true friend to general aviation, 
supporting pilots and airports. Vic Bird 
was instrumental in making sure Okla-
homa State law protected pilots at 
public-use and military airports by 
keeping 
dangerous 
structures 
from 
being built too close to airport infra-
structure. Vic Bird promoted airports 
as anchor institutions supporting eco-
nomic development and job growth in 
communities 
across 
Oklahoma 
and 
joined me in an aerial tour of general 
aviation 
airports 
across 
Oklahoma 
back in June 2017. 
Before I conclude, I want to highlight 
two of the awards and recognitions Vic 
Bird has received that speak volumes 
of his commitment to aviation. The 
Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association 
awards the Joseph B. ‘‘Doc’’ Hartranft 
Jr. Award to an individual in govern-
ment service who has made significant 
contributions to the advancement of 
general aviation. Vic Bird was the first 
and only nonelected official to receive 
this award. Vic Bird is also the first 
and only Oklahoman elected to serve 
as chair of the National Association of 
State Aviation Officials. 
Vic Bird has remained an unwavering 
passionate advocate for aviation and 
aerospace in Oklahoma. I know I join 
his family and all that know him, in 
thanking him for his years of service 
and contributions to Oklahoma and our 
entire aviation community. 
Congratulations on your retirement.∑

TRIBUTE TO DEAN A. COLLETT 
∑ Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I offer 
my recognition of the great service of 
Dean A. Collett to countless Utah stu-
dents. His service has spanned over six 
decades, starting in the fall of 1956 
when he first walked through the doors 
of Highland High School. Today, at the 
age of 92, even through the difficulties 
of COVID–19, Dean sits at his desk 
making personal phone calls to each of 
his students, ensuring nothing less 
than their academic success. He is a 
true servant of the people of Utah and 
one who deserves the highest of honors. 
Dean Ashton Collett was born on 
September 30, 1928, to Richard G. 
Collett and Amy Ashton Collett in Salt 
Lake City, UT. Richard Collett was a 
successful banker, but due to the eco-
nomic turmoil of the Great Depression, 
the Collett family, with all five of their 
children, 
would 
move 
frequently 
around Salt Lake City looking for 
work, a hardship that would follow 
Richard and Amy for much of their 
lives. From those moments as a child, 
Dean would dedicate his entire life 
helping to support his family, working 
to keep food on the table and later tak-
ing care of his mother until her pass-
ing. Dean spent his youth working as a 
paper boy, doing yard work for hire, 
and later working as a grocery store 
cashier at Table Supply in the avenues 
of Salt Lake City. 
As the family kept relocating in 
search of work, Dean attended Emer-
son Elementary School, Ensign Ele-
mentary School, and Washington Ele-
mentary School. He progressed through

his educational pursuits, graduating 
from East High School in 1945 and later 
from the University of Utah in 1956. Be-
fore completing his time at the Univer-
sity of Utah, Dean served a 3-year mis-
sion in Sweden for The Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints. Upon his 
return, he was drafted into the Korean 
war and stationed in Germany due to 
his knowledge of both Swedish and 
German. Once he graduated from the 
University of Utah, Dean was given his 
first teaching job at a then brandnew 
school called Highland High School in 
Salt Lake City. Little did he know at 
the time that serving this school would 
end up being his whole life’s mission. 
During Dean’s time at Highland High 
School, he has taught the subjects of 
math, English, yearbook, student gov-
ernment, German, and Russian; acted 
as a cheerleading adviser; and is now a 
school counselor. His time at Highland 
has spanned more than 63 graduating 
classes and more than 30,000 students. 
He is an avid football fan and has yet 
to miss a single Highland High football 
game in the school’s entire history. 
You will often see him selling tickets 
for sporting events, dances, plays, and 
any other community events at the 
school. He has been a father figure to 
thousands and helped students in need 
of clothing, food, and financial assist-
ance, including for those serving a 
church mission. Dean never married or 
had children of his own, but instead 
dedicated his life to the children of 
Highland High School. 
My own staffer, Matt Holton, was a 
student of Dean’s in the early 2000s and 
got to experience Dean’s extraordinary 
dedication to his students firsthand. 
While Matt was a freshman, his father 
was deployed with the U.S. Army in 
Operation Iraqi Freedom. Dean saw a 
student in need of additional care and 
so took Matt under his wing, becoming 
a crucial mentor and father figure in 
his life. To this day, they remain close 
friends. 
Dean was also a teacher of a dear 
friend of mine, former Governor of the 
State of Utah, U.S. Ambassador to 
China, and U.S. Ambassador to Russia 
Jon Huntsman. Dean often teaches the 
students of Highland High School that 
failure is a critical ingredient to suc-
cess, using the example that Jon 
Huntsman, who ran and lost for stu-
dent body president, later achieved the 
highest offices of public service. 
Dean is an undeniable institution not 
only at Highland High School, but 
throughout the entire State of Utah. 
He is a Utahn from the Greatest Gen-
eration, embodying the best of the 
American spirit; and it is my privilege 
to honor him today.∑

REMEMBERING DR. ALAN 
CRANDALL 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, today I 
wish to pay tribute to Dr. Alan 
Crandall, of Salt Lake City, Utah, who 
passed away on October 2, 2020. A lead-
er in the ophthalmologic community, 
Dr. Crandall was senior vice chair and 
director of glaucoma and cataract at 
the University of Utah John A. Moran 
Eye Center. 
Alan was born on June 13, 1947. In 
1969, he received his undergraduate de-
gree from the University of Utah, 
where he stayed to earn his medical de-
gree in 1973. He later returned to the 
University of Utah as a professor and 
chairman of the Department of Oph-
thalmology and Visual Sciences. 
In his career, Crandall pioneered sev-
eral surgical techniques and partici-
pated in clinical studies used to impact 
the future of ophthalmology and used 
his skills to further the next genera-
tion 
of 
ophthalmologists 
through 
training and mentoring surgeons. As 
founder of the Global Outreach Divi-
sion of the Moran Eye Center and past 
president of the American Society of 
Cataract and Refractive Surgery, Dr. 
Crandall spent nearly four decades 
helping those in need access high-qual-
ity eye care. Dr. Crandall’s service to 
the field of ophthalmology continued 
as a member of the National Board of 
Medical Examiners and the American 
Board of Ophthalmology. 
His philanthropy was widespread, 
performing free surgeries in his local 
community and in dozens of developing 
countries around the globe. I traveled 
with Dr. Crandall to Guatemala and 
Haiti to help perform vision restoring 
cataract surgeries and saw firsthand 
his compassion and commitment to 
curing preventable diseases. 
Dr. Crandall’s humanitarianism was 
so renowned that he received numerous 
international awards for his work. He 
is the only physician to have received 
four of the most prestigious humani-
tarian awards in ophthalmology from 
the American Glaucoma Society, the 
American Academy of Ophthalmology, 
the American Society of Cataract and 
Refractive Surgery, and the Chang 
Family Foundation. Additionally, Ro-
tary International awarded him with 
both the Health Care Heroes Award for 
Excellence in Health Care and Commu-
nity Outreach and the Vocational Ex-
cellence Award for Humanitarian Serv-
ice. 
On behalf of all ophthalmologists, to-
gether we mourn the loss of an out-
standing surgeon and even greater 
man. Alan was a steadfast ambassador 
to the field of ophthalmology, and his 
true selflessness will certainly never be 
forgotten.∑

TRIBUTE TO MARGIE 
MONTGOMERY 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, 50 years 
ago—several years before the landmark 
Roe v. Wade decision—a young mother 
was so moved by a news story calling 
for the legalization of abortion in Ken-
tucky that she began to share her con-
cerns with family, friends, and anyone 
who would listen. Out of her passion, 
the Kentucky Right to Life was born, 
and for 50 years, Margie Montgomery 
has nurtured, grown, and led this orga-
nization. Last week, Margie announced 
her retirement. We celebrate alongside 
her that countless lives have been 
saved through the efforts of Kentucky 
Right to Life over the past five dec-
ades. She leaves a strong organization 
in place that will continue to protect 
the unborn who are, in Margie’s words, 
‘‘unique, living human beings, made in 
the image of God.’’∑

RECOGNIZING SCOTLYNN USA 
DIVISION, INC. 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, each 
week I recognize a small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit at the heart of our coun-
try. It is my privilege to recognize a 
small business with award-winning in-
novation that provides high-quality 
service and is active in its community. 
This week, it is my pleasure to honor 
Scotlynn USA Division, Inc., of Fort 
Myers, FL, as the Senate Small Busi-
ness of the Week. 
Ryan Carter founded Scotlynn USA 
Division, Inc., in 2010, the year after 
the 
Great 
Recession 
ended. 
Ryan 
worked for a Cincinnati freight broker-
age firm and identified a market de-
mand for reliable, customer-focused de-
livery 
of 
time-sensitive 
perishable 
goods. Together, Ryan and his younger 
brother, Brad, established Scotlynn 
USA in Fort Myers as a transportation 
and logistics provider in southwest 
Florida. The business grew quickly, 
moving in 2012 from their original 900- 
square-foot office into their current 
12,000-square-foot building. 
Today, Scotlynn USA has grown into 
an award-winning logistics firm oper-
ating a truck fleet and freight broker-
age that distributes perishable foods 
nationwide. Ryan serves as the execu-
tive vice president, and Brad is in a 
managerial role. They foster a sense of 
community among their employees, re-
sulting in high employee retention 
rates, and they prioritize hiring vet-
erans. Ryan serves on a number of non-
profit boards and volunteers with sev-
eral 
organizations, 
including 
Big 
Brothers Big Sisters, Habitat for Hu-
manity, 
and 
St. 
Matthews 
House. 
Uniquely, Scotlynn USA provides its 
employees 16 hours of annual leave to 
volunteer with local organizations. 
Scotlynn USA has received industry 
recognition for its entrepreneurship 
and innovation. Notably, it received 
early help from the Florida Small 
Business Development Center—SBDC— 
located at Florida Gulf Coast Univer-
sity, FGCU. They provided Scotlynn 
resources, including mentorship, busi-
ness planning, and access to capital ad-
vice to help them establish their busi-
ness. In 2019, the Florida SBDC at 
FGCU awarded Ryan the Distinguished 
Entrepreneur of the Year title. This 
year, Ryan was named as the 2020 U.S. 
Small Business Administration—SBA— 
Florida Small Business Person of the 
Year and was named first runner-up for

the SBA 2020 Small Business Person of 
the Year. 
Like many Floridian small busi-
nesses, Scotlynn USA rose to the occa-
sion and supported their community 
during 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic. 
Working with Feeding America, they 
raised funds for charity and distributed 
more than 3,500 free meals. Partnering 
with Community Cooperative and Mid-
west Food Bank, Scotlynn USA do-
nated logistical support and truck 
space, enabling these two food banks to 
distribute 
approximately 
2 
million 
pounds of food to Floridians in need. 
As an essential business, Scotlynn 
USA managed to stay open, keep their 
employees safe, and play a key role in 
keeping our Nation’s supply chains 
running smoothly. In April 2020, the 
SBA launched the Paycheck Protection 
Program—PPP—a small business relief 
program I was proud to author. The 
PPP provides forgivable loans to im-
pacted small businesses and nonprofits 
who maintain their payroll during the 
coronavirus pandemic. Thanks to their 
PPP loan, Scotlynn USA was able to 
retain 214 jobs and continued serving 
their customers and community. 
Scotlynn USA exemplifies the crit-
ical role that small businesses play in 
investing in community development. 
Their leadership and commitment to 
their customers and employees is com-
mendable, especially during these un-
precedented times. 
Congratulations to Ryan, Brad and 
the entire team at Scotlynn USA Divi-
sion, Inc. I look forward to your con-
tinued success in Florida and through-
out the United States.∑

S. RES. 751 
Whereas, in 1982, the United States de-

anon as part of a multinational peace-
keeping force; 
Whereas, early on the morning of October 
23, 1983, a truck packed with explosives deto-
nated outside of a building at Beirut Inter-
national Airport that served as quarters for 
several hundred members of the Armed 
Forces deployed as part of the peacekeeping 
force; 
Whereas 241 members of the Armed Forces 
were killed in the blast; 
Whereas the members of the Armed Forces 
killed included 220 Marines, members of the 
Battalion Landing Team, 1st Battalion, 8th 
Marines Regiment, which made October 23, 
1983, the deadliest day for the Marine Corps 
since the Battle of Iwo Jima in February and 
March 1945 during World War II; 
Whereas, in addition to the Marine Corps 
casualties, 18 Navy sailors and 3 Army sol-
diers were killed, and more than 100 other

Whereas members of the Armed Forces

serving in Beirut, Lebanon, from 1982 to 1984; 
Whereas, on the same day as the bombing 
of the Marine Corps barracks, another sui-
cide bomber killed 58 French paratroopers 
housed at another building in Beirut; and 
Whereas it is fitting and proper to recog-
nize the events of October 23, 1983, and the 
members of the Armed Forces of the United 
States who died in Beirut on that day 
through the establishment of a national day 
of remembrance on October 23, 2020: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate—

Carolina, Mrs. BLACKBURN, Mr. BRAUN, 
Mr. YOUNG, Mrs. LOEFFLER, Mr. CAS-
SIDY, Ms. MCSALLY, and Mr. LANKFORD) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 752 
Whereas the Chinese Communist Party has 
long persecuted Tibetans for their religious 
beliefs, including by illegitimately claiming 
authority to designate the Dalai Lama’s suc-
cessor, destroying religious institutions, and 
arbitrarily detaining, disappearing, and tor-
turing Tibetans in order to compel adherence 
to ‘‘normal religious activities’’, as sanc-
tioned by the Party; 
Whereas the Chinese Communist Party has 
launched a policy of Sinicization of Tibetans 
and escalated its attacks on Tibetans by re-
moving Tibetan farmers and herders from 
their land, compelling them to cede control 
of their land and herds to state authorities, 
transferring them to state facilities where 
they are subjected to forced labor training 
programs, political indoctrination, and other 
abuses, and sending them to state-assigned 
jobs in Tibet and other parts of China, often 
far from their families and communities; 
Whereas the Chinese Communist Party 
views forced labor and other coercive meas-
ures as acceptable practices for strength-
ening the Chinese economy, while simulta-
neously suppressing or eliminating religious 
and ethnic groups that it views as inherently 
threatening to its rule and other political 
ambitions; 
Whereas the Chinese Communist Party’s 
actions in Tibet, like its actions in the 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and 
other parts of China, reflect the Party’s be-
lief that might makes right and its deter-
mination to use every measure at its dis-
posal, no matter how heinous, to consolidate 
power and advance its interests; and 
Whereas the Chinese Communist Party be-
lieves that might makes right not just do-
mestically, but also in international rela-
tions, as evidenced by its actions in the Tai-
wan Strait, the South and East China Seas, 
along the Sino-Indian border, and in cyber-
space, as well as its use of economic threats 
to silence or otherwise compel nations, busi-
nesses, and individuals to accede to its de-
mands throughout the Indo-Pacific region 
and beyond: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the Chinese Communist Par-
ty’s campaign against religious freedom in 
Tibet, including its plainly illegitimate ef-
forts to designate the next Dalai Lama, 
which is a matter that should be determined 
solely within the Tibetan Buddhist faith 
community; 
(2) calls for an investigation into the Chi-
nese Communist Party’s use of forced labor, 
in addition to other coercive measures, to 
force Tibetans to practice their faith in a 
manner compliant with the Party’s interpre-
tation of ‘‘normal religious activities’’;

RESOLUTION 
753—SUP-
PORTING 
THE 
GOALS 
AND 
IDEALS OF NATIONAL DOMESTIC 
VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Ms. 
MURKOWSKI) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 753 
Whereas, according to the National Inti-
mate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey— 
(1) up to 12,000,000 individuals in the United 
States report experiencing intimate partner 
violence annually, including physical vio-
lence, rape, or stalking; and 
(2) approximately 1 in 5 women in the 
United States and up to 1 in 7 men in the 
United States have experienced severe phys-
ical violence by an intimate partner at some 
point in their lifetimes; 
Whereas, on average, 3 women in the 
United States are killed each day by a cur-
rent or former intimate partner, according 
to the Bureau of Justice Statistics; 
Whereas domestic violence can affect any-
one, but women who are 18 to 34 years of age 
typically experience the highest rates of do-
mestic violence; 
Whereas survivors of domestic violence are 
strong, courageous, and resilient; 
Whereas most female victims of intimate 
partner violence have been victimized by the 
same offender previously; 
Whereas domestic violence is cited as a 
significant factor in homelessness among 
families; 
Whereas millions of children are exposed 
to domestic violence each year; 
Whereas research shows that boys who are 
exposed to domestic violence in their house-
holds are more likely to become perpetrators 
of intimate partner violence; 
Whereas victims of domestic violence expe-
rience immediate and long-term negative 
outcomes, including detrimental effects on 
mental and physical health; 
Whereas research consistently shows that 
being abused by an intimate partner in-
creases an individual’s likelihood of sub-
stance use as well as associated harmful con-
sequences; 
Whereas victims of domestic violence may 
lose several days of paid work each year and 
may lose their jobs due to reasons stemming 
from domestic violence; 
Whereas crisis hotlines serving domestic 
violence victims operate 24 hours per day, 365 
days per year, and offer important crisis 
intervention services, support services, in-
formation, and referrals for victims; 
Whereas staff and volunteers of domestic 
violence shelters and programs in the United 
States, in cooperation with 56 State and ter-
ritorial coalitions against domestic violence, 
provide essential services to— 
(1) thousands of adults and children each 
day; and 
(2) 1,000,000 adults and children each year; 
Whereas more than 160 States, counties, 
and cities have experienced an increase in re-
ports 
of 
domestic 
violence 
during 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic increases 
the isolation of survivors of domestic vio-
lence and that isolation is being used as a 
tool by abusers to exert power and coercive 
control; 
Whereas domestic violence programs and 
hotlines have seen a substantial increase in 
contacts since the beginning of the COVID–19 
pandemic and are expecting a surge in re-
quests for services when social distancing is 
no longer necessary; 
Whereas local YWCAs shared that between 
March 31, 2020 and late summer 2020, as a re-
sult of the impact from the COVID–19 pan-
demic— 
(1) 69 percent of respondent YWCAs that 
operate domestic violence hotlines reported 
an increase in demand for services; and 
(2) 64 percent of nearly 100 local YWCAs 
who provide domestic violence services (ei-
ther emergency shelter or transitional hous-
ing) reported an increase in demand for do-
mestic violence shelter; 
Whereas while violence as a lived experi-
ence of American Indian and Alaska Native 
women exists in less pressing times, the 
COVID–19 pandemic has increased the chal-
lenges and barriers to accessing safety by ex-
acerbating already existing issues includ-
ing— 
(1) lack of safe housing for victims; 
(2) lack of space in shelters for victims to 
maintain safe social distancing; 
(3) lack of personal protective equipment 
for staff of tribal shelters and victim serv-
ices programs; 
(4) limited transportation for victims; and 
(5) lack of access to adequate health care; 
Whereas respondents to a survey of domes-
tic violence programs reported that sur-
vivors of domestic violence are facing finan-
cial challenges related to COVID–19 and 
three quarters of those respondents reported 
that survivors are having trouble accessing 
food, and more than half of those respond-
ents have reported that survivors cannot pay 
their bills; 
Whereas medical professionals have re-
ported that survivors of domestic violence 
are presenting with more severe injuries dur-
ing the pandemic; 
Whereas domestic violence programs are 
having to change the way they provide serv-
ices in response to the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas advocates for survivors of domes-
tic violence and survivors face the same 
challenges with childcare and facilitating 
online learning that others do; 
Whereas, according to a 2019 survey con-
ducted by the National Network to End Do-
mestic Violence, 77,226 domestic violence 
victims were served by domestic violence 
shelters and programs around the United 
States in a single day; 
Whereas non-citizen victims of domestic 
violence report heightened concerns with ac-
cessing law enforcement and services due to 
uncertainty arising from changing immigra-
tion policies and heightened immigration en-
forcement; 
Whereas law enforcement officers in the 
United States put their lives at risk each 
day by responding to incidents of domestic 
violence, which can be among the most vola-
tile and deadly calls; 
Whereas Congress first demonstrated a sig-
nificant commitment to supporting victims 
of domestic violence with the enactment of 
the landmark Family Violence Prevention 
and Services Act (42 U.S.C. 10401 et seq.); 
Whereas Congress has remained committed 
to protecting survivors of all forms of domes-
tic violence and sexual abuse by making 
Federal funding available to support the ac-
tivities that are authorized under— 
(1) the Family Violence Prevention and 
Services Act (42 U.S.C. 10401 et seq.); and 
(2) the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 
(34 U.S.C. 12291 et seq.); 
Whereas there is a need to continue to sup-
port programs and activities aimed at do-
mestic violence intervention and domestic 
violence prevention in the United States; 
Whereas domestic violence programs pro-
vide trauma-informed services to protect the 
safety, privacy, and confidentiality of sur-
vivors of domestic violence; and 
Whereas individuals and organizations that 
are dedicated to preventing and ending do-
mestic violence should be recognized: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) the Senate— 
(A) supports the goals and ideals of ‘‘Na-
tional 
Domestic 
Violence 
Awareness 
Month’’; 
(B) commends domestic violence victim ad-
vocates, domestic violence victim service 
providers, crisis hotline staff, and first re-
sponders serving victims of domestic vio-
lence, for their compassionate support of 
survivors of domestic violence; and 
(C) recognizes the impact of the COVID–19 
pandemic on advocates for survivors of do-
mestic violence and survivors; and 
(2) it is the sense of the Senate that Con-
gress should— 
(A) continue to raise awareness of— 
(i) domestic violence in the United States; 
and 
(ii) the corresponding devastating effects 
of domestic violence on survivors, families, 
and communities; and 
(B) pledge continued support for programs 
designed to— 
(i) assist survivors of domestic violence; 
(ii) hold perpetrators of domestic violence 
accountable; and 
(iii) bring an end to domestic violence.
