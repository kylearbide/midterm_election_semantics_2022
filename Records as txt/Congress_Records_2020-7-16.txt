HONORING MS. LORENZA ‘‘LORI’’ 
GUERRERO 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Ms. Lorenza ‘‘Lori’’ Guer-
rero, a beloved nurse from McAllen, Texas, 
who passed away due to COVID–19 on July 
7, 2020 at the age of 72. Lori was a hero; al-
ways putting others before herself. 
As our nation navigates an unprecedented 
global pandemic, healthcare providers like Lori 
Guerrero are working day in and day out to 
care for our constituents. Lori began her ca-
reer as a licensed vocational nurse in 1971, 
and after 49 incredible years serving her com-
munity as a nurse, she passed away from 
COVID–19. 
Lori will not only be remembered for her 
courageous efforts to serve her community, 
the Rio Grande Valley, fight COVID–19, but 
also for her decades of work helping victims of 
sexual assault as a sexual assault nurse ex-
aminer. At one point in her career, she met 
with as many as seven victims a day. Further-
more, she worked with local law enforcement 
to provide training and develop programs so 
those victims could be better served. 
These are just two examples that showcase 
Ms. Guerrero’s selflessness and devotion to 
her community. The daughter of migrant work-
ers, Lori never complained and was always 
ready to work. Her work ethic and compassion 
led her to be who she is today; an icon in the 
Rio Grande Valley. 
Madam Speaker, Ms. Lorenza ‘‘Lori’’ Guer-
rero could have retired when she heard that a 
global pandemic was looming, but she chose 
to help the sick in her community. I stand here 
today to recognize Ms. Guerrero for going 
above and beyond the call of duty. Lori paid 
the ultimate sacrifice, one that we will not for-
get. Her legacy will undoubtedly inspire future 
generations to follow in her footsteps.

IN HONOR OF CHRIS PEIRCE 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Chris Peirce, who is being hon-
ored for his work as the Veterans of Foreign 
War (VFW) New Hampshire State Com-
mander. VFW works to ensure that all vet-
erans are recognized for their service and sac-
rifice on behalf of our nation. During his time 
as State Commander, Commander Peirce 
helped organize the delivery of meals to vet-
erans around New Hampshire, conducted in 
person and virtual ‘‘buddy-checks’’ on fellow 
members, and worked tirelessly to ensure that 
no veteran feels isolated during this stressful 
time. 
Chris Peirce was born in Newbury, Massa-
chusetts and has been serving our country in 
one form or another ever since. Commander 
Peirce entered the Marine Corps in July of 
1980 and as an artillery section chief, he par-
ticipated in Operation Urgent Fury, the inva-
sion of Grenada. In 2004, he was deployed as 
First Sergeant of the 172nd New Hampshire 
National Guard as part of Operation Iraqi 
Freedom II. He retired as a First Sergeant 
from the NH Army National Guard in 2006 
after a combined 26 years of service. 
Commander Peirce joined VFW at Post 
1088 Kingston NH and maintains his Life 
membership there. He has held all positions at 
the Post level including Post Commander and 
All State Post Commander. At VFW he has 
been the Chairman of OTI, the Special Olym-
pics, and the Patriot’s Pen. He has also been 
a member of the Finance Committee and the 
All State Judging Committee. Finally, Com-
mander Peirce has represented the state of 
New Hampshire on the national Iraq/Afghani-
stan Committee for three years. 
Outside of VFW, Commander Peirce worked 
as an Engineering Project Manager for 21 
years with Mersen before retiring. His legacy 
of service continues with his son who is on ac-
tive duty with the Air Force. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
thank Commander Peirce for his service to our 
country and his dedication to his fellow vet-
erans. I congratulate him on his successful 
term as State Commander, and I thank him for 
all he does to make sure that veterans in our 
state are remembered and valued.

IN MEMORY OF PASTOR DAVID 
ROQUEMORE 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the memory of David Roquemore, es-
teemed pastor of Greater New Light Mis-
sionary Baptist Church in Detroit, Michigan. 
Pastor Roquemore knew at a young age 
that he was destined for a career in the clergy. 
He was deeply moved by the power of prayer 
and gospel music. Pastor Roquemore began 
his pastoral profession at Church of Our Faith 
Prayer Tabernacle, where he served as a 
faithful member of the renowned Voices of 
Prayer Tabernacle choir. Pastor Roquemore 
found his passion for prayer through song in 
Detroit’s burgeoning gospel music scene. He 
performed with the era’s powerhouse principal 
vocalists Hulah Gene Dunkin-Hurley, Louise 
McCord Williams, and his brother Richard 
Roquemore. The choir recorded, ‘‘The Love of 
God,’’ which became an instant hit. Affection-
ally known as ‘‘Rock’’, he remained a faithful 
member of the church. 
On August 7, 1982 a group of individuals 
assembled to deliberate the possibility of orga-
nizing a church. The meeting participants in-
cluded Reverend D. W. Roquemore, Sister 
Madeline Roquemore, other individuals who 
elected Reverend Roquemore as pastor of the 
newly formed Greater New Light Missionary 
Baptist Church, inaugurating a thirty-seven- 
year commitment. 
Pastor Roquemore committed to religious 
scholarship, earning degrees from William 
Tyndale College, Tennessee School of Reli-
gion, and Union Baptist Seminary. He also 
served in leadership roles for a number of or-
ganizations, including Executive Secretary of 
Council of Baptist Pastors and Detroit Vicinity, 
Secretary of Westside Ministers Alliance, 
Chairman of Health and Human Services De-
troit Water & Sewerage Department, and pro-
fessor of Tennessee School of Religion. Pas-
tor Roquemore’s commitment to serving the 
needs of others earned him great esteem and 
respect. 
Please join me in tribute to the memory of 
Pastor David Roquemore, a spiritual leader, 
who will be missed by his family, friends, and 
flock.

NATIONAL HEROES DAY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor heroes from the theater shoot-
ing in Aurora, Colorado on July 20, 2012. 
Twelve lives were taken, seventy were injured, 
and hundreds suffered emotional trauma. Yet 
even in this tragedy, we saw incredible her-
oism that night—those who sacrificed them-
selves to save others, those who helped oth-
ers while badly wounded themselves, and 
lives that were saved by the tireless efforts of 
first responders and medical teams. 
These men inspired me to act on a National 
Heroes Day Resolution: 
John Larimer, age 27, was a Navy Petty Of-
ficer 3rd Class and cryptologic technician who 
was stationed at Buckley Air Force Base in 
Aurora for about a year. He was murdered 
protecting his girlfriend and his friend inside 
the theater, jumping into action to protect them 
once the shooting began. John was the 
youngest of five siblings from Crystal Lake, Illi-
nois. 
Jonathan Blunk, age 26, served his country

was to become a Navy Seal. He was at the 
theater with a girlfriend when the shooting

tiple times and suffered a fatal gunshot wound 
to his heart. He left behind a widow and two 
small children in Reno, Nevada. 
Matt McQuinn, age 27, was in love with his

times; the most of anyone in the theater. He 
was survived by his parents, brothers, and 
girlfriend in Ohio. 
Alex Teves, age 24, was born and spent his 
early years in New Jersey before moving to 
Arizona and then onto Colorado where he 
earned a master’s in psychology the month 
before he was killed. He counseled kids with 
unique learning and emotional challenges at 
Humanex Academy. He was murdered after 
pulling his girlfriend down to safety, leaving 
himself exposed; a bullet hit him in the fore-
head as he whispered comforting words of 
love. He was the oldest of three siblings. 
After his death, Alex’s parents, Caren and 
Tom, began the ‘‘No Notoriety’’ movement 
asking that the media stop concentrating its 
coverage on the shooters for the sake of pub-
lic safety. This movement is widely endorsed 
by law enforcement and on both sides of the 
aisle. 
These individuals inspired me to introduce a 
resolution with my colleagues from the Colo-
rado Congressional Delegation to designate 
July 20th as ‘‘National Heroes Day’’ to honor 
their memory and all those who save lives and 
improve their communities. 
Those whose loved ones have been taken 
by horrific acts of violence, have honored their 
memories with action and now ask us to do 
the same. I will always remember the excep-
tional acts of courage displayed by those in 
Aurora and will continue working with my col-
leagues to enact meaningful reforms to pre-
vent these horrific acts of violence.

INTRODUCTION OF THE JUVENILE 
INCARCERATION REDUCTION ACT 
HON. JOHN LEWIS 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. LEWIS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
introduce the Juvenile Incarceration Reduction 
Act of 2020. 
Our Constitution guarantees a fair process 
in all hearings and equal treatment under the 
law. Even as we make technological ad-
vances, we must ensure that the principals of 
the Constitution are not bypassed for conven-
ience. Most importantly, we cannot delegate 
the duty and responsibility of justice to tech-
nology. 
The use of risk and needs assessment tools 
in the juvenile justice system is widespread. 
According to the National Center for Juvenile 
Justice, 42 states have a statute or probation 
agency policy supporting or requiring the im-
plementation of a risk and needs assessment 
instrument for youth who are justice system in-
volved. These technology tools collect data 
about youth offenders and use this data in 
complex algorithms used to determine how 
likely a young person may become a repeat 
offender. 
Madam Speaker, let me be clear. This 
data—not the young person’s actual actions— 
far too often determine critical decisions such 
as, whether a youth offender will be in custody 
prior to trial, the conditions of a youth offend-
er’s adjudication (conviction), and whether a 
youth offender will be placed in a secure youth 
facility (detention). 
Unfortunately, research shows that these 
‘‘risk 
and 
needs 
assessment 
tools’’ 
disproportionally misclassify youth of color as 
high risk. For example, in my home state of 
Georgia, where the use of risk and needs as-
sessment tools are required by state statute, 
Black youth comprised 69 percent of juveniles 
sentenced to youth prisons and made up 80 
percent of those juveniles who were convicted 
in adult court. 
My legislation, the Juvenile Incarceration 
Reduction Act proposes simple changes that 
will significantly improve the prospects of 
young people in the juvenile justice system. 
This bill will prohibit or limit the use of risk and 
needs assessment tools in federal juvenile 
proceedings in four scenarios: (1) when deter-
mining whether or not a youth offender should 
be charged as an adult; (2) in determining a 
youth offender’s risk of recidivism; (3) deciding 
whether a youth offender should be incarcer-
ated prior to adjudication; and (4) as a sole 
factor in determining a youth offender’s eligi-
bility for recidivism reduction programs or like-
lihood of benefitting from these programs. 
In addition, this legislation would prohibit the 
admission of determinations made by risk and 
needs assessment tools as evidence in trials 
against a justice involved youth. These risk 
and assessment tools clearly exacerbate exist-
ing bias and disparities in our criminal justice 
system. My bill helps introduce parity, equity, 
hope, and opportunity for all—especially mi-
nority—youth offenders. 
Breaking the school to prison pipeline 
means advancing simple policies like the Ju-
venile Incarceration Reduction Act. If Con-
gress can come together to reduce recidivism 
and create opportunities for adults in the crimi-
nal justice system, we have a moral obligation 
to do the same for our young people. 
It is critical that justice-involved youth are 
given a fair opportunity to rehabilitate no mat-
ter their racial or ethnic background. Congress 
must do all we can to correct these systematic 
wrongs, and I urge all of my colleagues to join 
me in supporting this common-sense legisla-
tion.

TRIBUTE TO RIGDON FRANCIS 
CURRIE ON HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Rigdon Francis Currie, a former long- 
time resident of Palo Alto who is celebrating 
his 90th birthday on July 17, 2020. He was 
born in Atlanta, Georgia, to Constance Berry 
Currie and Charles James Currie and he had 
one sibling, Charles James Currie, Jr. 
Georgia born and bred, Rigdon retains the 
elegant accent and perfect manners he 
learned growing up in the South. A Georgia 
Tech and Harvard Business School graduate, 
Rigdon served our country in the Air Force for 
two years, and went on to lead a productive 
and adventure-filled life. His great career at 
Xerox was followed by a productive tenure as 
a venture capitalist, creating hundreds of well- 
paying jobs. Exceedingly generous with his 
time, resources and talent, he mentored 
countless career-seekers, leading them to po-
sitions that ideally suit them. His generosity 
extended to many non-profit organizations, in-
cluding the Pacific Theological School in 
Berkeley where he served on the Board for 
many years. His efforts in Mann County re-
sulted in many miles of roads in Point Reyes 
being free of trash. 
Rigdon is an ardent birder. He has seen 
and identified more than 5,000 species during 
his birdwatching avocation, and travelled to 90 
countries in pursuit of them. He loves sharing 
his love of birds with others, and often carries 
a tripod and telescope to make sure others 
are able to see and appreciate his finds. 
Rigdon is the adoring father of two sons, 
Steven and David, their partners and his 
grandchildren. He is the proud stepfather of 
Chris and Alexis, their spouses and children. 
There is nothing any of them can ask of him 
that he would refuse. The center of his family 
is his wife of 40 years, Trish Johnson. To-
gether they have welcomed hundreds into 
their Palo Alto and Point Reyes homes, cre-
ating havens for those in need. They also cre-
ated parties, hikes, apple pressing and good 
times for friends in need. 
A brilliant business man, an extraordinary 
birder, a most generous philanthropist, a friend 
to so many and a devoted family man, Rigdon 
Currie sets an example for all of us to emu-
late. His ninety years have been filled with ad-
venture and giving to others, and we are a 
better and stronger country because of him 
and his work. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring Rigdon 
Francis Currie as he celebrates his 90th birth-
day, and in wishing him many more years of 
living life to the fullest.

HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today

HONORING MR. LEONEL GARZA 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Mr. Leonel Garza of 
Freer, Texas, who celebrated his birthday 
along with the United States of America this 
past 4th of July. Mr. Garza has a special place 
in Texas’ history for his creation of the Muy 
Grande, the first deer hunting contest in the 
state. 
Leonel Garza is one of 13 children born to 
Lazard and Olivia Garza. Lazard and Olivia 
were migrant workers that traveled across 
Texas and the Midwest to support their large 
family. Leonel married his wife, Elda Garcia, in 
1961 and settled down in Freer, Texas. At that 
time, Leonel made a living selling gas, tires, 
and servicing autos at a small gas station he 
managed named Center Circle Gas Station. 
Here, began the formation of the Muy Grande, 
an unlikely success story. 
Let me preface that Leonel Garza is one of 
the hardest working individuals in South Texas 
and pays extra special attention to the per-
sonal relationships he makes throughout life, 
so it is no surprise that success followed. One 
day in 1965, while Leonel was working at 
Center Circle Gas Station, a man whose car 
had gotten stuck walked in and asked for help. 
Without hesitation, Leonel dropped everything 
and drove forty miles to help tow the car. After 
successfully transporting the car, Leonel re-
fused to accept anything in return and told the 
man ‘‘Just tell you buddies that I’m the hunt-
er’s friend.’’ 
This man happened to be Fred Strong: an 
Outdoors’ Sportswriter. In just a few weeks, 
Leonel’s life would change forever, as Fred 
Strong wrote an article about the ‘‘Hunter’s 
Friend’’ in Freer, Texas. Fred’s story was 
picked up by newspapers all across Texas. 
The small town of Freer became known for its 
whitetail deer and Leonel Garza. All of a sud-
den, the Center Circle Gas Station had a line 
of cars filled with hunters down the street. 
With the overnight fame, Leonel wanted to 
boost his gas sales by creating a deer hunting 
contest, the first of its kind in the state of 
Texas. After realizing that he did not have a 
prize for the first contest, he gave the winner 
the watch off of his own wrist. As this contest 
continued to grow, Leonel named it Muy 
Grande after the size of South Texas deer. 
Now Muy Grande and Leonel Garza are 
known world-wide and the contest has its own 
hall of fame and continues to attract thou-
sands of visitors each year. 
Leonel’s work ethic never ceased, as he 
earned his Real Estate License in 1976 to be 
able to visit all the South Texas farms he grew 
up visiting with his father. In the 1980s, he 
wrote a book called ‘‘The Legend of the Muy 
Grande,’’ and produced three videos called 
‘‘The Legend of the Muy Grande,’’ Part I, II 
and III. Leonel Grande continues to be an ac-
tive member of Freer, Texas, serving on mul-
tiple community organizations and still runs 
the Muy Grande Hunting Village, the largest 
gas station in Freer, Texas. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Leonel Garza is a 
Texas legend whose creation of the first deer 
hunting contest changed the sport of hunting. 
His relentless work ethic, kindness to all, and 
ability to turn overnight fame into something 
long-lasting is well-worthy of recognition. I 
stand here today thanking Mr. Garza for his 
contributions to the world, and I wish him a 
happy belated 80th birthday.

CELEBRATING NELL LONG’S 100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. MO BROOKS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Mrs. Nell Long on the 
occasion of her 100th birthday. 
Nell Long was born in Alabama’s Oak 
Grove community on July 12, 1920. Her family 
settled in Alabama long before that. Nell grew 
up during the Great Depression, so she pos-
sesses a toughness and tenacity that only true 
hardship can produce. Nell worked hard to 
help her family as a girl. She harvested cotton 
with her father and preserved food with her 
mother. Nell went on to finish high school, 
most notably, in the light of an oil lamp—elec-
tricity did not come to Oak Grove until 1935. 
At nineteen, Nell married James Long and 
started a family They had three beautiful chil-
dren. As an active mother, Nell volunteered as 
a substitute teacher, a 4–H Club leader, in the 
PTA, and on local campaigns. She worked in 
her children’s school lunchroom. She did all 
this in addition to helping James on their farm. 
Nell and James were committed to conserva-
tion in Madison County and the fruits of their 
labor can still be seen in our community today. 
In 1986, Nell was named Madison County 
Woman of the Year for dedicated service in 
the community and church. 
After James’ passing, Nell has remained ac-
tive in the community. She is a member of the 
local Homemaker’s Club, Hunt Springs Chap-
ter of the Daughters of the American Revolu-
tion (DAR), and of Owens Cross Roads 
Church of Christ. She has inspired scores with 
her dedication to improving the lives of others. 
Madam Speaker, the Tennessee Valley is 
fortunate to have such an exemplary citizen 
for 100 years. Nell Long’s unwavering hard 
work, strong family values, and unshakable 
faith embody the best of our community. 
I wish Nell and her entire family the very 
best as they celebrate Nell’s centennial birth-
day.

THE 
LIFE 
OF 
REV-
EREND DR. GEORGE W.C. RICH-
ARDSON, JR. 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Reverend Dr. George Washington Carver 
Richardson, Jr., a learned and devoted man of 
faith whose bravery in and commitment to the 
Civil Rights Movement helped guide the moral 
trajectory of Alabama, our nation and the 
world. 
Born in Geiger, Alabama in Sumter County 
to George and Louise Richardson, Reverend 
Richardson moved as a child to Gordo, Ala-
bama where he matriculated through the Pick-
ens County School System. A lifelong man of 
God, Reverend Richardson began preaching 
at the tender age of four and was officially li-
censed to spread God’s word by the age of 
twelve. By sixteen, Reverend Richardson was 
pastoring several small churches throughout 
the Alabama countryside. 
Understanding the unparalleled value of a 
good education, Reverend Richardson at-
tended and received degrees from a number 
of schools including his BA from Selma Uni-
versity; an ETA from Southeastern Bible Col-
lege; Bachelor of Theology from Sunshine 
Bible College, Master of Divinity from Inter-
denominational Theological Institute; Master in 
Religious Education from Sunshine Bible Col-
lege, Doctor of Divinity from New Era Semi-
nary; Doctor of Humane Letters from Faith 
Grant College, Existential Degree from South-
eastern Bible College; and a LCU Degree 
from Insurance Underwriters. He also studied 
at the following schools: Temple University, 
Sanford University, Southern Christian Bible 
College, Alabama Christian College, University 
Bible Institute and Interdenominational Theo-
logical Institute. 
Reverend Richardson spread his God-given 
gifts far and wide, preaching throughout the 
United States and spreading the Gospel. He 
conducted workshops, seminars, revivals and 
special preaching engagements through which 
he met kings, princes, presidents and dig-
nitaries from across the globe. He served as 
Pastor at Maggie Branch Baptist, Union Bap-
tist, Shiloh Baptist and Mt Hebron Baptist. In 
1979 he became Pastor of Hutchinson Mis-
sionary Baptist Church in Montgomery, Ala-
bama where he remained for forty-one years 
until his passing. 
In addition to his work in the church, Rev-
erend Richardson dedicated himself to many 
community 
organizations 
including 
the 
NAACP, SCLC, the Montgomery Improvement 
Association and the Future Leaders of Mont-
gomery County. He also served on the board 
of Star Management, Inc.; as President and 
CEO of SCOM’s Ministry; as Chairman of the 
Board of the Survivor’s Prison Ministry; on the 
Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail 
Advisory Council, and on the board of the 
Covenant Family Ministries, Inc. 
Reverend Richardson played an important 
role in the Civil Rights Movement, belonging to 
an organization known as ‘‘Friendly Breth-
ren’s’’, headed by Dr. F.D. Reese of Selma, 
Alabama. The five members comprising this 
organization were at the forefront of initiating 
the Selma Movement and were later sup-
ported by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the 
SCLC, who were sent in as support and who 
then came to lead the Selma Movement. Rev-
erend Richardson participated in the many 
mass meetings, marches and demonstrations 
comprising the movement, most notable the 
events of Bloody Sunday which would later 
lead to the passage of the pivotal Voting 
Rights Act of 1965. 
Reverend Richardson was also instrumental 
in

Montevallo. In 1967 he moved to Bessemer, 
Alabama where he ran for Mayor, making him 
the first African American to run for a major 
Alabama political office, opening the door for 
many future generations of African Americans 
in Alabama to run for office. As a result of his 
run, he was taken and beaten by members of 
the KKK and left for dead, yet he managed to 
survive and to thrive through the grace of 
God, continuing to fight for truth and justice. 
Reverend Richardson was blessed in mar-
riage to Robbye Johnson Richardson, to 
whom he was joyfully wed for fifty-six years. 
Together, they shared three loving children, 
Pastor 
E. 
Steven 
Richardson 
(Melanie), 
Georgina Richardson-Alexander (George) and 
Robert Richardson; six grandchildren, Erica, 
Steven, Irven, Iven, Tiara and Harmony; two 
extended grandchildren, Summer and Joshua; 
and twelve greatgrandchildren. 
On a personal note, I am very grateful for 
the guidance, prayers and wise counsel that 
Reverend Richardson has provided me over 
the years. Reverend Richardson was a steady 
anchor in the Montgomery community. As pas-
tor of Hutchinson Missionary Baptist Church, 
he provided strong leadership to his congrega-
tion and made a big difference during his over 
fifty years of ministerial and public service. 
Reverend Richardson was a man of faith who 
lead by example May we find comfort in know-
ing that his legacy will live on in the many 
lives that he impacted. 
On behalf of Alabama’s Seventh Congres-
sional District, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in celebrating the exemplary life and accom-
plishments of Reverend Dr. George W.C. 
Richardson, Jr.

HONORING JIM PHILLIPS FOR HIS 
LIFETIME OF SERVICE TO THE 
NORTH COUNTRY AND THE NA-
TION 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Jim Phillips, President and 
CEO of the Canadian/American Border Trade 
Alliance, for his lifetime of service to the North 
Country and the Nation. 
Jim Phillips, a longtime business leader with 
experience in cross border commerce, found-
ed the Canadian/American Border Trade Alli-
ance (Can/Am BTA) in 1992. He recognized 
the need for a bi-national coalition of private 
and public stakeholders to advocate for the 
needs of the users of the U.S.-Canadian bor-
der including trade, transportation, border 
management and tourism. Jim Phillips has 
served as its President and CEO since its 
founding, creating an effective transcontinental 
and bi-national organization with engagement 
from twenty-seven states and all the provinces 
of Canada. The organization he built and 
leads involves a combined network of over 
60,000 companies and organizations including 
producers, shippers, brokers, chambers of 
commerce, universities, bridge and tunnel op-
erators, business and trade corridor organiza-
tions as well as economic development and 
government agencies. 
Under his many years of leadership at the 
Can/Am BTA, Jim Phillips became one of the 
most respected voices in all matters related to 
the U.S.-Canadian border in both countries, 
consistently earning the trust and partnership 
of Canadian and U.S. officials at all levels and 
over many administrations. Throughout the 
years, Jim Phillips has directly contributed to 
many border related advances including mul-
tiple infrastructure investments, the Shared 
Border Accord and enormous progress toward 
U.S.-Canadian customs and regulatory harmo-
nization, among many others. 
In the 21st Congressional District, Jim Phil-
lips was pivotal in working with the North 
Country Chamber of Commerce to develop 
the original concept of the Quebec-New York 
Corridor as a vehicle for bi-national collabora-
tion, and in helping to secure more than $107 
million for the new U.S. border facilities at 
Champlain in 2005. Jim Phillips also played a 
leading role in the original organization of the 
Northern Border Caucus in the U.S. House of 
Representatives, an important bi-partisan plat-
form for northern border advocacy. 
Jim Phillips has made an indelible impact on 
the North Country and our relationship with 
Canada through his decades of experience 
and leadership. On behalf of New York’s 21st 
District, I would like to thank Mr. Phillips for 
his lifetime of service to New York and the 
United States.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
90TH 
BIRTH-
DAY OF PROFESSOR JEROME A. 
COHEN 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Professor Jerome Alan 
Cohen, the Founder and Faculty Director 
Emeritus of the U.S.-Asia Law Institute of the 
New York University School of Law. Professor 
Jerry Cohen is a true champion of human 
rights and the rule of law in China, Hong 
Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea. This month, 
he is celebrating his 90th birthday with his 
family and friends. 
Professor Cohen—or ‘‘Jerry,’’ as he prefers 
to be called by friends, colleagues, and stu-
dents alike—is one of the foremost experts in 
Chinese law and government in the United 
States and internationally. He has provided 
sage advice and wise counsel to international 
leaders, U.S. government officials, and Mem-
bers of Congress throughout his illustrious ca-
reer, including in testimony to the Congres-
sional-Executive Commission on China of 
which I currently serve as Chair. Not long out 
of Yale Law School, Jerry was a law clerk to 
Chief Justice Earl Warren and to Justice Felix 
Frankfurter, of the U.S. Supreme Court. Jerry 
also was an Assistant U.S. Attorney here in 
Washington, D.C. 
Jerry’s extraordinary career on China began 
in the 1960s while he was teaching at Boalt 
School of Law at University of California 
Berkeley. A grant to UC Berkeley from the 
Rockefeller Foundation allowed him to begin 
his study of Mandarin Chinese. Later, he cre-
ated the East Asia Legal Studies Association 
at Harvard School of Law, where he would go 
on to teach for 17 years. 
In 2018, Harvard Law alumni established 
the Jerome A. and Joan L. Cohen Professor-
ship of Law at Harvard Law School to honor 
his pioneering work. His students over the 
years include prominent legal scholars, law-
yers, law professors, journalists, and dip-
lomats, such as former Taiwanese president, 
Ma Ying-jeou and former U.S. Ambassador to 
China Clark Randt, Jr. 
Jerry and a group of colleagues were also 
early advocates in encouraging the United 
States to engage with the People’s Republic 
of China. During his first trip to China in 1972, 
Jerry met with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, 
and, years later accompanied Senator Ted 
Kennedy to Beijing to meet with Deng 
Xiaoping. 
Jerry has been an energetic advocate for 
human rights in China and critic of the Chi-
nese government. At the US-Asia Law Insti-
tute, he has developed programs on criminal 
justice reform in China with Chinese counter-
parts. Jerry also has led the way in supporting 
the release of political prisoners in China, in-
cluding John T. Downey, a former Yale Col-
lege classmate and CIA agent who was re-
leased in 1973 after more than 20 years’ im-
prisonment in China. He played a crucial role 
in the release of Annette Lu, who would go to 
be Taiwanese vice president under Chen 
Shui-bian. Jerry also has advocated for and 
helped secure the release of many Chinese 
political prisoners, including Song Yongyi and 
Chen Guangcheng. 
Professor Jerry Cohen has not only partici-
pated in the history of U.S.-China relations, he 
has shaped it. All those who advocate for 
human rights and the rule of law in China owe 
him a great debt of gratitude. I thank Pro-
fessor Cohen for his exemplary service for hu-
manity.

Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Lillie Davis of Willow 
Springs, Missouri for her heroic actions that 
helped save the life of her father, Seth Davis. 
Lillie’s father has suffered from epilepsy 
since he was a child. Because of this, Lillie 
was trained for emergency situations at a 
young age. When her father went into an epi-
leptic seizure one spring morning, 7-year-old 
Lillie knew just what to do to help him. She 
acted with poise and bravery and went 
through the proper motions to save her dad. 
She calmly called her mother, who called 9-1- 
1, and then helped talk Lillie through the mo-
tions. Lillie made sure her dad was still breath-
ing, then turned his head to make sure he 
wasn’t holding his breath. She even opened 
the back door so the first responders could 
quickly enter upon arrival. 
First responders stated that they have never 
seen a young child know just what to do in an 
emergency like this. I commend Lillie for her 
acts of bravery that helped save her father’s 
life. She is a true hero! 
For her heroic actions, it is my great pleas-
ure to celebrate Miss Lillie Davis today before 
the U.S. House of Representatives.

SHERRY ELLEBRACHT 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Sherry Ellebracht, who 
after 22 years working for the Regional Trans-
portation District (RTD), is retiring. Sherry’s 
dedication to transportation for the State of 
Colorado has made a significant impact which 
will last for years to come. 
In 1998, Sherry joined RTD’s government 
relations department working to engage with 
local, state and federal leaders on issues re-
lated to transit and transportation in Colorado. 
In her role, Sherry managed all state and 
federal activities and monitored proposed leg-
islation in the Colorado state legislature and in 
the U.S. House and Senate. At the federal 
level, one of her primary responsibilities in-
volves coordinating the agency’s annual ap-
propriations requests and authorizations in the 
transportation funding bills. In addition, she 
monitored all municipal activities and worked 
with the RTD local government liaison to stay 
abreast of local issues, including representing 
RTD on the Colorado Association of Transit 
Agencies (CASTA) Board of Directors and 
even serving as President of the organization. 
She has been a part of RTD for the passage 
of two significant public votes, 4A for the SE 
corridor and FasTracks, as well as FFGAs for 
the Southeast ($525 million), West ($308 mil-
lion) and Eagle P3 lines ($1.03 billion) and 
over $257 million in federal funding for Union 
Station—a total of close $2 billion in federal 
funding. 
Outside of her work at RTD, Sherry is a 
member of the Alpha Delta Pi sorority alum-
nae and has held various positions in that or-
ganization. In 2008, she was nominated for 
the 
Denver 
Area 
Panhellenic 
Alumnae 
Achievement Award. Through her work with 
RTD and other groups, Sherry has created nu-
merous partnerships and helped improve out-
comes in the transit community and for the 
quality of life of the residents of Colorado. I 
congratulate Sherry on a lifetime of service 
and wish her all the best in retirement.

HONORING THE LEADERSHIP AND 
LEGACY OF CHAIRWOMAN NITA 
M. LOWEY 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I want to 
recognize the remarkable leadership of Chair-
woman NITA M. LOWEY. NITA has made the 
nation, and the world, a far better place be-
cause of her commitment to the Appropria-
tions Committee, and her outstanding achieve-
ments will forever be honored and celebrated 
here in the Congress. 
I cherish the 25 years we have spent to-
gether fighting for expanded access to wom-
en’s health, the inclusion of women in NIH 
clinical trials, increased investment in early 
childhood education, adequate worker protec-
tions, and so much more. Beyond her profes-
sionalism, dedication, and leadership, NITA is 
genuine and compassionate. As she has for 
many of our other colleagues, she has been 
there for me in times of need. I will miss see-
ing her in the halls of Congress and on the 
Appropriations Committee, but our friendship 
endures. 
In honor of her outstanding legacy, I include 
in the RECORD the Chairwoman’s farewell re-
marks to the House Appropriations Committee 
on July 15, 2020, the final day of markups for 
the 116th Congress: 
Good morning, everyone. As we begin our 
final day of consideration of the FY21 spend-
ing bills, I’d like to thank you all for your 
kind words and well wishes and ask you to 
indulge me in just a few more reflections. 
I came to Congress in 1989, one of just 31 
women in the House and Senate, and to this 
Committee in 1993 alongside only six other 
women on the 64-member panel. 
This body is better for the 100 women serv-
ing in the 116th Congress and for the many 
women in this room today. It’s my honor to 
address the full Committee for my final time 
as the first woman Chair. 
You know, it’s ironic that back in 1993, I 
had to choose between serving on Appropria-
tions or Ways and Means. And today we 
mark up my final Appropriations bills in the 
Ways and Means Committee room. 
I chose Appropriations because I believed 
it was the best place to give more people a 
better chance at a better life. After nearly 30 
years on Committee, I still believe that. 
In fact, nowhere else in Congress could I 
have advanced such a diverse range of prior-
ities. In the days of congressionally directed 
spending—something I hope you all restore— 
I brought home hundreds of millions to help 
my constituents directly, from transpor-
tation hubs and commuter services, bridge 
and road safety, early learning and health 
centers, to economic development and job 
training, school safety, senior centers, flood-
ing relief, and more. 
Of course, without those projects, I have 
created new programs, including one that 
protects vulnerable nonprofits at a time of 
rising anti-Semitism and hate, like those in 
my district surrounding the community that 
experienced a tragic attack at a Hanukah 
party last year. 
Nationally, we advanced the .08 blood alco-
hol content standard for drunk driving that 
has saved countless lives. Following Sep-
tember 11th, we funded the new Department 
of Homeland Security, and I have fought 
hard for New York’s fair share of its invest-
ments in our preparedness and response ca-
pabilities. 
I am so proud of tremendous accomplish-
ments for women’s health—from protecting 
and expanding access to family planning 
here and abroad, to gains in research equity 
and breast cancer research and securing con-
traceptive coverage for federal employees 
that led to dramatically expanded coverage 
for women today. And, let me just say, we 
will never go back to the days when NIH ex-
cluded women from clinical trials-when even 
the lab rats were all male. 
Among many education achievements, we 
established the first federal afterschool pro-
grams that have grown to a billion dollar in-
vestment today and served millions of chil-
dren and families. And, it was certainly fun 
to bring Bert and Ernie to a hearing to help 
save PBS’s federal funding. 
Despite my passion for these priorities, I 
bucked conventional wisdom to become 
Ranking Member on the State and Foreign 
Operations subcommittee rather than the 
Labor-HHS-Education subcommittee. I can-
not overstate my commitment to our respon-
sible investments through our foreign aid 
bill that make the world better, safer, and 
healthier while improving the security of 
generations here at home. 
At the heart of that work is providing a 
basic education to the world’s children so 
that they may thrive and prosper, be 
healthier and resilient to dangerous influ-
ences, and create a more stable world. So 
what a moving and rewarding honor it was to 
have my dear friends Ranking Member 
Granger and Ranking Member Rogers recog-
nize my work on international basic edu-
cation by naming that program for me last 
week in the State and foreign operations 
markup. 
While my time as the Chairwoman of this 
Committee has been short, our achievements 
together will have a lasting impact. 
Despite our differences and disagreements, 
or perhaps because of them, we ultimately 
recognize that the power of the purse—one of 
the most important entrusted to us by the 
Constitution—requires us to build consensus 
and put the interests of the American people 
first. 
I took the Appropriations gavel in January 
2019, in the middle of the longest partial gov-
ernment shutdown in U.S. history. 
Not only did we reach bipartisan agree-
ment to reopen government, we cleared all 12 
fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills through 
committee and 10 off the House floor before 
the Senate introduced a single bill, and we 
enacted all 12 before the end of the calendar 
year. 
As appropriators, we lead by example, with 
common sense and deliberation. 
Our ability to transcend party differences 
and make hard choices within the con-
straints of limited funding makes us worthy 
of the privilege to hash out the biggest bat-
tles of the day. 
Through virtual and remote work and in 
masks and gloves today, this Committee is 
confronting twin crises—one most of us 
never expected, the other only the willfully 
indifferent could not have anticipated. 
In recent months, we have led the way to 
invest trillions to stem the spread of a global 
pandemic and mitigate the worst of its dev-
astating economic impacts. 
The fiscal year 2021 appropriations bills 
continue those efforts even as we address 
systemic racism, a crisis that has reached a 
boiling point in recent weeks. 
We have acted on the urgent need for 
meaningful police reform and economic de-
velopment in disadvantaged communities 
that is fundamental to a more just and equi-
table society that lives up to our highest val-
ues and aspirations. 
We are living through a time of heightened 
cynicism and polarization, of suffering and 
pain, and great uncertainty, with too little 
compassion and leadership from some at the 
highest levels of power. 
The old adage you might have heard me 
say a time or two—that in Washington there 
are Republicans, Democrats, and appropri-
ators—is perhaps more important now than 
ever. 
My parting request to you is this: do not 
succumb to the pervasive partisanship that 
permeates what can feel like all aspects of 
our professional—and even sometimes our 
personal—lives. 
Beyond keeping government’s doors open 
and lights on, conduct robust oversight and 
demand accountability and transparency on 
the use of taxpayer dollars, defend our con-
stitutional prerogatives against Executive 
Overreach regardless of who occupies the 
White House or the Speaker’s office. Always 
strive to use the power of the purse to 
unlock the full potential of this nation. 
Over the next weeks and months, I will 
continue that hard work with all of you, who 
are at the heart of what makes this the best 
Committee in Congress. If you’re looking for

a goodbye gift, I would love to get all our 
bills done by the end of the year. 
To the other members leaving Congress at 
the end of this term—my fellow New Yorker 
and dear friend Jose Serrano, Pete Vis-
closky, Tom Graves, Martha Roby, and Will 
Hurd—thank you for your service, and I wish 
you all the very best. 
To my subcommittee chairs—Marcy, Pete, 
Jose´, Rosa, David, Lucille, Sanford, Betty, 
Tim, Debbie, and Mike—you have made your 
mark not just on your bills and on this Com-
mittee. Thank you for your steady, effective 
leadership and friendship. 
Kay, I could not ask for a better Ranking 
Member. We took turns as Chair and Rank-
ing Member on State and Foreign Operations 
and have shown time and again that women 
get things done. I will deeply miss our part-
nership and you personally. 
I would be remiss not to mention former 
Committee 
Chairs 
Natcher, 
Livingston, 
Young, Lewis, Obey, Rogers, and Freling-
huysen who showed me what it takes to do 
this job well. 
None of us could fulfill our mandate with-
out the support of excellent staff. All of the 
successes I’ve recounted today and more are 
also the achievements of many others. 
To the staff in both the Committee and my 
Congressional office: For a year and a half as 
Chairwoman, six years as Ranking Member— 
and for some, a whole lot longer—I have ben-
efitted immeasurably from your wisdom, 
counsel, tireless commitment, and, on more 
than a few occasions, from your techno-
logical prowess. 
One of the benefits of being chair is having 
the largest and most experienced staff on the 
Hill. From all of our subcommittee staff led 
by clerks Martha Foley, Bob Bonner, Becky 
Leggieri, Jaime Shimek, Matt Smith, Darek 
Newby, Rita Culp, Stephen Steigleder, Robin 
Juliano, Matt Washington, Lisa Molyneux, 
Steve Marchese, and Joe Carlile to Adam 
Berg, Jason Gray, Adam Wilson, Tom Tuck-
er, 
Anna 
Hansen, 
Mike 
Burns, 
Gloria 
Nlewedim, and Malachi White in the front 
office, I am grateful for everything you do to 
make this the best committee in Congress. 
My Congressional office staff in Wash-
ington, including Fae Rabin, Wendy Coursen, 
Liz Gauthier, Jane Richter, Matt Pastore, 
Steve Brenner, and Justin Barnes, have been 
invaluable during my final appropriations 
markups, as always. 
I especially note my gratitude for the ex-
traordinary work of several staffers with 
whom I work most closely: Staff Director 
and Clerk Shalanda Young, Deputy Staff Di-
rector Chris Bigelow—an alum of my per-
sonal office, Communications Director Evan 
Hollander, Legislative Director Dana Acton, 
Deputy Chief of Staff Kelly Healton, and my 
Chief of Staff for the last 15 years, Elizabeth 
Stanley. 
I appreciate the great contributions of 
former staff, including chiefs of staff—Scott 
Fleming, Howard Wolfson, Matthew Traub 
and Clare Coleman—and legislative teams 
led by Jim Townsend, Mark Isaac, Jenny 
Luray, Heather Howard, Beth Tritter, and 
Jean Doyle. At the committee, I valued the 
expertise of former Staff Director David 
Pomerantz, Deputy Staff Director Lesley 
Turner, and Communications Director Matt 
Dennis who also served in my personal office. 
I have enjoyed seeing so many current and 
former staffers grow in your careers, get 
married, have children, and even some of you 
retire before me. You will always be a part of 
the Lowey family. 
It has been the honor of my life to serve as 
Chairwoman of this committee. While I’ll be 
sad to hand over the gavel, I know that all of 
us—members and staff—will live by the un-
derlying principle that has guided our work 
together: do the best we can to make life 
better for the most people we can. 
Thank you.

HONORING JUDGE OLA M. LEWIS 
HON. DAVID ROUZER 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the memory and life of a trailblazing 
judge from Brunswick County, North Carolina, 
who was passionate and fearless in her com-
mitment to justice and the law while also 
showing great compassion for those who 
needed help to get their lives back on track. 
Sadly, Judge Ola M. Lewis passed away late 
last year. This past Saturday, July 11th, would 
have been her 55th birthday. 
The daughter of a paratrooper of the 82nd 
Airborne Division and two public school prin-
cipals, Judge Lewis learned early in life the 
value of education, hard work, and service to 
one’s community. She grew up in Spring Lake, 
North Carolina, and soon moved with her fam-
ily to Brunswick County. Like her father, she 
graduated from Fayetteville State University 
and then in 1990 earned a law degree from 
North Carolina Central Law School. After a 
stint in private practice she returned home to 
Brunswick County to serve in the District Attor-
ney’s Office. 
Just two years later, in 1993, Judge Lewis 
was appointed district court judge becoming 
the youngest serving district court judge in 
North Carolina. She spent seven years as a 
district court judge before being appointed to 
serve as a ‘‘special Superior Court judge’’, 
traveling around 21 North Carolina counties. 
Her motto: ‘‘have gavel, will travel’’. 
She made history as both the first woman 
and the first African-American judge in North 
Carolina’s Fourteenth Judicial District. She is 
the longest serving female judge in the history 
of North Carolina. 
Judge Lewis has left a real impact in our 
community that will continue to be felt. She 
fostered the creation of specialized drug treat-
ment and mental health courts, which have 
helped countless those that need it the help 
necessary to put themselves back on the right 
track. Her drug court program became a na-
tional template that has been replicated to 
help others struggling with addiction and men-
tal health challenges nationwide. 
She was one of the first to see and respond 
to the scourge of the opioid addiction that has 
ravaged the nation, co-founding in 2017 the 
Brunswick County Opioid Addiction Task 
Force. She encouraged Governor Roy Cooper 
to declare the growing opioid addiction crisis a 
statewide public health emergency. 
In recognition of her contributions and dedi-
cation to our local communities and to our 
state, she was awarded the Order of the Long 
Leaf Pine by Governor Cooper, the Old North 
State Award by Governor Beverly Purdue, and 
the Dogwood Award by Attorney General Josh 
Stein. 
Madam Speaker, Judge Ola Lewis leaves a 
legacy for which her wonderful family, col-
leagues and friends can be proud. Hers was 
a great life of service to the benefit of every 
citizen, our communities, and our state. 
HONORING THE RIO GRANDE VAL-
LEY MEMORIAL POST 8788 VET-
ERANS OF FOREIGN WARS 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the Rio Grande Valley 
Memorial Post 8788 Veterans of Foreign Wars 
for their incredible 50-year record of serving 
our veterans and the community of McAllen, 
Texas. 
The Rio Grande Valley Memorial Post 8788 
Veterans of Foreign Wars celebrated their 
50th anniversary in March of this year, but I 
am here to recognize Post 8788’s Honor 
Guard, which was established in the late 
1970’s. 
Honor Guards volunteer to give proper cere-
monial funerals to veterans who die. The term 
‘‘Honor guard’’ is used because the veterans 
feel it is a great honor to provide their fellow 
veterans with military funeral services and pay 
their final respects. They feel they have been 
blessed to survive the horrors of war and this 
is their way of giving back to their fellow broth-
ers and sisters. 
Although I do not have the records for all of 
the services conducted since the post’s incep-
tion, Post 8788 has conducted 367 services 
since 2018. Altogether, these services are the 
compilation of 7,418 volunteer hours and 
6,035 miles traveled to perform the military fu-
nerals. You can imagine these numbers are 
much larger given the fact that this represents 
only 2.5 years out of a 40-year history. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today to ac-
knowledge the decades’ long achievements of 
the Rio Grande Valley Memorial Post 8788 
Veterans of Foreign Wars. Each member of 
the Rio Grande Valley Memorial Post 8788 
Veterans of Foreign Wars is an incredible 
leader in our community, and their legacy will 
no doubt inspire public service and vol-
unteerism of future generations.

SUPPORTING THE DBE PROGRAM 
HON. ANTHONY G. BROWN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to say a few words in support of the 
DBE program. This program helps firms 
owned by women and minorities are included 
as partners in helping build and maintain our 
nation’s 
transportation 
infrastructure. 
The 
chairman and many of my colleagues have 
presented the devastating statistics that dem-
onstrate how far we must go before we abol-
ish business discrimination based on race and 
gender. I would like to highlight some of the 
voices behind those statistics. In a recent 
study in my home state of Maryland, the au-
thors conducted in depth interviews with busi-
ness owners from across the state on this 
very issue. When asked about the persistence 
of discrimination, one business owner said: 
‘‘My business card had my picture on it, and 
so someone said to me, ‘Oh, whatever you 
do, don’t put your picture on your card.’ And 
I said, ‘Why?’ . . . They said, ‘Because you’ll

wise, a woman business owner explained: I 
have gone on interviews where I am in . . . 
the running, three people, final cut. And I have 
spoken to this person about the job and they 
were questioning me about my skill, my every-
thing, why I bid the job. I’m looking at this per-
son as, ‘What do you mean why, I bid this 
job? . . . I’m in the business of making 
money’ . . . and he said to me, ‘Well, you 
know, women just simply shouldn’t be here.’ ’’ 
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Disparity

must do better. We can do better. And the

tools in our arsenal.

INTRODUCTION OF THE LEAD 
ABATEMENT FOR FAMILIES ACT 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to introduce the Lead Abatement for 
Families Act along with my colleague, AYANNA 
PRESSLEY. 
It is a national scandal that more than ten 
million homes in the United States still get 
their water from lead pipes. I am introducing 
this bill to direct the Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development to identify lead pipes in 
our country’s public and federally subsidized 
housing and provide grants to replace them. 
A 2015 study determined that by the third 
grade, children in Chicago with even small 
amounts of lead in their blood were more than 
32% more likely to fail standardized tests. One 
fifth of U.S. children with lead poisoning are 
participants in the Housing Choice Voucher 
Program, so HUD’s role in removing lead 
pipes are crucially important. It is vitally impor-
tant that Congress address this injustice by 
giving HUD the mandate and the funds to 
quickly eliminate this public health hazard. 
Let us be clear—this is a racial justice 
issue. Black and brown communities like mine 
are disproportionately affected by lead pipes, 
and 
our 
neighborhoods 
suffer 
the 
con-
sequences. 
I urge this body to advance this legislation 
that helps ensure safe drinking water for all by 
getting lead pipes out of public and federally 
assisted housing.

IN 
MEMORY 
OF 
REVEREND 
GEORGE 
WASHINGTON 
CARVER 
RICHARDSON, JR. 
HON. MARTHA ROBY 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mrs. ROBY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and legacy of a beloved Ala-
bamian, Reverend George Washington Carver 
Richardson, Jr. Dr. Richardson passed away 
on Thursday, July 9, 2020. Dr. Richardson 
was deeply devoted to the Lord, a loving hus-
band and father, and a strong voice for the 
community. He will be dearly missed by all. 
Dr. Richardson was born in Geiger, Ala-
bama, to George and Louise Richardson. At 
the early age of four years old, Dr. Richardson 
began preaching. He spent his early years 
preparing to enter Ministry, and he went on to 
earn his BA Degree, Bachelor of Theology, 
Masters of Divinity, Masters in Religious Edu-
cation, Doctor of Divinity, Doctor of Humane 
Letters, Existential Degree, and L.C.U. Degree 
all from various institutes. 
Dr. Richardson’s faithfulness to spreading 
the Gospel never wavered as he traveled 
across the United States, preaching to crowds, 
conducting workshops, and leading seminars. 
He served as Pastor to several churches, but 
he led the Hutchinson Missionary Baptist 
Church for almost forty years. 
Not only was Dr. Richardson devoted to the 
Church, but also to the community. He worked 
towards the betterment of mankind his entire 
life through his involvement with the Civil 
Rights Movement. Dr. Richardson served on 
several Civic Boards and Committees, such as 
the SCLC, NAACP, and Montgomery Improve-
ment Association. He also helped spearhead 
the Selma Movement from beginning to end, 
participating in marches and demonstrations in 
the area, including Bloody Sunday. 
In 1967, Dr. Richardson moved to Bes-
semer, Alabama and became the first African 
American to campaign for a major political of-
fice, running for the Office of Mayor. His cam-
paign paved the way for future African Amer-
ican leaders to take leadership positions in the 
city of Bessemer. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Reverend George 
Washington Carver Richardson, Jr. He will be 
greatly missed by all whom he encountered, 
and his remarkable legacy will be remembered 
for years to come.

HONORING TAMMY SHEPHERD’S 
RETIREMENT 
HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Mrs. Tammy Shep-
herd, who is retiring from the Columbia County 
Chamber of Commerce, a thriving organization 
serving a notable community in the Tenth 
Congressional District, which I have the honor 
of representing. 
Twelve years ago, Tammy Shepherd joined 
the organization as the Director of Programs 
and soon after received a promotion to Vice 
President of Business Development. In 2010, 
she earned the position of President and 
CEO, and over the past decade, she has es-
tablished the Chamber as a leading business 
organization representing companies of all 
sizes throughout the region. Under her faithful 
watch, the Chamber has grown to nearly 
1,000 members, has twice earned the highest 
distinction of 5-Star Accreditation through the 
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, has formed the 
Columbia County Chamber Foundation, as 
well as a holding company and a Political Ac-
tion Committee, and most recently, has 
opened a second location in the heart of Co-
lumbia County’s growth. 
Madam Speaker, in addition to all this, 
Tammy has served on the Board of Directors 
for the SRS Community Reuse Organization, 
Georgia Association of Chamber of Commerce 
Executives, Alliance for Fort Gordon, and 
Georgia Southern Athletic Foundation. Madam

JULY VETERAN OF THE MONTH 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to honor the First District of 
Oklahoma’s July Veteran of the Month, Major 
Ralph Wilson. 
A pilot in the United States Air Force, Major 
Ralph Wilson honorably served our nation for 
twenty years. Upon returning home from serv-
ice, Ralph continued to serve at the Tinker Air 
Force Base for twenty years. 
Major Ralph Wilson served in both World 
War II and the Korean War. He flew sixty-nine 
missions in World War II and fifty in the Ko-
rean War. Major Wilson flew unarmed recon-
naissance missions in Korea. He is the recipi-
ent of numerous awards and is a decorated 
airman. When asked about his service by the 
Tulsa World, he explained, ‘‘I never consid-
ered myself a hero, I just did my part.’’ Major 
Ralph Wilson served his country selflessly, 
and he now carries himself with dignity and 
humility in his community. He is certainly part 
of the ‘‘Greatest Generation.’’ 
In addition to working at the Tinker Air 
Force Base in Oklahoma, Wilson developed a 
hobby of woodworking and volunteered with 
local schools helping children build projects. 
He answered the call to defend freedom 
across the globe and sacrificed whatever was 
necessary in the name of that noble cause. It 
is my honor to recognize Major Ralph Wilson 
as the 1st Congressional District of Okla-
homa’s July Veteran of the Month.

INTRODUCTION OF HOUSE 
RESOLUTION 1045 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
this past Saturday marked the 25th anniver-
sary of the genocide that took place at 
Srebrenica. In 1992, following Bosnia and 
Herzegovina’s declaration of independence 
from Yugoslavia, Bosnian Serb forces, also 
called the Army of Republika Srpska, attacked 
Eastern Bosnia in order to unify and secure 
Serb territory. During this struggle for control, 
those Bosnian Serb forces committed crimes 
of ethnic cleansing and the systematic murder 
of the non-Serb population. Over 8,000 Bos-
nian men and boys were systematically exe-
cuted at Srebrenica in July 1995. 
The House of Representatives rightfully 
classified the atrocities that happened in 
Srebrenica and other policies of aggression

and ethnic cleansing by Serb forces during the 
Bosnian War as genocide in 2005, and again 
in 2015. Yet the denial and diminishing of 
what happened persists in some populations. 
During my time in Congress, I have had the 
opportunity to meet the mothers of the boys 
and men killed during the war and have heard 
their stories of grief and sorrow. 
As a co-chair of the Congressional Caucus 
on Bosnia, I have also seen how the country 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina has overcome 
many obstacles and developed since declaring 
independence. Though significant progress 
has been achieved, there is more work left be 
done. Peace is fragile in this region and the 
International community must continue its ef-
forts to ensure that Bosnia and Herzegovina 
remains a peaceful and inclusive country. 
Earlier this week, I introduced a Resolution 
honoring those who lost their lives during the 
worst atrocity on European soil since World 
War II. The Resolution is also a testament of 
support for the Bosnian people’s aspiration for 
greater Euro-Atlantic integration. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
genocide 
at 
Srebrenica serves as a reminder of the con-
sequences that occur when the international 
community fails to react to actions of military 
force. I stand with the victims and survivors of 
the Srebrenica genocide and believe this trag-
edy should never be forgotten.

HONORING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE FOUNDING OF IN-
DIANA WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the centennial year of a 
tremendous university in my district, Indiana 
Wesleyan University (IWU). IWU is a private 
university that was founded in 1920 on three 
basic pillars: academic excellence, Christ-cen-
tered education and global worldview. 
It is a testament to the academic excellence 
of a school to achieve the success that IWU 
has for one hundred years. Indiana Wesleyan 
University is a Christian comprehensive uni-
versity of The Wesleyan Church. The Univer-
sity was founded in 1920 as Marion College 
before changing its name to Indiana Wesleyan 
University in 1988. IWU committed to liberal 
arts and professional education. Nearly 3,000 
students are enrolled in traditional programs 
on the University’s 350-acre residential cam-
pus in Marion. Most buildings on the Marion 
campus have been built in the past 25 years, 
so students live and learn in a visually striking 
environment with well-appointed residence 
halls and academic facilities, all on a campus 
that is only an hour away from both Fort 
Wayne and Indianapolis. 
IWU offers more than 80 undergraduate de-
grees, 38 graduate degrees and 5 doctorate 
degrees and students represent more than 80 
Christian denominations and 10 foreign coun-
tries. Indiana Wesleyan has received national 
attention for its innovative adult education pro-
gram, which began in 1985. Over 10,000 adult 
learners attend classes at education centers in 
Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio, and online. 
In its first one hundred years, IWU has pro-
duced over 80,000 degreed alumni. IWU has 
a 78 percent retention rate for those starting 
as college freshmen. The Indiana Wesleyan 
Wildcats have won 5 national championship ti-
tles in the National Association of Intercolle-
giate Athletics (NAIA), including 2 NAIA na-
tional championships from the record-setting 
2006 to 2007 women’s basketball team that 
went 38–0 and the 2012–2013 women’s bas-
ketball team. IWU has won an additional 3 
NAIA national championships in 2014, 2016 
and 2018 in men’s basketball. 
Congratulations to Indiana Wesleyan Uni-
versity for a century of success thanks to the 
hard working and dedicated faculty, staff, ad-
ministration, board members, students and 
alumni. Hoosiers of the Fifth District and be-
yond are grateful and look forward to another 
century of extraordinary leadership and edu-
cational opportunities.

IN HONOR OF STEPHANIE BARON 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Stephanie A. Baron, who is being 
honored for her work as the Veterans of For-
eign War (VFW) New Hampshire State Presi-
dent over the past year. VFW works to ensure 
that all veterans are recognized for their serv-
ice and sacrifice on behalf of our nation. Presi-
dent Baron served during an unprecedented 
year. Faced with the COVID–19 pandemic, 
she helped VFW continue fulfilling its mission 
by facilitating the organization’s transition to 
online programming and even helped conduct 
their first Virtual Convention. 
A resident of Merrimack, President Baron is 
a devoted mother and grandmother who is 
deeply committed to supporting veterans in 
her community. When she is not busy improv-
ing the lives of veterans in our state, President 
Baron works for herself as a nail technician. 
Her 
grandfather, 
Adam 
P. 
Plynkofsky, 
served in the United States Army in World 
War II from 1941 to 1944, receiving the three 
Bronze Stars and the Purple Heart. His sac-
rifices shaped President Baron’s passion for 
giving back to veterans and their families. 
Since joining the VFW Auxiliary, President 
Baron has diligently served the organization in 
many capacities. She has held roles as Senior 
Vice President, Department Scholarship Chair-
man, Youth Activities chair, and Auxiliary 
Chaplain. She is a Life member of the VFW 
National Home for Children and a member of 
the American Legion. 
On behalf of all of my constituents in New 
Hampshire’s First Congressional District, I 
want to thank Stephanie Baron for her long-
standing devotion to our state and our Vet-
erans. I congratulate her on a successful term 
as State President and thank her for all that 
she has done, and will continue to do, to sup-
port Granite State veterans. 
HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
DEANDREE WATSON 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the memory of the late DeAndree Wat-
son, a young public servant and community 
advocate for the city of Detroit. 
DeAndree was born and raised in Detroit, 
and product of Detroit Public Schools, grad-
uating from Cass Technical High School in 
2008. DeAndree went on to attend the Univer-
sity of Michigan, serving as Class President 
for the 2012 graduating class, graduating with 
the highest honors. DeAndree began his com-
mitment to service and the city of Detroit as 
an intern for former councilman Charles Pugh 
before rising through the ranks to serve as 
Policy Analyst for Detroit City Council and Dis-
trict One Councilman James Tate for six 
years. Through this role, DeAndree helped 
lead critical legislation for the 13th Congres-
sional District in Northwest Detroit and across 
the city. 
DeAndree dedicated his life to serving resi-
dents, a priority that was reflected in his daily 
work. His commitment to serving residents 
went beyond policy, and included supporting 
numerous associations, block clubs, and orga-
nizations with critical services whenever he 
could. DeAndree held several roles in his 
young professional career, not only serving as 
a Policy Analyst, but also serving as the Presi-
dent and leader of the New Leaders Council, 
a young progressive coalition of talented rising 
leaders across Detroit. His planned journey 
back to the University of Michigan to pursue 
his Law Degree would have undoubtedly set 
him on a path to further his ongoing work to 
serve the city of Detroit and our district. 
DeAndree’s hard work and dedication to work-
ing on behalf of the people of Detroit was un-
matched. He was known for his profes-
sionalism, attention to details, and the love he 
held for the City of Detroit. DeAndree was a 
bright and affable rising star with limitless po-
tential ahead of him. We are stunned and sad-
dened by his sudden and tragic death. 
DeAndree Watson embodied the spirit of 
community, leadership and Detroit. His pres-
ence will truly be missed. Please join me in 
honoring his memory and this great loss to our 
community.

tive Director of the Jefferson County Public 
Health Department for receiving the American 
College of Preventive Medicine’s Distinguished 
Service Award, recognizing his more than 30 
years of service in the public health sector. 
Additionally, in September 2019, Dr. Johnson 
also received the Lifetime Achievement Award

July 16, 2020 
During his tenure at Jeffco Public Health, 
Dr. Johnson has been instrumental in improv-
ing the quality of life and health outcomes for 
local residents and communities. Among his 
notable accomplishments is his work to help 
write and pass the Colorado Public Health Act 
in 2008, which requires use of assessments to 
determine population health and systemwide 
capacity issues; develops a five-year state and 
local public health improvement plan based on 
assessment results; and engages communities 
to increase and improve the availability and 
quality of public health services. The goal of 
the bill is to ensure that core public health 
services are available to every person in Colo-
rado. 
Under Johnson’s leadership, Jeffco has 
been one of the healthiest areas in the state 
with lower teen birth rates, lower sexually- 
transmitted infections, access to parks and 
recreation, 
safe 
food 
and 
access 
to 
healthcare. Jeffco is doing better in some 
areas than Colorado and the country. 
Dr. Johnson also worked to establish the 
Colorado School of Public Health, comprised 
of the University of Colorado Anschutz Med-
ical Campus, Colorado State University and 
the University of Northern Colorado. It is the 
first accredited and only collaborative school 
of public health in the region. 
Dr. Johnson planned to retire in June 2020 
but in an effort to maintain continuity for the 
public health workforce on the frontlines of the 
pandemic and a population facing a health cri-
sis, announced he would delay his retirement 
to help see JCPH and Jefferson County resi-
dents through this unprecedented time. In re-
tirement, Johnson was looking forward to 
spending time with grandchildren, and remain-
ing active in his church. We appreciate his 
sacrifice and ongoing service to our commu-
nity during this crisis and congratulate Dr. 
Mark Johnson on a lifetime of service to public 
health and to our community.

HONORING THE SERGEANT BENITO 
ALANIZ POST 7473 VETERANS OF 
FOREIGN WARS 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 16, 2020 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the Honor Guard at Ser-
geant Benito Alaniz Post 7473 Veterans of 
Foreign Wars, located in Elsa, Texas. The 
Honor Guard was established in the early 
2000s. 
Honor Guards volunteer to give proper cere-
monial funerals to veterans who die. The term 
‘‘Honor guard’’ is used because the veterans 
feel it is a great honor to provide their fellow 
veterans with military funeral services and pay 
their final respects. They feel they have been 
blessed to survive the horrors of war and give 
back to their fellow brothers and sisters. 
Since its inception, Post 7473’s Honor 
Guard has performed over 1,800 services. 
The majority of volunteers are Vietnam War 
era veterans, and they provide this service in 
any weather condition to give fellow veterans 
the final honors they earned. On average this 
post will have 8–15 members volunteer for a 
service. 
Madam Speaker, I stand today to acknowl-
edge the decades’ long achievement of the 
Sergeant Benito Alaniz Post 7473 Veterans of 
Foreign Wars in volunteering to honor fallen 
veterans in Texas with a proper send-off. 
Each member of the Sergeant Benito Alaniz 
Post 7473 Veterans of Foreign Wars is an in-
credible leader in our community, and their 
legacy will no doubt inspire public service and 
volunteerism in future generations.
