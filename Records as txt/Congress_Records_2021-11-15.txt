PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
We stand before You, God Almighty, 
orienting ourselves to You, the giver 
and preserver of all life. 
We offer our prayers and ourselves at 
the beginning of this new legislative 
week. Prepare and equip us to serve 
You faithfully, that by Your mercy, 
where we find ourselves in the days to 
come, and what we do in committee, in 
conversation, and in this Congress, 
would be ever defined by who You are 
and what You intend. 
You have called us to be strong. Up-
hold us by Your mighty power. So may 
we be willing and able to take a stand 
against all things contrary to Your de-
sign. You have called us to be coura-
geous. Encourage us by Your steadfast 
presence. So may we dare to face down 
the forces that attempt to compete 
with Your rule, Your authority, and 
Your power over and Your desire for 
Your creation. 
For You, O Lord, are the source of 
our strength, the motivation for our ef-
forts, the reason for our lives, and the 
hope of our salvation. 
May our life today and our attitude 
for the week ahead, in both word and 
deed, reflect the righteousness You 
have bestowed on us and reveal the 
love You have shown to us. 
In Your sovereign name we pray. 
Amen.

f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to 15 requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of

f 
AMERICA IS ON THE MOVE AGAIN 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, today 
is a major day. Not as major as the day 
we had about 10 days ago when the 
House passed, with bipartisan support, 
the bipartisan infrastructure bill, but 
we are going to have a bill signing in 
the White House in just a few minutes 
by President Biden. 
This is a big deal. We passed a bill 
that President Trump couldn’t pass 
with a Republican Congress and with-
out a Republican Congress. President 
Biden and this Congress passed it. It is 
going to mean road repairs, bridge re-
pairs, airport additions, bridge observa-
tions and repairs. Ports in our country 
will be improved. Broadband will be ex-
tended. The electric grid will be im-
proved; people will get access. This is 
what used to be bipartisan—people 
working together to get the infrastruc-
ture of our country that moves goods 
to ports, goods to people, makes our 
country tick, helps business, puts jobs 
together. 
This is an important bill. The Demo-
cratic Congress with 13 Republicans 
passed it. It is a great day to celebrate. 
America is on the move again. 
f 
CORRECT COURSE AND SAVE 
AMERICA 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, we 
are just days away from voting on a 
2,000-page bill that will very likely cost 
$4 trillion; a bill that the White House 
Chief of Staff recently bragged, ‘‘twice 
as big in real dollars as the New Deal 
was.’’ 
Can you imagine that? Let that sink 
in: 2,000 pages, $4 trillion, twice as big 
in real dollars as the New Deal was. 
Given its size, scope, given its unques-
tionable impact on American life, the 
American people deserve an honest, 
transparent debate about its true cost 
and content. 
Yet, here we are, and not one Mem-
ber of this House can honestly say they 
have analyzed, studied, or reviewed it. 
We know this because the Congres-
sional Budget Office has made it clear 
that they won’t have the final analysis 
on how much the bill costs until Fri-
day, at the earliest. But even without 
the CBO report, we already have a pret-
ty clear idea that the final price tag 
will be far more expensive than what 
Democrats are claiming.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6250 
November 15, 2021 
Now, according to estimates from the 
University of Pennsylvania Wharton 
School—one 
of 
the 
best 
business 
schools in the Nation—they say that 
new spending would increase by over $4 
trillion. Now, that is twice as much as 
the Democrats say it will cost. And it 
is not just the top-line cost, it is the 
tax increases, too. 
According to Tax Policy Center, a 
center-left think tank, 20 to 30 percent 
of middle-income families will see 
their taxes go up in 2022. Now, that di-
rectly breaks President Biden’s pledge 
that he wouldn’t raise taxes on the 
middle class. 
Let me make sure I state that clear-
ly. According to Tax Policy Center— 
now this is a center-left think tank— 
says 20 to 30 percent of middle-income 
families. These are the ones who are al-
ready having a hard time because of in-
flation, who are already going to cele-
brate the most expensive Thanksgiving 
in their lifetime, paying for gas higher 
than they have seen, and inflation, to 
many of them, higher than they have 
ever had in their own lifetime. The 
President promised them he would not 
raise their taxes, but the Tax Policy 
Center says 20 to 30 percent are going 
to have their taxes raised. 
The Democrats are trying to pull a 
bait-and-switch on the American peo-
ple. Tell them one thing but vote on 
something else. The American people 
obviously know better than to believe 
a bill of this size would cost zero dol-
lars. 
I have listened to the President say— 
and I think he is on late-night TV— 
who would possibly say this bill would 
not cost money. The Wharton School of 
Business says it is more than $4 tril-
lion. It is only the President who first 
claimed, ‘‘if you are middle class, we 
won’t raise your taxes.’’ 
We know that is not true. Wharton 
tells us again, yeah, it is not true what 
the President says. It is going to cost 
you $4 trillion. 
So in desperation, Speaker PELOSI is 
demanding the House vote on this bill 
even as we do not know exactly how 
much it will cost or how it will truly 
impact our lives. If that sounds famil-
iar to you, it should. You see, it is ex-
actly what Speaker PELOSI did just 10 
years 
ago 
while 
trying 
to 
pass 
ObamaCare. 
Remember 
her 
famous 
words? ‘‘We have to pass the bill to find 
out what is in it.’’ Well, here we go 
again. 
So what is the rush? After all, sev-
eral of my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle have been very clear. They 
want to make sure that this bill actu-
ally matches up with what the White 
House says it will. 
I just watched—before we depart, 
they wanted these same Members to 
pledge and sign a letter that they 
would vote for whatever this bill said if 
the others would vote for the infra-
structure bill. Could you imagine your 
constituents looking at you, not even 
asking if you read what was in the bill 
because you pledged to vote for it be-
fore you could even read it. 
Speaker PELOSI is rushing this bill to 
the floor because once they find out 
that Build Back Better does nothing to 
lower gasoline prices or reduce food 
prices, or fix our broken supply chain, 
or stop illegal immigration at the bor-
der. It doesn’t make our streets any 
safer or our schools better for the chil-
dren. Once they find all that out, they 
will reject it overwhelmingly. 
Madam Speaker, I know that many 
of my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle understand this. But they 
truly do not want to vote on this bill 
because they know it can’t be justified. 
Madam Speaker, I know that they 
know it can’t be justified to spend tril-
lions of dollars when inflation just hit 
a 30-year high. They know it just can’t 
be justified to spend trillions of dollars 
on programs that benefit them politi-
cally while hiking taxes on the middle 
class. They can’t. 
Madam Speaker, they know it can’t 
be justified to spend trillions of dollars 
for mass amnesty during the worst bor-
der crisis in history. They know it 
can’t be justified to spend trillions of 
dollars that would make gasoline even 
more expensive than it currently is on 
a 7-year high. 
Madam Speaker, they know it can’t 
be justified to spend trillions of dollars 
to hire 87,000 new IRS agents to spy on 
any American who spends as little as 
$28 a day. They know it can’t be justi-
fied to spend trillions of dollars to 
make the labor crisis worse by turning 
the child tax credit into welfare with-
out any work requirement. 
They know it can’t be justified to 
spend trillions of dollars to abandon 
the Hyde amendment, allowing for tax-
payer-funded abortion on demand. And 
they know it cannot be justified to 
spend trillions of dollars to dictate our 
children’s education standards so that 
Washington has the final say in what 
our children learn. 
On the merits, this bill deserves to be 
defeated. Fundamentally, it is anti- 
worker, anti-family, anti-jobs, anti-en-
ergy, and anti-American. From bank 
surveillance to bailouts, it takes the 
problems President Biden and Wash-
ington Democrats have created over 
the past 9 months and makes them 
much, much worse. Its destructive poli-
cies should alarm every American. 
Madam Speaker, Democrats aren’t 
just ignoring what is going on through-
out the country. It is worse. They 
aren’t even pretending to listen. And 
that is the fundamental difference be-
tween Democrats and Republicans. 
Madam Speaker, the Democrats are 
focused on securing the Speaker’s leg-
acy. House Republicans are focused on 
solving the labor crisis. 
Democrats are focused on so-called 
equality. We are focused on quality 
education. 
Democrats are focused on payoffs for 
illegal immigrants. We are focused on 
protecting the border. 
Democrats are focused on the Green 
New Deal. We are focused on lowering 
the gas prices. 
Democrats are focused on mandates. 
Republicans are focused on more free-
dom. 
When you look at those differences, 
it is no wonder that the American peo-
ple want a change in leadership. 
Madam Speaker, just this morning, a 
Democrat in the Texas House of Rep-
resentatives 
changed 
parties. 
This 
comes just two weeks after voters from 
Virginia to Seattle rejected the radical 
Democrats and voted to return to com-
monsense. 
Madam Speaker, you understand this 
very well, I know, that Joe Biden won 
Virginia by 10 points; he won New Jer-
sey by 16. 
Madam Speaker, on that night, it 
wasn’t just Virginia that flipped but 
the races in New York; the races in 
your own State, in Minneapolis; and in 
Seattle for the city attorney. 
Madam Speaker, there was good news 
and bad news that night. In New Jer-
sey, the good news for many people 
across this country was a Republican 
truck driver with less than $200 de-
feated the second most powerful elect-
ed position in New Jersey—the Demo-
crat Senate President. That was the 
good news. The bad news in this new 
Biden America is we just lost another 
truck driver when we need so much 
more help. 
It is not just the message, it is the 
mandate. Not for left versus right, but 
for right versus wrong. 
b 1415 
My question is: Will Washington 
Democrats listen? 
So far, Madam Speaker, that answer 
is no. They are focusing on themselves 
and on the demands of Speaker PELOSI. 
Madam Speaker, I know today the 
longest serving Democrat in the Senate 
announced retirement. I don’t know 
what plans Speaker PELOSI has. I know 
she has been to Europe three times in 
the last 3 months. I don’t know if she 
plans on staying longer. 
I know in her press conference that 
she said that this will be the culmina-
tion of her career. Maybe that is why 
she is pushing so hard for people to 
vote on a bill that costs $4 trillion that 
breaks the promises of President Biden 
before anybody could actually read it 
or analyze it. I just think that is 
wrong. 
But we have the chance this week to 
correct course and save America. 
Madam Speaker, so many Ameri-
cans—Independents, 
Democrats, 
and 
Republicans—went to the polls last 
Tuesday. It wasn’t a little pocket of 
one place said one thing and one said 
another. It was overwhelmingly re-
sounding, a rejection of the current 
policies of this majority. 
Madam Speaker, this one-party rule 
of Washington in 1 year has given us 
not just inflation but rising gasoline 
prices, a labor crisis, a supply chain 
crisis, chaos, crime, and, worst of all, 
failure. 
As we sit here today, Madam Speak-
er, Russia brings thousands of their

military to the border of Ukraine. 
They feel empowered because they are 
able to have a pipeline that President 
Biden okayed but that America was de-
nied. 
We watch China pressure Taiwan 
even further. 
Madam Speaker, we still have Ameri-
cans stuck in Afghanistan. 
Madam Speaker, it is just a little 
more than a week away from Thanks-
giving when millions of Americans will 
gather together. But those events may 
be smaller because they may not be 
able to afford the gas to drive to see 
their family. They may not be able to 
afford the most expensive Thanks-
giving dinner they have ever had. They 
are looking to Washington to do better. 
Madam Speaker, the worst thing pos-
sible we could do is not to listen to 
them. They have spoken loudly, and 
they have spoken clearly that the path 
that we are on is wrong. They cannot 
afford it; they cannot accept it; and 
they expect us to do better. 
But an idea to rush a bill this large 
and not have any analysis and to think 
the American people won’t understand 
it—they have watched what happened 
this year under one-party rule, and on 
Tuesday, they said that will change. I 
just hope, Madam Speaker, that this 
body listens and waits for the report 
because they will not be able to justify 
a ‘‘yes’’ vote for it. 
America cannot afford it. For the 
good of the country, let’s take ahold of 
it, and let’s defeat this bill.

RECOGNIZING BRENT’S FIREHOUSE 
COFFEE 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
generosity and Iowa nice spirit of a 
couple from my district. 
Recently, Brent and Amy Brightman, 
the owners of Brent’s Firehouse Coffee 
in Camanche, presented the Camanche 
Police and Fire Departments with 
$2,000 each in what they hope to be the 
first of an annual donation to their 
city’s first responders. 
When asked about the generosity of 
their donations, Brent, who has served 
as a volunteer firefighter in Camanche 
for over a decade, said that they start-
ed Brent’s Firehouse Coffee not only to 
support their community but to sup-
port first responders. 
Iowa has some of the best businesses 
and first responders, and I am beyond 
proud to see our community come to-
gether to support one another. 
I thank Brent, Amy, and the first re-
sponders of Camanche for their contin-
ued and unwavering service to our 
community. 
f 
ALARMING RATE OF INFLATION 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, as if 
things could not get any worse under 
this administration, we found out last 
week that inflation is now at a 30-year 
high. This comes as Americans are 
worried about the cost of Thanksgiving 
dinner, the cost of putting gas in their 
cars, and even the cost of heating their 
homes for the winter. 
Under this administration, inflation 
has metastasized at an alarming rate 
across the country. Every small town 
in America feels the strain of inflation. 
Every American family feels it. Every 
hardworking taxpayer feels it. Yet, 
this administration is too blinded by 
its own ignorance to figure out what is 
happening. 
Madam Speaker, it is clear that the 
so-called Build Back Better agenda was 
just a lie this entire time.

STUDY ON DISPARITIES ASSOCI-
ATED 
WITH 
RACE 
AND 
ETH-
NICITY WITH RESPECT TO CER-
TAIN BENEFITS ADMINISTERED 
BY THE SECRETARY OF VET-
ERANS AFFAIRS 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
1031) to require the Comptroller Gen-
eral of the United States to conduct a 
study on disparities associated with 
race and ethnicity with respect to cer-
tain benefits administered by the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs, and for 
other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 1031 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OF-
FICE STUDY ON DISPARITIES ASSO-
CIATED WITH RACE AND ETHNICITY 
WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN BENE-
FITS ADMINISTERED BY THE SEC-
RETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. 
(a) 
STUDY
REQUIRED.—The 
Comptroller 
General of the United States shall conduct a 
study— 
(1) to assess whether there are disparities 
associated with race and ethnicity with re-
spect to— 
(A) compensation benefits administered by 
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; 
(B) disability ratings determined by the 
Secretary, with specific consideration of dis-
ability evaluations based on pain; and 
(C) the rejection of fully developed claims 
for benefits under laws administered by the 
Secretary; and 
(2) to develop recommendations to facili-
tate better data collection on the disparities 
described in paragraph (1). 
(b) INITIAL BRIEFING.—Not later than one 
year after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Comptroller General shall brief Con-
gress on the initial results of the study con-
ducted under subsection (a). 
(c) FINAL REPORT.—Not later than 240 days 
after the date on which the briefing required 
by subsection (b) is conducted, the Comp-
troller General shall submit to Congress a 
final report setting forth the results of the 
study conducted under subsection (a), includ-
ing the recommendations developed under 
paragraph (2) of such subsection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 1031. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
1031. To build a better, more wel-
coming, and more equitable Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs, we must take 
a hard look at how VA can earn back 
trust. Too many veterans have experi-
enced barriers to receiving the benefits 
that they have earned from service to 
our country. 
I believe that VA care and benefits 
must be distributed fairly to all eligi-
ble veterans, regardless of social or 
physical disparities. That is why we 
must look back to document whether 
veterans have been unjustly denied 
benefits, address the root causes of dis-
parities, and ensure equitable treat-
ment moving forward. 
Such an important evaluation will 
certainly require digging into vast 
datasets, evaluating agency processes, 
and laying the framework for meaning-
ful 
recommendations 
to 
effectively 
make any needed course corrections at 
VA. That is why this bill mandates 
that the nonpartisan Government Ac-
countability Office perform this exam-
ination. 
Under Senator RAPHAEL WARNOCK’s 
legislation passed by the Senate, GAO 
would study racial and ethnic dispari-
ties regarding VA compensation bene-
fits, including VA disability ratings 
and rejections of fully developed claims 
for benefits under laws administered by 
VA.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6252 
November 15, 2021 
The VA Secretary would brief Con-
gress within a year after passage of the 
bill and then prepare a report that in-
cludes recommendations to address 
identified disparities. 
The companion legislation I spon-
sored, H.R. 3856, was approved by the 
House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, 
and I am pleased to support Senator 
WARNOCK’s legislation today. I urge my 
colleagues to support this important 
legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 1031, sponsored by Senator RAPH-
AEL WARNOCK. I would also like to rec-
ognize Chairman TAKANO for leading 
this effort in the House. 
As you all know, when the men and 
women of our military sign up to serve, 
we make a promise to care for them 
upon their separation, regardless of 
age, ethnicity, race, or gender. 
The Veterans’ Affairs Committee has 
heard concerns from veterans who say 
that they have been treated unfairly in 
the VA benefits system based on their 
minority status. However, we have no 
objective data to determine whether 
there is a bias against the minority 
groups in the VA through the claims 
process. 
S. 1031 would help address this ques-
tion by requiring a GAO study to deter-
mine whether any differences exist in 
the way the VA administrators com-
pensate benefits based on the veteran’s 
background. This report would provide 
Congress and VA with the information 
we need to determine what biases exist 
and, if so, how to address them. 
I support S. 1031, and I hope that my 
colleagues will do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
all of my colleagues to support the bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I, again, 
ask all of my colleagues to join me in 
passing S. 1031, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 1031. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
HIRE VETERAN HEALTH HEROES 
ACT OF 2021 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
894) to identify and refer members of 
the Armed Forces with a health care 
occupation who are separating from 
the Armed Forces for potential em-
ployment with the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 894 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 894. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of Senator BRAUN and Senator HAS-
SAN’s S. 894, the Hire Veteran Health 
Heroes Act. 
We all know that there are many 
ways for our military personnel to con-
tinue to serve after they separate from 
Active Duty. This bill provides a poten-
tial pathway for those servicemembers 
in healthcare occupations to move into 
careers with VA. 
It couldn’t come at a better time be-
cause we know VA has significant hir-
ing needs to ensure it can continue pro-
viding high-quality, timely care to our 
veterans. 
S. 894 directs VA to consult with the 
Department of Defense and establish a 
program 
for 
identifying 
separating 
servicemembers who are interested in 
healthcare positions at VA. VA would 
then refer interested servicemembers 
to VA recruiters for consideration of 
open positions in the specialty and geo-
graphic locations veterans prefer. 
I see this as a win-win situation for 
veterans and for VA, and exactly the 
kind of ideal employment warm hand-
off we all talk about. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support S. 894, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 894, the Hire Veteran Health He-
roes Act of 2021. This bill was intro-
duced by Senator MIKE BRAUN of Indi-
ana. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
LATTA) introduced the House com-
panion bill. I thank them both for their 
efforts on this excellent piece of legis-
lation. 
The Hire Veteran Health Heroes Act 
would help accomplish three important 
goals: 
The first is supporting servicemem-
bers as they transition out of the mili-
tary. 
The second is helping veterans find 
meaningful work in their civilian lives. 
The third is ensuring that VA med-
ical facilities are well staffed to pro-
vide timely, high-quality care to vet-
erans. 
This bill would require VA to work 
with DOD to identify separating serv-
icemembers 
with 
backgrounds 
in 
healthcare, and it would require VA to 
refer those servicemembers who are in-
terested 
in 
working 
in 
the 
VA

BRUYERE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 3665) to designate the medical 
center of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs in San Diego, California, as the 
Jennifer Moreno Department of Vet-
erans Affairs Medical Center, and to 
support the designation of a component 
of such medical center in honor of 
Kathleen Bruyere. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3665 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) As of January 2021, of 1,255 health care 
facilities of the Department of Veterans of 
Affairs, two are named for women veterans. 
(2) From 2002 through 2006, Jennifer Madai 
Moreno was an active member of the San 
Diego High School Junior Reserve Officer 
Training Corps (JROTC), which is a Depart-
ment of the Army Honor Unit with Distinc-
tion, the highest rating by the Army. She 
was also chosen to be a member of the San 
Diego Unified School District Brigade Staff. 
As a high school senior, she rose quickly to 
become the top junior marksman in Cali-
fornia through the Civilian Marksmanship 
Program. 
(3) Moreno accepted a JROTC scholarship 
to the University of San Francisco (USF) for 
Nursing, becoming the first person in her 
family to go to college. While at USF, she 
was chosen for Leadership Development 
Training. She ultimately achieved the high-
est level of physical fitness in her ROTC 
unit. 
(4) Following her graduation from USF 
with a Bachelor of Science degree in Nursing 
in 2010, Moreno received her commission in 
the United States Army as a Second Lieu-
tenant Nurse Corps Officer. 
(5) Upon commissioning, Moreno served as 
a Gold Bar Recruiter from July 2010 to Sep-
tember 2010. 
(6) Moreno was chosen to attend and com-
pleted the Basic Airborne Course in Fort 
Benning, Georgia and Army Medical Depart-
ment Officer Basic Course at Ft. Sam Hous-
ton, Texas. 
(7) Moreno was then assigned to Madigan 
Army Medical Center, Joint Base Lewis 
McCord, Washington in January 2011, where 
she served as a Clinical Staff Nurse on med-
ical-surgical unit. Moreno earned her certifi-
cation as a Medical Surgical Registered 
Nurse in February 2011. 
(8) Moreno volunteered for a position with 
U.S. Army Special Operations Command in 
2011. She was selected into the SOC Cultural 
Support Team program. She was deployed to 
Afghanistan in June 2013 with the Army’s 
75th Ranger Regiment. 
(9) On October 6, 2013, Moreno was attached 
to a U.S. Army Ranger unit on a night mis-
sion in the Zhari district in Kandahar prov-
ince to capture a high-value target when 
four explosive devices were triggered. 
(10) During the last moments of Moreno’s 
life, she reportedly heard a call to help a 
wounded soldier struck by a blast. Moreno 
did not hesitate to respond to the call for 
help. As she made her way to help a fallen 
soldier, she triggered the fifth explosion, 
which ended her life. 
(11) Moreno was the first Nurse CST mem-
ber to die in action. Part of her legacy is the 
number of young women coming from med-
ical fields seeking out voluntary assign-
ments to join the CST program. 
(12) Moreno was the first combat casualty 
to be buried at Fort Rosecrans National 
Cemetery in San Diego since the post-9/11 
conflicts began. She received full military 
honors. 
(13) After graduating from college in 1966, 
Kathleen Mae Bruyere was accepted into 
U.S. Navy Officer Candidate School, after 
which she was assigned as an on-campus 
Navy recruiting officer in California. 
(14) Bruyere was named to the staff of Rear 
Admiral Allen Hill in 1975, becoming the first 
woman to serve as flag secretary to an admi-
ral. 
(15) In January 1976, Bruyere was chosen as 
one of 12 Women of the Year on the cover of 
Time Magazine. 
(16) In 1977, Bruyere joined five other 
women officers who sued the United States 
Secretary of the Navy and the United States 
Secretary of Defense over restrictions that 
prevented women from serving on combat 
aircraft and ships. This led to the 1948 Wom-
en’s Armed Services Integration Act being 
struck 
down 
as 
unconstitutional, 
over-
turning a ban on women serving at sea. 
(17) In 1987, as Special Assistant to the 
Chief of Naval Operations for women’s pol-
icy, Bruyere helped conduct an examination 
of the status of Navy women, including ca-
reer opportunities and complaints of sexism. 
The study led to 9,000 sea-duty and command 
jobs opening up for women on 24 combatant 
ships. 
(18) In 1991, Bruyere was assigned as Com-
manding Officer for the Navy Recruit Train-
ing Command at Orlando, Florida. At the 
time, it was the Navy’s only boot camp that 
included women. Bruyere oversaw the train-
ing of 30,000 enlistees, one third of them 
women. 
(19) In 1994, Bruyere retired from the Navy 
as a Captain after 28 years of service. 
(20) From 2012 until shortly before her 
death in September 2020, Bruyere was an ac-
tive volunteer at Miramar National Ceme-
tery, devoting almost 4,300 hours to helping 
visitors locate their loved ones’ graves and 
providing information about veterans’ burial 
benefits. 
(21) Bruyere was buried at Miramar Na-
tional Cemetery with full military honors. 
(22) In May 2021, a panel of San Diego-area 
members of the Armed Forces, veterans, and 
military spouses recommended that the San 
Diego VA Medical Center be renamed in 
honor of Jennifer Moreno and an internal 
space be renamed in honor of Kathleen 
Bruyere. 
SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF JENNIFER MORENO DE-
PARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 
MEDICAL CENTER. 
(a) DESIGNATION.—The medical center of 
the Department of Veterans Affairs in San 
Diego, California, shall after the date of the 
enactment of this Act be known and des-
ignated as the Jennifer Moreno Department 
of Veterans Affairs Medical Center. 
(b) REFERENCE.—Any reference in any law, 
regulation, map, document, paper, or other 
record of the United States to the medical 
center referred to in subsection (a) shall be 
considered to be a reference to the Jennifer 
Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs Med-
ical Center. 
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DESIGNATION 
OF 
MEDICAL 
CENTER 
PHYSICAL 
COMPONENT AFTER KATHLEEN MAE 
BRUYERE. 
It is the sense of Congress that the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs should designate a 
prominent physical space within the Jen-
nifer Moreno Department of Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center, as designated pursuant to 
section 2, in honor of Kathleen Mae Bruyere. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3665. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 
lives of Army Captain Jennifer Moreno 
and Navy Captain Kathleen Bruyere. I 
thank my colleague, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LEVIN), for intro-
ducing this legislation to pay tribute 
to these two distinguished servicemem-
bers who went above and beyond in 
their service to this Nation. 
When Jennifer Moreno 
graduated 
from the University of San Francisco 
with a nursing degree, she joined the 
Army. She completed airborne training 
and served with Special Operations 
Command. As a cultural support team 
member, Captain Moreno was tasked 
with outreach to the Afghan women 
they encountered.

November 15, 2021 
On October 5, 2013, Captain Moreno 
and a dozen other special operators 
were struck by 12 bombs in a night raid 
to disrupt a plot to kill civilians. While 
attempting to save an injured soldier, 
she was killed. 
For her heroic acts and unwavering 
support 
of 
her 
comrades, 
Captain 
Moreno was awarded a Combat Action 
Badge, the Purple Heart, and the 
Bronze Star. 
Captain Bruyere was a true change-
maker. The daughter of an Army serv-
icemember, Captain Bruyere joined the 
Navy following her graduation from 
Chestnut Hill College. 
She climbed her way through the 
Navy’s ranks, becoming the Navy’s 
first female flag secretary. As an advo-
cate for women servicemembers, Cap-
tain Bruyere was featured as one of 
Time magazine’s Women of the Year in 
1976. 
Despite her high ranking, Captain 
Bruyere was limited in her ability to 
be promoted due to the Women’s 
Armed Services Integration Act of 1948. 
In a potential career-ending move, 
Bruyere and five servicemembers sued 
the Department of Defense in 1977. The 
rules were deemed unconstitutional, 
paving the way for thousands of women 
to serve in leadership positions at sea. 
She retired at the rank of captain in 
1994 and passed away on September 3, 
2020. 
Both Captain Moreno and Captain 
Bruyere exemplify the highest quali-
ties of service and are true American 
patriots. I was honored to remember 
them both on Veterans Day. 
H.R. 3665 has letters of support from 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Dis-
abled American Veterans, and the 
American Legion, and I include them 
in the RECORD. 
VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS, 
June 22, 2021. 
Rep. MIKE LEVIN, 
Washington DC. 
DEAR REP. LEVIN: On behalf of the sixty- 
four thousand members of the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars Department of California, I am 
writing to endorse your bill, H.R. 3665 to re-
name the San Diego Medical Center after 
U.S. Army CPT Jennifer M. Moreno as the 
‘‘Jennifer Moreno Department of Veterans 
Affairs Medical Center’’ and support the des-
ignation of a component within the facility 
in honor of U.S. Navy CAPT Kathleen M. 
Bruyere. 
It is our privilege to help recognize and 
support the contributions of women in mili-
tary service, notably CPT Moreno, who we 
believe embodies the requirements necessary 
to rename a federal building in her honor. 
The panel convened in the San Diego con-
sisting of area service members, veterans 
and community leaders, made the rec-
ommendation after review of CPT Moreno’s 
distinguished service to her country, and 
who was ultimately killed in action during a 
deployment to Afghanistan in October 2013. 
In addition, we endorse naming a promi-
nent space within the facility after CAPT 
Bruyere, a longtime San Diego resident who 
helped shape the military’s policies on sex-
ual discrimination and expanding opportuni-
ties for women in the Navy. 
The VFW is committed to improve VA 
medical centers services for women veterans 
through legislative advocacy and fully sup-
port your work on behalf of our nation’s vet-
erans. 
Thank you for your time and consider-
ation. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN G. LOWE, 
State Commander.

Re: H.R. 3665 to rename the San Diego Med-
ical Center 
Hon. Rep. MIKE LEVIN, 
Member of Congress, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REP. MIKE LEVIN: As Commander of 
the Department of California Disabled Amer-
ican Veterans representing over 70,000 DAV 
Life Members in the State of California and 
in recognition of our fallen veterans and 
their survivors. I am writing to endorse your 
bill H.R. 3665 to rename the San Diego Med-
ical Center after U.S. Army Capt. Jennifer 
M. Moreno as the ‘‘Jennifer Moreno Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs Medical Center’’ 
and support the designation of a component 
within the facility in honor of U.S. Navy 
Capt. Kathleen M. Bruyere. 
It is our honor and priveledge to recognize 
and support the contributions of women in 
armed service, notably Cpt. Moreno, who’s 
service went above and beyond the require-
ments necessary to rename a federal build-
ing in her honor. DAV will never forget Capt. 
Moreno’s service this country and ultimate 
sacrifice. The panel convened in the San 
Diego consisting of area service members, 
veterans, and community leaders, made the 
recommendation 
after 
review 
of 
Capt. 
Moreno’s distinguished service to her coun-
try, and who was ultimately killed in action 
during a deployment to Afghanistan in Octo-
ber 2013. 
In addition, we endorse naming a promi-
nent space within the facility after Capt. 
Bruyere, a longtime San Diego resident who 
helped shape the military’s policies on sex-
ual discrimination and expanding opportuni-
ties for women in the U.S. Navy. 
Thank you for your support of America’s 
disabled veterans and their survivors.

THE AMERICAN LEGION, 
DEPARTMENT OF CALIFORNIA, 
Sanger, CA, July 21, 2021. 
Hon. MIKE LEVIN, 
Washington, DC. 
MR. LEVIN: The American Legion Depart-
ment of California is proud to support H.R. 
3665, which includes the renaming the San 
Diego Veterans Affairs Medical Center after 
Army Capt. Jennifer Moreno and renaming a 
component therein after Navy Capt. Kath-
leen M. Bruyere. 
Since its founding in 1919, the American 
Legion has served veterans, servicemembers, 
and communities throughout our nation. Our 
commitment to serving all veterans has been 
one of the main pillars outlining our pur-
pose. As the United State Department of 
Veterans Affairs (VA) continues to make 
strides in the way it supports and cares for 
women veterans, I believe by renaming VA 
facilities after brave female veterans it is a 
great step towards recognizing the contribu-
tion of this nation’s woman warriors. 
On behalf of the 80,000+ American Legion 
members in California we urge congress to 
take action to rename this facility to honor 
these two women veterans who embody the 
true essence of duty and service to our com-
munity, state, and nation. 
Respectfully, 
AUTREY B. JAMES, Jr., 
Department Commander. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I enthu-
siastically support the naming of the 
San Diego, California, VA Medical Cen-
ter in honor of Captain Moreno and 
Captain Bruyere, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1715 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3665, a bill to name the VA 
medical center in San Diego, Cali-
fornia, the Jennifer Moreno VA Med-
ical Center, and to support naming a 
component of such medical center in 
honor of Kathleen Bruyere. 
Jennifer Moreno, a native of San 
Diego, California, received her initial 
commission in the United States Army 
as a Nurse Corps officer. 
Jennifer was assigned to Madigan 
Army Medical Center at Joint Base 
Lewis-McChord in Washington. Jen-
nifer served there as a clinical staff 
nurse in the medical-surgical unit and 
earned her certification as a medical- 
surgical registered nurse. 
Following that assignment, Jennifer 
volunteered for and was selected into 
the Special Operations Command Cul-
tural Support Team program. 
Captain Moreno deployed to Afghani-
stan in June 2013 with the Army’s 75th 
Ranger Regiment. 
On October 6, 2013, Captain Moreno 
was attached to a U.S. Army Ranger 
unit on a night mission in the Zhari 
district in Kandahar province to cap-
ture a high-value target when four ex-
plosive devices were triggered. 
Captain Moreno heard a call for help 
and did not hesitate to respond. As she 
made her way to help her fellow sol-
dier, Captain Moreno triggered a fifth 
explosive and sadly became the first 
nurse Combat Support Team member 
to die in action. 
Heroism obviously knows no gender. 
It is only fitting that the San Diego 
VA Medical Center be renamed in 
Jennifer’s honor. 
This bill also honors Navy Captain 
Kathleen Mae Bruyere by naming a 
space within the San Diego VA Medical 
Center after her. 
Captain Bruyere was a trailblazer 
who dedicated her career to advancing 
opportunities for servicewomen who 
played an instrumental role in revising 
restrictions 
that 
prevented 
women 
from serving on combat aircraft and 
ships. 
Notably, Captain Bruyere helped con-
duct a study that led to 9,000 sea-duty 
and command jobs opening for women 
on 24 combatant ships. 
And as is true for so many service-
members, Kathleen’s service did not 
end upon retirement from the military. 
Until shortly before her death, Cap-
tain Bruyere was an active volunteer

at Miramar National Cemetery. While 
there, Captain Bruyere devoted almost 
4,300 hours to help visitors locate their 
loved ones’ graves and provided infor-
mation about veterans’ burial benefits. 
By naming a dedicated space in the 
Jennifer Moreno VA Medical Center 
after Captain Bruyere today, we will 
further ensure that her influence and 
services are forever remembered. 
Currently, of the 1,255 VA healthcare 
facilities, only two are named for 
women veterans. It is time to recognize 
the many contributions and the her-
oism of women who have served, espe-
cially those who made the ultimate 
sacrifice. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. LEVIN), 
my good friend who is back from a very 
warm welcome at the White House, the 
chairman of the Subcommittee on Eco-
nomic Opportunity and also the author 
of the bill. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding 
and for his support. 
For far too long, our country has 
failed to give women servicemembers 
and veterans the recognition they have 
rightfully earned and deserve for their 
service and commitment to protecting 
this Nation. 
For my friends and colleagues who 
may not know, women have served in 
the U.S. military since the Revolu-
tionary War. And long before women 
could 
formally 
serve, 
hundreds 
of 
women disguised themselves as men for 
the opportunity to serve in the Armed 
Forces. 
Hundreds of thousands of women an-
swered the call to serve in World War I 
and World War II in any way they 
could. Following these invaluable con-
tributions, women finally became per-
manent members of the Armed Forces 
in 1948. 
Now there are 2 million women vet-
erans living in the United States, and 
women comprise the fastest growing 
subpopulation of both the military and 
veteran populations. 
Women servicemembers now make up 
20 percent of military personnel. Be-
cause of this, the women veteran popu-
lation is projected to grow to 18 per-
cent of the total veteran population by 
2040. 
Yet, they still fail to receive the rec-
ognition they deserve for their service 
to our Nation. 
While millions of women have served 
in the U.S. military, only two of VA’s 
1,293 healthcare facilities have been 
named after these brave and coura-
geous Americans. 
That is simply unacceptable. 
So, in November 2020, I convened a 
panel of highly qualified servicemem-
bers, veterans, and community leaders 
to collaborate on recommendations to 
rename the San Diego Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center. 
The panel included a wide variety of 
local stakeholders from organizations 
like The American Legion, Military 
Order of the Purple Heart, Disabled 
American Veterans, and Veterans of 
Foreign Wars. 
After an extensive effort considering 
many incredible women veterans who 
have served our country with distinc-
tion, the panel chose Captain Jennifer 
M. Moreno, a highly decorated combat 
veteran from San Diego who was killed 
in action during a deployment to Af-
ghanistan in October 2013. 
Jennifer Moreno was born in San 
Diego and was raised in Logan Heights 
by her single mom after the early loss 
of her father. 
While attending San Diego High 
School, Moreno was an active member 
of the Junior Reserve Officer Training 
Corps for all 4 years, which is a Depart-
ment of the Army Honor Unit with Dis-
tinction, the highest rating by the 
Army. 
Following her graduation from the 
University of San Francisco with a 
bachelor of science degree in nursing in 
2010, Moreno received her commission 
in the U.S. Army as a second lieuten-
ant Nurse Corps officer. 
Moreno was deployed to Afghanistan 
in June 2013 with the Army’s 75th 
Ranger Regiment, where she was at-
tached to a joint special operations 
task force as a Cultural Support Team 
member. 
Just 3 months into her first tour, 
while on a night mission in Kandahar 
province to capture a high-value tar-
get, four explosive devices were trig-
gered. Moreno endured these explosive 
devices, including a suicide explosive 
at a range of no more than 25 meters. 
Moreno then reportedly heard two or-
ders. One was a call to help a wounded 
soldier struck by a blast. The other 
was a command to stay put in case she 
was to strike another mine in the area. 
Moreno did not hesitate to respond to 
the call for help. 
As Moreno made her way to help a 
fallen soldier, she triggered the fifth 
explosion, which tragically ended her 
life on October 6, 2013. 
Moreno was the first nurse Cultural 
Support Team member to die in action, 
and part of her legacy is the number of 
young women coming from medical 
fields seeking out voluntary assign-
ments to join the Cultural Support 
Team. 
Jennifer Moreno was promoted post-
humously to captain and was the first 
combat casualty to be buried at Fort 
Rosecrans National Cemetery in San 
Diego 
since 
the 
post-9/11 
conflicts 
began, receiving full military honors. I 
was honored to visit her gravesite ear-
lier this year. 
The panel also recommended that a 
prominent space within the San Diego 
VA Medical Center be named after U.S. 
Navy Captain Kathleen M. Bruyere, a 
longtime 
San 
Diego 
resident 
who 
helped shape the military’s policies on 
sexual discrimination and was instru-
mental in expanding opportunities for 
women in the Navy. 
In 1977, Bruyere joined five other 
women officers who sued the United 
States Secretary of the Navy and the 
United States Secretary of Defense 
over restrictions that prevented women 
from serving on combat aircraft and 
ships. This led to the 1948 Women’s 
Armed Services Integration Act being 
struck down as unconstitutional, over-
turning a ban on women serving at sea. 
In 1987, as special assistant to the 
Chief of Naval Operations for women’s 
policy, Bruyere conducted an examina-
tion of the status of Navy women, in-
cluding career opportunities and com-
plaints of sexism. The study led to 9,000 
sea-duty and command jobs opening up 
for women on 24 combatant ships. 
Bruyere retired from the Navy as a 
captain after 28 years of service in 1994. 
Last year, she passed away and was 
buried at Miramar National Cemetery 
with full military honors. 
This bill expresses the sense of Con-
gress that VA should follow through 
with the panel’s recommendation to 
honor Captain Bruyere. 
Although this effort does not make 
up for all the appreciation women vet-
erans and servicemembers are still 
owed, it is my great hope that this 
token of gratitude inspires similar rec-
ognition across the country. 
I thank Army veteran and Carlsbad 
resident Karin Brennan, who led this 
effort and exercised strong leadership 
in bringing stakeholders together to 
make recommendations for women vet-
erans with ties to the region who are 
among the worthiest of receiving this 
honor. 
But most of all, I am grateful for the 
service of Captain Jennifer Moreno and 
Captain Kathleen Bruyere. 
It is my honor to share their stories 
on behalf of the local veterans who rec-
ommended this renaming, and I look 
forward to this legislation passing the 
House and becoming law. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
all of my colleagues to support this 
legislation and for all that it stands 
for. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) 
for facilitating this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my col-
leagues to join me in passing H.R. 3665, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr.

rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3665. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the

passed.

The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 1095 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Colonel 
John M. McHugh Tuition Fairness for Sur-
vivors Act of 2021’’.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on S. 1095. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 1095, the Colonel John M. McHugh 
Tuition Fairness for Survivors Act. 
This bill codifies an important pro-
tection for beneficiaries using the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs Sur-
vivors’ and Dependents’ Educational 
Assistance Program, or DEA. Through 
the DEA program, VA helps cover the 
cost of a beneficiary’s school or job 
training. 
This bill requires that public institu-
tions of higher learning only charge in- 
State tuition for those utilizing the 
DEA program. 
There are currently over 150,000 bene-
ficiaries utilizing the DEA program. 
These beneficiaries are the survivors of 
brave women and men who died serving 
our country and the dependents of 100 
percent service-connected disabled vet-
erans. 
Currently, this benefit equates to 
about $11,000 a year for most students. 
With the increasing costs of higher 
education, $11,000 does not cover all of 
a beneficiary’s tuition costs at most 
schools, including public institutions 
where the student beneficiary would be 
considered out-of-State. 
b 1730 
S. 1095 would provide parity for stu-
dents using the DEA program with the 
Forever GI Bill program by requiring 
public institutions to charge in-State 
tuition for student veterans. This legis-
lation has the strong endorsement of 
the Tragedy Assistance Program for 
Survivors. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Speaker 
PELOSI and Leader HOYER for bringing 
this legislation to the floor, and I urge 
the rest of my colleagues to support 
this legislation to ensure the survivors 
and dependents of those who bravely 
serve our country are not hindered by 
tuition costs when pursuing their edu-
cation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
1095, the Colonel John M. McHugh Tui-
tion Fairness for Survivors Act of 2021. 
This bill would expand the in-State tui-
tion requirements to dependents and 
survivors of eligible veterans through 
the Survivors’ and Dependents’ Edu-
cational Assistance, or the DEA pro-
gram. 
The DEA program provides $1,224 a 
month in tax-free benefits directly to 
the eligible participants to help cover 
the costs of higher education or train-
ing. 
Dependents are eligible for this pro-
gram if the veteran died while on Ac-
tive Duty, is a former prisoner of war, 
or has a permanent and total service- 
connected disability rating or dies 
from a service-connected disability. 
By expanding the in-State tuition re-
quirements, we will make it easier for 
DEA participants to complete their 
studies without additional debt. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the 
bill is named in honor of Colonel John 
McHugh. Colonel McHugh was killed in 
action on May 18, 2010, by a suicide 
bomber in Afghanistan after serving 
his country for 24 years. This bill hon-
ors his sacrifice. 
I thank Senator MORAN, ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs, as well as Congress-
man MOORE, for their hard work in 
crafting this commonsense piece of leg-
islation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support S. 1095, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. MOORE), my friend. 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, today, I rise in support of the Sen-
ate version of my bill, the Colonel John 
M. McHugh Tuition Fairness for Sur-
vivors Act. 
Members of our military and their 
families sacrifice so much in service to 
our country. As a grateful Nation, we 
have accepted a responsibility to en-
sure that the educational needs of the 
survivors and dependents of our fallen 
heroes are provided for. 
The Dependents Educational Assist-
ance program currently provides $1,224 
a month to eligible participants to help 
cover the costs of higher education. 
The program is available for survivors, 
dependents of certain servicemembers 
who died on Active Duty, or later 
found to be 100 percent service-con-
nected disabled or died in a service- 
connected disability. 
The Colonel John M. McHugh Tuition 
Fairness for Survivors Act would ex-
pand the DEA program benefits, requir-
ing GI Bill eligible schools to extend 
in-State 
tuition 
benefits 
to 
bene-
ficiaries of the Dependents Educational 
Assistance Program, bringing the rules 
for this program in line with the Post- 
9/11 GI Bill. 
It is fitting that this bill bears the 
name of U.S. Army Colonel John 
McHugh. Colonel McHugh was trag-
ically killed 11 years ago by a roadside 
bomb in Afghanistan. The loved ones 
left behind by this fallen hero have suf-
fered unimaginable pain. The least we 
can do for his family and others like 
him is to honor our commitment to 
them and ensure their education is af-
fordable. Colonel McHugh’s family re-
sides in my southeast Alabama district 
in Enterprise. It gives me great pride 
to name this bill in honor of the Colo-
nel McHugh’s legacy. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a 
commonsense solution to help our he-
roes’ families meet their higher edu-
cation goals. I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of this bill. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
all of my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I urge all 
of my colleagues to join me in passing 
S. 1095, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 1095. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays.

Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to

(H.R. 5671) to authorize the Secretary 
of Veterans Affairs to furnish seasonal 
influenza vaccines to certain individ-
uals, and for other purposes, as amend-
ed.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
5671, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5671, as amended. Earlier this year, the 
SAVE LIVES Act was passed unani-
mously by both Chambers and signed 
into law. It has allowed VA to provide 
COVID–19 vaccinations to veterans, 
their caregivers, and spouses. 
With flu season in full swing and 
COVID–19 continuing to burden our 
health systems, the urgency to provide 
both flu and COVID vaccines has never 
been greater. Public health officials 
are clear. It is completely safe to re-
ceive both inoculations, even at the 
same time. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why I introduced 
this legislation to build on the life-
saving work of the SAVE LIVES Act 
and allow VA to administer flu vac-
cines in addition to COVID–19 vaccines 
to the same population. By providing 
easy access to both vaccines at the 
same time, I hope we can begin to re-
duce 
the 
burden 
on 
the 
broader 
healthcare system this winter. 
Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST), the 
ranking member of the Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs, for working with me 
on this legislation in committee. 
I ask all my colleagues here today to 
join this bipartisan effort and support 
this important legislation to increase 
access to both vaccines. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5671, as amended. This bill will 
authorize VA to give flu shots to cer-
tain nonveterans this flu season. Ear-
lier this year, the chairman and I 
worked with the Senate Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs’ colleagues to allow 
VA to vaccinate all veterans, as well as 
their spouses and certain caregivers 
against COVID–19. 
The bill we are considering today 
would allow VA to provide flu vaccines 
to those individuals as well this flu 
season. Preventing a bad flu season 
this year is important for many rea-
sons. It could help save lives, most im-
portantly. It could help avoid adding 
further burden to the shoulders of the 
doctors and the nurses who have al-
ready sacrificed so much throughout 
this pandemic. It could also help en-
sure that COVID–19 recovery efforts 
stay on track as we continue to try to 
get back to life as we knew it before 
March 2020. 
This is an important public health 
initiative and I am glad to support it 
today. I hope this bill will have the 
support of all of my colleagues. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, and before 
asking all of my colleagues to join me 
in passing H.R. 5671, I truly believe 
that passing the SAVE LIVES Act and 
passing this legislation today, H.R. 5671 
constitutes one of the best moments 
that I have had as chairman where all 
four corners of the Congress came to-
gether. 
Ranking 
Member 
BOST, 
I 
know 
walked a very delicate balance to bring 
his Members together, but I appreciate 
his persuasive abilities with his side of 
the aisle. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to encourage 
that we do this more, and I have no 
doubt that we really did save lives. And 
I have no doubt today that we are 
going to save lives because of this ef-
fort before us. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5671, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two-

FOR THE PEOPLE 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, today we join with President 
Biden, Vice President HARRIS, Sen-
ators, Congressmen, mayors, and Gov-
ernors to witness the signing of the In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act. 
And do you know what? It was 
summed up as a BFD today, and in-
deed, it was. And it was summed up in 
a four-letter word, which is J-O-B-S, 
jobs. It will create so many jobs in our 
communities. 
And once we finish with this bill, we 
are going to move on to do the Build 
Back Better bill because that is the bill 
for the people, para la gente. 
I can’t wait, Madam Speaker.

HONORING RALPH STAFFINS, III 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Ralph 
Staffins, III, for being named a member 
of Georgia Trend’s 40 Under 40 Class of 
2021. 
Since receiving his master of public 
administration from Georgia College & 
State University, Ralph has passion-
ately served businesses across the 
State of Georgia. Most recently, Ralph 
served as the president and CEO of the 
Brunswick Golden Isles Chamber of 
Commerce, working hard to maintain 
its status as one of the best-run cham-
bers in the State of Georgia. 
An important aspect of the cham-
ber’s success is preparing the next gen-
eration to be valuable members of the 
workforce. Serving on the boards of di-
rectors at the Coastal Pines Technical 
College and the Golden Isles College 
and 
Career 
Academy 
Foundation, 
Ralph is a committed advocate of 
workforce education. In every role, 
Ralph has worked to ensure that busi-
nesses and communities across the 
State flourished. 
Ralph’s dedication to his community 
is nothing short of remarkable. I am 
honored to recognize Ralph for this 
prestigious accomplishment, and I am 
thankful for his continued service 
throughout Georgia’s First Congres-
sional District.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6259 
November 15, 2021 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND 
LEGACY OF EMLEN TUNNELL 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the life and leg-
acy of Emlen Tunnell, who was born in 
Bryn Mawr almost a century ago, and 
became a standout football player at 
Radnor High School. 
Last month, the U.S. Coast Guard 
named a Sentinel-Class Cutter for 
Tunnell to recognize his accomplish-
ments as an NFL pioneer and a hero in 
the U.S. Coast Guard. During World 
War II, Mr. Tunnell received the Silver 
Lifesaving Medal for rescuing one ship-
mate from a fire during a torpedo at-
tack and another after he fell into frig-
id water off Newfoundland. 
After the war, Tunnell became the 
first Black player for the New York Gi-
ants, as well as the first Black talent 
scout, and first Black assistant coach 
in the NFL. In 1967, Tunnell became 
the first Black man inducted in the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame. 
When the cutter was commissioned 
last month, Tunnell was described as 
someone who didn’t set out to be a 
trailblazer, just a great human being 
who wanted to make a difference in the 
world. 
We are so proud to honor Emlen 
Tunnell today. 
f 
UNCONSTITUTIONAL VACCINE 
MANDATE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, the 
Fifth Circuit Court has very recently 
blocked 
President 
Joe 
Biden’s 
coronavirus 
vaccine 
mandate. 
The 
Court wrote that the mandate ‘‘grossly 
exceeds OSHA’s statutory authority.’’ 
This reaffirms that the President and 
OSHA simply cannot make up laws and 
penalties as they go or from thin air. 
So let’s stop making health decisions 
for an entire population. Instead, let 
the individual and their doctor decide 
what preventative measures will suit 
them best, not a bureaucrat guessing 
one week to the next what that might 
be. 
Some said—many are saying—that 
they would rather retire or let them-
selves be fired than to continue in a job 
situation where they are being forced 
to take a vaccine. I can’t believe this is 
happening in this country. I can’t be-
lieve they are trying to pin it on some 
1905 State court decision of Massachu-
setts v. Jacobsen. 
Losing 
our 
doctors, 
losing 
our 
healthcare 
workers 
to 
retirement 
would be a devastating one already to 
our underserved rural and urban areas. 
Other employees represent years and 
years of knowledge and talent that 
would be lost because of this unconsti-
tutional mandate. 
I say to President Biden: Whose side 
are you on? 
f 
RECOGNIZING 
ANDREAN 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
GIRLS 
VOLLEYBALL 
TEAM 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is 
my great pleasure today to recognize 
the outstanding achievement of the 
Andrean High School girls volleyball 
team. 
Earlier this month, the 59ers won the 
Indiana Class 2A State Volleyball 
championship against Western Boone 
in a five-set match. Congratulations to 
Coach Grant Bell on his persistence 
and direction of this exceptional team, 
and special kudos as well to all the sen-
iors for your leadership, including the 
starters: 
middle 
blocker, 
Brooke 
Molson; setter, Madison Kmetz; and my 
niece, 
outside 
hitter, 
Angelina 
Majchrowicz. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in 
recognizing the Andrean 59ers and all 
of these impressive young athletes for 
their skill, tremendous hard work, and 
representation to our region. 
You make all of Northwest Indiana 
and the 59er community very proud. 
f 
WAKE UP, AMERICA 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
the purpose of this speech is to encour-
age America to wake up before the 
Build Back Better Act passes here. 
There are so many crises going on in 
this country. I still believe the number 
one is the 100,000 people a month flood-
ing the border; but these two actions of 
the Biden administration intersect, 
and I encourage America to pay atten-
tion. 
First of all, in the Build Back Better 
Act, we are providing amnesty to at 
least 7 million illegal aliens. To give 
that much amnesty not only is an out-
rage in its own right, but is encour-
aging more and more people to come 
here. The next thing that is being done 
is that we are guaranteeing certain bad 
actors will not be removed from the 
country. This bill provides parole for 
some felons, sex offenders, and mem-
bers of gangs. This will be a further 
problem. 
Madam Speaker, finally, and perhaps 
most absurd of all, under this bill we 
are getting free Pell grants, that is to 
say, free college for people who are 
coming here illegally. The American 
citizen, 
the 
American 
taxpayer 
is 
$30,000, $40,000, $50,000 in debt to go to 
college, but people come here ille-
gally—free college. 
Wake up, America. 
f 
RUSSIA/BELARUS 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, as co-
chair of the Congressional Ukraine and 
Polish Caucus and member of the 
Belarus Caucus, I rise with deep con-
cern about Russia’s expansionary com-
bativeness in Europe. 
Russia is amassing tens of thousands 
more 
troops 
and 
equipment 
near 
Ukraine’s border, which it has already 
invaded and killed over 13,000 individ-
uals, threatening global security. Now 
Belarus, with the support of Russia, is 
working to undermine the European 
Union by spearheading a migration cri-
sis at the border with Poland, patrolled 
by—guess what?—Russian troops. 
The free world must strongly con-
demn Belarus’ cruel weaponization of 
immigration and the loss of life it is 
causing. As well, we must work to pro-
tect our Polish allies and the lives of 
desperate migrants at the border. If 
that is not enough, Europe is facing an 
energy crisis forced upon it by the 
Kremlin. 
Russia 
is 
seeking 
to 
weaponize energy to weaken the Trans-
atlantic resolve. 
To combat this, I am working with 
my colleagues to deliver $300 million in 
investments to support the Three Seas 
Initiative to help Europe diversify its 
energy sources and restore energy inde-
pendence. 
America 
must 
stand 
in 
strong solidarity with our European al-
lies who love liberty. 
f 
VETERANS DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, last week, on Novem-
ber 11, we celebrated Veterans Day. I 
rise today to thank our great men and 
women who answered the call to serve 
our country. 
Our Nation recognizes the genera-
tions of brave men and women who 
have defended our freedoms and pro-
tected our great country from threats 
across the globe. 
We owe the valiant men and women 
of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, 
Coast Guard, National Guard, and Re-
serves our unwavering support and 
gratitude. 
In Congress, we must work to ensure 
veterans receive the care and support 
they so deserve, even after they transi-
tion from uniform to civilian lives. I 
am proud to support legislation in Con-
gress focused on mental health and 
telehealth, spouses and families, and 
accountability from the VA. 
Madam Speaker, our veterans and 
their families have given so much for 
this country and ask so little in return. 
I offer my sincere gratitude one last 
time to the men and women who have 
selflessly served our country in the 
United States military. 
God bless our military and God bless 
the United States of America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6260 
November 15, 2021 
BREAKING NEWS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
LEGER FERNANDEZ). Under the Speak-
er’s announced policy of January 4, 
2021, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days to sub-
mit statements into the RECORD. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
breaking news. Today, the President of 
the United States signed the bipartisan 
infrastructure bill, legislation that our 
chairwoman 
and 
the 
Congressional 
Black Caucus were instrumental in 
moving forward. 
But breaking news: The President, 
Vice President, and Speaker of the 
House made it very clear that we will 
pass the Build Back Better Act, and 
that they are two bills that go to-
gether. And so tonight, I am delighted 
to join the chair of the Congressional 
Black Caucus to discuss the pathway 
and the vitality of the Build Back Bet-
ter Act. 
There is one thing that I want to im-
mediately speak to. Pell grants that is 
part of the Build Back Better will be 
an instrumental component to increas-
ing the number of students at commu-
nity colleges, historically Black col-
leges, and other colleges—minority- 
serving institutions—more than they 
have ever had the opportunity. 
Madam Speaker, in 2021, there are 
still families that are sending their 
first generation to college. The Pell 
grants—unlike which was discussed 
just a few minutes ago—will give 
Americans and legal residents the op-
portunity to go to school, and many 
others who are DACA and are deserving 
of going to school to build a better fu-
ture. 
Madam Speaker, I will speak very 
briefly on how important the Build 
Back Better Act is, and to emphasize 
that it is often said that the Federal 
budget is an expression of the Nation’s 
values. Build Back Better is an expres-
sion of our values, of our respect, and 
affection for our families and our chil-
dren. It is long overdue. 
And even though we are excited 
about the infrastructure bill that will 
bring some $26.9 billion in transpor-
tation to Texas, some $3.3 billion in en-
suring 
the 
improvement 
of 
public 
transportation, making sure there is 
$100 million for broadband, and making 
sure that we have clean water—and 
that is in the $2.9 billion from the in-
frastructure bill. I can tell you that 
Texans and Americans are excited 
about the Build Back Better. African 
Americans who have suffered with pov-
erty and inequities will stand at the 
forefront in helping to end poverty as 
we know it in our communities. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful to 
Chair BEATTY for her leadership and 
was eager to join my colleagues in the 
Congressional Black Caucus to stand 
together to support this $1.75 trillion 
investment. 
Very quickly: The bill is paid for. No 
one making under $400,000 will see any 
taxes go up at this time. In addition, 
$130 
billion 
will 
be 
provided 
for 
healthcare. 
Breaking news: If you are uninsured 
in States that never expanded Med-
icaid, you will have insurance; huge 
numbers of African Americans. Over 30 
percent of seniors over the age of 70 
can benefit from hearing aids as well. 
We know the Build Back Better bill 
will give us an additional amount of re-
sources for uninsured persons and pro-
vide the access to the Affordable Care 
Act. 
Childcare, which impacts African 
Americans, the Build Back Better Act 
will provide universal and free pre-
school for three- to four-year-olds and 
cut down the amount of dollars that 
many young working families have to 
pay. I am excited about the fact that 
we will be able to have working par-
ents, they will be looking for work, but 
they will have the ability to have their 
children taken care of, and they won’t 
pay more than 7 percent of their in-
come for childcare; $150 billion. 
Madam Speaker, this weekend, I was 
at my public housing, public develop-
ment. Families, they are going to see a 
new makeover, more housing built, and 
more down payments. 
In fact, I am very grateful to say 
that we won’t see these signs: ‘‘My 
landlord is calling and I must pay.’’ 
How many were evicted because dollars 
were not getting to people who worked 
hard every day but yet, because of the 
pandemic and other factors, could not 
pay their rent. 
b 1930 
We will see that ended with the $150 
billion for housing; education, $40 bil-
lion; and, of course, the Pell grants, as 
I said. 
It is important to take note of the 
fact that poverty among Africa Ameri-
cans will decrease seismically, particu-
larly with the child tax credit that will 
end poverty as we know it among the 
impoverished children of America. 
Again, I said, breaking news, the 
President signed the bipartisan infra-
structure bill with the help of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus. 
Breaking news, we are committed to 
leading on helping to pass Build Back 
Better with all of our Democratic col-
leagues, and Madam Speaker, I don’t 
think that we would be against our bi-
partisan colleagues joining us. 
Let me conclude by saying that I am 
delighted to know this family at the 
Gingerbread daycare, founded by a hus-
band and wife, for hardworking essen-
tial workers. How wonderful it will be 
that 3- to 4-year-olds can have uni-
versal access to school and childcare 
and can now be supported by the Build 
Back Better Act and paid family leave. 
Breaking news, we are changing 
hearts and changing America, and I am 
delighted to yield to our chair and 
thank her for her leadership. Keep on 
leading. We are going to keep on stand-
ing so that we can pass the Build Back 
Better Act this week. I am going to 
claim it. We say that sometimes in our 
community. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY). 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to stand here 
tonight as chair of the Congressional 
Black Caucus. To be here at such a 
critical point in our country, in our de-
mocracy, on the heels of leaving the 
South Lawn of the White House where 
hundreds of people gathered in honor of 
supporting the $1.2 trillion bipartisan 
infrastructure framework needed when 
we think about our roads and our 
bridges and our broadband. 
Tonight, we are so honored to be 
here. To our chair of this night’s Spe-
cial Order hour, ‘‘Breaking News,’’ I 
thank Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON 
LEE, who is anchoring tonight and 
yielding to me. 
Madam Speaker, let me just take 
this point of personal privilege to 
thank her. I thank her for her leader-
ship and say to her and all of her con-
stituents watching: Texas is all the 
better because of Congresswoman SHEI-
LA JACKSON LEE. When I think of some-
one leading and talking about Build 
Back Better, talking about how great 
this is for America, thank you for 
being part of that leadership. 
Now, tonight, let me simply say, 
Madam Speaker, when I look to build 
back better, I see the faces of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, six chairs of 
major committees. So let me do break-
ing news. 
Breaking news, when we look to 
build back better housing, we know, 
across America, that we have a housing 
problem. We know that we needed more 
dollars going into housing, vouchers,

which housing and insurance falls, she 
was iconic in her leadership, from the

There has not been a stronger voice in 
the Congress than BOBBY SCOTT in the 
Congressional Black Caucus. You heard 
earlier from Congresswoman SHEILA 
JACKSON LEE, Pell grants, HBCUs, his-
torically Black colleges and univer-
sities, billions of dollars going into our 
universities. 
Madam Speaker, let me take a point 
of personal privilege because I am a 
proud graduate of an HBCU, so I know 
what this means to young girls and 
boys and men and women who are ma-
triculating in our HBCUs. We cannot 
have a democracy in a country without 
protecting our children. When we talk

about the child tax credit, when we 
talk about universal childcare, this is 
so critical. 
Breaking news, $400 billion—I want 
to say that again, $400 billion—into 
childcare, taking some 40 percent of 
our children out of poverty. 
We know how important our climate 
is to us, and if we didn’t, if you were 
out on that South Lawn today, you 
clearly understood climate change. 
Madam Speaker, $555 billion is in for 
climate change. 
I am going to have other colleagues 
come today, and we are going to hear 
how important it is when we talk 
about taking lead out of our water, 
what that does for our children, for our 
families, for the environment. 
Breaking news, $1.7 trillion is in 
Build Back Better. 
Earlier, one of the members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus said to me, 
‘‘Tell our story.’’ Well, you see, our fin-
gerprints 
and 
footprints 
are 
all 
through this $1.75 trillion, and if you 
don’t claim it, people don’t know it. 
So, I want everyone to know that the 
Congressional Black Caucus is so proud 
of Our Power, Our Message because we 
understand that our diversity is our 
strength and our unity is our power. 
Tonight is so important for us to say: 
$1.75 trillion, Build Back Better; $1.2 
trillion, 
bipartisan 
infrastructure 
framework. It was the Congressional 
Black Caucus that asked for a seat at 
the table. 
The late Congressman John Lewis al-
ways said: If you see something, say 
something. So, Madam Speaker, the 
Congressional Black Caucus decided 
that we were going to say something. 
We were going to say something to 
make sure that all of our friends and 
colleagues came together so we could 
do what is great for America, and that 
is what we have done. 
Let me say these closing remarks as 
we then call on our other colleagues. 
Let me simply say that I am honored 
to serve in the United States Congress, 
but I am extremely humbled and privi-
leged and honored to be the chair of 
the Congressional Black Caucus in our 
50th year of existence with the largest 
membership and the oldest of the cau-
cuses in the Congress. 
Madam Speaker, chair of our Special 
Order hour, Our Power, Our Message, 
we are the Congressional Black Caucus. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
what a grand statement from our chair 
who has captured the leadership of this 
entire body. 
As I conclude my remarks, I just 
wanted to say, Madam Speaker, to the 
chair, this is what you are doing and 
what we are doing by pushing Build 
Back Better and putting our stamp on 
it. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
22.1 
percent 
of 
Black people fall below the poverty 
line, struggling to pay expenses like 
food, rent, healthcare, and transpor-
tation for their families. But with the 
child tax cut, the Build Back Better 
Act provides a major tax cut to nearly 
3 million Black people and cuts the 
Black poverty rate by 34.3 percent, 
which will help the 85 percent of Black 
women who are either sole or co-bread-
winners for their families. 
I am very pleased to be on the floor 
of the House with you, showing what 
will happen to many in the Black com-
munity who are out and about working 
and helping. This bill will help them, 
and it will help all of America. It will 
help those minorities who are in need. 
May I say: Our Power, Our Message. 
I always like to say: Our Power, Our 
Message. That is what we are tonight, 
and I am delighted to have been able to 
join her at this time. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, and on the Budget, and the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, I am pleased to co-an-
chor this Congressional Black Caucus Special 
Order with my colleague, the distinguished 
gentleman from New York, Congressman 
RITCHIE TORRES. 
I thank the Chair of the CBC, Congress-
woman BEATTY of Ohio, for organizing this 
Special Order to discuss the reasons why the 
CBC strongly supports the $1.75 billion Build 
Back Better Act conceived and advanced by 
President Biden and House Democrats to sup-
port visionary and transformative investments 
in the health, well-being, and financial security 
of America’s workers and families. 
Over the next hour, several of our col-
leagues will share their perspectives on why it 
is essential that we ‘‘go big’’ in building back 
better to our Nation and all of its people have 
the opportunities and resources to compete 
and win in the changing global economy of the 
21st century. 
Madam Speaker, it is often said that the 
federal budget is an expression of the Nation’s 
values and the investments made to Build 
America Back Better are a clear declaration of 
congressional Democrats’ commitment to en-
suring that our government, our economy, and 
our systems work For The People. 
Madam Speaker, these long-overdue invest-
ments in America’s future will be felt in every 
corner of the country and across every sector 
of American life, building on the success of 
the American Rescue Plan, accommodating 
historic infrastructure investments in the legis-
lative pipeline, and addressing longstanding 
deficits in our communities by ending an era 
of chronic underinvestment so we can emerge 
from our current crises a stronger, more equi-
table Nation. 
Madam Speaker, the bipartisan action we 
took in February 2021 when we passed the 
American Rescue Plan was a giant step in the 
right direction, but it was a targeted response 
to the immediate and urgent public health and 
economic crises; it was not a long-term solu-
tion to many of the pressing challenges facing 
our Nation that have built up over decades of 
disinvestment in our Nation and its people in 
every region and sector of the country. 
We simply can no longer afford the costs of 
neglect and inaction; the time to act is now. 
The Build Back Better Act makes the trans-
formative investments that we need to con-
tinue growing our economy, lower costs for 
working families, and position the United 
States as a global leader in innovation and the 
jobs of the future. 
This $1.75 trillion gross investment will build 
on the successes of the American Rescue 
Plan and set our Nation on a path of fiscal re-
sponsibility and broadly shared prosperity for 
generations to come. 
The Build Back Better Act will provide re-
sources to improve our education, health, and 
child care systems, invest in clean energy and 
sustainability, address the housing crisis, and 
more, all while setting America up to compete 
and win in the decades ahead. 
The Build Back Better Act is paid for by en-
suring that the wealthy and big corporations 
are paying their fair share and Americans 
making less than $400,000 a year will not see 
their taxes increase by a penny. 
Let me repeat that: Americans making less 
than $400,000 a year will not see their taxes 
increase by a penny. 
In sum, Madam Speaker, the investments 
made by the Build Back Better Act will expand 
opportunity for all and build an economy pow-
ered by shared prosperity and inclusive 
growth. 
No one is better prepared or more experi-
enced to lead the American renaissance that 
will be produced by the investments made by 
the Build Back Better Act than President 
Biden, the architect of the American Rescue 
Plan and who as Vice-President during the 
Obama Administration oversaw the implemen-
tation of the Recovery Act, which saved mil-
lions of jobs and rescued our economy from 
the Great Recession the Nation inherited from 
a previous Republican administration. 
And let us not forget that President Obama 
also placed his confidence in his vice-presi-
dent to oversee the rescue of the automotive 
industry, which he did so well that the Amer-
ican car industry fully recovered its status as 
the world leader. 
Madam Speaker, one aspect of the Build 
Back Better Act that does not get enough at-
tention is the fact, as documented by the De-
partment of the Treasury, that the legislation 
will generate more than $2 trillion in fiscal sav-
ings. 
These savings come from ensuring large 
multinational corporations and wealthy Ameri-
cans pay their fair share and reducing the cost 
of prescription drugs. 
These provisions will not raise taxes on any 
taxpayer making less than $400,000. 
As a result of these changes, the ability of 
large corporations to shift profits abroad will 
be substantially limited, and the race to the 
bottom in corporate taxation will no longer be 
a driving force weakening capital taxation. 
In short, the Build Back Better Act under 
consideration in the House of Representatives 
will be fully paid for and reduce the deficit. 
Madam Speaker, let me briefly highlight 
some of the key investments made by the 
Build Back Better Act: 
The Build Back Better Act expands access 
to quality, affordable health care by strength-
ening the Medicare, Medicaid, and Affordable 
Care Act (ACA) Marketplace programs that 
millions of Americans already rely on. 
It includes a major new expansion of Medi-
care benefits, adding a hearing benefit to the 
program for the very first time. 
Only 30 percent of seniors over the age of 
70 who could benefit from hearing aids have 
ever used them. 
The Build Back Better Act strengthens the 
Affordable Care Act and reduces premiums for 
9 million Americans who buy insurance 
through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace 
by an average of $600 per person per year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

November 15, 2021 
Just for example, a family of four earning 
$80,000 per year would save nearly $3,000 
per year (or $246 per month) on health insur-
ance premiums and experts predict that more 
than 3 million people who would otherwise be 
uninsured will gain health insurance. 
The Build Back Better Act closes the Med-
icaid coverage gap, leading 4 million unin-
sured people to gain coverage. 
The Build Back Better Act will deliver health 
care coverage through Affordable Care Act 
premium tax credits to up to 4 million unin-
sured people in states that have locked them 
out of Medicaid. 
A 40-year-old in the coverage gap would 
have to pay $450 per month for benchmark 
coverage—more than half of their income in 
many cases, but thanks to the Build Back Bet-
ter Act individuals would pay $0 premiums, fi-
nally making health care affordable and acces-
sible. 
The Build Back Better Act strengthens the 
ACA by extending the enhanced Marketplace 
subsidies that were included in the American 
Rescue Plan. 
It also provides an affordable coverage op-
tion for the more than two million Americans 
living in states that have not expanded Med-
icaid under the ACA and do not earn enough 
to qualify for Marketplace subsidies. 
When the Build Back Better Act is fully im-
plemented, soon gone will be the terrible old 
days when too many Americans are forced to 
choose between medical care and putting food 
on the table or affording other necessities. 
Madam Speaker, approximately 3.9 million 
Black people were uninsured in 2019 before 
President Biden took office and even with the 
Affordable Care Act’s premium subsidies, cov-
erage under the ACA was too expensive for 
many families, and over 570,000 Black people 
fell into the Medicaid ‘‘coverage gap’’ and 
were locked out of coverage because their 
state refused to expand Medicaid. 
The Build Back Better Act closes the Med-
icaid coverage gap while also lowering health 
care costs for those buying coverage through 
the ACA by extending the American Rescue 
Plan’s lower premiums, which could save 
360,000 Black people an average of $50 per 
person per month. 
With these changes, more than one in three 
uninsured Black people could gain coverage, 
and with the addition of hearing coverage, 
more than 5.8 million Black people on Medi-
care will benefit. 
The Build Back Better Act will make an his-
toric investment in maternal health, including 
for Black women, who die from complications 
related to pregnancy at three times the rate of 
white women. 
Madam Speaker, the cost of preschool in 
the United States exceeds $8,600 per year on 
average, and for as long as we can remem-
ber, child care prices in the United States 
have risen faster than family incomes, yet the 
United States still invests 28 times less than 
its competitors on helping families afford high- 
quality care for toddlers. 
The Build Back Better Act supports families 
in need of child care by providing access to 
safe, reliable, and high-quality care delivered 
by a well-trained child care workforce. 
The Build Back Better Act will provide uni-
versal and free preschool for all 3- and 4-year- 
olds. 
This is the largest expansion of universal 
and free education since states and commu-
nities across the country established public 
high school 100 years ago. 
This is important because our Nation is 
strongest when everyone can join the work-
force and contribute to the economy. 
That is why this investment is vital to so 
many millions of people—especially women— 
who are often forced to choose between work-
ing to support their family or caring for their 
family. 
The Build Back Better Act will ensure that 
the vast majority of working American families 
of four earning less than $300,000 per year 
will pay no more than 7 percent of their in-
come on child care for children under 6. 
Under the Build Back Better Act, parents 
who are working, looking for work, partici-
pating in an education or training program, 
and who are making under 2.5 times their 
states median income will receive support to 
cover the cost of quality care based on a slid-
ing scale, capped at 7 percent of their income. 
The Build Back Better Act will help states 
expand access to high-quality, affordable child 
care to about 20 million children per year— 
covering 9 out of 10 families across the coun-
try with young children. 
For two parents with one toddler earning 
$100,000 per year, the Build Back Better Act 
will produce more than $5,000 in child care 
savings per year. 
In addition, the Build Back Better Act pro-
motes nutrition security to support children’s 
health and help children reach their full poten-
tial by investing in nutrition security year- 
round. 
The legislation will expand free school 
meals to 8.7 million children during the school 
year and provide a $65 per child per month 
benefit to the families of 29 million children to 
purchase food during the summer. 
The Build Back Better Act will deliver afford-
able, high-quality care for older Americans and 
people with disabilities in their homes, while 
supporting the workers who provide this care. 
Right now, there are hundreds of thousands 
of older Americans and Americans with dis-
abilities on waiting lists for home care services 
or struggling to afford the care they need, in-
cluding more than 800,000 who are on state 
Medicaid waiting lists. 
A family paying for home care costs out of 
pocket currently pays around $5,800 per year 
for just four hours of home care per week. 
The Build Back Better Act will permanently 
improve Medicaid coverage for home care 
services for seniors and people with disabil-
ities, making the most transformative invest-
ment in access to home care in 40 years, 
when these services were first authorized for 
Medicaid. 
The Build Back Better Act will improve the 
quality of caregiving jobs, which will, in turn, 
help to improve the quality of care provided to 
beneficiaries. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
cannot 
emphasize 
enough how important it is that the Build Back 
Better Act will also reduce the cost of home- 
based care for the hundreds of thousands of 
older Black adults and Black people with dis-
abilities who need it and are unable to access 
it. 
Not to mention that investment in home care 
will raise wages for home care workers, 28 
percent of whom are Black. 
In the area of housing, the Build Back Better 
Act makes investments to ensure that Ameri-
cans have access to safe and affordable 
housing by providing resources to increase 
housing vouchers and funding for tribal hous-
ing. 
It also supports investments in programs 
that will help address our Nation’s housing cri-
sis by increasing the supply of affordable 
homes for those in need and investing in his-
torically underserved communities and those 
that have been previously left behind. 
Specifically, the Build Back Better Act 
makes the single largest and most com-
prehensive investment in affordable housing in 
history and will enable the construction, reha-
bilitation, and improvement of more than 1 mil-
lion affordable homes, boosting housing sup-
ply and reducing price pressures for renters 
and homeowners. 
It will address the capital needs of the public 
housing stock in big cities and rural commu-
nities all across America and ensure it is not 
only safe and habitable but healthier and more 
energy efficient as well. 
It will make a historic investment in rental 
assistance, expanding vouchers to hundreds 
of thousands of additional families. 
And, perhaps even more importantly, the 
Build Back Better Act includes one of the larg-
est investments in down payment assistance 
in history, enabling hundreds of thousands of 
first-generation homebuyers to purchase their 
first home and build wealth. 
In short, Madam Speaker, this legislation 
will 
create 
more 
equitable 
communities, 
through investing in community-led redevelop-
ment projects in historically under-resourced 
neighborhoods and removing lead paint from 
hundreds of thousands of homes, as well as 
by incentivizing state and local zoning reforms 
that enable more families to reside in higher 
opportunity neighborhoods. 
The Build Back Better Act will provide two 
years of free pre-K and two years of free com-
munity college to ensure every student has 
the tools, resources, and opportunity to suc-
ceed in life. 
It will also invest in our teachers and institu-
tions that serve minority students and provide 
funding to give school buildings long-overdue 
infrastructure updates. 
People lead happier, healthier, and more 
productive lives when they have had access to 
high-quality education and that is why the 
Build Back Better Act makes necessary invest-
ments to increase quality education by four 
years for all students at no cost to hard-work-
ing families. 
The Build Back Better Act expands access 
to affordable, high-quality education beyond 
high school, which is increasingly important for 
economic growth and competitiveness in the 
21st century. 
Specifically, the Build Back Better Act will 
increase the maximum Pell Grant by $550 for 
the more than 5 million students enrolled in 
public and private, non-profit colleges and ex-
pand access to DREAMers. 
It will also make historic investments in His-
torically 
Black 
Colleges 
and 
Universities 
(HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities 
(TCUs), 
and 
minority-serving 
institutions 
(MSIs) to build capacity, modernize research 
infrastructure, and provide financial aid to low- 
income students. 
The Build Back Better Act will help more 
people access quality training that leads to 
good, union, and middle-class jobs and will 
enable community colleges to train hundreds 
of thousands of students, create sector-based

training opportunity with in-demand training for 
at least hundreds of thousands of workers, 
and invest in proven approaches like Reg-
istered Apprenticeships and programs to sup-
port underserved communities. 
The Build Back Better Act will increase the 
Labor Department’s annual spending on work-
force development by 50 percent for each of 
the next 5 years. 
The Build Back Better Act will spur and em-
power comprehensive action to build an equi-
table clean energy economy with historic in-
vestments to transform and modernize the 
electricity sector, lower energy costs for Amer-
icans, improve air quality and public health, 
create good-paying jobs, and strengthen U.S. 
competitiveness—all while putting our country 
on the pathway to 100 percent carbon-free 
electricity by 2035. 
The Build Back Better Act extends and ex-
pands clean energy tax credits and supports 
clean electricity performance payments so util-
ities can accelerate progress toward a clean 
electric grid at no added cost to consumers. 
The Build Back Better Act invests in clean 
energy, efficiency, electrification, and climate 
justice through grants, consumer rebates, and 
federal procurement of clean power and sus-
tainable materials, and by incentivizing private 
sector development and investment. 
Another exciting aspect of the Build Back 
Better Act, Madam Speaker, is that it will drive 
economic opportunities, environmental con-
servation, and climate resilience—especially in 
underserved 
and 
disadvantaged 
commu-
nities—including through a new Civilian Cli-
mate Corps. 
Madam Speaker, the Build Back Better Act 
includes a $100 billion investment to reform 
our broken immigration system—and does it 
consistent with the Senate’s reconciliation 
rules—as well as to reduce backlogs, expand 
legal representation, and make the asylum 
system and border processing more efficient 
and humane. 
Madam Speaker, immigrants eligible for 
such protection are an integral part of Texas’ 
social fabric. 
Texas is home to 386,300 immigrants who 
are eligible for protection, 112,000 of whom 
reside in Harris County. 
These individuals live with 845,300 family 
members and among those family members, 
178,700 are U.S.-born citizen children. 
These persons in Texas who are eligible for 
protection under the bill arrived in the United 
States at the average age of 8 and on aver-
age have lived in the United States since 
1996. 
They own 43,500 homes in Texas and pay 
$340,500,000 in annual mortgage payments 
and contribute $2,234,800,000 in federal taxes 
and $1,265,200,000 in state and local taxes 
each year. 
Annually, 
these 
households 
generate 
$10,519,000,000 in spending power in Texas 
and help power the national economy. 
The expansion of the Child Tax Credit 
(CTC) enacted in the American Rescue Plan 
has already benefitted nearly 66 million chil-
dren, put money in the pockets of millions of 
hard-working parents and guardians, and is 
expected to help cut child poverty by more 
than half. 
The Build Back Better Act not only extends 
this meaningful tax cut, but it also extends the 
expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) 
and the expanded Child and Dependent Care 
Tax Credit, which help families make ends 
meet and put food on the table, reduce child 
poverty, and lessen the burden on hard-work-
ing Americans so they can provide a better fu-
ture for America’s children. 
Madam Speaker, 22.1 percent of Black peo-
ple fall below the poverty line, struggling to 
pay expenses like food, rent, health care, and 
transportation for their families. 
By extending the Child Tax Credit, the Build 
Back Better Act provides a major tax cut to 
nearly 3 million Black people and cuts the 
Black poverty rate by 34.3 percent, which will 
help the 85 percent of Black women who are 
either sole or co-breadwinners for their fami-
lies. 
By permanently extending the American 
Rescue Plan’s increase to the Earned-Income 
Tax Credit from $543 to $1,502, the Build 
Back Better Act will benefit roughly 2.8 million 
Black low-wage workers, including cashiers, 
cooks, delivery drivers, food preparation work-
ers, and child care providers. 
Earlier today, I celebrated with many of my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle at the 
White House where President Biden signed 
into law the Senate Amendment to the Invest 
Act of 2021, which invests into our infrastruc-
ture: 
$121 billion for Roads, Bridges, and Safety; 
$89.9 billion for Public Transit; 
$66 billion for Passenger and Freight Rail; 
and 
$55 billion for Drinking Water Infrastructure 
and Assistance. 
Of the amount of public transit funding au-
thorized in the legislation, my home state of 
Texas is expected to receive $3,269,170,516, 
which is more than ample for the Federal 
Transit Administration to allocate the $20 mil-
lion authorized for Harris County’s METRO’s 
BOOST Corridor project in my congressional 
district provided in the version of the Invest 
Act passed by the House in June of this year. 
The population of Harris County is projected 
to exceed 10 million people by 2040, which 
makes it crucial to develop a plan that ad-
dresses the growing demand for expansion of 
public transit. 
Approved by voters in November 2019, the 
BOOST plan includes 500 miles of travel im-
provements to help ease traffic congestion 
and provide more ways to move around. 
The BOOST plan calls for 75 miles of new 
METRO Rapid bus service that operates like 
light rail, along with expansions to two-way 
HOV lanes, park and rides, transit centers, 
light rail, and community connector service, 
and enhancement to local bus stops to im-
prove accessibility, safety, and security. 
With funding provided in the legislation be-
fore us, my constituents and residents and 
visitors in Harris County can look forward to a 
better walk with new or improved sidewalks 
along and/or near the route and improved 
crosswalks at intersections for your safety; a 
better wait at bus stops; and a better bus ride, 
with faster and more reliable service with 
streamlined stops along the route, traffic signal 
improvements at key intersections to improve 
bus speed and reliability by reducing the time 
buses spend waiting at red lights, and im-
provements designed to create easy traffic 
flow for buses and cars. 
Let me highlight a few of the major compo-
nents of the Senate Amendment to H.R. 3684, 
the Invest In America Act, which represents 
the fulfillment of a promise to the American 
people. 
THE INFRASTRUCTURE ACT ON ROADS, BRIDGES, AND 
SAFETY 
Delivers $121 billion for better roads and 
bridges faster by increasing investment by 54 
percent, with an emphasis on fixing existing 
infrastructure; 
Dedicates $32 billion for bridge funding to 
ensure bridges in communities of all sizes are 
safer, more reliable, and more resilient; 
Invests $4 billion in electric vehicle charging 
infrastructure, helping the U.S. shift to the next 
generation of clean vehicles; 
Dedicates $8.3 billion for activities targeted 
to reduce carbon pollution and provides $6.2 
billion for mitigation and resiliency improve-
ments, also advances the development and 
utilization of green construction materials; 
Makes our roads safer with a significant 
boost to roadway safety programs, record lev-
els of investment in walking and cycling infra-
structure, 
complete 
streets 
planning 
and 
smarter road design, and safe routes to 
schools; 
Focuses transportation planning to promote 
mobility and facilitate access to jobs and other 
essential services, and reconnects commu-
nities that were divided by highways with a 
new $3 billion program to correct planning 
mistakes of the past; 
Targets investments to areas of persistent 
poverty, rural communities, Tribes, and other 
continually disadvantaged areas; 
Helps elevate state and local priorities by 
funding Member Designated Projects. 
THE INFRASTRUCTURE ACT ON TRANSIT 
Provides $89.9 billion and makes record in-
vestments in transit to increase routes, reduce 
the transit maintenance backlog, and provide 
more frequent service, resulting in better op-
tions for riders, improved environmental out-
comes, and increased access to jobs and es-
sential destinations; 
Scales up investment in zero-emission tran-
sit vehicles, supporting fleet conversion to re-
duce local air pollution and related health im-
pacts and these investments are paired with 
strong Buy America requirements and provi-
sions for workforce training to ensure America 
can compete in the clean energy economy; 
Funds and incentivizes transit-oriented de-
velopment to make transit more convenient to 
where people live and work and builds sus-
tainable, walkable communities; 
Increases funding for rural transit by more 
than 50 percent in the first year and sets aside 
$50 million a year for rural persistent poverty 
communities and creates a pilot to improve 
flexibility in paratransit trips, allowing for brief 
stops such as childcare pick-ups and drop- 
offs, and short trips to the grocery store, phar-
macy, or bank; 
Creates a new reduced-fare pilot program to 
improve access for low-income riders, and 
doubles the set-aside for urban area formula 
dollars based on low-income population and 
deep poverty census tracts and directs transit 
agencies to serve these populations; 
Streamlines the Capital Investment Grant 
program to improve project delivery, reduce 
red tape, and achieve cost savings for transit 
agencies; and 
Creates new programs to address several 
pressing transit challenges—improving compli-
ance with the Americans with Disabilities Act 
(ADA), and addressing transit deserts by pro-
viding expanded transit service to unserved 
and underserved communities.

November 15, 2021 
THE INFRASTRUCTURE ACT ON PASSENGER AND FREIGHT 
RAIL 
Provides $66 billion for passenger and 
freight rail, tripling funding for Amtrak, allowing 
for enhanced service, ADA upgrades, and in-
vestments to renew and support service on 
the Northeast Corridor and long-distance and 
state-supported routes; 
Provides funding for corridor planning and 
development of high-speed rail projects, re-
ducing traffic congestion and shortening travel 
times; 
Improves rail safety by addressing highway- 
rail grade crossings needs, requiring additional 
rail safety inspectors, addressing trespasser 
and suicide fatalities, and eliminating gaps in 
railroad safety; and 
Creates a federal blocked crossing program 
to collect data and enforce a 10-minute 
blocked crossing limit. 
THE INFRASTRUCTURE ACT ON DRINKING WATER 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND ASSISTANCE 
Authorizes $55 billion for the Drinking Water 
State Revolving Fund, the primary source of 
federal funding for safe drinking water infra-
structure; 
This investment in drinking water infrastruc-
ture, will help eliminate the Nation’s lead serv-
ice lines and pipes, thereby delivering clean 
drinking water to up to ten million American 
families and more than 400,000 schools and 
child care facilities that currently do not have 
it, including in Tribal nations and disadvan-
taged communities; 
As many as 10 million lead service lines are 
currently in use, including an estimated 
400,000 schools and child facilities with lead 
components; and 
The legislation also strengthens drinking 
water standards and improves the Environ-
mental Protection Agency’s ability to set those 
standards, and directs EPA to set health-pro-
tective national standards for PFAS, 1,4- 
dioxane, and microcystin toxin within two 
years. 
In addition, the legislation provides: 
1. $15 billion in zero emission and clean 
buses and ferries and builds the first-ever na-
tional network of electric vehicle chargers in 
the United States, in order to address the 
adoption of electric vehicles and support do-
mestic manufacturing jobs; 
2. $42 billion to modernize our airports, 
ports, and waterways; 
3. $50 billion to weatherize our infrastructure 
and insulate it against the threats of droughts, 
floods, and wildfires; 
4. $65 billion to upgrade our power infra-
structure to facilitate the expansion of renew-
able energy; 
5. $21 billion in environmental remediation, 
making it the largest investment in addressing 
the legacy pollution that harms the public 
health of communities and neighborhoods in 
American history; and 
6. $65 billion to connect every American to 
reliable high-speed internet, building on the 
billions of dollars for broadband deployment in 
the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. 
To put it all in perspective, Madam Speaker, 
although we already passed the Bipartisan In-
frastructure Bill, we now have a once-in-a-cen-
tury opportunity to make gigantic progress in 
making ours a more perfect union, and to do 
it in a single bound with enactment of the 
Build Back Better Act, the most transformative 
legislation passed by this Congress since the 
Great Society and the New Deal. 
I would urge my Republican colleagues to 
heed the words of Republican Governor Jim 
Justice of West Virginia who said colorfully 
earlier this year: 
‘‘At this point in time in this nation, we need 
to go big. We need to quit counting the egg- 
sucking legs on the cows and count the cows 
and just move. And move forward and move 
right now.’’ 
The same sentiment was expressed more 
eloquently by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 when 
he memorably wrote: 
‘‘The dogmas of the quiet past are inad-
equate to the stormy present. The occasion is 
piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with 
the occasion. As our case is new, so we must 
think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall 
ourselves, and then we shall save our coun-
try.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

BREAKING NEWS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY) is recognized for 
the remainder of the hour as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to yield to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Mrs. 
LAWRENCE). She is the second vice 
chair of the powerful Congressional 
Black Caucus. She is also one of the co- 
chairs of our Women’s Caucus. 
At this time, I would like to say to 
my colleague and to my friend: Thank 
you for your leadership, and thank you 
for your strong voice. 
As a former mayor, we know she is 
used to leading, guiding, and speaking 
out. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank my CBC colleague, my 
CBC chair, an amazing leader for our 
country, JOYCE
BEATTY, for leading 
this Special Hour. I also want to thank 
Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE, 
my colleague and mentor. She is just 
amazing. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of Build Back Better. 
We have a once-in-a-generation oppor-
tunity to make a transformational 
change for women, for families, and for 
communities of color. 
Abigail Adams wrote a strong letter 
to her husband, John Adams, ‘‘Remem-
ber the ladies and be more generous 
and favorable to them than your ances-
tors.’’ 
Today, I stand on the floor so proud 
and blessed to say that we have Presi-
dent Biden and Vice President HARRIS, 
who 
are 
laser-focused 
on 
helping 
women and families in Michigan and 
across the country. 
We are talking about remembering 
women and women of color. From af-
fordable childcare, eldercare, expand-
ing the child tax credit, and providing 
universal 
pre-K, 
this 
agenda 
lifts 
women out of poverty and educates our 
children while lowering costs. 
I want to be very clear as we stand 
here today as the Congressional Black 
Caucus, Black women in America carry 
the highest amount of student debt in 
America. So when we talk about Pell 
grants, this has a direct impact for 
Black women in America. When we 
talk about childcare and eldercare, 
women are the predominant workforce 
in eldercare and childcare, and they are 
disrespected with one of the lowest sal-
aries for employment in the country. 
Let’s talk about expanding the child 
tax credit. We know that for single 
women heads of households and fami-
lies who are struggling to work and put 
their children in safe and affordable 
childcare, this is transformational. 
Madam Speaker, I had a father text 
me. We were on a Zoom townhall on 
this issue of childcare. He said: Con-
gresswoman, I pay more for childcare 
than I do for the mortgage of my home. 
b 1945 
This is transformational. When we 
talk about build back better, we are 
not talking about going back to a time 
in history. We are talking about being 
transformational and visionary and 
planning and plotting a path to success 
for all Americans. We know it is 
women—we saw this very clearly dur-
ing the pandemic—who are bearing the 
brunt of all of these social challenges 
and Black women being in the top of 
that group bearing the brunt of this 
pandemic. 
It is Black and Brown women who 
disproportionately 
make 
up 
our 
childcare workers, and, again, I empha-
size making poverty level wages. We 
can’t turn a blind eye to this. The 
Black Caucus will not be quiet. The 
Women’s Caucus will not be quiet. We 
know that when we lift women—when 
we lift Black women—out of poverty, 
we are changing the economic struc-
ture in America. There are women who 
work two jobs—one to pay for childcare 
and one to pay for the mortgage, food, 
and shelter. I want you to know, 
Madam Speaker, that the Build Back 
Better plan builds back better for 
women and families, and it is time to 
get it done. 
I am so proud today to sit outside 
and watch the President sign into law 
the largest investment in our infra-
structure to fix roads. For me, the pri-
ority is fixing the water infrastructure 
in America. A pothole is an inconven-
ience, but we need water to drink to 
stay alive and for human life. 
We know we have kicked this can 
down the road. We have had so many 
infrastructure weeks. But now history 
will say that Joe Biden led the way 
with this Congress and this Senate to 
start investing in our infrastructure. 
We are going to get the job done. We 
are really going to build back better. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
the 
gentlewoman 
so 
much, 
BRENDA LAWRENCE, for her leadership— 
breaking news. 
Let me just say, as Congresswoman 
BRENDA LAWRENCE said so well, we are 
not going to be quiet. Today, we heard 
President Joe Biden not be quiet. We

also had the opportunity to hear Vice 
President KAMALA HARRIS not be quiet. 
When we talk about the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, let me say thank 
you to Vice President KAMALA HARRIS, 
a former member of the Congressional 
Black Caucus. I thank Vice President 
HARRIS for leading by example, getting 
out there and fighting for our democ-
racy and making sure that this is good 
for America. 
As we talk about breaking news and 
not being quiet and women—Black 
women—taking 
leadership 
roles, 
it 
gives me great pleasure to introduce 
and yield to our newest member of the 
Congressional Black Caucus. She is 
someone who comes with a lot of lead-
ership, talent, and skills. It is a double 
honor for me because she represents 
the great State of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, it is always good when you have a 
partner, so to be able to have a partner 
in Ohio’s 11th District gives me great 
honor. The gentlewoman is someone 
who works hard, fights for her commu-
nity, and understands the value of 
Build Back Better and what it will do 
with this once-in-a-generation action, 
transformational legislation. 
Madam Speaker, that person I am 
talking about, my friend, my col-
league, and my partner is none other 
than Congresswoman SHONTEL BROWN. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Ohio (Ms. BROWN). 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, I would like to thank my colleague, 
Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON LEE, 
for her remarks; Congresswoman BREN-
DA
LAWRENCE; and my leader, my 
friend, my sister, and my mentor who 
is the chairwoman of the CBC, JOYCE 
BEATTY. 
As I rise to make my first CBC Spe-
cial Order hour speech, I would first 
like to thank my esteemed Congres-
sional Black Caucus colleagues for wel-
coming me with open arms after I was 
sworn in as their newest member days 
ago; for playing a critical role getting 
the 
bipartisan 
infrastructure 
bill 
across the finish line, and for shining 
the spotlight today on another critical 
piece of the President’s agenda, the 
Build Back Better Act. 
Madam Speaker, the Congressional 
Black Caucus is often called the con-
science of the Congress for good reason. 
The 
bipartisan 
infrastructure 
bill 
signed into law today by President 
Biden is a historic win for our econ-
omy, our communities, and the people 
of my district and from across this Na-
tion. 
Its provisions, from rebuilding our 
roads 
and 
bridges 
to 
expanding 
broadband access and ensuring every 
person has access to safe drinking 
water, are supported by an over-
whelming majority of Americans. That 
is why politicians have talked about 
getting infrastructure done for years. 
But today, with critical support from 
the CBC, we are delivering results— 
real results—for the people. 
But our work does not end there. We 
know the many challenges that have 
been holding families and our economy 
back for generations: high healthcare 
costs, lack of access to affordable 
childcare, 
rising 
prescription 
drug 
prices, students locked out of higher 
education opportunities, and shameful 
increases in food and housing insecu-
rity. We know that Black communities 
have been disproportionately impacted 
by these many challenges for far too 
long. 
The answer to these challenges is not 
just more failed tax giveaways for huge 
corporations. The answer is to make 
investments in families to improve 
their lives, boost their paychecks, and 
lower their kitchen table costs. 
The Build Back Better Act delivers 
desperately needed action to tackle 
these challenges and lower the every-
day costs that burden working fami-
lies. It lowers healthcare costs by al-
lowing Medicare to negotiate lower 
drug costs for seniors and expanding 
the ACA to bring down rising pre-
miums. It provides universal preschool 
for all 3- to 4-year-olds giving every 
student a chance to have a head start. 
It expands access to higher education 
by raising the maximum Pell grant and 
making large investments in HBCUs 
and other minority-serving institu-
tions. It includes critical provisions to 
ensure no child goes hungry and every 
American has a roof over their head. 
Our task now is to pass a bill that re-
flects the President’s agenda and our 
values: to promote equity, to ensure 
everyone has the opportunity to find a 
good-paying job, and to put money 
back in the pockets of American fami-
lies by lowering the costs of living. To-
gether with the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture bill, the Build Back Better agenda 
is going to create millions of jobs, re-
duce poverty, and rebuild the backbone 
of our country—the middle class. This 
is what delivering for the American 
people looks like. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, as 
we bring this hour to a close, let me 
again thank our newest member of the 
Congressional Black Caucus, Congress-
woman SHONTEL BROWN for her words. 
Let me conclude tonight’s Special 
Order hour by saying to America: The 
Congressional Black Caucus will con-
tinue to lead and to take bold, decisive 
actions to build back better by passing 
the Build Back Better Act. We heard 
that it will create more housing, it will 
furnish jobs, and it will also finish the 
job of the Affordable Care Act. It will 
provide a Medicaid coverage gap, and it 
will also provide funding, as you have 
heard, Madam Speaker, for HBCUs and 
helping families in need, giving them a 
tax cut, as Congresswoman BROWN just 
highlighted for us, with the child tax 
credit to help ensure Americans’ global 
competitiveness for the 21st century 
and unleashing the full potential of 
America’s workers and families to 
thrive in the communities that we rep-
resent, especially those 17 million 
Americans represented by the Congres-
sional Black Caucus. There are 17 mil-
lion Black Americans, and then we 
look at some 80 million Americans. 
So with that, tonight we bring to it 
to a close, but we will not be quiet. 
It gives me great pleasure, Madam 
Speaker, to say thank you for letting 
us host the first hour on Build Back 
Better. Our power, our message, the 
Congressional Black Caucus. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include any ex-
traneous materials on the subject of 
this Special Order hour.

objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Ohio? 
There was no objection.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-

TRIBUTE TO PATRICK LEAHY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
earlier today, our distinguished Presi-
dent pro tempore, the senior Senator 
from Vermont, announced he will con-
clude his incredible run of Senate serv-
ice. Senator LEAHY plans to retire at 
the end of next year, at the conclusion 
of his eighth term. 
Senator 
LEAHY
has 
served 
Vermonters in the Senate for longer 
than anyone in the State’s history. Of 
course, he has also become an all-star 
Senate institution in his own right. I 
think particularly of the opportunities 
I had to work with Senator LEAHY 
when we were sharing leadership of the 
Appropriations 
Subcommittee 
for 
State and Foreign Operations. 
It is hard to imagine the Senate 
without 
PAT
and 
his 
lovely 
wife 
Marcelle. For now, I just want to sa-
lute our colleague on the occasion of 
his announcement and add my con-
gratulations on his remarkable career 
thus far. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Madam President, last week, even 
more economic data continued to con-
firm that inflation is hammering work-
ing families all across America. In Oc-
tober, consumer prices saw their steep-
est spike in three decades, the worst 
inflation surge in more than 30 years. 
When I was back home last week, I 
heard constantly from Kentuckians 
who have watched their gas prices and 
grocery prices literally soar. This is 
happening in every single State. Last 
month was the fifth straight month in 
which national consumer prices rose at 
least 5 percent. 
The Democrats’ inflation crisis has 
gotten so bad that Washington Demo-
crats have stopped trying to pretend 
that it is just transitory and are start-
ing to admit that it is on them to fix 
it. The same Democrats who spent 
months denying inflation was a lasting 
problem, the last people in America to 
wake up to this reality, are now con-
vinced they are just the people to fix 
it. 
But their supposed solutions are 
more of the same absurd policies that 
helped dig this hole in the first place. 
After months of mostly ignoring the 
problem, President Biden finally re-
sponded to last week’s inflation data 
by insisting that ‘‘reversing this trend 
is a top priority for me.’’ 
But—surprise—the President’s pre-
ferred solution just so happens to be 
the exact same reckless taxing-and- 
spending spree his administration has

been pushing, literally, for months 
now. 
They cooked up this massive multi-
trillion-dollar 
spending 
spree 
back 
when they were saying inflation wasn’t 
a major problem and it was still time 
to spend like crazy. But now, miracu-
lously, that same spending binge hap-
pens to be their prescription to fight 
inflation. 
Give me a break. This is just a sweep-
ing socialist wish list in search of a 
justification. This is another megadose 
of the same radical recklessness that 
Republicans have warned against all 
along, that American families are al-
ready paying dearly for, as we speak. 
But, so far, Democrats seem intent 
on grabbing the hot stove yet again, 
and its American families who stand to 
get burned. 
VETERANS DAY 
Madam President, one final matter. 
Last week, I had the honor of spending 
Veterans Day at the groundbreaking 
ceremony for Louisville’s new VA hos-
pital. We are finally going to replace 
the city’s original VA medical center 
that was built almost 70 years ago. 
Kentucky veterans are going to get 
new, expanded options for the cutting- 
edge treatment that they richly de-
serve. 
The 
long-awaited 
groundbreaking 
was a special day for Kentucky and our 
heroes. But for me, the celebration also 
underscored how unfortunate and unac-
ceptable it is when it comes to our leg-
islative duties here in Washington. 
This Democratic Senate majority is 
coming up short on supporting our 
servicemembers past, present, and fu-
ture. 
Today is November 15. The full Sen-
ate should have considered, amended, 
and passed an annual defense author-
ization bill months ago. That is how it 
normally works. It is a major bipar-
tisan priority that the Senate majority 
focuses on as a matter of basic govern-
ance. 
But this unified Democratic govern-
ment has been distracted from the peo-
ple’s business. They have spent months 
behind closed doors putting together 
another reckless taxing-and-spending 
spree. And this obsession with party- 
line wish lists have led Democrats to 
drop the ball on basic duties. Keeping 
our servicemembers and our com-
manders waiting months for an NDAA 
is just one example. 
The Democratic majority has also 
completely dropped the ball on a bipar-
tisan appropriations process. Oh, and 
by the way, President Biden’s pro-
posals for funding the government 
would have us cut defense spending 
after inflation. 
According to reports, China recently 
tested a hypersonic vehicle that is ca-
pable of carrying nuclear weapons. 
Just this morning, according to some 
early press reports, Russia may have 
tested some new anti-satellite weapon 
system. In the Middle East, President 
Biden’s own advisors are saying that 
his rushed retreat from Afghanistan 
will open the door for a terrorist resur-
gence. 
It is against this dangerous backdrop 
that our Democratic majority does not 
move an NDAA until mid-November, 
and President Biden doesn’t want de-
fense spending to keep pace with Presi-
dent Biden’s inflation. 
Madam President, better late than 
never. I am glad the Democratic leader 
says we will finally let the full Senate 
consider an NDAA in the coming days. 
The Senate will need to have the kind 
of robust bipartisan floor process that 
is customary for this important bill, 
and we will need to leave extraneous 
items on the sidelines. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NATIONAL ADOPTION MONTH 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam Presi-
dent, our great country was founded on 
the idea that freedom leads to pros-
perity, which is better known as the 
American dream. 
I have always said this country owes 
you only one thing, and that is an op-
portunity to succeed. This country 
gives you the opportunity to live the 
life you dream of because, with hard 
work, anything is possible. For a cou-
ple, the American dream may look like 
saving enough to buy their first home. 
For a small family business, it might 
look like opening its doors for the first 
time. For a first-generation college 
graduate, it might be walking across 
the stage, and for a soldier, returning 
from war with the hopes of starting a 
family. The American dream takes on 
many unique forms reflective of the op-
portunity that countless generations 
have strived to realize. 
At the core of the American dream, 
you will find the American family be-
cause for centuries, the American 
dream has been rooted in the idea of 
family and freedom. Strong families 
are the foundation of strong commu-
nities. That is why we need to uplift 
the American family rather than to 
continue to rip it apart. 
But recently, we have seen policies 
from the Democrats that inject politics 
into parenting, that insert the heavy 
hand of the Federal Government into 
the American home and stop at noth-
ing to tell parents: We know best when 
it comes to raising your children. 
Threats to the American family are 
knocking on the front doors of homes 
across the Nation as the left becomes 
focused on telling the American people 
what they want rather than listening 
to what they need. A prime example is 
the 
Democrats’ 
socialist 
spending 
spree, designed to create a cradle-to- 
grave welfare system that does more to 
tear the American family down than to 
build it up. Just look at the child tax 
credit—a once bipartisan policy initia-
tive that has now been weaponized to 
benefit some families at the expense of 
others. If you are a working-class, mar-
ried couple with children, you drew the 
short end of the stick. Then there is 
the Democrats’ Federal childcare pro-
gram. It is more focused on perpet-
uating government dependency than 
giving low-income families the means 
to stand on their own two feet. 
With these proposals in their reckless 
tax-and-spend spree, the Democrats are 
picking winners and losers, and the los-
ers are the American family. Anti-fam-
ily policies like these grow the size of 
the government while chipping away at 
American freedom. We should focus on 
pro-family policies that put families 
first, policies that make achieving the 
American dream a reality, not some-
thing to feel shameful about. 
If you are born with two parents in 
this country, you hit the lottery. So 
many children don’t have the stable 
family that some have; they grow up 
with one parent or are raised by an-
other family member. Then there are 
children who grow up with no parents, 
thrown into the foster system. It is a 
shame because we know stable families 
can provide foundations that children 
need to seize the American opportuni-
ties. 
As we talk about supporting the 
American family, I want to focus on an 
important 
issue 
to 
many 
families 
across the country; that is, adoption. 
November 
is 
National 
Adoption 
Month in the United States. In the 
United States, over 400,000 children a 
year don’t have a safe place to call 
home or a loving family to care for 
them. The idea that children have a 
safe and stable home, with a family 
who loves them, should be something 
we should all agree on. 
In my career, I have traveled across 
the country for 40 years. People from 
all walks of life welcomed me into 
their homes. I have seen firsthand the 
immeasurable impact that family can 
have on a child’s life. I have seen par-
ents who provide stable foundations, 
who instill the belief that with hard 
work, grit, and determination, any-
thing is possible. 
Success stories can be found across 
my State of Alabama. In fact, in 2019, 
Alabama had 731 adoptions—the high-
est number in Alabama’s history. 
One of those is Katie, who was adopt-
ed through the Heart Gallery of Ala-
bama. Katie’s parents adopted her at 
the age of 12, after years spent in and 
out of foster care. Her forever family 
provided her with the secure founda-
tion she needed to jump-start her fu-
ture. Now, Katie just completed her 
first year at Yale University. 
Like Katie, children in our foster 
care systems have endless potential 
but need the stability that having a 
family brings to unlock it. While we 
celebrate the heartwarming stories of 
families being made whole, we cannot 
forget about the children waiting for

their forever home. Those are the sto-
ries of kids who deserve these families 
and families who deserve kids. 
As a Christian, I believe life begins at 
conception, but too often, when dis-
cussing pro-life issues, we often refer to 
that life as the child’s time in the 
womb. We should, however, be focusing 
on the life of a child after they are 
born, and that philosophy should apply 
to children all around the world. 
Many other countries don’t place the 
same value on life as we do here in the 
United States. In some countries, par-
ents may choose to abort babies who 
might have disabilities, and if a child 
is born with a disability, they are put 
up for adoption at much higher rates. 
China is one of these countries. Right 
now, there are several hundred Amer-
ican families who have been matched 
with or have begun the process of adop-
tion with children in China, but the 
pandemic has indefinitely halted most 
of the adoptions from China moving 
forward. 
Back in May, I sent a letter to Sec-
retary of State Antony Blinken asking 
for the State Department to have dip-
lomatic discussions with China so 
these kids could go home to their new 
families, but here we are in November, 
and I have yet to receive a response 
from the State Department. 
Over 400 children are still stuck in 
China, with their families unable to 
bring them home. Most of these chil-
dren have some type of medical or spe-
cial need and are currently living in 
Chinese orphanages. 
One such child is Cherry. She is 
stuck in China while her forever family 
is waiting with open arms here in the 
United States. Cherry has Down syn-
drome and needs medical attention, 
which is currently being delayed. 
When speaking about Cherry, her for-
ever family said: 
The sooner we can get little Cherry into 
our home, the sooner we can give her all the 
attention, therapy, and love to bring out her 
fullest potential in life. 
Cora Lee has lived in an orphanage 
for 31⁄2 years, ever since she was an in-
fant. Cora Lee has a medical condition 
that needs to be treated or could even-
tually lead to blindness. Here in the 
United States, there are parents, sib-
lings, aunts and uncles, and a church 
family who are waiting for her to come 
home so they can help provide help in 
the future. 
Then there is Charlie, who recently 
had a fourth birthday. He has a family 
in Alabama who cannot wait to wel-
come him home. The first several years 
of Charlie’s life have been tough. He 
needs specialized care that only a lov-
ing family can provide. 
Given that the Biden administration 
just reopened our borders to so many 
international travelers and that one of 
our COVID vaccines for children age 5 
through 11 has just been authorized, I 
believe it is past time for us to get 
these children home to the families 
who have been waiting years to love 
them and care for them. 
Adoption is the gift that keeps on 
giving by providing children the oppor-
tunity to rise above difficult cir-
cumstances. We need to work together 
towards policies that make this gift 
more attainable for all who can provide 
a stable home. After all, family is the 
heartbeat of the American dream. 
Madam President, I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
REED). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
PROTECTING AMERICA’S FIRST RESPONDERS ACT 
OF 2021 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the 
Senate has unanimously passed a bill 
entitled Protecting America’s First Re-
sponders Act. I authored this legisla-
tion to expand benefits to first re-
sponders who are injured in the line of 
duty. 
The Public Safety Officers’ Benefit 
Program, or PSOB for short, offers a 
one-time lump sum payment to first 
responders who are killed or perma-
nently disabled in the line of duty. I 
think that legislation has been on the 
books since the 1970s. 
I started investigating this program 
when I heard complaints about long 
delays in processing payments. Those 
delays reached up to 3 years, on aver-
age. It is just not understandable why 
it should take 3 years for somebody 
who is killed in the line of duty to de-
cide if the family should have help 
from that program. We fixed that par-
ticular issue with my 2017 bill entitled 
the Public Safety Officers’ Benefit Im-
provement Act. 
However, my investigation uncovered 
a lot of other problems with that pro-
gram, now 50 years old. The Justice De-
partment was denying payments to 
folks who should have received those 
payments. In one case, a disabled po-
lice officer suffered a traumatic brain 
injury. The Department said that he 
wasn’t disabled because he held a part- 
time position at Home Depot as a 
greeter. 
In another case, again, a police offi-
cer with brain injury was denied the 
benefit. Why? Because the officer tin-
kered around with motorcycles in his 
garage. It would take this officer 
months to do simple things that would 
otherwise have taken him just days. 
Still, the Department said that he 
wasn’t disabled. They said it. It is un-
reasonable. 
But my bill that I described to you, 
which has now passed the Senate re-
cently, will correct this problem. This 
legislation clarifies that first respond-
ers who are totally and permanently 
disabled but can still perform some 
very simple tasks can still get benefits. 
It adds a fair boost in payments to first 
responders who have waited years for 
these benefits. It provides the Justice 
Department with more tools so that it 
can process claims more quickly. 
Finally, my bill extends a presump-
tion in the law that ensures that first 
responders who contract COVID on 
duty don’t have to jump through hoops 
to prove it, because, you know, with 
COVID—did you get it when you were 
actually policing, or did you get it 
when you were in a restaurant, or did 
you get it when you were in church?— 
you don’t really know. This bill will go 
a long ways in helping our first re-
sponders where it is impossible to show 
whether you got it when you were ac-
tually on duty. 
I would like to thank Senators GILLI-
BRAND and BOOKER, as well as all the 
other cosponsors. 
I also want to thank our House coun-
terparts, 
specifically, 
Congressman 
PASCRELL and his staff, who led the ef-
fort to pass the bill in the House of 
Representatives. 
Lastly, I want to thank the Justice 
Department for working closely with 
us to improve this language. 
Before I wrap up, I just want to say 
a few words about our first responders. 
Whether it is police officers, fire-
fighters, or EMTs, first responders are 
the embodiment of the best qualities of 
Americans. Their daily sacrifices make 
our society better and safer. 
I am proud to have sponsored this 
legislation, and I urge the President to 
quickly sign the bill. 
HUNTER BIDEN 
Now, 
Mr. 
President, 
on 
another 
shorter issue, I want to bring up some-
thing that deals with something I deal 
with a lot, what we call oversight, to 
make sure that we have transparency 
to our government, because trans-
parency brings accountability, and this 
is something we are having a hard time 
getting answers on. 
On July 30 of this year, Senator 
JOHNSON of Wisconsin and I sent a let-
ter to the White House Counsel. That 
letter was based on media reports—yes, 
media reports—that then-Vice Presi-
dent Biden used private emails for gov-
ernment business. If that happened, 
that is wrong, and we ought to know 
about it. 
As part of that use, he sent govern-
ment information to his son Hunter 
Biden. The news reports provided de-
tails about then-Vice President Biden’s 
email addresses at that time and the 
fake names that he used for that email. 
As one example from the reported 
emails, in 2016, an employee of the Of-
fice of the Vice President emailed 
Biden his schedule and copied Hunter 
Biden. In another email in 2016, the 
same 
employee 
reportedly 
emailed 
Vice President Biden about an early 
morning preparation for a 9 a.m. phone 
call with the Ukrainian President. 
Hunter Biden was again reportedly cop-
ied on that email. 
As we all know, Hunter Biden served 
on the board of a corrupt Ukrainian en-
ergy company at the time of these 
emails. Certainly, Hunter Biden would

November 15, 2021 
have been quite interested in any and 
all information relating to the U.S. 
Government’s communication with the 
Ukrainian Government. 
Now, if these reports are accurate, it 
is unclear whether Vice President 
Biden forwarded related emails to a 
government account to satisfy Federal 
recordkeeping requirements. It kind of 
sounds familiar, doesn’t it? Just re-
member, the same issues came up with 
Hillary Clinton. 
Given Vice President Biden’s appar-
ent pattern and practice with govern-
ment emails, Senator JOHNSON and I 
would like to know if this pattern and 
practice has continued as President of 
the United States. That is why, on July 
30, as I indicated, Senator JOHNSON and 
I asked exactly that question. 
First, we asked, according to the let-
ter: ‘‘What steps did then-Vice Presi-
dent Biden take to ensure that all his 
government emails and related com-
munications were properly stored and 
archived?’’ In other words, did they fol-
low the law? 
Second, we asked: ‘‘Does President 
Biden use nongovernment email to 
communicate government business or 
email his family members government 
information? If so, what steps have 
been taken to ensure that those com-
munications 
satisfy 
federal 
record- 
keeping and archival requirements?’’ 
Now, these sound like pretty simple 
questions that President Biden can an-
swer quickly. Moreover, it would be 
quite easy for the President to deny re-
ports if these reports were not accu-
rate. Our letter provided President 
Biden that opportunity. 
To date, we haven’t received a re-
sponse. In fact, as you can tell from 
July 30, it has been nearly 3 months. 
The fact that the White House Coun-
sel’s Office and President Biden can’t 
find time to answer these threshold 
questions draws suspicion. One would 
think that the White House would 
gladly answer that the President isn’t 
using government email to commu-
nicate government business with fam-
ily members. 
Now, wouldn’t one think that the 
White House would very gladly say 
that it is properly archiving email 
records? 
This is a matter of transparency, and 
it is a matter of transparency where 
the public deserves answers. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am 
sure I am not alone in expressing con-
cern for what the next few weeks in the 
runup to Christmas are going to look 
like, and certainly the Senate and the 
Congress have not operated as a well- 
oiled machine, to be sure. 
Back in September, when the Senate 
should have passed a group of bills to 
fund the government for the next year, 
we saw the can get kicked down the 
road. 
Last month, when our Democratic 
colleagues, the majority, had ample 
time and a clear roadmap to raise the 
debt ceiling, they punted and really de-
pended on 11 of us on this side of the 
aisle to avoid a threat to the full faith 
and credit of the United States. 
Despite a strong push from both the 
distinguished Presiding Officer, the 
chairman of the Armed Services Com-
mittee, and the ranking member, the 
majority leader has so far refused to 
bring up the National Defense Author-
ization Act even though it has been 
ready for months. I am hoping that 
will change this week. I am advised 
that it will change and it will be taken 
up. 
These are not necessarily lofty goals 
we are talking about. We are talking 
about the bare minimum when it 
comes to doing the work of the Nation: 
funding the government, paying our 
bills, strengthening our military. But 
none of these basic responsibilities 
have been accomplished yet. 
These delays weren’t out of neces-
sity. After all, the Senate hasn’t been 
debating and voting on important leg-
islation—just a series of nominations 
and dead-on-arrival messaging bills. 
With such a long yearend to-do list, 
our colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, who control the agenda, don’t 
have a lot of time. The Senate is only 
scheduled to be in session for 2 weeks 
before government funding expires, and 
there is just another additional week of 
scheduled legislating before the end of 
the year. You would think that would 
mean it is time to buckle up and start 
checking off these high-priority items, 
but our Democratic colleagues believe 
they have an even more important job. 
Forget the millions of government em-
ployees who would be left without a 
paycheck before the holidays or the 
economic crisis that would cripple our 
country if we defaulted on our debts or 
the servicemembers and their families 
who deserve a pay raise; our Demo-
cratic colleagues, the majority, are de-
voting all their time and agenda to a 
spending spree and the largest tax in-
crease in American history, which ap-
parently is the top item on the House 
agenda this week. 
The size and scope of this bill has 
changed a lot over the last several 
months. The chairman of the Budget 
Committee, the Senator from Vermont, 
initially floated a $6 trillion spending 
spree and tax increase. It was later os-
tensibly pared back to $3.5 trillion, and 
now our colleagues claim it would cost 
a mere $1.75 trillion—hardly a bargain 
and certainly hardly for sure when it 
comes to the amount of spending and 
taxing because, until the bill is final-
ized and the Congressional Budget Of-
fice has time to score it, we don’t know 
actually how much this beast of a bill 
will actually cost. 
But the budget experts at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School 
of Business say that the Democratic 
proposal has been dramatically under-
stated in terms of its cost and its 
scope. Indeed, the folks at the Wharton 
School say the ultimate cost of this 
bill is really somewhere on the order of 
$4 
trillion—more 
than 
double 
the 
amount that the advocates for this bill 
have stated. 
The Committee for a Responsible 
Federal Budget concurs. They estimate 
the true cost of the bill would double 
to almost $5 trillion over 10 years be-
cause of arbitrary sunsets and expira-
tions and other gamesmanship when it 
comes to this expensive government 
proposal. That is a whole lot more than 
the President’s promise of zero dollars 
in cost. 
The President continues to insist 
that this bill costs nothing, but the 
American people are not deceived. 
They understand, when you talk about 
$1.75 trillion or $4 trillion, that some-
body, somewhere, is going to have to 
pay for it; hence, the largest tax in-
crease in American history. 
Then there is the so-called temporary 
nature of some of these government 
programs. This is all designed to mis-
lead the public and Congress into 
thinking these bills are cheaper than 
they actually are. As President Reagan 
famously said, ‘‘Nothing lasts longer 
than a temporary government pro-
gram.’’ 
Despite the lofty promises that have 
been made, millionaires and billion-
aires won’t be the only ones footing the 
bill for this spending spree. In fact, one 
of the last-minute provisions would ac-
tually give the ultrawealthy a tax cut, 
and that is from our Democratic col-
leagues. One of the latest additions to 
the bill allows blue-State millionaires 
and billionaires to pay less in Federal 
taxes. A former economic adviser to 
President Obama and current Harvard 
professor described this provision as 
‘‘even worse than [he] had feared.’’ 
Under this tax break for millionaires 
and billionaires, nearly two-thirds of 
those making more than $1 million 
would get a tax cut. So we are not just 
talking about a few bucks; the wealthi-
est Americans would save an average of 
$16,800 next year alone. The party that 
talks about the need to tax the rich is 
actually plotting a massive tax cut for 
the rich. 
While this bill will help the wealthi-
est Americans pay less in Federal 
taxes, it will ensure the middle class 
actually ends up paying more. Dating 
back to the campaign trail, President 
Biden has repeatedly said that ‘‘if you 
make under $400,000 a year, I will never 
raise your taxes one [cent].’’ His Treas-
ury Secretary has made the same 
pledge, and the White House Press Sec-
retary has restated this commitment 
again and again and again. 
Well, I understand why the White 
House is so concerned about this huge 
tax increase, but the more we learn 
about this bill, the clearer it becomes 
that the middle class will be required 
to help foot the bill for this spending 
bonanza. The nonpartisan Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation found that signifi-
cant numbers of families will see their 
taxes increased under the plan. In 2027, 
well over half of taxpayers earning be-
tween $75,000 and $100,000 will be paying

November 15, 2021 
more in taxes under this proposal. That 
is a violation of President Biden’s 
promise that families earning less than 
$400,000 will not pay a single penny 
more in taxes. You just can’t reconcile 
those two positions. 
That is only the beginning of the 
mounting costs this bill creates for 
hard-working American families and 
my constituents in Texas. The so- 
called free childcare in this bill will 
end up costing many families a lot of 
money. A left-leaning think tank found 
that middle-class families could pay up 
to $13,000 more a year for childcare. 
That is not a price increase on the top 
1 percent; that is for people who earn 
more than their State’s median in-
come, which in Texas is just under 
$62,000. It is hard to imagine a family 
who brings home $62,000 a year being 
able 
to 
absorb 
another 
$13,000 
in 
childcare expenses. 
Then come the mounting energy 
costs. We all know, when we go fill up 
the tanks of our vehicles, that gas 
prices are up more than 60 percent 
from 1 year ago, and this year, energy 
bills are expected to soar by as much as 
54 percent. Our Democratic colleagues, 
by pushing so much money out the 
door, chasing so many limited goods 
and services, are pushing for policies 
that will actually exacerbate inflation 
and make these prices climb even high-
er. 
Specifically, they want to attack the 
fossil fuel industry by imposing a so- 
called methane fee on gas companies 
and resurrect an excise tax on each 
barrel of crude oil. But these price in-
creases won’t just be absorbed by the 
companies that produce oil and gas; 
this will be an expense that is passed 
on to customers. If families are strug-
gling to cover their transportation 
costs today, they will be up the creek 
without a paddle once these new taxes 
and fees go into effect. 
The cash grab does not end there. 
This bill would also require hard-work-
ing Texas families to subsidize the cost 
of our colleagues’ preferred green ini-
tiatives. It provides hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars in so-called green sub-
sidies for massive corporations to be-
come eco-friendly. That is right—our 
Democratic colleagues are proposing 
more subsidies for corporations, as if 
Fortune 500 companies need taxpayer 
assistance to go green. 
Wealthy Americans earning hundreds 
of thousands of dollars each year could 
receive up to $12,500 in taxpayer assist-
ance if they buy an electric vehicle. 
Unfortunately, this also includes a lit-
tle bit of cronyism in it because our 
Democratic colleagues are making sure 
that their party’s most loyal sup-
porters reap the benefits of this tax-
payer-backed handout. The electric ve-
hicle tax credits are even more gen-
erous if the car is made in a union shop 
even though there is no evidence that 
these vehicles are somehow better for 
the environment. 
We all know what is happening here. 
It is all too clear. But, again, hard- 
working American families will be the 
ones footing the bill for these tax cred-
its that disproportionately benefit the 
wealthy and organized labor. 
To help cover the sky-high price of 
this bill, our Democratic colleagues 
want to ensure that Uncle Sam will be 
able to squeeze each and every penny 
possible out of middle-class families 
and small businesses. This bill gives 
the Internal Revenue Service, which 
has been notorious for its abuse of 
power, even more money and more au-
thority. This bill would give the IRS 
$80 billion, more than half of which will 
build an army of auditors to poke and 
prod working families’ finances. In-
stead of building back America, this 
builds up the bureaucracy, much to the 
detriment of Texas families. After all, 
it is going to take a lot of taxpayer 
money to pay for President Biden’s 
zero-dollar bill. 
This reckless tax-and-spending spree 
is not what our country needs, particu-
larly not at this time, Mr. President. 
Families don’t want an even bigger 
government that reaches deeper into 
their pockets and exerts more and 
more control over their daily lives. 
They want the freedom to make their 
own decisions for themselves and their 
families and the opportunity to suc-
ceed based on their hard work. That is 
not what we are seeing today from the 
national Democratic Party. 
Our Democratic colleagues’ bill takes 
steps toward Medicare for All by harsh-
ly penalizing States that didn’t expand 
Medicaid. When the Affordable Care 
Act mandated a Medicaid expansion, 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States characterized that as a gun to 
the head for the States and said that 
was unconstitutional. But we know 
that Medicare for All will discourage 
medical innovation by slapping arbi-
trary price controls on things like pre-
scription drugs. 
It turns the IRS into the govern-
ment’s No. 1 welfare Agency by extend-
ing no-strings-attached welfare checks 
into perpetuity. It proposes the highest 
income tax rate in the developed world. 
It gives Washington bureaucrats un-
precedented power to punish States 
that fail to meet arbitrary climate 
mandates. It forces hard-working tax-
payers to cover the bill for another un-
necessary partisan spending spree. 
This far-left turn is not what the 
American people thought they were 
voting for in 2020, and, frankly, it is 
members of the President’s own party 
who are beginning to tap the brakes in 
resisting this huge government expan-
sion and huge spending spree, which 
will do nothing to address the rising 
concern of inflation in the country. 
So we are simply not going to join 
our colleagues in voting for this reck-
less tax-and-spending spree, and we 
will continue to do everything we can 
to expose the components of this bill 
because, frankly, I think the more the 
American people learn about what is in 
the bill, the less likely they will be to 
support it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, last week, the Senate passed the 
Sergeant First Class Sean Cooley and 
Specialist Christopher Horton Congres-
sional Gold Star Family Fellowship 
Program Act. 
I would like to thank my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle who lent their 
support, because creation of this pro-
gram was a long time coming. 
I have spent the past few years work-
ing with and talking with Gold Star 
families, and the one thing they have 
consistently told me is that they want 
a more powerful voice here on Capitol 
Hill. 
This legislation will create a Senate 
fellowship program open only to Gold 
Star family members. These fellows 
will have the opportunity to come to 
Washington, at no cost to their fami-
lies, and work within the system our 
servicemembers work so very hard to 
defend. 
And, Madam President, we thank you 
for your service in defense of this Na-
tion. 
Just as we here in the Senate are 
bound together by a duty to serve the 
country, Gold Star families are also 
bound together by a common thread of 
loss, grief, sacrifice. 
It has been my privilege to work with 
so many of them, and I hope that these 
fellowships will create a renewed sense 
of healing and purpose in the hearts of 
those who come to work with us here 
in Washington. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Madam President, it is the week be-
fore Thanksgiving, and the American 
people are still looking for evidence 
that President Biden and his lieuten-
ants in Congress took their oaths of of-
fice seriously. 
I have said it before, but it does bear 
repeating. The anger and division that 
has held the American discourse hos-
tage for the past 11 months was not 
created by an increased desire to en-
gage in contrarian politics. 
Nobody asked for this—for what is 
happening now, no. This is a direct re-
sult of President Biden and the Demo-
crats’ refusal to actually govern and 
deliver for the American people. They 
have been so focused on creating a nar-
rative that they have neglected the 
fundamentals and, ultimately, the peo-
ple who put them into their positions 
of power. 
This isn’t just my opinion. I have 
heard it from thousands of Tennesseans

S8070 
November 15, 2021 
that I have visited with, many over the 
past week. Yes, this is their assump-
tion. It is their assumption that any-
thing the White House does is coming 
from a place of bad faith. It is not com-
ing from ‘‘how do we make the lives of 
Tennesseans and all Americans bet-
ter?’’ It comes from a place of ‘‘how do 
we gut our institutions? How do we roll 
back; and how do we exert our control, 
power, control, government control, 
Big Government?’’ That is what people 
are seeing. 
Think about it. It has taken only 11 
months for the people to lose their 
faith 
in 
this 
administration. 
No 
amount of ad hoc bipartisanship is 
going to pull the Biden administration 
out of the hole that they have dug for 
themselves by refusing to do the bare 
minimum for the American people. 
They have had 11 months to do some-
thing, to do anything, to show us they 
care about more than politics. And the 
fact that they haven’t been willing to 
do that has been probably the biggest 
failure of President Biden to date. 
And I think that is probably saying 
something. When people look at what 
is happening in Washington, here is 
what they are seeing: They see a Presi-
dent who proactively kills jobs, who 
destroyed our potential for energy 
independence, who let conditions along 
our southern border descend into chaos 
rather than challenge the disgraceful 
racial politics pushed by radicals in the 
Democratic Party. And they see their 
elected representatives waging war on 
our most fundamental constitutional 
rights, eroding ballot integrity and 
providing cover for disastrous eco-
nomic policies that have done nothing 
but kill jobs and drive prices through 
the roof. Yes, inflation is real. 
Congressional Democrats have squan-
dered an entire year creating an illu-
sion of enthusiasm for their broken 
agenda, which is a feat they were only 
able to accomplish by refusing to ac-
knowledge the damage caused by their 
reckless tax-and-spending spree. 
If 
they 
had 
even 
pretended 
to 
prioritize appropriations, the debt ceil-
ing, or passing a fiscally responsible 
budget, they might have had a chance 
to salvage a little bit of credibility. 
But, oh, no, that is not what they did. 
The American people are living in 
the real world, where debt burdens 
matter, and you can’t fire up a money 
printer if you blow your budget or have 
a wish list you can’t afford. 
What the American people see isn’t 
just a refusal to govern, but a refusal 
to acknowledge that these problems 
matter. These things actually matter 
to people: how much we spend matters; 
being job and business friendly mat-
ters; integrity, it matters. 
For almost a year, the Biden admin-
istration has been hiding from allega-
tions that the Obama-Biden Justice 
Department spied on an incoming 
President. 
Back in August, I led a letter with 
more than 40 of my Republican col-
leagues demanding an update on the 
status of Special Counsel Durham’s in-
quiry into the Crossfire Hurricane in-
vestigation. 
The American people have been wait-
ing a long time to see those results. 
There is nothing the administration 
can do to force them to accept or even 
tolerate the malice and corruption we 
know fueled the actions of the Obama- 
Biden Justice Department, and equal 
justice matters to the American peo-
ple. 
But I suppose it is too much to ask 
that our chief law enforcement officers 
stay true to the law when the Presi-
dent himself has been so preoccupied 
with this reckless agenda that it ap-
pears he forgot about his role of being 
Commander in Chief. 
In terms of governance, national de-
fense is about as fundamental as it 
gets. And here we are, a week before 
Thanksgiving, and just now we are get-
ting the NDAA to the floor. 
I, along with other members of the 
Armed Services Committee, negotiated 
and deliberated our way through 143 
amendments—many of those bipar-
tisan—and we approved the final prod-
uct 23 to 3. 
Now, that is about as bipartisan as it 
gets. But you haven’t seen that come 
to the floor. Even the House Demo-
crats, working on their own version of 
the bill, have had enough with the Sen-
ate, and they are saying so publicly. 
They understand, just as we do, that 
this country will have to be able to de-
fend itself. 
We should be doing all we can to 
prioritize defense policy because you 
can be sure our competitors and our 
adversaries abroad are doing all they 
can to elevate themselves, to defend 
themselves. 
Tonight, President Biden is sched-
uled to meet virtually with Xi Jinping 
and to discuss ‘‘ways to responsibly 
manage the competition’’ between the 
U.S. and China. 
Only it is really not competition. 
They are our adversary. We don’t need 
a summit to figure out a response to 
Chinese aggression. The solution is 
staring us in the face: If you want to 
manage the competition, you set your-
self up to win the fight. 
That is how you manage your com-
petitors. That is it. No secret. 
And I don’t discount the importance 
of diplomacy, but Xi Jinping and his 
lieutenants in the Chinese Communist 
Party have proven time and again that 
their standing operating procedure is 
rooted in a desire to control the 
world—to control the world—order, 
rather than to work within it. Com-
petition they are not interested in. 
Dominance, yes, they are interested in. 
If we start engaging with China from 
anything other than a position of 
strength, we will lose. And right now, 
Joe Biden projects nothing but weak-
ness. 
For almost 3 years, I have chronicled 
in excruciating detail the war the Chi-
nese 
Communist 
Party 
is 
waging 
against our Nation’s ideals. I have done 
this in hopes that my colleagues across 
the aisle would understand that delay-
ing action or maintaining the status 
quo will not save us from our most bel-
ligerent and dangerous adversary. 
And yet, somehow, seeing it all laid 
out in black and white wasn’t even 
enough to get action. Seeing the evi-
dence of genocide in Xinjiang wasn’t 
enough. 
Reading verified reports that Beijing 
manipulated multiple international or-
ganizations in their shameless coverup 
of the origins of COVID–19—that wasn’t 
enough. 
Listening to Chinese officials threat-
en our pharmaceutical and medical 
supply chains—not enough. 
Watching the Chinese Communist 
Party attack freedom fighters in Hong 
Kong and threaten our friends in Tai-
wan wasn’t enough. 
Seeing the pernicious effects of the 
Belt and Road Initiative on the global 
balance of power wasn’t enough. 
Not even the knowledge that Beijing 
gets closer than ever to testing the 
limits of our nuclear deterrence capa-
bilities—that was not enough. 
Madam President, I yield to the ma-
jority leader. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
thank my colleague from Tennessee for 
yielding, and in a few minutes, I intend 
to take the first procedural step to 
begin consideration of the annual De-
fense policy bill. With cooperation, the 
Senate can and should move through 
this important legislation that we at-
tend to each year. 
This year, we will amend the Defense 
bill to include the U.S. Innovation and 
Competition Act, the historic manufac-
turing and innovation bill that the 
Senate passed earlier this year on a 
strong bipartisan basis and which will 
help tackle our Nation’s supply chain 
crisis. Our supply chain crisis needs at-
tending to, and we cannot wait. Mem-
bers from both sides of the aisle have 
expressed interest in getting this done. 
Passing USICA would be an essential 
far-reaching step that Congress could 
take to help fight inflation, help in-
crease American workers’ wages, and 
relieve strained supply chains, particu-
larly with regard to the current dev-
astating chip shortage that is hurting 
the auto industry, the tech industry, 
and so many other industries. We can-
not allow us to become dependent on 
foreign chips, especially when we do— 
we do the groundbreaking technology. 
We are also working with the Speak-
er and our colleagues in the House and 
Republican colleagues in the Senate to 
find a path forward to get this impor-
tant legislation over the finish line be-
fore the end of the year. 
It is also my intention to have an 
amendment vote on the bipartisan leg-
islation, repealing the 2002 Iraq war 
AUMF. This measure was reported on a 
bipartisan basis out of the Foreign Re-
lations Committee earlier this year,

and the NDAA is the logical place to 
have that vote on the Senate floor. 
The Iraq war has been over for nearly 
a decade. An authorization passed in 
2002 is no longer necessary in 2021. In 
no way will repealing this measure im-
pact our ability to keep Americans safe 
nor impact our relationship with Iraq. 
We will have other votes on amend-
ments on the Defense bill as well. I 
look forward to working with our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle to 
move this important process forward. 
So now I am going to move cloture 
on the NDAA. 
I have some words to say about my 
dear colleague, Senator LEAHY, and 
some words to say on Build Back Bet-
ter, but I will come at a later moment 
because I know my friend from Ten-
nessee is waiting to do those things to-
night.

CHINA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, as I have been saying, it has been 
so difficult to get people to realize 
what we are facing from the Chinese 
Communist Party. They are an adver-
sary, and seeing the evidence of geno-
cide in Xinjiang didn’t seem to be 
enough to persuade people. 
Then you have the reports that Bei-
jing 
manipulated 
multiple 
inter-
national organizations when it comes 
to the origins of the COVID–19 virus. 
That wasn’t enough. 
Hearing the Chinese officials threat-
en our pharmaceutical and medical 
supply chains in the midst of a pan-
demic—that didn’t seem to be enough. 
Watching in horror as the Chinese 
Communist Party threatened the Hong 
Kong freedom fighters and as they have 
threatened our friends in Taiwan—that 
didn’t seem to raise the attention for 
them that this is not our friend. 
They are not a competitor. They are 
an adversary. 
We have seen these effects of the Belt 
and Road Initiative on the global bal-
ance of power. They still haven’t said: 
We have to deal with China. 
Not even Beijing going out here and 
pushing 
their 
nuclear 
power 
has 
seemed to push some of our colleagues 
across the aisle, as they have not paid 
attention to what is happening with 
our nuclear deterrent capabilities and 
what China is doing. 
So it leads a lot of Tennesseans that 
I talk to say: What is it going to take 
for Joe Biden and his administration to 
take these global threats seriously? 
If you look at what is going on in 
China and that doesn’t do it, are you 
looking at Iran? Are you looking at 
Russia and how they are posturing 
troops on the Ukrainian border? 
What is finally going to get them to 
say: China is an adversary, the new 
‘‘axis of evil’’—with Russia, China, 
Iran, and North Korea. These are ad-
versaries. They are intent on global 
dominance and taking us down. 
You know, and I have to tell the Pre-
siding Officer, I think that the answer 
to that question, if we look at these 
threats, it really frightens a lot of peo-
ple. 
When I talk to our veterans, as I did 
last week, many of them—it frightens 
them when they see the nonchalance in 
attitude of this administration as we 
talk about these issues that are threat-
ening our Nation’s security and free-
dom at home and abroad. When you 
talk about inflation, when you talk 
about crime in the streets, when you 
talk about what is happening in our 
schools, when you talk about what is 
happening globally, people see this as a 
threat to their life here. They see it as 
a threat to our security abroad. 
My hope is that what we will see is 
real governance and real leadership 
that will come from the Senate. And 
also we would like to see this come 
from the administration, that people 
would see decisions made in good faith, 
not decisions made in bad faith or try-
ing to dismantle the institutions of 
this government. 
I yield the floor.

INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, for 
many years now, there is a joke that 
Presidents have what is called infra-
structure week, where they talk about 
infrastructure and the need for us to 
move our country forward and fix our 
outdated system of roads and bridges, 
freight lines, our ports. 
We are, as a country, behind others 
countries in terms of investing in in-
frastructure, yet infrastructure week 
comes and goes without any progress. 
Well, today, we had a true infrastruc-
ture week because the President of the 
United States signed legislation that 
came out of this body—it was bipar-
tisan—that helps to repair our infra-
structure in ways that is historic in 
the sense that it is a broader infra-
structure bill than we have passed 
around here in decades. 
It is a big day for infrastructure and, 
therefore, a good day for my constitu-
ents in Ohio and people all around the 
country—people who are stuck in a 
traffic jam or maybe people who are 
worried about the bridge they are 
going over, whether it is safe or not, 
which is the case of a big bridge in my 
community; or whether it is people 
who don’t have access to high-speed 
internet and, therefore, can’t do their 
school work or can’t start a business or 
be able to get their telehealth. If you 
are a veteran in Ohio and you want to 
access telehealth, it is tough to do it in 
about one-third of our State because 
you don’t have high-speed internet. 
So there are a lot of different things 
that are in this legislation that will 
help the people who I represent. We 
have a lot of aging infrastructure in 
Ohio on the water side, so our water in-
frastructure includes a lot of lead pipes 
still, as an example, and, therefore, 
drinking water issues. 
But we also have a lot of edicts that 
have come down from the Federal Gov-
ernment that say you have to stop the 
combined sewer overflow. Our munici-
palities can’t pay for the changes. This 
will help them as well. 
In Cleveland, OH, we have a two-dec-
ade-old—I think it is a 47-year-old 
transit system. The cars, frankly, are 
being taken off track because they 
have gotten to a point where they can’t 
be used any more, and yet it is way too 
expensive. The funding for transit will 
be very helpful in Cleveland, OH. 
In my own community, we have a 
bridge people have been talking about 
fixing for, literally, 25 years, because I 
have been involved in that discussion 
when I was in the House and now in the 
Senate. The problem is the bridge was 
constructed 
assuming 
a 
certain 
amount of traffic, and yet the amount 
of traffic has more than doubled. As a 
result, they have taken the shoulders 
off the bridge in order to create more 
room for another lane. As a result, 
when you have a flat tire or an acci-
dent, God forbid, on the bridge—which, 
unfortunately, 
happens 
too 
often— 
there is no place to go and, therefore, 
causes even more safety hazards. The 
bridge is a bottleneck every single day, 
not just in rush hour. I can go there in 
the afternoon—you know, 2, 3 in the 
afternoon and people are backed up on 
this bridge. 
A lot of the people who are backed 
up, by the way, are people who are in 
business. Eighteen-wheelers are trying 
to get through because it is the con-
fluence of I–71 and I–75, two major 
interstates. So it is a big economic 
issue with all that lost time in com-
muting every day across that bridge, 
and all the lost time in terms of the 
freight has a big economic impact—bil-
lions of dollars, they say. Three per-
cent 
of 
America’s 
commerce 
goes 
across that bridge every day, so it is a 
real problem. 
We have never been able to figure out 
how to fix it because we can’t accumu-
late enough money locally—the State, 
Federal—to be able to make the big 
change that has to occur, which is 
building another bridge, expanding and 
fixing up the current one. It has been 
frustrating. 
This legislation signed today will fi-
nally provide the tools to do that. They 
have to apply like any other project 
around the country. It is a grant that 
is based on merit, but the grant is spe-
cifically focused on major bridges, like 
ours, where you have this economic im-
pact that are so-called functionally ob-
solete, meaning they are carrying more 
traffic than they should be. Ours is car-
rying twice as much. 
It should fit very well, but they are 
going to have to come up with a local 
match as well. I am confident that it 
can be found—a local match, which is 
less than we did before when we had a 
tough time finding that local match 
and were not able to move forward. 
People in my community, they are 
ready for this bridge to be fixed. I 
mean, the Brent Spence Bridge is 
something I have heard about, again, 
during my entire career. 
I got a little bit of funding here and 
there to do the environmental impact 
statement or do the engineering, but to 
actually get in there and do it is going 
to be extremely expensive. You are not 
going to find 2, 3-plus billion dollars 
without this kind of a Federal commit-
ment. That is in this legislation, as an 
example. 
It is also helpful that this legislation 
deals with our ports because one of the 
issues right now we have with the sup-
ply chain crisis is things are just not 
moving through our ports as quickly as 
they should, in part because our ports 
have fallen behind. 
I mentioned other countries who 
spend more infrastructure. Countries 
like China spend a lot on their ports. 
China spends more than we do, as do 
other countries, because they know if 
you spend money on infrastructure, 
you get a more efficient economy that 
leads to higher productivity, and that, 
in turn, leads to economic growth and 
more tax revenue coming in, frankly. 
These are all factors that should be 
considered in looking at an infrastruc-
ture bill. 
It is not like normal spending that 
might be stimulative spending that 
goes out the door right away. This 
spending will happen over 2, 3, 5, 10, 
even 15 years for these major projects. 
And then these assets that you are in-
vesting in—let’s say it is a port, let’s 
say it is freight rail, or let’s say it is 
the bridge in Cincinnati or the infra-
structure that is a water infrastructure 
issue in northeast Ohio because of lead 
pipes—what is fixed will last for a long 
time, so it is an investment in a long- 
term asset. 
Right now, our country is facing his-
torically high levels of inflation—the 
highest inflation we have had in more 
than 30 years. It is a big problem. Ev-
erything has gone up. 
Gas—I heard yesterday now gas has 
gone up 50 percent this year. Two 
weeks ago, it was 42 percent. But all I 
know is it has gone up about a buck a 
gallon. When I fill up my pickup truck, 
I am spending $100 now. That is tough 
for people, particularly people who 
have to commute for their work. 
For lower middle-income families in 
Ohio, this inflation is really dev-
astating. You go to the grocery—I just 
had somebody show me a photograph 
recently that someone took with an 
iPhone of three rib eye steaks for $100 
at Costco. Everything is going up, and 
that is really devastating. 
You wouldn’t want this infrastruc-
ture bill to add to that inflationary 
pressure. The good news is, as econo-
mists look at this, they say that it 
goes into the economy in ways that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8073 
November 15, 2021 
should actually be counterinflationary 
over time. 
What does that mean? 
Well, inflation is where you have too 
much demand and not enough supply, 
right? 
You have, coming off the pandemic, 
more people getting out and buying 
stuff, yet the supply wasn’t there. That 
causes inflation. 
Here in the Congress, we passed legis-
lation that aggravated that—made it 
worse—because we passed $1.9 trillion 
spending in March, much of which went 
into people’s pockets. Think of the 
stimulus checks, $600 more on unem-
ployment insurance, and some of the 
tax provisions. And, in effect, it cre-
ated more demand out there and the 
supply wasn’t there, which raises infla-
tion. 
This spending is different. Again, this 
is not stimulus spending. This is long- 
term spending for capital assets. 
What these economists say, including 
some 
conservatives, 
like 
Michael 
Strain at AEI and Doug Holtz-Eakin at 
American Action Forum, they say this 
is actually going to lead to less infla-
tion because you are adding to the sup-
ply side. 
So by building that bridge, that is 
part of the supply side of the economy 
rather than the demand side of the 
economy. I am pleased with that too. 
What we want right now is to push 
back against this inflation, not do 
something that creates more demand 
and more inflation. 
One of my concerns about the other 
legislation that is being talked about is 
not the infrastructure bill, but it is 
called the reconciliation bill. The 
Democrats, I heard today, are calling it 
Build Back Better more often, but oth-
ers call it the tax-and-spend bill. That 
is about more stimulative spending. 
I have very serious concerns about 
that adding to the inflationary pres-
sures we already have, which are so se-
rious. And unlike what the administra-
tion said previously, it is not transi-
tory. It is going to be around for a 
while. Every economist I talk to says 
expect it to be around for a year or 
two, best-case scenario. 
Again, what we signed today, the in-
frastructure bill, should, over time, ac-
tually have a counterinflationary ef-
fect. Most of the money, again, is not 
going to be spent in the near term. 
Most will be spent over time. But when 
it is spent, it is spent on the supply 
side of the economy rather than the de-
mand side of the economy. 
I am really pleased that we were able 
to pass this legislation. I hope that it 
is not just going to provide a model for 
what we ought to do in terms of sub-
stance—you know, helping make our 
economy more efficient, more produc-
tive; doing things that make sense for 
the people we represent in terms of re-
ducing their commute or making their 
bridges safer, as I said; or dealing with 
the online issue—not having access to 
high-speed internet; being sure that 
people will have safe drinking water. 
But, also, it is important, I think, that 
this bill be looked at as a model of bi-
partisanship. 
What do I mean by that? 
Well, typically, around here, you 
kind of have a Republican or Demo-
cratic approach to something, and we 
kind of fight over it and there is not 
much space in the middle. The rec-
onciliation bill that is being talked 
about right now, as an example, is all 
Democrats. There are no Republicans 
supporting it. 
The question is, how do you tough it 
out through the process? 
And because reconciliation can be 
done with just 50 votes, not 60 votes, 
the notion is you get every Democrat, 
and the Vice President will break the 
tie. 
It is much better, I think, if you do 
something on a bipartisan basis be-
cause you get more buy-in from the 
country. You pass better legislation. It 
makes more sense for our country, like 
this infrastructure bill. 
And the model that was used here 
was that some Republicans and some 
Democrats got together and said: Let’s 
come up with a bipartisan approach to 
infrastructure, working from the mid-
dle out, not taking our directions from 
leadership on the right or on the left— 
Democrat, Republican or the White 
House. Let’s come up with something 
ourselves that makes sense. 
This was in the context of an early 
Biden administration proposal on in-
frastructure. Again, it is confusing be-
cause there are so many different bills 
out there, but this one sort of com-
bined the infrastructure bill that was 
passed today and the so-called Build 
Back Better legislation they are now 
trying to pass. It had high tax in-
creases—significant 
tax 
increases, 
mostly on the corporate side, but 
would affect working families. In my 
view and a lot of people’s views on my 
side of the aisle, everybody was against 
the tax increases. 
Plus it had a lot of what the Biden 
administration called human infra-
structure. It wasn’t just talking about 
core infrastructure, as we talked about 
today, the roads and the bridges and 
the rail and the waterways and other 
things that you would normally think 
of when you think of infrastructure: 
transportation infrastructure, airports, 
the ports. 
Instead it also included a lot of sup-
port for soft infrastructure, as they 
called it, or human infrastructure, 
which in that case was healthcare, tak-
ing care of Medicare changes; some 
changes, 
I 
believe, 
in 
terms 
of 
childcare in the current Build Back 
Better. 
What we said as a group—five Demo-
crats, five Republicans—was we want 
to do infrastructure. This is something 
that has been talked about, again, for-
ever. Every President in modern times, 
every Congress in modern times, has 
promoted the idea of a significant in-
vestment in infrastructure because 
America is falling behind. 
What we said is: Let’s make that 
promise we have given to the American 
people, something that we can actually 
follow through on this time, by having 
a bipartisan bill that has the support of 
both sides. 
So we basically took the bigger bill 
the Biden administration proposed, 
pulled out the taxes—so no tax hikes— 
but also pulled out the so-called human 
infrastructure or soft infrastructure 
and focused just on core infrastructure. 
That was the principle basis upon 
which we went forward. 
The other thing that we decided was 
that not only are we going to keep 
taxes out and focus on core infrastruc-
ture, but we were going to make it 
truly bipartisan, meaning we are going 
to come up with a negotiated settle-
ment and we are going to make conces-
sions on both sides to find that com-
mon ground and get this thing done. 
We are going to do it. 
Sure enough, we did it. It took us 4 or 
5 months. We started 8 months ago and 
passed it here about 5 months ago, but 
we had setbacks because there were 
tough issues we had to grapple with: 
how much money to put into the way 
you expand broadband, as an example, 
and how should it be done through the 
States or through the Fed? 
We came up with ways we thought 
made the most sense, but also could 
pass muster up here in terms of bipar-
tisanship. In the end, as a rule—not in 
all cases, but it is a rule—if it has to be 
bipartisan, if you make that your com-
mitment, you are going to get better 
legislation because you are listening to 
everybody, including to the Governors 
in the case of broadband, including to 
the 
companies 
that 
provide 
the 
broadband, but also including the fami-
lies and the parents who are driving to 
the McDonald’s to get internet access 
for their kid to be able to do her home-
work, and listening to the small busi-
ness entrepreneurs who are saying, We 
need this level of high-speed internet 
to be able to start a successful com-
pany in a rural area—say my home 
State of Ohio—and also listening to 
those who are interested in having 
enough access to internet to be able to 
get their medicine online, basically, to 
telehealth—to do actual discussions 
with medical professionals online rath-
er than having to drive to the hospital, 
say, from a rural area. 
That was all part of what we in-
tended to do, was to not just have a 
good bill substantively, but to show 
you can do this in a bipartisan way. 
That group of 10—5 Democrats and 5 
Republicans—then became 11 Demo-
crats and 11 Republicans. We kind of 
grew out from there. By the end of the 
process, we had Democrats and Repub-
licans supporting the final product, in-
cluding the majority leader CHUCK 
SCHUMER
and the Republican leader 
MITCH
MCCONNELL. They both sup-
ported it. 
And Senator MCCONNELL, in par-
ticular, because I am on the Repub-
lican side, gave us the space to be able

to work this out. He didn’t agree with 
everything that we were doing all the 
time. He let his views be known, of 
course, but he knew that, you know, we 
had in our intentions to come up with 
something that was truly bipartisan 
and good for the country and that in-
frastructure was an area where we 
typically had had bipartisan support, 
but we just couldn’t get it over the line 
because of the partisan gridlock around 
here to do anything. 
And in this case, he gave us that 
space. We came up with a good bill, and 
he supported it, and MITCH
MCCON-
NELL’s support was helpful. In the end, 
19 Republicans supported the legisla-
tion in the House. 
Unfortunately, it went over there a 
few months ago and sat and sat and 
sat, and that concerned some of us be-
cause we could just see it becoming 
more political, more partisan. 
And we had a commitment from 
President Biden and a commitment 
among ourselves—not only no taxes, 
being sure that it focused on core infra-
structure, but also that we would en-
sure that it was delinked from any-
thing else, particularly the larger rec-
onciliation bill that is now being dis-
cussed, the so-called Build Back Better 
bill, but this was separate. We wanted 
our bill to be addressed on its merits, 
which is what our constituents expect. 
The American people don’t want us to 
do Christmas trees up here, where you 
are trading things off. They want to 
know that if you have a good bill, you 
should be able to get it to the floor and 
get it passed, which we did here in the 
Senate, and I appreciate that. 
But in the House, it got all entangled 
with this legislation that was partisan 
that no Republican supported. 
Again, this is the large taxes, large 
spending bill that is called Build Back 
Better, probably $2 trillion of spending. 
I saw some analysis today that if you 
don’t sunset all the spending provi-
sions, it is more like $4.7 trillion, and 
there is about $1.8 trillion in tax in-
creases to pay for that. 
So we will see what happens. I think 
there is going to be a gap in their rev-
enue and their spending based on the 
analysis I have seen, and I just think it 
is the wrong time in the economy, as I 
said earlier, to even think about this 
sort of thing. One, to raise taxes on the 
economy right now, that is, I think, ex-
actly the wrong thing to do. We should 
be helping to encourage those busi-
nesses that are finally coming out of 
this pandemic and have been strug-
gling, don’t have enough workers, to be 
sure that they can get back on their 
feet, not taxing them, and same with 
families, same with the so-called—the 
passthrough companies, the smaller 
companies that would be hurt. 
And then we have got to be sure that 
as we move forward, we are not in-
creasing inflation again and not—this 
stimulus to spending that goes to the 
demand side that puts more money in 
people’s pockets, it is part of the rea-
son we have this high inflation. 
So I really hope that that legislation, 
the Build Back Better legislation, does 
not move forward. 
But my point is, the infrastructure 
bill needed to be dealt with on its own 
and it got tangled up with that and 
that is too bad. But at the end, there 
was a vote permitted finally in the 
House of Representatives. After several 
pledges to have votes that did not hap-
pen, finally, it was voted on about 10 
days ago now. And when that vote oc-
curred, there was enough bipartisan 
support—not as much as I would have 
liked to have seen on the Republican 
side, frankly, because I think it is a 
good bill that Republicans should sup-
port, but there was support on the Re-
publican side and the Democratic side, 
and it was passed into law and sent to 
President Biden, and he signed it 
today. So that is the good news, that 
we were able to get this done, and I 
hope, again, provide, at least in terms 
of what we did here in the Senate, a 
model going forward of finding out 
where can you find consensus between 
Republicans and Democrats on big 
issues that the American people care 
about. 
I mean, we have got plenty of them. 
I would put an issue like immigration, 
what is happening at the border; I 
would put an issue like what is going 
on with our financial situation, with 
this huge new debt we have and the 
deficit spending every year. But there 
are so many issues: healthcare issues, 
issues that have to do with, you know, 
how you deal not just with the immi-
gration on the border but people who 
are here. Shouldn’t we be able to find 
some bipartisan consensus on these 
things, and isn’t that what the Amer-
ican people expect us to do, where you 
have got big challenges, whether they 
are 
domestic 
or 
international, 
shouldn’t we figure out a way, even 
though we have differences of opinion, 
to find that common ground and to 
move forward rather than to be stuck 
in a partisan gridlock situation? 
Today, at the signing ceremony, the 
President spoke a little about that and 
said that he supported bipartisan ef-
forts to move the country forward. 
But by the same token, he also was 
saying he supports this reconciliation 
process that is strictly partisan and 
would be jamming our Congress, again, 
without a single Republican supporting 
it and doing policy that we think is 
wrongheaded, given where we are with 
our economy, particularly with regard 
to inflation and the need to come out 
of this pandemic with a stronger econ-
omy, more people working, and con-
cern that tax increases will make that 
difficult. 
So, again, I would like to congratu-
late everyone who was involved in this 
infrastructure process. It was a big 
group up here in the Senate, but the 
group of five and five—the five Demo-
crats and five Republicans—who kind 
of led the negotiation, included my col-
league KYRSTEN SINEMA, who led the 
Democratic side. She did a terrific job. 
She was very persistent. For those of 
you who know her and have watched 
her, that won’t surprise you. But she 
ensured that we kept on track, and 
sometimes you get off track because 
we had a lot of different issues we had 
to deal with. And it took us, again, a 
few months to get there, but she was 
very helpful in terms of moving us for-
ward and getting to a resolution. 
Ultimately, all 10 Members agreed: 
We are going to resolve this thing. We 
are going to come to a solution, even if 
it means not getting everything we 
want. And nobody gets everything they 
want in life, right? In your family, in 
your business, and in Congress, it is 
pretty much the same thing, and it is 
pretty simple, which is you can’t get 
everything you want, but you can get 
most of what you want, and in this 
case, you can do something great for 
the American people. 
The other eight of those colleagues 
were SUSAN
COLLINS, MITT
ROMNEY, 
LISA
MURKOWSKI, BILL
CASSIDY, JOE 
MANCHIN, JEANNE SHAHEEN, MARK WAR-
NER, JON TESTER, and so many others 
who were also involved and helpful. 
But those were some of the colleagues 
who were part of this G–10 process. 
A couple Members that I would like 
to mention tonight and thank them 
are, again, Senator MCCONNELL for his 
help giving us the space to be able to 
work this out and then ultimately sup-
porting it and lending his critical sup-
port to something that is good for the 
country, good for Kentucky. 
Also, KEVIN CRAMER, on our side of 
the aisle, was very helpful to us in 
bringing together our group of 22 Re-
publicans and Democrats and then 
SHELLEY
MOORE
CAPITO. 
SHELLEY 
MOORE CAPITO is the top Republican on 
the committee that deals with a lot of 
these issues, including the surface 
transportation legislation, and she was 
very helpful, along with the chair of 
that group, TOM
CARPER, to get us 
where we are. They actually met with 
the White House, SHELLEY MOORE CAP-
ITO and a group of her members, and 
that gave us a foundation for some of 
the ideas that we had but also the com-
mittee work we respected. 
One of the things that I have seen 
time and time again in the last couple 
weeks is that it is a $1.2 trillion bill on 
infrastructure. In a way, it is and in a 
way it isn’t. So just to explain that, 
briefly, Congress, you know, every year 
has a process where we appropriate 
funding. We also every 5 years, typi-
cally, do a transportation bill, the Sur-
face Transportation Act. That 1.2 in-
cludes that. So the amount on top of 
what Congress would have otherwise 
spent, based on what the committees 
had done on a bipartisan basis, is 
roughly $542 billion. So it is really a 
$542 billion bill of new spending, not 1.2 
trillion. 
That may make some of my Repub-
lican colleagues feel a little better 
about supporting it because they are 
concerned about our debt and deficit, 
as am I.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8075 
November 15, 2021 
By the way, we came up with ways to 
pay 
for 
that, 
including 
actually 
repurposing some of the funding that 
had gone out to COVID that had not 
been used, but it is really more of a 
$542 billion in new spending—still his-
toric levels and, again, provides enough 
funding to do all the wonderful things 
I talked about in terms of making our 
infrastructure work better for all of us. 
Second is, I have heard a lot over the 
last couple weeks particularly about 
President Biden’s signing his bill, the 
Biden infrastructure bill. He nego-
tiated with us, and I appreciate that. 
His legislation, as I said, was very dif-
ferent. It had the tax increases. It had 
spending on a lot of human infrastruc-
ture, and I appreciate that he was will-
ing to say to the Democratic side of 
the aisle: OK. That is what I want, but 
I am willing to work with you guys on 
a bipartisan basis. So he did do that, 
but he also, again, gave us space to 
work that out here in the Senate be-
tween ourselves, and that is the re-
ality. 
And so when we came together with 
legislation, we were sitting down with 
his people, including a guy named 
Steve Ricchetti, his Deputy Chief of 
Staff, 
and 
the 
National 
Economic 
Council head, a guy named Brian 
Deese, and we negotiated with them on 
some of the issues. 
But this really came out of, again, a 
true bipartisan process. It is not really 
anybody’s bill. It is America’s bill be-
cause representatives from every part 
of the country were involved, and those 
elected representatives made decisions 
that were in the interest of their con-
stituents but also our entire country. 
That is why, in the end, I think this 
legislation represents not just a vic-
tory for the American people, which it 
does, but in a way, a victory for com-
mon sense and bipartisanship that this 
place badly needed. 
I hope it is a template for things to 
come, and I hope that when someone 
goes out on a limb and says: I am going 
to support this legislation because it is 
in the interest of the American people, 
that that person is rewarded rather 
than attacked. 
And in the House I have seen some of 
this with some of my Republican col-
leagues who supported it; that people 
are upset on a partisan basis because 
they think it somehow gives too much 
credit to Democrats if this were to 
pass. 
I mean, I suppose if you took that at-
titude, nothing would pass because it is 
either a Democratic or Republican bill, 
and this other side would block it. We 
need to get into a different mindset, 
where we are thinking, ‘‘What is good 
for the country?’’ 
And, interestingly, when you look at 
what the polling data is saying about 
this bill, it is very popular. Initially, 
the numbers were, you know, 87 per-
cent 
approval 
rating, 
Republicans, 
Democrats, 
Independents, 
everyone. 
One I saw yesterday was 65 percent be-
cause it has gotten, again, some—it has 
gotten into more of the partisan back- 
and-forth, 
with 
Republicans 
saying 
that somehow because President Biden 
is in the Presidency, and he was in-
volved with this, it is his bill. It is not 
his bill. It is all of ours—the bill—but, 
still, 65 percent approval rating is pret-
ty rare for any major piece of legisla-
tion. 
And so the American people get it. 
They want us to move forward. There 
are partisans on both sides, of course, 
who would prefer only that it moves 
forward if it is their way; in other 
words, we should block everything. But 
the vast majority of the American peo-
ple understand that we have got to 
more forward and ensuring that you 
have adequate infrastructure to com-
pete with countries like China, infra-
structure changes that will improve 
our economy’s efficiency, therefore, 
our productivity; therefore, increased 
economic growth; therefore, bringing 
more revenue in. Who could be against 
that? 
There are differences of opinion on 
how exactly you ought to spend the 
money. I get that, but I do think this 
is going to be over time—5 years, 10 
years, 15 years from now—something 
people will look back and say: Aha. 
This project which could never have 
been done, now has been accomplished 
and makes my life easier, makes my 
community work better. That is what 
this bill is going to be about. 
And my hope is that, again, it will be 
a template for other projects in the fu-
ture, where we say: Let’s figure out a 
way—despite our differences—to figure 
out some common ground and move 
forward on these challenges that our 
country faces and on issues that people 
really care about to be able to make 
their lives better. Ultimately, that 
should be our job. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO SHERIFF KEITH CAIN 
Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, few 
sheriffs have accomplished as much, 
served as long, or helped as many as 
Sheriff Keith Cain of Daviess County, 
KY. After 48 years with the Daviess 
County Sheriff’s Department, and 22 
years as sheriff, Keith is retiring this 
year, leaving behind a breathtaking 
legacy of public service. Today, I rec-
ognize Sheriff Cain as a Kentucky hero 
whose record of service stands as an ex-
ample for us all. 
Sheriff Cain loves Daviess County 
and has spent his entire life working to 
protect and defend his fellow Kentuck-
ians. He started his career in the Ma-
rines during the Vietnam war, show-
casing the selflessness and sense of 
duty that would define the rest of his 
life. Upon returning to Kentucky, he 
joined the Daviess County Sheriff’s De-
partment, finding a home among his 
community’s top law enforcement offi-
cers. 
Fast forward nearly half a century, 
and it is clear that Sheriff Cain’s dedi-
cation to his neighbors has not waned a 
bit since he first started his career. By 
pioneering new tactics and techniques, 
he has revolutionized law enforcement 
practices in Daviess County. As a grad-
uate of both the National Sheriff’s In-
stitute and the FBI National Academy, 
Keith brought the technical know-how 
needed to beat any challenge that 
threatened his home community. 
When the addiction crisis started in 
earnest in Western Kentucky, Sheriff 
Cain 
spearheaded 
Daviess 
County’s 
rollout of Operation United Front, a 
program that helped combat the spread 
of illicit substances. He currently 
serves as the chair of the Drug Enforce-
ment Committee of the National Sher-
iff’s Association, using his expertise to 
help communities across the Nation. 
Keith is also a leader in law enforce-
ment training and instruction. He 
served as the chair of the Kentucky 
Law Enforcement Council—the body 
responsible for all police training in 
the Commonwealth——and currently 
works at a local community college as 
a certified law enforcement instructor. 
With nearly five decades of phe-
nomenal public service under his belt, 
it is no surprise that Sheriff Cain has 
received numerous awards from law en-
forcement organizations all across the 
country. There are too many to list, 
but highlights include the Governor’s 
Award for Outstanding Contribution to 
Kentucky Law Enforcement, the Ken-
tucky Sheriff Association’s Sheriff of 
the Year Award, and the National 
Sheriff’s Association Sheriff of the 
Year Award. Keith has been recognized 
by organizations like the NAACP, the 
U.S. Marine Corps Law Enforcement 
Foundation, and the VFW. Needless to 
say, Daviess County will miss him 
dearly when he is gone. 
While Sheriff Cain is retiring, I am 
confident we are not marking the end 
of his lifelong commitment to service. 
As the past half century has shown, 
Keith dedicated his entire life and ca-
reer to care for his neighbors and com-
munity. While he will now have more 
time to spend with his wife Charlotte, 
son Jason, and granddaughters, Alexis 
and Alyssa, I am sure he will also re-
main an ever-present helping hand for 
Daviess County residents. On behalf of 
the Senate, I thank Sheriff Cain for his 
service and congratulate him on his 
well-earned retirement.

S8076 
November 15, 2021 
TRIBUTE TO LYLE ROELOFS 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
when President Lyle Roelofs joined 
Berea College in 2012, the school faced 
threats from many directions. It had 
fallen behind its peer institutions in in-
frastructure and student programming. 
Its endowment soon came under threat 
from partisan efforts that could have 
forced Berea to renege on its promise 
of providing a high-quality, tuition- 
free education to more than 1,600 stu-
dents. But because of the work of 
President Roelofs, the school is now 
thriving like never before. Today, in 
light of President Roelofs’s announce-
ment that he will retire in 2023, I would 
like to pay tribute to one of the most 
generous and hard-working champions 
of higher education in Kentucky. 
It is easy for outsiders to overlook 
Berea College. But nestled between the 
foothills of the Cumberland Mountains 
and the Bluegrass plains is one of the 
most significant institutions of higher 
learning in the entire United States. 
Founded by abolitionists before the 
Civil War, Berea College was the first 
racially integrated and coeducational 
college in the entire American South. 
Berea fostered inclusion and diversity 
at a time when it was difficult—even 
dangerous—to do so. 
That grand history made the threats 
to Berea’s tuition-free model even 
more worrisome. In many ways, the 
school embodies the unique values that 
make America special; it is an institu-
tion where anyone, of any background, 
has a chance to compete, learn new 
skills, and succeed. To some observers, 
though, Berea’s work college system 
seemed 
outdated 
in 
an 
era 
when 
schools offer increasingly flashy amen-
ities for ever-increasing tuition rates. 
Roelofs, however, was firmly com-
mitted to Berea’s foundational prin-
ciples. He quickly got to work to de-
fend the school’s legacy and protect its 
students. Nearly a decade later, the 
fruits of his hard work are apparent. 
Berea has updated its residence halls, 
developed new educational programs, 
restored its surrounding forest eco-
system, and steadily climbed college 
ranking lists. Most importantly, Berea 
College is better equipped than ever to 
remain true to its tuition-free commit-
ment. 
I had the opportunity to get to know 
Lyle when we worked together to pro-
tect his school from an unintended tax 
penalty that arose when partisan law-
makers targeted the ability of schools 
like Berea to use the returns on their 
endowments to provide tuition-free 
education to low-income students. If 
these legislators had been successful, 
they would have forced Berea College 
to abandon its tuition-free promise and 
turn its back on its students, whose 
families make, on average, less than 
$30,000 per year. But because of the 
work of Berea College President Lyle 
Roelofs and his tireless advocacy ef-
forts in Congress, we were able to work 
together to ward off these tax hikes 
and protect Berea College for years to 
come. 
President Roelofs’s leadership and 
care are astounding, and his commit-
ment to Berea College is heroic. I know 
that each student who attends Berea is 
profoundly grateful for his work. On 
behalf of the Senate, I would like to 
congratulate President Roelofs on his 
well-earned retirement and thank him 
for his service to the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky. 
f 
INTEL AUTHORIZATION 
WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
September 23, 2021, I inserted for the 
record an explanation of my intent to 
hold the Intel Authorization Act be-
cause I was concerned with changes 
made to the whistleblower protections. 
Specifically, it would have prevented 
whistleblowers from going to any com-
mittee that had jurisdiction over the 
matter they were reporting on. 
I was also concerned that this bill 
could inadvertently overturn protec-
tions that I authored in 2016 for FBI 
whistleblowers. 
I have long advocated that whistle-
blowers should have as many avenues 
as possible to report waste, fraud, and 
abuse. So I placed a hold and made two 
simple requests: first, that the law per-
mit whistleblowers to report wrong-
doing to any committee of jurisdiction; 
and second, that language be inserted 
to clarify that nothing in this bill over-
turns protections guaranteed for FBI 
whistleblowers under the FBI Whistle-
blower Protection Enhancement Act. 
I am happy to report that Chairman 
WARNER and Ranking Member RUBIO 
agreed to incorporate these changes 
into the Intel Authorization Act. 
I would like to take this opportunity 
to commend both Senators WARNER 
and RUBIO for their commitment to 
supporting whistleblowers. Thanks to 
them, Congress is on the verge of pass-
ing much needed reforms with regard 
to how whistleblower complaints in the 
intel community are handled. I would 
also like to thank EMPOWER and the 
many whistleblower advocacy groups 
that wrote the Senate Intelligence 
Committee to show the need for these 
changes. 
However, the job is still not done, 
and the House must agree to support 
these changes. As such, I urge members 
of the House Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence to support these 
much needed changes. 
f 
ARMS SALES NOTIFICATION 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, sec-
tion 36(b) of the Arms Export Control 
Act requires that Congress receive 
prior notification of certain proposed 
arms sales as defined by that statute. 
Upon such notification, the Congress 
has 30 calendar days during which the 
sale may be reviewed. The provision 
stipulates that, in the Senate, the noti-
fication of proposed sales shall be sent 
to the chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
In keeping with the committee’s in-
tention to see that relevant informa-
tion is available to the full Senate, I 
ask unanimous consent to have printed 
in the RECORD the notifications which 
have been received. If the cover letter 
references a classified annex, then such 
annex is available to all Senators in 
the office of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, room SD–423. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

and logistical support services; and other re-
lated elements of logistical and program sup-
port. The total estimated cost is $650 mil-
lion. 
This proposed sale will support U.S. for-
eign policy and national security of the 
United States by helping to improve the se-
curity of a friendly country that continues 
to be an important force for political and 
economic progress in the Middle East. 
The proposed sale will improve Saudi Ara-
bia’s capability to meet current and future 
threats by increasing its stocks of medium- 
range missiles for its fighter aircraft fleet 
for its national defense. This potential sale 
will support Saudi Arabia’s Eurofighter Ty-
phoon, F–15C/D, F–15S, and F–I5SA programs 
and will further strengthen the interoper-
ability between the United States and Saudi 
Arabia. Saudi Arabia will have no difficulty 
absorbing these missiles into its armed 
forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Raytheon, 
Waltham, MA. There are no known offset 
agreements in connection with this potential 
sale; however the purchaser typically re-
quests offsets. Any offset agreement will be 
defined in negotiations between the pur-
chaser and the contractor. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to Saudi Arabia. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AIM–120C–7/C–8 AMRAAM is a super-
sonic, air launched, aerial intercept, guided 
missile featuring digital technology and 
micro-miniature 
solid-state 
electronics. 
AMRAAM capabilities include look-down/ 
shoot-down, multiple launches against mul-
tiple targets, resistance to electronic coun-
termeasures, and interception of high-and 
low-flying and maneuvering targets. The 
AIM–120C–8 is a form, fit, function refresh of 
the AIM–120C–7 and is the next generation to 
be produced. 
2. The highest level of classification of in-
formation included in this potential sale is 
SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities. 
4. A determination has been made that the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia can provide sub-
stantially the same degree of protection for 
the sensitive technology being released as 
the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary 
in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and 
national security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal are authorized for release

50th 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
MIL-
WAUKEE 
METROPOLITAN 
COM-
MUNITY CHURCH 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, today 
I rise to recognize the 50th anniversary 
of Milwaukee Metropolitan Commu-
nity Church in Milwaukee, WI, an in-
clusive Christian community of faith. 
Milwaukee Metropolitan Community 
Church began as Prince of Peace Met-
ropolitan Community Church in 1971 
under the leadership of Reverend Paul 
Sydman. It was renamed Metropolitan 
Community Church in 1977 and finally 
Milwaukee Metropolitan Community 
Church in 1993. 
In its first 20 years, the church 
changed worship locations multiple 
times within the city of Milwaukee and 
held services in other churches before 
establishing its current home at 1239 
West Mineral Street in Milwaukee’s 
Walker’s Point neighborhood in 1993. 
With this purchase, the church became 
the first LGBTQI+ organization to own 
property in the city of Milwaukee, as 
well as the entire State of Wisconsin. 
Milwaukee Metropolitan Community 
Church—MCC—is the oldest LGBTQI+ 
organization still in existence in Mil-
waukee and the State ofWisconsin. The 
church was originally started to pro-
vide a place for LGBTQI+ people to 
worship and has a long tradition of 
welcoming all people looking for a spir-
itual place where they can feel wel-
comed and accepted. It became a mem-
ber of the Global Movement of Metro-
politan Community Churches in 1984. 
This denomination was founded by the 
Lesbian, 
Gay, 
Bisexual 
and 
Transgender—LGBT—community 
in 
1968. 
Current Pastor Reverend Tory V. 
Topjian began his pastorate as senior 
minister on June 1, 2016. It was within 
his first 10 days of service that the 
country and the LGBT community ex-
perienced the great tragedy of the 
Pulse Night Club shooting in Orlando, 
FL. Reverend Tory and Milwaukee 
Metropolitan Community Church took 
an active role in helping the Mil-
waukee community grieve following 
the shooting. 
In 2020, after waiting for nearly 20 
years, both the Interfaith Conference 
of Greater Milwaukee and the Wis-
consin Council of Churches finally rec-
ognized 
Metropolitan 
Community 
Churches to be a viable and important 
community of faith. Milwaukee MCC 
was invited to sit on councils of both 
these vital community organizations 
and offered a well-deserved voice and 
vote. 
Milwaukee Metropolitan Community 
Church, like most churches, adjusted 
and adapted to the pandemic and its 
impact on church community since the 
spring of 2020. Virtual worship and pro-
gramming were offered to keep the 
congregation safe while maintaining 
community. 
The year 2021 marks 50 years since 
the beginning of this important com-
munity within Milwaukee, WI, and the 
LGBTQ community. A welcoming place 
for all, its foundation is built on com-
munity and inclusiveness. Earlier this 
year, the Milwaukee Historical Society 
honored this community being the old-
est LGBTQI+ organization still in ex-
istence. Its significance and impact on 
countless members over the years is 
profound. Please join me in celebrating 
this historically and spiritually impor-
tant community.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING FRANK ZULLO 
∑
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
I rise today with a heavy heart to pay 
tribute to Frank Zullo, an extraor-
dinary public servant who passed away 
on May 26, 2018, at the age of 85. 
Born and raised in Norwalk, CT, 
Frank started his law practice in 1957 
in his hometown. The next year, the 
Norwalk Junior Chamber of Commerce 
named him ‘‘Young Man of the Year.’’ 
He was elected mayor of Norwalk in 
1965. At only 33 years old, Frank was 
the youngest mayor in the city’s his-
tory, in addition to being their first 
Italian-American mayor. 
Throughout his three terms, Frank 
worked closely with the people of Nor-
walk, listening to their concerns and 
striving to initiate positive change. 
Against the backdrop of the civil rights 
movement, the Vietnam war, and the 
Cold War, Frank faced local challenges 
head on and diligently united his con-
stituents. Frank was known for his 
compassion and did everything he 
could to make Norwalk a welcoming 
city for all of its residents. 
Frank became a symbol of the city, 
and his leadership ushered in a new era 
of participation in Connecticut poli-
tics, in which residents saw the dif-
ference they could make as part of his 
administration. His legacy is enduring, 
and for the rest of his lifetime, Frank 
was often called upon for guidance by 
his successors, who recognized his re-
markable accomplishments. He also 
helped establish the Connecticut Con-
ference of Mayors and served on the ex-
ecutive board of the U.S. Conference of 
Mayors as a trustee and member. 
Admired for his lively spirit and giv-
ing personality, Frank committed him-
self to serving Norwalk in a multitude 
of ways, both when he was mayor and 
when he returned to practicing law. 
One notable example includes his role 
as chair of the Norwalk-Wilton Chapter 
of the American Red Cross Board’s 
Water Safety Program, in which he 
taught 
hundreds 
of 
young 
people 
lifeguarding and swimming skills. He 
also chaired the Board of Trustees of 
Norwalk Hospital and the University of 
Bridgeport, chaired the First Taxing 
District Water Department, and served 
as a member of the Board of Trustees 
for the Maritime Aquarium at Nor-
walk. 
Following Frank’s passing, a memo-
rial rose garden was constructed in his 
honor by the First Taxing District of 
the City of Norwalk. Though the 
celebratory programs were canceled be-
cause of the COVID–19 pandemic, the 
Frank N. Zullo Memorial Rose Garden 
stands as a fitting tribute to a man

RECOGNIZING ALBERT BROS., INC. 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today I rise to recognize Albert Bros., 
Inc., as it celebrates 125 years of out-
standing industry in Connecticut. 
The company began with Nathan and 
Lewis Albert peddling scrap metal 
across Connecticut upon their arrival 
in Waterbury from Lithuania. In 1895, 
the Alberts, demonstrating the entre-
preneurial skill and energy for which 
our Nation is known, opened their own 
scrap yard, establishing Albert Bros., 
Inc. 
Over the past century and a quarter, 
Albert Bros. has grown into one of New 
England’s foremost scrap metal recy-
clers and processors, using Connecticut 
ingenuity to turn waste products into 
productive materials. Their exemplary 
work has earned them accolades from 
the State of Connecticut and recogni-
tion on an international scale. 
Though they reached their 125th an-
niversary during the COVID–19 pan-
demic and were unable to celebrate, Al-
bert Bros. has marked this milestone 
by relocating their offices and signifi-
cant warehouse and processing facili-
ties to a new location. In September of 
this year, they officially moved to the 
site of the old Waterbury Rolling Mills, 
giving their plant an impressive new 
setup as they continue to serve the 
people of Connecticut and beyond. 
Albert Bros. is now in its fourth gen-
eration of family ownership and re-
mains unstintingly committed to inno-
vation, 
thoughtful 
expansion, 
and 
workplace safety. I had the privilege of 
visiting the company and speaking 
with a number of employees, and I can 
attest firsthand to their remarkable, 
dedicated work ethic. 
As Albert Bros. celebrates its anni-
versary and establishes its new plant, I 
applaud the company on its extraor-
dinary record of accomplishment. I 
hope my colleagues will join me in con-
gratulating Albert Bros., Inc, on over 
125 years of excellence.∑ 
f 
REMEMBERING CHARLES ‘‘CHUCK’’ 
LEWIS 
∑ Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to remember a Montanan that 
made an indelible impact on Wash-
ington, DC, and on Montana. 
Chuck Lewis was a native Montanan, 
born in Bozeman, a journalist, and a fa-
ther. As a young man, Chuck served his 
country proudly as a Marine Corps Re-
servist, but he made his career in the 
news business, which is how many of 
my colleagues herein the Senate knew 
him best. 
Chuck served as bureau chief here in 
Washington, DC, for both the Associ-
ated Press and Hearst Newspapers, 
where he spent a lifetime holding the 
powerful to account and shining a light 
on the inner workings of our govern-
ment. 
He covered many explosive stories 
over his career, including the Iran- 
Contra scandal and the civil rights 
movement, and won acclaim for his 
work revealing the truth about friend-
ly fire during the Gulf war. And his leg-
acy is still visible in Washington 
today, through the scores of young 
journalists he helped train and mentor 
throughout the years. 
I served in the Senate for the last few 
years before Chuck retired—in 2013, he 
invited me to speak at the Gridiron 
Club for his inauguration as club presi-
dent, an honor and a privilege I will 
never forget. 
Chuck was a consummate newsman, 
a reporters’ reporter, and a friend to 
democracy. He made Montana and his 
country proud, and I can think of no 
better way to honor his memory than 
by enshrining it in the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD here today.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mr. DURBIN, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, 
Mr. MARKEY, Mr. BOOKER, Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Ms. WARREN, and 
Mr. SANDERS): 
S. 3212. A bill to provide benefits for 
noncitizen members of the Armed 
Forces, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the Veteran Deportation 
Prevention and Reform Act. 
This legislation would ensure that 
noncitizen servicemembers have access 
to the information and resources they 
need to apply for citizenship in the 
United States and avoid deportation 
from the country they have served. 
The Veteran Deportation Prevention 
and Reform Act includes important 
changes to ensure that servicemembers 
are not removed from the United 
States after leaving the military be-
cause they were never provided the re-
sources necessary to ensure they could 
adjust their status. The bill would also 
protect servicemembers’ spouses and 
children from deportation. 
Specifically, this bill would require 
the Department of Homeland Security, 
DHS and the Department of Defense to 
create a program to help ensure that 
servicemembers 
and 
their 
families 
have a pathway to naturalization. The 
program must also include training for 
JAG officers and recruiter training on 
the 
naturalization 
process 
for 
servicemembers. These personnel must 
also work with the U.S. Citizenship and 
Immigration Services Agency to ensure 
that 
all 
noncitizen 
military 
servicemembers are naturalized before 
they leave the service. 
The bill would also create the Mili-
tary 
Family 
Immigation 
Advisory 
Committe 
that 
must 
provide 
rec-
ommendations to DHS on whether a 
noncitizen who has served in the mili-
tary or their family members should be 
granted a stay of removal, deferred ac-
tion, parole, or be removed from the 
country. 
ICE, CBP, and USCIS are directed to 
transfer case materials of individuals 
in removal proceedings for individuals 
who are determined to be a member of 
the Armed Forces, a veteran, or a cov-
ered family member of the advisory 
committee. These individuals cannot 
be removed until a recommendation is 
issued by the advisory committee. 
Finally, the bill would require DHS 
to establish a program and application 
to allow removed veterans and their 
family members to be admitted back 
into the United States as lawful perma-
nent residents and would direct the De-
partment of Justice to reopen their re-
moval cases. 
Our noncitizen servicemembers have 
risked their lives serving our country. 
For over a century, the United States 
has recognized the contributions that 
noncitizens make in the military. They 
deserve a clear path to citizenship for 
themselves and their spouses and chil-
dren. 
Over the past several years, programs 
to help facilitate these processes have 
diminished, and this lack of support 
from Federal Agencies has made it 
more 
difficult 
for 
noncitizen 
servicemembers to become U.S. citi-
zens. Veterans who are unable to natu-
ralize are at risk of deportation if they 
commit certain crimes and are forced 
to leave the country they served. Many 
of these individuals believe that they 
are citizens already due to their service 
and are shocked they are not, years 
later. 
It is imperative that we work to pro-
tect our noncitizen veterans from de-
portation and that we bring back those 
veterans who were removed from the 
United States. These veterans have 
shown nothing but loyalty to the 
United States, and they deserve to stay 
here, receive their benefits, and live 
fulfilling lives alongside their family 
members.

of Defense, for military construction, 
and for defense activities of the De-
partment of Energy, to prescribe mili-
tary personnel strengths for such fiscal 
year, and for other purposes; which was 
ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 
lll. 
INCREASING 
THE 
CAPACITY 
OF 
STATES AND PARTNER COUNTRIES 
TO 
COUNTER 
CORRUPTION 
AND 
MONEY LAUNDERING SCHEMES RE-
LATED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Not Allowing Revenue for 
Criminal Organizations Act’’ or ‘‘NARCO 
Act’’. 
(b) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) 
Drug 
trafficking 
organizations, 
transnational criminal organizations, and 
money laundering organizations prey upon 
individuals suffering from substance use dis-
orders and exploit the financial systems of 
the United States to sustain their criminal 
enterprises. 
(2) The illicit drug trade in the United 
States 
is 
conservatively 
valued 
at 
$150,000,000,000 annually, making it worth 
more than the gross domestic product of ap-
proximately 150 countries. 
(3) More than 93,000 individuals in the 
United States died from drug overdoses in 
2020. 
(4) 
Drug 
trafficking 
organizations, 
transnational criminal organizations, and 
money laundering organizations perpetuate 
crime, corruption, and kleptocracy, which 
undermines the rule of law and erodes demo-
cratic institutions in foreign countries while 
threatening the national security of the 
United States. 
(5) Understanding and attacking the finan-
cial networks, both in the United States and 
abroad, that enable drug trafficking organi-
zations, transnational criminal organiza-
tions, and money laundering organizations is 
critical to disrupting and dismantling those 
organizations. 
(6) As such, the national drug control 
strategy of the United States should include 
an explicit focus, goals, and metrics related 
to mapping, tracking, attacking, and dis-
mantling the financial networks of drug traf-
ficking organizations, transnational crimi-
nal organizations, and money laundering or-
ganizations. 
(7) Uniform application of anti-money 
laundering laws and information sharing will 
enhance the ability of the Federal Govern-
ment and State governments to dismantle 
drug trafficking organizations, transnational 
criminal organizations, and money laun-
dering organizations. 
(8) The Financial Action Task Force estab-
lishes international standards that aim to 
prevent money laundering associated with 
the illicit drug trade and other illegal activi-
ties, and is supported by more than 200 im-
plementing countries and jurisdictions, in-
cluding the United States. In its 2016 Mutual 
Evaluation Report of the United States, the 
Task Force found that while Federal law en-
forcement 
agencies 
aggressively 
target 
money laundering cases, ‘‘State law enforce-
ment authorities can complement Federal 
efforts, but more typically pursue State- 
level law enforcement priorities. Among the 
States, there is no uniform approach and lit-
tle data is available. Where information was 
provided, it tended to suggest that [money 
laundering] is not prioritised by the State 
authorities.’’. 
(9) It is in the best national security inter-
est of the United States to increase the ca-
pacity of States and partner countries to 
identify, investigate, and prosecute corrup-
tion and money laundering schemes that di-
rectly benefit drug trafficking organizations, 
transnational criminal organizations, and 
money laundering organizations. 
(c) GAO REPORT.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 2 years 
after the date of enactment of this Act, and 
annually thereafter, the Comptroller Gen-
eral of the United States shall submit to the 
Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate, 
the Caucus on International Narcotics Con-
trol of the Senate, the Committee on the Ju-
diciary of the House of Representatives, and 
the Director of National Drug Control Policy 
an assessment of— 
(A) the number and status of investiga-
tions and prosecutions across National Drug 
Control Program agencies (as defined in sec-
tion 702 of the Office of National Drug Con-
trol Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 (21 
U.S.C. 1701)) with a drug trafficking and 
money laundering and illicit finance nexus, 
unless the disclosure of such information 
would reveal information protected by rule 
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce-
dure or a court order; and 
(B) the amount of money and other things 
of value in various forms, including tangible 
and digital assets, and property criminally 
seized by or forfeited to the Federal Govern-
ment on an annual basis from individuals as-
sociated with drug trafficking, drug traf-
ficking organizations, transnational crimi-
nal organizations, or money laundering orga-
nizations, which shall be— 
(i) adjusted to eliminate duplication in the 
case of seizures or forfeitures carried out and 
reported by multiple agencies; and 
(ii) disaggregated by agency. 
(2) CLASSIFIED
ANNEX.—The Comptroller 
General may provide the assessment under 
paragraph (1), or a portion thereof, in a clas-
sified annex if necessary. 
(d) TECHNICAL UPDATES TO OFFICE OF NA-
TIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY REAUTHORIZA-
TION ACT OF 1998.— 
(1) DEFINITION
OF ‘‘SUPPLY
REDUCTION’’.— 
Section 702(17) of the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 
(21 U.S.C. 1701(17)) is amended— 
(A) by redesignating subparagraphs (G) and

tively; and 
(B) by inserting after subparagraph (F) the 
following: 
‘‘(G) activities to map, track, dismantle, 
and disrupt the financial networks of drug 
trafficking 
organizations, 
transnational 
criminal organizations, and money laun-
dering organizations involved in the manu-
facture and trafficking of drugs in the 
United States and in foreign countries;’’. 
(2) CONTENTS
OF
NATIONAL
DRUG
CONTROL 
STRATEGY.—Section 706(c)(1)(L) of the Office

been designated as major money laundering 
countries under section 489 of the Foreign

order to—

and Mr. RUBIO) submitted an amend-
ment intended to be proposed to 
amendment SA 3867 submitted by Mr. 
REED and intended to be proposed to 
the bill H.R. 4350, to authorize appro-

for defense activities of the Depart-
ment of Energy, to prescribe military 
personnel strengths for such fiscal

ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of title XII, add the following: 
Subtitle H—U.S.-Greece Defense and 
Interparliamentary Partnership Act of 2021 
SEC. 1291. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘U.S.- 
Greece Defense and Interparliamentary Part-
nership Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 1292. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The United States and Greece are 
strong allies in the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) and have deepened 
their defense relationship in recent years in 
response to growing security challenges in 
the Eastern Mediterranean region. 
(2) Greece participates in several NATO 
missions, including Operation Sea Guardian 
in the Mediterranean and NATO’s mission in 
Kosovo. 
(3) The Eastern Mediterranean Security 
and Energy Partnership Act (title II of divi-
sion J of Public Law 116–94), authorized new 
security assistance for Greece and Cyprus, 
lifted the United States prohibition on arms 
transfers to Cyprus, and authorized the es-
tablishment of a United States-Eastern Med-
iterranean Energy Center to facilitate en-
ergy cooperation among the United States, 
Greece, Israel, and Cyprus. 
(4) The United States has demonstrated its 
support for the trilateral partnership of 
Greece, Israel, and Cyprus through joint en-
gagement with Cyprus, Greece, Israel, and 
the United States in the ‘‘3+1’’ format. 
(5) The United States and Greece have held 
Strategic Dialogue meetings in Athens, 
Washington D.C., and virtually, and have 
committed to hold an upcoming Strategic 
Dialogue session in 2021 in Washington, D.C. 
(6) In October 2019, the United States and 
Greece agreed to update the United States- 
Greece Mutual Defense Cooperation Agree-
ment, and the amended agreement officially 
entered into force on February 13, 2020. 
(7) The amended Mutual Defense Coopera-
tion Agreement provides for increased joint 
United States-Greece and NATO activities at 
Greek 
military 
bases 
and 
facilities 
in 
Larissa, Stefanovikio, Alexandroupolis, and 
other parts of central and northern Greece, 
and allows for infrastructure improvements 
at the United States Naval Support Activity 
Souda Bay base on Crete. 
(8) In October 2020, Greek Foreign Minister 
Nikos Dendias announced that Greece hopes 
to further expand the Mutual Defense Co-
operation Agreement with the United States. 
(9) The United States Naval Support Activ-
ity Souda Bay serves as a critical naval lo-
gistics hub for the United States Navy’s 6th 
Fleet. 
(10) In June 2020, United States Ambas-
sador to Greece Geoffrey Pyatt characterized 
the importance of Naval Support Activity 
Souda Bay as ‘‘our most important platform 
for the projection of American power into a 
strategically dynamic Eastern Mediterra-
nean region. From Syria to Libya to the 
chokepoint of the Black Sea, this is a criti-
cally important asset for the United States, 
as our air force, naval, and other resources 
are applied to support our Alliance obliga-
tions and to help bring peace and stability.’’. 
(11) The USS Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams, 
the second of a new class of United States 
sea-basing ships, is now based out of Souda 
Bay, the first permanent United States naval 
deployment at the base. 
(12) The United States cooperates with the 
Hellenic 
Armed 
Forces 
at 
facilities 
in 
Larissa, Stefanovikio, and Alexandroupolis, 
where the United States Armed Forces con-
duct training, refueling, temporary mainte-
nance, storage, and emergency response. 
(13) The United States has conducted a 
longstanding International Military Edu-
cation and Training (IMET) program with 
Greece, and the Government of Greece has 
committed to provide $3 for every dollar in-
vested by the United States in the program. 
(14) Greece’s defense spending in 2020 
amounted to an estimated 2.68 percent of its 
gross domestic product (GDP), exceeding 
NATO’s 2 percent of GDP benchmark agreed 
to at the 2014 NATO Summit in Wales. 
(15) Greece is eligible for the delivery of ex-
cess defense articles under section 516(c)(2) of 
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 
2321j(c)(2)). 
(16) In September 2020, Greek Prime Min-
ister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced plans 
to modernize all three branches of the Hel-
lenic Armed Forces, which will strengthen 
Greece’s military position in the Eastern 
Mediterranean. 
(17) The modernization includes upgrades 
to the arms of all three branches, including 
new anti-tank weapons for the Hellenic 
Army, new heavy-duty torpedoes for the Hel-
lenic Navy, and new guided missiles for the 
Hellenic Air Force. 
(18) The Hellenic Navy also plans to up-
grade its four MEKO 200HN frigates and pur-
chase four new multirole frigates of an un-
disclosed type, to be accompanied by 4 MH- 
60R anti-submarine helicopters. 
(19) The Hellenic Air Force plans to fully 
upgrade its fleet of F–16 jets to the F–16 
Viper variant by 2027 and has expressed in-
terest in participating in the F–35 Joint 
Strike Fighter program. 
SEC. 1293. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) Greece is a pillar of stability in the 
Eastern 
Mediterranean 
region 
and 
the 
United States should remain committed to 
supporting its security and prosperity; 
(2) the 3+1 format of cooperation among 
Cyprus, Greece, Israel, and the United States 
has been a successful forum to cooperate on 
energy issues and should be expanded to in-
clude other areas of common concern to the 
members; 
(3) the United States should increase and 
deepen efforts to partner with and support 
the modernization of the Greek military; 
(4) it is in the interests of the United 
States that Greece continue to transition its 
military equipment away from Russian-pro-
duced 
platforms 
and 
weapons 
systems 
through the European Recapitalization In-
vestment Program; 
(5) the United States Government should 
continue to deepen strong partnerships with 
the Greek military, especially in co-develop-
ment and co-production opportunities with 
the Greek Navy; 
(6) the naval partnerships with Greece at 
Souda Bay and Alexandroupolis are mutu-
ally beneficial to the national security of the 
United States and Greece; 
(7) the United States should, as appro-
priate, support the sale of F–35 Joint Strike 
Fighters to Greece; 
(8) the United States Government should 
continue to invest in International Military 
Education and Training (IMET) programs in 
Greece; 
(9) the United States Government should 
support joint maritime security cooperation 
exercises with Cyprus, Greece, and Israel; 
(10) in accordance with its legal authorities 
and project selection criteria, the United 
States Development Finance Corporation 
should consider supporting private invest-
ment in strategic infrastructure projects in 
Greece, to include shipyards and ports that 
contribute to the security of the region and 
Greece’s prosperity; 
(11) the extension of the Mutual Defense 
Cooperation Agreement with Greece for a pe-
riod of five years includes deepened partner-
ships at Greek military facilities throughout 
the country and is a welcome development; 
and 
(12) the United States Government should 
establish the United States-Eastern Medi-
terranean Energy Center as authorized in 
the Eastern Mediterranean Energy and Secu-
rity Partnership Act of 2019. 
SEC. 1294. FUNDING FOR EUROPEAN RECAPITAL-
IZATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—To the maximum extent 
feasible, of the funds appropriated for the 
European Recapitalization Incentive Pro-
gram, $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022 
through 2026 should be considered for Greece 
as appropriate to assist the country in meet-
ing its defense needs and transitioning away 
from Russian-produced military equipment. 
(b) REPORT.—Not later than 180 days after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of State shall submit to the appro-

lent conflict in Afghanistan has forcibly dis-
placed an estimated 655,000 civilians, and 80 
percent of those forced to flee are women and 
children. 
(2) Since regaining control of Afghanistan 
in August 2021, the Taliban have taken ac-
tions reminiscent of their brutal rule in the 
late 1990s, including by cracking down on 
protesters, detaining and beating journalists, 
reestablishing the Ministry for the Pro-
motion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, and 
requiring women to study at universities in 
gender-segregated classrooms while wearing 
Islamic attire. 
(3) Until the Taliban assumed control of 
the country in August 2021, the women and 
girls of Afghanistan had achieved much since

2001, even as insecurity, poverty, under-
development, and patriarchal norms contin-
ued to limit their rights and opportunities in 
much of Afghanistan. 
(4) Through strong support from the United 
States and the international community— 
(A) female enrollment in public schools in 
Afghanistan continued to increase through 
2015, with an estimated high of 50 percent of 
school age girls attending; and 
(B) by 2019— 
(i) women held political leadership posi-
tions, and women served as ambassadors; and 
(ii) women served as professors, judges, 
prosecutors, defense attorneys, police, mili-
tary members, health professionals, journal-
ists, humanitarian and developmental aid 
workers, and entrepreneurs. 
(5) Efforts to empower women and girls in 
Afghanistan continue to serve the national 
interests of Afghanistan and the United 
States because women are sources of peace 
and economic progress. 
(6) With the return of Taliban control, the 
United States has little ability to preserve 
the human rights of women and girls in Af-
ghanistan, and those women and girls may 
again 
face 
the 
intimidation 
and 
marginalization they faced under the last 
Taliban regime. 
(7) Women and girls in Afghanistan are 
again facing gender-based violence, includ-
ing— 
(A) forced marriage; 
(B) intimate partner and domestic vio-
lence; 
(C) sexual harassment; 
(D) sexual violence, including rape; 
(E) denial of resources; and 
(F) emotional and psychological violence. 
(8) Gender-based violence has always been 
a significant problem in Afghanistan and is 
expected to become more widespread with 
the Taliban in control. In 2020, even before 
the Taliban assumed control of the country, 
Human Rights Watch projected that 87 per-
cent of Afghan women and girls will experi-
ence at least one form of gender-based vio-
lence in their lifetime, with 62 percent expe-
riencing multiple incidents of such violence. 
(9) Prior to the Taliban takeover in August 
2021, approximately 7,000,000 people in Af-
ghanistan lacked or had limited access to es-
sential health services as a result of inad-
equate public health coverage, weak health 
systems, and conflict-related interruptions 
in care. 
(10) Women and girls faced additional chal-
lenges, as their access to life-saving services, 
such as emergency obstetric services, was 
limited due to a shortage of female medical 
staff, cultural barriers, stigma and fears of 
reprisals following sexual violence, or other 
barriers to mobility, including security 
fears. 
(11) Only approximately 50 percent of preg-
nant women and girls in Afghanistan deliver 
their children in a health facility with a pro-
fessional attendant, which increases the risk 
of complications in childbirth and prevent-
able maternal mortality. 
(12) Food insecurity in Afghanistan is also 
posing a variety of threats to women and 
girls, as malnutrition weakens their immune 
systems and makes them more susceptible to 
infections, complications during pregnancy, 
and risks during childbirth. 
(13) With the combined impacts of ongoing 
conflict and COVID–19, Afghan households 
increasingly resort to child marriage, forced 
marriage, and child labor to address food in-
security and other effects of extreme pov-
erty. 
(14) In Afghanistan, the high prevalence of 
anemia among adolescent girls reduces their 
ability to survive childbirth, especially when 
coupled with high rates of child marriage 
and forced marriage and barriers to access-
ing safe health services and information. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) since 2001, organizations and networks 
promoting the empowerment of women and 
girls have been important engines of social, 
economic, and political development in Af-
ghanistan; 
(2) any future political order in Afghani-
stan should secure the political, economic, 
and social gains made by Afghan women and 
work to increase the equal treatment of 
women and girls and improve the safe access 
for women and girls to essential services and 
information through laws and policies per-
taining to public and private life; 
(3) respecting the human rights of all peo-
ple is essential to securing lasting peace and 
sustainable development in Afghanistan; 
(4) in cooperation with international part-
ners, the United States must endeavor to 
preserve the hard-won gains made in Afghan-
istan during the past two decades, particu-
larly as related to the social, economic and 
political empowerment of women and girls in 
society; 
(5) the continued provision of humani-
tarian assistance in Afghanistan should be 
targeted toward the most vulnerable, includ-
ing for the protection, education, and well- 
being of women and girls; 
(6) immediate and ongoing humanitarian 
needs in Afghanistan can only be met by a 
humanitarian response that includes formal 
agreements between local nongovernmental 
organizations and international partners 
that promotes the safe access and participa-
tion of female staff at all levels and across 
functional roles among all humanitarian ac-
tors; and 
(7) a lack of aid and essential services 
would exacerbate the current humanitarian 
crisis and serve to reinforce gender inequal-
ities and power imbalances in Afghanistan. 
(c) POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES REGARD-
ING THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS OF AF-
GHANISTAN.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—It is the policy of the 
United States— 
(A) to continue to support the human 
rights of women and girls in Afghanistan fol-
lowing the withdrawal of the United States 
Armed Forces from Afghanistan, including 
through mechanisms to hold all parties pub-
licly accountable for violations of inter-
national humanitarian law and human rights 
violations against women and girls; 
(B) to strongly oppose any weakening of 
the rights of women and girls in Afghani-
stan; 
(C) to use the voice and influence of the 
United States at the United Nations to pro-
mote, respect, and uphold the human rights 
of the women and girls of Afghanistan, in-
cluding the right to safely work; 
(D) to identify individuals who violate the 
human rights of women and girls in Afghani-
stan, as those rights are defined by inter-
national human rights standards, such as by 
committing acts of murder, lynching, and 
grievous domestic violence against women, 
and to press for bringing those individuals to 
justice; 
(E) to systematically consult with Afghan 
women and girls on their needs and priorities 
in the development, implementation, and 
monitoring of humanitarian action, includ-
ing women and girls who are part of the Af-
ghan diaspora community; and 
(F) to ensure all humanitarian action is in-
formed by— 
(i) a gender analysis that identifies forms 
of inequality and oppression; and 
(ii) the collection, analysis, and use of data 
disaggregated by sex and age. 
(d) HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE AND AFGHAN 
WOMEN.—The Administrator of the United 
States Agency for International Develop-
ment should work to ensure that Afghan 
women are employed and enabled to work in 
the delivery of humanitarian assistance in 
Afghanistan, to the extent practicable. 
(e) REPORT
ON WOMEN
AND GIRLS

GHANISTAN.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days

participation of women and girls in Afghani-
stan. 
(C) An assessment of the prevalence of gen-
der-based violence in Afghanistan.

eign assistance obligated or expended during

women and girls in Afghanistan, including 
funds directed toward local organizations 
promoting the rights of women and girls. 
(2) ASSESSMENT.—

paragraph (1)(A) shall include the input of— 
(i) Afghan women and girls; 
(ii) organizations employing and working 
with Afghan women and girls; and 
(iii) humanitarian organizations providing 
assistance in Afghanistan. 
(B) SAFETY AND CONFIDENTIALITY.—In car-
rying out the assessment described in para-
graph (1)(A), the Secretary shall, to the max-
imum extent practicable, ensure the safety 
and confidentiality of personal information 
of each individual who provides information 
from within Afghanistan. 
(3) DEFINITION OF APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES 
OF CONGRESS.—In this subsection, the term 
‘‘appropriate 
committees 
of 
Congress’’ 
means— 
(A) the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
Senate; and 
(B) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and

Mr. REED and intended to be proposed 
to the bill H.R. 4350, to authorize ap-
propriations for fiscal year 2022 for 
military activities of the Department 
of Defense, for military construction, 
and for defense activities of the De-
partment of Energy, to prescribe mili-
tary personnel strengths for such fiscal 
year, and for other purposes; which was 
ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of title XII, add the following: 
Subtitle H—Otto Warmbier Countering North 
Korean Censorship and Surveillance Act of 
2021 
SEC. 1291. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Otto 
Warmbier Countering North Korean Censor-
ship and Surveillance Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 1292. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The information landscape in North 
Korea is the most repressive in the world, 
consistently ranking last or near-last in the 
annual World Press Freedom Index. 
(2) Under the brutal rule of Kim Jung Un, 
the country’s leader since 2012, the North Ko-
rean regime has tightened controls on access 
to information, as well as enacted harsh pun-
ishments for consumers of outside media, in-
cluding sentencing to time in a concentra-
tion camp and a maximum penalty of death. 
(3) Such repressive and unjust laws sur-
rounding information in North Korea re-
sulted in the death of 22-year-old United 
States citizen and university student Otto 
Warmbier, who had traveled to North Korea 
in December 2015 as part of a guided tour. 
(4) Otto Warmbier was unjustly arrested, 
sentenced to 15 years of hard labor, and se-
verely mistreated at the hands of North Ko-
rean officials. While in captivity, Otto 
Warmbier suffered a serious medical emer-
gency that placed him into a comatose state. 
Otto Warmbier was comatose upon his re-
lease in June 2017 and died 6 days later. 
(5) Despite increased penalties for posses-
sion and viewership of foreign media, the 
people of North Korean have increased their 
desire for foreign media content, according 
to a survey of 200 defectors concluding that 
90 percent had watched South Korean or 
other foreign media before defecting. 
(6) On March 23, 2021, in an annual resolu-
tion, the United Nations General Assembly 
condemned ‘‘the long-standing and ongoing 
systematic, widespread and gross violations 
of human rights in the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea’’ and expressed grave con-
cern at, among other things, ‘‘the denial of 
the right to freedom of thought, conscience, 
and religion . . . and of the rights to freedom 
of opinion, expression, and association, both 
online and offline, which is enforced through 
an absolute monopoly on information and 
total control over organized social life, and 
arbitrary and unlawful state surveillance 
that permeates the private lives of all citi-
zens’’. 
(7) In 2018, Typhoon Yutu caused extensive 
damage to 15 broadcast antennas used by the 
United States Agency for Global Media in 
Asia, resulting in reduced programming to 
North Korea. The United States Agency for 
Global Media has rebuilt 5 of the 15 antenna 
systems as of June 2021. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) in the event of a crisis situation, par-
ticularly where information pertaining to 
the crisis is being actively censored or a 
false narrative is being put forward, the 
United States should be able to quickly in-
crease its broadcasting capability to deliver 
fact-based information to audiences, includ-
ing those in North Korea; and 
(2) the United States International Broad-
casting Surge Capacity Fund is already au-
thorized under section 316 of the United 
States International Broadcasting Act of 
1994 (22 U.S.C. 6216), and expanded authority 
to transfer unobligated balances from ex-
pired accounts of the United States Agency 
for Global Media would enable the Agency to 
more nimbly respond to crises. 
SEC. 1293. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to provide the people of North Korea 
with access to a diverse range of fact-based 
information; 
(2) to develop and implement novel means 
of communication and information sharing 
that increase opportunities for audiences in 
North Korea to safely create, access, and 
share digital and non-digital news without 
fear of repressive censorship, surveillance, or 
penalties under law; and

in unclassified form, but may include the

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The People’s Republic of China is the 
world’s second largest economy and a major 
global lender. 
(2) In February 2021, the foreign exchange 
reserves of the People’s Republic of China to-
taled more than $3,200,000,000,000. 
(3) The World Bank classifies the People’s 
Republic of China as having an upper-mid-
dle-income economy. 
(4) On February 25, 2021, President Xi 
Jinping announced ‘‘complete victory’’ over 
extreme poverty in the People’s Republic of 
China. 
(5) The Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China utilizes state resources to create 
and promote the Asian Infrastructure Invest-
ment Bank, the New Development Bank, and 
the Belt and Road Initiative. 
(6) The People’s Republic of China is the 
world’s largest official creditor. 
(7) Through a multilateral development 
bank, countries are eligible to borrow until 
they can manage long-term development and 
access to capital markets without financial 
resources from the bank. 
(8) The World Bank reviews the graduation 
of a country from eligibility to borrow from 
the International Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development once the country reaches 
the graduation discussion income, which is 
equivalent to the gross national income. For 
fiscal year 2021, the graduation discussion in-
come is a gross national income per capita 
exceeding $7,065. 
(9) Many of the other multilateral develop-
ment banks, such as the Asian Development 
Bank, use the gross national income per cap-
ita benchmark used by the International 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
to trigger the graduation process. 
(10) The People’s Republic of China exceed-
ed the graduation discussion income thresh-
old in 2016.

Reconstruction and Development has ap-
proved projects totaling $8,930,000,000 to the 
People’s Republic of China. 
(12) Since 2016, the Asian Development 
Bank has continued to approve loans and 
technical assistance to the People’s Republic 
of China totaling $7,600,000,000. The Bank has 
also approved non-sovereign commitments in 
the People’s Republic of China totaling 
$1,800,000,000 since 2016. 
(13) The World Bank calculates the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China’s most recent year 
(2019) gross national income per capita as 
$10,390. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy 
of the United States to oppose any addi-
tional lending from the multilateral develop-
ment banks, including the International 
Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
and the Asian Development Bank, to the 
People’s Republic of China as a result of the 
People’s Republic of China’s successful grad-
uation from the eligibility requirements for 
assistance from those banks.

PUBLIC

committees’’ means—

signed valid authorizations designating the 
labor organization as their representative for 
such purposes and that no other individual

nized as the exclusive representative of any

ferred to in this clause as the ‘‘Service’’) of

ice is not able to bring the parties to agree-
ment by mediation and conciliation, the 
Service shall refer the dispute to a tripartite 
arbitration panel established in accordance 
with such regulations as may be prescribed 
by the Service. 
(bb) MEMBERS.—A tripartite arbitration 
panel established under this subclause with 
respect to a dispute shall be composed of 1 
member selected by the labor organization, 1 
member selected by the employer, and 1 neu-
tral member mutually agreed to by the labor 
organization and the employer. Each such 
member shall be selected not later than 14

cumstances or by agreement or permission of 
the parties) not later than 120 days after the 
establishment of such panel. Such a decision 
shall be binding upon the parties for a period 
of 2 years, unless amended during such pe-
riod by written consent of the parties. Such 
decision shall be based on— 
(AA) the financial status and prospects of 
the employer;

Subtitle H—Ukraine Security Partnership 
Act of 2021 
SEC. 1291. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Ukraine 
Security Partnership Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 1292. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Throughout its history, Ukraine has ex-
perienced several long periods of occupation. 
(2) Between 1919 and 1991, Ukraine was bru-
tally ruled by the Soviet Union, whose policy 
of agricultural collectivization caused the 
Holodomor of 1932–1933, a man-made famine 
that resulted in the death of at least 3,000,000 
Ukrainians by starvation. 
(3) During the Nazi occupation of Ukraine 
accompanying World War II— 
(A) approximately 3,500,000 Ukrainian civil-
ians and 3,000,000 soldiers were killed; and 
(B) approximately 1,500,000 Jews were mas-
sacred. 
(4) Ukraine declared its independence from 
Moscow in 1991, after the collapse of the So-
viet Union. 
(5) In the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, the 
Russian Federation, the United States, and 
the United Kingdom pledged to ‘‘respect the 
independence and sovereignty and the exist-
ing borders of Ukraine’’ and ‘‘refrain from 
the threat or use of force against the terri-
torial integrity or political independence of 
Ukraine’’ in exchange for Ukraine’s sur-
render of its nuclear arsenal. 
(6) From November 2004 through January 
2005, thousands of Ukrainians took to the 
streets to peacefully protest electoral fraud 
and widespread corruption by the ruling elite 
in the 2004 Presidential election, successfully 
triggering a re-vote, in what became known 
as the Orange Revolution. 
(7) During Ukraine’s 2014 Revolution of 
Dignity, or Euromaidan, the pro-Russian 
government of President Viktor Yanukovych 
was forced to resign after thousands of 
Ukrainians 
peacefully 
protested 
Yanukovych’s decision to reject a closer re-
lationship with the European Union and his 
continued systemic corruption, and over 100 
of those protestors were killed by violent 
government suppression. 
(8) Fearful of Ukraine’s strengthened pro- 
Western orientation after the Revolution of 
Dignity, the Government of the Russian Fed-
eration, in violation of international law and 
in contravention of its commitments in the 
Budapest Memorandum— 
(A) sent undisclosed military personnel 
into Ukraine’s Autonomous Republic of Cri-
mea in February 2014 and has illegally occu-
pied the Crimean Peninsula for the past 
seven years; 
(B) sent covert, unmarked military per-
sonnel into the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk 
and Luhansk in April 2014, instigating and 
supporting a still-ongoing conflict that has 
cost nearly 14,000 lives; and 
(C) provided the Buk missile system used 
by those Russia-led forces to shoot down Ma-
laysian Airlines Flight 17 over eastern 
Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 pas-
sengers and crew on board. 
(9) Under Russian control, Crimean au-
thorities have kidnapped, imprisoned, and 
tortured Crimean Tatars, opposition figures, 
activists, and other minority populations, 
and have persecuted religious minorities by 
pressing false charges of terrorism and 
deregistering religious centers. 
(10) In September 2014, in an attempt to 
stop the fighting that the Russian Federa-
tion 
had 
initiated 
in 
eastern 
Ukraine, 
France, Germany, Ukraine, the Russian Fed-
eration, the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation (OSCE), and Russia-led forces 
from eastern Ukraine signed the Minsk Pro-
tocol. 
(11) In February 2015, after the failure of 
the initial Minsk Protocol, the Russian Fed-
eration committed to the Minsk II Agree-
ment, the roadmap for resolving the conflict 
in eastern Ukraine, signed by the Govern-
ments of Ukraine, Russia, France, and Ger-
many. 
(12) Despite these agreements, the Govern-
ment of the Russian Federation continues to 
violate Ukrainian sovereignty through— 
(A) manipulation of Ukraine’s dependence 
on Russian natural gas, including cutting off 
access in 2014, which deprived Ukraine of its 
energy supply and transit fees; 
(B) espionage and clandestine assassina-
tions on Ukrainian territory;

November 15, 2021 
(C) continuous cyber warfare against the 
Government of Ukraine and Ukrainian busi-
nesses, such as the NotPetya hack in 2017; 
and 
(D) seizure of Ukrainian property and citi-
zens, including the November 2018 seizure in 
the Kerch Strait of three Ukrainian naval 
vessels and 24 Ukrainian officers on board 
those vessels. 
(13) In July 2018, Secretary of State Mi-
chael R. Pompeo issued the Crimea Declara-
tion and reiterated in February 2020 on the 
sixth anniversary of Russia’s illegal occupa-
tion that ‘‘Crimea is Ukraine’’. 
(14) On February 26, 2021 President Joseph 
R. Biden confirmed that Crimea is Ukraine 
and the United States does not and will 
never recognize Russia’s purported annex-
ation of the peninsula. 
(15) Since April 2014, at least 4,100 Ukrain-
ian soldiers have died fighting for their coun-
try against the Russian Federation and Rus-
sia-led forces, while no less than 3,361 civil-
ians have perished as a result of that fight-
ing. 
(16) Despite Ukraine’s tumultuous history 
and neighborhood, in under 30 years it has 
risen from the collapse of the Soviet Union 
to become a developing democracy, steadily 
working to overcome its Soviet legacy of op-
pression, oligarchic control, and corruption. 
(17) Running on a strong anti-corruption 
platform, Volodymyr Zelensky won the 2019 
presidential election with 73 percent of the 
vote, and his political party, Servant of the 
People, won a parliamentary majority in the 
Ukrainian parliament. 
(18) The OSCE confirmed the 2019 elections 
were ‘‘competitive and fundamental free-
doms were generally respected’’. 
(19) In March and April 2021, the Russian 
Federation amassed over 75,000 troops on its 
border with the Eastern Ukraine and in the 
occupied territory of Crimea. 
(20) Since 2014, the Government of Ukraine 
has made difficult and substantial reforms in 
an effort to address corruption and more 
closely align with the West, such as slim-
ming and decentralizing its bureaucracy, re-
moving 
immunity 
from 
prosecution 
for 
Members of Parliament, reforming its gas, 
pension, and procurement systems, and 
working to adapt its military to the stand-
ards of the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion (NATO). 
(21) Despite progress in reforming many 
areas 
of 
Ukrainian 
governance, 
serious 
issues still remain, particularly in the areas 
of corruption and rule of law. 
(22) The United States Government has 
consistently supported Ukraine’s democratic 
transition and its fight against Russia-led 
forces by assisting its governance reform ef-
forts, maintaining robust and coordinated 
sanctions against the Russian Federation 
alongside the European Union, and providing 
the Ukrainian military with training and 
equipment, including lethal defensive weap-
onry. 
(23) In addition to the United States, the 
European Union, European countries, and 
Canada have provided substantial diplo-
matic, monetary, and military support for 
Ukraine’s democratic transition and its fight 
against Russia-led forces in eastern Ukraine, 
and also have implemented and maintained 
robust sanctions regimes against the Rus-
sian Federation for its illegal occupation of 
Crimea and its active destabilization of 
Ukraine. 
(24) the Government of Ukraine has stead-
fastly supported the United States and Euro-
pean allies by deploying troops to Iraq, Af-
ghanistan, 
and 
NATO’s 
Kosovo 
Force 
(KFOR), allowing United States military 
planes to refuel on Ukrainian soil, and trad-
ing billions of dollars’ worth of goods and 
services with the United States. 
(25) NATO has recently decided to include 
Ukraine in its Enhanced Opportunities Part-
nership in recognition of Ukraine’s contribu-
tions to NATO missions and efforts to reform 
its military in line with NATO standards. 
(26) Since the Russian Federation’s 2014 in-
vasion of Ukraine, the United States Con-
gress has demonstrated its support for 
Ukraine through the passage of legislation, 
including the Support for the Sovereignty, 
Integrity, Democracy, and Economic Sta-
bility of Ukraine Act of 2014 (Public Law 113– 
95; 22 U.S.C. 8901 et seq.), the Ukraine Free-
dom Support Act (Public Law 113–272; 22 
U.S.C. 8921 et seq.), the Ukraine Security As-
sistance Initiative established under section 
1250 of the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114–92; 
129 Stat. 1068), the Countering America’s Ad-
versaries Through Sanctions Act (Public 
Law 115–44), and the Protecting Europe’s En-
ergy Security Act of 2019 (Public Law 116–92, 
title LXXV), and the United States Congress 
continues to demonstrate strong support for 
assisting Ukraine in defending itself and de-
terring Russia. 
SEC. 1293. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) Ukraine stands as a bulwark against 
the malign influence of the Russian Federa-
tion in Europe, and robust United States 
support for Ukraine is vital to United States 
national security and demonstrates the com-
mitment of the United States to upholding a 
free and open international order; 
(2) since Ukraine’s independence in 1991, 
the Government and people of Ukraine have 
made significant strides towards improved 
governance, rule of law, anti-corruption 
measures, and economic reforms; 
(3) Ukraine’s long-term viability is di-
rectly connected to its efforts to reduce cor-
ruption and build strong democratic institu-
tions that are able to defend against internal 
and external corrupt actors; 
(4) the efforts and sacrifices of Ukrainian 
citizens to determine their own fate after 
centuries of oppression, through democratic 
representation and governance reforms, is 
evidence of that country’s dedication to a 
free, independent, and democratic future; 
(5) Ukraine has proven itself to be a valu-
able security partner of the United States, 
not simply a recipient of assistance; 
(6) it is in the national security interests 
of the United States to continue and deepen 
its security partnership with Ukraine, in-
cluding through the provision of both lethal 
and non-lethal assistance; 
(7) the United States should continue to 
place policy-based conditions on Ukraine’s 
receipt of financial and military assistance, 
as that mechanism has proven effective in 
incentivizing reforms in Ukraine; 
(8) the United States should use its voice 
and vote at NATO to encourage the adoption 
of a policy by the Alliance that all of its 
member states will refuse to recognize the il-
legal attempted annexation of Crimea by the 
Russian Federation; 
(9) the United States should support at the 
highest level and take an active part in the 
Ukrainian ‘‘Crimean Platform’’ initiative to 
ensure that the international community’s 
attention remains focused on— 
(A) the unacceptable violation of Ukraine’s 
territorial integrity in Crimea; and 
(B) working towards the reversal of such 
violation; 
(10) the United States should continue to 
bolster the capacity of the Ukrainian Navy 
as it strives to fulfill the goals it set out in 
its ‘‘Strategy of the Naval Forces of the 
Armed Forces of Ukraine 2035’’; 
(11) the military-focused technical, train-
ing, maintenance, and logistical assistance 
provided by the United States to Ukraine is 
as essential as the military hardware pro-
vided to the country; 
(12) all security assistance provided to 
Ukraine should continue to be subject to rig-
orous vetting requirements under section 
620M of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 
U.S.C. 2378d) and security cooperation under 
section 362 of title 10, United States Code, in-
cluding assistance provided to units in the 
National Guard of Ukraine as well as all 
units falling under the authority of the Min-
istry of Defense; 
(13) the Office of Defense Cooperation at 
the United States Embassy in Ukraine 
should be fully staffed in order to administer 
the security assistance being provided to the 
country; 
(14) the United States should continue to 
support Ukraine’s NATO aspirations, includ-
ing through work towards a Membership Ac-
tion Plan; 
(15) the enduring partnership between the 
United States and Ukraine, including bipar-
tisan support for a sovereign, democratic, 
and whole Ukraine through political, mone-
tary, 
and 
military 
assistance, 
remains 
strong and must continue to be reaffirmed; 
and 
(16) the United States should continue to 
strongly support Ukraine’s ambitions to join 
the Euro-Atlantic community of democ-
racies. 
SEC. 1294. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to refuse to recognize the attempted an-
nexation of Crimea by the Russian Federa-
tion, an action that was taken in contraven-
tion of international law; 
(2) to utilize existing sanctions and other 
authorities to deter malign actions by the 
Russian Federation in or intended to harm 
Ukraine, including the mandates and au-
thorities codified by— 
(A) the Countering America’s Adversaries 
Through Sanctions Act (22 U.S.C. 9401 et 
seq.); and 
(B) the Protecting Europe’s Energy Secu-
rity Act of 2019 (title LXXV of Public Law 
116–92; 22 U.S.C. 9526 note); 
(3) to work with our European allies to co-
ordinate strategies to curtail Russian malign 
influence in Ukraine; 
(4) to work with our allies and partners to 
conduct more frequent multinational free-
dom of navigation operations in the Black 
Sea in order to demonstrate support for 
Ukraine’s internationally-recognized mari-
time boundaries, to safeguard the unimpeded 
traffic of lawful commerce, and to push back 
against excessive Russian Federation claims 
of sovereignty; 
(5) to work with our allies and partners to 
demonstrate support for Ukraine’s terri-
torial integrity, including its internation-
ally-recognized land borders; and 
(6) to support democratic, economic, and 
anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine and the 
country’s integration into Euro-Atlantic in-
stitutions.

required 
under subsection (a) shall include the fol-
lowing elements: 
(1) A clear plan, developed in close con-
sultation with the Ukrainian Ministry of De-
fense and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, for

(22 U.S.C. 2763) to support the further devel-

ance Initiative programming.

DEFENSE INDUSTRY FROM STRA-
TEGIC COMPETITORS.

strategic assets and companies in Ukraine’s 
aerospace and defense sector are not subject 
to foreign ownership, control, or undue influ-
ence by strategic competitors to the United 
States, such as the People’s Republic of

allies and partners. 
(B) An assessment of the vulnerabilities 
that strategic competitors of the United 
States exploit to acquire strategic assets in

Ukraine’s progress in addressing them, and 
United States initiatives to support these ef-
forts such as assistance in strengthening 
Ukraine’s investment screening and national

(2) NATO remains the strongest and most 
successful political-military alliance in the 
world, founded on a commitment by its

perity, and freedom of its members;

age economic collaboration between any or

18 years of security, humanitarian, and sta-
bilization operations in Afghanistan has 
been invaluable, and the sacrifices of NATO 
allies deserve the highest order of respect

hancing security relationships with non- 
NATO European partners to counter Russian 
aggression, including Russia’s use of hybrid 
warfare tactics and its willingness to use

(10) the European Deterrence Initiative, 
through investments to increase United 
States military presence, bolster exercises 
and training, enhance pre-positioning of

operable among NATO members; and

and partners to build permanent mechanisms 
to strengthen supply chains, enhance supply 
chain security, and fill supply chain gaps, in-
cluding in critical sectors such as defense, 
energy, and health;

saries; and 
(B) expand cooperation efforts on cyberse-
curity issues to prevent adversaries and 
criminals from compromising critical sys-

(13) øthe United States should¿ encourage 
the development of a new NATO strategic 
concept that addresses the threats to NATO 
that have emerged since NATO’s last stra-
tegic concept was published in 2010, includ-
ing— 
(A) a militarily resurgent Russia Federa-
tion, which is engaged in conflicts in Eastern

TO
END
THE 
COVID–19 PANDEMIC.—It shall be the policy 
of the United States to lead and implement 
a comprehensive and coordinated inter-
national response to end the COVID–19 pan-
demic in a manner that recognizes the crit-
ical role that multilateral and regional orga-
nizations can and should play in pandemic 
response, including by— 
(1) seeking adoption of a United Nations 
Security Council resolution that— 
(A) declares pandemics, including the 
COVID–19 pandemic, to be a threat to inter-
national peace and security; and 
(B) urges member states to address this 
threat by aligning their health preparedness 
plans with international best practices, in-
cluding those established by the Global 
Health Security Agenda, to improve country 
capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to 
infectious disease threats; 
(2) advancing efforts to reform the World 
Health Organization so that it serves as an 
effective, normative, and coordinating body 
that is capable of aligning member countries 
around a strategic operating plan to detect, 
contain, treat, and deter the further spread 
of COVID–19; 
(3) providing timely, appropriate levels of 
financial support to United Nations agencies 
responding to the COVID–19 pandemic; 
(4) prioritizing United States foreign as-
sistance for the COVID–19 response in the 
most vulnerable countries and regions; 
(5) encouraging other donor governments 
to similarly increase contributions to the 
United Nations agencies responding to the 
COVID–19 pandemic in the world’s poorest 
and most vulnerable countries; 
(6) working with key stakeholders to accel-
erate progress toward meeting and exceed-
ing, as practicable, global COVID–19 vaccina-
tion goals, whereby— 
(A) at least 40 percent of the population in 
all countries is vaccinated by the end of 2021; 
and 
(B) at least 70 percent of the population in 
all countries is vaccinated by the opening 
date of the 77th regular session of the United 
Nations General Assembly; 
(7) engaging with key overseas stake-
holders, including through multilateral fa-
cilities such as the COVID–19 Vaccines Glob-
al Access initiative (referred to in this sec-
tion as ‘‘COVAX’’) and the Access to COVID– 
19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator initiative, and 
expanding 
bilateral 
efforts, 
including 
through the International Development Fi-
nance Corporation, to accelerate the devel-
opment, manufacturing, production, and effi-
cient and equitable distribution of— 
(A) vaccines and related raw materials to 
meet or exceed the vaccination goals under 
paragraph (6); and 
(B) global health commodities, including 
supplies to combat COVID–19 and to help im-
mediately disrupt the transmission of SARS– 
CoV–2; 
(8) supporting global COVID–19 vaccine dis-
tribution strategies that strengthen under-
lying health systems and ensure that people 
living in vulnerable and marginalized com-
munities, including women, do not face 
undue barriers to vaccination; 
(9) working with key stakeholders, includ-
ing through the World Bank Group, the 
International Monetary Fund, the Inter-
national Finance Corporation, and other rel-
evant regional and bilateral financial insti-
tutions, to address the economic and finan-
cial implications of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
while taking into account the differentiated 
needs of disproportionately affected, vulner-
able, and marginalized populations; 
(10) entering into discussions with vaccine 
manufacturing companies to support part-
nerships, with the goal of ensuring adequate 
global supply of vaccines, which may include 
necessary components and raw materials; 
(11) establishing clear timelines, bench-
marks, and goals for COVID–19 response

tinues amidst operational challenges on the 
ground.

Technology Fund works to advance internet 
freedom in repressive environments by sup-
porting technologies that—

and 
(II) counter attempts by authoritarian gov-
ernments to control the internet and restrict 
freedom online. 
(ii) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Open Technology Fund 
should— 
(I) support a broad range of technologies to 
respond to increasingly aggressive and so-
phisticated 
censorship 
and 
surveillance 
threats and provide more comprehensive and 
tailored support to USAGM’s networks; and 
(II) provide direct assistance to USAGM’s 
networks to improve the digital security of 
reporting operations and journalists. 
(2) DEPARTMENT
OF
STATE
PUBLIC
DIPLO-
MACY PROGRAMS.— 
(A) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the fol-
lowing: 
(i) The Department of State’s public diplo-
macy programs build global networks that 
can address shared challenges, such as the 
COVID–19 pandemic, including through ex-
changes of researchers, public health ex-
perts, and scientists. 
(ii) The programs referred to in clause (i) 
play a critical role in creating open and re-
silient information environments where de-
mocracies can thrive, as articulated in the 
2020 Public Diplomacy Strategic Plan, in-
cluding by— 
(I) improving media quality with jour-
nalist training and reporting tours;

(I) many American citizens, including dual 
nationals; and 
(II) many visa applicants for educational 
and cultural exchange programs that pro-
mote United States foreign policy objectives 
and economic stability to small businesses, 
universities, and communities across the 
United States; 
(ii) a detailed plan for using existing au-
thorities to waive or provide other alter-
natives to in-person appointments and inter-
views;

thorities to rapidly cross-train and surge 
temporary personnel to support consular 
services at embassies and consulates of the 
United States around the world, and an as-
sessment of whether additional authorities 
and resources are required. 
(C) GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT CENTER.— 
(i) FINDING.—Congress finds that since the 
beginning of the COVID–19 pandemic, publi-
cations, websites, and platforms associated 
with China, Russia, and Iran have sponsored 
disinformation campaigns related to the 
COVID–19 pandemic, including falsely blam-
ing the United States for the disease. 
(ii) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Global Engagement Center 
should continue its efforts to expose and 
counter 
state 
and 
non-state-sponsored 
disinformation related to COVID–19, the ori-
gins of COVID–19, and COVID–19 vaccina-
tions. 
(i) FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS RE-
GARDING THE UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(A) The COVID–19 pandemic is causing a 
global economic recession, as evidenced by 
the global economic indicators described in 
subparagraphs (B) through (D). 
(B) The United Nations Conference on 
Trade and Development determined that the 
COVID–19 pandemic pushed the global econ-
omy into recession in 2020 on a scale that has 
not been witnessed since the 1930s. 
(C) Developed countries are expected to ex-
perience a relatively more significant re-
bound in gross domestic product growth dur-
ing 2021 than is expected to be experienced in 
developing countries, leading to concerns 
about a further expansion in the gap between 
rich and poor countries, particularly if this 
trend continues into 2022. 
(D) Global markets have suffered losses 
ranging between 5 percent and over 10 per-
cent since the beginning of the pandemic. 
While markets are recovering in 2021, global 
job losses and unemployment rates remain 
high, with— 
(i) approximately 33,000,000 labor hours lost 
globally (13 per cent of the total hours lost) 
due to outright unemployment; and 
(ii) an estimated additional 81,000,000 labor 
hours lost due to inactivity or underemploy-
ment. 
(E) Given the prolonged nature of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, African finance min-
isters have requested continued efforts to 
provide— 
(i) additional liquidity; 
(ii) better market access; 
(iii) more concessional resources; and 
(iv) an extension in the Debt Service Sus-
pension Initiative established by the Group 
of 20. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(A) even when markets begin to recover in 
the future, it is likely that access to capital 
will be especially challenging for developing 
countries, which still will be struggling with 
the containment of, and recovery from, the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
(B) economic uncertainty and the inability 
of individuals and households to generate in-
come are major drivers of political insta-
bility and social discord, which create condi-
tions for insecurity; 
(C) it is in the security and economic inter-
ests of the United States to assist in the eco-
nomic recovery of developing countries that 
are made more vulnerable and unstable from 
the public health and economic impacts of 
the COVID–19 pandemic; 
(D) United States foreign assistance and 
development 
finance 
institutions 
should 
seek to blunt the impacts of a COVID–19 re-
lated economic recession by supporting in-
vestments in sectors critical to maintaining 
economic stability and resilience in low and 
middle income countries; 
(E) the need for the United States Inter-
national Development Finance Corporation’s 
support for advancing development outcomes 
in less developed countries, as mandated by 
the Better Utilization of Investments Lead-
ing to Development Act of 2018 (22 U.S.C. 9601 
et seq.), is critical to ensuring lasting and re-
silient economic growth in light of the 
COVID–19 pandemic’s exacerbation of eco-
nomic hardships and challenges; 
(F) The United States International Devel-
opment Finance Corporation should adjust 
its view of risk versus return by taking 
smart risks that may produce a lower rate of 
financial return, but produce significant de-
velopment outcomes in responding to the 
economic effects of COVID–19; 
(G) to mitigate the economic impacts of 
the COVID–19 recession, the United States 
International Development Finance Corpora-
tion should use its resources and authorities, 
among other things— 
(i) to ensure loan support for small- and 
medium-sized enterprises; 
(ii) to offer local currency loans to bor-
rowers for working capital needs; 
(iii) to create dedicated financing opportu-
nities for new ‘‘customers’’ that are experi-
encing financial hardship due to the COVID– 
19 pandemic; and 
(iv) to work with other development fi-
nance institutions to create co-financing fa-
cilities to support customers experiencing 
hardship due to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
(j) SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING INTER-
NATIONAL COOPERATION TO PREVENT AND RE-
SPOND TO FUTURE PANDEMICS.—It is the sense 
of Congress that— 
(1) global pandemic preparedness and re-
sponse requires international and regional 
cooperation and action; 
(2) the United States should lead efforts in 
multilateral fora, such as the Group of 7, the 
Group of 20, and the United Nations, by col-
laborating and cooperating with other coun-
tries and international and regional organi-
zations, including the World Health Organi-
zation and other key stakeholders, to imple-
ment international strategies, tools, and 
agreements to better prevent, detect, and re-
spond to future infectious disease threats be-
fore they become pandemics; and 
(3) the United States should enhance and 
expand 
coordination 
and 
collaboration 
among the relevant Federal departments and 
agencies, the Food and Agriculture Organiza-
tion of the United Nations, the World Health 
Organization, and the World Organization for 
Animal Health, to advance a One Health ap-
proach toward preventing, detecting, and re-
sponding to zoonotic threats in the human- 
animal interface.

section (b), the Director has received no re-
sponse from the entity from which such in-
formation was requested, or received an in-
adequate response, the Director may issue to 
such entity a subpoena to compel disclosure 
of information the Director deems necessary 
to determine whether a covered cyber inci-
dent or ransom payment has occurred and 
obtain the information required to be re-
ported pursuant to section 2232 and any im-
plementing regulations. 
‘‘(2) CIVIL ACTION.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If an entity fails to com-
ply with a subpoena, the Director may refer

GENERAL.—Any subpoena issued 
electronically pursuant to this subsection 
shall be authenticated with a cryptographic 
digital signature of an authorized represent-
ative of the Agency, or other comparable 
successor technology, that allows the Agen-

MEASURE READ THE FIRST 
TIME—S. 3206 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I un-
derstand there is a bill at the desk, and 
I ask for its first reading. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the title of the bill for 
the first time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3206) to repeal provisions of the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that 
impose new information reporting require-
ments with respect to digital asset transfers. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I now 
ask for a second reading, and in order 
to place the bill on the calendar under 
the provisions of rule XIV, I object to 
my own request. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. The bill will be read for 
the second time on the next legislative 
day. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO PATRICK LEAHY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today a little sad but 
also immensely full of gratitude. Ear-
lier today, our dear colleague Senator 
PATRICK LEAHY announced that he will 
retire from the Senate at the conclu-
sion of his term. 
Now, this Chamber has had a long 
history of many a dedicated public 
servant, but there has only been one 
PATRICK LEAHY. For eight terms, the 
gentleman from Vermont has been a 
Senator’s Senator, one of only four in 
the history of the Senate to surpass 
16,000 votes in service to his beloved 
home State. 
Today, I can only say this: Thank 
you. Thank you, Pat, for your many 
years of friendship, leadership, and 
dedication to the Constitution and the 
rule of law. The Senate is better off be-
cause of you. Vermont is better off be-
cause of you. Our country is better off 
because of you. 
Now, we still may disagree strongly 
about which State has the best maple 
syrup, but we never let that get in the 
way of doing great things together. 
Pat, you are a great guy. It is bitter-
sweet. You deserve a wonderful retire-
ment with Marcelle and your beautiful 
children and grandchildren, but we are 
going to miss you dearly. I wish you 
and Marcelle the very best on the road 
ahead and the best of luck. Godspeed. 
f

NOVEMBER 16, 2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that when the Sen-
ate completes its business today, it ad-
journ until 10 a.m., Tuesday, November 
16; that following the prayer and 
pledge, the morning hour be deemed

approved to date, the time for the two 
leaders be reserved for their use later 
in the day, and morning business be 
closed; that upon the conclusion of 
morning business, the Senate proceed 
to executive session to resume consid-
eration

finally, that if any nominations are 
confirmed during Tuesday’s session, 
the motions to reconsider be consid-
ered made and laid upon the table and 
the President be immediately notified 
of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f

PROTECTING 
PRIVACY 
AND 
EN-
HANCING DIGITAL COMPETITION 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I wish to 
raise the need for congressional action in two 
areas that are critical for the privacy rights of 
Americans and the economic competitiveness 
of American companies and startups. We 
need a comprehensive privacy law to protect 
Americans in commercial contexts, and we 
need to reform surveillance laws relating to 
government collection of personal information. 
As a Representative of Silicon Valley, I’m 
proud of the countless innovations my con-
stituents have brought forward that improve 
the lives of billions of people, but I also recog-
nize that our country needs a comprehensive 
privacy law. In November 2019, Congress-
woman ZOE LOFGREN and I first introduced the 
Online Privacy Act to protect individuals, en-
courage innovation, and take a major step to-
wards restoring trust in technology. We are 
preparing to reintroduce this bill in the coming 
days. Our legislation creates privacy rights for 
users, places clear privacy obligations on 
companies, establishes a Digital Privacy 
Agency (DPA) to enforce privacy protections 
and investigate abuses, and strengthens en-
forcement by empowering state attorneys gen-
eral to enforce privacy violations and allowing 
individuals to appoint nonprofits to represent 
them in private class-action lawsuits. Impor-
tantly, the U.S. is the only industrialized coun-
try that lacks an agency focused on privacy 
law. Our legislation fixes that issue. 
We must also reconsider laws that authorize 
the Intelligence Community to collect and 
process personal information. Having served 
for nearly a decade on the House Permanent 
Select Committee on Intelligence, I have a 
deep regard for our national security needs. 
However, I also recognize how our needs 
have evolved and how authorizations Con-
gress enacted two decades ago have been 
abused. Specifically, we must limit the collec-
tion and retention of surveillance data under 
Executive Order 12333 regarding intelligence 
surveillance and Section 702 of the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). I’ve joined 
proposals to reform these laws in the past and 
I believe Congress must prioritize these 
issues, not only to protect privacy but also be-
cause they directly impact our economy. 
In 2015, the European Court of Justice 
(ECJ) struck down an agreement between the 
U.S. and EU known as Safe Harbor. In ex-
plaining its decision to invalidate the agree-
ment, the Court cited concerns with lack of ju-
dicial redress and EU citizens’ fundamental 
rights to privacy, codified in the EU Charter of 
Fundamental Rights. In response to the invali-
dation of this agreement, the U.S. and EU 
came to another data agreement known as 
Privacy Shield with stronger privacy protec-
tions. In July 2020 the ECJ struck down this 
agreement too, again due to the breadth of 
U.S. surveillance laws. Plainly put, the ECJ 
ruling highlights that EU citizens—and Ameri-
cans—cannot easily challenge the uses of 
their data by our Intelligence Community using 
our judicial system. The decision harms U.S. 
companies by creating uncertainty in the mar-
ket and restricting access to data that many 
small businesses, startups, and other compa-
nies rely on to remain competitive. 
I have joined efforts by Representatives 
LOFGREN and MASSIE to reform Section 702 of 
FISA to prohibit the warrantless search of on-
line communications and prohibit the federal 
government from pressuring companies to 
build encryption ‘‘backdoors,’’ and I intend to 
keep fighting for these needed reforms. 
I urge my colleagues to pass legislative re-
forms to surveillance laws that respect privacy 
and enable American economic competitive-
ness, while also respecting our national secu-
rity needs. We must devote our energies to 
achieving these objectives.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
MAJOR GENERAL PAT HAMILTON 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I’m honored to celebrate and recognize the 
extraordinary work of Major General Pat Ham-
ilton as he transitions into his richly-deserved 
retirement. His dedication to our beloved na-
tion and his community in Round Rock, Texas 
is the reflection of a true and devoted public 
servant. 
With his altruistic spirit and high-minded vi-
sion, MG Hamilton is a trusted leader and 
proud warrior. Throughout his military career, 
he brought his tremendous talents and com-
mitment to excellence to every challenge he 
encountered. His extraordinary work did not 
go unnoticed as he was awarded our nation’s 
highest honors, including the Legion of Merit 
and the Bronze Star Medal. His efforts have 
been critical in maintaining the U.S. military’s 
reputation as the world’s greatest fighting 
force. 
MG Hamilton’s commitment to investing his 
gifts, talents, and abilities to improve his com-
munity is a deeply held creed that speaks to 
the generosity and activism of a true and de-
voted public servant. His resume tells the 
story of a man unafraid to contribute both his 
time and energies to a multitude of organiza-
tions that rely on volunteerism and social en-
gagement to make good communities great. 
His commitment to public service represents 
the best values of Central Texas. 
Retirement is meant to be celebrated and 
enjoyed. It is not the end of a career, but the 
beginning of a new adventure. It is my honor 
to recognize the selfless service of Major Gen-
eral Pat Hamilton as he starts this new chap-
ter of his life. On behalf of Central Texas, I 
thank him for his superb work and wish him 
the very best.

SUPPORTING THE U.S. FLAGGED 
FLEET 
HON. JERRY L. CARL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the U.S. flagged merchant fleet and 
the men and women of the US merchant ma-
rine who work every day to support our mili-
tary and our nation. We are now seeing first-
hand how important maritime transportation is 
to our supply chain and the health of our 
economy. 
Our U.S. flagged fleet responds when called 
upon to aid in disasters and emergencies, 
moves critical government and military cargo 
around the world, and carries essential hu-
manitarian aid to help people in need across 
the globe. 
Madam Speaker, programs like the Maritime 
Security Program and the Tanker Security 
Program enjoy bipartisan support in Congress 
because they help ensure we retain both a 
strong commercial maritime capability that en-
hances our national security and a critical mili-
tary capability should we need it in times of 
conflict. We must do all we can to strengthen 
our fleet and support our mariners.

HONORING MICHAEL CHANDLER 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, the Com-
monwealth of Virginia mourns the loss of Offi-
cer Michael Chandler of the Big Stone Gap 
Police Department. Officer Chandler was killed 
in the line of duty on November 13, 2021, at 
the age of 29. Though he was taken too soon, 
he lived a selfless life of service and commit-
ment to the rigorous calling of law enforce-
ment. 
Officer Chandler was a native of Big Stone 
Gap. As a student at Powell Valley High 
School, he played football and scored the last 
touchdown in the school’s history before it 
subsequently merged into Union High School. 
He graduated in 2011 and began service in 
2015 with the Big Stone Gap Fire Department. 
In 2019, Officer Chandler joined the Big Stone 
Gap Police Department. He was a distin-
guished public servant who put his life on the 
line every day as he courageously served, 
protected, and defended those around him. 
While on duty on his 29th birthday, he gave 
the ultimate sacrifice. Officer Chandler was 
shot while performing a wellness check in 
Wise County. He was initially transported to 
Norton Community Hospital before being flown

to Johnson City Medical Center, where he 
passed away. 
Officer Chandler was a loving father, hus-
band, son, brother, and friend. He was pre-
ceded in death by his father, Michael Wayne 
Chandler, and his grandparents. He is sur-
vived by his wife, Natasha Chandler; his 
daughter, Kamryn Elizabeth Chandler; his 
mother, Rebecca Ann Tipton, and her hus-
band Eddie; his brothers, Chris Chandler, 
David Chandler, and his wife Kisha, and Tyler 
Chandler; his sister, Amanda Herron, and her 
husband Troy; numerous nieces and neph-
ews, and a host of other close relatives and 
friends. 
The death of Officer Chandler is a grievous 
loss to the Commonwealth of Virginia, Wise 
County, and the Town of Big Stone Gap. I 
mourn his loss, yet I am grateful that he and 
the other men and women of law enforcement 
step forward to protect us knowing full well the 
risks they face. His bravery and selfless serv-
ice will not be forgotten.

RECOGNIZING MR. PARVIZ 
KAMANGAR 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mr. Parviz Kamangar for his 
dedication and service to the Central Valley. 
Mr. Kamangar was instrumental in the fund-
ing and development of the Boys and Girls 
Club in Huron, an organization which was ab-
sent from the community until the involvement 
of Mr. Kamangar and his associates. 
Aside from being pivotal in the development 
of the Boys and Girls Club, Mr. Kamangar has 
also provided scholarships to local students 
for years. Since 2013, he has helped provide 
147 different scholarships to students. 
Mr. Kamangar has been vital in providing 
much needed assistance throughout the com-
munity. He was an intricate part of the devel-
opment of a new Animal Control Shelter in the 
City of Huron. 
Recently, Mr. Kamangar generously do-
nated to the Huron Community Enhancement 
Foundation, a local nonprofit organization, to 
assist in keeping the foundation operational. 
Mr. Kamangar also donated to the Huron Po-
lice Officers assigned to U.S. COPS anti-crime 
outreach program to allow for interactions with 
Huron youth. 
Whether it be through his dedication to com-
munity 
service 
or 
his 
philanthropy, 
Mr. 
Kamangar is a vital member of the community 
within the 21st congressional district. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the incredible work done by 
Mr. Parviz Kamangar.

REMEMBERING ROB WARREN 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize and celebrate the life and works of 
my dear friend Robert Lorenz ‘‘Rob’’ Warren 
of Castro Valley, CA, gone far too soon. 
Rob was born the youngest of five sons to 
Annette Garin Warren and Richard Stafford 
‘‘Dick’’ Warren. Both sides of his family have 
called the East Bay home since the 19th Cen-
tury; Garin Regional Park, established on his 
mother’s family ranch, was the site of many a 
gathering as Rob grew up. Grandfather E. 
Guy Warren with his wife, Adair, had founded 
the family’s ranch in Castro Valley’s beautiful 
Cull Canyon, where Rob and his brothers 
maintained ranches and together ran a cattle 
company. 
Rob attended Hayward’s All Saints Elemen-
tary School and Moreau High School, and 
then the University of California, Davis and the 
U.C. Hastings College of the Law. At age 16, 
he was selected into the House of Represent-
atives Page Program—an experience that led 
Rob to what would be his two lifelong loves, 
his wife and his devotion to public service. It 
was via fellow pages in 1994 at the Pendleton 
Rodeo that he met the one and only love of 
his life, Colleen O’Brien. They were married 
four years later sharing a passion for San 
Francisco, hosting big parties, travel, a tre-
mendously close circle of friends, and raising 
children in a country environment. Together 
they built a home in Cull Canyon and were 
blessed with Julia and Max—the lights of their 
lives. The four laughed, cooked, skied and 
went on wonderful adventures together. 
Rob was an Alameda County Assistant Dis-
trict Attorney, serving as advisor to the Civil 
Grand Jury for much of his career. His good- 
natured, easy-going, and hard-working person-
ality was perfect for the job. His colleagues 
were central to his life. 
Rob lived his belief in civic engagement, 
selflessly serving on the Boards of the Rowell 
Ranch Rodeo, Alameda County 100 Club, 
Eden Hospital Medical Foundation and All 
Saints Masterplan. Rob was an Eagle Scout, 
served on the Alameda County Democratic 
Central Committee and was a Past President 
of the Hayward Area Historical Society. In 
2017 he was awarded the Lifetime Achieve-
ment Award in the Law from Moreau High 
School. 
As we grieve Rob’s loss, I’ve come to real-
ize that one of his legacies will be all the peo-
ple he connected. These seemingly countless 
‘‘Friends of Rob’’ will be ever grateful that he 
brought together so many of us and bright-
ened our lives. 
Rob Warren was the ultimate family man, 
loyal, smart, witty and a best friend to ever so 
many. Brittany and I are terribly sad that our 
new son, Hank Warren Swalwell, will never 
meet and learn from Rob, who left us the 
same day Hank arrived. But in time we will re-
alize our lives will have more integrity, loyalty, 
and laughter because we knew Rob, for he 
changed us all for the better. Rest in peace, 
my dear friend.

HOMETOWN HERO—BRUCE STACY 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Bruce Stacy of Colleyville, 
TX who served in the U.S. Army and received 
two silver stars in Vietnam. 
Over the weekend, I had the honor of 
awarding Bruce the 2021 Congressional Vet-
eran Commendation. We honor Bruce for his 
courage and sacrifice in 1969, where he sus-
tained serious wounds as he cleared many 
soldiers from an immediate area of assault by 
the enemy. He was later awarded two Purple 
Hearts after this conflict. 
Bruce has always put others first and con-
tinues to make a lasting impact on the lives 
around him. It is an honor to recognize the 
distinguished veterans of TX 24, like Bruce, 
and to preserve their stories for future genera-
tions of Americans through the Congressional 
Veteran Commendation. I thank Bruce for his 
service and the sacrifices he made to protect 
our great nation.

REAFFIRMING 
COMMITMENT 
TO 
HUMAN 
RIGHTS 
AND 
DEMOC-
RACY IN CUBA 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to provide context on my present 
vote on November 3rd for H. Res. 760. While 
I echo many of the sentiments in the resolu-
tion 
and 
appreciate 
Rep. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ, Rep. SIRES, and Rep. DIAZ-BALART 
efforts to draw attention to the rights of the 
Cuban people to protest their government and 
to condemn the Cuban government for its re-
pressive actions, I share the concerns of my 
colleagues that the resolution would perpet-
uate the isolation of Cuba that the Obama ad-
ministration worked to reverse. I stand firmly 
behind the people of Cuba as they fight for 
their rights, which is why I did not vote against 
the bill. 
However, I believe that such a statement on 
U.S.-Cuba policy should also affirm a policy of 
engagement and reject the use of sanctions— 
like those applied by the Trump administra-
tion—that hurt the Cuban people and do noth-
ing to support their democratic aspirations. 
Furthermore, I was disappointed that this reso-
lution was brought to the floor under suspen-
sion of the rules and did not go through a 
markup on the House Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, preventing the opportunity to include 
language that underscores our commitment to 
finding real solutions to the current impasse in 
U.S.-Cuba policy. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
on a clear path forward that upholds human 
rights and democratic values while paving a 
way for practical engagement.

OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, it has been 
over a year since the end of the 2020 44-day 
war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. This 
short, but furious and deadly, conflict stemmed 
from historical differences regarding geo-
graphic territory based on ethnicity and reli-
gion. I do not pretend to know the details of 
this conflict. The seeds for this conflict were

sown decades ago, perhaps even a century 
ago, with the advent of the Soviet Union as 
well as the decline of the Ottoman Empire. 
Here is what I do know. The Armenians and 
the Azerbaijanis deserve to live and prosper in 
peace. Nations require territorial integrity. I am 
hopeful for the future that these two nations, 
both with a proud and great history, will be 
able to resume their relationship in peace and 
that the parties work, in good faith, to resolve 
their issues without bullets. 
God bless the people there and through His 
will it is my hope peace will prevail.

HONORING JOHN LEEPER 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of John Leeper of Dublin, Virginia, who 
passed away on October 2, 2021, at the age 
of 59. Mr. Leeper served his local community 
as a Police Officer with the Pulaski Police De-
partment for over 29 years. 
Mr. Leeper was born on December 25, 
1961, in Washington, DC, to Walter Marue 
Leeper and Minnie Lamon Leeper. Before be-
ginning his career with the police department, 
he served his country in the 82nd Airborne Di-
vision of the United States Army. He recently 
retired after spending a career selflessly serv-
ing others. In his 29 years with the Pulaski Po-
lice Department, Mr. Leeper was a well-re-
nowned leader on the force and in the com-
munity. He never met a stranger and wel-
comed all with a smile. 
Colleagues and community members re-
member Mr. Leeper for his kindness and dedi-
cation to the safety and security of his com-
munity. He trained numerous other officers 
and many colleagues looked upon him as a 
mentor. His hard work and service will not be 
forgotten. 
Mr. Leeper was preceded in death by his 
mother, Minnie Lamon Leeper. He is survived 
by his wife, Rebecca Mills Leeper; his son, 
Austin Leeper and his fiance´e, McKayla Huff; 
his step-daughters, Hunter Riddle and Laura 
Reece; and his father, Walter M. Leeper. I 
would like to offer my condolences to them 
and the people of Pulaski County on the loss 
of this dedicated public servant.

RECOGNIZING MR. JOHN C. HARRIS 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mr. John C. Harris for his dedi-
cation and service to the Central Valley. 
Mr. Harris and his family’s commitment to 
agriculture spans the past century. Harris 
Farms has grown into one of the largest agri-
culture businesses in the nation. Harris Ranch 
Inn & Restaurant provides some of the highest 
quality beef in the United States, and they 
maintain an emphasis on hiring Coalinga- 
Huron Unified School District students. 
Mr. Harris was instrumental in the funding 
and development of the Boys and Girls Club 
in Huron, an organization which was absent 
from the community until the involvement of 
Mr. Harris and his associates. 
Aside from being pivotal in the development 
of the Boys and Girls club, Mr. Harris has also 
provided scholarships to local students for 
years. Since 2013, he has helped provide 147 
different scholarships to students. 
Mr. Harris has been vital in providing much 
needed assistance throughout the community. 
Recently, he was an intricate part of the devel-
opment of a new Animal Control Shelter in the 
City of Huron. 
Whether it be through his dedication to com-
munity service, his philanthropy, or providing 
jobs to local students to help develop career 
skills, Mr. Harris is a vital member of the com-
munity within the 21st Congressional District. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the incredible work done by 
Mr. John C. Harris.

HONORING THE LIFE OF FRANK D. 
HARGROVE, SR. 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
deep sadness but great respect that I take this 
time to remember Frank D. Hargrove, Sr., who 
passed away on October 16, 2021, at the age 
of 94. After serving in WWII in the Army Air 
Corps, Frank started his political career in the 
Virginia House of Delegates in 1981. He went 
on to serve for 28 years, which is the longest 
tenure of any state legislator in Hanover 
County’s history. 
Frank was an adventurous young man, he 
learned to fly planes as a teenager and, en-
listed in the Army Air Corps after graduating 
high school. After his service, he attended Vir-
ginia Tech where he often reminisced about 
his adventures with his airplane over his stud-
ies. Upon graduating, he joined his father’s in-
surance business. He was a brilliant business-
man; he assembled a team, and together they 
built up A.W. Hargrove Insurance Agency. He 
grew what started as a small family business 
into one of the largest independent insurance 
agencies in Virginia before selling it in 1997. 
When Frank married Oriana Robertson, she 
took credit for channeling his energy to pro-
ductive ends. This same energy led Frank to 
teach himself to sail, pick-up long-distance 
biking and running, and be well known for his 
flying stories. In 1960, he and a group of 
friends promoted building the Hanover County 
Airport, which was eventually named after him 
in recognition of his work. 
In 1981, Frank was elected to the Virginia 
House of Delegates where he loved making 
the government work for his constituents and 
believed their trust had to be earned every 
day. He represented his constituents by serv-
ing in leadership on different committees, one 
being the Vice-Chairman of the Commerce 
and Labor Committee. One of his proudest ac-
complishments was serving as the legislative 
member on the Board of Trustees of the Vir-
ginia War Memorial, where he was instru-
mental in securing funding to restore the Me-
morial Shrine and Building and to create the 
education center and programs. He spent his 
off time supporting charitable organizations 
and was especially proud of his work on the 
governing bodies of Ferrum College and Ran-
dolph-Macon College. Frank aligned his phi-
losophy closely with that of Thomas Jeffer-
son’s maxim ‘‘the government that governs 
best, governs least’’. Although his constituents 
did not always agree with his stances, they 
continued to elect him until he retired. 
Frank’s life was filled with patriotism and 
public service. He will be missed for his direct 
manner, vice grip handshake, and storytelling. 
He is survived by his children and their 
spouses, Dale Alderman (Richard Alderman), 
Frank Jr. (Elizabeth), Stewart (Lynn), and 
Wellesley (Kim), and grandchildren Oriana 
(Douglas Fletcher), Stewart (Dana), Sarah, 
Mark (Amber), Frank III, Madeleine, Mollie, 
Hannah, Graeme, and Bailey, and one great- 
grandchild, Stewart. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me and 
countless others as we recognize the many 
contributions of Frank D. Hargrove, Sr.

HOMETOWN HERO—MERREL 
FRANKLIN (FRANK) ADAMS, JR. 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Merrel Franklin (Frank) 
Adams, Jr. of Southlake, TX who served in the 
U.S. Marine Corp and USMC Reserves during 
his 20 years of service. 
Over the weekend, I had the honor of 
awarding Frank the 2021 Congressional Vet-
eran Commendation. Frank courageously flew 
during the Vietnam War and served seven 
months with the infantry as a Forward Air 
Controller, Air Liaison Officer and Battalion 
Operations Officer. 
Among many of Frank’s accomplishments 
during his service, he was awarded the Distin-
guished Flying Cross while flying the A4 
Skyhawk, which saved American troops who 
were trapped by enemy fire, the Bronze Star 
Medal with Valor for repelling enemy attack 
and causing many enemy casualties and 6 Air 
Medals for missions over North Vietnam, 
South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. Frank 
also received the Purple Heart for injuries he 
received when he was shot down by enemy 
ground fire. When he ejected, he had to out-
run and fire upon the enemy until he was res-
cued by a helicopter. 
It is an honor to recognize the distinguished 
veterans of TX 24 and to preserve their stories 
for future generations of Americans through 
the Congressional Veteran Commendation. I 
thank Frank for his service and the sacrifices 
he made to protect our great nation.

HONORING THE 100TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF PEP BOYS 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 
100th anniversary of a Philadelphia-founded 
institution: Pep Boys Auto Service and Tires. 
It was one hundred years ago that a group of 
Navy buddies with a passion for cars set out 
to make a living and, in the process, helped to 
invent the modern automotive aftermarket 
parts and service industry. 
As the industry and consumer preferences 
have changed, so too has Pep Boys. First pro-
viding just car parts, then parts and repairs, 
and now making the shift to providing primarily 
automotive service for a growing population of 
American vehicles and fast-growing fleets. 
To ensure there will be enough skilled tech-
nicians to keep our communities moving, Pep 
Boys also created a scholarship program for 
aspiring technicians, invested in training and, 
in a nod to its founders, pledged its loyalty 
and support to veterans causes. 
Today, Pep Boys has nearly 1,000 locations 
across the country and is now once again 
looking to the future, investing in the ability to 
service electric vehicles. Pep Boys is com-
mitted to serving its customers and commu-
nities into the next century with its promise: 
We go further to help you go farther. 
As the chair of the Auto Care Caucus and 
the representative for Philadelphia, I would like 
to recognize Pep Boys today before the 
United States House of Representatives.

THANKING MR. CALVIN WARE FOR 
HIS SERVICE TO THE HOUSE 
HON. ANTHONY G. BROWN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam Speaker, 
on his retirement in September 2021, we rise 
today to thank Mr. Calvin Ware for his over 22 
years of outstanding service to the United 
States House of Representatives as a mem-
ber of the Logistics and Support Team. 
Calvin began his career in 1990 working at 
the Smithsonian Institution, in the house-
keeping department. He left to pursue other 
job opportunities, until he secured a job on 
Capitol Hill. Calvin first began working as a 
temporary employee with the Logistics Depart-
ment in the Labor Room for about two years. 
He left for a brief period to work at Home 
Depot, then received a phone call from 
George Simler, a former Manager, who im-
plored him to apply for a full-time opening in 
the Logistics Department. He was immediately 
hired, thus began his 22-year career with the 
Office of the Chief Administrative Officer 
(CAO). 
While he started in the Labor Room, Calvin 
was soon asked to work in the Rayburn Pent-
house, where cages were stored with excess 
furniture, a position which required a level of 
responsibility and dependability. He moved 
around the organization, working for the Office 
Supply Store, reporting to John Hodges, Man-
ager and Tom Coyne, Director. 
Calvin proved himself to be a reliable em-
ployee, and as such, was tasked to work in 
the Logistics equipment room for several 
years, providing check-out access to Audio/ 
Visual equipment, and the use of the govern-
ment fleet of vehicles. It was in this position 
that he had a lot of access to Members and 
their staff. When this function was reassigned, 
Calvin moved over to become a Receiving 
and 
Warehousing 
Specialist 
tasked 
with 
checking on excess furniture in the hallways of 
the Congressional Buildings. Ironically, he is 
again reporting to his former Director, Tom 
Coyne, now the Chief Logistics Officer for Lo-
gistics & Support (L&S). It is in this position 
that Calvin will retire his career. 
Calvin remembers back to the first CAO, 
Jay Eagen, who used to meet with the Logis-
tics staff on a variety of issues. Jay developed 
a program for extended schooling for staff to 
complete their High School level education 
and to receive a diploma. While Calvin had 
previously attended Anacostia High School, he 
never completed his schooling. Through this 
opportunity, Calvin was able to complete and 
receive his diploma, and even considered 
going on to higher education, but instead 
elected to go to work full-time. 
Calvin remembers fondly, his favorite boss, 
Freddie Bowles, Manager, Logistics, who re-
tired a few years back. He credits Freddie with 
mentoring him and showing him the ropes. 
Some other bosses who also had a great im-
pact on him were Bobby Small, Manager, 
Allen King, Supervisor, and Kevin Chambers, 
former Supervisor. He built many fond memo-
ries with this staff and credits them with en-
hancing his enjoyment of his government job. 
One such memory that stands out is the 
time Mohamad Ali was scheduled to visit Cap-
itol Hill. The entire campus was abuzz with ex-
citement, and word was out that he was in the 
Cannon Caucus Room. He missed his first op-
portunity to see the legend but received a 
phone call later that day that he would be in 
the Capitol. When Calvin arrived for a shot of 
the fighter, there were mobs of people sur-
rounding him. While on standby, he started 
talking to a coworker, who arranged for him to 
meet in a Member’s office later that day, 
where he was able to meet the king in person 
had a special picture taken with Mohammed 
Ali and his daughter, Layla, who also became 
a boxer in her own right. He later met the fa-
mous singer, Glen Campbell, and ran into 
countless other singers and celebrities he 
could rarely get close to. 
In reflecting over his long career, Calvin re-
calls just where he was on 9/11. Since he had 
a late arrival to work, he was home and did 
not have the news on. When he finally turned 
on the news, he saw the President talking 
about the unfolding tragedy. Unsure of his 
next move, Calvin decided to try and make it 
into work, but when he drew nearer to the 
Capitol complex, he saw the black smoke 
emanating from the Pentagon, and imme-
diately turned around and returned home. Dur-
ing the Anthrax scare, Calvin and his team 
went to the undisclosed location and were 
tasked with building cubicles for the Members 
and their staff. Each Member had to have a 
full PC/monitor set up and Calvin was instru-
mental in unpacking and delivering these 
items and other supplies, ensuring the Legisla-
tive work of the House could successfully con-
tinue. During the earthquake of 10 years ago, 
Calvin was on Capitol Hill. Once he saw the 
room sway, he began to evacuate the building 
remembers the former Chief, Jerry Bennet, 
standing in the hallways until everyone was 
evacuated. 
Calvin is a well-known lover of all types of 
music, and possesses a fine singing voice 
himself, honed by singing in the church choir. 
As a former football player, basketball player, 
and boxer, most people remember him as an 
ardent Washington Football Team fan. Calvin 
often came to work wearing remnants of the 
Washington gear and credits his love for foot-
ball to his Dad, who used to play semi-Pro 
football, and engaged his young son into the 
sport. In retirement, Calvin would like to spend 
more time with his family, three sisters, and 
many children he helped to raise. 
On behalf of the entire House community, 
we extend congratulations to Calvin Ware for 
his many years of dedication and outstanding 
contributions to the U.S. House of Represent-
atives. We wish him many wonderful years in 
retirement and in pursuit of future endeavors.

HONORING THE HEROIC LIFE AND 
SERVICE OF ROBERT G. MITCHELL 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the heroic life of Navy veteran 
and former Saratoga County Veterans Service 
Agency Director, Bob Mitchell. 
Bob Mitchell was born in 1936 in Saratoga 
Springs and graduated from Al Penney Police 
Academy. At the age of 17, Bob enlisted in 
the Navy in the midst of the Korean War. Bob 
was initially assigned to serve as a Signalman 
with Air Transport Squadron Five (VR–5) and 
played an important role in the occupation of 
Europe. Later in his career, Bob was assigned 
to the USS Gainard, the ship famously known 
for its participation in the Cuban Missile Crisis 
and its help with the Project Mercury space 
missions. 
Bob finished up his twenty years of military 
service at the Navy Recruiting Station in Buf-
falo, New York. During his tenure in the Navy, 
Bob spent over five years in foreign or sea 
service and retired in 1973 with the rank of 
Petty Officer First Class. For his courageous 
service, Bob was awarded the National De-
fense Service Medal, Navy Good Conduct 
Medal (6th award), and the Navy Occupational 
Service Medal with ‘‘E’’ Clasp. 
After his retirement, Bob continued to dedi-
cate his life to serving his country and commu-
nity. He held positions with numerous commu-
nity institutions and organizations, including 
the Saratoga Springs Police Department and 
the Saratoga County Sheriff Department. 
Eventually, Bob became the Director of the 
Saratoga County Veteran Service Agency. His 
tremendous work in this role created life

changing opportunities for the veterans he 
served. Bob organized numerous initiatives to 
support veterans and oversaw the creation of 
the Honor Deceased Veteran program. He 
was a true veteran’s veteran. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st district, I am 
honored to recognize the extraordinary life of 
Bob Mitchell, and his brave and selfless serv-
ice to his country and fellow veterans. It is my 
hope that his fearless spirit and bravery will be 
carried on by those who knew and loved him.

HOMETOWN HERO—RICHARD G. 
STEWART, JR. 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Richard G. Stewart, Jr. of 
Irving, TX who served in the U.S. Navy. Over 
the weekend, I had the honor of awarding 
Richard the 2021 Congressional Veteran 
Commendation. 
Throughout his outstanding 24-year military 
service record, Richard was awarded the Le-
gion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal 
with Gold Star, the Navy Commendation 
Medal, and the Vietnam Service Medal with 
Bronze Star, among many others. Richard re-
tired from the Navy in 1994 and went on to 
serve his community in various more ways. 
It is an honor to recognize the distinguished 
veterans of TX 24 and to preserve their stories 
for future generations of Americans through 
the Congressional Veteran Commendation. I 
thank Richard for his service and the sac-
rifices he made to protect our great nation.

IN RECOGNITION OF PARACHUTE 
RIGGER 
PETTY 
OFFICER 
2ND 
CLASS 
REBA 
ALEXANDER 
MONCUS 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor an extraordinary trailblazer, 
sailor, World War II veteran, and dedicated 
civil servant, Parachute Rigger Petty Officer 
2nd Class (P/R 2) Reba Alexander Moncus, 
who was honored at Veterans Day Program 
for the American Legion Post 30 on November 
11, 2021, at 8 a.m. 
Reba Alexander Moncus was born Novem-
ber 30, 1921, in Berrien County, Georgia, to 
the union of the late Mr. J.H. and Mrs. Lodia 
Alexander. As a family of sharecroppers dur-
ing the Great Depression, the Alexanders 
often moved around, and with money being 
scarce, the only food they purchased was the 
food they could not grow on their own. Be-
cause her family could not afford to buy 
schoolbooks for her studies, Reba had to drop 
out of school in the third grade. It was not until 
Ed Rivers became Governor of Georgia, that 
the state began furnishing free schoolbooks, 
and Reba was able to return to her studies. 
She attended six different schools in a three- 
county area, before graduating from high 
school at the age of 21. After high school, she 
went to Thomaston, Georgia where she 
worked for Thomaston Mills, and after some 
time there, she realized that a life of drudgery 
working in a cotton mill was not the life she 
wanted to live. 
On March 10, 1943, Reba answered the call 
to serve her nation and enlisted in the newly 
formed U.S. NAVY WAVES (Women Ap-
pointed for Volunteer Emergency Services), 
the women’s branch of the U.S. Navy, and 
was the first woman to be recruited from the 
Albany, Georgia area. Upon enlisting, she 
started basic training at Hunter College in New 
York along with 10,000 other women on July 
15, 1943. After Basic she was assigned to the 
Recreation Department onboard Naval Air Sta-
tion Anacostia, in Washington, D.C. Reba was 
adamant about wanting to serve her country in 
every capacity and wanting to contribute to the 
World War II efforts, and after battling with the 
Navy Bureau of Personnel for four months, 
she finally convinced them that she was capa-
ble of serving on the front lines. On January 
1, 1944, Reba was assigned to Naval Air Sta-
tion Lakehurst, New Jersey for training as a 
parachute rigger. On April l, 1944, upon com-
pletion of her training, she was sent to Naval 
Air Station (NAS) Melbourne, Florida, where 
new Naval Aviators were taught tactics, gun-
nery, and general flight prior to shipment over-
seas. During her tenure at NAS Melbourne, 
she was also able to participate in the drop 
test flights but, as one of two female riggers, 
she was not allowed to test jump chutes, as 
they were reserved only for the male riggers. 
Reba spent the most fulfilling days of her life, 
interrupted by moments of pure horror at Mel-
bourne, as her duties included inspecting and 
repacking unused military parachutes and sal-
vaging the hardware from burned parachutes, 
which included smelling the horrible stench of 
human flesh mixed with burnt aviation gas, oil, 
and everything involved with an airplane 
crash. She was later reassigned to NAS Opa 
Locka in November of 1944 and was released 
from active duty on November 24, 1945. 
Following her military service, she continued 
to serve her community and make an impact 
in the lives of others. Her contributions include 
serving her fellow Veterans as a member of 
the American Legion Post 30 in Albany, Geor-
gia and serving on the Honor Guard Burial 
Detail for more than two decades. Moreover, 
she urged her fellow vets and first responders 
suffering from the effects of Posttraumatic 
Stress Disorder to seek help. 
Douglas Adams once said that ‘‘To give real 
service you must add something which cannot 
be bought or measured with money, and that 
is sincerity and integrity.’’ P/R 2 Reba Alex-
ander Moncus has demonstrated through her 
career and life, outstanding achievement, 
service, and public distinction. Our community, 
our state, and our nation are better because of 
her. 
Reba accomplished much in her life, but 
none of it would have been possible without 
the Grace of God and the love and support of 
her family including her late husband, Albert 
Holton Harrell; and her children, and her 
grandchildren. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along 
with the more than 730,000 residents of the 
Second Congressional District in honoring and 
commending Parachute Rigger Petty Officer 
2nd Class (P/R 2) Reba Alexander Moncus for 
her outstanding service to her nation, commu-
nity, and humankind. 
FURTHER RECOGNIZING CHINESE- 
AMERICAN WORLD WAR II VET-
ERANS FROM PENNSYLVANIA 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, on No-
vember 5th, I proudly recognized dozens of 
Chinese-American Veterans from the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania who served gal-
lantly in our United States military during 
World War II. 
Today, I rise once again to further acknowl-
edge additional service members who com-
mitted themselves to defending our national 
ideals and values in the gravest hours of that 
war.

Harvey C. Young, George W. Jung, Leong Q. 
Yee, Poy Quon Fong, Jan Lim, William Lee 
Sr., Mun H. Wong, Yook Been Eng, Frank 
Wong Leung. 
In 2018, Congress passed and the Presi-
dent signed into law S. 1050—The Chinese- 
American World War II Veteran Congressional 
Gold Medal Act, which authorized the Con-
gressional Gold Medal to be awarded to these 
individuals in recognition for both their service 
to our Nation during a time at war and to our 
Nation’s Chinese American community. Not 
only did they help in defeating our Nation’s en-
emies, but they overcame the many chal-
lenges they and their families had due to the 
existence of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 
1882. As a matter of fact, 40 percent, of the 
Chinese who served were not even citizens of 
the United States at the time. It was not that 
they did not want to become citizens, but that 
they were denied that right under the Chinese 
Exclusion Act of 1882. However, due to their 
service and sacrifices for our Nation during 
WWII, Congress finally repealed this unjust 
law in 1943. This laid the groundwork for 
many of our Veterans to return home after the 
war and to attain the opportunities that they 
rightfully earned in their military service to our 
Nation. 
I would again respectfully like our Congress 
today to show our appreciation and gratitude 
to these great Americans. We will always re-
member and treasure their personal sacrifices 
and contributions to our Nation.

AZERBAIJAN’S 
TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, on November 
10th the world saw the conflict in Nagorno- 
Karabakh come to an end, and with it, the 
rightful restoration of Azerbaijan’s territorial in-
tegrity. 
As many Azerbaijani citizens know all too 
well, last year’s war was not an isolated inci-
dent. After a ceasefire agreement ending the 
First Nagorno-Karabakh War in May of 1994, 
in which Armenia took approximately l4 per-
cent of Azerbaijan’s internationally recognized

territory, tensions between the two countries 
remained unresolved, and for good reason— 
the illegal seizure of these territories was in di-
rect violation of no less than four United Na-
tions Security Council Resolutions passed the 
year before (UNSCRs 822, 853, 874, and 
884). 
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, 
the United States and Azerbaijan have main-
tained robust ties and a strong strategic part-
nership. Our Nation was one of the first coun-
tries to recognize Azerbaijani independence in 
the early 1990s, and since then, we have 
worked together with the Azerbaijani govern-
ment to protect and promote European energy 
security, increase trade and investment, and 
combat terrorism and other transnational 
threats. 
Azerbaijan has proven time and again to be 
steadfast partners, with her servicemen proud-
ly serving shoulder-to-shoulder with U.S. 
Forces in Kosovo and Iraq. Azerbaijan began 
its peacekeeping presence in Afghanistan in 
2002 and was one of the last foreign countries 
to withdraw its troops. In support of the U.S. 
mission, Azerbaijan allowed about 40 percent 
of all cargo destined for NATO personnel in 
Afghanistan to pass through their country. 
One year following the end of the Nagorno- 
Karabakh conflict, I extend my best wishes to 
the people of Azerbaijan following the fortifica-
tion of their nation’s territorial integrity, and 
urge both Armenia and Azerbaijan to sign a 
definitive and final peace agreement. Peace 
between Armenia and Azerbaijan will boost bi-
lateral relations between the two countries and 
ensure increased regional cooperation.

HONORING DR. JAMES D. ECKERT 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Madam Speaker, 
Dr. James Eckert is one of many fellow Ameri-
cans born stateside but whose path took him 
to Puerto Rico, where he raised his family and 
devoted himself to the development of edu-
cation. His leadership in the military and edu-
cational fields touched many in our dear Is-
land. Born on October 2, 1932, in New York 
City, New York, he attended the University of 
Southern California where he received his 
bachelor’s degree. After graduation, he en-
listed in the United States Marine Corps, re-
ceiving a Commission as a Marine Corps Offi-
cer in 1960. His recent passing is a deeply felt 
loss to his family but also to the many people 
in Puerto Rico that were touched by him. 
During his military career, he served in the 
Republic of South Korea and South Vietnam. 
He also served at sea aboard the USS Boxer, 
a 27,100-ton Essex-class aircraft carrier that in 
the late 1950’s was transferred to the Atlantic 
Fleet as an ‘‘interim amphibious assault ship’’ 
and mainly operated in the Caribbean area 
with the Tenth Provisional Marine Brigade on 
board. While the USS Boxer was in Puerto 
Rico, Marine Officer James Eckert met his fu-
ture wife Mrs. Carmen ‘‘Tata’’ Eckert from the 
town of Fajardo. Their relationship blossomed 
and was blessed by the arrival of 3 children 
who grew to become professional in their own 
right; Attorney Heydsha Colon, Mr. James D. 
Eckert and Mr. Larry E. Eckert who enriched 
the family with a bouquet of 5 grandchildren. 
After 25 years of service and with the rank 
of Major, James D. Eckert retired from the 
United States Marine Corps with the satisfac-
tion of having served our nation with great 
honor. During his military career Major Eck-
ert’s valor and leadership was recognized by 
various decorations, medals, badges and com-
mendations. Upon retirement Major Eckert es-
tablished his family in Puerto Rico where he 
pursued and obtained Master and Doctoral 
Degrees in Education and worked in different 
leadership positions ranging from High School 
to University level. 
The Marine Corps motto of ‘‘Semper 
Fidelis’’ or Always Faithfull accompanied him 
through his life after retirement, where his 
sense of duty manifested in his voluntary serv-
ice in various military and civic organizations. 
He served as President of the Puerto Rico 
chapters of the Military Order of the World 
Wars and the Reserve Officers Association 
and was an active member of the Marine 
Corps Association, the Navy League of the 
United States. Respected as a leader, family 
man, father, grandfather and restless advocate 
of Puerto Rico’s veteran and military commu-
nity, he always demonstrated his patriotism, 
bravery, and courage. Without a doubt Major 
James D. Eckert is an example and inspiration 
to follow by all.

HOMETOWN HERO—EDWARD 
REYES 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
Edward 
Reyes 
of 
Carrollton, TX who served in the U.S. Army 
and served as an infantryman in Vietnam. 
Last weekend, I had the honor of awarding 
Edward the 2021 Congressional Veteran Com-
mendation. We honor him for his courage and 
bravery when entering the Army in June 1969 
and being honorably discharged in May 1971. 
Since then, Edward has made a great im-
pact on his community by serving as the 
President of Vietnam Veterans of America 
Dallas Chapter, working in law enforcement, 
serving on the Executive Board of Directors of 
the American Legion Post 453, and serving in 
various other organizations. 
Edward has always put others first and con-
tinues to make a lasting impact on the lives 
around him. It is an honor to recognize the 
distinguished veterans of TX 24, like Edward, 
and to preserve their stories for future genera-
tions of Americans through the Congressional 
Veteran Commendation. I thank Edward for 
his service and the sacrifices he made to pro-
tect our great nation.

HONORING 
MICHAEL 
HULSIZER 
FOR 
HIS 
SERVICE 
TO 
KERN 
COUNTY 
AND 
THE 
STATE 
OF 
CALIFORNIA 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Michael Hulsizer, a constituent, 
friend, educator, and dedicated public servant. 
Throughout his illustrious career, Michael has 
been a tireless advocate for students through-
out Kern County and influential in shaping the 
policies that impact our children, teachers, and 
our families. After dedicating nearly 45 years 
of service to Kern County, Michael will be re-
tiring from his position of Chief Deputy for 
Governmental Affairs for the Kern County Su-
perintendent of Schools next month. 
Michael began his career in education as a 
teacher at Desert High School, located in 
Eastern Kern County and part of the Muroc 
Joint Unified School District. While at Desert 
High, he served as teacher sponsor of the 
school’s Mock Trial team, eventually helping to 
lead the 1982–83 team to win the California 
State Mock Trial Championship. His leader-
ship at Desert High and passion for providing 
students with the best possible academic and 
extracurricular opportunities led him to the 
Kern County Superintendent of Schools’ Cur-
riculum and Accountability Division, as a His-
tory and Social Science Consultant, in 1985. 
In this role, Michael helped to implement the 
highly regarded ‘‘We The People: The Citizen 
and the Constitution’’ annual competition, dur-
ing which teams of high school students 
throughout Kern County put their knowledge of 
the U.S. Constitution to the test, and devel-
oped the Kern County History Day program, 
which continues to be a highly popular event 
among Kern County students of all ages. 
In the early 1990s, Michael played a leader-
ship role, on behalf of the Kern County Super-
intendent of Schools, in the creation of the 
Kern County Network for Children, a collabo-
rative network of community-based organiza-
tions and stakeholders that aims to support 
Kern County’s most vulnerable students. Near-
ly 30 years later, the Kern County Network for 
Children continues to serve families and at- 
risk youth through its collaborative model and 
system of family resource centers, thanks 
largely to Michael’s leadership. In 2005, Mi-
chael brought his passion for Kern County stu-
dents and civics education to our nation’s cap-
ital by participating in the third annual Con-
gressional Conference on Civic Education, 
hosted by the joint leadership of the United 
States Congress. 
During his tenure as Chief Deputy for Gov-
ernmental Affairs for the Kern County Super-
intendent of Schools, Michael had a hand in 
crafting education policy at the state and local 
levels and served as the primary liaison on 
federal education issues. He was particularly 
instrumental in the adoption and implementa-
tion of the Local Control Funding Formula in 
the State of California, and most recently 
helped to guide Kern County schools through 
the throes of the COVID–19 pandemic by en-
suring that they received the federal and state 
relief funds necessary to continue to educate 
students throughout Kern County. 
I have had the privilege of working with Mi-
chael on issues facing students in our commu-
nity since my time in the California State As-
sembly and have consistently sought out his 
opinion and guidance over the years. Michael 
is respected by elected officials, educators, 
and students alike for his deep knowledge of 
education policy, and has left an indelible im-
pact in our schools, community, and the State 
of California. While he will no longer be with 
the Kern County Superintendent of Schools, I 
have no doubt he will continue to champion 
causes important to him and our students. On

CONGRATULATING ARKANSAS’ NA-
TIVE SON—CRAIG BLAIR—ON HIS 
RETIREMENT FROM THE FOREST 
SECTOR 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the successful career and 
retirement of Arkansas’ native son and or-
dained Minister, Craig Blair. Throughout his al-
most 40-year career, Mr. Blair has set himself 
apart as an example to his community and his 
peers in the forestry sector. 
Born in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and the son 
of an Arkansas school principal and a school 
librarian, Craig pursued a career in forestry, 
graduating with a Bachelor of Science Degree 
in Forest Management from the University of 
Arkansas at Monticello and a Masters in For-
estry Degree in Forest Business from Mis-
sissippi State University, where he was also 
the College of Forest Resources 2018 Alumni 
Fellow. Over his 39-year career, Craig held a 
variety of positions in the forestry sector, cul-
minating in his appointment as President and 
CEO 
at 
Resource 
Management 
Service 
(RMS)—a firm that manages timber assets in 
my district—and in the forest products sector. 
During his more than 10-year tenure as the 
firm’s leader, Craig oversaw a skilled and ex-
perienced team of forestry and investment 
professionals who built and managed port-
folios of forest assets that were collectively 
valued at more than $4 billion and that in-
cluded investments in the United States, Aus-
tralia, Brazil, China, and New Zealand. Craig 
became Chairman of the RMS Board of Man-
agers on October 1, 2021. 
Among his many accomplishments as Presi-
dent and CEO of RMS, Craig led the firm’s ef-
forts to promote diversity and inclusion within 
the forestry profession, developed the first 
open ended forest investment fund, and cham-
pioned collaborative approaches to landscape 
and species conservation, helping to establish 
Conservation without Conflict. Craig has also 
been actively engaged in numerous forestry 
organizations, serving as Chair on the boards 
of the National Alliance of Forest Owners, the 
World Forestry Center, and the Sustainable 
Forestry Initiative, Inc., where he received the 
2017 SFI President’s Award. 
The husband of Rita Blair for more than 34 
years and father of two sons—Braden and 
Paul—I take this time today to celebrate Craig 
Blair. I am proud to call him my forestry col-
league and my friend. May we always look at 
his work ethic and his dedication to his family, 
the forestry sector, and his church as an ex-
ample to emulate. 
IN RECOGNITION OF LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL ALEXANDER JEFFERSON 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
tribute to Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Jeffer-
son, one of the most decorated pilots in Michi-
gan, whose heroic service as a Tuskegee Air-
man in World War II is being recognized in a 
rededication ceremony for Jefferson Field, 
named in his honor in Detroit, Michigan. 
Born in Detroit, Michigan on the 15th of No-
vember 1921, Lieutenant Colonel Jefferson 
grew up flying model airplanes in the same 
field that is now named for him. He graduated 
from Detroit’s Chadsey High School in Detroit 
and earned a Bachelor of Science Degree 
from Clark College in Atlanta, Georgia. He did 
graduate work in Chemistry at Howard Univer-
sity and earned a Master of Science in Edu-
cation from Wayne State University in Detroit. 
Following three months of combat training in 
Selfridge Field, Michigan, Lieutenant Colonel 
Jefferson graduated from a pilot training 
course at the Tuskegee Army Airfield. He 
served as a P–51 fighter pilot with the Red 
Tail, 332nd Fighter Group 301st Fighter 
Squadron in Ramitelli, Italy. Over the course 
of 18 long range escort missions deep into 
enemy territory, he bravely provided protection 
from vicious enemy aircraft. His unit escorted 
bombers headfirst into the action. They never 
lost a single plane. 
On August 12, 1944, three days before the 
invasion of Southern France, Lieutenant Colo-
nel Jefferson was shot down while firing at 
German radar stations on the coast. He was 
captured by the Germans and kept as a pris-
oner of war for nine months, ninety miles from 
Berlin. There, he witnessed firsthand the 
atrocities committed by the Nazis. He was lib-
erated by the American forces on the 29th of 
April 1945 and was discharged from active 
duty in 1947. He retired from the reserves in 
1969 with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. 
After the end of the war, Lieutenant Colonel 
Jefferson 
became 
an 
elementary 
school 
science teacher in Detroit, where he would re-
tire as an assistant principal in 1979. A mem-
ber of various church, educational, and alumni 
organizations, as well as one of the founders 
of the Detroit Chapter of the Tuskegee Air-
men. He is a member of the Tuskegee Airman 
Speaker Bureau, a life member of the Silver 
Falcon Association, and has served as an Ad-
missions Counselor for the U.S. Air Force 
Academy. 
He has received numerous awards and ac-
colades for his bravery and his selfless service 
for our country, including a Purple Heart 
Medal, an Air Medal, a POW medal, an Air 
Force Achievement Medal, and many, many 
more. On October 14, 1995, Lieutenant Colo-
nel Jefferson was inducted into the Michigan 
Aviation Hall of Fame. 
Pleae join me in recognition of Lieutenant 
Colonel Alexander Jefferson on this celebra-
tion of his lifelong service to our country. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF 
COLUMBIA 
BRIDGES 
HOME 
RULE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Bridges Home 
Rule Act. This bill would repeal a redundant 
1997 federal law that makes it a crime for a 
person in the District of Columbia to obstruct 
any bridge connecting D.C. and Virginia. The 
District already had, and continues to have, its 
own local law prohibiting obstructing a bridge 
in the District. There is no federal law that pro-
hibits a person in Virginia from obstructing 
such a bridge or a person in any state from 
obstructing a bridge connecting two states, 
and, fortunately, D.C. does not need a federal 
law to keep our bridges clear either. 
This law is as offensive as it is redundant. 
It harks back to a time when a private group 
in D.C. attempted to block the 14th Street 
Bridge into Virginia, although there is no evi-
dence that D.C. authorities failed to act. The 
District’s local criminal law prohibiting obstruct-
ing a bridge takes care of any obstruction oc-
curring here. 
Under the 1997 federal law, ‘‘whoever in the 
District of Columbia knowingly and willfully ob-
structs any bridge connecting the District of 
Columbia and the Commonwealth of Virginia 
. . . shall be fined not less than $1,000 and 
not more than $5,000, and in addition may be 
imprisoned not more than 30 days. . . .’’ 
Under D.C. law, a person may be subject to 
imprisonment and/or fines for ‘‘crowd[ing], 
obstruct[ing], or incommod[ing] . . . [t]he use 
of any street, avenue, alley, road, highway, or 
sidewalk.’’ 
The courts have long held that D.C. may re-
peal federal laws that predate the Home Rule 
Act of 1973 (HRA) and apply exclusively in or 
to the District, but have not ruled on whether 
D.C. may repeal post-HRA federal laws that 
apply exclusively in or to the District. My bill 
would avoid any court challenge the District 
could face if it tries to repeal this 1997 federal 
law. 
This bill is an important step in increasing 
home rule for the District, and I urge my col-
leagues to support it.

HONORING THE OTIS EDWARD 
MOORE HIGHWAY IN WILLARD, MO 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the life and legacy of Otis Edward 
Moore, a lifelong resident of Everton, MO. 
Mr. Moore served in the U.S. Navy during 
WWII and was a maintenance worker for Mid- 
America Dairymen in Springfield after his serv-
ice had ended. Beyond his work, Moore was 
actively involved with his community, joining 
Masonic Lodge No. 87 AF&AM in Greenfield. 
His family knew him as a loving husband, fa-
ther, and grandfather. 
Moore’s life was tragically cut short when he 
was killed in a car accident on Highway 160 
in Willard. He was 61 at the time he passed 
away in 1983. Now, nearly 40 years later, a 
stretch of Highway 160, from West Bypass to 
County Road 115, has been named in honor 
of Moore. The new Otis E Moore Memorial 
Highway will be dedicated on Monday, No-
vember 22nd of this year. 
Madam Speaker, Otis Moore exhibited a life 
of service. Service to his nation and service to 
his community. It is only fitting that a portion 
of Highway 160 be named in his memory.

HONORING THE DEDICATED SERV-
ICE AND RETIREMENT OF MIR-

HON. VICKY HARTZLER

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Miriam Flores, a dedi-
cated public servant from Missouri’s Fourth 
Congressional District. 
After 14 years of service with the Missouri 
Veterans Commission, Miriam will officially re-
tire on November 30, 2021. During her time 
with the Missouri Veterans Commission, Mir-
iam has been the first person with whom vet-
erans and their family members see whenever 
they come to the Commission offices. While 
her role has officially been the Senior Office 
Support Assistant located in the St. Robert of-
fice, everyone knew Miriam went well beyond 
her role to impact people’s lives in meaningful 
ways. She was the friendly smile and compas-
sionate voice to veterans seeking assistance 
and the support for many Veteran Service Of-
ficers, always looking for ways to make their 
jobs easier and more efficient to serve those 
who served. During her tenure, she was the 
main administrative contact person for the 
southwestern and the new central region of 
Missouri. 
After her retirement, Miriam is looking for-
ward to spending more time with her children 
and grandchildren. Please join me in congratu-
lating Miriam Flores for her dedicated service 
to Missouri’s veterans and their families.

CONGRATULATING MUNSEY MEMO-
RIAL 
UNITED 
METHODIST 
CHURCH ON 150 YEARS OF SHAR-
ING CHRIST’S LOVE 
HON. DIANA HARSHBARGER 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 15, 2021 
Mrs. HARSHBARGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Munsey Memorial United 
Methodist Church in Johnson City in the First 
Congressional District of Tennessee as they 
celebrate 150 years of sharing the love of 
Christ in their community and throughout the 
world. Built of handmade bricks at a cost of 
four thousand dollars in 1871, Munsey, known 
then as East Market Street Methodist Church, 
was part of the heritage of the early Methodist 
circuit riders that brought the gospel to the 
pioneer settlements of the American Frontier. 
Just three decades later, the church had out-
grown that initial structure and relocated to 
their present address on the corner of Roan 
and Market Streets and, in 1908, renamed the 
church in memory of their brilliant, self-taught 
pulpit preacher, Reverend William E. Munsey. 
Their new, modern facility attracted many 
new congregants, so many, in fact, that the 
church doubled in size in just three years. 
Growth and expansion continued with the ad-
dition of an indoor swimming pool in 1949 and 
the establishment of a preschool program in 
1950. While the pool closed due to structural 
issues in 2001, the preschool continues to 
provide a safe and nurturing learning environ-
ment for two-, three- and four-year-old children 
and is the oldest state accredited preschool 
program in Tennessee, 
As the sharing of the good news of Christ 
continued so did the growth of the church, ne-
cessitating the building of a new sanctuary in 
1955. Munsey continued to be a beacon of 
God’s love over the next several years. This 
display of love was never more evident than 
on Christmas Eve 1989 when a terrible fire at 
the John Sevier Center, a low-income residen-
tial high-rise across the street from the church, 
claimed the lives of sixteen residents. Services 
were cancelled as the church became a triage 
center for those escaping the horror and a lo-
cation for families to be reunited. Members 
spent the evening bringing food, blankets, and 
comfort to victims and first responders. Fol-
lowing that fire, a new ministry, The Melting 
Pot, was born which grew from providing a 
Saturday morning breakfast for those resi-
dents to working cooperatively with Good Sa-
maritan Ministries to provide breakfast every 
morning and lunch five days a week. Now, 
that same Melting Pot offers the Open Door 
worship service as an outreach to downtown. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in congratulating Munsey Memorial 
United Methodist Church as they celebrate 
150 years of ministering to the needs of their 
community, region, and world. They represent 
the strong faith of the First Congressional Dis-
trict of Tennessee, and I am proud to rep-
resent them and wish them great success in 
the next 150 years.
