Let us pray. 
Eternal Father, our souls long for 
You, for we find strength and wisdom 
in Your presence. Guide our lawmakers 
to put their trust in You, seeking in 
every undertaking to know and do 
Your will. When they go through dif-

faith that will trust You even when the 
darkness is blacker than a thousand 
midnights.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4004 
August 4, 2022 
Guard yesterday as they distributed 
food and water to displaced residents. 
Many of the roads in Eastern Ken-
tucky are still impassable, so the Ken-
tucky National Guard is flying dozens 
of helicopter missions daily to drop 
water, MREs, and vital supplies to 
Kentuckians in remote areas of our 
State. My State director was on board 
as they flew over flooded roadways and 
homes to visit the community centers 
operating as supply hubs in areas iso-
lated by rising water. The landings are 
difficult, sometimes nearly impossible, 
but the heroes of the Kentucky Na-
tional Guard will do whatever it takes 
to reach those stranded by the floods. 
And that is just one part of the flurry 
of activity. Emergency responders have 
deployed boats and trucks across the 
affected region. In Buckhorn, residents 
are even loading up horses to take sup-
plies to areas where the roads are lit-
erally washed out. It is truly, truly he-
roic work. 
This emergency is far from over, but 
when their neighbors are in need, Ken-
tuckians will always help other Ken-
tuckians. I will visit the region myself 
soon to survey the damage and help 
with relief efforts. While here in Wash-
ington, I remain in close contact with 
those who are out on the ground. 
I am grateful to everyone for taking 
on the colossal task of providing for 
Kentucky amid this disaster. 
REMEMBERING JACKIE WALORSKI, EMMA 
THOMSON, AND ZACHERY POTTS 
Mr. President, now on another sad 
note, yesterday, Congress was shaken 
by the news that a tragic automobile 
accident had killed Congresswoman 
Jackie Walorski and three others, in-
cluding Emma Thomson and Zachery 
Potts, members of her staff. 
Our former colleague here in the Cap-
itol was back home among her fellow 
Hoosiers in Indiana’s Second District, 
in circumstances that are familiar to 
each of us: long days on the road with 
trusted aides, meeting with the people 
we represent. 
By 
all 
accounts, 
Congresswoman 
Walorski had two stellar young people 
by her side. 
At 27, Zach was already a 7-year vet-
eran of her team, having served as both 
campaign manager and district direc-
tor. 
Emma, her 28-year-old communica-
tions director, was already a Capitol 
Hill veteran, whose ‘‘intelligence’’ and 
‘‘drive,’’ one former boss described as 
‘‘second-to-none.’’ 
The last day’s outpourings of grief 
and admiration demonstrate just how 
great a hole Jackie Walorski is leaving 
behind among her friends here in the 
Capitol. They marveled at both her tre-
mendous personal kindness and her 
fierce advocacy for the families she 
represented. 
I had the personal pleasure of break-
ing 
bread 
with 
Congresswoman 
Walorski several years ago and looked 
forward to every time that our paths 
would actually cross. 
According to those who knew Jackie 
best, her infectious passion and bound-
less energy for service were rooted in 
the faith that guided her entire life. 
That faith also led her and her beloved 
husband Dean to found a charity and to 
spend years living and serving needy 
people in Romania. 
Today, we trust that this faith has 
reunited our colleague with her eternal 
Father, and we pray that He will com-
fort Dean, all her family and friends, 
and those who mourn Zach and Emma, 
in these terrible days. 
S.J. RES. 55 
Mr. President, later today, the Sen-
ate will vote on a resolution to peel 
back a significant layer of regulatory 
redtape that has been causing head-
aches all across our country. 
Thanks to the leadership of the jun-
ior Senator from Alaska, this resolu-
tion would overturn a Biden adminis-
tration action that aims to give the 
Federal Government even more author-
ity to slow and stall critical infrastruc-
ture projects. 
For years, our Republican govern-
ment made headway in rolling back 
some of the countless roadblocks lib-
eral bureaucrats have put in the path 
of new highways, bridges, and pipe-
lines. We took big bites out of the 
bloated permitting process, and, just 
last year, Republicans ensured that bi-
partisan infrastructure legislation in-
cluded clear limits designed to speed 
up Federal permitting reviews. 
But earlier this year, the President 
fired off a far-left Executive action 
that directly contradicted some of that 
bipartisan headway. Catering to rad-
ical environmentalists, the new Biden 
rule reinstates sweeping jurisdiction 
for Federal bureaucrats to slow down 
all sorts of critical infrastructure. This 
Democratic action is taking a process 
that is already known for years-long 
waiting periods and multihundred-page 
Federal reports and actually making it 
worse. 
Every single Senate Republican is 
proud to cosponsor Senator SULLIVAN’s 
resolution. The future of our infra-
structure needs at least one Democrat 
to see the light as well. 
INFLATION 
Mr. President, now on one final mat-
ter, a year and a half ago, every Senate 
Democrat cast the deciding vote for a 
$1.9 trillion disaster that caused the 
worst inflation in 40 years. 
Democrats 
have 
crushed 
working 
families with runaway prices. More 
than 80 percent of the country says our 
economy is in bad shape. President 
Biden’s approval on the economy is 
down to 30 percent and falling. By the 
traditional rule of thumb, our country 
is now in a recession, and a super-
majority of Americans are aware of it. 
American families are crying out for 
relief, but Democrats have decided to 
spend hundreds of billions of dollars of 
the people’s money on a bill that 
laughs at the people’s priorities. 
Americans say their No. 1 concern is 
inflation and the cost of living. So here 
is what the Democrats’ taxing-and- 
spending spree would accomplish on 
that issue: It would make inflation 
worse over the next few years and then 
do nothing to cut inflation in the long 
term. 
Even the Democrats’ favorite esti-
mates say that their bill would take 9 
years—9 years—to subtract the amount 
of inflation we have been adding every 
single week. 
I will say that again. Even the Demo-
crats’ favorite estimates say their bill 
would take 9 years—9—to subtract the 
amount of inflation we have been add-
ing every single week. 
After inflation, in particular, another 
huge group of Americans say that their 
biggest issue is the overall state of the 
economy in general, and here is what 
Democrats want to accomplish on that 
subject. They want to ram through 
giant new tax hikes in the middle of 
the recession—new multihundred-bil-
lion-dollar tax hikes on American jobs 
that specifically target the manufac-
turing sector, leaving Americans with 
fewer jobs and lower wages; new tax 
hikes on American natural gas and 
crude oil, higher fees for producing en-
ergy on Federal land—leaving Ameri-
cans with higher electric bills, higher 
utility bills, higher gas prices, and 
more dependence on foreign countries 
that don’t like us. 
In a time of inflation, Democrats also 
want to spend $80 billion to roughly 
double the size of the IRS so they can 
shake more money out of the American 
people through harassment and au-
dits—using taxpayer money to make 
taxpayers’ lives worse. 
So what do Democrats want to do 
with all the money they want to drain 
out of Americans’ pockets in the midst 
of this recession? They want to lavish 
hundreds of billions of dollars on an 
issue that exactly 3 percent of the 
country says is our biggest problem: 
far-left 
environmental 
and 
climate 
spending. 
American families have been hem-
orrhaging financially for a year and a 
half. Working people can barely tread 
water. And the Democrats’ focus is 
Green New Deal nonsense that only 3 
percent 
of 
the 
country 
wants 
prioritized, big subsidies to help rich 
people to buy luxury cars and new 
stoves, taxpayer funding for environ-
mental protesters—a huge catalog of 
nonsense that would not put a dent in 
global emissions, while countries like 
China continue to emit more and more. 
So I dare any of our Democratic col-
leagues to walk up to a working-class 
American on the street and ask them 
what the government ought to spend 
hundreds of billions of dollars on. 
Well, first off, in a time of inflation, 
they would probably tell them not to 
spend hundreds of billions of dollars in 
the first place. But I doubt a single 
American worker or middle-class par-
ent would say: You know what? My top 
priorities are doubling the size of the 
IRS and giving my boss a government 
kickback if he buys an $80,000 electric 
car. 
Do you know a single normal Amer-
ican family that is clamoring for this

nonsense? 
Americans 
want 
lower 
prices. They want border security. 
They want more police and public safe-
ty. Americans don’t want tens of thou-
sands more IRS agents. They want 
more Border Patrol and ICE agents. 
Americans don’t want Democrats to 
regulate us into an even deeper reces-
sion. They want liberals to let police 
officers bring law and order back to our 
streets. 
Democrats want to spend hundreds of 
billions of dollars on a 3-percent issue 
while they completely neglect crime 
and border security and make inflation 
and the recession even worse. 
Democrats are catastrophically out 
of touch with what American families 
actually do care about. Their approval 
ratings show it, and their reckless tax-
ing-and-spending spree proves it as 
well. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
NOMINATION OF ROOPALI H. DESAI 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today 
the Senate will continue fulfilling its 
constitutional duty to confirm the 
President’s highly qualified judicial 
nominees. 
This afternoon, we will vote to con-
firm the 76th Federal judge since the 
beginning of President Biden’s term, 
Roopali Desai, nominated to serve as a 
circuit judge for the Ninth Circuit. 
Not long ago, a nominee like Ms. 
Desai would have been rarely seen in 
the Senate. But under President Biden, 
the Senate is confirming more and 
more nominees who break away from 
that norm. Over 75 percent of President 
Biden’s nominees are women and near-
ly half are women are color. Let’s not 
forget the bench. People say: Why 
shouldn’t it be the same percentage of 
the population? That is what we are 
trying to get to, but we are way behind 
and putting more women and people of 
color on the bench gets those percent-
ages a little closer to the American 
norm, but we have a ways to go. 
Moreover, Ms. Desai will make his-
tory as the first South Asian judge to 
serve on the Ninth Circuit and only the 
fifth AAPI woman ever to sit on the 
Federal Circuit Court. 
Ms. Desai’s resume leaves no doubt 
she merits confirmation: a graduate of 
Arizona School of Law; a clerk for 
Judge Mary Schroeder, the first woman 
to ever serve as a Ninth Circuit chief 
judge. She has excelled in every step of 
her legal career. She is one of Arizona’s 
top election lawyers, having played a 
crucial role in protecting her State’s 
elections in 2020. She has fought for ev-
eryone from children in foster care to 
children in public schools during the 
pandemic. 
As my Arizona colleagues Senator 
SINEMA and Senator KELLY will attest 
to, Ms. Desai is deeply respected by all 
corners of Arizona’s legal community 
and will make an excellent judge when 
we confirm her later today. 
SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
Mr. President, Senate Democrats are 
getting things done. This has been one 
of the most productive stretches the 
Senate has seen in recent times. 
In the past few months, we have seen 
an amazing string of achievements 
passed through this Chamber in ex-
tremely fast succession: the first major 
gun safety bill in 30 years, the largest 
investment 
in 
American 
manufac-
turing and science in a generation, the 
largest expanse of veterans’ benefits in 
decades. 
And 
just 
last 
night, 
we 
strengthened NATO by approving the 
accession of Sweden and Finland, send-
ing Russia a signal that they cannot 
intimidate America or Europe. Gun 
safety, CHIPS, PACT, NATO—getting 
any one of these accomplishments done 
is a significant feat for the Senate. The 
fact is, we have done them all since 
Memorial Day, and that is quite re-
markable. 
This doesn’t even include a once-in-a- 
generation infrastructure bill, a his-
toric rescue package to vaccinate the 
Nation and lift America out of the pan-
demic, and the confirmation of Ketanji 
Brown Jackson as the first Black 
woman to ever serve on the U.S. Su-
preme Court. 
I always said that when the oppor-
tunity arises, Democrats would be 
ready to work with our Republican col-
leagues on important legislation, and 
many of the accomplishments I have 
listed are examples of just that. But 
when we must, Democrats have also 
made clear we are ready to go at it 
alone to deliver big things that the 
American people sent us here to work 
on, like fighting inflation and lowering 
healthcare and prescription drug costs; 
like holding drug companies account-
able and making Big Business play by 
the rules, the same rules as everyone 
else; like passing historic investments 
in clean energy to create millions of 
good-paying jobs and make energy 
more affordable for American families. 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 2022 
Mr. President, Democrats are going 
to deliver on all these things and more 
when we pass the Inflation Reduction 
Act in coming days. 
Let me talk a little bit about the In-
flation Reduction Act. Soon the Senate 
will vote on this groundbreaking legis-
lation. I expect we will have some late 
nights and extended debates here on 
the floor. But in the end, we are going 
to make good on our word to pass the 
Inflation Reduction Act. 
For years, many in Washington have 
promised to tackle some of the biggest 
challenges facing our Nation only to 
fall short. But with the Inflation Re-
duction Act, Senate Democrats will fi-
nally hold drug companies accountable 
and make prescription drugs cheaper. 
Senate Democrats will lower energy 
costs while passing the largest invest-
ment in clean energy ever. Our clean 
energy proposals will reduce air pollu-
tion, prevent thousands of needless 
deaths each year, and reduce asthma 
attacks by about 100,000 per year. We 
have all seen kids, often in poor neigh-
borhoods, struggling with asthma be-
cause they have so much pollution put 
in their areas by transportation and 
factories and whatever. Reducing that 
by 100,000 a year is amazing. 
Senate Democrats will also close tax 
loopholes and reduce the deficits and 
will ensure that no small business or 
family under $400,000 a year will see 
their taxes go up. Leader MCCONNELL, 
himself, conceded yesterday that our 
proposal ‘‘includes no new tax rate in-
creases, that’s true.’’ Those are McCon-
nell’s words: ‘‘includes no new tax rate 
increases, that’s true.’’ Let me repeat 
that again. Leader MCCONNELL
con-
cedes that now the Inflation Reduction 
Act includes no new tax rate increases. 
The American people overwhelm-
ingly support these steps. A recent poll 
by the well-respected Navigator shows 
65 percent of Americans approve of our 
plan to reduce drug prices, keep pre-
miums low, and invest in clean energy. 
A Morning Consult poll found that over 
70 percent of Americans—over 70 per-
cent—support letting Medicare nego-
tiate prescription drug prices, which 
our plan will do. Another group, Data 
for Progress, found the Inflation Re-
duction Act has a net approval of 51 
points—51 points—wow. 
It is not hard to understand why 
Americans feel this way. Democrats’ 
agenda prioritizes them. We prioritize 
the middle class and working families 
instead of those at the very top. God 
bless them; they are doing fine. 
But when Senate Republicans had 
the 
majority, 
they 
tried 
to 
rip 
healthcare 
away 
from 
millions 
of 
Americans and blew a $2 trillion hole 
in our deficit in order to soak the 
ultrarich with massive tax cuts. 
Just this week, one Republican called 
for ending the days that Medicare and 
Social Security are guaranteed by 
turning them into discretionary spend-
ing. Do you know what that means 
when we make things discretionary? 
Do we want to tell our senior citizens 
that your Social Security, which you 
paid into, was discretionary? That is 
what Senator JOHNSON from Wisconsin 
wants to do. That is so wrong. But, un-
fortunately, it represents a lot of the 
views of lots of Republicans who don’t 
want to say it publicly because they 
know it is so unpopular. 
Back in February—listen to this 
one—the chair of the Republican Sen-
ate Campaign Arm, the junior Senator 
from Florida, released a platform for 
raising taxes not on the wealthy but on 
millions of low-income Americans. You 
can’t make this stuff up.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4006 
August 4, 2022 
They want to make your Social Secu-
rity discretionary but then want to 
raise your taxes. What kind of bull is 
that? 
Just listen to this tsunami of disas-
trous proposals: taking away people’s 
healthcare, tax cuts for the rich, put-
ting Medicare and Social Security on 
the chopping block, raising taxes on 
working Americans. These are just 
some of the things that Senate Repub-
licans have openly called for recently. 
Democrats’ agenda is something en-
tirely different. The Inflation Reduc-
tion Act will lower inflation, lower the 
cost of prescription drugs, close loop-
holes long exploited by Big Business 
that pays no or little taxes. That is 
what the Inflation Reduction Act is at 
its core. 
It is what the American people want; 
it is what the country so desperately 
needs; and it is what Democrats will 
deliver on in the coming days. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Maryland. 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 2022 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
was just listening to the majority lead-
er outline some of the disastrous poli-
cies that Republicans have proposed to 
make, including putting Medicare on 
the chopping block by making it dis-
cretionary. 
I want to talk a little bit about the 
good things that Democrats have done, 
some on a bipartisan basis and some 
which it looks like we are going to 
have to do alone for the American peo-
ple. In just the last few weeks, this 
U.S. Senate has made historic progress 
tackling a number of very real and 
very urgent challenges that our coun-
try faces. 
We passed the first major gun reform 
bill in 30 years. We passed historic leg-
islation to boost American manufac-
turing 
of 
essential 
semiconductor 
chips—important to our economy and 
our national security. We passed the 
PACT Act so that veterans exposed to 
toxins will get the care they deserve. 
Just yesterday, we voted to admit Fin-
land and Sweden as new members of 
NATO, 
therefore 
expanding 
and 
strengthening the Atlantic alliance in 
the face of Putin’s brutal war against 
Ukraine. 
These are major accomplishments, 
but now is not the time to rest on our 
laurels, now is not the time to coast, 
because we have to do everything we 
can to fight back against rising prices, 
against inflation, which has been driv-
en in recent months by what I call the 
three p’s: Putin’s war and its impact on 
energy and food prices; the pandemic 
and the supply chain disruptions it has 
caused; and price gouging by big oil 
companies that are reaping record prof-
its. Those have been big drivers of in-
flation. 
I have listened to my Republican 
Senate colleagues here on the floor 
week after week trying to exploit infla-
tion as a campaign issue, as if it were 
all caused by the policies of President 
Biden. The American people know 
much better. They also know that 
while Republicans are talking up infla-
tion and talking down the economy, we 
in the Democratic majority had a plan 
to do something about rising costs, and 
it is called the Inflation Reduction Act. 
In coming days, we are going to be 
voting on that, and I hope—I hope—our 
Republican colleagues will have a 
change of heart, at least some of them, 
because here is the bottom line: The 
Inflation Reduction Act will drive 
down prices over time, it will reduce 
the deficit, and it will do that without 
raising taxes on anyone making under 
$400,000 a year, not by one dime. It does 
all that while addressing four major 
issues facing our country: the need to 
lower healthcare costs, the need to ad-
dress the climate crisis, the need to fix 
parts of our broken tax system—this is 
a start on that—and reducing the def-
icit. 
First, on healthcare, all of us in this 
Chamber have known that the costs of 
prescription drugs in the United States 
are way too high, out of control. Our 
constituents—Americans—pay twice as 
much on prescription drugs as people 
in other advanced economies around 
the world. And it is not just squeezing 
people’s pocketbooks—that, of course, 
hurts—it is also jeopardizing their 
health. 
If you look at the 2022 study by the 
Kaiser Family Foundation, they found 
that nearly one in three adults re-
ported that they had not taken their 
medications as prescribed due to cost. 
They were too expensive. They couldn’t 
afford them. That financial pressure is 
hard on everybody. It is especially so 
on many of our seniors. Nearly 9 in 10 
older adults take prescription medica-
tion, but millions of Americans 65 and 
older say they struggle to afford their 
medicine. 
Here is what adds insult to injury: 
American taxpayers spend over $40 bil-
lion every year to support cutting-edge 
medical research happening at the Na-
tional Institutes of Health in my State 
of Maryland. That is a great invest-
ment for our country. It helps discover 
and it helps develop and produce many 
of the life-changing medications that 
are available to American families 
today and to people around the world. 
But it is just not right for American 
taxpayers to invest $40 billion a year in 
developing drugs that are then sold by 
American pharmaceutical companies 
here in the United States for two, 
three, four times as much as they are 
sold overseas. 
People throughout the world benefit 
from the great research done at places 
like NIH, and they pay lower costs on 
the medicines developed from that re-
search than Americans who helped 
fund the research in the first place. 
That is just not right. That is why the 
Inflation Reduction Act finally empow-
ers the Medicare Program to negotiate 
prices with the pharmaceutical indus-
try. Private insurance companies nego-
tiate volume discounts every day, all 
the time, to try to get a better deal for 
their members. Why should we tie the 
hands of the Medicare Program? 
I say ‘‘finally’’ because the Presiding 
Officer and I and many others in this 
Chamber have worked for not just 1 or 
2 years but for decades to try to 
achieve this, and every time, the phar-
maceutical industry has succeeded in 
blocking it because if you take away 
the power of Medicare to negotiate 
drug prices, it means they get to write 
the bill themselves. So this is impor-
tant. 
It is also accompanied by a cap on 
Medicare Part D out-of-pocket spend-
ing to $2,000 a year. 
Last but not least, this legislation 
extends 
the 
important 
work 
we 
achieved through the American Rescue 
Plan to lower the healthcare costs for 
people who get their insurance through 
the affordable care exchanges. In my 
State, Marylanders are saving an aver-
age of $80 every month on their 
healthcare premiums because of that 
provision from the American Rescue 
Plan, which this bill will extend for 3 
more years. 
We are joined in this effort by a vast 
coalition of Americans who have been 
pushing for years to address prescrip-
tion drug prices, including AARP and 
its 38 million members who support 
this bill. 
Meanwhile, we have seen some bil-
lion-dollar pharmaceutical companies 
pouring their profits into negative ads 
to try to defeat this bill. In fact, just 
last night, I saw two or three of them 
within the space of about an hour as I 
was flipping channels at home. But I 
think the country is pretty clear on 
what is at stake here. On the one hand, 
you have tens and tens of millions of 
Americans who will benefit from low-
ering the costs of prescription drugs. 
Yet you have Big Pharma trying to 
maintain this privileged position where 
we don’t have to negotiate with them 
in order to boost their profits. 
So let’s be clear on what we are going 
to do. We are going to allow Medicare 
to negotiate prices, and that will lower 
the costs for seniors. We are capping 
out-of-pocket spending for seniors. We 
are making it more affordable to get 
health insurance through the Afford-
able Care Act marketplaces. Yet, right 
now, as of today, we have every one of 
our Republicans voting no. 
When I go around Maryland, this is 
not a party or a partisan issue. All of 
my constituents want us to take this 
action. The same is true of climate 
change. Most Americans, regardless of 
party, recognize the very real harm 
caused by climate change. They just 
have to look around them or turn on 
the news. But apparently, when you 
enter the Senate Republican Cloak-
room, you go into a science-free and 
fact-free zone. Many of our colleagues 
still doubt the fact of human-caused 
climate change. But that is out of 
touch with the American people, who 
see the harm every day and also see the 
promise of developing a clean energy 
industry.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4007 
August 4, 2022 
That is why our legislation makes 
this big investment in more rapidly de-
ploying clean energy technology, and 
in doing so, we are projected to cut 
U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide and 
other greenhouse gases by 40 percent 
by 2030. We should move even faster, 
but at least this gets us in the game to 
hitting the targets that we have to. We 
will do that while supercharging the 
development, manufacturing, and de-
ployment of wind, solar, and battery 
power. 
I want to talk about a couple of pro-
visions in this bill—there are many—a 
couple that I have worked on over the 
years. 
First, this bill includes what is called 
the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, 
$27 billion, some of which could support 
a national climate bank, which is an 
initiative I have been working on since 
my time in the House of Representa-
tives and now in the Senate with my 
colleague ED MARKEY and in the House 
today 
with 
Congresswoman 
DEBBIE 
DINGELL. 
A national climate bank would be a 
magnet for private investment in new 
sustainable 
technology, 
channeling 
more capital into the clean energy 
space and lowering the risk to inves-
tors. For every $1 of public financing 
through a national climate bank, we 
project it will draw in $7 to $10 of pri-
vate investment, to turbocharge in-
vestments and jobs in clean energy. In 
addition, it targets a large share of in-
vestments to low-income and disadvan-
taged communities that often lack ac-
cess to financing for clean energy and 
energy efficiency projects. 
This bill also includes another provi-
sion I have worked on for a long time, 
the bill I introduced called HOPE for 
HOMES. I have worked on it with a bi-
partisan group of colleagues in both 
the House and Senate. In the House, 
that 
includes 
Congressman 
PETER 
WELCH and Congressman DAVE MCKIN-
LEY and, here in the Senate, Senator 
COONS and Senator SHAHEEN. 
The HOPE for HOMES legislation 
that has been incorporated into this 
bill will provide Americans with siz-
able rebates and with tax credits to 
retrofit their homes with clean energy 
and energy efficiency technology. So it 
will not only help us meet our climate 
goals 
and 
our 
pollution 
reduction 
goals, it is also going to save con-
sumers up to $750 every year on their 
heating and cooling bills. So we are 
going to give people a rebate to make 
their homes more energy efficient, and 
they will save money as a result. 
It also invests in clean energy jobs 
training so that we have the people 
power to help folks in every neighbor-
hood around the country access the 
help and the workers they need. It is 
estimated to help generate 80,000 jobs 
over the next couple years in this im-
portant area. 
The Inflation Reduction Act also in-
cludes major investments to develop a 
clean energy manufacturing base to re-
duce our reliance on foreign imports of 
clean energy products, including $30 
billion in tax credits designed to accel-
erate the manufacturing of solar pan-
els, wind turbines, batteries, and crit-
ical minerals right here in the United 
States. 
China has made it one of its goals— 
and they have been very open about 
it—to dominate the clean energy tech-
nology space for years to come. We 
need to make sure that we manufac-
ture critical technologies and products 
right here in the United States. 
I want to give you a great example 
from my State of Maryland, which is at 
the vanguard of a budding offshore 
wind industry. Right now, we have two 
companies in Maryland—Orsted and 
U.S. Wind—that are building new wind 
turbine fabrication centers in our 
State to support their offshore wind 
farms coming to the mid-Atlantic—two 
major projects off Maryland’s Atlantic 
coast. 
The Deputy Secretary of Commerce 
was just in Baltimore yesterday talk-
ing 
about 
apprenticeship 
programs 
that will help support 10,000 jobs, 10,000 
Maryland jobs, as part of this offshore 
wind manufacturing. That is just in 
the State of Maryland, and we can do 
that across the country in terms of off-
shore wind in coastal States and, of 
course, interior wind for others. 
These are really important provi-
sions that I have talked about—fight-
ing the climate crisis, lowering the 
cost of prescription drugs—so let’s talk 
about how they are paid for. 
Unlike the Republican tax bill in 
2017, which provided huge tax give-
aways to big corporations and very 
wealthy individuals, this legislation 
actually 
will 
both 
pay 
for 
itself 
through the cuts made and recycled 
and through fixing parts of our broken 
tax system. We have a lot of work to do 
to fix our tax system, but this is a 
downpayment in terms of the policy 
changes in this bill. 
First, we are going to beef up IRS en-
forcement to go after wealthy tax 
cheats, and this is an important issue. 
I chair the subcommittee that oversees 
the IRS, and we have been pushing for 
years to make sure that the IRS has 
the resources and the expertise to 
track down taxes that are already due 
and owing from very wealthy people 
who 
come 
up 
with 
elaborate 
tax 
dodges. 
Right now, we estimate there is any-
where from $500 billion to $1 trillion in 
taxes each year that are owed but not 
paid. Think about that—up to $1 tril-
lion every year in taxes that are owed 
but not paid, and the people who are 
suckered are all the people who pay 
when you have these very wealthy tax 
cheats skirting their responsibilities. 
So this bill will address that issue. 
Second, we make sure that big cor-
porations invest in the success of ev-
eryday Americans. In 2020, 55 huge 
American 
corporations 
paid 
zero— 
zero—in taxes, despite a combined $40.5 
billion in profits—$40.5 billion in prof-
its from these 55 companies; zero taxes 
paid. 
Small businesses across the country 
are paying their taxes while some of 
these big corporations are not. That is 
not fair. It needs to change. 
That is why the Inflation Reduction 
Act includes the 15 percent minimum 
tax on profits of corporations that have 
over $1 billion in annual profits. 
And I want to thank the Presiding 
Officer for his leadership on this issue. 
Third, our legislation would tighten 
the rules on what is known as carried 
interest, which allows hedge fund man-
agers to pay a lower rate on their in-
come than the rate their employees 
pay on theirs—the classic example of 
how a big hedge fund CEO can pay a 
lower tax rate than their receptionist. 
This is a fact under our current Tax 
Code, and I hope we will keep this pro-
vision in this bill because this loop-
hole, the carried interest loophole, is 
Exhibit A of some of the biggest 
unfairnesses in our Tax Code. 
So taken together, the measures to 
lower the cost of prescription drugs, 
lower the cost of energy to American 
households and consumers, reduce the 
deficit—these measures will reduce in-
flationary pressures that are bearing 
down on working families. You don’t 
have to take my word for it. In just the 
last few days, economists from all over 
the country have spoken out in favor of 
this approach and supporting this leg-
islation. 
One 
hundred 
twenty-six 
leading 
economists recently wrote to the con-
gressional leadership: 
This proposal addresses some of the coun-
try’s biggest challenges at a significant 
scale. And because it is deficit-reducing, it 
does so while putting downward pressure on 
inflation. 
And that is key. Unlike that Repub-
lican tax giveaway in 2017 that added $2 
trillion to our national debt, we are ac-
tually reducing our deficit, and by re-
ducing the deficit, you also put down-
ward pressure on inflation. 
In recent months, I have heard the 
Republican leader, Senator MCCON-
NELL, often citing former Secretary of 
Treasury Larry Summers about Larry 
Summers’ views on the economy and 
inflation. 
Well, here is what Larry Summers 
had to say recently about the bill we 
will be voting on: 
The prescription drug provisions, energy 
incentives, and the increased Medicare bene-
fits will all contribute over time to much 
needed inflation reduction. 
And just yesterday, former Secretary 
Summers was joined by former Sec-
retary of the Treasury Hank Paulson, 
who, of course, served under former 
President George W. Bush, who with 
other Secretaries wrote: 
. . . we support the Inflation Reduction Act 
which is financed by prudent tax policy that 
will collect more from top-earners and large 
corporations. 
And, again, by using those revenues 
to reduce the deficit, we put downward 
pressure on inflation. 
I just, as we close here, want to con-
trast that to the approach that Repub-
licans took in 2017 with their tax give-
away.

S4008

As I said, that ballooned the deficit 
by $2 trillion. It also handed the top 1 
percent income earners an average tax 
cut of $69,000 each in 2018 alone. So just 
in 1 year, about a $70,000 tax cut to the 
top 1 percent. And the Congressional 
Budget Office estimated that 43 percent 
of the growth in economic output from 
the 2017 tax law flowed to foreign in-
vestors in that space. So foreign inves-
tors have holdings in U.S. corpora-
tions. That tax cut to American cor-
porations—yes, it flowed to some very 
wealthy Americans, but a lot of it 
flowed offshore to foreign investors. 
So what we have seen from our col-
leagues across the aisle is big tax cuts 
to corporations and the very wealthy, 
not just here at home but benefiting 
others around the world, in contrast to 
this, which does ask big corporations 
to pay their fair share—minimum of 15 
percent—and reduces the deficit as we 
invest in job creation and reduce prices 
here at home. 
So this is a win for families; it is a 
win for seniors; it is a win for our plan-
et, our economy. It is a win for the 
country. 
So I hope as this debate goes forward, 
that we will focus on the facts, listen 
to what it does, because this is a com-
prehensive piece of legislation that 
does help us tackle some of the key pri-
orities in front of our country, and we 
are hearing that from our constituents 
every day. 
So I am proud to support this legisla-
tion. Let’s get it done. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). The Senator from South Da-
kota. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last 
week, Democrats unveiled their so- 
called Inflation Reduction Act, a bill 
that will do nothing to reduce inflation 
but will double down on Democrats’ 
wasteful government spending, along 
with imposing hundreds of billions of 
dollars in tax hikes—yes, hundreds of 
billions of dollars in tax hikes. 
Our economy has posted negative 
economic growth for the past two quar-
ters, and Democrats think it is a good 
idea to raise taxes on American busi-
nesses. Perhaps Democrats think that 
current prices aren’t high enough or 
that 
businesses 
aren’t 
struggling 
enough with the inflation that Demo-
crats helped create. 
The worst part, of course, is that a 
substantial part of the burden of these 
tax hikes will fall on ordinary Ameri-
cans, Americans who are already strug-
gling with historically high inflation, 
Americans who are seeing their gro-
cery bills balloon and their rent sky-
rocket, Americans who are paying 
more than $4 per gallon every time 
they fill up their car. 
Now, Democrats are going to pass tax 
hikes that will hit these Americans 
hard—a tax hike on businesses that 
will almost undoubtedly result in lower 
growth, lower wages, and fewer jobs; a 
tax hike on investment—investment 
that we need to grow our economy and 
create 
opportunities 
for 
American 
workers; and tax hikes on energy pro-
duction. 
That is right, tax hikes on energy 
production to the tune of $60 billion. 
Now, as I mentioned, Americans are 
still, on average, paying more than $4 a 
gallon every time they go to fill up 
their cars, as they have been for 
months. Their electricity bills are up. 
The price for utility gas service is up 
by almost 40 percent. And Democrats 
think now is a good time to raise taxes 
on oil and gas production? 
I guess maybe they are hoping that 
they can force Americans off conven-
tional energy by continuing to keep 
gas and energy prices high. 
And in case anyone was thinking 
that Democrats would be content with 
shutting down domestic production— 
with a methane tax, higher royalties, 
excise taxes, and costly permitting 
delays—and would rather Americans 
receive 
conventional 
energy 
from 
abroad, well, Democrats have a tax 
hike for that too. 
The Democrats’ bill would impose a 
new tax hike on U.S. refiners import-
ing crude oil and petroleum products 
intended to make conventional energy 
prohibitively expensive. 
But, of course, Americans will need 
conventional energy, and that will con-
tinue to be true for a while yet, no 
matter how much wishful thinking 
Democrats engage in. 
And Democrats’ energy tax hikes are 
setting ordinary Americans up to con-
tinue to suffer under high energy prices 
for the foreseeable future. 
So what are all these tax hikes for? 
What government spending is worth 
imposing tax hikes that run the risk of 
pushing our economy into a longer re-
cession or, worse yet, stagflation? 
Well, let me just review some of the 
priorities 
that 
Democrats 
will 
be 
spending that tax hike money on. 
There is $1.5 billion—billion dollars— 
for a grant program to plant trees, and 
$1.9 billion for things like identifying 
gaps in tree canopy coverage. That is 
right, identifying gaps in tree canopy 
coverage. 
There is $1 billion for electric heavy- 
duty vehicles like garbage trucks. I am 
not really sure why the Federal Gov-
ernment is going to be spending money 
on electric garbage trucks or how that 
is going to reduce inflation. 
There is $3 billion for the U.S. Postal 
Service to purchase zero-emission de-
livery vehicles. Quite a lot of money, I 
might add, for an Agency that is sup-
posedly self-funded. 
There is funding for road equity. 
All told, there is more than $60 bil-
lion in funding for ‘‘environmental jus-
tice’’—$60 billion. That is more than 
the Federal Government spent on high-
ways in 2019. 
There is also at least $30 billion in 
climate slush funds, part of which is al-
located for, among other things, cli-
mate-related political activity—yeah, 
political activity. 
So, in other words, Democrats are 
raising taxes on Americans so that 
they can provide Federal funding for 
Green 
New 
Deal 
activism. 
And 
I 
haven’t even talked about all the tax 
credits for adopting Democrats’ pre-
ferred green energy technologies. 
There are tax credits for purchasing 
electric vehicles and for refitting win-
dows and skylights and doors to meet 
Democrats’ required level of energy ef-
ficiency. That is right, Democrats are 
raising the tax burden on working 
Americans to pay for tax credits for 
wealthy 
Americans 
to 
purchase 
a 
brandnew electric vehicle or to do 
some home remodeling. 
Of course, these tax credits aren’t of-
ficially limited to wealthy Americans, 
but I am hard-pressed to think of many 
working families who can afford to 
spend $60,000 on a new electric vehicle 
while inflation is at a 40-year high. 
I am a longtime supporter of clean 
energy. I come from a State that is 
leading the way toward cleaner and 
more efficient energy technologies, and 
I have worked with colleagues from 
both parties to advance clean energy, 
including through the responsible use 
of energy tax credits to bring clean en-
ergy technologies to the point where 
they can compete on their own. 
But this bill has nothing in common 
with the bipartisan work I and many 
others have done to responsibly ad-
vance clean energy. This bill is waste-
ful and irresponsible and will do essen-
tially nothing to reduce warming glob-
ally as others nations continue to 
skate by. 
It will, however, waste a lot of tax-
payer dollars and create a lot of eco-
nomic pain for hard-working Ameri-
cans. 
One think tank analyzed a plan simi-
lar to the one Democrats are pushing 
and found that it would result in stag-
gering job losses, higher energy bills, 
and a tremendous reduction in eco-
nomic growth. 
One sensible move to advance clean 
energy and necessary investment in 
conventional energy would be to ad-
dress the arduous permitting process 
which can hold up both renewable and 
conventional energy projects for years. 
That is something we should be focused 
on, to promote investment in the con-
ventional energy we still need and in 
the renewable energy technologies of 
the future. 
Instead, we are being asked to sup-
port a bill that will squander billions 
and billions of taxpayer dollars on 
Green New Deal activism and road eq-
uity and monitoring tree canopies. 
And we are supposed to vote for it 
based on the vague promise that the 
Senate will consider—consider, mind 
you, not pass—permitting legislation; 
permitting legislation that may or 
may not meaningfully address the bro-
ken and burdensome permitting proc-
ess or negate spurious lawsuits from 
far-left environmentalists. And even if 
it did provide meaningful reform, my 
hopes are not high that the Biden ad-
ministration would actually act on the 
legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4009 
August 4, 2022 
Canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline, 
a project that endured a decade of per-
mitting, was already underway, and 
was to be paired with $1.7 billion in pri-
vate—yes, private—investment for re-
newables—it doesn’t install confidence 
that even approved projects are safe 
from the President and Democrats’ 
Green New Deal ideology. 
The Democrats’ reckless $1.9 trillion 
American Rescue Plan spending spree 
helped plunge our economy into an in-
flation crisis that has left Americans 
struggling to make ends meet. If this 
new, partisan tax-and-spending spree 
passes, Americans can look forward to 
a lot more economic pain in the future. 
But at least they will be able to con-
sole themselves with the knowledge 
that their tax dollars are going to fund 
tree canopies. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to support Senator SULLIVAN’s 
resolution of disapproval to nullify the 
Biden administration’s rollback of re-
forms to the National Environmental 
Policy Act, or NEPA, process. 
We have heard a lot about permitting 
and how everything is going to be im-
proved. If you want to make a state-
ment on how you want to improve per-
mitting, this should be a ‘‘yes’’ vote for 
everybody. 
I want to thank my colleague from 
Alaska for his leadership on bringing 
together half of this Chamber in sup-
port of S.J. Res. 55, which is cospon-
sored by 50 Senators. 
This resolution is vital to take us to-
wards a path of quicker, more predict-
able environmental reviews as we seek 
to 
improve 
our 
transportation—re-
member, we just passed a big infra-
structure bill with a lot of transpor-
tation—our water infrastructure, en-
ergy infrastructure, reclaim our energy 
independence, and build our domestic 
supply chain. 
Instead of making the environmental 
review process more efficient, the 
Biden administration is doing every-
thing in its power to make it much, 
much more difficult. 
Environmental reviews are notorious 
for holding up energy and infrastruc-
ture projects. What happens? Well, 
some of them don’t get done, and a lot 
of them get a heck of a lot more expen-
sive and take longer to do. 
We all know it is important to make 
sure that we assess the environmental 
impacts that a project will have before 
moving forward on construction, but 
the Biden administration is focused on 
making them more complicated and 
longer when the status quo is already 
unacceptable. 
In 2020, the White House’s Council on 
Environmental Quality found that it 
took an average of 41⁄2 years to com-
plete an environmental impact state-
ment under NEPA. One-quarter of the 
1,276 projects analyzed took more than 
6 years to complete their environ-
mental impact statement. The average 
time for a Federal highway project was 
more than 7 years on their EIS. The av-
erage time for the U.S. Corps of Engi-
neers was 6 years. 
The average length of a final EIS was 
661 pages, and many of these swelled to 
thousands of pages, running contrary 
to the original intent of NEPA, which 
was to provide transparency of Federal 
Agencies’ 
decision 
making 
to 
the 
American people. 
The previous administration tried to 
streamline the Federal environmental 
review process by reforming the imple-
menting regulations for NEPA. Now, 
rather than continuing to improve en-
vironmental reviews under NEPA, the 
Biden administration has decided to 
make them more burdensome. 
Earlier this year, the Biden adminis-
tration rolled back key modernizations 
the previous administration made to 
the more than 40-year-old NEPA regu-
lations through its so-called phase 1— 
which tells me phase 2 is coming— 
NEPA rule. 
The Biden administration has cre-
ated sweeping new obstacles to the en-
vironmental review process, including 
new avenues for delays and lawsuits 
that will slow down or, as I said, kill 
projects. In particular, the phase 1 
rule’s 
expanded 
definition 
of 
‘‘ef-
fects’’—to include ‘‘indirect’’ and ‘‘cu-
mulative 
effects’’ 
of 
projects—will 
greatly delay and kill energy projects 
when we sorely need them right now. 
With the damaging phase 1 rule al-
ready in place, the Biden administra-
tion is now working on even more oner-
ous revisions to the NEPA process. If 
these revisions are not stopped, they 
will enshrine lengthier, more burden-
some, and even, in some cases, insur-
mountable hurdles for any infrastruc-
ture, whether it is mining, industrial, 
or energy. 
We keep hearing we need more en-
ergy. Well, if you can’t get permitted, 
you can’t do these projects, and that is 
what is happening. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
is 
hamstringing our Nation’s ability to 
source materials and build infrastruc-
ture of all kinds for all Americans. 
Whether it is roads and bridges, pipe-
lines, electric transmission, mining, or 
renewable energy projects, an efficient 
environmental review process is crit-
ical to completing projects that sup-
port job creation and economic activ-
ity. It is also vital to building out and 
securing our domestic supply chains to 
ensure we have the fuel and mineral in-
puts to power critical services and to 
manufacture those products. 
We are not going to have all the solar 
farms and wind turbines and critical 
minerals and green jobs that the ad-
ministration has promised to energy 
workers when the environmental proc-
ess takes 5 to 7 to 10 years. 
So how do you build an economy out 
of a recession when you can’t build at 
all? Now it is time to come together 
and reform the environmental review 
process to expand our infrastructure, 
invigorate our economy, increase our 
energy capacity and supplies, advance 
our domestic industries to lower prices, 
create those much wanted jobs, and 
build a brighter future for Americans 
and certainly for my State of West Vir-
ginia. It starts with doing away with 
the roadblocks the administration is 
throwing up by passing this resolution 
and us moving on to legislate common-
sense environmental review reforms. 
We are told that in September, Sen-
ate Democrats will cast aside their 
‘‘regulate first’’ philosophy and pass 
strong permitting reform legislation. 
After years of regulatory actions that 
decimated energy production in my 
State and permitting delays that have 
held 
up 
important 
infrastructure 
projects across the country, I am skep-
tical that the Democrats will reverse 
course next month. 
So here we have an opportunity to 
have a test vote. As this NEPA rule-
making reflects, the Biden administra-
tion is hard at work creating more hur-
dles for our projects. If there isn’t over-
whelming bipartisan support for this 
resolution of disapproval that simply 
stops the permitting process from get-
ting worse, then I don’t know how any-
body can believe that Senate Demo-
crats will join to pass meaningful legis-
lation to make the process better. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this 
resolution to free our country from the 
stagnation and endless delays the ad-
ministration is pressing forward with. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, nor-
mally at this time of the week, Senator 
CAPITO and I are gathering for a face- 
to-face meeting or maybe having a 
meeting by phone as she heads back to 
West Virginia. Today, it looked like we 
were not going to have a chance to 
meet, but here we are. Ironically, most 
of those conversations we have—we are 
in sync. It is pretty amazing. Most 
folks around the country probably 
think we never agree on anything here, 
but we do. And we actually turned out 
to be pretty good friends—a couple of 
West Virginia kids who grew up and 
made out all right. It is always a pleas-
ure to be with her and to serve with 
her, like with the bipartisan infra-
structure legislation. 
Last week, we were here to pass not 
one, not two, but three bipartisan 
pieces of legislation. A couple of them 
were pretty big. There were two big re-
cycling bills and then another one deal-
ing with the Water Resources Develop-
ment Act with the Army Corps of Engi-
neers. I think we had only one negative 
vote on the reauthorization—one. The 
vote on the recycling legislation—one 
of which was your bill and one of which 
was mine, and we were cosponsors—we 
had no opposition on those bills. 
So I would say to folks who are 
watching today who say: Oh, there 
they go again, well, you should have 
tuned in last week because we were on 
the same page.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4010 
August 4, 2022 
Having said that, let me say that I 
rise today to speak on the joint resolu-
tion of disapproval to nullify President 
Biden’s National Environmental Policy 
Act regulations, oftentimes referred to 
as NEPA. 
Last year, as we drafted legislation 
that became the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture law for our country, Senator CAP-
ITO and I, along with our colleagues on 
the Environment and Public Works 
Committee, of which my colleague 
from Alaska is a valued member—the 
Senator is here. He has offered this res-
olution today, and he will be back here 
in a minute, I am sure. 
But as we drafted legislation that be-
came the bipartisan infrastructure law, 
Senator CAPITO and I, along with our 
colleagues on the EPW Committee, 
considered ways to get infrastructure 
projects done more efficiently while 
maintaining 
environmental 
protec-
tions. 
I will say that again. We considered a 
number of ways to get infrastructure 
projects done more efficiently while 
maintaining 
environmental 
protec-
tions. 
We included several changes that 
were reflective of those shared goals. In 
fact, we included quite a few of those 
changes. I will give an example of one 
of those. The bipartisan infrastructure 
law codified something that is called 
One Federal Decision, the One Federal 
Decision permitting structure. It set a 
goal for completing environmental re-
views of transportation projects within 
2 years—within 2 years. It also perma-
nently authorized the Federal Permit-
ting Improvement Steering Council 
and more. 
But, as we considered changes to the 
way we deliver infrastructure projects, 
we always tried to make sure that we 
were not undermining important envi-
ronmental safeguards. That sentiment 
reflects really the essence of the law 
that we call NEPA. 
Over 50 years ago, President Richard 
Nixon—a Republican, as you will re-
call—signed 
this 
bedrock 
environ-
mental policy into law with over-
whelming bipartisan support. In the 
time since then, NEPA has helped to 
ensure that Federal actions protect our 
quality of life and avoid costly envi-
ronmental impacts. 
NEPA is not just a means of pro-
tecting resources and conserving a 
pristine environment; NEPA also helps 
to improve Federal decisions. How is 
that? Well, by requiring Agencies to 
take a hard look at the impacts of 
their actions before they make deci-
sions—before they make decisions. 
For example, through the NEPA 
process, just a few years ago, officials 
in Colorado—this is a good example— 
officials in Colorado heard robust pub-
lic feedback when planning improve-
ments on State Highway 9 that led 
them to take steps to minimize dis-
turbances to communities and to the 
environment. The final project was ul-
timately delivered with lower emis-
sions, less harm to wildlife, and safer 
spaces for cyclists. Importantly, these 
benefits did not come at the cost of ef-
ficiency. The project was done on time 
and under budget. And this is only one 
of any number of examples that I can 
cite today. 
Making smart decisions has never 
been more important. After all, the 
science is clear: We must rapidly drive 
down greenhouse gas emissions if we 
hope to avoid the worst impacts of cli-
mate change. 
Unfortunately, the Trump adminis-
tration made changes to the NEPA 
rules. These changes prevented Agen-
cies from considering how their actions 
impact climate change and from tak-
ing commonsense steps to minimize en-
vironmental 
harm. 
The 
regulatory 
rollbacks also undermined public in-
volvement in the Federal decision-
making process. This rollback harmed 
communities of color, including Tribal 
and Native Alaskan communities, that 
rely on NEPA to defend their voices. 
Fortunately, the Biden administra-
tion has taken steps to fix the error of 
these 
regulatory 
revisions. 
Under 
President 
Biden’s 
instruction, 
the 
Council on Environmental Quality fi-
nalized a rule in April to make narrow, 
targeted changes to NEPA regulations. 
One of the most important changes was 
restoring the requirement for Agencies 
to consider the cumulative and indirect 
impacts of their actions. Considering 
such impacts can help ensure that we 
avoid actions that worsen climate 
change and negatively impact commu-
nities. 
President Biden’s NEPA rule would 
ensure that Agencies conduct environ-
mental review processes in a common-
sense, holistic manner, one that nei-
ther sacrifices efficiency for environ-
mental protection nor the other way 
around. 
This action comes at a critical time 
for our Nation. The bipartisan infra-
structure law will fund more than $1 
trillion of investments in projects that 
will last not for years but for decades 
and maybe even longer. 
I believe the decision here is clear. 
The projects under review today will 
either help address the climate crisis 
and protect communities or they will 
exacerbate emissions and make us 
more vulnerable. 
With thoughtful environmental anal-
ysis, we can build new facilities that 
are less emissions-intensive. We can 
build highways and bridges to with-
stand the kind of extreme weather that 
we are experiencing all over this coun-
try—in fact, all over the planet—and 
we can save money while we do it with 
infrastructure that is built to last. 
Blocking these regulations from tak-
ing effect is the policy equivalent of 
burying our heads in the sand, unfortu-
nately, with the rate at which the sea 
level is rising around us—and it is. 
During the course of debate on this one 
proposal today, we are going to see in 
the State of Louisiana terrible sea- 
level rises going on. Every 100 minutes, 
they lose a piece of land in Louisiana 
that is the size of a football field. Dur-
ing the course of this debate alone, 
they are going to lose several more 
football fields in Louisiana and a lot 
more in the days to come. 
Refusing to consider the impacts of 
climate change will not stop the cli-
mate from changing. It will not save 
lives from being lost from wildfires, 
from floods, and heat waves. It will not 
stop asphalt from melting under ex-
treme heat, which is what was hap-
pening a couple of weeks ago in Eng-
land. Then, over at the Tour de France, 
we had to spill thousands—tens of 
thousands—of gallons of water on the 
course they were running the bicycle 
races on. This was for the Tour de 
France—literally tens of thousands of 
gallons on the course in order to keep 
the roads from melting. Can you be-
lieve that? 
By refusing to consider the impacts 
of climate change now, we will only 
help to ensure that its worst impacts 
come to pass. It will continue to cost 
us. It will cost us not just in dollars 
but also in lives. 
With that, I urge my colleagues to 
vote on this well-intentioned but, I 
think, misguided resolution. 
Before I yield the floor, let me just 
say what a privilege it is to work with 
my colleague from Alaska. He and I ac-
tually agree on more than you might 
imagine. We both wore the uniform of 
our country for many years, those of 
the Marine Corps and Navy. The Navy 
salutes the Marine Corps today. I like 
to say: different uniforms, same team. 
While I can’t be with him on this one, 
we will find other things that we can 
agree on today. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to be able to com-
plete my remarks before the 1:45 p.m. 
vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to compliment my friend from 
Delaware. He and I do work together 
on a number of issues. We are going to 
part ways on this really important 
issue for me today. I do want to just 
make a comment to his comments. 
I would say—I wouldn’t say—I know 
there is no group that has suffered 
more at the hands of the Biden admin-
istration’s Executive orders and far- 
left environmental groups than Alaska 
Natives. I know that for a fact. 
I would invite my colleague to come 
up to Alaska with me, and I will take 
him to these communities. They can’t 
do anything—no jobs, no nothing—be-
cause every far-left group in America 
wants to shut down their opportuni-
ties. It happens all the time. 
So I would love to take him and oth-
ers up to Alaska to let them see that 
when people talk about Alaska Native 
groups and try to speak for them. Un-
fortunately, some of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle do that. No

August 4, 2022 
way. You are not going to get away 
with that on this one. 
Mr. President, we have a resolution 
that we are going to be voting on here 
in about 10 minutes. This is my Con-
gressional Review Act resolution, and I 
have spoken on the Senate floor a num-
ber of times about this. 
The CRA today, what we call a CRA, 
is quite simple. It would rescind the 
new 
Biden 
administration’s 
NEPA 
rule—that is the National Environ-
mental Policy Act rule—promulgated 
in April, which will clearly have the 
impact of slowing down the construc-
tion of literally every infrastructure 
project in America: the construction of 
roads, bridges, wind, solar, hydro— 
heck—even chip fabrication facilities, 
critical mineral projects. Pretty much 
everything is going to be slowed down 
by this. 
It is pretty straightforward. Our res-
olution just says: We want to rescind 
the resolution, the regulation, from 
April. 
But the vote on this is much more 
significant than just one Senate resolu-
tion. It is a test for all Senators on two 
key issues. 
First, are you really serious about 
permitting reform so that America can 
build the infrastructure that everybody 
knows our country desperately needs? 
Second, who do you stand with—the 
working men and women of our great 
Nation who build things or the far-left 
elite special interest groups who want 
to shut this country down? 
Let’s take these two issues in order. 
First, permitting reform. My col-
leagues know this is a passion of mine. 
Actually, it is a passion of a number of 
Senators. It sounds wonky; it sounds 
boring; it sounds technical—‘‘permit-
ting reform.’’ But in reality, it is so 
important for our Nation—for every 
community in America, for the dignity 
of work, for good jobs in this country. 
Here is why: We used to build big 
things in America—engineering mar-
vels on time, on budget—the source of 
pride for literally all Americans and 
the envy of the world. We did that all 
the time. Think about it: the Empire 
State Building—410 days to build; the 
Pentagon, the biggest building in the 
world—16 months; a little closer to 
home for me is the 1,700-mile Alaska- 
Canadian Highway through some of the 
world’s 
most 
rugged 
terrain—11 
months; the Trans-Alaska Pipeline sys-
tem that feeds a hungry nation with 
energy from Alaska to the lower 48— 
800 miles with 70,000 sections of 48-inch 
pipe joined and welded together, 3 
mountain ranges, 800 river beds from 
the Arctic Ocean to the Pacific—3 
years. Incredible. 
Why did we do this? Why can we do 
this? Why can we still do this in Amer-
ica? Because we have the best work-
ers—the most productive workforce—in 
the world. 
Unfortunately, those days of building 
great things in America in an efficient, 
timely fashion are gone. We all know 
it. Every mayor knows it; every city 
council member knows it; every Gov-
ernor knows it; and, yes, every U.S. 
Senator knows it. 
We see it every day. We don’t see the 
great building of things, but we see the 
other things: 8 to 9 years to permit a 
bridge—yes, in America, to permit a 
bridge; 9 to 19 years to permit and 
build a highway. The Gross water res-
ervoir in Colorado, for clean water, 
took 20 years to permit. The Ken-
sington mine, which is a gold mine in 
Alaska that is now employing hundreds 
of people with an average wage of 
$110,000—really 
good 
jobs—took 
20 
years to permit with litigation. 
This is killing our country, our econ-
omy, and good jobs. We all know it, 
and we all know the reason for it. 
Every single Senator knows the reason: 
a broken Federal permitting system 
that has turned into a labyrinth of red-
tape; 
a 
system 
that 
invites 
and 
incentivizes delay and litigation by 
groups whose goal is to shut down the 
building of our country. Everybody 
knows it. It is a fact. 
Now, how can I be so sure? Because 
everybody in this body likes to talk 
about the need for permitting reform 
so we can get back to building this 
country and putting Americans who do 
these hard jobs to work. 
Last year, I worked hard with a num-
ber of my colleagues on the bipartisan 
infrastructure bill, which I voted on. In 
the EPW Committee—and my col-
league from Delaware is still here—we 
got some important permitting reforms 
in it. That was good. They were not 
enough, in my view, but it was a good 
start. 
Today, as we consider Senator SCHU-
MER’s reconciliation bill, which I will 
oppose, we are all now being assured 
that 
Senator 
SCHUMER, 
Speaker 
PELOSI, and even the President are 
fully committed to additional robust 
permitting 
legislation 
in 
the 
fall, 
sometime in the future, once their 
massive 
tax-and-spending 
reconcili-
ation bill passes. So everybody is talk-
ing about permitting. We all know we 
need it. 
But here is what happened. In the 
meantime, between the ‘‘important but 
not as ambitious as I would have 
liked’’ permitting reforms in the infra-
structure bill last fall and all of the 
talk of permitting today, something 
happened. What happened? 
The Biden administration promul-
gated a new NEPA rule, supported by 
far-left environmental groups, that will 
clearly have the effect of slowing down 
the permitting of infrastructure, invit-
ing endless litigation and putting peo-
ple out of work. No one who has seri-
ously looked at this broad, nebulous, 
and destructive Biden rule disputes 
this. I have read it. It is a delay bomb 
for infrastructure. 
So here is the first test. It was noted 
in a very good, recent Wall Street 
Journal editorial this week. It is this: 
If my colleagues—all of my colleagues 
but especially my Democratic col-
leagues—really support permitting re-
form so we can get back to building 
America, let’s get rid of this destruc-
tive, overbroad, vague, litigation-invit-
ing rule. Vote yes on my resolution. 
Right now, 50 Republican Senators are 
cosponsors of this resolution. 
To my Democratic colleagues, join 
us. Do the right thing for America. We 
all know that this is the right thing for 
America. 
Here is the second test. I asked you 
to join us in doing the right thing for 
America. Join us in doing the right 
thing for the working Americans and 
building trades that heroically built 
this country and continue to do so 
today. 
Now, I love this photo. It is iconic. It 
says so much, and I have had it on the 
floor a number of times. But these are 
the kind of men and women who built 
this great Nation—hard-working Amer-
icans who are doing incredible stuff. 
That is a lunch break, by the way, in 
the building of the Empire State Build-
ing. 
This shouldn’t be hard to support the 
men and women who build this coun-
try, and this shouldn’t be hard for my 
Democratic colleagues who often claim 
to support the working men and 
women of America. In the past, I cer-
tainly will acknowledge that that has 
been true, but today—and I have 
learned this lesson the hard way back 
home in Alaska. Today, whenever na-
tional Democrats have to choose be-
tween the interests of the far-left elite 
environmental groups and these men 
and women who produce things and 
build things in America, they sell out 
the working class every time—every 
time. I see this every day in my State. 
I mentioned this in a Congress com-
mittee hearing a few months ago. One 
of my Democratic colleagues, who is a 
friend—and almost everybody on the 
other side of the aisle is a good friend 
of mine—got upset with me. 
He said: Hey, that is not true. You 
shouldn’t have said that. 
Well, here is what I say: All right. 
Prove it. 
Today’s vote is a chance to prove me 
wrong or to prove me right. Here is 
why, and this is really important. 
Let’s look at the lineup of the groups 
that support my resolution today and 
those that oppose it. These are just 
some of the 50 groups in America that 
are supporting my resolution that we 
are going to vote on here in a couple of 
minutes, and I am very proud of this 
incredible, broad, and diverse groups of 
Americans who are saying to vote yes 
on the Sullivan resolution. They all 
have one thing in common: They 
produce things and they build things 
for this great Nation. 
Take a look at this chart. It is kind 
of hard to decipher who is on it. Let me 
give you a couple. 
The American Farm Bureau: So this 
is all of our farmers and cattlemen—all 
of our cattlemen, farmers and ranch-
ers, and ag retailers. 
The National Stone, Sand & Gravel 
Association: These are the guys who 
build infrastructure.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4012 
August 4, 2022 
It is the same with the Associated 
General Contractors of America, the 
same with the U.S. Chamber, the same 
with the National Association of Manu-
facturers, the same with the American 
Mining Rights Association. 
Of course, the entire energy sector is 
supporting this, groups from Alaska, 
the 
resource 
development 
sector, 
groups from West Virginia, and groups 
from Ohio. This is a huge, broad-based 
group of supporters. 
I will tell you this. I am most proud 
of the strong, robust support for my 
resolution from organizations that rep-
resent the men and women who build 
stuff and keep our country’s economy 
humming. 
Take a look at some of them: The 
North 
America’s 
Building 
Trades 
Union—that is all the unions that build 
things. The Laborers’ International, 
LIUNA—that is the largest construc-
tion trade union in the country. The 
Operating Engineers—these guys do ev-
erything. Another trade union: the 
Alaska Teamsters, the Alaska AFL– 
CIO. 
These are the great men and women 
who built this country and built the 
middle class of America. I have the ut-
most respect for them, and, indeed, my 
family is part of this labor union herit-
age. My great-grandfather was one of 
the cofounders of the International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. 
That is a source of pride in my family. 
But here is the question: Why are 
they all strongly supporting my resolu-
tion to rescind the Biden NEPA regula-
tions? It is a simple answer: because 
they know that these are job-killing 
regs. They know that these are the 
types of regs in America that delay or 
indefinitely stop the building of infra-
structure in our country, and their 
members are the ones who suffer the 
most. And the dignity of the work—the 
dignity of work that we all say we care 
about—also suffers. 
Don’t take my word for it. Here is 
what some of the leaders of these orga-
nizations have said—and they are great 
Americans. Let me begin with Terry 
O’Sullivan, the head of the Laborers’ 
International. This was his letter to 
the Biden White House when they were 
contemplating this rule in April. Just 
take a look. He said: 
The rollback of updates to NEPA rein-
states burdensome requirements that will 
cause excessive permit delays and allow 
project adversaries— 
Far-left environmental groups— 
to use frivolous lawsuits— 
Which they always do— 
to disrupt or upend long overdue construc-
tion. Once again, communities in need of 
vital infrastructure and the hard-working 
men and women who build America will be 
waiting as project details are subjected to 
onerous reviews. 
That was Terry O’Sullivan saying: 
Don’t issue the rule. 
They ignored him. They ignored him 
because they chose the interests of the 
far-left environmentalists. 
Here is James Callahan writing in 
support of today’s resolution. He is the 
head of the Operating Engineers. You 
want to talk about great unions— 
LIUNA, 
Operating 
Engineers—these 
are men and women who build things. 
This is an incredible statement, and he 
nails it. This guy really knows what he 
is talking about. 
Since its modest beginnings, NEPA has 
evolved into a massive edifice, capable of de-
stroying project after project, job after job, 
in virtually every sector of the economy. 
Dilatory strategies employed by the project 
opponents— 
Far-left environmental groups— 
frequently 
exploit 
provisions 
in 
NEPA, 
weighing down projects, frustrating commu-
nities, and raising costs to the point that 
many applicants, whether public or private, 
simply walk away. 
And when they walk away, it kills 
jobs. That is from James Callahan’s 
letter, 1 of the 50 groups that is sup-
porting this resolution. 
The men and women who build our 
Nation support my resolution, like so 
many groups. 
So who is opposed? Well, it is pretty 
simple. It is pretty obvious. It is the 
usual groups of far-left, coastal-elite 
environmental groups that I see every 
day in Alaska trying to crush jobs and 
stop infrastructure and put people out 
of work. 
I will just give you few. You know, 
they are the usual suspects: Center for 
Biological 
Diversity, 
Earthjustice, 
CODEPINK—I am not sure why they 
jumped in on this—Friends of the 
Earth. 
By the way, if you are watching this 
speech, go take a look at some of those 
websites and see what they stand for. 
So that is who is opposed. 
One more point that I think is impor-
tant to raise. To be honest, there is 
something else going on here. Not only 
is there always opposition by those 
groups to building anything in Amer-
ica—including my resolution—regard-
less of how many pink slips result from 
the actions of these groups to shut 
down things, there is sometimes a sub-
tle and not so subtle condescension 
looking down on the Americans who 
build things. Workers can feel it. Work-
ers can sense it. 
No one epitomizes this condescending 
elitist attitude toward American work-
ers more than this guy. You might re-
member that last year, around this 
time, he was asked if the Biden admin-
istration’s Green New Deal policies 
would put American coal and natural 
gas workers out of work and end their 
livelihoods. John Kerry responded: 
What President Biden wants to do is make 
sure that those folks— 
Men and women who build stuff, coal 
miners, natural gas workers— 
have better choices— 
Better choices— 
That they can be the people who go to 
work to make solar panels. 
Sure, ‘‘better choices,’’ from a guy 
who flies in a jet, owned a 76-foot 
yacht, several mansions, and has the 
carbon footprint of a small nation. Yet 
he tells American energy workers to go 
make solar panels, when the Biden ad-
ministration’s regulations are killing 
their jobs. 
I will end with this, back to the 
workers: When you are voting today, 
keep the heritage of these men and 
women in mind. The Biden NEPA rule 
that we are trying to rescind today will 
kill jobs. I am sure it has already 
killed jobs. That is why we need to re-
scind it. 
This should be an easy vote for all of 
my Senate colleagues today. If you 
really care about permitting reform, so 
we can get back to building things in 
America, you should vote yes. If you 
really put the interests of working men 
and women like these incredible Amer-
icans over those of elite far-left envi-
ronmental groups, you should vote yes. 
And if you truly support the men and 
women who build this country, feed 
this country, and grow this country, 
you should vote yes. 
I yield the floor. 
I ask for the yeas and nays on this 
resolution. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, before 
you do that, I would ask to be recog-
nized for 3 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank 
my colleague for not objecting. 
Let’s just stop for a moment before 
we vote. The National Environmental 
Policy Act was not signed into law by 
FDR, not signed into law by Lyndon 
Johnson or John Kennedy, not signed 
into law by Barack Obama. It was 
signed into law by Richard Nixon, with 
bipartisan support—strong bipartisan 
support—some 50 years ago. 
The reason for the law was that they 
wanted—President Nixon and those 
who served in the Congress at the 
time—to make sure that, as we are pro-
posing to build, we will say, large in-
frastructure projects around the coun-
try with Federal support, they wanted 
to make sure that the voices of the 
people whose lives would be affected by 
that would actually be heard. That was 
the idea behind doing this. 
I have been in the Senate about 21, 22 
years and served on the Environment 
and Public Works Committee with Sen-
ator Simpson and others, and am privi-
leged to chair the committee now. And 
about every year or 2, we pass major 
infrastructure legislation, and, a year 
ago, the largest infrastructure bill in 
the history of the country—roads, 
highways, 
bridges, 
water, 
drinking 
water, wastewater, you name it. 
Just last week, we passed, with one 
dissenting vote, the Water Resources 
Development Act legislation to reau-
thorize the Army Corps of Engineers to 
do projects all over America. 
I live in Wilmington, DE. I–95 goes 
right through Wilmington, DE. It cuts 
my city in half. I–95 is being rebuilt for 
about a 5-mile space, from Route 202, 
which goes up into PA, on down to

Route 141—5 miles, right through the 
middle of our major city. It is going to 
be done in, I think, less than 2 years. 
Imagine that: 4 lanes, 6 lanes, all the 
exits, done in 2 years. 
They are talking about not being 
able to get a big project done. We are 
doing big projects in a little State all 
the time. 
The last thing I would say is that our 
colleagues JOE MANCHIN and LISA MUR-
KOWSKI cohosted bipartisan meetings a 
month or 2 ago—6 or 7 or 8 of them—in 
the afternoon to talk about a path for-
ward on reconciliation and infrastruc-
ture legislation, but also to talk about 
permitting and permitting reform. 
Every time we do a major infrastruc-
ture bill, we do permitting reform, and 
we do streamlining. We have done it. 
We did it last year, and we are going to 
do it again with the WRDA legislation 
too. 
Later, sometime this fall, in Sep-
tember, October, we will do permitting 
reform debate and legislation again. 
We can’t do it in the context of rec-
onciliation 
because 
the 
Parliamen-
tarian won’t let us do that. It has to be 
as stand-alone legislation. 
We will have the opportunity to do 
that. People can offer their ideas. We 
will debate them. We will vote them 
up, and we will vote them down. 
I just wanted to add that for the 
record. 
With that, I guess we ought to ask 
for the yeas and nays.

S.J. RES. 55 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
just want to thank my colleagues for 
the vote that just occurred here on the 
floor of the Senate. It was a bipartisan 
victory, 50 to 47, on the Congressional 
Review Act that I had put forward with 
all of my Republican colleagues to re-
scind the onerous, job-killing Biden ad-
ministration rule that came out in 
April that would make it harder to 
build things in America. It would make 
it harder to employ people, especially 
our incredibly productive American 
workers. 
So that just passed. That was a repu-
diation of the Biden White House in a 
bipartisan vote on the Senate floor. 
Here is the thing. Even my Senate 
colleagues—because I was working the 
vote pretty hard down there in the 
well—even my Senate colleagues who 
voted against it, several of them came 
up to me and said: You know what. You 
are right. We have really got to fix 
NEPA. It is killing the country. It is 
killing our ability to do anything. So 
that was an important vote, but a good 
conversation is starting here. 
We have the best workers in the 
world. If we let them build, we can do 
great things again in terms of building 
this country and not let redtape, far- 
left environmental groups, regulations, 
and endless litigation stop us. 
So I also want to thank all the 
groups that supported this resolution. 
I had a bigger sign down on the Sen-
ate floor when I was giving an earlier 
speech, but the groups that were sup-
porting this legislation are very di-
verse. There are over 50 groups of men 
and women who produce things, grow 
things, and build the country. I want to 
thank them for the great support of 
this Congressional Review Act that 
just passed. 
I really want to give a shout-out to 
the building trades, the laborers, the 
operating engineers, and the trade 
unions that are doing such a great job 
building this country who want to 
work. They know these regulations are 
killing workers’ ability to get good 
jobs. 
We have a long way to go to fix the 
broken system of permitting in Amer-
ica and the endless litigation by envi-
ronmental lawyers who want to stop 
everything, but today was an impor-
tant start and an important vote on 
the floor of the Senate, showing Amer-
ica that a bipartisan group of Senators 
will stand up to these far-left groups 
and say: Hey, you know what? We 
gotta build. We need to build. And that 
was the message here. 
We are going to try to move this in 
the House and get it on President 
Biden’s desk. He says he is blue-collar 
Joe. Well, let’s see if he is blue-collar 
Joe when this comes to his desk and he 
would veto or not veto something that 
all the building trades in America sup-
port. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
COLOMBIA 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, I rise 
today to discuss the acute dangers to 
American national security that have 
formed and are deepening across the 
Western Hemisphere. 
These dangers have coalesced be-
cause of the comprehensive and cata-
strophic policies pursued by President 
Biden and his administration. Already, 
nine governments across South Amer-
ica, Central America, and the Carib-
bean are controlled by socialists. All of 
these governments, with only one ex-
ception, are also overtly and ideologi-
cally anti-American. They are com-
mitted to undermining American secu-
rity and to endangering Americans. 
This weekend, on Sunday, Colombia 
will become the 10th government in the 
region controlled by the hard left when 
the country’s new President, Gustavo 
Petro, will take office. I am deeply 
worried that once he does, Colombia 
will also join the ranks of anti-Amer-
ican forces in Latin America. 
Petro is the first openly Marxist to 
be elected President of Colombia. He 
was brought to power by Colombia’s 
leftist fringe, including guerrillas and 
terrorist groups. 
Colombians had rightly and for dec-
ades resisted Marxism and rejected the 
hard left. The first reason for this is 
that Marxists have long been violent 
guerrillas who have wreaked havoc in 
Colombia. The second reason is that 
Colombians are well aware of what has 
happened in other Latin American 
countries that have elected or have 
seen leftists seize power. Cuba and Ven-
ezuela, for example, have endured so-
cialist and communist regimes that 
have tortured, killed, silenced dis-
sidents, have denied freedom and driv-
en countless people into exile, forcing 
many to flee or be murdered. 
People are rightly asking: What hap-
pened? The answer, unfortunately, is as 
straightforward as it is worrying. Joe 
Biden and his policies happened. The 
Biden administration seems ideologi-
cally 
committed 
to 
systematically 
alienating our allies and empowering 
our enemies. In this goal—and perhaps 
only this goal—they have been wildly 
successful. 
Since Joe Biden has been in office, we 
have seen forces for evil in Iran, in Af-
ghanistan, in Russia, in China, in Ven-
ezuela, and in Cuba gain strength while 
our 
friends 
and 
allies 
in 
Israel, 
Ukraine, Hong Kong, and Taiwan have 
felt abandoned and alone. And this pat-
tern has been repeated in the Western 
Hemisphere. 
In Mexico, we are seeing deepening 
civil unrest and the erosion of civil so-
ciety. The breakdown of the rule of law 
across our southern border—a crisis di-
rectly caused by Joe Biden’s policies 
and political decisions—poses acute na-
tional security challenges and dangers 
to the United States. 
Mexican President Lopez Obrador 
seems intent on making these trends 
worse, and when I questioned a Biden 
State Department official on Obrador’s 
targeting of American companies and 
the nationalization of energy in Mex-
ico, he wouldn’t even admit that those 
were bad things. And if he is not will-
ing to admit to the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee that the leftist 
President of Mexico’s targeting of 
American companies and the national-
ization of energy in Mexico are bad 
things, then we can be certain the 
Biden administration is also unwilling 
to convey that to Mexico. 
When we saw Cubans flood the 
streets 
last 
summer, 
yelling 
‘‘Libertad’’ and waving American flags, 
the Biden administration couldn’t even 
bring itself to come out with a strong 
support and statement for the people 
marching in the streets of Cuba. In 
statement after statement, as pro-
testers swept into the streets, adminis-
tration officials failed to unequivocally 
support the protesters and critically 
failed to condemn the brutal thugs 
that the communist regime was send-
ing to assault, brutalize, and silence 
the speech of Cuban citizens seeking 
freedom. 
When it came to Colombia, the Biden 
administration went out of its way to 
undermine and to alienate the pro- 
American government of Colombian 
President Duque. President Biden de-
nied Duque a call for the first 5 months 
of the administration, providing mo-
rale and momentum for Duque’s do-
mestic enemies. Biden did finally call 
Duque at the end of June that year— 
after his helicopter came under attack 
by anti-government terrorists. 
And what was the reward Biden had 
for the terrorists? 
Well, just a few months later, Biden 
removed the FARC, the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia, from the 
list of terrorist organizations. He also 
dismantled terrorism sanctions on in-
dividual FARC members. FARC is an 
organization 
of 
Marxist-Leninist 
narcoterrorists who, for decades, have 
killed, kidnapped, and extorted Colom-
bians and seized and murdered Amer-
ican citizens. 
FARC continues to pose an acute 
threat to Colombian security and to 
American interests in the region, but 
the Biden administration has treated it 
like other terrorist groups, with weak-
ness and appeasement and worse. Just 
last 
week, 
House 
Republicans 
an-
nounced that the administration may 
well 
be 
distributing 
assistance 
to 
former FARC terrorists. So the inevi-
table occurred; the Colombian far left

S4015 
August 4, 2022 
gained momentum, and Petro was 
elected. 
This is what happens—this is what 
always happens—when America aban-
dons our friends. Colombia has been an 
indispensable ally to the United States. 
Our relationship stems back 200 years. 
We have deep economic and security 
ties. We provide Colombia with almost 
a half a billion dollars in aid every sin-
gle year—a testament to the breadth 
and depth of our ties. 
Petro says he will work hand in hand 
with Nicolas Maduro’s oppressive re-
gime in Venezuela. He is looking to 
work with the National Liberation 
Army, a terrorist organization in Co-
lombia. He will embrace the FARC. He 
says he wants to stop oil production 
and to roll back cooperation with the 
United States on stopping drug traf-
ficking. In fact, Petro seems deeply 
committed to weakening and under-
mining the United States-Colombian 
relationship. 
I hope and pray that he doesn’t weak-
en it. I hope and pray that his rhetoric 
and language in the past is not carried 
forward in policies when his adminis-
tration begins. I want to see Colombia 
remain a close U.S. ally. I don’t want 
to see Colombia follow the example of 
other socialist governments in the 
Western Hemisphere. We know where 
that leads. 
Both Cuba and Venezuela used to be 
prosperous 
countries 
until 
leftists 
came to power. Venezuela, in 1950, was 
the fourth wealthiest country on the 
face of the Earth. The United States 
was first. Switzerland was second. New 
Zealand was third. Venezuela was No. 
4. Then socialist dictators came to 
power, including Hugo Chavez and 
Nicolas Maduro, and they destroyed 
much of that mighty nation. The qual-
ity of life deteriorated so much in Ven-
ezuela that people are literally eating 
out of trash cans in alleyways as they 
flee the country by the millions. 
In Cuba, when Fulgencio Batista 
staged a coup and became a brutal dic-
tator in the 1950s, my father was a 
teenager 
in 
Cuba, 
and 
he 
fought 
against Batista’s cruel regime. My fa-
ther was imprisoned and tortured. He 
was beaten in a Cuban jail. He had his 
nose broken. He had his teeth broken 
out of his mouth. My father fled Cuba 
in 1957. He came to America—he came 
to Texas—seeking freedom. He had $100 
in his underwear. He didn’t speak 
English. He washed dishes while mak-
ing 50 cents an hour. 
In 1959, Castro and the communist 
revolution succeeded there. Shortly 
thereafter, my father returned to Cuba 
only to be horrified at the evil and op-
pression that Castro had brought—at 
the murder, at the torture, at the suf-
fering, at the poverty. My aunt, my Tia 
Sonia—his kid sister—was still in 
Cuba. My Tia Sonia fought in the coun-
terrevolution against Castro, and my 
Tia Sonia was imprisoned and tortured 
by Castro’s thugs. 
This is the future that may well be 
awaiting Latin American countries 
that embrace socialism. This is the 
pattern we have seen over and over and 
over again. Petro was elected, but if he 
follows the pattern of other leftist dic-
tators, it may prove to be the last free 
election in Colombia. 
So how has the Biden administration 
handled Petro’s rise to power, which 
their own weakness and their own ap-
peasement facilitated? With yet more 
weakness and appeasement. 
Both Joe Biden and Secretary of 
State Blinken effusively congratulated 
Petro: How great, an anti-American 
Marxist and a close ally of ours in 
Latin America. 
They said they looked forward to 
working with him on shared interests. 
I hope those shared interests don’t in-
clude undermining the United States of 
America. 
There is value in clarity. There is 
value in telling the truth about what 
socialism does to a country from the 
bully pulpit of the United States. 
If the Biden administration won’t 
support American allies, if they will 
actively undermine American allies 
like they did the pro-American govern-
ment of President Duque’s, and if the 
President won’t check our adversaries 
and stand up to our enemies, then Con-
gress must. 
Last month, I introduced legislation 
that would reimpose terrorism sanc-
tions on the FARC and on FARC-re-
lated 
terrorists. 
Those 
sanctions 
should never have been removed, and 
doing so highlighted the lack of respect 
and support for our friends and allies in 
Colombia. Mere months before the Co-
lombian election, Joe Biden’s delisting 
of the FARC contributed to the elec-
tion of an anti-American Marxist. My 
bill is a commonsense first step to re-
storing America’s policy toward Co-
lombia. The Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee voted on my bill, and, 
sadly, every Senate Democrat voted 
no. 
However, much of the damage has al-
ready been done, and this weekend, 
Petro will take office. American pol-
icy, I believe, must be recalibrated to 
acknowledge that reality. Again, I 
hope and pray that Petro does not lead 
his country into the camp of anti- 
American socialists who have become 
ascendent during the Biden administra-
tion, but we would be reckless and 
maybe even delusional not to take him 
at his word because that is what he has 
said he intends to do. 
So I will shortly be introducing an-
other bill—the CAUTION Act—the Co-
lombia Assistance Used Transparently 
by Institutionalizing Oversight Now. 
This bill will comprehensively condi-
tion all of our aid to Colombia based on 
what path Petro will choose. If he cuts 
back defense coordination with the 
United States, my bill will ensure that 
he gets no more money for security co-
ordination. If he cuts back cooperation 
on drug trafficking, my bill will ensure 
he gets no more money for counter-
narcotics. If he refuses to help dampen 
illegal immigration, my bill will en-
sure he gets no more money for devel-
opment assistance. 
I am not interested in giving anti- 
American leftists American tax dollars 
as aid. I believe our foreign policy 
should use carrots and sticks in order 
to incentivize other countries to be-
have in a way that benefits American 
interests and strengthens our friend-
ships and in a way that discourages 
countries from seeking to harm and 
undermine the United States of Amer-
ica. 
This is an inflection point, and Amer-
ica must be clear: We don’t support 
Marxists in Latin America. Any leftist 
leader who chooses socialism will be 
held accountable by the United States 
and, at a minimum, will no longer be 
funded by the U.S. taxpayers to under-
mine our great Nation. 
I hope this bill earns bipartisan sup-
port because standing up for the inter-
ests of America and standing up to 
save 
the 
United 
States-Colombian 
friendship and alliance is a national in-
terest that transcends partisan lines. If 
President Biden won’t stand up for 
America, then I hope and pray that the 
Congress will. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 2022 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, as 
cochair of the Senate Recycling Cau-
cus, I am all for efforts to reuse mate-
rial in a manner that gives it a second 
life unless we are talking about recy-
cling bad ideas. The reckless tax-and- 
spend plan the White House and the 
majority are threatening to bring forth 
once again is a terrible idea to revive. 
The Senate wasted almost all of 2021 
chasing this apparition. Now here we 
are, over a year later, and our eco-
nomic situation is much more dire. In-
flation is over 9 percent—the highest in 
more than four decades. Many econo-
mists predict we are headed for a reces-
sion by next year. There are indica-
tions that we are already there. Ameri-
cans feel this daily as prices at the 
pump and the grocery store eat away 
at disposable income and as home price 
affordability becomes a thing of the 
past. 
According to a CNN poll last month, 
64 percent of Americans feel the econ-
omy is currently in a recession, but 
President Biden and allies of his think 
that raising taxes, eliminating jobs, 
and spending billions more will some-
how help. Their wild claim that all of 
this spending will reduce inflation was 
almost immediately debunked by the 
Penn Wharton Budget Model, which 
found that, if enacted, the bill will 
have no measurable impact on infla-
tion. 
Americans are struggling with high 
prices at every turn. Yet the majority 
wants them to pay billions for Green 
New Deal programs that could exacer-
bate energy security and food security 
concerns while using fuzzy math to sell 
it as fighting inflation. 
Their message to Americans is, We 
are sorry you are paying so much for

every necessity you need, but we really 
have to plant some trees in Brooklyn. 
That is right. Tree equity—a Green 
New Deal program resurrected for this 
bill—is the majority’s secret weapon to 
fight inflation. 
As the lead Republican on the Senate 
Ag Committee, I can attest to how our 
section of the bill is chock-full of mis-
placed priorities like this, but worse 
than that, when it comes to agri-
culture policy, this bill sets a particu-
larly bad precedent for farm bill pro-
grams. If they go down this road, we 
very well might be looking at rec-
onciliation as the only way future farm 
bills are actually written. Whoever 
holds the pen wields the fate for vital 
programs that farmers, ranchers, and 
foresters depend on, not to mention nu-
trition programs that help low-income 
families and policies that allow con-
servationists to achieve our shared 
goals. 
We haven’t had a single hearing on 
this bill. Yet its agriculture title 
spends $40 billion—a huge amount allo-
cated, with no input from stakeholders, 
Republicans, and, quite frankly, most 
Democrats. 
The majority is extending conserva-
tion programs until 2031—well beyond 
the life of the next two farm bills, de-
liberately taking away Congress’s abil-
ity to change the focus of these pro-
grams or how they operate. 
The bill unilaterally creates a multi-
billion-dollar slush fund for farm bill 
priorities shared by the President and 
his allies. That is a terrible idea for 
any legislation, much less a bill that is 
historically written in a very bipar-
tisan fashion. 
The current farm bill passed this 
Chamber with a record number of 
‘‘yes’’ votes on the floor. My goal, as 
current ranking member, is to top 
that. To say this reckless bill jeopard-
izes the chances of that would be an 
understatement. We have never written 
a farm bill in this manner. It is anti-
thetical to how the Senate—and the Ag 
Committee, in particular—should oper-
ate. We have a storied history of work-
ing together on the Agriculture Com-
mittee. Our stakeholders value the fact 
that we approach the issues they face 
together rather than as Republicans 
and Democrats. They appreciate that 
their voices are heard. 
Unfortunately, with this decision, 
the majority has changed that dy-
namic. In their zeal to pass their reck-
less tax-and-spend agenda, they have 
undermined one of the last successful 
bipartisan processes remaining in the 
Senate. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, 
while we haven’t yet seen any bill text 
for this reckless tax-and-spending bill, 
we have seen or we have heard an out-
line of it, some chatter about it, 
snippets about it—about what is in this 
reconciliation bill. So, Madam Presi-
dent, let me state the obvious: Billions 
of dollars in reckless spending and 
major tax hikes—they will not solve 
the economic crisis our Nation finds 
itself in. Yet, somehow, this concoction 
of truly terrible economic policies is 
exactly what my colleagues on the 
Democratic side are pursuing. 
Let’s start with the tax hikes. In the 
Schumer-Manchin bill, they have pro-
posed imposing a corporate minimum 
tax on those big, bad corporations. 
Well, 50 percent of this change would 
be borne by the manufacturing indus-
try—an industry that both Republicans 
and Democrats have been trying to 
grow. We have been trying to grow 
that, not harm it with bad policies. 
Manufacturers are already struggling 
to navigate inflation and supply chain 
crisis, but this bill will punish manu-
facturers, and there is no question that 
this would hurt the middle class by 
raising prices and lowering wages. At a 
time of historic inflation, manufactur-
ers will have no choice but to pass on 
higher prices to the consumer. 
That is just one part of it. Democrats 
say the rich should pay their fair 
share. OK, let’s look at that. 
A nonpartisan analysis of the entire 
bill found that it would cause a $16.7 
billion tax increase for American tax-
payers earning less than $200,000 in 
2023. President Biden is going back on 
his promise and raising taxes for those 
earning less than $400,000, and he is 
doing this during a recession. 
What about the claim that this pro-
posal will address inflation? The Penn- 
Wharton Budget Model, which Senator 
MANCHIN frequently cites for producing 
the best economic analysis, found the 
proposal produces no meaningful reduc-
tion in the deficit or with inflation. 
Any suggestion otherwise is insulting 
to the intelligence of the American 
people. 
OK, now let’s look at the spending. 
Why, during a time of significant eco-
nomic hardship, should the American 
people be on the hook to fund $369 bil-
lion in incentives to the Green New 
Deal businesses to promote those en-
ergy policies? Can anyone in this 
Chamber argue with a straight face 
that subsidizing Tesla purchases will 
help to ease inflation? I can tell you it 
certainly will not help working fami-
lies. 
Then there is the $80 billion for the 
IRS, which is six times the Agency’s 
current annual budget. Our folks on 
the other side of the aisle are once 
again trying to hire an armada of new 
IRS agents—87,000, to be exact. This 
would unleash a wave of new audits. 
Half of those new audits would hit 
Americans making $75,000 or less. 
You know, we have been here before. 
The public does not want this deal. The 
bottom line: It is clear this economy is 
not working for the American people. 
The Biden administration’s policies 
have saddled this country with two 
consecutive months of negative eco-
nomic growth—which is the definition 
of a recession—9.1 percent inflation, a 
negative 3.6 inflation-adjusted decline 
in pay for workers, and more Ameri-
cans than ever before are now holding 
two full-time jobs. 
In the face of all this hardship, we 
need real solutions, not more of the 
same backward spending policies. 
The cute name that Senators SCHU-
MER and MANCHIN have come up with 
for their proposal should not hide these 
facts. And the facts are massive tax 
hikes and billions of dollars in reckless 
government spending. That is the last 
thing our country needs right now. 
So why are we even debating such a 
terrible bill? A short history lesson 
may offer some answers. People may 
recall something called the Cornhusker 
Kickback—an agreement in 2009 be-
tween my predecessor and Senator 
Harry Reid. In exchange for a special 
carve-out only for Nebraska to reduce 
the costs of enacting ObamaCare in our 
State, my predecessor agreed to vote 
for ObamaCare. Well, the kickback, 
once public, it angered and it embar-
rassed Nebraskans. 
History often repeats itself, and from 
what I am hearing, it seems as though 
we have a new kickback—the Moun-
taineer kickback, a deal only for West 
Virginia; tax hikes and reckless spend-
ing that all of us will have to bear in 
exchange for a pipeline. 
I will close by saying again, this is 
not an inflation reduction bill. Like a 
bad Hollywood franchise that just 
won’t die, this is simply the third in-
stallment in the ‘‘Build Back Broke’’ 
trilogy. I hope it does as poorly in the 
box office as the first two. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I 
am pleased to join my colleagues in 
talking about the tax-and-spend bill 
that is being put forward by our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle. 
I rise today to discuss the harmful 
economic consequences that this tax- 
and-spend bill will have on American 
families. 
Americans are facing soaring infla-
tion that we haven’t seen in genera-
tions. In June, the Consumer Price 
Index was up 9.1 percent from a year 
earlier. The price increases families are 
seeing at the grocery store, at the gas 
pump, and for basic housing needs have 
far outpaced wage gains and left Amer-
icans struggling to make ends meet. 
The news last week that our GDP 
shrank for a second consecutive quar-
ter is only further evidence of this ad-
ministration’s failed economic policies. 
Now, my colleagues across the aisle 
are doubling down on their failed ap-
proach, proposing to increase taxes on 
nearly 
every 
single 
hard-working 
American by $750 billion and spending 
nearly $370 billion on a Green New Deal 
policy. 
And, again, don’t just take my word 
for it. Analysis by the Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation shows this bill will 
increase taxes on millions of Ameri-
cans across every income bracket, with 
more than half of the tax increase im-
pacting Americans making less than 
$400,000 a year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4017 
August 4, 2022 
Next year alone, the bill will increase 
taxes by $16.7 billion on American tax-
payers earning less than $200,000—a 
clear violation of President Biden’s 
promise to not increase taxes on Amer-
icans earning less than $400,000 a year. 
Further, the Joint Tax analysis also 
shows that the corporate tax increases 
in this bill would overwhelmingly hurt 
U.S. manufacturers—U.S. manufactur-
ers—with nearly 50 percent of the cor-
porate tax increase hitting the manu-
facturing industry. 
Manufacturers are already struggling 
with inflation, supply chain disrup-
tions, and an impending recession. This 
tax increase would undermine U.S. 
manufacturing investment in critical 
research 
and 
development 
and 
in 
emerging technologies. And it will also 
result in higher costs for American 
families. 
Think about that young couple start-
ing out. They have to buy a refrig-
erator, a couch, furniture—all of these 
different things. They are going to pay 
higher prices. I mean, that tax is going 
to impact them on the manufactured 
goods they need, regardless of their in-
come or their ability to pay. That is in-
creasing inflation in this country. And 
inflation is the cruelest tax because it 
hits low-income people the hardest. 
Not only that, the bill, as I say, will 
actually increase inflation. Analysis by 
economists at Penn Wharton at the 
University of Pennsylvania, the Fed-
eral Reserve, Moody’s Analytics, and 
the CBO all show that it will not re-
duce inflation. 
When you look at things like the tax 
on, not just manufacturing but other 
companies that produce oil and gas, 
here we are fighting with the highest 
prices we have seen at the pump in 
years that people pay every time they 
pull up to fill up their car. And now 
with increased taxes, that is going to 
exacerbate the cost of fuel at the 
pump. It is going to impact the price of 
groceries at the grocery store at a time 
when we are not only fighting inflation 
but we are fighting economic stagna-
tion—stagflation, 
something 
we 
haven’t had in this country since the 
late seventies and the early eighties. 
Economists at the nonprofit Tax 
Foundation projected this bill will re-
duce long-term economic output, re-
duce average wages, and eliminate 
30,000 full-time jobs. Let me repeat 
that. Economists at the nonprofit Tax 
Foundation have projected that this 
legislation will reduce long-run eco-
nomic output, reduce average wages, 
and eliminate 30,000 full-time jobs in 
this country. 
Rather than tightening our fiscal 
belt and reducing spending, Democrats 
are continuing down the same old path 
that has led to record-high inflation 
and our economy on the verge of reces-
sion. 
Increasing taxes and more Federal 
spending will not reduce inflation. It 
will not create jobs. It will not lower 
gas prices, which are still about 60 per-
cent higher than they were just a year 
ago. 
Instead, we should be empowering 
our domestic energy producers, restor-
ing our energy independence, reducing 
our reliance on foreign oil imports, and 
creating more jobs here at home—not 
eliminating 30,000 jobs, creating more 
jobs. Less spending, less taxation, less 
regulation gets this economy growing. 
This bill does just the opposite. 
Democrats are proposing new energy 
taxes and Green New Deal-style sub-
sidies that will only worsen our cur-
rent energy crisis and weaken our Na-
tion’s economic and our energy secu-
rity. And energy security is national 
security. 
As part of the $370 billion in spending 
on Green New Deal subsidies, this bill 
includes: $51 billion to extend and mod-
ify the production tax credit to sub-
sidize the already profitable wind, 
solar, and geothermal industries; $27 
billion to establish a greenhouse gas 
reduction fund to deploy low-carbon 
technologies in disadvantaged commu-
nities; $3 billion for a neighborhood eq-
uity, safety, and affordable transpor-
tation program; $3 billion for environ-
mental 
and 
climate 
justice 
block 
grants. 
Further, the bill includes new taxes 
on natural gas and increased fees and 
royalty rates for oil and gas produced 
on Federal lands, which will only re-
sult in higher costs for American fami-
lies at the pump, at the gas station, or 
their utility bills, and higher prices for 
goods across the board because all of 
those goods have to be transported to 
the grocery store. And now you are 
going to pay higher transportation 
costs, and that is going to be reflected 
in the food prices. So you don’t just see 
it at the pump at the gas station when 
you are filling your car, you see it at 
the grocery store. 
And with this tax on manufacturers, 
you are going to see it on all the manu-
factured goods as well. Low-income 
people are going to be paying those 
higher prices, more inflation. That 
means the tax gets them. 
Gas prices are already $2.25 higher a 
gallon than when President Biden took 
office. Diesel prices are even higher— 
nearly $2.81 per gallon more than in 
January of 2021. 
In short, look, we need to unleash our 
domestic energy production, not ask 
for help from OPEC or Venezuela. We 
need to unleash our oil and gas re-
sources in States like my home State 
or the Presiding Officer’s home State. 
We can produce a lot more oil and gas 
in this country, and we have the best 
environmental standards. 
That is how you bring the price down 
at the pump: more supply, not higher 
taxes; more supply, not taxes that will 
drive prices up and reduce supply when 
we still have increased demand. That is 
why we have the inflation in the first 
place. 
The Biden administration policies 
are creating the inflation and now the 
stagflation, and this legislation will 
make it worse. It is going down the 
same path. 
We need to unleash our domestic en-
ergy production. We need to get our 
debt and deficit under control. We need 
to work on behalf of farmers, ranchers, 
the ag supply chain to continue to 
produce the highest quality and the 
lowest cost food supply in the world. 
We need to unleash our energy re-
sources. 
Those are the things that will in-
crease supply, reduce inflation, and get 
our economy going so we don’t have a 
recession or stagnation. Those are the 
things that benefit all American con-
sumers, all American workers, regard-
less of their income level. This bill 
does none of those things. This bill 
makes the problem worse, and it 
should be rejected. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). The Senator from Ohio. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 6929 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the men 
and women at the company Delphi 
Technologies helped make General Mo-
tors the world’s largest automaker. 
Yet those workers lost the retirement 
they earned through no fault of their 
own when their company went bank-
rupt during the great recession. 
That was a time—some of us were 
here then; Senator CRAPO and I were 
both 
here 
then—when 
Washington 
bailed out Wall Street, the people who 
caused the crisis, but left too many 
Americans like the Delphi retirees— 
again, who did nothing wrong—on their 
own. 
Now, after years of effort by workers 
and retirees in Ohio and in other 
States, it is past time for the U.S. Sen-
ate to do its job to restore full retire-
ment benefits for the thousands of 
Ohioans and tens of thousands nation-
ally of Delphi salaried retirees across 
the country. 
I have been fighting for them and 
urging the Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation to do the right thing since 
2009. I thought we had this problem 
solved years ago when I blocked Presi-
dent Obama’s nominee to head the 
PBGC, Josh Gotbaum. We hoped that 
would signal to the President that we 
were serious: PBGC needed to do the 
right thing for Delphi workers. Unfor-
tunately, Delphi retirees know what 
happened: He got the job anyway; they 
didn’t get the help they needed. 
President Obama didn’t do it. The 
next 
President, 
President 
Trump, 
promised, went to Youngstown, went to 
Dayton, promised he would take care 
of these retirees, and Ohioans voted for 
him. 
Ohioans 
thought 
President 
Trump, this time, would be different, 
that he would do something. Once 
again, American workers were left on 
their own. 
We kept working. These retirees 
never gave up. This year, we reintro-
duced legislation—with Congressman 
RYAN, a Democrat from Ohio; Con-
gressman KILDEE, a Democrat from 
Michigan; Congressman TURNER, a Re-
publican from Ohio—to save these pen-
sions. We named the bill in honor of

August 4, 2022 
Susan Muffley, a Delphi retiree so 
cash-strapped after losing her pension 
that she avoided seeing her doctor, and 
she passed away too early as a result. 
It is a bipartisan bill. We have Sen-
ator PORTMAN and Senator YOUNG on 
board in the Senate, along with 39 Re-
publicans 
who 
joined 
Congressman 
TURNER from Dayton voting for this in 
the House last week. The White House 
supports it as well. The White House 
said: 
By ensuring that those who put in a career 
of hard work will receive the pension bene-
fits they earned, this legislation supports a 
secure retirement for affected workers. 
That is what the White House said. 
So we have Senator PORTMAN and 
Senator YOUNG here. We have 39 House 
Republicans on board. A number of 
Democrats are on board. The President 
of the United States is on board. 
Promises from President Obama and 
President Trump—now is the time. 
These Ohioans and workers across the 
Midwest earned these pensions. It is 
past time to restore them. The Senate 
has that opportunity today. 
I hope my colleagues of both parties 
will join Senator PORTMAN and me. 
I yield the floor to my friend from 
Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague from Ohio, Senator 
BROWN, and I thank him for working 
with us on this bipartisan legislation 
that impacts thousands of retirees in 
our home State of Ohio. 
In the summer of 2009, as the Federal 
Government took General Motors into 
bankruptcy, the Obama administration 
terminated the pension plans covering 
thousands of Delphi workers. While 
union employees were protected, these 
20,000 salaried retirees, ranging from 
shop floor supervisors and salespeople 
to engineers, office managers, were left 
out. They had spent many years work-
ing at Delphi, a major employer and 
economic engine in Dayton, OH, in 
Youngstown, OH, and in Sandusky, OH. 
These people had followed the rules. 
They had earned their pensions the 
American way, through hard work and 
dedication and contribution. But in-
stead of honoring the promises that 
had been made to these salaried, mid-
dle income employees after 30, 40 years 
of service, the administration termi-
nated their pensions. People who had 
worked hard their entire lives and 
played by the rules saw benefits cut by 
as much as 70 percent. It is just not fair 
and no fault of their own, and it has 
devastated some of them, particularly 
those who have healthcare issues in 
their later years, who have not been 
able to lead the standard of living that 
they assumed they would, based on the 
pensions they had. 
So it is about fairness, and it is very 
simple. It ensures that these Delphi re-
tirees receive the retirement benefits 
they were promised. It would reinstate 
their pension plan and restore their 
benefits that were unnecessarily and 
unfairly reduced. 
Some of my colleagues may charac-
terize this as a bailout, but I respect-
fully must correct the record. The Del-
phi pension was over 80 percent funded 
when the Federal Government termi-
nated the pensions in 2009 and took 
over these assets. By the way, it would 
have been fully funded by the next year 
based on all the data we now have 
showing what happened with market 
conditions. So it was 80 percent funded 
when the government stepped in and 
said that it was massively under-
funded, and a year later it would have 
been fully funded. 
Despite this, the government, again, 
treated the pensions as though they 
were underfunded and slashed the bene-
fits. It is simply about keeping our 
promises to these workers. 
There were 20,000 participants. Some 
say: Well, that is not a lot of people. 
Well, to them, it is really important, 
and it is really important to Ohio. 
About a quarter of those 20,000 live in 
our home State of Ohio. 
That is why I am proud to stand with 
them, my colleagues from Ohio, and 
with others here in this body and over 
in the House to ensure that fairness is 
what they get at the end of the day. 
This should not be controversial leg-
islation, in my view. I am pleased to 
say that it has bipartisan support. We 
just saw 36 Republicans support this on 
the House side. I encourage my col-
leagues in the Senate to also support 
these workers, to make them whole 
with this legislation so that we can 
make good on the Federal Govern-
ment’s promise to them. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank 
my friend Senator PORTMAN for our 
work together on this. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of H.R. 6929, which was re-
ceived from the House and is at the 
desk; that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed; and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I appreciate my 
colleagues’ commitment to this issue 
and to their constituents. As you 
know, this legislation has been before 
us for some time now, and there is con-
troversy over it. 
This bill would retroactively rein-
state pension benefits for a small sub-
set of participants whose pensions have 
already been transferred to the Pension 
Benefit 
Guaranty 
Corporation, 
or 
PBGC. That would create a precedent 
that other plans would follow. 
The PBGC exists specifically to cover 
pension benefits if a plan is termi-
nated. So we should let the system 
work. This system does not require 
taxpayer dollars for a bailout or for 
whatever one would like to call it. 
That is part of the reason for the objec-
tion. 
We also have an obligation to be de-
liberate in how we spend taxpayer 
money. Before we inject more money 
into the system, we should explore the 
implications of this bill, which brings 
me to my final point. The Finance 
Committee has not held a hearing—not 
a single hearing, let alone a markup— 
on this bill. The Finance Committee 
exists to examine proposals such as 
this and to provide all Senators an op-
portunity to weigh in. 
I am willing to work with my chair-
man, Senator WYDEN, on this and with 
Senator 
BROWN
and 
with 
Senator 
PORTMAN and other Senators who are 
interested in the issue so we can see if 
there is a need and a way that we can 
address this issue specifically without 
creating a precedent that would deal 
with the rest of the entire system that 
has been put together to address termi-
nated plans. 
Because of the need for us to have 
regular-order deliberation and consid-
eration of this legislation, I must, 
today, object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank 
Senator CRAPO. Senator CRAPO and I 
have worked together on a number of 
things. He was chair of the Banking 
Committee the last 4 years. I was his 
ranking member and worked with him 
and Greg and his staff on a number of 
things. I take him at his word. 
I know that Senator PORTMAN and 
Senator CRAPO and I sit also on the Fi-
nance Committee. And I am serious 
about this. I just had a private con-
versation with Senator CRAPO. He 
seems 
serious. 
I 
know 
Senator 
PORTMAN is. 
We have waited too long. There are 
far too many people. It is not a huge 
number, as Senator PORTMAN said—not 
a huge number of people—but it is aw-
fully important to them. I know what 
it means to a community that is strug-
gling, like the Mahoning Valley and 
the Miami Valley. Those two commu-
nities happen to have hundreds and 
hundreds and hundreds of these retir-
ees. When their pension shrinks like 
this, it affects their buying power, it 
affects their standard of living, and it 
affects the prosperity of the commu-
nity. 
So we will be back together working 
on it. I thank Senator CRAPO. I am dis-
appointed, but I thank him. 
TRIBUTE TO BILL NELL 
Mr. President, I rise today on a 
cheerful duty, if you will, to recognize 
Bill Nell, who retired this month after 
a long career of service, not working in 
the Senate but sort of working around 
the Senate. 
Bill was deputy director of the Con-
gressional Program at the Aspen Insti-
tute, 
something 
not 
particularly 
known to the public. It is a nonprofit 
working to bring together diverse per-
spectives to solve challenges facing the 
United States and the world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4019 
August 4, 2022 
Bill was the second hire when the 
Aspen Institute’s Congressional Pro-
gram began. He is one of the Aspen In-
stitute’s longest serving employees—35 
years at Aspen. 
Almost every week, for as long as I 
can remember, that the Senate and the 
House were in session, Bill brought to-
gether 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
from across the ideological spectrum 
for breakfast and conversations with 
leading public policy scholars. Typi-
cally on a Thursday morning at 8, you 
could come, and there would be 10 or 15 
or 20 House and Senate Members—fair-
ly evenly divided, depending on the 
topic, perhaps, between the parties— 
and a scholar or an activist or someone 
that Bill generally recruited came in 
and talked to us. 
It helped educate us, for sure. It 
brought us together in ways that the 
public 
doesn’t 
necessarily 
see 
but 
helped us discuss issues with each 
other. And we learned in so many ways 
about each other and about these pub-
lic issues. We learned from experts. We 
learned from each other. 
Bill helped host 636 breakfasts— 
someone counted them at Aspen—over 
his career of service. During the hustle 
and bustle of the workweek, these 
Aspen breakfasts were a welcome res-
pite where Members of Congress could 
come to listen and discuss and learn 
from experts, with little partisanship 
involved. But Bill had brought in these 
experts. We learned from them. We 
learned from one another. 
I wish everyone could sit in on those 
breakfasts and see the thoughtfulness 
of so many Members of both parties in 
Congress. It really taught me a lot 
about partisanship and that most of 
my colleagues here—I would not say 
everyone, but most of my colleagues 
here—are here for the right reasons 
and want to do a good job, and the 
thoughtfulness 
exhibited 
in 
those 
meetings was so important. 
Bill was diligent about bringing a 
balanced presentation of topics and ex-
perts at the forefront of their fields. 
These breakfasts helped us to consider 
others’ perspectives and think about 
things we might not have thought 
about otherwise. Sometimes we found 
common ground, an experience or opin-
ion or a priority that our constituents 
share. It is how we got things done. 
Whenever we could find agreement, we 
worked together to accomplish things 
for the people whom we served. 
It brings to mind one of my col-
leagues who is about to retire, ROY 
BLUNT from Missouri. He served with 
me in the House. I knew him, actually, 
even before that. He one time said—and 
he is a conservative Republican, and I 
am decidedly not. He said: 
I have known SHERROD BROWN for 30 years, 
and we have agreed exactly five times. 
Then he laughed, and then he said: 
But all five of those are Federal law. 
And that is what really matters. Sen-
ator CRAPO and I look at the world 
very differently. Senator PORTMAN and 
I look at the world very differently, 
but Senator PORTMAN and I put to-
gether the strongest language ever in 
Federal law on ‘‘Buy American.’’ 
We have done a number of issues like 
that. You may look at things dif-
ferently, but you find things you can 
agree on, and you go to town and make 
it happen. 
So back to Bill. Those who work 
closely with him describe him as one of 
the hardest working people they know, 
and you can see that in these records. 
By virtue of his diligence and his prep-
aration, Bill was able to make his job, 
which was anything but this, appear ef-
fortless. 
His longtime colleague, former Ag 
Secretary, Congressman Dan Glick-
man, recognized Bill as the ‘‘soul of 
Aspen,’’ as a natural leader and a jack- 
of-all-trades. 
His current boss, until his retirement 
last week, former Congressman Charlie 
Dent—Glickman is a Democrat; Dent is 
a Republican—called Bill an anti-pro-
crastinator when I called him on the 
phone to talk about him. It is a title 
rare in a town where ‘‘procrastination’’ 
seems to be everyone’s middle name. 
Bill’s enduring personality is kindness, 
and he was nothing if not kind. He 
brought so many together. He made 
people feel comfortable. He made peo-
ple heard. I have no idea what his ide-
ology or his party was. We didn’t talk 
about that. He just served and helped 
us understand. He seemed to have no 
enemies in doing his job. 
In retirement, Bill is spending time 
back in his beloved Montana, just out-
side of Yellowstone, one of my favorite 
places in the country, where I, years 
ago, took my daughters, as a single 
parent, on a train to see Yellowstone 
for a week. He is spending time in his 
beloved Montana with his beloved wife 
Cindy, a retired public school teacher 
and an education activist. 
The Aspen breakfast will continue. 
Bill will be missed by all of us who 
were blessed by his kindness, his curi-
osity, and his capability. He made this 
place work better. He reminded us of 
the importance of self-government, of 
democracy. It is up to us to uphold 
that legacy, to keep working with each 
other towards a better future for the 
people whom we serve. 
Thank you so much, Bill Nell. We 
wish you the best in retirement. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4394 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as if in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 4394 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration; further, that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, I am very 
concerned that this bill would overrule 
FDA experts and do so without even 
going through regular order. We should 
be setting a very high bar for doing 
anything like this. 
I do appreciate my colleague’s con-
cern that he is bringing to the floor 
today for growers in his State. Green-
ing disease is a serious and alarming 
environmental issue. But skipping reg-
ular order here today to override 
FDA’s experts and meddle with its 
longstanding process for modifying 
food standards of identity does not get 
to the root of the problem. So, today, I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I regret 
that that is the case. I understand the 
argument and if I could explain a little 
further. 
Florida is identified with the citrus 
industry. People have long understood 
it. It is a big part of our State. Here is 
the best way to describe this to people. 
About 60 years ago, the FDA created a 
standard for what they consider pas-
teurized orange juice. For orange juice 
to be marked with a stamp that says 
‘‘pasteurized,’’ no less than 10.5 percent 
of the weight of the juice has to be ac-
counted for by soluble solids, such as 
naturally occurring sugar. So this is 
just an arbitrary number. 
By the way, the 10.5 percent of the 
weight has nothing to with the nutri-
tion. It has nothing to with the safety. 
It has nothing to with the quality. 
They had to come up with a number 
to define the difference between orange 
juice and something that is not orange 
juice, and that was the number they 
came up with. 
So for decades, the citrus industry in 
Florida has been following that speci-
fication, and it hasn’t been a problem. 
Then Florida was impacted by this 
thing called citrus greening, pests that 
came from Asia, particularly from 
China. What it has done is it has rav-
aged the trees. It ravaged the trees to 
the point where one of the impacts it 
has is that now the sugar content—you 
wouldn’t notice it if you drink it or if 
you eat one, but the sugar content of 
the fruit that is now on the trees, be-
cause of the greening, often falls under 
the 10.5. Again, no one would know. It 
is not any less safe. It is not any less 
nutritious. It just falls under that 
number. Then, obviously, the hurricane 
we had in 2017 made those problems 
even worse when they suffered the loss 
of a bunch of trees. 
So now, to meet this arbitrary 10.5 
percent threshold, the juice processors 
in Florida now have to blend in oranges 
and orange juice that have higher 
sugar content, and they usually have 
to import it from a foreign source. 
Again, there is no health benefit to 
doing that. In fact, you could probably 
argue that less sugar is probably bet-
ter. You wouldn’t taste the difference.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4020 
August 4, 2022 
You wouldn’t know it. If I put two 
glasses of orange juice in front of you— 
one with the number they are asking 
for, which is 10 percent, and the other 
one with 10.5—you wouldn’t notice the 
difference. 
So they have been asking the FDA to 
change the standard so they don’t have 
to import a bunch of oranges from 
Brazil and mix it just to be able to hit 
the sugar content. If they can’t do it, 
the only thing that changes is that the 
final product can’t be marketed as 
‘‘Florida orange juice.’’ That is really 
the challenge we are facing. 
We would love for this to go through 
the normal process. The problem is, by 
the time the FDA makes a decision on 
it, there may not be any growers left. 
Let me explain why that is a problem. 
These citrus growers sit on valuable 
land. Every developer in the State is 
trying to get their hands on that land. 
They would love to develop it into a 
mall, into an industrial park. We are 
facing 
those 
problems 
everywhere. 
Once you turn farmland into a com-
mercial use, industrial use, a housing 
development, you never get it back. I 
have seen farms turned into commer-
cial development; I have never seen a 
commercial development be turned 
back into a farm. 
Once we lose this land, we lose it for-
ever. We lose it forever. So not only is 
it important to have it from a food se-
curity standpoint but from an environ-
mental standpoint. Having something 
remain in agriculture, where the people 
who own it care deeply about the qual-
ity of the land and the water usage be-
cause it is key to their existence, is a 
better use of the land than turning it 
into an industrial park. 
But, eventually, these agriculture 
owners will have to do something. 
Some have been in the business for 
generations, but at some point, they 
cannot grow enough food to justify 
continuing in business. They have peo-
ple offering millions and millions of 
dollars to buy their land from them. 
So this simple bill that I filed would 
provide certainty to the orange grow-
ers. By lowering the 10.5 content to 
10.0—that is all it does, from 10.5 to 
10.0—they will have some level of cer-
tainty that they will be able to con-
tinue in business. 
I regret that there is an objection 
here today. I understand the desire to 
follow the FDA process, but I just want 
to be clear. No one is arguing—who 
knows about this—that going from 10.5 
to 10.0 has any safety issue or anything 
of that nature. It is literally an 
undetectable difference, but it would 
make a big difference for the citrus 
growers of Florida. 
If we are not going to do it this way, 
I hope we can get a hearing and get 
this passed. I am not sure if a couple of 
years from now, we are going to have a 
citrus industry. If we lose them or lose 
that land, we will never get it back. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4469 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, across 
this country, Americans are facing ag-
gressive attacks on their reproductive 
freedom. An extremist Supreme Court 
and radical rightwing politicians have 
made clear that they see women as sec-
ond-class citizens and that govern-
ment—government; not the person who 
is pregnant but government—should be 
making decisions about whether or not 
to carry a pregnancy to term. 
In this extraordinary moment, we 
must do everything we can to ensure 
that patients get the healthcare and 
reproductive services they need. That 
includes protecting patients from the 
deceptive practices of some so-called 
crisis pregnancy centers, or CPCs. 
Nationwide, 
there 
are 
over 
2,500 
known CPCs, although some claim that 
number is closer to about 4,000. Before 
Roe was overturned, over 16 million 
women of reproductive age lived closer 
to a crisis pregnancy center than to an 
abortion clinic. Now, some estimate 
that as many as 34 million women do. 
Today in Massachusetts, CPCs out-
number true abortion clinics by about 
3 to 1. 
CPCs often lure women seeking le-
gitimate reproductive care, including 
abortions, into their facilities by ad-
vertising themselves as comprehensive 
reproductive healthcare providers, but 
this is flatly untrue. Many of these 
CPCs are not healthcare providers, and 
they often operate specifically to de-
ceive pregnant women, with the goal of 
preventing them from having abor-
tions. 
CPC websites often feature images of 
people in white lab coats and promises 
of services like ultrasounds or STD 
tests. Yet CPCs rarely employ licensed 
physicians or offer a full range of re-
productive health services. According 
to one study, 84 percent of CPCs had no 
physician and 75 percent had no reg-
istered nurse even affiliated with the 
staff. In fact, of the staff that did have 
some medical training, most work part 
time or as volunteers. As for the serv-
ices they provide, the same study found 
that only 1 out of 607 crisis pregnancy 
centers provided contraceptive care 
and 95 percent of CPC offered no pre-
natal care—none, zero. Most have no 
doctors, no nurses, and offer no med-
ical care, but they sure have a lot of 
medical opinions. Nearly two-thirds 
promoted medically unsound claims, 
such as offering information about 
unproven and unscientific abortion pill 
reversal treatments. 
Deception is at the heart of the oper-
ation for many CPCs. The director of a 
crisis pregnancy center in Texas ex-
plained to the Washington Post how 
she revamped operations so her center 
could pull in more people who were 
seeking an abortion. The director paid 
thousands of dollars to ensure that 
searches for phrases like ‘‘need an 
abortion’’ would lead people to her cen-
ter, and she filled the website with 
phrases like ‘‘I want an abortion’’ and 
promised 
‘‘CONFIDENTIAL 
ABOR-
TION CONSULTATION—NO COST TO 
YOU.’’ The website is so deceptive that 
the director said she even receives 
angry calls from anti-abortion advo-
cates who want to know why her center 
even talks about abortion, to which she 
replies: ‘‘How else do you get an abor-
tion-minded girl to know that you are 
there?’’ 
Deception is wrong. No one should be 
deceived directly or indirectly about 
the services they can access or the 
risks of receiving care. That is particu-
larly true for someone under great 
stress and time constraints who is cop-
ing with an unplanned pregnancy. 
That is why I am glad to introduce 
the Stop Anti-Abortion Disinformation 
Act with Senator MENENDEZ and why I 
am joining him today in calling up this 
legislation for a vote. Our bill directs 
the Federal Trade Commission to pro-
hibit deceptive or misleading adver-
tising related to the provision of abor-
tion services. It also empowers the 
Commission to enforce these rules and 
collect penalties from organizations 
that violate the law. This is far from a 
radical proposal. For more than 100 
years, the FTC has been authorized to 
prosecute entities that use deceptive 
practices. 
And let me be clear. Any crisis preg-
nancy center that operates fairly, dis-
seminates factual information, and is 
clear about what services it does and 
does not provide would be free to con-
tinue its work. 
This bill is not about preventing par-
ents from receiving diapers or other 
supplies if they have chosen to con-
tinue a pregnancy. This is about orga-
nizations 
that 
deliberately 
deceive 
women and girls who are seeking help 
to terminate a pregnancy. Unfortu-
nately, deception is at the heart of the 
typical CPC’s business model. 
As the director of a CPC explained, 
the deception begins when women 
search for an abortion provider. The 
deception then continues once women 
walk through the doors of a crisis preg-
nancy center. 
I just want to tell you a bit about the 
experience of a young woman living in 
Massachusetts who visited a crisis 
pregnancy center earlier this year. 
After finding the facility, which prom-
ised a ‘‘free abortion consultation,’’ 
this woman was asked to fill out forms 
to disclose personal information. She 
was repeatedly lied to about how far 
along she was in her pregnancy. She 
was told falsely that terminating her 
pregnancy would increase her risk of 
breast cancer and depression and that 
an abortion could mean that she could 
never become pregnant in the future. 
Sadly, her experience is not unique. 
Here is the kicker. Women and girls 
visiting CPCs, like this young woman, 
often fill out forms and answer ques-
tionnaires requesting both personal 
identification and personal health in-
formation, which women provide be-
cause they believe they are in a med-
ical facility that will protect their pri-
vacy. 
But 
because 
CPCs 
are

healthcare 
providers, 
these 
women 
have no legal protection, and these 
centers have no legal obligation to pro-
tect those data. These unlicensed fa-
cilities are not subject to Federal pri-
vacy laws like the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act, or 
HIPAA. This means that crisis preg-
nancy centers could pass along private 
information about who was seeking an 
abortion, where that person lives, and 
so on—information that, in the wake of 
the Dobbs decision, is particularly dan-
gerous. 
The 
evidence 
of 
abuse 
is 
over-
whelming. It is time to crack down on 
deceptive 
and 
misleading 
practices 
that many crisis pregnancy centers 
employ because the last thing that a 
woman 
seeking 
reproductive 
care 
should have to worry about is whether 
she is being tricked, lied to, or de-
ceived about the medical care she 
seeks. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
want to thank my colleague Senator 
WARREN for beginning this debate, and 
we will move to a consent shortly. I 
want to thank her for working to-
gether with me on this most important 
issue. 
At this moment, there are millions of 
women who face an uncertain future 
after the repeal of Roe v. Wade, mil-
lions of women who no longer have the 
right to make their own decisions 
about their own bodies. It is a heart- 
wrenching choice, no doubt one of the 
hardest decisions anyone will ever have 
to make. 
But in the midst of this, in this post- 
Roe landscape we find ourselves in, 
there are organizations, as has been 
discussed here, known as crisis preg-
nancy centers that are preying on the 
fears of women, exacerbating the prob-
lems caused by the Dobbs decision. 
Make no mistake, crisis pregnancy 
centers are anti-abortion organizations 
that cloak themselves in benign lan-
guage about ‘‘providing answers’’ and 
‘‘offering advice.’’ 
They have an agenda; namely, to 
steer 
women 
away 
from 
abortion 
through a combination of guilt, con-
cealment, harassment, and downright 
lies. 
Crisis pregnancy centers in my State 
of New Jersey pretend that they are 
there to educate, support, and empower 
women facing unplanned pregnancies. 
And 
yet 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
their 
websites, in very small print, you will 
find a disclaimer that lays it all bare. 
Crisis pregnancy centers do not offer or 
refer for pregnancy terminations or birth 
control. Information should not be relied on 
as a substitute for professional and/or med-
ical advice. 
That is a disclaimer. You can hardly 
read it, but it is there. This is pulled 
straight from the web page of one cen-
ter in my State. I will repeat that end-
ing again. 
Information should not be relied on as a 
substitute for professional and/or medical 
advice. 
Ironically, this is the only objective 
and accurate piece of information you 
will find on the site and others like it. 
As Senator WARREN mentioned, crisis 
pregnancy centers are not required to 
have a physician or a registered nurse 
on staff. Very few of them do. 
They are not required to provide con-
traceptive care or even stick to medi-
cally sound claims. And because they 
claim to only provide so-called edu-
cation services, they can promote bla-
tant lies about how abortion increases 
risk for breast cancer. 
Women in America do not deserve to 
be lied to. They shouldn’t be preyed 
upon during moments of vulnerability 
or any other time. When assessing 
healthcare, they shouldn’t have to 
shift to what is real and what is not. 
And they certainly shouldn’t have to 
parse 
through 
the 
carefully 
con-
structed language of crisis pregnancy 
centers that promote an anti-choice 
agenda. 
Our bill, the Stop Anti-Abortion 
Disinformation Act, would empower 
the Federal Trade Commission to issue 
rules prohibiting false advertisement 
of abortion services. It would allow the 
FTC to penalize those who are found in 
violation. And it would provide greater 
oversight over crisis pregnancy centers 
that profit from the pain of unplanned 
pregnancies—sometimes while double- 
dipping on the taxpayer’s dime. 
Senator WARREN and I are leading 
this bill to end the practice of deceiv-
ing women and girls through false ad-
vertisement. We are leading this bill to 
promote truth in advertisement, to end 
misinformation 
and 
disinformation, 
and to protect women from harass-
ment. Yes—harassment. 
As Senator WARREN said, crisis preg-
nancy centers have no duty to uphold 
HIPAA privacy protections—the most 
significant information that you can 
give about your health and the status 
of your health and your condition. You 
do that thinking that you are in a med-
ical center. And now you have given all 
this information that has enormous 
consequences to it if it is misused to 
these deceptive entities. 
And after divulging personal infor-
mation to them, they can freely sell it 
to scammers who would want to take 
advantage of them. 
So I ask my colleagues, let’s end the 
assault on bodily autonomy and the 
right to access reproductive care. 
Let’s end the barrage of attacks on 
their healthcare. Let’s end deception in 
any delivery of any service. Let’s end 
the fraud in any delivery of any ‘‘serv-
ice.’’ Let’s end the barrage of attacks 
on their healthcare. 
Join us in passing our bill so that in 
the hardest moment of their lives, 
women all across our country can rest 
assured in knowing that what they are 
getting is the truth, not some biased 
agenda pretending to be medical ad-
vice, not some one-sided talking point 
that steers them toward one outcome, 
the truth—the truth. 
Pregnant women in America deserve 
the truth, and that is what this bill 
does. To oppose our unanimous consent 
request is to promote deception, is to 
promote fraud. I don’t think anybody 
really wants to do that. 
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Commerce Com-
mittee be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 4469 and the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation; further, that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise in objection to this bill because it 
is an outrageous attack on life-affirm-
ing pregnancy resource centers. As a 
pro-life obstetrician, I have had the 
pleasure and honor of delivering over 
5,000 babies, and I can attest to the life-
saving, critical, and comprehensive 
care and resources these centers pro-
vide moms in need. 
These pro-life charities not only help 
women in poverty choose life instead of 
abortion, but they also help women 
after babies are born. They also provide 
clothing and diapers and housing as-
sistance and nutrition and sometimes 
just putting an arm around their shoul-
ders and helping them get to their next 
appointment. 
This legislation seeks to shut them 
down all around the country on the 
grounds that they purportedly spread 
disinformation about abortion. 
Under this bill, charities could be 
fined $100,000 or 50 percent of the reve-
nues earned by the ultimate parent en-
tity of the charity for violating the 
act’s prohibition on disinformation re-
lated to abortion. 
Now, I ask you, who would determine 
what 
counts 
as 
prohibited 
disinformation? There is no doubt it 
would be bureaucrats with a pro-abor-
tion agenda. Is this not an infringe-
ment on our First Amendment rights? 
This bill would turn the FTC into a 
national abortion disinformation board 
with an agenda of suppressing speech 
and 
spreading 
pro-abortion 
propa-
ganda. 
Nationally, pro-life pregnancy re-
source centers outnumber abortion fa-
cilities three to one, and that is a good 
thing—that is a great thing—and in 
some States by as many as 11 to 1. 
Knowing that many women choose 
abortion because they feel pressured 
that they have no other option, the 
pro-life movement has placed tremen-
dous resources into these centers, 
which exist to offer alternatives to 
abortion, usually at no cost. 
But right now in America, pregnancy 
resource centers are the ones in need of 
protection as zealous, pro-abortion ter-
rorists have spent the past 2 months 
firebombing and vandalizing pro-life 
pregnancy centers all across the Na-
tion. 
These criminals, these terrorists do 
so not in the name of abortion access

August 4, 2022 
but in retribution for daring to defy 
the ruling abortion regime and for dar-
ing to stand on the side of good in this 
spiritual battle. 
There have been more than 60 preg-
nancy resource centers and offices that 
pro-life groups have attacked and van-
dalized since the draft Supreme Court 
opinion was leaked in May. 
Pro-abortion 
domestic 
terrorists 
have claimed responsibility for these 
crimes. 
Congress should be taking up the leg-
islation instead to affirm, grow, and 
protect pregnancy resource centers and 
praise citizens for their great work, for 
volunteering to help and serve their 
community. 
And Attorney General Merrick Gar-
land should abide by his oath of office 
and prosecute the law. Therefore, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. While my colleague 
is still here, I would like to propound a 
question to him through the Chair. 
Does the First Amendment allow you 
to promote fraud? Does the First 
Amendment allow you to promote de-
ception? Is it great work to lie to 
someone about what you are providing 
them? Is it great work to allow some-
one to get your vital health informa-
tion believing that you are a health 
provider and then being able to use 
that private information? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. To answer my col-
league, the fraud and deception is oc-
curring in the abortion clinics. I could 
tell you story after story of patients 
crying in my office who went to 
Planned Parenthood for a pregnancy 
test and were scheduled for an abor-
tion, coming to my office wondering, 
Do I have to do this abortion? That is 
where the fraud and deception is occur-
ring, that these women aren’t being 
told about the potential complications 
of these abortion procedures. 
They are not being told that these 
abortion pills are going to cause pain 
and cramping and bleeding, that they 
could end up in the emergency room as 
well. They are not told about the com-
plications from the abortion proce-
dures. That is where the fraud and de-
ception is present. 
You talk about this as reproductive 
services. You are afraid to say the word 
‘‘abortion’’ in these clinics. That is the 
fraud and deception. This isn’t repro-
ductive services. These are abortions. 
This is taking the life of the unborn. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Could I ask a question 
then because I am a little confused by 
what has just happened here. I presume 
deception is wrong whoever does it. So 
if we just said no deception around 
pregnancy services, would you be will-
ing to support this? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. And just 
as a reminder, questions need to be 
asked through the Chair. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Yes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ques-
tions need to be asked through the 
Chair. 
Ms. WARREN. Yes, I am asking you 
that question, Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, we 
could never support any part of this 
legislation. I think the deception and 
fraud is occurring on the part of abor-
tion clinics. This is a threat to our 
First Amendment rights, and like I 
said in my opening remarks, this is 
just simply unacceptable. 
And that is why we continue to ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, if I 
may continue to ask my colleague 
through the Chair, is it right, no mat-
ter who gets the information by fraud, 
to give your most private health—sure-
ly, as a doctor, the Senator would say 
that no one should give up their health 
information to an entity that does not 
preserve it under HIPAA laws. 
So could the Senator not join us if we 
limit it to fraud that ultimately has 
that fraud create the insecurity of 
HIPAA information? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
think this is not the place to try to re-
write legislation. Of course, I am 
against all fraud. I think all fraud is 
bad. I am all for the truth. I am all for 
protecting patients’ personal informa-
tion, but I am also here proud to say 
what these great clinics do. I am not 
sure what you are even accusing them 
is even true. I have not witnessed that. 
The pregnancy clinics that I have seen 
do great work for these folks. They 
truly do sit down and talk with them. 
They give them a hand up. They do so 
many great things. 
So I don’t know where this fraud and 
deception is coming about, except that 
they are talking to women and saying: 
Do you realize your baby has a heart-
beat? Do you realize your baby can feel 
pain at 14 weeks? Do you realize that 
your baby recognizes the voice of your 
husband right now? 
So I think those are great things to 
share with patients; that how wonder-
ful life is; that we are all wonderfully, 
beautifully made in the womb; that life 
begins at conception. I think that is all 
the truth that should be shared with 
them. 
So, no, I don’t think there is any-
thing you could do with this legislation 
to change it that I could support, and I 
continue to object. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, then 
can I ask through the Presiding Officer 
another question, and that is if we are 
not talking about the fraud part, can 
we at least talk about collecting health 
information that any so-called crisis 
pregnancy center—I am sorry—is the 
Senator leaving, the one who said that 
it is important to protect private 
healthcare information? 
That at least we could agree that pri-
vate healthcare information—I guess 
the Senator is just going to walk off 
the floor. 
So the question would have been how 
about agreeing that anyone who col-
lects information about pregnancy and 
collects medical and personal informa-
tion has to be bound by HIPAA so that 
that information is fully protected. 
That would be my question. 
But since there is no one here to an-
swer it on the Republican side, I guess 
we will have to leave it for today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I would like to an-
swer the Senator’s question, and that 
makes eminent sense that we would 
protect HIPAA information, regardless 
of who is in a position to maybe have 
access to collecting it. And therefore, 
in the first instance, you shouldn’t col-
lect it, if you are not a medical entity, 
but if you do, you should be ultimately 
bound by the same guarantees that 
anyone else would be guaranteed. You 
know, it would baffle me that particu-
larly a medical professional, a doctor, 
would suggest that HIPAA information 
is something that we shouldn’t protect. 
I think that at a minimum, we 
should all be able to agree to that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, this is 
a reminder again why I am so honored 
to fight alongside Senator MENENDEZ. 
I don’t think anyone should be de-
ceived, and particularly a woman who 
is seeking information about termi-
nation of a pregnancy, and I don’t be-
lieve anyone’s private medical infor-
mation should be shared. 
The idea that these crisis pregnancy 
centers 
gather 
information 
from 
women who believe they are giving it 
to a medical provider and that that in-
formation will be protected and that 
that is not the case is truly despicable. 
Thank you again, Senator MENENDEZ. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4774 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, gas prices 
are 64 percent higher in my home State 
of Kentucky than they were in January 
of 2021. This means Kentuckians are 
paying $1.43 more for gas than they 
were at the beginning of last year. 
For 
average 
Americans 
already 
struggling to put food on the table, 
sky-high gas prices are a daily punish-
ment. 
Every additional dollar an American 
spends on a gallon of gas is a dollar not 
going towards their mortgage, their re-
tirement, or their children’s college 
fund. 
Rising prices are robbing Americans 
of the chance to plan for the future, as

they struggle to make ends meet in the 
present. 
In an attempt to address rising gas 
prices, President Biden announced on 
April 12 that he would allow the sale of 
E15 gasoline this summer. Then-White 
House press secretary Jen Psaki had 
this to say about this decision: 
[This] waiver [that President Biden passed 
to allow E15] is a critical step to address the 
fuel supply crisis and . . . build real U.S. en-
ergy independence, support American agri-
culture and manufacturing, and save Ameri-
cans money at the pump. At current prices, 
E15 can save a family 10 cents per gallon of 
gas on average and many stores sell E15 at 
even greater discount and today’s waiver 
will allow families to pay that lower price 
for months to come. 
So this is a policy supported by 
President Biden, and it is currently the 
law since he is waiving the regulation. 
E15 is a gasoline blend containing up 
to 15 percent ethanol. It is a renewable 
fuel typically made from corn. A 2008 
study published in Atmospheric Envi-
ronment found that ethanol-based fuels 
like E15 emit up to 16 percent less car-
bon dioxide than traditional gasoline. 
A more recent study published by the 
U.S. Department of Energy’s Argonne 
National Laboratory found that these 
fuels emit up to 23 percent less carbon 
dioxide and provide a cheaper alter-
native to typical gasoline, and yet the 
Clean Air Act currently prohibits the 
sale of E15 during the summer. So we 
sell it for 9 months of the year; we for-
bid it for 3 months of the year. But 
companies can’t get used to either sell-
ing it or making it or distributing it 
because of the disruption during the 
summer. 
Under the current law, gas with up to 
10 percent ethanol, commonly known 
as E10, can be sold during the summer. 
But, inexplicably, the law treats E15 
differently, even though the higher 
ethanol blend is better for the environ-
ment. 
American drivers ought to be able to 
access E15 year-round. Prohibiting its 
sale in the summer months artificially 
restricts the supply, especially when 
Americans are paying historically high 
prices for a gallon of gasoline. 
What we are asking to do today 
through this legislation is not to sub-
sidize ethanol, not to force people to 
use ethanol, but to allow people to use 
ethanol at an E15 basis, a little bit 
higher than we are allowed to use al-
ready. 
Republican and Democratic Presi-
dents have both waived this rule. This 
is essentially what the law of the land 
is other than we are having to suspend 
the law to get what we have. The last 
President and this President have both 
waived the rule that we are trying to 
repeal today. 
Both Presidents Trump and Biden ap-
proved the removal of barriers to the 
sale of E15 during the summer months; 
but in Congress, we have it in our 
power to permanently allow the sale of 
E15. 
If we only do it by Presidential waiv-
er, there is never enough certainty for 
people in the marketplace to decide to 
sell it year-round because they are 
worried that at any one moment a 
President will flip a switch, and then 
we will go back to banning it again. 
The EASE Act, which is what we will 
be asking to pass today, is a bill that 
will allow the sale of E15 year-round 
and will provide relief for Americans 
on the road—not only this year, but 
every year. This change is long over-
due. I have advocated this policy for 7 
years. I first introduced this legislation 
in 2015. 
Passing the EASE Act would benefit 
consumers, farmers, and the environ-
ment by increasing access. 
So as if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. 4774, which is at the desk; 
further, I ask unanimous consent that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed, and that the motion to re-
consider be consider made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Mexico. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, what 
my colleague from Kentucky is at-
tempting to do here is to really short- 
circuit the bedrock public health pro-
tections in the Clean Air Act. 
And make no mistake. This is a 
major policy change; not a minor 
change. It would have far-reaching im-
pacts. For example, this policy would 
clearly make food even more expen-
sive; it would make air quality worse. 
And it is not even eminently clear that 
the impact on gas prices would nec-
essarily be negative. 
So, fundamentally, this is the kind of 
sweeping policy that should actually 
go through the committee of jurisdic-
tion—in this case, the Environment 
and Public Works Committee. 
So I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 2022 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to support 
the swift passage of the Inflation Re-
duction Act. 
In the wake of COVID–19, global sup-
ply chains have been strained. There 
has been shipping disruptions, and 
Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has 
added to this. As a result of these 
many factors, inflation is up in almost 
every single country across the globe. 
The United States is among the world’s 
wealthiest and most productive and di-
versified economies, but no nation on 
Earth is immune to the forces of infla-
tion, particularly when it comes from 
so many different directions. 
Let’s remember also, 2021 was a huge 
year for U.S. economic growth. In fact, 
last year, the U.S. economy grew at its 
fastest pace since 1984. Our unemploy-
ment rate is back down to 50-year lows, 
wages have risen for many, and there is 
a job literally for any American who 
wants to work and is looking for work. 
Nobody thought that type of growth 
was sustainable, especially with the 
global economic headwinds we are fac-
ing and will continue to face. 
The fact is that Americans are forced 
to pay inflated gas prices at the pump 
because of the immoral and illegal in-
vasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin, 
because of the cartel—OPEC—that con-
trols prices, and because of our failure 
so far to invest in clean energy, and 
that has made our economy crack. 
So the question before us is: How do 
we help our economy gain firmer foot-
ing and lower prices for consumers; 
how do we make our country more en-
ergy independent; and how do we strike 
a blow for fairness and financial re-
sponsibility and make things better for 
families, businesses, and communities? 
The Inflation Reduction Act accom-
plishes all of those goals. It makes for-
ward-looking policy adjustments and 
investments to shore-up the economy. 
It takes long overdue steps to help 
lower out-of-pocket costs for things 
like energy, prescription drugs, and 
healthcare. It will strengthen Amer-
ica’s energy independence and enhance 
our national security by moving pro-
duction lines and jobs from China and 
other places back to the United States. 
And don’t just take my word for it. A 
wide array of economic experts have 
confirmed this bill will ease inflation 
in three ways: by lowering energy costs 
for families and small businesses, by 
cutting healthcare costs for millions of 
Americans and by ensuring wealthy 
Americans and large corporations pay 
their fair share. 
Republican and Democratic Treasury 
Secretaries have said this, as have over 
120 of our Nation’s leading economists, 
including seven Nobel Prize winners. 
The Inflation Reduction Act will also 
reduce the deficit by more than $100 
billion, according to the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office. And budg-
et experts agree, it will save another 
$200 billion by empowering and equip-
ping the IRS to crack down on tax 
cheats and enforce tax laws already on 
the books. 
So independent arbiters are clear: 
This bill is good for the family budget 
and for the national budget. It is good 
for the health of our communities and 
our planet. 
And here are some of the highlights. 
Let’s start with the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs. According to Families USA, 
nearly 3 in 10 American adults—that is 
about 80 million people—have not 
taken required medicine due to its high 
cost. For decades, the drug companies 
have taken advantage of every avenue 
to keep prices high. 
They argue that the cost is justified 
in order to fund research and develop-
ment, but that is not really what is 
happening. The bottom line is, drug 
companies are not playing fair. In fact, 
they are charging inflated prices even

on old medications, insulin being the 
classic example. Developed more than 
100 years ago, the developers basically 
made their product available to every-
one. They did not insist upon patent 
protection. Yet, the price of insulin, of 
a 100-year old drug, has gone up dra-
matically. 
The Inflation Reduction Act will put 
the brakes on this type of profiteering. 
Under this bill, the government will fi-
nally be allowed to directly negotiate 
lower drug prices for Medicare bene-
ficiaries. And I am fighting to include, 
as I mentioned before about insulin, a 
$35 cap on insulin costs for millions of 
Americans in this bill. And I must ap-
plaud Senator WARNOCK for his leader-
ship on this effort. 
It is long past time to get this done. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs al-
ready does it and saves veterans and 
taxpayers billions of dollars a year. 
The Inflation Reduction Act would also 
limit drug price increases to the rate of 
inflation. It also caps out-of-pocket 
costs at $2,000 annually for older adults 
buying prescriptions from pharmacies. 
It would also provide free vaccinations 
for seniors, and it helps keep health in-
surance 
affordable 
for 
millions 
of 
Americans. 
Let’s not forget, cutting healthcare 
costs for millions of Americans is a di-
rect attack on inflation. So the bene-
fits here are both health-related and 
economic. 
Now, let’s talk about how the bill 
will reduce energy costs and address 
climate change. The American people 
recognize that climate change is a seri-
ous threat. It fuels extreme weather, 
environmental degradation, and nat-
ural disasters. We are witnessing these 
phenomena at this moment all across 
the country. And, frankly, I haven’t 
seen the kind of rapidity and severity 
of storms like this in sheer number in 
my time. 
This is a result of our neglect of the 
climate crisis. And I must also applaud 
my colleague Senator WHITEHOUSE be-
cause he has been a voice since his first 
day here in this Chamber about the 
dangers of climate change, the cost to 
families, and the cost to our environ-
ment. 
Of course, all of these climate effects 
lead to food and water insecurity, eco-
nomic disruption, and, indeed, human 
conflict. One of the areas which is most 
concerning to our Defense Department 
officials is the follow-on effects of fam-
ine and disruption of economies. It usu-
ally creates a whole generation of 
young people without any gainful em-
ployment but with access to weapons, 
which leads to instability and vio-
lence—threats to the whole world. And 
eventually threats to us. 
Just this week, we had a hearing in 
the Banking Committee on the eco-
nomic costs of climate change. One 
witness cited a particularly eye-pop-
ping statistic from OMB, that our lack 
of action on climate change costs the 
Federal Government up to $2 trillion 
per year. That is $2 trillion with a T. 
So the cost of our efforts to reduce this 
will be more than exceeded, according 
to this number, by the benefits. And 
good economic analysis suggests, when 
you have a proposal in which benefits 
far outweigh cost, that proposal is 
something to consider. 
The Inflation Reduction Act stops 
kicking the can down the road and 
takes urgent, overdue action to con-
front climate change and economic 
challenges head on. I don’t have to re-
mind anyone here that we have been 
talking about climate change for years 
and years and years. And now, we have 
a real opportunity to take positive 
steps. And if we don’t, what we see now 
is upsetting, to say the least, but it is 
accelerating and you can sense the eco-
nomic crises and the environmental 
crises we see all around us will grow. 
Now, this legislation would invest 
$369 billion in affordable clean energy, 
energy security, and initiatives to help 
combat 
climate 
change 
and 
make 
America more energy independent. 
I will give you a very good example 
up in Rhode Island. We have the first 
offshore wind field in the United States 
off of Block Island. It was built and 
provided up to 300 workers—union 
workers mostly—with good jobs. It will 
continue to help employ people as it is 
maintained. It has provided us, the 
whole region, with an example of where 
to go. And now, you have significant 
wind farms that are being proposed in 
Federal waters off of Massachusetts 
and off of Long Island. This will bring 
energy 
without 
pollution. 
That 
is 
something that will benefit all of us, 
both in our pocketbook and in our 
well-being. 
This is really a historic investment. 
And the savings will pay off for fami-
lies and the planet month after month, 
year after year. It is something that we 
owe the next generation because right 
now, we are prepared to hand off to the 
sons and daughters and grandsons and 
granddaughters a world that is envi-
ronmentally challenged, to say the 
least. And they will look back on us 
and say: You had an opportunity, and 
you failed. 
We cannot fail. 
Now, a report by nonprofit group Re-
wiring America found that the tax in-
centives included as a part of the $369 
billion dedicated to climate change ini-
tiatives in the bill would save the aver-
age household $1,800 per year on energy 
costs. This will incentivize the use of 
heat pumps, the use of solar panels—a 
much more practical and cost-saving 
energy tool than what is available 
today. 
The Inflation Reduction Act also sets 
up America to out-innovate and out- 
compete other countries and strength-
ens domestic clean energy manufac-
turing and reinforces our supply chain, 
making America more energy inde-
pendent and self-reliant. 
I want to make the important point 
that under the Budget Act, this bill 
must be paid for. And rather than cut 
Medicare or Social Security as some of 
my colleagues on the other side like to 
suggest, this bill strikes a blow for 
fairness when it comes to our Tax 
Code. It sends a signal to the middle 
class that wealthy individuals who 
wish to avoid taxes will no longer be 
able to easily evade taxes because we 
are enforcing the auditing mechanisms 
at the IRS so that the laws are fol-
lowed more scrupulously, and that will 
result in benefits to all of us. 
It sends a signal to working families 
that the 150 most profitable companies 
will pay a minimum tax of 15 percent 
rather than zero, as is sometimes the 
case. It is not fair for a multi-billion 
dollar company to game the tax system 
to avoid any payment, while a truck 
driver or a custodian is paying 20 per-
cent of their income to taxes—or even 
more. 
It sends a signal that private equity 
and hedge fund managers who claim 
their income is carried interest will 
have to step up and pay more. Indeed, 
as the President stressed, this bill is 
written so that no family that makes 
under $400,000 will see their taxes go 
up. That is what the President prom-
ised, and that is what this legislation 
will do. 
So no one should be out making the 
claim that this hurts the middle class 
and the tax cuts will be paid for by 
them. In fact, it increases the tax-
payers in our system. And any exam-
ination of our present system shows it 
is grossly unfair. 
I will end with the words of the five 
former Treasury Secretaries, including 
one appointed by former President 
George W. Bush, who all agree that the 
Inflation Reduction Act will, in their 
words, ‘‘help increase American com-
petitiveness, address our climate crisis, 
lower costs for families, and fight in-
flation—and should be passed imme-
diately by Congress.’’ 
Let me also quote over 120 leading 
economists who shared a similar mes-
sage, writing: ‘‘This historic legislation 
makes crucial investments in energy, 
health care, and shoring up the na-
tion’s tax system. These investments 
will fight inflation and lower costs for 
American families while setting the 
stage for strong, stable and broadly- 
shared long-term economic growth.’’ 
This isn’t a partisan issue for econo-
mists, and it shouldn’t be a partisan 
issue in Congress. The bottom line is 
that Congress has an opportunity to 
help lower prices for consumers and in-
vest in scalable new energy tech-
nologies 
and 
solutions 
that 
will 
strengthen our economy and make the 
U.S. and the planet more secure, more 
prosperous, and more resilient. 
We must seize the moment. The time 
to act is now. Generations from now, 
they will look back at this moment 
and ask the question: Did we stand up 
for them, for this country, for the plan-
et, and for the future, or did we fail? 
I urge us all to stand up and succeed. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4025 
August 4, 2022 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3012 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, be-
fore the COVID–19 pandemic, few peo-
ple other than scientists and national 
security experts were familiar with 
gain-of-function research. Now, as we 
continue to search for the origin of this 
pandemic and begin to learn more 
about the dangerous research that has 
been largely kept from the public eye, 
it is becoming a household phrase. 
Before we get started on the current 
state of play, I would like to give a 
brief history of this research and how 
the Federal Government has poorly, 
perhaps even negligently, approached 
its oversight and funding. 
In late 2011, over a decade ago, the 
NSABB, which is the NIH’s advisory 
board, stopped two scientists from pub-
lishing an avian influenza gain-of-func-
tion study. Why? Because they were 
afraid that this study would educate 
bioterrorists. That is right. In 2011, a 
decade ago, scientists had figured out 
how to make H5N1—a highly patho-
genic 
avian 
influenza—more 
con-
tagious, which would have been cata-
strophic for American agriculture. 
Dr. Fauci personally called both sci-
entists and convinced them to volun-
teer to pause their experiments. In 
early 2012, Dr. Fauci encouraged all in-
fluenza scientists to voluntarily pause 
influenza gain-of-function research and 
told them: 
It is essential we respect the concern of the 
public domestically or globally, and not ask 
them to take the word of the influenza sci-
entist. 
Dr. Fauci was obviously concerned 
about the public’s perception out there. 
Dr. Fauci also, almost prophetically, 
stated that he worried about ‘‘unregu-
lated’’ laboratories, perhaps outside of 
the United States, doing work ‘‘slop-
pily’’ and leading to an inadvertent 
pandemic. ‘‘Accidental release is what 
the world is really worried about.’’ 
In 2014, after several biosecurity acci-
dents in U.S. research labs, the Obama 
White House implemented the gain-of- 
function moratorium on influenza, as 
well as MERS and SARS research, be-
cause of the potential risk of lab acci-
dents and inherent gain-of-function 
danger. These two moratoriums clearly 
demonstrate that the U.S. Government 
and the NIH, our primary public health 
Agency, understood the risk associated 
with this research and understood the 
threats it posed. 
Despite this pause, though, certain 
viral gain-of-function research projects 
continued at the University of North 
Carolina, 
research 
that 
was 
later 
shared with a Chinese virologist named 
Dr. Shi, the Bat Lady. She was famous 
for her copious amounts of research 
conducted on coronaviruses that live in 
bats. 
Outside of the North Carolina stud-
ies, Dr. Fauci failed to heed his own 
call on U.S. scientists to pause their 
gain-of-function studies and offshored 
the paused research to China not just 
once and not just recently but prac-
tically continuously for over a decade. 
It is disturbing that one of our top pub-
lic health Agencies directed this risky 
research to be offshored while encour-
aging the pause on that exact same re-
search here in the United States. 
In 2012, Dr. Fauci gave a new grant to 
Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance, a 
company that America will soon know 
the name of all across America. He 
gave a new grant to Peter Daszak’s 
EcoHealth Alliance for avian influenza 
research in China, which was truly 
gain-of-function research. 
In 2014, Dr. Fauci gave another new 
grant, another gain-of-function grant, 
to Dr. Daszak and EcoHealth for SARS 
research 
in 
China. 
Through 
these 
grants, Peter Daszak partnered with 
the Wuhan Institute of Virology. 
In late 2017, the NIH announced a lift 
on the gain-of-function pause, appar-
ently without consultation with the 
Senate-confirmed State Department or 
with national security leadership. Sig-
nificantly, there was no Director of the 
Office of Science and Technology Pol-
icy in place, with only an Acting HHS 
Secretary at the helm. The NIH essen-
tially lifted the moratorium on their 
own by slipping it in between adminis-
trations and self-policing. 
Today, we can’t see the research 
records from Dr. Fauci’s offshored 
projects because the Chinese Com-
munist Party has the possession—or at 
least supposedly has the possession—of 
EcoHealth’s records, and the NIH re-
sists in sharing theirs. 
By all accounts, Dr. Fauci and 
EcoHealth’s research in China led to 
the COVID–19 pandemic and Dr. Fauci’s 
worst fears that a lab accident in a for-
eign lab would become a reality. 
At a very important hearing yester-
day at the Capitol, hosted by Senator 
PAUL, before the Senate Homeland Se-
curity and Governmental Affairs Sub-
committee on Emerging Threats and 
Spending 
Oversight, 
Dr. 
Richard 
Ebright, a renowned microbiologist, 
declared that it was indeed possible 
that this research did lead to the out-
break of COVID–19. 
Dr. Steven Quay and Dr. Kevin 
Esvelt, other expert witnesses on the 
panel, agreed that viral gain-of-func-
tion offers no civilian use or benefit. 
Let me say that again. Both of these 
doctors agreed that viral gain-of-func-
tion offers no civilian use or benefit 
but that it is so risky that it can cause 
a pandemic that will have a worse im-
pact than a nuclear attack. It is indeed 
a weapon of mass destruction. 
Despite warnings and past lab acci-
dents, our public health Agencies, like 
the NIH, continue to fund this weapon- 
of-mass-destruction research, often in 
China nonetheless. In fact, at one 
point, the NIH paid for more viral gain- 
of-function experiments than the De-
partment of Defense, according to 
hearing testimony given by Dr. Fauci 
on this topic in 2012. 
Shockingly, Congress has minimal 
insight into the amount of research 
that the NIH performs. There is no 
transparency in the risk evaluation 
process, and there is no proper over-
sight. 
Recently—and this is news—our of-
fice learned that the USAID is cur-
rently paying $125 million to the Wash-
ington State University Paul Allen 
School for Global Health to collect po-
tential pandemic pathogens in high- 
risk areas for outbreak. Once collected, 
these samples are being used in dan-
gerous 
gain-of-function 
experiments 
through their DEEP VZN grant. This 
project initially partnered with five 
countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin 
America, but it could expand to others. 
The university researchers are col-
lecting, storing, and experimenting on 
these pathogens in foreign laboratories 
in each country. Even worse, these haz-
ardous research techniques are being 
taught to foreign researchers while ex-
perimenting with potentially deadly 
pathogens in laboratories where the 
United States has no regulatory con-
trol or authority. No process exists to 
screen U.S. researchers or foreign re-
searchers by intelligence analysts for 
their potential as threat actors. The 
United States has no ability to control 
who the technology or the deadly 
pathogens are shared with in these for-
eign labs and cannot enforce proper 
storage techniques. 
The USAID is putting everyone at 
risk right now. Our U.S. public health 
Agencies, like the NIH and the CDC, 
cannot be entrusted to oversee risky 
research with the current guardrails 
that are self-selecting and self-polic-
ing. Certainly, our U.S. Agency for 
International Development cannot be 
entrusted. Yet Federal Agencies con-
tinue to dispense funds for gain-of- 
function research. 
Dr. Fauci recently came before Con-
gress and publicly declared that he had 
no intention to stop using U.S. tax-
payer dollars to fund Chinese Com-
munist Party research projects. 
Folks, this is a national security 
issue. Since January of 2020, I have 
been trying to sound the alarm on this 
virus—on this issue, on this weapon of 
mass destruction—but it is largely fall-
ing on deaf ears in Congress and with 
the current administration. Yester-
day’s HSGAC hearing was the first 
time Congress had examined this sub-
ject since the outbreak of COVID–19. 
Unfortunately, none of my colleagues 
from across the aisle bothered to show 
up for this hearing, clearly declaring 
that this was not a priority for them. 
Additionally, mainstream media has 
attempted to bury concerns about 
gain-of-function research and the possi-
bility of a lab leak. 
This is unacceptable. We must pause 
this research until national security 
experts can help create appropriate 
risk metrics, guardrails, and processes 
for this research.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4026 
August 4, 2022 
It is important to note that it is esti-
mated that this research only com-
prises less than 0.1 percent of all bio-
medical research and less than 1 per-
cent of virology research. Dr. Richard 
Ebright testified that because gain-of- 
function research of concern can cause 
pandemics, this small part of the bio-
medical research enterprise is highly 
consequential and requires effective 
oversight. Certainly, that current over-
sight is not effective. 
This is a bipartisan national security 
issue. And anyone who studies this 
issue in depth will conclude that viral 
gain of function is a weapon of mass 
destruction. 
Anyone who examines this will con-
clude that COVID is like a nuclear 
hand grenade, with its pin pulled out. 
It has already killed a million people 
and can kill millions more. Every wit-
ness will conclude, like we did yester-
day, that the potential is much worse 
than any type of benefit from this re-
search. 
This COVID virus is likely a product 
of 
U.S.-funded 
gain-of-function 
re-
search. The research has produced no 
benefit in 10 years and with seemingly 
no benefit on the horizon. 
This is why I brought my legislation 
to the floor today to place a morato-
rium on all Federal research projects, 
grants to universities and other organi-
zations conducting gain-of-function re-
search and risky research on potential 
pandemic pathogens. This is an urgent 
matter that must be acted on today. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 3012, and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration; further, that the bill be 
considered read a third time and 
passed, and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Reserving the right 
to object, earlier this year, when we 
passed the PREVENT Pandemics Act 
out of our HELP Committee in an over-
whelming bipartisan vote, we were able 
to include amendments from my col-
league from Kansas and others to bol-
ster oversight of the federally funded 
research involving pathogens of pan-
demic potential and make sure that we 
do 
have 
appropriate 
guardrails 
in 
place. 
I appreciate the leadership my col-
league from Kansas has shown on this 
issue. I know it is important to him. 
However, I am concerned this new bill 
brought forward today is far less tar-
geted than the provisions the Senator 
from Kansas and I worked on within 
PREVENT and would have significant 
and unintended consequences for U.S. 
biomedical research. 
Instead of passing this bill, I would 
respectfully ask my colleague from 
Kansas to keep working with me and 
Ranking Member BURR to get his re-
lated provision and the rest of our 
PREVENT Pandemics Act across the 
finish line. 
I thank the Senator from Kansas for 
his work and his focus on this issue. I 
really think we can continue to make 
bipartisan progress in the next few 
weeks 
on 
getting 
the 
PREVENT 
Pandemics Act and the Senator’s pro-
vision he and I worked on into a good 
place and finally getting that much 
needed package signed into law. 
For those reasons, I object today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Kansas. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4778 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
want to thank my colleague for her 
kind comments. Certainly, the chair-
woman has my commitment to con-
tinue to work with her on the PRE-
VENT Pandemics Act as well. 
But if my colleagues do not agree 
with placing a full moratorium on 
gain-of-function research, I ask for 
unanimous consent to adopt the SAFE 
Risky Research Act, which stops Fed-
eral funds from being used to conduct 
risky research with countries that 
threaten our democracy and public 
health. 
We recently learned that USAID has 
been paying for this dangerous re-
search in China. We know that this re-
search is being conducted in Africa, 
Asia, and Latin America, but we don’t 
yet know all the other countries where 
they fund this risky research. 
What we do know is that, despite 
their relationship with the State De-
partment, this funding is being dis-
pensed by USAID without State De-
partment security consultations, obliv-
ious to the proliferation potential. 
Federal Agencies that oversee na-
tional intelligence maintain lists of 
countries that may pose a risk or 
threat to national security. The De-
partment of State, for example, main-
tains a list that includes Burma, the 
People’s Republic of China, Iran, North 
Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, 
and others. 
This legislation is common sense. We 
shouldn’t be collaborating on dan-
gerous research with our adversaries. 
I think it is obvious that all members 
of our committee agree with us. They 
support this bill and this legislation. 
On March 15, the HELP Committee 
held a markup where this amend-
ment—the same text that is in this 
bill—was unanimously adopted in the 
bipartisan PREVENT Pandemics Act. I 
appreciate Chairwoman MURRAY work-
ing so hard collaborating with us. 
During the markup, she supported 
this, 
specifically 
stating 
that 
it 
threads the needle in terms of pro-
tecting biomedical research enterprise 
while taking steps to address some of 
the concerns she has heard from other 
committee members. 
Given the inherent risk, NIH’s un-
willingness to fully cooperate with con-
gressional oversight, and Senate Demo-
crats’ objection to taking the needed 
step of placing a complete moratorium 
on gain-of-function research, we must 
at least pass this narrow approach 
today. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. 4778, which is at the desk; 
further, that the bill be considered read 
a third time and passed; and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Reserving the right 
to object, I do appreciate the Senator 
from Kansas’s focus and leadership on 
this issue. 
I am glad we were able to work to-
gether to include a provision similar to 
this bill in our PREVENT Pandemics 
Act that we did pass out of the HELP 
Committee by an overwhelming vote 
earlier this year. 
Along with Ranking Member BURR, 
we are very focused on getting the 
PREVENT Pandemics Act passed into 
law. These reforms are overdue and 
vital to keeping our families safe. 
The Senator’s provisions within that 
package, as well as many others, are 
really key to making sure that our 
country 
is 
prepared 
for 
future 
pandemics. 
I do hope we can continue to work on 
this bill in a bipartisan way and get it 
passed and put into law shortly. So 
while I look forward to continuing to 
work with the Senator from Kansas on 
this 
issue 
within 
the 
PREVENT 
Pandemics Act package, if he is asking 
today for unanimous consent to pass it, 
I object.

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, 12 
years ago, the U.S. Congress was on the 
precipice of passing historic climate 
legislation—legislation that may not 
have been perfect but would have cut 
carbon pollution by 80 percent by the 
year 2050, and it would have set us on 
a path to a healthier, cleaner, safer 
world. 
Unfortunately, despite that bill pass-
ing through the House of Representa-
tives, a bill which Congressman Henry 
Waxman and I were able to craft and to 
move through the House of Representa-
tives, even though the Senate and the 
Senate 
Democrats 
had 
a 
super-
majority, that legislation was ulti-
mately defeated by the same legisla-
tive body, the U.S. Senate, that I serve 
in today. In 2009, the U.S. Senate chose 
to do nothing rather than something 
substantial that would give us a fight-
ing chance against this generational 
crisis, which is why we have spent the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4027 
August 4, 2022 
last 12 years in the climate wilderness, 
with full-blown Republican obstruc-
tionism and no meaningful congres-
sional action on climate justice all the 
while. That wilderness literally burns 
to the ground because of climate 
change. 
In the intervening decade, we have 
suffered the consequences of climate 
inaction. Weather that used to be ex-
treme is now the new normal, and that 
normal is deadly. Our addiction to fos-
sil fuels has put communities at risk— 
worsening asthma, cancers, and disease 
in general—and has exposed working 
people to criminal price gouging from 
Big Oil and Big Gas. 
Throughout this summer, the United 
States has experienced devastating 
heat waves, putting 100 million Ameri-
cans under heat warnings across the 
country. People are dying in Kentucky. 
Children are dying in Kentucky as a re-
sult of the extreme rain and floods— 
rain that still hasn’t stopped. Those 
are so-called 100-year floods. Well, now 
they are happening on a weekly basis— 
in Kentucky. Over and over again, 
communities throughout the United 
States are facing deadly wildfires, 
storms, and droughts, all of which have 
become more frequent and more severe 
over the last 12 years. 
But instead of giving up after that 
missed opportunity more than a decade 
ago, we reengaged. We rebuilt and re-
energized a stronger, smarter climate 
movement, one that expanded carbon 
calculators to include climate justice; 
one that swapped complicated carbon 
trading systems for direct funding for 
environmental justice communities in 
our country; and one that exchanged 
an 
environmental-above-all strategy 
for a 21st-century contract with com-
munities, with the promise of climate 
justice, well-paid union jobs, and cuts 
to climate pollution so all of our chil-
dren and grandchildren can thrive on a 
livable planet. 
So let me be clear. The Inflation Re-
duction Act of 2022 is not the Green 
New Deal that America wants and 
needs. I wish it were. But I have 
learned a hard truth throughout my 
years in Congress: Perfect ideas can 
only live on through imperfect legisla-
tion. 
As the author of both the Green New 
Deal and the Waxman-Markey climate 
bill, I know we cannot wait another 12 
years for billions of dollars in invest-
ment to fight the climate crisis. This is 
not the bill we wanted. It is not the bill 
I would have drafted. But we need a 
package now to fight for and resources 
to fight with. 
This bill will not correct every eco-
nomic injustice in our society or rec-
tify the economic disparities between 
Big Oil billionaires and working fami-
lies, but it starts a process that we ab-
solutely need to level the playing field. 
The Inflation Reduction Act makes 
sure that every billion-dollar corpora-
tion finally pays a higher tax rate than 
a preschool teacher. Last year, a pre-
school teacher in Massachusetts paid 8 
percent of their average $39,000 salary 
in Federal taxes. ExxonMobil paid only 
2.8 percent of their $9.3 billion U.S. 
earnings in Federal taxes. Chevron paid 
a mere 1.8 percent of their $9.5 billion 
in U.S. earnings in Federal taxes in 
2021. A kindergarten teacher in Massa-
chusetts paid 8 percent on $39,000 of in-
come. 
Who did more for America last year— 
all of our kindergarten teachers or the 
executives at ExxonMobil and Chev-
ron? Who contributed more to our soci-
ety? 
That is our challenge right now to 
pass this legislation because the status 
quo is immoral. It is outrageous. And 
unless we pass this bill, that disparity 
is perfectly legal. They can evade their 
responsibility to contribute to solving 
the problem which they created: the 
climate crisis. 
Right now, they are letting preschool 
teachers contribute more than they are 
to a problem that families across our 
country are suffering from. By passing 
the Inflation Reduction Act, we can 
make sure that Big Oil finally pays 
more in taxes than preschool teachers. 
We can take that revenue and reinvest 
it into clean energy and healthier com-
munities. 
This bill will not give the climate 
movement the trillions needed to con-
front the crises of systematic racism, 
economic inequality, a broken health 
system, and climate injustice. But 
thanks to our relentless fighting, this 
bill contains a historic $60 billion in 
environmental justice investments. 
Let me say that again: $60 billion 
will be in this bill to begin the process 
of rectifying the problems for Black 
and Brown and indigenous commu-
nities all across our country who have 
always been the victims of climate 
change, of environmental injustice. 
This has never happened before in 
any bill in U.S. history. It is in this 
bill, finally. Now, that is the message 
of the Green New Deal. That was some-
thing that was driving FOX News and 
the oil companies crazy when we said 
we have to rectify environmental injus-
tice as well as part of the Green New 
Deal. It is in this bill. It is in this bill, 
$60 billion. And that will begin to start 
righting the wrongs brought by pol-
luters in our most vulnerable commu-
nities. 
This could be a downpayment on 
clean air and safer communities every-
where, not just the suburbs, which have 
always breathed cleaner air than inner- 
city communities because they don’t 
plant these oil and gas and other facili-
ties in the suburbs; they put them 
right next to what they believe are the 
least powerful communities in our 
country. 
We know this bill will not get us to 
the critical mark of 50 percent emis-
sions reductions, 2005 levels, by 2030, 
which is the baseline of what we need 
to meet our 2050 targets. However— 
however—this package gets us to 40 
percent reductions economy-wide, and, 
more importantly, it puts our economy 
on an emissions reductions trajectory 
that positions us to enact more clean 
energy and climate justice provisions 
in the future to meet the 50 percent 
goal. Securing these emissions reduc-
tions now is the start which we need, 
and we need it now. 
This legislation reflects the largest 
single investment in climate justice 
and environmental protection in our 
Nation’s history. And it meets the cli-
mate test. First, it reduces emissions, 
creates good-paying union jobs, and 
provides funding so that we can begin 
the long process of repairing historic 
harms in our environmental justice 
communities with that $60 billion in-
vestment. 
Second, the bill lowers energy costs 
for consumers. Price-gouging and tax- 
dodging big oil companies are charging 
Americans more than $4 a gallon for 
gasoline, shaking money out of their 
pockets at the pumps all across our 
country. And what we are going to do 
is just point to the electric vehicle 
owners who pay an equivalent of 75 
cents a gallon right now in our country 
in order to go the same distance. And 
we are going to open up this oppor-
tunity to tens of millions of additional 
Americans once we pass it. 
The Inflation Reduction Act provides 
tax credits to low- and middle-income 
Americans so they can buy a new or a 
used EV, break their addiction to Big 
Oil, and save money on their daily 
commutes. 
And, finally, the Inflation Reduction 
Act will make sure we make things in 
America again. The domestic manufac-
turing tax credits in this bill for the 
first time ensure that we will build 
electric vehicles, solar panels, wind 
turbines here in our own backyard, in 
the United States. American-made in-
frastructure means good-paying union 
jobs. And a new study released today 
shows that this bill will create—get 
ready—9 million new jobs in our coun-
try. That is what we are talking about. 
That is what we will be debating on the 
floor of the U.S. Senate over the next 
several days. 
And I am especially proud of a provi-
sion I authored with Senator CHRIS 
VAN
HOLLEN
and 
Congresswoman 
DEBBIE DINGELL that would fund a na-
tional climate bank to ensure vulner-
able American communities will have 
access to capital to invest in local 
clean energy projects and fuel a new 
generation of entrepreneurs from dis-
advantaged backgrounds. 
How big is this program? Twenty- 
seven billion dollars and a climate 
bank that communities across the 
country can apply to at the lowest pos-
sible interest rates for their greening 
of their housing units, the greening of 
any other part of their community. 
And what McKinsey has estimated is 
that for every dollar that is in the

billion that are going to get unleashed 
just in this section in that one pro-
gram.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4028 
August 4, 2022 
And critical Defense Production Act 
funding will ensure that we have ro-
bust domestic supply chains to install 
heat pumps in American buildings and 
responsibly source critical minerals for 
clean energy technologies made in 
America. 
We have to break this whole addic-
tion that we have not only to foreign 
oil coming into our country but also 
being dependent upon other countries 
for the clean energy technologies. We 
are going to do it here. That is what 
this bill says. We are going to tell peo-
ple we don’t need your oil any more 
than we need your sand. We are going 
to do it right here. We are going to 
build the technologies right here in our 
country. 
So my time in Congress has taught 
me this: We cannot let the perfect be 
the enemy of the good. Ending up with 
nothing might be a viable political op-
tion, but it is not a viable planetary 
option. This is a good bill with broad- 
based appeal that lowers costs for con-
sumers, fights inflation with deficit re-
duction, protects our environment with 
critical justice investments, and pro-
vides affordable healthcare access to 
all Americans. 
In 2009, zero was an option, which 
this Senate took. Zero is not an option 
we can take. We must pass this legisla-
tion. And we will begin a pathway for 
generations to come that says: We un-
derstood your anger. We understood 
why you as a younger generation be-
lieve that the system had failed you 
and that it had not provided the solu-
tions which you deserve. 
So let’s pass this bill and keep fight-
ing the cities and States and in the 
White House and in Congress so that 
we can finish the job in the years 
ahead, meet our climate targets, and 
finally pass the Green New Deal that 
our country deserves. 
This is our moment. And the beauty 
of it is that there is a poetic justice in 
it. And it is that Chevron only paid 2.8 
percent on their profits last year. 
ExxonMobil only paid 3 percent on 
their profits last year. They are the 
ones who are going to pay for the solu-
tions to the problems which they cre-
ated. They are going to be the source of 
the funding because we are going to 
force them to finally pay their taxes, 
to pay their fair share of the dues to 
live in this great country. 
That moment of justice is arriving. 
And it is justice. They are the ones 
who should be paying for this. They are 
the ones who have a moral, political, 
and economic responsibility to pay for 
this bill. And they right now are 
screaming; they are absolutely angry 
that we are going to take this action. 
But I will tell you this. We are going to 
be forced to do it with no Republican 
support because the GOP now stands 
for ‘‘Gas and Oil Party.’’ It now stands 
for ‘‘Gang of Polluters.’’ That is the 
GOP of today. And they are going to 
say: Oh, my goodness, look at all the 
socialism that is going into this pack-
age for wind and solar and all-electric 
vehicles and batteries. And you know 
what this young generation’s response 
is? What do you call tax breaks for oil, 
gas, and coal for 100 years? If that is 
not socialism, what is? And all we are 
looking for is fair treatment for the re-
newable 
energy 
revolution 
because 
once we give them the same kinds of 
incentives, get out of the way because 
we are going to have that revolution 
that young people in our country have 
wanted for so long. 
So it is all on us, the Democrats. It is 
our moment to deliver for the Amer-
ican people and guarantee the re-
sources we need to keep fighting for 
the future we deserve. 
And, by the way, after we have cre-
ated those 9 million new jobs, that is 
forever going to be a new political con-
stituency in our country. They are 
going to be saying to Senators who are 
going to vote no today: What are you 
doing? You are voting against my new 
job that has been created? 
And so this is just the beginning. And 
we are going to telescope the time-
frame ultimately in order to finish the 
job. 
Yes, we are now in a sprint to solve 
the problem because every night on 
every TV station, the lead stories are: 
floods and fires and every other imag-
inable consequence of climate change. 
And it is time, the moment has ar-
rived, and the U.S. Senate, with only 
Democratic support, is ready to take 
the action that the younger generation 
in our country has been ready for. 
I thank you for giving me the oppor-
tunity of being here. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 2022 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I want-
ed to come down here tonight to talk a 
little bit about the bill that we have in 
front of us this weekend, the Inflation 
Reduction Act. I have been in the Sen-
ate for 13 years, and I think this is one 
of the most important pieces of legisla-
tion that we have ever considered. 
Let me just say, also, that the Pre-
siding Officer and I have been here for 
a long time, and there have been weeks 
and weeks and weeks, months, years 
that have gone by here where it felt 
like we haven’t gotten anything done. 
What an amazing moment to be here 
when we have a bipartisan infrastruc-
ture bill that we passed with the big-
gest investment in our infrastructure 
since Eisenhower was President. We 
passed the first bipartisan bill to over-
come the NRA just a few weeks ago. 
Last week, we were able to pass the 
CHIPS Act to bring back semiconduc-
tors to the U.S.A. and the PACT Act, 
the veterans bill last night. 
Today, we are here to talk about the 
Inflation Reduction Act. It is quite an 
amazing moment in our democracy 
and, I think, in the country’s history. 
It is not the subject of my speech to-
night, but I want to say, with the Pre-
siding Officer on the floor, that there 
might be a reason to think that we are 
at a moment in our country’s history 
when we are actually ready, finally, to 
turn the page on the trickle-down eco-
nomics that have created such an un-
fair economy for so many families and 
so many young people in this country 
and create, once again, in the United 
States, an economy that, when it 
grows, it grows for everybody, not just 
the people at the very top. 
This bill fits into that. The bill on in-
frastructure fits into that. The bill on 
the semiconductors fits into that, as 
well. 
If you look at the agenda Washington 
has pursued for the last 40 years or so, 
it is pretty simple: Let the big corpora-
tions do whatever they want and call it 
‘‘freedom’’; cut investments in working 
families and our future; and instead of 
grappling with the income inequality 
we have, instead of grappling with the 
economic mobility that we have, cut 
taxes for the wealthiest people in the 
country, cut taxes for the largest cor-
porations in the country, hoping that 
those tax cuts will somehow magically 
trickle down to everyone else and pay 
for themselves. That has never hap-
pened. 
Here is what happened instead: 40 
years of an economy that has worked 
really well for the wealthiest people 
and corporations but hasn’t worked 
very well for anybody else; an economy 
with income inequality higher than at 
any time since the 1920s, where the top 
0.1 percent of Americans, a mere 160,000 
families, 
hold 
basically 
the 
same 
amount of wealth as the bottom 90 per-
cent of Americans, nearly 145 million 
families—160,000 families, the top 0.1 
percent, hold as much wealth as the 
bottom 90 percent, 9 out of 10 Ameri-
cans, nearly 145 million families— 
where kids—I am sad to say this in 
front of the kids here tonight—have a 
50–50 shot of earning more than their 
parents, where that number used to be 
90 percent; that charges families more 
for their healthcare than any other in-
dustrialized country in the world; that 
forces seniors in this country—and 
only in this country—to cut their pills 
in half or skip prescriptions or decide 
whether they are going to be able to 
eat or take their medicine; that is 
shackled to a global fossil fuel market 
dictated 
by 
tyrants 
like 
Vladimir 
Putin, despite our abundant resources 
at home and despite the urgent threat 
from climate change. 
That is the legacy of the past 40 
years of trickle-down economics. As I 
have said many, many times on this 
floor, we can’t survive another 40 years 
like the last 40 years and expect to 
hold onto this democracy. I don’t think 
we can survive another 10 years like 
this and expect to hold on to this de-
mocracy with this failed agenda. 
Working families can’t sustain it. 
Our democracy can’t withstand it be-
cause, when people feel like they have 
lost the sense of opportunity for them-
selves and their families no matter how 
hard they work, that is when, you 
know, 
throughout 
human 
history,

August 4, 2022 
somebody shows up. Some self-inter-
ested politician shows up and says: I 
alone can fix it. You don’t need a de-
mocracy. You don’t need the rule of 
law. You should expect your public sec-
tor and your private sector to be hope-
lessly corrupt, and you are a sucker if 
you don’t believe that because people 
are going to take advantage of you. 
We need a new agenda for America. I 
am pleased to say that we are closer, I 
think, tonight—this weekend—than we 
have been in a long time to pursuing 
one. 
It started with the American Rescue 
Plan. It continued, as I said earlier, 
with the bipartisan infrastructure law 
we passed this year to rebuild our 
country and the bipartisan innovation 
bill that we passed last week to help us 
compete with China and bring thou-
sands of good-paying jobs back home. 
And, now, I hope we are close to pass-
ing the next part, the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act. This bill will lower costs for 
millions of families—at the pharmacy, 
at the pump, and on their monthly en-
ergy bills and insurance premiums. It 
will do more to achieve energy inde-
pendence and fight climate change 
than anything that we have ever done 
as a nation. 
And unlike the Trump tax cuts for 
the wealthiest Americans, which added 
$1.9 trillion to the debt, notwith-
standing the arguments that we have 
heard going back to Ronald Reagan— 
the false arguments that we have heard 
going back to Ronald Reagan—that 
these tax cuts will pay for themselves. 
Once again, of course, they didn’t pay 
for themselves. And unlike that, a $1.9 
trillion hole blasted into our deficit 
when unemployment was only at 3.5 
percent. Every cent of that money was 
borrowed just for the privilege of giv-
ing tax cuts to the wealthiest Ameri-
cans. Fifty-two percent of that bill 
went to the top 5 percent of Americans. 
We borrowed every single cent to do 
that. 
That would be no different than when 
the Presiding Officer was the mayor of 
Richmond, VA, and if he said to the 
people of Richmond: I have a really 
good idea for how we could spend a lot 
of money, but we are going to have to 
borrow money to do it. 
And they said: Well, that sounds like 
a lot of money that you are borrowing. 
Tell us what you are spending it on. 
Are you using it for our roads and 
bridges? 
No. 
Are you using it for the parks? 
No. 
Are you using it for education, for 
mental health, which we desperately 
need in this country? Are you using it 
to transfer the local economy to 
greener energy? 
No. 
What are you using it for, Mr. Mayor, 
they would say. 
And the answer is: I am going to bor-
row this massive amount of money, 
and I am going to give it to the two 
wealthiest neighborhoods in Richmond 
and hope that it is just going to trickle 
down to everybody else. 
I am not making it up. That is the 
theory. That is the policy. And that 
was the theory and the policy when 
Ronald Reagan was President. That 
was the theory and policy when Donald 
Trump was President. 
And unlike those bills, every single 
cent in this bill is paid for. More than 
that, it cuts the deficit by over $300 bil-
lion. If you listen to my Republican 
colleagues, at least some of them and 
the way they complain about this bill, 
you would think it was some sort of 
Bolshevik takeover of the U.S.A. It is 
ridiculous. 
I think, sometimes, they just don’t 
even want the public to know what is 
in this bill because what is in this bill 
is so popular with the American people. 
Let’s start with healthcare. For the 
first time ever, this bill requires Medi-
care to negotiate drug prices on behalf 
of the American people. 
The Presiding Officer and I wrote a 
bill called Medicare-X. We introduced 
it, I think, in 2017, to create a public 
option so that everybody in America 
could have the benefit of choosing be-
tween their private insurance and pub-
lic insurance. That is not in this bill. 
But in that bill, we said that Medicare 
ought to negotiate drug prices for sen-
iors. This would allow Medicare to use 
its market power to drive down the 
costs of prescription drugs. That is 
going to save families thousands of dol-
lars, and it is going to save our country 
billions of dollars. 
The only reason we have not passed 
that is because special interests have 
succeeded at tying Medicare’s hands so 
that pharmaceutical companies could 
keep charging Americans prices that 
no other developed nation in the world 
would tolerate—Americans like Julia 
from Denver. Her dad has a heart con-
dition. He pays $6,000 a month for 
medication. That is $72,000 a year for 
something he needs to take for the rest 
of his life. That is outrageous, but I 
hear stories like that every day all 
over Colorado. 
The Inflation Reduction Act also 
would cap out-of-pocket costs for sen-
iors to $2,000 a year so they aren’t 
spending down their retirement to buy 
medication. I know seniors in Colorado 
who literally spend their entire retire-
ment trying to figure out how to get 
the medication they need, the medica-
tion they have been prescribed by a 
doctor. The choices they have to make 
look unlike any other choices any sen-
ior has to make in any other country 
in the world. 
I was with some people in Pueblo re-
cently where one of the people said: I 
have three inhalers, but I can’t afford 
the three inhalers. So I can only take 
one of them at a time, and I have been 
getting sicker and sicker as a result of 
that. 
Another person in the room had 
worked her entire life at the local 
newspaper, and she was telling me that 
she was having to cut her medications 
in order to make it through economi-
cally. 
On top of that, this bill has a 3-year 
extension for tax credits to help mil-
lions of Americans pay for their health 
insurance, including over 150,000 Colo-
radans who are going to be able to af-
ford their health insurance in ways 
they couldn’t. 
The second part of this bill closes tax 
loopholes for about 200 of the biggest 
corporations in America—those with 
over $1 billion in profit. This comes di-
rectly from a bill that I wrote with 
Senator WARREN
and with Senator 
KING. Today, these corporations use ar-
mies of lawyers and accountants that 
no middle-class family has, no working 
family has, no small business has to 
pay almost nothing in classes. 
Last year, Chevron paid an effective 
rate of 1.8 percent. Bank of America 
paid 3.5 percent—3.5 percent. That is 
after the Trump tax cuts cut the cor-
porate rate and took it down to, I 
think, it was 20 percent—which, by the 
way, there was no consensus to do. The 
consensus was at 25 percent. Here you 
have companies paying 1.8 percent, and 
3.5 percent in the case of Bank of 
America. Amazon paid 6.1 percent. 
They might want to fire their CFO be-
cause they are paying a little more 
than the 1.8 and the 3.5. AT&T paid 
negative 4.1 percent. That means they 
got money back from the Treasury in 
tax credits. 
In Colorado, a typical firefighter, 
teacher, or police officer has an effec-
tive tax rate of somewhere around 16 to 
22 percent. So, on the one hand, you 
have working Americans paying 20 per-
cent of their income in an economy 
that has barely lifted their incomes in 
40 years, while billion-dollar corpora-
tions are paying virtually nothing. 
I had a conversation the other day 
with a ‘‘Teacher of the Year’’ from Col-
orado. She is from Glenwood Springs. 
She said that she wasn’t complaining, 
that she was just making an observa-
tion. She said 70 percent to 80 percent 
of her colleagues in the middle school 
in which she teaches and at the high 
school in Glenwood Springs have to 
work two and three jobs just so they 
can afford to live in Glenwood Springs. 
Do we think it is all right for her to 
have to pay 22 percent of her income in 
taxes and the biggest corporations in 
America that are making more than $1 
billion in income don’t have to at least 
pay 15 percent, much less the 20 per-
cent gift that Donald Trump gave them 
when the number that everybody had 
basically agreed to was 25 percent? It is 
no wonder that Americans think this 
Tax Code is rigged against them. 
We start to fix that problem with 
this bill. It is not everything that I 
would have wanted. I think we have a 
lot more to do to make this Tax Code 
fairer, not the least of which is to 
make permanent the expanded child 
tax credit that I worked on with 
SHERROD
BROWN, CORY
BOOKER, and 
KAMALA HARRIS; and the earned income 
tax credit that I worked on with

SHERROD BROWN to give working people 
the biggest tax cut they had in genera-
tions. That is one of the things that is 
not in this bill that I feel really ter-
rible about. 
This bill also is limiting something 
called the carried interest loophole. 
Most Americans have no idea what 
that is because 99.9999999 percent of 
Americans are not hedge fund man-
agers; they don’t benefit from this 
loophole to lower their tax rate and 
pay less than their assistants or than 
their secretary. 
That hasn’t stopped my Republican 
colleagues from telling the American 
public that this bill would tax working 
people—that is what they are saying. 
And I guess that is true if by ‘‘working 
people’’ they mean hedge fund man-
agers. Over half of them base their 
business in the Cayman Islands or bil-
lion dollar corporations. We are in-
creasing their taxes—that is true—but 
there is nothing in this bill that is rais-
ing taxes on American families—noth-
ing. Nothing. 
It is amazing to me that people that 
I meet that simultaneously support the 
Trump tax cuts for the wealthiest peo-
ple on the theory of trickle-down eco-
nomics and are opposed to this bill on 
the theory that somehow the taxes 
that we are raising on, literally, the 
wealthiest humans in our country and 
the wealthiest corporations are some-
how going to trickle down to people in 
the workplace. It is never going to hap-
pen. It never has. 
The last part of this bill contains en-
ergy. And, first, I think it is important 
for us to have some context. It has 
been nearly 50 years since the 1973 oil 
crisis spurred America to seek ‘‘energy 
independence.’’ 
It has been more than 30 years since 
NASA scientist James Hansen urged 
Congress to fight climate change, I 
think at a hearing held by my prede-
cessor Tim Wirth. And until now we 
haven’t had a plan, we have had no 
plan to accomplish either. 
We haven’t just stalled—in some 
cases, we have actually gone backward. 
At home, right now, our use of coal has 
increased during the Biden administra-
tion. Abroad, Germany has been forced 
to reactivate coal plants after Putin’s 
attack on Ukraine, while other EU na-
tions plan on rationing natural gas or 
turning on their coal plants. 
Instead of leading the world with a 
coherent approach on these issues, 
Washington has been deadlocked in the 
same old, tired politics around climate 
and energy. And as usual, the Amer-
ican people have paid the price. 
They have paid it at the pump with 
incomes that have barely budged in 
this economy. In Colorado, we have 
paid for it in homes incinerated by 
record 
wildfires, 
mountain 
passes 
washed out by mudslides, fields with-
ering in extreme drought that nobody 
has seen for 800 years, the Colorado 
River in crisis, and a galloping fear 
that the American West will somehow 
be 
unrecognizable 
to 
our 
grand-
children. 
When this deal fell apart 10 days ago 
or so, whenever it was, my heart was 
broken as a result of it, because I 
thought about what Colorado has been 
going through. And I thought about—I 
had to call and explain to my 22-year- 
old and 21-year-old and 17-year-old 
daughters that once again we had 
failed. 
And their sense of disbelief, of incre-
dulity—which, by the way, I think is 
shared with every single member of 
their 
generation 
in 
this 
country, 
whether they are Democrats or wheth-
er they are Republicans or independ-
ents or if they don’t even know what 
political party they are in. How can 
you not deal with this? How can you 
place this burden on us? 
And if we pass this bill, we are going 
to be able to look the next generation 
straight in the eye and say: We are ac-
tually living up to our responsibility to 
you, at least with respect to climate. 
And that fills me with joy. And that is 
the reason to support this bill and feel 
good about it. 
We can’t afford another 10 years of 
dysfunction on these issues. This tran-
sition should have started 25 years 
ago—25 years ago. 
And in my opinion, we urgently need 
a plan, an energy policy that secures 
the energy our economy needs and re-
lentlessly lowers climate pollution. 
In other words, we need a plan for 
clean energy independence. And we can 
start by being honest about where we 
are; I think that is really important. 
Today, 60 percent of our power gen-
eration comes from fossil fuel; only 20 
percent comes from renewables. Over 90 
percent—90 percent of our transpor-
tation relies on fossil fuels, and less 
than 3 percent uses electricity. Across 
the economy, 80 percent of primary en-
ergy consumption still comes from fos-
sil fuel. Renewables are just 12 percent. 
We have made some progress, but to 
hit our emissions targets, renewables 
have to scale from 12 percent today to 
at least 60 percent by 2050. 
That is why, even under the most 
ambitious projections, some fossil fuels 
will likely remain in our energy mix 
for decades, even through 2050. Don’t 
take my word for it; that is not me 
saying it. These projections are from 
the National Academy of Sciences, the 
International 
Energy 
Agency, 
and 
Princeton. And that is the reality that 
they confront us with. 
So when I hear politicians and others 
whip up Twitter with promises to re-
ject every permit for new infrastruc-
ture, they ignore this reality. And I 
worry that we cede the scientific high 
ground to critics of climate action, 
who then paint climate advocates as 
disconnected or deluded or even dan-
gerous to the economy. And the only 
thing that wins is our fossil fuels. The 
only thing that wins is coal. 
And I worry sometimes that these 
claims also repel the very Americans 
we need to support our energy transi-
tion. If our position in the short term 
is to oppose every new piece of infra-
structure, we are essentially forcing 
America to choose between scarcity 
and higher prices, to choose between 
either less energy or higher prices. 
I was in Belgium and, with our col-
league CHRIS COONS, met with the dep-
uty prime minister there who said—we 
were on our way to Scotland for the 
climate conference, and he said: We 
have to meet these climate targets. We 
have to meet these climate targets in 
2050. 
And then he said: But I don’t know 
how we are going to meet them and not 
lose the middle class. 
And I said: What do you mean by 
that? And he said: I don’t know how we 
are going to meet them and not have 
yellow vests break out all over Europe. 
And we are seeing that now. We are 
seeing where Putin has cut off Russian 
oil and Russian gas because of his inva-
sion of Ukraine—the challenges that it 
creates in democratic societies when it 
comes to energy. There is no country 
in the world better positioned on this 
question, better positioned to lead this 
transition to clean energy than the 
United States of America. 
There is not a country in Europe; 
there is not a country in the Middle 
East. China is not better positioned 
than we are on this. We are the best po-
sitioned country in the world to lead 
this transition. 
In fact, I think we are the only coun-
try in the world that can lead this 
transition—which, by the way, is why 
it was such a tragedy when it looked 10 
days ago like this bill wasn’t going 
anywhere, because then the rest of the 
world looks at us and says: Why should 
we do anything if the country that is 
most capable of being able to do this 
can’t do it? 
And what I want to assure you is 
that these outcomes of scarcity or 
higher prices, neither of those out-
comes are going to support the broad 
and durable support that we need to be 
able to not just pass climate policy but 
keep it the law of the land and make 
sure that it lasts until the next genera-
tion of Americans can pick it up from 
us and say: Thank you for putting us in 
a decent position; we are going to fin-
ish the job. 
And then if we can’t pass this bill 
and we can’t make progress on climate 
change, then what we have, instead, is 
our current policy, which is the status 
quo, which drives up prices, is bad for 
our national security, and is terrible at 
reducing emissions. That is where we 
are today. That is why coal is up, as I 
said, during the Biden administration. 
For a successful transition, we have 
got to smooth the path with domestic 
energy production now to stabilize 
prices and bridge our way to a clean 
energy economy tomorrow. And to do 
that, we need every tool on the table. 
This means deploying renewables 
like wind and solar, which my State 
has led in. We need to do it at record 
rates. We need to invest in next-gen-
eration technology from carbon cap-
ture to hydrogen to advanced nuclear.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4031 
August 4, 2022 
That means we need to recognize the 
role that natural gas has played in our 
transition. Over the last 15 years, re-
placing coal with natural gas has ac-
counted for 60 percent of our national 
carbon reductions, and that is really 
good. But we need to do a lot better be-
cause the time is ticking. And now we 
have the opportunity, because of this 
bill, to secure America’s position as 
the global standard for production— 
modeled on our example in Colorado, 
where we passed the first law to cap-
ture fugitive methane when Senator 
HICKENLOOPER
was our Governor—by 
driving down methane pollution and 
strengthening cleanup and monitoring 
across the supply chain. 
The last thing we should accept is 
the leaking pipes that the status quo 
allows when we have tools available to 
do better. 
And we can’t accept the painful price 
shocks that the American people have 
to bear because of our lack of a coher-
ent energy policy. 
Fortunately, this bill lays the foun-
dation for a responsible energy policy 
for the country, and it has the largest 
investment to fight climate change in 
the Nation’s history. And it is full of 
proposals I have worked on for years, 
proposals to rapidly deploy clean en-
ergy and to provide industry the long- 
term certainty it needs, to boost Amer-
ican manufacturing for wind and solar 
and batteries to power electric vehicles 
and our energy grid, to invest $14 bil-
lion to help rural communities transi-
tion from fossil fuels, along with over 
$25 billion for environmentally friendly 
farming, 
conservation, 
and 
forest 
health. 
We also have an opportunity in this 
bill to address the drought that is rav-
aging the American West and to do it 
in a way that measurably improves the 
situation of the Colorado River Basin, 
reflects the interest of the people of my 
State and other States in the Upper 
Basin, and actually deals, finally, with 
the long-term causes of the crisis that 
we face. 
When you add it all up, this bill 
would put us on track to reduce carbon 
pollution 40 percent by the end of the 
decade. That is light years ahead of 
where we would be without it. 
But even if you don’t care about cli-
mate change, you should still like this 
bill because it lowers costs for families. 
How does it do that? 
By increasing the supply of American 
energy with a responsible approach 
while reducing demand for oil and gas 
by putting more renewables and elec-
tric vehicles on the market. 
According to a recent study, this bill 
would reduce the average family’s elec-
tricity bill by hundreds of dollars a 
year. From my perspective, as I said, 
this transition should have started 25 
years ago, and we can’t wait any 
longer. Now is the moment to act. 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine should 
finally rid America and our allies of 
the delusion that we can continue to 
rely on foreign dictators for our energy 
needs. It should remind us how foolish 
we have been to surrender the lifeblood 
of our economy to the whims of ty-
rants. 
So nearly 50 years after the 1973 oil 
crisis, let’s make this the year that we 
finally pass a coherent plan for Amer-
ica’s energy independence. Let’s finally 
organize our thinking and advance a 
plan that liberates us from foreign en-
ergy and tackles the threat of climate 
change head-on. 
And while we are at it, let’s reforge 
the engine of American manufacturing 
to produce the clean energy we need 
and to create thousands of good-paying 
jobs along the way. 
Let’s support our European allies by 
exporting cleaner American energy so 
they don’t have to rely on coal or Rus-
sian gas to heat their homes through 
the winter. 
There is no country in the world bet-
ter prepared than the United States to 
lead this effort. And this bill will do 
more than anything we have ever done 
to strengthen our hand in this regard. 
In another era, a proposal like this 
would have received 70 votes on the 
Senate floor. Every provision in here is 
a victory for common sense and a vic-
tory for the American people over spe-
cial interests and the status quo. 
Frankly, I don’t know how many peo-
ple can go home and say they voted 
against a balanced approach to achieve 
energy 
independence, 
fight 
climate 
change, and lower costs for families at 
this moment in our history. 
I don’t know how you would go home 
and say they voted to preserve tax 
loopholes for hedge fund managers and 
billion-dollar 
corporations 
that 
no 
American family can even imagine as 
they are paying the rates of taxation 
that they are paying or how they voted 
to let pharmaceutical companies con-
tinue to gouge the American people in-
stead of letting Medicare negotiate on 
their behalf; how they voted against re-
ducing our deficit by $300 billion. 
But that is the choice we have in 
front of us. To me, it is a choice that is 
obvious. We have got to pass this bill. 
We need to seize the moment to lower 
costs for the American people, to make 
our Tax Code a little fairer, to secure 
our energy independence, and spark a 
new era of clean energy manufacturing 
and innovation to support our allies 
and lead the world in a fight against 
climate change and, hopefully, hope-
fully, hopefully, leave something a lit-
tle bit better for the next generation of 
Americans. 
I thank my colleague from New Jer-
sey for his patience. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
was happy to listen to my colleague 
from Colorado’s erudite exposition of 
what the opportunity is before us and 
what it means for the American people, 
and so I very much appreciate it. 
TRIBUTE TO KEITH ROACHFORD 
Mr. President, I come to the floor 
today for a very important reason. I 
rise not to introduce a bill nor to ask 
my colleagues for unanimous consent. 
No. 
I am here for one simple reason, and 
I want to make sure that the C–SPAN 
cameras are capturing this moment for 
posterity. 
I come to the floor today to honor 
Keith Roachford, a member of my staff 
who has faithfully served the State of 
New Jersey, the U.S. Senate, and the 
United States of America for more 
than 35 years. 
As you can see from Keith’s face, it is 
clear that he had no idea this was hap-
pening. We told him he was coming for 
another reason, and I don’t think we 
would have gotten him otherwise. 
But, nonetheless, I rise today be-
cause, after 35 years and 18 Congresses, 
Keith is retiring from the Senate, and 
as result, I wanted to come to the floor 
to send him off with a tribute befitting 
his legendary career. 
A native son of Willingboro, NJ, 
Keith has served not one, not two but 
four U.S. Senators for the Garden 
State. He is the very definition of insti-
tutional knowledge, and countless fel-
low staff members can attest to his ex-
perience, which has saved the day on 
more than one occasion. 
Keith has sometimes said that he has 
been here so long he came with the fur-
niture. It is a classic Keith line, a 
glimpse not only into his sense of 
humor but also his view of how staff 
work behind the scenes gets things 
done. 
Now, that may be the case, but 
today, Keith, I rise to shine a spotlight 
on your illustrious career. 
To start, I would like to share some 
of the stories that his colleagues have 
sent me: 
Keith has not only been a mentor to me, 
he’s also been a friend to anyone lucky 
enough to come into contact with him. 
When I think of Keith, the words that 
come to mind are helpful, generous, thought-
ful—a patient and understanding team play-
er. 
Another one said: 
He is so kind to everyone, from interns to 
the Chief of Staff, and is always—always— 
willing to share his knowledge with others. 
So it brings me immense joy to speak 
these words into the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD so that, like Keith’s legacy, 
they may stand the test of time. 
But beyond his accolades, beyond his 
track record and sterling reputation, 
Keith, at heart, is a humble man. I 
know it isn’t easy for him to be sitting 
here, listening to me shower praise on 
him, but to that I say: Well, you are 
still on the payroll so you will have to 
bear with it. 
But above all, Keith is a family man, 
a devoted husband to his wife Sandy 
and an incredible father to his beloved 
children, Rick, Daniel, and Lauren. 
He is a man that every day for the 
last 36 years has braved the brutal belt-
way traffic to come into work in the 
Hart Senate Office Building. And he is 
a man that every weekend has made a 
similar trip with his family to attend

services at St. George’s Episcopal 
Church here in DC. 
Keith credits his faith for guiding 
him throughout his life, and he would 
be the first to tell you that it has been 
a moral compass for him, season after 
political season. But as the Book of 
James asks, ‘‘What good is someone 
who says they have faith but does not 
have works?’’ 
Fret not. In addition to his duties as 
senior warden of the Vestry at St. 
George’s, Keith takes the time to give 
back to his community. He is a mem-
ber of the Brotherhood of St. Andrew. 
He serves as the secretary of the con-
vention of the Episcopal Diocese of 
Washington, and he is a Boy Scout 
leader. 
At every opportunity, he goes out of 
his way to give back. It is a trait he 
learned growing up. As the son and 
grandson of public servants, Keith was 
taught from an early age that service 
to others is the highest calling. 
His grandfather was a transit oper-
ator for the city of New York, while his 
father, a veteran of the U.S. Army and 
the New Jersey Army National Guard, 
worked for the sanitation department 
for 37 years. It is no surprise, then, 
that Keith has followed in their foot-
steps. He is a throwback to a previous 
era, one where individuals spent years, 
if not decades, working for the same 
organization. 
I know Keith never intended to spend 
36 years working in the Senate. He 
used to joke with colleagues that he 
came to Washington fresh out of the 
college just to try it out. But in the 
process, he has gone from working as a 
constituent liaison, to mail director, to 
deputy chief of staff, and so much 
more. 
Today, Keith is an indispensable re-
source for our legislative staff. He is 
our go-to person for appropriations, de-
fense, veterans’ issues, homeland secu-
rity, and the budget. 
He has had a hand in passing count-
less initiatives for our office, from sup-
porting community development finan-
cial institutions to shoring up supply 
chains and expanding senior housing, 
to inserting provisions in the PACT 
Act—that is how we got him here, tell-
ing him that is what we were going to 
talk about—that addresses the needs of 
veterans suffering from Gulf war ill-
ness. 
Keith has had a hand in far too many 
legislative wins to count, but suffice to 
say, the legend of Keith Roachford has 
led to what we call ‘‘the Roachford 
Rule,’’ which is simple: With every ap-
propriations letter I sign on to, with 
every bill I cosponsor, for something to 
pass the Roachford Rule, it needs to 
have a tangible benefit for New Jersey 
families. 
Much like the man it is named after, 
the Roachford Rule is about connecting 
what we do here in DC to the people 
whose lives it affects back home. 
Long after Keith has left the Senate, 
his rule will live on, a testament to his 
relentless pursuit of good government, 
a trademark for a public servant de-
voted to the common good, a namesake 
that all of us in this Chamber would do 
well to emulate. 
I will end with this: Last March, I 
came to this floor to rebuke the words 
that a colleague used in reference to 
the January 6 attack. I won’t use the 
time to rehash what I said; instead, I 
will use this time to once again lift up 
the bravery and the courage of the man 
who compelled me to act. 
Late one night, Keith sent me an 
email that outlined the pain and the 
outrage he felt after reading our col-
league’s comments. In personal terms, 
he relayed how his entire life he has 
had to endure—in overt and covert 
ways—the harmful legacy of racism 
and the stain of White supremacy. 
Knowing Keith, it could not have 
been easy to type that message to his 
boss, a sitting U.S. Senator. 
But as I said in that speech, there 
comes a time when you either ruffle 
some feathers and speak the truth or 
you fail to do justice to the values you 
hold dear. 
The U.S. Senate is a better institu-
tion, and I am certainly a better Sen-
ator, for having Keith Roachford work 
in these Halls. He is man of principle, 
a man of God, a man who has put every 
ounce of his being into the work that 
New Jerseyans have sent us here to do. 
He is the first person to tell you that 
he is not perfect, the first to say that 
he has certainly seen it all over 36 long 
years of service, but, by God, I cannot 
help but feel so thankful, so grateful 
that we have been blessed with his 
presence. He is a calm and steady hand 
that has helped guide our office since 
2006. 
He is the quiet one, the one who 
keeps his powder dry and plays the 
long game; the one who never loses 
sight of the ultimate goal, which is to 
improve the lives of hard-working 
American families. 
John Madison, one of the Framers of 
our Constitution, once said: 
If men were angels, no government would 
be needed. 
I have never met an angel, but I have 
worked alongside Keith Roachford for 
16 of those 36 years. He has served with 
me longer than any other of the U.S. 
Senators he has worked with. And it is 
why I can truthfully say without pause 
or equivocation that Keith Roachford 
is truly doing God’s work here on 
Earth. 
When Keith first mentioned to me 
that he was thinking of leaving, he said 
the most incredible thing. He said: 
You know, Senator, it’s just that with the 
pandemic and with work from home, I’ve 
just gotten to spend more time with Sandy 
and the kids. 
We don’t want to wait any longer to get 
started. 
We make breakfast and we take walks. . . . 
I just don’t want to wait any longer to do 
that. 
That is Keith in a nutshell. That is 
who he is. So I want to congratulate 
Keith on an incredible 36 years of Sen-
ate service. We are going to miss you, 
certainly so. But to you, to Sandy, and 
to your three children, we wish you all 
the best on a well-deserved retirement. 
Thank you, Keith. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

EDUCATIONAL 
ASSISTANCE 
BY DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AF-
FAIRS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Subsection (d) of section 
3680A of title 38, United States Code, is 
amended to read as follows: 
‘‘(d)(1) The Secretary shall not approve the 
enrollment of any eligible veteran, not al-
ready enrolled, in any course for any period 
during which the Secretary finds that more 
than 85 percent of the students enrolled in 
the course are having all or part of their tui-
tion, fees, or other charges paid to or for 
them by the educational institution or by 
the Department of Veterans Affairs under 
this title or under chapter 1606 of title 10, ex-
cept with respect to tuition, fees, or other 
charges that are paid under a payment plan 
at an educational institution that the Sec-
retary determines has a history of offering 
payment plans that are completed not later 
than 180 days after the end of the applicable 
term, quarter, or semester. 
‘‘(2) The Secretary may waive the require-
ments of paragraph (1), in whole or in part, 
if the Secretary determines, pursuant to reg-
ulations which the Secretary shall prescribe, 
it to be in the interest of the eligible veteran 
and the Federal Government. 
‘‘(3)(A) The Secretary shall establish a 
process by which an educational institution 
may request a review of a determination 
that the educational institution does not 
meet the requirements of paragraph (1). 
‘‘(B) An educational institution that re-
quests a review under subparagraph (A)— 
‘‘(i) shall request the review not later than 
30 days after the start of the term, quarter, 
or semester for which the determination de-
scribed in subparagraph (A) applies; and 
‘‘(ii) may include any information that the 
educational institution believes the Depart-
ment should have taken into account when 
making the determination, including with 
respect to any mitigating circumstances. 
‘‘(C) The Under Secretary of Benefits shall 
issue an initial decision for each review re-
quested under subparagraph (A) by not later 
than 30 days after the date of the request, to 
the extent feasible. 
‘‘(D) An educational institution may re-
quest the Secretary to review the decision by 
the Under Secretary under subparagraph (C). 
The Secretary shall review each decision so 
requested and, pursuant to such review, shall 
issue a final decision sustaining, modifying, 
or overturning the decision by the Under 
Secretary. 
‘‘(E) The Secretary shall carry out this 
paragraph without regard to any review 
process carried out by the Secretary under 
chapter 51 of this title. 
‘‘(4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any 
course offered by an educational institution 
if— 
‘‘(A) the majority of courses offered by the 
educational institution are approved under 
section 3672 or 3675 of this title; and 
‘‘(B) the total number of veterans and per-
sons receiving assistance under this title or 
under chapter 1606 of title 10 who are en-
rolled in such institution equals 35 percent 
or less of the total student enrollment at 
such institution (computed separately for 
the main campus and any branch or exten-
sion of such institution). 
‘‘(5)(A) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to 
any course offered by an educational institu-
tion if— 
‘‘(i) the majority of courses offered by the 
educational institution are approved under

sons receiving assistance under this title or 
under chapter 1606 of title 10 who are en-
rolled in such institution equals 35 percent 
or less of the total student enrollment at 
such institution (computed separately for 
the main campus and any branch or exten-
sion of such institution). 
‘‘(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), on 
a case by case basis, the Secretary may 
apply paragraph (1) with respect to any 
course otherwise covered by such subpara-
graph if the Secretary has reason to believe 
that the enrollment of veterans and persons 
described in clause (ii) of such subparagraph 
may be in excess of 85 percent of the total 
student enrollment in such course. 
‘‘(6) The Secretary shall ensure that an 
educational institution that meets the re-
quirements of paragraph (4) or (5) submits in-
formation to the Secretary on a biennial 
basis to verify meeting such requirements. 
During such biennial period in which an edu-
cational institution is covered by such 
verification, the Secretary may not require 
the educational institution to submit infor-
mation with respect to meeting the require-
ments of paragraph (1). 
‘‘(7) Paragraph (1) shall not apply with re-
spect to the enrollment of a veteran— 
‘‘(A) in a program of education for which 
fewer than 10 students are having all or part 
of their tuition, fees, or other charges paid 
to or for them by the educational institution

DECISION 
Matter of: United States Department of Ag-
riculture—Applicability of the Congres-
sional Review Act to the 2021 Updates to 
the Thrifty Food Plan 
File: B–33732 
Date: July 28, 2022 
DIGEST 
The United States Department of Agri-
culture (USDA) issued a document entitled 
Thrifty Food Plan, 2021 (2021 TFP). The 2021 
TFP updates the market baskets used to de-
termine the value of Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to pur-
chase food from retail stores. 
The Congressional Review Act (CRA) re-
quires that before a rule can take effect, an 
agency must submit the rule to both the 
House of Representatives and the Senate as 
well as the Comptroller General, and pro-
vides procedures for congressional review 
where Congress may disapprove of rules. We 
conclude the 2021 TFP meets the definition 
of a rule under the CRA and no CRA excep-
tion applies. Therefore, the 2021 TFP is sub-
ject to the requirement that it be submitted 
to Congress.

usda.gov/TFP (last visited Jul. 12, 2022). We 
received a request for a decision as to wheth-
er the 2021 TFP is a rule for purposes of the 
Congressional Review Act (CRA). Letter 
from Senator Tillis to the Comptroller Gen-
eral (Oct. 27, 2021). For the reasons discussed 
below, we conclude that the 2021 TFP is a 
rule and thus subject to the submission re-
quirement of CRA. 
Our practice when rendering decisions is to 
contact the relevant agencies to obtain their 
legal views on the subject of the request. 
GAO, Procedures and Practices for Legal De-
cisions and Opinions, GA0–06–1064SP (Wash-
ington, D.C.: Sept. 2006), available at https://

ingly, we reached out to USDA to obtain the 
agency’s legal views. Letter from Managing 
Associate General Counsel, GAO, to General 
Counsel, USDA (Dec. 15, 2021 ). We received 
USDA’s response on February 11, 2022. Letter 
from Associate General Counsel, USDA, to 
Managing Associate General Counsel, GAO 
(Feb. 11, 2022) (Response Letter). 
BACKGROUND 
Thrifty Food Plan 
The Thrifty Food Plan is defined by the 
Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 as a diet re-
quired to feed a family of four persons. See 7 
U.S.C. 2012(u). The Act uses the cost of this 
diet as the basis for allotments to house-
holds regardless of their actual size. Id. 
These allotments take the form of Supple-
mental 
Nutrition 
Assistance 
Program 
(SNAP) benefits to purchase food from retail 
stores. See 7 U.S.C. § 2013. In order for a 
household to qualify for SNAP benefits its 
gross income cannot exceed the poverty line. 
See 7 U.S.C. § 2014(c). 
The 2018 Farm Bill amended the Thrifty 
Food Plan to require USDA to ‘‘re-evaluate 
and publish the market baskets of the 
thrifty food plan based on current food 
prices, food composition data, consumption 
patterns, and dietary guidance’’ by 2022 and 
at 5-year intervals thereafter. Agriculture 
Improvement Act of 2018 (2018 Farm Bill), 
Pub. L. No. 115–334, title IV, § 4002, 132 Stat. 
4490, 4624 (Dec. 20, 2018). On August 16, 2021, 
USDA 
published 
the 
2021 
TFP. 
USDA, 
Thrifty Food Plan, 2021 (August 2021), avail-
able at https://FNS.usda.gov/TFP (last vis-
ited Jul. 12, 2022). The 2021 TFP is the USDA 
update to the TFP market baskets required 
by the 2018 Farm Bill. 
The 2021 TFP describes the approach and 
methods used in reevaluating the Thrifty 
Food Plan. Prior to the 2021 reevaluation, 
the market basket prices were last updated 
in 2006. 2021 TFP at 30. The result of the 2021 
reevaluation is that the monthly cost of a 
market basket for the reference family of 
four is $835.57. 2021 TFP at 34. This represents 
an increase of $145.19 (in 2021 dollars) from 
the previous market basket price. See id. at 
34–35. The changes to the maximum SNAP 
benefit allotments based on the 2021 TFP 
were effective beginning October 1, 2021. 2021 
TFP at 51. 
The Congressional Review Act 
CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen con-
gressional oversight of agency rulemaking, 
requires federal agencies to submit a report 
on each new rule to both houses of Congress 
and to the Comptroller General for review 
before a rule can take effect. 5 U.S.C. 
§ 801(a)(1)(A). The report must contain a copy 
of the rule, ‘‘a concise general statement re-
lating to the rule,’’ and the rule’s proposed 
effective date. Id. An agency can find for 
good cause that notice and public procedure 
are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary 
to the public interest and the rule will then 
take effect at a time the agency determines. 
5 U.S.C. § 808(2). Each house of Congress is to 
provide the report on the rule to the chair-
man and ranking member of each standing 
committee with jurisdiction. 5 U.S.C. § 801 
(a)(1)(C). CRA allows Congress to review and 
disapprove rules issued by federal agencies 
for a period of 60 days using special proce-
dures. See 5 U.S.C. § 802. If a resolution of 
disapproval is enacted, then the new rule has 
no force or effect. 5 U.S.C. § 801 (b)(1). 
CRA adopts the definition of rule under the 
Administrative 
Procedure 
Act 
(APA), 
5 
U.S.C. § 551(4), which states that a rule is 
‘‘the whole or a part of an agency statement 
of general or particular applicability and fu-
ture effect designed to implement, interpret, 
or prescribe law or policy or describing the 
organization, procedure, or practice require-
ments of an agency.’’ 5 U.S.C. § 804(3). CRA 
excludes three categories of rules from cov-
erage: (1) rules of particular applicability; (2) 
rules relating to agency management or per-
sonnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, 
procedure, or practice that do not substan-
tially affect the rights or obligations of non- 
agency parties. Id. 
USDA did not submit a CRA report to Con-
gress or the Comptroller General on the 2021 
TFP. In its response to us, USDA stated the 
2021 TFP was not subject to CRA because it 
was not a rule within the meaning of the 
APA or CRA. Response Letter, at 3–4. USDA 
also stated that it met the good cause excep-
tion under the CRA, and, thus, was not sub-
ject to the CRA’s submission requirements. 
See id. at 7–8. For the reasons explained 
below, we conclude that the 2021 TFP is a 
rule under the CRA, does not meet any of the 
exceptions that would exclude the rule from 
coverage, and is, therefore, subject to the 
submission requirement of CRA. 
ANALYSIS 
To determine whether the 2021 TFP is a 
rule subject to review under CRA, we first 
address whether the 2021 TFP meets the APA 
definition of a rule. As explained below, we 
conclude that it does. The next step, then, is 
to determine whether any of the CRA excep-
tions apply. We conclude that they do not. 
The 2021 TFP meets the APA definition of 
a rule upon which the CRA relies. First, the 
2021 TFP is an agency statement as it was 
issued by USDA to update market basket 
prices that were last revised in 2006. See 2021 
TFP at 1. Second, the 2021 TFP is of future 
effect, as it provides guidance for new mar-
ket basket prices on which SNAP benefits 
will be based going forward, effective Octo-
ber 1, 2021. Id. at 51. See B–316048, Apr. 17, 
2008 (finding that an agency action was of fu-
ture effect because the action was prospec-
tive in nature since it was concerned with 
policy considerations for the future rather 
than the evaluation of past or present con-
duct). Finally, the 2021 TFP is designed to 
implement, interpret, or prescribe law or 
policy as it implements the new market bas-
kets as required by the Food and Nutrition 
Act of 2008 and the 2018 Farm Bill. 2021 TFP 
at 4–6. 
In its Response Letter, USDA asserts the 
2021 TFP is exempt from the APA’s rule 
making provisions because it relates to 
agency management and benefits, and, con-
sequently, it is not a rule. Response Letter 
at 4. We disagree with this rationale. Specifi-
cally, USDA notes that the APA requires no-
tice and comment for all rules ‘‘except to the 
extent that there is involved . . . a matter 
relating to agency management or personnel 
or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, 
or contracts.’’ [Emphasis removed.] Response 
Letter, at 4 (quoting 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2)). 
USDA argues that ‘‘evaluating market bas-
kets based on current food prices is a matter 
relating to ‘agency management’ of [ ] SNAP 
and relates to SNAP ‘benefits.’ ’’ Response 
Letter, at 4. However, the language USDA 
cites in 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2) pertains to an ex-
ception to the APA’s rule making process, 
not to the definition of a rule. Even assum-
ing the 2021 TFP is exempt from the APA’s 
notice and comment requirement, that does 
not mean it is not a rule as defined by 5 
U.S.C. 551(4). See B–323772, Sept. 4, 2012 (not-
ing the CRA is intended to include within its 
purview, almost all rules that an agency 
issues, not only those that must be promul-
gated according to the APA’s notice and 
comment requirements). It should also be 
noted that 7 U.S.C. § 2013(c) specifically di-
rects USDA to promulgate regulations re-
lated to SNAP ‘‘in accordance with the pro-
cedures set forth in section 553 of title 5.’’ As 
discussed, the 2021 TFP is an agency state-
ment of future effect designed to implement 
policy, and, therefore, meets the definition 
of a rule. 
USDA contends that Congress did not re-
quire the 2021 TFP to be issued as a rule be-
cause Congress did not specifically require 
the 2021 TFP to be subject to CRA. Response 
Letter, at 5. We disagree with this interpre-
tation of CRA. We conduct our analysis 
under CRA which requires all rules to follow 
the procedures outlined in 5 U.S.C. § 801. All 
rules are subject to the procedures required 
by CRA, whether or not Congress specifically 
requires it, before they can take effect. 5 
U.S.C. § 801. 
USDA also argues that Congress had con-
structive notice that the 2021 TFP would in-
crease SNAP benefits and, as a result, USDA 
was not required to provide formal CRA no-
tice to Congress. Response Letter, at 5–7. 
However, constructive notice is not an ex-
ception to CRA notice procedures. As dis-
cussed above, CRA is a method of congres-
sional oversight of agency rulemaking. CRA 
requires agencies to submit a report to Con-
gress about the rule. 5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(1)(A). 
The submission of this report initiates the 
congressional review process which can lead 
to Congress disapproving a rule. 5 U.S.C. § 801 
(b)(1). It is the report that triggers the CRA 
review process. As a result, constructive no-
tice of a rule is not the same as submitting 
a formal report as required by CRA. While 
there are exceptions for waiving a delay in 
the effective date of a rule, 5 U.S.C. § 808, 
there are no exceptions for submitting a re-
port. 
Having concluded that the 2021 TFP meets 
the APA definition of a rule, we now turn to 
whether any of the three CRA exceptions 
apply. We also address USDA’s argument 
that the good cause exception provides an 
exemption from the CRA’s submission re-
quirement. As explained below, we conclude 
they do not. 
First, the 2021 TFP is not a rule of par-
ticular applicability. Rules of particular ap-
plicability are addressed to specific, identi-
fied entities. See Administrative Conference 
of the United States, Miscellaneous State-
ments, 39 Fed. Reg. 4846, 4849 (Feb. 7, 1974) 
(explaining that a rule of general applica-
bility is one with an open class but a rule of 
particular applicability is limited to those 
named). The 2021 TFP applies to all families 
whose income falls below the poverty line 
and is not addressed to specific, identified 
entities. Therefore, it is a rule of general ap-
plicability and not a rule of particular appli-
cability. 
Second, this is not a rule relating to agen-
cy management or personnel. A rule relates 
to agency management or personnel if it ap-
plies to agency employees and not to outside 
parties. See e.g. B–331324, Oct. 22, 2019 (deter-
mining that 5 U.S.C. § 804(3)(b) does not apply 
when the rule deals with actions a bank 
should take and not agency management or 
personnel). The 2021 TFP deals with the

amount of SNAP benefits for qualifying fam-
ilies and, the market basket costs in the 2021 
TFP apply broadly to the contiguous 48 
states and the District of Columbia. 
Finally, the 2021 TFP substantially im-
pacts the rights of non-agency parties be-
cause it has an effect on qualifying families 
by granting increased benefit allotments de-
signed for them to obtain a more nutritious 
diet. 
USDA contends the 2021 TFP meets the 
good cause exception under the CRA, and, 
therefore, USDA was not required to follow 
the CRA’s submission requirements. Re-
sponse Letter, at 7–8. In its response USDA 
stated that good cause existed to issue the 
2021 TFP with an effective date in August 
2021. Id. at 8. USDA further stated that this 
excepted it from carrying out formal CRA 
notice before the effective date. Id. While 
CRA does not provide an emergency excep-
tion from its procedural requirements to 
submit rules for congressional review, CRA 
and APA address an agency’s need to take 
emergency action without delay. Agencies 
can waive the required delay in effective 
date requirement when an agency for ‘‘good 
cause’’ finds (and incorporates the finding 
and a brief statement of reasons in the rule 
issued) that notice and public procedure are 
‘‘impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to 
the public interest.’’ 5 U.S.C §§ 553(b), 808(2). 
Therefore, an agency can provide for a rule 
to take effect immediately while still com-
plying with the agency’s statutory obliga-
tion to submit the rule to Congress for re-
view. Asserting a good cause exception does 
not serve to waive the CRA’s submission re-
quirements all together. Notably, the 2021 
TFP did not incorporate a finding or state-
ment of the reasons why there is good cause 
for an exception to the CRA’s procedural 
rules to submit the 2021 TFP for congres-
sional review, nor did the 2021 TFP include 
an immediate effective date. Therefore, 
USDA did not properly apply the good cause 
exception. 
Thus, we conclude that none of the three 
exceptions that would exclude the rule from 
CRA coverage, or the good cause exception 
apply, and the 2021 TFP is subject to the sub-
mission requirement of CRA. 
CONCLUSION 
The 2021 TFP is a rule for purposes of CRA 
because it meets the APA definition of a rule 
and no CRA exception applies. Therefore, 
even if exempt from the APA notice-and- 
comment requirements, the 2021 TFP is sub-

TRIBUTE TO JAMES BOLLICH 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, James 
Bollich was born on April 15, 1921, in 
Mowata, LA. As a young man, he 
joined the U.S. Army Air Corps and 
participated in Louisiana maneuvers in 
1941. 
In 1942, he was deployed to the Phil-
ippines, and 18 days after his arrival, 
Congress voted to enter World War II. 
Mr. Bollich served as an infantryman 
on the island of Luzon and fought val-
iantly during the Battle of Bataan. He 
was captured by Imperial Japanese 
forces and was forced to endure the Ba-
taan Death March. Mr. Bollich later 
spent more than 3 years as a prisoner 
of war in Mukden, Manchuria. On Au-
gust 15, 1945, his 24th birthday, Mr. 
Bollich and his fellow survivors were 
freed by the Russian Army. 
After 
the 
war, 
Mr. 
Bollich 
transitioned into civilian life, and at-
tended college at the University of 
Southwest Louisiana. He and his wife 
Celia raised their family in Lafayette, 
LA, and worked as an exploration geol-
ogist until his retirement in 1986. He 
was the author of several books includ-
ing ‘‘A Soldier’s Story,’’ where he de-
tailed his time as a serviceman and a 
prisoner of war. 
Mr. Bollich received many com-
mendations during his military service 
including the Purple Heart, Bronze 
Star medal, Prisoner of War medal, 
WWII Victory medal, Presidential Unit 
citation with two oakleaf clusters, 
American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pa-
cific medal with 2 bronze stars, Army 
Good Conduct medal, American De-
fense medal with one bronze star, Phil-
ippine Presidents badge, Philippine De-
fense 
medal, 
Philippine 
Liberation 
medal, and the Philippine Independ-
ence medal. 
In one of our Nation’s darkest times, 
James Bollich answered the call and 
served this country with esteem and 
dignity. Mr. Bollich was an American 
hero and should be honored as such. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DREW TROJANOWSKI 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the service and ca-
reer of Mr. Drew Trojanowski, an Army 
veteran of Phoenix, AZ. He, with honor 
and courage, has dedicated his life to 
service to our great Nation and con-
tinues to work to ensure veterans are 
connected with their communities and 
needed resources. 
Drew had many accomplishments 
while serving in the U.S. Army from 
2006 to 2015. He was a sniper, achieved 
the rank of staff sergeant, and de-
ployed to Iraq and Afghanistan to sup-
port the Global War on Terrorism. He 
also served as a combat adviser to for-
eign militaries while coaching them on 
operations, tactics, intelligence, and 
civil affairs. Drew concluded his mili-
tary career serving in the Arizona 
Army National Guard, where he aided 
in developing long-range plans for the 
Joint Counter Narco-Terrorism Task 
Force. 
In 2015, while searching for a way to 
continue service after returning from 
Afghanistan, Drew became active in 
the veteran space and the Mesa Cham-
ber of Commerce. After identifying a 
void between the business and veteran 
communities, he established the Mesa 
Veterans Program and Mesa Industry 
and Defense Council. This consortium 
has grown to more than 70 aerospace 
and defense companies. 
In 2016, Mr. Trojanowski started 
working 
with 
U.S. 
Senator 
John 
McCain as a military and veteran advo-
cate. As an advocate, he traveled 
throughout Arizona, learning about 
veterans and their service and the chal-
lenges they face post-service. He was 
also the primary contact for Depart-
ment of Defense installations, per-
sonnel, and industry throughout Ari-
zona. 
In December 2016, Senator McCain 
asked Mr. Trojanowski to be his mili-
tary legislative assistant and senior 
policy adviser. In that role, he was at 
the forefront of advocating for reform, 
resources, funding, and benefits that 
our military and veterans earned and 
deserve. 
During 
his 
time 
with 
Senator 
McCain, Mr. Trojanowski helped au-
thor and champion the passage of sig-
nificant legislation impacting Amer-
ican servicemembers, their families, 
and veterans. Drew worked on the VA 
MISSION Act, numerous National De-
fense Authorization Acts, the VA Ap-
peals Modernization Act, the VA Ac-
countability and Whistleblower Protec-
tion Act, the Harry W. Colmery Vet-
erans Educational Assistance Act—also 
known as the Forever G.I. Bill—and 
the Veteran Overmedication and Pre-
vention Act. These bipartisan bills, all 
of which were signed into law, serve as 
examples of Drew’s dedication and 
leadership in the military and veteran 
community. 
In 2018, Mr. Trojanowski joined the 
White House as a Presidentially Com-
missioned Officer and Special Assistant 
to the President on the Domestic Pol-
icy Council. In this role, he oversaw 
the Departments of Veteran Affairs, 
Defense, NASA, and Labor. During his 
tenure, Mr. Trojanowski was the policy 
lead on three Executive orders and 56 
regulations, including the implementa-
tion of the MISSION Act that strength-
ened the nationwide VA healthcare 
system by empowering veterans with 
more healthcare options and the PRE-
VENTS initiative, a national strategy 
for preventing veteran suicide. 
I am honored to recognize Mr. Drew 
Trojanowski’s 
outstanding 
military 
service and continued service to our 
military, veterans, and their families. 
As Mr. Trojanowski begins a new chap-
ter, I do not doubt that he will con-
tinue to be a voice for all those who 
serve.

firm. Upon working with the commu-
nity of El Dorado and seeing the com-
mission’s efforts to preserve the city’s 
history and heritage, the Lakota Group 
nominated the city’s commission for 
the Commission of the Year award. 
The commission received the award 
in July 2022, recognizing its out-
standing achievement, hard work, and 
diligence in preserving this historic 
city in south Arkansas. 
I congratulate the El Dorado Historic 
District Commission on this notable 
award, and I am excited to see how it 
continues working to preserve the 
neighborhoods, businesses, landmarks, 
and other establishments that embody 
the rich history of the community.∑

RECOGNIZING LARRY’S MINI MART 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize Larry’s Mini Mart of Whitley 
City, KY, as the Senate Small Business 
of the Week. 
When Larry Sumner founded Larry’s 
Somerset Oil in 1973, he had no idea it 
would grow into the family business 
that it is today. Larry got his start in 
business when he opened his service 
station in Whitley City. It was there in 
McCreary County that Larry’s children 
watched their father run a business 
that bolstered their home-town com-
munity. As the Sumner children grew 
older, they learned firstshand what it 
meant to devote one’s energy to their 
customers, so it was only natural that 
they inherited their father’s entrepre-
neurial nature. Thus, Larry Sumner’s 
business continues operating today in 
the exact location he moved to in 1976, 
with the Sumner children at the helm 
of operations. 
Today Larry’s Mini Mart, as it is now 
called, is Whitley City’s one stop shop 
for full-service gas, kerosene, and die-
sel. Unlike the days of old, most people 
nowadays pump their own gas and rare-
ly interact with the folks working at 
their local gas stations. That is not the 
case for Larry’s Mini Mart, as they 
carry on the tradition of pumping gas 
for their customers, always doing it 
with a smile. Larry’s is also the local 
stop where folks can drop in to pick up 
cold drinks, snacks, ice, and anything 
else they might need whether in a 
hurry or just for an afternoon excur-
sion. Larry’s Mini Mart even goes be-
yond what a typical service station of-
fers by renting out their extra storage 
space to their loyal customers . 
When the late Larry Sumner first 
opened his business back in the 1970’s, 
he wanted to create a place that was 
more than the average filling station. 
He understood that offering quality 
service and a wide variety of conven-
iences would make his store a success, 
but his dream went beyond those of 
profits. Larry Sumner’s goal was to 
create a place that would foster com-
munity within the town of Whitley 
City. 
When Larry Sumner’s son Mark and 
daughter Marlo took over the business 
in 1998 following their father’s death, 
they stayed true to his mission. Today, 
as it has always been, Larry’s Mini 
Mart is a place where locals can come 
to catch up on the latest news in the 
county, whether that news travels 
through the local paper cir word-of- 
mouth. As is often the case with small 
towns, sometimes it takes a trip down 
to Larry’s just to hear about the go-
ings-on about town, and the late Larry 
Sumner would not have it any other 
way. 
Larry’s has often been recognized for 
the quality service they provide to 
their community. Most recently in 
2020, 
Larry’s 
Mini 
Mart 
received 
McCreary County Chamber of Com-
merce Business of the Month. They 
have also won McCreary County Busi-
ness of the Year numerous times due to 
the charitable spirit of the owners and 
staff. Throughout their years of oper-
ation, Larry’s Mini Mart has supported 
local school systems and all their var-
ious sporting activities. Larry’s has be-
come a well-known for hosting car 
wash fundraisers for various causes 
within their community. Larry’s Mini 
Mart has also contributed to the Ban-
quet of Blessings, a McCreary County 
tradition that provides a free Christ-
mas meal to anyone in need. Larry’s 
has also contributed to the local chap-
ter of Relay for Life, a cancer aware-
ness nonprofit. Moreover, the public li-
brary, the local chapter of Veterans of 
Foreign Wars, the American Legion, 
the McCreary County Chamber of Com-
merce, right down to the McCreary 
County Little League baseball team, 
have all seen support from the fine 
folks at Larry’s Mini Mart. 
Larry’s Mini Mart is known not only 
for their quality service and charitable 
spirit, but they also maintain their 
reputation for being a fantastic place 
to work. Currently, Mark Sumner and 
his wife Stephanie operate Larry’s with 
the help of their daughter Taylor and 
their son Tyler. This family affair fos-
ters a friendly environment, so much 
so that two of Larry’s Mini Mart em-
ployees have worked for the business 
for over 40 years. That type of lon-
gevity clearly shows that Larry’s is not 
your average service station. Larry’s 
Mini Mart is a community institution 
that goes above and beyond to support 
their friends and neighbors, whether it 
be during or outside of their regular 
business hours. Congratulations to the 
Sumner family and entire team at 
Larry’s Mini Mart. I look forward to 
seeing your continued growth and suc-
cess in Kentucky.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–175. A resolution from the House of 
Representatives of the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico expressing its firm support to 
congressional bill H.R. 7409, known as the 
‘‘Territorial Relief Under Sustainable Tran-
sitions for Puerto Rico Act of 2022’’ (Trust 
for Puerto Rico Act of 2022), introduced by 
Congressman Ritchie Torres, that would 
amend the Puerto Rico Oversight, Manage-
ment, 
and 
Economic 
Stability 
Act 
(PROMESA) in order to facilitate the termi-
nation of the Financial Oversight Board 
after certification of a balanced budget for 
two consecutive fiscal years; to the Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Resources. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 764 
Ove the past decades, Puerto Rico’s eco-
nomic growth has experienced a deceleration 
that has resulted in the loss of competition 
in the private sector and a severe financial 
crisis in the governmental sector. 
The Island’s economic recession began in 
2006. However, it should be noted that the fi-
nancial crisis precedes it, because previous 
government 
administrations 
issued 
debt 
amounting to billions of dollars to finance 
budget deficits, thus presenting to the Island 
the illusion of a balanced budget, as provided 
by our Constitution. It is worth noting that 
a $45 billion debt was issued between 2000 and 
2012. Approximately half of the money was 
used to finance budget deficits and to defray 
the government’s payroll expense and spend-
ing. 
We must remember that the financial cri-
sis broke that started during the first decade 
of the 21st century led to the subsequent en-
actment of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Man-
agement, 
and 
Economic 
Stability 
Act 
(PROMESA) and the creation of the Finan-
cial 
Oversight 
Board, 
hereinafter 
the 
‘‘Board,’’ for the purpose of managing Puerto 
Rico’s finances. 
Ever since PROMESA and the Board be-
came effective in 2016, the government of 
Puerto Rico has maneuvered to meet the fi-
nancial requirements imposed within this 
new reality. Under PROMESA, the terri-
torial government must approve a balanced 
budget for four (4) consecutive fiscal years in 
order to require the termination of the 
Board. Given this scenario, it must be noted 
that, since the Board began operations, the 
first balanced budget was approved by the 
current Legislative Assembly for fiscal year 
2021–2022. 
In view of this context, and given the im-
position of an antidemocratic body such as 
the Financial Oversight Board, Congressman 
Ritchie Torres started this initiative to 
amend PROMESA in order to reduce the re-
quired number of balanced budgets from four 
(4) to just two (2). Furthermore, this meas-
ure establishes that the Board shall be ter-
minated 90 days after the certification of the 
second balanced budget. Thus, any ambi-
guity within the statute in effect regarding 
the Board’s termination is eliminated. 
This House of Representatives believes 
that the bill introduced by Congressman 
Ritchie Torres (H.R. 7409, better known as 
‘‘Trust for Puerto Rico Act of 2022’’) provides 
a mechanism to restore power to the people 
of Puerto Rico, and consequently, to its 
democratically elected officials. Liberty and 
democracy are two pillars of our government 
and our goal must be to strengthen them; 
therefore, we are duty-bound to promote and 
support policies aimed at its attainment. It 
is time to raise our voices and join in any ef-
fort that seeks to restore the people of Puer-
to Rico’s control and power over its finances 
as soon as possible. 
For all of the foregoing, this House of Rep-
resentatives expresses its firm support to 
congressional bill H.R. 7409, known as the 
‘‘Territorial Relief Under Sustainable Tran-
sitions for Puerto Rico Act of 2022’’ (Trust 
for Puerto Rico Act of 2022), introduced by 
Congressman Ritchie Torres. This bill would 
amend the Puerto Rico Oversight, Manage-
ment, 
and 
Economic 
Stability 
Act

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4040 
August 4, 2022 
(PROMESA) in order to facilitate the termi-
nation of the Financial Oversight Board 
after the certification of a balanced budget 
for two consecutive fiscal years. 
Be it resolved by the House of Representatives 
of Puerto Rico: 
Section 1.—The House of Representatives 
of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico hereby 
expresses its firm support to congressional 
bill H.R. 7409, known as the ‘‘Territorial Re-
lief Under Sustainable Transitions for Puer-
to Rico Act of 2022’’ (Trust for Puerto Rico 
Act of 2022), introduced by Congressman 
Ritchie Torres, that would amend the Puerto 
Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic 
Stability Act (PROMESA) in order to facili-
tate the termination of the Financial Over-
sight Board after the certification of a bal-
anced budget for two consecutive fiscal 
years. 
Section 2.—A copy of this Resolution shall 
be translated into the English language and 
delivered to the President of the United 
States of America, Joseph R. Biden and the 
leadership of the United States Congress. 
Section 3.—This Resolution shall take ef-
fect upon its approval. 
POM–176. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan urging the adop-
tion of policies that will help lead to energy 
independence and lower energy costs in the 
United States, including ending the state’s 
efforts to shut down Line 5; to the Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Resources. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 114 
Whereas, Plentiful affordable energy is es-
sential for the well-being of the American 
people. The lack of an adequate energy sup-
ply leads to higher prices, fewer jobs, and 
threats to public health and safety. It should 
be the policy of the government at every 
level to ensure that energy is available, ac-
cessible, reliable and as affordable as pos-
sible; and 
Whereas, For decades, the United States 
has too greatly relied on sources of energy 
produced on the other side of the world. 
While the United States has enjoyed a higher 
degree of energy independence in the last 
decade due to an increase in domestic oil 
production, we still import tens of millions 
of barrels of foreign crude oil from overseas 
each month; and 
Whereas, As a direct result of both federal 
and state policies and foreseeable world 
events, gas prices in the United States are 
rising at the fastest pace recorded since 2000. 
Not only are rising gas prices eating away at 
recent wage growth and increasing the risk 
of a recession, they also could have sweeping 
impacts for U.S. consumers as higher diesel 
prices raise the cost of shipping goods 
through already stressed supply chains, dis-
proportionately affecting low-income fami-
lies and citizens; and 
Whereas, Enacting policies that will lead 
to energy independence is necessary for the 
safety and prosperity of the American peo-
ple. Reliance on overseas oil has the poten-
tial to maximize the leverage of foreign pro-
ducers. While the Biden Administration’s ef-
forts to isolate and weaken Vladimir Putin 
have been welcome and necessary, our reli-
ance on sources of energy originating on 
other continents creates a potential risk 
that those sources could be jeopardized by 
United States’ actions abroad, which limit 
our ability to preserve and protect American 
values. Ensuring that the United States’ 
economy can support itself without relying 
on supply chains that span the globe and 
without risk of foreign political disruptions 
is critical to job growth and competition in 
the United States; and 
Whereas, President Biden, United States 
Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, 
Governor Whitmer, Michigan Attorney Gen-
eral Nessel, and other elected officials have 
pursued policies that have harmed our abil-
ity to achieve energy independence, includ-
ing the President’s decision to halt the Key-
stone XL pipeline and the Governor’s and 
Michigan Attorney General’s attempts to 
shut down the Line 5 pipeline, a crucial 
source 
of 
energy 
for 
millions 
of 
Michiganders; and 
Whereas, Protecting our environment is 
better accomplished with domestically pro-
duced fossil fuels, which are believed to be 
significantly cleaner than those found in 
other parts of the world; and 
Whereas, The United States must focus on 
policies that increase the production of en-
ergy here at home, such as ensuring the con-
tinued safe operation of the Line 5 pipeline 
in Michigan, increasing domestic oil and gas 
drilling, increasing investments in renewable 
energy, and abandoning policies that limit 
domestic energy production and raise the 
capital costs associated with fossil fuel de-
velopment; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the 
adoption of policies that will help lead to en-
ergy independence and lower energy costs in 
the United States; and be it further 
Resolved, That we urge Governor Whitmer 
and Michigan Attorney General Nessel to 
immediately cease their efforts to shut down 
the Line 5 pipeline and instead work 
proactively to lower energy costs for the 
residents of this state; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the Governor, the Michigan 
Attorney General, the commissioners of the 
Michigan Public Service Commission, the 
commissioners of the Federal Energy Regu-
latory Commission, the Secretary of the 
United States Department of Energy, the 
Secretary of the United States Department 
of the Interior, the President of the United

House of Representatives, and the entire 
Michigan congressional delegation.

HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 2008 
Whereas, the United States has more than 
140,000 abandoned hardrock mines, and more 
than 22,000 of these pose environmental haz-
ards that threaten our land, water, fish and 
wildlife and the communities that depend on 
them; and

to remedy the environmental challenges cre-
ated by abandoned mines but are hindered by 
burdensome red tape and potential and sig-
nificant liability risks; and 
Whereas, numerous organizations have ex-
pressed a willingness to remediate the dam-
age caused by these long-abandoned mines, 
but doing so would expose a ‘‘Good Samari-
tan’’ volunteer to legal liability for all the 
preexisting pollution from a mine despite 
having no previous involvement with it; and 
Whereas, the bipartisan ‘‘Good Samaritan 
Remediation of Abandoned Hardrock Mines 
Act’’ has been introduced in Congress that 
would allow state agencies, local govern-
ments, nonprofit groups and corporations to 
clean up these abandoned mines, thereby 
helping to reduce pollution and improve 
water quality in and around the mining 
areas; and 
Whereas, this important legislation cre-
ates a path forward for Good Samaritans to 
work unimpeded and increase the pace and 
scale of reclamation and, in so doing, create 
jobs and enhance our nation’s environment. 
Therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives of 
the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring: 
1. That the Members of the Legislature ex-
press their support for the United States 
Congress to pass the Good Samaritan Reme-
diation of Abandoned Hardrock Mines Act to 
allow Good Samaritan groups to clean up 
abandoned mines in this country. 
2. That the Secretary of State of the State 
of Arizona transmit copies of this Resolution 
to the President of the United States Senate, 
the Speaker of the United States House of 
Representatives and each Member of Con-
gress from the State of Arizona. 
POM–179. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of 
Michigan urging the United States Congress 
to expand the federal Family First Preven-
tion Services Act by allowing flexibility in 
the use of Title IV–E funds to help children 
remain safely in their homes; to the Com-
mittee on Finance. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 262 
Whereas, In the United States, nearly half 
a million children are in foster care. Michi-
gan ranks 18th in the country for the number 
of children, per capita, placed in out-of-home 
care, with approximately 13,000 children in 
foster care or a residential placement on any 
given day; and 
Whereas, Research shows that children in 
the foster system have the best outcomes 
when they are placed in a safe and stable en-
vironment that supports their long-term 
well-being. Instead of subjecting children to 
the trauma of being separated from their 
family and placed out of their home, more 
efforts are being made to provide struggling 
and overburdened families with the resources 
they need to create a stable and loving envi-
ronment; and 
Whereas, The Family First Prevention 
Services Act. signed into law in 2018, was en-
acted to help increase the number of children 
who can remain safely at home with their 
families. The law allows states to use federal 
funding available under Title IV–E of the So-
cial Security Act to address some of the 
issues that contribute to family separation. 
Currently, the Family First Prevention 
Services Act allows funding for a narrow 
range of services, including substance use 
prevention and treatment, in-home par-
enting skills classes, and kinship navigator 
services. While these services are essential, 
there are many other areas in which families 
require assistance; and 
Whereas, Poverty and homelessness, for ex-
ample, have been shown to be associated 
with the separation of families, and many 
studies have documented that children in 
families who experience homelessness fre-
quently become separated from their par-
ents. Poverty leads to housing instability 
and parents often struggle to provide for 
their children’s basic needs. Helping parents 
out of poverty and providing stable environ-
ments for children would allow more fami-
lies to stay together, which would reduce the 
number of children that have to endure the 
foster care system; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, 
That we urge the United States Congress to 
expand the federal Family First Prevention 
Services Act by allowing flexibility in the 
use of Title IV–E funds to help children re-
main safely in their homes; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, the Presi-
dent of the United States Senate, and the 
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation. 
POM–180. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan urging the 
United States Congress to enact legislation 
to fully fund the Individuals with Disabil-
ities Education Act; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 129 
Whereas, Children with disabilities deserve 
quality education to develop skills so they 
can fully participate in social, economic, and 
political life. Many of these children face 
significant barriers to education and are 
more likely to be out of school. Ensuring ac-
cess to education is the best way to help 
children with disabilities realize their full 
potential; and 
Whereas, Congress has established that 
equal access to education for students with 
disabilities is an essential element of our na-
tional policy by passing the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). In the 
Act, Congress states that disability is a nat-
ural part of the human experience, and the 
IDEA is meant to ensure equality of oppor-
tunity and economic self-sufficiency for all 
individuals with disabilities; and 
Whereas, While the IDEA has resulted in 
increased access to education for millions of 
students, the Act remains dangerously un-
derfunded. In the original 1975 legislation, 
Congress promised to cover 40 percent of the 
extra cost of special education services re-
quired by the Act. However, as of 2020, the 
federal government was covering only 14.6 
percent of the cost, despite a 25 percent in-
crease in the number of students served; and 
Whereas, The IDEA Full Funding Act (S. 
866) was introduced in 2019 to require that 
Congress fund the IDEA at the 40 percent 
level that was originally promised. Similar 
legislation needs to be introduced this ses-
sion in order to ensure that the federal gov-
ernment is paying its fair share of the cost of 
special education services and to alleviate 
the financial burden on individual school dis-
tricts; and 
Whereas, Students and teachers suffer 
when Congress fails to live up to its funding 
commitment. School districts are forced to 
cover the costs with a scarcity of resources 
and must sometimes divert funds away from 
other programs that serve all students. In 
addition, schools have less funding for teach-
er salaries and classroom resources, making 
it more difficult to recruit and retain high- 
quality teachers; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we memori-
alize the Congress of the United States to 
enact legislation to fully fund the Individ-
uals with Disabilities Education Act so chil-
dren with disabilities have equal access to 
educational opportunity; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States Senate, the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, and the 
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation.

urging the President of the United States to 
designate a state funeral for the last sur-

War II; to the Committee on Homeland Secu-

SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 28 
Whereas, World War II, the most wide-
spread war in history, lasted from 1939 until 
1945; and 
Whereas, the United States entered the 
war in 1941, following an attack on Pearl 
Harbor by Japanese fighter planes; and 
Whereas, over sixteen million Americans 
served their country and the Allied powers 
over the course of the war; and 
Whereas, the generation of men and women 
who served our country in World War II has 
been called the ‘‘greatest generation’’ for 
their selfless sacrifice; and 
Whereas, the Medal of Honor is the highest 
military decoration that is awarded by the 
United States government; and 
Whereas, the Medal of Honor is presented 
by the President of the United States, in the 
name of Congress; and 
Whereas, the Medal of Honor is only con-
ferred upon members of the United States 
Armed Forces who distinguish themselves 
through conspicuous gallantry and intre-
pidity at the risk of life above and beyond 
the call of duty while engaged in action 
against an enemy of the United States, while 
engaged in military operations involving 
conflict with an opposing foreign force, or 
while serving with friendly forces engaged in 
an armed conflict against an opposing armed 
force in which the United States is not a bel-
ligerent party; and 
Whereas, more than 3,400 Medals of Honor 
have been awarded to our nation’s bravest 
soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast 
guardsmen since the creation of the award in 
1861; and 
Whereas, the Medal of Honor was awarded 
to 353 Americans during World War II; and 
Whereas, only one of those 353 Americans 
is alive today; and 
Whereas, Hershel Woodrow Williams of 
West Virginia served his country with con-
spicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the 
risk of life and therefore deserves the grati-
tude of the American people; and 
Whereas, the President of the United 
States has the sole authority to designate a 
state funeral; and 
Whereas, historically, the President of the 
United States has designated state funerals 
for former presidents, generals, and other ex-
traordinary Americans; and 
Whereas, our nation is currently divided 
and yearns for a unifying national event; and 
Whereas, designating a state funeral when 
the last surviving World War II Medal of 
Honor recipient dies would be a wonderful 
way for the American people to unite and 
honor all sixteen million soldiers, sailors, 
and airmen who served in our Armed Forces 
from 1941 to 1945: Now therefore be it 
Resolved, The members of the Missouri 
Senate, One Hundred First General Assem-
bly, Second Regular Session, the House of 
Representatives concurring therein, hereby 
urge the President of the United States to 
designate a state funeral for the last sur-
viving Medal of Honor recipient from World

United States, the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, the Presi-
dent Pro Tempore of the United States Sen-
ate, and all members of the Missouri con-
gressional delegation. 
POM–182. A concurrent memorial adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Arizona 
urging the United States Congress to imple-
ment steps to forward fund the Higher Edu-
cation Grant Program of the Bureau of In-
dian Education; to the Committee on Indian 
Affairs. 
SENATE CONCURRENT MEMORIAL NO. 1002 
Whereas, the Bureau of Indian Education 
(BIE) operates the Higher Education Grant 
Program (‘‘Grant’’) as authorized by the 
Snyder Act (25 United States Code part 13); 
and 
Whereas, numerous Indian tribal govern-
ments provide college financial assistance 
and scholarships from the Grant directly to 
Indian college students through Public Law 
93–638 self-determination contracts (Indian 
Self Determination Act and Education As-
sistance Act) or through Public Law 103–413 
self-governance compacts (Tribal Self Gov-
ernance Act of 1994); and 
Whereas, the federal government routinely 
operates under continuing resolutions and, 
as such, Grant funding is delayed. Con-
sequently, college scholarship and financial 
assistance payments and institutional dis-
bursements are delayed, which is problem-
atic for many Indian college students who 
depend on these monies to pay for tuition, 
books and room and board: and 
Whereas, there is precedent for forward 
funding federal Indian education programs, 
as BIE-funded schools, including Public Law 
93–638 and Public Law 100–297 schools (25 
United States Code section 2010) and tribally 
controlled 
colleges 
and 
universities 
(25 
United States Code section 1810), are forward 
funded; and 
Whereas, forward funding the BIE would 
make Grant monies available for obligation 
on July 1 of the fiscal year and would pro-
vide that Grant monies remain available 
until September 30 of the succeeding fiscal 
year. Wherefore your memorialist, the Sen-
ate of the State of Arizona, the House of 
Representatives concurring, prays: 
1. That the Members of the United States 
Congress take affirmative steps to forward 
fund the Higher Education Grant Program of 
the Bureau of Indian Education. 
2. That the Secretary of State of the State 
of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial 
to the President of the United States Senate, 
the Speaker of the United States House of 
Representatives and each Member of Con-
gress from the State of Arizona. 
POM–183. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico ex-
pressing the support of the Senate of the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to S. 405, bet-
ter known as the ‘‘Vieques Recovery and Re-
development Act,’’ introduced by the 117th 
Congress; to the Committee on the Judici-
ary. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 591 
Vieques is an island muniicipality Puerto 
Rico, measuring approximately twenty-one 
(21) miles long by four ( 4) miles wide, and lo-
cated approximately eight (8) miles east of 
the main island of Puerto Rico 
When discussing the history of Vieques and 
its difficulties, it is important to remember 
that the United States Navy maintained a 
constant presence in the eastern and western 
portions of Vieques for close to sixty (60) 
years. The United States Navy used large 
parts of the island and its beaches as a train-
ing range and for military exercises. Many of 
these exercises were carried out using live 
ammunition. It is estimated that over eighty 
(80) million tons of ordnance and other weap-
onry available to the United States Armed 
Forces since World War II were dropped dur-
ing that sixty (60)-year period. 
The unintended, unknown, and unavoid-
able consequence of decades of military exer-
cises was that generations of Vieques’ resi-
dents, who are U.S. citizens, were exposed to 
the residue left and the waste produced by 
such weaponry and munitions, which in-
cludes heavy metals and other chemicals 
now known to harm human health and life. 
As a result of the aforementioned and ac-
cording to Government and independent doc-
umentation, the lands and waters of the is-
land of Vieques contain high levels of heavy 
metals and have been exposed to chemical 
weapons and other toxic chemicals. Ever 
since the military exercises began in Vieques 
sixty-two (62) years ago, the island residents 
have suffered the effects of the long-term ex-
posure to the contamination created by such 
exercises. In comparison to other Puerto 
Ricans, the residents of Vieques have experi-
enced higher rates of certain diseases includ-
ing cancer, cirrhosis, hypertension, diabetes, 
heavy metal diseases, as well as many 
unnamed and uncategorized illnesses. The 
continuous exposure to these toxic residues 
has resulted in the development of these par-
ticular illnesses in the U.S. citizens who re-
side in Vieques. 
Prior to the passage of hurricane Marı´a in 
2017, the Susana Centeno Family Health Cen-
ter managed the health emergencies of the 
residents of Vieques. However, those residing 
or visiting Vieques would have to travel out-
side of the Island Municipality for most 
cases that required urgent medical care. This 
is due to the fact that the facility in Vieques 
lacked, among others, X-ray, CT scan, EKG, 
ultrasound, and PT scan equipment. 
Maritime transport has been and remains 
the predominant means of transporting pas-
sengers between Vieques and the island of 
Puerto Rico. However, this service has been 
plagued by problems and interruptions which 
makes it unreliable for visitors and resi-
dents, and, for example, those who are can-
cer patients that require continuous treat-
ment outside of Vieques, also known as the 
Isla Nena. It is worth noting that cancer pa-
tients who travel from Vieques to the Mu-
nicipality of Ceiba have to pay between one 
hundred twenty dollars ($120.00) and two hun-
dred dollars ($200.00) per trip. 
Vieques, like all of Puerto Rico, suffered 
the onslaught of hurricane Marı´a in 2017. 
This was a particularly destructive hurri-
cane 
that 
devastated 
Puerto 
Rico 
and 
Vieques and intensified the humanitarian 
crisis by destroying many of the existing 
medical-hospital facilities. In the case of 
Vieques, the previous medical system was al-
ready unable to properly handle the crisis 
that existed due to the toxic residue left on 
the island’s soil and waters as a result of the 
military’s activities. The Susana Centeno 
Family Health Center was closed after the 
passage of hurricane Marı´a due to the dam-
age it suffered and was thus unable to render 
the few services it previously provided. 
Consistent with the foregoing, it is worth 
stressing Vieques’ need to have a medical fa-
cility with the capability of providing the 
critical and urgent care to its residents. It is 
a matter of quality of life and basic human 
rights. Due to legal restrictions, the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is 
unable to provide a hospital where its capa-
bilities exceed those of the previous facility, 
to wit, the facility that existed prior to the 
passage 
of 
hurricane 
Marı´a. 
Therefore, 
Vieques needs additional assistance and sup-
port to properly address and manage the vast 
health needs of its residents. 
In 2012, the residents of Vieques were de-
nied the ability to address their needs before 
the United States Courts due to the sov-
ereign immunity of the Government of the 
United States. Sa´nchez v. United States, No. 
3:09–cv–01260–DRD (D.P.R.). However, the 
United States Court of Appeals for the First 
Circuit referred the issue to the United 
States Congress and urged it to address this 
humanitarian crisis. U.S. senators Robert 
Menendez (D-NJ) and Roger Wicker (R-Mis-
sissippi) have introduced S.405, popularly 
known as the ‘‘Vieques Recovery and Rede-
velopment Act.’’ This Bill creates a com-
pensation fund for the residents of Vieques 
or their heirs to claim compensation for the 
damages caused or resulting from the use of 
the island of Vieques for military training or 
exercises and for other related purposes. The 
compensation for individuals or their heirs 
shall fluctuate between fifty thousand dol-
lars ($50,000) and one hundred ten thousand 
dollars ($110,000) with the possibility for ad-
ditional awards for special circumstances. 
The awards shall be determined by a Special 
Master to be appointed by the United States 
Attorney General pursuant to the qualifica-
tions and requirements established in the 
Act. Likewise, the Vieques Recovery and Re-
development Act would authorize the munic-
ipal government of Vieques to file certain 
claims with the Special Master for the estab-
lishment or improvement of the health infra-
structure or facilities on the island. 
The Senate of the Commonwealth of Puer-
to Rico hereby requests to the Senate and 
the House Representatives of the United 
States the prompt approval of S.B. 405, the 
Vieques Recovery and Redevelopment Act. 
We appeal to the sense of responsibility of 
the Congresspersons and members of the 
United States Senate in order to do justice 
to the residents of Vieques and their heirs by 
providing a mechanism to help relieve a bur-
den on their lives and compensate them for 
the damages caused by six (6) decades of 
military exercises in Vieques. Likewise, this 
legislation shall help future generations of 
Vieques’ residents by streamlining the proc-
ess so that the municipal government can 
procure enough resources for appropriate 
medical facilities and infrastructure. 
The Senate of the Commonwealth of Puer-
to Rico, on behalf of the residents of Vieques 
and the People of Puerto Rico appeals to the 
leadership of the United States Senate and 
the United States House Representatives and 
both parties to work together to ensure the 
approval of the Vieques Recovery and Rede-
velopment Act before the end of the 117th 
Congress. 
Be it resolved by the Senate of Puerto Rico: 
Section 1.—We hereby express the support 
of the Senate of the Commonwealth of Puer-
to Rico to S.B. 405, better known as the 
‘‘Vieques Recovery and Redevelopment Act,’’ 
introduced by the 117th Congress, to the Sen-
ate and the House Representatives of the 
United States. 
Section 2.—We hereby urge the Senate and 
the House Representatives of the United 
States to promptly approve S.B. 405, better 
known as the ‘‘Vieques Recovery and Rede-
velopment Act,’’ introduced by the 117th 
Congress. 
Section 3.—A certified copy of this Resolu-
tion, translated into the English language, 
shall be delivered by the Secretary of the 
Senate of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 
to the President of the United States of 
America, to all members of the Senate and 
the House of Representatives of the United 
States, to the Resident Commissioner of 
Puerto Rico in Washington, as well as to 
communications media for its effective dis-
semination. 
Section 4.—This Resolution shall take ef-
fect upon its approval

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4043 
August 4, 2022 
POM–184. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of West Vir-
ginia applying to the United States Con-
gress, under the provisions of Article V of 
the Constitution of the United States, for 
the calling of a convention of the states lim-
ited to proposing amendments to the Con-
stitution of the United States that impose 
fiscal restraints on the federal government, 
limit the power and jurisdiction of the fed-
eral government, and limit the terms of of-
fice for its officials and for members of Con-
gress; to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 31 
Whereas, Executive orders by the Presi-
dent of the United States have become a ve-
hicle through which the President may 
overstep the limits of his or her constitu-
tional authority; and 
Whereas, The concentration of power at 
the federal level has had the effect of making 
federal officials less responsive to the will of 
the people and more readily influenced by 
lobbyists, wealthy corporations and special 
interests in Washington, D.C.; and 
Whereas, Much of federal law is now en-
acted by federal bureaucrats who were never 
chosen by the people and have no account-
ability to the people whatsoever; and 
Whereas, Policy decisions made at the 
state level tend to be more responsive to the 
needs and desires of the people; and 
Whereas, The federal government has cre-
ated a crushing national debt through im-
proper and imprudent spending; and 
Whereas, The federal government has in-
vaded the legitimate roles of the states 
through the manipulative process of federal 
mandates, many of which are unfunded to a 
great extent; and 
Whereas, The states have the ability to re-
store the responsiveness of government to 
the people and to restrain abuses of federal 
power by proposing amendments to the Con-
stitution of the United States through a lim-
ited convention of the states under Article 
V; therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Legislature of West Virginia, 
That the Legislature hereby applies to Con-
gress, under the provisions of Article V of 
the Constitution of the United States, for 
the calling of a convention of the states lim-
ited to proposing amendments to the Con-
stitution of the United States that impose 
fiscal restraints on the federal government, 
limit the power and jurisdiction of the fed-
eral government, and limit the terms of of-
fice for its officials and for members of Con-
gress; and, be it further 
Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of 
Delegates forward a copy of this resolution, 
legislative call and application to the Presi-
dent and Secretary of the United States Sen-
ate and to the Speaker and Clerk of the 
United States House of Representatives, and 
copies to the members of the said Senate and 
House of Delegates from this state; also to 
transmit copies hereof to the presiding offi-
cers of each of the legislative houses in the 
several states, requesting their cooperation; 
and, be it further 
Resolved, That this application constitutes 
a continuing application in accordance with 
Article V of the Constitution of the United 
States until the legislature, of at least two 
thirds of the several states have made appli-
cations on the same subject; and, be it fur-
ther 
Resolved, The West Virginia Legislature 
adopts this application expressly subject to 
the following reservations, understandings, 
and declarations: 
(1) An application to the Congress of the 
United States to call an amendment conven-
tion of the states pursuant to Article V of 
the United States Constitution confers no 
power to Congress other than the power to 
call such a convention. The power of Con-
gress to exercise this ministerial duty con-
sists solely of the authority to name a rea-
sonable time and place for the initial meet-
ing of a convention; 
(2) Congress shall perform its ministerial 
duty of calling an amendment convention of 
the states only upon the receipt of applica-
tions for an amendment convention for the 
substantially same purpose as this applica-
tion from two thirds of the legislatures of 
the several states; 
(3) Congress does not have the power or au-
thority to determine any rules for the gov-
erning of an amendment convention of the 
states called pursuant to Article V of the 
United States Constitution. Congress does 
not have the power to set the number of del-
egates to be sent by any state to such a con-
vention, nor does it have the power to name 
delegates to such a convention. The power to 
name delegates remains exclusively within 
the authority of the legislatures of the sev-
eral states; 
(4) By definition, an amendment conven-
tion of the states means that states shall 
vote on the basis of one state, one vote; 
(5) A convention of the states convened 
pursuant to this application shall in limited 
to consideration of the topics specified here-
in and no other. This application is made 
with the express understanding that an 
amendment that in any way seeks to amend 
modify, or repeal any provision of the Bill of 
Rights shall not be authorized for consider-
ation at any stage. This application shall be 
void ab initio if ever used at any stage to 
consider any change to any provision of the 
Bill of Rights; 
(6) Pursuant to Article V of the United 
States Constitution, Congress may deter-
mine whether proposed amendments shall be 
ratified by the legislatures of the several 
states or by special state ratification con-
ventions. The West Virginia Legislature rec-
ommends that Congress select ratification 
by the legislatures of the several states; and 
(7) The West Virginia Legislature may pro-
vide further instructions to its delegates and 
may recall its delegates at any time for a 
breach of a duty or a violation of the in-
structions provided; and, be it further 
Resolved, That the Clerk of the House for-
ward a copy of this resolution to the rep-
resentatives and senators elected by the citi-
zens of West Virginia serving the citizens of 
West Virginia in the Congress of the United 
States in Washington D.C. 
POM–185. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Missouri 
applying to the United States Congress, as 
provided by Article V of the Constitution of 
the United States of America, to call a con-
vention limited to proposing an amendment 
to the Constitution of the United States of 
America to set a limit on the number of 
terms that a person may be elected as a 
member of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives and to set a limit on the num-
ber of terms that a person may be elected as 
a member of the United States Senate; to 
the Committee on the Judiciary. 
SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 25 
Whereas, Article V of the Constitution of 
the United States requires a convention to 
be called by the Congress of the United 
States for the purpose of proposing an 
amendment to the Constitution upon appli-
cation of two-thirds of the Legislatures of 
the several states; and 
Whereas, the Legislature of the State of 
Missouri favors a proposal and ratification of 
an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, 
which shall set a limit on the number of 
terms that a person may be elected as a 
member of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives and as a member of the United 
States Senate; and 
Whereas, the Ninety-ninth General Assem-
bly of Missouri, Second Regular Session, 
adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution 40, 
which contained an application for an Arti-
cle V Convention to propose an amendment 
identical to that proposed in this resolution, 
but provided that the application would ex-
pire five years after the passage of Senate 
Concurrent Resolution 40: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, by the members of the Missouri 
Senate, One Hundred First General Assem-
bly, Second Regular Session, the House of 
Representatives concurring therein, hereby 
make an application to Congress, as provided 
by Article V of the Constitution of the 
United States of America, to call a conven-
tion limited to proposing an amendment to 
the Constitution of the United States of 
America to set a limit on the number of 
terms that a person may be elected as a 
member of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives and to set a limit on the num-
ber of terms that a person may be elected as 
a member of the United States Senate; and 
be it further 
Resolved, That this application shall be 
considered as covering the same subject mat-
ter as the applications from other states to 
Congress to call a convention to set a limit 
on the number of terms that a person may be 
elected to the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States and the 
Senate of the United States; and this appli-
cation shall be aggregated with same for the 
purpose of attaining the two-thirds of states 
necessary to require Congress to call a lim-
ited convention on this subject, but shall not 
be aggregated with any other applications on 
any other subject; and be it further 
Resolved, That this application hereby re-
peals, rescinds, cancels, renders null and 
void, and supercedes the application to the 
Congress of the United States for a conven-
tion under Article V of the Constitution of 
the United States by this state in Senate 
Concurrent Resolution No. 40 as adopted by 
the Ninety-ninth General Assembly, Second 
Regular Session; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate 
be instructed to prepare a properly inscribed 
copy of this resolution for the President and 
Secretary of the Senate of the United States 
and to the Speaker, Clerk, and Judiciary 
Committee Chairman of the House of Rep-
resentatives of the Congress of the United 
States, and copies to each member of the 
Missouri Congressional delegation, and the 
presiding officers of each of the legislative 
houses in the several states, requesting their 
cooperation.

such 
as 
automobiles, 
computers,

equipment; and 
Whereas, The Semiconductor Industry As-
sociation asserts that the share of modern 
semiconductor manufacturing capacity lo-
cated in the United States has decreased 
from 37 percent in 1990 to 12 percent today 
and that this decline is largely due to sub-

foreign 
governments, 
which 
places 
the 
United States at a competitive disadvantage 
in attracting new construction of semicon-
ductor manufacturing facilities; and 
Whereas, In recent years, global semicon-
ductor supply chain vulnerabilities have 
emerged, leading to market shortages of 
automobiles and other electronic devices; 
and 
Whereas, 
These 
supply 
chain 
vulnerabilities have revealed our reliance on 
foreign manufacturing of essential tech-
nology and should be eliminated through 
government investment in semiconductor 
production and innovation, which would 
strengthen our market security; and 
Whereas, On January 1, 2021, the federal 
Creating 
Helpful 
Incentives 
to 
Produce 
Semiconductors for America Act (CHIPS 
Act) was enacted as part of the FY 2021 Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act; and 
Whereas, The CHIPS Act creates federal 
incentives for investment in facilities and 
equipment used for semiconductor fabrica-
tion, assembly, testing, advanced packaging, 
and research and development for the pur-
pose of protecting supply chains, ensuring 
long-term national security, and bolstering 
international economic competitiveness; and 
Whereas, The effectiveness of the CHIPS 
Act relies on Congress fully funding the pro-
visions of the law, including enacting an in-
vestment tax credit, to support semicon-
ductor production and innovation in this 
country; and 
Whereas, On July 8, 2021, the United States 
Senate passed the United States Innovation 
and Competition Act of 2021 (USICA), which 
included $52 billion in federal investments 
for the CHIPS Act; and 
Whereas, On February 4, 2022, the United 
States House of Representatives passed the 
America COMPETES Act of 2022 (COM-
PETES Act), which, like USICA, included $52 
billion in federal investments for the CHIPS 
Act; and 
Whereas, The Senate, upon receiving the 
COMPETES Act from the House, substituted 
the bill with the USICA, and passed it on 
March 28, 2022; and 
Whereas, Although the USICA substitute 
was sent back to the House of Representa-
tives for a final vote, Congress intends to 
convene a conference committee to reconcile 
the differences between the COMPETES Act 
and the USICA in order to finalize the 
version of the bill that will be sent to the 
President for enactment; and 
Whereas, Governor Murphy has voiced his 
support of the USICA and has encouraged 
Congress to expedite the reconciliation of 
the bill; and 
Whereas, United States Commerce Sec-
retary Gina Raimondo specifically men-
tioned that the New Jersey Innovation and 
Technology Hub in New Brunswick, which 
will provide 550,000 square feet of space for 
medical learning, research, and innovation, 
would be a suitable potential site for semi-
conductor manufacturing; and 
Whereas, New Jersey’s Congressional dele-
gation, who are integral in directing federal 
funds to this State, has also voiced support 
of the intent behind the COMPETES Act and 
the USICA; and 
Whereas, New Jersey’s economy would 
greatly benefit from federal investments in 
semiconductor manufacturing in this State 
and would strengthen the State’s historical 
reputation as a leader in science and innova-
tion; now, therefore, 
Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the 
State of New Jersey: 
1. This House respectfully urges Congress 
to expedite the reconciliation of the COM-
PETES Act and the USICA to secure the 
country’s supply chain, increase the coun-
try’s global competitiveness, and establish 
this State as a leader in semiconductor pro-
duction and innovation through the result-
ing federal investments. 
2. Copies of the resolution, as filed with the 
Secretary of State, shall be transmitted by 
the Clerk of the General Assembly to the 
President and Vice-President of the United 
States, the Majority and Minority Leaders of 
the United States Senate, the Speaker and

BALDWIN) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 744 
Whereas, in 1967, the ongoing naval bomb-
ing campaign against North Vietnam from 
Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin was 
one of the most intense and sustained air at-
tack operations in the history of the Navy; 
Whereas, on June 6, 1967, the USS Forrestal 
and Carrier Air Wing 17 departed Norfolk, 
Virginia, for duty in the Western Pacific; 
Whereas, on July 28, 1967, during an under-
way replenishment, the crew of the USS For-
restal were required to onload deteriorated 
bombs, which were more vulnerable to ex-
ploding at high temperatures; 
Whereas, on July 29, 1967, the older ord-
nance were used to avoid canceling a planned 
strike mission over North Vietnam; 
Whereas, despite safety precautions taken 
by the crew, on July 29, 1967, a devastating 
fire erupted on the USS Forrestal after— 
(1) a malfunction in a parked aircraft 
caused the aircraft to fire a Zuni rocket that 
ruptured a fuel tank on another aircraft; and 
(2) the burning fuel ignited a chain reac-
tion of 9 bomb explosions on the flight deck; 
Whereas the explosions destroyed multiple 
aircraft and tore massive holes in the ar-
mored flight deck of the USS Forrestal, and 
burning fuel dripped into the living quarters 
of the crew and the aircraft hangar below 
deck; 
Whereas, for 18 hours, sailors and marines 
on the USS Forrestal, assisted by helicopters 
and crews from 8 other ships, fought to bring 
the fire under control while hospital corps-
men navigated the mangled flight deck and 
tended to the wounded; and 
Whereas the fire onboard the USS Forrestal 
ultimately— 
(1) left 134 men dead and 161 men injured; 
(2) destroyed 21 aircraft; and 
(3) caused the USS Forrestal to terminate 
its support to the fight in Vietnam and re-
turn to Norfolk, Virginia, for repairs: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates the 55th anniversary of 
the fire onboard the USS Forrestal; 
(2) recognizes the sailors and marines who 
gave their lives for ship and shipmates while 
fighting the devastating fire and commemo-
rates the efforts of the sailors and marines 
who survived the fire; 
(3) recognizes that— 
(A) if not for the heroic actions of the crew 
of the USS Forrestal, the consequences of the 
fire would have been far more devastating to 
the sailors and marines onboard and the USS 
Forrestal; and 
(B) the selfless sacrifices of the sailors and 
marines who came to the rescue of fellow 
shipmates and the USS Forrestal represent, 
and are consistent with, the highest tradi-
tions of the Navy; and 
(4) expresses gratitude to the sailors and 
marines who served aboard the USS Forrestal 
for their faithful service.

SENATE RESOLUTION 745—DESIG-
NATING AUGUST 16, 2022, AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL AIRBORNE DAY’’ 
Mr. SULLIVAN (for himself, Mr. 
REED, Ms. MURKOWSKI, Mrs. BLACK-
BURN, Mr. TILLIS, Mr. KING, Mrs. MUR-
RAY, Mr. INHOFE, Mr. WARNOCK, Ms. 
ROSEN, Mr. OSSOFF, Ms. DUCKWORTH, 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO, Ms. HIRONO, Mr. 
MENENDEZ, Mr. TUBERVILLE, Mr. COT-
TON, Mr. MCCONNELL, Mr. KELLY, and 
Mrs. SHAHEEN) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 745 
Whereas the members of the airborne 
forces of the Armed Forces of the United 
States have a long and honorable history as 
bold and fierce warriors who, for the na-
tional security of the United States and the 
defense of freedom and peace, project the 
ground combat power of the United States 
by air transport to the far reaches of the bat-
tle area and to the far corners of the world; 
Whereas, on June 25, 1940, experiments 
with airborne operations by the United 
States began after the Army Parachute Test 
Platoon was first authorized by the Depart-
ment of War; 
Whereas, in July 1940, 48 volunteers began 
training for the Army Parachute Test Pla-
toon; 
Whereas the first official Army parachute 
jump took place on August 16, 1940, to test 
the innovative concept of inserting United 
States ground combat forces behind a battle 
line by means of a parachute; 
Whereas the success of the Army Para-
chute Test Platoon, before the entry of the 
United States into World War II, validated 
the airborne operational concept and led to 
the creation of a formidable force of airborne 
formations that included the 11th, 13th, 17th, 
82nd, and 101st Airborne Divisions; 
Whereas included in those divisions, and 
among 
other 
separate 
formations, 
were 
many airborne combat, combat support, and 
combat service support units that served 
with distinction and achieved repeated suc-
cess in armed hostilities during World War 
II; 
Whereas the achievements of the airborne 
units during World War II prompted the evo-
lution of those units into a diversified force 
of parachute and air-assault units that, over 
the years, have fought in Korea, the Domini-
can Republic, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, 
the Persian Gulf region, and Somalia, and 
have engaged in peacekeeping operations in 
Lebanon, the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt, 
Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo; 
Whereas, since the terrorist attacks of 
September 11, 2001, the members of the 
United States airborne forces, including 
members of the XVIII Airborne Corps, the 
82nd Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne 
Division (Air Assault), the 173rd Airborne 
Brigade Combat Team, the 4th Brigade Com-
bat Team (Airborne) of the 25th Infantry Di-
vision, the 75th Ranger Regiment, special op-
erations forces of the Army, Marine Corps, 
Navy, and Air Force, and other units of the 
Armed Forces, have demonstrated bravery 
and honor in combat, stability, and training 
operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other 
theaters in the Global War on Terrorism; 
Whereas the continued evolution of United 
States Army airborne units allowed for the 
reactivation of the 11th Airborne Division on 
June 6, 2022, to lead the Armed Forces of the 
United States in Arctic warfighting capabili-
ties, support United States Indo-Pacific 
Command operations, and continue the sto-
ried legacy of the 11th Airborne Division 
that dates back to World War II; 
Whereas the modern airborne forces also 
include other elite forces composed of air-
borne trained and qualified special oper-
ations warriors, including Army Special 
Forces, Marine Corps Reconnaissance Bat-
talions, Navy SEALs, and Air Force combat 
control and pararescue teams; 
Whereas, of the members and former mem-
bers of the United States airborne forces, 
thousands have achieved the distinction of 
making combat jumps, dozens have earned 
the Medal of Honor, and hundreds have 
earned the Distinguished Service Cross, the 
Silver Star, or other decorations and awards 
for displays of heroism, gallantry, intre-
pidity, and valor; 
Whereas the members and former members 
of the United States airborne forces are all 
members of a proud and honorable tradition 
that, together with the special skills and 
achievements of those members, distin-
guishes the members as intrepid combat 
parachutists, air assault forces, special oper-
ation forces, and, in the past, glider infantry; 
Whereas individuals from every State of 
the United States have served gallantly in 
the airborne forces, and each State is proud 
of the contributions of its paratrooper vet-
erans during the many conflicts faced by the 
United States; 
Whereas the history and achievements of 
the members and former members of the 
United States airborne forces warrant spe-
cial expressions of the gratitude of the peo-
ple of the United States; and 
Whereas, since the airborne forces, past 
and present, celebrate August 16 as the anni-
versary of the first official jump by the 
Army Parachute Test Platoon, August 16 is 
an appropriate day to recognize as National 
Airborne Day: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates August 16, 2022, as ‘‘National 
Airborne Day’’; and 
(2) calls on the people of the United States 
to observe National Airborne Day with ap-
propriate programs, ceremonies, and activi-
ties.

SENATE RESOLUTION 746—DESIG-
NATING AUGUST 2022 AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL CATFISH MONTH’’ 
Mr. WICKER (for himself, Mrs. HYDE- 
SMITH, Mr. CASSIDY, Mr. TUBERVILLE, 
Mr. KENNEDY, Mr. COTTON, Mr. CORNYN, 
Mr. BOOZMAN, Mr. SHELBY, Mr. TILLIS, 
Mr. WARNOCK, and Mr. CRUZ) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
Whereas the Catfish Institute recognizes 
August to be National Catfish Month; 
Whereas the States of Alabama, Arkansas, 
Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas recognize 
August to be National Catfish Month; 
Whereas the States of Iowa, Kansas, Mis-
souri, Nebraska, and Tennessee embody the 
Channel Catfish as their State Fish; 
Whereas the farm-raised catfish industry 
in the United States employs nearly 10,000 
people 
and 
contributes 
more 
than 
$4,000,000,000 to the economy of the United 
States; 
Whereas the United States has 67,640 sur-
face water acres used for catfish production 
in 2022, and catfish growers in the United 
States had $421,161,000 in sales during 2021; 
Whereas the average catfish farmer pro-
duces 5,000 pounds of catfish per acre; 
Whereas 99 percent of all United States 
farm-raised catfish are grown in Alabama, 
Arkansas, California, Georgia, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, and 
Texas; 
Whereas catfish is the largest farm-raised 
seafood product, by weight, in the United 
States, representing more than 50 percent of 
the United States aquaculture industry; 
Whereas United States farm-raised catfish 
are consistently high quality and, unlike 
ocean-caught fish, are available all year 
long; 
Whereas United States farm-raised catfish 
are 
a 
sustainable 
and 
environmentally 
friendly seafood product; 
Whereas catfish is a lean fish and an excel-
lent source of protein; and 
Whereas catfish is a versatile fish in cui-
sine of the United States, with a myriad of 
regional and national recipes to be enjoyed 
by all people of the United States: Now, 
therefore, be it

TARIES OF FINLAND AND SWE-

ORGANIZATION ALLIANCE 
Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. INHOFE, 
Mrs. 
BLACKBURN, 
Ms. 
ERNST, 
Mr. 
WICKER, and Mr. ROUNDS) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 747 
Whereas North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion (NATO) ambassadors signed the Acces-
sion Protocols for Finland and Sweden on 
July 5, 2022; 
Whereas the Senate agreed to the resolu-
tion of advice and consent to ratification of 
the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty 
of 1949 on the Accession of the Republic of 
Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden (Treaty 
Doc. 117–3) on August 3, 2022; 
Whereas the accession of Finland and Swe-
den to NATO will strengthen the capabili-
ties, geostrategic position, and deterrence 
posture of the alliance in the Baltic Sea re-
gion and the North Atlantic from that day 
forward; and 
Whereas the accession of Finland and Swe-
den to NATO will reduce each current mem-
ber nation’s respective burden share as a per-
centage of the total alliance’s deterrence and 
defense posture: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate, in accordance 
with its support for NATO’s collective secu-
rity commitment and for maximizing the 
combined defense capabilities of United 
States allies and partners through NATO co-
ordination and cooperation, and with antici-
pation for the accession of Finland and Swe-
den to the alliance— 
(1) recognizes the steps taken by the 
United States to build upon years of joint 
and multilateral engagement, training, and 
exercises; and 
(2) encourages the President to further ad-
vance the efforts of the United States with 
respect to— 
(A) enhancing the interoperability of the 
militaries of Finland and Sweden with the 
United States, including via— 
(i) exercises and training across all do-
mains, including a focus on critical capabili-

(v) United States foreign military sales; 
(vi) joint development of emerging tech-
nologies, including cybersecurity and tele-
communications components; and 
(vii) coordination on critical infrastruc-
ture, including dual-use infrastructure such 
as telecommunications infrastructure and 
port facilities; 
(B) trilateral cooperation between Finland 
and Sweden with the United States, includ-
ing the military activities described in 
clauses (i) through (vii) of subparagraph (A) 
and through the trilateral statement of in-
tent signed by all three nations in 2018; 
(C) multilateral interoperability between 
Finland, Sweden, and all NATO partners, in-
cluding 
military 
activities 
described 
in 
clauses (i) through (vii) of subparagraph (A); 
and 
(D) countering disinformation campaigns 
that seek to diminish the relevancy and co-
hesion of NATO or otherwise undermine or 
delay the collective accession process of 
NATO members; and 
(3) calls on all NATO members to take 
similar, respective actions as provided in 
paragraph (2) to further advance the inter-
operability of the militaries of Finland and 
Sweden with NATO forces and bolster Euro-
pean security, in conjunction with the rapid 
completion of their respective ratification 
processes.
