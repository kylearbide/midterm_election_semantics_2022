WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 14, 2021 
No. 215 
House of Representatives 
The House met at noon and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, inspire us as we sing an-
cient choruses of the simple and the 
wise, who had much to fear, and even 
more to find; 
Who stepped into the darkness to fol-
low Your light, guided by angels, con-
soled in their fright. 
Speak to us anew as we share the 
same stories each year, that somehow 
new tales of faith would be heard—even 
here—of people who relied fiercely on 
hope and a prayer, when the world 
around them knew little more than de-
struction and despair. 
Fill us with the joy of children who 
delight in the laughter and light of this 
holiday season, that we would, with the 
same trusting hearts, receive the love 
You call us to believe in. 
With the promise of Your salvation, 
we place our deepest yearnings in Thy 
tender care. 
Redeem our world this day. 
In Your most holy name, Lord, hear 
our prayer. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
11(a) of House Resolution 188, the Jour-

f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LOFGREN) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. LOFGREN led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

REPORT ON RESOLUTION RELAT-
ING TO THE CONSIDERATION OF 
HOUSE REPORT 117–217 AND AN 
ACCOMPANYING RESOLUTION 
Mr. RASKIN, from the Committee on 
Rules, submitted a privileged report 
(Rept. No. 117–217) on the resolution (H. 
Res. 848) relating to the consideration 
of House Report 117–216 and an accom-
panying resolution, which was referred 
to the House Calendar and ordered to 
be printed.

RELATING 
TO 
THE 
CONSIDER-
ATION OF HOUSE REPORT 117–216 
AND AN ACCOMPANYING RESO-
LUTION 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, by direc-
tion of the Committee on Rules, I call 
up House Resolution 848 and ask for its 
immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 848 
Resolved, That if House Report 117–216 is 
called up by direction of the Select Com-
mittee to Investigate the January 6th At-
tack on the United States Capitol: (a) all 
points of order against the report are waived 
and the report shall be considered as read; 
and (b)(1) an accompanying resolution of-
fered by direction of the Select Committee 
to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the 
United States Capitol shall be considered as 
read and shall not be subject to a point of 
order; and (2) the previous question shall be 
considered as ordered on such resolution to 
adoption without intervening motion or de-
mand for division of the question except one 
hour of debate equally divided among and 
controlled by Representative Thompson of 
Mississippi, Representative Cheney of Wyo-
ming, and an opponent, or their respective 
designees. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARSON). The gentleman from Mary-
land is recognized for 1 hour. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, for the 
purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Mrs. 
FISCHBACH), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, today the 
Rules Committee met and reported a 
rule, House Resolution 848. The rule 
provides for consideration of the reso-
lution accompanying House Report 117– 
216, under a closed rule if the report is 
called up by direction of the Select 
Committee to Investigate the January 
6th Attack on the United States Cap-
itol. 
It provides 1 hour of debate equally 
divided among and controlled by Chair 
THOMPSON, Vice Chair CHENEY, and an 
opponent. 
Mr. Speaker, after producing 9,000 
pages of documents that he conceded to 
be nonprivileged in any way; after say-
ing he would comply with the subpoena 
to appear before the January 6th com-
mittee on December 8; after negoti-
ating and rendering preliminary co-
operation with the January 6th com-
mittee, Mark Meadows’ book came out 
with tons of startling and eye-popping 
revelations about January 6th and the 
role that then-President Donald Trump 
played. 
Ex-President Trump exploded and 
called Mr. Meadows’ book fake news. 
Amazingly, Mr. Meadows agreed that 
his book was fake news, and then he 
suddenly pulled the plug on his agree-
ment to testify in formal deposition be-
fore our committee on December 8. 
Instead, he went to court and alleged 
that our committee has no valid legis-
lative purpose.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7646 
December 14, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Meadows’ sudden 
vanishing act is plainly a delay tactic 
designed to run out the clock on one of 
the most important investigations in 
the history of the United States of 
America. If we don’t have a legislative 
purpose in investigating the most 
sweeping, violent attack on the U.S. 
Capitol since the War of 1812, and the 
most 
serious 
and 
most 
dangerous 
threat to American constitutional de-
mocracy since the Civil War, then we 
really don’t have a legislative purpose 
for anything we do here. 
If this investigation into a dangerous 
assault on the American Government 
is not necessary and proper under our 
Constitution, then nothing is. Article 
I, Section 8, Clause 15 of the Constitu-
tion gives Congress of the United 
States the power to provide for: calling 
forth the militia to execute the laws of 
the Union, suppress insurrections, and 
repel invasions. 
Obviously, we have a legislative pur-
pose in what we are doing to inves-
tigate an attack on this building, on 
this Chamber where more than 140 of 
our officers were wounded and injured, 
hospitalized, people came back with 
broken necks, broken jaws, broken 
vertebrae, broken arms, broken legs, 
traumatic brain injuries, and to this 
day, continue to suffer from post-trau-
matic stress syndrome. 
The counting of electoral college 
votes was interrupted for the very first 
time in American history for several 
hours. This was the most serious, de-
stabilizing, domestic threat to Amer-
ican constitutional democracy that 
any of us have seen in our lifetimes. 
Now, the committee has bent over 
backwards to accommodate Mr. Mead-
ows’ multiple requests. It is now clear 
he has no intention of complying with 
the subpoena, even when his testimony 
could have no theoretical connection 
to an executive privilege claim. This is 
the key point. 
He is categorically refusing to show 
up to testify about 9,000 pages of docu-
ments that he has already turned over 
to the committee and for which he has 
thus nullified any hypothetical asser-
tions of executive privilege by Presi-
dent Biden, or a former President. He 
is refusing to testify about statements 
that he made in his book that are now 
all over the country, published last 
week, and that he has repeated in the 
media about what took place on Janu-
ary 6. 
He is willing to talk about it in his 
book. He is willing to talk about it in 
public, but he is unwilling to undergo 
the questioning of our committee de-
spite having been subpoenaed to do so 
in deposition. 
This is another category of state-
ments which has nothing to do with ex-
ecutive privilege because it has already 
been completely waived, completely 
obviated, and completely nullified by 
his own actions. 
This witness, Mr. Speaker, must tes-
tify. He must come and render truth-
ful, honest, and complete testimony 
like 300 other witnesses before him 
have done, either voluntarily and pa-
triotically, as the vast majority have 
done, or at least under compulsion of a 
legal subpoena. 
The Supreme Court has been per-
fectly clear about that. We have the 
same authority to ask for people’s tes-
timony that a court does in pursuit of 
our official constitutional duties. And 
if anyone we have called as a witness 
knows in his bones that he must testify 
before this committee, it is Mr. Mead-
ows himself, a former member of this 
body who repeatedly through his career 
in Congress insisted that high-ranking 
executive branch officials must comply 
with congressional demands for infor-
mation and congressional subpoenas 
for their testimony. 
By the way, you don’t get to choose 
and say: Well, I will send you my docu-
ments, but I am not going to testify. 
That is not how going before Congress 
works or going before a court works. 
In the last administration, multiple 
times, Mr. Meadows found high-rank-
ing officials hiding information from 
Congress, withholding relevant docu-
ments, or ‘‘even outright ignoring con-
gressional subpoenas.’’ 
And here is what he had to say about 
that: ‘‘This level of conduct, paired 
with the failure to even feign an inter-
est in transparency, is reprehensible. 
And whether you’re a Republican or a 
Democrat, this kind of obstruction is 
wrong, period. 
‘‘For 9 months we’ve warned them 
consequences were coming, and for 9 
months we’ve heard the same excuses 
backed up by the same unacceptable 
conduct. Time is up and the con-
sequences are here.’’ 
We have multiple statements by Mr. 
Meadows like that, who was a distin-
guished member of the Oversight and 
Reform Committee. He, of all Mem-
bers, continually insisted that people 
and high-ranking government officials 
respect the authority of Congress to do 
its job. 
Our investigative powers are implicit 
in, and intertwined with our powers to 
legislate as the Supreme Court has re-
peatedly emphasized. 
The Meadows’ lawsuit against indi-
vidual members of this committee is 
extremely dubious in light of the 
Speech or Debate Clause and multiple 
other constitutional roadblocks, and 
its substantive allegations are frivo-
lous, such as the central absurd claim 
that Congress has no legitimate pur-
pose in investigating and reporting to 
the American people on a violent at-
tack on our Capitol, our Presidential 
election, and on the peaceful transfer 
of power. 
We must hold him in contempt for 
his refusal to participate in these pro-
ceedings, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Maryland and 
from the Rules Committee for yielding 
me the customary 30 minutes, and I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, once again, the select 
committee is acting to fulfill a pre-
determined narrative. It seems increas-
ingly clear that my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle want to prolong 
this political process to distract Amer-
icans from the very real issues con-
cerning this country. 
We have record-high inflation, a 
flood of immigrants at our southern 
border, a workforce and supply chain 
crisis, and instead of working toward 
real ways we can combat these crises, 
or, in fact, even admitting that these 
crises exist, we are back here, arguing 
if we should continue down a path of 
yet another partisan investigation of 
questionable motive and purpose. 
b 1215 
That said, there are several questions 
that need to be resolved before we can 
continue with this vote. The courts 
have found that the power rests with 
Congress over subpoenas to private in-
dividuals if they serve a legitimate leg-
islative purpose. 
A 
legitimate 
legislative 
purpose 
would be issuing subpoenas to the lead-
ers of the D.C. National Guard and the 
Sergeant at Arms so that we can find 
out what gaps in communications and 
authorities need to be filled and find 
solutions to ensure this doesn’t happen 
again. 
But have those been issued? Unfortu-
nately not. Instead, House Democrats 
are continuing their witch hunt into 
President Trump and their political op-
ponents who voted against the certifi-
cation of the election, something that 
they themselves did just 4 years before. 
What information is intended to be 
gathered that would be useful for a le-
gitimate legislative purpose? It seems 
the majority keeps moving the goal-
posts for what qualifies them to hold 
someone in contempt. 
This recipient has been cooperative, 
providing almost 9,000 pages of emails 
and other documents. But when the 
majority couldn’t find what they want-
ed, the committee subpoenaed Verizon, 
looking for other information from his 
personal phone, invading his privacy. 
There is no valid legislative purpose 
for this subpoena. Where does it stop? 
When will they be satisfied with the in-
formation they receive? They cannot 
continue punishing people just because 
they aren’t getting the answers that 
they want. 
Furthermore, criminal contempt is 
not subpoena enforcement. This deci-
sion will still not achieve the stated in-
tent of obtaining the records. 
The committee should seek a civil 
judgment and legally obligate a person 
to comply with the subpoena. Instead, 
my colleagues are going forward with 
this political ploy. Holding someone in 
criminal contempt is purely punitive. 
It leads me to wonder what the real 
mission of this committee is. 
Unfortunately, Speaker PELOSI and 
the Democrats made it clear early on 
that this committee and its investiga-
tion were predestined to be a sham

December 14, 2021 
when it tilted representation in favor 
of Democrats, rejecting two Republican 
Members selected to serve on the com-
mission by the minority leader. 
Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned 
about the precedent being set today be-
cause the majority is blinded by their 
own political agenda. I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this rule and the un-
derlying resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
First of all, on the matter of the 
phone records, what has been subpoe-
naed is simply the metadata estab-
lishing where the phone calls were 
going amongst different parties that 
were involved in the January 6 insur-
rection and the attempted political 
coup against Vice President Pence, but 
not the actual communications them-
selves. There has not been a single 
word that has been subpoenaed from 
the telephone companies of the actual 
conversations that took place. 
All of that, in any event, is an irrele-
vant distraction. Let’s be very clear 
about what is going on here, Mr. 
Speaker. Mr. Meadows began to cooper-
ate. He turned over 9,000 documents of 
extraordinary relevance to this inves-
tigation. We were getting exactly what 
we wanted, up until the point at which 
he pulled the plug on his participation. 
Look at some of the texts which we 
released over the last 24 hours that 
came in as part of his discovery with 
the committee. This is from some Re-
publican lawmakers and others: 
‘‘We are under siege up here at the 
Capitol,’’ was one text he received. 
‘‘They have breached the Capitol.’’ 
‘‘Mark, 
protesters 
are 
literally 
storming the Capitol. Breaking win-
dows on doors. Rushing in. Is Trump 
going to say something?’’ 
‘‘There’s an armed standoff at the 
House Chamber door.’’ 
‘‘We are all helpless.’’ 
Here is what came in from some 
members of the media that Mr. Mead-
ows turned over to the committee. 
Laura Ingraham: ‘‘Mark, the Presi-
dent needs to tell people in the Capitol 
to go home. This is hurting all of us. 
He is destroying his legacy.’’ 
Brian Kilmeade sent this to Mark 
Meadows: ‘‘Please get him on TV. De-
stroying everything you have accom-
plished.’’ 
Here is Sean Hannity: ‘‘Can he make 
a statement? Ask people to leave the 
Capitol.’’ 
Trump family members also were 
texting, according to the materials 
turned over by Mark Meadows. Donald 
Trump, Jr.: ‘‘He’s got to condemn this’’ 
excrement ‘‘ASAP. The Capitol Police 
tweet is not enough.’’ Meadows re-
sponding: ‘‘I’m pushing it hard. I 
agree.’’ Donald Trump, Jr.: We need an 
Oval Office address. He has to lead now. 
It has gone too far and gotten out of 
hand.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, all of these texts and 
hundreds more like them lead to hun-
dreds of questions that we have about 
the sequence of events on January 6: 
Who did what in response to different 
pleas from lawmakers, Democrat and 
Republican alike? Who did what in re-
sponse to these pleas coming in from 
members of the media and from mem-
bers of the Trump family? What was 
the sequence of events? How was the 
National Guard involved? How did this 
interact with other parts of the Fed-
eral Government? 
Then Mr. Meadows, though, did a U- 
turn when Donald Trump called his 
book ‘‘fake news.’’ Meadows decided to 
agree with him and hurriedly said it 
was fake news and then said he would 
not appear on December 8, a date, by 
the way, which had been postponed 
from two other dates to testify because 
we wanted to accommodate his sched-
ule and the schedule of his lawyer. But 
now he decides to go completely cold. 
They are left in a completely unten-
able posture legally because he is re-
fusing to testify about things that he 
has already conceded there is no privi-
lege covering. He has said: None of this 
is privileged. I am turning it over to 
you. 
We want to ask him questions about 
it, and now, suddenly, he runs back to 
the idea that there is some privilege, 
although one can see his eroding faith 
in that argument as the D.C. Circuit 
rejected the claims of executive privi-
lege unanimously in Trump v. Thomp-
son. 
So now that is why he is saying we 
have no legitimate legislative purpose, 
which is perfectly absurd. If we don’t 
have a legislative purpose in defending 
our own institution, our own Constitu-
tion, our own government, then we 
have no legislative purposes here at all 
if we can’t even have an investigation 
into an attack that goes to the very 
survival of our form of government. 
Mr. Speaker, Mark Meadows has to 
testify. He has to come in like 300 
American citizens have patriotically 
and lawfully done. What makes him 
special? The fact that he knows a 
former President of the United States? 
I am afraid not. 
In Jones v. Clinton, a case that my 
colleagues applauded on the other side 
of the aisle, the Supreme Court held 
that even a sitting President of the 
United States is not immune to civil 
actions, even a sitting President. 
We don’t have an office of former 
President. When you are no longer 
President of the United States, under 
our Constitution, you are a citizen like 
everybody else. You can’t wave a magic 
wand over your friends and say that 
they don’t have to comply with lawful 
subpoenas. 
So this witness is in contempt of our 
committee and the United States Con-
gress. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, Republicans will offer 
an amendment to the rule to provide 
for the additional consideration of H.R. 
2729, the Finish the Wall Act, authored 
by Representative HIGGINS. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment into the RECORD, along with ex-
traneous material, immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. 
FISCHBACH. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
while the majority is playing their po-
litical games in Washington, a real cri-
sis situation at our southern border re-
mains. Illegal immigration is at a 
record high, and there are real human 
costs associated with that. 
Between the dangerous journey to 
get to our border and the dangerous 
people coming across and continuing to 
commit crimes, people are dying in 
huge numbers because of this crisis. 
It is no secret that fentanyl is com-
ing across the southern border. This 
year, Border Patrol has seized twice as 
much of this deadly drug as last year, 
and more than 100,000 Americans have 
died from overdoses. 
Because we essentially have an open 
border, there is no way to effectively 
keep criminals from crossing into our 
country. 
Immigrants need to know there is a 
process for becoming an American and 
doing it in the wrong way will have 
consequences. 
Finishing the wall would be a huge 
deterrent for these bad actors. We must 
finish the wall to slow the massive 
numbers of illegal immigrants we are 
seeing before we can have a serious 
conversation about immigration re-
form. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
TONY 
GONZALES). 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
the previous question and to further 
highlight the failed border policies in-
flicted on the American people by 
President Biden’s administration. 
Border security is national security. 
My district is over 820 miles of the 
southern border, over 40 percent of our 
entire border with Mexico. 
Every day, I see the challenges my 
constituents face because this adminis-
tration has failed to protect them and 
failed to prioritize their safety as 
American citizens. 
Every day, I hear from Border Patrol 
agents about the struggles that they 
face because of a lack of resources and 
their demanding work schedules. 
Every day, I talk to constituents and 
border-town mayors who share their 
troubling experiences in dealing with 
burglaries and high-speed car chases. 
Enough fentanyl has been seized at 
the border to kill every American in 
the United States. 
Enough is enough. The Biden admin-
istration’s failed policies and open-bor-
der rhetoric have led to a historic

surge in illegal immigration. We need 
to find a permanent solution that com-
bines border security and legal immi-
gration. So long as I am in Congress, I 
will fight every day to ensure that we 
secure the southern border. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I appreciate, of course, the tempta-
tion to just change the subject and 
talk about something completely dif-
ferent because there are no arguments 
left on their side. 
The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in 
the Trump v. Bennie Thompson case, in 
an opinion of more than 50 pages, re-
viewed all the arguments on both sides 
about executive privilege and said ex-
ecutive privilege is a claim which, of 
course, belongs primarily and prin-
cipally to the existing President of the 
United States, not to a former Presi-
dent of the United States. To the ex-
tent that a former President of the 
United States can raise it, the pre-
sumption is that the people in our con-
stitutional democracy have a right to 
all the information they seek in order 
to govern themselves. 
That is what the investigative power 
of Congress is about. We have a right 
to obtain the information we need in 
order to legislate. So the presumption 
is that we get it. That can only be 
overcome if a sitting President—or in 
perhaps some exceptional cases, a 
former President—demonstrates there 
is some compelling need that would 
override the fundamental right of the 
people to get the information we want. 
The D.C. Circuit panel found unani-
mously that not only had they not 
shown there was a compelling need on 
Donald Trump’s team, they didn’t even 
identify a potentially compelling need. 
Of course, there isn’t one. Why? The 
Supreme Court has already found that 
executive privilege does not cover 
criminal activity; much less could ex-
ecutive privilege cover insurrectionary 
activity or activity designed to pro-
mote an insurrection or a coup against 
the United States of America. 
So I welcome my colleagues talking 
about anything else because it simply 
demonstrates their abandonment of the 
executive privilege argument, an argu-
ment also that has been abandoned by 
Mr. Meadows himself, who voluntarily 
turned over 9,000 pages worth of docu-
ments to our committee, thereby say-
ing there was no privilege at all. 
But now he is refusing to testify 
about it, apparently because of Donald 
Trump’s explosive reaction to the pub-
lication of Mark Meadows’ book. I am 
sorry, that is not a constitutional de-
fense to being called to testify before 
Congress. You can’t say a former Presi-
dent is mad at me and wants to wave a 
magic wand so I don’t have to testify. 
That doesn’t work in our system of 
government. 
Mr. Meadows must come and testify, 
like hundreds of people have come to 
testify before our committee about this 
brutal attack on our system of govern-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished gentleman of 
the January 6 Select Committee for 
yielding. 
I serve as the chair of the Sub-
committee on Crime, Terrorism, and 
Homeland Security, which, collectively 
with the Judiciary Committee, may ul-
timately be addressing the legislative 
aspect of what we are here for. 
In particular, Mr. Speaker, this is a 
very sad day. I served with our former 
colleague, Mr. Meadows, a Member of 
the United States Congress. I believe 
that it was a number of years that he 
rose and took an oath to the Constitu-
tion of the United States of America. 
b 1230 
In that oath he should have recog-
nized the fact that the Article I body 
which we stand in today indicates that 
all legislative powers herein granted 
shall be vested in a Congress of the 
United States, which shall consist of a 
Senate and House of Representatives. 
All legislative powers. In order to 
have legislative powers, one must have 
the facts. That is what is being asked 
for today. 
I think the American people need to 
understand that although there may be 
many concerns—I am from Texas as 
well; I know the border is not in crisis. 
It should be addressed. We as Texans 
know how to address it, and President 
Biden and Vice President HARRIS know 
how to address it, as other Presidents 
have. People are fleeing for their lives. 
But our Constitution says of the Con-
gress ‘‘to make all Laws which shall be 
necessary and proper for carrying into 
execution the foregoing powers, and all 
other powers vested by this Constitu-
tion in the Government of the United 
States, or in any department or officer 
thereof.’’ 
We are vested with a lot of powers. 
One of them is to be able to find the 
truth, to determine how we preserve 
our democracy, and how we need to 
legislate to do so. So I stand on the 
Constitution as I proceed with why we 
should move forward. 
Again, this is a very sad day, but 
Mark Randall Meadows, former White 
House chief of staff, had a part in the 
perpetration of the big lie of the elec-
tion fraud, and we must investigate it. 
Mr. Meadows was one of a relatively 
small group of people who witnessed 
the events of January 6 in the White 
House with the former President. He 
was there. Firsthand knowledge. 
Some of these that I will recite have 
already been recited, but they are only 
a small measure with the huge bounty 
of documents that he and his lawyer 
consented to give to this committee. 
Consented to give. Consented to give. 
Voluntarily. 
And so one must understand that 
when you do that, there is a question of 
waiver of the so-called alleged privilege 
that you are alleging, the executive 
privilege. But the courts have already 
indicated that the privilege lies with 
the existing President, not the former 
President. 
With that in mind, should we not rec-
ognize that the very allies, the media 
allies of the President—the former 
President, Laura Ingraham said to 
Mark, ‘‘The President needs to tell peo-
ple in the Capitol to go home. This is 
hurting all of us.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Brian Kilmeade, 
‘‘Please get him on TV. Destroying ev-
erything you have accomplished.’’ 
Sean Hannity, ‘‘Can he make a state-
ment?’’ 
And Donald Trump Jr., in profanity, 
said, Please help us. 
But I want to just say, the United 
States v. Bryan says, ‘‘A subpoena has 
never been treated as an invitation to 
a game of hare and hounds, in which 
the witness must testify only if cor-
nered at the end of the chase. If that 
were the case, then, indeed, the great 
power of testimonial compulsion, so 
necessary to the effective functioning 
of courts and legislatures, would be a 
nullity. We have often iterated the im-
portance of this public duty, which 
every person within the jurisdiction of 
the Government is bound to perform 
when properly summoned.’’ We must do 
this, sadly, in order for his remarks to 
save the democracy to be heard. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary, on Homeland 
Security, and on the Budget, I rise in support 
of the rule governing debate for H. Res. 851, 
‘‘Recommending That The House of Rep-
resentatives Find Mark Randall Meadows In 
Contempt of Congress for Refusal to Comply 
with a Subpoena Duly Issued by the Select 
Committee to Investigate the January 6th At-
tack on The United States Capitol.’’ 
It is with a heavy heart that I stand here 
today; this resolution will find a former col-
league in contempt of the very body he once 
faithfully served. 
However, protecting our democracy is the 
ultimate duty for each of us in this body, so 
we will do what must be done. 
It is my sincere hope that during the course 
of this day, Mr. Meadows will reverse course 
and agree to comply with this lawful sub-
poena, in order to protect the dignity and 
sanctity of Congress. 
On January 6th, the domestic terrorists who 
beat law enforcement officers and breached 
the Citadel of democracy of the United States 
proudly wore symbols of White Supremacist 
groups, waved confederate flags, hung a 
noose on the lawn, and they shouted racial 
epithets. 
Mark 
Randall 
Meadows, 
former 
White 
House Chief of Staff, had a part in the perpet-
uation of the Big Lie of election fraud, and we 
must investigate and report upon the facts, cir-
cumstances, and causes ‘‘relating to the inter-
ference with the peaceful transfer of power’’ 
that Mr. Meadows was involved in. 
Mr. Meadows was one of a relatively small 
group of people who witnessed the events of

January 6 in the White House and with the 
former president. 
Mr. Meadows was with the former president 
on January 6 as he learned about the attack 
on the U.S. Capitol and decided whether to 
issue a statement that could stop the rioters. 
In fact, according to documents already 
handed over to the Committee, as the vio-
lence at the Capitol unfolded, Mr. Meadows 
received many messages encouraging him to 
have the former president issue a statement 
that could end the violence. 
According to the records, multiple Fox News 
hosts, and the former president’s son knew 
that the former president needed to act imme-
diately. 
They texted Mr. Meadows, and he turned 
over these texts to this Committee. 
These are some of those texts: 
Laura Ingraham texted, ‘‘Mark, the president 
needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. 
This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his 
legacy.’’ 
Brian Kilmeade texted, ‘‘Please, get him on 
TV destroying everything you have accom-
plished.’’ 
Sean Hannity texted, ‘‘Can he make a state-
ment? Ask people to leave the Capitol.’’ 
Donald Trump Jr. texted, ‘‘he’s got to con-
demn this shit ASAP. The Capitol Police tweet 
is not enough.’’ 
To this last text, Meadows responded, ‘‘I’m 
pushing it hard. I agree.’’ 
One former White House employee report-
edly contacted Mr. Meadows several times 
and told him, ‘‘[you guys have to say some-
thing. Even if the president’s not willing to put 
out a statement, you should go to the [cam-
eras] and say, ‘We condemn this. Please 
stand down.’ If you don’t, people are going to 
die.’’ 
As time passed without the former president 
intervening, Donald Trump Jr. again texted, 
‘‘we need an Oval Office address. He has to 
lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out 
of hand.’’ 
But still, hours passed without necessary 
action by the president. 
Moreover, Mr. Meadows reportedly spoke 
with Kashyap Patel, who was then the chief of 
staff to former Acting Secretary of Defense 
Christopher Miller, ‘‘nonstop’’ throughout the 
day of January 6. 
Mr. Meadows apparently knows if and when 
the former president was engaged in discus-
sions regarding the National Guard’s response 
to the Capitol riot, a point that is contested but 
about which Mr. Meadows provided docu-
ments to the Select Committee and spoke 
publicly on national television after the former 
president left office. 
But Mr. Meadows knows much more than 
just what happened during the attack. 
Prior to the January 6 attack, Mr. Meadows 
received text messages and emails regarding 
apparent efforts to encourage Republican leg-
islators in certain States to send alternate 
slates of electors to Congress, a plan which 
one Member of Congress acknowledged was 
‘‘highly controversial’’ and to which Mr. Mead-
ows responded, ‘‘I love it.’’ 
Mr. Meadows traveled to Georgia to ob-
serve an audit of the votes days after then- 
the former president complained that the audit 
had been moving too slowly and claimed that 
the signature-match system was rife with 
fraud. That trip precipitated the former presi-
dent’s calls to Georgia’s deputy secretary of 
state and, later, secretary of state. 
In the call with Georgia’s secretary of state, 
which Mr. Meadows joined, the former presi-
dent pressed his unsupported claims of wide-
spread election fraud, including claims related 
to deceased people voting, forged signatures, 
out-of-State voters, shredded ballots, triple- 
counted ballots, Dominion voting machines, 
and suitcase ballots, before telling the sec-
retary of state that he wanted to find enough 
votes to ensure his victory. 
Mr. Meadows was chief of staff during the 
post-election period when other White House 
staff, including the press secretary, advanced 
claims of election fraud. 
In one press conference, the press sec-
retary claimed that there were ‘‘very real 
claims’’ of fraud that the former president’s re- 
election campaign was pursuing and said that 
mail-in voting was one that ‘‘we have identified 
as being particularly prone to fraud.’’ 
Mr. Meadows participated in a meeting that 
reportedly occurred on December 18, 2020, 
with the former president, the White House 
counsel, an attorney associated with the cam-
paign, White House staff, and private citizens, 
on proposals relating to challenging the 2020 
election results. 
Mr. Meadows reportedly sent an email— 
subject line: ‘‘Constitutional Analysis of the 
Vice President’s Authority for January 6, 2021, 
Vote Count’’—to a member of then-Vice Presi-
dent Pence’s senior staff containing a memo 
written by an attorney affiliated with the former 
president’s re-election campaign. 
The memo argued that the Vice President 
could declare electoral votes in six States in 
dispute when they came up for a vote during 
the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 
2021, which would require those States’ legis-
latures to send a response to Congress by 7 
p.m. EST on January 15 or, if they did not, 
then congressional delegations would vote for 
the former president’s re-election. 
Mr. Meadows was in contact with at least 
some of the private individuals who planned 
and organized a January 6 rally, one of whom 
reportedly may have expressed safety con-
cerns to Mr. Meadows about January 6 
events. 
It is apparent that Mr. Meadows’s testimony 
and document production are of critical impor-
tance to the Select Committee’s investigation, 
and Congress, through the Select Committee, 
is entitled to discover facts concerning what 
led to the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Janu-
ary 6, as well as White House officials’ actions 
and communications during and after the at-
tack. 
Mr. Meadows is uniquely situated to provide 
key information, having straddled an official 
role in the White House and unofficial role re-
lated to the former president’s reelection cam-
paign since at least election day in 2020 
through January 6. 
Mr. Meadows was required under federal 
law to turn over documents to investigators 
and appear for a deposition in accordance 
with a subpoena the committee issued, but he 
did not comply by the dates set in the sub-
poena. 
An individual—whether a member of the 
public or an executive branch official—has a 
legal (and patriotic) obligation to comply with a 
duly issued and valid congressional subpoena, 
unless a valid and overriding privilege or other 
legal justification permits noncompliance. 
In United States v. Bryan, the Supreme 
Court stated: 
A subpoena has never been treated as an 
invitation to a game of hare and hounds, in 
which the witness must testify only if cornered 
at the end of the chase. If that were the case, 
then, indeed, the great power of testimonial 
compulsion, so necessary to the effective 
functioning of courts and legislatures, would 
be a nullity. We have often iterated the impor-
tance of this public duty, which every person 
within the jurisdiction of the Government is 
bound to perform when properly summoned. 
The Select Committee seeks testimony from 
Mr. Meadows on information for which there 
can be no conceivable privilege claim. 
In fact, the non-privileged nature of some 
key information has been recognized by Mr. 
Meadows’s own documents which he has pre-
viously handed over to the Committee. 
Congress is entitled to Mr. Meadows’s testi-
mony on that information, regardless of his 
claims of privilege over other categories of in-
formation. 
In United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 
703–16 (1974), the Supreme Court recognized 
an implied constitutional privilege protecting 
presidential communications. 
The Court held though that the privilege is 
qualified, not absolute, and that it is limited to 
communications made ‘‘in performance of [a 
President’s] responsibilities of his office and 
made in the process of shaping policies and 
making decisions.’’ 
Mr. Meadows has refused to testify in re-
sponse to the subpoena ostensibly based on 
broad and undifferentiated assertions of var-
ious privileges, including claims of executive 
privilege purportedly asserted by former-Presi-
dent Trump. 
However, his claims of testimonial immunity 
and executive privilege do not justify Mr. 
Meadows’s conduct with respect to the Select 
Committee’s subpoena. 
His legal position is untenable in light of Mr. 
Meadows’s public descriptions of events in the 
book that he is trying to sell and during his nu-
merous television appearances, and his own 
previously produced documents. 
Even if privileges were applicable to some 
aspects of Mr. Meadows’s testimony, he was 
required to appear before the Select Com-
mittee for his deposition, answer any ques-
tions concerning non-privileged information, 
and assert any such privilege on a question- 
by-question basis. 
After promising to appear, Mr. Meadows has 
now reversed course and resumed his con-
temptuous behavior. 
Mr. Meadows’s conduct in response to the 
Select Committee’s subpoena constitutes a 
violation of the contempt of Congress statutory 
provisions. 
The contempt of Congress statute makes 
clear that a witness summoned before Con-
gress must appear or be ‘‘deemed guilty of a 
misdemeanor’’ punishable by a fine of up to 
$100,000 and imprisonment for up to one 
year. 
Further, the Supreme Court has empha-
sized that the subpoena power is a ‘‘public 
duty, which every person within the jurisdiction 
of the Government is bound to perform when 
properly summoned.’’ 
The Supreme Court also recently reinforced 
this clear obligation by stating that ‘‘when Con-
gress seeks information needed for intelligent 
legislative action, it unquestionably remains 
the duty of all citizens to cooperate.’’ 
DOJ’s legitimacy and effectiveness depends 
on the public’s confidence that its administra-
tion and enforcement of federal laws is done

December 14, 2021 
impartially, free from actual or perceived par-
tisan or political influence. 
Mr. Speaker, the January 6 insurrection 
caused tragic loss of life and many injuries, 
while leaving behind widespread physical 
damage to the Capitol Complex and emotional 
trauma for Members, congressional employ-
ees, and the Capitol Police. 
It bears repeating often that the Congress 
and the Nation owe undying gratitude to the 
men and women who answered the call of 
constitutional duty and heroically won the day 
on that bloody and deadly afternoon. 
Mr. Speaker, the domestic terrorists and 
seditionists who attacked the Capitol Building 
on January 6, 2021 were not, as some of their 
ardent defenders and apologists across the 
aisle have stated falsely, on a ‘‘normal tour 
visit’’; nor was their effort to lay siege to the 
Capitol and disrupt the processes of govern-
ment an act of persons who love their country. 
And it is absurd to suggest that it was a 
celebration of the United States and what it 
stands for when the leading edge of terrorists 
desecrated the Capitol by offensively parading 
the treasonous Confederate flag through the 
building and when, because of their insurrec-
tion, several members of law enforcement 
made the supreme sacrifice and scores more 
were seriously injured. 
Mr. Speaker, we owe it not just to those 
who lost their lives on January 6th, but to all 
Americans to figure out what happened and 
how that day came to be. 
We must understand that day in order to 
prevent the intended purpose of the January 6 
insurrection—to disrupt the Joint Meeting of 
Congress to tally the votes of Presidential 
electors and announce the results to the Na-
tion and the world—from every occurring 
again. 
This attack on our Capitol Building was the 
greatest threat to the American experiment 
since the Civil War when the pro-slavery 
forces decided to wage war, rather than let the 
Nation survive, and the pro-freedom forces 
would accept war rather than let the Nation 
perish. 
The Select Committee has diligently contin-
ued in their duty to determine the causes and 
events that transpired during the insurrec-
tionist attack. 
Specifically, the Select Committee’s pur-
poses include: 
To investigate and report upon the facts, cir-
cumstances, and causes ‘‘relating to the Janu-
ary 6, 2021 domestic terrorist attack upon the 
United States Capitol Complex.’’ 
To investigate and report upon the facts, cir-
cumstances, and causes ‘‘relating to the inter-
ference with the peaceful transfer of power.’’ 
To investigate and report upon the facts, cir-
cumstances, and causes relating to ‘‘the influ-
encing factors that fomented such an attack 
on American representative democracy while 
engaged in a constitutional process.’’ 
Understanding the full role that Mr. Mead-
ows played in the events that led up to the 
January 6th attack is crucial to preventing any-
thing like this from ever happening again. 
Rather than comply with Congress’ inherent 
powers, and help heal the trauma this Nation 
witnessed on January 6th, Mr. Meadows has 
simply refused to comply with the Select Com-
mittee’s subpoena. 
Mr. Speaker, this should not be a partisan 
issue; it is the very power of Congress to in-
vestigate matters of issue that is at stake. 
For this reason, I rise in total support of the 
rule governing debate for H. Res. 851, ‘‘Rec-
ommending That The House of Representa-
tives Find Jeffrey Bossert Clark In Contempt 
of Congress for Refusal to Comply with a Sub-
poena Duly Issued by the Select Committee to 
Investigate the January 6th Attack on The 
United States Capitol.’’ 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank the gentlewoman for her very 
insightful remarks. The committee has 
referred often to the passage that the 
gentlewoman identifies by the Su-
preme Court saying that a subpoena to 
come and testify is not an invitation to 
a game of hare and hounds. That is a 
little 
old-fashioned. 
Basically, 
the 
court is saying it is not a game of hide- 
and-seek or cat-and-mouse. 
You are told to come and testify, and 
you must. That is what the vast major-
ity of people have been doing in our in-
vestigation and the vast majority of 
Americans do all across the land when 
they are subpoenaed to come to court. 
It seems like a tiny handful of people 
who think that somehow they are 
above the law because they know a 
former President of the United States. 
I am sorry, that is just not how our 
legal system works. We have no kings 
here, as Judge Chutkan emphasized at 
the district court in rejecting Donald 
Trump’s claims against our committee. 
We have no kings here. Everyone is 
subject to the law. We have no nobles. 
We have no lords. Congress cannot 
award titles of nobility here. We are all 
equals, and we are all subject to the 
law. It is a crime in the District of Co-
lumbia not to comply with a subpoena, 
punishable by up to 1 year in jail and a 
$100,000 fine. Very serious business. 
Now, if you think you have got some 
kind of legal privilege against testi-
fying, like the marital privilege or the 
priest-penitent privilege or the doctor- 
patient privilege or the executive privi-
lege, you come, you show up, you tes-
tify, and you invoke it as to a specific 
question. 
Mr. Speaker, the reason why this 
case is overwhelmingly easy, we would 
argue 100 percent easy, is because we 
are talking about testimony by Mr. 
Meadows that he has been subpoenaed 
to give relating to 9,000 documents that 
he has already admitted are not privi-
leged by the executive privilege or the 
Fifth Amendment or anything else. He 
has said, here, take them. This is evi-
dence about what happened. And right-
fully so did he do that. 
I will express my personal dis-
appointment that Donald Trump’s ex-
plosive rage about the publication of 
Mr. Meadows’ book occasioned some 
kind of change in his attitude about it, 
but regardless of his subjective atti-
tude, he has a legal obligation to show 
up and to answer the questions of this 
committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New Mexico (Ms. HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in support of the Finish the Wall 
Act, for which I am a proud cosponsor. 
By the end of this year, 2 million peo-
ple will have tried to cross our borders 
illegally. That is more than or almost 
as many people as the State I rep-
resent. Hundreds of thousands have 
succeeded, and many thousands more 
are being released into our commu-
nities, never to return to an immigra-
tion status hearing. 
When Border Patrol agents coura-
geously tried to do their jobs against 
overwhelming odds, they were attacked 
by President Biden, who said that he 
would make them pay. That is not how 
we lead a country. That is not how we 
treat American heroes who keep us 
safe. 
But past Presidents did not abandon 
our border. Under President Trump, 458 
miles of border wall system were com-
pleted, with hundreds more fully fund-
ed. Of course, on his first day in office, 
President Biden sabotaged this impor-
tant project and undermined the phys-
ical border security promised to the 
American people. 
This is unacceptable. We must pro-
tect our country. We must protect our 
people. We must finish the wall. 
This legislation would compel the 
White House and the Department of 
Homeland Security to do their jobs. 
The funding is there. The plans are 
there. The materials are there. All we 
lack is leadership from the Oval Office. 
And until true leadership returns to 
the White House, the people’s House 
will have to step in and solve the Biden 
border crisis. 
I urge my colleagues to pass the Fin-
ish the Wall Act, keep our promises, 
and secure our borders. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. I 
just want to emphasize that in his dis-
tinguished service in this Chamber, Mr. 
MEADOWS would never tolerate an exec-
utive official simply deciding to blow 
off a subpoena of the U.S. Congress. He 
said, ‘‘Whether you are a Republican or 
a Democrat, this kind of obstruction is 
wrong, period.’’ 
He repeatedly complained about in-
transigence and delays by the execu-
tive branch. So I think he understands 
exactly why this is a matter of such 
gravity to our body. 
Now, as I was saying, as a member, 
not just of the Rules Committee but 
also of the January 6th Select Com-
mittee, we have seen overwhelming 
participation and cooperation by the 
people we have called. Most people are 
doing their legal duty and their civic 
and patriotic duty by coming forward 
and voluntarily saying, here is what I 
know, and here is the information I 
have got to help you put together a re-
port for the American people. 
It just seems as we have gotten clos-
er and closer to Donald Trump, that is 
where we are running into the obstruc-
tionism, as from Steve Bannon, as from 
Jeffrey Clark. And now we have got 
this problem we are in with Mark

Meadows, who had been on the path of 
cooperation, had turned over these 
thousands of documents, and now he is 
in the very awkward position of saying 
he is not going to testify about thou-
sands of documents that he already 
turned over to us, which demonstrate 
how radically dangerous that day, in 
fact, was. 
Let me just read a few more of the 
texts that Mr. Meadows disclosed to 
our committee: One text said, ‘‘We are 
under siege here at the Capitol.’’ That 
came to him on January 6. 
Another, ‘‘They have breached the 
Capitol.’’ 
‘‘Mark, 
protesters 
are 
literally 
storming the Capitol. Breaking win-
dows on doors. Rushing in. Is Trump 
going to say something?’’ 
‘‘We are all helpless.’’ 
Dozens 
of 
texts, 
including 
from 
Trump administration officials, urged 
immediate action by the President, 
‘‘POTUS has to come out firmly and 
tell the protesters to dissipate. Some-
one is going to get killed.’’ 
And, of course, several people died on 
that day and within days of the attack 
on January 6. 
In another, ‘‘Mark, he needs to stop 
this now.’’ 
A third in all caps, ‘‘TELL THEM TO 
GO HOME.’’ 
A fourth, and I quote, ‘‘POTUS needs 
to calm this’’—expletive deleted, excre-
ment—‘‘down.’’ 
Multiple FOX News hosts themselves 
knew the President needed to act im-
mediately. They texted Mr. Meadows. 
He turned over those texts to us. 
‘‘Mark, President needs to tell people 
in the Capitol to go home. This is hurt-
ing all of us. He is destroying his leg-
acy,’’ wrote Laura Ingraham. 
Brian Kilmeade texted, ‘‘Please get 
him on TV. Destroying everything you 
have accomplished.’’ 
Sean Hannity urged by text, ‘‘Can he 
make a statement? Ask people to leave 
the Capitol.’’ And so on. 
We need to find out what actions 
were taken in response to all of those 
entreaties from Members of Congress, 
from members of the media, from 
members of Trump’s own family, what 
sequence of events took place after-
wards. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. GARBARINO.) 
Mr. GARBARINO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to urge the defeat of the previous 
question so we can immediately con-
sider H.R. 2729, the Finish the Wall 
Act. 
My colleague on the other side of the 
aisle said that there is no crisis at the 
southern border. I think the American 
people would disagree with her. 
She says the administration has the 
solution. I wish they wouldn’t keep it a 
secret. 
The crisis at the southern border has 
reached a tipping point. Illegal border 
crossings at record highs, and yet this 
administration refuses to act. 
I visited the southern border and saw 
for myself how bad things are. I also 
saw piles of building materials already 
paid for, sitting unused like rubble 
next to a partially built wall that des-
perately needs to be finished. The tem-
porary fencing left in place is laugh-
able. I could have walked right through 
the gaping holes and had myself a nice 
vacation. 
Now, imagine you were on the other 
side of the fence, desperate to get to 
America where the President has as-
sured you that you could stay, if only 
you made it to the other side. You 
would be pretty well motivated, and, 
thankfully, we have left the door open 
for them. 
The wall is paid for; we just have to 
finish building it. This bill requires the 
Secretary of Homeland Security to re-
sume construction of the border wall 
within 24 hours of enactment using 
funds Congress has already appro-
priated for building the wall. 
The wall is more than just a fence. It 
includes sensors and technology the 
Border Patrol needs to effectively hold 
the line. The agents I spoke with at the 
border are doing everything they can 
to stop illegal crossings, but they are 
overwhelmed and under-equipped. Now 
drug smugglers, human traffickers, 
gangs, and terrorists are taking full ad-
vantage of this vulnerability. 
While turning a blind eye to the dan-
gers of our border crisis may serve this 
administration’s agenda, it does not 
serve the American people, and it cer-
tainly doesn’t serve my constituents. 
On Long Island, law enforcement con-
tinues to grapple with preventing MS– 
13 from getting a stronghold in our 
communities. But MS–13 gang members 
are emboldened by the policies of this 
administration and exploiting the cri-
sis at our border to gain access to our 
country. 
I urge this body to act and imme-
diately consider H.R. 2729 to finish the 
border wall construction and help stop 
the influx of drugs, criminal activity, 
and gang violence that is brought by 
MS–13 into this country. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to defeat the previous question. I 
love this righteous discussion about 
law and order. It has been nearly 1 year 
of one-party rule for this country, and 
I speak for my constituents—I rise as a 
Texan—and countless others across the 
Nation who have whiplash from being 
tossed from one crisis to another crisis 
to yet another crisis caused by the 
policies, the misguided policies of this 
administration. 
We are not changing the subject here. 
We are actually staying focused on the 
issues that matter to most Americans, 
the complete breakdown of respect for 
law enforcement and the rule of law. 
Since we are talking about the rule of 
law, the breakdown of the rule of law 
has crime running rampant. We have 
heard about fentanyl; we have heard 
about the rising crime in communities 
like mine because of the open border 
that we have. 
b 1245 
You know who doesn’t show up for 
court orders? 99.9 percent of the illegal 
immigrants who are served those pa-
pers, they are the ones who don’t show 
up, since we are talking about the rule 
of law. 
We have Americans, as a matter of 
fact, that are still stranded behind 
enemy lines after President Biden’s Af-
ghanistan 
catastrophe. 
Communist 
China is enjoying their free pass after 
unleashing COVID–19 on the world and 
committing literal genocide on Uyghur 
Muslims in China. Millions of Ameri-
cans are at risk of losing their jobs if 
they don’t comply with the tyrannical 
mask mandate, a crippling national 
debt, an impending energy crisis, and 
an all-out humanitarian disaster on 
our border; those are the issues that we 
are not changing the subject on, we are 
actually focusing on. 
But today, instead of addressing 
these crises, Democrats have recycled 
their old tricks and are wasting time 
trying to punish, yet again, President 
Trump. 
You can only beat the same dead 
horse so many times. 
Republicans are here to work, and it 
is long past time that action is taken 
to quell these crises. We are urging our 
Democratic colleagues to look at the 
crisis at hand. When is the last time 
that one of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle visited the border and 
can speak with any sort of authority 
that we don’t have a crisis? 
We need to stop illegal immigration. 
We need to finish the wall. We have got 
to secure this border. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK) 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to help de-
feat the previous question and, for once 
and for all, address this lingering crisis 
that we know is, in fact, a crisis. 
The 
travesties 
unfolding 
on 
our 
southwest border can no longer be ig-
nored. And I know we know the facts. 
I know my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle know the drugs that are 
pouring into our communities killing 
thousands as a direct result of the open 
border policy. 
But few times have we seen or heard 
the stories of how people are actually 
being affected. Just a couple days ago, 
I received a text message from a Border 
Patrol agent. An American mother and 
her daughter were traveling and were 
killed in a head-on collision with an il-
legal smuggling six other illegals. They 
were evading, driving at a fast pace, 
and instead, killed a very young fam-
ily. In his words, this Border Patrol 
agent said it was just a matter of time. 
This happens all the time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7652 
December 14, 2021 
That is unacceptable that it is just a 
matter of time. Well, it is just a matter 
of time before this body takes action, 
and it is probably going to be in about 
12 months. 
The broken policies of this adminis-
tration have broken our families here 
in the United States. They are the true 
victims of President Biden and the 
Democrats in action. And it is stun-
ning to hear and demoralize and to 
strip those that are trying to uphold 
the very law that they took an oath to 
protect. I wish my colleagues would do 
the same, because it is unacceptable to 
hear from our own that it is just a mat-
ter of time. It is just a matter of time 
before someone else gets killed or an-
other family gets broken or someone 
else overdoses from the incredible 
amount of drugs that are pouring into 
our community. 
But we have solutions, and we have 
resources. And that is why we need to 
continue to finish to build the wall, the 
force multiplier that our very own 
agents have said time and time again 
will save lives and prevent more trage-
dies. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
help defeat the previous question so 
that we can do what we said we would 
do: Finish the wall. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The gentlewoman invokes the oath of 
office. Former President Trump swore 
an oath to uphold and defend our Con-
stitution, and we have all of these 
tweets which clearly indicate he wasn’t 
doing that. 
H. Res. 503 authorizes and obligates 
our committee to get to the particulars 
and details of what took place on Janu-
ary 6, what were the causes behind it, 
and what do we need to do to defend 
ourselves in the future against these 
kinds of attacks on our election proc-
ess, on the peaceful transfer of power, 
and on the workings of Congress. 
That is what we are doing. 
And with their January 6 case col-
lapsing all around them, my colleagues 
now head for the border in their rhet-
oric, and I don’t blame them for doing 
that. But they are not going to fool the 
American people. People understand 
exactly what is happening here. 
The prior speaker said that it is a 
crime not to show up for a subpoena, 
and he said you know who does that, 
undocumented aliens. Well, then it is 
undocumented aliens, Steve Bannon, 
and Mark Meadows who are violating 
the law. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, the members of the January 6th 
Commission have turned this body into 
a star chamber, using the powers of 
Congress to persecute and bankrupt 
their political opponents. 
Using political power to destroy your 
political opponents is evil and un- 
American. We are not a banana repub-
lic. 
Right now, the American people are 
suffering under the harsh economic re-
alities of the Biden administration: 
Record-high inflation, record-high gas 
prices, record-high home heating bills, 
empty shelves at Christmas. COVID 
mandates and lockdowns continue to 
threaten our economy and our chil-
dren’s future. 
What is the January 6th Commis-
sion’s response to the suffering of the 
American people under Biden’s poli-
cies? A never-ending political witch 
hunt against President Trump. 
The January 6th Commission hates 
President Trump because he exposed 
the corruption of the D.C. establish-
ment here in the swamp. 
This January 6th Commission is a 
disgrace, and anyone who voted for it 
should be ashamed of themselves. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this rule. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New Mexico (Ms. HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to ask my fellow Members of 
Congress to think about the reputation 
of this institution, the trust of the 
American people, and beyond their po-
litical passions of the moment. 
I ask, frankly, for us to be statesmen. 
Rather than focusing on inflation, 
jobs, or the border, our colleagues 
across the aisle are focused on this dis-
traction. 
House Democrats have now held or 
threaten to hold three Americans in 
contempt of Congress for refusal to 
comply with their arbitrary demands. 
Democrats assured us that if their 
first target, Steve Bannon, had just 
shown up to be deposed, he would not 
have faced consequences. However, Mr. 
Bannon felt that this would violate 
former President Trump’s executive 
privilege and raised questions to the 
committee in letters from his attorney. 
Next, the January 6th Committee 
threatened Jeffrey Clark with con-
tempt, holding a Rules Committee 
hearing for the contempt charge. This 
was based on Mr. Clark agreeing to ap-
pear but not saying exactly what the 
partisan political operatives of the 
committee wanted him to say, while 
Mr. Clark asserted his constitutional 
rights. 
It is a staggering abuse of power for 
the House of Representatives to threat-
en someone for merely using the rights 
the Constitution affords them. 
Now we reach my friend, Mark Mead-
ows. He has cooperated, and provided 
thousands of pages of documents; how-
ever, Mr. Meadows, President Trump’s 
chief of staff during January 6, invoked 
his executive privilege. In his opinion, 
his testimony about interactions with 
President Trump would erode all future 
use of executive privilege. Even after 
Mr. Meadows turned over texts, Demo-
crats have now gone so far as to sub-
poena Verizon for Mr. Meadows’ phone 
records. 
Such naked scheming should stay in 
House of Cards and other TV shows, 
not in this Chamber. 
What is the purpose of this? Is it not 
to secure the Capitol? It is a political 
exercise to exact political revenge 
against allies and employees of the 
former President. 
This is about using the government 
to punish political adversaries. This is 
not an American practice but some-
thing akin to a banana republic on its 
way to tyranny. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
I have no hesitancy to take on the 
distinguished gentleman from Mary-
land on the points that he has made. I 
would say first of all this: I hope that 
he will continue to read those text 
messages because they don’t prove 
what he thinks they prove; quite the 
contrary. 
I can’t think of how many times the 
gentleman from California has spoken 
in derisive terms about Donald Trump, 
Jr., but Donald Trump Jr.’s tweets 
show that he was concerned about ex-
actly the right things. 
You don’t see tweets coming from 
Republicans about bailing out violent 
rioters, abolishing police forces, or de-
crying the plight of Jussie Smollett. 
I think the issue with the effort 
today before the body is how Demo-
crats are dealing with the President’s 
close counselor and the legal principles 
that arise therefrom, especially the 
constant and repeated threat of crimi-
nal prosecution in the face of an unre-
solved issue of privilege. 
When you treat noncompliance as 
willful noncompliance, you mean there 
is a lack of good faith basis. But the 
record in this case in the House Report 
is replete with contentions over the na-
ture and extent of the President’s exec-
utive privilege. 
The positions that are taken on Mr. 
Meadows’ behalf are those that have 
been continually asserted by the De-
partment of Justice; in fact, many oth-
ers. Many other potential objections he 
has completely waived. He has not at-
tempted to assert the fact that your 
subpoena is inquiring into legitimate 
First Amendment rights to associate, 
to speak, to petition for redress or in 
the absence of a legitimate legislative 
purpose. 
And to the point repeated over and 
over by the gentleman from Maryland, 
the current position on privilege is en-
tirely sensible. Mr. Meadows has pro-
duced those documents that are impli-
cated by the current President’s waiver 
of privilege, but he preserves that core 
part of privilege that President Trump 
is likely entitled to preserve; that is to 
say what he was told by one of his clos-
est advisers. 
Nothing illegitimate about it at all. 
What is illegitimate is the decision

December 14, 2021 
made on how to deal with the coun-
selor of a President, the representative 
of a coordinate branch of government. 
The Democrats are setting a new bar. 
Even while the handwriting is on the 
wall, may you enjoy the fruits. Let the 
contempt resolutions and the criminal 
referrals flow freely and quickly as a 
river. Merrick Garland, Ron Klain, 
Hunter Biden, Chuck Dolan, Marc 
Elias, Andrew Weissmann, Alejandro 
Mayorkas. Let them come. 
This is the choice that is being made 
by the Democrats. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, we have heard a lot about text mes-
sages. I would like the Democrats and 
the people on the January 6th Com-
mittee to produce their text messages, 
Mr. Speaker, denouncing antifa, BLM 
riots that raged across American cities 
for a year. I would love to read those. 
But instead, we saw Democrats en-
courage, incite, and continue to call 
these riots peaceful. And then when 
they got arrested and put in jail, they 
bailed them out so they could go out 
and riot some more. 
I rise in opposition to this resolution 
to hold Mark Meadows in contempt of 
Congress because it is being held by 
nothing but a kangaroo court. 
Congress’ job is to make laws, not en-
force them. That is the role of the ex-
ecutive and the judicial branch of this 
government, but somehow the com-
munists here in charge have forgot-
ten—or, no, not forgotten—are pur-
posely abusing the Constitution and 
what this body of Congress is supposed 
to do. 
You see, when we go to this level to 
the point where we are forgetting and 
abusing what our power is, then the 
American people will trust us no more. 
And that is exactly what the January 
6th Committee is doing. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
b 1300 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this select committee is 
clearly operating outside the realm of 
its intended purpose. 
They do not like the information 
they are receiving, and they know they 
aren’t getting anywhere. So, instead, 
they criminally punish those who they 
politically disagree with. 
There isn’t adequate minority rep-
resentation, and because of that, the 
majority has been able to turn the 
committee into a vehicle to push their 
own narrative. It is clearly more inter-
ested in pursuing a partisan agenda to 
politicize the January 6 attack rather 
than conducting a legitimate, good- 
faith investigation into security fail-
ures leading up to that day. 
Again, this is nothing more than an 
attempt by the Democrats to distract 
from the very real issues facing Ameri-
cans every day. I look forward to get-
ting back to the real work of solving 
the supply chain crisis, reclaiming 
American energy production, and em-
powering U.S. citizens to live their 
lives without government interference. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule and 
the underlying legislation, and I urge 
my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, hundreds of people have 
come forward to testify about the vio-
lent and dangerous events of January 6, 
and there are just a handful of people, 
like Mr. Bannon and Mr. Meadows, who 
somehow think they are above the law. 
We are not a banana republic because 
we hold everybody to equality under 
the law. And we are not communists, 
as the gentlewoman from Georgia sug-
gested. Those are just the friends of the 
former President, who you lionize, like 
the dictator of North Korea, who he 
loves, and Vladimir Putin, who said 
that the greatest tragedy of the 20th 
century was the collapse of the Soviet 
Union. So, those are your friends. 
Don’t put them on our side. 
They are saying that the Select Com-
mittee on the January 6th Attack is 
out to persecute and bankrupt their op-
ponents. On the contrary, we are out to 
write a report, under H. Res. 503, to the 
American people about the most vio-
lent, sweeping, and dangerous attack 
on the Republic since the Civil War or 
the War of 1812. 
Mr. Bannon is raising money on it. 
Far from bankrupting Mr. Bannon, he 
is trying to get rich on it. And Mark 
Meadows has written a book where he 
tells all the stories he wants about 
January 6. It is just that he doesn’t 
want to face the rule of law and the 
questions of this bipartisan committee, 
which is making tremendous progress 
in terms of getting the truth of what 
happened on that day. 
Mr. Speaker, I recommend to all of 
my colleagues who invoked the rule of 
law today that they read the D.C. Cir-
cuit Court opinion, which obliterates 
every single argument that they have 
made about executive privilege. It is 
basically gone now because the way the 
law works is the people have a right to 
get the information we want unless 
there is a compelling interest on the 
other side. They haven’t even pre-
tended to invoke a compelling interest. 
What is the compelling interest in 
being able to prepare an insurrection, a 
coup against the government? Is that 
what we want to establish a precedent 
for, that outgoing Presidents can try 
to organize an insurrection against the 
Vice President and encourage people 
who go out and stage a riot against the 
Vice President of the United States 
and the Congress? I don’t think so. 
Mr. Speaker, a couple of the speakers 
said it was absence of legislative pur-
pose. This is the central purpose of our 
government, to make the government 
survive and to go out and serve the 
people. That is what this committee is 
doing. 
Mr. Speaker, he is in contempt. I 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the rule and the 
previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mrs. FISCHBACH is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 848 
At the end of the resolution, add the 
following: 
SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
2729) to immediately resume construction of 
the border wall system along the inter-
national border between the United States 
and Mexico to secure the border, enforce the 
rule of law, and expend appropriated funds as 
mandated by Congress, and for other pur-
poses. All points of order against consider-
ation of the bill are waived. The bill shall be 
considered as read. All points of order 
against provisions in the bill are waived. The 
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the bill and on any amendment 
thereto to final passage without intervening 
motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
Homeland Security; and (2) one motion to re-
commit. 
SEC. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 2729. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7654 
December 14, 2021 
call up House Resolution 849 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 849 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to consider in the 
House the bill (H.R. 5665) to establish in the 
Department of State the Office to Monitor 
and Combat Islamophobia, and for other pur-
poses. All points of order against consider-
ation of the bill are waived. In lieu of the 
amendments recommended by the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs now printed in the 
bill, an amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute consisting of the text of Rules Com-
mittee Print 117-23, modified by the amend-
ment printed in the report of the Committee 
on Rules accompanying this resolution, shall 
be considered as adopted. The bill, as amend-
ed, shall be considered as read. All points of 
order against provisions in the bill, as 
amended, are waived. The previous question 
shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as 
amended, and on any further amendment 
thereto, to final passage without intervening 
motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs or their respective designees; 
and (2) one motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), my good friend, pend-
ing which I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. During consideration of 
this resolution, all time yielded is for 
the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, today, 
the Committee on Rules met and re-
ported a rule which would provide for 
the consideration of H.R. 5665, the 
Combating International Islamophobia 
Act, under a closed rule. 
It provides 1 hour of debate equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs. It self-exe-
cutes a manager’s amendment from 
Chairman MEEKS and provides for one 
motion to recommit. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here today at a 
time when anti-Muslim hatred has 
risen to epidemic proportions. That is 
not my opinion; that is according to 
the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Reli-
gious Freedom and Belief. 
Epidemic proportions, we see it all 
around the world: in China, as the gov-
ernment 
there 
commits 
atrocities 
against the Uyghurs; in Sri Lanka, 
where its President silences dissenting 
voices; in India, as government-led 
crackdowns leave entire neighborhoods 
virtually empty; in Hungary, where 
anti-Muslim sentiment continues to 
build. Unfortunately, I could go on, all 
around the globe. 
Mr. Speaker, this isn’t about the ac-
tions or misguided beliefs of a few. The 
U.N. Human Rights Council has found 
that an average of 37 percent of the 
population in Europe held unfavorable 
views of Muslims. We are talking about 
millions of people and a rising tide of 
hostility, violence, and discrimination 
that we, the Government of the United 
States, must call out and condemn. To 
stand firmly and loudly for human 
rights demands nothing less. 
Mr. Speaker, I am also proud to an-
nounce today that we have reached a 
bipartisan, bicameral agreement on the 
Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act 
that will allow us to move quickly to 
get this bill through Congress and to 
the President because this isn’t a par-
tisan issue. It is a human rights issue, 
and America must lead. 
Mr. Speaker, just as we hold other 
nations to account, we must hold our-
selves to account as well because the 
United States is not immune to these 
trends. The Council on American-Is-
lamic Relations has documented over 
500 complaints of anti-Muslim bias na-
tionwide in just the first half of this 
year. That includes things like hate 
crimes, harassment, school bullying, 
and antimosque violence. 
Sadly, this uptick is part of a larger 
trend. A poll conducted by the AP and 
released this year ahead of the anniver-
sary of 9/11 found that 53 percent of 
Americans have unfavorable views to-
ward Islam. This is the reality of what 
is happening in America today. 
Mr. Speaker, to be honest, we have 
even heard disturbing rhetoric from 
some right here in this institution. A 
Member of this House has told a com-
pletely fabricated story again and 
again that implies a Muslim colleague 
is a terrorist just because they are 
Muslim. 
It may have rolled off her tongue like 
some kind of laugh line, but this is a 
deadly serious matter because it led to 
our colleague, Representative OMAR, 
who has already been the victim of 
years of anti-Muslim bias, receiving 
even more heinous voice mails and 
even death threats. One man went so 
far as to tell her: ‘‘There’s plenty that 
will love the opportunity to take you 
off the face of this’’ blanking Earth. 
Mr. Speaker, I hesitated to even 
quote that here on the floor, but we all 
must understand the gravity of what 
we are dealing with. To hear a Member 
of this Congress say those things, is 
there no bottom anymore? Have things 
sunk that low? 
Two decades ago, it was a Republican 
President, George W. Bush, who told 
the world: ‘‘America treasures the rela-
tionship we have with our many Mus-
lim friends, and we respect the vibrant 
faith of Islam, which inspires countless 
individuals to lead lives of honesty, in-
tegrity, and morality.’’ 
Today, 
it 
is 
a 
Republican 
Congressperson who made headlines for 
comments that disrespect not only 
Congresswoman OMAR and fellow Mus-
lim Members but is a stain on this en-
tire institution. And virtually the en-
tire Republican Conference has said 
nothing. 
Mr. Speaker, what on Earth has the 
Republican Party become? 
I think this House is better than the 
worst actions of a few here, and I think 
the Government of the United States 
can still stand for human rights here 
and around the globe. This rule and the 
underlying resolution is our chance to 
show it. 
Let’s pass this measure so we can 
bring the full weight of our Nation in 
encouraging other nations to also con-
front and condemn the growing stain of 
Islamophobia. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume, and I thank my good friend 
and chairman of the Committee on 
Rules, Chairman MCGOVERN, for yield-
ing me the customary 30 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, in 2018, southwestern 
Pennsylvania witnessed the deadliest 
act of anti-Semitism in our Nation’s 
history when 11 Jewish worshippers 
were killed at the Tree of Life Syna-
gogue in Squirrel Hill. That was the 
first time I ever spoke on the House 
floor; it was to condemn acts of anti- 
Semitism and hatred in all forms. 
No one should ever be attacked and 
no one should ever be denied their 
human rights or dignity because of 
their religious faith. Republicans have 
opposed hate and discrimination of any 
kind, including Islamophobia, but the 
bill made in order under this rule is 
rushed. It is a partisan effort, and it 
fails to address real concerns high-
lighted by both committee Republicans 
and the Biden State Department. 
H.R. 5665 creates a new State Depart-
ment office and a new special envoy po-
sition to combat ‘‘Islamophobia and 
Islamophobic 
incitement.’’ 
Those 
terms are not defined in Federal stat-
ute. They are also not defined in the 
bill. Without clear definitions, even 
First 
Amendment-protected 
speech 
could qualify for an investigation. 
Under this measure, it would be up to 
unelected career bureaucrats at the 
State Department to determine what 
constitutes this phobia and to single 
out groups, to single out governments, 
to single out individuals who do not 
share the political views of those 
unelected, career bureaucrats. 
My Republican colleagues on the 
House Committee on Foreign Affairs 
rightly noted the lack of definitions in 
this bill, and that lack could be used to 
promote anti-Israel sentiment. Unfor-
tunately, efforts to address those con-
cerns were wholly dismissed by com-
mittee Democrats. Further, committee 
Republicans highlighted that this bill 
is absolutely redundant. 
Mr. Speaker, the State Department 
already operates robust human rights 
and religious freedom efforts, and those 
include, and I will list: the Bureau of

Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; 
the Office of International Religious 
Freedom; and the U.S. Commission on 
International Religious Freedom. We 
already have offices for what this bill 
seeks to do. 
b 1315 
Creating a new envoy and office 
would simply duplicate those efforts; it 
would further fragment this important 
advocacy; it would increase the poten-
tial for conflict and delays; and it 
would thwart our efforts to actually 
help persecuted people. 
Their concerns fell on deaf ears. 
If House Democrats are serious about 
addressing 
anti-Muslim 
sentiment, 
then I encourage them to join the long-
standing Republican efforts to hold the 
Chinese Communist Party accountable 
for their genocide against the Uyghur 
people. 
Somewhere between 1 and 3 million 
Uyghurs are currently held against 
their will in modern-day concentration 
camps in Communist China. These peo-
ple are subjected to atrocities that in-
clude forced labor, torture, and en-
forced organ harvesting. 
Families are torn apart. The CCP 
even prohibits parents from teaching 
their Islamic faith to their children. 
Women are suffering forced steriliza-
tion and forced abortion to suppress 
Uyghur Muslim birth rates. 
Anyone who truly supports religious 
freedom and stands against anti-Mus-
lim atrocities should want to hold the 
CCP accountable for their genocide 
against the Uyghur people. 
Yet, earlier this year Democratic 
leadership caved to the Biden adminis-
tration and delayed a strong U.S. re-
sponse to the Uyghur Muslim genocide, 
rather than sending the bipartisan, 
Senate-passed Uyghur Forced Labor 
Prevention Act to the President’s desk. 
It was the Biden administration who 
slow-walked that. 
Last week, we were finally given the 
opportunity to vote on that bill, only 
after the press highlighted Speaker 
PELOSI’s inaction. Further, during the 
committee’s consideration of H.R. 5665, 
Democrats voted down an amendment 
to focus the new office’s efforts on the 
plight of the Uyghurs. 
In closing, it is obvious this bill is 
not combating anti-Muslim violence 
and persecution. If it were, House 
Democrats would have worked with Re-
publicans and the Biden State Depart-
ment on this effort. Instead, the Demo-
crats are advancing this rushed, par-
tisan legislation that fails to address 
the religious persecution happening 
right now in China and across the 
globe. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this rule, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for 
my friend from Pennsylvania, but I 
want to provide a little bit of a history 
lesson on the Uyghur Forced Labor 
Prevention Act. 
We actually passed that bill a year 
ago in the last Congress, and the Re-
publican Senate and President Trump 
killed it. I didn’t hear a peep out of any 
of my Republican colleagues urging 
that the Senate take the bill up then. 
Last week, the House passed by an 
overwhelming vote—only one Repub-
lican voted ‘‘no’’—my bill on the 
Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. 
By the way, it is a stronger bill than 
the one that was passed in the Senate. 
Senator RUBIO and I have come to an 
agreement 
on 
reconciling 
the 
dif-
ferences. That bill will be voted on, 
perhaps even as early as today, and be 
sent over to the Senate, where I think 
they will take quick action on it and 
send it to the President’s desk for sig-
nature. 
That is real. That is the strongest 
bill to deal with the horrific treatment 
by the Chinese Government of the 
Uyghurs that has ever gone to any 
President’s desk. I am proud of the bi-
partisan support for the bill in the 
House and the Senate. Let’s not politi-
cize an issue that I think we have come 
together on. My hope is it will be done 
today. 
The bill that is before us is very simi-
lar to the bill that was passed in a pre-
vious Congress to create a post to deal 
with anti-Semitism in this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I would urge my Repub-
lican friends, who I hope share our 
view, that anti-Semitism is intolerable 
wherever it may exist, and we need to 
do more to combat it. Please call your 
friends in the Republican Senate to 
stop 
holding 
up 
President 
Biden’s 
nominee for special envoy. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a CNN story, ‘‘Senate Democrats Say 
Republicans Are Holding Up Nomina-
tion For Anti-Semitism Post.’’ 
[From CNN, Dec. 8, 2021] 
SENATE DEMOCRATS SAY REPUBLICANS ARE 
HOLDING UP NOMINATION
FOR ANTI-SEMI-
TISM POST 
(By Jessica Dean) 
(CNN) Democrats in Congress told CNN 
that GOP senators are continuing to hold up 
the nomination of the woman President Joe 
Biden tapped to become the next US Envoy 
to Combat and Monitor Antisemitism, five 
months after she was nominated. 
Biden nominated Deborah Lipstadt, an 
Emory professor of Modern Jewish History 
and Holocaust Studies, on July 30. Lipstadt 
has thus far not even been offered a hearing 
by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
Lipstadt has previously worked with both 
Democratic and Republican administrations 
and enjoys strong support from a wide range 
of Jewish groups. 
‘‘Our Republican colleagues have refused 
to give her a hearing before the Senate For-
eign 
Relations 
committee,’’ 
Committee 
Chairman Bob Menendez, a Democrat from 
New Jersey, told CNN. Typically both Demo-
cratic and Republican members of the com-
mittee agree to have a hearing for a nomi-
nee. 
Menendez said they’re approaching a time 
when he may go against tradition to bypass 
the 
committee 
and 
move 
to 
discharge 
Lipstadt’s nomination straight to the Senate 
floor where Democrats hold the majority. 
Republicans denied that they were stalling 
the confirmation process. 
‘‘I wouldn’t say we’re holding it up,’’ said 
Republican Sen. Jim Risch, the ranking 
member of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, adding they are waiting on addi-
tional materials from Lipstadt. An aide said 
they had spoken with Lipstadt on Tuesday. 
When asked if he thinks they will ulti-
mately give Lipstadt a hearing, Risch re-
plied, ‘‘I think so’’ but offered no timeline. 
What’s the hold up? 
Risch said there has been some concern 
from 
members 
over 
Lipstadt’s 
previous 
tweets. 
In one tweet from March 14, Lipstadt re-
acted to comments from Republican Sen. 
Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who sits on the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, writ-
ing, ‘‘This is white supremacy/nationalism. 
Pure and simple.’’ 
Lipstadt was referring to Johnson’s com-
ments that he might have been concerned for 
his well-being during the January 6 attack 
had the protestors been affiliated with Black 
Lives Matter instead of being a largely 
white, pro-Trump crowd. 
When asked about Lipstadt’s nomination 
and the tweet, Johnson said, ‘‘I feel like we 
have so many nominations floating around 
right now, I really can’t comment at this 
point.’’ 
Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, 
who is also a member of the committee, said 
he was not familiar with Lipstadt’s nomina-
tion. 
‘‘I am not sure I have reviewed that nomi-
nation yet. To be frank, it doesn’t ring a 
bell,’’ Rubio told CNN. 
‘‘I want to make sure that whoever is there 
is someone we can count on to be heard 
around the world and whatever they have 
said in the past won’t undermine their abil-
ity to do their job,’’ Rubio said. ‘‘But I just 
don’t want to comment on a nomination 
that I haven’t fully reviewed yet.’’ 
Menendez said there was nothing in her 
background that should be a problem. 
‘‘If calling out anti-Semitism in the past is 
somehow an obstacle to this nomination, and 
that would be an amazing set of cir-
cumstances, because that’s what we want 
this person to do,’’ he said. 
Strong support from the Jewish commu-
nity 
In a rare joint statement, the Anti-Defa-
mation League, the Jewish Federations of 
North America, and the Union of Orthodox 
Jewish Congregations of America sent a let-
ter to Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
on November 4 urging its members to act. 
‘‘There is no question that Prof. Lipstadt 
has the credentials to deserve a proper hear-
ing before the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions—and that hearing is now overdue,’’ the 
letter read. 
The unified support of Jewish groups is im-
portant to note. 
‘‘To find this level of agreement about 
someone on such a contentious issue as anti- 
Semitism is rare,’’ Yair Rosenberg, a writer 
who covers anti-Semitism for The Atlantic, 
told CNN in an interview. 
‘‘And it’s very rare to see that and it’s rare 
to see people then say, ’Well, we don’t care 
what all these Jewish groups think,’’’ Rosen-
berg said. 
In an attempt to move the nomination 
along, a number of House Democrats who sit 
on the House Bipartisan Task Force for Com-
bating Anti-Semitism—led by Reps. Kathy 
Manning of North Carolina and Ted Deutch 
of Florida—wrote a letter to Menendez and 
Risch pressing them for a hearing for 
Lipstadt. 
‘‘In recent months, we have witnessed 
growing threats against Jewish communities 
in our own country and worldwide,’’ the 
group wrote. ‘‘We believe it is vital to have 
a Special Envoy in place to confront these

threats and ensure that the United States 
continues to lead the world in the fight 
against antisemitism.’’ 
Rosenberg told CNN the stalled nomina-
tion is ‘‘a much broader effort to stall 
Biden’s nominees and prevent their con-
firmations.’’ 
‘‘It’s typical partisan warfare, but this 
time, it’s not a victimless crime, right? 
There’s the nominees themselves, and then 
in this case, there’s Jewish communities 
abroad that are protected by the anti-
Semitism envoy position. And right now 
that office is short-stringed because the Re-
publicans will not move forward on this con-
firmation.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of today’s bill to help 
monitor and combat Islamophobia. 
Targeting someone because of their 
religion is discriminatory and it is dan-
gerous. Yet, across the world anti-Mus-
lim prejudice is spreading. As a result, 
innocent people are being attacked, 
their mosques vandalized, and their 
rights curtailed. All of this is the delib-
erate 
result 
of 
anti-Muslim 
fearmongering, often from the highest 
levels of government. 
The violence and repression would 
not be possible without the propaganda 
that paints all Muslims as dangerous. 
We have seen that even in our own 
country, where a lie that Muslims are 
dangerous was used to justify a Muslim 
ban. This hate speech continues to 
echo in the halls of Congress today, 
even against our own Members of Con-
gress. This must stop. 
The more these hateful lies spread, 
the more people will follow the words 
of their leaders and take action, lead-
ing to more violence like the shootings 
in Christchurch and around the world. 
With this bill we can help stop the 
spread of this Islamophobia and stop 
the violence these words cause. Let’s 
ensure that everybody, regardless of 
race or religion, can feel safe in this 
country and around the world for being 
who they are. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I am glad it was 
brought up, the so-called Trump Mus-
lim ban, because it gives me a chance 
to set the record straight. 
Let’s be clear, the seven countries 
that my colleague was referring to— 
the seven countries specifically tar-
geted with travel restrictions in Execu-
tive Order 13769, they were actually 
countries that were determined by 
Congress in the Obama administration 
to be countries of particular concern 
for terrorism activity pursuant to the 
Visa Waiver Improvement and Ter-
rorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015. 
In fact, the policies in the adminis-
tration’s travel restrictions apply to 
just 8 percent of the world’s Muslim 
population, and according to Pew Re-
search Center, only cover one of the 
top 10 countries in the world with the 
largest Muslim population, that coun-
try being Iran. 
The courts even found that Trump’s 
travel ban was ‘‘facially neutral toward 
religion.’’ The court also ruled that 
Trump ‘‘set forth a sufficient national 
security justification.’’ So I thank my 
colleague for giving me the chance to 
put in the RECORD the truth about the 
so-called Trump ban. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s talk about some-
thing that the American people are fo-
cused on right now. Thanks to the 
Biden energy crisis, Americans are 
paying 56 percent more for a gallon of 
gas. 
In Pennsylvania, families are facing 
a 50 percent increase in their energy 
bills. Biden’s war on fossil fuels con-
tinues to devastate the Nation this hol-
iday season. 
That is why, Mr. Speaker, if we de-
feat the previous question, I will per-
sonally offer an amendment to the rule 
to immediately consider H.R. 6235, the 
Strategic Production Response Act. 
This legislation would require the 
Secretary of Energy to develop a plan 
to increase oil and gas production on 
Federal lands if the President uses the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve for non- 
emergency reasons. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment into the RECORD, along with any 
extraneous material immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. UPTON), one of the 
authors of the legislation, to explain 
the amendment. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I do rise in 
opposition to both the rule and the pre-
vious question so the House can con-
sider H.R. 6235, the Strategic Produc-
tion Response Act, introduced by the 
top Republican on the Energy and 
Commerce 
Committee, 
Mrs. 
CATHY 
MCMORRIS RODGERS of Washington, in 
the recent weeks. 
This President and the Democrats 
are waging a war on fossil fuels and af-
fordable American energy, and Amer-
ican families are paying the price in 
the form of skyrocketing energy bills 
and inflation that is surging, frankly, 
out of control. We see that constant in-
crease at the pump literally every time 
we get in the car and pass a gas station 
in virtually every State in the Union. 
Before this President came into of-
fice, the U.S. was more energy secure 
than ever before. Energy prices were 
low, stable, and manufacturing was 
coming back to the U.S. after decades 
of offshoring. 
Today, America’s energy security is 
under siege by President Biden and the 
Democrats. In fact, in the span of a 
year the price of crude oil and many 
energy commodities has risen to a 7- 
year high. Gasoline prices have nearly 
doubled, while more Americans are 
struggling certainly to make ends 
meet. 
Forecasts—even before this winter’s 
heating costs season started, American 
families were expected to pay some 54 
percent more for propane, 43 percent 
more for heating oil, 30 percent more 
for natural gas, and 6 percent more for 
electric heating. 
Even as millions of Americans de-
pend on reliable and affordable supplies 
of fossil-based fuels for home heating, 
electricity, transportation, manufac-
turing, 
and 
agriculture, 
Democrats 
have doubled down their anti-American 
energy agenda. 
It was a mistake when President 
Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipe-
line, which would have transported al-
most 1 million barrels a day of stable 
energy supplies to the U.S. 
President Biden issued a moratorium 
on energy development on Federal 
lands. Now the administration is even 
considering killing Line 5, another im-
portant pipeline that provides critical 
heating fuels and gas to the Midwest. 
Yes, faced with skyrocketing energy 
prices and low poll numbers, this Presi-
dent has begged OPEC—of all places— 
OPEC and Russia—to pump more oil. 
When OPEC and Russia refused to in-
crease supplies, guess what, President 
Biden then turned to China and re-
sorted to tapping America’s Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve, rather than en-
courage drilling here domestically. 
This President turned to China for 
oil. China is persecuting more than a 
million Uyghurs, Muslims, and other 
ethnic minorities. They certainly don’t 
share our values. America’s Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve is one of the Na-
tion’s most valuable energy security 
tools, and this President and the 
Democrats are squandering it, using it 
for a political coverup for their anti- 
fossil fuel agenda. 
If allowed, this motion is pretty sim-
ple. It would protect the Strategic Pe-
troleum Reserve and lower gas prices 
by unleashing American energy pro-
duction. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield the gentleman from Michi-
gan an additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. UPTON. The Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve was created by Congress 
to respond to several oil supply disrup-
tions, not as a bailout. This adminis-
tration has to end its hostility to pro-
ducing energy right here under our feet 
and reverse the policies that have con-
tributed to the energy crisis facing 
Americans today. 
If this administration is serious 
about lowering gas prices it has to stop 
encouraging other countries, and rath-
er encourage ours to produce gas and 
oil rather than relying on OPEC, Rus-
sia, and China. 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question so we can consider this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7657 
December 14, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
when the heinous acts of 9/11 came, this 
Nation could have easily fell upon the 
splinters of divisiveness and begin to 
point fingers in a massive way toward 
our fellow human beings, Muslims 
around the world and in the United 
States. 
Isn’t it interesting that the President 
of the United States, a Republican, 
George W. Bush, took to the micro-
phone to denounce that kind of divisive 
action—a Republican. 
We came together, even though there 
were incidences that many confronted, 
to hold this Nation together. Even with 
the small percentage of Muslims in the 
United States, we recognize the 1.8 bil-
lion Muslims in the world, which 
makes up nearly one-forth of the 
world’s population. It is the world’s 
second largest religion. 
I am proud to be able to serve or have 
served with former Member Keith Elli-
son, the first to be elected; Congress-
man ANDRE´
CARSON, RASHIDA TLAIB, 
and ILHAN OMAR. I am proud to chair 
the Pakistan Caucus, the Afghan Cau-
cus, and to work with Muslims around 
the world; and I have visited the Mid-
dle East often, and engaged with Mus-
lims who desired peace. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support 
the rule and the underlying bill, to cre-
ate the position of special envoy for 
monitoring 
and 
combatting 
Islamophobia that would be responsible 
for tracking and coordinating efforts to 
combat Islamophobia abroad. It would 
require the State Department to en-
courage reports on human rights prac-
tices and an annual report on inter-
national religious freedom, and in-
clude, where possible, the assessments 
on 
the 
nature 
and 
extent 
of 
Islamophobia and Islamophobic incite-
ment that occur abroad. 
b 1330 
My colleagues on this floor might 
take heed to the importance of recog-
nizing the humanity of all people. The 
hijab is a thing of beauty. Muslim 
women can choose to wear it, they 
wear it in front of men who are not 
their family members. Our Member, 
ILHAN OMAR, wears that. It is not a 
sign of terrorism, and that kind of lan-
guage should be denounced whether it 
is on the floor of this House or in some 
kind of private interaction. 
We do not want the world to look at 
the United States as not caring about 
the rights of Muslims. America stands 
against the committing of acts of 
atrocities 
against 
the 
Uyghurs 
in 
China, or the Rohingya in Burma, or 
the brutal crackdowns on Muslim pop-
ulations in other countries including 
Southeast Asia, scapegoating of Mus-
lim refugees and other Muslims in Hun-
gary and Poland, the acts of white su-
premacist violence against Muslims in 
New Zealand and Canada, or the tar-
geting of minority Muslim commu-
nities in Muslim majority countries 
like those in Southeast Asia and Iran. 
I know that we are working hard to en-
sure that does not happen. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman from Texas an addi-
tional 1 minute. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. This legislation 
is crucial and important. The reason is 
because it speaks to who we are as 
Members of the most powerful law-
making body in the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to sit on the 
Tom Lantos Human Rights Commis-
sion with Chairman MCGOVERN
and 
that we can talk about human rights 
for all people. And we need to get over 
it and recognize that it is important to 
unify the world. Let the United States 
be the leader for what is right and to 
be able to acknowledge the doctors, 
lawyers, and other leaders in our Na-
tion who happen to be Muslim. 
So this legislation gives the United 
States the right hand, the upper hand 
to be able to assess this around the 
world and be the leader against anti- 
hate or anti-Muslim hate. Let’s be the 
leader rather than the provoker of it. 
I end by saying this plea to my col-
leagues: Whether you are Republican 
or Democrat, is this, in essence, the 
reputation you want to give to this 
Congress, that we are attacking people 
for their religion and who they are? 
Let this bill pass but let it be a sym-
bol that we will stop this kind of 
Islamophobia, and it starts with each 
and every one of us. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
vote for the rule and the underlying 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Rule 
Governing Debate of H.R. 5665, the Com-
bating International Islamophobia Act, which 
will address the increasing number of inci-
dents of Islamophobia around the world. 
Specifically, this bill will: 
Create the position of Special Envoy for 
Monitoring and Combating Islamophobia, who 
will be responsible for tracking and coordi-
nating efforts to combat Islamophobia abroad. 
Require that the State Department’s annual 
country reports on human rights practices and 
annual Report on International Religious Free-
dom include, wherever possible, assessments 
of 
the 
nature 
and 
extent 
of 
acts 
of 
Islamophobia and Islamophobic incitement 
that occur abroad. 
As Islamophobia rises globally, it is vital that 
the State Department have senior personnel in 
place charged with understanding, reporting 
on, and combating this scourge worldwide. 
In recent decades, we have seen a stag-
gering rise in incidents of violent Islamophobia 
worldwide. 
Whether it is the atrocities being committed 
against the Uyghurs in China and the 
Rohingya in Burma, the brutal crackdowns on 
Muslim populations around the world. The 
scapegoating of Muslim refugees and other 
Muslims in Hungary and Poland, the acts of 
white supremacist violence targeting Muslims 
in New Zealand and Canada, or the targeting 
of minority Muslim communities in Muslim-ma-
jority countries. It is time for us as policy-
makers to understand these problems as inter-
connected and genuinely global. 
There are about 1.8 billion Muslims in the 
world, which makes up nearly one-fourth of 
the world’s population. Islam is the world’s 
second largest religion. Painfully, a staggering 
number of people have experienced anti-Mus-
lim hate in their lifetime; a number that has 
only inflated since 9/11. 
America is home to one of the most diverse 
Muslim populations in the world, including 
people of almost every ethnicity, country and 
school of thought. 
Approximately one third of the community is 
African American, one third is of South Asian 
descent, one quarter is of Arab descent, and 
the rest are from all over the world, including 
a growing Latino Muslim population. 
While exact numbers are difficult to estab-
lish, there are between 3–6 million American 
Muslims. About one half of this population was 
born in the U.S., a percentage that continues 
to grow as immigration slows and younger in-
dividuals start having families. 
American Muslims are present in all walks 
of life, as doctors and taxi drivers; lawyers and 
newspaper 
vendors; 
accountants, 
home-
makers, academics, media personalities, ath-
letes, and entertainers. 
Although American Muslims make up ap-
proximately one percent of the U.S. popu-
lation, most Americans can name several fa-
mous American Muslims. Names like Muham-
mad Ali, Malcolm X, Mos Def, Fareed Zakaria, 
Shaquille O’Neal, Lupe Fiasco, Dr. Oz and 
Rima Fakih are part of our popular conscious-
ness. 
Important business figures like Farooq 
Kathwari (CEO of Ethan Allen), Malik M. 
Hasan (a pioneer in the field of HMOs), and 
Safi Qureshey (a leader in PC component 
manufacturing) are all American Muslims. 
Many American Muslims are also civically 
engaged, working with their neighbors to bet-
ter their communities. Well-known American 
Muslim leaders include Rep. Keith Ellison 
(DFL-Minn.), the first American Muslim to be 
elected to the U.S. Congress; Rep. ANDRE´ 
CARSON (D–Ind.); Mohammed Hameeduddin 
(Mayor, Teaneck, N.J.); and Amer Ahmad 
(Comptroller, Chicago). 
Nevertheless, levels of Islamophobia are so 
high that the United Nations Human rights 
Council has declared it an issue of ‘‘epidemic 
proportions.’’ 
Atrocities have been occurring across the 
globe, from hate-messages spray-painted on 
buildings in America to the violent genocide of 
the Uyghurs in China. 
The United States State Department esti-
mated that up to 2 million members of Muslim 
minorities have experienced a system on de-
tention centers in Xinjiang, known political in-
doctrination, forced labor, torture, and sexual 
abuse. 
The US, UK, and Canada have accused 
China of committing genocide and crimes 
against humanity against Muslim populations 
at Xinjiang. 
In 2018, UN investigators accused the 
Myanmar’s military of carrying out mass 
killings of Muslim populations with ‘‘genocidal 
intent.’’ 
There are reports of attacks on mosques in 
Southeast Asia and Iran, a history of anti-Mus-
lim sentiments and attacks in Sri Lanka, police 
targeting against Shia Muslims in Southeast 
Asia again, massacres of Muslim people in 
New Zealand, and Islamophobic hate-speech 
in Canada. We have to demand justice for 
Muslims and better treatment for all religions. 
This global injustice must be addressed and 
rectified and the United States must step up to 
spearhead the movement.

December 14, 2021 
We need to establish a comprehensive plan 
for combating Islamophobia not only to ensure 
the religious freedom and human rights of 
Muslims, but to protect against a threat to 
international religious freedom and democratic 
principles. 
The Combating International Islamophobia 
Act will require the State department to create 
a Special Envoy for monitoring and combating 
Islamophobia answering the call of the Amer-
ican Muslim community for the past two dec-
ades. 
The envoy will work with domestic and inter-
national nongovernmental organizations and 
institutions to carry out its directives. 
The special envoy will give reports on acts 
of physical violence or harassment against 
Muslim people as well as acts of vandalism of 
Muslim community institutions like schools, 
mosques, and cemeteries. 
Regarding anti-Muslim government actions, 
the envoy will monitor instances of propa-
ganda in media that attempt to justify or pro-
mote racial hatred or incite acts of violence 
against Muslim people. 
With the new wealth of information this 
envoy will bring, policymakers will have a bet-
ter understanding of the interconnected, global 
problem of anti-Muslim bigotry. 
As part of our commitment to international 
religious freedom and human rights, we must 
recognize Islamophobia as a pattern that is re-
peating in nearly every corner of the globe. 
It is past time for the United States to stand 
firmly in favor of religious freedom for all, and 
to give the global problem of Islamophobia the 
attention and prioritization it deserves. 
I urge all members to join me in voting for 
the rule and the underlying legislation, H.R. 
5665, 
the 
‘‘Combating 
International 
Islamophobla Act.’’ 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, my good friend and col-
league from Texas mentioned George 
W. Bush in her remarks. That is cer-
tainly a blast from the past. I was ac-
tually too young to even vote for Presi-
dent Bush when he was running in the 
primary. So I say that respectfully for 
my good friend from Texas. 
But when we are talking about blasts 
from the past, the American people 
have not paid this much at the pump 
since the last time Biden was in the 
White House. It is true. The national 
average of gasoline is currently $3.32. 
Americans are paying 54 percent more 
nationally for a gallon of gas. In some 
parts of the United States the price for 
a gallon of gas has reached $7.59 a gal-
lon. 
So with Biden in the White House we 
are repeating ourselves once again—a 
blast from the past—and the American 
people are, unfortunately, paying every 
day at the gas pump. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Oklahoma 
(Mr. 
MULLIN), my good friend, who is going 
to talk about that. 
Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, what we 
are seeing here from the Democrats is 
just a distraction. They are just trying 
to distract the American people from 
what is really happening. 
What is it the American people are 
upset about? 
What is it that they are concerned 
about? 
How about what they are paying. We 
can talk about the groceries, and we 
can talk about what they are paying at 
the gas pump, so let’s talk about that 
real quick. 
If we are really serious about doing 
something that is important to the 
American people, then let’s start with 
H.R. 6235 to address the high energy 
prices our country is seeing right now. 
Gas prices are at a 7-year high. On No-
vember 23, the Biden administration 
announced the Department of Justice 
will sell 50 million barrels out of the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an at-
tempt to bring down gas prices. 
What a joke. We consume roughly 20 
billion barrels a day in the United 
States, and to say we are going to re-
lease 50 billion out of the Strategic Pe-
troleum Reserve to bring down gas 
prices? 
That is nothing but another game, 
like this bill that we are talking about 
today debating. It is nothing but 
smoke and mirrors just trying to dis-
tract the American people to say: Hey, 
look, we are fighting; we are trying to 
do something. 
H.R. 6235 would require the Secretary 
of Energy to develop a plan to increase 
oil and gas production on Federal lands 
in conjunction with drawing down the 
oil from the Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve. 
If any President attempts to tap into 
the SPR for political reasons, the Stra-
tegic Production Response Act would 
require a plan to increase U.S. energy 
production at the same time. The SPR 
was established by Congress to respond 
to an emergency, not to manipulate 
gasoline prices. 
The administration’s anti-fossil fuel 
agenda is contributing to the record- 
high energy prices which is driving up 
inflation and household bills. It is pro-
jected to cost some families up to 54 
percent more to heat their homes this 
winter. If President Biden and the 
Democrats want to be serious about 
bringing down costs to the families, 
they would stop the attack on Amer-
ican petroleum. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
defeat the previous question and take 
up this bill. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we are considering the 
Combating International Islamophobia 
Act right now, and my good friend 
from Pennsylvania in the very begin-
ning made reference to the fact that 
Republicans are all united in con-
demning hate, prejudice, and bigotry 
wherever it exists. But I just want to 
point out why this bill is so important. 
It is because the last Republican Presi-
dent who we had, unfortunately, it was 
like gasoline on a fire in terms of pro-
moting Islamophobia. 
In 2015, Donald Trump said that he 
would look at closing mosques in the 
United States. That same year he was 
open to the idea of creating a database 
of all U.S. Muslims. As President, he 
instituted a Muslim ban. So that is the 
Republican Party’s recent history in 
terms of combating Islamophobia. In-
stead of combating it, he, again, threw 
gasoline on the fire and fanned the 
flames. 
So the reason why this is important 
is so that we can show the world that 
that is not who we are and that we re-
ject bigotry, hatred, discrimination, 
and prejudice wherever it exists. The 
statistics are clear: we see a rising tide 
of Islamophobia all throughout the 
world. 
This should not be controversial. 
This, quite frankly, should be a suspen-
sion. That it has been politicized by 
some of my friends on the other side of 
the aisle is unfortunate, but I hope 
that some of them will at the end join 
with us in voting to pass it. 
I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), who is my 
good friend and fellow Rules Com-
mittee member. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, we will immediately 
consider the Strategic Production Re-
sponse Act which will require the Sec-
retary of Energy to develop a plan to 
increase energy production on Federal 
lands if oil in the Strategic Petroleum 
Reserve is used without a severe en-
ergy supply interruption. In November, 
the Biden administration announced 
the release of 50 million barrels of oil 
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
to manipulate the market and address 
high energy prices that were created by 
his policies. 
On his first day in office, President 
Biden 
weakened 
America’s 
energy 
independence by rejoining the Paris 
climate agreement, blocking new en-
ergy development on Federal lands, 
and killing the Keystone pipeline. 
These are just a few examples of how 
this President’s policies have slowed 
our Nation’s economic recovery and 
will prevent us from reclaiming true 
energy independence. 
Releasing oil from the Strategic Pe-
troleum Reserve without an emergency 
declaration is unprecedented. No se-
vere supply disruption exists, only a 
President who seeks to enact radical 
Green New Deal policies. Low Presi-
dential approval ratings are not the 
emergency that Congress envisioned 
when the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
was established in 1975. 
The path to affordable energy is sim-
ple: increase supply to meet demand. 
Congress must reverse the policies that 
limit production of energy here at 
home. Clean energy is a priority for all 
Americans, but hurting domestic pro-
ducers will only increase our Nation’s 
dependence on dirty energy products 
from Russia, China, and the Middle 
East which are inherently less clean 
than American energy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7659 
December 14, 2021 
In conclusion, the Strategic Produc-
tion Response Act ensures that a plan 
is in place to increase energy produc-
tion before any President may use the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve for purely 
political purposes. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question so 
we can consider this amendment. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a September 7 Associated Press article 
titled ‘‘Two Decades After 9/11, Muslim 
Americans Still Fighting Bias.’’ 
[From AP, Sept. 7, 2021] 
TWO DECADES AFTER 9/11, MUSLIM AMERICANS 
STILL FIGHTING BIAS 
NEW YORK (AP)—A car passed, the driver’s 
window rolled down and the man spat an epi-
thet at two little girls wearing their hijabs: 
‘‘Terrorist!’’ 
It was 2001, mere weeks after the twin tow-
ers at the World Trade Center fell, and 10- 
year-old Shahana Hanif and her younger sis-
ter were walking to the local mosque from 
their Brooklyn home. 
Unsure, afraid, the girls ran. 
As the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 ter-
ror attacks approaches, Hanif can still recall 
the shock of the moment, her confusion over 
how anyone could look at her, a child, and 
see a threat. 
‘‘It’s not a nice, kind word. It means vio-
lence, it means dangerous. It is meant to 
shock whoever . . . is on the receiving end of 
it,’’ she says. 
But the incident also spurred a determina-
tion to speak out for herself and others that 
has helped get her to where she is today: a 
community organizer strongly favored to 
win a seat on the New York City Council in 
the upcoming municipal election. 
Like Hanif, other young American Mus-
lims have grown up under the shadow of 9/11. 
Many have faced hostility and surveillance, 
mistrust and suspicion, questions about 
their Muslim faith and doubts over their 
Americanness. 
They’ve also found ways forward, ways to 
fight back against bias, to organize, to craft 
nuanced personal narratives about their 
identities. In the process, they’ve built 
bridges, challenged stereotypes and carved 
out new spaces for themselves. 
There is ‘‘this sense of being Muslim as a 
kind of important identity marker, regard-
less of your relationship with Islam as a 
faith,’’ says Eman Abdelhadi, a sociologist at 
The University of Chicago who studies Mus-
lim communities. ‘‘That’s been one of the 
main effects in people’s lives . . . it has 
shaped the ways the community has devel-
oped.’’ 
A poll by The Associated Press-NORC Cen-
ter for Public Affairs Research conducted 
ahead of the 9/11 anniversary found that 53% 
of Americans have unfavorable views toward 
Islam, compared with 42% who have favor-
able ones. This stands in contrast to Ameri-
cans’ opinions about Christianity and Juda-
ism, for which most respondents expressed 
favorable views. 
Mistrust and suspicion of Muslims didn’t 
start with 9/11, but the attacks dramatically 
intensified those animosities. 
Accustomed to being ignored or targeted 
by low-level harassment, the country’s wide- 
ranging and diverse Muslim communities 
were foisted into the spotlight, says Youssef 
Chouhoud, a political scientist at Chris-
topher Newport University in Virginia. 
‘‘Your sense of who you were was becoming 
more formed, not just Muslim but American 
Muslim,’’ he says. ‘‘What distinguished you 
as an American Muslim? Could you be fully 
both, or did you have to choose? There was a 
lot of grappling with what that meant.’’ 
In Hanif’s case, there was no blueprint to 
navigate the complexities of that time. 
‘‘Fifth-grader me wasn’t naı¨ve or too 
young to know Muslims are in danger,’’ she 
later wrote in an essay about the aftermath 
of 9/11. ‘‘. . . Flashing an American flag from 
our first-floor windows didn’t make me more 
American. Born in Brooklyn didn’t make me 
more American.’’ 
A young Hanif gathered neighborhood 
friends, and an older cousin helped them 
write a letter to then-President George W. 
Bush asking for protection. 
‘‘We knew,’’ she says, ‘‘that we would be-
come like warriors of this community.’’ 
But being warriors often carries a price, 
with wounds that linger. 
Ishaq Pathan, 26, recalls the time a boy 
told him he seemed angry and wondered if he 
was going to blow up their Connecticut 
school. 
He remembers the helplessness he felt 
when he was taken aside at an airport for ad-
ditional questioning upon returning to the 
United States after a college semester in Mo-
rocco. 
The agent looked through his belongings, 
including the laptop where he kept a private 
journal, and started reading it. 
‘‘I remember being like, ‘Hey, do you have 
to read that?’’’ Pathan says. The agent ‘‘just 
looks at me like, ‘You know, I can read any-
thing on your computer. I’m entitled to any-
thing here.’ And at that point, I remember 
having tears in my eyes. I was completely 
and utterly powerless.’’ 
Pathan couldn’t accept it. 
‘‘You go to school with other people of dif-
ferent backgrounds and you realize . . . what 
the promise of the United States is,’’ he 
says. ‘‘And when you see it not living up to 
that promise, then I think it instills in us a 
sense of wanting to help and fix that.’’ 
He now works as the San Francisco Bay 
Area director for the nonprofit Islamic Net-
works Group, where he hopes to help a 
younger generation grow confident in their 
Muslim identity. 
Pathan recently chatted with a group of 
boys about their summer activities. At 
times, the boys ate watermelon or played on 
a trampoline. At other moments, the talk 
turned serious: What would they do if a stu-
dent pretended to blow himself up while 
yelling ‘‘Allahu akbar,’’ or ‘‘God is great?’’ 
What can they do about stereotypical depic-
tions of Muslims on TV? 
‘‘I had always viewed 9/11 as probably one 
of the most pivotal moments of my life and 
of the lives of Americans across the board,’’ 
Pathan says. ‘‘The aftermath of it . . . is 
what pushed me to do what I do today.’’ 
That aftermath has also helped motivate 
Shukri Olow to do what she is doing—run for 
office. 
Born in Somalia, Olow fled civil war with 
her family and lived in refugee camps in 
Kenya for years before coming to the United 
States when she was 10. 
She found home in a vibrant public hous-
ing complex in the city of Kent, south of Se-
attle. There, residents from different coun-
tries communicated across language and cul-
tural barriers, borrowing salt from each 
other or watching one another’s kids. Olow 
felt she flourished in that environment. 
Then 9/11 happened. She recalls feeling con-
fused when a teacher asked her, ‘‘What are 
your people doing?’’ But she also remembers 
others who ‘‘said that this isn’t our fault . . . 
and we need to make sure that you’re safe.’’ 
In a 2017 Pew Research Center survey of 
U.S. Muslims, nearly half of respondents said 
they experienced at least one instance of re-
ligious discrimination within the year be-
fore; yet 49% said someone expressed support 
for them because of their religion in the pre-
vious year. 
Overwhelmingly, the study found respond-
ents proud to be both Muslim and American. 
For some, including Olow, there were occa-
sional identity crises growing up. 
‘‘ ‘Who am I?’—which I think is what many 
young people kind of go through in life in 
general,’’ she says. ‘‘But for those of us who 
live at the intersection of anti-Blackness and 
Islamophobia . . . it was really hard.’’ 
But her experiences from that time also 
helped form her identity. She is now seeking 
a seat on the King County Council. 
‘‘There are many young people who have 
multiple identities who have felt that they 
don’t belong here, that they are not wel-
comed here,’’ she says. ‘‘I was one of those 
young people. And so, I try to do what I can 
to make sure that more of us know that this 
is our nation, too.’’ 
After 9/11, some American Muslims chose 
to dispel misconceptions about their faith by 
building personal connections. They shared 
coffee or broke bread with strangers as they 
fielded myriad questions—from how Islam 
views women and Jesus to how to combat ex-
tremism. 
Mansoor Shams has traveled across the 
U.S. with a sign that reads: ‘‘I’m Muslim and 
a U.S. Marine, ask anything.’’ It’s part of the 
39-year-old’s efforts to teach others about his 
faith and counter hate through dialogue. 
Shams, who served in the Marines from 
2000 
to 
2004, 
was 
called 
names 
like 
‘‘Taliban,’’ 
‘‘terrorist’’ 
and 
‘‘Osama 
bin 
Laden’’ by some of his fellow Marines after 9/ 
11. 
One of his most memorable interactions, 
he says, was at Liberty University in Vir-
ginia, where he spoke in 2019 to students of 
the Christian institution. Some, he says, 
still call him with questions about Islam. 
‘‘There’s this mutual love and respect,’’ he 
says. 
Shams wishes his current work wasn’t 
needed but feels a responsibility to share a 
counternarrative he says many Americans 
don’t know. 
Ahmed Ali Akbar, 33, came to a different 
conclusion. 
Shortly after 9/11, some adults in his com-
munity arranged for an assembly at his 
school in Saginaw, Michigan, where he and 
other students talked about Islam and Mus-
lims. Akbar poured his heart into the re-
search. But he recalls his confusion at some 
of the questions: Where is bin Laden? What’s 
the reason behind the attacks? 
‘‘How am I supposed to know where Osama 
bin Laden is? I’m an American kid,’’ he says. 
That period left him feeling like trying to 
change people’s minds wasn’t always effec-
tive, that some were not ready to listen. 
Akbar eventually turned his focus toward 
telling stories about Muslim Americans on 
his podcast ‘‘See Something Say Some-
thing.’’ 
‘‘There’s a lot of humor in the Muslim 
American experience as well,’’ he says. ‘‘It’s 
not all just sadness and reaction to the vio-
lence and . . . racism and Islamophobia.’’ 
He has also come to believe in building 
connections of a different type. ‘‘Our battle 
for our civil liberties (is) tied up with other 
marginalized communities,’’ he says, stress-
ing the importance of advocating for them. 
For some, 9/11 brought a different kind of 
racial reckoning, says Debbie Almontaser, a 
Yemeni American educator and activist in 
New York. 
She says many Arab and South Asian im-
migrants came to the U.S. seeking the Amer-
ican Dream as doctors, lawyers, entre-
preneurs. ‘‘Then 9/11 happens and they real-
ize that they’re brown and they realize that 
they’re minorities—that was a huge wake-up 
call,’’ Almontaser says.

Some racial tensions play out today in 
U.S. Muslim communities. The racial justice 
protests sparked by the killing of George 
Floyd, for instance, brought many Muslims 
to the streets to condemn racism. But they 
also spurred an internal reckoning about ra-
cial equity among Muslims, including the 
treatment of Black Muslims. 
‘‘For me, as a Muslim African American, 
my struggle (in America) is still with race 
and identity,’’ says imam Ali Aqeel of the 
Muslim American Cultural Center in Nash-
ville, Tennessee. 
‘‘When we go to (Islamic) centers and we 
have to deal with the same pain that we deal 
with out in the world, it’s kind of discour-
aging to us because we’re under the impres-
sion that (in) Islam, you don’t have that ra-
cial and ethnic divide.’’ 
Amirah Ahmed, 17, was born after the at-
tacks and feels like she was thrust into a 
struggle not of her making—a burden despite 
being ‘‘just as American as anyone else.’’ 
She recalls how a few years ago at her Vir-
ginia school’s 9/11 commemoration, she felt 
students’ stares at her and her hijab so in-
tensely that she wanted to skip the next 
year’s event. 
When her mother dismissed the idea, she 
instead wore her Americanness as a shield, 
donning an American flag headscarf to ad-
dress her classmates from a podium. 
Ahmed spoke about honoring the lives of 
those who died in America on 9/11—but also 
of Iraqis who died in the war launched in 
2003. She recalls defending her Arab and Mus-
lim identities that day while displaying her 
American one and says it was a ‘‘really pow-
erful moment.’’ 
But she hopes her future children don’t feel 
the need to prove they belong. 
‘‘Our kids are going to be (here) well after 
the 9/11 era,’’ she says. ‘‘They should not 
have to continue fighting for their identity.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, a re-
cent poll, as I mentioned earlier, found 
that 53 percent of Americans, unfortu-
nately, hold negative views of Mus-
lims—53 percent. Islamophobia isn’t 
just a problem abroad. We need to com-
bat it here at home as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a December 9 report released by the 
Department of Justice titled ‘‘2020 
Hate Crimes Statistics.’’ 
2020 HATE CRIMES STATISTICS 
In August 2021, the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation (FBI) released Hate Crime Sta-
tistics 2020, an annual compilation of bias- 
motivated incidents in the United States. 
Though the number of reporting agencies de-
creased by 452 since 2019, the overall number 
of reported incidents increased by 949, con-
tributing to a total of 8,263 hate crime inci-
dents against 11,126 victims in 2020. While an-
nual law enforcement agency participation 
may fluctuate, the statistics indicate that 
hate crimes remain a concern for commu-
nities across the country. 
According to this year’s data, 62% of vic-
tims were targeted because of the offenders’ 
bias toward race/ethnicity/ancestry, which 
continues to be the largest bias motivation 
category. Participating agencies reported 
5,227 race/ethnicity/ancestry-based incidents 
in 2020, a 32% increase from 2019. Anti-Black 
or African American hate crimes continue to 
be the largest bias incident victim category, 
with 2,871 incidents in 2020, a 49% increase 
since 2019. Additionally, there were 279 anti- 
Asian incidents reported in 2020, a 77% in-
crease since 2019. The other largest cat-
egories of hate crimes include anti-Hispanic 
or Latino incidents, with 517, and anti-White 
incidents, with 869 in total. 
Incidents related to religion decreased 18% 
from 2019, with 1,244 total incidents reported. 
The largest category included: 
683 anti-Jewish incidents, down 28% since 
2019; 
110 anti-Muslim incidents, down 38%; 
15 anti-Buddhist incidents, up 200%; and 
89 anti-Sikh incidents, up 83%. 
Incidents related to disability decreased 
17% from 2019, with 130 total incidents re-
ported. By category: 
Anti-mental disability incidents decreased 
by 29% since 2019, and 
Anti-physical 
disability 
incidents 
in-
creased by 8%. 
Incidents related to gender and gender 
identity increased since 2019 with increases 
in gender-related incidents by 9% and gender 
identity-related incidents by 34%. There 
were: 
50 anti-female incidents, a decrease of 4% 
since 2019; 
25 anti-male incidents, an increase of 47%; 
213 anti-transgender incidents, an increase 
of 41%; and 
53 anti-gender non-conforming incidents, 
an increase of 13%. 
See the Hate Crimes website for more high-
lights from the data: https://www.justice.gov/ 
hatecrimes/hate-crime-statistics. 
The 
full 
data set can be found on the FBI’s Crime 
Data Explorer website at https://crime-data- 
explorer.app.cloud.gov/pages/explorer/crime/ 
hate-crime. 
The FBI Hate Crime Statistics is an an-
nual compilation of bias-motivated incidents 
in the United States. For the purpose of the 
report, a hate crime is defined as a criminal 
offense which is motivated, in whole or in 
part, by the offender’s bias(es) against a per-
son based on race, ethnicity, ancestry, reli-
gion, sexual orientation, disability, gender, 
and gender identity. The 2020 data provides 
information 
voluntarily 
submitted 
from 
15,136 of 18,623 law enforcement agencies 
around the country on offenses, victims, of-
fenders, and locations of hate crimes. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, ac-
cording to FBI statistics, in 2020 there 
were 110 anti-Muslim incidents, and 
there were an additional 89 hate crimes 
against Sikhs who are often wrongly 
identified as Muslim. 
We know that hate crimes often go 
under-reported, so the actual number is 
likely much higher, which is another 
reason I think passing this bill is im-
portant. 
I include in the RECORD a September 
10 
Business 
Insider 
article 
titled 
‘‘House 
Republicans 
Mocked 
Ilhan 
Omar’s Bill to Establish an Envoy to 
Combat Islamophobia Worldwide.’’ 
[From the Business Insider, Dec. 10, 2021] 
HOUSE
REPUBICANS
MOCKED
ILHAN
OMAR’S 
BILL TO ESTABLISH AN ENVOY TO COMBAT 
ISLAMOPHOBIA WORLDWIDE 
(Bryan Metzger) 
In the wake of Rep. Lauren Boebert’s 
Islamophobia 
comments 
suggesting 
that 
Rep. Ilhan Omar was a suicide bomber, 
House Republicans spent much of a Thursday 
hearing mocking a bill put forth by the Mus-
lim Minnesota congresswoman to combat 
Islamophobia worldwide. 
‘‘I have many Pennsylvania Dutch that 
feel that they’re not treated properly,’’ said 
Rep. Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania, sarcasti-
cally calling for their inclusion in Omar’s 
Islamophobia bill. ‘‘How about those that are 
gay, you know, the LGBTQ community? 
That should be part of this bill.’’ 
‘‘Let’s keep going, you know, there are 
people that are overweight, and there are 
skinny kids that get picked on,’’ Meuser 
added. ‘‘Why aren’t they included in this as 
well?’’ 
Rep. Omar’s bill, which she introduced in 
late October alongside Democratic Rep. Jan 
Schakowsky of Illinois, would require the 
State Department to establish a special 
envoy 
for 
monitoring 
and 
combating 
Islamophobia and is modeled after a similar 
position created in 2004 to combat anti-Semi-
tism. 
‘‘For over a decade we have seen increasing 
incidents of violent Islamophobia both in the 
US and worldwide—from the genocide of the 
Rohingya in Burma, and Uyghurs in China, 
to the attacks on Muslim refugees in Canada 
and New Zealand,’’ Rep. Schakowsky said at 
the time. 
‘‘Hate crimes against American Muslims 
saw a 17% spike in 2017, when then-President 
Trump imposed a travel ban most focused on 
majority-Muslim nations. 
The bill ultimately passed the House For-
eign Relations Committee on Friday, with 
every Democrat voting in favor and every 
Republican opposed, and is expected to head 
to a full House vote on Tuesday. Democratic 
leadership is reportedly considering a vote 
on the bill as way to respond to the Boebert 
controversy, even as progressive lawmakers 
have introduced a resolution to strip Boebert 
of her committees. 
House Republican leaders, including Mi-
nority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority 
Whip Steve Scalise, have declined to force-
fully condemn Boebert’s Islamophobia rhet-
oric or take any meaningful action against 
her. 
‘SHAMEFUL AND EMBARRASSING’ 
On Thursday evening, Republicans used 
both proposed amendments to Omar’s bill 
and comments during the hearing to mock 
both the bill and Omar herself, in addition to 
downplaying Islamophobia. 
Republican Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio, who 
accidentally posted an image from an anti- 
Semitic website in 2017, said that Omar’s bill 
would ‘‘trivialize’’ anti-Semitism, given the 
existence of another State Department post 
to combat that form of bigotry. ‘‘We should 
avoid such a dangerous false equivalency at 
all costs, as it could be used by some extrem-
ists to actually justify further anti-Semitic 
activity,’’ said Chabot. 
‘‘If you ask 20 different people what 
Islamophobia means today, especially in the 
Democratic Party, you’re going to get 20 dif-
ferent answers,’’ said the Florida Repub-
lican. ‘‘And that answer is going to be what 
they decide best fits their political narrative 
to go out there and attack you.’’ 
And Republican Rep. Ken Buck of Ohio of-
fered an amendment to specify that it ‘‘shall 
not be considered Islamophobia for an indi-
vidual to criticize a brother marrying a sis-
ter for the purpose of committing immigra-
tion fraud in the United States,’’ an appar-
ent reference to long-standing right-wing 
conspiracy theories about the congress-
woman. 
As of publication time, the amendment 
was no longer available on the House For-
eign Relations Committee website and was 
presumably withdrawn. Rep. Buck’s office 
did not respond to Insider’s request for com-
ment. 
But other amendments by Buck, including 
one mentioning female genital mutilation, 
remained online. Another amendment of-
fered by Republican Rep. Scott Perry of 
Pennsylvania sought to exclude ‘‘any action 
(to 
include 
counter-terrorism 
measures) 
taken by the Israeli Government’’ from the 
bill. 
In a statement to Insider, Omar con-
demned Republican behavior during the 
hearing. 
‘‘It is shameful and embarrassing that the 
Republican 
Party’s 
response 
to 
blatant 
Islamophobia and incitement of violence is

to double down on anti-Muslim rhetoric,’’ 
she said. ‘‘Instead of engaging in a good faith 
discussion on how to address the rise of 
Islamophobic violence, Republicans engaged 
in ad hominem attacks, belittled Muslims, 
and minimized the pain of Muslim commu-
nities around the world.’’ 
And Democrats on the committee sought 
to defend Omar’s bill. 
‘‘One reason the United States is doing a 
diplomatic boycott of the Olympics in China 
is because China’s engaging in a genocide of 
Muslims, of the Uyghurs, because of their re-
ligion,’’ said Rep. Ted Lieu of California. 
‘‘The Rohingya in Burma were slaughtered 
because they were Muslims.’’ 
He also called attention to Boebert’s 
Islamophobic remarks. 
‘‘We had a congressmember from the Re-
publican Party joke about a congressmember 
in the Democratic Party, that somehow she 
was a terrorist simply because of a religion,’’ 
Lieu said. ‘‘That’s Islamophobia.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
know what the hell is going on in some 
corners of the Republican Conference, 
but to have Republican Members mock 
this bill, as they did during a recent 
committee hearing, is disgusting. This 
is no laughing matter. In fact, it is a 
matter of life and death. 
We are talking about violence, death 
threats, bullying, desecrating mosques, 
and worse. Instances like that just 
show why we need to pass this bill. 
Again, my Republican friends, as 
they do oftentimes when we have im-
portant matters like this up, they want 
to talk about everything except what 
is on the floor. But the reason why this 
is important is because I think we 
should show the world that we speak 
with one voice; that we are against ha-
tred; that we are against bigotry; that 
we will not stand by silently in the 
face of Islamophobia; that we want to 
be an example, and we want to lead the 
rest of the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from Louisiana 
(Mr. SCALISE). 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Pennsylvania for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
underlying legislation that we are try-
ing to bring to the floor which, if we 
defeat the previous question, would ac-
tually come up to confront a major 
problem facing families. 
If you look over the last few weeks, 
Mr. Speaker, this Congress has done a 
lot of things. It has spent a lot of 
money. There was a bill just 2 weeks 
ago to raise over $4.5 trillion in taxes 
and new spending, which would fuel in-
flation even higher. 
What families across America are 
telling us is: Why doesn’t Congress 
work for those families who are strug-
gling? 
Why doesn’t Congress work to con-
front the challenges they are facing 
every single day? 
It seems as if this majority is tone- 
deaf to the real problems that are hurt-
ing families today. It is inflation, and 
it is the spending in Washington that is 
driving that inflation. And one of those 
leading indicators is the high price of 
gasoline because it is something that 
maybe multiple times a week families 
have to go fill up their car. They pay 
over $150 to do it, and they can’t afford 
it. 
So we have a bill to actually do 
something about that, something we 
haven’t seen on this floor for weeks. It 
is a bill to actually confront a crisis 
that was created by this President. Un-
fortunately, there are crises after cri-
ses that have been created by President 
Biden. 
One of those is an energy crisis self- 
created by President Biden. When he 
walked in the door prices were 40 to 60 
percent less for gasoline. When you go 
to the grocery store everything is more 
expensive, Mr. Speaker; and if you are 
shopping for Christmas, things are 
more expensive if you can even find 
those gifts that you want to put under 
the tree. 
So here we bring a bill, if we are able 
to defeat this previous question, to 
confront one of these challenges. And 
that is how this President has abused 
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be-
cause the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 
is not supposed to be a piggy bank to 
cover up for the failed policies of the 
Biden administration. Yet that is what 
they have done. 
Mr. Speaker, when you saw the Presi-
dent raid the SPR the other day, we ac-
tually had an increase in prices be-
cause people recognize this President 
isn’t serious about addressing the prob-
lem. 
This 
bill 
by 
Republican 
Leader 
MCMORRIS RODGERS of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, as well as FRED 
UPTON, myself, and others would force 
the Departments of the Interior and 
Energy to confront this crisis. 
By the way, when President Biden 
goes and begs OPEC and Russia to 
produce more oil, how about we start 
here at home where we have actually 
got a surplus? 
b 1345 
We were exporting oil to our friends 
all around the world, helping our 
friends geopolitically. And that was 
undermined when President Biden cut 
off the Keystone pipeline, cut off pro-
duction on Federal lands, but he 
greenlighted the Russian pipeline. He 
begged OPEC to produce more oil, 
which, by the way, emits more carbon 
if that is what you are concerned 
about. 
Mr. Speaker, why don’t we focus on 
those things that will help American 
jobs and help lower carbon emissions? 
That is producing more American en-
ergy, and do you know what else it 
does? It lowers the price of gasoline. I 
urge rejection of the previous question. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW), my good 
friend. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, ‘tis the season of mis-
placed priorities. In the midst of rising 
inflation, labor shortages, open bor-
ders, and foreign policy blunders, my 
colleagues 
seem 
to 
think 
that 
Islamophobia is what Americans care 
about. 
I would rather talk about something 
that Americans actually care about: 
gassing up their cars and keeping the 
heat on. In November, President Biden 
said: ‘‘ . . . the reason Americans are 
facing high gas prices is because oil- 
producing countries and large compa-
nies have not ramped up the supply of 
oil quickly enough to meet the de-
mand, and the smaller supply means 
higher prices. . . .’’ 
Well, that is true. But he is not mak-
ing the point that he thinks he is. Yes, 
there is a lack of production, but the 
question is why. Why has the world’s 
number one oil and gas producer, the 
United States, not been able to ramp 
up production? The answer is actually 
simple: because Joe Biden has made it 
a priority to kill the American energy 
industry. 
President Biden cancelled the Key-
stone pipeline, outlawed new oil and 
gas leases on Federal lands and waters, 
and has threatened even more burden-
some regulations that put a freezing ef-
fect on any kind of new production 
that even Biden himself recognizes is 
needed. 
Of course, most recently, with the 
help of even my colleagues from Texas 
on the Democrat side, they managed to 
pass an unprecedented tax on natural 
gas through the House as part of their 
socialist spending package. 
It gets more interesting. In a letter 
to Speaker PELOSI, seven Texas Demo-
crats put the natural gas tax in stark 
terms saying: This tax will ‘‘cost thou-
sands of jobs, stifle economic recovery, 
increase energy costs for all Ameri-
cans, strengthen our adversaries, and 
ultimately impede the transition to a 
lower carbon future.’’ 
These are very strong and very true 
words from my Democratic colleagues, 
but guess what? They voted for it any-
ways. And now Democrats are scram-
bling because they know Americans are 
starting to feel the pain of their poli-
cies. It has gotten so bad that Demo-
crats are celebrating a two-cent de-
cline in gas prices. Oh, I thank Joe 
Biden for the two-cent decline. 
It would be funny if it weren’t so se-
rious 
that 
the 
Energy 
Secretary 
doesn’t even know that their plan to 
release from the strategic petroleum 
reserve was only about 2 days’ worth of 
oil. There is nothing funny about this. 
And the administration responds by 
telling people to put on a sweater and 
buy an electric vehicle. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
You know, we face a lot of challenges 
in this country and, in large part, we 
are still trying to come out of a pan-
demic that the previous administration 
tried to ignore.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7662 
December 14, 2021 
We actually have done some good 
things. We passed a major infrastruc-
ture bill. In the previous administra-
tion we had infrastructure week and 
infrastructure month, and a press con-
ference, but we actually passed a real 
infrastructure bill with bipartisan sup-
port over in the Senate and a handful 
of Republicans here. 
I say to the previous speaker, to sug-
gest that the American people don’t 
care about Islamophobia, I think, is in-
sulting. I mean, you say that to the 
Muslim student being bullied in a 
classroom because of their faith, or say 
that to a Muslim worshipper at a 
mosque that has been attacked, or say 
that to a Muslim family that has been 
belittled because of ignorances being 
promoted by some, including some in 
this Chamber. 
I mean, please, the American people 
are good and decent. They do not want 
to accept prejudice and bigotry and 
hate and discrimination. They expect 
better. 
We heard some talk earlier about the 
Uyghurs, and we need to do more for 
the Uyghurs, which we are doing, but I 
got a little whiplash saying that we 
need to move faster to combat the 
atrocities against the Muslim Uyghur 
population, but then on the other hand, 
we are told that nobody cares. You 
can’t have it both ways. 
But to suggest that the American 
people are indifferent to prejudice is 
something I won’t accept. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
I didn’t anticipate that we were 
going to talk about the pandemic, but 
since we are on the topic, let’s just get 
one thing clear. There have been more 
deaths from this pandemic under Presi-
dent 
Biden 
than 
under 
President 
Trump. Remember, President Trump is 
the one that put forth Operation Warp 
Speed with our pharmaceutical indus-
try to get a vaccine to market incred-
ibly quick, in fact, in record-breaking 
time. So again, there were more deaths 
under President Biden than President 
Trump. So who is really ignoring the 
pandemic? 
Let’s talk about the Uyghurs. The 
Chinese openly and proudly refer to 
Uyghur concentration camps as reedu-
cation camps. It is a sin how the Chi-
nese are trying to cover up the modern- 
day concentration camps they have. 
They claim they are necessary to ‘‘rid 
them 
of 
terrorists 
and 
extremist 
leanings.’’ 
In these camps you have torture like 
sleep deprivation; people are being 
hung from walls; people are being 
locked in what is called a tiger chair, a 
steel chair with fixed leg irons and 
handcuffs that render their body immo-
bile, often in very painful positions. 
Chinese officials have created a mas-
sive nearly week-long bonfire to burn 
documents that regard the oversight of 
these camps. 
It is time that we call out the Chi-
nese Communist Party for the atroc-
ities they are committing on the 
Uyghurs. 
When we are talking about legisla-
tion on this point it is actually the 
Speaker that slow-walked legislation 
by as much as 5 months. Let me ex-
plain the legislative history. The Sen-
ate passed the Uyghur Forced Labor 
Prevention Act, which bans imports of 
goods made with forced Uyghur labor, 
in July of 2021 unanimously. That was 
in the Senate. Top House Democrats 
pointed to a procedural issue and prom-
ised future action and then finally 
passed the bill in December. Again, a 5- 
month delay for what? 
Well, 
according 
to 
reports, 
the 
Speaker slow-walked this bill at the re-
quest of the Biden administration, who 
prioritized climate change and climate 
reforms over human rights violations 
in China. Further, the Biden adminis-
tration asked that the bill be watered 
down, which is truly disgusting when 
you look at the human rights viola-
tions going on in China. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mrs. 
GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, 
I 
rise 
in 
opposition 
to 
the 
Islamophobia 
bill. 
One 
thing 
that 
seems to be missing from this bill is 
the definition of Islamophobia. What 
this bill does is it sets up, through the 
State Department, an envoy to mon-
itor and combat acts of Islamophobia 
and 
Islamophobic 
incitement 
that 
occur in foreign countries. This is 
about Islamophobia in foreign coun-
tries and the State Department moni-
toring and combating these acts. This 
is what we need to talk about. What 
does that exactly mean? 
If we pass this resolution, does that 
mean our State Department is going to 
be monitoring how Israel responds 
when rockets are being fired from 
Hamas into Israel? If they defend 
themselves, does that mean the State 
Department is going to combat their 
actions because it will be considered 
Islamophobic? More questions need to 
be asked. 
In Europe, there are no-go zones with 
high crime statistics. As a matter of 
fact, rape is a modern occurrence that 
happens all the time in these no-go 
zones. So if women are raped by Mus-
lims in no-go zones and they want to 
file charges against them, is our State 
Department going to be monitoring 
those trials and then combating these 
women’s defense because they are 
claiming it is Islamophobic because 
Muslim men raped them and that be-
comes part of the conversation? 
What exactly does this mean, and 
why is our State Department taking 
this on? It shouldn’t be. As a matter of 
fact, this is a bill that we should not be 
debating. This is a bill we should not 
be voting on because the United States 
State Department doesn’t need to be 
monitoring 
and 
combating 
Islamophobia when it is not even de-
fined in the bill for foreign countries; 
not the United States of America. 
I have heard a lot of conversation 
from my colleagues across the aisle 
about Islamophobia in America, which 
we completely are against hate of any 
kind against anyone. And that is why 
we have laws against such hateful 
crimes and actions. But monitoring 
what is happening in foreign countries, 
which the State Department does, 
doesn’t mean that it needs to combat 
Islamophobia when it is not even de-
fined in the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield the gentlewoman an addi-
tional 15 seconds to summarize. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. This is a 
vote for every single person in Con-
gress that should be ‘‘no’’ because this 
is an open door with no end to the book 
of where this can go for the United 
States of America, and this is a role 
that we should not be engaging in. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I appreciate the fact that the gen-
tleman yielded the gentlewoman more 
time because that made absolutely no 
sense to me. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just say to the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania on the 
Uyghur thing; let me repeat the his-
tory again so it is clear to him. A year 
ago, we passed the Uyghur Forced 
Labor Prevention Act in the House. It 
went over to the Senate. MITCH MCCON-
NELL and Donald Trump killed it. No-
body said a word. 
The bill that passed last week that 
the gentleman was referring to is my 
bill. The bill that we are going to take 
up later today is my bill that we nego-
tiated the differences between the 
House and Senate with Senator RUBIO. 
The gentleman will be happy to know 
that the bill that we are passing today 
is stronger than the Senate-passed 
version. Maybe he would prefer a weak-
er version because that is what a lot of 
corporations that are very friendly to 
my Republican friends are now lob-
bying very hard for: a watered-down 
bill. 
So this bill is not watered down. It is 
a stronger bill than passed the Senate. 
I would even like it to be stronger. But 
please, don’t politicize human rights in 
a way where I think, to be fair, my 
friend is mischaracterizing what the 
history of this issue is. I don’t take a 
back seat to anybody when it comes to 
human rights or it comes to human 
rights with regard to the Uyghurs. We 
have been fighting for this for a long 
time and we finally have a Speaker of 
the House and a President of the 
United States who will sign this bill 
when it gets there. And I want to 
thank the leadership in the Senate. I 
want to thank Senator RUBIO. I want 
to thank Congressman SMITH here in 
the House, Ranking Member MCCAUL, 
and Chairman MEEKS for their coopera-
tion. 
But we are moving a bill forward 
that has teeth, that is real, that is 
tough. It is the strongest bill we have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7663 
December 14, 2021 
ever passed on this. But please don’t 
politicize it. I have been working on 
this too long. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time as I have no further speakers at 
this time, and I am prepared to close. 
I applaud Chairman MCGOVERN for 
his work on this piece of legislation. I 
applaud Senator RUBIO, of course, and 
my colleague, Mr. SMITH of New Jer-
sey, for working on the legislation. 
And just to clarify, when I was talking 
about the watered-down version that 
the administration is trying to water 
down, I was talking about the Senate 
version of this bill. If I misspoke, I 
want to clarify the RECORD now. That 
is what I was speaking to. 
But, again, I applaud anybody who is 
working on holding the Chinese Com-
munist 
Party 
accountable 
for 
the 
atrocities they are committing on the 
Uyghurs. Let me be clear about some-
thing: House Republicans will continue 
to stand against all forms of hate and 
Islamophobia. We will continue to 
stand with Uyghurs in China and with 
all people experiencing religious perse-
cution. 
Unfortunately, H.R. 5665, this piece of 
legislation, is a rushed bill. It presents 
serious First Amendment concerns. It 
will complicate existing efforts to pro-
tect human rights and religious free-
dom around the globe. It is also incred-
ibly duplicative. We already have the 
Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, 
and Labor. We already have the Office 
of International Religious Freedom. 
We already have the U.S. Commission 
on International Religious Freedom. 
We already have institutions and bod-
ies that are focused on this. 
For those reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question and ‘‘no’’ on the rule. I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, let me just say again 
that this really shouldn’t be controver-
sial at all, and I am sad that it is being 
politicized by some of my friends on 
the other side of the aisle. We have 
heard one objection after the next to 
this bill which condemns Islamophobia 
as 
if 
somehow 
condemning 
Islamophobia is some sort of a radical 
idea. 
I never thought I would yearn for the 
Republicanism of George W. Bush. But 
maybe things have gotten so out of 
control in the Republican Party today 
that Members cannot even stand here 
and publicly defend a Muslim from bul-
lying or worse. I pray that is not the 
case. 
Some things are about more than 
petty partisanship and towing the 
party line. This should be one of them. 
b 1400 
We have kids being bullied in school, 
hate crimes on the rise, mosques tar-
geted for violence. That is just here in 
America. Around the world, Muslims 
are being silenced from public dis-
course, forced into detention camps, or 
disappeared altogether. 
We are a Nation founded on the right 
to freedom of religion and freedom of 
worship. It is a fundamental part of 
being the United States of America. We 
must stand up and say that this is not 
right, the rise in Islamaphobia that we 
see globally. 
I want to recognize the leadership of 
Congresswoman OMAR, Congresswoman 
SCHAKOWSKY, and Chairman MEEKS. 
They understand that this is the right 
thing to do. It is the American thing to 
do. They have worked tirelessly to get 
this bill to the House floor. 
Now, we must get this bill over the 
finish line and on to the Senate be-
cause even today, even in this highly 
partisan era, the United States must 
and can still stand for human rights at 
home and abroad. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this rule and 
the underlying legislation. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 849 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
6235) to provide for the development of a plan 
to increase oil and gas production under oil 
and gas leases of Federal lands under the ju-
risdiction of the Secretary of Agriculture, 
the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of 
the Interior, and the Secretary of Defense in 
conjunction with a drawdown of petroleum 
reserves from the Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve. All points of order against consider-
ation of the bill are waived. The bill shall be 
considered as read. All points of order 
against provisions in the bill are waived. The 
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the bill and on any amendment 
thereto to final passage without intervening 
motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce; and (2) one motion to 
recommit. 
SEC. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 6235. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
JOHNSON of Georgia). The question is 
on ordering the previous question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings are postponed. 
f

RECOMMENDING THAT THE HOUSE 
FIND MARK RANDALL MEADOWS 
IN CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, by direction of the 
Select Committee to Investigate the 
January 6th Attack on the United 
States Capitol, I call up the report (H. 
Rept. 117–216) and accompanying reso-
lution recommending that the House of 
Representatives 
find 
Mark 
Randall 
Meadows in contempt of Congress for 
refusal to comply with a subpoena duly 
issued by the Select Committee to In-
vestigate the January 6th Attack on 
the United States Capitol. 
The Clerk read the title of the report. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MCCOLLUM). Pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 848, the report is considered read. 
The text of the report is as follows: 
The Select Committee to Investigate the 
January 6th Attack on the United States 
Capitol, having considered this Report, re-
ports favorably thereon and recommends 
that the Report be approved. 
The form of the Resolution that the Select 
Committee to Investigate the January 6th 
Attack on the United States Capitol would 
recommend to the House of Representatives 
for citing Mark Randall Meadows for con-
tempt of Congress pursuant to this Report is 
as follows: 
Resolved, That Mark Randall Meadows 
shall be found to be in contempt of Congress 
for failure to comply with a congressional 
subpoena. 
Resolved, That pursuant to 2 U.S.C. §§ 192 
and 194, the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives shall certify the report of the 
Select Committee to Investigate the Janu-
ary 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, 
detailing the refusal of Mark Randall Mead-
ows to appear for a deposition before the Se-
lect Committee to Investigate the January 
6th Attack on the United States Capitol as 
directed by subpoena, to the United States 
Attorney for the District of Columbia, to the 
end that Mr. Meadows be proceeded against 
in the manner and form provided by law. 
Resolved, That the Speaker of the House 
shall otherwise take all appropriate action 
to enforce the subpoena. 
PURPOSE AND SUMMARY 
On January 6, 2021, a violent mob breached 
the security perimeter of the United States 
Capitol, assaulted and injured scores of po-
lice officers, engaged in hand-to-hand vio-
lence with those officers over an extended 
period, terrorized Members of Congress and 
staff, and invaded and occupied the Capitol 
building, all in an effort to halt the lawful 
counting of electoral votes and reverse the 
results of the 2020 election. In the words of 
many of those who participated in the vio-
lence, the attack was a direct response to 
statements by then-President Donald J. 
Trump—beginning on election night 2020 and 
continuing through January 6, 2021—that the 
2020 election had been stolen by corrupted 
voting machines, widespread fraud, and oth-
erwise. 
In response, the House adopted House Res-
olution 503 on June 30, 2021, establishing the 
Select Committee to Investigate the Janu-
ary 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘‘Select Com-
mittee’’). 
The Select Committee is investigating the 
facts, circumstances, and causes of the Janu-
ary 6th attack and issues relating to the 
peaceful transfer of power, in order to iden-
tify how the events of January 6th were 
planned, what actions and statements moti-
vated and contributed to the attack on the 
Capitol, how the violent riot that day was 
coordinated with a political and public rela-
tions strategy to reverse the election out-
come, and why Capitol security was insuffi-
cient to address what occurred. The Select 
Committee will evaluate all facets of these 
issues, create a public record of what oc-
curred, and recommend to the House, and its 
relevant committees, corrective laws, poli-
cies, procedures, rules, or regulations. 
According to documents and testimony ob-
tained by the Select Committee, Mark Ran-
dall Meadows is uniquely situated to provide 
critical information about the events of Jan-
uary 6, 2021, as well as efforts taken by pub-
lic officials and private individuals to spread 
the message of widespread fraud in the No-
vember 2020 election and to delay or prevent 
the peaceful transfer of power. Mr. Meadows 
served as chief of staff to President Trump 
during the final year of the Trump adminis-
tration. As detailed in public reporting, Mr. 
Meadows was with or in the vicinity of then- 
President Trump on January 6 as Mr. Trump 
learned about the attack on the U.S. Capitol 
and decided whether to issue a statement 
that could help to stop the rioters. 
Mr. Meadows has refused to provide the Se-
lect Committee with information and testi-
mony that has no conceivable, associated 
privilege claims. To complete its investiga-
tion, the Select Committee needs access to 
testimony on this non-privileged informa-
tion. The Select Committee offers here just 
several examples: Mr. Meadows has refused 
to provide testimony on the documents he 
himself produced to the Select Committee 
without any claim of privilege; Mr. Meadows 
has refused to provide testimony about his 
reported communications with organizers of 
various protest events before January 6, 2021; 
Mr. Meadows personally travelled to Georgia 
to inspect a county audit related to the pres-
idential election, but the Select Committee 
has not been able to obtain testimony from 
Mr. Meadows about these events; and Mr. 
Meadows has also denied the Select Com-
mittee the opportunity to question him 
about a call with Georgia State officials in 
which Mr. Trump insisted that he had won 
Georgia and told the Georgia secretary of 
state that he wanted to ‘‘find’’ enough votes 
to ensure his victory. Yet another topic on 
which Mr. Meadows has frustrated the Select 
Committee’s investigative efforts relates to 
the Select Committee’s attempt to locate 
and discover highly relevant documents. 
Based on Mr. Meadows’s production of docu-
ments and recently reported information, it 
appears that Mr. Meadows may not have 
complied with legal requirements to retain 
or archive documents under the Presidential 
Records Act. He has denied the Select Com-
mittee the opportunity to question him 
about these circumstances so that the Select 
Committee can fully understand the location 
of highly relevant materials to its investiga-
tion and which materials may now be lost to 
the historical record. 
To be clear, Mr. Meadows’s failure to com-
ply, and this contempt recommendation, are 
not based on good-faith disagreements over 
privilege assertions. Rather, Mr. Meadows 
has failed to comply and warrants contempt 
findings because he has wholly refused to ap-
pear to provide any testimony and refused to 
answer questions regarding even clearly non- 
privileged information—information that he 
himself has identified as non-privileged 
through his own document production.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7668 
December 14, 2021 
Mr. Meadows’s relevant documents and 
testimony are necessary to the Select Com-
mittee’s investigation for many additional 
reasons. Mr. Meadows also reportedly par-
ticipated in meetings and communicated 
with senior Department of Justice (DOJ) of-
ficials 
about 
unsupported 
election-fraud 
claims and litigation aimed at disrupting or 
overturning the election results. Mr. Mead-
ows reportedly participated in a contentious 
meeting at the White House with private in-
dividuals and others linked to Mr. Trump’s 
re-election 
campaign 
during 
which 
Mr. 
Trump and others discussed seizing voting 
machines and invoking certain laws includ-
ing the National Emergencies Act for elec-
tion-related purposes because of purported 
fraud in the election. Mr. Meadows report-
edly joined a January 2 call with Mr. Trump 
and State and Federal officials to discuss 
overturning certain States’ electoral college 
results on January 6, and later sent the 
former Vice President’s staff a memo drafted 
by a Trump campaign lawyer urging the Vice 
President to delay or decline the counting of 
votes from certain States. Mr. Meadows was 
also reportedly in contact with at least one 
of the individuals who planned and organized 
a January 6 rally, one of whom may have ex-
pressed safety concerns to Mr. Meadows 
about the event. In short, Mr. Meadows ap-
pears to have participated in, and been a wit-
ness to, critically important communica-
tions and events that took place before and 
on January 6, and the Congress is entitled to 
hear his first-hand testimony regarding his 
actions and knowledge. The Select Com-
mittee expects such testimony to be directly 
relevant to its report and recommendations 
for legislative and other action. 
On September 23, 2021, the Select Com-
mittee issued a subpoena to Mr. Meadows for 
documents and testimony, and transmitted 
it along with a cover letter and schedule to 
Mr. Meadows’s then-counsel, who accepted 
service on Mr. Meadows’s behalf on that 
same day. The subpoena required that Mr. 
Meadows produce responsive documents by 
October 7, 2021, and that Mr. Meadows appear 
for a deposition on October 15, 2021. After Mr. 
Meadows retained separate counsel, the Se-
lect Committee agreed to postpone the sub-
poena deadlines to enable his counsel to un-
derstand the requests associated with the 
subpoena and work with Mr. Meadows. Ulti-
mately, by letter dated October 25, 2021, the 
Select 
Committee 
accommodated 
Mr. 
Meadows’s interest in moving back the date 
of his appearance and document production 
and instructed Mr. Meadows to produce doc-
uments by November 5, 2021, and appear for 
a deposition on November 12, 2021. 
Mr. Meadows’s resistance came after the 
Select Committee agreed to that postpone-
ment, after the Select Committee identified 
specific subject matters for inquiry that did 
not implicate any privilege, and after invit-
ing Mr. Meadows to explain with specificity 
his position as to whether any of those areas 
would trigger any claims of executive privi-
lege. Mr. Meadows provided no such expla-
nation. Instead, he declined to produce a sin-
gle document. He refused to carry out the 
commonly accepted practice of producing a 
privilege log in response to the Select Com-
mittee’s subpoena. And he failed to appear at 
the scheduled deposition, as ordered by the 
lawful subpoena. 
A week after Mr. Meadows failed to appear 
for his deposition and 2 weeks after his dead-
line to produce documents, Mr. Meadows re-
engaged with the Select Committee by let-
ter. The Select Committee gave Mr. Mead-
ows an opportunity to cure his previous non- 
compliance with the Select Committee’s sub-
poena by asking that he produce documents 
and appear at a deposition that, ultimately, 
was scheduled for December 8, 2021. Through 
counsel, Mr. Meadows agreed. Mr. Meadows 
produced a large number of responsive docu-
ments that were not subject to any claim of 
privilege, while withholding many others. 
But the day before his deposition, Mr. Mead-
ows changed course once more and told the 
Select Committee that he would not be at-
tending his deposition after all, even to an-
swer questions about the documents that he 
agrees are relevant and non-privileged that 
he had just produced. He did this even 
though that very same day his book was re-
leased in which he recounts specific con-
versations that he had with former-President 
Trump, 
including 
conversations 
about 
whether the former President planned to join 
a march to the United States Capitol on Jan-
uary 6 after encouraging rally-goers to do so. 
On December 8, 2021, Mr. Meadows failed to 
appear for his deposition. 
Although Mr. Meadows’s counsel has ref-
erenced claims of testimonial immunity and 
executive privilege purportedly relayed by 
Mr. Trump’s counsel, no such claims have 
been presented by Mr. Trump to the Select 
Committee. Moreover, the current White 
House has informed Mr. Meadows that the 
incumbent President is not asserting claims 
of testimonial immunity or executive privi-
lege to prevent Mr. Meadows from complying 
with the Select Committee’s subpoena. 
The Select Committee is confident that 
there is no conceivable immunity or execu-
tive privilege claim that could bar all of the 
Select Committee’s requests or justify Mr. 
Meadows’s blanket refusal to appear for the 
required deposition. Indeed, the Chairman’s 
written responses on October 25, 2021, No-
vember 5, 2021, and November 11, 2021, ad-
dressed the legal arguments raised by Mr. 
Meadows’s counsel and made clear that the 
Select Committee expected—as the law de-
mands—that Mr. Meadows produce docu-
ments and appear before the Select Com-
mittee at his deposition to raise any privi-
lege or other concerns regarding specific 
questions on the record of that proceeding. 
The contempt of Congress statute, 2 U.S.C. 
§ 192, provides that a witness summoned be-
fore Congress must appear or be ‘‘deemed 
guilty of a misdemeanor’’ punishable by a 
fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for 
up to 1 year. Further, the Supreme Court in 
United States v. Bryan (1950) emphasized that 
the subpoena power is a ‘‘public duty, which 
every person within the jurisdiction of the 
Government is bound to perform when prop-
erly summoned.’’ The Supreme Court re-
cently reinforced this clear obligation by 
stating that ‘‘[w]hen Congress seeks infor-
mation needed for intelligent legislative ac-
tion, it unquestionably remains the duty of 
all citizens to cooperate.’’ 
Mr. Meadows did not produce documents as 
required by the subpoena’s October 7, 2021, 
deadline or the extended deadline of Novem-
ber 5, 2021. Similarly, Mr. Meadows did not 
appear for a deposition scheduled for October 
15, 2021, or the extended deadline of Novem-
ber 12, 2021, as ordered by the subpoena and 
in contravention of the clear instructions by 
the Select Committee Chairman’s letters 
dated October 25, 2021, November 5, 2021, No-
vember 9, 2021, and November 11, 2021, to ap-
pear at the deposition and raise any privilege 
concerns in response to specific questions on 
the record. Furthermore, Mr. Meadows chose 
not to appear before the Select Committee 
on December 8, 2021, to cure his previous 
non-compliance and after specifically agree-
ing to do so. Mr. Meadows’s refusal to com-
ply with the Select Committee’s subpoena 
constitutes willful default under the law and 
warrants contempt of Congress and referral 
to the United States Attorney for the Dis-
trict of Columbia for prosecution as pre-
scribed by law. The denial of the information 
sought by the subpoena impairs Congress’s 
central powers under the United States Con-
stitution. 
BACKGROUND ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE’S 
INVESTIGATION 
House Resolution 503 sets out the specific 
purposes of the Select Committee, including: 
∑
To investigate and report upon the 
facts, circumstances, and causes ‘‘relating to 
the January 6, 2021, domestic terrorist at-
tack upon the United States Capitol Com-
plex’’; 
∑ To investigate and report upon the facts, 
circumstances, and causes ‘‘relating to the 
interference with the peaceful transfer of 
power’’; and 
∑ To investigate and report upon the facts, 
circumstances, and causes relating to ‘‘the 
influencing factors that fomented such an 
attack on American representative democ-
racy while engaged in a constitutional proc-
ess.’’ 
The Supreme Court has long recognized 
Congress’s oversight role. ‘‘The power of the 
Congress to conduct investigations is inher-
ent in the legislative process.’’ Indeed, 
Congress’s ability to enforce its investiga-
tory power ‘‘is an essential and appropriate 
auxiliary to the legislative function.’’ ‘‘Ab-
sent such a power, a legislative body could 
not ‘wisely or effectively’ evaluate those 
conditions ‘which the legislation is intended 
to affect or change.’ ’’ 
The oversight powers of House and Senate 
committees are also codified in law. For ex-
ample, the Legislative Reorganization Act of 
1946 directed committees to ‘‘exercise con-
tinuous watchfulness’’ over the executive 
branch’s implementation of programs within 
its jurisdictions, and the Legislative Reorga-
nization Act of 1970 authorized committees 
to ‘‘review and study, on a continuing basis, 
the application, administration, and execu-
tion’’ of laws. 
The Select Committee was properly con-
stituted under section 2(a) of House Resolu-
tion 503, 117th Congress. As required by that 
resolution, Members of the Select Com-
mittee were selected by the Speaker, after 
‘‘consultation with the minority leader.’’ A 
bipartisan selection of Members was ap-
pointed pursuant to House Resolution 503 on 
July 1, 2021, and July 26, 2021. 
Pursuant to House rule XI and House Reso-
lution 503, the Select Committee is author-
ized ‘‘to require, by subpoena or otherwise, 
the attendance and testimony of such wit-
nesses and the production of books, records, 
correspondence, memoranda, papers, and 
documents as it considers necessary.’’ That 
same House rule expressly allows House com-
mittees to compel information from the 
President and his aides. Further, section 
5(c)(4) of House Resolution 503 provides that 
the Chairman of the Select Committee may 
‘‘authorize and issue subpoenas pursuant to 
clause 2(m) of rule XI in the investigation 
and study’’ conducted pursuant to the enu-
merated purposes and functions of the Select 
Committee. The Select Committee’s author-
izing resolution further states that the 
Chairman ‘‘may order the taking of deposi-
tions, including pursuant to subpoena, by a 
Member or counsel of the Select Committee, 
in the same manner as a standing committee 
pursuant to section 3(b)(1) of House Resolu-
tion 8, One Hundred Seventeenth Congress.’’ 
The subpoena to Mr. Meadows was duly 
issued pursuant to section 5(c)(4) of House 
Resolution 503 and clause 2(m) of rule XI of 
the Rules of the House of Representatives.

obligation to investigate and report on the 
facts, circumstances, and causes of the at-
tack on January 6, 2021, and on the facts, cir-
cumstances, and causes ‘‘relating to the in-
terference with the peaceful transfer of 
power.’’ 
The events of January 6, 2021, involved 
both a physical assault on the Capitol build-
ing and law enforcement personnel pro-
tecting it and an attack on the constitu-
tional process central to the peaceful trans-
fer of power following a presidential elec-
tion. The counting of electoral college votes 
by Congress is a component of that transfer 
of power that occurs every January 6 fol-
lowing a presidential election. This event is 
part of a complex process, mediated through 
the free and fair elections held in jurisdic-
tions throughout the country, and through 
the statutory and constitutional processes 
set up to confirm and validate the results. In 
the case of the 2020 presidential election, the 
January 6 electoral college vote count oc-
curred following a series of efforts in the pre-
ceding weeks by Mr. Trump and his sup-
porters to challenge the legitimacy of, dis-
rupt, delay, and overturn the election re-
sults. 
According to eyewitness accounts as well 
as the statements of participants in the at-
tack on January 6, 2021, a purpose of the as-
sault was to stop the process of validating 
what then-President Trump, his supporters, 
and his allies had falsely characterized as a 
‘‘stolen’’ 
or 
‘‘fraudulent’’ 
election. 
The 
claims regarding the 2020 election results 
were advanced and amplified in the weeks 
leading up to the January 6 assault, even 
after courts across the country had resound-
ingly rejected Trump campaign lawsuits 
claiming election fraud and misconduct, and 
after all States had certified the election re-
sults. As part of this effort, Mr. Trump and 
his 
associates 
spread 
false 
information 
about, and cast doubts on, the elections in 
Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Geor-
gia, among other states, and pressed Federal, 
State, and local officials to use their au-
thorities to challenge the election results. 
To fulfill its investigative responsibilities, 
the Select Committee needs to understand 
the events and communications in which Mr. 
Meadows reportedly participated or that he 
observed. 
Mr. Meadows was one of a relatively small 
group of people who witnessed the events of 
January 6 in the White House and with then- 
President Trump. Mr. Meadows was with or 
in the vicinity of then-President Trump on 
January 6 as he learned about the attack on 
the U.S. Capitol and decided whether to issue 
a statement that could stop the rioters. In 
fact, as the violence at the Capitol unfolded, 
Mr. Meadows received many messages en-
couraging him to have Mr. Trump issue a 
statement that could end the violence, and 
one former White House employee reportedly 
contacted Mr. Meadows several times and 
told him, ‘‘[y]ou guys have to say something. 
Even if the president’s not willing to put out 
a statement, you should go to the [cameras] 
and say, ‘We condemn this. Please stand 
down.’ If you don’t, people are going to die.’’ 
Moreover, Mr. Meadows reportedly spoke 
with Kashyap Patel, who was then the chief 
of staff to former Acting Secretary of De-
fense Christopher Miller, ‘‘nonstop’’ through-
out the day of January 6. And, among other 
things, Mr. Meadows apparently knows if 
and when Mr. Trump was engaged in discus-
sions regarding the National Guard’s re-
sponse to the Capitol riot, a point that is 
contested but about which Mr. Meadows pro-
vided documents to the Select Committee 
and spoke publicly on national television 
after President Trump left office. 
Beyond those matters, the Select Com-
mittee seeks information from Mr. Meadows 
about issues including the following: 
∑ Mr. Meadows exchanged text messages 
with, and provided guidance to, an organizer 
of the January 6th rally on the Ellipse after 
the organizer told him that ‘‘[t]hings have 
gotten crazy and I desperately need some di-
rection. Please.’’ 
∑ Mr. Meadows sent an email to an indi-
vidual about the events on January 6 and 
said that the National Guard would be 
present to ‘‘protect pro Trump people’’ and 
that many more would be available on stand-
by. 
∑ Mr. Meadows received text messages and 
emails regarding apparent efforts to encour-
age Republican legislators in certain States 
to send alternate slates of electors to Con-
gress, a plan which one Member of Congress 
acknowledged was ‘‘highly controversial’’ 
and to which Mr. Meadows responded, ‘‘I love 
it.’’ Mr. Meadows responded to a similar 
message by saying ‘‘[w]e are’’ and another 
such message by saying ‘‘Yes. Have a team 
on it.’’ 
∑ Mr. Meadows forwarded claims of elec-
tion fraud to the acting leadership of DOJ 
for further investigation, some of which he 
may have received using a private email ac-
count and at least one of which he had re-
ceived directly from people associated with 
Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign. 
∑ He also reportedly introduced Mr. Trump 
to then-DOJ official Jeffrey Clark. Mr. Clark 
went on to recommend to Mr. Trump that he 
be installed as Acting Attorney General and 
that DOJ should send a letter to State offi-
cials urging them to take certain actions 
that could affect the outcome of the Novem-
ber 2020 election by, among other things, ap-
pointing alternate slates of electors to cast 
electoral votes for Mr. Trump rather than 
now-President Biden. 
∑ Mr. Meadows participated in meetings 
and calls during which the participants re-
portedly discussed the need to ‘‘fight’’ back 
against ‘‘mounting evidence’’ of purported 
voter fraud after courts had considered and 
overwhelmingly rejected Trump campaign 
claims of voter fraud and other election 
irregularities. He participated in one such 
meeting in the Oval Office with Mr. Trump 
and Members of Congress, which he publicly 
tweeted about from his personal Twitter ac-
count shortly after. He participated in an-
other such call just days before the January 
6 attack with Mr. Trump, Members of Con-
gress, attorneys for the Trump re-election 
campaign, and ‘‘some 300’’ State and local of-
ficials to discuss the goal of overturning cer-
tain States’ electoral college results on Jan-
uary 6, 2021. 
∑ Mr. Meadows traveled to Georgia to ob-
serve an audit of the votes days after then- 
President Trump complained that the audit 
had been moving too slowly and claimed that 
the signature-match system was rife with 
fraud. That trip precipitated Mr. Trump’s 
calls to Georgia’s deputy secretary of state 
and, later, secretary of state. In the call with 
Georgia’s secretary of state, which Mr. 
Meadows and an attorney working with the 
campaign also joined, Mr. Trump pressed his 
unsupported claims of widespread election 
fraud, including claims related to deceased 
people voting, forged signatures, out-of- 
State voters, shredded ballots, triple-count-
ed ballots, Dominion voting machines, and 
suitcase ballots, before telling the secretary 
of state that he wanted to find enough votes 
to ensure his victory. At one point during 
the call, Mr. Meadows asked ‘‘in the spirit of 
cooperation and compromise, is there some-
thing that we can at least have a discussion 
to look at some of these allegations to find 
a path forward that’s less litigious?’’ At that 
point, Mr. Trump had filed two lawsuits in 
his personal capacity and on behalf of the 
campaign in Georgia, but the United States 
had not filed—and never did file—any. Mr. 
Meadows used a personal account in his at-
tempts to reach the secretary of state before. 
∑ Mr. Meadows was chief of staff during 
the post-election period when other White 
House staff, including the press secretary, 
advanced claims of election fraud. In one 
press conference, the press secretary claimed 
that there were ‘‘very real claims’’ of fraud 
that the Trump re-election campaign was 
pursuing and said that mail-in voting was 
one that ‘‘we have identified as being par-
ticularly prone to fraud.’’ 
∑ Mr. Meadows participated in a meeting 
that reportedly occurred on December 18, 
2020, with Mr. Trump, the White House coun-
sel, an attorney associated with the cam-
paign, White House staff, and private citi-
zens, on proposals relating to challenging 
the 2020 election results. During the meeting, 
the participants reportedly discussed pur-
ported foreign interference in the election, 
seizing voting machines, invoking certain 
Federal laws like the National Emergencies 
Act, and appointing one of the attendees as 
a special counsel with a Top Secret security 
clearance to investigate fraud in the elec-
tion. White House officials, including Mr. 
Meadows, may have resisted some of the pro-
posals, but, at one point, Mr. Trump report-
edly said: ‘‘You [White House] guys are offer-
ing me nothing. These guys are at least of-
fering me a chance. They’re saying they have 
the evidence. Why not try this?’’ 
∑ Mr. Meadows reportedly sent an email— 
subject line: ‘‘Constitutional Analysis of the 
Vice President’s Authority for January 6, 
2021, Vote Count’’—to a member of then-Vice 
President Pence’s senior staff containing a 
memo written by an attorney affiliated with 
Mr. 
Trump’s 
re-election 
campaign. 
The 
memo argued that the Vice President could 
declare electoral votes in six States in dis-
pute when they came up for a vote during 
the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 
2021, which would require those States’ legis-
latures to send a response to Congress by 7 
p.m. EST on January 15 or, if they did not, 
then congressional delegations would vote 
for Mr. Trump’s re-election. 
∑ Mr. Meadows was in contact with at 
least some of the private individuals who 
planned and organized a January 6 rally, one 
of whom reportedly may have expressed safe-
ty concerns to Mr. Meadows about January 6 
events. Mr. Meadows used his personal cell 
phone to discuss the rally in the days leading 
up to January 6. 
∑ Mr. Meadows described in his book, The 
Chief’s Chief, specific conversations that he 
had with Mr. Trump while he was the Presi-
dent about, among other things, fraud in the 
election and the January 6th attack on the 
United States Capitol. In one passage about 
the 
election, 
Mr. 
Meadows 
quotes 
Mr. 
Trump. In another passage about January 6, 
Mr. Meadows describes a conversation he had 
with Mr. Trump after Mr. Trump spoke to 
rally goers and, presumably, just after the 
attack on the Capitol had started. 
It is apparent that Mr. Meadows’s testi-
mony and document production are of crit-
ical importance to the Select Committee’s 
investigation. Congress, through the Select 
Committee, is entitled to discover facts con-
cerning what led to the attack on the U.S. 
Capitol on January 6, as well as White House 
officials’ actions and communications during 
and after the attack. Mr. Meadows is unique-
ly situated to provide key information, hav-
ing straddled an official role in the White 
House and unofficial role related to Mr. 
Trump’s re-election campaign since at least 
election day in 2020 through January 6. 
B. Mr. Meadows has refused to comply with the 
Select Committee’s subpoena. 
On September 23, 2021, the Select Com-
mittee sent a subpoena to Mr. Meadows or-
dering the production of both documents and

December 14, 2021 
testimony relevant to the Select Commit-
tee’s investigation. The accompanying letter 
set forth a schedule specifying categories of 
related documents sought by the Select 
Committee on topics including, but not lim-
ited to, documents and communications re-
garding the 2020 election results sent or 
transmitted between White House officials 
and officials of State or local governments; 
communications regarding challenging, de-
certifying, overturning, or contesting the re-
sults of the 2020 presidential election; com-
munications with Members of Congress on 
January 6 relating to or referring to the at-
tack on the Capitol; documents and commu-
nications related to security of the Capitol 
or other Federal facilities on January 5, 2021, 
and January 6, 2021; and documents and com-
munications regarding any plan for the 
former President to march or walk to the 
Capitol. 
The subpoena required Mr. Meadows to 
produce the requested documents to the Se-
lect Committee on October 7, 2021, and to 
provide testimony on October 15, 2021. As au-
thorized by Mr. Meadows, attorney Scott 
Gast accepted service of this subpoena on be-
half of Mr. Meadows on September 23, 2021. 
On October 7, 2021, George J. Terwilliger, III, 
sent a letter to the Select Committee advis-
ing that he had been retained to serve as 
counsel to Mr. Meadows for purposes of the 
Select Committee’s inquiry. 
On October 12, 2021, Mr. Terwilliger and 
staff for the Select Committee had a tele-
phone call to discuss the Select Committee’s 
subpoena to Mr. Meadows. During that call, 
staff for the Select Committee previewed 
certain topics of inquiry they intended to de-
velop during Mr. Meadows’s deposition and 
for which claims of executive privilege 
should not apply. Chairman THOMPSON in-
cluded that list of topics in a later letter to 
Mr. Terwilliger dated October 25, 2021. 
On 
October 
13, 
2021, 
Mr. 
Terwilliger 
emailed staff for the Select Committee and 
referenced ‘‘the potential for conflicting di-
rections from former-President Trump and 
President Biden as to preservation of privi-
leges concerning senior presidential advisors 
and communication by the same in that 
role.’’ Mr. Terwilliger stated that he was 
scheduled to discuss ‘‘privilege issues’’ with 
the White House [c]ounsel’s office on October 
14 but indicated that it was ‘‘not clear . . . 
that, in whole or in part, relevant privileges 
would not attach to Mr. Meadows[’] testi-
mony’’ as to topics that staff for the Select 
Committee outlined during the October 12 
telephone call. Accordingly, he informed the 
Select Committee that he ‘‘could not advise’’ 
Mr. Meadows to ‘‘commit to testifying’’ on 
the subpoena designated date of October 15. 
Mr. Terwilliger also emailed to staff for the 
Select Committee an October 6, 2021, letter 
from former-President Trump’s counsel, Jus-
tin Clark, to Mr. Meadows’s then-counsel, 
Mr. 
Gast, 
expressing 
former-President 
Trump’s apparent belief that ‘‘Mr. Meadows 
is immune from compelled congressional tes-
timony on matters related to his official re-
sponsibilities.’’ The letter also purports to 
‘‘instruct[]’’ Mr. Meadows ‘‘(a) where appro-
priate, invoke any immunities and privilege 
he may have from compelled testimony in 
response to the [s]ubpoena; (b) not produce 
any documents concerning his official duties 
in response to the [s]ubpoena; and (c) not 
provide any testimony concerning his offi-
cial duties in response to the [s]ubpoena.’’ 
On October 25, 2021, Chairman THOMPSON 
responded to Mr. Terwilliger’s October 7, 
2021, letter and October 13, 2021, email. He 
stated that even assuming that, as a former 
President, Mr. Trump is permitted to for-
mally invoke executive privilege, Mr. Trump 
had not communicated an invocation of 
privilege, either formally or informally, to 
the Select Committee with respect to Mr. 
Meadows’s production of documents or ap-
pearance to provide testimony. The October 
25 response from Chairman THOMPSON fur-
ther stated that—even assuming a privilege 
applied to Mr. Meadows’s documents and tes-
timony and former-President Trump had for-
mally invoked a privilege (which was not the 
case)—Mr. Meadows does not enjoy anything 
like the type of blanket testimonial immu-
nity 
former-President 
Trump 
and 
Mr. 
Terwilliger suggested would insulate Mr. 
Meadows from an obligation to comply with 
the Select Committee’s subpoena. The letter 
also noted that, regardless, the information 
the Select Committee seeks from Mr. Mead-
ows involves a range of subjects that cannot 
be considered part of Mr. Meadows’s ‘‘official 
responsibilities,’’ including but not limited 
to ‘‘communications and meetings involving 
people who did not work for the United 
States government’’; ‘‘Mr. Meadows’[] cam-
paign-related activities’’; and ‘‘communica-
tions and meetings about topics for which 
the Department of Justice and the White 
House have expressly declined to assert exec-
utive privilege.’’ 
The Chairman’s October 25 letter extended 
the subpoena’s document production dead-
line to November 5, 2021, and extended 
Meadows’s appearance for deposition testi-
mony to November 12, 2021. It also made 
clear that the Select Committee would view 
failure to respond to the subpoena as willful 
non-compliance, which would force the Se-
lect Committee to consider invoking the 
contempt of Congress procedures pursuant to 
2 U.S.C. §§ 192 and 194, as well as the possi-
bility of civil enforcement proceedings. 
On November 3, 2021, Mr. Terwilliger trans-
mitted a letter to the Select Committee, re-
sponding to Chairman THOMPSON’s October 
25, 2021, letter with respect to the production 
of documents. In it, Mr. Terwilliger stated 
that he was ‘‘not aware at this time of any 
documents that are responsive to the Select 
Committee’s subpoena and maintained in 
Mr. Meadows’s custody or control,’’ and that 
he ‘‘therefore ha[d] no documents to produce 
to the Select Committee.’’ 
That same day, Mr. Terwilliger trans-
mitted to the Select Committee a second let-
ter. In it, Mr. Terwilliger suggested that Mr. 
Meadows maintains a ‘‘good faith’’ belief 
that he cannot comply with the subpoena 
and testify before Congress and, instead, pro-
posed unspecified accommodations. Notably, 
Mr. Terwilliger acknowledged that courts 
had universally rejected Mr. Meadows’s posi-
tion on absolute testimonial immunity, but 
claimed that the executive branch had never 
‘‘retreated from that position’’ and that the 
Supreme Court had never weighed in. 
On November 5, 2021, Chairman THOMPSON 
responded to Mr. Terwilliger’s November 3 
letters. Chairman THOMPSON noted that al-
though Mr. Terwilliger stated that Mr. 
Meadows had no documents to produce to 
the Select Committee, Mr. Terwilliger had 
previously indicated that he had gathered 
documents from Mr. Meadows and was re-
viewing those documents for responsiveness. 
The November 5 letter also reiterated Mr. 
Meadows’s obligation to provide a privilege 
log detailing each document and each privi-
lege that he believes applied for any respon-
sive documents so the Select Committee 
could evaluate whether any additional ac-
tions 
are 
appropriate, 
reminded 
Mr. 
Terwilliger that categorical claims of execu-
tive privilege are improper and that Mr. 
Meadows must assert any such claim made 
by former-President Trump narrowly and 
specifically. Chairman THOMPSON
further 
noted that the Select Committee had re-
ceived 
information 
suggesting 
that 
Mr. 
Meadows used his personal cell phone for 
communications relevant to the Select Com-
mittee’s inquiry, some of which potentially 
would fall under Presidential Records Act re-
quirements. Accordingly, Chairman THOMP-
SON requested that Mr. Terwilliger identify 
for the Select Committee the current loca-
tion of Mr. Meadows’s cell phone and wheth-
er Mr. Meadows provided his texts and other 
relevant cell phone records to the National 
Archives. 
In an effort to reach an accommodation 
with respect to Mr. Meadows’s deposition, 
the November 5, 2021, letter provided further 
information regarding the topics the Select 
Committee intended to develop with Mr. 
Meadows during the deposition, some of 
which the Chairman had previously identi-
fied in his October 25, 2021, letter. These top-
ics 
included 
but 
were 
not 
limited 
to 
‘‘[m]essaging to or from the White House, 
Trump reelection campaign, party officials, 
and others about purported fraud, irregular-
ities, or malfeasance in the November 2020 
election’’; ‘‘[e]fforts to pressure federal agen-
cies, including the Department of Justice, to 
take actions to challenge the results of the 
presidential election, advance allegations of 
voter fraud, interfere with Congress’s count 
of the Electoral College vote, or otherwise 
overturn President Biden’s certified vic-
tory’’; ‘‘[e]fforts to pressure former Vice 
President Pence, members of his staff, and 
Members of Congress to delay or prevent cer-
tification of the Electoral College vote’’; 
‘‘[c]ampaign related activities’’ including 
Mr. Meadows’s ‘‘travel to Georgia’’ and con-
tacts with ‘‘officials and employees in the 
Georgia 
secretary 
of 
state’s 
Office’’; 
‘‘[m]eetings or other communications in-
volving people who did not work for the 
United States government’’ including ‘‘Mi-
chael Flynn, Patrick Byrne,’’ and ‘‘orga-
nizers of the January 6 rally like Amy 
Kremer’’; and ‘‘[a]dvance knowledge of, and 
any preparations for, the possibility of vio-
lence during election-related rallies and/or 
protests in Washington, D.C.’’ The letter 
made clear that the Select Committee did 
not expect to seek information from Mr. 
Meadows unrelated to the 2020 election and 
what led to and occurred on January 6, and 
indicated a willingness to discuss and nego-
tiate any additional areas or subjects about 
which the Select Committee would seek in-
formation from Mr. Meadows as the Select 
Committee 
continued 
its 
investigation. 
Chairman THOMPSON invited input from Mr. 
Meadows on the delineated topics by Novem-
ber 8. As in previous correspondence, Chair-
man THOMPSON stated that the Select Com-
mittee would view failure to respond to the 
subpoena as willful non-compliance, which 
would force the Select Committee to con-
sider invoking the contempt of Congress pro-
cedures pursuant to 2 U.S.C. §§ 192 and 194, in 
addition to the possibility of civil enforce-
ment proceedings. 
On November 8, 2021, Mr. Terwilliger re-
sponded, stating that he was ‘‘reiterate[ing]’’ 
Mr. Meadows’s position that he ‘‘cannot be 
compelled to provide congressional testi-
mony’’ as a former White House chief of 
staff. As a purported ‘‘accommodation,’’ Mr. 
Terwilliger proposed ‘‘that the Select Com-
mittee propound written interrogatories to 
Mr. Meadows on any topics about which the 
Select Committee may wish to inquire.’’ Mr. 
Terwilliger also indicated that Mr. Meadows 
had provided him with access to electronic 
images from his personal accounts and de-
vices, the review of which was ‘‘ongoing.’’ 
Regarding the list of topics outlined in the 
November 5 letter, Mr. Terwilliger asserted, 
without specifically and narrowly addressing 
on a topic-by-topic basis, that the topics 
‘‘plainly implicate executive privilege even 
under a narrow interpretation of it,’’ and ex-
pressed the belief that Mr. Meadows could 
not testify about the topics without impli-
cating executive privilege.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7671 
December 14, 2021 
In a November 9, 2021, letter to Mr. 
Terwilliger, Chairman THOMPSON stated that 
Mr. Terwilliger’s November 8 letter failed to 
respond with any specificity about the topics 
of inquiry by the Select Committee, leading 
the Select Committee to assume that Mr. 
Terwilliger believed that all of the topics po-
tentially 
implicated 
executive 
privilege. 
Chairman THOMPSON
further stated that 
without further input on those topics, which 
the Select Committee had requested in its 
November 5 letter, the Select Committee 
must insist that Mr. Meadows appear for a 
deposition on November 12, as required by 
the subpoena, and that written interrog-
atories were not an acceptable substitute for 
live, in-person testimony. The November 9 
letter further stated that the Select Com-
mittee had identified evidence regarding Mr. 
Meadows’s use of personal cellular phone and 
email accounts, and, because of that, it 
would be a subject of inquiry during the No-
vember 12 deposition. The letter listed eight 
specific questions concerning the informa-
tion that the Select Committee would seek 
to develop regarding this issue, none of 
which implicated any executive or other 
privilege. 
Meanwhile, on November 9, 2021, the Fed-
eral District Court for the District of Colum-
bia issued a ruling rejecting Donald Trump’s 
attempt to prohibit disclosure of White 
House documents to the Select Committee 
by asserting the executive privilege. The 
Federal court held ‘‘that the public interest 
lies in permitting—not enjoining—the com-
bined will of the legislative and executive 
branches to study the events that led to and 
occurred on January 6, and to consider legis-
lation to prevent such events from ever oc-
curring again.’’ The United States Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit 
affirmed the district court’s ruling on De-
cember 9, 2021. 
On November 10, 2021, Mr. Terwilliger ac-
knowledged receipt of Chairman THOMPSON’s 
November 9, 2021, letter, but did not address 
the 
eight 
specific 
questions 
Chairman 
THOMPSON
included in his letter, instead 
stating that ‘‘Mr. Meadows cannot agree to 
appear at 10 AM Friday’’ and again claiming 
that Mr. Meadows believed that ‘‘senior 
aides to the president cannot be compelled to 
provide congressional testimony.’’ 
On November 11, 2021, the White House 
Counsel’s Office issued a letter to Mr. 
Terwilliger regarding the Select Commit-
tee’s subpoena to Mr. Meadows. That letter 
stated: ‘‘in recognition of these unique and 
extraordinary circumstances, where Con-
gress is investigating an effort to obstruct 
the lawful transfer of power under our Con-
stitution, President Biden has already deter-
mined that an assertion of executive privi-
lege is not in the public interest, and is 
therefore not justified, with respect to par-
ticular subjects within the purview of the 
Select Committee.’’ The letter further noted 
that, consistent with this determination, 
President Biden ‘‘will not assert executive 
privilege with respect to [Mr. Meadows’s] 
deposition testimony on these subjects, or 
any documents your client may possess that 
may bear on them,’’ and ‘‘will not assert im-
munity to preclude [Mr. Meadows] from tes-
tifying before the Select Committee.’’ 
Later on November 11, 2021, Chairman 
THOMPSON
sent 
another 
letter 
to 
Mr. 
Terwilliger. This letter summarized the cor-
respondence between Mr. Terwilliger and the 
Select Committee, and again noted that Mr. 
Meadows’s reliance on opinions regarding ab-
solute immunity from the Department of 
Justice Office of Legal Counsel (‘‘OLC’’) was 
misguided given that their reasoning has 
been rejected by all Federal courts to have 
considered the issue of absolute immunity. 
The Chairman’s letter emphasized that, in 
any event, the White House Counsel’s Office 
letter from earlier that day ‘‘eviscerates any 
plausible claim of testimonial immunity or 
executive privilege, and compels compliance 
with the Select Committee’s subpoena.’’ 
On November 12, 2021, at 10 a.m., Mr. Mead-
ows failed to appear at the designated loca-
tion to provide testimony relevant to the Se-
lect Committee’s inquiry in response to 
questions posed, as was required by the sub-
poena. He also failed to produce any respon-
sive documents or a privilege log identifying 
the specific basis for withholding any docu-
ments believed to be protected by privilege. 
On November 19, 2021, a full week after Mr. 
Meadows failed to appear for a deposition 
and two weeks after the deadline to produce 
documents, Mr. Terwilliger sent a letter to 
Chairman THOMPSON purportedly seeking an 
accommodation and suggesting, again, that 
the Select Committee send interrogatories 
to Mr. Meadows as a first step in a longer ac-
commodation process that ‘‘could,’’ depend-
ing on certain negotiations and parameters, 
result in a limited ‘‘deposition’’ ‘‘outside of 
compulsion by subpoena.’’ Mr. Terwilliger 
made clear that Mr. Meadows would only an-
swer interrogatories on a narrow range of 
topics, and even on those topics would not 
provide any information regarding commu-
nications with the former President, former 
senior White House aides, and other individ-
uals with whom Mr. Meadows spoke on be-
half of the President unless the former Presi-
dent explicitly authorized him to do so. 
Chairman THOMPSON
responded to Mr. 
Terwilliger on November 22, 2021. In his re-
sponse, 
the 
Chairman 
rejected 
Mr. 
Terwilliger’s proposal to proceed by inter-
rogatories instead of lawfully-compelled tes-
timony and production of documents. In re-
jecting Mr. Terwilliger’s proposal for a sec-
ond time, the Chairman noted that ‘‘[w]hen 
Mr. Meadows first proposed interrogatories, 
he asked that the Select Committee ‘pro-
pound’ them, but did not say that he would 
actually provide any substantive informa-
tion in response.’’ The Chairman further 
noted, ‘‘[n]ow, after his failure to comply 
with the Select Committee’s subpoena, [Mr. 
Meadows] has added conditions: (1) the inter-
rogatories can only ask questions about two 
days in January 2021 and Mr. Meadows’s 
communications with the Department of 
Justice; and (2) Mr. Meadows will only re-
spond to questions about his communica-
tions ‘with or on behalf of the [former] Presi-
dent, or with other senior White House aides’ 
provided that he first obtains the former 
President’s approval.’’ Chairman THOMPSON 
then walked through the Select Committee’s 
lengthy 
correspondence 
with 
Mr. 
Terwilliger, and explained that ‘‘[t]his his-
tory has led the Select Committee to suspect 
that you are simply engaged in an effort to 
delay, and that Mr. Meadows has no genuine 
intent to offer any testimony on any rel-
evant topic.’’ Nevertheless, the Chairman ex-
tended Mr. Meadows an opportunity to show 
that he was operating in good faith by in-
structing Mr. Meadows to provide documents 
responsive to the original subpoena by No-
vember 26, 2021, and to appear for a deposi-
tion that the Chairman would convene on 
November 29, 2021 (later moved to December 
8, 2021). In doing so, Chairman THOMPSON re-
iterated that Mr. Meadows may object to 
specific questions that he believes raise 
privilege concerns so that he and the Select 
Committee could engage in further discus-
sions about his privilege arguments. In clos-
ing, Chairman THOMPSON indicated that the 
Select Committee would ‘‘defer consider-
ation of enforcement steps regarding Mr. 
Meadows’s non-compliance with the Select 
Committee’s subpoena pending the Novem-
ber 26 production of documents and Novem-
ber 29 deposition.’’ 
Mr. Terwilliger responded to Chairman 
THOMPSON’s letter by two separate letters 
dated November 26, 2021. In his first letter, 
Mr. Meadows, through counsel, specifically 
agreed to appear for a ‘‘deposition to answer 
questions on what you believe to be non- 
privileged matters’’ subject to certain pro-
posed conditions. In his separate letter, Mr. 
Michael Francisco, another attorney rep-
resenting Mr. Meadows, explained that Mr. 
Meadows was making an ‘‘initial’’ document 
production of 1,139 documents responsive to 
the Select Committee’s subpoena that were 
found in Mr. Meadows’s personal Gmail ac-
count and that counsel was reviewing infor-
mation from Mr. Meadows‘s personal cell 
phone, which Mr. Meadows ‘‘did not retain . 
. . after January 2021.’’ Mr. Francisco also 
provided a privilege log with that document 
production showing that Mr. Meadows was 
withholding hundreds more documents found 
in his personal Gmail account due to claims 
of executive, marital, and other protective 
privileges. 
On November 28, 2021, Chairman THOMPSON 
responded to counsel’s letters and indicated 
that he was willing to accommodate Mr. 
Meadows’s request for a deposition during 
the week of December 6 provided that he com-
plete his production of documents no later 
than Friday, December 3, 2021. Chairman 
THOMPSON
also explained that the Select 
Committee would ask questions of Mr. Mead-
ows relevant to the investigation and con-
sistent with Chairman THOMPSON’s previous 
letters about executive privilege. Chairman 
THOMPSON again explained his hope that Mr. 
Meadows would answer the questions posed, 
but also said that Mr. Meadows should assert 
any privileges that he believed applied on a 
question-by-question basis on the record to 
inform continued discussions. As an accom-
modation, Chairman THOMPSON also agreed 
to provide in advance of the depositions the 
documents that the Select Committee in-
tended 
to 
use 
in 
its 
questioning. Mr. 
Terwilliger agreed to the deposition format 
as explained in the November 28 letter dur-
ing a call with Select Committee staff. 
As requested by Chairman THOMPSON, on 
December 3, 2021, Mr. Francisco produced ap-
proximately 2,300 text messages obtained 
from data backed up from Mr. Meadows’s 
personal cell phone. In doing so, Mr. Fran-
cisco also produced a privilege log with the 
document 
production 
showing 
that 
Mr. 
Meadows was withholding over 1,000 more 
text messages from his personal cell phone 
due to claims of executive, marital, and 
other protective privileges. 
Then, on December 7, 2021, Mr. Terwilliger 
send a letter explaining that Mr. Meadows 
would not attend a deposition on December 
8, as he had previously agreed to do. During 
a call with Select Committee staff that same 
day, Mr. Terwilliger indicated that Mr. 
Meadows would not appear at all, even to 
discuss the documents that he had already 
provided to the Select Committee and that 
were not covered by any claim of protective 
privilege. 
To date, and despite the opportunity that 
the Select Committee gave to Mr. Meadows 
to cure his previous non-compliance with the 
Select Committee’s subpoena, Mr. Meadows 
has never appeared for a compelled or vol-
untary deposition to answer any of the Se-
lect Committee’s questions, even questions 
about the documents that Mr. Meadows has 
produced to the Select Committee. 
C. Mr. Meadows’s purported basis for non-com-
pliance is wholly without merit. 
As explained above, as part of its legisla-
tive function, Congress has the power to 
compel witnesses to testify and produce doc-
uments. An individual—whether a member of 
the public or an executive branch official—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7672 
December 14, 2021 
has a legal (and patriotic) obligation to com-
ply with a duly issued and valid congres-
sional subpoena, unless a valid and over-
riding privilege or other legal justification 
permits non-compliance. In United States v. 
Bryan, the Supreme Court stated: 
A subpoena has never been treated as an in-
vitation to a game of hare and hounds, in 
which the witness must testify only if cor-
nered at the end of the chase. If that were 
the case, then, indeed, the great power of 
testimonial compulsion, so necessary to the 
effective functioning of courts and legisla-
tures, would be a nullity. We have often 
iterated the importance of this public duty, 
which every person within the jurisdiction of 
the Government is bound to perform when 
properly summoned. 
It is important to note that the Select 
Committee 
sought 
testimony 
from 
Mr. 
Meadows on information for which there can 
be no conceivable privilege claim. Examples 
of that information are provided in this re-
port, and the non-privileged nature of some 
key information has been recognized by Mr. 
Meadows’s own production documents. The 
Select Committee has been entitled to Mr. 
Meadows’s testimony on that information, 
regardless of his claims of privilege over 
other categories of information. 
In United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 703– 
16 (1974), the Supreme Court recognized an 
implied constitutional privilege protecting 
presidential 
communications. 
The 
Court 
held though that the privilege is qualified, 
not absolute, and that it is limited to com-
munications made ‘‘in performance of [a 
President’s] responsibilities of his office and 
made in the process of shaping policies and 
making decisions.’’ Executive privilege is a 
recognized privilege that, under certain cir-
cumstances, may be invoked to bar congres-
sional inquiry into communications covered 
by the privilege. 
Mr. Meadows has refused to testify in re-
sponse to the subpoena ostensibly based on 
broad and undifferentiated assertions of var-
ious privileges, including claims of executive 
privilege purportedly asserted by former- 
President Trump. As the Select Committee 
has repeatedly pointed out to Mr. Meadows, 
his claims of testimonial immunity and ex-
ecutive 
privilege 
do 
not 
justify 
Mr. 
Meadows’s conduct with respect to the Se-
lect Committee’s subpoena. His legal posi-
tion is particularly untenable in light of the 
incumbent President’s decision to not assert 
testimonial immunity or executive privilege 
with respect to subjects on which the Select 
Committee seeks information from Mr. 
Meadows. And it is untenable in light of Mr. 
Meadows’s public descriptions of events in 
the book that he is trying to sell and during 
his numerous television appearances. 
Even if privileges were applicable to some 
aspects of Mr. Meadows’s testimony, he was 
required to appear before the Select Com-
mittee for his deposition, answer any ques-
tions concerning non-privileged information, 
and assert any such privilege on a question- 
by-question basis. After promising to appear, 
Mr. Meadows has now reversed course and re-
sumed 
his 
contemptuous 
behavior. 
Mr. 
Meadows’s conduct in response to the Select 
Committee’s subpoena constitutes a viola-
tion of the contempt of Congress statutory 
provisions. 
1. The incumbent President has declined to as-
sert claims of executive privilege and testi-
monial immunity. 
President Biden has declined to assert 
claims of executive privilege or testimonial 
immunity regarding subjects about which 
the Select Committee seeks documents and 
testimony from Mr. Meadows. That fact mat-
ters because, even if a former President at-
tempts to prevent disclosure of certain infor-
mation through assertions of executive privi-
lege, the former President’s privilege is sub-
ordinate to executive privilege determina-
tions made by the incumbent President. ‘‘[I]t 
is the new President [not his predecessor] 
who has the information and attendant duty 
of executing the laws in the light of current 
facts and circumstances,’’ and ‘‘the primary, 
if not the exclusive’’ duty of deciding when 
the need of maintaining confidentiality in 
communications ‘‘outweighs whatever public 
interest or need may reside in disclosure.’’ 
Dellums v. Powell, 561 F.2d 242, 247 (D.C. Cir. 
1977). 
Indeed, in briefings in Trump v. Thompson, 
litigation involving a lawsuit against the Se-
lect Committee and the National Archives 
and Records Administration, DOJ has ex-
plained, even more specifically, why Presi-
dent Biden’s decision controls whether infor-
mation relevant to the Select Committee’s 
investigation should be disclosed. DOJ said, 
among other things, that ‘‘[a] former Presi-
dent has no responsibility for the current 
execution of the law’’ and ‘‘[a]bsent unusual 
circumstances, allowing a former President 
to override decisions by the incumbent 
President regarding disclosure of Executive 
Branch information would be an extraor-
dinary intrusion’’ into executive branch au-
thority. 
In other words, ‘‘[a]llowing a former Presi-
dent to block disclosure of Executive Branch 
information that the incumbent President 
has determined is in the national interest to 
share with Congress would be even more 
clearly contrary to well-established prin-
ciples governing the exercise of sovereign au-
thority.’’ This is consistent with the District 
Court’s decision in the same litigation, in 
which it rejected Mr. Trump’s position and 
explained that Mr. Trump ‘‘is no longer situ-
ated to protect executive branch interests 
with the information and attendant duty of 
executing the laws in the light of current 
facts and circumstances’’ and because ‘‘he no 
longer remains subject to political checks 
against potential abuse of that power.’’ 
In his November 3 letter, Mr. Terwilliger 
stated that ‘‘it would be untenable for Mr. 
Meadows to decide unilaterally that he will 
waive privileges that not only protected his 
own work as a senior White House official 
but also protect current and future White 
House officials, who rely on executive privi-
lege in giving their best, most candid advice 
to the President.’’ Of course, Mr. Meadows 
appears to have already done that by re-
counting in his book and on national tele-
vision specific conversations and delibera-
tions he had with Mr. Trump about events 
related to the January 6th attack on the 
United States Capitol. But, even if he had 
not done all of that, he still need not worry 
about making such decisions ‘‘unilaterally’’ 
because the incumbent President has already 
declined to assert executive privilege or tes-
timonial immunity regarding subjects about 
which the Select Committee seeks informa-
tion. Mr. Meadows has known since he re-
ceived the White House’s letter on November 
11, 2021, that President Biden determined 
that ‘‘an assertion of privilege is not justi-
fied with respect to testimony and docu-
ments’’ and that President Biden ‘‘will not 
assert executive privilege with respect to 
[Mr. Meadows’] deposition testimony on 
these subjects, or any documents [Mr. Mead-
ows] may possess that bear on them relevant 
to the Select Committee’s investigation.’’ 
President Biden came to this conclusion ‘‘in 
recognition of these unique and extraor-
dinary circumstances, where Congress is in-
vestigating an effort to obstruct the lawful 
transfer of power under our Constitution.’’ 
Despite all of this, Mr. Meadows failed to ap-
pear for his deposition on November 12. When 
given the opportunity to cure his earlier con-
tempt and appear for a deposition well after 
the subpoena’s deadlines, he, once again, 
failed to do so. 
2. Mr. Trump has not formally invoked execu-
tive privilege. 
Former President Trump has had no com-
munication with the Select Committee. In 
an October 11 email to the Select Com-
mittee, Mr. Meadows’s attorney attached an 
October 6, 2021, letter from Mr. Trump’s at-
torney, Justin Clark, in which Mr. Clark 
claimed that the Select Committee subpoena 
seeks information that is ‘‘unquestionably 
protected from disclosure by the executive 
and other privileges, including among others 
the presidential communications, delibera-
tive process, and attorney-client privileges.’’ 
Mr. 
Clark 
stated 
that 
former-President 
Trump ‘‘is prepared to defend these funda-
mental privileges in court.’’ Mr. Clark also 
relayed that, ‘‘to the fullest extent per-
mitted by law, President Trump instructs 
Mr. Meadows to: (a) where appropriate, in-
voke any immunities and privileges he may 
have from compelled testimony in response 
to the Subpoena; (b) not produce any docu-
ments concerning his official duties in re-
sponse to the Subpoena; and (c) not provide 
any testimony concerning his official duties 
in response to the Subpoena.’’ But without a 
formal assertion by Mr. Trump to the Select 
Committee, Mr. Meadows cannot establish 
the foundational element of a claim of exec-
utive privilege: an invocation of the privi-
lege by the executive. 
In United States v. Reynolds, 345 U.S. 1, 7–8 
(1953), the Supreme Court held that execu-
tive privilege: 
[B]elongs to the Government and must be as-
serted by it; it can neither be claimed nor 
waived by a private party. It is not to be 
lightly invoked. There must be a formal 
claim of privilege, lodged by the head of the 
department which has control over the mat-
ter, after actual personal consideration by 
that officer. 
Here, the Select Committee has not been 
provided by Mr. Trump with any formal in-
vocation of executive privilege. There is no 
legal authority—and neither Mr. Meadows 
nor former-President Trump nor his counsel 
have cited any—holding that a vague state-
ment by someone who is not a government 
official that a former President has an inten-
tion to assert a privilege absolves a subpoena 
recipient of his duty to comply. Such indi-
rect, non-specific assertion of privilege, 
without any description of the documents or 
testimony over which privilege is claimed, is 
insufficient to activate a claim of executive 
privilege. 
3. Mr. Meadows is not entitled to absolute im-
munity. 
Mr. Meadows has refused to appear for a 
deposition based on his purported reliance on 
alleged 
absolute 
testimonial 
immunity. 
However, even if Mr. Trump had invoked ex-
ecutive privilege, and even if executive privi-
lege reached certain testimony sought by the 
Select Committee, Mr. Meadows would not 
be immune from compelled testimony before 
the Select Committee, especially given the 
fact that he is no longer a high-level White 
House official. 
All courts that have reviewed this issue 
have been clear: even senior White House 
aides who advise the President on official 
government business are not immune from 
compelled congressional process. Instead, 
Mr. Meadows acknowledges that this theory 
of immunity is based entirely on internal 
memoranda from OLC that courts, in rel-
evant parts, have uniformly rejected. Never-
theless, Mr. Meadows refused to appear at 
his deposition.

H7673 
December 14, 2021 
Moreover, by their own terms, the OLC 
opinions on which Mr. Meadows relies are 
limited, applying only to testimony ‘‘about 
[a senior official’s] official duties,’’ not testi-
mony about unofficial duties. Many of the 
topics that Chairman THOMPSON identified in 
his correspondence are unrelated to Mr. 
Meadows’s official duties and would neither 
fall under the reach of the ‘‘absolute immu-
nity’’ theory nor any privilege whatsoever. 
For instance: 
∑ Mr. Meadows was not conducting official 
and privileged business when he participated 
in a January 2021 call with campaign lawyers 
and State officials in which the participants 
urged State legislators to overturn the re-
sults of the November 2020 election and guar-
antee a second term for Mr. Trump; 
∑ Mr. Meadows was not conducting official 
and privileged business when he participated 
in another call with campaign lawyers and 
the Georgia secretary of state in which Mr. 
Trump urged the Georgia secretary of state 
to ‘‘find’’ enough votes to ensure his cam-
paign’s victory in Georgia; and 
∑ Mr. Meadows was not engaged in official 
and privileged business when he used his per-
sonal accounts and/or devices to contact the 
Georgia secretary of state or speak with pri-
vate organizers of a rally on the Ellipse that 
occurred just before the attack on the U.S. 
Capitol. 
The Select Committee specifically identi-
fied to Mr. Meadows these and other topics 
as subjects for his deposition testimony, and 
he had the legal obligation to appear before 
the Select Committee and address them on 
the record. 
Mr. Meadows’s production of documents to 
the Select Committee highlights that he has 
information relevant to the Select Commit-
tee’s inquiry that he himself acknowledges is 
not subject to any privilege. His refusal to 
provide testimony on such subjects further 
evidences willful non-compliance with the 
Select Committee’s deposition subpoena. Mr. 
Meadows produced to the Select Committee 
certain 
communications 
with 
campaign 
staff, Members of Congress, and acquaint-
ances that do not involve official business, 
while withholding others that presumably do 
involve official business because of ‘‘execu-
tive privilege.’’ In doing so, Mr. Meadows has 
clearly acknowledged that he has relevant 
information that is not related to his official 
conduct. And because the relevant informa-
tion that he has is not related to his official 
conduct, Mr. Meadows cannot avoid a deposi-
tion in which he would be asked questions 
about those documents by invoking an OLC 
opinion that is limited to testimony about 
‘‘official duties.’’ 
4. Even if Mr. Trump had properly invoked 
executive privilege and Mr. Meadows had 
properly asserted it, the privilege would 
not bar the Select Committee from obtain-
ing evidence from Mr. Meadows. 
The law is clear that executive privilege 
does not extend to discussions relating to 
non-governmental business or among private 
citizens. In In re Sealed Case (Espy), 121 F.3d 
729, 752 (D.C. Cir. 1997), the court explained 
that the presidential communications privi-
lege covers ‘‘communications authored or so-
licited and received by those members of an 
immediate White House adviser’s staff who 
have broad and significant responsibility for 
investigating and formulating the advice to 
be given the President on the particular 
matter to which the communications re-
late.’’ The court stressed that the privilege 
only applies to communications intended to 
advise the President ‘‘on official government 
matters.’’ 
As noted above, the Select Committee 
seeks information from Mr. Meadows on a 
wide range of subjects that executive privi-
lege cannot conceivably reach. For example, 
the Select Committee seeks information 
from Mr. Meadows about his interactions 
with private citizens, Members of Congress, 
or others outside the White House related to 
the 2020 election or efforts to overturn its re-
sults. Mr. Meadows has repeatedly refused to 
answer any questions about these matters. 
He has even refused to answer questions 
about the documents that he himself pro-
duced to the Select Committee without any 
assertions of privilege. 
Even with respect to Select Committee in-
quiries that involve Mr. Meadows’s direct 
communications with Mr. Trump, executive 
privilege does not bar Select Committee ac-
cess to that information. Only communica-
tions that relate to official government busi-
ness can be covered by the presidential com-
munications privilege. Here, Mr. Meadows’s 
conduct regarding several subjects of con-
cern to the Select Committee is not related 
to official government business, such as: 
Meadows’s participation in calls and meet-
ings that clearly concerned Mr. Trump’s 
campaign rather that his official duties; or, 
Mr. Meadows’s participation in meetings 
with Mr. Trump and private individuals 
about seizing voting machines or taking 
other steps related to the election that could 
reportedly, in Mr. Trump’s words, ‘‘offer[] 
me a chance’’; or, Mr. Meadows’s contacts 
with organizers of the January 6th rally on 
the Ellipse. 
Moreover, even with respect to any sub-
jects of concern that arguably involve offi-
cial government business, the Select Com-
mittee’s need for this information to inves-
tigate the facts and circumstances sur-
rounding the horrific January 6 assault on 
the U.S. Capitol and the Nation’s democratic 
institutions far outweighs any possible exec-
utive branch interest at this point in main-
taining confidentiality. As noted by the ex-
ecutive, ‘‘the constitutional protections of 
executive privilege should not be used to 
shield information reflecting an effort to 
subvert the Constitution itself, and indeed 
[the President] believes that such an asser-
tion in this circumstance would be at odds 
with the principles that underlie the privi-
lege.’’ 
Finally, when explaining his claim of privi-
lege to the Select Committee, Mr. Meadows 
has suggested that he has no choice but to 
avoid testifying because, as White House 
chief of staff, he had ‘‘assumed responsibility 
to protect Executive Privilege during and 
after his tenure,’’ and that he had ‘‘assumed 
that responsibility not for his own benefit 
but for the benefit of all those who will serve 
after him, including future presidents.’’ He 
included in a separate letter a passage about 
the importance of executive branch confiden-
tiality to ‘‘ensure that the President can ob-
tain . . . sound and candid advice.’’ Those 
words are belied by Mr. Meadows’s conduct. 
To be sure, the Supreme Court has made 
clear that executive privilege is rooted in 
the need for confidentiality to ensure that 
presidential decision-making is informed by 
honest advice and full knowledge: ‘‘[h]uman 
experience teaches that those who expect 
public dissemination of their remarks may 
well temper candor with a concern for ap-
pearances and for their own interests to the 
detriment of the decision-making process.’’ 
In Nixon v. GSA, the Supreme Court again 
considered issues related to executive privi-
lege and balanced the important interests 
served by the Presidential Records Act 
against the intrusion into presidential con-
fidentiality caused by compliance with the 
Act. Thus, a valid claim of executive privi-
lege presumes that the information sought 
to discovered is confidential and that the 
need to maintain that confidentiality out-
weighs the interests promoted by disclosure. 
Here, however, executive privilege and the 
need to maintain confidentiality is severely 
undermined, if not entirely vitiated, by Mr. 
Meadows’s own extensive public disclosure of 
his communications with the former Presi-
dent, including on issues directly implicated 
by the Select Committee’s subpoena. Mr. 
Meadows has appeared on national television 
discussing the January 6th attack on the 
U.S. Capitol and related conversations with 
former-President Trump. And he has written 
about what former-President Trump told 
him on January 6th in his newly released 
book. Mr. Meadows’s conduct relating to the 
very subjects of interest to the Select Com-
mittee foreclose a claim of executive privi-
lege with respect to those disclosures. More-
over, Mr. Meadows’s statements to the Se-
lect Committee about his professed need to 
protect presidential confidentiality rings 
hollow in the face of his cavalier and re-
peated disclosure of presidential communica-
tions in circumstances where doing so ap-
pears to suit his personal or political inter-
ests. Mr. Meadows has shown his willingness 
to talk about issues related to the Select 
Committee’s investigation across a variety 
of media platforms—anywhere, it seems, ex-
cept to the Select Committee. 
For 
the 
reasons 
stated 
above, 
Mr. 
Meadows’s own conduct and the determina-
tion by the current executive overrides any 
claim by Mr. Trump (even assuming Mr. 
Trump had invoked executive privilege with 
respect to Mr. Meadows). Furthermore, Mr. 
Meadows has refused Chairman THOMPSON’s 
numerous invitations to assert executive 
privilege on a question-by-question basis, 
making it impossible for the Select Com-
mittee to consider any good-faith executive 
privilege assertions. And, as discussed above, 
such concerns are wholly inapplicable to the 
broad range of subjects about which the Se-
lect Committee seeks Mr. Meadows’s testi-
mony that Mr. Meadows has acknowledged 
involve non-privileged matters. 
D. Precedent supports the Select Committee’s 
position to proceed with holding Mr. Mead-
ows in contempt. 
An individual who fails or refuses to com-
ply with a House subpoena may be cited for 
contempt of Congress. Pursuant to 2 U.S.C. § 
192, the willful refusal to comply with a con-
gressional subpoena is punishable by a fine 
of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 
1 year. In Quinn v. United States, the Supreme 
Court said that ‘‘Section 192, like the ordi-
nary federal criminal statute, requires a 
criminal intent—in this instance, a delib-
erate, intentional refusal to answer.’’ And 
proving criminal intent in this context is no 
more than showing a ‘‘deliberate’’ ‘‘refusal 
to answer pertinent questions’’; it does not 
require a showing of ‘‘moral turpitude.’’ A 
committee may vote to seek a contempt ci-
tation against a recalcitrant witness. This 
action is then reported to the House. If a res-
olution to that end is adopted by the House, 
the matter is referred to a U.S. Attorney, 
who has a duty to refer the matter to a 
grand jury for an indictment. 
Mr. Meadows has previously recognized the 
importance of congressional access to infor-
mation from executive branch officials to ad-
vance congressional investigations. As a 
Representative in Congress, he served as 
ranking member of the House Committee on 
Oversight and Reform. In that position, he 
expected that even senior executive branch 
officials such as the Deputy Attorney Gen-
eral comply with Congress’s subpoenas. In-
deed, such an expectation is consistent with 
precedent spanning Republican and Demo-
cratic administrations under which top 
White House aides have provided testimony 
to Congress. Further, his recent assertion to 
the Select Committee that he ‘‘cannot be

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7674 
December 14, 2021 
compelled to provide congressional testi-
mony’’ as a former White House chief of staff 
runs directly counter to precedent under 
which top White House aides have provided 
testimony to Congress under subpoena. For 
example, former White House Chief of Staff 
John Podesta and former White House Coun-
sel Beth Nolan testified in 2001 under sub-
poena regarding President Clinton’s pardons 
before the House Committee on Government 
Reform. 
Mr. Meadows did not need to be informed 
of his responsibility to comply with the Se-
lect Committee’s subpoena, but Chairman 
THOMPSON informed him anyway. In his No-
vember 11, 2021, letter to Mr. Meadows’s 
counsel, Chairman THOMPSON
advised Mr. 
Meadows that his claims of executive privi-
lege were not well-founded and did not ab-
solve him of his obligation to produce docu-
ments and appear for deposition testimony. 
The Chairman made clear that the Select 
Committee expected Mr. Meadows to appear 
for his scheduled deposition on November 
12th and produce the requested documents at 
that time. The Chairman warned Mr. Mead-
ows 
that 
his 
continued 
non-compliance 
would put him in jeopardy of a vote to refer 
him to the House to consider a criminal con-
tempt referral. Mr. Meadows did not produce 
documents and did not show up for his depo-
sition. And, when given the opportunity to 
cure his earlier contempt, Mr. Meadows pro-
duced documents but still chose to withhold 
testimony. Mr. Meadows’s failure to appear 
for deposition testimony in the face of this 
clear advisement and warning by the Chair-
man, and after being given a second chance 
to cooperate with the Select Committee, 
constitutes a willful failure to comply with 
the subpoena.

cember 13, 2021, with a quorum being present,

SELECT COMMITTEE OVERSIGHT FINDINGS 
In compliance with clause 3(c)(1) of rule 
XIII, the Select Committee advises that the 
oversight findings and recommendations of 
the Select Committee are incorporated in 
the descriptive portions of this Report. 
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE ESTIMATE 
The Select Committee finds the require-
ments of clause 3(c)(2) of rule XIII and sec-
tion 308(a) of the Congressional Budget Act 
of 1974, and the requirements of clause 3(c)(3) 
of rule XIII and section 402 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974, to be inapplicable 
to this Report. Accordingly, the Select Com-
mittee did not request or receive a cost esti-
mate from the Congressional Budget Office 
and makes no findings as to the budgetary 
impacts of this Report or costs incurred to 
carry out the Report. 
STATEMENT OF GENERAL PERFORMANCE GOALS 
AND OBJECTIVES 
Pursuant to clause 3(c)(4) of rule XIII, the 
objective of this Report is to enforce the Se-
lect Committee’s authority to investigate 
the facts, circumstances, and causes of the 
January 6th attack and issues relating to the 
peaceful transfer of power, in order to iden-
tify and evaluate problems and to rec-
ommend corrective laws, policies, proce-
dures, rules, or regulations; and to enforce 
the Select Committee’s subpoena authority 
found in section 5(c)(4) of House Resolution 
503.

record. 
Today is November 12th, 2021, the 
time is 10 a.m., and we are convened in 
* * * * for the deposition of Mark Mead-
ows to be conducted by the House Se-
lect Committee to Investigate the Jan-
uary 6th Attack on the United States 
Capitol. 
My name is * * * *. I am the des-
ignated select committee staff counsel 
for this proceeding. I’m accompanied 
by * * * *, deputy staff director and 
chief counsel to the select committee; 
* * * *, select committee staff counsel; 
* * * *, select committee staff counsel; 
* * * *, select committee parliamen-
tarian. 
And joining us virtually is * * * * and 
* * * *, who are select committee staff, 
as well as chief clerk to the select com-
mittee, * * * *. 
For the record, it is now 10:01 a.m., 
and Mr. Meadows is not present. The 
person transcribing this proceeding is 
the House stenographer and notary 
public authorized to administer oaths. 
On September 23rd, 2021, Chairman 
Bennie THOMPSON issued a subpoena to 
Mr. Meadows, both to produce docu-
ments by October 7th, 2021, and to tes-
tify at a deposition on October 15th of 
2021 at 10 a.m. 
The subpoena is in connection with 
the select committees investigation 
into the facts, circumstances, and 
causes of the January 6th attack and 
issues relating to the peaceful transfer 
of power in order to identify and evalu-
ate lessons learned and to recommend 
to the House and its relevant commit-
tees corrective laws, policies, proce-
dures, rules, or regulations. 
After Mr. Meadows retained counsel, 
who is George Terwilliger, III, the se-
lect committee agreed to postpone the 
subpoena deadlines to enable his coun-
sel to understand the requests associ-
ated with the subpoena and work with 
Mr. Meadows. 
Ultimately, by letter dated October 
25th, 2021, the select committee set new 
deadlines to produce documents and 
appear for testimony. Mr. Meadows was 
required to produce documents by No-
vember 5th, 2021, and appear for testi-
mony on November 12th, 2021. 
By letters dated between October 
25th and November 11th, the select 
committee engaged with counsel for 
Mr. Meadows. In the letters, the select 
committee addressed Mr. Meadows’ 
claims of, among other things, absolute 
testimonial immunity and executive 
privilege. 
In the letters, the select committee 
also instructed Mr. Meadows to assert 
his privilege claims in a privilege log 
for responsive documents and on a 
question by question basis at the depo-
sition. 
On November 10th, 2021, Mr. Mead-
ows, through counsel, informed the se-
lect committee that he would not ap-
pear at today’s deposition citing testi-
monial immunity and privileges. Spe-
cifically, counsel said that, quote, ‘‘Mr. 
Meadows cannot agree to appear at 10 
a.m. Friday,’’ end quote. 
Following that letter, the White 
House Counsel’s Office sent counsel for 
Mr. Meadows a letter dated November 
11th, indicating that the White House 
would not assert claims of testimonial 
immunity or executive privilege to pre-
vent Mr. Meadows’ testimony before 
the select committee. 
Specifically, the letter states that 
President Biden, quote, ‘‘will not as-
sert executive privilege with respect to 
your client’s deposition testimony on 
these subjects, or any documents your 
client may possess that bear on them. 
For the same reasons underlying his 
decision on executive privilege, Presi-
dent Biden has determined that he will 
not assert immunity to preclude your 
client from testifying before the Select 
Committee,’’ end quote. 
The select committee then sent coun-
sel for Mr. Meadows a final letter in 
light of the White House Counsel’s Of-
fice’s stated position. To date, the se-
lect committee has not received a re-
sponse. 
In the letters, the select committee 
informed Mr. Meadows, quote, ‘‘the Se-
lect Committee will view Mr. Meadows’ 
failure to respond to the subpoena as 
willful non compliance. Such willful 
non compliance with the subpoena 
would force the Select Committee to 
consider invoking the contempt of Con-
gress procedures in 2 U.S.C., sections 
192 and section 194—which could result 
in a referral from the House to the De-
partment 
of 
Justice 
for 
criminal 
charges—as well as the possibility of 
having a civil action to enforce the 
subpoena brought against Mr. Meadows 
in his personal capacity,’’ end quote. 
Mr. Meadows has not provided any 
documents or a privilege log, and Mr. 
Meadows has not appeared today to an-
swer questions or assert privilege ob-
jections. 
I will mark as exhibit 1 and enter 
into the record the select committee’s 
subpoena to Mr. Meadows, included 
with which are the materials that ac-
companied the subpoena; namely, a let-
ter from the chairman, a document 
schedule with accompanying produc-
tion instructions, and a copy of the 
deposition rules.

Dear Mr. Meadows: 
September 23, 2021 
Pursuant lo the authorities set forth in House Rcsoltttion 503 and the rules of the House of 
Representativcs1 the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
("Select Committee") hereby transmits a subpoena that compels you to produce the documents set forth in the 
accompanying schedule by October 7, 2021, ahd to appear for a deposition on October 15, 2021. 
The Select Committee is investigating the facts, circumstances, and causes of the January 6th attack and 
issues relating to the peaceful transfer of power, iu order to identify and evaluate lessons learned and to 
recommend to the House and its relevant committees corrective laws, policies, procedures, rules, or regulations. 
The inquiry includes examination of how various individuals and entities coordinated their activities leading up 
to the events of January 6, 2021. 
· 
The investigation has revealed credible evidence of your involvement in events within the scope of the 
Select Coounittee's inquiry. You were the President's Chief of Staff and have critical infonnation regarding 
many elements of our inquiry, It appears that you were with or in the vicinity of President Trump on January 61 
had communications with the President and others on January 6 regarding events at the Capitol, and are a 
witness regarding activities of that day. Moreover, it has been reported that you were engaged in multiple 
elements of the plruming and preparation of efforts to contest the presidential election and delay the counting of 
electoral votes. In addition, according to documents provided by the Department of Justice, while you were the 
President's Chief of Staff. you directly communicated with the highest officials at the Department of Justice 
requesting investigations into election frattd matters in several states.J We understand that in the weeks after the 
November 2020 election, you contacted several state officials to encourage investigation of allegations of 
election fraud, even after such allegations had been dismissed by state and fed~ral courts, and after the Electoral 
College had met and voted on December 14, 2020.2 Moreover, at least one press report indicates you were in 
communication with organizers of the January 6 rally. including Amy Kremer of Women for America First.3

Re:

Dear Chair Thompson and Vice Chait Cheney: 
Please be advised that I have been retained to serve as counsel to Mr. Meadows in connection 
with lhe Jimuary 6th Select Committee's investigation and specifically, Committee subpoenas 
served on Mr. Meadows. 
Inasm1.tch as I was retained yesterday in this matter, please understand that my opportunity to, on 
behalf of my client, begin our cooperation with your investigation has been extremely limited. 
Nonetheless, I can inform the Committee of the following in response to the subpoena for 
production of documents with n return date of October 7, 2021. We believe that any documents 
responsive to that subpoena w01.1ld not be in Mr. Meadows porsonal care, custody or control, but 
rather would be in the possession of the Archivist of the United States pursuant to the 
Presidential Records Act of 1978t M U.S.C. §§ 2201-2207. Despite that belief, we are 
undertaking due diligence to ascertain whether Mr. Meadows is in personal possession of any 
responsive documents a11d will report further to the Committee in that regard as soon as we have 
any pertinent and/or definitive info1mation. 
As to the subpoena for testimony with a retum date of October 15, 2021, I anticipate being in 
touch forthwith with the Committee's investigative staff in that regard.

RE: Subpoenas Served on Honorable Mark R. Meadows 
• 
Thank you for speaking yesterday about the Select Committee's subpoena to Mr. Meadows. Consistent with 
your request, I wanted to get back to you promptly about the October 15th return date for testimony. 
As you know we are facing the potential for conflicting directions from former President Trump and President 
Biden as to preservation of prlvlleges concerning senior presidential advisors and communication by same in 
that tole. We are now scheduled to discuss privilege issues with the White Counsel's office on Thursday, most 
likely ln the afternoon. 
In addition, after considering the topics you outlined yesterday, it is not clear to us that, in whole or part, 
relevant privileges would not attach to Mr. Meadows testimony as to those subject matters. We are, however, 
going to consider further those subject matters and may be able to proffer Information concerning knowledge 
or lack of knowledge as to aspects of some of those subjects that you may want to consider in deciding if further 
pursuing testimony from Mr. Meadows as to such matters would be productive, privilege considerations 
notwithstanding. 
Thus, I am not currently !n a position to either confirm that Mr. Meadows can testify or; to state at this point that 
he cannot do so. What Is clear, though, fs that as a practical matter, I could not advise him under these 
circumstances to commit to testifying on October 15, 
Also, at this point we have asked the White House Counsel for access to documents that may be relevant to Mr. 
Meadows potential testimony that have been released to the Committee by the Archivist per Instructions of the 
White House Counsel. Sf nee Mr. Meadows has not been consulted about any such production of potentially 
privlleged documents arising from his tenure as the former President's Chief of Staff, we are unaware If any 
have actually been produced. I would respectfully extend our request for access to any such documents to the 
Committee as well. As you know so well, the testimony of any witness would be far more productive if afforded, 
as per standard practice, access to documents relevant to the witness's testimony, 
We are, of course, during our utmost to properly respect the Select Committee's subpoena and working 
diligently to address the various issues it raises. 
We will continue to give this matter prompt and close attention and appreciate your willingness to work with us. 
Regards, 
George Terwilliger 
Counsel for Mr. Meadows

Counsel to the President 
The White House 
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW 
Washington, DC 20500 
Re: 
Congressional Subpoena to Fonner White House Chief of Staff Mark R. Meadows 
Dear Ms. Remus: 
I write on behalf of my client, Mark R. Meadows, regarding a subpoena he recently received :fron1 
the Select Committee to ihe Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United Stales Capitol of the 
U.S. House of Representatives. While now a private citizen, Mr. Meadows served as White House 
Chief of Staff under Pl'esidcnt Donald J. Trump during the period that is the focus of the Select 
Committee's investigaLion. I \VI'ite now because, as detailed below, I>rcsidents' and Presidential 
Administrations of both parties have long maintained the position that Congress cannot compel 
senior advisors to the President to testify or to prodt1ce records of their communications with and 
on behalf of the President. The Select Committee's subpoena to Mr. Meadows threatens these 
important principles which safeguard the separation of powers enshrined in the U.S. Constitution • 
. 
The Select Committee's subpoena,. which Mr. Meadows received on September 23, 2021, seeks 
both records and testimony regarding Mr. Meadows•s tenure as White House Chief of Staff, 
including his communications with the President of the United States and other senior Executive 
Branch officials. A copy of the subpoena is attached. Mr. Meadows also received a letter, through 
counsel, on October 6, 2021, from an attomey for President Trump regarding the subpoena. A 
copy of the letter is attached as well. 
Mr. Meadows has profound respect both for the Congress and for the Presidency as integral parts 
of the Federal Government established under the U.S. Constitution. He served four te1ms iu the 
U.S., House of Representatives, representing North Camlina's 11th District, before serving as 
White House Chief of Staff. He is committed both to fulfilling his legal obligations and to 
protecting the balance of' power that underpins om· American system of government.

I am therefore writing io you in hopes of clarifying information we have seen in public reports 
regarding President Biden,s position on the Select Committee's stibpoenas (which include 
subpoenas to other individuals from both inside and outside the Executive Branch) and to request 
the opportunity to discuss these important matters with you. 
Executive Branch Precedent 
As you know, Presidential Administrations of both parties have consistently maintained that 
privileged communications within the Executive Branch are immune from congressional 
subpoena. See, e.g., Assertion of Executive Privilege Over Deliberative Materials Regarding 
Inclusion of Citizenship Question on 2020 Census Questionnaire, O.L.C. slip. op. (June 11, 2019) 
(Atty. Gen. William P. Barr); Assertion of Executive Privilege Over Documents Generated in 
Response to Congressional Investigation into Operation Fast and Furious, 36 Op. O.L.C. 1 (2012) 
(Atty. Gen. Eric H. Holder, Jr.); Assertion of Executive Privilege Concerning Special Counsel's 
Interviews of the Vice President and Senior White House Staff, 32 Op. O.L.C. 7 (2008) (Atty. Gen. 
Michael B. Mukasey); Assertion of Executive Privilege Regarding White House Counsel's Office 
Documents, 20 Op. O.L.C. 2 (1996) (Atty. Gen. Janet Reno). Among other things, this position 
guards against "the chilling effect that compliance with [a congressional] subpoena would have on 
future White House deliberations." 32 Op. O.L.C. at 13. 
Considering this longstanding, bi-partisan tradition and its importance to the effective functioning 
of the Executive Branch, we were surprised to hear reports that you had directed the production of 
privileged White House documents without consulting the officials from whom they originated. 
Of course, mistaken media reports would not be unprecedented. We also understand that not all 
recipients of the Select Committee's subpoenas may be.similarly situated to Mr. Meadows. We 
therefore respectfully ask for you to clarify whether you have directed the Archivist to produce 
privileged materials arising from Mr. Meadows' tenure as Chief of Staff to Congress, and if so, to 
clarify the scope of that directive, We also ask that, at an appropriate time and subject to 
appropriate conditions, you make any such production available to Mr. Meadows and to us as his 
counsel for the limited purpose of responding to the Select Committee's subpoena, 
Document Production 
In response to the subpoena, we informed the Select Committee on October 7, 2021, of our belief 
that all the potentially responsive records from Mr. Meadows' tenure as Chief of Staff would be 
in the custody and control of the Archivist of the United States, consistent with the Presidential 
Records Act of 1978, 44 U.S.C. §§ 2201-07. We also expressed our intention to take appropriate 
steps to confirm that belief. On October 8, 2021, multiple media outlets reported that you had 
already instmcted the Archivist of the United States to produce responsive materials to the Select

Committee without any withholding or redaction based on executive privilege.1 Mr. Meadows 
recognizes that, as a public servant} he created records belonging to the United States and not to 
him personally. He asserts no personal. stake in the disposition of these records. Bnt as former 
White House Chief of Staff, he also wants to ensure that the institution of the Presidency is 
protected and that the long-standing traditions which protect its operations are not traded away for 
political expediency. 
Testimony 
Aside from its request for documents, the Select Committee has also sought to compel testimony 
from Mr. Meadows. We believe that, consistent with Executive Branch practice, Mr. Meadows is 
immune from being compelled to testify before Congress regarding his service as White House 
Chief of Staff. 
Long-standing Executive Branch tradition recognizes that senior White House officials enjoy an 
absolute immunity from compelled testimony before Congress. See Memorandum for All Heads 
of Offices, Divisions, Bureaus and Boards of the Department of Justice, from John M. Harmon, 
Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Executive Privilege at 5 (May 
23, 1977); Memorandum for John D. Ehrlichman, Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs, 
from William H. Rehnquist, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, Re: Power of 
Congressional Committee to Compel Appearance or Testimony of "White House Staff' (Feb. 5, 
1971). This immunity continues to apply even after senior officials leave the White House. See, 
e.g., Testimonial Immunity Before Congress of the Former Counsel to the President, O.L.C. slip 
op., at *2 (May 20, 2019) ("Testimonial Immunity Before Congress"); Immunity of the Former 
Counsel to the President from Compelled Congressional Testimony, 31 Op. O.L.C. 191, 192 
(2007). Testimonial immunity is also "distinct from, and broader than, executive privilege" in that 
it "extends beyond answers to particular questions, precluding Congress from compelling even the 
appearance of a senior presidential adviser-as a function of the independence and autonomy of 
the President himself." Testimonial Immunity Before Congress, O.L.C. slip op. at *4. 
Notwithstanding the public reports about the Select Committee's document requests, we have no 
reason to believe that President Biden has purported to waive testimonial immunity for Mr. 
Meadows in connection with the Select Committee's subpoena. In the attached letter, former 
President Trump expressed his view that "Mr. Meadows is immune from compelled testimony on 
matters related to his official responsibilities." Ex. B (citing Testimonial Immunity Before 
Congress, O.L.C. slip op.). There are good reasons to preserve that immunity for the White House 
Chief of Staff, even if a decision has already been made to produce some otherwise privileged 
documents.

The testimonial pl'ivilege vindicates the constitutional separation of powers. The President, as the 
head of a co-equal branch of government, stands on equal constitutional footing with the Congress. 
For Congress to compel an immediate Presidential advisor-who serves as "an extensmn of tho 
President''-''to appear and testify would 'promote a perception that the President is subordinate 
to Congress, contrary to the Constitution, s separation of governmental powers into equal and 
coordinate branches."' Testimonial Immunity Bq/ore Congresst O.L.C. slip op. at *4 (quoting 
Immunity of the As.Yistant to the President and Director of the Office of Political St1·ategy and 
Outreach/ram CongressfonalSubpoena, 38 Op. O.L.C. 5, 8 (2014) ("ImmunttyqftheAssistantto 
the President"). 
The tes'llmonial privilege also protects the prerogative of current and future White House of:ficia]s 
to provide tho President with the frank and candid advice required to discharge faithfully the duties 
of the offico. The Office of Legal Counsel emphasized this point in 2014 to explain why David 
Simas, Assistant to President Obama, was not required to testify h1 response to a subpoc11a from 
the House Committee on Oversight and Govemmont Reform: 
[Al congressional power to subpoena the President's closest advisers to testify 
about matters that occur during the co1U'Se of discharging their official duties would 
threaten Executive Branch confidentiality, which is necessary (among other things) 
to ensure that the President can obtain the type of sound and candid advice that is 
essential to tho effective discharge of his constitutional duties. 
Immunity of the A,,;sistant to the President, 38 Op. O.L.C, at 8. Thal office noted the Supreme 
Court's recognition in United States v. Nix.on, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), of"'thenecessity for protection

We recognize that Congress has placed immense political pressure on the White House to waive 
executive privilege in connection with the Select Committeets invQstigation, and that the 
AcbninistTation has already chosen to do so in 8ome circumstances. It is precisely when the 
political pressure is at its strongest that the longstanding safeguards of the separation of powers 
become most important. 
We l'espe.ctfu.lly requesl an opport11nity to discuss these matters with you before any decision is 
made that would purport to require Mr. Meadows to act contrary to Executive Branch precedent.

Dear Mr. Gasl: 
ELECTIONS, LLC 
October 6; 2021 
Attorneys at Law 
Justin R, Clark 
I write in refere11ce to a subpoena, dated September 23, 2021, by the Select Committee to 
Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United Stnte.i, Capitol (the ~'Select Committee"), that was 
issued ta your client Mark R. Meadows (the "Subpoena"), The Subpoena requests that Mr. 
Meadows produce documents by October 7, 2021, and appear fore deposition on October 15, 
2021. While it is obvious that the Solcot Committee's obsession with Prcsidonl Trump is merely 
a partisan attempt to distracl from the disastrous Biden administration (e.g.> the emhnrra.i;sing 
withdrawal from Afghanistun1 the oveiwhelming flood of illegal immigrants crossing our southern 
border, and growing inflation), President Trump vigorously objects to the overbreadth and scope 
of these requests and· believes they are a tbreat to the institution of the Presidency and the 
independence of the Executive Branch. 
Through the Subpoena, the Select Committee seeks records a11d testimony purportedly related to 
the evenl..'l of Junuary 6th, 2021, including but not limited to information which is ur1quostionaoly 
protected from disclosure by the executive and other privileges, including among others the 
presidential communications, deliberative process, and attorney-client privileges. 
President 
Tmmp is prepared to defend these fundamental privileges in court. Furthermol'e, President Trump 
believes that Mr. Meadows is immune from compelled congressional testimony on matters related 
to his official responsibilities. See Testimonial Immunity Before Congress of the Fonner Counsel 
to the Presi'dent, 43 Op. O.L.C. (May 20, 2019), available at https://www \justice.gov/olo/opinions~ 
main. 
Therefore, to the fullest extent pennitted by law, President Trump-instructs .Mr. Meadows to: 
(a) where appropriate, invoke any immunities and privileges he may have from compelled 
testimony in response to tho Subpoena; (b} not produce any docmncnts concerning his official 
duties 111 response lo the Subpoena; and ( c) not provide any testimony concerning his official duties 
in response to the Subpoena.

Mr. George Terwilliger III 
McGuire Woods LLP 
Dear Mr. Tcnvilliger, 
October 25, 2021 
The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack ("Select Committee") is in 
receipt of your October 7, 2021 t letter and your October 13, 2021, email and attached documents 
(the "correspondence") regarding the September 23, 2021, subpo~na for documents and 
testimony served on your client Mark R Meadows (the Hsubpocna
11). The Select ConuniLtcc is 
also in receipt of your October 11, 2021, letter addressed to Counsel to the President Dana A. 
Remus (the "letter to the White House''). You have also had calls with Select Committee staff 
about the subpoena, the most recent of which occurred on October 20, 2021. Based on the 
corrcsponde11cc, the letter to the White House, and calls, I understand that Mr. Meadows believes 
that, as a fo1mcr advisor to President Donald Trump, he may be immune from testifying before 
the Select Committee. In addition, I understand that Mr. Meadows believes that, even ifhe is not 
immune from testifying, his testimony may nonetheless be covered by a claim of executive 
privilege. 
Mr. Scott Gast accepted service of the subpoena on Mr. Meadows's behalf on September 
23, 2021. The subpoena demanded that Mr. Meadows produce documents by October 7 and 
appear for testimony by October 15. The requested documents and testimony relate directly to 
the inquiry being conducted by the Select Committee, serve a legitimate legislative purpose, and 
are within the scope of the authority expressly delegated to the Select Committee pursuant to 
House Resolution 503. In the letter accompanying the subpoena, the Select Committee set forth 
the basis for its detem1hmtion that tho documents and records sought by the subpoena and Mr. 
Meadows' s deposition testimony are of critical importance to the issues being investigated by the 
Select Committee. 
Your correspondence to the Select Committee, calls, and letter to the White House have 
suggested Mr. Meadows•s belief in the potential existence of testimonial and subject-matter 
privileges. No si1ch blanket testimonial immunity exists, and the Select Committee does not 
believe that executive privileges bar the Select Committee from legally obtaining any aspects of 
Mr. Meadows's deposition testimony.

Mr. George TeIWilliger 111 
Page2 
First, the Select Committee has not received any assertion, formal or otherwise, of any 
privilege from ex-President Trump with respect to Mr. Meadows's production of documents or 
appearance to provide testimony. l Even assuming that, as a former President, Mr. Trump is 
permitted to formally invoke executive privilege, he has not done so. The Select Committee is 
not aware of any legal authority, and your letter cites none, holding that a vague statement by 
somebody who is not a government official that an ex-President has an intention to assert a 
privilege absolves a subpoena recipient of his duty to comply, 
Second, your correspondence, communications with Select Committee staff, and letter to 
the White House indicate that Mr. Trump "believes that Mr. Meadows is immune from 
compelled congressional testimony on matters related to his official responsibilities.,, Even 
setting aside the fact that the Select Committee is interested in questioning Mr. Meadows, in part, 
about actions that cannot be considered part of his ''official responsibilities," Mr. Meadows is not 
permitted by law to assert the type of blanket testimonial immunity that Mr. Trump and your 
letter to the White House suggest. To the contrary, every court that has considered the absolute 
immunity Mr. Trump alludes to has rejected it. See, e.g., Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 
(1982); Comm. on the Judiciary v. Miers, 558 F. Supp. 2d 53, 106 (D.D.C. 2008) (rejecting 
former White House counsel's assertion of absolute immunity from compelled congressional 
process), Those cases make clear that even the most senior presidential advisors may not resist a 
congressional subpoena ''based solely on their proximity to the President." Miers at 101 ( citing 
Harlow, 457 U.S. at 810).2 And; although your letter to the White House cites several 
Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel ("OLC") opinions in which OLC insists that such 
immunity exists even after Miers, yet another judge has forcefully rejected that position after 
OLC ,s last memorandum opinion addressing absolute immunity. See Comm. on Judiciary v. 
McGahn, 415 F. Supp. 3d 148 (D.D.C. 2019) ("To make the point as plain as possible, it is clear 
to this Court ... that, with respect to senior-level presidential aides, absolute immunity from 
compelled congressional process simply does not exist. 'l 
Third, your correspondence, communications with Select Committee staff, and letter to 
the White House indicate that Mr. Meadows also believes that his potential testimony would be 
protected as privileged communications within the executive branch. That is not the case. 
Executive privilege is a qualified privilege-not an absolute one-that may be invoked to 
prevent disclosure of communications with the President related to his official responsibilities, as 
well as deliberations about official responsibilities within the executive branch. With respect to 
Mr. Meadows, I understand that Select Committee staff has already discussed with you a non ft 
exhaustive list of deposition topics that fall outside of any executiveftpdvilege claim, including: 
1 By civil complaint filed on October 19, 2021, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Mr. 
Trump has formally alleged that executive privileges should prevent the National Archives from producing Mr. 
Trump's White Bouse documents to the Select Committee. That lawsuit does not formally assert any privilege with 
respect to Mr. Meadows and does not seek any relief related to the subpoena served on Mr. Meadows. 
2 It is also worth noting that the cotut mMiers reJected the former White House Coimsel's claim of absolute 
immunity fl.om congressional testimony even though the sitting President had formally invoked executive privilege. 
Id. at 62.

communications and meetings involving people who did not work for the United States 
government; communications and meetings with members of Congress; Mr. Meadows' s 
campaign-related activities; communications and meetings about topics for which the 
Department of Justice and the White House have expressly dechned to assert executive privilege; 
and, topics about which Mr. Meadows has already spoken publicly. Mr. Meadows must comply 
with the subpoena to answer questions about those and other issues, and his apparent reliance on 
a categorial claim of executive privilege runs afoul of long-standing caselaw requiring that any 
claim of executive privilege be asserted narrowly and specifically. See, e.g., In re Sealed Case 
(Espy}, 121 F.3d 729 (D.C. Cir. 1997); Comm. on Oversight & Gov't R~form v. Holder, No. 12-
cv-1332, 2014 WL 12662665, at *2 (D.D.C. 2014) (rejecting a "blanket" executive-privilege 
claim over subpoenaed documents). 
The Select Committee appreciates your ongoing willingness to discuss Mr. Meadows,s 
appearance, and the Select Committee agreed to postpone the subpoena deadlines to give you 
and Mr. Meadows an opportunity to consult with the White House counsel's office to facilitate 
our discussion of this and other scoping issues. It now appears that Mr. Meadows may still 
believe that his appearance cannot be compelled and that his testimony is privileged. Given the 
impasse, the Select Committee must proceed and insist, pursuant to the subpoena, that Mr. 
Meadows produce all responsive docmnents by November 5, 2021, and appear for testimony on 
November 12, 2021. The Select Committee expects Mr. Meadows's production of documents 
and appearance for testimony on these dates. If there ate specific questions at that deposition that 
you believe raise privilege issues, Mr. Meadows should state them at that time for the deposition 
record for the Select Committee's consideration and possible judicial review. 
Please be advised that the Select Committee will view Mr. Meadows's failure to respond 
to the subpoena as willful non-compliance. Such willful non-compliance with the subpoena 
would force the Select Committee to consider invoking the contempt of Congress procedures in 
2 U.S.C. §§ 192, 194-which could result in a referral from the House to the Department of 
Justice for criminal charges-as well as the possibility of having a civil action to enforce the 
subpoena brought against Mr. Meadows in Iris personal capacity. 
Sincerely, 
Bennie G. Thompson

Re: 
Subpoenas Served on Honorable Mark R. Meadows 
Dear Chair Thompson and Vice Chair Cheney: 
I write on behalf of Mr. Meadows in response to ihe req1.1e1it for production of documents in the 
Select Committee's subpoena. In your letter of October 25, 2021, you indicated that you were 
extending the return date for the production of documents to Friday, November 5~ 2021. 
As I pl'cviously indicated in my lcttci- of October 7, 2021, we believe that documents responsive 
to that subpoena are not in Mr. Meadows's personal custody or control, but rather are in the 
possession of the Archivist of the United States pursuant to the Presidential Records Act of 1978, 
44 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2207. We understand that the Select Committee has separately requested those 
records from the Archivist and that production of those letters is a current subject of litigation in 
the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. See Trump v. Thompson, No. 1 :21-cv-2769-
TSC (D.D.C.). Mr. Meadows is not a party to that litigation1 though we understand that at least 
some of the_ documents at issue are from his fonner records. To the extent that responsive 
documents reside with the Archivist, they are outside Mr. Meadows's custody and control1 and lie 
is therefore unable to produce them in response to the Select Committee's subpoena. We expect 
that tl10 Select Committee will obtain any portions of Mr. Meadows's former l'ecords to which it 
may be entitled through its request to the Archivist, subject to any applicable rulings from the 
courts.

As I fm111er indicated in my October 7 letter, and as I have explained our process to the Select 
Committee's counsel again this week, we are diligently taking steps to confirm that Mr. lvfeadows 
does not retain custody and control over documents that arc responsive to the Select Committee's 
request, h1cludi11g through review of personal e-mail accounts and electronic devices. To date, we 
have not identified any such documents and therefore have no documents to produce. If we do 
discover any responsive, non-privileged documents, however, we will be prepared to produce 
them. 
To summarize, we are not aware at this time of any documents that are responsive to the Select 
Committee's subpoena and maintained in Mr. Mcadows's custody or control. We therefore have 
no documents to produce to the Select Committee this Friday, November 5. We are, however~ 
diligently taking steps to confirm that no stJch documents exist. And we agree that we would 
produce-any responsive, non-privileged documents we might find. I would be happy to discuss 
these matters further with you or with the Select Committee's investigative staff.

. 
Dear Chair Thompson and Vice Chair Cheney: 
Thank you for your letter of October 25, 2021, and thanks to you and to the Select Committee for 
your willingness to engage with us on the important issues raised by the Select Committee•s 
subpoena to former White House Chief of ~taff Mark Meadows. As your letter recognizes, these 
issues have been the frequent subject of litigation and of conflicting views between Congress and 
the Executive. 
One of tllc important themes coming out of that litigation, and out of over 200 years of conflict 
between the branches, is that efforts to reach mutual accommodations to resolve differences have 
been the norm. See, e.g., Trump v. Mazars USA, LLP, 140 S. Ct. 2019. 2029-31 (2020). 
Considering that histo1y of engagement to find accommodation-which the courts obviously 
favor--the Select Committee's position, as expressed in your lettert is rather surprising, and indeed 
disappointing. The Select Committee apparently rejects each and every consideration raised in 
our correspondence with the Select Committee and with the White House Counsel that bears on 
whether and to what ex.tent Mr. Meadows would be in a position to supply information to the 
Select Committee pursuant to its subpoena. 
The purpo.qe of this letter is t-0 explore whether the Select Committee is willing to pursnc somo 
accominodation with Mr. Meadows that respects the position in which he finds himself and allows

the Committee to obtain information without abridging what Mr. Meadows believes in good faith 
to be his legal obligations arising from his tenure as White House Chief of Staff. 
For context, former President Trump has directed Mr. Meadows, both in writing and orally, to 
maintain such privileges and immunities as apply to the demands of the Select Committee's 
subpoena. As you note in your letter, the former President has also filed a lawsuit challenging on 
various grounds the Select Committee's subpoena to the Archivist of the United States. While that 
lawsuit does not directly implicate the Select Committee's subpoena for Mr. Meadows's 
testbnony, there is no reasonable doubt that the issues of privilege and valid legislative purpose 
raised in that lawsuit also bear on Mr. Meadows. Moreover, to date, and notwithstanding a specific 
inquiry through counsel to the Biden White House, Mr. Meadows has received no direction from 
the current President that contradicts or otherwise conflicts with the direction he bas received from 
former President Trump. 
Under these circumstances, it would be untenable for Mr. Meadows to decide unilaterally that he 
will waive privileges that not only protected his own work as a senior White House official but 
also protect current and future White House officials, who rely on executive privilege in giving 
thcir1.best, most candid advice to the President. 
Thus, if we were forced to litigate whether Mr. Meadows must comply with the Select 
Committee's subpoena, we would of necessity assert executive privilege, among other challenges 
to the subpoena. That is especially necessary since, as mentioned above, your letter gives no 
indication of any willingness on the part of Select Committee to accommodate executive privilege 
or any of the other relevant considerations that inform Mr. Meadows's legal position. 
In addition, the Select Committee's apparent unwillingness to pursue accommodation would 
compel Mr. Meadows to maintain his position, consistent with multiple opinions from a bipartisan 
group of Attorneys General, that senior White House aides cannot be compelled to testify before 
Congress in relation to their duties, I recognize, as your letter points out, that to date, the lower 
courts have not shared that view. But to our best knowledge, the Executive Branch has never 
retreated from that position, and of course, the Supreme Court has never had the opportunity to 
address it. What remains inescapable, in any event, is that compelling senior White House officials 
to testify before Congress has a chilling effect on the ability of senior aides, current and fhture, to 
communicate with and on behalf of the President they serve. For that reason, Mr. Meadows would 
resist being so compelled unless and until a court orders him to do otherwise, including after full 
appellate review . 
.1\1r. Meadows is not resisting the Select Committee's subpoena to pick a fight or to hide 
unflattering information. To the contrary, it would be in his personal interest for members of the 
Select Committee and the public at large to understand the basic facts as to what occurred. For 
example, we anticipate that, if we were to be able to reach some accommodation with the 
Committee without vitiating privilege considerations, the Select Committee would learn that 
neither Mr. Meadows, nor to this knowledge anyone on the White House staff, had advanced 
knowledge of violent acts or a plan to infiltrate the Capitol Building, and that there was no delay

when the Administration was called to help restore order. Mr. Meadows is acting in good faith to 
protect the pdvileges and institutional prerogatives of the Executive Branch which attach to hi~ 
tenu1 e at the White House, as one would expect from any responsible former Chief of Staff. 
It is not 1musual for Congress and executive officials to have competing views about Congress"s 
authority and executive officials' privileges and immunities. As noted above, such disputes have 
been a common feature of this sort of episode for more than two cenn1ries. But equally common 
has been a willingness of both sides to discuss and negotiate in good faith to determine whether an 
accommodation can be reached. h1 that spirit, Mr. Meadows is willing to explore with the Select 
Committee whether, outside the confines of the subpoena, an accommodation could be reached by 
which he might be able to answer, under agreed upon and appropriate circumstances, a limited set 
of questions that would further a valid legislative purpose within the scope of the Select 
Committee "s inquiry.

Mr. George Terwilliger III 
McGt.tl.re Woods LLP 
Dear Mr. Terwilliger, 
November 5, 2021 
The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack ("'Select Committee") is in 
receipt of your letters dated November 3, 202l, regarding the subpoena for documents and 
testimony served on your client, Mark R. Meadows (the "subpoe11a"). In your letter regarding 
deposition tcsti111011.y, you suggest that Mr. Meadows maintains a "good faith" belief tbat he 
cannot appear before the Select Committee to answer any questions and, instead, proposes 
un&pcci.ficd accommodations. In your letter regarding the production of documents, you said that 
there are "110 documents to produce to the Select Committee'' because you "are not aware at this 
time of any documents that are responsive to the Select Committee's subpoena and maintained in 
Mr. Meadows's custody or control.
0 
Per the Select Committee~s October 25, 2021 letter, the responsive date for Mr. Meadows 
to produce documents has been extended until November 5 and his deposition is scheduled for 
November 12. For the reasons that follow, the Select Committee cannot agree to further 
postponements. 
First, regarding doci1ments, you suggest that Mr. Jvleadows docs not have any documents 
to produce, despite indicating, via telephone, earlier this week that you have gathered documents 
and continue to review them for responsiveness. If Mr. Meadows has responsive documents but 
believes that they are covered by an applicable privilege, please provide a privilege log that 
specifically identifies each document and each privilege that he believes applies so that the 
Select Committee can evaluate whether any additional actions are appropriate. As explained in 
the Select Committcc•s October 25, 2021 letter, ca.tcgorioal claims of executive privilege arc 
improper and Mr. Meadows mtlst assert any claim of executive privilege narrowly and 
specifically. See, e.g., In re Sealed Case (Espy), 121 F.3d 729 (D.C. Cir. 1997); Comm. on 
Oversight & Gov't Reform v. Holder, No. 12-cv-1332, 2014 WL 12662665, at *2 (D.D.C. Aug. 
20, 2014) (rejecting a 
0 blanket" executive-privilege claim over subpoenaed documents). We 
also note that the Select Committee has received information suggesting that Mr. Meadows 
regularly communicated by text and verbally on his private cell phone when conducting 
government and campaign business. We expect that a number of those communications are

likely records covered and protected by the Presidential Records Act. We ask that you identify 
for us the current location of Mr. Meadows's cell phone and whether Mr. Meadows supplied his 
texts and other relevant cell phone records to the Archives. 
Second, with respect to Mr. Meadows's deposition, the Select Committee appreciates 
your apparent willingness to seek an accommodation and have Mr. Meadows appear to testify 
before the Select Committee. To that end, we will provide further information about the topics 
we intend to develop with Mr. Meadows during the deposition. We have already identified some 
of those topics and articulated why they do not 1D1plicate executive privilege. See our October 
25, 2021 letter. 
After reviewing that letter and those topics, you indicated in a November 2 telephone 
conference with staff that Mr. Meadows may assert executive privilege with respect to even 
those areas and disagreed the Select Committee's position that those areas would be outside of 
any recognized privilege. 
Despite this significant disagreement over the scope of executive privilege, we write 
today in a continued effort to reach an accommodation with Mr. Meadows. More specifically, we 
identify below the areas that we will seek to develop during Mr. Meadows' deposition. At 
present, the Select Committee plans to question Mr. Meadows about his knowledge, actions, and 
communications, including communications involving Mr. Trump and others, with respect to the 
following: 
(1) Messaging to or from the White House, Trump reelection campaign, party officials, 
and others about purported fraud, irregularities, or malfeasance in the November 2020 
election. This includes, but is not limited to, Mr. Trump's and others frequent use of 
the "Stop the Steal" slogan, even after lawsuits, investigations, public reporting, 
discussions· with agency heads, and internally created documents revealed that there 
had not been widespread election fraud. 
(2) White House officials' understanding of purported election-related fraud, 
irregularities, or malfeasance in the November 2020 election. 
(3) Efforts to pressure federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, to take 
actions to challenge the results of the presidential election, advance allegations of 
voter fraud, interfere with Congress's count of the Electoral College vote, or 
otherwise overturn President Bi den's certified victory. This includes, but is not 
limited to, Mr. Trump's and others' efforts to use the Department of Justice to 
investigate alleged election-related conduct, file lawsuits, propose that state 
legislatures take election-related actions, or replace senior leadership. It also includes 
similar efforts at other agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, the 
Department of Defense, and, among others, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency.

( 4) Efforts to pressure state and local officials and entities, including state attorneys 
general, state legislators, and state legislatures, to take actions to challenge the results 
of the presidential election, advance unsubstantiated allegations of voter fraud, 
interfere with Congress's count of the Electoral College vote, de-certify state election 
results, appoint alternate slates of electors, or otherwise overturn President Biden' s 
certified victory. This includes, but is not limited to, an Oval Office meeting with 
legislators from Michigan, as well as a January 2, 2021 call with, among others, state 
officials, members of Congress, Mr. Trump, and Mr. Meadows. 
(5) Theories and strategies regarding Congress a11d the Vice President's (as President of 
the Senate) roles and responsibilities when counting the Electoral College vote. This 
includes, but is not limited to, the theories and/or imderstandings of John Eastman, 
Mark Martin, former Vice President Pence, and others. 
( 6) Efforts to pressure former Vice President Pence, members of his staff, and members 
of Congress to delay or prevent certification of the Electoral College vote. This 
includes, but is not limited to, meetings between, or including, the former Vice 
President, Mr. Trump, aides, John Eastman, members of Congress, and others. 
(7) Campaign-related activities, including effo1ts to count, not count, or audit votes, as 
well as discussions about election-related matters with state and local officials. This 
includes, but is not limited to, Mr. Meadows' travel to Georgia to observe vote 
counting, as well as his or Mr. Trump's communications with officials and employees 
in the Georgia Secretary of State's Office. This also includes similar activities related 
to state and local officials in Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, and 
Pennsylvania. 
(8) Meetings or other communications involving people who did not work for the United 
States government. This includes, but is not limited to, an Oval Office meeting on 
December 18, at which Mr. Tnunp, Michael Flynn, Patrick Byrne, and others 
discussed campaign-related steps that Mr. Tnunp purportedly could take to change 
the outcome of the November 2020 election and remain in office for a second term, 
such as seizing voting machines, litigating, and appointing a special counsel. It also 
includes communications with organizers of the January. 6 rally like Amy Kremer of 
Women for America First. 
(9) Communications and meetings with members of Congress about the November 2020 
election, purported election fraud, actual or proposed election-related litigation, and 
election-related rallies and/or protests, This includes, but is not limited to, a 
December 21, 2021 meeting involving Mr. Trump, members of his legal team, and 
members of the House and Senate, during which attendees discussed objecting to the 
November 2020 election's certified electoral college votes as part of an apparent fight 
"against mounting evidence of voter fraud.,,

not limited to, campaign-related planning and activities at the Willard Hotei planning 
and preparation for Mr. Tnunp's speech at the Ellipse, Mr. Trump and other White 
House officials' actions during and after the attack on the U.S. Capitol, and contact 
with members of Congress, law enforcement, the Department of Defense, and other 
federal agencies to address or respond to the attack. 
(13) 
The possibility of invoking martial law, the Insurrection Act, or the 25th 
Amendment based on election~related issues or the events in the days leading up to~ 
and including, January 6. 
(14) 
The vreservalion or destruction of any information relating to the facts, 
circumstances,_ and causes relating to the attack of January 6th, including any such 
information that may have been stored, generated, or destroyed on personal electronic 
devices. 
(15) 
Documents and information, including the location of such documents and 
information, that are responsive to the Select Committee's subpoena. This includes, 
but is not limited to, information stored on electronic devices that Mr. Meadows uses 
and has used. 
(16) 
Topics about which Mr. Meadows has already spoken publicly. This includes, but 
is not limited to, Mr. Meadows's February 11, 2021, appearance on the Ingraham 
Angle show to discuss the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Mr. Tnunp,s 
reactions to the attack, and the National Guard. 
Again, this list is non-exclusive and may be supplemented as our investigation continues, 
but we do not expect to seek information from Mr. Meadows unrelated to the 2020 election and 
what led to and occurred on January 6. We also continue to interview additional witnesses who 
have personal knowledge of these issues and Mr. Meadows's involvement. As our investigation 
continues, we may develop additional information about the above-described areas or identify 
additional subjects about which we will seek information from your client. We will discuss those 
issues with you on an ongoing basis provided we are continuing to negotiate about these issues 
and Mr. Meadows's potential privilege assertions.

Mr, George Terwilliger III 
Page5 
We believe that these topics either do not implicate any cognizable claim of executive 
privilege or raise issues for which the Select Committee's need for the info1mation is sufficiently 
compelling that it overcomes any such claim. To that end, please provide your input on the 
topics that the Select Committee has reiterated by way of this letter no later than Monday, 
November 8, If there are areas listed above that you agree implicate no executive or other 
privilege, please identify those areas, Conversely, please articulate which privilege you believe 
applies to each area and how it is implicated. Our hope is that this process will sharpen our 
differences on privilege issues and allow us to develop unobjectionable areas promptly. 
Mr. Meadows's deposition scheduled for November 12 can proceed on at least the 
agreed-upon topics, and we can move one step closer towards the resolution of outstanding 
issues. 
Finally, it is worth emphasizing an additional point that is also addressed in the pending 
litigation involving the National Archives. For purposes of executive privilege, Mr. Meadows 
apparently sees no significant difference between himself and Mr. Trump as former executive 
branch officials, and President Biden and his chief of staff as current executive branch officials. 
That distinction, however, is meaningful because it is the incumbent President that is responsible 
for guarding executive privilege., not former officials. Dellums v. Powell, 561 F.2d 242,247 
(D.C. Cir. 1977); see also Nixon v. GSA, 433 U.S. 425,449 {1977) (even the one residual 
privilege that a fo1mer president might assert, the communications privilege, exists "for the 
benefit of the Republic," rather than for the' former "President as an individual"). With respect to 
the Select Committee's work, the incumbent President has actually expressly declined to assei:t 
executive privilege on a number of subjects on which the Select Committee has sought testimony 
or documents. See Tnnnp v. Thompson, Case No. 1:21-cv-2769 (TSC), Doc, 21 (brief for the 
NARA defendants); see also Doc. 21~1 (Declaration ofB. John Laster). 
The accommodations process regarding potential claims of executive privilege is a 
process engaged in between the Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch. See Trump v. 
Mazars USA LLP, 140 S. Ct. 2019, 2030-31 (2020). Mr. Meadows represents neither. 
Nevertheless, we have in good faith considered your concerns and have proposed a course of 
action that reflects both that consideration and the Select Committee's urgent need for 
info1mation.

Our hope is that this description of topics allows us to narrow the list of potentially 
disputed issues and move forward with Mr. Meadows' deposition. You have asked for 
negotiation, and we have responded in good faith. As was true before, however, the Select 
Committee will view Mr. Meadows's failm·e to respond to the subpoena as willful non-
compliance. Such willful non-compliance with the subpoena would force the Select Committee 
to consider invoking the contempt of Congress procedures in 2 U.S.C. §§ 192, 194-which could 
result in a referral from the House to the Department of Justice for criminal charges-as well as 
the possibility of having a civil action to enforce the subpoena brought against Mr~ Meadows in 
his personal capacity.

Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
U.S. House ofRe resent.atives 
Re: 
Subpoenas Served on Honorable Mark R. Meadows 
Dear Chair Thompson and Vice Chair Cheney: 
I, ·write in response to Chainnnn Thompson's letter of Friday, November 5, 2021. Thank you for 
your willingness to discuss the important issues raised by the Select Committee's subpoena. You 
asked that I respond by today, Monday, November 8, 2021, and so I am writing to so respond and 
to further seek some reasonable accommodation of the Select Committee's demands. 
Please allow me to reiterate a fundamental point: Mr, Meadows position regarding testimony to 
the Select Committee is driven by his intent to maintain privileges that obviously attach to most 
subject matters arising from his tenure as White House Chief of Staff. Put simply, whether or not 
we agree that he lacks standing to assert privilege, it is obvious that he has no authority to 
unilaterally waive privilege. Moreover, as a respow;ible former Chief of Staff, he is abiding by 
the unifonn, bi":'partisan position of the Department of Justice that senior-most White House Staff 
canno~ be compelled to provide congressional testimony. Unless the Depattnient changes its 
position, and a court of comJ>etent authority directs himt after full appellate review, to do 
otherwise, that is the position we m1.1st maintain. 
Despite that position, we have, now on several occasions, sought to find, outside the context of 
compulsion, accommodation with the Select Committee tbnt would allow it to obtain some 
informatiun from Mr. Meadows legitimately within the purview of a proper legislative purpose.

Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
November 8, 2021 
Page2 
We have gone so far as to proffer some information about a core aspect of apparent interest to the 
Select Committee. Unfortunately, our efforts have been met, including in your letter of November 
5, with ever-broadening topical demands from the Select Committee (as detailed below), rather 
than an attempt to narrow our differences by focusing on a more particularized band of inquiry. 
Nonetheless, we would propose yet again a means to accommodation outside the scope of 
subpoena that does not require Congress or Mr. Meadows to waive any legal rights, To that end, 
we would propose that the Select Committee propound written interrogatories to Mr. ·Meadows on 
any ~opics about which the Select Committee might wish to inquire. If the Select Committee is 
willing to do so, we are willing to l'espond to them as quickly as is feasible. That would allow Mr. 
Meadows to provide what information he can and/or to articulate clear assertions of privilege 
where applicable to specific questions. We believe doing so, at least initially, would present an 
orderly approach of far greater promise than would attempting to do so in a live setting. 
With respect to the Select Committee's request for documents, please allow me to clarify as I 
believe your letter may misapprehend what we have related to your staff. While serving as White 
House Chief of Staff, Mr. Meadows conducted business on a computer and cell phone provided 
by the Federal Government. We believe that those devices contain the documents that are 
responsive to the Select Committee's subpoena. But those devices, and the documents on them, 
are no longer in Mr. Meadows's custody and control. He returned those devices to the Federal 
Government on January 20, 2021, and we believe them to be in the custody and control of the 
Archivist. We understand that the Select Committee is already in the process of seeking those and 
other documents from the National Archives, but Mr. Meadows does not have any formal role in 
that process. 
Separately, to ensure that nothing has been missed, Mr. Meadows has provided us with access to 
electronic images from his personal accounts and devices. We do not expect those personal 
accounts and devices to contain much, if any, responsive material, but it is that review which is 
ongoing. My letter of November 3, 2021 was to indicate that we would agree to produce any 
responsive materials if we should identify any, without waiving attorney-client or any other 
applicable privilege. If we identify respons1ve materials that we conclude must be withheld based 
on an assertion of privilege, we will most certainly provide a privilege log as you request. 
While we appreciate the Select Committee's expressed openness to an accommodation, we are 
concerned, as referenced above, that your latest letter expands, rather than narrows the scope of 
topics that any proposed accommodation might address. On October 12, I received from counsel 
for the Select Committee a list of topics that I was told reflected the Select Committee's view of 
what lay outside the scope of executive privilege. We had a different view abmit the applicability 
of executive privilege to those categories, but we appreciated the effort to reach common ground. 
In your latest letter of November 5, however, there is listed an expanded set of categories that 
plainly implicate executive privilege even under a narrow interpretation of it. For instance, you 
ask Mr. Meadows to testify about "White House officials' understanding of purported 
election-related fraud, irregularities, or malfeasance in the November 2020 election." As you

know, the Executive Branch is responsible for enforcing federal election laws, and it is natural for 
federal officials to discuss and deliberate on those issues. We do not see how Mr. Meadows could 
testify about that topic without implicating executive privilege. You also ask Mr. Meadows to 
testify about President Trump's "and others' efforts to use the Department of Justice to investigate 
alleged election-related conduct, file lawsuits, propose that state legislatures take election-related 
actions, or replace se1tlor leadership." As you know, the President is Chief Executive and oversees 
the Department of Justice, as well as other federal agencies. We do not see how Mr. Meadows 
could testify about that topic without implicating executive privilege. Ifwe are misunderstanding 
the Select Committee's position, and there is some narrower subset of these categories that the 
Select Committee genuinely believes to be outside executive privilege, we would welcome the 
clarification. 
In addition to your expanded list of topics., you also maintain that "this list is non-exclusive and 
may be supplemented." You also state that the Select Committee "continue[s] to interview 
additional witnesses who have personal knowledge of these issues and Mr. Meadows's 
involvement." In addition to raising concerns about the Select Committee moving away from a 
reasonable accommodation, these statements also raise questions about why the Select Committee 
feels the need to subpoena the former White House Chlef of Staff at all and, in particular, why the 
Select Committee is insisting on a November 12 date for such testimony. The courts have made 
clear that an important factor in assessing whether Congress can compel production of information 
about the President and his senior advisors is whether Congress has altemative means of getting 
the same information. See Nixon v. Adm'r of Gen. Servs., 433 U.S. 425,482 (1977); Tnimp v. 
Mazars USA, LLP, 140 S. Ct. 2019, 2025 (2020). If the Select Committee is already gathering 
documents and testimony about Mr. Meadows and his conduct during the relevant period, as your 
letter suggests, it is not clear why the Select Committee needs to gather that information again 
from him-in a posture that would threaten long"term effects for executive privilege. 
The Executive Branch has pn1dently and consistently maintained in Administrations 1mder both 
parties that Congress does not have the authority to compel testimony from the President's most 
senior advisors without the need to parse underlying questions of executive privilege. As the 
Supreme Court has noted, it can be very difficult to parse out the official and non-official duties 
of the President, who must serve as a one-man branch of government. See Trump v. Mazars USA, 
LLP, 140 S. Ct. 2019, 2024 (2020). It is all the more difficult to conduct that parsing during live 
testimony. Therefore, we believe that the alternate approach we respectfully suggest would 
provide the best path forward. We hope the Committee will give careful consideration to our 
suggestion for the use of voluntary interrogatory questions and answers. 
* 
* 
* 
Again, I want to thank you and the Select Committee for your willingness to engage on these 
important topics. We recognize that the Select Committee and Mr. Meadows have very different 
views about the scope of Congress' authority and the protections afforded to Mr. Meadows.

Y 01.1 also uote in your letter that, if we do not reach an accommodation, you intend to pursue a 
contempt citation against Mr. Meadows. We do not believe that would be warranted under the 
circumstances, but we understand that the Select Committee will do what it sees most fit. \Ve 
respectfully request, however, that, if the Select Committee does decide to pursue a contempt 
citation against Mr. Meadows., in fairness to him that our mutual correspondence would be entered

Mr. George Terwilliger TU 
McGuire Woods LLP 
Dear Mr. Terwilliger: 
November 9, 2021 
The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack e•select Committee") is in 
receipt of your letter dated November 8, 2021. 
As explained in the Select Committee's letter dated November 5, 2021, we have bee~ and 
remain, interested in rcachi11g an accommodation with Mr. Meadows that allows the Select 
Co1mnittcc to fulfill its purpose of understanding the complete picture of what led to and occurred 
on January 6th, making recommendations for cl1angcs to the law that will protect our democracy, 
and help ensure that nothing like January 6th ever happens again. To that end, we have endeavored 
to identify discrete areas or inquiry that we seek to develop with Mr. Meadows. 
As you are aware, the Select Committee has identified sixteen subject matters for inquiry 
and asked that you explain your position as to whether any of those areas would trigger any claims 
of executive privilege. In your November 8 letter, you did not respond with any specificity about 
those areas, which we assume means that you believe all potentially implicate executive privilege. 
Without ftuther input on those areas, it appears that the accommodation process has reached its 
natural conclusion. 
As a result, the Select Committee must insist that Mr, Meadows appear for a deposition on 
November 12, 2021, as re uired b the sub oena. The de osition will be in at 10:00 a.m. in-
. Although you have 
stated a preference to proceed by written interrogatories, there is simply no substitute for live, in-
person testimony and the Select Committee respectfully declines your suggestion to proceed 
otherwise. At Friday's deposition, we will inquire about the areas identified in the November 5 
letter. We continue to believe they do not implicate any privilege, though we understand that Mr. 
Meadows may assert executive privilege as to certain questions. Our intention is to develop the 
areas that are outside of any privilege claim, and to give you and Mr. Meadows the opportunity to 
state privilege objections to specific questions on the record. 
As we discussed by telephone today, our investigation has identified evidence regarding 
your client's use of personal cellular telephones and email accounts. Mr. Meadows's use of such 
personal devices and accounts will be a subject ofinquiry at Friday's deposition. More specifically,

we will seek to develop the following information, none of which implicutes any executive or other 
privilege: 
(1) Between the dates November 3, 2020, and January 20, 2021, did Ml:. Meadows use any 
electronic application with encryption technology to communicate any government-
related messages? If so) wlucl1 applications did Mr. :Meadows use? Does Mr. Meadows 
stitl have access to these messages? Were these messages searched in response to the 
Select Committee's subp_oena? 
(2) Between the dates November 3, 2020, and January 20, 2021, did Mr. Meadows llse any 
personal communications devices1 including but not limited to cell phones aa:,igned the 
U\unbet~ 
and 
(3) If Mr. Meadows had such personal communications devices, did he use them for any 
govemment--related communications? 
( 4) If Mr. Meadows had such personal communications devices, does he still have those 
devices and any text messages stored therein'? 
(5) If so, have those devices been searched for records responsive to the Select 
Committee's subpoena. to Mr. Meadows? 
(6) If Mr. Meadows no longer has such personal communications dcvioos Qr no longer has 
the text messages from the date range mentioned above; what did he do with those 
devices and messag~? Did he turn them over to the National Archives'/ Ifhe no longer 
has possession of them, doe~ he have knowledge regarding their dispositio11? 
(7) Dming tho date ranges mentioned above, did Mr. Meadows utilize a non-government 
email account, such as n Gmail account? If so, did Mr. Meadows use that account for 
any govcrrunent~related communications? Does Mr. Meadows still have access to the 
account? Has any sucl1 account been searched for .records responsive to the Select 
Committee's subpoena to Mr. Meadows? 
( 
(8) If M'r, Meadows had a non-government email account during the dates mentioned 
above1 but no longer has access to that account or no longer has emails from the date 
range mentioned above, what happened to that account or those emails? Did he provide 
all government-related emails to the National Archives? 
As we discussed, it would be helpful to have information about these issues before Friday's 
deposition.

Please con:finn receipt of this letter and Mr. Meadows' intent to appear for his deposition 
on Fdday. Our staff is available to talk with yott about logistical information such as building 
access. The Select Committee will view Mr. Meadows,s failure to appear for the dcpositiun and 
respond to the subpoena as willful 11on-oompliance. Such willful non-compliance with the 
subpoena wol1ld force tho Select Committee to consider invoking the contempt of Congress

Re: 
Subpoenas Served on Honorable Mark R. Meadows 
Dear Chair Thom~son and Vice Chair Cheney: 
I write to ack11owledge reQeipt of your letter of yesterday, November 9, 2021, in which you 
reject yet again a proposal for accommodation and ignore our Ruggestion to seek an 
accommodation outside the compulsion of a committee subpoena. Rather, the Select Committee 
.insists that l\1r. Meadows appear pursuan1 to a subpoena for a deposition this Fliday, November 
12, 2021, pertaining-'rvithout limitation 'in tight of the privilege concerns we have raised-to 
sixteen wide~ranging subject tnattets as to which he would be questioned. You havo made this 
demand notwithsta.11di.t1g the n11merous outstanding issues that we have been discussing. Not toast 
among these, we have asserted that M':1-. Meadows feels duty botmd to respect the bi-partisan 
posi lions of multiple presidential administrations, as expressed by the Department of Justice, that 
senior aides to the president ca1111ot be compelled to provide congressional testimony. Mr. 
Meadows cannot agree to appear at 10 AM Friday. 
The Select Committee has already threatened to enforce its subpoena against Mr. Meadows 
if he does not appear for live testimony, but 1 urge you to roconsidet· that position.- It would be an 
extraordina1y step for the Select Committee to seek to force Mr. Meadows to t~stify under these 
circumstances.: The Seleot Committee's s11bpocna directly seeks infotmatio11. about Mr. 
Meadows, s tenure as White House Chief of Staff. including infonnation tlmt he knows only from 
discussions with then-President Trump in the course of official duties. Presiclent T111mp has 
instmcied him to maintain and asi;ert privilege and testimonial immunity to the full extent of the 
law, and Mr. Meadows has not received any contraiy instruction from the current 
Administration. There is active litigation in the federal courts over related privilege issues that

could bear on Mr. Meadows 's testimony. And as expressed in your letter of last Ftiday, November 
5, 2021, the Select Committee still has 11ol determined the full scope of infonnation that it intends 
to seek from Mr. Meadows under its broad Sl.lbpocnn.. 
\Ve also regret that we have 11ot been able to reach an accommodation with the Select 
Committee outside the contours of the subpocn~ as Congt ~ss has o ftcn been able to <lo with senior 
Executive officials over the past two centuries. Curiously, your letter insists that the 
accommodation process has stalled because the Select Committee does not have written views 
from Mr. Meadows on which subjects of the Select Committee's inquiry would be subject to legal 
privileges, including executive privilege. And yet that is precisely what we proposed to provide 
in response to written intetTogatodes from the Select Committee. We have 11ever suggested that, 
by agreeing to propound interrogatories as a next step in the acco.tnmodat.ion process, the Select 
Committee would forfeit the ab11ity to seek live testimony. Nor would Mr. Meadows forfeit his 
ability to object to this 1cquesL Thal is the nature ofan accommodation. It is therefore tmfortunatc 
that the Select Committee has rnshcd to compel Jive testimony now. 
Mr. Meadows has proudly served in the House of Representatives. He fully appreciates 
Congress's role in our constitutional system. But in these circumstances, that apprcciatiou for our 
constitutional system and the separation of powers dictal.es that he cannot appear on Friday to 
testify about his tenure as White House Chief of Staff. Mr. Meadows does not resist the Select 
Committee's subpoena out of self-interest. He instead feels duty-bound as former White House 
Chief of Staff to protect the prerogatives of that office und of Executive Branch in which he 
served. Mr. Meadows cannot, in good conscience, undem1ino tho office and all who will bold it 
through a unilateral waiver of pdvilcgc and testimonial immunity. 
I hope you will accept my sincere thanks for the opportunity to luwc engaged in this 
dialogue with you and the Select Committee conceming Mr. Meadows·s compelled appearance 
before it. I regret that tl1is frank exchange of views has not apparently led to an agreed upon 
reso1ution. As stated above, we do hope that the Select Committee will reconsider its apparent 
decision to enforce its subpoena against Mr. Meadows. But if not. we reiterate our request for the 
Select Committee to enter our muh1al correspondence, including this letter, into the official record 
of any associated proceedings. 
Sincerely yours, 
George J. Terwilliger Ill

Mr. George Terwilliger III 
McGuire Woods LLP 
Dear Mr. Terwilliger: 
November 11, 2021 
The Select Committee to Investigate the January 61h Attack ('•Select Committee") is in 
receipt of your letter dated November 10, 2021, in which you state that Mr. Meadows feels •;duty 
bound" to disregard the Sciect Committee"s subpoena requiring him to produce documents and 
appoar for testimony. Mr. Meadows's conclusion about his duly, however, relies on a 
misunderstanding ofhis legal obligations under the subpoena. The law requires that Mr. Meadows 
comply with tbe subpoena absent an applicable immunity or vali<l assertion of a Constitutionally 
based privilege. The attached letter from the White House Counsel's Office, dated today, 
eviscerates any plausible claim of testimonial immunity or executive privilege, and compels 
compliance with the Select Committee's subpoena. 
In your letters and tclcpho11e conversations with the Select Committee since October 7, 
2021, you have indicated that Mr. Meadows ''is immune from compelled congressional testimony 
on matters related to his official responsibilities." That position is based on Department of Justice 
Office of Legal Counsel ("OLC"} opinions in which OLC has advised past presidents to claim that 
senior advisors cannot be required to provide testimony to Congress about official actions. These 
opinions, however, do not justify Mr. Meadows's refusal to provide the Select Committee 
information about one of the most significant events in our Nation's history. As we previously 
conveyed, every federal court that has considered the issue of absolute imn11.mity has rejected it, 
even afterOLC last opined on the matter. See, e.g., Comm. 011 theJudiciaty v. Miers, 558F. Supp. 
2d 53, 106 (D.D.C. 2008) (rejecting former White House counsetts assertion of absolute immunity 
from compelled congressional process); Comm. on Judiciary v. McGahu, 415 F. Supp. 3d 148 
(D.D.C. 2019) ("To make the point as plain as possible, it is clear to this Court ..• that, with respect 
to senior-level presidential aides, absolute immunity from compelled congressional process simply 
does not exist/'). 
Your letters also broadly suggest that Mr. Meadows's testimony is covered by claims of 
executive privilege. At the same time, you have failed to respond with specificity about any of the 
areas of inquiry the Select Committee bas identified that do not implicate any privilege at all. For 
example, my most recent letter to you listed eight questions on ,vhich the Select Committee seeks 
Mr, Meadows's testimony related to his use of personal cellular devices and cm.nil nccounts. Your

Mr. George Terwilliger III 
Page2 
letter in response did not address those issues and, instead, made general and unspecified blanket 
assertions of immunity and executive privilege. Bui, as you know and, as explained in my letter 
dated October 25, categorical claims of executive privilege nm afoul of caselaw requiring that any 
claim of executive privilege be asserted narrowly and specifically. See, e.g., In re Sealed Case 
(Espy), 121 F.3d 729, 752 (D.C. Cir. 1997) ("the presidential communications privilege should be 
constmed as narrowly ... "); Comm. on Oversight & Gov't Reform v. Holder, 2014 WL 12662665, 
at *2 (rejecting a ''blankef' executive-privilege claim over subpoenaed documents). We find it 
hard to consider your offer to answer questions in writing as genuine when you failed to responµ 
to the questions we explicitly asked. Please resp~nd to those questions no later than tomorrow. 
In addition, Mr. Meadows has not produced even a single document in response to the 
Select Committee's subpoena. Although you previously indicated that your firm was searching 
records that Mr. Meadows provided to you, more than enough time has passed for you to complete 
your review. Please immediately inform the Select Committee whether Mr. Meadows has any 
records responsive to the subpoena. Your search for responsive records should include (but not be 
limited to) any text messages, emails, or applicationwbased messages associated with the cellular 
phone numbers and private email address the Select Committee has identified. If Mr. Meadows 
has records that you believe are protected by some form of privilege, you must provide the Select 
Committee a log describing each such record and the basis for the privilege asserted. 
Further, the Select Committee understands that today, November 11, 2021, you received 
the attached letter from the White House Counsel's Office addressing your previously stated 
concern that "Mr. Meadows has not received any contrary instruction from the current 
Administration." The White House Counsel's letter clearly explains the current President's 
position: ·''[t]he President believes that the constitutional protections of executive privilege should 
not be used to shield information reflecting an effort to subvert the Constitution itself: and indeed 
believes that such an assertion in this circumstance would be at odds with the principles that 
underlie the privilege.'' For that reason, and others, your client has now been advised that (i) "an 
assertion of privilege is not justified with respect to testimony and documents" relevant to the 
Select Committee's investigation, and (ii) the President will not be asserting any claims of 
executive privilege or testimonial immunity regarding subjects about which the Select Committee 
seeks documents and testimony from Mr. Meadows. 1 
Simply put, there is no valid legal basis for Mr. Meadows's continued resistance to the 
Select Committee's subpoena. As such, the Select Committee expects Mr. Meadows to produce 
1 Your letter states that Mr. Meadows cannot "in good conscience" give testimony out of an "appreciation for our 
constitutional system and tb.e separation of powers" because doing so would "undermine the office and all who hold 
it." You also acknowledge, however, that Congress has successfhlly obtained information from 0 s enior Executive 
officials over the past two centuries," as you 'm.ust, because there is a long history of senior aides providi11g 
testimony to Congress without upending our constitutional system. SeeJ e.g., Trump v. Thompson, No. 21-cv-2769 at 
19-20 (D.D.C. Nov. 9, 2021) (describing congressional testimony of White House staff during the Nixon and 
Reagan administrations, as well as President George W. Bush's interview with the 9/11 Commission); see also 
Presidential Advisers' Testimony Before Congressional Committees: An Overview, CRS REPORT FOR CoNGRESS 
{April 10, 2007) (providmg numerous examples of presidential aides testifying befme Congress including, Lloyd 
Cutler (Counsel to the President), Samuel Berger (Assistant to the President), Harold Ickes (Assistant to the 
President and Deputy Chief of Staff)).

all responsive documents and appear for deposition testimony tomorrow, November 12, 2021, at 
10:00 a.m. If there are specific questions during that deposition that you believe raise legitimate 
privilege issues, Mr. Meadows should state them at that time on the record for the Select 
Committee's consideration and possible judicial review. 
The Select Committee will view Mr. Meadows's failure to appear at the deposition, and to 
produce responsive documents or a privilege log indicating the specific basis for withholding any 
documents you believe are protected by privilege, as willful non-compliance. Such willfhl non-
compliance with the subpoena wollld force the Select Committee to consider invoking the 
contempt of Congress procedures in 2 U.S.C. §§ 192, 194-which could result in a referral from 
the House of Representatives to the Department of Justice for crhninal charges-as well as the 
possibility of having a civil action to enforce the subpoena brought against Mr. Meadows in his

Dear Mr. Terwilliger: 
THE WHITE HOUSE 
WA$1-!INGTON 
November 11, 2021 
I wiite in response to your letter of Octobei· 11, 2021, regarding a subpoena issued by the 
House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol (the 
"Select C01mnittee") to your client, Mark R. Meadows. 
In ru1 October 8~ 2021 letter to the Archivist of the United States regard.mg the Select 
Committee's request for documeuts relevant to its investigation, the Counsel to the President 
wrote: 
[T]he insurrection that took place on January 6, and the extraordinary events 
surrounding it, must be snbject to a full accounting to ensure nothing similar ever 
happens again. Congress has a compelling need in service of its legislative 
functions to understand the circumstances that led to ... the most serious attack 
on the operations of the Federal Govel1llllent since the Civil War.1 
President Biden recognizes the importance of candid advice in the discharge of the 
President's constitutional responsibilities and believes that, in appropriate cases, executive 
privilege should be asserted to protect former senior White House staff from having to testify 
about conversations concerning the President's exercise of the duties of his office. But in 
recognition of these unique and extraordinary circumstances, where Congress is investigating an 
effort to obstruct the lawful transfer of power under our Constitution, President Biden has 
already determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not in the public interest, and is 
therefore not justified, with respect to particular subjects within the purview of the Select 
Committee. These subjects include: events within the White House on or about January 6, 2021; 
attempts to use the Department of Justice to advance a false llaJ.Tative that the 2020 election was 
tainted by widespread fraud; and other efforts to alter election results or obstmct the b.ansfer of 
power. The President believes that the constitutional protections of executive privilege should 
not be used to shield information reflecting an effort to subvett the Constitution itself, and indeed 
believes that such an assertion in this circumstance would be at odds with the principles that 
underlie the privilege.

President (Oct. 8, 2021).

Consistent with President Biden' s determination that an assertion of privilege is not 
justified with respect to testimony and documents relating to these particular subjects, he has 
detennined that he will not assert executive privilege with respect to your client's deposition 
testimony on these subjects, or any documents your client may possess that bear on them. For 
the same reasons underlying his decisions on executive privilege, President Bid.en has 
determined that he will not assert immunity to preclude your client from testifying before the 
Select Committee. 
Please contact me if you have any questions about the matters described herein.

The official transcript for Mr. Meadows’s 
voluntary deposition on December 8, 2021, is 
as follows: 
SELECT 
COMMITTEE 
TO 
INVES-
TIGATE THE JANUARY 6TH AT-
TACK ON THE U.S. CAPITOL, 
U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTA-
TIVES, WASHINGTON, DC 
DEPOSITION OF: MARK MEADOWS 
(NO-SHOW) 
WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 2021 
WASHINGTON, DC 
The deposition in the above matter was 
held in * * * * commencing at 
10:00 a.m. 
PRESENT: Representatives SCHIFF and 
LOFGREN. 
APPEARANCES: 
FOR THE SELECT COMMITTEE TO 
INVESTIGATE THE JANUARY 
6TH ATTACK ON THE U.S. CAP-
ITOL: 
* * * *, * * * * 
* * * *, * * * * 
* * * *, * * * * 
* * * *, * * * * 
* * * *. All right. It’s 10 a.m. So we’ll 
go ahead and get started going on the 
record. 
This is a deposition of Mark Mead-
ows, conducted by the House Select 
Committee to Investigate the January 
6th Attack on the United States Cap-
itol, pursuant to House Resolution 503. 
My name is * * * *. That’s * * * *, and 
I’m the chief investigative counsel to 
the select committee. With me today 
are * * * *, who is a senior investigative 
counsel, and Ms. ZOE LOFGREN, who is a 
member of the select committee, is 
also participating remotely. 
Based on an agreement with counsel 
to Mr. Meadows, this deposition was to 
begin at 10 a.m. It is now 10 a.m., and 
Mr. Meadows has not appeared. 
Mr. Meadows received a subpoena, 
dated September 23rd, 2021, requiring 
him to produce documents to the select 
committee and appear for a deposition. 
Staff engaged in several discussions 
with Mr. Meadows’ counsel regarding 
the scope of his production and the 
subject matters to be developed at his 
deposition. 
Staff provided Mr. Meadows’ counsel 
with specific areas in which it is inter-
ested and asked Mr. Meadows to iden-
tify those that would trigger a privi-
lege assertion. Rather than engage 
with the select committee, Mr. Mead-
ows asserted that, as a former White 
House chief of staff, he cannot be com-
pelled to provide information to Con-
gress. He communicated his blanket as-
sertion of immunity, in addition to 
claims of executive privilege, in writ-
ing to Chairman THOMPSON. 
On November 12th, 2021, the select 
committee convened the scheduled dep-
osition of Mr. Meadows after the cur-
rent White House indicated, in writing, 
that President Biden would not assert 
any immunity or privilege that would 
prevent Mr. Meadows from appearing 
and answering the committee’s ques-
tions. 
Mr. Meadows did not appear for that 
deposition on November 12th, as indi-
cated in his prior correspondence. 
He also failed to produce any docu-
ments responsive to the select commit-
tee’s subpoena or a privilege log assert-
ing claims of privilege for specific doc-
uments. 
After Mr. Meadows failed to appear 
for his deposition or produce docu-
ments, select committee staff engaged 
in further discussions with Mr. Mead-
ows’ counsel regarding the status of his 
noncooperation. 
Mr. Meadows ultimately agreed to 
produce some documents and to appear 
for a deposition today, December 8th, 
2021, at 10 a.m., an offer which the 
chairman extended to him as a good 
faith effort to enable Mr. Meadows to 
cure his failure to comply with the 
September 23rd subpoena and provide 
information relevant to the select com-
mittee’s investigation. 
Mr. Meadows has now produced docu-
ments. Counsel made clear that Mr. 
Meadows intended to withhold some re-
sponsive information due to a claim of 
executive 
privilege. 
He 
agreed 
to 
produce documents he believes are not 
covered by that or any other privilege 
and to produce a privilege log identi-
fying responsive documents withheld 
due to such privilege assertions. 
He also agreed to appear for a deposi-
tion, at which he would be asked ques-
tions on subject matters relevant to 
the select committee’s inquiry, as 
identified in our prior correspondence, 
and either answer the questions or ar-
ticulate a claimed privilege. 
We agreed with Mr. Meadows’ counsel 
that this production and deposition 
would clarify Mr. Meadows’ position on 
the application of various privileges 
and create a record for further discus-
sion and consideration of possible en-
forcement by the select committee. 
Consistent with that agreement, Mr. 
Meadows did produce documents and 
privilege logs. More specifically, he 
produced approximately 6,600 pages of 
records taken from personal email ac-
counts he used to conduct official busi-
ness, as well as a privilege log describ-
ing other emails over which he claims 
privilege protection. He also produced 
approximately 
2,000 
text 
messages, 
which Mr. Meadows sent or received 
using a personal device which he used 
for official business, in addition to a 
privilege log, in which he describes 
privilege claims over other withheld 
text messages. 
Mr. Meadows was scheduled to appear 
today, December 8th, 2021, for a deposi-
tion. However, he has not appeared and 
is not present today. We received cor-
respondence from Mr. Meadows’ attor-
ney yesterday indicating that, despite 
his prior agreement to appear today, 
his position has changed and he would 
not appear. 
We are disappointed in Mr. Meadows’ 
failure to appear as planned, as it de-
prives the select committee of an op-
portunity to develop relevant informa-
tion in Mr. Meadows’ possession and to, 
more specifically, understand the con-
tours of his executive privilege claim. 
Again, the purpose of today’s pro-
ceeding was to ask Mr. Meadows ques-
tions that we believe would be outside 
of any cognizable claim of executive, 
attorney client, Fifth Amendment, or 
other potentially applicable privilege. 
Our hope is that he would answer 
those questions, which would materi-
ally advance the select committee’s in-
vestigation, given Mr. Meadows’ serv-
ice as White House chief of staff. We 
expected that he would assert privi-
leges in response to various questions, 
articulating the specific privilege he 
believes is implicated and how it ap-
plies to the question asked. We planned 
to evaluate Mr. Meadows’ privilege as-
sertions after today’s proceeding, en-
gage in further discussions with Mr. 
Meadows’ counsel, and consider wheth-
er enforcement steps were appropriate 
and necessary. 
Mr. Meadows’ failure to appear for 
today’s deposition deprives us of the 
opportunity to engage in that process. 
Instead, we are left with Mr. Meadows’ 
complete refusal to appear for his depo-
sition or cure his willful noncompli-
ance with the select committee’s sub-
poena. 
Had Mr. Meadows appeared for his 
deposition today, we would have asked 
him a series of questions about sub-
jects that we believe are well outside of 
any claim of executive privilege. More 
specifically, we would have asked Mr. 
Meadows questions about his use of 
personal email and cellular phones. 
Mr. Meadows’ document production 
includes documents taken from two 
Gmail accounts. We would’ve asked 
him how and for what purpose he used 
those Gmail accounts and when he used 
one of them as opposed to his official 
White 
House 
email 
account. 
We 
would’ve similarly asked him about his 
use of a personal cellular telephone. 
We would have sought to develop in-
formation about when Mr. Meadows 
used his personal cell phone for calls 
and text messages and when he used 
his official White House cell phone for 
those purposes. 
Mr. Meadows’ production of docu-
ments shows that he used the Gmail 
accounts and his personal cellular 
phone for official business related to 
his service as White House chief of 
staff. Given that fact, we would ask 
Mr. Meadows about his efforts to pre-
serve those documents and provide 
them to the National Archives, as re-
quired by the Presidential Records Act. 
Finally, we would have asked Mr. 
Meadows about his use of a signal ac-
count, which is reflected in the text 
messages he produced. 
In addition, we would have asked Mr. 
Meadows about particular emails that 
he produced to the select committee. 
We do not believe these emails impli-
cate any valid claim of executive or 
other privilege, given that Mr. Mead-
ows has produced the emails to the se-
lect committee. 
Specifically, we would’ve asked Mr. 
Meadows about emails about the Elec-
toral Count Act and the prospect of 
State 
legislators 
sending 
alternate 
slates of electors to Congress, includ-
ing a November 7th, 2020, email with

attachments. We would’ve asked him 
about emails reflecting the Trump 
campaign’s effort to challenge election 
results, including a December 23rd 
email from Mr. Meadows indicating 
that, quote, ‘‘Rudy was put in charge. 
That was the President’s decision,’’ end 
quote, that reflects a direct commu-
nication between Mr. Meadows and the 
President. 
We would’ve asked him about emails 
from Mr. Meadows to leadership at the 
Department of Justice on December 
29th and 30th, 2020, and January 1st, 
2021, encouraging investigations of sus-
pected voter fraud, including claims 
that had been previously rebutted by 
State and Federal investigators and re-
jected by Federal courts. 
We would have asked Mr. Meadows 
about emails regarding the deployment 
of the National Guard on January 6th, 
including a January 5th email from Mr. 
Meadows in which he indicates that the 
Guard would be present at the Capitol 
to, quote, ‘‘protect pro Trump people,’’ 
end quote. 
In addition, we would have asked Mr. 
Meadows about specific text messages 
he sent or received that he has pro-
duced to the select committee. Given 
Mr. Meadows’ production of these text 
messages to the select committee, they 
do not, in our view, implicate any valid 
claim of executive or other privilege. 
We would’ve specifically asked Mr. 
Meadows about text messages regard-
ing efforts to encourage Republican 
legislators in certain States to send al-
ternate slates of electors to Congress, 
including a message sent by Mr. Mead-
ows on December 8th, 2020, in which 
Mr. Meadows said, quote, ‘‘We are,’’ 
end quote, and another text from Mr. 
Meadows to someone else in which he 
said that, quote, ‘‘We have a team on 
it,’’ end quote. 
We would have asked Mr. Meadows 
about text messages sent to and from 
Members of Congress, including text 
messages received from a Member of 
Congress in November of 2020 regarding 
efforts to contact State legislators be-
cause, as Mr. Meadows indicates in his 
text messages, quote, ‘‘POTUS wants 
to chat with them,’’ end quote, which 
reflects a direct communication with 
the President, as well as texts in De-
cember of 2020 regarding the prospect 
of the President’s appointment of Jef-
frey Clark as Acting Attorney General. 
We would’ve asked Mr. Meadows 
about text messages sent to and from 
another Member of Congress in Novem-
ber of 2020, in which the member indi-
cates that, quote, the President asked 
him to call Governor Ducey, end quote, 
and in which Mr. Meadows asks for 
contact information for the attorney 
general of Arizona to discuss allega-
tions of election fraud. 
We would’ve asked Mr. Meadows 
about text messages sent to and re-
ceived from Members of the House of 
Representatives and the Senate about 
objections to the certification of elec-
tors in certain States on January 6th. 
We would have asked him about text 
messages sent to and received from a 
Senator regarding the Vice President’s 
power to reject electors, including a 
text in which Mr. Meadows recounts a 
direct communication with President 
Trump who, according to Mr. Meadows 
in his text messages, quote, ‘‘thinks 
the legislators have the power, but the 
VP has power too,’’ end quote. 
We would have asked Mr. Meadows 
about text messages sent to and re-
ceived from a media personality on De-
cember 12th, 2021, regarding the nega-
tive impact of President Trump’s elec-
tion challenges on the Senate runoff 
elections 
in 
Georgia, 
President 
Trump’s prospects for election in 2024, 
and Mr. Meadows possible employment 
by a news channel. 
We would’ve asked Mr. Meadows 
about text messages sent to and re-
ceived from an organizer of the Janu-
ary 6th events on the Ellipse about 
planning the event, including details 
about who would speak at the event 
and where certain individuals would be 
located. 
We’d ask Mr. Meadows about text 
messages regarding President Trump’s 
January 2nd, 2021, phone call with 
Georgia 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Brad 
Raffensperger, including texts to and 
from participants in the call as it took 
place, as well as text messages to and 
received from Members of Congress 
after the call took place regarding 
strategy for dealing with criticism of 
the call. 
We would’ve asked Mr. Meadows 
about text messages exchanged with 
various individuals, including Members 
of Congress, on January 6th, both be-
fore, during, and after the attack on 
the United States Capitol, including 
text messages encouraging Mr. Mead-
ows to facilitate a statement by Presi-
dent Trump discouraging violence at 
the Capitol on January 6th, including a 
text exchange with a media personality 
who had encouraged the presidential 
statement asking people to, quote, 
‘‘peacefully leave the Capitol,’’ end 
quote, as well as a text sent to one of— 
by one of the President’s family mem-
bers indicating that Mr. Meadows is, 
quote, ‘‘pushing hard,’’ end quote, for a 
statement from President Trump to, 
quote, ‘‘condemn this shit,’’ end quote, 
happening at the Capitol. 
Text messages: We would ask Mr. 
Meadows questions about text mes-
sages reflecting Mr. Meadows’ skep-
ticism about public statements regard-
ing allegations of election fraud put 
forth by Sidney Powell and his skep-
ticism about the veracity of claims of 
tampering with Dominion voting ma-
chines. 
In addition, we would’ve asked Mr. 
Meadows questions about specific rep-
resentations in a book he has authored, 
The Chief’s Chief, in which he recounts 
various facts relevant to the select 
committee’s investigation and directly 
describes communications with the 
President, including on page 259, quote, 
‘‘A 
few 
sentences 
later, 
President 
Trump ad libbed a line that no one had 
seen before, saying, ‘Now it is up to 
Congress to confront this egregious as-
sault on our democracy. After this, 
we’re going to walk down—and I’ll be 
there with you—we’re going to walk 
down to the Capitol and we’re going to 
cheer on our brave Senators and Con-
gressmen and women. We’re probably 
not going to be cheering so much for 
some of them because you’ll never take 
back our country with weakness. You 
have to show strength. You have to be 
strong.’ When he got off stage, Presi-
dent Trump let me know that he had 
been speaking metaphorically about 
the walk to the Capitol. He knew as 
well as anyone that we wouldn’t orga-
nize a trip like that on such short no-
tice,’’ end quote. 
We would’ve asked Mr. Meadows 
about another passage in his book that 
appears on page 261. Quote, ‘‘In the 
aftermath of the attack, President 
Trump was mortified. He knew the 
media would take this terrible incident 
and twist it around. He also knew his 
days on Twitter were probably num-
bered,’’ end quote. 
We would’ve asked Mr. Meadows 
about another passage on page 261 in 
his book. Quote, ‘‘ ‘Mark,’ Trump would 
say to me, ‘Look, if I lost, I’d have no 
problem admitting it. I would sit back 
and retire and probably have a much 
easier life, but I didn’t lose. People 
need me to get back to work. We’re not 
done yet,’ ’’ end quote. 
We would’ve asked Mr. Meadows 
about another passage in his book on 
page 264 that reflects, quote, ‘‘On Janu-
ary 20th, with less than 5 hours left in 
his historic Presidency, at a time when 
most outgoing Presidents would be 
quietly making notes for their mem-
oirs and taking stock of their time in 
the White House, President Trump was 
being forced to defend his legacy yet 
again. ‘How do we look in Congress?’ 
President Trump asked. ‘I’ve heard 
that there are some Republicans who 
might be turning against us. That 
would be a very unwise thing for them 
to do,’ ’’ end quote. 
We would’ve asked him about an-
other passage on page 265 of his book. 
Quote, 
‘‘But 
I 
assured 
President 
Trump, once again, that all would be 
well with the impeachment trial, and 
we discussed what my role in the pro-
ceedings would be after we left the 
White House,’’ end quote. 
We would’ve asked him about the 
passage on page 266 in his book where 
he recounts, quote, ‘‘On the phone on 
January 20th, President Trump spoke 
as if he wasn’t planning to go any-
where. He mentioned the long list of 
pardons we hadn’t been able to com-
plete largely due to the slowness on the 
part of various attorneys in the Fed-
eral Government. He wondered again 
about the precise details of the im-
peachment trial, including how much 
money the new lawyers would charge 
and how we could best defend him 
against the Democrats’ attacks,’’ end 
quote. 
These passages reflect direct commu-
nications between Mr. Meadows and

President Trump directly impacting 
his claims of executive privilege. 
Finally, we would ask Mr. Meadows 
questions about statements in his book 
about his interactions with the Depart-
ment of Justice. Specifically, he ad-
dresses such interactions with the De-
partment of Justice on pages 257 and 
258 of his book, in which he says, quote, 
‘‘It didn’t surprise me that our many 
referrals to the Department of Justice 
were not seriously investigated. I never 
believed they would, given the track 
record of that Department in President 
Trump’s first term,’’ end quote. 
Again, statements in Mr. Meadows’ 
book directly reflect subject matters 
that the select committee seeks to de-
velop, and his public statements di-
rectly impact his claims of executive 
privilege. 
But, as of the current time, which is 
now 10:17, Mr. Meadows still has not 
appeared to cure his earlier noncompli-
ance with the select committee’s Sep-
tember 23rd, 2021, subpoena. So we will 
not be able to ask any of those ques-
tions about the documents and mes-
sages that he apparently agrees are rel-
evant to the select committee and not 
protected by any protective privilege. 
I’d also note for the record that Con-
gressman ADAM SCHIFF, a member of 
the select committee, has joined and, 
again, that member of the committee, 
Representative LOFGREN, has joined. 
Before we close the record, Mr. 
SCHIFF or Ms. LOFGREN, do either of 
you have any comments to make for

Honoiable Bennie G. Thompson, Chairman 
Honorable Liz Cheney., Vice Chair 
----
Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
U.S. House of Re resentatives 
Re: 
Subpoenas Served on Honornble Mark R. Meadows 
Dear Chair Thompson and Vice Chair Cheney: 
I write further to our discussions about the Select Committee's subpoena to fonner White 
House Chief of Staff Mark R. Meadows and to propose again, in greater detail, that we explore ru1 
accommodation that would allow the Select Committee to obtain useful information to further its 
legislative purpose while allowing both the Committee and Mr. Meadows to maintain their 
respective positions on relevant legal issues. We recognize that the Select Committee believes 
that it is entitled to enforce the foll scope of its subpoena. The Select Committee likewise is in a 
position to recognize that Mr. Meadows disagrees with that position. If pressed, we would expect 
that disagreement to require judicial resolution, which could take a substantial amount of time and 
resources. 
Therefore, consistent with the long tradition and practice in disputes between Congress and 
Executive Brnnch officials (both current and former), we propose below an accommodation that 
would allow the Select Committee to obtain information outside the compulsion of the subpoena 
and without requiring either side to give up its legal position. 
We propose that, as an initial step, Mr. Meadows provide written responses to written 
interrogatories from the Select Committee on a defmed set of topics, with the specific subject 
matter for questions to be discussed between the Select Committee's counsel and counsel for Iv.Ir. 
Meadows. In a letter dated November 11, 2021, which was copied to the Select Committee, the 
Office of White House Counsel informed me that President Biden is not asserting privilege over

certain categories of information within the scope of the Select Committee's inquiry. Within those 
categories, we would propose an initial focus on the following topics: 
Events on or about January 6, 2021. Mr. Meadows can provide written responses to the 
Select Committee about his conduct, activities, and communications on January 5--6, 2021, with 
the caveat that he is not able to disclose communications with or on behalf of the President, or with 
other senior White House aides, absent the former President's agreement. (As discussed further 
below, we are willing to seek that agreement in connection with specific questions or sets of 
questions concerning a particular topic). To the extent the Select Committee already has records 
of Mr. Meadows's activities from Presidential records or other sources, he is willing to provide 
context or other relevant background, consistent with the limitations described above. 
Communications with the Department of Justice. Mr. Meadows can provide written 
responses to the Select Committee about his communications with the Department of Justice 
concerning the events of January 6 and concerning other post-election issues, consistent with the 
limitations described above. 
Other Post-Election Communications. We also understand that the Select Committee is 
interested in other post-election efforts and discussions regarding the results of the election and 
allegations of election fraud, including any discussions between White House officials and state 
officials in Georgia and elsewhere. It has been publicly announced that the district attorney in 
Fulton, Georgia, has impaneled or soon will impanel a special grand jury to investigate such 
communications. We therefore would propose deferring discussion of questions on this topic until 
Mr. Meadows's status, if any, in that matter can be established. 
As indicated above, Mr. Meadows has a reasonable basis in fact and law to take the position 
that private communications that he had with or on behalf of the President, or with other senior 
White House aides, are subject to claims of Executive Privilege, as those communications lie at 
the core of Executive Privilege. Even though President Biden has purported to waive Executive 
Privilege in this regard, President Trump has instructed Mr. Meadows to maintain the privilege. It 
is not for Mr. Meadows as a witness to be forced to choose between these conflicting instructions. 
Nevertheless, as part of an effort to accommodate the Select Committee outside the compulsion of 
the subpoena, we are willing to seek the former President's agreement for Mr. Meadows to provide 
selective information through the means outlined above to the extent it would inform the Select 
Committee in furthering a valid legislative purpose. Our goal in doing so would be to avoid a 
dispute over Executive Privilege that might require lengthy and costly judicial resolution for all 
parties involved. To the extent the former President agrees, Mr. Meadows will also include that 
information in written responses to the Select Committee. 
We submit this proposal as an initial step. Our expectation would be that, after working 
through this written process and after further consultation with counsel for the Select Committee, 
Mr. Meadows could agree outside of compulsion by subpoena to appear voluntarily for a 
deposition within the parameters established through the initial process.

Thank you again for your willingness to discuss these important issues with us. We hope 
you will agree that the process outlined above can serve the interests of both pai1ies and potentially 
avoid the prospect of time-consuming and resource-intensive litigation,, all without prejudice to 
the prerogatives of the Select Committee or of Mr. Meadows as a former White House Chief of 
Staff. We will continue to stay in communication with cotmsel for the Select Committee, and if 
the Select Committee finds this proposal agreeable as an initial step, we will work quickly with 
them to identify the Select Committee,s initial interrogatories and to begin prepaiing Mr. 
Meadows's responses.

Mr. George Terwilliger III 
McGuire Woods LLP 
-· 
Dear Mr. Terwilliger, 
,November 22, 2021 
The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
("Select Committee") has received and considered the letter you sent on November 19, 2021, a 
full week after your client, Mr. Mark Meadows, failed to appear for a deposition and two weeks 
after a deadline to produce documents. 
Despite these failures, you again seek an accommodation via written interrogatories. Let 
me be clear, once more, on this issue: the Select Committee will not proceed with Mr. Meadows 
by submitting written interrogatories to him because we disagree that obtaining information from 
your client in writing is an appropriate accommodation. When Mr. Meadows first proposed 
interrogatories, he asked that the Select Committee "propound" them, but did not say that he 
would actually provide any substantive information in response.1 Now, after his failure to 
comply with the Select Committee's subpoena, he has added conditions: (1) the interrogatories 
can only ask questions about two days in January 2021 and Mr. Meadows's communications 
with the Department of Justice; and (2) Mr. Meadows will only respond to questions about his 
communications "with or on behalf of the [former] president, or with other senior White House 
aides" provided that he first obtains the former President's approval. These conditions stop short 
of an agreement to provide interrogatory responses, even if the Select Committee were inclined 
to consider them. 
The Select Committee has attempted, on many occasions, to resolve the issues you have 
r~ised about Mr. Meadows' s compliance with the Select .Committee's subpoena. At your request, 
the Select Committee agreed to move the original subpoena compliance dates. When you asked 
for an overview of topics that the Select Committee planned to raise with your client, we 
accommodated your request. When you requested further accommodations, we provided 
additional details about the questions that the Select Committee intended to pose to Mr. 
Meadows in the form of a list of 16 specific topics. When you then raised, for the first time, your 
1 Letter to Chairman Thompson from George Terwilliger dated November 8, 2021 (in connection with his proposal 
to receive interrogatories, Mr. Meadows vaguely added that he would "provide what info1mation he can and/or 
articulate clear assertions of privilege where applicable to specific questions").

suggestion of written interrogatories, the Select Committee provided a list of eight questions 
about Mr. Meadows's use of communications accounts and devices. To date, Mr. Meadows has 
never provided a meaningful response to the Select Committee's attempts at accommodation, has 
never provided any documents or any privilege log, and has not even responded to written 
questions that he himself invited. 
This history has led the Select Committee to suspect that you are simply engaged in an 
effort to delay, and that Mr. Meadows has no genuine intent to offer any testimony on any 
relevant topic. As you know, Mr. Meadows has extensive information unequivocally relevant to 
this investigation, including specific knowledge regarding former President Trump's failure for 
over three hours to demand that his supporters leave the Capitol during the violent confrontation 
on January 6th and his broader efforts to undercut the results of the fall 2020 election. Given that 
you have now for the first time identified Mr. Meadows's potential willingness to "appear 
voluntarily for a deposition," we will now supply you with that opportunity so that you can 
demonstrate that you and your client are operating in good faith. To that end, the Select 
Committee will agree to convene a deposition for your client on November 29, 2021, at 10:00 
a.m. At that deposition, the Select Committee will begin by asking questions addressing 
obviously non-privileged topics that we have raised in earlier letters.2 As indicated previously, 
we intend to ask Mr. Meadows about his communications with individuals outside of the 
executive branch, including Members of Congress, state officials, and third parties. We also 
intend to ask Mr. Meadows questions related to his use of private email accounts, cell phones, 
and other communications devices on January 6th and other relevant dates, as well as the required 
preservation of communications and other information on such accounts and devices 3 Those 
questions unequivocally call for non-privileged responses and are directly pertinent to the Select 
Committee's statutory right to obtain appropriate records from the National Archives under the 
Presidential Records Act. In short, there are multiple non-privileged subject matters within the 
scope of the Select Committee's investigation, as your most recent letter acknowledges. Again, 
we can conceive of no appropriate basis for your client's continued failure to appear and, at a 
minimum, answer these types of questions. 
Your November 19 letter does not suggest any accommodation with respect to the 
production of documents, which to date your client has not produced. As I have stated 
previously, the Select Committee expects Mr. Meadows to produce documents in his possession 
that are responsive to the schedule set forth in the subpoena, and to assert in a privilege log any 
claims of executive privilege that he believes cover such documents, and on a document-by-
document basis. To date, he has produced neither a single document nor a privilege log and, as a 
result, he remains in contempt of Congress for his failure to produce documents. Again, I have 
specifically asked Mr. Meadows to confirm his use and preservation of information contained 
within the specific cellular telephones and a personal email account mentioned above - issues 
that could not conceivably be covered by a privilege. He has failed to provide any information 
contained in those devices or accounts, or answer even those basic questions. Nonetheless, I will

provide him one final opportunity to produce documents responsive to the September 23 
subpoena and/or a privilege log. That information must be provided no later than Friday, 
November 26, 2021. 
The accommodations process regarding potential claims of executive privilege typically 
involves discussions between the executive branch and the legislative branch. Mr. Meadows 
represents neither. The current administration has not asserted claims of absolute immunity or 
executive privilege. To the contrary, the White House Counsel's Office has specifically indicated 
in its letter dated November 11 that "an assertion in this circumstance would be at odds with the 
principles that underlie the privilege."4 
Nevertheless, I have in good faith considered your concerns and have proposed a course 
of action that reflects both that consideration and the Select Committee's need for information to 
fulfill its purpose of understanding the complete picture of what led to and occurred on January 
6th, making recommendations for changes to the law that will protect our democracy, and help 
ensure that nothing like January 6th ever happens again. 
If Mr. Meadows seeks further engagement with the Select Committee in a good-faith 
effort to begin complying with the Select Committee's subpoena, he must produce documents 
and/or a privilege log by noon on Friday, November 26, 2021, and appear for his deposition at 
10:00am on Monday, November 29, 2021. If at that time, you believe that the Committee's 
questions address topics for which you intend to continue to press a privilege claim, I trust that 
you will object and we can continue discussing your privilege arguments. The Select Committee 
will defer consideration of enforcement steps regarding Mr. Meadows's non-compliance with the 
Select Committee's subpoena pending the November 26 production of documents and November 
29 deposition. 
Sincerely, 
Bennie G. Thompson

' 
Re: 
Subpoenas Se1ved on Honorable Mru.k R. Meadows 
Dear Chair Thompson and Vice Chair Cheney; 
We have reviewed and considered your letter of November 23, 2021.' We appreciate the 
efforts tl1e Select Committee has made to discuss with us in correspondence the pertinent legal 
issues raised by the Select Committee's subpoena and to articulate the Select Committee's legal 
position on those issues, which you no doubt believe in good faith to be correct. Nonetheless, your 
letter is mistaken is several mate1ial respects which I will address just briefly. 
Contrary to your suggestion that we are operating in bad faith, we have asserted the position 
that Mr. Meadows, as a former senior White House Official, is immune to being compelled to 
appear before Congress, period That is the same position taken by the Department of Justice 
tmder Administrations of both political parties on numerous occasions and in fact asserted 
forcefully by then Attorney General Janet Reno. We have also taken the position that much of the 
matters about which the Committee would inquire of Mr. Meadows are subject to Executive 
Privilege, which is both generally and specifically recognized by the courts as a valid basis for a 
witness to refuse to answer such questions. 
You state in your letter: "The accommodation process regarding potential claims of 
executive privilege typically involves discussions between the executive branch and the legislative 
branch. Mr. Meadows represents neither." We agree. Mr. Meadows has served in Congress, and 
at the times relevant to the Select Committee's inquiry. he served in the Executive Branch. But 
today, he is a private citizen. That is precisely why he, as a witness answe1ing questions which 
would require him to provide information subject to claims of Executive Privilege ru.·ising :from his

former service as Chief of Staff to President Trump, is not the person responsible for deciding 
whether to waive that privilege. In addition, I would respectfully remind you that Congress is also 
not the arbiter of Executive Privilege. Thus, while you have indicated in your letter that you 
believe there are many non-privileged subjects of inquiry that Mr. Meadows could discuss in a 
deposition, we may not agree with your assessment of the applicability of privilege to any given 
topic or specific question. When disputes about Executive Privilege arise, they are traditionally 
resolved by the Executive Branch itself, through a negotiated accommodation between Congress 
and the Executive, or through the Courts if necessary. Mr. Meadows, as a former senior White 
House aide, has no legal authority of which we are aware to unilaterally waive the privilege, nor 
is there any legal authority that obligates him to accept whatever position the Select Committee 
may take as to the scope or applicability of such privilege. 
We also understand that the Select Committee believes that President Biden is the sole 
arbiter of Executive Privilege, to the exclusion of former President Trump, over questions arising 
from President Trump's tenure. But as you know, that is a legal question that the Supreme Court 
has so far left open and the subject of a pending appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. 
Circuit. So long as that issue remains unresolved, Mr. Meadows is not in a position to disregard 
instructions from former President Trump to maintain privilege. 
Given these disagreements and unresolved legal issues, Mr. Meadows has not been able to 
appear for testimony in response to the Select Committee's subpoena. But we have nevertheless 
been and remain willing to find mutually agreeable means to share relevant information with the 
Select Committee outside the context of the testimonial subpoena. 
Contrary to your letter's characterization of our offer to compromise, however, our 
suggestion of having a voluntary interview or deposition was only to follow a successful effort to 
engage in answers to interrogatories from the Select Committee. I should note that the use of 
written interrogatories is specifically provided for in the Select Committee's authorizing 
resolution. See H. Res. 503, § 5(c)(5) ("The chair of the Select Committee is authorized to compel 
by subpoena the furnishing of information by interrogatory."). Without any substantive response 
whatsoever, you have rejected this offer out of hand. 
Nonetheless, your letter invites Mr. Meadows to appear voluntarily for a deposition to 
answer questions on what you believe to be non-privileged matters. We will agree to so appear, 
subject to the Select Committee's agreement to the following understandings and conditions: 
1. Mr. Meadows's appearance zs voluntary, that is, not subject to the compulsion of the 
subpoena of September 23, 2021. 
2 The Select Committee or its staff will in good faith limit the matters of inquiry and specific 
questions to that which it believes to be outside the scope of Executzve Przvzlege 
3. Mr Meadows, through counsel, retazns full right to declzne to answer questions that he 
believes in good faith, with the advice of counsel, would require him to answer with 
information subject to a claim of Executzve Privzlege.

advance of the session, any and all documents it intends to show or question him about in 
the session. 
5. The duration of the deposition, exclusive of any agreed upon b1·eaks or time off the record, 
will not e.-rceed 4 hours. 
6. The Select Committee will timely provide Mr. Meadows with the written record of the 
deposition. 
Your letter asks for any such appearance to occur on November 29, 2021. For .separate 
reasons as to each of us, neither Mr. Meadows nor I could appear on that date.1 In addition, that 
date, as you know, follows a traditionally long holiday weekend, and we have not received any of 
the documents that the Select Committee would like Mr. Meadows to be prepared to discuss. A 
deposition of Monday, November 29, would therefo1-e not pennit us adequate time to prepare for 
the session. We are prepared, however, to work with your staff to identify a date soon thereafter 
for Mr. Meadows to appear as outlined above. 
As to the production of docwnents pursuant to the subpoena to Mr. Meadows, whicll you 
also raised iu your letter, we are addressing that today i:11 a separate communicatio11 to the Select 
Committee. 
George J. Terwilliger ill

1 I would be happy to explain to staff orally the reasons we could not attend on that date.

Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
U.S. House of R resentatives 
Re: 
Subpoenas Served 011 Honorable Mark R. A,feadows -Request for Production of 
Documents 
Dear Chair Thompson and Vice Chair Cheney: 
On behalf of our client, the Honorable Mark R. Meadows, I write in response to the 
subpoena from the Select Committee on Finance dated September 23, 2021, and to your letter of 
November 23, 2021. As described below, Mr. Meadows is today making an initial production of 
documents in response to the subpoena and will continue working with the Select Committee to 
complete his response in a timely fashion. This initial production includes 1,139 documents and 
6,836 pages. 
As previously discussed, we believe that the vast majority of the documents responsive to 
the Select Committee's subpoena are Presidential records now in the custody and control of the 
Archivist. We have nevertheless undertaken a review of Mr. Meadows's personal devices and 
accounts to ascertain whether there are any responsive documents that remain in bis custody and 
control. Previously we committed to producing any responsive, non-privileged documents that we 
identify. The documents included in today's production were collected from Mr. Meadows's 
personal Gmail account. 
Atlanta I Austin l Baltimore I Charlotte I Charlottesville I Chicago I Dallas I Houston I Jocksonville I London I Los Angeles - Century Cuy

Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the Umted States Capital 
November 26, 2021- Documents 
Page 2 
This production is based on our careful review of all incoming and outgoing messages in 
Mr. Meadows personal Gmail account between the dates of November 3, 2020 to January 21, 
2021. In response to the Committee's focus on this time frame in its subpoena, the review was 
done for all emails in this entire date range instead of through application of more limited search 
terms, for instance. 
These documents are being produced in response to the Select Committee's subpoena. This 
letter and its attachments, any copies thereof, and any past or future correspondence regarding this 
matter, are not intended to waive any of Mr. Meadows's privileges or rights. They should not be 
construed as a waiver of any privilege or right. To the extent that we have identified responsive 
documents that are nevertheless privileged, we are providing a privilege log in connection with the 
production that identifies the documents withheld and the nature of the privileges asserted. 
The materials included in today's production are produced in electronic format and Bates 
numbered: MM00O00l through MM010784. The production file is password protected. We will 
provide instructions on accessing the production by separate email, and you should not hesitate to 
contact us should any issues arise. 
This production and our related correspondence may include sensitive personal 
information. We respectfully request that these materials, including this letter and our other 
correspondence with the Select Committee and its staff, be treated as confidential under the House 
Rules; that they be afforded the fullest protection available by law and policy; and that they be 
treated as confidential and exempt from disclosure beyond the Select Committee. The production 
of any privileged or otherwise protected information which is not responsive to the subpoena is 
unintentional, and we request the prompt return of any such information if identified or upon our 
request. We further request that confidential treatment be accorded to any notes, memoranda, or 
other records created by or at the direction of the Select Committee or employees that reflect, refer, 
or relate to this letter or to any portion of the enclosed productions. 
Please promptly inform me, at the address and phone number listed above, of any request 
seeking access to the documents or any of the above-mentioned records, including this letter, to 
enable us to substantiate the grounds for confidential treatment, unless the Select Committee 
intends to deny such request for access. At the conclusion of the Select Committee's review of the 
enclosed documents, we request that all copies be returned to me at the address above 
In addition, we will review text messages and other potentially responsive information 
from Mr. Meadows' personal cell phone. As of the date of this initial production, we have 
encountered technical challenges that have prevented us from reviewing these materials for 
potentially responsive documents. We have previously explained to staff that Mr. Meadows did 
not retain his cell phone after January 2021. However, some information may have been retained 
in the form of a backup data set from the phone. After our initial efforts to access that backup were 
unsuccessful, we have retained a new outside vendor to assist us in our efforts to access and review 
the material. We expect to have a more detailed update on the status of this data next week. We 
continue to use substantial diligence to seek to obtain any potentially responsive material.

Mr. George Terwilliger III 
McGuire Woods LLP 
-· 
Dear Mr. Terwilliger, 
The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
("Select Committee") has received and considered the letters you sent on November 26, 2021. 
One letter addressed Mr. Meadows' potential deposition testimony, and the other addressed an 
initial production of documents and a privilege log. Separately, staff for the Select Committee 
received a link from your law firm to download Mr. Meadows's initial document production that 
same day. 
The Select Committee is working to download and process the documents Mr. Meadows 
produced and will review them as soon as practicable. As your letter indicates, that production 
includes 1,139 documents and 6,836 pages that are responsive to the Select Committee's 
subpoena, as well as a privilege log describing hundreds more responsive documents that Mr. 
Meadows has withheld. I understand that this is an initial production, and that you are working to 
provide additional responsive documents including text messages taken from a personal cell 
phone that Mr. Meadows used during the relevant timeframe. Mr. Meadows' production and 
privilege log comes well after the original and revised dates by which he was required to produce 
documents: October 7 and November 5, respectively. Given this delay and for the reasons stated 
below, I request that you complete the remaining production expeditiously, and no later than 
Friday, December 3, 2021. 
In addition, the Select Committee is encouraged to hear that Mr. Meadows is interested in 
appearing for deposition testimony without further delay. I understand the extenuating 
circumstances for your request that we schedule the deposition for the week of December 6. I am 
willing to accommodate your request, provided that you complete production of documents from 
Mr. Meadows no later than Friday, December 3, 2021. More specifically, the Select Committee 
will convene a deposition on Wednesday, December 8, 2021, at 10:00 a.m. The deposition will 
be conducted pursuant to H. Res. 503, section 3(b) ofH. Res. 8, and the Rules of the House of 
Representatives. Specifically, Mr. Meadows will be placed under oath to answer questions posed 
by staff and Members of the Select Committee. He will answer the questions asked or 
specifically articulate a privilege or other objection to such questions. As Chairman of the Select

Committee, I will consider and may rule upon those objections, as provided by the Rules of the 
House of Representatives. For your reference, I have enclosed the House Deposition Authority 
Regulations. 
During the deposition, counsel and Members of the Select Committee will ask questions 
of your client that are relevant to the Select Committee's investigation. To be clear, the Select 
Committee's view of applicable executive privilege will be consistent with the prior letters that 
we have sent to you as well as the November 11, 2021, White House letter addressed to Mr. 
Meadows. Our hope is that Mr. Meadows will answer all questions put forth during the 
deposition. If, however, the Select Committee's questions address topics which you believe are 
protected by privilege, you will state such privilege objection on the record. After the deposition 
concludes, we will have a specific record on which to base continued discussion of your 
privilege claims. 
The Select Committee hopes to limit the number of times Mr. Meadows must appear for 
testimony, but also recognizes that it might be necessary to continue the deposition to address 
issues that are not covered in this deposition, such as areas where you assert some executive-
privilege-based objection that is later resolved. At this deposition, Select Committee staff will 
raise, in good faith, all relevant topics with Mr. Meadows in order to both obtain information that 
is relevant and necessary to its inquiry and narrow the scope of questions to which Mr. Meadows 
objects. If Mr. Meadows is forthcoming and cooperative, this process may take more than four 
hours, and the Select Committee cannot agree to such a time limit. 
The Select Committee will endeavor to provide you, as counsel for Mr. Meadows, access 
to the nonpublic documents that it intends to show or question him about during the deposition 
that the Select Committee has received from sources other than your document production, 
provided that both you and Mr. Meadows agree to keep the documents confidential and not 
produce them, or otherwise disclose their contents, to any third parties. As noted above, it is 
imperative that we receive a complete production of documents from Mr. Meadows by 
December 3. This production must include, but not be limited to, production of text messages 
and other information contained in Mr. Meadows' personal cellular device(s). The Select 
Committee is also willing to provide access to the written record of the deposition upon the 
completion of the deposition pursuant to House rules. 
I trust that Mr. Meadows' stated position indicates a willingness to cooperate with the 
Select Committee. If so, he must complete his document production by Friday, December 3, 
2021, and appear for a deposition at 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday, December 8, 2021. As was true 
in the letter that I sent dated November 22, 2021, the Select Committee will defer consideration 
of enforcement steps regarding Mr. Meadows' non-compliance with the Select Committee's 
September 23, 2021, subpoena pending the December 8, 2021, deposition.

Re: 
Subpoenas Served on Honorable Mark R Meadows -Request for Production of 
Documents 
Dear Chair Thompson and Vice Chair Cheney: 
On behalf of our client, the Honorable Mark R. Meadows, I write in response to the 
subpoena from the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States 
Capitol dated September 23, 2021, and to your letter of November 23, 2021. As described below, 
Mr. Meadows is today making a continuing production of documents in response to the subpoena. 
This production includes 2,319 documents and 2,514 pages. For text messages withheld as 
privileged, there are 38 text message threads with attorney-client privilege and 23 text message 
threads with executive privilege. 
Previously we committed to producing any responsive, non-privileged documents that we 
identify. The documents included in today's production were collected primarily from backup data 
from Mr. Meadows' s personal devices. As we have previously explained, Ivir. Meadows no longer 
has his personal cell phone available to him; this production is based on all remaining available 
data from that device.

This production is based on our careful review of all incoming and outgoing text messages 
in Mr. Meadows's custody or control between the dates of November 3, 2020 to January 21, 2021 
as well as any available attachments or other identifiable documents from Mr. Meadows's personal 
computer. In response to the Select Committee's focus on this time frame in its subpoena, the 
review was done for all text messages in this entire date range instead of through application of 
more limited search terms, for instance. 
These documents are being produced in response to the Select Committee's subpoena. This 
letter and its attachments, any copies thereof, and any past or future correspondence regarding this 
matter, are not intended to waive any of Mr. Meadows's privileges or rights. They should not be 
construed as a waiver of any privilege or right. To the extent that we have identified responsive 
documents that are nevertheless privileged, we are providing a privilege log in connection with the 
production that identifies the documents withheld and the nature of the privileges asserted. 
The materials included in today's production are produced in electronic format and Bates 
numbered: MM010785 through MM015356. '!;he production file is password protected. We will 
provide instructions on accessing the production by separate email, and you should not hesitate to 
contact us should any issues arise. 
Today Mr. Meadows is also producing some non-privileged, responsive emails and 
attachments that were recovered from his personal computer. Most communications recovered 
from this device were associated with his personal email account. Thus, we have previously 
reviewed for responsiveness and privilege and produced appropriate communications to the 
Select Committee. Any responsive, nonprivileged documents not previously reviewed are being 
produced today. This production includes 20 documents in 42 pages. 
As with the initial production, this production and our related correspondence may include 
sensitive personal information. We respectfully request that these materials, including this letter 
and our other correspondence with the Select Committee and its staff, be treated as confidential 
under the House Rules; that they be afforded the fullest protection available by law and policy; 
and that they be treated as confidential and exempt from disclosure beyond the Select Committee. 
The production of any privileged or otherwise protected information which is not responsive to 
the subpoena is unintentional, and we request the prompt return of any such information if 
identified or upon our request. We further request that confidential treatment be accorded to any 
notes, memoranda, or other records created by or at the direction of the Select Committee or 
employees that reflect, refer, or relate to this letter or to any portion of the enclosed productions. 
Please promptly inform me, at the address and phone number listed above, of any request 
seeking access to the documents or any of the above-mentioned records, including this letter, to 
enable us to substantiate the grounds for confidential treatment, unless the Select Committee 
intends to deny such request for access. At the conclusion of the Select Committee's review of the 
enclosed documents, we request that all copies be returned to me at the address above.

Re: 
Subpoenas Served on Honorable Mark R. Meadows 
Dear Chair Thompson and Vice Chair Cheney; 
Over the last several weeks, Mr. Meadows has consistently sought iu good faith to pursue 
an accommodation with the Select Committee and up until yesterday we believed that could be 
obtained vVe acted on the belief that the Select Committee would receive, also in good faith, 
relevant, responsive but non-privileged facts. We have consistently communicated to the Select 
Committee that Mr. Meadows is precluded from making a unilateral decision to waive Executive 
Privilege claims asserted by the fonner president. 
We agreed to provide thousands of pages of responsive documents and Mr. Meadows was 
willing to appear voluntarily, not under compulsion of the Select Committee's subpoena to him, 
for a deposition to answer questions about non-privileged matters. Now actions by the Select 
Committee have made such an appearance untenable. In short, we now have every indication from 
the information supplied to us last Friday - upon which Mr. Meadows could expect to be 
questioned - that the Select Committee has no intention of respecting boundaries concerning 
Executive Privilege. In addition, we learned over the weekend that the Select Committee had, 
without even the basic couitesy of notice to us, issued wide ranging ~ubpoenas for information 
from a third patfy communications provider without regard to either the broad breadth of the 
infonnation sought, which would include intensely personal communications of no moment to any 
legitimate matters of interest to the Select Committee, nor to the potentially privileged status of 
the infonnation demanded. Moreover, Mr. Chahman, your recent comments in regard to another

witness that his assertion of 5th Amendment rights before the Select Committee is tantamount to 
an admission of guilt calls into question for us what we had hoped would be the Select Committee's 
commitment to fimdamental fairness in dealing with witnesses. 
As a result of careful and deliberate consideration of these factors, we now must decline 
the opportunity to appear voluntaiily for a deposition. It is well-established that Congress's 
subpoena authority is limited to the pmsuit of a legitimate legislative pmpose. Congress has no 
authority to conduct law enforcement investigations or free-standing "fact findini' missions. Even 
wbere there is a legislative purpose, requests that implicate the Separation of Powers by targeting 
current or fo1mer Executive officials must be narrowly tailored. Yet again, with the breadth of its 
subpoenas and its pugnacious approach, the Select Committee has made clear that it does not 
intend to respect these important constitutional limits.

Mr. Meadows proudly served as Chief of Staff to President Tnunp and in that role assmned 
responsibility to protect Executive Privilege dming and after bis tenure. He assumed that 
responsibility not for his own benefit but for the benefit of all those who will serve after him, 
including future presidents. His appreciation for our constitutional system and for the Separation 
of Powers dictates that he cam10t voluntarily appear under these circumstances. Nonetbeless, as 
we have before, we reiterate our willingness to consider an interrogatory process of Select 
Committee written questions and answers from Mr. Meadows so that there might be both an 
orderly process and a clear record of questions and related assertions of privilege where 
appropriate. 
Sincerely yours, 
George J. Terwilliger ill

Mr. George Terwilliger III 
McGuire Woods LLP 
Dear Mr. Terwilliger: 
December 7, 2021 
The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol 
("Select Committee") is in receipt of your letter dated December 7, 2021, regarding your client, 
Mr. Mark Meadows. Your letter confirms that, despite our prior efforts to facilitate a deposition 
for Mr. Meadows, he does not intend to cooperate with the Select Committee. 
As you no doubt recall, on November 22, 2021, I sent you a letter which explained to you 
that Mr. Meadows had wholly failed to comply with the subpoena that the Select Committee issued 
to him on September 23, 2021, and offered him, in good faith, a course of action that would cure 
his previous non-compliance. That course required Mr. Meadows to produce documents and 
appear for a deposition. 
Mr. Meadows has produced documents. On November 26, 2021, Mr. Meadows provided 
to the Select Committee certain documents that you obtained from Mr. Meadows's personal email 
account and determined were responsive to the Select Committee's subpoena. In doing so, you 
also provided a privilege log indicating that you withheld several hundred additional documents 
from Mr. Meadows' s personal email account based on claims of executive, attorney-client, or other 
privilege. Despite your very broad claims of privilege, Mr. Meadows has also produced documents 
that you apparently agree are relevant and not protected by any privilege at all. Those documents 
include: a November 7, 2020, email discussing the appointment of alternate slates of electors as 
part of a "direct and collateral attack'' after the election; a January 5, 2021, email regarding a 38-
page PowerPoint briefing titled "Election Fraud, Foreign Interference & Options for 6 JAN" that 
was to be provided "on the hill"; and, among others, a January 5, 2021, email about having the 
National Guard on standby. 
Then, on December 3, 2021, you provided to the Select Committee certain relevant 
messages that you obtained from saved and backed up phone data from Mr. Meadows's personal 
cell phone. According to representations made to us, Mr. Meadows reportedly turned in this 
personal device to his cell phone provider in the weeks following January 6, 2021. You also 
produced a privilege log indicating that you withheld over 1,000 text messages from Mr. 
Meadows's personal cell phone based on similarly broad claims of executive, attorney-client, and 
other privileges. The text messages you did produce include a November 6, 2020, text exchange

with a Member of Congress apparently about appointing alternate electors in certain states as part 
of a plan that the Member acknowledged would be "highly controversial" and to which Mr. 
Meadows apparently said, "I love it"; an early January 2021 text message exchange between Mr. 
Meadows and an organizer of the January 6th rally on the Ellipse; and text messages about the 
need for the former President to issue a public statement that could have stopped the January 6th 
attack on the Capitol. 
All of those documents raise issues about which the Select Committee would like to 
question Mr. Meadows and about which you appear to agree are not subject to a claim of privilege. 
Yet, despite your recent agreement to have Mr. Meadows to come in and answer questions in a 
deposition, Mr. Meadows now, once again, refuses to do so. In your December 7, 2021, letter, you 
specifically indicated that Mr. Meadows's refusal to appear is motivated by, among other things, 
the documents that Select Committee staff provided to you in advance, pursuant to your request 
for an accommodation. You go on to suggest that those documents somehow indicate that the 
"Select Committee has no intention of respecting boundaries concerning Executive Privilege." 
That assertion runs counter to the stated purpose of the December 8, 2021, deposition, which was 
to give Mr. Meadows a chance to answer the Select Committee's questions or assert and articulate 
a specific privilege he believes protects that information from disclosure. 
Indeed, the Select Committee has tried repeatedly to identify with specificity the areas of 
inquiry that Mr. Meadows believes are protected by a claim of executive privilege, but neither you 
nor Mr. Meadows has meaningfully provided that information. As a result, and as I have said 
numerous times, the Select Committee planned to ask Mr. Meadows questions during a deposition 
that are relevant to the investigation, while giving Mr. Meadows the opportunity to answer those 
questions or assert a claim of privilege on a question-by-question basis. That is not a lack ofrespect 
for the boundaries of executive privilege but rather an appreciation for the proper process for 
asserting any protective privilege. 
It is also worth noting that your identification of executive privilege issues with documents 
that came from Mr. Meadows' personal email account and personal cell phone raises the question 
of whether these materials have been transferred to the National Archives in compliance with the 
Presidential Records Act. 
In your December 7, 2021, letter, you also cite "wide ranging subpoenas for information 
from a third party communications provider" that the Select Committee has issued "without regard 
to either the breadth of the information sought ... nor to the potentially privileged status of the 
information demanded." I assume that this representation refers to the Select Committee's 
compulsion of call data records regarding particular cellular telephone numbers. Contrary to your 
assertion, that information does not implicate privilege, but rather concerns the date, time, and 
dialing information about calls and messages sent or received by the specific phone numbers 
indicated on the subpoena. Moreover, production of that information does not impact Mr. 
Meadows's production of documents and text messages, which are the areas we seek to develop 
during his deposition tomorrow. 
Finally, you reference news accounts regarding another witness's "assertion of 5th 
Amendment rights before the Select Committee" and claim that my comments suggest that a

Page 3 
witness's assertion of 5th Amendment rights is "tantamount to an admission of guilt." That is not 
an accurate characterization of my position on the 5th Amendment, nor is that interpretation of my 
comments consistent with our discussions about the purpose of tomorrow's deposition - i.e., a 
proceeding in which your client can assert privilege claims with sufficient particularity for further 
consideration. The Select Committee is trying to ascertain facts that place the January 6th attack 
on the Capitol in context, not conduct a law enforcement inquiry. If you appear, the Select 
Committee would consider and evaluate your assertion of any privilege. Your failure to do so 
prevents that evaluation, which brings us once again to a consideration of enforcement options. 
This occurs at the same time Mr. Meadows has published a book in which he discusses the January 
6th attack. That he would sell his telling of the facts of that day while denying a congressional 
committee the opportunity to ask him about the attack on our Capitol marks an historic and 
aggressive defiance of Congress. 
In summary, on November 12, 2021, Mr. Meadows failed to appear for the deposition 
required by the Select Committee's subpoena. On November 22, 2021, the Select Committee gave 
Mr. Meadows an opportunity to cure his non-compliance by appearing for a deposition, which was 
ultimately scheduled for December 8, 2021. Now, the day before the deposition, Mr. Meadows 
has rejected the opportunity to cure his non-compliance and made it clear that he does not intend 
to participate in a deposition. There is no legitimate legal basis for Mr. Meadows to refuse to 
cooperate with the Select Committee and answer questions about the documents he produced, the 
personal devices and accounts he used, the events he wrote about in his newly released book, 1 and, 
among other things, his other public statements. The Select Committee is left with no choice but 
to advance contempt proceedings and recommend that the body in which Mr. Meadows once 
served refer him for criminal prosecution. 
Sincerely, 
Bennie G. Thompson

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7785 
December 14, 2021 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, by direction of the 
Select Committee to Investigate the 
January 6th Attack on the United 
States Capitol, I call up the resolution 
(H. Res. 851) recommending that the 
House of Representatives find Mark 
Randall Meadows in contempt of Con-
gress for refusal to comply with a sub-
poena duly issued by the Select Com-
mittee to Investigate the January 6th 
Attack on the United States Capitol, 
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 848, the resolu-
tion is considered read. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 851 
Resolved, That Mark Randall Meadows 
shall be found to be in contempt of Congress 
for failure to comply with a congressional 
subpoena. 
Resolved, That pursuant to 2 U.S.C. §§ 192 
and 194, the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives shall certify the report of the 
Select Committee to Investigate the Janu-
ary 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, 
detailing the refusal of Mark Randall Mead-
ows to appear for a deposition before the Se-
lect Committee to Investigate the January 
6th Attack on the United States Capitol as 
directed by subpoena, to the United States 
Attorney for the District of Columbia, to the 
end that Mr. Meadows be proceeded against 
in the manner and form provided by law. 
Resolved, That the Speaker of the House 
shall otherwise take all appropriate action 
to enforce the subpoena. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided among and controlled 
by the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
THOMPSON) and the gentlewoman from 
Wyoming (Ms. CHENEY), and an oppo-
nent, or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
THOMPSON), the gentlewoman from Wy-
oming (Ms. CHENEY), and the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. BANKS) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Mississippi.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members may have 5 leg-
islative days within which to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, it is regrettable 
that we are back on the floor consid-
ering another criminal contempt refer-
ral, but our former colleague, Mr. 
Meadows, has left us no choice. 
The 
select 
committee 
is 
inves-
tigating an attack on our democracy, 
and it is essential that witnesses co-
operate with our investigation to get 
answers. The law requires them to do 
so. And when a witness defies the law, 
that amounts to more than obstructing 
our investigation, it is an attack on 
the rule of law. 
In September, the select committee 
subpoenaed Mr. Meadows for records 
and testimony because we believed he 
had information relevant to our inves-
tigation. 
For weeks, we went back and forth 
with Mr. Meadows, through his lawyer, 
to try to get cooperation. We extended 
his initial deposition date to November 
12. When the date came, he hadn’t pro-
duced any documents, and he didn’t 
show up. Throughout this time, Mr. 
Meadows and his representatives made 
a lot of noise about executive privilege 
and so-called absolute immunity; the 
idea that people who serve or served in 
certain senior roles are completely ex-
empt from testifying before Congress. 
Now, let’s be clear. Courts have re-
jected absolute immunity at every op-
portunity, and the Justice Department 
has never authored an opinion that 
would support the sort of claim Mr. 
Meadows had made about his unofficial 
conduct. And we have lots of questions 
for Mr. Meadows about the unofficial 
conduct. And as for executive privilege, 
President Biden has chosen not to in-
voke it as far as Mr. Meadows is con-
cerned. 
So Mr. Meadows was obligated to 
comply with our subpoena and appear 
at a deposition. When he didn’t, we 
were prepared at that point to move 
ahead with contempt proceedings. But 
at the same time, Madam Speaker, out 
of an abundance of fairness, we gave 
Mr. Meadows a final chance to cooper-
ate. 
When he faced the possibility of con-
tempt a few weeks ago, he finally de-
cided, in part, to do the right thing and 
start providing information. He turned 
over roughly 9,000 pages of records that 
he himself said couldn’t be covered by 
any claim of privilege. He also said he 
would appear at a deposition with the 
select committee, which we scheduled 
for December 8. 
This is key. In an investigation like 
ours, when you produce records, you 
are expected to come in and answer 
questions about those records. And be-
cause not even Mr. Meadows was as-
serting any privilege claim over these 
records, there is no possible justifica-
tion for wholesale refusing to answer 
questions about them. 
But that is what he did. He told us 
the day before his deposition—the same 
day his book was published—that he 
would no longer cooperate with our in-
vestigation, and that he wasn’t coming 
in to be interviewed. 
Put all the other arguments aside. 
This isn’t about any sort of privilege or 
immunity. This is about Mr. Meadows 
refusing to comply with a subpoena to 
discuss the records he himself turned 
over. Now he is hiding behind excuses. 
And at the end of the day, it is a sim-
ple proposition: If you are making ex-
cuses to avoid cooperating with our in-
vestigations, you are making excuses 
to hide the truth from the American 
people about what happened on Janu-
ary 6. You are making excuses as part 
of a coverup. And if you echo these ex-
cuses, if you base your arguments on 
these excuses, if you adopt these ex-
cuses as your own to explain why you 
will not take action, then you are part 
of that coverup, too. 
I want my colleagues to think long 
and hard about that; because as the se-
lect committee has made clear in the 
last day and will continue to make 
clear, there was a steady stream of 
communication between certain Mem-
bers of Congress and Mr. Meadows 
about matters central to our investiga-
tion. 
We have questions about those com-
munications. We will pursue those 
questions. And we won’t let the facts 
be buried by a coverup. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
as 
Chairman 
THOMPSON
noted, we are here with 
great sadness. We are here recognizing 
and understanding the serious nature 
of this situation. And, Madam Speaker, 
we wish we had another alternative. 
We wish that we did not have to meet 
today to urge our colleagues to vote 
criminal contempt for one of our 
former colleagues and the former chief 
of staff to President Trump. 
We don’t take this step lightly. 
As my colleagues have noted, and 
will no doubt say again today, for 
weeks the committee has worked with 
Mr. Meadows, with his counsel to reach 
an agreement on cooperation, to reach 
an agreement and accommodation. 
Now, the reality, Madam Speaker, is 
the accommodations process is a proc-
ess that takes place between the legis-
lative branch and the executive branch. 
Mr. Meadows is a member of neither, 
and yet, the committee has taken the 
extra step of working to try to make 
sure that we do everything we can to 
secure Mr. Meadows’ testimony. 
He is improperly asserting executive 
and other privileges, but the vote on 
contempt today relates principally to 
his refusal to testify about messages 
and other communications that he ad-
mits are not privileged. He has not 
claimed, and he does not have, privi-
lege to refuse entirely to testify re-
garding these topics. 
There are just three examples I will 
give you this afternoon of issues which 
we need to speak to Mr. Meadows about 
and on which his testimony is required, 
indeed compelled by our subpoena. 
First, is President Trump’s failure to 
stop the violence when this Chamber, 
and indeed, the entire Capitol building 
was attacked and invaded. The mob 
that attacked this Chamber was sum-
moned to Washington by President 
Trump. And as many of those involved 
have admitted on videotape and social

H7786 
December 14, 2021 
media and in Federal District Court, 
they were provoked to violence by 
President Trump’s false claims that 
the election was stolen. 
As the violence unfolded that after-
noon, nearly 1 year ago, it was evident 
to all, not only to those of us who were 
in the Chamber at that time. It was 
covered in real time by almost every 
news channel. But for 187 minutes, 
President Trump refused to act. Let’s 
let that sink in, Madam Speaker. He 
refused to act. When action by our 
President was required, it was essen-
tial, and it was compelled by his oath 
to our Constitution. 
Mr. Meadows received numerous text 
messages which he has produced with-
out any privilege claim imploring that 
Mr. Trump take the specific action we 
all know his duty required. Indeed, 
some of those text messages, Madam 
Speaker, came from Members in the 
Chamber right now, Members who un-
derstood that a violent assault was un-
derway at the Capitol, Members who 
pleaded with the chief of staff to get 
the President to take action. Dozens of 
texts, including from Trump adminis-
tration officials and Members of Con-
gress urged that the President take im-
mediate action. 
I read a number of these last night at 
our hearing. I won’t read them all 
today, but I will read a few of them. 
‘‘Mark,’’ one Member said: ‘‘he needs to 
stop this. Now.’’ In all caps: ‘‘TELL 
THEM TO GO HOME.’’ ‘‘POTUS has to 
come out firmly and tell the protestors 
to dissipate. Someone is going to get 
killed.’’ 
Indeed, a number of members of the 
press, a number of Members of this 
body, a member of the President’s own 
family, all urged the President to take 
action because they understood that 
the President of the United States had 
a responsibility to call off the mob. 
Hours passed despite this without 
any action by the President. All of 
these texts are nonprivileged. They are 
texts that Mr. Meadows has turned 
over. And they are evidence of Presi-
dent Trump’s supreme dereliction of 
duty for 187 minutes. And Mr. Mead-
ows’ testimony will bear on another 
fundamental question before this com-
mittee, and that is whether Donald J. 
Trump, through action or inaction, 
corruptly sought to obstruct or impede 
Congress’ official proceeding to count 
electoral votes. 
This committee is entitled to Mr. 
Meadows’ testimony, and it will inform 
our legislative judgments. But Mr. 
Meadows has refused to give any testi-
mony at all, even regarding nonprivi-
leged topics. He is in contempt of Con-
gress. 
Second, Mr. Meadows has knowledge 
regarding President Trump’s efforts to 
persuade State officials to alter official 
election results. 
In Georgia, for instance, Mr. Mead-
ows participated in a phone call be-
tween President Trump and the Geor-
gia secretary of state. Mr. Meadows 
was actually on the phone when Presi-
dent Trump asked the secretary of 
state to ‘‘find 11,780 votes’’ to change 
the results of the Presidential election 
in Georgia. That is the President of the 
United States telling a State official to 
‘‘find 11,780 votes.’’ 
While this was happening, Mr. Mead-
ows appears to have been texting with 
another participant on this call. Mr. 
Meadows has no conceivable privilege 
basis to refuse to testify on this topic. 
He is in contempt of Congress. 
Third, in the weeks before January 6, 
President Trump’s appointees at the 
Justice Department informed him re-
peatedly that the President’s claims of 
election fraud were not supported by 
the evidence and that the election was 
not, in fact, stolen. 
President Trump intended to appoint 
Jeffrey Clark as attorney general in 
part so that Mr. Clark could alter the 
Department of Justice’s conclusions re-
garding the election. Mr. Clark has 
now informed this committee that he 
anticipates potential criminal prosecu-
tion related to these matters and, 
therefore, intends in upcoming testi-
mony to invoke his Fifth Amendment 
privilege against self-incrimination. 
As Mr. Meadows’ nonprivileged texts 
reveal, Mr. Meadows communicated 
multiple times with another Member of 
this body who was working with Mr. 
Clark. Mr. Meadows has no basis to 
refuse to testify regarding those com-
munications. He is in contempt. 
January 6 was without precedent. 
There has been no stronger case in our 
Nation’s history for a congressional in-
vestigation into the actions of a former 
President. This body must investigate 
the facts in detail, and we are entitled 
to ask Mr. Meadows about the non-
privileged materials he has produced to 
us. 
Madam Speaker, I am sure you will 
hear my colleagues this afternoon say 
that there are privilege issues here 
that must be resolved before we can 
move forward. Any argument that the 
courts need to resolve privilege issues 
first is a pretext. We will question Mr. 
Meadows about emails and texts he 
gave us without any privilege claim. 
Mr. 
Meadows’ 
role 
in 
the 
Raffensperger call cannot be privi-
leged, nor can his dealings with a Mem-
ber of this body regarding Jeff Clark. 
This committee must get to the objec-
tive truth and ensure that January 6 
never happens again. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Meadows is in 
contempt. He must testify. And I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this 
resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, here we go again. 
For the first time in history, Demo-
crats have complete control over a se-
lect committee. I hope the American 
people are paying close attention. I 
hope they see what happens when 
Democrats get total power. They abuse 
it. They intimidate, they threaten, and 
they harass. And they try to put their 
political opponents in jail. 
b 1630 
In a matter of weeks, the committee 
has passed three criminal contempt ci-
tations. Today, we vote on holding 
Mark Meadows in contempt of Con-
gress. 
On September 23, 2021, the select 
committee served former Congressman 
Meadows a subpoena for a sweeping set 
of documents and a deposition. In Octo-
ber, President Trump instructed Mr. 
Meadows to maintain his executive 
privilege in any response to that sub-
poena. Mr. Meadows then told the se-
lect committee that he would give 
them any information they requested 
that wasn’t protected by executive 
privilege. 
Mr. Meadows gave the select com-
mittee over 6,800 pages of information, 
including 1,100 documents and 2,300 
text messages. Mr. Meadows agreed to 
sit for a deposition if it was limited to 
areas not protected by executive privi-
lege. He tried to cooperate, but the se-
lect committee didn’t care. 
Mr. Meadows even sought an inde-
pendent ruling on the question of exec-
utive privilege, but the select com-
mittee voted to hold him in contempt 
anyway, just like they did with Mr. 
Clark, who offered to participate pend-
ing the Supreme Court’s decision in 
Trump v. Thompson. 
Apparently, the select committee’s 
rules go like this: Ignore the former 
President and don’t wait for legal rul-
ings. Immediately do everything that 
we say without objection, or we will 
refer you for criminal prosecution. 
They don’t care about fairness or due 
process. The point isn’t cooperation or 
factfinding. They care about punish-
ment. The point is prosecution. And, of 
course, the point is the headline that 
they are going for: Former Trump 
Chief of Staff found in contempt of 
Congress. But that headline omits the 
ugly and partisan truth about the se-
lect committee. 
According to the committee’s char-
ter, H. Res. 503: ‘‘The Speaker shall ap-
point 13 Members to the select com-
mittee, five of whom shall be appointed 
after consultation with the minority 
leader.’’ But the committee has zero 
members appointed in consultation 
with Leader MCCARTHY. And it doesn’t 
have 13 members; it has 9. 
According to the committee’s char-
ter, if Mr. Meadows had come in for a 
deposition, the minority must have 
been allowed to question Mr. Meadows 
for the same length of time as the ma-
jority, except no members of the com-
mittee were named by the minority. 
This isn’t nitpicking. The Supreme 
Court has found that a select com-
mittee must follow its own rules to act 
with legal force. 
So we have the select committee as 
it exists legally and on paper, and then 
we have something completely dif-
ferent. I don’t know what to call it, but 
it doesn’t resemble the select com-
mittee that Democrats voted to pass

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7787 
December 14, 2021 
on the House floor. It is just nine mem-
bers picked by Speaker PELOSI. 
The group is trampling on Ameri-
cans’ constitutional rights and the 
rights of Congress, like Mr. Meadows, 
and current Members of Congress. They 
even include Americans whose sole of-
fense, according to Chairman THOMP-
SON, was planning a legal, permitted, 
and First Amendment-protected polit-
ical rally. 
Thanks to media reports, we know 
that Democrats have seized their en-
emies’ 
call 
and 
text 
records, 
geolocation data, and personal con-
tacts. We know of hundreds of in-
stances. It could be more. 
All we know for sure about this par-
tisan investigation is that it is mas-
sive. It is happening without account-
ability, and it is happening in secret. 
The select committee should serve as 
a warning to all Americans. This is 
what you get when Democrats get free 
rein: secret snooping, harassment, con-
tempt for the rules of Congress, crim-
inalization of dissent, and it all ends 
with their opponents in jail. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER), the distinguished majority 
leader of the House. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, every Member of 
the House ought to vote for this resolu-
tion—every one of you. I see one shak-
ing their head vigorously ‘‘no.’’ 
For those of us who have been here 
for some time, we have seen extraor-
dinary energy exercised by the other 
side of the aisle in conducting over-
sight. Mr. Burton from Indiana sum-
moned tens and tens more and ten 
thereafter, on and on and on, to hold 
accountable an administration with 
whom he did not agree and thought was 
not doing the right thing. And he 
issued subpoena after subpoena after 
subpoena. 
The reason I say every one of us 
ought to vote for this is because this 
institution needs this power. This in-
stitution is charged under the Con-
stitution with protecting the welfare of 
the American people and expanding the 
opportunities of our people. 
To do so, as the gentlewoman from 
Wyoming has observed, we need to 
gather information, and in the conduct 
of gathering that information, it must 
be our ability to compel people to tes-
tify, to come before the Congress of the 
United States and tell us facts that we 
need. 
Now, my Republican friends, when 
they were in charge, thought there was 
some type of wrongdoing, which re-
sulted in the loss of four lives, trag-
ically, in Benghazi, Libya. They had 
eight separate hearings on that issue, 
the last of which was the select com-
mittee led by Trey Gowdy of South 
Carolina. Every one of those commit-
tees reached the same conclusion, but 
there were eight of them. 
Madam Speaker, perhaps some of my 
Republican friends will recall that Hil-
lary Clinton, the Secretary of State 
during that time, appeared for 11 hours 
before one of these committees, the se-
lect committee. 
Madam Speaker, I have a speech here 
that deals with what the gentleman 
from North Carolina, Mr. Meadows, has 
done. I have chosen not to give this 
speech because the issue, in my view, is 
not what Meadows has done, but clear-
ly in contempt, as the gentlewoman 
from Wyoming pointed out so factu-
ally, but it is about this institution, 
about whether or not a President or 
anybody else can simply say, ‘‘I will 
not testify,’’ and then take months and 
months and months. 
Now, the gentleman who just spoke, 
the gentleman from Indiana, laments 
the fact that we have this committee. 
But the gentleman from Indiana voted 
against forming an equally numbered 
committee to be set up to adjudge this 
issue. He voted against that, as did his 
Republican colleagues, save a few. And 
now he comes and says, Oh, my good-
ness, this is not what I wanted. But 
like so many of his colleagues, he voted 
against what he says he wanted. 
Madam Speaker, the gentleman from 
Indiana who just spoke voted against 
holding in contempt Steve Bannon not 
because of any executive privilege. He 
was a private citizen, not a member of 
the President’s Cabinet. And the gen-
tleman from Indiana voted against 
having him honor a subpoena of the 
Congress of the United States. 
Yes, it ought to be noted that, at the 
time of the insurrection, we had a vote 
on whether to confirm what court after 
court after court had said was a legiti-
mate election. He voted against certi-
fying the election of the President of 
the United States. So I am not sur-
prised that the gentleman from Indiana 
does not want to see this subpoena hon-
ored because, Madam Speaker, I be-
lieve that he fears the information that 
would be brought forward. Fearing the 
truth is not an excuse for not honoring 
a subpoena of this Congress. 
So, again, it is not just simply the 
actions of Mr. Meadows that are at 
issue here. What is at issue here is 
what power does the Congress have to 
get the information it needs—in this 
case, the most important information 
it needs to achieve one of its most im-
portant objectives, which the gentle-
woman from Wyoming has not only 
talked about but has shown extraor-
dinary courage in standing up to her 
party. She is, after all, the former 
chair of the Republican Conference, the 
daughter of a Vice President of the 
United States and former Secretary of 
Defense and former minority whip of 
this House, who has shown extraor-
dinary courage in the face of almost 
united opposition on her side of the 
aisle, leading to her removal from the 
position she held. 
Would that all of us all the time have 
the courage of our convictions that the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Wyoming 
has 
shown. 
So I say to my colleagues, all 434 or 
433 of us here—— 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, par-
liamentary privilege. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the 
gentleman from Maryland yield? 
Mr. HOYER. I do not yield. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland is recognized. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, point 
of order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his point of order. 
Mr. PERRY. It seems to me that my 
friend, the gentleman from Maryland, 
disparaged the gentleman from Indiana 
here personally and should have his 
words taken down. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman making a demand that 
words be taken down? 
Mr. PERRY. Yes, I am. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland will be seated. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the words. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
So I am not surprised that the gentleman 
from Indiana does not want to see this sub-
poena honored. Because, Madam Speaker, I 
believe that he fears the information that 
would be brought forward. Fearing the truth 
is not an excuse for not honoring a subpoena 
of this Congress. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair is prepared to rule. 
The words of the gentleman from 
Maryland contain an allegation that 
the gentleman from Indiana fears the 
truth. Comparing the remarks to the 
precedents memorialized in Deschler- 
Brown Precedents, chapter 29, section 
63, as well as section 370 of the House 
Rules and Manual, the Chair finds that 
the words are not accompanied by an 
allegation of personal mendacity and, 
therefore, are not unparliamentary. 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, further 
parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. PERRY. Accusing a decorated 
naval officer in the United States mili-
tary is never in good form and should 
be out of order in this Chamber. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has not stated a parliamentary 
inquiry. 
The gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER) is recognized for his 1 minute. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, first 
let me say that I respect the gentle-
man’s service in the United States 
Navy as I respect all of our men and 
women in the Armed Forces of the 
United States. 
Let me end as I began. All of us 
ought to vote for this motion to hold 
somebody in contempt who refuses to 
come forth, who is clearly and, obvi-
ously, in contempt of the Congress of 
the United States. I urge every Member

half of any political party; on behalf of 
our democracy, not on behalf of Demo-
crats; on behalf of the Constitution of

the United States to vote ‘‘yea’’ on this 
resolution. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LOFGREN). 
b 1730 
Ms. 
LOFGREN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Mark Meadows, a former colleague for 
many of us, left Congress in 2020 to 
serve as chief of staff to then-President 
Donald Trump. 
Sadly and shockingly, Mr. Meadows 
has admitted he played both an official 
and unofficial role in trying to over-
turn the results of the 2020 Presidential 
election. 
He has also admitted that he has re-
sponsive and nonprivileged documents 
and communications relating to Janu-
ary 6. In fact, he already sent some of 
those materials to our select com-
mittee charged with preventing a fu-
ture attack on our Capitol. Now, the 
select committee needs to speak with 
him about the full plot leading up to 
January 6. 
For example, it has been reported 
that the White House was directing the 
Department of Justice to investigate 
outrageous and really crazy conspiracy 
theories to benefit Mr. Trump politi-
cally, as well as to orchestrate the dis-
semination of election misinformation. 
We need to talk to Mr. Meadows about 
this. 
We have learned that Mr. Meadows 
made a surprise visit to a State-run 
audit in Georgia, which led to the now- 
infamous call in which Mr. Trump im-
properly asked the Georgia Secretary 
of State to find votes. We need to talk 
to Mr. Meadows about that. 
We also need to ask him about text 
messages which he provided to our 
committee that show an official in 
Georgia texting Mr. Meadows during 
the Trump-Raffensperger call saying 
that they ‘‘need to end this call,’’ and 
emphasizing: ‘‘I don’t think this will be 
productive much longer.’’ We need to 
talk to Mr. Meadows about that. 
We also know that during that same 
week in early January, Mr. Meadows 
was in direct contact with campaign 
staff and organizers of the rally at the 
Ellipse where his boss, the President, 
urged supporters to fight. We need to 
talk to Mr. Meadows about that. 
While domestic terrorists invaded the 
Halls where he used to work, Mr. Mead-
ows interacted with many people, in-
cluding some of our colleagues who 
were here in this Chamber. We have 
learned many of those interactions 
took place on his personal device. We 
need to talk to Mr. Meadows about 
that. 
Clearly, Mr. Meadows has important 
information about events that cul-
minated in the violent attack on the 
Capitol and on our democracy. He must 
follow the law. He must cooperate with 
the select committee’s lawful requests. 
No one is above the law. He must be 
held accountable for his violation of 
the law.

clude in the RECORD three articles.

J6 COMMITTEE MISLEADING WITNESSES ABOUT 
REPUBLICAN STAFF PRESENCE 
Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney ran to CNN a 
few weeks ago to accuse conservative stal-
wart Rep. Jim Banks of falsely presenting 
himself as the Jan. 6 commission’s ranking 
member. Banks is, in fact, congressional Re-
publicans’ choice to be their top investigator 
on the committee, but he has been prevented 
from fulfilling his duties by Speaker of the 
House Nancy Pelosi. 
However, it’s Cheney who appears to be 
misrepresenting herself as the ranking mem-
ber—that is, the top Republican—on the 
committee. 
January 6 Select Committee staff have 
been falsely telling witnesses that Repub-
lican staff will be present for interviews, ac-
cording to multiple eyewitness sources and 
documents. In fact, not a single Republican- 
appointed member of Congress nor a single 
staff member representing the Republican 
conference is part of the controversial com-
mittee. 
Witnesses are being told that John Wood, a 
longtime friend and ally of the Cheney fam-
ily, will represent Republicans when wit-
nesses testify. But neither Cheney nor her 
friend is representing the Republican con-
ference. In fact, Cheney was appointed to the 
committee in early July by Pelosi herself. 
‘‘John Wood works for the Democrat 
Party, just like Liz Cheney, who was ap-
pointed by Pelosi and is not the Ranking 
Member of the Select Committee. She is mis-
leading witnesses, before they testify under 
penalty of law, about the motives and the 
position of the person questioning them,’’ 
said Banks, who has continued leading Re-
publicans’ investigation of the federal gov-
ernment’s handling of the Jan. 6 riot at the 
Capitol. Cheney’s work with CNN was de-
signed to prevent him from being able to 
gain answers to the questions the select 
committee was ostensibly set up to answer. 
Cheney was given six days to explain 
whether she considers herself just the Demo-
crat-appointed vice-chair of the committee 
or also the Republican ranking member, as is 
being represented to key witnesses. She has 
not responded to multiple requests for com-
ment. 
The misrepresentation to witnesses is key 
because the absence of any ranking mem-
ber—meaning, in this case, any Republican- 
appointed member—or minority party staff 
means the committee appears to be failing 
to adhere to ironclad rules for its work. 
Pelosi ‘‘blew up’’ the Jan. 6 committee 
when she took what she herself admitted was 
the ‘‘unprecedented’’ step of refusing to seat 
multiple Republican-appointed members, in-
cluding the highly respected Navy officer 
and Indiana Republican Banks, who was to 
be the committee’s ranking member. She 
also banned Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who 
currently serves as the top Republican on 
the Judiciary Committee. 
Pelosi chose two of her key Republican al-
lies and anti-Trump obsessives to fill two of 
her slots for the committee. As such, they do 
not represent the Republican conference, 
which opposed their selection, but the Demo-
crat conference, which supported their selec-
tion. 
Cheney was promoted to vice-chair in Sep-
tember in thanks for her stalwart work on 
Pelosi’s behalf. Cheney, who has been cen-
sured by Wyoming Republicans for working 
against Republican voters and their inter-
ests, and who lost her position as House Con-
ference chair for hijacking multiple briefings 
for Republican policy initiatives to talk 
about her personal vendetta against Trump, 
is facing precipitously low poll numbers and 
a challenge from popular Republican Harriet 
Hageman. 
Cheney was joined by lame-duck Adam 
Kinzinger of Illinois, who recently an-
nounced his retirement rather than facing 
certain defeat from Illinois constituents who 
don’t 
share 
his 
anti-Trump 
obsession. 
Kinzinger was appointed by Pelosi in late 
July to make the committee appear more bi-
partisan after she’d vetoed Banks and Jor-
dan. Cheney, her selection for vice-chair, was 
brought in for the sole purpose of helping 
Democrats with their tribunal. 
The resolution establishing the committee, 
purportedly to investigate the federal gov-
ernment’s role in detecting, preventing, pre-
paring for, and responding to the Jan. 6 riot, 
says depositions taken by the select com-
mittee must follow House rules. 
Those rules clearly state, ‘‘Consultation 
with the ranking minority member shall in-
clude three days’ notice before any deposi-
tion.’’ Also, ‘‘A deposition shall be conducted 
by any member or committee counsel des-
ignated by the chair or ranking minority 
member of the Committee that noticed the 
deposition. When depositions are conducted 
by committee counsel, there shall be no 
more than two committee counsel permitted 
to question a witness per round. One of the 
committee counsel shall be designated by 
the chair and the other by the ranking mi-
nority member per round.’’ 
Additionally, the rules say, ‘‘Deposition 
questions shall be propounded in rounds. The 
length of each round shall not exceed 60 min-
utes per side and shall provide equal time to 
the majority and the minority. In each 
round, the member(s) or committee counsel 
designated by the chair shall ask questions 
first, and the member(s) or committee coun-
sel designated by the ranking minority mem-
ber shall ask questions second.’’ 
The point of these rules is to structure 
depositions so the minority and the majority 
counsel have the same opportunity to ques-
tion witnesses and gather information for 
their separate reports. That’s why they ro-
tate and why they’re allotted equal time. 
Having questions alternate from one hostile 
lawyer to another hostile lawyer who is 
working with the first makes a mockery of 
the provisions. It also means that the hostile 
lawyers can coordinate and cherry-pick 
which information to leak or publish, and 
which to conceal from the public because it 
contradicts their preferred narrative. 
The 
rules 
do 
not 
envision 
the 
cir-
cumstances that accompany Pelosi’s uni- 
party select committee. The House Rules 
‘‘become nonsensical in a situation like 
this,’’ said one congressional aide, adding, 
‘‘This isn’t just a partisan investigation—it’s 
a coverup.’’ 
For the select committee to be in accord-
ance with the rules regarding consultation 
for depositions, Cheney must be considered 
simultaneously the ranking member for the 
minority party while also being the vice- 
chair for the majority party. 
Hill lawyers say Pelosi’s handling of the 
committee casts doubt on its adherence to

the rules. Because she vetoed the ranking 
member from the committee, it has no rank-
ing member. But the committee rules re-
quire consultation with the ranking member 
before taking certain basic actions, such as 
taking depositions, including those pursuant 
to subpoenas. 
‘‘So how can you consult with the ranking 
member when you don’t have one?’’ asked 
one Hill attorney. 
The multiple sources consulted for this ar-
ticle include a document which confirmed 
January 6 Committee staff represented to a 
witness that Wood would be the Republican 
counsel during their interview. 
‘‘If this was a real investigation, that’d 
land you in jail for prosecutorial mis-
conduct,’’ Banks said of the false representa-
tion. ‘‘Fortunately for Liz, this is a sham in-
vestigation,’’ he added. 
[From The Wall Street Journal, Sept. 1, 2021] 
THE DEMOCRATIC NORM BREAKERS 
(By The Editorial Board) 
Critics feared that Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s 
probe of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot would be par-
tisan, and the latest proof are subpoenas for 
the private phone records of House Repub-
licans. This is a violation of political norms 
that Democrats will come to regret. 
Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.), chair of the 
House special committee, sent letters Mon-
day to 35 companies, from At&T to Facebook 
to Parler, asking them to preserve informa-
tion about account holders charged with 
crimes related to, or ‘‘potentially involved 
with discussions’’ in planning, the Jan. 6 
riot. The companies are requested to pre-
serve emails, and voice, text and direct mes-
sages in preparation for subpoenas to come. 
The letters contained a list of individuals 
whose names haven’t leaked. But CNN re-
ports that nearly a dozen House Republicans 
are on the committee’s ‘‘evolving’’ radar, in-
cluding Jim Jordan, ranking Member of the 
House Judiciary Committee. 
Republicans are furious, and rightly so. In-
diana Rep. Jim Banks noted in a letter to 
Mr. Thompson that this ‘‘authoritarian un-
dertaking’’ would depart ‘‘from more than 
230 years of Congressional oversight.’’ The 
move recalls California Democrat Adam 
Schiff’s public release of the call logs of Re-
publican Rep. Devin Nunes in 2019. 
At least Democrats claimed the collection 
of Mr. Nunes’s information was incidental to 
other records it targeted. The special com-
mittee is using its oversight power to snoop 
on political opponents. They’d gain access to 
information far beyond the events of Jan. 6. 
Democrats say they need the call lists to 
see if Members of Congress fomented the as-
sault on the Capitol. They hope to confirm 
their narrative that the riot was a planned 
‘‘insurrection,’’ though Reuters reports that 
the FBI has found no such evidence in six 
months of looking. Conspiracy is a crime and 
matter for the Justice Department, not Con-
gress. 
The subpoenas are also legally dubious, 
coming after recent judicial warnings about 
the limits of Congressional fishing. The Su-
preme Court last year in Trump v. Mazars 
reminded Congress that subpoenas must 
have a ‘‘valid legislative purpose.’’ The Jan. 
6 committee has offered no such rationale. 
Our legal sources say the subpoenas may vio-
late the Constitution’s Speech and Debate 
Clause because Congress can’t pass a law 
that would limit Members’ speech. 
The private companies may want to think 
twice about complying. In the Schiff affair, 
the telcos handed over call logs without even 
notifying the targets. Mr. Thompson’s letter 
is demanding the same, telling companies 
that if they ‘‘are not able or willing to re-
spond to this request without alerting the 
subscribers or the accounts’’ to ‘‘please con-
tact the Select Committee prior to pro-
ceeding.’’ The ‘‘please’’ part is an admission 
that the committee knows it lacks authority 
to make such a demand. 
Federal 
Communications 
Commissioner 
Brendan Carr says ‘‘federal law requires tele-
communications carriers to protect the pri-
vacy and confidentiality of Americans’ call 
records.’’ He says his agency ‘‘has brought 
enforcement actions against carriers to en-
sure their compliance,’’ and Congress isn’t 
automatically entitled to anyone’s private 
records. 
Even if the companies don’t want to fight 
the subpoenas in court, they have an obliga-
tion to alert targets so they can contest the 
subpoenas. Mr. Banks’s Friday letter re-
minded corporate general counsels of their 
‘‘legal obligation not to hand over individ-
uals’ private records unless the subject of 
the subpoena consents to the information 
being shared or the company has a court 
order to turn over the records.’’ 
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy 
also warned companies against rolling over 
to Democratic pressure, noting they could 
forfeit their ‘‘ability to operate in the United 
States.’’ Democrats and the media spun this 
as pressuring companies to ignore ‘‘duly’’ 
issued subpoenas. But Mr. McCarthy was 
pointing out that federal privacy law pro-
tects 
information, 
and 
that 
Democrats 
haven’t proved in court that their committee 
is entitled to these records. 
If Democrats follow through and use their 
power to investigate GOP opponents, there 
will be no end to it. Republicans are likely to 
take the majority as early as 2022, and two 
can play at Adam Schiff’s nasty game. 
THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE 1/6 
COMMITTEE 
Civil liberties abuses of this type are com-
mon when the U.S. security state scares 
enough people into believing that the threat 
they face is so acute that normal constitu-
tional safeguards must be disregarded. What 
is most definitely not common, and is argu-
ably the greatest 1/6-related civil liberties 
abuse of them all, is the House of Represent-
atives Select Committee to Investigate the 
January 6th Attack on the United States 
Capitol. 
To say that the investigative acts of the 1/ 
6 Committee are radical is a wild understate-
ment. Along with serving subpoenas on four 
former Trump officials, they have also 
served subpoenas on eleven Private citizens: 
people selected for interrogation precisely 
because they exercised their Constitutional 
right of free assembly by applying for and re-
ceiving a permit to hold a protest on Janu-
ary 6 opposing certification of the 2020 elec-
tion. 
When the Select 1/6 Committee recently 
boasted of these subpoenas in its press re-
lease, it made clear what methodology it 
used for selecting who it was targeting: ‘‘The 
committee used permit paperwork for the 
Jan. 6 rally to identify other individuals in-
volved in organizing.’’ In other words, any 
citizen whose name appeared on permit ap-
plications to protest was targeted for that 
reason alone. The committee’s stated goal is 
‘‘to collect information from them and their 
associated entities on the planning, organi-
zation, and funding of those events’’: to haul 
citizens before Congress to interrogate them 
on their constitutionally protected right to 
assemble and protest and probe their polit-
ical beliefs and associations: 
Press Release 
SELECT COMMITTEE SUBPOENAS ORGANIZERS 
OF RALLIES AND EVENTS PRECEDING JANU-
ARY 6TH INSURRECTION 
[Sep 29, 2021] 
Washington—Today, Chairman Bennie G. 
Thompson announced that the Select Com-
mittee has issued subpoenas for deposition 
testimony and records to individuals tied to 
the events and rallies leading up to the Jan-
uary 6th insurrection, including the January 
6th rally at the Ellipse that immediately 
preceded the violent attack on the U.S. Cap-
itol. The subpoenas were sent to 11 individ-
uals as part of the Select Committee’s ef-
forts to collect information from them and 
their associated entities on the planning, or-
ganization, and funding of those events. In 
letters to rally organizers, Chairman Thomp-
son instructed witnesses to testify at deposi-
tions and to produce a sweeping range of 
records. 
The subpoenas seek a range of records that 
include materials dealing with the planning, 
funding, and participation in the events and 
bus tours; social media activity of associated 
entities; and communications with or in-
volvement of Trump Administration officials 
and 
lawmakers. 
The 
Select 
Committee 
issued subpoenas for records from the fol-
lowing individuals and their associated enti-
ties, and has instructed the individuals to 
testify at depositions: 
Amy Kremer, founder and Chair of WFAF. 
Kylie Kremer, founder and Executive Di-
rector of WFAF. 
Cynthia Chafian, submitted the first per-
mit application on behalf of WFAF for the 
January 6th rally, and founder of the Eighty 
Percent Coalition. 
Caroline Wren, listed on permit paperwork 
for the January 6th rally as ‘‘VIP Advisor.’’ 
Maggie Mulvaney, listed on permit paper-
work for the January 6th rally as ‘‘VIP 
Lead.’’ 
Justin Caporale, of Event Strategies, Inc., 
listed on permit paperwork for the January 
6th rally as ‘‘Project Manager.’’ 
Tim Unes, of Event Strategies, Inc., listed 
on permit paperwork for the January 6th 
rally as ‘‘Stage Manager.’’ 
Megan Powers, of MPowers Consulting 
LLC, Listed on permit paperwork for the 
January 6th rally as ‘‘Operations Manager 
for Scheduling and Guidance.’’ 
Hannah Salem, of Salem Strategies LLC, 
listed on permit paperwork for the January 
6th rally as ‘‘Operations Manager for Logis-
tics and Communications.’’ 
Lyndon Brentnall, of RMS Protective 
Services, listed on permit paperwork for the 
January 6th rally as ‘‘On-Site supervisor.’’ 
Katrina Pierson, former Trump campaign 
official, reportedly involved in the organiza-
tion of the January 5th and 6th rallies and 
was in direct communication with the 
former President about the rallies. 
Even worse are the so-called ‘‘preservation 
notices’’ 
which 
the 
committee 
secretly 
issued to dozens if not hundreds of telecoms, 
email and cell phone providers, and other so-
cial media platforms (including Twitter and 
Parler), ordering those companies to retain 
extremely invasive data regarding the com-
munications and physical activities of more 
than 100 citizens, with the obvious intent to 
allow the committee to subpoena those docu-
ments. The communications and physical 
movement data sought by the committee be-
gins in April, 2020—nine months before the 1/ 
6 riot. The committee refuses to make public 
the list of individuals it is targeting with 
these sweeping third-party subpoenas, but on 
the list are what CNN calls ‘‘many members 
of Congress,’’ along with dozens of private 
citizens involved in obtaining the permit to 
protest and then promoting and planning the 
gathering on social media. 
What makes these secret notices especially 
pernicious is that the committee requested 
that these companies not notify their cus-
tomers that the committee has demanded 
the preservation of their data. The com-
mittee knows it lacks the power to impose a 
‘‘gag order’’ on these companies to prevent

them from notifying their users that they re-
ceived the precursor to a subpoena: a power 
the FBI in conjunction with courts does 
have. So they are relying instead on ‘‘vol-
untary compliance’’ with the gag order re-
quest, accompanied by the thuggish threat 
that any companies refusing to voluntarily 
comply risk the public relations harm of ap-
pearing to be obstructing the committee’s 
investigation and, worse, protecting the 1/6 
‘‘insurrectionists.’’ 
Worse still, the committee in its preserva-
tion notices to these communications com-
panies requested that ‘‘you do not disable, 
suspend, lock, cancel, or interrupt service to 
these subscribers or accounts solely due to 
this request,’’ and that they should first con-
tact the committee ‘‘if you are not able or 
willing to respond to this request without 
alerting the subscribers.’’ The motive here is 
obvious: if any of these companies risk the 
PR hit by refusing to conceal from their cus-
tomers the fact that Congress is seeking to 
obtain their private data, they are in-
structed to contact the committee instead, 
so that the committee can withdraw the re-
quest. That way, none of the customers will 
ever be aware that the committee targeted 
their private data and will thus never be able 
to challenge the legality of the committee’s 
acts in a court of law. 
In other words, even the committee knows 
that its power to seek this information 
about private citizens lacks any convincing 
legal justification and, for that reason, 
wants to ensure that nobody has the ability 
to seek a judicial ruling on the legality of 
their actions. All of these behaviors raise se-
rious civil liberties concerns, so much so 
that even left-liberal legal scholars and at 
least one civil liberties group (obviously not 
the ACLU)—petrified until now of creating 
any appearance that they are defending 1/6 
protesters by objecting to civil liberties 
abuses—have begun very delicately to raise 
doubts and concerns about the committee’s 
actions. 
But the most serious constitutional prob-
lem is not the specific investigative acts of 
the committee but the very existence of the 
committee itself. There is ample reason to 
doubt the constitutionality of this commit-
tee’s existence. 
When crimes are committed in the United 
States, there are two branches of govern-
ment—and only two—vested by the Constitu-
tion with the power to investigate criminal 
suspects and adjudicate guilt: the executive 
branch (through the FBI and DOJ) and the 
judiciary. Congress has no role to play in 
any of that, and for good and important rea-
sons. The Constitution places limits on what 
the executive branch and judiciary can do 
when investigating suspects . . . . . 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
as much time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN). 
Mr. 
JORDAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Democrats prevent Republicans from 
serving 
on 
the 
select 
committee. 
Democrats kick Republicans off stand-
ing committees. Democrats try to 
make D.C. a State. Democrats try to 
end the filibuster. They try to pack the 
court. They do secret impeachment 
hearings in the bunker of the basement 
of the Capitol. And they just said a 
naval veteran is afraid of the truth. 
Now, today, they are destroying execu-
tive privilege. 
The United States Supreme Court 
held those who assist the President 
must be free to explore alternatives in 
the process of shaping policies and 
making decisions and to do so in a way 
that many would be unwilling to do, 
except privately. The Court further 
stated Presidential administrations of 
both parties have asserted that the 
President’s close advisers are an exten-
sion of the President. 
Who are these close advisers? Who 
are these individuals who are an exten-
sion of the President of the United 
States? Well, there are actually a 
bunch, but certainly, the three most 
important are the National Security 
Advisor, the White House counsel, and 
the chief of staff to the President. I 
would argue the chief of staff is the 
closest of the close. He is the one who 
spends more time with the Commander 
in Chief than anyone else. 
Now, why do we have this privilege? 
Why do we have it? Why is the deci-
sionmaking process between the Presi-
dent and his closest advisers a private 
matter? Why is that? 
Well, guess what, the Supreme Court 
told us the answer to that one, too. Ex-
ecutive privilege serves ‘‘the necessity 
for protection of the public interest in 
candid, objective, and even . . . harsh 
opinions 
in 
Presidential 
decision-
making.’’ 
Let me just say that again: Execu-
tive privilege serves the public inter-
est. It is for us. It is for we the people. 
It is not for President Trump. It is not 
for Mark Meadows. It is not for any 
President. It is not for any chief of 
staff. It is for the country. 
But the Democrats are not going to 
worry about that. They are going to 
forget about that because they think 
this is good politics. They think this is 
all about politics. 
They used to care. They used to care 
about executive privilege. When Repub-
licans wanted information during the 
Fast and Furious scandal, President 
Obama asserted executive privilege for 
bureaucrats at the ATF and DOJ. 
Think about it. A bureaucrat in a Fed-
eral agency gets privilege but not the 
chief of staff to the President? Because 
Mark Meadows worked for President 
Trump, and Democrats have been out 
to get President Trump before he ever 
took office when they first tried to spy 
on him, and actually did spy on him, in 
2016. 
They are going to destroy this prece-
dent even though this very question is 
in front of the courts as we speak. 
They are going to destroy this prece-
dent that has been around since 1794 
when our first President first asserted 
it. And for what? 
What did Mark Meadows do? He gave 
the committee thousands of emails; he 
gave the committee thousands of text 
messages; and he agreed to come in 
front of the committee and answer any 
question as long as it didn’t violate ex-
ecutive privilege; the privilege that is 
not his to waive but belongs to the 
President; the privilege that the Court 
said is critical to executive decision-
making; the privilege that exists for 
the benefit of we the people; and the 
privilege that has been around since 
George Washington asserted it. 
But Democrats say: No, not good 
enough, Mr. Meadows. You have to 
come in and answer any and every 
question we ask you, or we are going to 
try to put you in prison. 
It is so disgusting. Think about it. 
We weren’t allowed to know who the 
so-called anonymous whistleblower was 
when they tried to impeach President 
Trump, did impeach President Trump, 
but Democrats can destroy executive 
privilege? The country wasn’t allowed 
to know what took place in that bunk-
er in the basement of the Capitol dur-
ing impeachment, but they get to know 
any and everything they want about 
conversations between the President 
and his top adviser. 
This is so wrong. Democrats on the 
select committee also can’t make up 
their minds. With Steve Bannon, they 
said: You have to appear in person to 
assert any privilege. And because he 
didn’t come, they held him in con-
tempt. 
With Jeff Clark, they said to come in 
person, assert privilege, which he did, 
and they said, no, that is not good 
enough. And they held him in con-
tempt. 
Now, with Mark Meadows, he gave 
them thousands of documents and 
agreed to come, and they still said not 
good enough. What a charade. 
Make no mistake, when Democrats 
vote in favor of this resolution, it is a 
vote to put a good man in prison. Don’t 
pretend to argue, either. Don’t even at-
tempt the argument: No, no, no, this is 
just the House acting; the Justice De-
partment will make a decision whether 
to prosecute or not. Come on. Is there 
anyone who believes that? 
It took the Attorney General all of 5 
days to treat parents as terrorists, all 
of 5 days. If a leftwing political group 
can write the White House asking the 
Department of Justice to use the PA-
TRIOT Act against moms and dads and 
5 days later the Attorney General of 
the United States does just that, then 
what do you think he is going to do 
when 225 Democrats in the House of 
Representatives ask him to put Presi-
dent Trump’s chief of staff in prison? 
I have been in Congress for a while, 
15 
years. 
I 
have 
seen 
Democrats 
weaponize the government to attack 
their political opponents. Ten years 
ago, they used the IRS to target good 
people around this country, good, con-
servative people. Five years ago, they 
abused the FISA process and used the 
FBI to spy on President Trump’s cam-
paign. Two months ago, the Depart-
ment of Justice used the Counterter-
rorism Division at the FBI to put a 
threat tag, a label, a designation, on 
parents who had the gall to go speak 
up at school board meetings and defend 
their kids, speak out against some 
crazy curriculum. 
Now, they are destroying executive 
privilege. Now, they are attacking 
that. This might be the worst, destroy-
ing a precedent that has been around 
since George Washington and treating 
Mark Meadows as a criminal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7791 
December 14, 2021 
Mark Meadows is our former col-
league. He is a good man, and he is my 
friend. This is as wrong as it gets. I 
think, deep down, everyone knows it. I 
think they know it as well. They know 
this is wrong. We have all served with 
this guy. He has done more work with 
Democrats than probably any Repub-
lican. We all know what a good man he 
is. This is as wrong as it gets. 
Madam Speaker, they all know it, 
but their lust for power, their lust to 
get their opponents, is so intense, they 
don’t care. I hope they reconsider. I 
hope we don’t take this action. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, just for the record, 
the gentleman from Ohio is aware of 
congressional oversight prerogatives. 
When Mr. Meadows was a member and 
later chairman of the House Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform, he 
himself demanded testimony from sen-
ior executive branch officials and chid-
ed those who failed to cooperate with 
congressional oversight. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
SCHIFF), the distinguished chairman of 
the House Intelligence Committee. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, Mark 
Meadows was served with a subpoena 
for testimony and documents 3 months 
ago. Since that time, he has done TV 
interviews, published a book, and pro-
duced over 9,000 documents about Jan-
uary 6, which he concedes are not cov-
ered by any form of privilege. 
These documents include chilling 
text messages from the President’s son, 
Don, Jr., urging Meadows to get his fa-
ther to do something to stop the vio-
lence; from Members of Congress, urg-
ing that the Vice President simply ig-
nore electoral votes he personally 
deems 
unconstitutional; 
and, 
even 
after the violence of January 6, be-
moaning the fact that the effort to 
overturn the counting of the electors 
was a failure. 
One of the texts to Meadows, on Jan-
uary 3, came from an unknown caller 
and referred to efforts to replace the 
leadership of the Department of Jus-
tice and said the following: ‘‘I heard 
Jeff Clark is getting put in on Monday. 
That’s amazing. It will make a lot of 
patriots happy, and I’m personally so 
proud that you are at the tip of the 
spear and I can call you a friend.’’ 
But notwithstanding his texts, his 
emails, his interviews, and his book, 
Mr. Meadows refused to appear for his 
deposition, claiming that to discuss the 
same issues, documents, and book is 
somehow privileged. The inconsist-
ency, the hypocrisy, grabs you by the 
neck, and so does his utter contempt of 
Congress. 
Mr. Meadows is a central participant 
and witness to the events of January 6. 
He is at the tip of the spear. If he can 
get away with ignoring the law, if wit-
nesses summoned before Congress can 
merely pick and choose when they 
comply, our power of oversight will be 
gone and along with it our cherished 
system of checks and balances. 
Take away Congress’ power to com-
pel evidence and you take away Con-
gress’ power to protect the public from 
a dangerous and malign executive. Peo-
ple died on January 6. A Congress that 
cannot enforce its subpoenas in such an 
investigation is no more effective than 
a court in a homicide case which can-
not compel witnesses to appear. We 
would cease to be a Congress and be-
come a mere plaything in the hands of 
a despot. 
Mark Meadows has demonstrated 
contempt for Congress and for the pub-
lic. Now, he must be held in contempt. 
He should be prosecuted like anyone 
else who ignores the law because no 
one is above the law. 
b 1745 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, let me just make 
sure people understand some facts in 
light of some of the charges that the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN) just 
made, which are flat false. 
Number one, Mr. Meadows refused to 
show up for his deposition. The com-
mittee scheduled a deposition after ex-
tensive coordination with Mr. Meadows 
on a day that he chose, that he se-
lected, and then he refused to show up. 
He refused to show up to testify 
about nonprivileged questions. My col-
league from Ohio can talk as much as 
he would like about executive privilege 
and about George Washington and 
about the extent to which it is crucial 
for the survival of the Republic, with 
which I agree, but we are talking here 
about testimony about nonprivileged 
materials. 
Secondly, Madam Speaker, I would 
say that we all on this side of the aisle 
used to be in agreement about what 
had happened on January 6. There was 
a brief period of time, days perhaps, 
when we were in agreement. 
Standing—perhaps 
at 
this 
micro-
phone—the 
minority 
leader, 
KEVIN 
MCCARTHY, said this on January 13: 
‘‘The President bears responsibility for 
Wednesday’s attack on Congress by 
mob rioters. He should have imme-
diately denounced the mob when he 
saw what was unfolding. These facts re-
quire immediate action by President 
Trump. . . .’’ 
Unfortunately, Mr. MCCARTHY’s posi-
tion changed on this issue. Mr. MCCAR-
THY then worked against, voted against 
the resolution that would have created 
a bipartisan commission to investigate 
these matters, and he withdrew his 
nominees to this committee. Let me 
say that again. He withdrew his nomi-
nees to this committee. 
This committee is engaged in critical 
investigative and legislative activity 
for which there is no greater purpose in 
terms of Congress’ responsibility, no 
matter what my colleague on the other 
side may claim in terms of Mr. Mead-
ows. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
AGUILAR). 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the vice chair for yielding. 
Last Tuesday, December 7, the select 
committee received a letter from Mr. 
Meadows’ lawyer telling us that his cli-
ent’s appearance for a deposition had 
become, and I quote, ‘‘untenable’’. 
Something else happened last Tues-
day. Mr. Meadows’ book, ‘‘The Chief’s 
Chief,’’ hit bookstores. 
This is a witness who is refusing to 
comply with the law and answer our 
questions, in part because the former 
President has instructed him to do so, 
he says. He says that as chief of staff 
he couldn’t possibly disclose the con-
versations with the former President. 
But look at his book, and you get 
more information about his confiden-
tial conversations with the former 
President than our committee did. 
This is from a section dealing with 
the January 6 rally at the Ellipse. 
‘‘When he got off stage, President 
Trump let me know that he had been 
speaking 
metaphorically 
about 
the 
walk to the Capitol. He knew as well as 
anyone that we couldn’t organize a trip 
like that on such short notice.’’ 
That part is interesting because the 
select committee has a lot of questions 
about what the President said and did 
on January 6. We have a lot of ques-
tions about how protests that day esca-
lated into a riot. And Mark Meadows 
says he can’t discuss these details with 
us. But apparently, he can put them in 
his book. 
We have also learned from those very 
documents Mr. Meadows turned over 
that he was willing to discuss what the 
President was thinking with Members 
of Congress. 
On January 3, Mr. Meadows was ex-
changing text messages with a law-
maker about the pressure campaign to 
get State legislatures to overturn the 
results of the election. In one text mes-
sage to a lawmaker, Mr. Meadows 
wrote, ‘‘He,’’ he presumably being 
President Trump, ‘‘He thinks the legis-
latures have the power, but the VP has 
power, too.’’ 
The power to do what? We could 
guess the power to overturn the elec-
tion results, the power to reject the 
will of the voters. And days later a vio-
lent mob tried to get Vice President 
Pence to do just that. We would like to 
ask Mr. Meadows about that, about 
what the former President thought. 
Days before the violent attack, Mr. 
Meadows was willing to share what he, 
President Trump, thinks, but he won’t 
tell us. 
That is why Mr. Meadows’ testimony 
is so important. That is why his privi-
lege claims are so outrageous, and that 
is why we need to adopt this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, let’s be very, very 
clear. The Democrats aren’t interested 
in finding out how a disorganized horde 
of rioters managed to break into the 
United States Capitol on January 6. 
They don’t want to learn more about

December 14, 2021 
the security breakdown that occurred 
that day, and they don’t care about 
protecting the Capitol from future at-
tacks. They have proven it to us. 
None of the 51 subpoenas that the 
committee has publicly touted have 
anything to do with Capitol security. 
As they have proven yet again today, 
over and over again, they only care 
about attacking their political en-
emies. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROD-
NEY DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, here we are again, 
considering another politically moti-
vated contempt resolution. This time 
the contempt resolution is for someone 
who actually provided this select com-
mittee with nearly 7,000 pages of non-
privileged e-mails and other documents 
in response to a subpoena. More than 
1,100 documents and more than 2,300 
text messages were also provided. But 
that doesn’t seem to be enough for this 
select committee. It really has turned 
out to be nothing more than a partisan 
committee just to investigate the 
former President. 
Subpoenas are not open-ended. They 
are required to be narrowly tailored. 
Unfortunately, this committee doesn’t 
seem to care about the rules. 
I also have some serious concerns 
with the way whistleblowers and other 
witnesses are being treated by this se-
lect committee. 
I asked this question the last time we 
were here voting on a politically moti-
vated contempt resolution, and it still 
hasn’t been answered by the majority, 
so I will ask it again: Why was the Cap-
itol so unprotected on January 6? 
There are serious security vulnerabil-
ities that have not been addressed and 
won’t be addressed nearly a year after 
January 6. There has been little real 
action taken in response to the Senate 
report on January 6 and the Honore 
task force findings. The Capitol Police 
inspector general has released 7 reports 
and 103 findings, yet the majority has 
failed to ensure these findings are im-
plemented in a meaningful way. 
We know massive changes to intel, 
perimeter protection, training, leader-
ship structure, decision-making proc-
esses, and many, many more are need-
ed, but neither this select committee 
nor the Committee on House Adminis-
tration seem at all interested in ensur-
ing that these changes are made. 
Additionally, a number of questions, 
Madam Speaker, from that day still re-
main unanswered. I am still waiting on 
the Speaker of the House to answer a 
letter I sent her back in February that 
asks why the National Guard request 
by then Police Chief Steven Sund were 
denied? Why the Speaker was involved 
in eventually approving the request? 
And why the House Sergeant at Arms 
has refused to comply with preserva-
tion and production requests from my 
office? I am the ranking member of the 
oversight committee for the Sergeant 
at Arms. They will not comply with 
the preservation request from the com-
mittee of jurisdiction. 
We have many other unanswered 
questions, too, Madam Speaker. With 
these questions still unanswered and 
another purely political contempt reso-
lution on the floor today, it makes you 
ask yourself, what is the majority hid-
ing? And why are their priorities not 
the men and women serving in the Cap-
itol Police and making this Capitol 
more secure for everyone? We need 
these reforms. They should have been 
done months ago. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 31⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN). 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, like 
300 other witnesses called to meet with 
the January 6 committee and our staff, 
Mark Meadows was, indeed, cooper-
ating with our committee and volun-
tarily released thousands of pages of 
admittedly 
unprivileged 
documents, 
and then something changed. His book 
came out and apparently embarrassed 
Donald Trump. 
After ex-President Trump exploded 
and called the book fake news, Mead-
ows performed a U-turn and suddenly 
refused to appear at the December 8 
deposition 
that 
he 
had 
previously 
agreed to. He called his own book fake 
news, which is a pretty devastating re-
view to render on your own book, and 
he brought a lawsuit against the com-
mittee alleging—check this out—that 
we have no legislative purpose. 
Meadows’ sudden vanishing act can-
not vaporize the Article I legislative 
power of our committee to investigate 
the massive assault on American de-
mocracy that took place on January 6. 
If the January 6 committee has no leg-
islative purpose, then none of our com-
mittees do, for the first rule of demo-
cratic government is self-preservation. 
Article I, Section 8, Clause 15 gives 
us the power to suppress insurrections 
and repel invasions against the Union, 
and this we will do by investigating 
and reporting on the most dangerous 
political 
violence 
ever 
unleashed 
against the Capitol by a domestic 
enemy. 
We have hundreds of questions. Yes, 
we do. The fact that Donald Trump, 
who gave Mr. Meadows a positive blurb 
for his book, apparently changed his 
mind about the book doesn’t mean that 
Mr. Meadows can now violate a con-
gressional subpoena, something that 
Meadows frequently insisted upon him-
self as a leading member of the House 
Oversight Committee, and he knows it. 
And we have pages and pages of his in-
sisting upon the central importance of 
honoring the subpoenas of Congress. 
We have hundreds of questions for 
Mr. Meadows about information he has 
already admitted is not privileged in 
any way at all by the executive privi-
lege, the Fifth Amendment, or any-
thing else. 
Here is one of them: How did the fol-
lowing text from a House lawmaker in-
fluence Trump’s plans to overthrow 
Joe Biden’s electoral college majority 
of 306 to 232 after Joe Biden beat Don-
ald Trump? 
Here is what that lawmaker wrote 
him. On November 4, a Member of this 
body wrote to Meadows: Here is an ag-
gressive strategy—one day after the 
election—why can’t the States of Geor-
gia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and 
other 
Republican-controlled 
State 
houses declare this is BS where con-
flicts in election not called that night 
and just send their own electors to vote 
and have it go to the SCOTUS, the Su-
preme Court of the United States. 
How did this text influence the plan-
ning of Mark Meadows and Donald 
Trump to try to destroy the lawful 
electoral college majority that had 
been established by the people of the 
United States and the States for Joe 
Biden? 
Those are the kind of questions that 
we have a right to ask Mark Meadows. 
He does not have any special privilege 
above any other citizen to get out of 
his civic responsibility. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. 
LURIA), a distinguished member of the 
select committee, as well as the Com-
mittees on Armed Services, Homeland 
Security, and Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, this is 
not a vote that I ever thought I would 
be asked to take. The idea that this 
body would find a former chief of staff 
to the President of the United States, a 
former Member of Congress, in con-
tempt was unthinkable prior to today. 
We must approve this resolution, 
Madam Speaker, because of one simple 
fact: 187 minutes. For 187 minutes, 
Mark Meadows was besieged by cries 
for help from citizens, from members of 
the press, from members of the Presi-
dent’s own family, and from our col-
leagues in this Chamber, pleading for 
Mr. Meadows to intervene and stop the 
attack. 
The American people need to under-
stand exactly what happened during 
that 187 minutes. Mr. Meadows knows, 
which is why he must come forward. It 
is increasingly clear that for 187 min-
utes the Commander in Chief was dere-
lict of his duty. We know this because 
Mr. Meadows provided the evidence to 
the committee without any assertions 
of privilege. 
And while the records he has handed 
over are helpful, there are many ques-
tions that we need to ask him. 
Mr. Meadows received a text, one of 
several, from one lawmaker in the days 
leading 
up 
to 
the 
attack 
saying, 
‘‘Check your signal.’’ The signal mes-
sages are encrypted. Only Mr. Meadows 
can tell us what they said, so we would 
like to ask him about that.

have heard from individuals involved

in planning the rallies that imme-
diately preceded the violent attack on 
the Capitol. 
Those people talked with Mr. Mead-
ows. 
We want to ask him about that. 
We have heard from former White 
House staffers who ultimately reported 
to Mr. Meadows as the chief of staff. 
We want to ask him about that. 
We have heard from Justice Depart-
ment officials who received instruc-
tions to amplify false claims about the 
election which Mr. Meadows knew 
about. 
We want to ask him about that. 
And we have heard from State offi-
cials about the pressure campaigns and 
the relentless attacks on democracy in 
Arizona, Michigan, and Georgia. 
Mr. Meadows actually went to Geor-
gia in connection with the recount ef-
fort. 
The American people must hear from 
him about that. 
We are investigating an attempt, as 
one rioter simply put it, and accu-
rately, 
‘‘to 
overthrow 
the 
govern-
ment.’’ 
Our republic—which I myself served 
in uniform for 20 years—has never 
faced a threat as acute and imminent 
as what we face today. 
Think back to the day of the violent 
attack. If you believed that Mark 
Meadows could help stop that attack, if 
you were one of the Members of this 
body who texted him to stop that at-
tack, you must vote ‘‘yes’’ today. 
If, for 187 minutes, you knew the 
former President could call off the ri-
oters, you must vote ‘‘yes’’ today. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
My Republican colleagues and I have 
repeatedly condemned political vio-
lence in all of its forms, including the 
violence on January 6. 
But the chair of the House Judiciary 
Committee, who was elected by Demo-
crats to oversee Federal law enforce-
ment, secured a Presidential pardon for 
Susan Rosenberg, a domestic terrorist 
who set off a bomb in the Senate 
Cloakroom in 1983. That is a fact. 
Merrick 
Garland, 
appointed 
by 
Democrats to head the Justice Depart-
ment, helped the Obama administra-
tion to dismiss an indictment against 
Elizabeth Ann Duke, a fugitive who 
was also arrested for setting off a bomb 
inside the United States Capitol. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Indiana for yield-
ing. 
A year ago in January I spoke on this 
floor in defense of the rule of law and 
my view that it was incumbent upon 
Congress to count the electors sent to 
us from their respective States. 
In doing so, I reminded the Chamber 
that we are deeply divided. 
Now we are a Nation perilously di-
vided further. And a divided Nation 
must return to first principles. Those 
first principles include separation of 
powers; and in so doing, the judicious 
use of the congressional subpoena 
power as requiring, per the United 
States Supreme Court, ‘‘a valid legisla-
tive purpose.’’ 
That power is not, per the court, lim-
itless, it is not, per the court, a power 
to expose for the sake of exposure, it is 
not, per the court, a power to punish, 
as such would be ‘‘indefensible.’’ 
The January 6th Committee was born 
in politics. After all, we have standing 
committees like Judiciary, which have 
had precisely zero hearings about the 
500 Americans who have been charged, 
arrested, and are jailed regarding Janu-
ary 6. 
And then the natural pursuit of any 
conspiracy 
associated 
with 
such 
crimes—no, the select committee con-
tinually moves the goalpost far from a 
core legislative purpose. Indeed, one 
target seeking to claim privilege was 
told to take specific tests to claim that 
privilege, then did so, and then was 
told, sorry, this was not sufficient en 
route to contempt. 
Now we have the targeting of our 
friend, Mark Meadows. Congressman 
Meadows 
sought 
accommodation. 
While, yes, it is between branches, the 
question in privilege regarding the 
former President continues to be liti-
gated for good reason. 
The 
gentlewoman 
from 
Wyoming 
outlined text messages from some of us 
imploring action by the President. The 
text messages from which she read 
were, in fact, turned over by Mr. Mead-
ows. He produced more than 1,100 docu-
ments totaling 9,000 pages and over 
2,300 text messages. 
Mr. Meadows offered to appear before 
the committee to address the agreed- 
upon nonprivileged documents. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman an additional 15 sec-
onds. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, Mr. Mead-
ows 
agrees 
to 
continue 
to 
work 
through questions of privilege. But 
again, here we are facing a vote to hold 
Mr. Meadows in contempt. 
Anger over January 6 and the events 
leading to it is not reason for a com-
mittee formed from that anger and in 
partisanship 
to 
exercise 
unlimited 
power to command attendance of pro-
duction while moving the goalpost. 
This itself is an assault on liberty and 
our republic. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close 
after the gentlewoman from Wyoming 
(Ms. CHENEY) and the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. BANKS). 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, in spite 
of the protestations of the gentleman 
from Maryland that we heard earlier 
that this bogus, fraudulently organized 
committee has a legislative purpose 
that is legitimate, and he said it was 
self-preservation, but everything every 
Democrat has said today is meant to 
attack one person, and that is Donald 
Trump. 
And so I am reminded of the case 
that gave us the long progeny of all 
these cases that deal with legislative 
purpose in committees and subpoenas, 
the Kilbourn case. In that case, the 
Court ruled the congressional inves-
tigation unconstitutional because its 
real purpose was not to consider legis-
lative 
reforms, 
as 
the 
House 
has 
claimed, but rather to investigate pos-
sible crimes by this citizen, a power 
only 
the 
executive 
and 
judicial 
branches have the right to exercise. 
That is what we see happening here 
today. 
This committee is illegitimate. It 
has violated its own rules of creation. 
It has violated its own rules of creation 
and it says they want to find out this 
massive truth here about what hap-
pened on January 6. You can’t have a 
committee to find out what happened 
because you are interested. You can’t 
do that. And that is what they are 
doing today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Indiana is recognized for 
45 seconds, if you are prepared to close. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Again, what you have heard today 
proves what we have said all along. 
This select committee is not at all in-
terested in doing anything to prevent 
something like January 6 from ever 
happening again. It is all about bury-
ing their political opponents. That is 
what they are about to do today by 
holding Mr. Meadows in contempt. It is 
what they have already done two times 
before. It is an absolute shame. We 
shouldn’t allow it to happen. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
against this resolution today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. CHENEY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, President Trump is 
hiding behind executive privilege. All 
of my colleagues, all of them knew 
that what happened on January 6 was 
an assault on our Constitution. They 
knew it at the time, yet now they are 
defending the indefensible. 
Whether we tell the truth, get to the 
truth and defend ourselves against it 
ever happening again is the moral test 
of our time. How we address January 6 
is the moral test of our generation. 
It is very sad to see how my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
are addressing this issue. Mr. Meadows

December 14, 2021 
has refused to testify about nonprivi-
leged material. He is in contempt. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
I thank my colleague from Wyoming 
for supporting this effort of the com-
mittee. She has been a wonderful mem-
ber of the committee, and I look for-
ward to continuing the relationship. 
I thank my colleagues who presented 
on the majority side today who made a 
clear case of why Mr. Meadows’ defi-
ance is unacceptable. 
I take no joy in having to ask this 
House to make this referral. Mr. Mead-
ows served here with us for 7 years, but 
that doesn’t excuse his conduct. If any-
thing, he should know better. 
It is disappointing that he put him-
self in this category with a small hand-
ful of uncooperative witnesses who are 
drawing out a lot of attention hiding 
behind every privilege you can think of 
trying to slow down and slow-walk this 
process. We want to hear from them 
all. 
But we have heard from more than 
300 witnesses. Just this week, three sig-
nificant individuals have already come 
in and spoken with us on the record. As 
you have heard, last night and today, 
we have made some significant find-
ings. This investigation is moving 
ahead swiftly, but even with all that 
cooperation, we need to send a clear 
message that this sort of defiance of 
the rule of law cannot stand. 
We need to hear from Mr. Meadows, 
and his refusal to appear is plain and 
simple contempt. 
I ask all Members to support this res-
olution, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to the rule, the previous 
question is ordered on the resolution. 
The question is on the resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

FURTHER MESSAGE FROM THE 
SENATE 
A further message from the Senate 
by Ms. Byrd, one of its clerks, an-
nounced that the Senate has agreed to 
a joint resolution of the following title 
in which the concurrence of the House 
is requested: 
S.J. Res. 33. Joint Resolution relating to 
increasing the debt limit. 
f 
COMBATING INTERNATIONAL 
ISLAMOPHOBIA ACT 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, pursu-
ant to House Resolution 849, I call up 
the bill (H.R. 5665) to establish in the 
Department of State the Office to Mon-
itor and Combat Islamophobia, and for 
other purposes, and ask for its imme-
diate consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. CAS-
TOR
of Florida). Pursuant to House 
Resolution 849, in lieu of the amend-
ments recommended by the Committee 
on Foreign Affairs, printed in the bill, 
an amendment in the nature of a sub-
stitute consisting of the text of Rules 
Committee Print 117–23, modified by

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude 
extraneous 
material 
in 
the 
RECORD on H.R. 5665. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 5665, the Combating Inter-
national Islamophobia Act. 
Before I continue, let me insert in 
the RECORD a Statement of Adminis-
tration Policy, which begins by stat-
ing: ‘‘The administration supports pas-
sage of H.R. 5665, the Combating Inter-
national Islamophobia Act.’’ And ‘‘Our 
country’s commitment to defending 
freedom of religion and belief goes 
back centuries, and the administration 
strongly believes that people of all 
faiths 
and 
backgrounds 
should 
be 
treated with equal dignity and respect 
around the world.’’ 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 
5665—COMBATTING
INTERNATIONAL 
ISLAMOPHOBIA ACT—REP. OMAR, D–MN, AND 56 
CO-SPONSORS 
The Administration supports passage of 
H.R. 
5665, 
the 
Combating 
International 
Islamophobia Act. Religious freedom is a 
fundamental human right. This freedom is 
enshrined in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and is also part of the First 
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Our 
country’s commitment to defending freedom 
of religion and belief goes back centuries, 
and the Administration strongly believes 
that people of all faiths and backgrounds 
should be treated with equal dignity and re-
spect around the world. 
The Administration also supports language 
in H.R. 5665 that calls attention to instances 
of forced labor, reeducation, or the presence 
of concentration camps, such as those tar-
geting Uyghur and other minorities in the 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the 
People’s Republic of China. 
The Administration looks forward to work-
ing with Congress to ensure the Secretary of 
State has the necessary flexibility and per-
missive authority to designate such an office 
and special envoy and to provide for an an-
nual report monitoring concerning acts of 
Islamophobia in foreign countries. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I could 
not agree more. The world is seeing an 
alarming rise in anti-Muslim senti-
ment and violence, and we are wit-
nessing those same trends, unfortu-
nately, here in the United States of 
America. 
In recent years, anti-Muslim bigotry 
has been on the rise with mosques 
being vandalized and Muslims beaten 
and attacked and elected officials on 
the receiving end of death threats and 
other hateful rhetoric all due to their 
Muslim faith. 
Bigotry is unacceptable, and it is in-
cumbent on all of us to condemn it 
wherever and whenever it occurs. 
b 1815 
The great Reverend Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr., said: ‘‘Injustice any-
where is a threat to justice every-
where.’’ Not only must we address anti- 
Muslim bigotry here in the United 
States, but we are also obligated to 
confront that bigotry wherever and 
whenever we see it happening around 
the world. 
In 2019, New Zealand witnessed the 
worst terrorist attack in that nation’s 
history when a white supremacist gun-
man killed 51 Muslim worshippers and 
injured 40 others at two mosques. 
Just last week, here on the House 
floor, we discussed the horrific atroc-
ities being committed against Uyghur 
Muslims in China and the Rohingya 
Muslims in Burma. We did it in a bipar-
tisan way with my good friend and col-
league Mr. MCCAUL. That is who we 
should be, and that is what we should 
represent because freedom of religion 
is a fundamental human right, and no 
one should be the target of discrimina-
tion because of their faith. 
Prior to considering H.R. 5665, the 
House Committee on Foreign Affairs 
held numerous hearings, including with 
Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, 
U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Green-
field, and leading academics across the 
country that discussed and better in-
formed our understanding of anti-Mus-
lim bigotry and Islamophobia. 
With the passage of H.R. 5665, the es-
tablishment of an office at the State 
Department 
to 
help 
combat 
the 
scourge of Islamophobia, we take an 
important step toward addressing this 
problem. That is why I am proud to 
support the Combating International 
Islamophobia Act. This important leg-
islation would do three very, very im-
portant but simple things. First, it 
would establish an office to monitor 
and combat Islamophobia at the State 
Department. Second, it would provide 
the authority to the executive branch 
to appoint a special envoy for moni-
toring and combating Islamophobia. 
And third, it will help to improve State 
Department reporting on threats to 
Muslims around the world. 
Now, several of my colleagues on the 
other side have stated that they oppose 
this bill, that the bill does not define 
Islamophobia, but I believe, and I think 
they seem to have an awareness, as we 
all do, for Islamophobia when they 
criticize the bill for not doing enough 
to address Islamophobia against the 
Uyghur population in China. 
Madam Speaker, discrimination and 
bigotry are abhorrent, and combating 
them is something which we should all 
be able to do together. That is why I 
am so heartened to see this important 
piece of legislation being led by a Mus-
lim Member of Congress and a Jewish 
Member of Congress. I wish I could say 
by a Democratic Member of Congress 
and a Republican Member of Congress. 
That would be the right message to 
send to the world. 
Discrimination and bigotry bring out 
the worst in humanity. I know that my 
friend and colleague feels the same 
way. I know he does, as do many of my 
colleagues on the other side. But we 
have to stand up and say it right here 
on the floor so the world knows what 
we stand for. If left unchecked, they 
can lead to terrible atrocities, to 
crimes against humanity, and even to 
genocide. So this legislation will help 
shine a light on this problem and help 
address the global rise of Islamophobia 
at a time in which Islamophobia re-
mains rampant. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly encour-
age all Members of this House to sup-
port this very timely and important 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7796 
December 14, 2021 
Madam Speaker, let me just say to 
my good friend, Chairman MEEKS, we 
all deplore anti-Muslim persecution. 
No one should ever be attacked or de-
nied their human rights or dignity be-
cause of their faith. So, we actually 
agree on the intent and the spirit be-
hind this. But I do have some concerns 
with the wording in many parts of this 
legislation. 
Madam Speaker, the United States 
Government is rightly committed to 
opposing these monstrous acts of vio-
lence that we have seen directed at 
Muslims around the world. This in-
cludes the horrific mosque shootings in 
Switzerland, Quebec, and Christchurch. 
Our commitment must also apply to 
anti-Muslim persecution by foreign re-
gimes, especially when it amounts to 
genocide. I am proud of our bipartisan 
work to condemn and punish the Bur-
mese military’s genocide against the 
Rohingya Muslims that began in 2016. 
We are also working in a bipartisan 
fashion to oppose the Chinese Com-
munist 
Party’s 
ongoing 
genocide 
against the Uyghur Muslims that we 
passed together in a bipartisan manner 
on this floor just the other day. 
Today, more than 1 million Muslims 
and other ethnic and religious minori-
ties are held in camps and exploited as 
slave labor. Muslim children are ripped 
from their mothers’ arms to be raised 
by the Communist Party. Muslim 
women are suffering systematic sexual 
violence, 
forced 
sterilization, 
and 
forced abortion. 
Members on our side are fully com-
mitted to combating these anti-Muslim 
atrocities. I am proud of the work, 
again, that Chairman MEEKS
and I 
were able to do together to hold the 
Chinese Communist Party accountable 
for their genocide, and I thank the gen-
tleman for his efforts. 
In addition, I am pleased that right 
after this bill, Chairman MCGOVERN, 
who has worked so hard with this com-
mittee, and Senator MARCO RUBIO in 
the Senate will finally be able to send 
to the President’s desk a bipartisan, bi-
cameral bill to combat the forced labor 
that supports the CCP’s Uyghur geno-
cide. 
Unfortunately, the rushed, partisan 
bill before us today does not live up to 
these two serious bipartisan efforts. 
Committee Democrats made no effort 
to work toward a bipartisan agreement 
before the markup, and the bill has no 
Republican cosponsors. 
This legislation is dangerously vague 
and 
unnecessarily 
duplicative. 
It 
doesn’t frame things in terms of anti- 
Muslim persecution, nor does it use the 
typical statutory language like ‘‘gross 
violations of internationally recog-
nized human rights.’’ 
Instead, 
it 
uses 
the 
undefined, 
nonlegal term of ‘‘Islamophobia.’’ This 
word appears nowhere in the Federal 
statutes. It is so vague and subjective 
that it could be used against legitimate 
speech for partisan purposes. Even the 
term 
‘‘phobia’’ 
connotes 
irrational 
fear, not discrimination. 
The bill also completely ignores the 
State Department’s extensive efforts 
already underway to protect the rights 
of Muslims. Regular monitoring and re-
porting are already carried out by 
human rights officers or embassies 
worldwide, as well as the Bureau of De-
mocracy, Human Rights, and Labor; 
the Office of International Religious 
Freedom; and the U.S. Commission on 
International Religious Freedom. 
The annual ‘‘Country Reports’’ on 
human rights contain detailed, coun-
try-specific narratives of human rights 
violations targeting Muslims. The ‘‘An-
nual Report on International Religious 
Freedom’’ details anti-Muslim abuses 
and U.S. Government policy to address 
such challenges. 
In addition, the current nominee to 
serve as the Ambassador at Large for 
International 
Religious 
Freedom, 
Rashad Hussain, is a prominent Mus-
lim American. 
Madam Speaker, the lack of a special 
envoy is not a sign of bigotry. In fact, 
there is no special envoy for the hun-
dreds of millions of Christians who face 
dangerous 
persecution 
today. 
Also, 
there is no special envoy for the Hindus 
or the Buddhists or the Baha’is or the 
Yazidis or many other people of faith 
who experience persecution. 
We have heard a lot from the other 
side about the office and special envoy 
on anti-Semitism, and I imagine that 
we will continue to hear about this 
during this debate. But while the word-
ing of today’s bill is modeled after the 
two prior anti-Semitism bills, the proc-
ess has been completely different and 
inadequate. 
Both bills, in 2004 and 2020, came 
after dedicated hearings showing the 
need for specialized legislation. The 
second bill is based on 16 years of expe-
rience before a Senate-confirmed spe-
cial envoy was added. 
In stark contrast, today’s bill is the 
result of a hurried, partisan push over 
the last 6 days. This legislation was in-
troduced less than 2 months ago. We 
have not held any hearings focused on 
whether the new State Department bu-
reaucracy 
is 
needed 
or 
useful 
to 
counter anti-Muslim hate. 
Finally, today we received the oddest 
Statement of Administration Policy 
that I can ever recall, basically saying 
that while the administration supports 
passage of the bill, it would like for 
this bill to be rewritten. This State De-
partment would like for this bill to be 
rewritten. Why aren’t we consulting 
with the State Department to get this 
bill right before we throw it on the 
House floor and pass it with such 
haste? 
In it, the administration also says 
that it wants to include language to 
‘‘ensure the Secretary of State has the 
necessary flexibility and permissive 
authority to designate such an office 
and special envoy.’’ In other words, the 
administration doesn’t want to be re-
quired to create this office and posi-
tion, as this bill mandates. 
Combating 
religious 
persecution 
against all people of faith, including 
Muslims, is a serious issue, and it de-
serves the kind of serious attention 
that draws bipartisan support. I also 
believe that a definition for clarity as 
to what Islamophobia is and how it 
would apply should be done through 
the legislative intent of the Congress 
and not left up to the bureaucracy in 
the State Department. 
Unfortunately, the text has been 
rushed to the floor. It is vague and re-
dundant, as I have said. For that rea-
son, I do oppose it. 
I am going to get, later, into some 
definitions of Islamophobia from var-
ious scholars and lawyerly articles 
that really bring out how vague this 
term is. We are not saying we are pro-
tecting against persecution of Muslims 
or international human rights for Mus-
lims. It is Islamophobia that I think 
draws the most scrutiny to this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Minnesota (Ms. OMAR), the sponsor of 
this most timely bill. 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise because 
we are in the midst of a staggering rise 
of anti-Muslim violence and discrimi-
nation around the world. At its worst, 
it is Uyghurs in concentration camps 
in China and genocide against the 
Rohingya in Burma. But those atroc-
ities are part of a deeper fabric of vio-
lence against Muslims and impunity 
for violence against Muslims at a glob-
al level. 
In India, Prime Minister Modi’s gov-
ernment has moved to strip citizenship 
from millions of Muslims. In Sri 
Lanka, anti-Muslim laws and violence 
have imposed terror on the commu-
nity. In Hungary, Belarus, and Poland, 
politicians have stoked fear of Muslim 
migrants and refugees. In New Zealand 
and Canada, white supremacist vio-
lence has targeted Muslims, including 
at their places of worship. And, of 
course, we in the United States are not 
immune to this hatred. 
It is no secret that the previous 
President of the United States explic-
itly vowed ‘‘a total and complete shut-
down of Muslims entering the United 
States.’’ But Trump was simply taking 
advantage of a deeper 
culture 
of 
Islamophobia that has existed for the 
past two decades, from the PATRIOT 
Act to the CVE program to Abu 
Ghraib. 
b 1830 
None of these things are happening in 
isolation. We must understand that 
these problems are interlinked. In fact, 
earlier this year the United Nations 
commissioned a report and concluded 
that Islamophobia has reached ‘‘epi-
demic proportions,’’ and urged nations 
around the world to take all necessary 
measures to combat it. 
As a country that was founded on re-
ligious liberty, our leadership on inter-
national religious freedom depends on

recognizing that Islamophobia is global 
in scope and we must lead the global 
effort to address it. That is why Rep-
resentative SCHAKOWSKY and I have in-
troduced this bill, to create a special 
envoy for monitoring and combating 
Islamophobia at the State Department. 
This bill also adds violence and in-
citement targeted at Muslims to the 
State 
Department’s 
annual 
human 
rights report and international reli-
gious freedom report. 
There are cynics who would rather 
see us divided on racial, ethnic, gender, 
and religious lines because it suits 
their political agenda. But I believe as 
Americans we should stand united 
against all forms of bigotry. 
In fact, this legislation is modeled on 
the special envoy to combat anti-Semi-
tism, and I was proud to cosponsor and 
vote last Congress on legislation to ele-
vate that envoy to a cabinet-level posi-
tion. 
Because it is important, Madam 
Speaker, that we live in a world where 
everyone is free of persecution based on 
their religious background and beliefs. 
And until everyone is free to practice 
their religion, no one is. 
I want to thank the colead of this 
bill, a partner in justice, Representa-
tive 
JAN
SCHAKOWSKY, 
along 
with 
Chairman MEEKS, Speaker PELOSI, and 
the leadership team for their commit-
ment to this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I also want to thank 
the Council on American-Islamic Rela-
tions for their advocacy on this, and all 
the groups representing a cross-section 
of human rights, civil rights, and faith 
coalitions, 
who 
fight 
for 
religious 
rights for everyone around the world. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. CHABOT), a member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
this evening in opposition to H.R. 5665. 
All Americans can agree that perse-
cution against any person or any group 
on the basis of religion is wrong. Reli-
gious tolerance is a fundamental value 
upon which this Nation was founded, 
which is why the free exercise of reli-
gion is protected in the very first 
amendment to our Constitution. 
That same fundamental principle is 
why I persistently, in a bipartisan 
manner, supported the Rohingya Mus-
lims who have been oppressed, victim-
ized, and suffered genocide at the hands 
of the Burmese military. This principle 
also explains why the Ambassador At 
Large for International Religious Free-
dom and two other human rights of-
fices at the State Department are al-
ready doing the work called for in this 
legislation. 
However, the reasons to oppose this 
bill go beyond mere redundancy. It is 
also 
significantly 
flawed 
because 
Democrats have refused to include a 
definition 
of 
Islamophobia 
and 
Islamophobic 
incitement—the 
very 
subject matter the bill purports to ad-
dress. In fact, Democrats voted down 
an amendment that I offered in com-
mittee to exclude legitimate criticism 
from what counts as Islamophobia. 
As a result, this bill doesn’t make it 
clear whether the term Islamophobia 
includes, for example, criticizing rad-
ical Islamic terrorist groups or calling 
out the persecution of Christians. Is it 
Islamophobic to oppose unacceptably 
intolerant blasphemy laws, or criticize 
those who call for the destruction of 
Israel? 
What about criticizing the Taliban’s 
brutal repression of women, or con-
demning those who deny the Holo-
caust, as Iran’s Supreme Leader has re-
peatedly done? 
While clearly, none of these criti-
cisms 
should 
be 
considered 
Islamophobic, it is deeply concerning 
that this bill’s supporters have refused 
to protect such legitimate free speech. 
Thus, this legislation could be used to 
label almost any criticism of Islam, in-
cluding criticism of Sharia law as 
Islamophobic. 
It is almost as if its goal is to shut 
down all debate and protect Islam from 
any criticism in polite society. Thus, 
we get to the core problem of this bill— 
it treats the persecution of Muslims as 
uniquely unacceptable. Let’s face it, 
pretty much every religion faces perse-
cution, as anyone who has studied his-
tory can attest. 
Arguably, Christians endured global 
persecution equal to or worse than 
Muslims. Further, Hindus, the Falun 
Gong, the Baha’is, Tibetan Buddhists, 
even atheists all experience repression 
on some corner of the globe. While 
Muslims do face heinous genocides in 
China 
and 
Burma, 
Christians 
and 
Yazidis also faced genocide at the 
hands of the Islamic State not long 
ago. 
Finally, this legislation ill-advisedly 
evaluates the persecution of Muslims 
to a special category similar to the leg-
islation that created the special envoy 
to combat anti-Semitism. Unlike al-
leged Islamophobia, anti-Semitism is a 
truly unique problem. In the aftermath 
of the Holocaust, the world realized 
just how pernicious anti-Semitism was 
and has been for centuries, and rightly 
sought to eliminate it. 
Putting Islamophobia in the same 
category as anti-Semitism dramati-
cally understates, even trivializes the 
historic and pervasive nature that 
makes anti-Semitism such a difficult 
problem to overcome. Such a dan-
gerous false equivalence might be used 
by extremists to justify further anti- 
Semitic activity. 
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I 
urge my colleagues to oppose this leg-
islation. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, let me 
just reply to Mr. MCCAUL earlier that 
the anti-Semitism legislation was in-
troduced on January 3 of 2019, passed 
the House on January 11 of 2019. There 
were no hearings that were held that 
last Congress before we passed the 
vote, and there was no markup, as we 
had in our committee this year at all. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
SCHAKOWSKY), the cosponsor of this leg-
islation. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I rise as a proud colead of the Com-
bating International Islamophobia Act. 
In the United States alone, nearly 70 
percent of American Muslims have re-
ported personally experiencing anti- 
Muslim hate, bigotry, and even vio-
lence. This anti-Muslim hate isn’t just 
confined to certain communities and 
areas of this country. It has reached 
out in ugly ways, including in my own 
community, in my own district, to a 
member of my staff and her family. 
My colleagues and friends in Con-
gress know that Congresswoman ILHAN 
OMAR, the chief sponsor of this legisla-
tion, knows all about this in far too 
personal a way. She has been subjected 
to relentless attacks and horrifying 
threats, not just from her fellow Amer-
icans, but even within the Halls of Con-
gress. Enough is enough. 
This should not be a controversial 
bill. We have had a special envoy to 
monitor and combat anti-Semitism for 
years, and I proudly support that of-
fice’s work. As a Jew myself, I see the 
parallel quite directly between anti- 
Semitism and Islamophobia, and we 
need to be combating both. 
As a Nation that prides itself on de-
fending human rights and standing up 
against hate and bigotry, creating a 
special envoy to monitor and combat 
Islamophobia makes perfect sense. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to do 
what is right, which is to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
the 
Combating 
International 
Islamophobia Act. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY), a member 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to represent south central Penn-
sylvania, where there is a large com-
munity of Ahmadiyya Muslims, the 
most persecuted—the most persecuted 
Muslims—in the Muslim faith, but yet 
there is nothing in this bill to safe-
guard them. 
As a matter of fact, many of my col-
leagues have and will continue to 
speak about the lack of definition be-
cause it is going to be made up, ladies 
and gentlemen, it is just going to be 
made up based on your political pro-
clivities. You are either going to be 
persecuted or you are not, depending 
on who you are and who you vote for. 
Let’s face it, aside from the attempts 
to placate an anti-Semitic Member of 
this Chamber, all that is really hap-
pening here is that House Democrats 
are deflecting from the real issue con-
fronting the House of Representatives, 
and that is that the maker of this bill 
has no business sitting on House com-
mittees, has no business in this Cham-
ber—a myriad of anti-Semitic com-
ments and those of support of violence 
and terrorisms against the United 
States are wholly unacceptable. But we 
are not going to deal with that because 
we are going to deal with this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7798 
December 14, 2021 
Let’s not forget the moment the au-
thor of this bill breathtakingly re-
ferred to the murder of nearly 3,000 
Americans on 9/11 by Islamist terror-
ists as some people who did some 
thing—some people who did something. 
During last week’s markup of this 
legislation in the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, I was assailed by my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle, they told 
me I was Islamophobic, nasty, mean, 
and rude. Why? 
Because I offered amendments that 
would have prevented American tax 
dollars from going to organizations 
with ties to terrorism. Ties to ter-
rorism. You would think that that 
would be something we could agree on 
because we all agree that nobody 
should be persecuted based on their 
faith. We all agree on that. 
But American taxpayers shouldn’t be 
forced to pay terrorist organizations; 
organizations that the maker of this 
bill is affiliated with, like the one that 
is an unindicted co-conspirator in the 
largest terror finance case in the 
United States of America’s history. 
Not because I say so, because the judge 
says so. 
By intentionally leaving the defini-
tion of Islamophobia blank in this bill, 
the gentlelady and my friends on the 
other side of the aisle are creating an 
office in our State Department that 
will likely spew anti-Semitic hatred 
and attack Western ideas throughout 
the world under the farce of protecting 
Islam. 
As you can see by this debate, the 
goal is to silence dissent and critics of 
terrorism. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will suspend. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, we 
want to take down the words. I ask 
that the words be taken down. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania will take 
his seat. 
(1945) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the words. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
You are either going to be persecuted or 
you are not, depending on who you are and 
who you vote for. 
Let’s face it, aside from the attempts to 
placate an anti-Semitic Member of this 
Chamber, all that is really happening here is 
House Democrats are deflecting from the 
real issue confronting the House of Rep-
resentatives, and that is that the maker of 
this bill has no business sitting on House 
committees, has no business in this Cham-
ber—a myriad of anti-Semitic comments and 
those of support of violence and terrorisms 
against the United States are wholly unac-
ceptable. But we are not going to deal with 
that because we are going to deal with this. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will further report the words. 
The Clerk continued to read as fol-
lows: 
But 
American 
taxpayers 
shouldn’t 
be 
forced to pay terrorist organizations; organi-
zations that the maker of this bill is affili-
ated with, like the one that is an unindicted 
co-conspirator in the largest terror finance 
case in the United States of America’s his-
tory. Not because I say so, because the judge 
says so. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair is prepared to rule. The words 
from the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
contain an allegation that the ‘‘maker 
of the bill’’ is affiliated with a terrorist 
organization. This remark impugns the 
patriotism or loyalty of a Member of 
the House, which is not in order as 
stated in section 370 of the House Rules 
and 
Manual. 
The 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania also alleges that the 
‘‘maker of the bill’’ is anti-Semitic. 
This remark constitutes an allegation 
of discrimination, which is not in order 
as stated in section 370 of the House 
Rules and Manual. The gentlewoman 
from Minnesota is the sponsor of this 
measure, H.R. 5665, as reflected in the 
official records of the House. There-
fore, the Chair finds that the remarks 
constitute personalities directed to-
ward an identifiable Member. 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I have a 
parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. BIGGS. I have several inquiries, 
if I might. I am not trying to press. I 
am trying to understand. 
The first one is did the Speaker and 
the Parliamentarian distinguish or 
identify by the term ‘‘author’’ of the 
bill, ‘‘maker’’ of the bill, or ‘‘sponsor’’ 
of the bill when making its ruling and 
determination in this case? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair has addressed that in the ruling. 
Does the gentleman have an addi-
tional inquiry? 
Mr. BIGGS. Yes, I do. Thank you. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his inquiry. 
Mr. BIGGS. My question is regarding 
the determination that these words 
were nonparliamentary. What is the 
extent of the protection of the debate 
and speech clause, vis-a-vis, for in-
stance, when we have had a resolution 
to strip a Member of committee, an-
other resolution to strip a different 
Member of committee this year. And 
during the debate of that we had all 
kinds of aspersions and comments, and 
if these allegations, which were put 
forward by the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania are accurate and can be de-
fended, was that taken into account in 
both the context and his terms, this 
taking into account, when you made 
the determination that his speech was 
nonparliamentary. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair is not going to provide an advi-
sory opinion. 
Mr. BIGGS. I am not asking for an 
advisory opinion. I am asking what you 
took into account with the Parliamen-
tarian to determine that his words 
were nonparliamentary. That is what I 
am asking. And I have given you con-
text and relationship of previous ac-
tions, and I have asked for specifically 
how you limited the speech and debate 
clause here, and whether the fact that 
he has documentation to prove his as-
sertions or not or whether they are rel-
evant. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair relied on section 370 of the House 
Rules and Manual as stated in the rul-
ing. 
Mr. BIGGS. Thank you. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS) a member of 
the Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of passage of H.R. 5665, and com-
mend 
its 
sponsor, 
Representative 
OMAR, and my colleague from Illinois, 
Representative SCHAKOWSKY, for its in-
troduction. 
I was taught early in life to accen-
tuate the positive, eliminate the nega-
tive, and don’t mess around with Mis-
ter-In-Between. 
This resolution reaffirms many of the 
principles in practice that we have 
been taught and learned that religion 
is sacrosanct, that religion is sacred, 
and every person deserves to have their 
religious thoughts, ideas, and ideology 
protected. 
I urge support and passage of this 
legislation. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Tennessee, (Mr. BURCHETT), a member 
of the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I oppose this bill, Madam Speaker, 
because it is redundant and will grow a 
State Department bureaucracy that is 
already overgrown. This is the same 
State Department that already has two 
bureaus tasked with this issue. 
I wish someone would tell me what 
exactly it is these bureaucrats are 
doing now, since they now need a third 
department to help them do their job. 
These are the same State Depart-
ment bureaucrats who spent 4 years 
undermining the foreign policy of a Re-
publican President from deep within 
the government. Now they are getting 
a pass from the Biden administration 
to be soft on China, soft on Russia, and 
of course, soft on Iran. 
And the Democrats in the House 
want us to spend even more taxpayer 
money on this already bloated bureauc-
racy, Madam Speaker. 
For my friends across the aisle, the 
solution always seems to be throwing 
more money at a problem. 
After 3 years in the House, I am be-
ginning to realize that, for the Demo-
crats in Congress, our tax dollars are 
nothing more than political duct tape. 
The problem with duct tape, Madam 
Speaker, is it does not actually fix any-
thing, contrary to what some people 
believe. Like growing government and 
spending more money, duct tape is not 
a solution. 
So here is an idea I wish my friends 
across the aisle and President Biden 
would consider: Rather than feeding 
the beast, let’s cut the State Depart-
ment’s budget until the bureaucrats

deep within decide to get back to work 
for the American people. 
Instead of pushing a woke globalist 
agenda, Secretary of State Blinkin 
needs to call his workers back to the 
office, rather than letting them con-
tinue to stay home while passports and 
visa applications go unprocessed for 
American citizens and visitors. 
Let’s not waste our constituents’ 
hard-earned tax dollars playing poli-
tics. Our government is big enough. We 
can do without another dadgum bu-
reaucracy at the State Department. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. LEVIN), a member of the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, Islamophobia is a problem 
across the world, including in my own 
district, 
where 
one 
of 
the 
many 
mosques that I represent was vandal-
ized last year. 
It is a problem in this body, where 
only four Muslims have ever served, 
and where the most visible among 
them, Congresswoman OMAR, has been 
the subject of horrible anti-Muslim at-
tacks. 
And it is obviously a problem abroad, 
even rising to the level of genocide in 
Burma and China. 
I am a Jewish Member of Congress 
who considers fighting all forms of op-
pression and all instances of religious 
discrimination core to my faith. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s all come together 
and reaffirm that cardinal American 
value, freedom of religion. Let’s pass 
this law as a step towards protecting 
the rights of the world’s 1.8 million 
Muslims and an integral part of our 
work to win freedom and security for 
all people everywhere. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. BARR), a member of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
ranking member of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee for yielding. 
I rise in opposition to this legisla-
tion. Mr. Speaker, Islamophobia is 
wrong, just as anti-Semitism, anti- 
Christian hatred, and all forms of dis-
crimination based on race or religion 
are wrong. 
But this bill, despite whatever the 
author and defenders of this legislation 
claim as its purpose or their intent, is 
not 
targeted 
to 
counter 
actual 
Islamophobia. 
In fact, this bill is so poorly drafted, 
any objective analysis of it raises seri-
ous concerns about what the true in-
tentions of the bill are because it spe-
cifically does not define Islamophobia. 
This lack of definition not only risks 
confusing U.S. foreign policy, but it 
also would compromise U.S. counter-
terrorism efforts and undermine our 
national security. 
What we need, Mr. Speaker, and what 
this bill fails to provide is moral clar-
ity. We don’t need nuance or political 
correctness or silencing debate or cen-
sorship on the issue of radical Islamic 
terrorism. What we need is intellectual 
and moral clarity. 
b 2000 
Before 9/11, radical Islamic terrorists 
were at war with the United States. 
That was before 9/11. Since then, rad-
ical Islamic terrorists have been at war 
with the United States. 
Now, you may wish that wasn’t the 
case, but it is a historical fact. If you 
cannot even acknowledge who the 
enemy is or that we are at war with 
them, then how can you expect to de-
feat that enemy? 
We must face the truth, the truth 
that there is a very real struggle with-
in the Islamic world between religious 
tolerance, the purported goal of this 
bill, and an evil, toxic intolerance, the 
potential byproduct of this bill that 
says if you are a Christian or if you are 
a Jew or if you are a moderate Muslim, 
then you must be destroyed. 
This bill, either unintentionally or 
by design, gives voice to this toxic reli-
gious intolerance by failing to exclude 
from the definition of Islamophobia 
any policy or viewpoint that rejects 
radical Islamic terrorism. 
This ideology of evil and extreme re-
ligious intolerance must be confronted 
with clarity, as much as each indi-
vidual act of terrorism. And an over-
inclusive definition of Islamophobia 
threatens to encourage the very extre-
mism that we all say we oppose. 
Is it Islamophobia to criticize the 
Taliban, a self-proclaimed Islamic or-
ganization, when they commit grave 
human 
rights 
abuses 
and 
oppress 
women? 
Is it Islamophobia to criticize re-
joining the Joint Comprehensive Plan 
of Action when talking about the ma-
lign, theocratic Islamic Republic of 
Iran, the leaders of which chant, 
‘‘Death to America,’’ and promise the 
destruction of the State of Israel? 
Is it Islamophobia to condemn Hamas 
when they are firing rockets on inno-
cent Israelis from Gaza? 
Is it Islamophobia to criticize some-
one who dismissively, derisively, and 
defensively refers to 9/11 hijackers as 
‘‘people who did some things’’? 
These actions are not Islamophobic. 
These are beliefs motivated out of se-
curity and fact. However, we are voting 
shortly on a bill that actually does 
combat 
Islamophobia, 
real 
Islamophobia, a bipartisan bill to com-
bat the forced labor of Uyghur people 
and the systemic genocide of peaceful 
Muslim minorities by the Chinese 
Communist Party. 
Mr. Speaker, that bill makes a clear, 
defined difference. This bill does not. 
Simply 
saying 
we 
are 
against 
Islamophobia without clearly and cor-
rectly defining it and establishing an 
office within the State Department to 
combat it without safeguards against 
the relativist views of the politically 
correct is an invitation to weaponize 
our foreign policy against itself. We 
must deal with this problem as it is, 
not as we would hope it to be. 
History teaches us that when Islamic 
extremists 
and 
jihadists 
are 
not 
fought, they grow. Their movement 
metastasizes. The longer they are not 
confronted, the more they become 
emboldened. The more they are ap-
peased and tolerated, the more they 
overrun territories in the areas they 
occupy and secure safe havens from 
which they can launch attacks against 
the United States and the West. 
As a member of the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs, I was more than dis-
appointed that my Democratic col-
leagues, many of whom I respect very, 
very much, rejected a good faith 
amendment in our markup to clearly 
define what Islamophobia actually is. 
We do have a Special Envoy to Mon-
itor and Combat Anti-Semitism who 
works off an internationally adopted 
definition of anti-Semitism. But the 
way this bill is structured fails to ac-
knowledge that a policy of countering 
jihad is not, never has been, and never 
will be Islamophobia. And the bill es-
tablishes an office that would actually 
undermine the very mission of the Spe-
cial Envoy to Monitor and Combat 
Anti-Semitism. 
In sum, this bill, without definitional 
restraint, will invite anti-Semitism 
and anti-Christian bias into State De-
partment decisionmaking, and it will 
do so under the guise of combating 
Islamophobia. That is what this bill 
will do without definition. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. KIL-
DEE). The time of the gentleman has 
expired. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. BARR. Maybe this bill is well-in-
tentioned, but if we don’t agree to 
some kind of definition, if we do not 
provide some clarity—moral clarity, 
intellectual clarity—as to who the 
enemy is versus what Islamophobia is, 
then what we have here in this bill is a 
wolf in sheep’s clothing. Nuance and 
political correctness will not help us 
defeat our enemy, and it leaves peace-
ful practitioners of Islam robbed of the 
definition that they truly deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge 
my colleagues to oppose this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, clearly, we 
are not here to talk about criticism. 
We are here to talk about persecution. 
We are here to talk about anti-Muslim 
hate. We are even here to talk about 
genocide. And we should know it when 
we see it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
LEE). 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 5665, the 
Combating International Islamophobia 
Act. I thank my friend, Congress-
woman ILHAN OMAR, for her leadership 
on this issue, and also Chairman 
MEEKS and the Speaker for bringing 
this bill to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, the bill creates mecha-
nisms for the State Department to 
monitor 
and 
combat

Islamophobia. There are approximately 
1.8 billion Muslims in the world, in-
cluding 3.5 million Muslims in the 
United States. 
Now, 
the 
truth 
is, 
while 
Islamophobia 
is 
not 
a 
new 
phe-
nomenon, anti-Muslim violence has in-
creased significantly over the past 20 
years. Just ask any Muslim what 
Islamophobia is. 
We have seen incidents such as the 
terrorist attacks on mosques in New 
Zealand, 
atrocities 
against 
the 
Uyghurs in China, and Islamophobic 
laws in France that prevent girls from 
wearing the hijab in public. 
The United Nations Human Rights 
Council now says that discrimination 
and hatred toward Muslims have risen 
to epidemic portions. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 15 seconds to the gentle-
woman. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
whether in the Halls of Congress, our 
districts, or across the world, we will 
not tolerate Islamophobia. We know 
what it is. We must work together to 
end this bigotry. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 5665. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to H.R. 5665. Bringing 
this bill to the floor is nothing more 
than empty theatrics from Democrats. 
Our Nation has delivered more free-
dom, opportunity, and liberty to more 
people around the world than any na-
tion in our history. We have served as 
the arsenal of democracy and a lib-
erator of oppressed people because we 
are a good and just nation founded on 
fundamental, God-given liberties. In-
cluded among those, as part of our very 
first amendment, is the freedom of 
speech. 
Our Nation has lost precious treasure 
of our fellow countrymen to free people 
from the horrors of Islamic fundamen-
talism. We need only look at what has 
happened to women in Afghanistan 
since Biden’s disastrous and botched 
departure. Women are being stoned to 
death in the street for having the gall 
to be educated. Women are forced into 
marriages with blood-thirsty Taliban 
savages to serve as breeders of the next 
jihad. 
The fight against these kinds of 
atrocities deserves plainspoken and 
hard truths be told. Instead, the other 
side would like to sterilize free speech 
and determine what words are allowed 
under their Orwellian tyranny. 
Our Nation and the world deserve so 
much better than this ridiculous at-
tempt to stifle free speech. There is 
tremendous evil in this world. Every 
day that evil is trying to infiltrate and 
undermine our exceptional Nation. 
I will never shy away from calling 
out evil ideologies, and I will never 
back down from speaking against them 
and how they are used to oppress 
women, children, and the vulnerable. 
We must stay committed to opposing 
heinous acts of violence directed at any 
religious group around the world, but 
the fact is, the State Department is al-
ready doing this. 
This bill brought to the floor today is 
for one purpose only: to appease the 
hurt feelings of Members who them-
selves 
have 
well-documented 
back-
grounds of anti-American and anti-Se-
mitic remarks. 
I rise against this bill just as I will 
rise against any attempts to weaken 
our rights, diminish our liberties, and 
distract this body from dealing with 
real issues to strengthen our Nation 
and empower our people. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding me time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of 
the 
Combating 
International 
Islamophobia Act. 
This legislation creates an office to 
monitor and combat Islamophobia at 
the Department of State. In recent 
years, we have seen tragedies like the 
2019 Christchurch shooting, as well as 
the 
state-sponsored 
persecution 
of 
Uyghurs in China. 
My hometown of Dearborn, Michigan, 
has a very large Muslim community, 
and it is also a constant target of 
Islamophobic hate. There have been 
thousands of documented complaints of 
anti-Muslim hate and bias in the 
United States this year alone. In my 
community are good-standing Ameri-
cans. They are afraid and fearful of 
these actions, and I have heard from 
constituents who are afraid of visiting 
their mosques or going to events as a 
result. 
Passing this bill sends a strong mes-
sage about our shared commitment to 
safeguarding religious liberty world-
wide. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the Representative from the 
great State of Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise as a Christian to say as- 
salamu alaykum, which means peace 
be upon you. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5665 addresses the 
age-old question: Am I my brother’s 
and, I might add, sister’s keeper? 
If the answer is yes, then what do we 
do about it when our brothers and our 
sisters 
are 
being 
victimized 
by 
Islamophobia—threatened, 
murdered, 
killed? 
Mr. Speaker, you can’t be your 
brothers’ or sisters’ keeper without 
keeping your brothers and your sisters. 
H.R. 5665 addresses this by estab-
lishing an office to monitor and com-
bat Islamophobia in the Department of 
State. H.R. 5665 does something such 
that we can be our brothers’ and our 
sisters’ keepers. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a co-
sponsor of it, and I close with Allah 
hafiz. May God protect you. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CORREA). 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I also rise 
in strong support of the Combating 
International Islamophobia Act. 
A recent report in California found 
that 56 percent of the students in Cali-
fornia feel unsafe in their school be-
cause of their Muslim religious iden-
tity. That is not the America I know. 
Our Nation stands for many freedoms, 
including the freedom of religion. 
I am a proud sponsor of this legisla-
tion to create a special envoy to fight 
anti-Muslim hate crimes in the U.S. 
and abroad. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 5665, Combating International 
Islamophobia Act. 
I have listened to my friends on the 
other side of the aisle, and they are my 
friends. I hope that we will have the 
opportunity to work together for what 
the values of America stand for. 
I have heard my colleagues recount 
the various efforts of inhumane treat-
ment of Muslims around the world. 
This is an important statement made 
by America, to create the position of 
special envoy for monitoring and com-
bating Islamophobia that will be re-
sponsible for tracking and coordinating 
efforts to combat Islamophobia. Also, 
it would require the State Depart-
ment’s annual ‘‘Country Reports on 
Human Rights Practices’’ to include 
acts of Islamophobia. 
b 2015 
With 1 billion Muslims, the reason 
why I support this legislation is the 
statement it makes to the world about 
the values of this country, and the val-
ues of this country should be grounded 
in the fact that the religious freedom 
of all should be respected. 
Then, finally, I am really over-
whelmed by the constant battering of 
our colleague, ILHAN OMAR. To make 
her the center point of opposition in 
this place is beneath the dignity of this 
House. So by passing this legislation, 
let the world know that America’s val-
ues are valuing religious freedom and 
that we stand against the abuse of 
Muslims around the world as well as 
here in the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, this is an important 
piece of legislation. I thank the chair-
man for his leadership, and I ask my 
colleagues, 
Republicans 
and 
Demo-
crats, to support H.R. 5665. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5665, 
the Combating International Islamophobia Act,

which will address the increasing number of 
incidents of Islamophobia around the world. 
Specifically, this bill will: 
Create the position of Special Envoy for 
Monitoring and Combating Islamophobia, who 
will be responsible for tracking and coordi-
nating efforts to combat Islamophobia abroad; 
and 
Require that the State Department’s annual 
country reports on human rights practices and 
annual Report on International Religious Free-
dom include, wherever possible, assessments 
of 
the 
nature 
and 
extent 
of 
acts 
of 
Islamophobia and Islamophobic incitement 
that occur abroad. 
As Islamophobia rises globally, it is vital that 
the State Department have senior personnel in 
place charged with understanding, reporting 
on, and combating this scourge worldwide. 
In recent decades, we have seen a stag-
gering rise in incidents of violent Islamophobia 
worldwide. 
Whether it is the atrocities being committed 
against the Uyghurs in China and the 
Rohingya in Burma, the brutal crackdowns on 
Muslim populations in India and Sri Lanka, the 
scapegoating of Muslim refugees and other 
Muslims in Hungary and Poland, the acts of 
white supremacist violence targeting Muslims 
in New Zealand and Canada, or the targeting 
of minority Muslim communities in Muslim-ma-
jority countries like Pakistan, Bahrain, and 
Iran, it is time for us as policymakers to under-
stand these problems as interconnected and 
genuinely global. 
A staggering number of people have experi-
enced anti-Muslim hate in their lifetime; a 
number that has only inflated since 9/11. 
America is home to one of the most diverse 
Muslim populations in the world, including 
people of almost every ethnicity, country, and 
school of thought. 
Approximately one third of the community is 
African American, one third is of South Asian 
descent, one quarter is of Arab descent, and 
the rest are from all over the world, including 
a growing Latino Muslim population. 
While exact numbers are difficult to estab-
lish, there are between 3–6 million American 
Muslims. About one half of this population was 
born in the U.S., a percentage that continues 
to grow as immigration slows and younger in-
dividuals start having families. 
American Muslims are present in all walks 
of life, as doctors and taxi drivers; lawyers and 
newspaper vendors; and accountants, home-
makers, academics, media personalities, ath-
letes, and entertainers. 
Although American Muslims make up ap-
proximately one percent of the U.S. popu-
lation, most Americans can name several fa-
mous American Muslims. Names like Muham-
mad Ali, Malcolm X, Mos Def, Fareed Zakaria, 
Shaquille O’Neal, Lupe Fiasco, Dr. Oz, and 
Rima Fakih are part of our popular conscious-
ness. 
Important business figures like Farooq 
Kathwari (CEO of Ethan Allen), Malik M. 
Hasan (a pioneer in the field of HMOs), and 
Safi Qureshey (a leader in PC component 
manufacturing) are all American Muslims. 
Many American Muslims are also civically 
engaged, working with their neighbors to bet-
ter their communities. Well-known American 
Muslim leaders include Rep. Keith Ellison 
(DFL–Minn.), the first American Muslim to be 
elected to the U.S. Congress; Rep. ANDRE´ 
CARSON (D–Ind.); Mohammed Hameeduddin 
(Mayor, Teaneck, N.J.); and Amer Ahmad 
(Comptroller, Chicago). 
Nevertheless, levels of Islamophobia are so 
high that the United Nations Human Rights 
Council has declared it an issue of ‘‘epidemic 
proportions.’’ 
Atrocities have been occurring across the 
globe, from hate-messages spray-painted on 
buildings in America to the violent genocide of 
the Uyghurs in China. 
The United States State Department esti-
mated that up to 2 million members of Muslim 
minorities have experienced a system on de-
tention centers in Xinjiang, known political in-
doctrination, forced labor, torture, and sexual 
abuse. 
The US, UK, and Canada have accused 
China of committing genocide and crimes 
against humanity against Muslim populations 
at Xinjiang. 
In 2018, UN investigators accused the 
Myanmar’s military of carrying out mass 
killings of Muslim populations with ‘‘genocidal 
intent.’’ 
There are reports of attacks on mosques in 
India and Iran, a history of anti-Muslim senti-
ments and attacks in Sri Lanka, police tar-
geting against Shia Muslims in Pakistan, mas-
sacres of Muslim people in New Zealand, and 
Islamophobic hate-speech in Canada. 
This global injustice must be addressed and 
rectified and the United States must step up to 
spearhead the movement. 
We need to establish a comprehensive plan 
for combating Islamophobia not only to ensure 
the religious freedom and human rights of 
Muslims, but to protect against a threat to 
international religious freedom and democratic 
principles. 
The Combating International Islamophobia 
Act will require the State Department to create 
a Special Envoy for monitoring and combating 
Islamophobia answering the call of the Amer-
ican Muslim community for the past two dec-
ades. 
The envoy will work with domestic and inter-
national nongovernmental organizations and 
institutions to carry out its directives. 
The special envoy will give reports on acts 
of physical violence or harassment against 
Muslim people as well as acts of vandalism of 
Muslim community institutions like schools, 
mosques, and cemeteries. 
Regarding anti-Muslim government actions, 
the envoy will monitor instances of propa-
ganda in media that attempt to justify or pro-
mote racial hatred or incite acts of violence 
against Muslim people. 
With the new wealth of information this 
envoy will bring, policymakers will have a bet-
ter understanding of the interconnected, global 
problem of anti-Muslim bigotry. 
As part of our commitment to international 
religious freedom and human rights, we must 
recognize Islamophobia as a pattern that is re-
peating in nearly every corner of the globe. 
It is past time for the United States to stand 
firmly in favor of religious freedom for all, and 
to give the global problem of Islamophobia the 
attention and prioritization it deserves. 
Mr. MCCAUL. I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from the 
great State of Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I have a lot 
of emotions as I stand before you 
today. 
This bill is a strong step toward com-
bating Islamophobia, but it is only a 
start. The reality today is that Muslim 
Americans still face constant abuse 
right here at home. While it is great to 
fight Islamophobia abroad, we need to 
be honest with ourselves about how 
widespread this disgusting and bigoted 
anti-Muslim hate is right here in our 
own country. 
Simply put, my two sons and chil-
dren across our country deserve to 
grow up in a country where their reli-
gion, their faith, will not be used as an 
excuse to target them and endanger 
their lives and freedoms. 
Muslims across our country deserve 
Representatives on both sides of the 
aisle who will embrace them and who 
will love them for who they are, not 
those who encourage religious violence 
for their own political gain. 
Mr. Speaker, I would say to my fel-
low Americans who believe in a free, 
inclusive, and accepting country, know 
that we will win this fight. The actions 
of a hateful group of individuals in our 
country and in this body are out of 
touch from the vast majority of our 
Americans and neighbors who are good, 
decent people who reject this violent 
White nationalist hate and will put 
party aside to protect one another 
from this bigotry. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from California (Ms. PELOSI). 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
GREGORY MEEKS, of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, for his leadership in bring-
ing this important legislation to the 
floor which addresses an issue of faith, 
of values, and of our country. 
The House comes together, hopefully, 
in a spirit of unity—I would have 
hoped—and patriotism to condemn and 
combat Islamophobia and all forms of 
racism, prejudice, and discrimination. 
Listening to the debate, I heard Mr. 
DANNY DAVIS earlier as he was singing 
‘‘don’t mess with Mister In-Between’’ 
talking about religion and talking 
about how it should be off-limits and 
people’s religion should be respected. I 
know—and probably it is true of every-
one here—the respect we have for our 
own faith and our own religion enables 
us to appreciate the faith and respect 
people have for their faith. That is why 
this is so sad because it is an attack on 
the faith of one of our Members. 
Sadly, but clearly, Islamophobia is a 
sinister, growing, and for too many 
American Muslims, a constant pres-
ence in our Nation. 
To just review some of the figures: 
Nearly 70 percent of American Muslims 
have personally experienced anti-Mus-
lim discrimination since September 11. 
Thousands of documented acts of 
anti-Muslim bigotry and violence are 
recorded each year, with many thou-
sands unreported. 
Attacks are growing more common 
and more brazen—from vandalism of

mosques, 
to 
physical 
assaults 
on 
women wearing hijabs, to hate speech 
from public officials, to bullying and 
violence of children at schools. Think 
of how the children hear this. 
As we all know, this bigotry has tar-
geted one of our own—shamefully, from 
within this congressional community. 
Racism and bigotry of any form, in-
cluding Islamophobia, must always be 
called out and condemned in any place 
it is found. This is particularly true in 
the Halls of Congress which are the 
very heart of our democracy and where 
we have a responsibility under the 
rules of the House to behave in a way 
that brings dignity to this body. 
Our first President, George Wash-
ington—there he is looking over us— 
over 230 years ago in a letter to the He-
brew Congregation in Newport wrote: 
‘‘For happily the Government of the 
United States, which gives to bigotry 
no sanction, to persecution no assist-
ance, requires only that they who live 
under its protection should demean 
themselves as good citizens, in giving 
it on all occasions their effectual sup-
port.’’ He, himself, was defining what is 
the right way to live. Indeed, bigotry 
and persecution have always been un- 
American as demonstrated by our pa-
triarch, George Washington. 
Anti-Muslim bigotry affects not only 
Members but many other members of 
our congressional community. As hun-
dreds of Muslim staffers wrote in a let-
ter last week, Mr. Speaker, they said 
‘‘hateful rhetoric by public officials di-
rectly impacts us and puts our safety 
at risk, both at the workplace and in 
our everyday lives.’’ 
The Muslim staffers whom we value 
here further said: ‘‘We must now come 
to work every day knowing that the 
same Members and staff who perpet-
uate Islamophobic tropes and insinuate 
that we are terrorists also walk by us 
in the Halls of Congress.’’ 
It is really frightening. 
Disturbingly, Islamophobia is not a 
unique American experience but a 
global scourge. Earlier this year, the 
U.N. Human Rights Council declared 
that discrimination against Muslims 
has risen to epidemic proportions. 
Around the world, we see tragedy and 
tragic consequences of anti-Muslim at-
titudes: 
the 
genocide 
against 
the 
Uyghur people and other Muslim mi-
norities in China, atrocities committed 
against the Rohingya in Burma, at-
tacks on Muslim refugees in central 
Europe and white supremacist violence 
against Muslims in New Zealand and 
Canada, the targeting of Muslim mi-
nority communities in western Asia 
and the Middle East. 
We must confront Islamophobia or 
any form of racism wherever it is 
found—around the world, in our coun-
try, or even in these very Halls. 
This legislation will not only address 
the rise in incidents of Islamophobia 
worldwide but launch a plan to combat 
this bigotry. 
I thank Congresswoman JAN SCHA-
KOWSKY
and 
Congresswoman 
ILHAN 
OMAR for their leadership in advancing 
equity, justice, and dignity in our Con-
gress, in America, and in the world 
with this action. I thank also the For-
eign 
Affairs 
Committee 
chairman, 
GREGORY MEEKS, for his support of this 
important action. 
With this bill’s passage, Mr. Speaker, 
a special envoy for monitoring and 
combating Islamophobia will be cre-
ated, just as the State Department has 
special envoys on anti-Semitism and 
international religious freedom. That 
is something we have always shared in 
this body, across the aisle and across 
the Capitol in a bipartisan way, sup-
port for and respect for religious free-
dom at home and internationally. 
This special envoy created here will 
be charged with establishing a com-
prehensive 
strategy 
to 
combat 
Islamophobia worldwide. The State De-
partment’s annual human rights re-
ports will be expanded to include state 
sponsors of Islamophobic violence and 
impunity. 
As a nation that prides itself on the 
defense of human rights and dignity, 
we must be leaders both on the global 
stage and at home by example to com-
bat violence against Muslims. 
Again, Islamophobia in any place is 
offensive, dangerous, and must be con-
demned; and Islamophobia in our own 
congressional 
community—specifi-
cally, the repeated, ongoing, and tar-
geted Islamophobic comments and ac-
tions against another Member as we 
witnessed this past year—is appalling 
and totally unacceptable. 
That language and behavior are far 
beneath the dignity, integrity, and de-
cency with which the Constitution and 
our constituents require that we act in 
this House. These actions must be 
called out and not tolerated. 
Mr. Speaker, every day that we are 
in session we begin with a prayer be-
cause we believe in our own way. Some 
don’t believe, but by and large, most 
people here believe. We do so with rev-
erence for our own religious beliefs and 
with respect for the beliefs of others. If 
we didn’t have such strong beliefs in 
ourselves and our own religion, it 
would be okay and easy to believe that 
somebody might be frivolous about re-
specting someone else’s devotion. But 
we do. We all profess to be people of 
faith. 
The House will continue to look into 
an array of options to address this pri-
ority and to take real action to combat 
Islamophobia as we have many times 
taken action to condemn anti-Semi-
tism and other forms of bigotry. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman 
again for his leadership and Congress-
woman SCHAKOWSKY, who was very 
much a part of this, and Congress-
woman OMAR; and I urge a strong, bi-
partisan vote on this important legisla-
tion. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, if the 
gentleman from New York is prepared 
to close, I am ready to close. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I am ready 
to close. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Let me just first say that all of us de-
plore anti-Muslim persecution. We are 
seeing a lot of that in Afghanistan 
today, especially the small children. 
We deplore violence on violence, Sunni 
against Shia. No one should ever be at-
tacked or denied their human rights or 
dignity because of their faith. I believe 
both sides of the aisle agree on this, 
and I personally agree with the intent 
and the spirit of this bill. 
The United States Government is 
rightly committed to opposing these 
acts of violence that we have seen di-
rected at Muslims around the world. 
The State Department has an office to 
do so. 
What I do object to, Mr. Speaker, is 
the unfortunate circumstance that the 
bill before us abandons the usual statu-
tory 
language 
about 
violations 
of 
internationally 
recognized 
human 
rights. Instead, it uses this vague term, 
Islamophobia. Look it up on Wikipedia. 
It says it can mean many things. 
This Islamophobia is not defined. It 
is not that we are against the anti- 
Muslim persecution or against inter-
national 
human 
rights 
violations 
against 
Muslims, 
but 
rather 
this 
Islamophobia. 
In connection with that, I would like 
to quote a 2016 article from Columbia 
Law Review that states: ‘‘There is no 
singular, cogent, or consensus defini-
tion of Islamophobia.’’ 
Similarly, the University of Oslo’s 
Center for Research on Extremism 
calls Islamophobia a ‘‘contested term.’’ 
These are law review articles, not 
mine. 
It goes on further to say: ‘‘The term 
conflates opposition to Islam with prej-
udice toward Muslims.’’ 
These expert descriptions underscore 
the need for due diligence that this 
text has not yet received. I wish the 
minority had been given an oppor-
tunity to discuss this bill before it was 
thrown in on the markup, for we all op-
pose religious persecution against Mus-
lims or any other faith. I am a Catho-
lic. Any other believers in any faith 
should be protected from this hate 
speech and violence. 
So for those reasons, because the def-
inition is not provided, Islamophobia is 
a very broad term that can be subject 
to many interpretations. 
If we don’t define that in the Con-
gress through legislative intent, who 
will? 
That means we cede our authority 
over to the executive branch, and then 
they write what Islamophobia means. I 
wish we had used different terms, 
terminologies that are in statute under 
law rather than something that is sort 
of borne on a Wikipedia page. 
b 2030 
To me, that is not the way we legis-
late here. I have done a lot of great leg-
islation with the chairman and the pre-
vious chairman of this committee, and 
I intend to keep doing that with him. I

December 14, 2021 
appreciate our joint efforts to advance 
strong, responsible bipartisan legisla-
tion to protect religious freedom. 
We are going to have one of those 
bills coming up right after this one on 
the Uyghur Muslims, and I appreciate 
that. I know this has been a heated de-
bate, and some things have been said 
today that could be offensive. This is 
not about one Member of Congress. 
This is about our ability to come to-
gether as Americans and come out with 
a strong bipartisan bill that makes 
sense so we can send the message 
around the world that this will not be 
tolerated, just as we are standing up 
for the Uyghur Muslims with the geno-
cide bill and the bill that is going to 
follow this debate here today. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been a rigorous 
debate, and we expected this. I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. MCCAUL for 
his statements. Yes, we work very 
closely together, as well as many Mem-
bers in this House, especially on the 
House 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Committee, 
strong fighters on both sides of the 
aisle for human rights. 
The question that presents itself 
with this plain and simple bill that 
simply calls for us to establish an of-
fice 
to 
monitor 
and 
combat 
Islamophobia at the State Department 
is: Do we all agree? I think I have 
heard my colleagues on the other side 
say that Islamophobia is wrong. That 
means you know that Islamophobia ex-
ists. 
You know it when you see it. You 
know it when you feel it. You know it 
when you talk about the Uyghurs, the 
Rohingyas, or right here in the United 
States of America. There is a definition 
right there. You see it. They have said 
it. We have said it. Islamophobia ex-
ists. 
What we need to do is call it out. 
What we need to do is lock arms and 
stand together. This is an important 
bill. The camera of history is rolling on 
us. It is an important bill, and it is a 
bill of consequence. It should be of con-
sequence to every human being on the 
planet, no matter your religion or no 
matter your race. 
It is important to nearly 2 billion 
Muslims in the world. We need to focus 
on what this bill does. Some of the 
proudest moments of mine—I live in 
and represent one of the most diverse 
districts in all the United States, in 
the most diverse county in the United 
States. I have seen ugliness raise its 
ugly head, whether it is racism, anti- 
Semitism, or Islamophobia. 
But the proud moment is when I see 
Muslims and Jews walking arm-in-arm 
against Islamophobia and against anti- 
Semitism, when I see people of all 
races and nationalities standing to-
gether and not being silent. 
Inaction is unacceptable. We cannot 
stand idly by as atrocity after atrocity 
is inflicted on people of the Muslim 
faith, or any faith, for no reason other 
than bigotry against their religion. 
Freedom of religion is a human right. 
We can and must do better at com-
bating Islamophobia here at home and 
abroad. I wish it was today, but I keep 
dreams and hopes alive that we will 
lock arms—we have good people here— 
and say in unison, as I have seen people 
do in my district, that we are going to 
call out Islamophobia wherever we see 
it, the same with racism and the same 
with anti-Semitism. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill that everybody 
is watching—we travel a lot on our 
committee. We know that people watch 
what is happening on this floor. They 
take it to their gut. I hope that they 
look at this bill and know that we are 
going to call it out and not accept it. 
Silence will not be accepted. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I am proud 
to support this bill that sends a clear signal 
about United States policy with respect to dis-
crimination, especially violent, murderous dis-
crimination against a whole class of people 
because of their ethnicity and/or religion. 
But the significance of this bill is much more 
profound; it moves us forward in terms of our 
self-definition as Americans. 
Our history is pockmarked with violent dis-
crimination against groups that ‘‘got in the 
way.’’ Groups that challenged us to improve 
on the prevailing self-definition at the time. 
From Native Americans who were dehu-
manized, Chinese Americans denied citizen-
ship and naturalization as a group in our immi-
gration laws, African Americans, Hispanic 
Americans, 
Irish-Catholics 
discriminated 
against by Abolitionists. 
The intent of this bill goes to our self-defini-
tion as a nation, something every generation 
must revisit. 
By enshrining this in our State Department 
as a priority policy, that will be propounded 
with other nations, we make ourselves better 
too. We live up to our ideals as a people. 
I hope we rise above the partisan tempta-
tions to score points at the expense of a 
whole class of people, at the expense of peo-
ple all around the world who we have never 
met but count on us to do the right thing on 
their behalf. 
This bill is important for those people who 
can’t find their own voice, because they have 
been denied it, but let’s use ours on their be-
half. It will save lives and it will improve our 
own sense of identity, who we are, what it 
means to be American.

ant to House Resolution 849, the pre-

UYGHUR FORCED LABOR 
PREVENTION ACT 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 6256) to ensure that goods made 
with forced labor in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region of the 
People’s Republic of China do not enter 
the United States market, and for 
other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 6256 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to strengthen the prohibition against 
the importation of goods made with forced 
labor, including by ensuring that the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China 
does not undermine the effective enforce-
ment of section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 
(19 U.S.C. 1307), which prohibits the importa-
tion of all ‘‘goods, wares, articles, and mer-
chandise mined, produced or manufactured 
wholly or in part in any foreign country by 
... forced labor’’; 
(2) to lead the international community in 
ending forced labor practices wherever such 
practices occur through all means available 
to the United States Government, including 
by stopping the importation of any goods 
made with forced labor, including those 
goods mined, produced, or manufactured 
wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region; 
(3) to coordinate with Mexico and Canada 
to effectively implement Article 23.6 of the 
United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to 
prohibit the importation of goods produced 
in whole or in part by forced or compulsory 
labor, including those goods mined, pro-
duced, or manufactured wholly or in part in 
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region; 
(4) to actively work to prevent, publicly 
denounce, and end human trafficking includ-
ing with respect to forced labor, whether 
sponsored by the government of a foreign 
country or not, and to restore the lives of 
those affected by human trafficking, a mod-
ern form of slavery; 
(5) to regard the prevention of atrocities as 
it is in the national interest of the United 
States, including efforts to prevent torture, 
enforced disappearances, severe deprivation 
of liberty, including mass internment, arbi-
trary detention, and widespread and system-
atic use of forced labor, and persecution tar-
geting any identifiable ethnic or religious 
group; and 
(6) to address gross violations of human 
rights in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous 
Region 
(A) through bilateral diplomatic channels 
and multilateral institutions where both the 
United States and the People’s Republic of 
China are members; and 
(B) using all the authorities available to 
the United States Government, including 
visa and financial sanctions, export restric-
tions, and import controls. 
SEC. 2. STRATEGY TO ENFORCE PROHIBITION ON 
IMPORTATION 
OF 
GOODS 
MADE 
THROUGH FORCED LABOR IN THE 
XINJIANG 
UYGHUR 
AUTONOMOUS 
REGION. 
(a) PUBLIC COMMENT.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 30 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force, 
established under section 741 of the United 
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implemen-
tation Act (19 U.S.C. 4681), shall publish in 
the Federal Register a notice soliciting pub-
lic comments on how best to ensure that 
goods mined, produced, or manufactured 
wholly or in part with forced labor in the 
People’s Republic of China, including by 
Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tibetans, and 
members of other persecuted groups in the 
People’s Republic of China, and especially in 
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, 
are not imported into the United States. 
(2) PERIOD
FOR
COMMENT.—The Forced 
Labor Enforcement Task Force shall provide 
the public with not less than 45 days to sub-
mit comments in response to the notice re-
quired by paragraph (1). 
(b) PUBLIC HEARING.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 45 days 
after the close of the period to submit com-
ments under subsection (a)(2), the Forced 
Labor Enforcement Task Force shall conduct 
a public hearing inviting witnesses to testify 
with respect to the use of forced labor in the 
People’s Republic of China and potential 
measures, including the measures described 
in paragraph (2), to prevent the importation 
of goods mined, produced, or manufactured 
wholly or in part with forced labor in the 
People’s Republic of China into the United 
States. 
(2) MEASURES
DESCRIBED.—The measures 
described in this paragraph are— 
(A) measures that can be taken to trace 
the origin of goods, offer greater supply 
chain transparency, and identify third coun-
try supply chain routes for goods mined, pro-
duced, or manufactured wholly or in part 
with forced labor in the People’s Republic of 
China; and 
(B) other measures for ensuring that goods 
mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or 
in part with forced labor do not enter the 
United States. 
(c) DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGY.—After re-
ceiving public comments under subsection 
(a) and holding the hearing required by sub-
section (b), the Forced Labor Enforcement 
Task Force, in consultation with the Sec-
retary of Commerce and the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence, shall develop a strategy 
for supporting enforcement of Section 307 of 
the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307) to pre-
vent the importation into the United States 
of goods mined, produced, or manufactured 
wholly or in part with forced labor in the 
People’s Republic of China. 
(d) ELEMENTS.—The strategy developed 
under subsection (c) shall include the fol-
lowing: 
(1) A comprehensive assessment of the risk 
of importing goods mined, produced, or man-
ufactured wholly or in part with forced labor 
in the People’s Republic of China, including 
from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion or made by Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, 
Tibetans, or members of other persecuted 
groups in any other part of the People’s Re-
public of China, that identifies, to the extent 
feasible— 
(A) threats, including through the poten-
tial involvement in supply chains of entities 
that may use forced labor, that could lead to 
the importation into the United States from 
the People’s Republic of China, including 
through third countries, of goods mined, pro-
duced, or manufactured wholly or in part 
with forced labor; and 
(B) what procedures can be implemented or 
improved to reduce such threats. 
(2) A comprehensive description and eval-
uation— 
(A) of ‘‘pairing assistance’’ and ‘‘poverty 
alleviation’’ or any other government labor 
scheme that includes the forced labor of 
Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tibetans, or 
members of other persecuted groups outside 
of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region 
or similar programs of the People’s Republic 
of China in which work or services are ex-
tracted from Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Ti-
betans, or members of other persecuted 
groups through the threat of penalty or for 
which the Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Tibet-
ans, or members of other persecuted groups 
have not offered themselves voluntarily; and

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 6256. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 6256, the Uyghur Forced 
Labor Prevention Act introduced by 
my good friend, colleague, and chair of 
the Rules Committee, Mr. MCGOVERN. 
Last week, Mr. Speaker, we passed 
Chair MCGOVERN’s original legislation 
on the House floor. I heard my Repub-
lican friends comment that this bill 
was being slow-walked by the House 
Democrats; that we were supposedly 
passing Chairman MCGOVERN’s bill to 
stall and negotiate the Senate bill. 
Even if we did reach agreement, my 
colleagues across the aisle surmised 
that the President would not support 
the compromise package. 
Here we are, less than 6 days later, 
and a compromise between the House 
and the Senate versions has already 
been negotiated. Just a few hours ago, 
unsurprisingly, the Biden administra-
tion announced that it would sign this 
vital piece of legislation. 
The biggest difference between the 
two packages was the House called for 
implementation in 120 days; the Senate 
wanted to wait 270 days. We have nego-
tiated them down to 180 days. The cru-
cial protections of this law will come 
into effect months earlier because of 
House Democrats. 
Let me be clear, this is a good thing 
because it is a bipartisan measure. I 
am glad that such important legisla-
tion will pass with near unanimous 
support from both parties. That is what 
this should be. 
Since 2017, the People’s Republic of 
China has systematically carried out 
mass detention, torture, political in-
doctrination, restrictions on religious 
practices, 
and 
inhumane 
atrocities 
against Uyghurs and members of other 
ethnic and religious minority groups in 
Xinjiang. 
We have seen the People’s Republic 
of China expand its extensive program 
of oppression and transform it into a 
system of state-sponsored forced labor. 
Under the guise of vocational training 
or poverty alleviation, authorities in 
Xinjiang have forced thousands of 
adults and children to work against 
their will and under threat of punish-
ment to produce goods and raw mate-
rials that are then woven into inter-
national supply chains and then to our 
homes. 
This bill, which has passed the House 
before, prohibits the import of goods 
and merchandise from Xinjiang unless 
the importer can prove the products 
did not come from forced labor, im-
poses sanctions on officials facilitating 
the use of forced labor against Chinese 
ethnic minorities, adds important fi-
nancial disclosures for public compa-
nies that do business in the region, and 
also calls for a diplomatic strategy to 
address forced labor in Xinjiang. 
This is a straightforward bill. It sig-
nals that America will not tolerate 
forced labor, and products made from 
forced labor shall not enter the Amer-
ican marketplace. In 2021, for any 
country to utilize forced labor system-
atically and to oppress and exploit its 
population is unconscionable, unac-
ceptable, and, indeed, un-American. We 
cannot and will not stand idly by. 
This legislation is critical to showing 
that we are putting human rights at 
the center of our foreign and economic 
policy. I support this bill, and I look 
forward to continuing to work. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. 
BARR, Mr. MCCAUL, and my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle for coming 
forward and speaking up, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, my good friend from New 
York (Mr. MEEKS), for his leadership in 
helping support this legislation and 
bringing it to the House floor. 
I want to thank the gentleman from 
Massachusetts for his leadership in rec-
ognizing this serious human rights 
travesty that is happening. 
I also want to thank the 11 House 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Committee 
Repub-
licans who are cosponsors of this legis-
lation, including Mr. SMITH of New Jer-
sey. 
I want to thank Senator RUBIO from 
Florida for working with the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts on finding 
a bipartisan and bicameral compromise 
to bring this important legislation to 
the floor. 
b 2045 
Mr. Speaker, it is past time for this 
Chamber and the Congress to act to 
stop the Chinese Communist Party 
from using American consumers to 
subsidize 
its 
brutality.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7807 
December 14, 2021 
contaminating our market is a long-
standing priority of U.S. trade, not just 
because it puts American manufactur-
ers at a disadvantage, but because the 
American values that we all share will 
not tolerate it. 
Truly free trade cannot involve slave 
labor. But today, the CCP is using the 
forced labor of Uyghurs and other mi-
norities to help bankroll its genocide 
against those very same groups. The 
repression taking place right now in 
Xinjiang is breathtaking in its scope 
and in its brutality. More than 1 mil-
lion people have been locked in con-
centration camps and subjected to sur-
veillance and brainwashing on a mas-
sive scale. 
Families are being broken up and 
children are being taken from their 
parents. Forced sterilization and forced 
abortion are being used to limit births 
among ethnic groups targeted by the 
CCP. 
This is outrageous human rights vio-
lations and the world cannot turn a 
blind eye. It is a horrific warning, not 
only to China’s neighbors and to the 
American people, but to the world. The 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party 
is 
fun-
damentally focused on expanding its 
power and its authoritarian style of 
government. It views things that it 
does not control, like religion, cultural 
identity, and the yearning of all people 
for freedom, as threats that must be 
destroyed. 
Because we have drawn the CCP into 
many of our most critical supply 
chains, it has the ability to hold our 
national security hostage while it uses 
U.S. consumers to subsidize its atroc-
ities. This cannot stand. As many as 
one in five cotton garments globally 
are potentially tainted with Uyghur 
slave labor. 
Last year, U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection seized a 13-ton shipment of 
human 
hair 
that 
originated 
in 
Xinjiang’s forced labor system. We 
have a duty to prevent the CCP from 
making Americans complicit in these 
sickening abuses. For that reason, I 
support the bipartisan bill before us 
today, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), the sponsor 
of this bill and chairman of the Rules 
Committee. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank Chairman MEEKS for yielding 
me the time and for his leadership on 
this important issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I am glad that we are 
able to move this compromised Uyghur 
Forced Labor Prevention Act so quick-
ly after the House passed my bill, H.R. 
1155, last week. And I want to thank 
my partner in this effort in the Senate, 
Senator MARCO
RUBIO, for working 
quickly and diligently with us to nego-
tiate this agreement. I wanted to espe-
cially thank Speaker PELOSI for her 
strong moral leadership in getting this 
done. No one in this body—and I mean 
no one—has had a more consistent and 
principled position in standing up for 
the human rights of the people of 
China and Tibet. She has been a crit-
ical part of nearly every single piece of 
China human rights legislation focused 
on China that Congress has passed in 
recent years, and her steadfast com-
mitment to getting this bill across the 
finish line is why we are here today. 
Forced labor is a serious human 
rights abuse. It is illegal under United 
States law to import goods made with 
forced labor. But we are compelled to 
move this legislation by the genocide 
and crimes against humanity being 
committed by the Chinese Government 
against Uyghurs and other Muslim mi-
norities, of which forced labor is a key 
factor. 
We must pass this legislation to give 
Americans the peace of mind that the 
clothes they wear, the food they eat, 
and the technology that they use are 
not tainted by forced labor perpetrated 
by the Chinese Government. 
This bill combines my legislation, 
which passed the House by a vote of 
428–1 last week, and Senator RUBIO’s 
bill, which passed by voice vote, into a 
version that both Chambers can sup-
port. This is a strong, bipartisan, bi-
cameral consensus bill. This bill short-
ens the time the forced labor import 
ban goes into effect to 180 days, from 
the Senate’s 300 days. 
It requires a strong, clear and con-
vincing evidence standard for excep-
tions to the rebuttable presumption. 
It empowers the Forced Labor En-
forcement Task Force to devise and 
oversee the strategy to prohibit the 
import of forced labor goods from 
Xinjiang. 
In short, this is a good bill. It is a 
tougher bill than what passed the Sen-
ate, and I want to thank my House col-
leagues for this report. 
I want to thank Chairman MEEKS 
again. I want to thank Ranking Mem-
ber 
MCCAUL, 
Chairman 
NEAL, 
and 
Chairwoman WATERS for their work. I 
want to thank Congressman CHRIS 
SMITH of New Jersey for all of his sup-
port. 
On the Senate side, I want to thank 
Senators RUBIO and MERKLEY for their 
leadership. And, again, I want to thank 
Speaker PELOSI
for her strong and 
steadfast commitment to getting this 
done. 
So let’s stand up for human rights. 
Let’s 
stand 
against 
genocide 
and 
against crimes against humanity. And 
let’s get the Uyghur Forced Labor Pre-
vention Act to the President’s desk as 
soon as possible. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. SMITH), a Mem-
ber of this body who, for many, many 
years, has been a champion of human 
rights and, frankly, no one has done 
more to advance the cause of human 
rights than my colleague from New 
Jersey. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding and for his leadership, and I 
want to thank the chairman and the 
ranking member for their concerted ef-
forts to get this legislation and like- 
minded legislation moving forward; 
and, of course, JIM MCGOVERN, he is the 
prime sponsor, and I am the prime Re-
publican cosponsor, I want to thank 
him for his leadership on this as well. 
It is so very, very important. 
Mr. Speaker, Mihrigul Tursun said 
she pleaded with God to end her life as 
her Chinese jailers increased the elec-
trical currents coursing through her 
body. 
Mihrigul, a Muslim Uyghur, whose 
escape from Xi Jinping’s genocide led 
her to the United States, actually 
broke down weeping at a November 28, 
2018, congressional hearing co-chaired 
by Senator MARCO RUBIO and I—as co- 
chairs of the Congressional-Executive 
Commission 
on 
China—as 
she 
re-
counted her experience in one of Chi-
na’s infamous concentration camps. 
She testified, and I quote her in part, 
that ‘‘there were around 60 people kept 
in a 430-square-foot cell, so at night, 10 
to 15 women would stand up while the 
rest of us would sleep on our sides.’’ 
She said, ‘‘There were people there who 
had not taken a shower in over a year. 
‘‘I clearly remember the torture 
. . .’’ she said, ‘‘in the tiger chair the 
second time I was incarcerated. I was 
taken to a special room with an elec-
tric chair. It was the interrogation 
room, and it had one light and one 
chair. There were belts and whips 
hanging on the wall. I was placed in a 
high chair that clicked to lock my 
arms and legs in place and tightened 
when they pressed the button.’’ 
She goes on, ‘‘My head was shaved 
beforehand for the maximum impact. 
The authorities put a helmet-like thing 
on my head. Each time I was electro-
cuted,’’ she went on, ‘‘my whole body 
would shake violently, and I could feel 
the pain in my veins. I thought I would 
rather die than go through this torture 
and begged them to kill me. They in-
sulted me with humiliating words and 
pressured me to admit my guilt. 
‘‘The nights were the busiest time in 
the camps,’’ she went on. ‘‘A lot of ac-
tivities such as transferring people be-
tween cells and removing the dead bod-
ies would happen all night long. In the 
silence of the night, we would hear the 
men from the other cells groaning in 
agony. We could hear the beatings, the 
men screaming. . . .’’ 
‘‘While 
burying 
my 
4-month-old 
baby,’’ she had had triplets, ‘‘I was tor-
mented and filled with the guilt of not 
being able to save my son.’’ 
She admonished us, pleaded with us, 
‘‘Please take action against the Chi-
nese officials responsible for my tor-
ture and the death of my little boy and 
the death of so many innocent Uyghurs 
in the camps.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, there are millions and 
millions of stories just like this wait-
ing to be told, truly nightmarish ac-
counts of President Xi Jinping’s geno-
cide. 
In response, I, joined by my friend 
and colleague, TOM SUOZZI, introduced

the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act 
of 2018. 
But this bill, H.R. 1155, the Uyghur 
Forced Labor Prevention Act, which, 
again, I cosponsored with Mr. MCGOV-
ERN, is important and necessary to end 
or at least mitigate our complicity in 
Xi Jinping’s genocide. 
Let’s not forget the documents ob-
tained by The New York Times which 
made clear that this is Xi Jinping’s 
genocide. He ordered it. And early next 
year he will be hosting the Winter 
Olympics. 
The leaked documents show Xi say-
ing things like show ‘‘absolutely no 
mercy’’ in dealing with the Uyghurs 
and other predominantly Muslim mi-
norities. In one speech he said: ‘‘The 
weapons of the people’s democratic dic-
tatorship must be wielded without any 
hesitation or wavering.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, the Uyghur Forced 
Labor Prevention Act prohibits im-
ports from Xinjiang to the U.S. by cre-
ating a rebuttable presumption. That 
is the core of this bill, a presumption 
that all goods produced in the region 
are made with forced labor unless U.S. 
Customs and Border Protection cer-
tifies by clear and convincing evidence 
that goods were not produced with 
forced labor. It is a good bill and de-
serves the support of every Member of 
this body. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor to yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE), a great member of the For-
eign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding and thank 
him for his extraordinary bipartisan 
leadership on this issue and on so many 
issues that come before our committee. 
I want to begin by acknowledging the 
leadership of the Speaker who has been 
an advocate and a strong voice for 
human rights around the world, but 
particularly in China for many, many 
years. 
I rise, Mr. Speaker, in strong support 
of this bicameral version of the Uyghur 
Forced Labor Prevention Act, to en-
sure that the United States does all we 
can to condemn the appalling human 
rights record of the Chinese Govern-
ment against Uyghur Muslims. With 
the 
ongoing 
genocide 
against 
the 
Uyghur population in Xinjiang, and 
with the crackdown on democracy and 
the rule of law in Hong Kong, the world 
has seen what a glimpse of Chinese 
leadership in the international system 
would mean: a rejection of human 
rights; 
a 
commitment 
to 
authoritarianism; a silenced press; and 
the abandonment of the rule of law. 
In Xinjiang, over 1 million members 
of the Uyghur population have been 
forced to live in squalor; forced to 
abandon their beliefs; forced to aban-
don their children; and forced to work. 
Many have been tortured. Many have 
died. All have suffered. 
Policies undertaken in Xinjiang con-
tinue to stir the conscience and rep-
resent this country’s most agonizing 
human rights catastrophes ever. The 
Chinese Government has unleashed a 
series of draconian measures that 
should give anyone in the civilized 
world a pause. They have mandated 
abortions, they have forcibly sterilized 
men and women; they have forcibly 
taken over half a million children from 
their families, and they have sent them 
to so-called reeducation centers. 
They monitor the movements and 
the online activities of millions, ensur-
ing Uyghurs and other minorities are 
robbed of their privacy; and they force 
Uyghurs and other minorities into fac-
tories for no pay and with no recourse. 
We must recognize that the Chinese 
Government built this policy over 
time. 
What 
has 
happened 
to 
the 
Uyghur population is not borne out of 
spontaneous brutality; it has been a 
well-planned endeavor designed to ex-
tinguish a population that China finds 
undesirable. 
This is a systematic policy that de-
nies the Uyghurs their humanity, their 
dignity, and seeks to ultimately deny 
them of their existence. 
We must do all we can to ensure that 
the clarion call of ‘‘never again’’ rever-
berates around the globe. This bill 
would ensure that goods made in the 
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region 
imported into the United States are 
not made with forced labor. 
I want to thank Chairman MCGOVERN 
for his extraordinary leadership and 
urge all of my colleagues to support 
the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention 
Act and again thank the chairman for 
his courtesy. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, in recent years the 
world has stood by as the Chinese Com-
munist Party has detained more than 1 
million ethnic minorities in concentra-
tion camps where they are tortured, 
brainwashed, and put into forced labor. 
This is all part of a deliberate program 
by the CCP to wipe out their ethnic 
identity, their religion, their culture, 
anything that might compete with the 
Communist Party for their loyalties 
and affection. 
We have a moral duty to speak out 
against these horrifying crimes, but we 
have an even greater duty to avoid 
funding this genocide by paying for 
slave labor in Xinjiang. 
Many American companies have built 
their businesses on values that include 
respect for basic human rights. The 
United States must continue to lead 
the world in setting corporate responsi-
bility standards. There can no longer 
be business as usual with China. The 
world is watching. 
While this bill did not go through 
regular order in the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, 
I 
commend 
Chairman 
MCGOVERN and Senator MARCO RUBIO 
for coming to this important bipar-
tisan agreement. 
I appreciate the chairman’s leader-
ship, and it is good to have a bipartisan 
bill where we stand united in one voice 
for human rights, and to hold the Chi-
nese Communist Party accountable. 
I support this bill. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
b 2100 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
H.R. 6256, the Uyghur Forced Labor 
Prevention Act, is an opportunity for 
this body to send a resounding message 
to the world. We are engaged in a stra-
tegic competition with China around 
the world, and our stance on this issue, 
I believe, will define why our system is 
better. We aggressively oppose forced 
labor and Islamophobia, and we will 
back up our values with our actions. 
In this major piece of legislation, we 
are doing it together, Democrats and 
Republicans, working with Ranking 
Member MCCAUL and others, because it 
is the right thing to do. It is the right 
message to send. 
So let us do it; let us get it out; let 
us stand tall; let us be true to our val-
ues. Let not China get away with 
Islamophobia. Let’s make sure we wipe 
out Islamophobia, racism, and anti- 
Semitism from all corners of this place 
that we call the planet Earth. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6256. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

December 14, 2021 
from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), my distin-
guished colleague from the Rules Com-
mittee, pending which I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. During 
consideration of this resolution, all 
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, today, 
the Rules Committee met and reported 
a rule, House Resolution 852, providing 
for consideration of S.J. Res. 33, a joint 
resolution relating to increasing the 
debt limit, under a closed rule. The 
rule provides for 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means, or their 
designees, and provides one motion to 
commit. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my 
colleagues to adopt the rule and sup-
port lifting the Nation’s debt ceiling. 
Failing to lift the debt ceiling and 
defaulting on our debt is not an option. 
If we do not act, a default could result 
in the loss of millions of jobs and $15 
trillion in household wealth, according 
to 
nonpartisan 
Moody’s 
Analytics 
economist Mark Zandi. Mr. Zandi has 
characterized a default as ‘‘financial 
Armageddon,’’ and JPMorgan Chase 
CEO Jamie Dimon has gone even fur-
ther, stating that a default ‘‘could 
cause an immediate, literally cas-
cading catastrophe of unbelievable pro-
portions and damage America for 100 
years.’’ 
Earlier this year, a bipartisan group 
of former Treasury Secretaries wrote 
to Congress arguing that protecting 
U.S. creditworthiness is a ‘‘sacrosanct 
responsibility.’’ I couldn’t agree more. 
Let’s be clear about what we are 
talking about here today. The debt 
limit is the total amount of money 
that the United States Government is 
authorized to borrow to meet its exist-
ing legal obligations, including Social 
Security and Medicare benefits, pay-
ments to veterans and servicemembers, 
and tax refunds. The debt limit does 
not authorize any new spending; it sim-
ply allows the government to pay its 
bills for obligations it has already in-
curred. 
Mr. Speaker, much of this debt was 
accrued on a bipartisan basis. It in-
cludes emergency measures to combat 
the pandemic and increase defense 
spending. While many on the other side 
of the aisle have tried to tie raising the 
debt ceiling to our efforts to pass the 
President’s agenda, it should be noted 
that 97 percent of the total national 
debt accrued before President Biden 
even took office. 
Since 1960, Congress has acted 78 
times to address the debt limit, 49 
times under Republican Presidents and 
29 times under Democratic Presidents. 
In the last 10 years, the debt limit has 
been addressed seven times on a bipar-
tisan 
basis, 
including 
three 
times 
under the last administration, during 
which, I would like to remind my Re-
publican colleagues, $7.8 trillion of the 
total national debt was incurred. 
Arguments about raising the debt 
ceiling have become nonsensical. In the 
current discourse, both sides of the 
aisle have agreed to spend Federal dol-
lars on important programs, but only 
one side of the aisle believes that we 
should actually fulfill our obligations 
to pay our creditors for those very 
same programs. 
Mr. Speaker, if we choose not to 
honor our obligations to creditors, 
what message does that send to the 
American people and, frankly, the rest 
of the world? Everyday Americans pay 
their bills and honor their commit-
ments. Why shouldn’t we do the same? 
Mr. Speaker, it is frankly outrageous 
to hold the position that we shouldn’t 
be held to the same standard as fami-
lies who work hard to find a way to pay 
their bills every day. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
rule and the underlying legislation to 
raise our Nation’s debt ceiling, ensur-
ing that America can continue to pay 
its bills and honor its obligations. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative MORELLE for yielding 
me the customary 30 minutes, and I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for 
consideration of S.J. Res. 33, a bill to 
raise the debt ceiling by $2.5 trillion. 
The Federal debt limit began over 100 
years ago, in 1917, and it has been re-
quired to be raised 100 times since 
then. 
The problem isn’t whether we should 
increase our debt limit; it is that we 
have to issue debt at all. Debts are 
issued to cover the difference between 
what you make and what you spend. 
When you spend more than you make, 
you have to find a way to pay for the 
spending. 
We are in the middle of a spending 
spree. For the last 11 months, well over 
$1 trillion in taxpayer money was spent 
largely on partisan priorities, and more 
likely coming if the Democrats manage 
to get a final agreement on the Build 
Back Better Act or perhaps what more 
aptly might be described as a socialist 
spending scam. 
On December 10, the Congressional 
Budget Office published an estimate of 
the Build Back Better Act, confirming 
the bill’s true cost to be almost $5 tril-
lion, $4.9 trillion, while adding $3 tril-
lion in new debt. 
Democrats claim the bill is paid for, 
but that is simply not true. Now, it is 
confirmed by independent analysis. In-
stead of zero dollars, the bill will cre-
ate a carve-out for deducting State and 
local taxes that will add almost $250 
billion to the deficit. 
b 2110 
It will protect so-called green compa-
nies from a new minimum tax and pro-
vide $12,500 tax credits for purchasing 
an electric vehicle so long as that vehi-
cle is made using union labor. 
The bill will also provide billions in 
benefits to the wealthy through the ex-
panded child tax credit that will add 
over $1.5 trillion to the deficit if this 
policy is made permanent, and that is, 
of course, what is being pushed for in 
the Build Back Better Act. 
Additionally, the $1 trillion infra-
structure bill that the Democrats just 
ushered into law requires a $118 billion 
transfer from Treasury to the highway 
trust fund, which Treasury Secretary 
Janet Yellen has stated will occur to-
morrow, December 15. 
Republicans will not support raising 
the debt limit while Democrats push 
through trillions of dollars for purely 
partisan political spending, thereby de-
pleting our Treasury not just for today 
but for generations to come. 
Unfortunately, all this spending will 
only exacerbate the very high rate of 
inflation, inflation which has been 
crippling so many Americans and caus-
ing so much suffering in the last 11 
months. 
According to the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, in November, the Consumer 
Price Index rose by 0.8 percent, but 6.8 
percent over the last 12 months. The 
most significant increase was in the 
energy sector, while prices went up for 
gas, food, shelter, and vehicles, among 
other things. 
Here is the real bad news: We have 
only seen the tip of the iceberg when it 
comes to inflation. Likely, the infla-
tion rates by March are going to be ab-
solutely astonishing. And that is what 
happens when you push so many dol-
lars out into an economy that has no 
way to absorb them. 
Sure, 2 years ago we all voted for the 
CARES Act, a trillion dollars to rescue 
the country from the coronavirus. And 
then there was additional coronavirus 
relief passed in December. And then al-
most immediately another coronavirus 
bill in February, and then the trans-
portation bill in September, and now 
the Build Back Better Act. 
The economy simply cannot absorb 
those dollars that the Federal Govern-
ment is pushing out. They have got no 
place to go except to create more and 
more inflation. And who does inflation 
hurt? It hurts those people at the lower 
end of the income scale. 
Despite 
repeated 
encouragement 
from the Committee on the Budget 
Ranking Member JASON
SMITH
and 
Senator MCCONNELL, Democrats have 
refused 
to 
raise 
the 
debt 
ceiling 
through reconciliation, which of course 
is their right to do. They have majori-
ties in both the House and the Senate. 
They have had ample time to do this, 
but they simply would not act. So, in-
stead, a temporary extension that 
would only last a couple of months 
happened earlier this year. And now, 
once again, in the middle of the night,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7810 
December 14, 2021 
we are having to vote on a bill to in-
crease the national debt in order to pay 
for Democrats’ social spending and in-
frastructure policies. 
Democrats claim that raising the 
debt limit has always been bipartisan. 
But, you know, here is just a little bit 
of history: In 1993, the Democrats used 
reconciliation to raise the debt limit 
with a party-line vote in the omnibus 
budget reconciliation bill. 
In 2010, the Democrats again raised 
the debt limit by $1.9 trillion with a 
purely party-line vote. Republicans 
voted in opposition out of concern for 
the 
then-Obama 
administration’s 
amount of spending that was occur-
ring. A New York Times article report-
ing on the vote said, ‘‘They wanted to 
raise the ceiling enough to avoid put-
ting their Members through another 
such vote before the midterm elec-
tions.’’ 
Do you kind of get the sense that his-
tory is repeating itself tonight? 
Financial success and financial lon-
gevity begins years before it is real-
ized. We certainly cannot be reckless 
and feckless with the Nation’s future 
now. Under no argument is this plan 
fiscally responsible. Under no fantasy 
is the Build Back Better Act paid for. 
We have to remember to be beneficial 
to the American people, we have to be 
demonstrative of representative gov-
ernment. We should not be raising the 
debt limit to allow for continuation of 
partisan social spending. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
rule, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Those who know me know I am not a 
very sophisticated guy, and they also 
know I am not a financial wizard; but 
I will tell you this: I would love to have 
a 
philosophical 
debate, 
maybe 
sit 
down, have a cup of coffee with the dis-
tinguished gentleman from Texas, and 
we might even find some common 
ground about what our practices ought 
to be relative to spending and taxing 
and all those things. 
But to be clear, none of what Dr. 
BURGESS just talked about has any-
thing to do with what we are doing 
here today. Ninety-seven percent of the 
debt that we have incurred as a Nation 
happened before Joe Biden took office. 
As for Build Back Better, which 
many on our side of the aisle are work-
ing to try to enact, that is something 
that is prospective. We are talking to-
night about paying the bills of things 
that we have already agreed to pay for. 
It has absolutely nothing to do with it. 
I appreciate the distinguished gen-
tleman because he is trying to bring 
into this debate many things which 
have no relevance here, apparently to 
make a better case, but the truth is we 
have a decision before us that is a seri-
ous one. It not only affects the credit-
worthiness of the United States, but it 
affects global markets. This would be, 
as I indicated earlier, catastrophic. 
This is Armageddon if it doesn’t hap-
pen. 
Just to note, in 2016, prior to the 
election of the previous administra-
tion, the national debt was $19.5 tril-
lion or 105 percent of GDP. In 2020, 
when the administration’s time had 
run its course, the debt had risen to 
$27.7 trillion or 129 percent of GDP, a 
$7.8 trillion increase. Included in that 
was a $1.9 trillion tax cut, which hasn’t 
paid for itself, which has added dra-
matically to the debt. But the debt has 
been accumulated during decades of 
real need by the American public. 
So we could have a conversation; 
and, frankly, the discussion about 
spending takes place in the Appropria-
tions Committee, it takes place in the 
Budget 
Committee, 
taxation 
takes 
place in the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. What we are doing now is mak-
ing a decision to pay our bills. Fun-
damentally, bottom line. It doesn’t re-
quire a whole lot of sophistication or 
talk about financial markets. It is 
clearly a simple question, are we going 
to pay for the things that we have 
agreed to buy, and that is it. It is as 
simple as can be. 
Every household in America makes 
those decisions. You get something, 
you get a bill in the mail, you pay for 
it. Even if you have buyer’s remorse, 
even if your wife says to you that fine 
exercise thing that you bought, which 
is going to be the most expensive coat 
hanger in the house because you are 
not going to use it, we still pay for it 
because it is in the house, and we 
bought it. That is as simple as it can 
possibly be. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, Republicans will amend 
the rule to immediately consider an 
amendment to the Democrats’ fiscal 
year 2022 budget resolution to replace 
the socialist $5 trillion tax-and-spend 
reconciliation instructions with new 
instructions for authorizing commit-
tees to produce legislation to reduce 
the deficit to combat runaway infla-
tion currently fueling the highest price 
spike in 40 years and to get Americans 
back to work. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of this amend-
ment into the RECORD, along with ex-
traneous material, immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentleman from Missouri (Mr. SMITH), 
the ranking member of the Budget 
Committee, to explain the amendment. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
if we defeat the previous question, we 
will consider an amendment to the rule 
to replace the socialist $5 trillion tax- 
and-spend reconciliation instructions 
from the fiscal year 2022 budget with a 
new call for committees to draft legis-
lation to reduce the deficit, to combat 
runaway inflation and help get Ameri-
cans back to work. 
This country has been through a lot 
in the past year under one-party rule 
by the Washington Democrats and 
President Biden. 
We have an inflation crisis; we have 
an energy crisis; we have a border cri-
sis; and we have a supply chain crisis. 
Contributing to it all is a leadership 
crisis in the Oval Office. 
With all of these problems, you would 
think Democrats would finish the year 
addressing just one—just one—of those 
issues. 
But instead, Mr. Speaker, we are here 
on the last day of session for the year, 
and Democrats have chosen to spend 
this valuable time attacking former 
President Trump and his staff, attack-
ing members of the Republican Con-
ference, and they have even found room 
to include a $2.5 trillion increase to the 
debt ceiling. 
b 2120 
In fact, since Speaker PELOSI took 
the gavel in the House in 2019, House 
Democrats have added more than $9 
trillion—House Democrats since 2019 
have added more than $9 trillion to the 
national debt, which is more than the 
combined deficits under all 72 years 
that Republicans have ever been in the 
majority. 
The American people, Mr. Speaker, 
they deserve a Congress that is focused 
on the problems that they are facing in 
their everyday lives; a Congress that is 
delivering on policies to stop the run-
away rise in prices, a problem that has 
now reached a 40-year high. 
Even President Biden’s budget in 
May predicted inflation at 2 percent, 
Mr. Speaker. We are now at over 7 per-
cent, the highest inflation in 40 years. 
The White House administration says 
that inflation is a high-class problem, 
Mr. Speaker. I will tell you, the people 
across America believe it is a real 
problem. They care about the prices in 
the grocery store. They don’t care 
about the prices in the stock market. 
But you know what, House Demo-
crats argue and say inflation is transi-
tory, yet now they are finally agreeing 
that these rising costs in prices are ac-
tually having a real impact. 
We could be working on legislation to 
actually help American families by re-
ducing the cost of energy during the 
winter. 
To do that, we need to get rid of the 
reconciliation 
instructions 
in 
the 
Democrats’ budget, the same reconcili-
ation plan that has paralyzed Wash-
ington for months as Democrats fought 
over how to spend $5 trillion. 
Even the Congressional Budget Office 
on Friday confirmed that what passed 
out of this Chamber a few weeks ago 
does not cost zero. It cost $5 trillion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman an additional 2 minutes. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
the official congressional scorekeepers 
said on Friday that the build back 
broke bill that passed out of here a 
couple weeks ago did not cost $1.5 tril-
lion, did not cost $2 trillion, but cost $5

trillion. But this administration will 
say it costs zero. 
The 
American 
people 
see 
right 
through it. They see right through this 
mess. And they know one thing. They 
know that this is nothing but hogwash. 
It is hogwash, Mr. Speaker. And we 
should instead replace all of these rec-
onciliation instructions to bring for-
ward a plan to reduce the deficit and 
stop the inflation that is destroying 
family budgets. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to defeat the 
previous question, so that we can actu-
ally work on legislation to help Amer-
ican families at the supermarket, to 
help combat a price spike that is push-
ing working families to the brink and 
to actually provide some real solutions 
this week on behalf of the American 
people whom we represent in this body. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I appreciate Mr. SMITH’s enthusiasm 
and exuberance. The arguments that 
folks would make that House Demo-
crats are responsible for the spending 
of the Trump administration and the 
Trump White House, that argument is, 
frankly, absurd and happened during a 
global pandemic, so we had much work 
to do to spare the American public. 
But I am going to do this: Moved by 
the spirit of the season, I am going be-
stow a gift on Members, and I am not 
going to rebut point by point but rath-
er reserve the balance of my time and 
allow my colleague to speak. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. FALLON). 
Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, if our 
friends across the aisle are concerned 
about paying our bills and they are 
alarmed by the debt, then I think we 
should all get together, all 435 Mem-
bers, and talk about fiscal responsi-
bility and pass a balanced budget 
amendment. That is the way forward 
and to avert this financial catastrophe 
that we are flirting with. 
Let’s be very candid, Mr. Speaker, 
about what we are doing here. Let’s be 
candid with the American people about 
what we are doing here in this Cham-
ber tonight. 
This is about a debt ceiling limit in-
crease to ram through more wasteful 
and reckless spending. 
We are renovating our house in 
Texas, and I found an old political 
mailer, a 9-year-old mailer; and I was 
outraged about the fact that we had a 
$14 trillion debt. Today that is $29 tril-
lion. 
It is not about placing blame on Re-
publicans or Democrats, it is about rec-
ognizing we have an issue that is going 
to destroy this country if we don’t ad-
dress it. And we continue to kick the 
can down the road and land that can on 
the backs of future generations like my 
15-year-old son and my 12-year-old son. 
There are failed states in this world. 
Here is a $100 trillion bill from the Na-
tion of Zimbabwe. It is worth maybe 40 
cents. It is essentially worthless. That 
could be what we end up with if we 
don’t recognize the fact that at the 
local level cities can’t spend more than 
they take in, counties can’t, even 
States can’t. So why does the Federal 
Government get to? Because we own a 
printing press down the street? 
Let’s be responsible. Let’s work to-
gether. This Chamber 20-plus years ago 
passed a balanced budget amendment, 
if I am not mistaken, and it failed in 
the Senate. It is time to do the right 
thing, the courageous thing, the Amer-
ican thing, and pass a balanced budget 
amendment. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I wonder, when the gentleman fin-
ished his home’s renovations if he paid 
the contractor or refused to pay be-
cause he might be tempted to do ren-
ovations in the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, just before I close, I do 
want to take a moment and acknowl-
edge that it was 1 year ago last night 
that the FedEx trucks departed from 
Kalamazoo, Michigan, carrying the 
very first doses of what we now know 
as the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. 
And when you stop and reflect upon 
what was accomplished between the 
middle of May and the middle of De-
cember of 2020, it truly was a startling 
scientific accomplishment; not one, 
not two, but three vaccines. 
We told ourselves at the beginning of 
the Operation Warp Speed process that 
if we got 40 to 45 percent effectiveness, 
it would be a victory, and those vac-
cines delivered in excess of 90 percent. 
People might quibble and say, well, 
you have to get a booster or you have 
to get an additional shot. We are so 
fortunate to have those tools to be able 
to combat this illness. 
We are by no means through, but 
then even just last week the additional 
news that now an oral medication, the 
so-called Tamiflu for coronavirus, is 
now available, which I submit is going 
to change with the application of addi-
tional therapeutics, is really going to 
change the equation, and I just wanted 
to take a minute and reflect on that. 
We are, again, just one day past the 
1-year 
anniversary 
of 
Kalamazoo, 
Michigan, delivering that vaccine to 
the world. 
Otherwise in closing to this argu-
ment, raising the debt ceiling to $2.5 
trillion does seem a tad irresponsible 
in the middle of unprecedented spend-
ing by House Democrats. You have got 
control of the White House, you have 
got control of the Senate, you have got 
control of the House, and you haven’t 
passed a single appropriations bill. 
How are we supposed to run our busi-
ness if we will not do our normal work 
and pass a budget and pass the 12 ap-
propriations bills? 
b 2130 
The Federal Government is currently 
operating under the second continuing 
resolution of this fiscal year. One-third 
of Federal spending is done through 
discretionary 
appropriations. 
When 
you stop to think about it, that is real-
ly not much. That means two-thirds 
comes through on autopilot. But the 
amount that we actually tell ourselves 
we are going to control, the one-third 
of the Federal budget, we haven’t done 
our work. 
Now, we are talking about raising 
the debt limit to pay for trillions of 
dollars in spending, and the Democrats 
won’t even fund the basic functions of 
government through regular appropria-
tions. That actually comes at a cost. It 
is very difficult to get a phone call an-
swered by a Federal agency, by the 
head of a Federal agency, by a Cabinet 
Secretary because we no longer make 
the appropriations. 
These folks are relatively new on the 
job, within the last year. They have no 
history of knowing that they have to 
come to Congress to get their appro-
priations bills passed. So as a con-
sequence, they basically ignore the 
Congress. 
Democrats are desperate to push 
through as much social spending as 
they can because the balance of power, 
quite 
likely, 
is 
getting 
ready 
to 
change. Why else would they be so 
reckless in such a short amount of 
time with Americans’ hard-earned tax-
payer dollars? We cannot push infla-
tion higher by raising the debt limit to 
allow for trillions in additional par-
tisan spending. 
Mr. Speaker, here is the real problem 
that is going to lead to that balance of 
power shift. It is inflation that is at 
levels that have not been seen since the 
Carter administration. 
Again, my prediction is, over the 
next 6 months, this is going to become 
a 
great 
deal 
worse. 
It 
will 
be 
unsustainable for most American fami-
lies who live paycheck to paycheck. 
Then on top of that, it is a spending 
level that is driving that inflation 
level. And we are doing nothing, noth-
ing to put the brakes on that. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on the previous question so we can 
get to the talk for fiscal sanity and 
‘‘no’’ on the underlying measure, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
First, let me echo Dr. BURGESS’ com-
ments about the vaccine. I want to en-
courage every American to get that 
vaccine. We still have far too many 
people who have chosen not to get the 
vaccine and the third dose, for those 
who are eligible, under the messenger 
RNA, to do a third shot. But we en-
courage every single American to do it, 
and I want to make sure to repeat that. 
I join with my colleague in thanking 
those who made that possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank all of my 
colleagues for their work in support of 
the rule before us today. As I men-
tioned earlier, protecting U.S. credit-
worthiness is a sacred responsibility, 
and it would be an abdication of that

sacred responsibility to fail to address 
the debt limit and ensure that the 
United States Government pays its 
bills. 
We have heard a lot of rhetoric 
today, but we all know that the meas-
ure before us today is not about new 
spending. No matter how many times 
it is said, it is not about new spending. 
We are acting today to ensure that 
America can pay its obligations that 
we have already agreed to incur. Pre-
tending otherwise is a disservice to the 
American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. BURGESS is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 852 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 2. The provisions of Senate Concur-
rent Resolution 14 shall continue to have 
force and effect for all purposes in the House, 
except with the following revisions: 
(1) In title II— 
(A) strike ‘‘increase’’ in each place it ap-
pears and insert ‘‘decrease’’; 
(B) strike ‘‘by not more than’’ in each 
place it appears and insert ‘‘by at least’’; 
(C) strike each dollar amount and insert 
‘‘$,100,000,000’’; and 
(D) strike ‘‘September 15, 2021,’’ in each 
place it appears and insert ‘‘December 31, 
2021,’’. 
(2) By adding at the end the following: 
TITLE V—POLICY STATEMENT ON 
INFLATION AND RECONCILIATION 
SEC. 501. POLICY STATEMENT ON INFLATION 
AND RECONCILIATION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The House finds the fol-
lowing as it relates to the inflationary im-
pact of the policies of the Democrat-con-
trolled Congress and Biden Administration: 
(1) President Biden’s Fiscal Year 2022 budg-
et request assumed inflation, under the Ad-
ministration’s policies, would amount to two 
percent in 2021, 2022, and over the next dec-
ade. 
(2) Actual inflation under the Administra-
tion’s policies has totaled more than three 
times these estimates. 
(3) Since Joe Biden took office, inflation 
has increased at an annualized rate of more 
than seven percent, the highest level in 40 
years. 
(A) Gasoline prices have increased by 58 
percent on an annualized basis. 
(B) Household energy prices have increased 
by 13 percent on an annualized basis. 
(C) Meat prices have increased by 14 per-
cent on an annualized basis. 
(D) According to the Congressional Budget 
Office, ‘Inflation has eroded the purchasing 
power of families’. 
(4) There is a clear link between the Demo-
crats’ reckless out-of-control deficit spend-
ing and the inflation crisis Americans cur-
rently face. After one year of Democrat con-
trol, House Democrats have passed $7.5 tril-
lion in new spending—more than the Federal 
Government has ever spent in any year in 
American history—$3 trillion of which has 
been enacted. This amounts to nearly $60,000 
per American household. This includes Pub-
lic Law 117–2, Public Law 117–58, and as con-
firmed by the Congressional Budget Office, 
the $5 trillion reckless reconciliation spend-
ing plan—the largest spending bill in United 
States history, and the direct product of the 
prior reconciliation instructions previously 
enacted. 
(b) POLICY ON HALTING OUT-OF-CONTROL DE-
FICIENT SPENDING
AND PROMOTING POLICIES 
TO ADDRESS THE INFLATION CRISIS.—It is the 
policy of this concurrent resolution to adopt 
reconciliation instructions that instruct au-
thorizing committees to produce legislation 
to: 
(1) Cut Washington spending to reduce the 
deficit and combat governmental fueled in-
flation. 
(2) Address the crisis of rising prices cur-
rently facing American families by providing 
solutions to bring down the cost of goods and 
get more Americans back to work. 
SEC 3. H.R. 5376 is laid on the table. 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 220, nays 
212, not voting 1, as follows:

MOMENT OF SILENCE IN REMEM-
BRANCE 
OF 
THE 
VICTIMS 
OF 
THE RECENT OUTBREAK OF TOR-
NADOES IN KENTUCKY AND IN 
THE MIDWEST 
(Mr. ROGERS OF Kentucky asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. COMER. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. I yield to 
the gentleman from Kentucky, my 
close friend, whose district was the 
hardest hit and whose constituents 
along with all those impacted are in 
our prayers. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, on be-
half of all the citizens of west Ken-
tucky, I thank everyone in America for 
the outpouring of support, the prayers, 
the financial support, the people who 
took off and traveled to west Kentucky 
to help remove debris and save people 
who were trapped under roofs and 
buildings that had collapsed. 
The devastation there is unlike any-
thing I have ever seen. And in talking 
to the media that is all in Mayfield, 
Kentucky, right now as we speak, it is 
the worst damage they have ever seen 
from a tornado. 
But the people in west Kentucky are 
resilient. They have so much pride in 
their 
communities. 
Neighbor 
has 
helped neighbor, and that will con-
tinue. 
I ask, Madam Speaker, for a moment 
of silence on the House floor to remem-
ber the 74 citizens of Kentucky who 
perished in the terrible series of torna-
does that swept through our State this 
weekend. 
The SPEAKER. The Chair asks all 
Members in the Chamber, as well as 
Members and staff throughout the Cap-
itol, to rise for a moment of silence in 
remembrance of the victims of the re-
cent outbreak of tornadoes in Ken-
tucky and throughout the Midwest.

on which the yeas and nays were or-
dered. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-

JOINT RESOLUTION RELATING TO 
INCREASING THE DEBT LIMIT 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, pursu-
ant to House Resolution 852, I call up 
the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 33) joint 
resolution relating to increasing the 
debt limit, and ask for its immediate 
consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the joint 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 852, the joint 
resolution is considered read. 
The text of the joint resolution is as 
follows: 
S.J. RES. 33 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, The the limiation under 
section 3101(b) of title 31, United States 
Code, as most recently increased by Public 
Law 117–50 (31 U.S.C. 3101 note), is increased 
by $2,500,000,000,000. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
joint resolution shall be debatable for 1 
hour equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Ways and 
Means or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
BEYER) and the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BRADY) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on Senate 
Joint Resolution 33. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased that 
today the House will take action to 
protect our Nation’s full faith and 
credit. S.J. Res. 33 will ensure that the 
United States continues to be a nation 
that pays its bills, period. 
Without today’s action, for the first 
time in our history, the United States 
Government could default on its debt 
obligations because of the debt limit, 
and this would be ruinous for U.S. 
workers and their families. 
It would trigger a financial crisis on 
par with that of 2008, resulting in cata-
strophic economic damage with mil-
lions of jobs lost, businesses shuttered, 
and a banking system in chaos. 
At a time when our recovery is 
strong but uncertain, we risk the loss 
of six million jobs, an unemployment 
rate of nearly 9 percent, the elimi-
nation of $15 trillion in household 
wealth, and a decline in real GDP of 4 
percent. 
Nonpartisan Moody’s Analytics econ-
omist Mark Zandi predicted that fol-
lowing a default, a global market panic 
on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis 
would ensue. 
J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon 
predicted that such a default could 
‘‘cause an immediate, literally cas-
cading catastrophe of unbelievable pro-
portions and damage America for 100 
years.’’ 
If the United States were to default, 
it would likely prompt a lasting down-
grade of the country’s credit that 
would drastically increase costs for 
mortgages, car loans, student loans, 
credit card bills, and other borrowing. 
This would threaten the livelihoods of 
the very people we are here to rep-
resent. 
I want to be very clear. Raising the 
debt ceiling is not about incurring new 
debts. We are simply ensuring the Fed-
eral Government keeps its existing 
commitments, that it pays the bills we 
have already racked up. 
By raising the debt limit, we are 
meeting our existing obligations to 
members of the military, veterans, and 
recipients of Medicare, Medicaid, and 
Social Security. 
In fact, 97 percent of the debts cur-
rently necessitating an increase were 
accrued prior to the Biden administra-
tion, many of which were passed with 
bipartisan support. This includes emer-
gency pandemic relief measures, in-
creased defense spending, and contin-
ued government operations. 
Madam Speaker, the time to act is 
now. Treasury Secretary Yellen has 
issued a dire warning: Without congres-
sional action by tomorrow, the govern-
ment will be left with insufficient 
funds to finance government oper-
ations. 
Over 50 million seniors could stop re-
ceiving Social Security checks for a 
time. Troops would go unpaid. Millions 
of families who rely on the monthly 
child tax credit could see delays. Our 
current economic recovery would re-
verse into recession, with billions of 
dollars of growth and millions of jobs 
lost. 
As the 2011 debt ceiling crisis shows, 
even narrowly avoiding a default costs

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7817 
December 14, 2021 
the country billions of dollars. While 
raising the debt ceiling does not, on its 
own, create new debts for the United 
States Government, a failure to do so 
certainly would. 
Congress has addressed the debt limit 
79 times since 1960 to prevent default; 
30 times with a Democrat in the White 
House, 49 times under a Republican 
President. In fact, under President 
Trump, Congress took action to ad-
dress the debt limit three times and did 
so 
without 
drama. 
Today’s 
action 
should be no different. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
measure to lift the debt ceiling, con-
tinue paying our bills, and ensure our 
continued economic recovery. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
In 2018, Democrat Leader NANCY 
PELOSI, Leader HOYER, Whip CLYBURN, 
and 116 other House Democrats voted 
to default on the debt, shut down the 
government, and refuse disaster relief 
to 
devastated 
communities 
across 
America like mine. 
One even said, Republicans control 
the House, the Senate, and the White 
House; responsibility to govern rests 
squarely on their shoulders. 
Well, right now the Democrats con-
trol the House, the Senate, and the 
White 
House. 
Responsibility 
rests 
squarely on their shoulders. 
Make no mistake, Democrats have 
known this day has been coming for 2 
years and did absolutely nothing. They 
passed no budget, passed no appropria-
tions bills, and they didn’t spend a mo-
ment in bipartisan outreach to address 
the debt ceiling. 
I agree, Congress should not play po-
litical games with the debt ceiling, but 
neither should it ignore the future fi-
nancial crisis at risk of accelerating if 
President 
Biden 
and 
congressional 
Democrats pass their nearly $5 trillion 
socialist welfare plan. 
Despite its desperate bid to shift 
blame for this debt ceiling crisis Demo-
crats themselves created, increasing 
America’s national debt is necessary to 
make room in the so-called Build Back 
Better bill for trillions of wasteful 
spending and special interest handouts 
for the wealthy and big business. 
Make no mistake, the debt ceiling is 
not merely about paying for past 
spending, it is about making room for 
new wasteful spending, trillions that 
will pour more fuel on the inflation fire 
that marks Joe Biden’s Presidency, the 
highest rate in decades, that has 
robbed families of their real wage gains 
from the past 3 years. 
Although the President and Demo-
crats in Congress continue to deny that 
inflation is real, this is now a crisis for 
families, and especially seniors on 
fixed incomes. Their claims that this 
costs zero has been debunked by the 
independent Congressional Budget Of-
fice and multiple organizations, and 
fact-checked as false and misleading by 
The Washington Post. 
And Democrats’ insistence that fu-
ture permanence will be paid for begs 
the question they refuse to answer. 
How? Everyone knows there are only 
two ways to raise trillions of dollars 
more: Tax middle-class families or rob 
from entitlement programs like Social 
Security, Medicare, Medicaid. 
The truth is, the Democrats need this 
debt ceiling to fund special interests, 
give tax subsidies for luxury electric 
vehicles, and tax windfalls to million-
aires, while the middle class gets noth-
ing, or even a tax hike. 
b 2340 
They need this debt ceiling to give 
tax breaks to trial lawyers, local media 
corporations, and pay 1.5 million work-
ers more to stay home than go back to 
work. 
Democrats need a quarter of a tril-
lion dollars to lift the SALT cap so 
that two out of three millionaires will 
get a huge tax break. 
Meanwhile, for working families, in-
flation grows worse. Main Street busi-
nesses continue to struggle hard to find 
workers, and many parents will pay 
over $1,000 a month more for childcare 
under Build Back Better. 
These are President Biden’s prior-
ities. Congressional Democrats, these 
are their priorities. The question to 
America is, are these your priorities? 
The answer is no, which is why so 
many Americans overwhelmingly ques-
tion the competence of President Biden 
and Democrats to lead this country. 
I urge a strong ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, it 
is not 
compassionate to bankrupt 
America. That is exactly what this 
plan does. It equips this country with 
more debt to pay for the past debt with 
no plan to pay for the future debt. The 
only thing is more debt. It is a debt 
bomb, and it is something that this 
body has an obligation to stop. 
This country is on auto pilot for a 
crash site, and the only plan is to keep 
riding on auto pilot right into the 
crash site. The whole point of the debt 
ceiling is to force this body to do its 
duty and to come up with a plan to not 
default. 
The only question isn’t whether we 
default tomorrow, which we shouldn’t, 
of course we should pay our debts, but 
we shouldn’t default in the future ei-
ther. And unless we come up with a dif-
ferent course of action, this is going to 
ride all the way to the crash site. 
I will oppose this, and I encourage all 
of my colleagues to do the same, and 
we should continue to oppose it until 
there is a plan to avert the crisis in the 
crash that is coming. 
Don’t bankrupt America. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. PALMER). 
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Texas for 
his leadership. A lot has been said 
about the Congressional Budget Office 
scoring the Build Back Better bill, that 
it increases the deficit by $3 trillion, 
putting truth to the lie that the bill is 
paid for. It is not. 
What the American people need to 
know is that there is another CBO re-
port that was released earlier this fall 
that should be front and center of this 
debate over raising the debt limit. 
Here is what that report says about 
the direction America is heading. Ac-
cording to the CBO, by 2051, America’s 
debt-to-GDP ratio will be over 200 per-
cent. In other words, our debt will be 
twice the size of our entire economy. 
That CBO report said a growing debt 
burden would increase the risk of a fis-
cal crisis and higher inflation, as well 
as undermine confidence in the U.S. 
dollar, making it more costly to fi-
nance public and private activity in 
international markets. 
The CBO reported that, with growing 
debt and rising interest rates, net 
spending for interest more than triples 
relative to the size of the economy. 
A New York Times article reported 
that the CBO warned that such high 
debt levels will lift borrowing costs, 
slow economic output, and raise the 
risk of a fiscal crisis. 
The Committee for a Responsible 
Budget warned that the Nation’s long- 
term output was an air raid siren that 
can be heard for miles. It said the 
mounting debt will make it harder to 
address income inequality and to make 
needed infrastructure improvements. 
Apparently, my Democratic colleagues 
are deaf to that siren. 
Now my colleagues want to raise the 
debt limit by another $2.5 trillion so 
they can continue down the path of 
reckless spending with no regard for 
the consequences for our Nation’s fu-
ture. That is the wrong path. That is 
the dangerous path. And that is why 
every Member should heed the warn-
ings and vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding me 
the time, and more importantly, for 
bringing this important legislation to 
the floor. Now we say that with many 
bills, and let me tell you, Madam 
Speaker, what this means to America’s 
families. 
America’s families, as they gather 
around the kitchen table and figure out 
their priorities and how they are going 
to pay their bills is what keeps them 
up at night. 
We must lift the debt ceiling to cover 
the expenses already incurred. It is im-
portant to note over 95 percent of it oc-
curred during the Trump administra-
tion, under 4 percent of it during the 
Biden administration. 
But sadly, Republicans have not only 
abandoned the responsibility they have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

December 14, 2021 
in all of this, this is what it means to 
you. 
For families, a default could mean 
millions of American jobs eliminated, 
trillions in household wealth erased, 
reducing the value of the dollar and an 
immediate reversal of our strong eco-
nomic recovery—six million jobs al-
ready under Joe Biden—and having a 
terrible impact globally for decades to 
come. 
Just the discussion of not lifting the 
debt ceiling a number of years ago 
when the Republicans in Congress were 
refusing to do so lowered the credit 
rating of the United States of America. 
Our Constitution says and it makes 
clear the validity of the public debt of 
the United States authorized by law 
shall not be questioned. 
I point out this other fact. If you 
have a car loan, if you have a mort-
gage, if you have a student loan, if you 
have credit card bills, any other bor-
rowing, your interest rates will go up 
unless we lift the debt ceiling. So this 
has a direct impact on the pockets of 
the American people on the prospects 
for their success. 
Let’s be clear, Republicans want less 
money in the pockets of the American 
people for whatever reason. I don’t 
know what the middle class and work-
ing families ever did to them for them 
to want to exact this toll on our econ-
omy, on our standing in the world and 
what it means globally, but very im-
portantly when you are discussing your 
finances over the kitchen table, under-
stand that if your interest rates go up 
it is because the refusal of the Repub-
licans to lift the debt ceiling. 
I close by saying the full faith and 
credit of the United States should 
never be questioned. The health of our 
economy should never be threatened. 
The financial security of our families 
must never be gambled. 
I urge a strong ‘‘yes’’ vote for this 
legislation so that we strengthen our 
economic recovery, spare families the 
pain of a catastrophic default and up-
hold our duty in the Constitution of 
the United States to uphold the full 
faith and credit of the United States of 
America. 
Madam Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ 
vote, and I thank Mr. BEYER for his 
leadership on this issue and Mr. RICHIE 
NEAL, the chair of the committee, as 
well. 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, sort of a gentle re-
minder, 2018 Democratic leader NANCY 
PELOSI, Leader HOYER, Whip CLYBURN, 
and 116 other Democrats voted to de-
fault on America’s debt to shut down 
our government at the same time and 
refused disaster relief to devastated 
communities across America, including 
in Texas. And as they said, Republicans 
controlled the House, the Senate, and 
the White House, and the responsibility 
to govern rests squarely on their shoul-
ders. 
And another gentle reminder to the 
American 
public, 
our 
Democratic 
friends have known this day has been 
coming for 2 years. This is a crisis that 
they created. Didn’t bother to pass a 
budget, didn’t do their appropriations 
bill, no bipartisan outreach. Waited 
again and again for this cliff and cre-
ated this crisis. It has been frustrating 
to watch this go on. 
And, too, I know middle-class Ameri-
cans, one out of every three, will see a 
tax hike in the Build Back Better bill, 
but two out of three millionaires get a 
huge tax cut. A quarter of a trillion 
dollars of this debt ceiling, a quarter of 
a trillion dollars of this increase will 
go to millionaires and billionaires and 
other wealthy Americans. 
b 2350 
Not to mention the heat your home 
tax on middle-class families, the tod-
dler tax on middle-class families, the 
made in America tax on our Main 
Street businesses. What is now clear is 
that President Biden is a pay-cut 
President. Even as most Americans 
work hard to get ahead in their careers 
and their workplaces, they are now 
falling behind every month of this 
Presidency. 
They have lost 3 years’ worth of real 
wage growth, went backward in getting 
ahead. And just since spring, Ameri-
cans are losing an average of $377 a 
month in real purchasing power. 
Who is the party for the middle class 
and working families? Not Democrats, 
who are robbing—inflation—from their 
paychecks. Adding another $5 trillion 
to the inflation fire will only cause 
prices to continue to grow faster than 
paychecks. 
The middle class is on the hook for 
Democrats’ handouts to the highest 
earners, including their government 
checks to the top 1 percent and the big-
gest corporations, lavish subsidies for 
luxury electric vehicles, and tax cuts 
for the wealthiest. 
Over half of families with two kids 
who pay for childcare will be forced to 
pay a $27,000 toddler tax each year 
under 
the 
Democrats’ 
Washington 
takeover of childcare. All this hurts 
American workers and their families, 
the poor, and the seniors. 
We ought to stop this economic 
strain. We ought to stop this economic 
suppression. We ought to stop this at-
tack on middle-class and working fami-
lies. We ought to make progrowth tax 
reform permanent. It lifted millions of 
Americans out of poverty, brought jobs 
back from overseas, and, for the first 
time, started to shrink income inequal-
ity. 
Madam Speaker, you may remember, 
in 2019, families in America, their 
household income grew more in 1 year 
under President Trump and the Repub-
licans than in all 8 years of President 
Obama and Biden combined. 
We believe there is a smarter way to 
help American working families, but I 
know this: Democrats are wrong to 
fight for $5 trillion of social spending 
that will send jobs overseas, limit 
choice in childcare, worsen healthcare, 
and lower paychecks by flaming infla-
tion longer and making the worker 
shortage worse. 
Madam Speaker, we can’t afford this 
pay-cut Presidency. I once again urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this 
measure, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, very briefly, it 
seems my Republican friends would 
like to make this debate about the bi-
partisan infrastructure bill and about 
the Build Back Better bill despite the 
fact that these were wildly popular 
with the American people. Listening to 
my Republican friends, it sounds like 
we are in a desperate country instead 
of one that has created 6 million jobs 
so far this year, an all-time record that 
has 6 percent GDP growth expected 
this year. Our unemployment rate is 
4.2 percent. It has recovered faster than 
any time in American history. 
We are about to fund daycare for 
American working families, bring 3- 
and 4-year-olds to school. The child tax 
credit will be extended. 
Our infrastructure bills are going to 
build more roads and highways, elec-
tric grid, broadband, fix the lead pipes. 
All this is in two bills that are paid 
for—that are paid for—every penny. 
When people suggest that the benefits 
may be extended, we have also prom-
ised to pay for them if that, in fact, 
happens. 
You complain that we haven’t done 
the appropriations bill. This House did 
the appropriations bill. But in the Sen-
ate, which requires 60 votes, the appro-
priations bill didn’t happen over there. 
Madam Speaker, this is not about 
two very good bills, two paid-for bills 
that don’t increase the deficit, that 
don’t add to inflation. It is about the 
simple fact that we need to pay our 
bills. 
It is a simple bill. This vote should be 
simple. 
During the Trump administration, 
the Republicans added $7.9 trillion—50 
percent—to the national debt. Their 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act alone added $1.9 
trillion. We have to pay for that. That 
is what we are paying for tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues, Democrat and Republican, to 
vote for this good Senate joint resolu-
tion to lift the debt ceiling. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to oppose this $2.5 trillion debt limit in-
crease which this Congress is voting on with-
out any discussion of how this debate will ever 
be repaid. 
Over the past year, Congress’ record levels 
of spending has sparked record-breaking infla-
tion. Just last week, our nation hit its highest 
inflation rate in 40 years with current annual 
inflation for the twelve months ending in No-
vember at 6.8%. As a consequence, real aver-
age hourly earnings decreased by half a per-
cent in November. Surging costs for food, en-
ergy, housing, and other items have left the 
average American family reeling. In my Cali-
fornia district, the average price of a tank of

gasoline has increased over $20 since Janu-
ary, while the price of natural gas is up more 
than 25 percent. 
Congress is not only spending at a level 
that is well beyond our self-imposed limits, but 
also beyond what our economy can safely 
handle, and Madam Speaker, instead of re-
ducing our spending and finding places to 
save as any American family would, this insti-
tution is working to push through another 
multi-trillion-dollar social spending package 
that would drive our debt and our inflation fur-
ther into crisis. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
this 
unconscionable 
spending is the epitome of irresponsible gov-
ernance. We must take measures to end this 
reckless spending and put our financial house 
in order. To that end I have introduced two 
bills that the House might better spend its time 
considering in the coming weeks instead of 
continuing debate on the reckless social 
spending bill. 
My Constitutional Amendment to balance 
the budget would amend the U.S. Constitution 
to ensure total federal spending for a fiscal 
year does not exceed the total amount of fed-
eral revenue. It includes off-ramps that en-
courage bipartisanship in times of crisis and 
would end the seemingly-endless cycle of 
budget deficits. 
Likewise, my Finding Federal Savings Com-
mittee Resolution would help to cut back on 
government waste by creating a bipartisan 
committee in this body to identify underper-
forming and nonessential federal programs 
and recommend their elimination or modifica-
tion. Neither of these ideas are partisan, nor 
are they radical. They simply take steps to 
solve a problem that this body has continued 
to kick down the road for future generations to 
repay. 
Madam Speaker, this Congress must do 
better. I call on my colleagues to reverse 
course, to stop this reckless spending, and to 
vote no on raising the debt ceiling without a 
plan to repay our debt. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary, on Homeland Security, and on the 
Budget, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 33—Joint 
resolution relating to increasing the debt limit, 
a measure raising the national debt limit by 
$2.5 trillion, which is imperative to avoid a 
wasteful, irresponsible, reckless threatening of 
the nation’s singular indispensable asset: the 
full faith and credit of the United States. 
Madam Speaker, preserving the full faith 
and credit of the United States by raising to 
the debt limit to ensure that America pays the 
bills for past expenditures when they come 
due is not a partisan exercise but an act of 
patriotism, a recognition and embrace of the 
solemn obligation to preserve the unrivaled 
advantages that flow from the ability provided 
in the Article I, Section 8, clause 2 of the Con-
stitution to ‘‘borrow money on the credit of the 
United States.’’ 
Long ago, in 1789, Alexander Hamilton, the 
nation’s first and greatest Treasury Secretary, 
understood that the path to American pros-
perity and greatness lay in its creditworthiness 
which provided the affordable access to cap-
ital needed to fund internal improvements and 
economic growth. 
It is because of the existence and wise use 
of the Borrowing Power that the nation was 
able to expand its reaches, resources, and 
riches by financing the Louisiana Purchase, 
the purchase of Alaska from Russia, to fund 
the investments to end the Great Depression, 
to finance the mobilization of resources need-
ed in World War II to defeat fascism and save 
freedom in the nation and the world, to revive 
the economy after the catastrophic Great Re-
cession of 2008, and most recently, to protect 
the public health and safety and restore the 
economy during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
This is why the ability to borrow money on 
the credit of the United States to finance its 
growth and protect its people and interests is 
essential to the national security and led Ham-
ilton to proclaim that ‘‘the proper funding of the 
present debt, will render it a national bless-
ing.’’ 
But to maintain this blessing, or to ‘‘render 
public credit immortal,’’ Hamilton understood 
that it was necessary that: ‘‘the creation of 
debt should always be accompanied with the 
means of extinguishment.’’ 
In other words, to retain and enjoy the pros-
perity that flows from good credit, it is nec-
essary for a nation to pay its bills. 
The United States has never defaulted on 
the payment of any debt incurred, and be-
cause of the size and strength of its economic 
and unmatched creditworthiness, is able to 
borrow on the lowest and most favorable 
terms of any nation or entity in the history of 
the world. 
So secure and reliable is a bond issues by 
the Department of Treasury that the United 
States is the preferred haven for investments 
of foreign governments, corporations, and sov-
ereign wealth funds. 
The interest rate charged the federal gov-
ernment of the United States is the base for 
which every rate, from the prime rate charged 
the richest corporation to rates charged small 
business on purchases to the mortgages rates 
and students loans taken out by consumers. 
If you raise the cost of borrowing for the 
government of the United States, you set off 
a chain reaction of increased interest rates for 
every other borrower in the United States and 
around the world. 
This is why leading public finance experts 
and agencies, like Moody’s Chief Economist 
Mark Zandi, have said it would be ‘‘cata-
clysmic’’ for the United States to default on its 
loan obligations. 
Republicans know the debt ceiling needs to 
be raised; in 2019 during the Trump Adminis-
tration, the Republican Senate Majority Leader 
marshalled Senate Republicans to vote to 
raise the debt ceiling, saying: ‘‘We raised the 
debt ceiling because America can’t default[,] 
that would be a disaster.’’ 
Madam Speaker, this debate over extending 
the debt limit is not about restraining future 
spending, it is about paying the bills piled up 
already under both Republican and Demo-
cratic administrations. 
The question of raising the national debt 
limit does not depend on how one feels about 
the Build Back Better agenda, as wildly pop-
ular as it is among all Americans, Democrats, 
Independents, and Republicans included. 
It is instead about preserving the singular 
asset of the United States, its enviable and 
unrivaled creditworthiness, to finance future in-
vestments beneficial to the national interest, 
like the provision of free college for two years, 
or $2 billion investment to reduce violence in 
communities approved by the Committee on 
the Judiciary, or investments to preserve and 
strengthen Medicaid expansion programs, or 
extend broadband to underserved rural and 
urban areas, an action that will be as life- 
changing as the rural electrification program 
was in the 1930s. 
Madam Speaker, if our friends across the 
aisle really want to shrink the deficit, reduce 
the national debt, practice fiscal responsibility, 
and bring about sustained economic growth 
and prosperity, there is a much better, easier, 
and more certain way to achieve these goals 
than by tampering with the U.S. Constitution. 
The easier and better way is for the Amer-
ican people to keep a Democrat in the White 
House and place Democratic majorities in the 
House and Senate. 
In the 1990s under the leadership of Presi-
dent Clinton the budget was balanced for four 
consecutive years, the national debt was paid 
down, the national debt, 23 million new jobs 
were created, and projected surpluses ex-
ceeded $5 trillion. 
Under President Obama the financial crisis 
and economic meltdown inherited from his Re-
publican predecessor was ended, the annual 
deficit was reduced by 67 percent, the auto in-
dustry was saved from collapse, and 15 mil-
lion jobs were created. 
In contrast, under every Republican admin-
istration since President Reagan the size of 
the deficit bequeathed to his successor was 
substantially larger than the deficit he inher-
ited, a major economic recession occurred, 
and economic growth was lower than it was at 
the beginning of his administration. 
To preserve the sanctity of the full faith and 
credit of the United States, protect American 
jobs and businesses of all sizes, and ensure 
the continued growth of the economy, I sup-
port and urge all Members to join me in voting 
for S.J. Res. 33—Joint resolution relating to 
increasing the debt limit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to the rule, the previous 
question is ordered on the joint resolu-
tion. 
The question is on the third reading 
of the joint resolution. 
The joint resolution was ordered to 
be read a third time, and was read the 
third time.

question is on the passage of the joint 
resolution.

So the joint resolution was passed. 
The result of the vote was announced

Stated for: 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I was present

sage of S.J. Res. 33. However, it has come to 
my attention that my vote was not recorded,

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 14, 2021 
No. 215 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Honorable RAPH-
AEL G. WARNOCK, a Senator from the 
State of Georgia. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, lover of humanity, give us 
today Your pardon and peace. Pardon 
the sins of our lips: the unkind words 
we may have spoken. Pardon the sins 
of our minds: the refusal to face facts. 
Lord, pardon the sins of our hearts: the 
pride that makes us forget to love our 
neighbors as we love ourselves. 
Mighty God, place Your peace within 
our Senators, providing them with the 
certainty that Your love can vanquish 
fear. And, Lord, we continue to pray 
for the tornado recovery efforts. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge 
of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

APPOINTMENT OF ACTING

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

U.S. SENATE,

Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3,

a Senator from the State of Georgia, to per-
form the duties of the Chair.

pore. 
f

f

f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will proceed to executive ses-
sion and resume consideration of the 
following nomination, which the clerk 
will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Samantha D. 
Elliott, of New Hampshire, to be 
United States District Judge for the 
District of New Hampshire. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
SENATE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today, 
the Senate will vote to advance at 
least one more Biden judicial nominee; 
we will move forward on our annual 
Defense bill; we will vote on the mo-
tion to proceed on legislation to raise 
the debt ceiling—all, hopefully, before 
we start the afternoon. It is a busy day 
for the Senate, so let me break down 
each of these items in some detail. 
On the legislative front, later this 
morning, the Senate will vote to in-
voke cloture on the annual Defense 
bill, negotiated on a bicameral-bipar-
tisan basis. For over 60 years, the 
NDAA, the National Defense Author-
ization Act, has passed without fail, on 
a mostly bipartisan basis. So I thank 
all of my colleagues for working in 
good faith to get this Defense bill done. 
The Senate will then turn to the crit-
ical matter of addressing the debt limit 
in order to avoid a first-ever default on 
our sovereign debt. Last week, Demo-
crats and Republicans came together 
to pass legislation, setting up a fast- 
track process for addressing the debt 
limit. Today, we are going to complete 
that process, and it will come in two 
steps. 
First, as I said, we will vote on the 
motion to proceed, followed by a vote 
on final passage later today. Thanks to 
last week’s agreement between Demo-
crats and Republicans, today’s motion 
to proceed will be set at a majority 
threshold. Once we are on the bill, no 
amendments will be in order. Debate 
will be limited to 10 hours, and we hope 
to yield back debate time on our side 
to keep this process moving. The reso-
lution we will vote on will provide for 
the raising of the debt limit to a level 
commensurate to funding that is nec-
essary to get into 2023. 
As I have said repeatedly, this is 
about paying debt accumulated by both 
parties, so I am pleased Republicans 
and Democrats came together to facili-
tate a process that has made address-
ing the debt ceiling possible. I want to 
thank the Republican leader and all of 
my Republican colleagues who reached 
out across the aisle in good faith to 
bring 
us 
to 
this 
point—no 
brinksmanship, no default on the debt, 
no risk of another recession. Respon-
sible governing has won on this exceed-
ingly important issue. The American 
people can breathe easy and rest as-
sured there will not be a default. 
So, once again, I thank the Repub-
lican leader and my Republican col-
leagues who voted with us to address 
this issue. The Senate can be done with 
this matter before the end of the day—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9128 
December 14, 2021 
crossing another major item off of our 
December to-do list. 
Off the floor, Democrats continue 
working to put the Senate in a position 
to act on President Biden’s Build Back 
Better Act, along with the timeline I 
have set out for our caucus. This week, 
bipartisan Byrd bath meetings with the 
Parliamentarian will continue. I thank 
my colleagues, the Parliamentarian, 
and her team for working through this 
important and difficult process. 
The President will also continue his 
conversations with our caucus as we 
hash out the final details of the legisla-
tion. Build Back Better is moving for-
ward, and I thank all of my colleagues 
and the President for their diligence 
and their commitment to get this done. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. President, on judges and nomina-
tions, in addition to our legislative 
agenda, the Senate will also work 
today and the rest of the week on con-
firming more of President Biden’s 
nominees to serve on the Federal 
bench. 
First, we will hold a vote this morn-
ing to proceed on the nomination of 
Samantha Elliott to serve as a district 
judge for the District of New Hamp-
shire. As soon as today, we also hope to 
vote on the confirmation of Jennifer 
Sung of Oregon, nominated to sit on 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit. The Senate invoked cloture on 
Ms. Sung at the end of last week, and 
I want to say a few words in support of 
this remarkable nominee. 
Throughout her career, Ms. Sung has 
proven herself to be an exceptionally 
impartial adjudicator, a valiant advo-
cate for working Americans, and I am 
confident she will be an excellent judge 
who adds to the personal and profes-
sional diversity of the Ninth Circuit. 
A graduate of Oberlin and Yale Law 
School, Ms. Sung’s first experience 
with the Ninth Circuit came while she 
served as a clerk for Judge Betty 
Fletcher before embarking on a career 
in private practice focused on employ-
ment and on labor law. For over a dec-
ade, she regularly represented low-in-
come workers, minority workers, and 
underserved communities in disputes 
against their employers. As a member 
of the Oregon Employment Relations 
Board, she struck a difficult balance 
between protecting the rights of work-
ing Americans while applying the law 
without prejudice—the key ingredients 
for any successful Federal judge. 
If confirmed, Ms. Sung will be one of 
the very few Asian Americans to sit on 
the Federal judiciary. Along with Ms. 
Elliott, she would be the 31st judge 
whom the Senate Democratic majority 
has confirmed this year—the most 
under any President’s first year in dec-
ades—and we are doing it with out-
standing, impartial, and diverse nomi-
nees, and we are going to keep working 
in the months ahead. 
Today, article III judges are still 
overwhelmingly 
White, 
overwhelm-
ingly male, and overwhelmingly from 
big law firms or prosecutorial back-
grounds. Many of these individuals 
have served admirably on the bench, 
but we hope the trailblazers of today 
can be closer to the norm of tomorrow. 
We want our courts to include more 
women, more diverse candidates, both 
demographically 
and 
professionally, 
and more judges who come from unique 
walks of life. That is how we can 
strengthen Americans’ trust in an 
independent and impartial judiciary— 
so important to the vitality of our de-
mocracy. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Now, Mr. President, on the COVID 
moment of silence, this evening, I will 
join the Speaker and other congres-
sional leaders on the Capitol steps to 
mark a dreaded and sorrowful mile-
stone as 800,000 Americans—800,000— 
have now lost their lives to the COVID– 
19 pandemic. We will hold a moment of 
silence in their memory. 
As Americans come together for the 
holidays, as we take stock of the long 
road we have taken this year, many of 
us carry in our hearts an unresolvable 
contradiction: 
gratitude 
for 
the 
progress we have made but grief for the 
loss we have endured along the way. 
Thanks to vaccines, tens of thou-
sands of deaths—maybe even hundreds 
of thousands—have been, thankfully, 
prevented. Across the country, Ameri-
cans are returning to work and once 
again are meeting at bars, at res-
taurants, at concerts. 
Our country is far better off today 
than we were a year ago, but on this 
day—this day—we will remember that 
800,000 loved ones did not make it this 
far: a lost father or grandfather, moth-
er or grandmother, friend or familiar 
face in the neighborhood. All of us 
know someone whom this disease has 
taken away. And, of course, we are not 
out of the woods yet. As the Omicron 
variant makes its way across the coun-
try, I urge my fellow New Yorkers and 
all of my fellow Americans to get vac-
cinated and boosted as soon as possible, 
if eligible. Vaccines remain the best— 
the very best—way to bring this dis-
ease to an end. 
I hope the milestone we observe 
today is the final one in our fight 
against this awful disease. With vac-
cines, we can rid ourselves of COVID 
and avoid adding to the awful sum that 
we have reached this week. 
As for those we have lost, today, we 
remember them. We hold them close to 
our hearts, and we commit to doing our 
part to bring this pandemic to an end. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
KENTUCKY 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
Kentucky is working to recover from 
the deadly storms and tornadoes. Each 
day brings entirely new challenges. 
Tens of thousands are still dealing with 
water, gas, or power outages. Families 
are in shock and grief over the loss of 
loved ones. Rebuilding the areas in 
Kentucky leveled by this storm will 
take months, if not years, to complete. 
Amid this pain, though, bright lights 
of hope shine through. In the face of 
tragedy, 
Kentuckians 
are 
still 
as 
strong and as generous as we have al-
ways been. 
Yesterday, I spoke with the Taylor 
County judge-executive. He told me 
that 70 families in his county had lost 
their homes in the storm. Emergency 
responders made shelters available, but 
folks were completely taken in by fam-
ily, friends, or neighbors—just the kind 
of people we have in Kentucky. 
In Mayfield, residents are already be-
ginning to rebuild only days after the 
storm leveled full city blocks. Church-
es hosted Sunday services this past 
weekend. Locals brought their chain 
saws and cleared debris from the city’s 
roads. People from nearby counties and 
States have flooded—literally flooded— 
in to help. 
One man, Jimmy Finch, has struck a 
chord with America’s hearts all across 
the country. He had no connections to 
Mayfield 
whatsoever. 
He 
is 
from 
Clarksville, TN. But after the disaster, 
he borrowed a big meat smoker, got 
into his car, made the hour-and-a-half 
journey in the dead of night and start-
ed serving up food the next morning. 
This fellow from Tennessee came up to 
Kentucky and brought a whole bunch 
of food. On Sunday morning, for hours, 
he fed chicken, hot links, and burgers 
to hungry residents who had been with-
out heat or power for days. 
Western Kentucky’s radio and TV 
stations have kept operating through-
out this crisis, delivering vital infor-
mation, even amid roving power out-
ages. State parks opened their doors to 
residents who lost their homes. Busi-
nesses, individuals, and charities have 
been generous with food, water, and 
shelter. 
Kentucky’s 
first 
responders 
are 
working hand in hand with FEMA to 
provide coordinated relief. Doctors, 
nurses, firefighters, and law enforce-
ment officers are working literally 
through the night. Utility workers are 
making a Herculean effort to restore 
power and water. 
Hundreds 
of 
Kentucky 
National 
Guardsmen have deployed to Western 
Kentucky to offer their assistance. And 
in Fort Campbell, the Federal Govern-
ment has provided a critical lifeline of 
support: 61 generators, 74,000 meals, 
135,000 liters of water, thousands of 
cots and blankets, all supplied by Fort 
Campbell. 
I am in close contact with Governor 
Beshear, our Federal Agencies, and 
local leaders. My staff and I have been 
in frequent touch with the White 
House.

Kentucky will come back from this 
bigger and better than ever before. I 
will make sure the Senate provides all 
the assistance we can to make sure 
that is a reality. 
INFLATION 
Now, Mr. President, on a totally dif-
ferent matter, Washington Democrats’ 
printing, borrowing, and spending ad-
diction is directly hurting American 
families. 
Two-thirds of the American people, a 
supermajority, are worried about infla-
tion. About half the middle class and 70 
percent of low-income families say 
soaring prices have personally hurt 
their household. And it isn’t getting 
better, like the Biden administration 
promised it would. It is actually get-
ting worse. 
Last Friday, the Labor Department 
released a jaw-dropping report: The 
consumer price index has shot up 6.8 
percent over the past year; 6.8 percent 
inflation, the worst inflation—listen to 
this—the worst inflation in 40 years. 
Now, it is true that the average 
American worker has gotten a pay in-
crease since 2020, but rising prices have 
more—more—than wiped that totally 
out. 
We have a remarkable situation 
where American workers are earning 
raises, but their bigger paychecks buy 
their families even less than what their 
smaller paychecks bought before the 
Democrats took power. The net effect 
is a nearly 2-percent pay cut for the av-
erage American. 
Now, our citizens do know what is 
happening. Sixty-seven percent of the 
country says Washington needs to ‘‘cut 
back on spending and printing money.’’ 
Let me say that again. Sixty-seven per-
cent of the country says Washington 
needs to ‘‘cut back on spending and 
printing money.’’ 
But here in Washington, leading 
Democrats want to plow ahead and 
double down on the reckless taxing- 
and-spending spree that got us here. 
They want to respond to this stunning 
inflation report by printing, borrowing, 
and spending trillions upon trillions 
more on new entitlements and far-left 
programs. 
If that weren’t bad enough, on Fri-
day, a new report showed their social-
ist shopping spree could cost the coun-
try trillions more than Democrats are 
willing to admit. 
You see, as one of our Democratic 
colleagues explained last month, his 
party’s bill is packed full of ‘‘shell 
games’’ 
and 
‘‘budget 
gimmicks’’— 
‘‘shell games’’ and ‘‘budget gimmicks.’’ 
For example, their bill pretends that 
major new entitlements would simply 
expire after a few years. 
Of course, that never happens. As a 
wise man once said, ‘‘Nothing is so per-
manent as a temporary government 
program.’’ And Democrats aren’t even 
pretending they think the spending 
would stop. They are boasting about a 
permanent transformation. The fake 
expiration dates are just an accounting 
trick so the pricetag looks artificially 
low. 
And last Friday, the Congressional 
Budget Office announced that if we ac-
knowledge the permanent entitlements 
would be permanent—in other words, 
tell the truth—their bill would actu-
ally cost $4.9 trillion in the first decade 
alone. That is the truth of the situa-
tion. It would explode the deficit by $3 
trillion in that same 10-year period. 
Democrats are trying to reassure 
their 
alarmed 
Members 
that 
they 
would find new ways to offset future 
extensions. But let’s think about it. 
They have just spent months shoveling 
every possible pay-for into this exist-
ing bill. They already burned through 
huge permanent tax hikes just to par-
tially offset the bill with the gim-
micks. Extending these programs fur-
ther would either explode our national 
debt or it would take even further tril-
lions and even further gigantic tax 
hikes that Democrats are simply un-
willing to specify. 
So which is it, historic deficits or 
trillions more in secret tax hikes? The 
right answer for the country is neither. 
Later today, every Senate Democrat 
is going to vote along party lines to 
raise our Nation’s debt limit by tril-
lions of dollars. If they jam through 
another reckless taxing-and-spending 
spree, this massive debt increase will 
just be the beginning: more printing 
and borrowing to set up more reckless 
spending, to cause more inflation, to 
hurt working families even more. 
What the American people need is a 
break. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. President, now, on one final mat-
ter, for months, while our colleagues 
have been writing their reckless tax-
ing-and-spending spree behind closed 
doors, the Democratic majority let the 
National Defense Authorization Act sit 
in limbo. This week, 41⁄2 months after it 
was cleared by the Armed Services 
Committee, the Senate should finally— 
finally—finish this legislation. 
Unfortunately, 
those 
who 
mean 
America harm haven’t been waiting 
around for us to act. Threats to our na-
tional security are grave and getting 
graver. Since the Biden administra-
tion’s disastrous retreat from Afghani-
stan, according to our top commander 
in the region, the U.S. military has but 
a small fraction of the actionable intel-
ligence they had before the coalition 
withdrew. 
But the predictable, avoidable resur-
gence of terrorist networks, of course, 
has continued apace. We also know 
that more American citizens and per-
manent 
residents 
remain 
stranded 
under Taliban rule than the Biden ad-
ministration is willing to admit. 
Meanwhile, the threat of further Rus-
sian aggression toward Ukraine is test-
ing whether this White House and our 
allies in Europe will avoid misguided 
half measures to deter and defend 
against grave and growing threats. 
So at the risk of stating the obvious, 
the United States needs to follow 
through with promises of urgent, sub-
stantive assistance to Ukraine and en-
courage other NATO allies to do the 
same thing. This should not be con-
troversial. Only in the warped world of 
Kremlin propaganda is giving Ukraine 
the means to defend itself considered 
provocative. 
These real threats to national secu-
rity and others too numerous to name 
should serve as a reminder of the need 
for America to lead by example and 
commit to modernizing our own mili-
tary capabilities, which in turn means 
taking the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act seriously. 
So I am glad the Senate is finally set 
to vote on this crucial legislation. 
While the process has been imperfect, I 
am glad that bipartisan work has pro-
duced a bill that authorizes an increase 
in top-line funding for our national de-
fense. 
After months of delays, our col-
leagues have an opportunity to begin 
showing that America is serious about 
keeping pace with adversaries like 
Russia that have spent literally dec-
ades modernizing their militaries with 
a singular focus on countering our 
military advantage. 
We have an opportunity to pay more 
than just lip service to competition 
with China. We have an opportunity to 
lay a foundation that we ought to fol-
low through with robust and full-year 
Defense appropriations. 
I would encourage all Senators to ad-
vance this legislation today. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
TORNADOES 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the 
monstrous chain of tornadoes and vio-
lent storms that rampaged across Illi-
nois and five other States last Friday 
is a terrible reminder in America that 
we are all one people. 
The killer storms didn’t stop at State 
lines. They didn’t discriminate based 
on skin color, creed, political party, or 
age. Among the more than 90 victims 
that we know of at this moment, the 
eldest was 86 years old; the youngest, 
sadly, was a tiny baby of just 5 months 
old. 
Even as people in my State of Illinois 
grieve for victims in our State, we also 
mourn for and with all those who died 
and are suffering in nearby States: Ar-
kansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Mis-
souri, and especially our neighbor to 
the south, Kentucky. 
Senator MCCONNELL has spoken, and 
we have all seen reports, of the stag-
gering destruction in Mayfield, KY, 
and other communities. 
I want to say a few words about the 
destruction that was wreaked on my 
own State and also about the tremen-
dous outpouring of compassion and 
community. 
The National Weather Service tells 
us more than 30 tornadoes tore through 
6 States last Friday night. The most 
destructive may go down as the longest 
continuous tornado in the history of 
the United States. That tornado ap-
pears to have remained on the ground 
for 4 hours, traveling 290 miles across

December 14, 2021 
four States, pulverizing everything in 
its path. 
From Kentucky, there were reports 
of objects being lifted 30,000 feet in the 
air by the force of the tornado. Treas-
ured family photos were found 100 
miles away. Sadly, at least 80 people 
have lost their lives in Kentucky. 
In Illinois, we have also suffered 
staggering losses. Four tornadoes tore 
across our State between 7:30 and 10 
last Friday. The greatest devastation 
was in Edwardsville, IL, Madison Coun-
ty, where a powerful tornado with 
winds up to 155 miles an hour peeled 
the roof off a massive Amazon distribu-
tion facility about 9 o’clock. I know 
the facility. I have been there. 
Massive concrete walls 11 inches 
thick and 40 feet high caved in, trap-
ping employees who were working to 
fill Christmas and holiday orders. Fire 
and rescue crews from at least 20 com-
munities rushed to the scene. More 
than 45 workers managed to escape 
from that mountain of rubble, but 6 
workers died when the warehouse col-
lapsed. The oldest was 62; the youngest 
was 26. Thirty more workers were hurt. 
One is still hospitalized with critical 
injuries. 
I know I speak for millions of Ameri-
cans when I say that our hearts go out 
to all those who perished in Friday’s 
tornadoes and to those they left be-
hind. 
I thank President Biden for respond-
ing quickly. Yesterday, our Governor, 
JB Pritzker, requested an emergency 
declaration, and of course we joined 
him. The President issued the emer-
gency order just a few hours after that 
request. This assistance will help our 
State immediately, but there is more 
to do. Our thanks to the Red Cross and 
so many volunteers, local residents in 
communities across Illinois, for pitch-
ing 
in 
to 
help 
the 
victims. 
Supplementing that fine work are vol-
unteers who have come to help in any 
way they can. 
It was ironic that last week I had a 
coffee for a man named Jose Andres. 
Jose Andres is well known by many 
across the country for his extraor-
dinary efforts to feed hungry people. 
Last Tuesday, he spoke to us, a few 
members of our caucus, about his non-
profit organization, the World Central 
Kitchen. They have come to the rescue 
of people in need in Puerto Rico and 
Haiti and all across the United States 
and around the world. 
Today, World Central Kitchen is on 
the ground in Mayfield, KY, where the 
tornadoes struck last Friday, providing 
hot food to the victims. It is a time 
when America, a divided nation, actu-
ally sees our Nation coming together. 
The tornadoes didn’t distinguish be-
tween red States and blue States, be-
tween Trump supporters and Biden 
supporters, and it is my great hope 
that the Senate will also put aside its 
politics for a few moments and stand 
together to help the victims. 
BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
Mr. President, on a related matter, 
while we cannot say that last week’s 
killer tornadoes were directly related 
to climate change, there is no doubt 
among scientists that climate change 
is making the world’s weather patterns 
more volatile and destructive. 
How many times in the past year 
have Members of this Senate come to 
the floor to respond to a once-in-a-cen-
tury heat wave or a once-in-a-century 
storm that has hit their home State? I 
will just say, for tornadoes, you can’t 
be a kid growing up in the Midwest, as 
I was, and not know about tornadoes— 
how many times in the middle of the 
summer we were rousted from our bed 
as the sirens went off, and Mom would 
take us down to the basement, a safe 
place, until the storm would blow over. 
That was a summer phenomena. 
I just have to remind you that we 
just went through a December tornado 
in that same area—unheard of in years 
gone by. 
Over the summer, the Pacific North-
west burned in the worst heat wave on 
record; there were droughts in Western 
States; a polar vortex knocked a Texas 
power grid offline. Each of these deadly 
and disastrous weather events are re-
lated to the next, and it is fair warning 
to all of us that what is happening to 
the climate in the United States is 
happening around the world. 
Just yesterday, scientists warned 
that a glacier the size of Florida is at 
risk of splitting apart in the next few 
years, causing catastrophic rise in sea 
levels that could threaten the millions 
of people living in coastal areas. 
When we talk about Build Back Bet-
ter, the reconciliation bill, and that 
part of the bill that is focused on envi-
ronmental resilience, being ready to 
protect ourselves and to bounce back, 
if necessary, when extreme weather 
hits, it is the topic in this morning’s 
newspaper, and it will be in tomorrow’s 
as well. 
We ought to be coming together and 
finally putting aside our political dif-
ferences 
and 
realize 
that 
climate 
change is the threat to us now and an 
even greater threat to our children and 
grandchildren. 
Last week, I received a letter from 
one of the small business owners in our 
area, Dr. Dane Glueck. A few years 
ago, he started a company called 
StraightUp Solar, developing solar en-
ergy systems for homes and businesses 
in my State of Illinois and Missouri. 
He wrote and he said: ‘‘Solar is a job- 
creator, and the long-term tax incen-
tives in the Build Back Better Act for 
solar, storage, and domestic manufac-
turing will put us on a path to 
decarbonize the electric grid, reach the 
President’s 2035 clean energy target, 
and create hundreds of thousands of 
quality career opportunities in every 
community.’’ 
Today, Dr. Glueck employs almost 
100 people throughout the Midwest, but 
with investments in the Build Back 
Better Act, the reconciliation bill, he 
is going to expand operation and hire 
more workers. Let’s give him the in-
centive that he needs. 
I heard the Senator from Kentucky, 
the Republican leader, coming to the 
floor, and, once again, he is critical of 
this whole effort. I wish he would stop 
and reflect on the fact that our incen-
tives to move in the right direction on 
the environment really are an impor-
tant part of the conversation we should 
have after the devastation last Friday 
in his State and mine and across the 
Midwest. 
It is time to transform our environ-
mental crisis into an economic cata-
lyst. 
INSULIN 
Mr. President, it turns out it is an 
anniversary, just this month. You see, 
in 1921, 100 years ago, a Canadian sci-
entist named Frederick Banting dis-
covered insulin. He sold the patent for 
this discovery to the University of To-
ronto for $1. He declared that this life-
saving drug didn’t belong to him: ‘‘It 
belongs to the world.’’ 
He wasn’t the only unselfish scientist 
I can remember. I remember, as a kid, 
our fear of polio, and along came Dr. 
Jonas Salk—bless his soul—who discov-
ered the vaccine that we needed to pro-
tect ourselves. There was no great po-
litical debate. People weren’t threat-
ening lawsuits. My mom and dad said: 
Line up and roll up your sleeve, kid; we 
are going to do what needs to be done 
to protect you from polio. 
Dr. Jonas Salk gave away the patent 
to that drug as well. It was a different 
era, perhaps, when insulin was discov-
ered or the polio vaccine, but we should 
reflect on the state of play today of 
that drug, insulin. 
One hundred years later, there are 8.4 
million diabetics in the United States 
who rely on insulin. They have to pay— 
many of them—an exorbitant amount 
of money for a drug that supposedly be-
longs to them, according to its discov-
erer. 
As the cost of insulin has risen, average 
list prices increased 40 percent for insulin be-
tween 2014 and 2018. 
I am quoting from an article in to-
day’s USA Today by Katie Wedell. 
Patients and their families shell out hun-
dreds of dollars a month even if they have 
good insurance. 
Rod Regalado is a father of a teen 
with type 1 diabetes. Do you know 
what he calls the insulin pricing sys-
tem? Legal extortion. 
This article tells the story of what he 
went through. He had never heard of a 
pharmacy benefit manager before 2 
years ago, but it was 2 years ago that 
his son Matt, then 14 years old, was di-
agnosed with type 1 diabetes, and Mr. 
Regalado got a crash course in insulin 
pricing in America today. 
His first trip to the pharmacy when his son 
was released from a hospital came with a 
$1,000 price tag for all the testing supplies 
and insulin he’d never purchased before. The 
next month, when all he had to do was buy 
more insulin, the price was still north of $400 
after insurance. 
The single dad of two said he thought he 
had good insurance until he found himself 
having to redo his entire household budget 
to afford the insulin to keep his son alive.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9131 
December 14, 2021 
‘‘I thought how do people do this?’’ he said. 
He is a resident of Tekamah, NE. He 
started making calls to his insurance 
company, the pharmacy, and doctors, 
trying to figure out a way to lower his 
out-of-pocket expenses for the insulin 
that his son needed to survive. 
Then he called his Congressman. Con-
gressman JEFF FORTENBERRY, a Repub-
lican of Nebraska, said in July: ‘‘The 
harsh reality is that the cost of insulin 
is 
artificially 
high 
and 
ever-esca-
lating.’’ 
He has introduced a bill for capping 
the prices. They call it Matt’s Act, 
after Mr. Regalado’s son. Matt’s Act 
would make insulin prices fair for ev-
eryone by capping the price at $60 a 
vial and $20 a vial for those on insur-
ance. 
What a dramatic difference that 
would make for the Regalado family in 
Nebraska—instead of $400, $20. 
The reason I raise that is that the 
provision in law that we are trying to 
enact is in the same bill that the Re-
publican leader just came to the floor 
and told us America cannot afford. The 
tax increases in that bill—and there 
will be tax increases—will only apply 
to people making over $400,000 a year. 
And yet the Republican leader comes 
to the floor and talks about this ter-
rible idea of raising taxes. 
So let’s step back and measure the 
difference here. Should Mr. Regalado— 
a single dad, father of two, with a 14- 
year-old son who needs insulin to live— 
be paying $400 a month or $20 a month 
for the insulin—the lifesaving insulin? 
And to make up the difference, is it un-
fair to ask someone making over 
$400,000 a year to pay more in taxes? 
You be the judge. I don’t even think 
it is a close call. 
What we need to do is to get down to 
business. I don’t know that there will 
be a single Republican voting to sup-
port this effort to reduce the cost of in-
sulin for diabetics. That is just the way 
politics works in this Chamber, I am 
afraid. But I do hope that the 8 million 
families who have a diabetic son or 
daughter, father or mother will step up 
and speak up in the next few days be-
cause we have a chance to bring this 
measure to the floor this year—a meas-
ure that will affect many different 
areas of the law but, specifically, the 
cost of insulin for American families. 
If those 8 million families will stand 
up and speak up and say to Members of 
the U.S. Senate, ‘‘Enough, you have ne-
gotiated enough; close the deal; do 
something that will be helpful to our 
families,’’ just maybe that can make a 
difference. 
Maybe the endless negotiations that 
have gone on for month after month 
after month will finally come to an 
end. Now is the time to get it done. We 
have work to do in the Senate at clear-
ing the bill for final passage. But I 
think we are on track to get that done. 
What we need to have is a groundswell 
of support from across the America. 
When you take a look at the other 
provisions in the bill, helping working 
families to pay for daycare—for good-
ness’ sake, there is hardly a family 
around, unless they are very wealthy, 
that isn’t concerned about the cost and 
quality of daycare available. 
We have a provision in this bill, the 
same bill that Senator MCCONNELL 
spoke against just a few minutes ago, 
to help families pay for daycare. Is it 
important to these families? Well, it is 
important to my family. I visited with 
my granddaughter over the weekend, 
and I am sure there are many people in 
my situation, with grandchildren, who 
look at those kids and realize they 
should be in a safe, nurturing, afford-
able environment every single day so 
mom and dad don’t have to think 
twice. 
Is it important to have a provision in 
the law which says we are going to pro-
vide home healthcare services to elder-
ly members of our family or disabled 
members of our family? 
I will tell you this. The elderly folks 
whom I spoke to, the senior citizens, 
want to stay independent as long as 
possible, and they want to stay home 
as long as possible. If we can help them 
stay home and be independent, why 
wouldn’t we do it? If it means a tax in-
crease for people making over $400,000 a 
year, so be it. Sign me up for that in-
crease. That is the sort of thing I think 
we do in America. Those who are well 
off pay a little bit more in taxes so 
those who are struggling can get a 
helping hand. 
So when the Republicans come to the 
floor and tell us how terrible this bill 
is, well, tell it to 8 million families in 
America with someone who needs insu-
lin to stay alive each month. Tell it to 
the millions of families with kids who 
want to make sure they have peace of 
mind that these kids are being taken 
care of while they go to work. Tell it to 
the families with elderly parents or 
people who are disabled in their house-
hold who need a helping hand to be 
able to stay home and have quality 
healthcare. 
All of these things are addressed in 
this bill. It is important that we pass 
it, and I hope we do it soon. But we 
need to hear from America to create 
the momentum to get that job done. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD this 
entire article, from USA Today, on 
insulin. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From USA Today] 
‘IT
IS
LEGAL
EXTORTION’: DIABETICS
PAY 
STEEP
PRICE
FOR
INSULIN
AS
REBATES 
DRIVE UP COSTS 
(By Katie Wedell) 
In 
1921, 
Canadian 
scientist 
Frederick 
Banting discovered insulin and later sold the 
patent to the University of Toronto for $1, 
declaring that the lifesaving drug did not be-
long to him. ‘‘It belongs to the world.’’ 
One hundred years later, the 8.4 million 
diabetics in the USA who rely on insulin pay 
an exorbitant amount of money for a drug 
that supposedly belongs to them. 
As the cost of insulin has risen—average 
list prices increased 40% from 2014 to 2018— 
patients and their families shell out hun-
dreds of dollars a month even when they 
have good insurance. They pay other bills 
late to keep their insulin-dependent children 
alive. When they can’t make ends meet any 
other way, they ration their medication, 
often ending up in a hospital because they 
could afford only a fraction of the insulin 
they were supposed to use that month. 
‘‘It is legal extortion,’’ Rod Regalado, fa-
ther of a teen with Type 1 diabetes, said 
about the opaque insulin pricing system. 
A bill that would create a federal cap on 
monthly 
insulin 
out-of-pocket 
costs 
is 
named after his son. Matt’s Act would cap 
insulin prices at $20 to $60 a month or even 
$0 for those with high-deductible health 
plans. Similar provisions are included in the 
House-passed version of the Build Back Bet-
ter Act, which proposes an insurance co-pay 
cap of $35 for insulin. 
The bills attempt to simplify costs for con-
sumers who are kept in the dark when it 
comes to the complex negotiations driving 
insulin prices up. 
‘‘If you or I were buying a gallon of milk 
from Kroger or whoever, if we saw that it 
was $20, we would know that we’re getting 
ripped off,’’ said Antonio Ciaccia, former lob-
byist for the Ohio Pharmacists Association 
and CEO of 46brooklyn, a drug price research 
firm. ‘‘The gallon of milk stays within a 
slightly competitive range because we know 
where we could go elsewhere to find a $3 gal-
lon.’’ 
That competitive price pressure doesn’t 
exist in health care, he said. ‘‘Because we as 
cash-paying customers aren’t the predomi-
nant source of revenue for health care,’’ 
In a report on insulin prices released in 
January, the Senate Finance Committee laid 
out the numerous factors that combine to 
make insulin so expensive. 
The committee found that drug manufac-
turers continually increase insulin’s list 
price to offer larger rebates to pharmacy 
benefit managers and health insurers, ‘‘all in 
the hopes that their product would receive 
preferred formulary placement,’’ the report 
said. 
Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, 
oversee the prescription drug part of health 
plans—negotiating with drugmakers for bulk 
discounts and deciding which drugs will be 
covered and which will be excluded from 
their formularies or approved drug lists. 
Their clients are health insurance plans, in-
cluding 
employers 
and 
government-run 
Medicare and Medicaid. 
No drugmaker wants to be left off the pre-
ferred list of a big PBM such as CVS 
Caremark or Express Scripts, because tens of 
millions of Americans are covered by insur-
ers using their services. 
This pricing structure exists for almost 
every drug on the market, but insulin has 
gotten focused attention because of the num-
ber of diabetics that rely on the lifesaving 
drug and the fact that it’s 100 years old yet 
getting more expensive every year. 
‘‘They’re kind of between a rock and a 
hard place,’’ Ciaccia said of the manufactur-
ers. Many have made lower-cost versions of 
their products available, but those don’t get 
listed on the formularies because they don’t 
offer any rebates on them, he said. 
Rebates are payments offered back to the 
PBMs in exchange for preferred placement 
on their formularies. If the list price is $400 
for an insulin product, the manufacturer 
may make $100 and give the other $300 back 
to the PBM, which typically passes those 
savings to its clients—employer and com-
mercial health plans. 
Patients may be forced to pay that $400 list 
price when they are in their deductible phase

and don’t get any of that rebated money di-
rectly. 
The government report found that manu-
facturers offered higher and higher rebates 
each year, in fear of being kicked off the pre-
ferred formularies. That means they must 
also inflate the list price each year to keep 
pace. 
In July 2013, insulin maker Sanofi offered 
rebates of 2% to 4% of the list price—also 
called the wholesale acquisition cost or 
WAC—for 
preferred 
placement 
on 
CVS 
Caremark’s formulary, the finance com-
mittee found. Five years later, Sanofi re-
bates were as high as 56%. 
Critics of the rebate system say it amounts 
to legalized kickbacks. In 2019, a class-action 
lawsuit accused manufacturers and PBMs of 
engaging in a commercial bribery ‘‘scheme,’’ 
conspiring to raise the prices of insulin drugs 
to increase the fees manufacturers paid to 
PBMs. 
Pharmacy benefit managers say the manu-
facturers drive up prices and keep out any 
competition from generics. 
‘‘Insulin pricing strategies used by drug 
manufacturers to avoid competition through 
ongoing patent extensions on insulin prod-
ucts are a significant barrier to getting costs 
down,’’ said Greg Lopes, spokesman for the 
Pharmaceutical Care Management Associa-
tion, which represents PBMs. 
‘‘PBMs have introduced programs to cap, 
or outright eliminate, out-of-pocket costs on 
insulin, and PBMs have stepped up efforts to 
help patients living with diabetes by pro-
viding clinical support and education, which 
result in better medication adherence and 
improve health outcomes,’’ Lopes said. 
Manufacturers, PBMs and nonprofits have 
set up patient assistance and coupon pro-
grams to reduce what patients spend on insu-
lin. Each program has its own requirements 
to qualify, its own rules and restrictions, and 
patients have to be aware that the programs 
exist. 
Drugmakers often advertise their patient 
assistance programs, but the onus ulti-
mately lies with the patient to find and 
apply for free or reduced-cost insulin. Nu-
merous organizations have developed data-
bases of assistance programs to help patients 
navigate 
the 
sea 
of 
options, 
including 
PhRMA’s 
Medicine 
Assistance 
Tool, 
RxAssist, NeedyMeds and Beyond Type1’s 
GetInsulin.org. 
‘‘For the population that can take advan-
tage of those programs, that’s great,’’ said 
American Diabetes Association Chief Advo-
cacy Officer Lisa Murdock. ‘‘We think insu-
lin should be affordable at the point of sale 
for everyone.’’ 
Lopes pointed out that PBMs pass through 
to health plan sponsors the vast amount of 
the rebates they negotiate. In the case of 
Medicare Part D, the PCMA said that 
amount is 99.6%. 
‘‘The rebates are then used to lower pre-
miums and out-of-pocket costs for patients,’’ 
Lopes said. 
CONSUMERS CAN PAY HUNDREDS MORE UNDER 
REBATE SYSTEM 
Nonprofit 
drug 
price 
research 
group 
46brooklyn released a report demonstrating 
how patients end up paying more because of 
rebates. 
It looked at a box of Lantus insulin pens— 
which hold pre-dosed cartridges for easier in-
jection—with a list price of $425. According 
to the Finance Committee’s report, Lantus 
offered the PBM OptumRx a rebate of 79.76% 
or $339 in 2019. 
The consumer’s health plan gets that re-
bate every month regardless of whether the 
consumer pays full-price in the deductible 
phase or pays a smaller co-insurance amount 
later in the year. 
46brooklyn used a fictional consumer who 
has a deductible of $1,644—a figure the Kaiser 
Family Foundation says is the U.S. average. 
Each month, January through April, the 
consumer in this scenario would pay close to 
the full list price for insulin, $408 in this case 
based on retail price data. Those same 
months, the health plan, paying $0 toward 
the insulin, would receive a $339 rebate. The 
manufacturer of the insulin would get the 
difference, or $69 in this scenario. 
The rest of the year, once the consumer hit 
his deductible, he would pay about $34 for in-
sulin each month. The health plan, after re-
bates, would pay about $35, giving the manu-
facturer the same total of $69. 
At the end of the year, this fictional dia-
betic spent a total of $1,906 for insulin while 
the manufacturer made $828. The consumer’s 
health plan via the PBM came out ahead, 
profiting $1,078 after getting more than $4,000 
worth of rebates. 
If all the middlemen and insurance were 
cut out, and the consumer was simply 
charged the net cost of the drug every 
month, 46brooklyn argued, the consumer 
would save more than $1,000 a year while the 
manufacturer would make the same profit. 
A study by researchers at the University of 
Southern California found that manufactur-
ers, often blamed for rising prices, actually 
make less money as list prices rise. Since 
2014, while list prices rose by 40%, the net 
price that manufacturers made off their in-
sulin products decreased more than 30%, ac-
cording to the study published in the Jour-
nal of the American Medical Association. 
The 
PCMA 
disputed 
the 
accuracy 
of 
46brooklyn’s rebate scenario. 
‘‘By cherry picking an extreme and unreal-
istic example of high patient out-of-pocket 
costs, the 46brooklyn report does a poor job 
of depicting the health care experience for 
most insured people with diabetes,’’ Lopes 
said. ‘‘For example, the report’s out-of-pock-
et cost assumption is actually significantly 
higher than the amount at which many plans 
set or cap patient cost sharing for insulin.’’ 
There are consumers who reported paying 
$400 out-of-pocket for a month’s supply of in-
sulin after insurance. Rod Regalado is one of 
them. 
A FATHER’S CRUSADE 
Regalado had never heard of a pharmacy 
benefit manager before two years ago. 
That’s when his son Matt, then 14, was di-
agnosed with Type 1 diabetes and Regalado 
got a crash course in insulin pricing. 
His first trip to the pharmacy when his son 
was released from a hospital came with a 
$1,000 price tag for all the testing supplies 
and insulin he’d never purchased before. The 
next month, when all he had to do was buy 
more insulin, the price was still north of $400 
after insurance. 
The single dad of two said he thought he 
had good insurance until he found himself 
having to redo his entire household budget 
to afford insulin. 
‘‘I thought how do people do this?’’ he said. 
The resident of Tekamah, Nebraska, start-
ed making calls to his insurance, pharmacy 
and doctors, trying to figure out a way to 
lower his out-of-pocket costs. Then he called 
his congressman. 
‘‘The harsh reality is that the cost of insu-
lin is artificially high and ever-escalating,’’ 
U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R–Neb., said in 
July when he and Rep. Angie Craig, D–Minn., 
reintroduced their bill aimed at capping 
prices. ‘‘Matt’s Act makes insulin prices fair 
for everyone by capping the price at $60 a 
vial and $20 a vial for those on insurance.’’ 
Though legislative efforts have focused on 
capping out-of-pocket costs, there has been a 
push to eliminate rebates altogether and 
drive down list prices across the market. 
That would require the buy-in of all parts of 
the drug supply chain. 
Some PBMs have created formularies that 
don’t require rebates, but they struggle to 
get health plans to adopt them. The insurers 
have come to expect and rely on the money 
from rebates, and some have them written 
into their PBM contracts. 
‘A MOMENTOUS DAY’ 
Ciaccia of 46brooklyn pointed to the new 
insulin product Semglee as an example of 
how dysfunctional the marketplace can be. 
In July, the FDA approved Semglee as the 
first interchangeable biosimilar insulin prod-
uct. Biosimilars are like generic drugs in 
that they can be substituted at the phar-
macy counter without needing a separate 
prescription. 
Semglee is interchangeable with Lantus. 
More biosimilars are likely to gain ap-
proval in the next few years. They’ve been 
touted as game changers that will lead to 
lower prices and more options for patients. 
Acting 
FDA 
Commissioner 
Janet 
Woodcock called it ‘‘a momentous day’’ for 
people who depend on insulin. ‘‘Biosimilar 
and 
interchangeable 
biosimilar 
products 
have the potential to greatly reduce health 
care costs,’’ she said. 
Biocon and Viatris, the makers of Semglee, 
launched two different versions of the drug— 
the branded one called Semglee and a non-
branded version called insulin glargine. 
The nonbranded version’s list price is 
about $148 for a package of five 3-ml pens, 
which is 65% cheaper than Lantus. 
There is indication that the largest PBMs 
in the country won’t carry that version on 
their preferred drug formularies, instead of-
fering the branded Semglee, which has a re-
ported list price of $404 per package of five. 
That makes it only slightly cheaper than 
Lantus at $425. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be able to 
complete my remarks prior to the vote. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the latest 
inflation numbers came out Friday, 
and the news was not good. Inflation is 
currently at the highest level in nearly 
40 years—40 years. The last time infla-
tion was this bad, ‘‘E.T.’’ and ‘‘Rocky 
III’’ were in theaters, and the Green 
Bay Packers were being coached by 
Bart Starr. 
High inflation is taking a major toll 
on American families. Gas prices are at 
a 7-year high. The price of used cars 
and trucks is up 31 percent—31 percent. 
Propane, kerosene, and firewood are up 
34 percent. 
Food prices have increased signifi-
cantly. Ground beef is up 14 percent. 
Apples are up 7.4 percent. Pork is up 17 
percent; eggs, 8 percent. Baby food is 
up 6.7 percent. Bacon and related prod-
ucts are up 21 percent. And the list 
continues. 
Rent prices are up. Utility prices are 
up. Furniture prices are up, and on and 
on. 
Inflation is so bad that, despite wage 
growth this year, Americans have seen 
a de facto pay cut, with real average 
hourly earnings down 1.9 percent this 
year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9133 
December 14, 2021 
Inflation is what happens when you 
have too many dollars chasing too few 
goods and services. And a big reason 
for our current inflation situation is 
the Democrats’ decision to pour a lot 
of unnecessary government money into 
the economy earlier this year, de-
spite—despite, 
I 
might 
add—being 
warned that their partisan $1.9 trillion 
American Rescue Plan spending spree 
could stoke inflation. 
And you don’t have to take my word 
for it. Here is what former Obama eco-
nomic adviser Jason Furman had to 
say recently when discussing our infla-
tion problem: 
The original sin was an oversized American 
Rescue Plan. It contributed to both higher 
output but also higher prices. 
That quote from Mr. Furman ap-
peared in a New York Times article 
that also noted: 
But some economists, including veterans 
of previous Democratic administrations, say 
much of Mr. Biden’s inflation struggle is 
self-inflicted. Lawrence H. Summers is one 
of those who say the stimulus bill [that] the 
president signed in March gave too much of 
a boost to consumer spending. . . . Mr. Sum-
mers, who served in the Obama and Clinton 
administrations, says inflation now risks 
spiraling out of control and other Demo-
cratic economists agree there are risks. 
Again, that is from the New York 
Times. 
Inflation is spiraling out of control, 
and Democrats are preparing to throw 
more fuel on the fire. That is right. 
Democrats are preparing to double 
down on the strategy that helped get 
us in this mess in the first place and 
pass yet another massive government 
spending bill. 
I am not sure whether Democrats 
simply don’t care about the inflation 
situation facing American families or 
whether they are operating under the 
delusion that they can somehow pass 
another major government spending 
bill without serious consequences for 
the economy. 
Regardless, there is no question that 
pouring another $1.75 trillion in gov-
ernment money into the economy 
would likely make our inflation crisis 
even worse than it is today. 
I say $1.75 trillion because that is 
what Democrats have been selling as 
the pricetag for their so-called Build 
Back Better plan. But as we learned on 
Friday of last week from the Congres-
sional Budget Office’s latest analysis, 
the Democrats’ spending spree would 
far exceed $1.75 trillion. When you take 
away the shell games and budget gim-
micks, the Democrats’ spending spree 
would cost almost $5 trillion—5 tril-
lion. And, of course, the tax hikes in 
the Democrats’ plan, as large as they 
are, wouldn’t even come close to fund-
ing that amount. 
The Democrats’ Build Back Better 
proposal, if implemented over 10 years, 
as they plan, would add an eye-popping 
$3 trillion to our national debt. It turns 
out that Build Back Better is more like 
‘‘Build Back Bankrupt.’’ 
Democrats have attempted to dis-
guise the true cost of their ‘‘Build 
Back Bankrupt’’ plan by strategically 
sunsetting various provisions before 
the end of the bill’s 10-year budget win-
dow. Of course, Democrats have never 
had 
any 
intention 
of 
actually 
sunsetting these provisions. But by 
claiming that they are going to sunset 
these measures, they have been able to 
sort of disguise the fact that their 
spending spree would actually cost 
nearly $5 trillion. 
That is the Congressional Budget Of-
fice, not me. The Congressional Budget 
Office, last Friday said, if extended— 
the 10-year window—this bill would 
cost $5 trillion. 
Democrats are implicitly admitting 
that they plan to extend these pro-
grams, but they are saying that people 
shouldn’t worry, that the cost of these 
extensions will be offset. Well, I would 
like to know just how exactly they 
plan to do that. 
With massive new tax hikes, on top 
of the tax hikes they have already in-
cluded in their bill—just how many tax 
hikes do Democrats think our economy 
can handle? 
And if Democrats had a plan for fu-
ture offsets, why didn’t they include 
those offsets in their bill, in the first 
place, along with an honest accounting 
of the length of their programs? 
Is it because they thought that the 
American people would balk if they 
knew the true cost of the bill, that 
they might not be crazy about the idea 
of a bill that would cost them $5 tril-
lion? 
I am hard-pressed to think of any-
thing 
more 
irresponsible 
than 
for 
Democrats to pass their Build Back 
Better—or their ‘‘Build Back Bank-
rupt’’—measure right now. Inflation is 
soaring, as I have just pointed out, and 
there is no clear end in sight. Even the 
Federal Reserve is now acknowledging 
that this isn’t transitory. They re-
moved that word from their descrip-
tion. 
We are emerging from a pandemic 
that required a lot of government ex-
penditure and a corresponding increase 
in our debt, and we have no idea what 
government money might be needed 
down the road. 
Passing a $5 trillion spending spree 
that would add $3 trillion to our na-
tional debt is the very last thing that 
we should be doing. 
I hope that at least some of my Dem-
ocrat colleagues will think better of 
their spending plans before the Amer-
ican people are forced to discover just 
what ‘‘Building Back Bankrupt’’ is 
really like. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9135 
December 14, 2021 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, 
after months of delay with NDAA, it 
has finally made its way to the Senate 
floor. The Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee passed its version by a strong, 
bipartisan vote of 23 to 3, and that was 
back in July. 
As a member of the Armed Services 
Committee since my first day here in 
the Senate, I have been proud to help 
draft this bill each year since 2013, and 
I was honored to play a part in drafting 
the bill this year. 
First and foremost, the 2022 NDAA 
takes care of the greatest asset Amer-
ica has—our men and women in uni-
form. It supports a well-deserved pay 
raise for members of the military, and 
it reauthorizes important special pays 
and bonuses. 
Keeping faith with our All-Volunteer 
Forces is essential so that our military 
men and women are able to focus on 
combating the threats that our Nation 
faces abroad. You don’t have to look 
far to see the threats I am talking 
about. 
Vladimir Putin has placed nearly 
100,000 Russian troops right on Russia’s 
border with Ukraine, essentially pos-
turing to invade a sovereign country. 
China continues to make shocking 
progress in developing new types of 
weapons. The Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff said that China’s recent 
test of a fractional orbital bombard-
ment system was very close to a 
‘‘Sputnik moment.’’ This new missile 
could potentially carry a nuclear war-
head anywhere in the world, and it was 
specifically designed to evade U.S. de-
fenses. Our adversaries are making 
huge strides forward. The NDAA recog-
nizes that and addresses it. 
This bill will keep the modernization 
of our strategic nuclear deterrent on 
schedule. This is crucial because even 
though our nuclear forces are still ef-
fective, we have pushed our weapons 
far beyond their designed lifetimes—in 
some cases, by decades. This bill au-
thorizes the resources necessary to 
keep modernization on track, and it 
will help make sure the next genera-
tion of systems is available before our 
current nuclear triad ages out. 
Perhaps 
most 
importantly, 
the 
NDAA tries to keep defense spending 
on pace with rising inflation. Inflation 
is at its highest level in decades, and it 
doesn’t look like it is slowing down 
anytime soon. 
The Biden administration originally 
proposed a top-line defense spending 
increase of just 1.6 percent. That would 
not have kept pace with inflation even 
in a normal year, but in a year when it 
is threatening to spiral out of control, 
it would have meant an unacceptable 
cut in resources for our military. The 
NDAA takes this year’s runaway infla-
tion into account. It offers an increase 
of $25 billion on top of President 
Biden’s proposal, and we came together 
across party lines to agree to that be-
cause it is what our military needs. 
At the risk of stating the obvious, 
the NDAA is about investing in our na-
tional defense. It is in the name, the 
‘‘National Defense Authorization Act.’’ 
But every State contributes in its own 
way to that national goal, and I am 
proud to say that this bill will bring 
some major wins to Nebraska, which 
has a long and rich military history. 
It includes $100 million for the Na-
tional Disaster Recovery Fund, which 
will help rebuild Offutt Air Force Base, 
the home of the Air Force’s 55th Wing 
and U.S. Strategic Command, after the 
devastating flooding that Nebraska ex-
perienced in 2019. It recognizes how 
critical the 55th Wing is to our Na-
tion’s intelligence, surveillance, and 
reconnaissance capabilities. Their mis-
sions take them all over the world, but 
they are proudly based in my State of 
Nebraska. 
The men and women who wear Amer-
ican military uniforms are part of the 
best fighting force the world has ever 
known. Our job here in Congress is to 
give them what they need, and this 
year’s NDAA does just that. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, in her 
1993 Nobel lecture, Toni Morrison—no 
conservative—told a story of an old 
woman who was approached by a group 
of kids, mocking her and asking her to 
offer her conjecture: 
Old woman, I hold in my hand a bird. Tell 
me whether it is living or dead. 
The blind, old woman was revered for 
her wisdom and experience. 
She responded: 
I don’t know whether the bird you are 
holding is dead or alive, but what I do know 
is that it is in your hands. It is in your 
hands. 
The old woman, of course, meant 
whether the bird is alive or dead is the 
responsibility of the person who holds 
it. 
Morrison said: 
The blind woman shifts attention away 
from assertions of power to the instrument 
through which that power is exercised. 
Now, Morrison could have been talk-
ing about Congress. I will leave to your 
judgment who in Congress is a mocking 
youth and who is the old woman, but in 
politics it is the instrument of power 
rather than the assertion of power that 
matters. 
Just this last week, the instruments 
of power were used, despite assertions 
otherwise, to quietly pave the way for 
the Democrats’ ‘‘Destroy America’’ 
bill, which they have called Build Back 
Better. Congress used a novel proce-
dure to pass a bill, giving Democrats a 
blank check to raise the debt ceiling to 
pay for Build Back Better. Procedural 
jujitsu is hardly the stuff of base-moti-
vating campaign rhetoric, but it is the 
instrument of power. 
Now I will describe how this hap-
pened, but a bit of background is nec-
essary. 
Like most legislation in the Senate, 
raising the debt ceiling, which has been 
done now 99 times since the end of the 
Second World War, ordinarily requires 
60 votes, which, in an evenly divided 
Senate, means Democrats and Repub-
licans have to work together to find an 
acceptable outcome. 
There is, of course, an exception that 
would allow Democrats to use a special 
budget 
reconciliation 
procedure 
to 
raise the debt ceiling without Repub-
lican help, with a simple majority 
vote—a simple majority vote that they 
could achieve if all 50 Democrats cast 
their votes. If there is an evenly di-
vided vote at the end of the day, it can 
be broken by the Vice President. But 
they didn’t want to use this special 
procedure, and I believe they didn’t 
want to use it for two independent rea-
sons. 
First, it was inconvenient. The spe-
cial reconciliation procedure would re-
quire too many steps and too much 
time for their tastes. Still, I don’t 
know of a single Republican Senator, 
myself included, who would unduly 
stall the Democrats from proceeding to 
its consideration. In fact, under the 
rules, if they follow the right steps, it 
is, more or less, a guaranteed outcome, 
one that doesn’t require a super-
majority and, at the end of the day, 
can be accomplished with a simple ma-
jority. 
Second, I suspect that Democrats 
didn’t want to bear the political cost of 
raising the debt ceiling without some 
Republican cover. This would ordi-
narily mean using the standard 60-vote 
process, but that is not how it hap-
pened. Instead of Democrats and Re-
publicans working together to find con-
sensus on the appropriate way to raise 
the debt ceiling, likely in exchange for 
spending reforms, some combination of 
Senate and House leadership concocted 
a new mechanism. 
On a 60-vote bill, Republicans agreed 
to let Democrats pass an entirely sepa-
rate bill to raise the debt ceiling— 
without 
any 
Republican 
votes—by 
whatever amount they want. So, rather 
than negotiating a reasonable number, 
Republicans agreed to ensure that the 
debt ceiling was increased by as many 
trillions of dollars as the Democrats 
might need to fulfill their agenda. 
There is an actual blank space in the 
bill where Democrats can write in 
whatever number they want. 
In exchange, Republicans would be 
protected from scrutiny for insisting 
that Democrats follow the established 
rules for raising the debt ceiling 
through the reconciliation procedure 
and would be able to launder this vote 
to appear as something other than 
helping Democrats raise the debt ceil-
ing, which they had publicly com-
mitted—in writing, no less—not to do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9136 
December 14, 2021 
To make matters worse, congres-
sional leadership tied this to a bill pre-
venting automatic Medicare cuts. This 
sent a clear message: Give Democrats a 
blank check or there would be Medi-
care cuts. Some of my Republican col-
leagues couldn’t allow them to shoot 
that hostage, that hostage being held 
captive by Democrats. 
The playbook is written. The idea 
that this is a onetime thing or is some-
how similar to other expedited proce-
dures—for example, those found under 
the Congressional Review Act to dis-
approve of executive Agency rules—is 
preposterous. The comparison doesn’t 
work. These are very different crea-
tures. I am sure this vicious tactic, the 
one used here, has not seen its last 
use—far from it. I am certain it will be 
used in the future to enact other pro-
gressive agenda items, including many 
that are simply unable to garner the 60 
votes necessary under the normal and 
transparent Senate filibuster rules. 
With a blank check and a new special 
procedure, Democrats are able to raise 
the debt ceiling by whatever amount 
they deem necessary to accommodate 
their ‘‘Destroy America’’ bill, which 
they call Build Back Better. They have 
set that price—and we know this now 
as of just the last few hours—at $2.5 
trillion. This is the behemoth bill that 
would seek to grant a form of amnesty 
to illegal aliens; to further the Green 
New Deal agenda; to overturn State 
right-to-work laws; to increase vaccine 
mandate fines on private employers to 
$700,000; to infuse critical race theory 
indoctrination into medical care; and 
to grow the IRS by 87,000 agents. That 
isn’t even the tip of the iceberg. 
The blank check to remake America 
was a gift to progressives from those 
within the Republican Party who de-
cided to grant it. I regret deeply their 
decision to do so, and the filibuster— 
the major instrument of power pre-
serving the unique identity of the U.S. 
Senate—was all it cost. 
As to who was the old woman and 
who were the mocking children from 
Toni Morrison’s story, I can’t say, but 
America is the bird. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFLATION 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, on 
Friday, the Department of Labor re-
ported that inflation had hit a near-40- 
year 
high, 
confirming 
what 
many 
American families have been feeling in 
their wallets for many months. 
The soaring cost of virtually every-
thing, from gasoline to groceries, is a 
growing crisis that has hit families 
across our Nation. The numbers are 
alarming. 
During the past year, the Consumer 
Price Index, which measures the price 
of goods and services, jumped by nearly 
7 percent. That is the highest rate 
since 1982. It represents the sixth con-
secutive month of inflation exceeding 5 
percent. 
The goods experiencing the greatest 
increases read like a list of everyday 
essentials. Energy costs are up by 33 
percent. Used vehicles are up by 31 per-
cent. Hamburger costs are up by 14 per-
cent. Milk, eggs, baby food, furniture, 
and many other necessities all cost 
more, and those prices are simply 
unsustainable for many working fami-
lies. 
The pain is being felt across the Na-
tion, including in my State of Maine. I 
have heard from many Mainers worried 
about how they will be able to afford to 
heat their homes this winter. The aver-
age price of heating oil in Maine is cur-
rently $3.15 per gallon, compared to 
$2.11 per gallon this time last year. 
While the amount of heating oil a 
household uses varies considerably, a 
typical Maine family will spend nearly 
$1,000 more this year on home heating 
oil. The State of Maine is dispropor-
tionately affected by this rise in costs 
since more than 60 percent of our 
homes use fuel oil as their primary en-
ergy source for heating compared to 
only 4 percent of households nation-
ally. 
The rise in the price of heating oil is 
not the only hardship that Mainers are 
facing this winter. Mainers have shared 
with me their genuine concerns about 
being able to afford to drive back and 
forth to work and to put nutritious 
food on the table. Gas prices in Maine 
are about $1.30 per gallon higher than 
last year. 
Business owners face the often im-
possible challenge of paying higher 
prices for commodities, food, and sup-
plies without passing those increases 
on to their already struggling con-
sumers. For example, Maine restaurant 
owners, who have already experienced 
an extraordinarily difficult 18 months 
due to the pandemic, are now grappling 
with double-digit percentage increases 
in the costs of ingredients and other 
goods needed to run their businesses. 
An owner of a restaurant I visited in 
Searsport told me that the cost of fryer 
grease has skyrocketed from $19 to $48 
per case. Another restaurant owner in 
Rockland recently told the Bangor 
Daily News that the price for prime 
ribs has more than doubled from $7 to 
$17. These supply costs shrink their al-
ready slim margins and exacerbate 
other difficulties the industry is facing 
with staffing shortages and pandemic- 
related closures. 
After a tough 2020 caused by COVID- 
related 
market 
disruptions 
and 
drought, Maine’s resilient potato grow-
ers rebounded with yields up 20 percent 
over last year. Such a strong harvest 
usually would be cause for celebration, 
but farmers are facing rising transpor-
tation, fuel, and fertilizer costs that 
are hurting their bottom line and forc-
ing them to pass on some of the infla-
tionary costs to their customers. The 
increased costs of doing business mean 
that families and processors will pay 
more for potatoes and growers will get 
a lower return on their crop. 
This weekend, the Wall Street Jour-
nal reported on how inflation is harm-
ing the employees at the One Stop 
Tulsa gas station in Aroostook County 
in Northern Maine. One clerk was 
working 60 hours each week—up from 
40 before the pandemic—because they 
are so shortstaffed. Even with the in-
creased hours, she said she is strug-
gling with rising costs, from food to 
electricity. 
Melissa Holmes, the gas station man-
ager, said that her twice monthly gro-
cery bill has increased from $300 to $500 
and it now costs her $60 to fill up her 
2011 Ford Explorer. That is $20 more 
than last year. 
Ms. Holmes also described facing cus-
tomers who are frustrated by the high-
er prices. The cost of chicken, for ex-
ample, has gone up so an order of 
chicken tenders has jumped from $5.49 
to $8.99. That is a big increase, and cus-
tomers are feeling that squeeze. 
After passage of the President’s $1.9 
trillion stimulus this spring, the price 
of goods and services went up. We 
heard reassurances from the Presi-
dent’s team that this inflation was 
transitory but no acknowledgement of 
the role that their policies have had on 
soaring prices. Americans are feeling 
the consequences as Washington has 
overheated the economy. 
We in Congress must confront this 
inflation crisis, but instead the Biden 
administration is pushing trillions in 
additional macroeconomic stimulus in 
the President’s Build Back Better plan. 
The consequences for an already over-
heated economy could be devastating. 
Given the clear link between recent ex-
traordinary government spending and 
rampant inflation, we should not be 
adding more fuel to the fire. Our econ-
omy is ailing so it would be wise to 
begin to follow the maxim that guides 
medical professionals: First, do no 
harm. 
Democrats 
have 
said 
that 
their 
spending spree, which follows the Build 
Back Better plan, would cost $1.7 tril-
lion. Several of the proposals in that 
plan would be set to expire after 1, 3, or 
5 years—a gimmick that hides the true 
cost because we know that is not what 
the real hope is nor what is going to 
happen. 
Last week, the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office projected that 
making the social spending programs 
in the Build Back Better plan perma-
nent would, in fact, cost $4.9 trillion 
over the decade—$4.9 trillion. Doing so 
would add $3 trillion to the deficit un-
less paid for with even more taxes be-
yond those that the Democrats have al-
ready proposed in their bill. That is 
much higher than the purported $1.7 
trillion pricetag because we know that 
the ultimate goal is to make these ex-
pensive programs permanent.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9137 
December 14, 2021 
Inflation is a regressive tax. It does 
not discriminate among the rich and 
the poor. It does not take into account 
the ability to pay. It is a cruel tax, one 
that punishes thrift by diminishing the 
value of savings. This is damaging to 
families who are saving to buy a home 
or for their children’s education. It can 
be devastating to our seniors, who can 
do nothing but helplessly watch as the 
retirement 
funds 
that 
they 
have 
worked for their whole lives don’t go 
nearly as far as they had expected. 
Like the pandemic itself, we do not 
know for certain whether this inflation 
crisis will abate, be prolonged, or even 
accelerate. Our immediate focus should 
be on measures that we know will have 
a lasting and beneficial impact on our 
economy, such as implementing the bi-
partisan infrastructure law, opening up 
and repairing our supply chains, get-
ting more Americans back to work, 
and protecting the earnings of hard- 
working Americans. 
What we should not do is pass tril-
lions of dollars in additional spending 
in the administration’s Build Back 
Better bill that would exacerbate the 
toll that inflation imposes on seniors, 
working families, and small businesses. 
We should not take that risk. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. WARNOCK. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today after a long 
week of wrestling with my conscience. 
Before we left Washington last week, 
we in this Chamber made a change in 
the Senate’s rules in order to push for-
ward something that all of us think is 
important. We set the stage to raise 
the Nation’s debt ceiling. 
Yet as we cast that vote to begin ad-
dressing the debt ceiling, this same 
Chamber is allowing the ceiling of our 
democracy to crash in around us. The 
American people have been pushing for 
leaders in Washington to address vot-
ing rights. 
Everywhere I turn, I have been hear-
ing from my constituents in Georgia. 
They are deeply worried. I heard it all 
weekend. I have been hearing it over 
the last several months. 
And I submit that they are worried 
for good reason. They know their his-
tory. They are witnessing what is hap-
pening to our democracy in real time, 
and they see the handwriting on the 
wall. They see the sweeping voter sup-
pression proposals in 49 States and the 
dozens of new laws that have now 
popped up across the Nation, fueled by 
the Big Lie that seeks to delegitimize 
the voices of millions of Georgians and 
Americans 
who 
made 
their 
voices 
heard, made history, and, more impor-
tantly, made a difference last Novem-
ber and last January. 
The American people see what is hap-
pening in Arizona and in Texas and in 
Florida and in Wisconsin and in Iowa. 
They see what is happening in Georgia, 
my home State, where a new law, SB 
202—passed right after I won—will 
make it harder for some voters to ac-
cess their ballots by making it more 
difficult to vote by mail, allowing far 
fewer drop boxes, and only allowing for 
the use of those boxes—listen—during 
business hours. You can use the drop 
boxes during business hours, which sort 
of defeats the purpose of having a drop 
box. In fact, back home, the second 
most senior Republican in the Georgia 
State Senate announced recently that 
he wants to do away with election drop 
boxes altogether—literal boxes where 
registered, eligible voters simply can 
drop off their ballots on their way to 
the night shift or on their way back 
home. It seems to me that they want 
fewer voters and more dark money in 
our elections, and that is the sad place 
we are in right now. 
But what is even more disconcerting 
is that these politicians in the State 
legislature have already laid the tracks 
to take over local boards of elections, 
for almost any frivolous reason, to un-
dermine the voices of local voters and 
local election administrators, control 
the count, muddy the waters, question 
or determine the outcome. 
In the face of this crisis, the question 
is this: Has this Chamber risen to the 
occasion to take on the issue of voting 
rights, which I submit is the central 
moral issue confronting this Congress 
in this moment? What have we done to 
strengthen access to the ballot as bed-
rock voting rights protections have 
been shredded by our courts or to pro-
tect the sacred right to vote as par-
tisan State legislatures have passed 
laws to dilute that right for so many 
people? 
Well, some of us have acted. Demo-
crats in this body have tried not once, 
not twice, but we have tried this Con-
gress on three occasions to consider 
legislation to protect and expand vot-
ing rights so that more eligible Ameri-
cans can make their voices heard and 
help shape the direction of our coun-
try. Each time—whether it was the For 
the People Act or the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act or the 
Freedom to Vote Act—with just one 
lone exception, all of our friends across 
the aisle have refused to engage with 
us in any way to address the growing 
barriers to what is basic to American 
democracy: the ballot box. 
Here is what we have said. We have 
said to our Republican friends: If you 
don’t like this provision or that provi-
sion, let’s talk about it. Offer some 
amendments. Come, let us reason to-
gether. Let us have a debate out in the 
open so that the American people can 
hear it. 
Everybody talks about the divisions 
in America right now. Here is what 
folks on the left and the right agree on: 
There is something awry in our democ-
racy. In this moment in which there is 
this debate happening on the outside, 
how is it that we refuse to even have a 
debate in the Senate? They don’t even 
want to have a debate. 
So here we are. Months have passed. 
No, that is not true—years have passed. 
Democrats have tried again and again 
to engage our Republican friends in a 
discussion on this issue—one that lies 
at the foundation of our democracy— 
and time and time again, because of a 
lack of good-faith engagement, the 
rules of the Senate have prevented us 
from moving that conversation for-
ward. 
We could not imagine changing the 
rules—that is, until last week, because 
last week, we did exactly that. Be very 
clear. Last week, we changed the rules 
of the Senate to address another im-
portant issue: the economy. This is a 
step—a change in the Senate rules—we 
haven’t been willing to take to save 
our broken democracy but one that a 
bipartisan majority of this Chamber 
thought was necessary in order to keep 
our economy strong. We changed the 
rules to protect the full faith and cred-
it of the U.S. Government. We have de-
cided we must do it for the economy 
but not for the democracy. 
I will be honest. This has been a dif-
ficult week for me as I pondered how 
am I going to vote on this debt ceiling 
question we are about to take. I feel 
like I am being asked to take a road 
that is a point of moral dissonance for 
me because while I deeply believe that 
both our democracy and our economy 
are important, I believe that it is mis-
placed to change the Senate rules only 
for the benefit of the economy when 
the warning lights on our democracy 
are flashing at the same time. 
I happen to believe that our democ-
racy is at least as important as the 
economy. Ours is a great nation built 
upon both free enterprise and free exer-
cise of basic democratic rights. You 
cannot have good capitalism without 
freedom. Each is strengthened by the 
other, and together they make for a 
nation that is both prosperous and free, 
a nation where everybody can breathe 
and every child has a chance to live up 
to her highest potential. 
So I stand here because of my chil-
dren. I have two precious children, and 
I think every day what kind of country 
I want them to grow up in. I stand here 
today because we are in a place where 
we are dealing with the consequence of 
misaligned values and misplaced prior-
ities, and that is, for me, a serious 
problem because I lead Ebenezer Bap-
tist Church, where John Lewis wor-
shipped and where Dr. King preached. I 
asked myself all weekend as I wrestled 
with how I would vote—I asked myself, 
what would Dr. King do? 
I thought this week about Dr. King’s 
speech in front of the Lincoln Memo-
rial—no, not the 1963 ‘‘I Have a Dream’’ 
speech but the one he gave the first 
time he spoke in front of the Lincoln 
Memorial in 1957, where he addressed

what he called ‘‘all types of conniving 
methods’’ that were getting in the way 
of the free exercise of the constitu-
tional right to vote. His rallying cry 
that day in 1957 was ‘‘Give Us the Bal-
lot.’’ 
In light of the conniving methods of 
voter suppression we have seen enacted 
into law since the January 6 attack on 
the Capitol, I come to the floor today 
to share with the people of Georgia and 
the American people the message that 
I shared with my colleagues over the 
weekend and earlier today during our 
caucus meeting. 
I said to my Democratic colleagues 
over the last several days—No. 1—un-
fortunately, the vast majority of our 
Republican friends have made it clear 
that they have no intention of trying 
to work with us to address voter sup-
pression or to protect voting rights. 
They have embodied by their actions 
the sentiments of conservative strate-
gist Paul Weyrich, who dared say in 
1981: ‘‘I don’t want everybody to vote.’’ 
That is what he said. ‘‘Elections are 
not won by a majority of the people. 
They never have been from the begin-
ning of our country and they are not 
now. As a matter of fact,’’ he went on 
to say, ‘‘our leverage in the elections 
quite candidly goes up as the voting 
populace goes down.’’ 
The second thing I said to my Demo-
cratic colleagues today is that while 
we cannot let our Republican friends 
off the hook for not being equitable 
governing partners, if we are serious 
about protecting the right to vote that 
is under assault right now, here is the 
truth: It will fall to Democrats to do it. 
If Democrats alone must raise the debt 
ceiling, then Democrats alone must 
raise and repair the ceiling of our de-
mocracy. How do we in good conscience 
justify doing one and not the other? 
Some of my Democratic colleagues 
are saying: But what about bipartisan-
ship? Isn’t that important? 
I say: Of course it is, but here is the 
thing we must remember. Slavery was 
bipartisan. Jim Crow’s segregation was 
bipartisan. The refusal of women’s suf-
frage was bipartisan. The denial of the 
basic dignity of members of the LGBTQ 
community has long been bipartisan. 
The Three-fifths Compromise was the 
creation of a putative national unity at 
the expense of Black people’s basic hu-
manity. 
So when colleagues in this Chamber 
talk to me about bipartisanship, which 
I believe in, I just have to ask, at 
whose expense? Who is being asked to 
foot the bill for this bipartisanship, 
and is liberty itself the cost? I submit 
that is a price too high and a bridge 
too far. 
So I struggled this weekend. I talked 
to folk I believe in. Among them, I 
spoke with Reverend Ambassador An-
drew Young, who was with Dr. King 
until the very end, about this vote. I 
talked to Ambassador Young, and I 
asked him: What do you think? 
He said: I try not to worry, but I am 
worried about our country. 
Then this 89-year-old, battle-worn 
soldier in the nonviolent army of the 
Lord drew silent on the phone, and 
then he said to me: Tell your col-
leagues that among your constituent 
are people who literally laid their lives 
on the line for the basic right to vote. 
They lost friends. They lost so much. 
And so this is a real moral quandary 
for me, and it makes it difficult for me 
to cast this vote today. But after many 
conversations with colleagues, with 
Georgians, with experts who know the 
economy, with voting rights advocates, 
and civil rights leaders, I will, indeed, 
vote today with anguish. I will vote to 
raise the debt ceiling. 
I am voting yes because I am think-
ing about the kids in the Kayton 
Homes Housing Projects where I grew 
up in Savannah, GA. I am thinking 
about the hard-working families push-
ing to recover from the pressures of 
this pandemic, those on the margins 
and those who are least resilient, for 
whom a collapse of the economy would 
be catastrophic. Ironically, many of 
these are the same people who are also 
being targeted by the voter suppression 
efforts I mentioned earlier. I am think-
ing of them and the people of Georgia 
as I cast my vote today to raise the 
debt ceiling. 
But I am also thinking about what 
we need to do to keep our democracy 
and our economy strong today and for 
the next generation. Once we handle 
the debt ceiling, the Senate needs to 
make voting rights the very next issue 
we take up. We must do voting rights, 
and we must deal with this issue now. 
Let me be clear. I am so proud of 
what we did with the bipartisan infra-
structure bill and the major economic 
investments we are putting the fin-
ishing touches on that will close the 
Medicaid coverage gap and deliver his-
toric relief for Georgia farmers and ex-
pand broadband access and so much 
more. 
I have to tell you that the most im-
portant thing that we can do in this 
Congress is to get voting rights done. 
Voting rights are preservative of all 
other rights. They lay the ground for 
all of the other debates. 
So to my Democratic colleagues, I 
say, while it is deeply unfortunate, it is 
more than apparent that it has been 
left to us to handle alone the task of 
safeguarding our democracy. Sadly, 
many of our Republican friends have 
already cast their vote with voter sup-
pression. 
So the judgment of history is upon 
us. Future generations will ask when 
the democracy was in a 9–1-1 state of 
emergency, what did you do to put the 
fire out? Did we rise to the moment or 
did we hide behind procedural rules? I 
believe that we Democrats can figure 
out how to get this done, even if that 
requires a change in the rules, which 
we established just last week that we 
can do when the issue is important 
enough. 
Well, the people of Georgia and 
across the country are saying that vot-
ing rights are important enough. I 
think that voting rights are important 
enough so we cannot delay. We must 
continue to urge the party of Lincoln 
not to give into the very forces of voter 
suppression that Dr. King described in 
that 1957 speech while standing in the 
shadow of Lincoln. But even as we do 
that, we cannot wait. We cannot wait 
on them. With uncanny and eerie rel-
evance, Dr. King’s words summon us to 
this very moment. He said: 
The hour is late. The clock of destiny is 
ticking out. We must act now before it is too 
late. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I 
learned a long time ago, I never want 
to give a speech after that, but cer-
tainly I agree with what Senator 
WARNOCK said, and the Senate schedule 
kind of made me do this. 
I want to thank Senator WARNOCK, 
who is one of the principals in our leg-
islation, 
Senator 
BENNET, 
Senator 
BOOKER, and Senator KAINE for their 
leadership and their work to deliver 
what is, pure and simple, the largest 
tax cut for working families ever. 
Tomorrow, for the sixth month in a 
row—July 15, August 15, September, 
October, November. Tomorrow is the 
sixth month in a row that Ohio par-
ents, 92 percent of parents in Ohio with 
children under 18, will again see $250 or 
$300 in their bank accounts or in their 
mailbox per child. If they have two in-
fant children, they will get $600. 
This is the most consequential thing 
we have done in decades to make peo-
ple’s hard work pay off. We know how 
hard parents work at their jobs, at 
raising kids. Any parent knows how 
much work it is to take care of chil-
dren, especially young children. It has 
only gotten harder over the last couple 
of years. Often, that hard work doesn’t 
pay off like it should. We have seen 
what has happened over the past dec-
ades. Productivity has gone up; the 
stock market has soared; executive 
compensation 
is 
stratospheric; 
but 
wages have been flat. 
Workers’ paychecks are finally—fi-
nally, during this administration and 
this Senate, this Congress—finally, be-
cause of the work we are doing, work-
ers’ paychecks are starting to go up. 
But after decades of stagnation, we 
have a long way to go. 
Meanwhile, parents know how expen-
sive it is to raise kids. Healthcare, 
school lunches, diapers, clothes, school 
supplies, braces, sports fees, camp 
fees—the list never seems to end. 
Of course, one of the biggest, if not 
the biggest expense for so many fami-
lies is childcare. Parents feel like they 
are trapped. They can’t keep up no 
matter how hard they work. They work 
more hours to provide for their family. 
They have to put their money right 
back into childcare. Sometimes the 
extra money in their paycheck doesn’t 
even cover the extra daycare costs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9139 
December 14, 2021 
That is why Senators BOOKER and 
KAINE
and 
BENNET
and 
WARNOCK 
worked so hard to enact the child tax 
credit. As I said, the largest—it is a 
$3,000 tax cut so 92 percent of the fami-
lies in my State with children get at 
least a $3,000 tax cut. It is the same in 
Virginia, same in New Jersey, the same 
in Georgia. It is about finally—fi-
nally—making parents’ hard work pay 
off so they can keep up with the costs 
of raising a family. 
I was talking to Senator KAINE, and I 
know he is going to say some of the 
same things. Let me share a handful of 
some really quick stories or comments 
that people have gone on our website 
and posted at the 15th of the month. 
Kristen from Columbus says she is 
using this money to pay for ‘‘daycare. 
For two kids it is $600 a week.’’ 
Alex in Cleveland: 
Every penny is going to daycare. 4 kids in 
daycare is around $800/week. 
CeCe said her tax cut helps her pay 
for daycare. She said: 
Daycare is the same amount as my mort-
gage payment for 4 days a week! So this is 
so, so helpful! 
Courtney from Southeast Ohio in 
Athens: 
[S]lightly more than half the cost of part 
time daycare tuition per month here in Ath-
ens—much appreciated help getting kiddo 
back into childcare . . . keeping me and my 
husband in the workforce. 
Brittany said: 
Daycare. 
Ellie said: 
Daycare. 
They also mean parents can afford to 
work and can afford to keep up with all 
the extra costs of raising kids. 
Katie in Akron: 
Help[s] [to] pay for school supplies. 
Caitlin: 
Pay for preschool for my son. 
Lyndsay: 
Back to school clothes. 
Fern: 
It will pay for preschool for both of them 
and the rest is going in a savings account for 
them. 
Jennifer: 
Put away for college tuition. 
Melissa: 
I used part of it to buy school uniform 
pieces for my 4-year-old. 
Maia: 
Food and school supplies. 
These parents are all working hard to 
provide for their families and raise 
their kids. They are working a whole 
lot harder than the CEOs and the hedge 
fund managers who it looks like, under 
Build Back Better, may continue to get 
some of their tax cuts—their tax pref-
erence, if you will. It is a lot harder for 
these workers than the CEOs and the 
hedge fund managers and the Swiss 
bank account holders who are always 
getting tax cuts from politicians in 
this building. 
We all remember what happened. We 
can look down the hall. We have done 
that before and seen the lobbyists line 
up in front of Leader MCCONNELL’s of-
fice and line up in front of the politi-
cians who always do their bidding with 
their tax cuts for the wealthy and for 
corporations that outsource jobs. You 
know what they told us 4 years ago, 
when those tax cuts for the rich passed. 
They said: It is going to trickle down 
and help everybody else. We will hire 
more people, raise wages. 
Of course, corporations didn’t spend 
the money to raise wages. Of course, 
they didn’t spend the money to lower 
prices. And then they blame everybody 
else for inflation. Of course, they spent 
it—no 
surprise 
here—with 
stock 
buybacks, and they are still at it 
today. 
This year, without a single vote, not 
a single vote from Republicans in Con-
gress—twice, every Democrat voting 
for it, a 51-to-50 vote—twice we passed 
the child tax credit. It is a simple con-
trast: Whose side are you on? Do you 
want tax cuts for billionaires and cor-
porations or tax cuts for working fami-
lies? 
We want tax cuts for working fami-
lies, Americans from all over the coun-
try, from all kinds of backgrounds. 
Let’s deliver that for them. Let’s keep 
the largest tax cut for working families 
ever so that parents can have that 
peace of mind, can relieve some of 
their anxiety they face every month to 
pay the rent and pay the bills. They 
can have the peace of mind that the 
child tax credit will keep delivering 
money in their pockets through the 
holidays this year, into next year, into 
next year’s holiday. 
I yield the floor to Senator BOOKER. 
Mr. BOOKER. It is frustrating, I 
know, to see such an incredible action 
taken, where we have made a dif-
ference, where the child tax credit al-
ready has had a significant impact. The 
Columbia Center on Poverty found that 
the October payment of the expanded 
child tax credit helped ensure 3.6 mil-
lion American children—3.6 million 
American children—are no longer liv-
ing below the poverty line. 
What does that mean? When a child 
is raised above the poverty line, their 
horizons are transformed. It actually 
saves an incredible amount of taxpayer 
dollars. For every dollar we spend 
bringing a child above the poverty line, 
we return $7 back to our economy. 
But it is deeper than that. There is a 
moral urgency. Children below the pov-
erty line have so many more chal-
lenges. Their horizons are constrained, 
their life outcomes are lessened. 
Above the poverty line, our children 
start to exhibit their genius. Children 
raised above the poverty line have 
higher lifetime earnings. They have 
lower medical costs. Children above 
the poverty line are less likely to go to 
the hospital, less likely to get in trou-
ble with the police. Children above the 
poverty line have less inhibitions with 
their contributions to this country. 
I, too, like my dear friend Senator 
BROWN, have heard lots from people in 
my State about what this little bit of 
money in their bank accounts—how 
that little bit of investment makes a 
transformation in the lives of those 
families. 
Take Kelly in Pitman, NJ. She was 
forced to quit her job when her chil-
dren’s school and daycare closed due to 
the pandemic. She hasn’t been able to 
return 
to 
work 
without 
reliable 
childcare, and the child tax credit is 
helping her family. It is helping to 
make up costs that were lost when she 
lost her income. It is helping her pro-
vide for her children. It is that little 
bit of help by returning those tax dol-
lars which she has paid in—she is get-
ting more out now—and helping that 
family. 
Take Stacey in Kearny, NJ, the child 
tax credit payments were a lifeline and 
helped her and her husband keep their 
family afloat during this pandemic, 
during this crisis. She was indefinitely 
furloughed, and Stacey used those pay-
ments to send her two daughters back 
to preschool. 
Well, we know the evidence is in. 
Sending her two daughters back to pre-
school means her children will do bet-
ter in school, are more likely to go to 
college, have higher lifetime earnings, 
more success that inures to the benefit 
of us all in society. 
Senator after Senator, on both sides 
of the aisle, has thousands of these sto-
ries about what getting more of their 
hard-earned tax money back means. In 
a nation where we have seen the tax 
cuts of the last decade inure over-
whelmingly to the richest of the rich, 
this was the first tax cut in my life-
time—the biggest of the tax cuts in my 
lifetime that went overwhelmingly to 
middle-class 
families, 
working-class 
families, low-income families. 
And now it sits on a precipice. As 
many people are aware, tomorrow is 
the last day that these payments are 
scheduled to go out to families like 
Kelly’s and families like Stacy’s and 
millions of families across this coun-
try. 
The changes we made to the child tax 
credit will expire. Struggling Ameri-
cans, working Americans, middle-class 
Americans will not receive that pay-
ment in January, unless this body acts. 
To prevent this from happening, to 
make sure families continue to get 
more of their tax dollars back and have 
greater security, hope in challenging 
times, Congress can pass the Build 
Back Better Act, which includes the 
extension of the child tax credit pay-
ments, which are lowering costs for 
American middle-class, working-class, 
and low-income families. 
Now, I know there is concern being 
raised about the Build Back Better leg-
islation today, but I urge my col-
leagues to understand the high cost of 
inaction. 
First and foremost, letting this pro-
gram expire will raise costs for fami-
lies at the very worst time. With the 
cost of gas and groceries going up, a 
tax increase, which is effectively what

this would be, would mean millions of 
families in difficult times would have 
it be harder to make ends meet, to 
make those kitchen table economics 
work out. 
It will add burdens to people at a 
time we should be lifting them, at a 
time that we should be providing relief. 
And, again, it is not just working-class 
families, middle-class families. It is 
children living in that moral obscenity, 
that dark place within our society that 
is termed ‘‘child poverty’’. 
The cost of inaction for all of those 
children, the cost to our society overall 
of having children grow up in poverty 
is $1.1 trillion—$1.1 trillion. That is 
what poverty costs. 
But there is a moral cost that is 
greater than that. There is a moral ob-
scenity that we are experiencing right 
now, a stain on the soul of our Nation 
that we have without this tax credit— 
the highest child poverty rates of all of 
our industrial peers. 
This is a moral moment in America. 
Our inaction will plunge our Nation 
back with millions of families facing 
crisis. We have seen this body act in 
difficult times before. We have seen us 
invest in people. We have seen us stand 
up for children. My worry now is that 
tomorrow will be the last day, unless 
we stand up and act. 
I join my colleagues Senator BROWN, 
Senator BENNET, and I join my col-
leagues 
Senator 
KAINE, 
Senator 
WARNOCK in calling us to meet this mo-
ment, to meet the moral urgency of 
now, and to please make sure that be-
fore this body leaves for the holidays, 
that for those families who are in 
stress and economic strain, those fami-
lies who are worrying about what will 
happen next month, that we show them 
that we care, that we show them that 
we are fiscally prudent, and we make 
the best investment possible in Amer-
ica. It is not a stock or a bond. The 
best investment we can make is mak-
ing sure the child tax credit continues 
because it is an investment in our chil-
dren. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I am 
honored to join my colleagues today to 
speak about the child tax credit and to 
do something similar to what they 
have done and just make it personal to 
families. 
Tomorrow, on the 15th of December, 
more than 930,000 Virginia families, 
who together have 1.6 million kids, will 
receive a child tax cut payment—$300 
for a child under age 6 and $250 for each 
child between ages 6 and 17. Those are 
big numbers. Those are big numbers— 
1.6 million children; 930,000 families. 
And I am here joining my colleagues 
to ask that this payment to parents— 
this parents’ tax cut—to help their 
children is not the last, because unless 
we act, the sixth payment that will go 
out tomorrow will be the last. 
Now, the numbers are big, but some-
times the numbers can obscure—data 
and statistics can obscure—what is 
really at stake. So just a week ago, I 
put up on my Senate web page a ques-
tion: What has this tax cut meant to 
your family? 
In 1 week we have received more than 
200 responses, and I just want to share 
a few with you. 
Heather, from Glenn Allen, is a full- 
time caretaker of her physically dis-
abled daughter. Her daughter started 
having trouble with the stairs in her 
home. So they used the child tax cut 
payment to help them buy a new stair 
lift so her daughter is still able to navi-
gate the home. 
Heather wrote this to me: 
My family deeply appreciates the child tax 
credit because we routinely incur additional 
expenses while caring for a loved one with a 
disability. I take care of our daughter full 
time, which makes us a one-income house-
hold, so the tax credit helped make a dif-
ference. 
Beatrice from Rockingham, in the 
Shenandoah Valley, works at Cooks 
Creek Presbyterian Church, and she 
sees how the child tax cuts have af-
fected families they work with. One 
mother of six, whose husband is incar-
cerated, relies on the payments to help 
with her child’s medical expenses. An-
other couple that comes to this church, 
who are in their sixties, are raising 
their great-nephew because his mother 
suffers from addiction. The tax cut is 
helping them cover necessities for this 
great-nephew. 
Lawanda—I 
have 
a 
picture 
of 
Lawanda and her family. She is a sin-
gle mom from South Boston, down on 
the North Carolina border. Lawanda 
sent me this picture and said: Use this 
picture. She used the payments to help 
buy clothes and shoes for her children 
and to buy fresh fruit and vegetables, 
which they usually can’t afford. 
I love this picture because this is a 
picture of people with smiles. These are 
resilient people, who dream of a better 
future, and this child tax cut is helping 
them achieve at something as simple 
as being able to buy fresh vegetables 
rather than canned, or shoes. Some-
thing as simple as that is what this 
child tax cut is about. 
A Virginian from Lynchburg wrote 
that the tax cut has helped buy healthy 
food, clothing, and shoes. And then she 
said this: 
Children grow so fast now and eat more, 
which causes many trips to the grocery 
store. We are senior citizen, retired grand-
parents with legal guardianship of our grand-
daughter. With this being the last payment 
in December, which would be used partly for 
Christmas gifts for her, we will [really] have 
to stretch this. 
Grandparents—grandparents 
raising 
their granddaughter and finding in this 
tax cut the ability to afford Christmas 
gifts. 
Nicole from Leesburg is using the tax 
cut for therapy for her autistic son be-
cause insurance no longer covers it. 
In another picture is Sasha from 
Midlothian, which is right outside of 
Richmond. Sasha wrote to me and said 
this—and this is Sasha and her young 
one: 
My husband and I both have secure jobs, 
but the cost of full-time infant care is very 
high. We spend 23 percent of our combined 
monthly income on daycare for one child— 
our 1-year-old son. We also just paid off my 
student loans and are saving to buy our first 
house next year. The child tax credit has al-
lowed us to save more money for that house 
and to pay off debts. We would like to grow 
our family but worry about our financial 
burden. 
She also wrote: 
Thank you for working so hard to pass the 
Build Back Better bill. I am following it 
closely because it means so much to my fam-
ily’s future. 
From 
Alexandria, 
a 
constituent 
wrote: 
Before the pandemic, the high price of 
childcare made it difficult to balance my 
family’s budget. Each month we went into 
debt a little bit more. My husband is a full- 
time student, and I am the sole breadwinner. 
The child tax credit helped them 
start to pay down debt, to begin an 
emergency fund, and to start a college 
fund for their son. 
A resident from Waynesboro: 
I benefited tremendously with the child 
tax credit. I am a single parent in every as-
pect, raising two growing boys. It has helped 
me out with getting things they need for the 
school year. Also I saved some to be able to 
give them a good Christmas. 
Finally, Laquanda from Roanoke—all 
she said was this: 
Please fight for us. Please fight for us. 
I could go on for a long time with 
these messages, as could my col-
leagues, but I will stop there. I have 
read you stories from people who live 
in every region of Virginia. 
I want to thank my colleagues Sen-
ators 
BENNET, 
BROWN, 
BOOKER, 
WARNOCK, CORTEZ MASTO, and others 
for leading the charge on getting this 
policy into the American Rescue Plan 
earlier this year, and I want to thank 
all of my Democratic colleagues be-
cause this thing passed by one vote in 
March. If any of us had been absent, if 
any of us had lost our last race, the 
American Rescue Plan would have 
failed, and none of these families would 
have received the support of the child 
tax credit. 
Well, we are going to have that op-
portunity again, and, given the fact 
that one party has said they will not 
support this bill, it is on our shoulders. 
These families who are struggling and 
working so hard and who have hopes as 
high as any of our hopes, they need us. 
As Laquanda said, they need us to fight 
for them. 
Thank you to my colleagues for join-
ing in that. 
With that, I yield the floor but would 
defer to my colleague from Colorado. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, it is 
a wonderful moment to be here with 
my colleagues to acknowledge that in 
March we passed the biggest reduction 
in poverty in generations in our coun-
try. That was through the expansion of 
the child tax credit, which increased 
the credit, made it payable on a

December 14, 2021 
monthly basis, and, for the first time 
in American history, made it fully re-
fundable so the millions of children in 
this country who were too poor to get 
the benefit of the credit because their 
families were too poor would get the 
benefit of that credit. And we needed to 
do it. 
The United States, before we passed 
this, was 38th out of 41 industrialized 
countries in the world when it came to 
childhood poverty. The poorest genera-
tion in this country are our children, 
and I think what we said was that 
there is no reason for us to accept 
those outcomes or those numbers as a 
permanent feature of our economy or 
our democracy. And in the end, this 
isn’t about numbers. This is about chil-
dren all over our country and the fu-
ture of the United States of America. 
Childhood poverty costs this country 
a trillion dollars a year, and one of the 
things we decided was that maybe, in-
stead of paying for the effects of child-
hood poverty, we could actually begin 
to try to reduce the amount of child-
hood poverty that exists in our coun-
try, the way other countries around 
the world have already done it. 
Nationally, the child tax credit, as I 
say, is cutting childhood poverty in 
half. It is reducing hunger among fami-
lies by a quarter. Let that linger for a 
second. 
When was the last time we were able 
to come to the floor of the Senate and 
say we cut hunger in this country by a 
quarter? It has been generations since 
anybody has been able to say that on 
this floor. 
In Colorado, a million kids and their 
families are benefitting from this cred-
it. That is 90 percent of the kids in my 
State. It is 90 percent of the kids across 
the country. Parents in Colorado are 
getting an average of $240 a month to 
pay for groceries, to help with the rent, 
and, really importantly, to pay for a 
little extra childcare so people can 
stay at work. And I know that because 
of what parents have told me they are 
spending the money on. 
When we first passed this credit back 
in June—I think it was then that it 
first went into effect—July and Au-
gust, people were getting ready to go 
back to school, and I had mom after 
mom after mom across the State tell 
me how important it was that they 
were able to buy school clothes for 
their kids without bankrupting their 
family, for the first time. 
And, you know, all of this is the re-
flection of an economy that for 50 
years has worked extremely well for 
the top 10 percent of Americans and 
hasn’t really worked for anybody else, 
and where the families who come to see 
me in my townhall say: MICHAEL, we 
are working really hard, but no matter 
what we do, we can’t afford some com-
bination of housing, healthcare, higher 
education, early childhood education, 
if we can even find early childhood edu-
cation or daycare. 
We can’t save. We feel like our fami-
lies are going to live a more diminished 
life than we did and that our kids will 
as well. 
So I brought a few photos today to 
the floor to share some stories of Colo-
radans with all of you and my col-
leagues. 
This is April Pratt from El Paso 
County, and she lives there with her 
three daughters, who are ages 8, 21⁄2, 
and 11⁄2. 
When April was pregnant with her 
youngest daughter, her husband trag-
ically passed away. Now, she is the sole 
breadwinner for the family. And al-
though she works full-time at the local 
school, there is not much left after her 
mortgage, diapers, and groceries for 
three young kids. Let me just say that 
again. She works full-time. 
Before the Child Tax Credit, April 
said she ‘‘felt like I was having a lot of 
anxiety every month about whether I 
was going to be able to afford my bills. 
It was eating up a lot of my attention.’’ 
Thanks to the child tax credit, April 
can afford the $1,200 a month for 
childcare for her two youngest daugh-
ters so she can work—so she can work. 
She said, ‘‘If I wasn’t able to afford 
childcare, I’d have to quit my job.’’ 
Without the child tax credit, April 
said that she would be ‘‘forced to use 
my credit card to fill in the gaps, and 
that debt just accumulates and accu-
mulates, and that becomes crippling, 
and my family wouldn’t be able to get 
ahead.’’ She said it was ‘‘nice that our 
government is finally doing something 
to help working families and middle- 
class families.’’ 
Finally, after we have cut taxes for 
the wealthiest people in this country 
by more than $5 trillion since 2001, we 
finally have a tax cut for working fam-
ilies. We should be making it perma-
nent. 
This is Amberly Atencio, also from 
Colorado. She is here with her three 
girls that are ages 9, 12, and 14. When I 
got to this place, my daughters were 9, 
7, and 4, so I have some appreciation 
for what she has got on her hands. 
They lived their entire lives in Monte 
Vista, a small town in southwest Colo-
rado in the San Luis Valley. And for 
the past 3 years, Amberly has been 
working full-time and studying. And 
last week, she graduated with her sec-
ond associate’s degree. 
She works for a local health insur-
ance company. And before the child tax 
credit, her paycheck was the only 
source of income for her family. She 
said that knowing that monthly sup-
port comes on the same day each 
month helps her pay the rent and buy 
food. She said: ‘‘I’m a single parent. 
This is like heaven to me, knowing 
that I have that extra income to pro-
vide for my children. . . . It has helped 
so much.’’ 
Her daughters love sports—soccer, 
basketball, volleyball, and track. But 
between the shorts, knee pads, cleats, 
shin guards, and fees, it all adds up. 
And with the child tax credit, she has 
bought that equipment for her daugh-
ters so they can play sports with their 
friends, which means the world to 
them. 
I had a mom who told me that she 
had bought a bike for her son and he 
was able to take it to stay at school 
late to engage in afterschool activities 
he otherwise wouldn’t be able to do 
without that bike. 
And, finally, here is Ayesha Bogart 
from Colorado Springs. Here is another 
mom from the Springs with her three 
kids, aged 12, 13, and 23. Ayesha served 
for 16 years as a medic in the U.S. 
Army and U.S. Army Reserves. While 
she was on Active Duty, she was in-
jured during a training accident when 
her Humvee rolled over, and it left her 
with a traumatic brain injury. Now, 
she is a single mom supporting three 
kids all by herself. And before the child 
tax credit, she couldn’t afford to buy 
new shoes for her kids. 
She said there were days when they 
didn’t have shampoo at home and her 
kids 
would 
get 
teased 
at 
school. 
Thanks to the child tax credit, she 
bought her kids new pairs of shoes. She 
bought them school supplies so they 
feel like they are on a level playing 
field with the other children in their 
school. She said the child tax credit 
has given her ‘‘breathing room where 
there wasn’t any before.’’ 
I have heard stories like that all 
across the State of Colorado. This is 
not an anecdotal reflection of people 
not working hard. All of these people 
are working hard. It is hard work just 
to raise a child, much less do the kind 
of jobs these folks are doing. And the 
economy has worked really well for the 
top 10 percent, as I said, but hasn’t 
really worked for anybody else. 
And what has Washington’s response 
been time and time and time again? To 
come here and cut taxes for the richest 
people in America and ignore the needs 
of working people. That is what we 
have done since 2001, $8 trillion in tax 
cuts, almost all of which have gone to 
the wealthiest people in this country. 
And now, we have a tax cut for work-
ing people in an economy that has not 
lifted them up the way it has lifted the 
people at the very top. We are saying 
we don’t have to accept childhood pov-
erty as a permanent feature of our 
economy or our democracy. We don’t 
have to accept an economy where it 
only grows for the wealthiest Ameri-
cans. We don’t have to accept that Con-
gress is only paying attention to spe-
cial interests and to the wealthiest 
Americans. 
We can build an economy that in-
cludes everybody, that when it grows, 
everybody benefits from it because the 
whole society benefits from this as 
well. Childhood poverty costs this 
country $1 trillion a year. We can’t af-
ford not to do it, which is why so many 
other countries in the world have done 
this. 
We can create opportunity for every 
American family and give every child a 
chance to contribute to this economy 
and to our society. And I believe it is 
fundamentally important to strength-
ening our democracy, making sure we

December 14, 2021 
have got something we are proud of to 
turn over to the next generation of 
Americans. 
That is why it is critical for us to ex-
tend this child tax credit, to not allow 
it to lapse at the end of the year, and 
in my mind, make it permanent. I 
would argue that we cannot afford not 
to. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
like all Americans, Nevadans have 
been through a difficult 2 years. Our 
State was one of the hardest hit by the 
pandemic. Nevada relies on tourism 
and the travel industry, and with the 
country in lockdown, a huge propor-
tion of our families saw layoffs or fur-
loughs. In fact, we had one of the high-
est unemployment rates in the country 
at one time: 30 percent. 
For those families, the middle-class 
tax cuts we passed in the American 
Rescue Plan have been an incredible 
lifeline. Today, I am joining my col-
leagues to stand up for extending these 
tax cuts. It is so important that we get 
this done for people not only in the Sil-
ver State but across the country. 
In many cases, this is money that 
Nevadans have earned, and it really 
needs to go back into their pockets. We 
are talking about a tax cut that bene-
fits the vast majority of families in Ne-
vada. 
In July of this year, because of the 
American Rescue Plan, the child tax 
credit increased to $300 per month for 
children under 6 years of age and $250 a 
month for children between 6 and 17 
years of age. Working families with 
two young kids are receiving more 
than $500 a month back from the gov-
ernment to help them make ends meet, 
and it is making a tremendous dif-
ference. Over 594,000 children in Nevada 
and their families qualify for this 
money. 
I have heard story after story from 
people in the Silver State about the 
way the money is supporting their chil-
dren. Some families are using the 
money for rent, to make sure that 
their kids don’t suffer from housing in-
security. Others use it for clothes for 
their children or schoolbooks and other 
school supplies. 
Lori Munoz from Henderson, NV, told 
the Las Vegas Sun that she uses it for 
school lunches and other school ex-
penses. She said, ‘‘You always think, 
‘oh, it’s some extra money.’ It’s never 
extra money. . . . Kids always need, 
there’s always something that needs to 
be bought.’’ 
Many families use it just for food on 
the table. After those first payments 
were issued in July, the number of 
adults reporting that children in their 
households didn’t have enough to eat 
fell by one-third. 
And Jessie Cartinella from Reno told 
me that receiving the monthly pay-
ments let her stay afloat as a single 
mom on a teacher’s salary and kept her 
from running up credit card bills. She 
said, and I quote: ‘‘Thanks to the Ad-
vance Child Tax Credit, I’ve mostly 
avoided this and been able to pay bills 
and even enjoy special outings with my 
children. The Child Tax Credit encour-
ages my family to make better choices 
in general—affording me assistance 
with quality childcare, options for 
healthier products and food, and pro-
viding the opportunity to participate 
in extracurricular activities that I be-
lieve are critical to a kid’s social and 
physical development.’’ 
That was Jessie. And that is why it 
was so beneficial to her family and her 
children. 
Social interactions are so important 
for kids’ mental health as well, and we 
have known that throughout this pan-
demic. Treanna James, a single mom 
in Las Vegas, used her extra funds to 
take her two sons to visit an uncle and 
an aunt in northern California for the 
first time since the pandemic began. 
Because of underlying medical issues, 
they had to be very careful about trav-
el; but she said the child tax credit 
helped make it possible for them to 
spend 
time 
with 
family 
again 
at 
Thanksgiving. 
So these tax cuts have really been 
key for Nevada families. Now, they are 
set to expire at the end of 2021, but the 
budget proposal that we are consid-
ering extends them for 1 more year. 
Our hard-working families want us to 
keep this critical support going to 
them. This is not the time to make it 
harder for people to keep a roof over 
their heads or give their kids the essen-
tials they need. 
So let’s make sure Nevadans can 
keep that money that they have earned 
and extend these middle-class tax cuts 
to Nevadans and all families across the 
country. Let’s support the working 
people. Let’s support hard-working in-
dividuals every day and help them with 
their economic recovery.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9143 
December 14, 2021 
It is now December. It has been near-
ly four months since the disastrous 
withdrawal from Afghanistan. 
Thirteen servicemembers lost their 
lives in the attack on Abbey Gate 
along with hundreds of civilians. As a 
result of the botched evacuation oper-
ation, hundreds, if not thousands, of 
American civilians were left behind to 
the enemy. 
We hear from our friends on the 
other side of the aisle that my insist-
ence that we actually vote on nominees 
is unprecedented. I would humbly sug-
gest that the crisis into which this 
President has led this country is un-
precedented. In my lifetime, it is un-
precedented. 
It is unprecedented for an American 
President to watch 13 servicemembers 
lose their lives in an evacuation for 
which he is responsible and then to cel-
ebrate that operation as ‘‘an unquali-
fied success’’ or ‘‘an extraordinary suc-
cess.’’ I believe those were President 
Biden’s words. 
Really, an extraordinary success? 
Thirteen servicemembers dead, hun-
dreds of civilians dead, hundreds of 
Americans left behind to the enemy— 
that is success? No, that is a failure. 
That is unacceptable. 
And who has been held accountable 
for this disaster? No one. Who has the 
President fired? Who has offered their 
resignation? Which of the planners at 
the Department of State or the Depart-
ment of Defense or the National Secu-
rity Council has been relieved of duty? 
No one. 
Until there is accountability, I am 
going to ask that the Senate do the 
simple task of its job, which is to actu-
ally vote on these nominees. The least 
we could do is observe regular order 
and vote on these leadership positions 
at the Department of State and at the 
Department of Defense. 
My colleagues say that we have got 
to put national security first. I agree 
with them about that. But I believe 
that begins at the top, with the Presi-
dent of the United States and the lead-
ership of the Department of Defense 
and the Department of State. I, for 
one, am not going to stand by and look 
the other way while this administra-
tion systematically endangers our na-
tional security, imperils the American 
people, and watches the sacrifice of our 
soldiers go by without any account-
ability, without any change in direc-
tion. 
I am not willing to look the other 
way and just pretend that Afghanistan 
didn’t happen, which seems to be the 
posture that many in this body have 
adopted. I am not willing to do that. I 
can’t do that because I promised the 
parents of the fallen that I wouldn’t do 
that. 
I am going to discharge my responsi-
bility. And as long as it takes, I will 
continue to draw attention to what 
happened at Abbey Gate and to demand 
accountability for the disaster that 
this administration has pushed upon 
this country and upon the people of my 
State. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. KELLY. Mr. President, the Dep-
uty Under Secretary of Defense for Re-
search and Engineering is a critical po-
sition that helps lead and manage our 
military’s 
science 
and 
technology 
work. This includes work on disrup-
tive, cutting-edge technologies like 
quantum science, hypersonics, and ar-
tificial intelligence. Maintaining our 
competitive edge over China in these 
areas has been a focus of the Sub-
committee on Emerging Threats and 
Capabilities, which I chair, and I know 
that all of us—all of us—here under-
stand how important it is. 
We worked on a bipartisan basis to 
include investment and policy changes 
for these priorities in the NDAA that 
we are hoping to pass this week. The 
Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for 
Research and Engineering is tasked 
with carrying out many of these 
changes. Yet the nominee for this post 
has yet to be confirmed. 
Dr. David A. Honey is qualified. He 
brings decades of experience, including 
as an Air Force pilot, an intelligence 
officer, and in leadership roles at 
DARPA, the Office of the Secretary of 
Defense, and within the intelligence 
community. Reflecting his qualifica-
tions, Dr. Honey’s nomination has bi-
partisan support and was voice-voted 
out of the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee in October. 
At a time when our adversaries are 
investing heavily in an attempt to out-
pace the United States, we need all 
hands on deck and confirmed leader-
ship in this post, so I am very dis-
appointed that we could not do that 
today. This is a matter of national se-
curity. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
INFLATION 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, for 
months now, American families have 
struggled with the growing burden of 
inflation. New data shows just how bad 
things have gotten. 
Last month, consumer prices in-
creased at the fastest pace in 40 years. 
Now, I would like to take a little walk 
down memory lane. The last time the 
American people endured price spikes 
like this, ‘‘Eye of the Tiger’’ was one of 
the top songs on the radio. I am sure 
the Senator from Delaware remembers 
that very well. The world had yet to be 
introduced to Nintendo and Mario. 
Consumers were anxiously awaiting 
the release of the first cell phone, 
which weighed in at a whopping 2 
pounds. I remember those unwieldy 
telephones well. 
Over the last four decades, of course, 
a lot has changed, and I am not just 
talking about technology—the attacks 
of September 11, wars in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan, the great recession. 
Even during the first year of the pan-
demic, inflation didn’t come close to 
hitting the heights that it has today. 
Between March 2020 and February 2021, 
the inflation rate never topped 2 per-
cent. 
There were countless reasons for us 
to be optimistic. We had three highly 
effective vaccines, with shots going 
into the arms of millions of people 
every day. Schools were reopening. 
Employees were returning to work. 
The American people began to discover 
a new semblance of normal post- 
COVID. 
But the administration ignored all of 
this progress because they had another 
plan in mind. They seized on what one 
House Democrat described as a ‘‘tre-
mendous opportunity to restructure 
things to fit [their] vision.’’ They craft-
ed a nearly $2 trillion piece of legisla-
tion that included their ideological pri-
orities and tried to brand it as nec-
essary pandemic relief. But we know 
that only about 10 percent of that $2 
trillion expenditure went to COVID–19. 
Less than 1 percent went for vaccines. 
What it did include was backdoor fund-
ing for Planned Parenthood, a blank 
check for mismanaged union pension 
plans, and money for climate justice. It 
was easy to see through the COVID re-
lief facade. 
Well, as our colleagues pushed this 
bill forward, they ignored warning 
signs from leading economists that this 
kind of spending chasing limited goods 
and services could trigger inflation. 
Larry Summers, who served as Sec-
retary of Treasury during the Obama 
administration, even predicted that 
this package could ‘‘set off inflationary 
pressures of a kind we have not seen in 
a generation.’’ 
Our colleagues couldn’t be convinced 
to change course, and look where we 
are now as a result. We are experi-
encing inflation of a kind that we have 
not seen in a generation. Last month, 
prices jumped a whopping 6.8 percent 
from the previous year, marking the 
sixth consecutive month in which in-
flation has topped 5 percent. 
When concerns were raised about 
this, the Federal Reserve claimed that 
this inflation was transitory—in other 
words, it was a passing moment—but 
the longer and longer inflation con-
tinues to rise and continues to be a 
problem, it is looking less and less 
transitory and more and more fright-
ening. The reason it is frightening, of 
course, is because particularly people 
on fixed incomes are seeing less and 
less buying power for each dollar they 
spend. It is, some have said, a hidden 
tax on the American people, which de-
scribes its impact very well. 
Well, month after month, the data 
has now demonstrated that this is not 
just transitory and it isn’t just a blip 
on the radar of our economy. Inflation 
is running much hotter than expected, 
and things are not expected to cool 
down anytime soon. 
As families prepare for the Christmas 
holiday season, they are bracing their 
wallets for higher than normal ex-
penses, and one of the biggest hits is 
for grocery bills—hardly something op-
tional. Breakfast on Christmas morn-
ing is sure to cost a lot more than it

did just a year ago. Egg prices are up 8 
percent. Bacon costs a whopping 21 per-
cent more than it did just a year ago. 
Dinner—it won’t be any cheaper either. 
Prices are up for everything from ham 
to salad dressing to pie. 
Cooking that meal will cost you a lot 
more too. Electricity prices are up 6.5 
percent, and anyone cooking on a gas 
range will shell out 25 percent more 
than they did last year. 
If you are traveling to see your ex-
tended family this year, you better 
start saving for it now. Gas prices are 
up a whopping 58 percent, the largest 
increase since 1980. 
Of course, this ignores the rising cost 
of gifts sitting under the Christmas 
tree, if you can get them because of 
broken and delayed supply chains. So 
the new cars and the washing machines 
and sofas that countless families have 
purchased this year, all of those cost 
more. 
You would think that our Demo-
cratic colleagues who are proposing an-
other $5 trillion in spending under the 
so-called BBB—or Build Back Better 
bill—you would think they would view 
this with caution and back off of their 
plans or at least tap the brakes for a 
second round of unnecessary spending. 
Unfortunately, that does not appear to 
be the case. In fact, the Senate major-
ity leader, Senator SCHUMER, is trying 
to double down on this next round of 
inflationary spending. 
We know that every trick in the book 
has been employed to try to make the 
BBB, the Build Back Better—‘‘Build 
Back 
Broke,’’ 
‘‘Build 
Back 
Bad,’’ 
‘‘Build Back Bankrupt,’’ you call it 
what you will—our Democratic col-
leagues have used every gimmick in 
the book to make the price of this bill 
look as small as possible. Of course, 
they started with the chairman of the 
Budget Committee. Senator SANDERS 
wanted to spend $6 trillion more. That 
was pared down to $3.5 trillion. Now, 
they claim it is only $1.75 trillion. In 
order to achieve that number, they 
have gamed the Tax Code to fund part 
of the bill while handing out tax breaks 
to millionaires and billionaires in re-
lief for State and local taxes. They 
have strategically chosen start dates, 
sunsets, and expiration dates that 
make these programs appear decep-
tively to cost less. 
One of our colleagues acknowledged 
that this is disingenuous advertising 
and even told Mr. GRAHAM, the Senator 
from South Carolina, that he knew 
that this score they were promoting 
was full of gimmicks. 
Of course, that is a lot different than 
the President himself, who said this 
bill will cost zero. Now, everybody 
knows that is not true. 
But there had been some debate 
about what the honest score would be 
even with all the gimmicks. If the tem-
porary provisions were extended, as we 
all know they would be—there is no 
such thing as a temporary government 
program around here or, as Ronald 
Reagan said, the closest thing to eter-
nal life is a temporary government pro-
gram—this legislation will cost a lot 
more than they admit, and we now 
know how much that will be. 
Senator GRAHAM, who serves as a 
ranking member on the Budget Com-
mittee, asked the Congressional Budg-
et Office to provide a more accurate 
cost estimate for this legislation. Oth-
ers like me asked the CBO and the 
Joint Committee on Taxation to give 
us an updated estimate. There have 
been a lot of requests made to come up 
with an accurate, truth-in-advertising 
score for this huge bill. 
Last week, we got what we asked for. 
We finally received the true score for 
this legislation, and it is a whole lot 
more than the American people were 
told and much more than they have 
bargained for. Let’s start with the cost 
provision of just one part of this bill, 
the expanded child tax credit. This ex-
pansion initially came on the scene as 
a temporary measure in the first par-
tisan spending bill just 9 months ago. 
So this actually builds on the $2 tril-
lion our colleagues passed at the begin-
ning of this year. The very first pay-
ments had barely gone out the door 
when our friends on the other side of 
the aisle called for these temporary 
provisions to be made permanent. Our 
colleagues knew that a permanent ex-
pansion would have been far too expen-
sive so they opted for a temporary ex-
tension. 
Earlier drafts of this bill would have 
extended this policy through 2025. As 
time went on, the pricetag was still too 
high so Democrats scaled it back to a 
1-year extension, but still nothing has 
changed. Calls to make this temporary 
provision permanent have not gone 
away, and I see no indication that our 
colleagues will ever be content to let 
this extension expire after just 1 year. 
Our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle say this provision will cost 
taxpayers $185 billion, as if that were a 
bargain. The latest estimate from the 
CBO places the actual cost at roughly 
$1.6 trillion. You heard that right. Our 
colleagues across the aisle said it 
would just cost $185 billion, but the lat-
est estimate from the Congressional 
Budget Office placed the actual cost 
during the 10-year budget window at 
roughly $1.6 trillion, nine times higher 
than what Democrats have been telling 
the American people. The true cost of 
this one provision is nearly as high as 
what our colleagues said the entire 
package would cost. 
Then you add in the other higher- 
than-promised expenses. The true costs 
of payoffs and subsidies to organize 
labor, allowing dues to become tax de-
ductible will cost taxpayers billions 
more than advertised. 
But I will give them credit about one 
thing. They are transparent when it 
comes to subsidizing more frivolous 
lawsuits against small businesses by 
giving a permanent tax cut to trial 
lawyers. When you add up all the not- 
so-temporary provisions, the Congres-
sional Budget Office says this bill will 
cost $4.9 trillion during the first 10 
years—not $1.75 trillion, not zero, but 
$4.9 trillion. Deficits and debt would in-
crease by a staggering $3 trillion; in 
other words, borrowed money that the 
next generation or maybe next two 
generations will have to repay, which 
makes 
President 
Biden’s 
comment 
about ‘‘zero’’ even more bizarre. 
When it comes to solving our coun-
try’s biggest problems, our colleagues 
across the aisle have proven them-
selves to be a one-trick pony. Whether 
the American people are facing a pan-
demic, a sluggish economic recovery, 
red-hot inflation, or any combination 
of crises, President Biden and our 
Democratic colleagues here in Con-
gress think trillions of dollars in new 
spending is the best path forward. 
The first round of reckless spending 
hurt our economic recovery and sent 
the American people on a wild infla-
tionary ride. Our colleagues continue 
to ignore clear signals from the econ-
omy, including warnings by Demo-
cratic 
economists 
about 
the 
con-
sequences to unchecked spending. 
And we are now experiencing the 
highest inflation in a generation. This 
second round of spending would usher 
in more inflation, higher deficits, and 
even greater financial trouble for the 
American people. The American people 
have clearly suffered enough, and it is 
time to simply put the ‘‘Build Back 
Bankrupt’’ bill out of its misery. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, as we 
approach the Christmas break and the 
advent of the new year, I believe it is 
instructive to take an inventory of the 
year that was. So in honor of the holi-
day season, let’s take stock of the first 
year of the reign of Biden, SCHUMER, 
and PELOSI. In fact, in the spirit of the 
season, I am going to call this recita-
tion the ‘‘Twelve Biden Blunders of 
Christmas.’’ 
The first blunder that Joe Biden gave 
to us is a free Big Government socialist 
agenda, otherwise known as the Demo-
crats’ Build Back Better plan, designed 
to pass with no support from or, frank-
ly, input from any of these pesky Re-
publicans. 
Time and time again, Joe Biden and 
his Democratic toymakers have par-
roted the claim that their Big Govern-
ment socialist agenda costs zero—zero. 
Can you imagine a piece of legislation 
designed to give away trillions of dol-
lars but doesn’t cost anything? But 
perhaps they have some elf dust that 
makes it possible. 
Obviously, this isn’t true. Analysis

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9145 
December 14, 2021 
groups, including the Penn Wharton 
model and the Committee for a Respon-
sible Federal Budget, did an analysis 
and concluded that the cost was much, 
much higher, like just under $5 trillion. 
A recent thorough analysis, based on 
the history and the traditions of Con-
gress and spending, by the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Office agrees. 
The Washington Post’s Fact Checker 
even gave Treasury Secretary Janet 
Yellen two Pinocchios when she re-
peated the same bogus claim that this 
bill would cost nothing. 
The second blunder Joe Biden gave to 
us is hiding from media reporters and 
not taking questions. It is unbelievable 
to me—it is hard to imagine the leader 
of the freest country in the world, in 
fact, the leader of the free world, is 
afraid to take questions from the 
fourth estate or that his staffers are 
afraid of what might come out of his 
mouth. 
Freedom of the press is enshrined in 
the First Amendment of our Constitu-
tion 
on 
purpose. 
Yet 
on 
David 
Axelrod’s podcast, the White House 
Press Secretary Jen Psaki admitted 
out loud that ‘‘a lot of times we say, 
‘Don’t take questions.’ ’’ 
The media in the United States is not 
supposed to be the mouthpiece of the 
government 
or 
its 
leaders. 
Trans-
parency is essential—essential—in our 
exceptional self-governing system. 
Now, I am not the President of the 
United States, but reporters who work 
in the halls of this temple of liberty 
and, of course, reporters back home in 
North Dakota know I am always will-
ing to engage. I don’t hide from my 
votes or explanations for them. I am 
not scripted to the point of resigning 
my own thoughts or opinions or even 
mistakes and decisions. North Dako-
tans elected me, not my staff. Ameri-
cans elected Joe Biden, not his staff, 
not some buffer of bureaucracy. He has 
the responsibility to be accessible, and 
the media has the responsibility to de-
mand it of him. 
But the slippery slope doesn’t end 
here. Another third blunder Joe Biden 
gave to us is the White House deciding 
what is ‘‘misinformation.’’ In a news 
conference, Jen Psaki said: 
We’re flagging— 
Imagine this now, the White House 
spokesperson: 
We’re 
flagging 
problematic 
posts 
for 
Facebook that spread disinformation. We’re 
working with doctors and medical experts 
. . . who are popular with their audience 
with accurate information. So, we’re helping 
get trusted content out there. 
That is frightening language coming 
from a spokesperson for the President. 
It sounds an awful lot like the U.S. 
Government colluding with the media 
to decide what, in fact, counts as fact. 
In fact, reading between the lines on 
this one, it seems the White House is 
playing the ultimate arbiter of the 
truth. If this seems a little Orwellian, 
well, it is. It is. 
While it is easy to see why Ms. Psaki 
might conclude—and, frankly, other 
Democrats—that they, in fact, control 
a ‘‘state media,’’ the fact is, they don’t. 
Give the American people some credit 
here. They are smarter than being 
spoon-fed information from the West 
Wing through their ‘‘elfin folk’’ at 
Facebook. 
The fourth blunder Joe Biden gave to 
us is raging inflation from pumping 
trillions of free dollars into the econ-
omy. We all saw the writing on the 
wall when Democrats and the Biden ad-
ministration pushed for $2 trillion in 
‘‘COVID 
relief’’ 
in 
March, 
just 
3 
months removed from the bipartisan 
$900 billion relief bill. This was a total 
partisan, reckless $2 trillion that came 
at a time when there was obvious eco-
nomic recovery coming out of the pan-
demic. 
And now, Democrats want to spend 
nearly $5 trillion on their ‘‘Build Back 
Broke’’ plan. To put these massive 
numbers in perspective, the sum of 
these two bills—just these two bills—is 
more than the U.S. Government spent 
fighting World War II. In 2019 dollars, 
the United States spent $4.69 trillion 
over the course of just under 4 years to 
fight and defeat Nazi Germany and the 
Axis powers. 
Liberal 
and 
left-of-center 
econo-
mists, including Larry Summers and 
Jason Furman, sounded warning bells 
early this year, but Democrats forged 
ahead sending inflation to levels not 
seen in nearly 40 years. They continue 
to insist that inflation is ‘‘transitory,’’ 
but Americans know better. Americans 
paying more and more for everything 
with each passing month know that 
this is more than transitory inflation. 
The fifth blunder Joe Biden’s Cabinet 
gave to us is Homeland Security Sec-
retary Alejandro Mayorkas’s assess-
ment of the southern border crisis. Re-
member the hordes of illegal immi-
grants camping out on the bridge in 
Del Rio, TX? ‘‘Don’t worry,’’ Secretary 
Mayorkas said as he low-balled the 
numbers, citing: 
Approximately, I think it’s about 10,000 or 
so, 12,000. It could be even higher. 
Actually, 
conservative 
estimates 
have the tally upward of 15,000 people. 
While we are talking about the crisis 
at the southern border, it is important 
to note Joe Biden made multiple 
claims that he visited the border. But 
guess what. He hasn’t. The Washington 
Post Fact Checker wrote: ‘‘We cannot 
find evidence that Biden at one point 
made a visit to the southern border’’ in 
his many decades of public office. 
It is as though he thinks, if he says 
it, somehow that makes it true. The 
problem is lying doesn’t make the lie 
true. I have been to the border, most 
recently, about 6 weeks ago. I can tell 
you, it is bad. I can tell you, it is a cri-
sis. Our Customs and Border Patrol 
agents are completely overwhelmed. I 
went on a ride-along and aerial tour of 
the Rio Grande Valley and visited the 
Donna Processing Facility, where fami-
lies and unaccompanied minors are 
processed. If there is any takeaway 
from seeing this firsthand, it is this: 
There is no way to adequately under-
stand the magnitude of the problem or 
the severity of the crisis unless you see 
it with your own two eyes. So I implore 
the President, who has held elected of-
fice nearly uninterrupted since 1973, 
please visit the southern border and ac-
knowledge what is obvious to every-
body else. This is a national crisis. 
The sixth blunder Joe Biden gave to 
us is a new kind of border wall, not the 
wall we need to secure the crisis on the 
southern border, which has seen record 
numbers as nearly 2 million people 
have attempted to enter the country il-
legally under Biden’s watch. 
By the way, this is just the number 
of illegal immigrants who have been 
apprehended by our CBP heroes. Now, 
that is more than twice the population 
of my home State. 
But 
according 
to 
Secretary 
Mayorkas, a border wall is an affront 
to—get this—an affront to humani-
tarian relief. Obviously, the ranchers 
and the innocent American citizens liv-
ing and working near the border don’t 
qualify for this humanitarian relief. 
Yet his Agency secured and awarded a 
contract for nearly half a million tax-
payer dollars to build and install a 
fence around Joe Biden’s home in Dela-
ware. What kind of humanitarian relief 
does Joe Biden’s beach mansion need? 
The seventh blunder Joe Biden gave 
to us is $450,000 settlements for illegal 
immigrants, just for being illegal. The 
Wall Street Journal was the first to re-
port this absurd plan. While North Da-
kota families and businesses are strug-
gling with inflation and skyrocketing 
costs on everything because of Joe 
Biden’s spending policies, his adminis-
tration wants to hand out hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to illegal immi-
grants. 
In comparison to the $450,000 pro-
posed payout for illegal border cross-
ers, the U.S. Government pays only 
$100,000 to the families of soldiers 
killed in service to our country, and 
people who are wrongly accused and in-
carcerated in Federal prison are eligi-
ble for just $50,000. That is right— 
$100,000 if you die defending our free-
dom but $450,000 if you violate our free-
dom. 
Now, when confronted about this, 
President Biden said this is not going 
to happen, but he was quickly cor-
rected by his own White House and the 
Justice Department. Negotiations are 
ongoing, so we don’t know what any 
final number will be. I have helped 
sponsor legislation and amendments to 
prevent this policy from ever being im-
plemented. The last thing we need is 
another incentive for people to come to 
our country illegally. 
The eighth blunder Joe Biden gave to 
us is private jet-setting climate apolo-
gist John Kerry’s comments on coal. 
Kerry stated: 
By 2030 in the United States, we won’t have 
coal. We will not have coal plants. 
While a State Department spokes-
person walked back Kerry’s statement, 
‘‘noting the administration’s plan still

December 14, 2021 
would allow coal,’’ it is absurd on its 
face. 
Cutting off coal would shut down 
American 
innovation, 
kill 
all 
the 
progress we have made on carbon cap-
ture technology, eliminate good-paying 
U.S. jobs, scrap grid reliability, and in-
crease the cost of energy and every-
thing that is produced that is depend-
ent on the energy—like we need more 
inflation—and cede energy dominance 
to foreign adversaries who have a total 
lack of environmental concern and 
standards. Canceling coal is merely a 
transfer of emissions guilt to other 
countries with dirtier energy produc-
tion than we have. 
The ninth blunder Joe Biden gave to 
us is moral authority and other gaffes 
from 
Energy 
Secretary 
Jennifer 
Granholm. Most notably, Secretary 
Granholm—while in North Dakota, no 
less—said: ‘‘We don’t have much moral 
authority to call out China when it 
comes to energy production and emis-
sions.’’ 
This is not just wrong; it is embar-
rassing. It is not just an intellectual 
mistake; it is an embarrassing gaffe. 
The stringent environmental and, I 
might add, labor standards of the 
United States are far superior to the 
lack of any of them in China. And I 
rest my case on the facts of the situa-
tion here. 
One, according to the BBC and sev-
eral other agencies—but the BBC says 
China emits 27 percent of global emis-
sions, and it is a rising percentage be-
cause it is a rising number, while the 
United States is around 10 percent and 
a declining percent. 
Two, according to the EPA, total 
U.S. energy-related carbon emissions 
fell by 12 percent from 2005 to 2018 
while the United States became the No. 
1 energy producer in the world. 
In contrast, global energy-related 
carbon emissions increased nearly 24 
percent. So the United States reduces 
12; the globe increases 24 percent. This 
is significant by any standard and cer-
tainly qualifies us to be able to say we 
have moral authority over China when 
it comes to polluting and greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
In North Dakota, in fact, we are per-
forming ground-breaking research and 
piloting 
innovative 
demonstration 
projects. We are in the process of add-
ing carbon capture technology to fa-
cilities like the Milton R. Young and 
Coal Creek power generation stations. 
Furthermore, the United States has 
invested more in clean energy, re-
search, development, and deployment 
than the next two countries combined. 
We are a global leader in climate 
mitigation measures for new energy 
sources, carbon management, and effi-
ciency. The radical and backwards en-
ergy policy of this administration ig-
nores American exceptionalism and the 
real progress that we have made as a 
nation. 
The Chinese Communist Party, Rus-
sia, and other polluters have shown no 
real interest in doing so, yet Secretary 
Granholm and Joe Biden provide cover 
for them, along, of course, with John 
Kerry, even greenlighting their fossil 
fuel energy projects, while they kill 
America’s. 
The tenth blunder Joe Biden gave to 
us is a disastrous withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan. There is a lot to unpack 
here, and nothing about this topic is 
meant to be glib or sarcastic. This 
withdrawal was nothing short of a 
tragic disaster and an international 
embarrassment. 
We will continue searching for an-
swers and accountability from the ad-
ministration on this, but let’s focus on 
the 
failed 
commitments 
from 
Joe 
Biden. 
He 
said 
his 
administration 
would get all Americans and our allies 
out of the country ahead of his arbi-
trary August 31 withdrawal deadline. 
He also said the United States would 
stay in Afghanistan until all Ameri-
cans who want to leave can do so. This 
is obviously not what happened. 
After the botched withdrawal, the ad-
ministration listed numbers ranging 
from 85 people to 200 or maybe 400 
Americans left in Afghanistan. The 
State Department, however, believes as 
many as 14,000 legal permanent U.S. 
residents remain in Afghanistan, ac-
cording to a foreign policy press report. 
Whatever the number, the President 
went on national television and told 
the world this withdrawal was ‘‘an ex-
traordinary success.’’ 
Can you imagine being one of the 
people left behind and seeing your 
President on TV calling what he did an 
extraordinary success, saying that we 
got out successfully? It is abundantly 
clear there are significant numbers of 
U.S. citizens, residents, and important 
Afghan allies still stranded in the 
country if, in fact, they are still alive 
at all. 
The 11th blunder Joe Biden gave to 
us is welcoming stiff competition with 
China. In October, Jen Psaki was asked 
about the Chinese Communist Party’s 
hypersonic missile test successfully 
circumventing the whole globe which, 
from reports, indicate they are capable 
of delivering a nuclear warhead. Her re-
sponse, Oh, we welcome stiff competi-
tion. 
Really? Really? Why would the White 
House welcome military competition 
from our peer adversary communist 
China? 
As a member of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee, it has been a pri-
ority to ensure the U.S. military main-
tains a secure and effective deterrent, a 
nuclear deterrent. In order to do so, we 
need to modernize our nuclear triad. 
America’s nuclear triad of missiles, 
submarines, and aircraft are 60-plus 
years old in many cases, and they are 
not the same strong deterrent to our 
adversaries that they once were. It is 
clear and concerning that the Chinese 
Communist Party is prioritizing a nu-
clear buildup, and the White House 
seems comfortable with all of this. 
The 12th blunder Joe Biden gave to 
us is the consistent confusion and 
alarm in regards to his own comments 
about Taiwan. 
In October, Joe Biden told reporters, 
‘‘I have spoken with Xi Jinping about 
Taiwan. We agree, we will abide by the 
Taiwan agreement,’’ he said. Of course, 
immediately, alarm bells rang out, 
causing confusion and a lot of head 
scratching. You have to remember, we 
have a backdrop of Beijing ramping up 
military pressure on Taiwan, and Joe 
Biden can’t properly articulate our Na-
tion’s foreign policy posture. 
The lack of understanding on some-
thing as critical as China is dumb-
founding. Taiwan is a strategic ally 
and important trading partner to the 
United States, especially given the in-
creased risk China poses, not only to 
the region but to the world. If this was 
an isolated incident, it would be one 
thing, but this isn’t the only time his 
comments in Taiwan had to be clari-
fied—no. In a CNN townhall, Anderson 
Cooper interrupted the President to 
ask if Joe Biden was ‘‘saying that the 
U.S. would come to Taiwan’s defense if 
China attacked?’’ 
Joe Biden promptly responded with, 
Yes, we have a commitment. 
The White House resorted once again 
to walking back these comments, in 
what seems to be a recurring occur-
rence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. 
One Washington Post article wrote: 
Most analysts believe simply that Biden 
misspoke. 
Misspeaking is a kind way to dismiss 
the obvious lack of clear understanding 
of a critical foreign policy issue by our 
Commander in Chief. If there were to 
be an attack, I am not even sure the 
President would know what to do if he 
can’t accurately express what our pol-
icy is. 
I am not sure I can sum this up as 
succinctly as two turtledoves and a 
partridge in a pear tree, but I can con-
clude that Joe Biden and his leftwing 
extremist allies deserve a lump of car-
bon-intense coal in their White House 
stockings this Christmas. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
ANNIVERSARY OF SANDY HOOK SHOOTING 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, 9 years 
ago this morning, I was in Bridgeport, 
CT. I had just done an event with the 
city of Bridgeport, and I was meeting 
my wife and, at the time, my two very 
young children, ages 4 and 1, in 2012 at 
the Bridgeport train station. We were 
going to take the train down to New 
York City, and Cathy and I were going 
to show our two kids the splendor of 
New York City. We were going to go 
see the Christmas tree. We were going 
to go to the ice rink. 
And as we were waiting for the train 
to arrive, I got news that there had 
been a shooting at a school in New-
town, CT. Newtown is a beautiful com-
munity, a quintessential small town, 
close-knit. The Labor Day parade every 
year attracts every civic and commu-
nity group to it, the pride of the com-
munity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9147 
December 14, 2021 
And I wondered whether I could still 
continue on to this family trip or 
whether I needed to wait to find out 
more. I figured it was a disgruntled em-
ployee. A few moments passed as I 
waited for the train, and the news 
began to come in that this was much 
more grim, that there were children 
shot, perhaps many. 
And I decided that I should get in a 
car and head to Sandy Hook. There are 
a lot of days when I wish I didn’t see 
the things that I saw or hear the things 
that I heard in Newtown that day. 
Senator BLUMENTHAL, who is on the 
floor with me right now, he and I were 
there, and we were just witnesses. We 
were just interlopers. Neither of us lost 
a loved one that day, but it is a day 
that I will never, ever forget, etched 
into my brain. 
And we come here likely every De-
cember 14 to memorialize another year 
having passed since Sandy Hook. And, 
of course, at some point, you come to a 
loss for words. You can’t figure out 
what new to say to your colleagues to 
try to explain what has happened to 
these families, to this community, why 
there is such an aching for action, a 
disbelief that this country refuses to 
stand up and do something about the 
safety of our kids—because, well, New-
town caught the Nation’s attention for 
good reason, twenty 6 and 7-year-olds 
vanishing from the Earth in an instant. 
Every single day, there are mothers 
and fathers who are losing children to 
gun violence—gun violence that is 
completely preventable. 
A few weeks after Newtown, I was in 
a community center in the north end of 
Hartford with parents who were furious 
that the country was just waking up to 
this epidemic of gun violence after 
White children were shot in Newtown 
because it had been happening to their 
Black children for decades. 
And so, today, I want to do some-
thing very simple for my colleagues 
and for the country, I want to just ex-
plain to you what the grief of these 
families feels like, what it looks like 
when you lose a child, whether that 
child is 6 or 7 or 16 or 17. When you out-
live your child, when your child doesn’t 
even make it to adulthood, there is an 
all-consuming grief that is inescapable. 
One of the emotions that is con-
nected to this grief that I have learned 
about is the tendency to deny the re-
ality 
that 
has 
become 
your 
sur-
rounding. 
That is logical, to momentarily, ei-
ther purposely or subconsciously, try 
to figure out a way out of this world 
that you are living in without your 
child or without your son or daughter 
whom you had planned to spend the 
rest of your life with. 
And so I want to talk a little bit 
about that emotion today. I live now in 
the South End of Hartford. I live just 
two blocks from the intersection of 
South Prospect and Shelby Street. I 
think I live there intentionally, be-
cause I know this story so well, and 
when my family and I were looking for 
a house in Hartford and there was one 
available just two blocks from this 
intersection, I think there was prob-
ably something intentional about the 
choice we made. 
On and at that intersection, just two 
months before the Sandy Hook shoot-
ing, Shane Oliver, a young African 
American, 20 years old, was meeting a 
couple of acquaintances. He was trans-
ferring a car that he had fixed up to 
this other group of individuals whom 
he knew in passing. 
He was there with his girlfriend, and 
during the exchange of this vehicle, an 
argument broke out. It started because 
of something untoward that his sellers 
said about his girlfriend. It was essen-
tially an argument over a girl that 
turned into a fistfight that then 
prompted Luis Rodriguez to go back to 
his car. Inside that car was an illegal 
gun. He walked out of the car with a 
gun. Shane Oliver tried to run, and he 
was shot in the back. He died that 
night at a Hartford hospital. 
His mother, for a good deal after-
ward, would wake up in the middle of 
the night, awaken from a deep sleep, 
put her clothes on, get into her car, 
and start driving. She would do this 
night after night. 
She would drive from her home to 
the corner of South Prospect and 
Shelby Street, where her son died. And 
when she got there, she would shift her 
transmission into park and she would 
turn on the high beams and just wait 
for hours—the car in park, the high 
beams on—ostensibly, waiting for her 
son to come back. It is impossible. 
Shane Oliver had died months ago. He 
wasn’t coming back. But his mother, 
consumed by this grief, consumed by 
this need to deny what had happened, 
sat there in her car. 
Around the same time, one parent 
whom both Dick and I have gotten to 
know very well in Sandy Hook came up 
with her own trick. She would pretend 
that her son who had died that day at 
Sandy Hook wasn’t dead. In fact, he 
was just visiting a friend for the after-
noon. 
She was trying to figure out ways to 
just get some housework done, to just 
tidy up the place, to make some phone 
calls that she needed to in order to get 
her family’s business done, and the 
only way that she could do that was to 
imagine that her son was at a play date 
and that he would be coming home 
soon. And, of course, that dream would 
vanish, and she would once again come 
to grips with the reality that her son 
was never, ever coming home. But that 
need to deny that reality, even for a 
few hours, was what was necessary for 
her in order to get through the day. 
I just tell those two stories because I 
want people to understand how des-
perate your life becomes when you lose 
a child. We lost 26 individuals—20 kids 
and 6 educators—9 years ago today in 
Sandy Hook, and the families of all 26 
of these individuals—the parents, the 
brothers, the sisters, the children— 
their lives will never, ever be the same. 
Newtown will never, ever be the same. 
Many of these kids lived within a block 
or two of each other. Everyone in New-
town knew one of these families, two of 
these families. Half of these kids all 
went to the same church. The funerals 
that we went to over and over again 
were at the same place, with the same 
priest presiding over funeral after fu-
neral, wake after wake. 
And so sometimes those of us who 
work in and around this issue of gun 
violence get angry at our colleagues, 
because how can you listen to these 
stories of grief—and they happen in 
every State—and choose not to act? 
Lastly, I want to do something that I 
have done several times on the floor, 
because I am running out of ways to 
express what happened in Sandy Hook 
and why our inaction is inexcusable. I 
am running out of turns of phrase to do 
it myself. So maybe the words of a par-
ent will help you understand why we 
need to act. So I am going to read a few 
excerpts 
from 
testimony 
that 
our 
friend Neil Heslin gave before the U.S. 
Senate just 2 months after Sandy Hook 
occurred. 
Neil is a complicated guy, a good 
friend who had hard times in his life. 
But his best friend was his son Jesse 
Lewis. And I will end by reading what 
he wrote to the U.S. Senate 9 years 
ago. 
On December 14, Jesse got up and got ready 
for school. He was always excited to go to 
school. I remember on that day we stopped 
at Misty Vale Deli. It’s funny the things you 
remember. I remember Jesse got the sau-
sage, egg and cheese he always gets, with hot 
chocolate. And I remember the hug he gave 
me when I dropped him off. He just held me, 
and he rubbed my back. I can still feel that 
hug. 
And Jesse said ‘‘It’s going to be alright.’’ 
I mentioned that his father Neil had 
a rough life. He had a hard time, like a 
lot of folks. 
And Jesse said ‘‘It’s going to be alright. 
Everything’s going to be okay, Dad.’’ Look-
ing back it makes me wonder. What did he 
know? Did he have some idea about what was 
about to happen? But at the time I didn’t 
think much of it. I just thought he was being 
sweet. 
He was always being sweet like that. He 
was the kind of kid who used to leave me 
voice messages where he’d sing me happy 
birthday even when it wasn’t my birthday. 
I’d ask him about it, and he’d say ‘‘I just 
wanted to make you feel happy.’’ 
He had so much wisdom. He would know 
things, and I would have no idea how he 
knew. But whatever he said, it was always 
right. He would remember things we’d done 
and places we’d been that I had completely 
forgotten about. I used to think of him as a 
tiny adult. 
Other people felt it, too. Teachers would 
tell me about his laugh, how he made things 
at school more fun just by being there. 
Jesse had this idea that you never leave 
people hurt. If you can help somebody, you 
do it. 
That’s what Jesse thought. If you can 
make somebody feel better, you do it. 
They tell me that’s how he died. I guess we 
still don’t know exactly what happened at 
that school. Maybe we’ll never know. But 
what people tell me is Jesse did something

different. When he heard the shooting, he 
didn’t run and hide. He started yelling. Peo-
ple disagree [about what he said]. . . . [But] 
ten kids from my son’s class made it to safe-
ty. I hope to God something Jesse did [that 
day] helped them survive. . . . 
What I know is that Jesse wasn’t shot in 
the back. He took two bullets. The first one 
grazed the side of his head, but that [prob-
ably] didn’t stop him yelling. The other hit 
him in the forehead. Both bullets were fired 
from the front. That means the last thing 
my son did was look Adam Lanza straight in 
the face. . . . 
Jesse grew up with guns, just like I 
did. I started shooting . . . when I was 
eight years old. My dad was a vice 
president for years at a local gun club. 
He started taking me shooting when I 
was eight. . . . He taught me to respect 
guns, just like I taught Jesse. 
Jesse . . . had an interest in guns. He had 
a bb gun. I watched over him like a hawk 
with that. I taught him gun safety. He knew 
it. He could recite it to you. 
Some guns just don’t have any place in the 
hands of civilians. The assault weapons we’re 
talking about today, their sole purpose is to 
put a lot of lead out in a battlefield quickly. 
That’s what they do. That’s what they did at 
Sandy Hook Elementary. 
I wish I wasn’t here with you today. 
Neil writes: 
The best day of my life was the day my son 
was born. The worst day was the day he died. 
I don’t want to relive that day by talking to 
you here about it. It would be easier for me 
just to stay home. 
But I know that’s not what Jesse would do. 
Jesse died screaming at a man with a gun. 
He died yelling at the top of his lungs so 
maybe some of his classmates could get to 
safety. 
I’m not real political. Half the time I think 
it doesn’t matter which group of you guys 
runs things out here, no offense. I’ve always 
thought it wasn’t a real good idea for people 
to be walking around the streets with mili-
tary weapons, but I probably wouldn’t have 
said anything about it. 
So the reason I say this isn’t about politics 
is because what I felt on that day, and what 
I’ve felt since, doesn’t have anything to do 
with politics. In politics, people like to de-
bate and say if we banned the weapon that 
Adam Lanza used would he just find some-
thing else. Let me tell you, when you’re sit-
ting at a firehouse and it is one in the morn-
ing and you are hoping against hope that 
your son is still hiding somewhere in that 
school, you want any change that makes it 
one bit more likely you’ll see your boy 
again. 
Before he died, Jesse and I used to talk 
about maybe coming to Washington some-
day. He wanted to go up the Washington 
monument. When we talked about it last 
year Jesse asked if we could come and meet 
the President. 
I said earlier that I can be a little cynical 
about politicians. But Jesse believed in you. 
He learned about you in school and he be-
lieved in you. I want to believe in you, too. 
I know you can’t give me Jesse back. Believe 
me, if I thought you could I’d be asking you 
for that. But I want to believe that you will 
think about what I told you [here] today. I 
want to believe that you’ll think about it 
and then you’ll do something about it, what-
ever you can do to make sure that no other 
father has to see what I’ve seen. 
Dick and I were at that firehouse all 
day and all night, and I will never, ever 
forget that when all the parents had 
gone home, having told what happened, 
the first responders had almost all left. 
Sitting in the middle of the firehouse 
all by himself was this one man. And it 
was Neil Heslin. I left that firehouse— 
I can’t remember—at 10 o’clock or 11 
o’clock at night. And Neal was the last 
person I talked to. And, as he tells you 
in his testimony, he didn’t leave until 
1:30. If there was any chance that Jesse 
was coming back, that he was running 
around in the woods, he was going to be 
sitting there at the firehouse. 
It gets harder every year, and I have 
no personal stake in this. I went home 
that night to both of my kids, who 
were sleeping safely in their beds. 
What the hell is going on in this 
country that we sit here and memori-
alize year after year since those 20 kids 
died and we don’t do anything mean-
ingful about it? 
Next December will be 10 years, and I 
am just going to tell you how hard it 
will be for so many of these families to 
live through a 10-year mark of Sandy 
Hook with no action from this body. 
We have a year to get our act to-
gether here to make sure that in some 
small way we can honor these children 
with action. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PETERS). 
The 
Senator 
from 
Con-
necticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
this day is one of the profound mo-
ments for both Senator MURPHY and 
myself, because we lived through that 
day—a searing, grief-stricken day that 
neither of us will ever forget, 9 years 
ago. And at this moment on that day, 
I stood before a church full of parents 
and members of that Newtown commu-
nity. And what I said then was, ‘‘The 
world is watching. The world is watch-
ing us and what we will do.’’ 
Today, we remember not only what 
we lost but also what we still need to 
do as, 9 years ago, those 20 beautiful 
children and 6 great educators lost 
their lives. Today, as we did at St. 
Rose of Lima Church that evening, we 
remember the lives they lived. Their 
names will be forever engraved in our 
hearts. We remember them for bringing 
bursts of light and laughter and love 
into our lives, mostly into the lives of 
their families. 
We also remember the heroism, the 
real heroism, of those educators on 
that day—of the six who bravely 
sought to shield their children. Lit-
erally, with their own bodies, they 
sought to protect their children—run-
ning unhesitatingly toward that dan-
ger, barricading classrooms, drawing 
on all their reserves of calm and profes-
sionalism to protect the children in 
their care. They were heroes, and so 
were emergency responders, State po-
lice, and all who came to the firehouse 
that day. I remember the broken 
faces—the heartbroken faces—of men 
who went into the school building to 
secure the crime scene and saw the 
bodies of children who could have been 
their own. They were tough State po-
licemen who had seen it all. Those 
emergency responders, the ministers, 
the priests, the people of faith who 
tended to the parents, and, yes, indeed, 
the parents themselves—heroes. 
My colleague Senator MURPHY has 
talked about Jesse’s dad, Neil Heslin. 
Jesse’s mom, Scarlett Lewis, became a 
hero as a champion of social and emo-
tional learning to try to prevent the 
conflict and the emotional travail that 
could lead someone like Adam Lanza 
to do what he did. 
I will never forget, at one of those 
wakes and funerals that we attended in 
the days afterward—they seemed inter-
minable in the cold and the deadening 
light of winter—the one mom whom I 
approached and said: ‘‘When the time is 
right, when you are ready, I think we 
should do something about gun vio-
lence.’’ She looked at me and said: ‘‘I 
am ready now.’’ 
The 
ferocity, 
the 
bravery, 
the 
strength, and fortitude of those parents 
in the days and months afterward, 
coming here, as we sought to do some-
thing about gun violence, and then 
they sat in the Gallery when, by a 
handful of votes, we failed, and the cry 
of shame—shame—that one of those 
parents shouted to us. 
They worked bravely, and they have 
continued that work with the kind of 
unflinching courage that it takes every 
time they tell their stories and every 
time one of the surviving families 
talks about their children in the quest 
to save others. That is what it is all 
about. That is why those brave par-
ents—heroes—of this story have con-
tinued. 
For them, that December morning 
began like every other. They took their 
children to school, kissed them good-
bye, maybe admonished them to be 
good that day. It was a normal day 
until it wasn’t. Then, time stopped for 
them and for all of us. Time stopped, 
and the world changed forever—irrep-
arably. Irreparably, it changed forever 
for them and for all of us. Nine years 
later, they live with that grief so far 
more deeply than any of us that it al-
most feels like an incursion on their 
privacy to talk about that day. The 
scars of that day are for them but also 
for the brothers and sisters. For every-
one who suffered a loss, that trauma 
and grief continue, and they relive it 
on this day. 
There also are heroes in that commu-
nity of Newtown and Sandy Hook—a 
beautiful, quintessential New England 
town, with such great spirit. They 
came together that evening at the St. 
Rose of Lima Church and in the days 
and weeks and years afterward with 
unyielding conviction and courage. 
Yet we know that they are so far 
from alone because, in that time—in-
credibly, in the time—of the 9 years 
since that day, 900,000 more people 
have perished; 900,000 more people have 
died from gun violence and so many of 
them children. One-third of American 
children live in a home with a gun, and 
3 million children are exposed to gun 
violence every year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9149 
December 14, 2021 
Firearms are the leading cause of 
death among American children and 
teenagers—the leading cause of death 
for children younger than the age of 13. 
So often, they occur at home—outside 
the front door, in the neighborhood. 
Black children and teens are 14 times 
more likely than White children and 
teens to die by gun homicide. There is 
a searing inequity and injustice here 
that radiates outside the boundaries of 
Sandy Hook and Newtown. It affects 
every community. None is immune. 
None is above gun violence. 
Because 60 percent of all deaths by 
gun violence are suicide, there are so-
lutions here, like safe storage and 
emergency risk protection orders, and 
red flag statutes that simply keep guns 
safely stored, like Ethan’s Law, or that 
separate guns from people who say 
they are going to kill themselves or 
others or who give evidence that that 
is what they are going to do. 
The good news is we are seeing a new 
generation of leaders. We are seeing a 
political movement, not just a moment 
but a political movement, and a group 
of organizations that is mobilizing the 
vast majority of the American people 
who know we need to put an end to gun 
violence: Sandy Hook Promise, New-
town 
Action 
Alliance, 
Connecticut 
Against Gun Violence, Moms Demand 
Action, Students Demand Action, Gif-
fords, Brady, March for Our Lives—in 
the wake of Parkland, March for Our 
Lives. This is a new generation brought 
together by tragedy, united regardless 
of their party. Regardless of their 
other politics, they are together in de-
manding action. 
With every one of these mass trage-
dies—Parkland, Las Vegas, Charleston, 
El Paso, Orlando, Pittsburgh, Atlanta, 
Boulder, Indianapolis, and now Oxford, 
MI—the scourge of gun violence has 
united these groups in a way that has 
never happened before, with the hope 
that Americans will express themselves 
not only in their neighborhoods and at 
community meetings but also at the 
ballot box in order to hold us account-
able—truly responsible—for the com-
plicity of Congress. Yes, it is com-
plicity in that death and murder that 
occur literally every day. More than 
100 lives are lost every day. 
There are real commonsense solu-
tions here. I don’t need to describe 
them in detail—that will be for another 
day: expanding background checks and 
closing loopholes in that background 
check system, keeping weapons of war 
and ghost guns off our streets, funding 
public health research and community 
violence intervention programs, pro-
tecting domestic violence survivors, 
setting standards for safe and secure 
storage, implementing those red flag 
statutes, and holding the gun industry 
and its nefarious partners accountable. 
We know what to do. We know what is 
necessary to help stop gun violence. 
There is no mystery here, and this 
movement—a political movement and 
social movement—can achieve it. 
But I want to talk not only about the 
grief suffered by families who have lost 
loved ones but about the impact on the 
living who may not even know about 
Sandy Hook. There are children at 
schools right now, children who rou-
tinely do active shooter drills, diving 
under their desks or barricading their 
doors in anticipation of a mass murder 
in the place that should be the safest 
to them. 
What will this generation think of 
school? 
What 
will 
this 
generation 
think of safety? 
Today, in some schools, there was no 
school because of the copycat threats 
phoned in to those schools. 
What kind of nation has to shut down 
schools because of the threat of mass 
murder? Not our Nation, I would hope; 
not our Nation, if we use our power to 
make our Nation safer; not our Nation, 
if we have the same kind of courage 
and guts and grit that those families of 
Sandy Hook have. We promised to 
honor them with action. 
We should keep in mind the grace 
and bravery of people like Kristin and 
Mike Song, who lost their son, a teen-
ager, at a friend’s house, to a shooting 
that was the result of an unsecured 
weapon—unsecured because the parents 
of his friend failed to put it under lock 
and key. They made it accessible. Kids 
die like that every day, every week. As 
our hearts break, we should remember 
the bravery of Kristin and Michael 
Song, who crusaded for Ethan’s Law, 
named after their son. 
They were here just last week at a 
vigil—literally, within a stone’s throw 
of the Capitol—reciting their story, 
seeking to inspire us to act and take 
that step toward safe storage but tak-
ing nobody’s gun away. These measures 
take no one’s gun away. They just 
make it safe to own a gun and to save 
lives. 
We have children. I have four chil-
dren. My colleagues on the floor have 
children and families. We remember 
those days when our kids were 6 years 
old. We remember the joy and life they 
brought to our lives. 
There is a saying that no parent 
should outlive a child. Until we know 
someone who loses a child, but most es-
pecially at that age, the power of that 
saying may have less meaning. 
In 10 years, we should have done a lot 
more, if we mark 10 years without 
doing more. In 10 years, next year at 
this time, we should hold ourselves ac-
countable for doing more. 
Over this next year, we have work to 
do. And as dark as December may 
seem, it is also a season of light. And 
the heroism of those families, of the 
first responders, of the community of 
Sandy Hook should provide us with the 
inspiration we need to honor those 
brave and wonderful children, to honor 
them with action, not just words. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
TRIBUTE TO BRYN STEWART 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to honor an ex-
traordinary public servant. It is my 
longtime 
legislative 
director, 
Bryn 
Stewart. 
He is going to be leaving the Senate 
after a 20-year career of working on be-
half of the people of Wyoming. 
He served in this great institution 
under two different U.S. Senators from 
Wyoming. He and his family have deep 
roots within our State, and he is a 
third-generation Wyomingite. 
Bryn was born and raised in Sheri-
dan, WY. His father Clyde was a high 
school 
business 
teacher 
who 
also 
coached basketball and the golf team. 
His mother Jerrie worked at the Sheri-
dan Press, our local newspaper. Both of 
his parents encouraged him to work 
hard, to always be respectful, and, 
most importantly, to be himself, not to 
be what others expected him to be. 
Well, he has exceeded all expectations, 
I will tell you. 
Family means everything to Bryn. 
He is the fifth oldest of seven children. 
And while it is Bryn’s career that we 
are here to pay tribute to today, in 
terms of his work in the Senate, his 
older sister Kendall was the first Stew-
art sibling to work in the U.S. Senate. 
She worked for Wyoming Senator Mal-
colm Wallop. She then came to work in 
my own office in Sheridan, WY, in 
Bryn’s hometown. 
It is also important to point out that 
Bryn’s brother Dow also worked in the 
U.S. Senate. What a testament to 
Bryn’s parents that so many of their 
children were committed to public 
service. 
Bryn took a very different route to 
the U.S. Senate than his siblings. After 
graduating from the University of Wy-
oming with a finance degree, Bryn 
went on to earn his law degree from 
the College of Law at the university in 
1985. 
It turns out that Bryn wasn’t the 
only standout from his class that year 
at the University of Wyoming School 
of Law. My fellow U.S. Senator from 
Wyoming, CYNTHIA LUMMIS, was Bryn’s 
classmate in the law school, and the 
two of them remain great friends to 
today. 
After passing the Wyoming State 
Bar, Bryn has maintained his member-
ship in the Wyoming Bar for 36 years. 
He moved to Gillette, WY, and he 
started his career there as legal advisor 
to the Campbell County sheriff and 
deputy county attorney. Now, I would 
point out that Campbell County, in 
Gillette, is the town where Mike Enzi, 
my former colleague, had been a rep-
resentative in the legislature as well as 
the mayor. And Mike Enzi also had 
graduated, as has Bryn, from Sheridan 
High School. 
Ten years later, Bryn became the di-
rector of administrative services for 
the Campbell County Board of Commis-
sioners. In that role, Bryn was able to 
balance the budget during a major eco-
nomic downturn without laying off any 
employees. This was not an easy 
achievement. 
Now, after more than 16 years of 
serving the people of Campbell County,

S9150 
December 14, 2021 
Bryn made the move to Washington, 
DC. He came to DC to work for my 
predecessor, Senator Craig Thomas, as 
his tax and trade counsel. The person 
who gets full credit for convincing 
Bryn to come work for the U.S. Senate 
wasn’t Senator Thomas; it wasn’t me; 
it was my incredible wife Bobbi Brown 
Barrasso who encouraged Bryn to take 
the job and move across the country. 
Bryn fondly tells the story of how my 
wife Bobbi, who was then the State di-
rector for Senator Thomas at the time 
in 2001, reached out to Bryn about the 
opportunity that really did change the 
course of his life and his career. 
Now, she knew that he would be a 
perfect fit for the job. We are all very 
grateful to Bobbi in so many ways but 
most certainly for recognizing Bryn’s 
talent and talking him into taking a 
leap of faith. 
Although it turns out a cross-country 
move wouldn’t be the biggest shock of 
the journey for Bryn—it is a long way 
from Wyoming to Washington—but he 
was officially offered the job the Fri-
day before the terrorist attacks of Sep-
tember 11, 2001. 
Many people would have reconsidered 
moving to Washington, DC, after the 
largest terrorist attack in our coun-
try’s history, but Bryn didn’t think 
twice. In fact, it only strengthened his 
resolve and his commitment to serve 
the Nation and the people of Wyoming. 
It turns out he would need that re-
solve because during his first week in 
the DC office, the anthrax attacks oc-
curred against our Nation, against our 
Capitol, and against a Senate office 
building. Anonymous letters laced with 
deadly anthrax arrived in congres-
sional offices, and Bryn, like so many 
staffers on the Hill, was displaced for 
months into temporary quarters. 
Despite the chaos and the rocky 
start, Bryn was not deterred, and he 
immediately jumped into his legisla-
tive role at full speed. 
For his first 21⁄2 years, Bryn served as 
counsel 
for 
Senator 
Thomas. 
He 
worked on numerous tax and trade 
bills. Most notably, he helped draft and 
pass legislation providing critical relief 
to 
drought-stricken 
livestock 
pro-
ducers in Wyoming and across the 
country. Senator Thomas was so im-
pressed with Bryn’s work that he pro-
moted him to be his legislative direc-
tor in 2004. 
As you know, legislative directors 
have a very big job and lots of responsi-
bility. They guide the entire policy 
staff in developing and implementing 
the Senator’s legislative agenda. As a 
result, legislative directors must be up 
to speed on all of the issues. 
Bryn recalls one story in particular 
from his early days as legislative direc-
tor directly on this point. During the 
2005 energy bill debate, Senator Thom-
as was selected to serve on the con-
ference committee. A week into the 
committee meetings, Senator Thom-
as’s then-energy legislative assistant 
was diagnosed with cancer. Never one 
to back down from a challenge, Bryn 
immediately stepped in. 
He quickly took over the reins, and 
he helped Senator Thomas successfully 
lead the fight for Wyoming coal and 
other important energy resources. 
Bryn recounts this experience as one 
of the highlights of his legislative ca-
reer—always ready to help, always 
ready to act. 
In 2007, when Wyoming and the Sen-
ate 
tragically 
lost 
Senator 
Craig 
Thomas to cancer, Bryn was central in 
supporting our entire staff, many of 
whom are on the floor today, through 
an extremely difficult and emotional 
time. And when I was selected to fill 
Senator Thomas’s seat, I asked Bryn to 
stay on as my legislative director. It is 
a decision that I have never regretted. 
For more than 14 years, I have been 
incredibly fortunate to have his advice 
and his counsel. We worked together on 
critical issues that will have a lasting 
and positive impact on Wyoming for 
decades to come. This includes his 
great work in helping to pass the Craig 
Thomas Snake Headwaters Legacy Act, 
which was signed into law in 2009. 
Bryn was also instrumental in secur-
ing the return of Wyoming’s abandoned 
mine land funds to our State, which is 
why I have always referred to him as 
our hundred-million-dollar man. 
Now, these are just a few examples of 
the work Bryn is most proud of in his 
20-year Senate career. 
Bryn’s dependability and knowledge 
made him an indispensable member of 
my team. His work ethic and his dedi-
cation are legendary. He stays late; he 
works weekends; and he does whatever 
it takes to get the job done. We often 
joke in the office that Bryn is the first 
one in the ‘‘leg shop’’ and the last one 
to leave. It doesn’t matter if it is a 
blizzard outside or a global pandemic, 
Bryn is infamous for not letting any-
thing keep him from doing the work in 
the Senate for the benefit of the people 
of Wyoming. 
While I have talked a lot about 
Bryn’s professional accomplishments, I 
also want to highlight the ways that he 
continues to give back to the commu-
nity and give back to others. He makes 
it his mission to live his life with a 
purpose. It is one of the reasons he 
prioritizes giving back to the commu-
nity as much as he can. 
One of his biggest passions is sup-
porting organizations focused on pro-
viding food and shelter to those in 
need. He serves as a member of the Sal-
vation Army board in his local commu-
nity. He served in organizations that 
build homeless shelters, operate food 
pantries, and run low-income energy 
assistance programs. He is also a mem-
ber of the Northern Wyoming Commu-
nity College Advisory Board in Gillette 
that focuses on providing high-quality, 
postsecondary education to the people 
in Campbell County and around Wyo-
ming. 
Bryn’s departure from the Senate 
leaves very big shoes to fill. And while 
we are all sad to see him go, we are 
happy to know he is moving back to 
where it all started for him, his home-
town, Sheridan, WY. 
He will be closer to family, also be 
able to spend time camping, hiking, 
and biking through his beloved Bighorn 
Mountains. 
Bryn, Bobbi joins me, along with our 
entire staff, many of whom are here on 
the floor—the current staff, but it is 
also the past staff, the present staff—in 
commending you on a remarkable ca-
reer of service. 
We are grateful that you chose to 
dedicate your life to helping make Wy-
oming and our country a better place 
to live and a better place to work. 
It is with admiration, appreciation, 
and respect that I wish you every suc-
cess as you embark on this new adven-
ture. And we are not just saying that 
because today is your birthday. You 
will be truly missed. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first, 
I want to offer my congratulations to 
Bryn Stewart. 
That was a beautiful speech about 
the public service that he has contrib-
uted to Wyoming and to the U.S. Sen-
ate. I thank my colleague from Wyo-
ming for that. 
KENTUCKY 
Mr. President, I also want to say that 
over the weekend, I had the oppor-
tunity to travel to Kentucky. 
I live in Ohio so Kentucky is our 
neighboring State. I went down to help 
some of our neighbors get back on 
their feet after these devastating tor-
nadoes. It was very emotional, partly, 
obviously, seeing people’s lives just be 
devastated—houses ruined and family 
heirlooms 
lost 
and, 
unfortunately, 
some loss of life—as the tornado hit 
some of the residential areas in West-
ern Kentucky, but also another emo-
tion, which is gratitude for the people 
who came forward as volunteers to 
help, neighbor helping neighbor. 
As always happens when you have 
one of these natural disasters, the only 
silver lining is that people do come to-
gether in providing water and food and 
help getting people out of their homes 
through 
urban 
search 
and 
rescue 
teams, like Ohio Task Force One, that 
went down to Kentucky chain-sawing 
trees down so that people can get their 
cars out and try to repair some of the 
damage, get their lives back together. 
It was a terrible thing to see the dev-
astation but also a wonderful thing to 
see people coming together to help one 
another to get through a tough time. 
INFLATION 
Mr. President, I am on the floor 
today primarily to talk about the leg-
islation that has been proposed by the 
Biden administration and by the Demo-
cratic leadership. 
This is the 11th consecutive week 
that I have come to the floor to talk 
about this because, every week since it 
was introduced 11 weeks ago, I have 
wanted to talk about what is actually 
in this legislation, how it would impact 
our communities, how it would impact 
our economy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9151 
December 14, 2021 
So, today, I am here to talk a little 
about some of the new numbers we 
have in terms of inflation and how this 
would impact inflation and some of the 
new numbers that just came out since 
last 
week 
from 
the 
Congressional 
Budget Office, which is the nonpartisan 
group up here that analyzes these leg-
islative efforts, and what they are say-
ing about what the cost of this bill will 
be. 
So I think it is worth having this 
conversation before Congress—the Sen-
ate and the House—votes on this mas-
sive tax bill, a massive spending bill 
that could fundamentally change the 
way our economy works and, I think, 
put us in a very difficult position as it 
relates to inflation and the economy 
and our debt and our deficit. 
Democrats want to push this through 
under what is called reconciliation, 
which is a special procedure here in the 
Senate where, instead of getting the 
normal supermajority of 60 votes, they 
could do it with only 50 votes and then 
have a tie-breaker be the Vice Presi-
dent in her role as President of the 
Senate. So I have concerns about the 
substance of the legislation but also in 
terms of the process. 
Wouldn’t it be great if this could ac-
tually go through committees and the 
committees could vet some of these 
proposals? Last week, I talked about 
some of the tax proposals, for instance, 
which I think have inadvertent im-
pacts 
on 
pensions—defined 
benefit 
plans, in particular—inadvertent ef-
fects on businesses that aren’t going to 
be able to write off expansions and 
plant equipment, which we want them 
to do. 
Maybe some of these things are inad-
vertent, but it also has a change in the 
tax policy where it says that the State 
and local tax deduction would no 
longer be capped at $10,000. This is a 
Federal deduction people are able to 
take on their State and local taxes, but 
they would raise that to $80,000, that 
cap. 
The impact of that and a couple 
other things in the legislation means 
that 70 percent of millionaires—people 
who make over $1 million in income a 
year—would get a significant tax cut 
under this legislation; whereas, if you 
only make 30,000 bucks a year, only 30 
percent of those people get a tax cut. 
And that is in the first year. In the 
second year, it goes down to about half 
that. And in the third year, it goes 
down to 10 percent and below. So it 
really is skewed toward providing tax 
relief for the wealthy at a time when, 
obviously, we are concerned about 
those people. Given the economic un-
certainty, given the COVID issues, 
given the natural disasters, given the 
other issues that we face, you would 
want to help those who need the help 
the most. That is not what this legisla-
tion does. 
Again, if it had gone through the 
process of the committees of jurisdic-
tion—in this case, the Finance Com-
mittee, the Ways and Means Com-
mittee—I don’t think we would be see-
ing this. All these issues are ones that 
could have been ironed out had it not 
been jammed through on this reconcili-
ation process without any committee 
consideration. 
So I am upset that Congress is being 
thwarted from doing its work, and I 
think, if we had, it would be a very dif-
ferent piece of legislation. 
This plan is also going to hurt, in my 
view, with regard to inflation. We are 
looking at the highest inflation we 
have had in decades. I think everybody 
knows that now, not because they are 
looking at the numbers, which I will 
talk about in a second, but because 
when they go to the grocery store, they 
are paying a lot more for a hamburger 
or for milk or for bread; or when they 
go to fill up their car with gas, they 
are seeing the prices at the pump. 
I filled up my pickup truck—I took it 
to Kentucky on the trip I just talked 
about—and it was almost a hundred 
bucks to fill it up. That is a lot for peo-
ple who are on a fixed income or young 
people or someone who has to commute 
to work. That really takes a bite out of 
your budget. But that inflation is 
across our economy right now, and it is 
tough on people. 
The work shortages that we see, the 
workforce shortages, the supply chain 
delays, 
the 
inflation—all 
of 
these 
things are problems in our economy 
right now. All of them get worse, in my 
view, if we do it the way the Democrats 
propose because, by adding more fuel 
to the fire, more stimulus spending—in 
this case, trillions of dollars—you are 
going to stimulate more demand in the 
economy. And inflation happens when 
demand outstrips supply. So you have 
a lot of demand for something, but you 
don’t have the supply for it, and it 
raises inflation. 
And that is exactly what many of us 
predicted would have happened back in 
March of this year when Congress did 
the same thing—$1.9 trillion. A lot of it 
was stimulus spending. And people 
said, ‘‘This is going to cause inflation,’’ 
and, sure enough, it did. It wasn’t just 
me and other Republicans. It was some 
Democrats as well. 
So that trend of rising inflation, 
which has made things so costly and 
expensive for so many people in my 
home State of Ohio, shows no sign of 
slowing down. Late last week, the 
Labor Department reported that the 
Consumer Price Index, or the CPI, rose 
by 6.8 percent over the last 12 months. 
That is the biggest year-to-year infla-
tionary increase in 39 years—39 years. 
And last month, the number for in-
flation—1 month alone—was 0.8 per-
cent. So get on your calculator and do 
the math: 0.8 percent in 1 month. Do 
that times 12 months, and you end up 
with inflation of 10 percent on an 
annualized basis. That is just from last 
month, if we just extrapolate that out 
over the year. 
Ten percent inflation? For those who 
lived through inflation in the late 
1970s, early 1980s, you know what that 
does to your economy. So the notion 
that the Biden administration has that 
this is going to be temporary or transi-
tory, that is just not true. And, by the 
way, the Federal Reserve has now said 
that is not true. It is going to be here 
for a while. 
Although we are hearing a lot of sto-
ries these days about businesses paying 
higher wages to attract workers, aver-
age wages went up by 4.3 percent last 
year. So with all of the labor shortages 
and the increase in wages, wages went 
up 4.3 percent. Again, inflation went up 
6.8 percent in the same 12-month pe-
riod. 
So this is why, if you are getting a 
raise at work and you feel pretty good 
about it—getting the raise—but then 
you go to the grocery store or go to the 
gas pump or buy some clothes and you 
don’t feel so good about it, it is because 
your inflation is higher than your wage 
gain. So unless your wage gain is over 
6.8 percent over the last year, on aver-
age, you are losing out. And that is a 
real problem. 
By the way, in 2020, as we got into 
the COVID–19 crisis, we had a very dif-
ferent economy. In February of 2020, we 
had the 19th straight month of wage 
gains of 3 percent or more, and infla-
tion was 1, 1.5 percent. So people were 
feeling: Hey, I am making more money, 
and it is not being eaten up by infla-
tion. 
That is not the case now, unfortu-
nately. Wages are not keeping pace 
with these higher prices, and people are 
finding that their paychecks just don’t 
go as far as they used to. 
We can see by some data that just 
came out from a survey of consumer 
expectations from the New York Fed 
that an increasing number of people 
are reporting that they are struggling 
more financially than they did a year 
ago. That is from the Fed, the New 
York Fed. And fewer are expecting 
their financial situation to improve by 
this time next year. That is not a great 
feeling as we approach the holiday sea-
son. That is a real concern. 
The other report we have had since I 
was on the floor last week is with re-
gard to the Producer Price Index. We 
have talked about the Consumer Price 
Index. The Producer Price Index is 
about businesses: What are businesses 
seeing in terms of inflation on busi-
ness-to-business 
purchases, 
for 
in-
stance? 
The new number out this week on 
that is the largest increase year over 
year since we started keeping track of 
this number, which was about 11 years 
ago, 12 years ago. So the Producer 
Price Index is also going up, and the 
Consumer Price Index is already up. 
What this means is that that Pro-
ducer Price Index number is eventually 
going to be reflected in higher con-
sumer 
costs—right?—because 
busi-
nesses are going to pass that along. So 
this is not a good week because we just 
got that data, and I was very sorry to 
see it because what you want to see is 
the Producer Price Index going down;

meaning that, in the future, the con-
sumer prices are going to go down too. 
Instead, we are seeing a situation 
where it is likely that prices are going 
to keep going up. 
Again, Republicans warned of this 
when the $1.9 trillion was spent, mostly 
to stimulate the economy, saying this 
is going to overheat the economy— 
more demand, less supply, partly be-
cause of COVID. In other words, COVID 
made it harder to get supply in. If de-
mand goes up, you are going to have 
inflation. And sure enough, that is 
what happened. 
Larry Summers is the former Sec-
retary of the Treasury under President 
Obama, former Chair of the national 
Council of Economic Advisers. Actu-
ally, he was Treasury Secretary for 
President Clinton and Chair of the Na-
tional Economic Council for President 
Obama, a respected economist. He, too, 
warned of this. So it is not just a par-
tisan issue, not Republicans and Demo-
crats. It is the reality of what is hap-
pening when you increase demand 
much more than supply can handle. 
You get inflation. So it is not a sur-
prise that it happened. Unfortunately, 
his prediction came true: overheated 
economy, demand outstripping supply. 
We found ourselves in this spiral of ris-
ing prices. 
That was 9 months ago. I think it is 
fair to say that the inflation that peo-
ple said was transitory is going to stay 
here for a while. That is a real cause 
for concern. 
So why are we doing this? Why are 
we, again, spending trillions of dollars? 
And what is the cost? 
Something that happened since we 
talked last week is that the true cost 
of the Build Back Better plan is now 
being revealed by this group on the 
outside from the University of Penn-
sylvania Wharton School, by the Com-
mittee for a Responsible Federal Budg-
et, and by others, but now by the Con-
gressional Budget Office itself. 
So the Congressional Budget Office is 
the nonpartisan group up here in Con-
gress that tells us what the fiscal im-
pact is, what the spending impact is, 
what the taxing impact is, what the 
economic impact is of legislation. 
And the number that has been cited 
for the cost of this Build Back Better 
legislation is $1.7 trillion over 10 years. 
That is a lot. That would make it the 
second most expensive bill ever passed 
by Congress, the first being the $1.9 
trillion we talked about in March. 
But it is worse than that because it 
turns out that even those staggeringly 
high costs we just talked about—$1.7 
trillion—miss the mark based on the 
analysis that just came out. Just as 
prices for everyday goods and services 
are going up, the estimates we are see-
ing for the true cost of Build Back Bet-
ter are increasing with every analysis 
we see. 
These studies have shown us that be-
cause the legislation sunsets programs, 
if you actually assume those programs 
are not going to be stopped after—let’s 
say with the child tax credit—1 year or 
2 years or 3 years, but you continue it 
through the life of the legislation, it is 
going to be much more expensive. 
So people tell me: Well, Rob, that is 
fine, but the child tax credit, as an ex-
ample, only costs $185 billion—only. 
And I say: Well, actually, if you take 
it out over time, that becomes trillions 
of dollars—like $1.6, $1.7 trillion. 
They say: Well, we are just going to 
do it for 1 year. 
Well, that is just not what happens 
here in Congress. The history of this is 
that once we put a program like that 
in place, it continues to live on year 
after year. 
Let me give you the best example of 
that. You have probably heard a lot of 
Democrats saying over the past few 
weeks: We have to pass this Build Back 
Better legislation by the end of this 
year. 
Why? Because the child tax credit—it 
is already in law based on the March 
legislation—is expiring. So there is a 
tremendous amount of pressure, right? 
They are saying you have to extend it. 
Well, that makes our case. So you 
have to extend it this year? That 
means, I assume, you have to extend it 
next year and the next year and the 
next year and the next year. 
And anybody who says that they 
don’t want to extend it—on the other 
side of the aisle—I would like to hear 
from them because I don’t think they 
are going to say that. And so, if you as-
sume it is extended, then you have this 
huge cost. The spending is going to 
continue to increase, and the program 
is not going to sunset. The total cost of 
the bill goes from $1.7 trillion that we 
talked about to about $4.5 trillion 
based on the Penn Wharton study I 
talked about. 
Under the Congressional Budget Of-
fice analysis, it actually goes even 
higher—even higher—to $4.9 trillion. 
And when you add interest on the debt, 
it goes actually over $5 trillion. 
So it is difficult to understand these 
numbers we are talking about because 
they are so huge. You know, $4.5 tril-
lion is $4,500 billion. We have never 
spent this kind of money before. I 
mean, if it is $5 trillion, that is the size 
of our budget, more or less—the whole 
budget for the entire country for a 
year, in one bill. 
Now, people say: Well, it is paid for. 
Well, the 1.7 part, you could argue, is 
paid for—although we can talk about 
that, too, because some of the things in 
the pay-fors are not sustainable in my 
view, including, again, the impact on 
pension funds or the impact on being 
able to write off investments or the im-
pact of the SALT issue. So there are 
lots of things that need to be worked 
out on the spending side but also on 
the revenue side. 
So let’s assume it is $1.7 trillion, but 
that is not going to cover it because 
you have these expenses—like the child 
tax credit—that will continue. 
So I am glad that my colleague Sen-
ator LINDSEY GRAHAM, who is the rank-
ing member of the Budget Committee, 
a top Republican, and Senator JOHN 
CORNYN, another colleague, asked the 
nonpartisan Congressional Budget Of-
fice to do their analysis, because they 
showed that, without the sunset, the 
10-year cost of the child tax credit goes 
from $185 billion to $1.6 trillion. 
They also found that, in line with an-
other study by the nonpartisan Joint 
Committee on Taxation, the revenue 
lost would be $1.6 trillion, either tak-
ing us further into debt by $1.6 trillion 
or requiring new tax hikes. 
So that is just one part of the legisla-
tion. It would be the costliest expendi-
ture by Congress in our history, but it 
is just one part of the legislation. The 
hundreds of billions in funding Demo-
crats are proposing as an example for 
childcare under a new approach to 
childcare, which we can also talk 
about, the substance of that, but it is 
going to hurt a lot of our State the way 
they are doing it. But that will end up 
costing double the written amount 
over the next decade if they remain in 
place, for example. 
So all in all, the Congressional Budg-
et Office looked at 18 supposedly sunset 
social spending programs and found 
that they will end up costing the tax-
payers nearly $3.5 trillion over the next 
decade when they get extended, if they 
do. Again, the history around here is 
that they would. So, you know, the 
price tag goes up and up and up. 
When you add that spending to an-
other program in Build Back Better, 
the CBO says the total spending in the 
legislation, again, goes to $4.9 trillion; 
$4.9 trillion is bigger than the economy 
of any country in the world, with the 
exception of the U.S., China, and 
Japan. 
Again, these numbers are just astro-
nomical. But think about that. It is 
bigger than the entire economy, the 
entire GDP of any country in the world 
except for the three of us: the United 
States, China, and Japan. 
We are seeing record debts and record 
deficits right now, as you know. The 
Congressional Budget Office says that 
the American people can expect Build 
Back Better, if the sunsets don’t hold, 
to add another $3 trillion to the Fed-
eral deficit. 
So if we continue to debate this in 
Congress, which way should we go, we 
just ought to know these numbers. We 
ought to analyze them. And again, if 
people on the other side of the aisle are 
going to say we don’t want to have the 
child tax credit be extended, we need to 
know that. But my sense is, just as 
they want to extend it right now, they 
will want to extend it next year and 
the next year and the next year. 
So is this the right time to do that? 
Is this the right time to add that kind 
of stimulus to an economy that already 
is overstimulated, where you have 
more demand chasing not enough sup-
ply, do you want to add more to the de-
mand side? That is what is going to 
happen if we pass this. 
I hope that we will not make that 
mistake, and I hope that we will slow

December 14, 2021 
down and look at these numbers and 
analyze where we are in terms of our 
spending. We just extended the debt 
limit. No Republican voted for it, but 
all the Democrats voted for it, and that 
is all they needed to be able to extend 
the debt limit because it was under a 
special 50-vote margin. That debt limit 
was just extended for basically 1 year. 
So after the elections next year, $2.5 
trillion more debt. We had to make 
room for $2.5 trillion more debt, in 1 
year. 
It is clear that a lot of Americans are 
nervous about that. When you look at 
the polling data, it says that. But just 
talking to people—over the weekend, I 
was also in southeast Ohio, part of our 
State that is very rural, a lot of people 
are hurting in terms of the economy 
because they don’t have access to 
broadband and so on. So we are talking 
about how they feel about the econ-
omy, and there is a lot of nervousness. 
They feel the surging inflation. They 
are paying more for everything. 
And, you know, common steps, peo-
ple are saying, Let’s just slow down 
and think about this. They may end up 
thinking at the end of the day they are 
for some of this, but they don’t want to 
move forward precipitously and make a 
mistake and have this add more infla-
tion and more problems for our debt 
and deficit for our kids and grandkids. 
They are saying, Let’s do the right 
thing for the country and put the 
brakes on this. 
And if we do put the brakes on this 
unprecedented spending and taxing, it 
will help us to avoid some of these eco-
nomic challenges that we otherwise are 
going to be facing. If we go ahead with 
it, it is going to make the economic 
challenges like inflation even worse. 
My hope is that we will put the 
brakes on, and these economic chal-
lenges will not worsen, and instead, we 
can get the country back on the right 
track. 
I yield the floor.

sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘NASA En-
hanced Use Leasing Extension Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress find the following: 
(1) NASA uses enhanced use leasing to 
enter into agreements with private sector 
entities, State and local governments, aca-
demic institutions, and other Federal agen-
cies for lease of non-excess, underutilized 
NASA properties and facilities. 
(2) NASA uses enhanced use leasing au-
thority to support responsible management 
of its real property, including to improve the 
use of underutilized property for activities 
that are compatible with NASA’s mission 
and to reduce facility operating and mainte-
nance costs. 
(3) In fiscal year 2019, under its enhanced 
use lease authority, NASA leased 65 real 
properties. 
(4) In fiscal year 2019, NASA’s use of en-
hanced use leasing resulted in the collection 
of $10,843,025.77 in net revenue. 
(5) In fiscal year 2019, NASA used a portion 
of its enhanced use leasing revenues for re-
pairs of facility control systems such as 
lighting and heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning. 
(6) NASA’s use of enhanced use leasing au-
thority can contribute to reducing the rate 
of increase of the Agency’s overall deferred 
maintenance cost.

INTO LEASES OF NON-EXCESS PROP-
ERTY 
OF

MORNING BUSINESS 
RECOGNIZING THE 2021 KEYNOTE 
ADDRESS 
AT 
THE 
24TH 
VERMONT 
WOMEN’S 
ECONOMIC 
OPPORTUNITY CONFERENCE 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
would like to take a moment to recog-
nize Xusana Davis, who delivered the 
keynote address for Vermont’s 24th An-
nual Women’s Economic Opportunity 
Conference earlier this year. Each 
year, Marcelle and I host this con-
ference to bring together Vermonters 
to learn how to navigate, grow, and 
succeed in today’s workplace. While 
public health concerns led to an online 
conference this year, the dedication of 
the women who participated shone 
through. I hope the participants were 
as inspired by Ms. Davis’s words as I 
was. 
Xusana Davis is Vermont’s first Ex-
ecutive Director of Racial Equity and 
was appointed in 2019 by Vermont Gov-
ernor Phil Scott. In her position as the 
Director of Racial Equity, she works 
with Vermont agencies and commu-
nities to address systemic racial dis-
parities, ensures the State’s operations 
meet its equity goals and objectives, 
and guides policy on equity issues. She 
offered an insightful view of how we 
can all advance equity in our commu-
nities and offered her remarks with 
grace and eloquence. 
Ms. Davis’s leadership comes at a 
time when we continue to see great 
need for equity in the workplace. The 
pandemic has worsened preexisting dis-
parities that have effected women, es-
pecially those who identify with his-
torically marginalized communities. 
As Ms. Davis emphasizes in her speech, 
we must all work to promote equity as 
we collectively participate in our Na-
tion’s economic recovery. I would like 
to share her inspiring words by submit-
ting them for inclusion in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD in the hopes that 
we may all take her message to heart. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
them printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

‘‘OPPORTUNITY IS NOT A FUNGIBLE GOOD’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9158 
December 14, 2021 
Hola, buenos dı´as, everyone. As you might 
have heard, the Executive Director of Racial 
Equity is a relatively new position for 
Vermont state government. While it got its 
share of fanfare in the summer of 2019 when 
I was first appointed, I’d like to share with 
you a little bit of the work we’ve been doing 
since then. We’ve worked hard with our sis-
ter agencies across state government on in-
ternal and external-facing policy. Things 
like the Fair and Impartial Policing policy, 
stimulus funds to get communities through 
tough times at the outset of the pandemic, 
and how we provide health services to people 
by treating the whole person. We’ve been 
poking our noses into conversations all over 
the state to help people at the local level fig-
ure out how to grow—or at least retain— 
their town populations. And of course, we’ve 
been a sounding board for leaders of all kinds 
who want to take bold action to be and do 
better on matters of equity. 
But you probably knew all that. What you 
may not have known is that all of this work 
is bigger than race and ethnicity. It always 
has been. This work is essential in all cor-
ners of the state and in every sector, because 
there’s a collective benefit to equity, and a 
collective harm to inequity. But before we 
jump into that, let’s back up a bit . . . 
First, let’s talk about ‘‘opportunity.’’ Do 
you ever notice that we talk about ‘‘oppor-
tunity’’ like it’s a fungible good? Like it’s 
some sort of coupon that we can pass to the 
person behind us in the checkout line. We 
talk about ‘‘giving’’ opportunities. Or ‘‘seiz-
ing’’ them—maybe you’re a bit more aggres-
sive, and that’s okay! Or we talk about ‘‘cre-
ating’’ opportunities, as if they can just ma-
terialize. 
But out of all the verbs we choose to de-
ploy on these opportunities, there’s always 
the implication that there’s a transfer. That 
there’s a person who holds or creates oppor-
tunities, and that the rest of us are just try-
ing to get a piece. That’s our first mistake— 
thinking that an opportunity is something 
that must be given or surrendered to us, 
something that we must wrestle from some-
one’s firm grip. And there are a few reasons 
for this thinking: After all, there’s a lot of 
money to be made from commodifying ‘‘girl 
power.’’ We can produce highly dramatized 
films about long-ignored women historical 
figures. Or sell a self-help book about how to 
be the next successful businesswoman who 
‘‘can have it all.’’ But for a lot of us, the bar-
riers to opportunity are not something we 
can unlock with three easy payments of 
$39.99 but wait, there’s more. No, many of 
the barriers to opportunity are systemic. 
They are structural. They are bigger than 
any of us as individuals, but they absolutely 
impact all of us as individuals. 
That’s what I meant when I said racial eq-
uity is bigger than race. You see, when we 
think of women’s economic opportunity, 
many people incorrectly assume that these 
opportunities are only for the benefit of 
women. They are not. Women are 51 % of the 
U.S. population—we’re not a ‘‘special inter-
est.’’ We are the interest. Something that 
impacts the numerical majority is inevitably 
something that impacts the whole. Think 
about it: Childcare. Reproductive justice. 
You think these are only women’s issues? 
Well, have you ever been a child? Or cared 
about a child? Then childcare and child de-
velopment should matter to you. I’m re-
minded of the late Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia, who for years was, well, 
rather indignant about parental leave and 
childcare issues. He didn’t get it and he 
didn’t want to get it . . . until his daughter 
had children and struggled to balance her pa-
rental duties with her professional life. Then 
suddenly Grandpa Scalia was dropping off 
children here and there, and babysitting, and 
you know what? He changed his stance. He 
suddenly realized that the burden did not 
simply fall on his adult daughter—and that 
even if it did, it shouldn’t have. And that’s 
the point: there are ripple effects to the ways 
in which we treat people in society. And 
when we talk about women’s economic op-
portunity like it’s a hobby or a solo mission, 
like it’s something that can be bartered or 
restricted to only during nap time, then 
we’re ignoring the network of people sur-
rounding us who will be impacted by those 
choices and resources. 
This is true in the racial equity space, too. 
In workshops and trainings, I often ask peo-
ple to consider the benefits and rights they 
enjoy today that were fought and won by 
people of color. For example, Ernesto Mi-
randa. Do you know him? You do . . . You 
just may not know you do. Ernesto Miranda 
is a Latino man who is the reason that you 
get read your Miranda rights if you get ar-
rested. Sylvia Mendez. Ring a bell? You 
know her—sure you do! She was on a postal 
stamp! Mendez v. Westminster. 1946. That’s 
the court case that gave us Brown v. Board. 
And Brown v. Board is the case that gave 
every child—including your child—the right 
to a free and fair basic education. Truth is, 
in the United States, every gain accom-
plished by members of dominant groups al-
ways benefits members of dominant groups, 
and only sometimes benefits members of his-
torically marginalized or oppressed groups. 
But every gain accomplished by historically 
oppressed groups always benefits members of 
dominant groups. Affirmative action. Do you 
know what is the number one beneficiary 
group of affirmative action policies in edu-
cation and employment in the U.S.? That’s 
right, White women. 
So when we think about equity and reduc-
ing structural, systemic barriers, there is al-
ways a collective benefit to equity. And 
that’s why Senator Leahy has been doing 
this conference since 1996—you think he 
likes making people wake up early on a Sat-
urday? No! Well, maybe . . . But really, it’s 
because he knows what’s been right in front 
of 
us 
all 
along—that 
when 
we 
stop 
disempowering people, we all move forward. 
We all win. And you know why? Because life 
isn’t zero-sum. And your winning does not 
equate my losing. 
And we know this now, but people didn’t 
always recognize this truth. Let’s think back 
to the women’s suffrage movement. Susan B. 
Anthony was pretty racist. That’s why peo-
ple like Sojourner Truth and, later, bell 
hooks had to ask the question ‘‘Ain’t I A 
Woman?’’ This is reflective of a bigger con-
cept—a concept you’ve likely heard of— 
called Intersectionality. Intersectionality is 
what makes us dynamic and multi-faceted. 
It’s what multiplies our strength as a move-
ment and as a community. Because I’m not 
just a woman. I’m also a person of color. I’m 
also a Millennial. I’m right-handed. These 
are only some of my many identities, and 
not even the more important ones. And when 
we allow ourselves to represent all of our 
selves, without letting it come between us, 
that’s 
when 
we 
will 
have 
used 
intersectionality for good. 
Of course, intersectionality sometimes has 
its thorns. Two days ago was Latina Wom-
en’s Equal Pay Day in the U.S. I’ll explain 
what that means: You see, we already know 
that in the U.S., women statistically make 
less money for the same work than men do. 
And separately, we also know that people of 
color statistically make less money for the 
same work than White people do. So statis-
tically speaking, my intersecting identities 
as a woman and as a person of color make 
me more likely to earn less than my male 
counterparts of all ethnicities, and less than 
my women-identified peers who are White. 
So what is Women’s Equal Pay Day? Well, 
it’s the symbolic date that represents how 
much more a woman has to work in order to 
match the earnings of a man in a given cal-
endar year. In 2021, Women’s Equal Pay Day 
was March 24th So that means if a woman 
and a man started working on Jan 1, 2020, 
then it would take the woman until March 24 
of this year to catch up to the earning of a 
man by Dec 31 of 2020. But that’s not the full 
story: for most women of color, Equal Pay 
Day comes much later. For example, Equal 
Pay Day for Asian American and Pacific Is-
lander women was March 9th. But for Black 
American women, it was August 3rd. For In-
digenous women in the U.S., Equal Pay Day 
was Sept 8th of this year. And for Latina 
women—that’s the bucket where you’ll find 
me—it was Oct 21st. So in other words, sta-
tistically speaking, I would have needed to 
work all of calendar year 2020, plus an addi-
tional 9 months and 3 weeks to earn the 
same that a White man earned in calendar 
year 2020. And remember intersectionality? 
Well, it goes beyond just race. There are dif-
ferent Equal Pay Days for mothers and for 
members of the LGBTQIA+ community. And 
I need to make an important point, one that 
my best friend frequently raises: the goal is 
not to look at what White men are doing and 
saying ‘‘Yeah, we want the right to do that 
. . .’’ That’s not the standard. It’s not about 
making the same money for the same work 
if that work is only fueling oppression and 
ecological harm. 
All of this is to say that it’s not enough to 
lump us all into one large bucket and think 
we’re doing enough. That’s not true equity. 
Equity means recognizing that within our 
communities there are certainly different 
challenges, but also different skill sets for 
finding solutions to those challenges. Trust 
each other more. Trust one another’s experi-
ence more. 
And on the topic of trust, and speaking of 
solutions, let’s think about how we can we 
turn this dialogue towards action. First 
things first: action by whom? Who gets to do 
the thing? And who gets to decide what the 
thing is? If your rights and liberties are re-
stricted and determined by someone else, 
then your power is contingent upon them 
giving you permission to exercise it. Like 
asking men who can vote to vote on whether 
you can vote. As Upton Sinclair said, ‘‘It is 
difficult to get a man to understand some-
thing when his salary depends on his not un-
derstanding.’’ Or holding hearings on repro-
ductive justice without any women present— 
don’t ever forget: ‘‘nothing about us without 
us.’’ 
So we’re through asking for permission. 
For those who want to join us in advancing 
justice, what we need is genuine and sincere 
support. And support is different from per-
mission—it is not about asking to be ‘‘given’’ 
opportunities, and it is not about having to 
‘‘seize’’ them either. It’s about the recogni-
tion that opportunity just exists—it always 
has. And the question is not whether or how 
to grant it, but rather, how to stop blocking 
it. This is an important point: People often 
see equity work as some kind of handout, as 
if people who have been oppressed are asking 
to be given something. Incorrect. What’s 
needed is that we stop actively blocking and 
suppressing people’s ability to move and 
thrive and grow and exist. That’s the key. 
So how do we stop blocking? Well, first we 
must make meaningful investments of time, 
effort, and finances—not token gestures. It 
means when we talk about mentorship, we 
don’t just shuttle women into the same 
paths where they still wind up working for 
rich men to make those men richer. It means 
when your staff tell you they want you to re-
vise workplace policies because they un-
justly 
prejudice 
your 
women-identified

workers, you listen. And don’t just listen for 
the sake of saying ‘‘Okay, we listened and 
we’re still going to keep doing things the 
same way we’ve always done them because 
that’s how we’ve always done them . . .’’ it 
means listening for the purpose of action. 
Take a broad view: if you don’t provide pa-
rental leave to a male employee, you know 
who suffers? A new mother who might have 
to delay her re-entry into the workforce— 
perhaps permanently—because her partner 
can’t participate in childrearing duties. 
That’s a withholding of a women’s economic 
opportunity. And you need to turn your ther-
mostats up in the office. I’m serious—this 
has ‘‘Patriarchy’’ written all over it. You 
see, the so-called ideal office temperature is 
based on a formula that calculated the aver-
age of workers’ resting metabolic rates, but 
the workers in question were all men, an av-
erage of 40 old, and an average of 154 pounds. 
Oh, and they were wearing suits and ties. To-
day’s workforce doesn’t look the same. There 
are women in the workforce—and remember, 
the rigid gender binary has created the ex-
pectation that women wear things like 
skirts and sandals in warmer months, so the 
clothing differences already create more ex-
posure for us. We also have seniors working 
longer before retirement, so the workforce 
also has an aging population that may be 
more thermosensitive. 
That’s what we mean when we say inequity 
is ‘‘systemic’’—the formulas are actually 
built in to our lives through infrastructure, 
fashion, and employment practices. So any-
way, when half the office is shivering and 
stepping into the service stairwell every cou-
ple hours to thaw out, you need to bump up 
the temperature. 
So as I bring my remarks to a close, I want 
to share with you a quote from James 
Joyce’s Ulysses, in which the speaker says 
‘‘We feel in England that we have treated 
you rather unfairly. It seems history is to 
blame.’’ And I really enjoy that line because 
it speaks to how we distance ourselves from 
the oppression of others. You see, by stating 
that ‘‘history’’ is to blame, it implies [a] 
that there was nothing we could have done 
about it, and [b] that we’re not responsible 
for fixing things. But of course, that isn’t 
true. We are absolutely in control of how we 
invest, how we govern, how we vote, and how 
we envision ‘‘opportunity.’’ As you engage 
with workshops, panels, and networking set-
tings throughout today’s event, keep these 
things in mind: who is at the table, who is 
missing, which intersecting identities are at 
play here, and who shapes the agenda for ac-
tion. Remember what Senator Leahy said: ‘‘a 
stronger and more equitable economy.’’ We 
can get there, but it must include all of us 
. . . whatever your career might be, equity is 
still your job. Thank you for your time.

BUDGETARY REVISIONS 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, S. 
Con. Res. 14, the fiscal year 2022 con-
gressional budget resolution, included 
a reserve fund in section 3003 to allow 
the chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget to revise budget aggregates and 
committee allocations for legislation 
that would not increase the deficit over 
the period of fiscal years 2022 to 2031. 
The Senate will soon consider S. 1605, 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2022, as amended by 
the House, which meets the condition 
of not increasing the deficit over the 
relevant 10-year period. As such, I am 
filing a revision to the aggregates and 
committee allocations under the budg-
et resolution, which were last revised 
on December 9. Specifically, the Con-
gressional Budget Office estimates that 
the anti-fraud provisions in the bill 
would increase both direct spending 
and revenues by $23 million over 5 
years and $72 million over 10 years. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustment, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT SEAN 
MCDONALD 
Mr. KING. Madam President, today I 
wish to recognize LT Sean McDonald, 
U.S. Navy, for his outstanding work on 
behalf of the people of Maine and the 
Nation as a 2021 Department of Defense 
Legislative Fellow serving in my Wash-
ington, DC, office. Lieutenant McDon-
ald has been integral to shaping my 
foreign policy and national security 
priorities and helped secure a number 
of provisions in the fiscal year 2022 Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act— 
FY22 NDAA—that will make our coun-
try stronger and safer. Lieutenant 
McDonald’s contributions, both to of-
fice morale and to our collective work 
product, are representative of his good 
character, 
competence, 
and 
strong 
work ethic. 
Throughout his tenure in my office, 
Lieutenant McDonald demonstrated a 
level of professionalism and hard work 
I have come to expect—but that I do 
not take for granted—from Department 
of Defense Legislative Fellows. Indeed, 
Lieutenant McDonald follows a long 
line of accomplished U.S. Navy and Ma-
rine Corps officers who have made 
impactful contributions to my office 
and to U.S. national security policy. 
Over the course of the year, Lieutenant 
McDonald prepared and personally ad-
vised me on wide-ranging and complex 
matters under consideration before the 
Senate Armed Services Committee. 
Lieutenant 
McDonald 
brought 
his 
naval expertise to bear to help secure 
authorization for the procurement of 
additional Arleigh Burke-class destroy-
ers in the FY22 NDAA, a critical capa-
bility for the U.S. fleet and a boon to 
the Maine shipbuilding workforce. He 
also helped guide my work as chairman 
of the Subcommittee on Strategic 
Forces during my inaugural year in 
this position, helping craft policy on 
nuclear and strategic forces, missile 
defense, and space programs. Further, 
during the withdrawal of U.S. forces in 
Afghanistan, 
Lieutenant 
McDonald 
provided clear-headed and thoughtful 
analysis on the withdrawal and liaised 
with representatives from the White 
House, State Department, and Depart-
ment of Defense to convey my posi-
tions and concerns. His candor and 
honest assessments provided critical 
insights during this challenging time, 
and our Nation is better because of it. 
On behalf of my colleagues and the 
U.S. Congress, I thank Lieutenant 
McDonald for his dedicated service to 
my staff, the U.S. Navy, and the Na-
tion. I wish him all the best and know 
that he will excel in his next endeav-
ors.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL C. NELSEN 
∑ Mr. LEE. Madam President, it is an 
honor to stand here today to recognize 
and celebrate the career of Police Chief 
Michael C. Nelsen of the Brigham City 
Police Department. For the last 42 
years, he has diligently served and pro-
tected the people of Brigham City. His 
positive impact on the lives of many 
will be remembered as he transitions 
into retirement. 
I wonder if, as a young pre-law stu-
dent at Rick’s College in Rexburg, ID, 
Mike Nelsen ever sat back to imagine 
the impact his life would have on so 
many others? I wonder if, as a student 
of criminal, justice administration at 
Brigham 
Young 
University, 
Mike 
Nelsen ever dreamed of leading a police 
department to new heights and great 
successes? However, I hope that at the 
sunset of an impressive career, Chief 
Nelsen realizes the significance of the 
mark he has left on the lives of count-
less others and the new heights and 
great successes he has achieved. 
During his career as a police officer, 
Chief 
Nelsen 
climbed

ranks. He rose from corporal, to ser-
geant, to lieutenant, and—most nota-
bly—to chief. Yet, despite the grandeur 
of his rise through the ranks, he always 
remained a faithful and committed 
public servant. Humility, sacrifice, and 
character have all been exemplified 
during his years of police work. 
Early in his career, Chief Nelsen 
earned a reputation for being willing to 
go the extra mile. From day l, he set a 
standard for community engagement 
outside of day to day policing. Perhaps 
the 
best 
example 
of 
this 
extra-
curricular community engagement is 
Chief Nelsen’s avid support of the Spe-
cial Olympics. 
Despite his many responsibilities as a 
police officer, Chief Nelsen has dedi-
cated hours of service to his role as the 
director of the Box Elder Torch Run for 
the Special Olympics. For his service, 
he has had the honor to run in the 
International Torch Run for the Spe-
cial Olympics in Alaska and to carry 
the Olympic Torch for the 2002 Winter 
Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. He 
has been an emissary of Brigham City 
and of Utah to the world. 
Public servants like Chief Nelsen de-
serve high praise. Their dedicated and 
faithful service sets an example for 
those who follow in their footsteps. I 
know that Chief Nelsen will be missed. 
However, thanks to the foundation 
that Chief Nelsen has laid over the last 
four decades, I have no doubt that the 
department will continue to flourish. 
I am grateful to Chief Nelsen for the 
commitment he has shown to a dif-
ficult, but meaningful job. Without in-
dividuals like him willing to shoulder 
this responsibility, our communities 
would not prosper as they do. Both he 
and his family have faithfully made 
sacrifices for the good of their commu-
nity for decades. I thank them for their 
dedication. As Chief Nelsen transitions 
into retirement, I hope he does so 
knowing that his community has pros-
pered as a result of his service and the 
memory of his servant leadership will 
live on.∑

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL, Mr. BOOKER, 
Mr. BROWN, Mr. MENENDEZ, Mr. 
MURPHY, Mr. PADILLA, and Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE): 
S. 3387. A bill to require the search 
and retention of certain records with 
respect to conducting criminal back-
ground checks, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, I am reintroducing legislation 
that would help bolster the Nation’s 
background check system for firearms. 
Under current law, the FBI is forced 
to remove records from incomplete 
background checks from their systems 
if those checks are not finalized within 
90 days. As a result, many firearms are 
sold without completed background 
checks—a dangerous practice that al-
lows individuals to access a firearm 
even if they are prohibited by law from 
possessing such weapons. 
In 
2020, 
Americans 
purchased 
a 
record number of guns—over 23 million 
firearms—and this year is expected to 
set records once again. That record 
number of purchases is overwhelming 
our background check system. 
The large majority of background 
checks are straightforward and are 
completed within 3 days, but especially 
due to the volume of checks required 
by the increase in gun purchases, some 
can take significantly longer. 
According to Everytown for Gun 
Safety, between March 2020 and July 
2020, the FBI was unable to resolve 
207,694 background checks within 90 
days and was therefore required to 
wipe the incomplete checks from their 
systems. 
Since 
these 
background 
checks were never completed, it is im-
possible to know how many firearms 
were transferred to prohibited pur-
chasers. 
As firearms sales continue to soar, 
Congress must act to protect public 
safety by ensuring background checks 
are completed. 
This bill would do exactly that. It 
would allow the FBI to maintain gun 
purchase records until the background 
checks is completed. It would also re-
quire the FBI to query additional rel-
evant databases as part of a firearm-re-
lated background check. This would 
guarantee that the information nec-
essary for conducting effective firearm 
background checks is maintained. 
I thank Senators BLUMENTHAL, BOOK-
ER, 
BROWN, 
MENENDEZ, 
MURPHY, 
PADILLA, and WHITEHOUSE
for their 
support and urge the rest of my col-
leagues to support the bill as well.

which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 479 
Whereas, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘CDC’’)— 
(1) 34,200,000 individuals in the United 
States have diabetes; and 
(2) an estimated 88,000,000 individuals in 
the United States who are 18 years of age or 
older have prediabetes; 
Whereas diabetes is a serious chronic con-
dition that affects individuals of every age, 
race, ethnicity, and income level; 
Whereas the CDC reports that— 
(1) Hispanic Americans, African Ameri-
cans, Asian Americans, and Native Ameri-
cans are disproportionately affected by dia-
betes and develop the disease at much higher 
rates than the general population of the 
United States; and 
(2) an estimated 21.4 percent of individuals 
with diabetes in the United States have not 
yet been diagnosed with the disease; 
Whereas, in the United States, more than 
10.5 percent of the population, including 26.8 
percent of individuals who are 65 years of age 
or older, have diabetes; 
Whereas, of the 18,820,000 veterans in the 
United States, 1 in 4 are receiving care for 
diabetes from the Department of Veterans 
Affairs; 
Whereas the risk of developing type 2 dia-
betes at some point in life is 40 percent for 
adults in the United States; 
Whereas, according to the American Diabe-
tes Association, the United States spent an 
estimated $237,000,000,000 on direct medical 
costs for cases of diagnosed diabetes in 2017, 
and out-of-pocket costs for insulin have 
grown significantly in recent years for many 
patients; 
Whereas the American Diabetes Associa-
tion reports that care for people with diag-
nosed diabetes accounts for 1 in 4 health care 
dollars spent in the United States; 
Whereas the cost of health care is esti-
mated to be 2.3 times higher for individuals 
in the United States with diabetes than 
those without diabetes; 
Whereas, as of November 2021, a cure for di-
abetes does not exist; 
Whereas there are successful means to re-
duce the incidence, and delay the onset, of 
type 2 diabetes;

TEXT OF AMENDMENTS 
SA 4893. Ms. CANTWELL proposed an 
amendment to the bill H.R. 5746, to 
amend title 51, United States Code, to 
extend the authority of the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration 
to enter into leases of non-excess prop-
erty of the Administration; as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘NASA En-
hanced Use Leasing Extension Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress find the following: 
(1) NASA uses enhanced use leasing to 
enter into agreements with private sector 
entities, State and local governments, aca-
demic institutions, and other Federal agen-
cies for lease of non-excess, underutilized 
NASA properties and facilities. 
(2) NASA uses enhanced use leasing au-
thority to support responsible management 
of its real property, including to improve the 
use of underutilized property for activities 
that are compatible with NASA’s mission 
and to reduce facility operating and mainte-
nance costs. 
(3) In fiscal year 2019, under its enhanced 
use lease authority, NASA leased 65 real 
properties. 
(4) In fiscal year 2019, NASA’s use of en-
hanced use leasing resulted in the collection 
of $10,843,025.77 in net revenue. 
(5) In fiscal year 2019, NASA used a portion 
of its enhanced use leasing revenues for re-
pairs of facility control systems such as 
lighting and heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning. 
(6) NASA’s use of enhanced use leasing au-
thority can contribute to reducing the rate

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
BRANDON 
BULLDOGS AS MHSAA 6A SOUTH 
STATE CHAMPIONS 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I’d like to 
congratulate the Brandon Bulldogs and Coach 
Sam Williams on their MHSAA 6A South State 
Championship victory. Coach Williams led the 
talented team to an impressive 11–3 season 
with stunning wins over some of the best 
teams in the state. I commend Coach Williams 
for his success at the helm of the Bulldogs 
football team and wish him and his team con-
tinued success in the future. 
I would also like to extend my congratula-
tions to the young men who worked tirelessly 
for their successful season. Every early morn-
ing, every extra rep, and every sacrifice they 
made to better themselves and their team re-
sulted in victory time and time again until they 
became one of the best high school football 
programs in Mississippi. 
l would encourage those young men to re-
flect deeply on the investment they made to 
realize such a successful season. They will 
never forget the feeling of their great accom-
plishment; but in the future, as they reminisce 
on this season, I would challenge them to re-
member the qualities that made them one of 
the best teams in the entire state. 
Those qualities of hard-work, commitment, 
and determination will continue to serve them 
well in the future as they transition from lead-
ers on the field to leaders in their families, 
communities, state, and Nation. 
Congratulations to the Brandon Bulldogs on 
their very successful season.

CONGRATULATING 
THE 
SCHUYLERVILLE BLACK HORSES 
ON AN IMPRESSIVE FOOTBALL 
SEASON AND EARNING A STATE 
CHAMPIONSHIP BERTH 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the Schuylerville High 
School football team on their impressive sea-
son and hard-fought championship game. 
The Schuylerville Black Horses, led by head 
coach John Bowen, handily won the state 
semifinal game 52–14, defeating Dobbs Ferry. 
The Black Horses had a season high rushing 
total in the state semifinal. The undefeated 
Black Horses carried this momentum with 
them into the championship game but came 
up just short of clenching their first state 
championship title. 
The Black Horses played hard throughout 
the entire game and put up a valiant effort in 
the Syracuse Carrier Dome. This loss ended 
the Schuylerville Black Horse’s impressive 
winning streak, but they displayed a physical 
and mental toughness beyond their years this 
season. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional 
District, I would like to congratulate the 
Schuylerville Black Horses on their tremen-
dous 2021 football season, culminating in a 
formidable effort at the state championship. 
We are very proud of their hard work and 
dedication throughout this season.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOSEPH 
ALLEN BREAUX, JR. 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to the life and legacy of Lumberton 
Police Department Officer, Lieutenant Joseph 
Allen ‘‘Joey’’ Breaux, Jr. Lieutenant Breaux 
passed away on Saturday, December 11, 
2021, after a long journey with cancer. 
The oldest of three children, Lieutenant 
Breaux was born to parents Joseph and Helen 
Breaux on August 8, 1968, in Silsbee, Texas. 
Like his brother, Steven, and sister, Julie, 
Lieutenant Breaux was a graduate of Lum-
berton High School. He was a kicker for their 
high school football team and held a record for 
his 51-yard field goal for many years. 
Lieutenant Breaux began his law enforce-
ment career in 1989 as a dispatcher in 
Silsbee, Texas. In 1990, he graduated from 
the Lamar University Regional Police Acad-
emy. Two years later, Lieutenant Breaux 
joined the Lumberton Police Department 
where, unknowingly at the time, he would 
serve the surrounding community with love 
and tireless devotion for the next 29 years as 
a patrolman, investigator, and criminal justice 
teacher. As a beloved member of the law en-
forcement community, he will be remembered 
for his friendship and mentorship to fellow offi-
cers, his kindness and compassion to those 
he encountered while on patrol, and his out-
standing moral character. 
Lieutenant Breaux met his wonderful wife, 
Molly, in 1988. Love flourished, and the couple 
were married in 1990. He and Molly share two 
daughters together, Harley and Kaylee. Over 
the years, he never missed an opportunity to 
cherish and spoil them. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to acknowl-
edge the life of Lieutenant Joseph Allen 
‘‘Joey’’ Breaux, Jr. and his 32 years of law en-
forcement service. My heartfelt prayers remain 
with his family and friends during this difficult 
time. 
HONORING ANTHONY WAYNE 
HALBY 
HON. DOUG LaMALFA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, today I 
would like to recognize the life and service of 
my friend, Anthony Wayne Halby. 
Anthony was a 40-year resident in Nevada 
County, a devout family-man with a heart of 
gold. His hard work and devotion to our com-
munity will be felt for generations. He will be 
missed by all of us. 
In 1971, Anthony graduated from Woodbury 
Business College in Los Angeles; married 
Charlene his wife of 40-years and started his 
business, The Halby Group. During his career 
Anthony built a very successful business 
where he was known as an, ‘excellent sales-
man with integrity.’ His work ethic was to al-
ways help people and ensure that they re-
ceived the very best value. 
One of Anthony’s many contributions to our 
area was his service to our first responders 
through his work on the Nevada County Law 
Enforcement and Fire Protection Council. 
Since the organizations beginning in 1999, 
they have raised and donated more than $1 
million worth of equipment, support, and train-
ing for local first responders. They also hold 
the Nevada County Red Light Ball celebrating 
the hard work and dedication of our first re-
sponders. Anthony was a massive part in or-
ganizing and ensuring this celebration oc-
curred. Every year, we can look forward to the 
Red Light Ball and the recognition of our First 
Responders. I have many fond memories at-
tending this event and seeing the outpouring 
of community support for our first responders. 
Anthony was someone you could count on 
and turn to. In my many trips to Nevada Coun-
ty, I will always have fond memories of stop-
ping by to see him and catching up on world 
events, or just to have a few minutes with a 
friend. 
The only thing we never agreed about was 
baseball and muscle cars as he was a de-
voted Dodgers fan and a Corvette guy, as I 
drive Mustangs and root for the Giants, our ri-
valry was among friends. 
Anthony enjoyed spending his weekends 
driving his Corvette around Northern California 
and was an active member of his local Cor-
vette club. 
Anthony was a patriot who loved our Coun-
try and a wonderful friend and will be greatly 
missed by all. Upon his passing, he leaves to 
cherish his memory and celebrate his legacy 
his wife Charlene, their five children: Gabriella, 
Matthew, Mark, Michael, and Joseph; eight 
grandchildren; and numerous other family 
members and friends. Today, I stand beside 
Charlene and their family in this time of sorrow 
and profound personal loss. May God bless 
my friend. He is not forgotten.

HONORING MR. SOHUM PAWAR 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor an essential member of our team that 
worked to evacuate vulnerable Afghans during 
the fall of Kabul, Mr. Sohum Pawar. 
Originally from East Hanover, New Jersey, 
for many years, Mr. Pawar has worn many 
hats—scientist, 
engineer, 
and 
policy 
re-
searcher. Since graduating with honors from 
little-known schools such as Harvard Univer-
sity and Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, he’s worked on cybersecurity, climate, 
and energy policy at the White House, as-
sisted negotiators at the U.S. Department of 
State working on UN climate talks, and written 
speeches for the administrator of the U.S. En-
vironmental Protection Agency. 
Beyond public service, he’s also worked as 
a cyber threat intelligence analyst, assessed 
clean energy startups for a climate-focused 
venture capital fund, and developed policy and 
strategy for an advanced nuclear reactor start-
up. He also has experience in journalism, con-
ducting research for David Sanger, the promi-
nent national journalist for the New York 
Times and his bestselling book chronicling the 
rise of cyber warfare. 
The knowledge and experience Mr. Pawar 
acquired in all of these ventures were heavily 
relied upon when he joined our cobbled-to-
gether effort working to evacuate vulnerable 
Afghans from Kabul. For several sleepless 
nights, he was part of our tiger team—respon-
sible for gathering the required information for 
the group of Afghans, verifying the authenticity 
of documents, and supporting evacuees with 
letters of support of our own. 
Our mission depended on a broad cross- 
section of skills and traits, from perseverance 
to grit. Very few people could have handled 
the flood of information that our office received 
during those frantic days, and even fewer as 
quickly and efficiently as Sohum did. We 
needed Pawar power to succeed, and it is 
thanks to him that we did. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Mr. Sohum 
Pawar for his willingness to go above and be-
yond the call of duty in our effort to evacuate 
Afghan allies from Kabul. For his meticulous 
record keeping, for his flexibility and persever-
ance, and for his dogged pursuit of any lead 
that would benefit the mission, I submit these 
words—may they stand as a tribute to his 
dedicated service when the moment called for 
it most.

RECOGNIZING THE MADISON CEN-
TRAL JAGUARS AS MHSAA 6A 
STATE CHAMPIONS 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I’d like to 
congratulate the Madison Central Jaguars and 
Coach Toby Collums on their MHSAA 6A 
State Championship victory. In his first year, 
Coach Collums led the Jaguars to a 13–1 sea-
son and finished the season with a victory at 
the state championship. I commend Coach 
Collums for his explosive start at the helm of 
the Jaguars football team and wish him and 
his team continued success in the future. 
I would also like to extend my congratula-
tions to the young men who worked tirelessly 
for the championship trophy. Every early 
morning, every extra rep, and every sacrifice 
they made to better themselves and their team 
has resulted in the top prize. 
In the coming days, as the thrill of victory 
begins to fade, I would encourage those 
young men to reflect deeply on the investment 
they made to realize this championship. They 
will never forget the feeling of their great ac-
complishment; but in the future, as they remi-
nisce on this victory, I would challenge them 
to remember the qualities that made them 
champions. 
Those qualities of hard-work. commitment, 
and determination will continue to serve them 
well in the future as they transition from lead-
ers on the field to leaders in their families, 
communities, state, and Nation. 
Congratulations to the Madison Central Jag-
uars. They earned this victory.

RECOGNIZING KERRY BLACK ON 
THE OCCASION OF HER RETIRE-
MENT 
HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Kerry Black of the South 
Dade Chamber of Commerce on the occasion 
of her retirement. Mrs. Black’s career has 
touched the lives of many individuals in South 
Florida and throughout the world. She special-
izes in improving organizational culture and 
establishing healthy, thriving companies. 
In August of 1991, Mrs. Black and her hus-
band, Russell Black, founded Latin Impact 
Ministries in order to develop a network of na-
tional church leaders. Latin Impact Ministries 
has reached over tens of thousands of Latinos 
and has developed hundreds of individuals 
and teams focusing on serving their commu-
nities. Today, Latin Impact Ministries has ex-
tended outreach to build schools, provide 
members of the community with access to a 
higher education, and promotes the collabora-
tion of strong leaders in the city to improve 
local and regional unity. 
Not only did Mrs. Black serve the underprivi-
leged, she empowered the South Dade entre-
preneurial community by serving as the CEO 
of the South Dade Chamber of Commerce 
from October 2017 to May 2021. The South 
Dade Chamber of Commerce is the second 
oldest standing chamber in Miami Dade Coun-
ty and is a critical resource for many of the 
community’s entrepreneurs. Under her leader-
ship, she reinvigorated the chamber by cre-
ating a new mission statement and following 
through on that promise. Because of her lead-
ership, the chamber experienced one of their 
best renewal seasons, leading to a restored 
reputation throughout the community. She in-
creased community visibility by participating in 
weekly podcasts hosted by Miami Community 
News. Throughout the pandemic, Mrs. Black 
ensured business leaders were still connected 
to the chamber and provided them with re-
sources and guidance. 
It is an honor to join the South Florida com-
munity in celebrating Kerry Black’s retirement. 
As she celebrates an extensive career of serv-
ice, I am grateful for all the work she has done 
to serve the needs of South Florida busi-
nesses, entrepreneurs, and members of our 
community.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Matthew Nich-
olas Sutherland. Matthew is a very special 
young man who has exemplified the finest 
qualities of citizenship and leadership by tak-
ing an active part in the Boy Scouts of Amer-

Matthew has also contributed to his commu-
nity through his Eagle Scout project. Matthew

to complete. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Matthew Nicholas Suther-
land for his accomplishments with the Boy 
Scouts of America and for his efforts put forth 
in achieving the highest distinction of Eagle

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF ELDER LOVELL JEROME JEN-

HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the life and legacy of my cousin, 
Elder Lovell Jerome Jenkins, an eminent pas-
tor and educator who passed away on De-
cember 1, 2021, at 66 years old. 
Elder Lovell Jenkins was born first of four 
children on December 23, 1954, in Hope Hull, 
Alabama; to Dorothy Gardner Jenkins and the 
late Reverend Leroy Jenkins. After graduating 
with honors from Calhoun High School in 
1971, Lovell received his Bachelor of Science 
in Mathematics from Alabama State Univer-
sity. 
Accepting Christ into his life at a young age 
under the pastorate of his grandfather, the late 
Elder Tom Gardner, Jr., Lovell was a faithful 
member of Beulah Primitive Baptist Church in 
Hope Hull, Alabama. At Beulah, Lovell sang in 
the adult and male choruses until he received 
the divine call of God to preach the gospel. 
Lovell began his career in education serving 
as a math teacher and coach at Jefferson

Davis High School in Montgomery, Alabama. 
During his 36 years of service at Jefferson 
Davis High School, Lovell taught multiple 
courses, including business, math, geometry, 
algebra, and calculus. While at Jefferson 
Davis High School, he also served as the As-
sistant Basketball Coach. 
In addition to his career as an educator, 
Lovell was also the beloved pastor of the 
Canaan Hill Primitive Baptist Church in 
Lowndes County, Alabama, where he served 
for twenty years. He accepted the Call of min-
istry in 2000, and after being installed as pas-
tor of Canaan Hill Primitive Baptist Church in 
2001, Lovell dedicated his life to teaching the 
word of God. As pastor of Canaan Hill Primi-
tive Baptist Church, Lovell worked to develop 
the church by forming various departments 
and working with organizations throughout the 
Montgomery community, including the forma-
tion of a mission and matron department, the 
young adult choir, and a partnership with the 
Montgomery Biscuits for a family and friends 
day fundraiser. Also, under his leadership, 
Deacon Emory McGhee Sr. and Deacon 
Bobby Bennett were ordained, the Board of 
Trustees was established, restrooms were 
made handicap accessible, a new air condi-
tioning unit was purchased, along with the pur-
chase and renovation of the property behind 
the church itself. 
Elder Lovell Jenkins was preceded in death 
by his son Lovell Jermaine Jenkins, his father 
Reverend Leroy Jenkins, and his brother Jeff-
ery Lydell Jenkins. 
He is survived by his devoted and loving 
wife Marcia Royal Jenkins, mother Dorothy 
(Eddie) Sanders; three sons Cortez (Nicole) 
Jenkins, 
Jawuan 
(Queena) 
Jenkins, 
and 
Llewellyn (Tarrient) Royal; three daughters De’ 
Andra (Derrick) Bolling, Tamika Wray Dixon, 
Ann Marie Upthegrove; two sisters, Vanessa 
(Mark) Pettway and Felicia (James) Kelley; 
three sisters-in-law Norma Lyons, Nair Gib-
bons, Doreen (Michael) Layne, one brother-in- 
law Alston Royal; thirteen grandchildren Cam-
eron, Caden, Jaxen, and Jaden Jenkins, Deja 
(Jarred) Turner, Vallet Upthegrove, Beau Har-
vest, Asa Bolling, Llewellyn Royal, Jr., Juirien 
Royal and Akira Williams, Maliyah and Makari 
Dixon; six great-grandchildren Jarred, Jr., 
Joan, Jade, Jayla, Jamya and Carter; four 
god-children, Consquelo (Kenneth) Bell, Kelvin 
Thomas, Jr., Delshaun and Faith Gatson; four 
aunts Negatha Holt, Gloria (Frank) Humphrey, 
Theresa (Charlie) Douglass, and Delphia Jen-
kins; four uncles, Elder Tom (Estella) Gardner, 
Reverend Mack (Ruby) Jenkins and Willis 
Jenkins, and John (Barbara) Gardner; six 
nieces Markia and Gabrielle Pettway, Karen 
Banks, Hazel Samuel, Sherilyn (Howard) 
Houston and Alexandria Johnson, devoted 
friends, Elder Dwight and Cheryl Johnson, and 
a host of cousins, friends and students. 
On a personal note, Lovell was my amaz-
ingly thoughtful and loving first cousin who ra-
diated goodness and kindness to all he met 
and to those he loved. A man of tremendous 
faith whose guidance and tutelage of his stu-
dents, parishioners and family members was 
an inspiration to all. Lovell loved his family and 
showed it in his smile, his laughter, and his 
generous heart. He was tender with his loving 
wife Marcia, gentle in the care of his beloved 
mother Dorothy, supportive to his devoted sib-
lings, and instructive to his dear children. May 
we find comfort in knowing that Lovell’s legacy 
will live on in the many lives that he impacted. 
Rest in power, my sweet cousin. 
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the life and legacy of my cousin, 
Elder Lovell Jerome Jenkins and his exem-
plary contributions in education and ministry to 
the Montgomery community.

HONORING UNDERSHERIFF 
MICHAEL G. MCCABE 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Undersheriff Michael McCabe as he 
retires from the Oakland County Sheriff’s Of-
fice after 44 years of service. 
Born and raised in Bloomfield Township, 
Mike’s lifelong dream was to become a police 
officer. When he was a young child, he had 
been riding in the car with his mother and 
brother when they were involved in a traffic 
accident. Although thankfully no one was seri-
ously injured, Undersheriff McCabe still re-
members the Bloomfield Township police offi-
cer that came to take a statement in the hos-
pital. 
That seminal memory stuck with him as he 
attended Brother Rice High School alongside 
future Sheriff Mike Bouchard, and later, when 
he graduated from Michigan State University 
in 1977. Just four months after earning his de-
gree, Undersheriff McCabe joined the Oakland 
County Sheriff’s Office—earning one of six 
spots out of 800 applicants. The rest, as they 
say, is history. 
Over a career spanning more than four dec-
ades, he’s risen through the ranks, working in 
every division along the way—from patrol dep-
uty to detective to substation commander to 
chief of staff to now undersheriff and chief 
deputy, the position he’s held for nearly 18 
years. As the senior official responsible for 
day-to-day operations, his latest duties have 
included managing more than 1,400 employ-
ees and overseeing the $165 million annual 
budget. 
Undersheriff McCabe’s commitment to his 
fellow officers is the stuff of legend. In 1982, 
while responding to an armed robbery, his 
partner was critically wounded with gunshots 
to the chest and left shoulder. Without a mo-
ment’s hesitation, Undersheriff McCabe threw 
his fellow officer into the passenger’s seat of 
their patrol car and drove him to Crittenton 
Hospital—undoubtedly saving his partner’s life. 
Last year, when a routine doctor’s visit discov-
ered an issue that required him to go in for 
emergency surgery, he was reportedly an-
swering emails and returning phone calls from 
his room in the hospital. 
However, it is his actions in the last few 
weeks of his service that will serve as a last-
ing testament to Undersheriff McCabe’s her-
oism. On November 30, 2021, when a 15- 
year-old student at Oxford High School 
opened fire on his classmates, Undersheriff 
McCabe was one of the first responders to ar-
rive and he was on-site and in command as 
the senior officer in charge of the law enforce-
ment mobilization. He and his fellow officers 
answered the call—more than 100 in total that 
were frantically placed to 911—and without 
waiting to set up a perimeter or assess the 
danger, they ran into the high school and ap-
prehended the shooter before more lives were 
lost. As he had done before in his career, 
Undersheriff’s McCabe’s quick thinking saved 
lives. There is 110 question that there are 
teachers and students who are still here be-
cause of what he did and that his seasoned, 
experienced leadership helped mitigate and 
manage an unimaginable situation. For that, 
our community will forever be in his debt. 
Madam Speaker, even before the tragedy at 
Oxford High School, Undersheriff McCabe de-
served recognition from this chamber for his 
decades of service. That the coda to his ca-
reer is a moment in the national spotlight, as 
the face of a grieving community, only 
deepens it. 
Simply put, Undersheriff McCabe is the best 
of what Oxford, Michigan and Oakland County 
represents. There is nothing in the world that 
I wouldn’t give for his recognition to be under 
different circumstances, and yet, it is a small 
comfort to know that, in this moment of incred-
ible pain as we seek to pick up the pieces, he 
has been there as a steady hand and a guid-
ing force for his fellow neighbors. 
I rise today in profound thanks to Under-
sheriff Michael McCabe for 44 years of serv-
ice, and in honor of his actions throughout his 
career, and especially his final acts on the 
force. I ask that my colleagues join me in 
wishing him and his wife, Rebecca, a well-de-
served retirement.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE CAREER 
OF DR. JAMES HUNT 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. James W. Hunt, Jr., a lead-
er in community health and health care reform 
who has spent his 41-year career advocating 
for underserved communities and fighting for 
equitable and affordable healthcare for the 
people of Massachusetts. 
As president and CEO of the Massachusetts 
League of Community Health Centers, Dr. 
Hunt helped build a network of over 50 com-
munity health centers across the state. Born 
out of the civil rights movement, community 
health centers have been instrumental in 
health care reform. and have served over 1 
million underserved patients in Massachusetts. 
During his career, Dr. Hunt has worked hard 
to expand access to medical care for low-in-
come Massachusetts residents. He has helped 
secure hundreds of millions of dollars in fed-
eral funds to build up the state’s primary care 
network and to support the growing health 
care workforce of the Commonwealth. 
Madam Speaker, Dr. Hunt’s commitment to 
reforming our broken health care system can-
not be understated and is exemplified by his 
tireless efforts to expand quality medical care 
for those who often have the hardest time ac-
cessing it. Under his leadership, health cen-
ters have administered about 650,000 doses 
of the vaccines that protect against COVID–19 
to residents of Massachusetts—about 65 per-
cent of whom are people of color. 
Dr. Hunt began his tenure in public health 
as a volunteer at the Neponset Health Center 
in Dorchester, MA. Leaving behind a career as 
a civil engineer, he joined the Massachusetts

League of Community Health Centers in 1980 
and soon after became a leading force in 
community health and state health reform. Dr. 
Hunt’s advocacy has pushed health centers to 
the forefront of the fight for universal health 
care coverage in Massachusetts. 
Dr. Hunt stepped down as president and 
CEO of the Massachusetts League of Com-
munity Health Centers in December of 2020 
and held an emeritus position through June of 
2021. While he has stepped down from his 
role at the organization, this was not the end 
of Dr. Hunt’s work. Dr. Hunt is forward-think-
ing, human-oriented, and has been and will 
continue to be an integral part of transforming 
health care in Massachusetts to positively im-
pact the lives of the state’s most marginalized 
communities. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress and all the people in whose 
lives Dr. Hunt has made a positive difference, 
it is my great privilege and honor to thank and 
recognize Dr. James W. Hunt, Jr. for his tire-
less efforts to create a more just and equitable 
world.

CITY OF JENNINGS 75TH YEAR 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. CORI BUSH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. BUSH. Madam Speaker, St. Louis and 
I rise to congratulate the city of Jennings on 
their 75th anniversary. 
I am grateful to join in celebration of such a 
remarkable milestone. Like so many of my 
neighbors in Missouri’s First District, the city of 
Jennings holds a deep and special place in 
my heart. In addition to its vibrant community 
and resilient spirit, Jennings is also home to 
some of my fondest memories and experi-
ences. 
Jennings is responsible for the production of 
so many St. Louis staples that we all know 
and love. I am deeply honored to represent a 
place with such a rich history and even more 
grateful for what this community has contrib-
uted to our greater St. Louis region. I know 
there is so much more to come, and I am 
eager to be in continued partnership with our 
Jennings community leaders as we do the 
most for everyone, starting with those who 
have the very least. 
Congratulations again on 75 fruitful years. I 
have no doubt that the next 75 will be even 
greater.

RETIREMENT OF DIANE RANDALL, 
GENERAL SECRETARY OF THE 
FRIENDS 
COMMITTEE 
ON 
NA-
TIONAL LEGISLATION 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to express my appreciation for the power-
ful, persistent, and prophetic service of Diane 
Randall, who is stepping down from her role 
as General Secretary of the Friends Com-
mittee on National Legislation (FCNL) at the 
end of this year. 
FCNL is the 78-year-old Quaker lobby work-
ing to end war and the threat of war, advance 
social justice, and protect the Earth. In addi-
tion to its team of advocates in Washington, 
FCNL has built a network of thousands of 
people in all 50 states who advocate for those 
same values day-in and day-out. 
I have deeply valued working with Diane 
and her team as allies in my own work to end 
the forever wars, fight poverty and ensure a 
better life for all people at home and abroad. 
As a Quaker leader and a person of faith, 
Diane has brought a strong moral voice and 
the power of her Quaker community to policy 
discussions here in Washington. Her deep 
faith and belief in the inherent value of all peo-
ple have allowed her to work across partisan 
and ideological lines to achieve major, positive 
change. 
During her decade-long tenure, Diane vastly 
expanded FCNL’s advocacy staff in Wash-
ington and energized Quaker activists across 
the country. She built enduring coalitions with 
many different faith communities, joining with 
the heads of Washington offices of faith-based 
organizations, the Circle of Protection, and the 
Washington Interfaith Staff Community. 
In fact, I recall a dinner with faith leaders 
that Diane hosted a few years ago at FCNL’s 
Quaker Welcome Center. We discussed the 
intersection of poverty and racism, and from 
that dinner-discussion emerged a powerful 
statement: a Unity Declaration on Racism and 
Poverty signed by more than 80 prominent 
Christian leaders. 
I have seen first-hand how Diane has nur-
tured and challenged all of us to work toward 
her vision of the world we seek. FCNL’s won-
derful mission statement is something that I 
believe we should all champion: 
We seek a world free of war and the threat of 
war. 
We seek a society with equity and justice for 
all. 
We seek a community where every person’s 
potential may be fulfilled. 
We seek an earth restored. 
FCNL has been and continues to be a 
principled, effective and steadfast part-
ner in advancing that mission. They 
have been an integral part of our ef-
forts to repeal the 2001 and 2002 Author-
izations for Use of Military Force. 
FCNL is one of the few organizations 
that has been with me since September 
2001, supporting my lone vote against 
the war authorization, and continuing 
to campaign against the endless wars 
that resulted from one 60–word sen-
tence that was enacted into law over 
our objections. 
Under Diane’s leadership starting in 
2011, FCNL staff have been steadfast al-
lies, advocating to support my legisla-
tion to repeal these war authoriza-
tions. Their professional lobbyists as 
well as their citizen advocates tire-
lessly visited Hill offices, telling their 
own personal stories as well as making 
a logical case for why endless wars and 
endless Pentagon spending make all of 
us less secure. 
We work together on so many issues, 
from promoting racial justice at home 
to ending the drone wars to supporting 
the United Nations. Whether it is pro-
tecting the right to vote, protecting 
refugees and migrants, or protecting 
vulnerable people in developing coun-
tries, FCNL has been right there along-
side me. 
Although FCNL is a Quaker-led orga-
nization, its network includes many 
people of other faiths and non-religious 
people who are drawn to their prior-
ities and their vision for a better fu-
ture. Diane has particularly strength-
ened FCNL’s work on poverty and eco-
nomic justice issues, focusing a huge 
amount of energy and lobbying power 
on passing legislation to expand and 
extend the Child Tax Credit and the 
Earned Income Tax Credit. This No-
vember, FCNL organized more than 600 
people in 45 states plus the District of 
Columbia to lobby Congress in support 
of these priorities. 
Diane is truly one who speaks truth 
to power, and I am deeply grateful for 
that. She leaves a legacy not only of 
moral leadership, but also a vision for 
a more peaceful and equitable future, 
and an organization that is energized 
and equipped to pursue it.

HONORING 40 YEARS OF SERVICE 
TO MEDICINE BY DR. BOYDE J. 
HARRISON 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I would 
like pay tribute to Boyde J. ‘‘Jerry’’ Harrison, 
MD of Haleyville, Alabama on his 40 years of 
practice in medicine and service to Haleyville, 
Alabama, rural communities and the state of 
Alabama. 
Born to B.J. and Geneva Harrison, Dr. Har-
rison grew up in Tallassee, Alabama, and 
graduated from Tallassee High School in 
1970. He then went on to complete his under-
graduate degree at Birmingham Southern Col-
lege in Birmingham, Alabama before attending 
Tulane University where he participated in bio-
chemical research. Upon his return to Ala-
bama, Dr. Harrison attended the University of 
Alabama School of Medicine to obtain his 
Doctor of Medicine and thereafter opened his 
private practice in Haleyville in November of 
1981. 
However, Dr. Harrison’s service does not 
end with his private practice of medicine. Over 
the years he has served as the chair of the 
board for three statewide medical associations 
including the Alabama Medical Directors Asso-
ciation, the Alabama Academy of Family Phy-
sicians, and the Medical Association of the 
State of Alabama. He has also served as 
chairman of the Alabama State Board of Med-
ical Scholarships and the Alabama State 
Board of Medical Examiners. Among other 
honors he has served as Censor for the Med-
ical Association of the State of Alabama, rep-
resented the board on the Medicaid Transition 
Task Force, and served on the Opioid Task 
force for two governors. 
In addition to his dedicated service through 
our medical organizations, Dr. Harrison also 
led the state of Alabama in treatment during at 
the dawn of the opioid crisis. As a long-time 
advocate for office-based treatment against 
opioid dependency, Dr. Harrison became one

Alabama Board of Medical Examiners. Since 
that time, he has presented the course to over 
15,000 Alabama prescribers and was awarded 
the Administrators in Medicine National Award 
for Excellence for the course in 2015. 
Along with his accomplishments in the med-
ical field, Dr. Harrison in an instrument-rated 
pilot, a certified scuba diver, photographer, 
and has served his church as a talented pian-
ist for over 25 years. 
Dr. Boyde J. Harrison is a prime example of 
the steadfast, hardworking people that I am

to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and to 
the conservation and management of the Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge System played a critical 
role in protecting important natural resources 
in Arkansas and throughout the nation. Wildlife 
refuges are an essential piece to both the 
economy and culture of the Natural State, and 
we owe many thanks to Dr. Weaver for his 
leadership in conservation. 
His career officially began at Tensas River 
National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Louisiana 
as a forestry technician. There he oversaw 
logging contracts, participated in reforestation 
activities, dealt with nuisance beaver control, 
and later became the refuge’s first Wildlife Bi-
ologist where he conducted important re-
search on the area’s black bears. He served 
outside of the Southeast in refuge leadership 
positions at Blackwater National Wildlife Ref-
uge 
in 
Maryland’s 
Eastern 
Shore 
and 
Nulhegan Basin Division of the Silvio O. Conte 
National Fish and Wildlife Refuge in north-
eastern Vermont. Dr. Weaver took his current 
position as the project leader at the Central 
Arkansas National Wildlife Refuge Complex in 
2007. He is responsible for managing six ref-
uges at Bald Knob, Big Lake, Cache River, 
Holla Bend, Logan Cave, and Wapanocca, Ar-
kansas—five of which are primarily managed 
for wintering waterfowl. 
Throughout his career, he invested in future 
conservation leaders and earned a reputation 
of the highest character, integrity, and hon-
esty. He engaged with national, regional, and 
local stakeholders and was a dependable re-
source for my staff and I, always ready to help 
serve Arkansans. 
Dr. Weaver’s dedication and leadership has 
not gone unnoticed, and in September 2021, 
he was awarded the Department of the Inte-
rior’s Distinguished Service Award, the highest 
honorary recognition an employee can receive 
within DOI. This award is reserved for out-
standing individuals who make significant con-
tributions to science or to the public service. 
Both the state of Arkansas and the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service are losing an excep-
tional public servant. I thank Dr. Weaver for 
his decades of commitment to keeping the 
Natural State a vibrant, safe, and beautiful 
place to call home.

RECOGNIZING 30 YEARS OF 
KAZAKHSTAN’S INDEPENDENCE 
HON. DINA TITUS 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
today to recognize the 30th anniversary of the 
Independence of the Republic of Kazakhstan. 
Kazakhstan achieved its independence from 
the former Soviet Union and became a self- 
governing nation-state on December 16, 1991. 
Guided 
by 
its 
first 
President 
Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, Kazakhstan quickly renounced 
nuclear weapons, and worked with the United 
States to close the former Soviet nuclear test 
facility at Semipalatinsk and secure the nu-
clear materials stored there. These bold ges-
tures by President Nazarbayev and his gov-
ernment at a time of significant instability in 
the region set a precedent on nuclear safety 
and nonproliferation efforts for Kazakhstan in 
the international community. 
After independence, Kazakhstan quickly 
turned away from Soviet-inspired central eco-
nomic planning and built a stable market 
economy. As early as 1992, Kazakhstan 
joined international arbitration bodies and ac-
tively invited foreign investment in the country. 
Today Kazakhstan’s economic output is one of 
the most robust in Central Asia, and American 
companies are some of the largest investors 
in Kazakhstan. In 2015, after twenty years of 
negotiations, Kazakhstan acceded to member-
ship in the World Trade Organization (WTO), 
further broadening its relationship with the 
global economic community. 
In 2019, the Kazakh people elected Presi-
dent 
Kassym-Jomart 
Tokayev 
who 
has 
pledged more important economic and political 
reforms. He has called his vision of govern-
ment, ‘‘the listening state,’’ and has promised 
to hear and respond to Kazakh citizens, to act 
consistently with international social, labor, 
and human rights standards, and to encour-
age participation in the political life of the 
country. I applaud these calls for reforms and 
hope that the government of Kazakhstan will 
implement them which will ultimately benefit 
the country and cement its place as a reliable 
friend of the United States. 
One of the requirements of the WTO is that 
members extend permanent normal trade rela-
tions to each other. Unfortunately, the U.S. 
has yet to grant permanent normal trade rela-
tions to Kazakhstan, citing the Jackson-Vanik 
amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 which 
restricts 
trade 
relations 
with 
non-market 
economies that limit the right of citizens to 
emigrate. This measure was aimed at the So-
viet Union and its then-allies in response to 
their punitive restrictions on Jewish e´migre´s. 
Joined by my friends, Ms. WALORSKI, Ms. 
MURPHY, and Mr. CHABOT, I introduced H.R. 
5544 in October to grant permanent normal 
trade relations to Kazakhstan. It is long past 
time for the U.S. to take this step. The Soviet 
Union no longer exists, and its successor, the 
Russian Federation, was granted permanent 
normal trade relations in 2012. Meanwhile, 
since independence, Kazakhstan has granted 
all of its citizens the freedom to emigrate and 
adopted a stable market economy. The condi-
tions that led to enactment of Jackson-Vanik 
no longer exist, and the reasons for its restric-
tions on trade relations have long since 
ceased to apply to Kazakhstan. Permanent 
normal trade relations will benefit Kazakhstan 
and will also benefit the many U.S. companies 
investing 
in 
and 
doing 
business 
in 
Kazakhstan. 
Kazakhstan also has been a crucial leader 
and partner to the U.S. on counterterrorism ef-
forts, providing support and assistance to the 
U.S. during its engagement in Afghanistan. 
The country has an abundance of natural re-
sources, including rare earth and other critical 
minerals that will play a significant role in the 
global shift away from fossil fuels. Kazakhstan 
has a young and educated workforce and ac-
tively promotes universal education, including 
English language skills, so its citizens can fully 
participate in the global economy. For these 
reasons, I believe Kazakhstan deserves our 
sustained interest, friendship, and attention as 
it continues to evolve. 
Madam Speaker, I recently assumed the 
role of co-chair of the U.S.-Kazakhstan Cau-
cus because I believe our relationship with 
Kazakhstan is very important to the economic 
and national security of the United States. We 
clearly benefit from our friendship with this vi-
brant and growing nation located in such a 
strategic part of the world. I invite all my 
House colleagues to consider joining the Cau-
cus and supporting the granting of permanent 
normal trade relations to Kazakhstan. 
Congratulations to the Kazakh people on 30 
years of independence, progress, and growth.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
JEFFERSON 
DAVIS 
COUNTY 
JAGUARS 
AS 
MHSAA 3A STATE CHAMPIONS 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I’d like to 
congratulate the Jefferson Davis County Jag-
uars and Coach Lance Mancuso on their 
MHSAA 3A State Championship victory. This 
is Coach Mancuso’s ninth straight state cham-
pionship, an unprecedented accomplishment. I 
commend Coach Mancuso for his record-set-
ting success at the helm of the Jaguars foot-
ball team and wish him and his team contin-
ued success in the future. 
I would also like to extend my congratula-
tions to the young men who worked tirelessly 
for the championship trophy. Every early 
morning, every extra rep, and every sacrifice 
they made to better themselves and their team 
has resulted in the top prize. 
In the coming days, as the thrill of victory 
begins to fade, l would encourage those 
young men to reflect deeply on the investment 
they made to realize this championship. They 
will never forget the feeling of their great ac-
complishment; but in the future, as they remi-
nisce on this victory, I would challenge them 
to remember the qualities that made them 
champions.

COMMEMORATING JUDY 
MCKIERNAN 
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in remembrance of Judith Ann McKiernan, 
wife, mother, public servant, and community 
leader. Mrs. McKiernan passed away on No-
vember 30th. 
Judy is survived by her husband of twenty- 
nine years, Michael and their two children, 
Hannah, and Adam. Lovingly known to Judy 
as, Team McKiernan. 
A native of Shreveport, Louisiana, Judy 
grew up in Houston, Texas and made her way 
to Winchester in the late 1980s. Judy dedi-
cated her life in Winchester to community 
service, as a social worker, public school 
counselor and administrator for over thirty 
years, and as a Member of Winchester City 
Council. She was currently serving as Director 
of Student Support Services for the Win-
chester Public Schools. 
Judy was known for her spirited personality 
and fierce determination to advocate for those 
she loved. She enjoyed dancing, being out in 
nature, and welcoming all who came through 
her door. She loved serving her community 
and found great joy in supporting the develop-
ment of making it a more equitable place to 
thrive and grow. Judy supported the many or-
ganizations whose missions aligned with her 
values, including Bright Futures, Winchester 
Area Thermal Shelter (WATTS) NAACP, and 
many others. 
Judy McKiernan leaves behind a lasting leg-
acy of dedicated public service and will be 
missed by family, her many friends and the 
community she served.

HONORING COMMISSIONER EMMIT 
JIMMAR OF COLBERT COUNTY, 
ALABAMA 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to recognize today the profound service 
and legacy of the late Emmit Jimmar of 
Colbert County, Alabama. Emmit Jimmar held 
the office of county commissioner for 28 
years, serving as the first Black commissioner 
elected in Colbert County. We mourn his 
passing today and reflect on the influence his 
service brought to North Alabama. 
Commissioner Jimmar was known by many 
as a bearer of wisdom. For nearly three dec-
ades he served as a mentor for so many, in-
stilling in each of them the importance of pas-
sion in service and a love for the work they 
do. 
He paved the way for others to follow, from 
being the first Black county commissioner to 
being the first Black teacher at Coffee High 
School in Florence, Alabama. Commissioner 
Jimmar also played a key role in fanning the 
Alabama Education Association by initially 
joining the preexisting white teacher’s associa-
tion. He would then spend 43 years with AEA 
advocating for educators and staff in the state. 
Words used to describe Commissioner 
Jimmar have included ‘‘a pillar in the Shoals 
community,’’ and ‘‘a mentor, advisor, sup-
porter, and friend.’’ I know that Commissioner 
Jimmar was all of such and more. The legacy 
of his avowed service in Alabama will thrive as 
the communities he has touched continue to 
grow and benefit from his work. 
Commissioner Jimmar leaves to cherish his 
memory his wife of 59 years, Mrs. Elsa 
Jimmar, and his two children Kevin and 
La’Kiska 
Jimmar; 
special 
daughter-in-law 
Pammie Jimmar; grandsons KC Jimmar and 
Dallas Jimmar; sisters Martha (Puddin) Stew-
art and Carrie Jimmar; and brother, Reginald 
(Tiffany) Hughes and stepsister Debbie Win-
ston. Devoted nephews and nieces, Renita 
(LaBron) Jimmar-Hall; Myron (Sherry) Hughes; 
Kimberly Stewart; Kharis Hughes; Nephew 
Carlton (Verda) Ross; brother-in-law Don 
Wells (Carol); sisters-in-law Annie Wells and 
Aurelia Wells, and a host of nieces, nephews, 
other relatives and friends. 
I ask that you join me in honoring Emmit 
Jimmar and help commemorate his lifetime of 
service as an inspiration for others as they fol-
low in his footsteps on the lasting path he 
paved.

RECOGNITION OF THE AWARD OF 
THE 
GREENFIELD 
RECORDER’S 
2021 CITIZEN OF THE YEAR TO 
CAROLYN SHORES NESS 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Carolyn Shores Ness, the 
Greenfield Recorder’s 2021 Citizen of the 
Year. Carolyn is a proud resident of the Sec-
ond District of Massachusetts and has served 
her community of Deerfield, and beyond, for 
many years. 
In her 18 years as a member of the Deer-
field Selectboard, Carolyn has served on var-
ious committees through which she has made 
a great impact. She has worked to secure 
grant funding for Deerfield and to support the 
programs that most benefit the town. Since 
2014, she has been leading the charge to re-
vitalize downtown Deerfield and transform it 
into a booming destination. Carolyn wants to 
make her town a safe and walkable place 
where businesses can thrive. 
Her aspirations are clear—Carolyn Shores 
Ness wants to create community. And Madam 
Speaker, Carolyn is unique in that she does 
the work to realize her vision. 
In addition to her tenure on the Selectboard, 
Carolyn has served as the Chair of the Deer-
field Board of Health and the Co-Chair of the 
Mohawk Area Public Health Coalition. Through 
her actions and advocacy, Carolyn has 
worked to keep the people in our community 
healthy and safe, especially as we continue to 
navigate the COVID–19 pandemic. 
She has been a member of many councils 
and commissions, including the Western Mas-
sachusetts Homeland Security Council, the 
Regional Emergency Planning Council, and 
the Deerfield Green Infrastructure Committee. 
Carolyn has been a staunch advocate for sus-
tainable and efficient improvements to local in-
frastructure. Her advocacy exemplifies her un-
wavering commitment to both service and 
community. 
Madam Speaker, Carolyn has consistently 
worked to improve our community and bring 
people together. She is respectful and en-
gaged and values hearing different points of 
view in order to best advocate for what our 
community truly needs. She has an incredible 
gift for collaborating with others to produce 
creative and effective solutions. Carolyn em-
bodies what it means to be a public servant 
and Massachusetts is all the better for it. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress and the people of Massachu-
setts, I would like to thank Carolyn Shores 
Ness for her longstanding service and con-
gratulate her on being named the Greenfield 
Recorder’s 2021 Citizen of the Year.

Paradise’s Emergency Management Coordi-

Board of Supervisors, all the while volun-
teering at a fire company in the community. 
He gives his phone number to anyone within 
Paradise who may need it, making sure that

IN HONOR OF JEFF AZZOPARDI 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor South San Francisco Police Chief Jeff 
Azzopardi on the occasion of his retirement. 
After almost 30 years of service with the de-
partment, Chief Azzopardi has decided that it 
is time for a new chapter in his life that will 
allow him to spend more time with his family. 
That desire particularly resonates with me this 
year because I announced my own retirement 
from a job I love to spend more time with my 
family. 
I had the great honor to work with Chief 
Azzopardi since he was appointed in 2014. 
One of the more memorable occasions was a 
press conference in 2017 in which we an-
nounced the first-ever conviction for human 
trafficking in San Mateo County. That success 
reflected the outstanding collaboration of law 
enforcement, elected officials, and nonprofit 
organizations on the local, state, and federal 
level. Chief Azzopardi played an essential role 
in that collaboration. 
Jeff Azzopardi was hired as a police recruit 
for the South San Francisco Police Depart-
ment and sworn in as an officer in 1993. From 
there he rose through the ranks of K–9 officer, 
S.W.A.T. officer, school community liaison offi-
cer, police corporal, criminal investigations bu-
reau officer, police sergeant, community rela-
tions sergeant, police lieutenant, criminal in-
vestigations bureau commander, and police 
captain. After the retirement of former Chief 
Mike Massoni in 2014, the department con-
ducted a nationwide search and selected Jeff 
Azzopardi as its new chief in September of 
that year. No matter the role, Jeff is dedicated 
to the safety and well-being of our community. 
He leads by example and always strives for 
excellence. 
During his time with the department, he suc-
cessfully completed the Inner Perspectives 
Leadership Program, LAPD Leadership Pro-
gram, and POST Executive Development 
course. He holds a number of certifications 
from the California Commission on Peace Offi-
cer Standards and Training. He also is the 
former president of the San Mateo County 
Commanders Group, the president of the San 
Mateo County Police Chief’s and Sheriffs As-
sociation, and the Chief of the North Central 
Regional S.W.A.T. Team and Commissioner 
for the South San Francisco Commission on 
Racial and Social Equity. Chief Azzopardi un-
derstands the importance of community rela-
tions and has been a leader on several com-
munity oriented policing projects. He tirelessly 
emphasized the importance of building bridges 
between his department and our community. 
His outstanding service did not go unno-
ticed. He received numerous awards and hon-
ors, including a certificate of commendation 
from the police department for his work as a 
sexual assault investigator, a certificate of 
commendation from the San Mateo County 
Board of Supervisors, a lifetime achievement 
award from the South San Francisco Chamber 
of Commerce, the Carl Valero Lifetime 
Achievement Award from Pacifica American 
Little League, and Police Officer of the Year 
from the San Mateo County Trial Lawyers As-
sociation. 
Born in San Francisco, Jeff attended Terra 
Nova High School in Pacifica and then re-
ceived his Bachelor’s Degree in Public Admin-
istration from Chico State University and his 
Master’s Degree in Public Administration from 
Notre Dame de Namur University. 
As South San Francisco’s Top Cop is leav-
ing his post, he is looking forward to spending 
more time with his wife of 21 years, Nikole, 
and their sons Nat and Drew. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to rise with me to 
thank Chief Azzopardi for keeping South San 
Francisco one of the safest and most innova-
tive cities in the Bay Area. His exemplary 
leadership has earned him the respect and 
adoration of his colleagues and South City 
residents. His contributions over the last three 
decades will outlast his service.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
DR. JAMES L. LEE 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the outstanding service of Dr. 
James L. Lee of Conway, South Carolina. 
In June of 1922, Dr. Lee was appointed to 
a small country church of only a few people. 
Under his strong leadership, Catoe Chapel 
Church of God in Christ has grown to be one 
of the largest churches in Kershaw County, 
with over two hundred active members. 
Throughout the community, Dr. Lee is known 
as a dynamic preacher and prolific teacher of 
God’s word, and he lives exactly by what he 
preaches. 
Although he lived in Conway, Dr. Lee abid-
ed by his faith and took the helm of leading 
this small ministry, believing God would use 
him to take the church to insurmountable 
heights. God did exactly that and more. Dr. 
Lee even inspired church members to build a 
beautiful new edifice, seated off Highway 341. 
Dr. Lee’s guidance and wisdom has aided 
and encouraged countless families through dif-
ficult times. He has helped families find hous-
ing assistance, student scholarships, and nu-
merous community enrichment and outreach 
programs. Despite dealing with his own health 
challenges, Dr. Lee has remained committed 
to his ministry and the church. His life as a 
servant of the Lord is so deeply evident in 
how he cares for those around him. 
On behalf of the 5th District of South Caro-
lina, I thank Dr. James L. Lee for his thirty 
years of faithful service. He is a true example 
of a servant leader and has been a tremen-
dous resource to our community. May God 
continue to bless Dr. Lee and his family.

COMMEMORATING DR. TERRY 
SINCLAIR 
HON. JENNIFER WEXTON 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in remembrance of Dr. Terry Sinclair of Win-
chester, one of the most respected physicians 
in Virginia’s 10th Congressional District. Dr. 
Sinclair passed away on November 26th. 
Dr. Sinclair is survived by his loving wife of 
55 years, Diane, two daughters, one son, and 
eight grandchildren. Diane tells us, ‘‘he loved 
his family passionately, we laughed, we had 
fabulous experiences. We were blessed.’’ In 
any setting, whether as a physician, adminis-
trator, musician, or community leader, he was 
known for his compassionate and caring na-
ture. 
As a graduate of Johns Hopkins University 
and the University of Michigan Medical 
School, he then completed his surgical resi-
dency at the University of Missouri. He then 
went on to serve his country for two years with 
the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War. 
Moving to Winchester in 1974, he first prac-
ticed vascular and general surgery. However, 
his service in the Navy during Vietnam pro-
vided him with a significant amount of experi-
ence in trauma-related surgery, and he began 
to develop an expertise in the field. During 
that same time period, he joined the staff at 
Winchester Medical Center and eventually be-
came vice president of medical affairs for the 
hospital’s corporate parent, Valley Health. By 
1976, he was at the forefront of bringing 
Emergency Medical Services to the area, 
serving as President of the Lord Fairfax EMS 
Council for twenty years, and as a member of 
the governor’s EMS Advisory Board and Vir-
ginia Federation of EMS Councils. 
Since the 1970s saw the creation and de-
velopment of some of the original free health 
clinics, it meant that those who were unem-
ployed, uninsured, or couldn’t afford medical 
help could receive treatment. On October 
23rd, 1986, Dr. Sinclair spearheaded the 
opening of the Free Medical Clinic, now 
known as the Sinclair Health Clinic. Today, the 
Sinclair Health Clinic is the second-oldest free 
medical clinic in Virginia. 
The current director of the clinic notes that, 
‘‘His legacy is woven into the memories of ev-
eryone he’s touched in the clinic—all of the 
people who work here, the volunteers that 
make things happen and the thousands of pa-
tients who have passed through our doors.’’ 
As his loving wife Diane said to him gently 
in his final moments, ‘‘it was OK to go. Well 
done now, good, and faithful servant. You can 
rest.’’ 
Dr. Sinclair will be missed by the many lives 
he touched.

IN RECOGNITION OF MICHELLE 
MARTINEZ 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Michelle Martinez, Detroit resident 
and environmental justice warrior from Michi-
gan’s 13th District Strong as she departs as 
executive director from the Michigan Environ-
mental Justice Coalition. 
For many years, Michelle has been a pillar 
of our community, advocating for clean air and 
water, and fighting the environmental racism 
that hurts our neighbors’ quality of life. 
Michelle has drawn inspiration to pursue this 
work from her travels, studies, and the com-
munity where she lives. She has worked tire-
lessly for various organizations over the past 
fifteen years and has never wavered in seek-
ing justice for the people who live with the ef-
fects of pollution. 
I worked closely with Michelle on a number 
of initiatives when I served in the Michigan 
State Legislature and have continued our rela-
tionship through my time in Congress, and it 
has been amazing to see her grow as an ad-
vocate and leader. Whether it’s fighting to 
route truck traffic and diesel emissions away 
from residential neighborhoods or helping to 
bring national attention to adverse health ef-
fects in Michigan’s most polluted neighbor-
hood, Michelle has led the way in finding solu-
tions. She always taken a bold approach to 
making transformative change for our commu-

HONORING 
CHAIRMAN 
HARVEY 
GODWIN, JR. OF THE LUMBEE 
TRIBE OF NORTH CAROLINA FOR 
HIS EXCEPTIONAL LEADERSHIP 
AND SERVICE TO HIS COMMU-
NITY 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor my friend, Harvey Godwin, Jr., for his 
exceptional leadership and service in his com-
munity and as Chairman of the Lumbee Tribe 
of North Carolina. 
After graduating from the University of North 
Carolina at Pembroke, Chairman Godwin went 
on to become the owner and CEO of both 
Two Hawk Employment Services, LLC and 
Two Hawk Workforce Services. He has also 
held many leadership positions on state and 
local boards and committees, including the po-
sitions of Chairman for the Robeson Commu-
nity College Foundation Board of Directors 
and Secretary of the North Carolina Workforce 
Development Board Association. Chairman 
Godwin’s impressive background in manage-
ment was a real asset during his tenure as 
Tribal Chairman. 
Since the start of his tenure in 2016, Chair-
man Godwin’s vision and leadership has 
served to strengthen, protect, and uplift the 
Lumbee Tribe. To further preserve Lumbee 
culture and history, he restored the Lumbee 
Tribe Cultural Center in a project that featured 
the construction of a new playground and 
community garden as well as renovations to 
the swimming pool and amphitheater. His 
leadership has also proved paramount for the 
physical and economic security of the tribe. 
Most notably, he administered essential hurri-
cane relief efforts and secured over $58 mil-
lion in federal funding, including Title VI fund-
ing from U.S. Housing and Urban Develop-
ment for the construction of many new homes 
across Lumbee territory. Furthermore, Chair-
man Godwin’s consistent advocacy played a 
pivotal role in passage of the Lumbee Tribe of 
North Carolina Recognition Act in the U.S. 
House of Representatives. I was honored to 
play a small role. He has built and maintained 
bipartisan relationships in Washington that I 
believe will eventually result in the Lumbee 
Tribe finally being granted the federal recogni-
tion that is long overdue. 
I would like to extend my most heartfelt ap-
preciation to Chairman Godwin for his com-
mitted and impactful leadership. I speak for 
our entire community in wishing him and his 
family continued success and happiness. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring Harvey Godwin, Jr. for his six years 
of service as Lumbee Tribe Chairman and life- 
long commitment to supporting his community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOE 
ZEPPIERI 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to mourn and observe the passing of a 
passionate family man and faithful community 
servant, Dr. Joe Zeppieri of Groton, Con-
necticut. A dedicated member involved in local 
politics, Joe passed away on December 4, 
2021 after 77 full and loving years. His loss is 
significant for the Town of Groton. 
Born to Paul Zeppieri and Ella Buonanno 
Zeppieri in 1943, Joe was destined to live an 
accomplished life with a strong sense of duty. 
He was a lifelong learner who graduated from 
Groton’s own Fitch High School and went on 
to attend several institutions of higher edu-
cation including Providence College, Tufts Uni-
versity School of Medicine, and the University 
of Connecticut School of Medicine before im-
mersing himself with a career in the medical 
field. Within those years of schooling, Joe was 
able to reconnect with his childhood sweet-
heart, Paula, who would shortly thereafter be-
come Mrs. Zeppieri in 1967. Grounded by 
these roots, Joe went on to serve our country 
in the Navy as a Lieutenant Commander as 
both a doctor on the USS John Marshall and 
then chief medical officer on the USS Fulton. 
Upon completing his stint in the Navy, Dr. 
Zeppieri settled back down in the Town of 
Groton. He used his penchant for knowledge 
to help other people with their own health and 
well-being, working in the field of orthopedic 
surgery all the way into the new millennium. 
Of course, simply one field of expertise 
would never have been sufficient for someone 
such as Joe. Upon his retirement from the 
medical field, Dr. Zeppieri reinvigorated his 
passion for education. He completely shifted 
gears, working hard to obtain yet another de-
gree from Western New England—this time, in 
the field of law. Paula and the family remained 
his rock during this period, and he was sure 
to gravitate back home every week while 
working to achieve his new merits. After ob-
taining a JD from Western New England, Joe 
worked at the local law firm of Stephen M. 
Reck and Scott D. Camassar before opening 
his own firm. He operated in the incredibly 
complicated field of medical malpractice, add-
ing another notch to his belt of service by ad-
vocating on behalf of those who received im-
proper healthcare in the courtroom. As a re-
tired doctor himself, Zeppieri had a perspec-
tive that enabled him to become a natural suc-
cess in this new line of work and hold his 
former industry to fair standards. 
Outside of the courtroom, Joe Zeppieri’s 
care for his fellow community members really 
began to shine through into his latest years. 
He always had his finger on the pulse of Grot-
on, leading him to municipal service on the 
City of Groton’s Board of Zoning Appeals. In 
2017, he was elected town councilor—a form 
of service that he would keep up with until his 
final days. Fellow Groton residents and stake-
holders that were lucky enough to have known 
or collaborated with Joe can attest to his lov-
ing character, his integrity, dependable exper-
tise, fairness, and ability to keep the discus-
sion level-headed. At the end of the day, Joe 
was someone who could be relied upon to ad-
vocate for and focus the discussion on the 
community services that held the greatest im-
pact on the health and vibrance of the Groton 
community. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to know of 
constituents as dedicated as Dr. Joe Zeppieri. 
Joe’s service to his community has taken sev-
eral forms—whether it was through the Navy, 
medical field, courtroom, or municipal govern-
ment. His greatest contributions, however, 
originated from his honed expertise, which en-
abled him to change the lives of countless in-
dividuals forever. Though we mourn the void 
left in his wake, we ought to remember Joe’s 
lifelong contributions and the value he placed 
in the things that truly have an impact on peo-
ple’s lives for the better. In that sense, we 
should also find gratitude in the strength of 
Joe’s family ties and trust that his surviving 
family—his wife Paula, children Christopher, 
Michael, and Laura and their respective part-
ners, and nine grandchildren—and his fellow 
community members will reverberate the 
memory and legacy of Joseph Zeppieri for 
generations to come. To assist in this endeav-
or, I ask that my colleagues and the House 
join me in setting Joseph Zeppieri’s memory 
further into stone, and thank him for his life full 
of love and service.

COM-
MITTEE REPORT ACCOMPANYING 
H.R. 4350 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I rise as Congress considers the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 to 
highlight a concern with some language in the 
House Armed Services Committee Report ac-
companying H.R. 4350 that passed this cham-
ber earlier this year, and which I voted to sup-
port. Included in the House bill’s report is di-
rection to the Secretary of Defense to study 
and issue a report on ‘‘DoD Logistics and Po-
tential 
Benefits 
of 
Carsharing’’ 
for 
servicemembers. In carrying out the study, I 
believe the Department of Defense must ob-
jectively evaluate not only potential benefits, 
but also potential risks peer-to-peer car-shar-
ing might pose to our servicemembers and 
families. For example, I am concerned about 
potential predatory lending practices to the ex-
tent that peer-to-peer car-sharing platforms 
encourage individual vehicle owners to go out 
and acquire vehicles for the sole purpose of 
renting a small ‘‘fleet’’ of vehicles on such plat-
forms; the collection and remission of trans-
actional sales and excise taxes on behalf of 
vehicle owners in states without laws ex-
pressly requiring the platform to do so, which 
could impact a servicemember’s tax liability; 
and, cybersecurity for servicemembers or their 
families’ personal and financial data. The bot-
tom line is that I believe the Department of 
Defense, in carrying out the study described in 
the House Armed Services Committee Report 
accompanying H.R. 4350, must consider po-
tential risks, in addition to the potential bene-
fits, of peer-to-peer carsharing among our 
servicemembers.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
DR. ELOIS LEWIS EDGE 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Dr. Elois Lewis Edge of Al-
bany, Georgia, who will be retiring after a dis-
tinguished, 43-year career as a nurse, mid-
wife, and instructor serving the families and 
communities of Southwest Georgia. 
Dr. Edge has been a Certified Nurse Mid-
wife at Albany Area Primary Health since 
2009. Before that, she worked at Phoebe 
Putney Memorial Hospital for 30 years. In 
these positions, Dr. Edge earned the gratitude 
of thousands of expectant mothers for her 
skillful assistance, compassionate care, and 
warm personality. 
Dr. Edge also attained distinction in aca-
demia as well. She earned her Associate Arts 
in Nursing at Darton State University in Al-
bany, which was followed by a Bachelor of 
Science in Nursing at Georgia Southwestern 
University in Americus, Georgia; a Certificate 
of Midwifery from the Frontier School of Mid-
wifery and Family Nursing in Hyden, Kentucky; 
a Master of Science in Nursing from Case 
Western Reserve in Cleveland, Ohio; and a 
Doctorate in Nursing Practice from Frontier 
Nursing University in Hyden, Kentucky. While 
Dr. Edge was receiving her degrees, she was 
teaching future generations of medical profes-
sionals at Georgia Southwestern University 
and Frontier Nursing University. 
Shirley Chisholm often said that: ‘‘Service is 
the rent that we pay for the space we occupy 
on this earth.’’ Dr. Edge paid her rent and she 
paid it well. The world is a much brighter place 
due to the thousands of children Dr. Edge has 
helped usher into the world, either directly as 
a midwife, or by virtue of the instruction she 
provided to the scores of midwives and nurses 
who learned their trade from her. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues here 
in the United States House of Representatives 
to join my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the 
over 730,000 residents of the Second Con-
gressional District of Georgia in honoring Dr. 
Elois Lewis Edge on her outstanding career 
and upon the occasion of her retirement. We 
wish her well as she begins a new chapter in 
her life.

RECOGNITION OF THE 50TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE ASSOCIATION 
FOR 
THE 
ADVANCEMENT 
OF 
MEXICAN AMERICANS 
HON. SYLVIA R. GARCIA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the 50th anniversary of 
the Association for the Advancement of Mexi-
can Americans. 
For 50 years, AAMA has helped Latinos 
achieve their potential. 
AAMA has motivated Latino youth to finish 
school and encouraged many to go on to col-
lege. 
As a Mexican American, I know first-hand 
how important it is to have someone fighting 
for you on your path to success. 
AAMA has always fought for every single 
one of our children, especially the most at risk 
and marginalized among us. Truly never has 
one been forgotten or left out. 
For half a century, if you were working for 
the greater good in Houston’s East End, then 
you have been a part of AAMA’s work or been 
a fruit of AAMA’s labor. 
AAMA has helped unlock the American 
Dream for countless American Latinos. It has 
established itself as the heart of the Houston 
community. 
So today, I want to thank everyone who has 
served at AAMA for their incredible passion 
and dedication. 
Your service to the Latino community has 
been extraordinary. 
I look forward to what the next 50 years will 
bring to the AAMA and to Latinos everywhere.

SALUTING FIT’S CYBERSECURITY 
TEAM 
FOR 
EXTRAORDINARY 
FIRST PLACE FINISH 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor the Florida Institute of Technology’s 
Cyber League Team, FITSEC, for their ex-
traordinary perfect score and first place finish 
in the Fall 2021 National Cyber League team 
tournament on November 7, 2021. 
The National Cyber League team tour-
nament is a biannual national competition in 
which 650 institutions around the country face 
off to solve simulations of real-life cybersecu-
rity problems. The National Cyber League as-
sesses a team’s ability to address nine critical 
cybersecurity workforce categories outlined in 
the NIST NICE Cybersecurity Framework and 
the NSA Knowledge Units. This year more 
than 3,900 teams competed, with our home-
town team clinching the victory. 
The Florida Institute of Technology of Mel-
bourne, FL, in my district, is leading the way 
in cybersecurity research and education and 
has been recognized as a National Security 
Agency (NSA) and the Department of Home-
land Security (DHS) National Center of Aca-
demic Excellence (CAE–R) in Cyber Defense 
Research. 
Their rigorous undergraduate Cyber Oper-
ations Concentration, modeled after the NSA 
Cyber Operations Knowledge Units, is devel-
oping bright young minds that will most cer-
tainly be among our nation’s future leaders. It 
is good to know that students right here in 
Brevard County will soon help solve the prob-
lems of tomorrow, like countering unchecked 
foreign threats and filling the shortages in this 
growing field already identified by the federal 
government. 
The 2021 Florida Institute of Technology’s 
team was coached by Dr. TJ O’Connor and 
consisted of two graduate and five under-
graduate students in Computer Science, in-
cluding 
Blake 
Janes, 
Carl 
Mann, 
Dave 
Breeden, Isaiah Thomas, Logan Suarez, 
Stephanie Wood, and Tiffanie Petersen. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in congratu-
lating FIT and these student leaders on their 
outstanding accomplishments and wish them 
every success in the future.

BULLDOGS AS MHSAA 1A STATE 
CHAMPIONS 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST

Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I’d like to 
congratulate the Bay Springs Bulldogs and 
Coach Dan Brady on their MHSAA 1A State 
Championship victory. Although the Bulldogs 
have reached the playoffs multiple times, 
Coach Brady led the talented team to a 32– 
12 victory over Simmons High School. I com-
mend Coach Brady for his success at the 
helm of the Bulldogs football team and wish 
him and his team continued success in the fu-
ture. 
I would also like to extend my congratula-
tions to the young men who worked tirelessly 
for the championship trophy. Every early 
morning, every extra rep, and every sacrifice 
they made to better themselves and their team 
has resulted in the top prize. 
In the coming days, as the thrill of victory 
begins to fade, I would encourage those 
young men to reflect deeply on the investment 
they made to realize this championship. They 
will never forget the feeling of their great ac-
complishment; but in the future, as they remi-
nisce on this victory, I would challenge them

CELEBRATING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF PREPARE + PROSPER 
HON. BETTY MCCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the staff and volunteers 
of Prepare + Prosper as they celebrate their 
50th year of service to Minnesota taxpayers. 
Prepare + Prosper is a nonprofit organization 
working to build financial health and expand 
access to quality tax and financial services for 
low- and moderate-income individuals and 
families. Through their efforts they have 
helped countless Minnesotans navigate the 
tax system, and in 2019 alone, they helped 
over 12,000 taxpayers file returns free of 
charge. 
Prepare + Prosper was founded in 1971 by 
a small group of economic justice-oriented ac-
countants who began to provide free account-
ing services to small business owners. Soon 
after, they also started to provide free indi-
vidual tax preparation for low- to moderate-in-
come taxpayers. Over the years they have 
grown into an organization with just over 20 
year-round staff members and more than 600 
volunteers, and have expanded the reach of 
their free tax filing services and broadened 
their offerings to include financial coaching 
and access to financial products. 
Two of their current program offerings are 
Money Mentors and Financial Access in 
Reach (FAIR) Financial Solution. Money Men-
tors provides one-on-one mentoring with a fi-
nancial coach and a network of peers to help 
participants create a plan for their financial fu-
ture and ultimately reach their financial goals. 
Prepare + Prosper partnered with Sunrise 
Banks to reimagine banking with their FAIR Fi-
nancial Solution program. This initiative gives 
low-income families access to checking and 
savings accounts as well as a small-loan pro-
gram at low cost, while also providing an alter-
native to check-cashing operators and payday 
lenders. 
In the Twin Cities, more than 194,000 
households are excluded from the financial 
mainstream according to the FDIC, meaning 
that they may have unpredictable income, lack 
of access to checking and savings accounts or 
to affordable credit or loans. On top of this, 
many households experienced financial stress 
brought on by the COVID–19 pandemic or 
needed help to navigate the system and re-
ceive their Economic Impact Payments or 
Child Tax Credits. 
The staff and volunteers at Prepare + Pros-
per are an extremely valuable asset to the 
community as they help Minnesotans over-
come these barriers that still exist when seek-
ing greater economic opportunity. And as part 
of their effort to bridge these gaps, Prepare + 
Prosper engages in advocacy work to ad-
vance policies and practices that will directly 
benefit people with low- to moderate-incomes 
when it comes to tax credits, consumer pro-
tection and asset-building. They also partner 
with other community organizations to spread 
the word about their services and to reach 
those who may be eligible for benefits like the 
Child Tax Credit which helps lift families out of 
poverty. 
Prepare + Prosper is led today by Executive 
Director Suyapa Miranda who joined the orga-
nization in the spring of 2021 and will lead 
them into the next 50 years of service with a 
focus on closing the economic wealth gap in 
Minnesota by concentrating on developing and 
implementing programs that serve commu-
nities most impacted by systemic economic in-
justice. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Prepare + Prosper as they celebrate 50 
years of upholding their mission of building fi-
nancial well-being through offering free tax 
preparation and financial services, and by 
changing systems to create economic oppor-
tunity for all.

RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF 
ROCHESTER’S EASTMAN SCHOOL 
OF MUSIC ON ITS 100TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
HON. JOSEPH D. MORELLE 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the University of Rochester’s East-
man School of Music on the occasion of its 
centennial celebration. 
In September 1921, the Eastman School of 
Music opened its doors with an inaugural 
class of 104 students. Through the efforts of 
its founder, George Eastman of Eastman 
Kodak Company, longtime director Howard 
Hanson, and University of Rochester Presi-
dent Rush Rhees, the school became a leader 
in American music education dedicated to the 
highest levels of artistry and scholarship. 
The following year, the school’s largest per-
formance venue, the iconic Eastman Theatre, 
was opened. Inscribed on its facade is Mr. 
Eastman’s vision, ‘‘For the enrichment of com-
munity life.’’ In the years since, the theatre has 
hosted some of the world’s greatest musi-
cians, including composers Aaron Copland, 
Igor Stravinsky and John Williams; jazz musi-
cians Duke Ellington, Wynton Marsalis, and 
Eastman alumnus Ron Carter; and classical 
luminaries Itzhak Perlman, Yo-Yo Ma, and 
Eastman alumna, Rene´e Fleming. It is the 
main performing venue of the Rochester Phil-
harmonic Orchestra and hosts many commu-
nity concerts, lectures, and events. It is also 
the venue and location of choice for many na-
tional and international festivals including The 
CGI Rochester International Jazz Festival, 
KeyBank Rochester Fringe Festival, and more. 
The Eastman Community Music School, 
also founded in 1921, is continuing to honor 
Mr. Eastman’s dream, offering music lessons, 
ensembles, classes, and workshops to stu-
dents of all ages and financial means each 
year. Eastman also provides tuition-free les-
sons and music instruction to Rochester City 
School District students, many of whom go on 
to study at Eastman as well as at other top 
music schools. 
Eastman has distinguished itself as an inno-
vator in music and culture, developing the 
Doctor of Musical Arts degree in the 1950s 
and becoming the first music school to for-
mally offer courses in entrepreneurial thinking 
and leadership studies through its Institute for 
Music Leadership. Eastman’s Sibley Music Li-
brary is the largest collegiate music library in 
North America with nearly 750,000 items, in-
cluding many manuscripts, first-editions, and 
vast resources for performance and research. 
Eastman Performing Arts Medicine is a recent 
pioneering partnership between Eastman and 
the University of Rochester Medical Center to 
connect world-class performing arts with medi-
cine. 
Today, the Eastman School of Music enrolls 
nearly 900 undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents from almost every state and many coun-
tries around the world, led by 95 faculty mem-
bers. Its alumni include many Pulitzer, Tony, 
Grammy, and Emmy Award winners. 
Over the last one hundred years, the East-
man School of Music’s premier programs and 
magnificent facilities have become a powerful 
cultural force not only in Rochester, New York, 
but across the United States and around the 
world. It is an honor to represent this fine insti-
tution and to support efforts over the years to 
strengthen this extraordinary school for many 
generations to come. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the University of Rochester’s 
Eastman School of Music on its centennial. Its 
service and contributions to Rochester, New 
York State, and arts and culture around the 
world will always be celebrated.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE HARLAN 
BIBLE DONATION TO CONGRESS 
HON. MIKE JOHNSON 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the good work 
and friendship of the American Judicial Alli-
ance. AJA and its founder, Judge Darrell 
White, have been working tirelessly to intro-
duce the tradition of the Harlan Bible by do-
nating these Bibles to our nation’s courtrooms 
and institutions, including to this chamber. 
Justice John Marshall Harlan set this prece-
dent by donating his very own Bible to the Su-
preme Court back in 1906, and since then, 
every justice has signed this Bible after taking 
the oath of office. 
Justice Harlan is probably best known for 
being the ‘‘Great Dissenter’’ and specifically 
for his role as the lone dissenter in Plessy v. 
Ferguson’s unjust ‘separate but equal’ prece-
dent. His personal transformation made him 
an impassioned supporter for civil rights during 
his 34 years on the Court. 
It was Justice Harlan who stated: ‘‘Our con-
stitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor 
tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of 
civil rights, all citizens are equal before the 
law.’’ 
By donating these Harlan Bibles, AJA is 
honoring the legacy of Justice Harlan’s fight 
for justice, recognizing that our inalienable 
rights come directly from our Creator, and re-
storing faith in our Nation’s courtrooms. May 
God continue to bless the American Judicial 
Alliance as it endeavors to share the Harlan 
Bible and its important message of justice, 
mercy, and faith to the American people.

ANDREW 
HUGINE, 
JR. 
AS 
PRESIDENT OF ALABAMA AGRI-
CULTURAL 
AND 
MECHANICAL 
UNIVERSITY 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the leadership of Dr. Andrew 
Hugine, Jr., the 11th President of Alabama 
Agricultural and Mechanical University (Ala-
bama A&M University), who is retiring on De-
cember 31, 2021, after 12 wonderful years of 
service to the University and the surrounding 
community. Dr. Hugine obtained his bachelor’s 
and master’s degrees in mathematics from 
South Carolina State University. He went on to 
earn his doctorate in Higher Education and In-
stitutional Research from Michigan State Uni-
versity. 
Prior to his tenure at Alabama A&M Univer-
sity, Dr. Hugine served as the President of 
South Carolina State University and held nu-
merous positions in education including In-
terim Executive Vice President and Chief Op-
erating Officer; Assistant Vice President for 
Academic Affairs; Director of Special Services 
Program; Director of University Year for Action 
Program—a service-learning program; Re-
search Fellow; Assistant and Director of Insti-
tutional Self-Study; Professor of Mathematics 
and high school mathematics teacher. Dr. 
Hugine has been recognized both nationally 
and internationally for his leadership in edu-
cation and adept administrative skills. 
Under the exceptional guidance of Dr. 
Hugine, Alabama A&M University has made 
many advancements. By making bold financial 
decisions, increasing academic programs, and 
fostering tenacious alumni and student con-
nections, Dr. Hugine dedicated himself to en-
suring that the university is more competitive 
in the 21st century. 
Partnering with various organizations includ-
ing, those of the National Pan-Hellenic Council 
along with the support of public and private 
entities, helped the university gain additional 
streams of external funding to increase finan-
cial opportunities for prospective students. As 
a result of Dr. Hugine’s efforts, the university 
increased its total endowment by almost 50 
million dollars, completing its first-ever capital 
campaign raising over 27 million dollars, and 
establishing the Normal Legacy Society, which 
has contributed over 5 million dollars to the 
university. 
Along with financial improvements, aca-
demic programs have shown tremendously 
growth under Dr. Hugine’s tenure. Nine new 
academic programs were formed, including 
Animal Bio-Health Technology, Communica-
tion Specialist, Construction Management, and 
many more to give the students versatility 
while pursuing the careers they desire. As a 
result of these academic developments, there 
have been record-breaking highs in Alabama 
A&M University’s recent fall enrollment with 
1,690 students enrolling into the freshman 
class. 
Increasing pride in this historic institution re-
mained a focal point of Dr. Hugine’s presi-
dency. With the vision of First Lady Abbiegail 
Hugine and the help of the Bulldog Pride 
Committee, several initiatives were imple-
mented to beautify the campus, enhance cus-
tomer service, promote character develop-
ment, and increase the wearing of Alabama 
A&M University paraphernalia as a display of 
pride. Other incredible programs and scholar-
ships were established such as the ‘‘Quad,’’ a 
program focused on student activities, the 
First Lady’s Endowed Scholarship Program, 
and the Normalite Walkway Pavers’ Scholar-
ship. 
Under the direction of Dr. Hugine Alabama 
A&M University has strengthened its nurturing 
environment for students to thrive and become 
remarkable contributors to society. Although I 
know he will continue to serve his community 
through volunteering, I sincerely hope that his 
retirement is filled with the joy of becoming a 
new grandparent and spending time with fam-
ily and friends. 
On a personal note, I was privileged to get 
to know Dr. Hugine and to witness first-hand 
his remarkable leadership as President of Ala-
bama A&M University. Dr. Hugine is a vision-
ary leader, dynamic educator, effective admin-
istrator, solid steward of the University’s fi-
nance, and true champion of the students, fac-
ulty, alumni, and trustees of Alabama A&M 
University. Under his twelve-year tenure as 
the 11th President of Alabama A&M Univer-
sity, Dr. Hugine made a lasting contribution to 
the education and administration of AAMU. 
Upon his retirement, his legacy will continue to 
live on in the numerous lives that he impacted 
and the outstanding contributions that AAMU 
students will make to this Nation. I wish him 
and his lovely wife Abbiegail, of over 40 years, 
much success in their future endeavors. They 
have truly been a blessing and left an indelible 
mark on the State of Alabama. For all he has 
done, we thank him for his exemplary service. 
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the extraordinary leadership and 
service of Dr. Andrew Hugine, Jr., and his 
contributions as President of Alabama Agricul-
tural and Mechanical University.

HONORING 
175 
YEARS 
OF 
THE 
FIRST 
PRESBYTERIAN 
CHURCH 
OF LANSING 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the First Presbyterian Church of Lan-
sing as they gather to celebrate 175 years of 
continuous faith and service. 
Founded on December 17, 1847, First Pres-
byterian Church is the oldest, formally-con-
stituted church in the city. At the time of its 
founding, Lansing’s residents were unified 
against slavery and the city served as a sec-
ondary stop on the Underground Railroad. The 
First 
Presbyterian 
faith 
community 
were 
among these early advocates for abolition and 
when the Civil War broke out, strongly sup-
ported Michigan troops who joined to defend 
the Union. The women of First Presbyterian 
Church cooked, washed clothes, and wrote 
letters home for those who could not write. 
Meanwhile, from the church pulpit, Rev. Ches-
ter S. Armstrong, urged local farmers to do 
their part and increase their harvests to feed 
the Union Army. 
After the war, the congregation continued to 
lead the way for social justice. They were the 
principal sponsor and supporter of the first Af-
rican-American Sabbath School in Lansing, 
which later became the African Methodist 
Episcopal Church which was founded in 1879. 
At the turn of the century, when outbreaks of 
cholera, typhoid, and malaria ravaged the 
most vulnerable residents in Lansing, First 
Presbyterian was a key proponent of improv-
ing sanitary living conditions. In addition to 
partnering with the YMCA to support the city’s 
youth, church members were invested in the 
common welfare of the needy, caring for 
neighbors who could not work or those whose 
wages weren’t enough to feed their families. 
As the city of Lansing grew, so did the First 
Presbyterian Church congregation. From its 
new home beside the state Capitol, pastors

and elders occupied prominent positions in the 
community. During the Great Depression, 
when charity was so desperately needed, the 
church distributed food and clothing to the 
poor and provided care for indigent children. 
It’s essential work that continues to this day— 
feeding thousands of people through its food 
pantry. 
Madam Speaker, Lansing’s First Pres-
byterian Church is a key player in interfaith 
and inter-racial fellowship. It serves as a ref-
uge and a sanctuary for several community 
based-service organizations who truly do 
God’s work in our state capital. They host 
weekly forums for residents to come together 
and enrich their understanding of the church’s 
history and tradition while also providing a 
venue for civic and academic leaders to meet 
with the community and answer questions on 
topics relevant to their lives. First Presbyterian 
supports artists, musicians, charities, and 
more—truly living up to its commitment as a 
strong community of faith and a positive agent 
for social justice and human welfare. 
The theme for their 175th anniversary cele-
bration is: ‘‘a diverse Christian community in-
spired by its heritage, renewed in faith and 
outreach, and dedicated to peace and justice.’’ 
It is a noble cause for a noble faith community 
and it is my privilege to recognize First Pres-
byterian Church of Lansing with these words 
in the People’s House. May they last as a fit-
ting tribute to its 175 years of service and 
guide the way for the next 175 years to come.

HONORING 
THE 
50TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
HAMPTON-NEW-
PORT NEWS COMMUNITY SERV-
ICES BOARD 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize and honor the Hamp-
ton-Newport News Community Services Board 
on its 50th anniversary. 
The Hampton-Newport News Community 
Services Board was established in 1971 by 
the Virginia General Assembly and by resolu-
tions passed by the city councils of Hampton 
and Newport News. The organization’s mis-
sion was to provide services to families and 
communities affected by mental illness, devel-
opmental disabilities and substance use dis-
orders. I want to congratulate and thank 
Natale Ward Christian, the current Executive 
Director, as well as her predecessors: Joe 
Allen, Steven Capo, Howard Cullum, and 
Charles Hall for their years of service and 
dedication to our community. 
The Hampton-Newport News Community 
Services Board is a source of support for the 
Hampton-Newport News community. The tire-
less work of the organization has improved the 
quality of life for countless people on the Vir-
ginia Peninsula. For fifty years, the Hampton- 
Newport News Community Services Board 
has achieved results because of continued 
partnership with individuals, family members, 
advocates and local service agencies. Since 
the board’s creation, it has grown to become 
an agency with over 80 programs and now 
serves thousands of individuals every year. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the leader-
ship and staff of the Hampton-Newport News 
Community Services Board for fifty years of 
continued service to the citizens of Hampton 
and Newport News. It is through the hard work 
and dedication of the board and its leadership, 
as well as the involvement of members of our 
community, that make Hampton Roads such a 
great place to live, work and raise a family. I 
wish for many more years of continued suc-
cess, so the board can keep up the important 
work of providing its critical services for those 
who need it most.

ROB GREEN RETIREMENT 
HON. VIRGINIA FOXX 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
salute a dedicated public servant and friend. 
After working for a series of Members of the 
House, including Rep. Bill Goodling, Rob 
Green first served the Education and Work-
force Committee from 1995 to 2001. Rob re-
joined the Committee four years ago and has 
been an invaluable leader of the GOP work-
force team ever since. 
As Director of Workforce Policy, Rob has 
worked tirelessly to protect the rights of work-
ers and employers alike. He has dedicated 
years of his life to fighting for free market prin-
ciples and to seeing that our country stays a 
self-governed Republic. Whether we have 
been in the majority or in the minority, Rob 
has made addressing federal overreach a top 
priority and has never been afraid to hold fed-
eral agencies accountable. 
Rob’s consummate professionalism when 
working with Members of Congress as well as 
with Democrat staff has allowed us to pass bi-
partisan bills such as the Retirement Improve-
ment and Savings Enhancement Act (RISE), 
which will help many Americans prepare for a 
more secure future. 
Rob’s work was also pivotal in helping us 
pass a ban on surprise billing. This fight for 
transparency in our medical system has been 
a passion of Rob’s and will help millions of 
struggling Americans. 
Rob’s influence has also extended beyond 
the Committee. GOP leadership has relied on 
Rob to shape policy in the labor arena, ensur-
ing that the American worker’s voice gets 
heard. His relationship with lawmakers and 
staff throughout the House has allowed the 
Committee to flourish and accomplish a tre-
mendous amount. 
Too often populist lobbies have an out-sized 
influence over politics in Washington. Rob’s 
work on this Committee ensured that the 
voices of job creators and small business 
owners were heard. 
I, myself, have relied on Rob’s expertise 
and keen eye for strategy to further this Com-
mittee’s mission, and I will miss his support. 
Thankfully, his expertise will live on in the 
team that he has led and mentored for four 
years. 
I commend Rob for his many accomplish-
ments and for his selfless service to this coun-
try. It is because of dedicated public servants 
like Rob, standing in the gap and defending 
our Republic, that we have a chance at re-
claiming the vision our Founding Fathers had 
for this Nation. 
I truly congratulate Rob on his retirement, 
he has earned it. 
HONORING VETERANS OF THE 
KOREAN WAR 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the service of our Korean 
War veterans, who fought so bravely to repel 
an invasion intended to overthrow the govern-
ment of the Republic of Korea and subjugate 
its people to authoritarian rule. 
On June 25, 1950, the armed forces of 
North Korea attacked South Korea with the 
goal of imposing a totalitarian regime on the 
men, women and children living south of the 
38th parallel at the demarcation line of the two 
countries. That same day, the Security Council 
of the United Nations unanimously condemned 
this violation of South Korean sovereignty, and 
two days later published Resolution 83, which 
authorized the use of force by member states 
to repel the invasion. President Truman imme-
diately sent United States troops to assist in 
responding to this aggression, but the conflict 
rapidly expanded to include armed forces from 
the People’s Republic of China. After three 
years of bloody struggle, and the deaths of 
nearly 37,000 members of the Armed Forces 
of United States and millions of Korean civil-
ians, an armistice was signed by the govern-
ments of North Korea, the People’s Republic 
of China and the United States ending hos-
tilities and establishing a demilitarized zone at 
the 38th parallel to formalize the existence of 
North and South Korea. 
The Korean War is often referred to as the 
‘‘Forgotten War,’’ as contemporaneous news 
coverage was censored, and its three years of 
conflict were overshadowed by the Second 
World War and the war in Vietnam. Former 
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, how-
ever, liked to display in his Pentagon office a 
night-time satellite image of the Korean penin-
sula. This image, which revealed a thriving, 
brightly lit South Korea and a pitch-black North 
Korea emblematic of the painful suffering of its 
citizens, was kept on display by Mr. Rumsfeld 
to remind himself and his visitors that the sac-
rifices of our veterans were not forgotten by, 
and had a transformative impact on, the peo-
ple of South Korea. 
Madam Speaker, I want to recognize the 
brave veterans of the Korean War as we ap-
proach the seventh decade since the 1953 ar-
mistice ending the conflict. On behalf of a 
grateful Nation, we honor our veterans’ cour-
age and their sacrifices to preserve peace and 
the blessings of liberty for an important ally 
and for the men, women and children who live 
in the Republic of South Korea.

E1373 
December 14, 2021 
For the third season in a row, the Moriah Vi-
kings earned a spot in the state championship 
game at the Syracuse Carrier Dome. Led by 
Coach Don Tesar, the Vikings rose to the 
challenge of the semifinal game and overcame 
adversity after trailing at halftime. Their effi-
cient offense converted three possessions into 
three touchdowns in the third quarter. The Vi-
kings carried this energy and the record of an 
undefeated season into the state champion-
ship. 
The Moriah Vikings put up a valiant effort 
against the Tioga Tigers during the Class D 
New York State Championship, where they 
came just short of winning their first state title. 
Thanks to a tremendous effort put forward by 
the defense, the Vikings only gave up seven 
points in the first half. Their perseverance and 
determination are truly inspirational and worthy 
of celebration. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional 
District, I would like to congratulate the Moriah 
Vikings on their incredible 2021 season. We 
are very proud of their hard work and dedica-
tion throughout this year.

IN RECOGNITION OF MAYOR TOM 
BERNARD 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to extend my warmest 
congratulations to Tom Bernard, a devoted 
public servant, for all that he has accom-
plished during his tenure as Mayor of the City 
of North Adams, Massachusetts. 
Mayor Bernard has invigorated the City of 
North Adams by expanding economic opportu-
nities and fostering modern, future-oriented 
growth. His administration has focused on in-
creasing green initiatives, with the integration 
of electric vehicles in the city’s fleet, strategic 
action to decrease North Adams’ carbon foot-
print, and launching the North Adams Tree Ini-
tiative. In addition, Mayor Bernard has been a 
staunch advocate for the marginalized in his 
community, working actively to increase diver-
sity and inclusion initiatives within the city’s 
government. Recognition of Indigenous Peo-
ples Day in North Adams came largely as a 
product of Mayor Bernard’s advocacy on these 
matters. 
Mayor Bernard has put significant effort in 
updating critical infrastructure in the city of 
North Adams despite the many challenges re-
sulting from the COVID–19 pandemic. Mayor 
Bernard successfully replaced all the non- 
functioning and malfunctioning hydrants, while 
simultaneously overseeing a full reevaluation 
of the city’s 60-year-old zoning laws, creating 
an avenue for much needed commerce in the 
city. 
Madam Speaker, in light of Mayor Tom Ber-
nard’s many achievements and remarkable 
contributions to the City of North Adams and 
the western Massachusetts community, I wish 
to congratulate him once again on his suc-
cessful tenure as Mayor of North Adams. He 
has undoubtedly played a pivotal role in shap-
ing the development of North Adams for years 
to come, and I am delighted to join with his 
family, friends, and the entire North Adams 
community in thanking him for his dedicated 
service.

CELEBRATING TECH SGT. JAMES 
FRANK BOUCHER ON HIS 100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. MIKE BOST 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate 
James 
Frank 
Boucher, 
of 
Murphysboro, Illinois, who celebrates his 
100th birthday on January 4, 2022. Known as 
Frank to his friends and family, Mr. Boucher 
was born on January 4, 1922, in Grimsby, Illi-
nois, to James and Lillie Boucher and grew up 
with his three siblings: Dorothy, Fred, and Ber-
nie. After graduating high school, Frank en-
tered World War II as a reconnaissance pilot 
in the Army Air Corps, flying a single engine 
Stinson L–5 in the Pacific Theater and rising 
to the rank of Technical Sergeant. His family’s 
favorite story to tell regards when Tech Ser-
geant Boucher was MIA for 14 days. Frank 
landed on a sandbar and traveled by night 
from village to village along the river. Using 
his pointy-talk book, he was able to commu-
nicate with the locals, which allowed him to 
work his way back to Yunan to be transported 
to Kumming Air Base. He was back flying mis-
sions the next day. In 1946, Frank returned 
home and married his wife, Zidania Francis 
Ogden. They were blessed with three boys. 
After working for the United States Postal 
Service for over 30 years, Frank retired and 
spent his newfound free time teaching his 
sons how to hunt and fish, and the importance 
of church and family. Over the years, his fam-
ily grew to six grandchildren, 22 great grand-
children, and two great-great grandchildren. 
Frank’s wife of 73 years passed away 2 years 
ago, but he’s still certain to cherish every mo-
ment shared with his family. Madam Speaker, 
please join me in honoring Tech Sergeant 
James Frank Boucher on his milestone 100th 
birthday. On behalf of Southern Illinois, thank 
you for your service to our Nation and happy 
birthday.

HONORING THE CAREER OF MR. 
KEVIN RYAN 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mr. Kevin Ryan of Fishers for his dedi-
cated service to Indiana’s financial sector as 
he prepares to retire as CEO of Financial 
Center First Credit Union. 
Kevin’s credit union career spans decades 
dating back to the 1980s. Most notably, he 
has led Financial Center First CU as its CEO 
since 2009. During his years leading the Fi-
nancial Center, the credit union has doubled in 
asset size to $828 million, with membership 
growth also doubling to more than 80,000. To 
this end, Financial Center is one of the na-
tion’s leading credit unions in financial literacy 
outreach, receiving national awards every year 
from 2014 to 2021 for those efforts. 
Kevin’s success with Financial Center made 
a tremendous impact on the lives of countless 
others in other ways, as well. Over the years, 
Financial Center raised hundreds of thousands 
of dollars through its annual golf outings to do-
nate to organizations feeding the hungry, in-
cluding the Mozel Sanders Foundation, the 
Salvation Army Food Pantry, and Gleaners 
Food Bank. 
In addition to this work, Kevin sought a way 
to pay tribute to Hoosier veterans. So, he trav-
eled to credit unions around the state to raise 
funds to construct the Indiana Military Vet-
erans Hall of Fame, which honors veterans 
with ties to Indiana. Now, generations of Hoo-
siers will have the opportunity to honor Indi-
ana’s heroes who fought to keep our country 
free. 
I am proud to honor Kevin as a testament 
to his work and legacy. I thank Kevin for all 
that he has done for our state, and we wish 
him the best as he begins the next chapter of 
his life.

IN GRATITUDE OF SIGRID GRACE 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an exceptional constituent 
and community leader in Michigan, Ms. Sigrid 
Grace. 
Ms. Grace is a lifelong Michigander who 
graduated from Central Michigan University 
where she met her late husband John Grace 
during her freshman year. 
As the Rochester Area Democratic Club 
Chair for over twenty-five years, Ms. Grace 
fostered and grew the club’s membership, 
supporting many causes and candidates. Our 
community is deeply grateful for her many 
years of leadership at RADC, and we con-
gratulate her on her recent retirement. 
Ms. Grace’s passion for education has no 
limits. She taught for forty years, most notably 
as a second-grade teacher in the Almont 
Community School District. 
Furthermore, Ms. Grace served as the local 
bargaining president on behalf of local edu-
cators and as a delegate for the Democratic 
National Convention from 2000 to 2004. She 
later became the National Chair of the early 
childhood education caucus at the National 
Education Association, where she advocated 
for the importance of pre-kindergarten edu-
cation. 
Ms. Grace currently resides in Rochester 
Hills, Michigan, where she volunteers at var-
ious community events and teaches school 
children how to read with her Shetland 
sheepdog, Baron. 
Fighting for Michigan teachers, Ms. Grace 
exemplifies what it means to be an educator 
and a community leader. Her work is inspiring 
and a positive example to many in Michigan 
and across the county. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the outstanding contributions 
Ms. Grace has made to Michigan, our teach-
ers, students, and our country at large.

DEPUTY 
SEC-
RETARY DOUG HOUSE ON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
FROM 
THE 
ILLI-
NOIS DEPARTMENT OF TRANS-
PORTATION 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Doug House, who is retiring as 
Deputy Secretary of the Illinois Department of 
Transportation after two and a half years of 
service. 
Throughout his life, in every action he has 
undertaken, Mr. House has selflessly served 
the public in pursuit of delivering a better Illi-
nois. He has always been a fighter for mean-
ingful change and produced real results for Illi-
noisans. His journey began in the Quad Cities 
region, when he graduated from Rockridge 
High School in Taylor Ridge, Illinois. Mr. 
House became a Staff Sergeant in the 182nd 
Airlift Wing of the Illinois Air National Guard in 
Peoria in 1980. He joined the 682nd Engineer 
Battalion of the U.S. Army Reserve in 1983, 
where he helped train heavy construction 
equipment operators to build roads until his 
honorable discharge in 1986. Mr. House’s 
commitment to revitalize our state’s infrastruc-
ture was only beginning and would stay with 
him over the next four decades. He oversaw 
the progress of many public works projects 
while presiding over the Illinois Chapter of the 
American 
Public 
Works 
Association. 
Mr. 
House, an advocate for workers’ rights, was 
named to The Indiana, Illinois, Iowa Founda-
tion for Fair Contracting as a construction ana-
lyst in 2016. In April 2019, he was hired as 
Deputy Secretary of the Illinois Department of 
Transportation. One of his proudest moments 
was being in Moline, Illinois on December 1, 
2021 for the opening of the I–74 Bridge, which 
will symbolize the hard-working spirit of our re-
gion for generations to come. 
It is because of diligent and noble leaders 
such as Doug House that I am especially 
proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congressional Dis-
trict. Madam Speaker, I would like to again 
formally congratulate Doug House on his two 
and a half years of service as Deputy Sec-
retary of the Illinois Department of Transpor-
tation.

HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the life and service of John Leroy 
Hill and Phyllis Lynn Stringfield Hill. 
John Leroy Hill was born on December 7, 
1953 in Cowpens, South Carolina. A true 
American hero, John joined the U.S. Army in 
1970 and bravely served our country for two 
decades. During this time, John served two 
tours in Korea, two tours in Germany, and 
tours in Fort Bragg, Fort Hood, and Fort Ord. 
He retired as a First Sergeant on January 1, 
1991. 
John met his wife Phyllis while he was on 
recruiting duty in Warsaw, Indiana. The two 
were married on January 23, 1991. Known as 
hometown heroes, both John and Phyllis are 
deeply involved and engaged members in 
their community. John has been the Com-
mander of the Clover Veterans of Foreign 
Wars Post 6732 since 2008. He was also the 
Commander of the Clover American Legion 
Post 38 until he was relieved by John Mat-
tingly earlier this year. Phyliss worked with 
Crystalen Mattingly to form a Ladies Auxiliary 
for the American Legion Post 38. 
In February of 2019, Phyllis retired and 
wanted to spend time traveling. While on an 
Alaskan cruise, Phyllis learned that she had a 
malignant mass. After further testing at the Le-
vine Cancer Institute in Charlotte, North Caro-
lina, the mass was shown to be cancerous. 
After being diagnosed with an aggressive 
Stage 4 cancer, Phyllis was informed in June 
of 2020 that she had only three to nine 
months to live. She courageously underwent 
radiation and chemotherapy treatments every 
day for six weeks. Throughout this entire or-
deal, Phyllis has remained a positive and faith-
ful believer of God’s healing powers. 
Despite her devastating prognosis, Phyllis 
recently received remarkable news. On De-
cember 2nd, while at a monthly follow-up ap-
pointment, her doctor informed her that he 
could no longer see any cancer in her CT 
scans. Her team of doctors were baffled as to 
how the cancer had disappeared. Phyllis told 
them it was her deep and honest belief in God 
that led her through this. 
On behalf of the 5th District of South Caro-
lina, I thank John and Phyllis for their incred-
ible service, and I commend them for their un-
wavering faith in the Lord. These two are an 
inspiration to us all. May God continue to 
bless them and their family.

CHIEF 
MARCUS REED 
HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Fire Chief Marcus Reed of 
Westfield, Indiana, on the occasion of his re-
tirement after a long tenure of public service. 
Chief Reed has spent the last five years as 
the Chief of the Westfield Fire Department fol-
lowing over two decades of fire department 
leadership around the country before that. His 
retirement will be a big loss for the community 
of Westfield and Hamilton County but a well- 
deserved reward for his tireless service to 
keep his neighbors safe through emergency 
response, training, and prevention . 
I thank Chief Marcus Reed for his dedicated 
public service. Our community is grateful for 
his leadership and his long career in public 
safety.

HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I’d like to 
congratulate the Scott Central Rebels and 
Coach Eric House on their MHSAA 2A State 
Championship victory. Coach House led the 
Rebels to an almost unchallenged 15–0 sea-
son with huge margins of victory over their op-
ponents, ending the season with a MHSAA 
record-breaking 72 points in the championship 
game. I commend Coach House for his suc-
cess at the helm of the Rebels football team 
and wish him and his team continued success 
in the future. 
I would also like to extend my congratula-
tions to the young men who worked tirelessly 
for the championship trophy. Every early 
morning, every extra rep, and every sacrifice 
they made to better themselves and their team 
has resulted in the top prize. 
In the coming days, as the thrill of victory 
begins to fade, I would encourage those 
young men to reflect deeply on the investment 
they made to realize this championship. They 
will never forget the feeling of their great ac-
complishment; but in the future, as they remi-
nisce on this victory, 1 would challenge them 
to remember the qualities that made them 
champions. 
Those qualities of hard-work, commitment, 
and determination will continue to serve them 
well in the future as they transition from lead-
ers on the field to leaders in their families, 
communities, state, and Nation. 
Congratulations to the Scott Central Rebels. 
They earned this victory.

CHAPEL OAKS V.F.D. 75TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
& 
GORHAM 
FAMILY 
TRIBUTE 
HON. ANTHONY G. BROWN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the 75th Anniversary 
of The Chapel Oaks Volunteer Fire Depart-
ment and pay tribute to Leroy and Lillian Gor-
ham’s first born children; Jean, Ruth and 
Leroy, Jr. On Saturday August 23, 1946 these 
children perished in a house fire at 1302 51st 
Street in the Prince George’s County Commu-
nity of Deanwood Park. The tragic loss of 
these three young lives was the cause for the 
establishment of The Chapel Oaks Volunteer 
Fire Department; Maryland’s First All-African 
American Fire Company. Jean had just cele-
brated her 5th birthday and was slated to at-
tend kindergarten in the fall, Ruth was a typ-
ical 2-year-old toddler and Leroy, Jr. was 11- 
months old and had taken his first unassisted 
steps that day. The Gorham family lived in the 
middle unit of a 3-unit house, where the fire 
engulfed all 3 units of the house. Neighbor 
and good friend Roy Lee Jordan attempted to 
save the children, but was unsuccessful. 
The first fire department on the scene that 
day was from the District of Columbia. With 
the fire hydrant connections not being compat-
ible, Engine Company 27 had to run their 
hoses across the busy thoroughfare of East-
ern Ave. from the District of Columbia side to 
the Maryland side. According to those in the 
community, the nearby white fire stations in 
Maryland, which were minutes away from the 
Gorham’s home, often responded slowly or 
not at all to emergencies in the surrounding 
African American communities. 
The loss of his three children in a house fire 
was the motivation behind Mr. Gorham and 
his friend Roy Lee Jordan’s personal mission 
to form a fire department and spare others the 
pain he suffered firsthand. Mobilized by this 
tragedy and determined not to let another per-
son perish because of the racial discord, be-
fore the end of the year without any formal 
knowledge, experience or equipment; Mr. Gor-
ham and Mr. Jordan along with members of 
the Deanwood Park and Chapel Oaks Com-
munities founded the Chapel Oaks Volunteer 
Fire Department. 
They started out in the 5700 Block of Sheriff 
Road in a barn rented to them by Ms. Eleanor 
Dodson, where they operated a small used 
fire engine. By August of 1947 the next year, 
they had a fire engine and a fire truck on 
Sheriff Road. Just as they were starting to 
make headway, in September a fire started in 
their makeshift firehouse; causing major dam-
age to the building and damaging their second 
fire engine that was under repair. Not to be 
discouraged, the men of this community 
worked evenings and weekends mixing mortar 
and laying bricks to build a cinder block build-
ing with their own hands to replace the old 
barn that was destroyed. 
This experience showed the men of this 
community that delivery of emergency serv-
ices was not only a need, but a calling to ful-
fill. It was this innate spirit that they often had 
to lean on for strength to overcome the chal-
lenges and roadblocks they were faced with. 
They had to put up with blatant racial discrimi-
nation. They were called racial slurs and spat 
on. And orders given by Black fire officers 
being ignored by white fire fighters. 
Other fire companies supported Chapel 
Oaks privately, secretly leaving their old equip-
ment at the firehouse when no one was 
around or selling their used fire engines. 
Chapel Oaks also had to deal with the fact 
that the county fire association only accepted 
white males and Chapel Oaks VFD did not re-
ceive official calls. Yet they responded to 
alerts by their neighbors and often arrived be-
fore the officially dispatched units. It was rou-
tine for these fire fighters to respond to calls 
in their area without being dispatched. This 
level of dedication was a commendable, but it 
came at a cost. There were attempts to run 
their engines off the road while responding to 
a call and other fire companies taking credit 
for rescues made by Chapel Oaks was com-
monplace. 
To meet the requirements to have two Class 
A fire service vehicles, this resilient group of 
men and grateful community put on bake 
sales, sold dinners, had carnival and held var-
ious fundraisers to raise money to buy a new 
fire engine. One volunteer was a businessman 
who put up his gas station as collateral, nine 
others took out second mortgages on their 
homes to support the effort to buy their first 
piece of new fire apparatus, a 1957 FWD. 
Property at 5312 Sheriff Rd. was purchased 
for the organization by Mr. Charles Lancaster 
and the members once again set out to build 
their new firehouse. Eleven years after being 
formed in December 1957 Chapel Oaks VFD 
had a brand-new engine, to move into their 
newly constructed firehouse that they owned 
and still own to this day. 
A decade and a half after being inspired to 
train and equip themselves, raising fund to 
buy their own vehicles, and building two 
firehouses. You would think that Chapel Oaks 
Volunteer Fire Department would have done 
enough to have proven their commitment to 
the fire service and their value to the county. 
This was not the case as they entered the 
1960’s and they were still not members of the 
Prince Georges’ County Fireman’s Associa-
tion. Membership in this organization was im-
portant not only because of the network of fire 
fighters to glean information from and the offi-
cial training opportunities; but most important 
was the eligibility to share in the county fire 
tax that would pay for operating expenses. 
Chapel Oaks had to petition the state legisla-
ture for a share of the fire tax-receiving 7 per-
cent to other stations 31 percent-and residents 
complained that their local company was not 
automatically dispatched. 
Almost 25 years since the tragic Deanwood 
Park fire, in March of 1971, Chapel Oaks was 
fed up with the obvious discrimination and 
filed suit against Prince George’s County. The 
suit alleged noncompliance with the call sys-
tem and the need for a new firehouse. At the 
time, equipment had broken down that im-
paired response times to its constituents and 
the station sought emergency funding from the 
county. Willie Rodney, Fire Station 38’s chief 
at the time, summed up the frustration with the 
need for the lawsuit. ‘‘We do the same job and 
come to the same standards as the other 
companies. But all we’ve been getting are 
promises, promises, promises.’’ 
County Executive William W. Gallett threat-
ened to withhold the request for emergency 
funding because of the pending lawsuit. The 
county council granted the funding. By 1980 a 
new station was built and Chapel Oaks Prince 
George’s County Fire Department included 
them in their system by designating the En-
gine No. 38. They also became members of 
the volunteer association attending annual 
convention, winning many parade trophies and 
garnering much deserved respect for their ac-
complishments. 
Chapel Oaks has been a great asset to the 
community not only for delivery of emergency 
services, but the numerous lives that have 
been enhanced by their experience after serv-
ing with Chapel Oaks. Among them are Mr. 
Luther Cruchfeild who was the First African 
American to be hired by Prince George’s 
County Fire Department and Retired Fire In-
spector Lenard Lewis was hired later and be-
came the first African American to be pro-
moted. There also was a young teen named 
Johnathan Bolden who just hung around the 
firehouse giving him something productive to 
do. Now a local businessman he has served 
in many positions at Chapel Oaks, VFD in-
cluding Chief. As one of the few African Amer-
ican instructors he has filled a vital role at the 
University of Maryland College Park Fire Res-
cue Institute, and is a Prince Georges’ County 
Fire Commissioner. He credits Chapel Oaks 
and the fire fighters there for nurturing his in-
terest in the fire service and setting the foun-
dation for his work ethic. There are genera-
tions of fire fighters serving in Maryland, Vir-
ginia and the District of Columbia fire depart-
ments that have been motivated, trained and 
mentored by The Chapel Oaks Fire VFD. 
They can always use good people and are ex-
cited about the opportunity to find new re-
cruits, welcome them in the Chapel Oaks 
Family and train another generation of fire 
fighters. 
The tragic death of Jean, Ruth and Leroy, 
Jr. was the driving force for their parents to 
create a legacy for them. They were deter-
mined that their children’s death would not be 
in vain. Mr. Gorham held numerous offices 
during his 54-year career at the Chapel Oaks 
Volunteer Fire Department, including Chief, 
President and Chairman of the Board. He was 
a very active life member. His wife Lillian was 
also a member of the Chapel Oaks Volunteer 
Fire Department Ladies Auxiliary in the early 
years of its formation. With this year being the 
75th Anniversary of the tragic fire which took 
these three young lives. I would like to pay 
tribute to Jean Gorham, Ruth Gorham and 
Leroy Gorham, Jr. They have done more in 
their death than many get to do in their lives. 
I would like to acknowledge the strength of 
their parents Leroy and Lillian Gorham. I 
would also like to recognize Mr. Roy Lee Jor-
dan for his heroism and bravery, along with 
his determination to assist in the legacy of the 
three children that he was unable to save. I 
would be remiss not to commend the afore-
mentioned communities and the countless 
numbers of people who have helped build, 
grow and maintain Chapel Oaks Volunteer 
Fire Department. In addition, I want to thank 
the current leadership of Engine 38 ‘‘The 
Oaks’’ as they continue to provide services to 
Prince George’s County. On this 75th Anniver-
sary I wish all the best to future members of 
Engine 38 and their contributions to the fire 
service and Prince George’s County.

REMEMBERING HENRY CLYDE 
HARRISON, JR. 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 14, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to take the time to re-
member a friend and great South Carolinian, 
Henry Clyde Harrison, Jr. Henry was someone 
that dedicated himself to the safety of his 
community as a Highway Patrol officer and 
worked to bring people together. He was in-
strumental in the development of American 
services and creating over 5,000 jobs. Our 
family is especially grateful for his counsel and 
support of Attorney General Alan Wilson. 
HENRY CLYDE HARRISON, JR. 
(February 21, 1932–December 12, 2021) 
Henry Clyde Harrison Jr., 89, passed away 
on Sunday December 12, 2021 at his home in 
Greenville South Carolina. 
Henry was blessed with a large and loving 
family. He is survived by his love and life 
partner Tracy Lamb, his children; son Randy 
Harrison (Beth), his daughters Carole Ann 
Owens (Kent), Pauline Joy Green (Tim), Aus-
tin Harrison, his grandchildren Heidi Boyce, 
Henry 
T. 
Harrison, 
Will 
Owens, 
Anna 
Ornelas, Carly Owens, Chase Green, Aiden 
Green, Honor Neely, Willa Green and Wynnie 
Green his great grandchildren Harrison, 
Caroline, Bailey, Ava, Lily, Lauren, and 
Alivia. He is also survived by his second wife 
Glenda Harrison and her children Kim Alex-
ander (Donnie), Kellie O’Donald (Roger), and 
Al Harrison (Kim) and grandchildren Cody 
O’Donald, Carson Lollis, Kolby Mccuen, and 
Brady Harrison, and great grandchildren 
Hadlee and Fallon all who he loved dearly. 
He was the last surviving child of the late 
Clyde and Pauline (Womble) Harrison. Henry 
was predeceased by his 10 siblings, Dot 
Floyd, Frances Ray, Elizabeth Baker, Lee 
Ellis, Mildred Lollis, Margaret Shenk, and 
Bill, John, Heyward, and Charlie Harrison as 
well as his first wife Carole Harrison. 
Henry was born on February 21st, 1932 in 
the Union Bleachery community in Green-
ville, South Carolina before moving to Sans 
Souci where he grew up. From a young age, 
Henry exhibited 2 qualities that would come 
to be known as characteristics to all those 
who knew him; hard work and the ability to 
make friends. When he was 6 years old, he 
had his first paper route, times were tough 
and he used the money he earned to help his 
family. He was known as the small boy; the 
one being followed by all the neighborhood 
dogs. He carried scraps and treats to feed 
them following the motto ‘‘better for them 
to be happy to see you coming!’’. Henry grew 
up in Greenville and graduated from Parker 
High School before joining the Highway Pa-
trol and taking his first post in Cherokee 
County. On the patrol, he quickly distin-
guished himself as an officer who was truly 
there to serve. He believed that every single 
person he came across, on the job or in life, 
deserved to be treated with dignity and re-
spect. He made sure everyone knew he 
worked for the people and it was his job to 
keep the roads safe for them and most im-
portantly, 
their 
children. 
Through 
the 
course of his career on the patrol, Henry was 
able to move back to Greenville in 1962. 
While he never ran for office, Henry had a 
servant’s heart and a love for politics. He 
was extremely active not only in the local 
Upstate community but in the entire state of 
South Carolina. He had no interest in par-
tisanship, in divisive times he was known for 
working with everyone with the goal of 
bringing people together for the good of all. 
In 1975 he decided to retire from the Highway 
Patrol as a Sergeant and start his own com-
pany. Henry started American Security from 
his living room and quickly expanded it into 
a corporation that at various times served 
clients in seven states and employed over 
5,500 people, known today as American Serv-
ices. Henry believed in hard work. He classi-
cally stated, ‘‘The good Lord gives everyone 
168 hours a week, how we use them is up to 
us.’’ Henry proudly served as the Chairman 
of the Board and CEO of American Services 
until the day he went to be with his lord. 
Henry, Chief, Big Henry, The Chairman, 
Slick, Dad, Daddy, Papa, Papa Slick, loved 
people for the entirety of his life and will be 
remembered for his love by his many friends 
and family while they wait to join him in the 
Kingdom of God. 
Visitation will be held on Thursday De-
cember 16, 2021 at Mackey Mortuary at Cen-
tury Drive from 4pm–7pm. A memorial serv-
ice will be held at Sans Souci Church located 
at 3100 Old Buncombe Road, Greenville 
South Carolina, 29609 on Friday December 17 
at 11:00 am. Entombment will follow the 
service at Woodlawn Memorial Park, 1901 
Wade Hampton Blvd Greenville, SC 29609. In 
lieu of flowers, the family asks for memo-
rials to be sent to Sans Souci Church, St. 
Jude’s Children Hospital, Tri-County Vet 
Tech Program or Dr. William Schmidt and 
Dr. Susan Shi Legacy Fund and Institute for 
Child Success.
