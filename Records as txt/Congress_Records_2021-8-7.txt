PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Precious Lord, Your power, mercy, 
and grace continue to sustain us. Your 
power energizes us to face the chal-
lenges that require more than human 
wisdom. Your mercy protects us when 
we fall short of your glory, and your 
grace gives us merit we don’t deserve. 
Lord, empower our Senators for to-
day’s journey, providing them with 
confidence to draw near to You. May 
they pass through this day in compan-
ionship with You, lifting their hearts 
frequently in prayer. Give them wis-
dom to learn to be faithful stewards of 
the gifts You have provided. 
We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KELLY). The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest 
the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I 
am going to do the administrative 
stuff. 
f 
MEASURES PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 2670 and S. 2671 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I un-
derstand there are two bills at the desk 
due for a second reading en bloc. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the bills by title for a 
second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 2670) to provide for redistricting 
reform, and for other purposes. 
A bill (S. 2671) to amend the Federal Elec-
tion Campaign Act of 1971 to provide for ad-
ditional disclosure requirements for corpora-
tions, labor organizations, Super PACs and 
other entities, and for other purposes. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in 
order to place the bills on the calendar 
under provisions of rule XIV, I would 
object to further proceedings en bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tions having been heard, the bills will 
be placed on the calendar. 
f 
INVEST IN AMERICA ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this 
morning, we resume consideration of 
the 
bipartisan 
infrastructure 
bill. 
There will be a vote at noon to invoke 
cloture on the substitute amendment, 
which will move the process forward by 
the book. 
Democrats are very eager to start 
voting on further amendments, but we 
need consent from the Chamber to 
schedule those amendment votes. We 
worked all day Thursday to come up 
with an agreement with our Repub-
lican colleagues on such a package but 
unfortunately were not able to. So we 
can get this done the easy way or the 
hard way. In either case, the Senate 
will stay in session until we finish our 
work. It is up to my Republican col-
leagues how long it takes. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
f 
INVEST IN AMERICA ACT 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I applaud 
what the majority leader just said. We 
are here. A lot of Senators, both Re-
publicans and Democrats, have rear-
ranged schedules to be here. Let’s go 
forth and do the country’s business. If 
people have amendments they want, 
bring them up. Vote them up or vote 
them down. But let’s just get on and do 
our work.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S5994 
August 7, 2021 
My Appropriations Committee staff 
worked very, very hard with both the 
Republican and Democratic side on the 
parts of this piece of legislation that 
required work from the Appropriations 
Committee. They have worked week-
ends, evenings—long, long days—draft-
ing and redrafting and redrafting to 
make sure that people on both sides ap-
proved of what they wanted. Now, the 
American people expect us to vote. We 
are here. Let’s vote. 
I am happy to see Republican amend-
ments 
or 
Democratic 
amendments 
come up. But it is one thing to talk 
about them on the news shows or on so-
cial media or trying to talk to the 
press in the halls and make sound 
bites; it is another thing to actually 
vote. Let’s vote. Let’s let people know 
where we stand. That is how the people 
in our State know where we stand. 
Frankly, those who are afraid they 
may cast a vote that creates prob-
lems—but we are not here to cast only 
popular votes. I have cast more votes 
than all but one person in the history 
of this country. I have cast well over 
16,000, almost 17,000 votes. I am sure I 
can go back over those votes and find 
some and say: Hmm, in retrospect, I 
might have voted the other way. But I 
voted. 
What we are doing in not bringing 
this up and getting this done, we are 
trying to vote ‘‘maybe.’’ I don’t know 
anybody in my State, Republican or 
Democrat, who elected Senators to say: 
We want you to vote ‘‘maybe.’’ No. We 
want you to vote. 
It doesn’t mean the people of my 
State will agree on every vote. I hope 
that they will agree on a lot of them. 
But I will represent my State. I will 
represent my conscience. But I will 
represent the Senate, and I will rep-
resent my oath of office. My oath of of-
fice is not to just sit here and do noth-
ing but talk to the press and others; 
my oath of office is, I respect the Con-
stitution, and I will vote. So let’s hope 
they vote. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
f 
INVEST IN AMERICA ACT 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, the Senate will decide whether 
to move the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill closer toward a final vote. 
Like I said before, I am quite con-
fident that, out of 100 U.S. Senators, 
there are 100 of us who believe the bill 
is imperfect. This isn’t exactly the bill 
I would have written on my own in my 
office, and 99 of my colleagues would 
say the very same thing. This is a com-
promise product crafted by colleagues 
with big, principled differences in a 
Senate with the narrowest possible 
split. 
But in my view, what our early 
statesmen called ‘‘internal improve-
ment’’ is a core government responsi-
bility. 
The 
American 
people 
need 
roads, bridges, ports, and airports to 
build their businesses, build their fami-
lies, and build their lives. Republicans 
and Democrats have radically different 
visions these days, but both those vi-
sions include physical infrastructure 
that works for all of our citizens. 
As the Kentucky Farm Bureau wrote 
to me recently, the investments this 
bill will make are not just necessary; 
in many cases they are overdue. Our 
country has real needs in this area. 
There are many outstanding amend-
ments that are important, that would 
improve this legislation, and that de-
serve votes before the Senate is asked 
to vote on the final passage of this bill. 
The full Senate deserves its full chance 
to shape this important legislation. I 
hope Senators can work together in a 
bipartisan way to get more amend-
ments up and continue improving this 
important bill. Our colleagues on both 
sides deserve to be heard. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. The Democratic 
leader is indicating, in a few days, he 
will 
thrust 
the 
Senate 
into 
an 
ultrapartisan showdown over the stag-
geringly reckless taxing-and-spending 
spree that Democrats want to ram 
through later this year. 
The size and the scope of Chairman 
SANDERS’ socialist shopping list will 
make every disagreement we had in 
landing the infrastructure compromise 
look like a rounding error—new perma-
nent welfare with no work require-
ments, reams of Green New Deal man-
dates, massive tax hikes that shrink 
wages and kill jobs, government med-
dling in childcare that would privilege 
certain families’ choices over others, 
amnesty for illegal immigrants in the 
middle of a border crisis. 
At a time Democrats’ spending al-
ready—already—has 
inflation 
ham-
mering American families, Republicans 
could not be more eager to debate our 
colleagues on all of these subjects. We 
can’t wait to get Democrats on record 
over many more trillions—trillions—of 
dollars and reckless borrowing to fund 
socialist spending on radical policies 
that families are not asking for. 
Our philosophy is the polar opposite. 
Republican policies would create good 
jobs, strong wage growth, and stable 
prices for middle-class families, just 
like our country had just a year and a 
half ago—the most pro-worker econ-
omy in a generation, just a year and a 
half ago. 
Republicans want to give working 
families the tools and the opportunity 
to build the lives that they want. 
Democrats want to force them to live 
the lives the Democrats want. 
The stakes in this debate could not 
be higher, and very soon the country 
will see it aired out here right on the 
Senate floor. 
The Democratic leader will be put-
ting the full radicalism of the far left 
right here on this floor. He is making 
every one of his Members vote on noth-
ing less—nothing less—than Chairman 
SANDERS’ dream shopping list. Every 
American family will know exactly 
where their Senator stands. 
f 
NOMINATION OF DAVID H. 
CHIPMAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. On one final mat-
ter, I have already discussed how the 
Biden administration has nominated a 
proud and proven opponent of Ameri-
can’s constitutional rights to run the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, 
and Explosives. 
I don’t think there could be any more 
evidence that David Chipman is the 
wrong choice to serve as the top Fed-
eral administrator of firearms policy. 
He has a long record of hostility to 
lawful gun owners, a variety of com-
plaints from those who worked with 
him in the past. 
How could it get worse? 
Mr. Chipman has suggested radical 
and sweeping steps, like banning pri-
vate sales that are lawful, overriding 
State laws, and imposing sweeping re-
strictions on a class of weapons he has 
yet to clearly define. 
Among some current and former ATF 
agents, he has earned a concerning rep-
utation as a ‘‘bully’’ and ‘‘activist’’ 
whose extreme views threaten to un-
dermine the trust the Agency needs to 
conduct oversight. And sources within 
the ATF have also come forward de-
scribing alleged racially discrimina-
tory comments the nominee made in 
the workplace regarding personnel de-
cisions. 
So even a few days ago, it was not 
difficult to realize this is an instance 
in which the Senate, on a bipartisan 
basis, should take a pass. But some-
how, in just the last few days, it has 
actually gotten worse. 
Earlier this week, news reports indi-
cated that Mr. Chipman had failed to 
disclose to our colleagues on the Judi-
ciary Committee a TV appearance he 
made several years ago. This wasn’t 
just any TV appearance; Mr. Chipman 
had granted an interview to a propa-
ganda network overseen by the Chinese 
Government. 
A new letter to the Senate, signed by 
seven 
former 
career 
ATF 
agents, 
summed it up this way: Mr. Chipman’s 
views and record would ‘‘create serious 
and long-lasting problems for the Bu-
reau and the effective execution of its 
law enforcement mission.’’ 
The Senate has spent quite enough 
time flirting with this profoundly mis-
guided nomination. The American peo-
ple deserve a trustworthy steward lead-
ing the ATF, with a record of respect-
ing their rights and respecting his or

CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning 
business is closed. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
INVESTING IN A NEW VISION FOR 
THE 
ENVIRONMENT 
AND 
SUR-
FACE 
TRANSPORTATION 
IN 
AMERICA ACT—Resumed 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of H.R. 3684, which 
the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 3684) to authorize funds for 
Federal-aid highways, highway safety pro-
grams, and transit programs, and for other 
purposes. 
Pending: 
Schumer (for Sinema) amendment No. 2137, 
in the nature of a substitute. 
Carper-Capito amendment No. 2131 (to 
amendment No. 2137), to strike a definition. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, this 
week, the Senate has been considering 
historic infrastructure legislation. 
We have seen a lot of positives in this 
process. Twenty-two amendments have 
been processed, and 12 of those amend-
ments have been adopted. Many of 
those are bipartisan amendments that 
our fellow Senators have worked on to-
gether. 
On Thursday, we saw the process hit 
a snag. We have colleagues who sin-
cerely want to debate their remaining 
amendments, but we had objections 
that prevented our votes from moving 
forward. In my view, that is unfortu-
nate. I want everybody’s voice to be 
heard because a number of the amend-
ments awaiting action would actually 
improve this legislation, and, again, we 
have consensus on both sides on that. I 
hope we can reach agreement on a 
package of amendments that can re-
ceive votes before we pass this bill in 
final. 
In particular, I support an amend-
ment that Senator CORNYN from Texas 
would like to offer to allow States to 
use previously appropriated COVID 
funding 
to 
finance 
infrastructure 
projects. 
When I began negotiating with the 
White House in April and May, this was 
one of the things that I put on the 
table with the President, and I know 
the G–20 has also had this on the table 
with the President. So it has been a 
topic of great discussion both here in 
the Senate but also with the White 
House as well. The Cornyn-Padilla 
amendment would unlock tens of bil-
lions of dollars—more for highway, 
transit, and housing infrastructure— 
without adding to the cost of this legis-
lation. 
I plan to vote for cloture at 12 noon 
because this infrastructure legislation 
makes important investments in our 
Nation’s future. I am a West Virginian, 
and all West Virginians and all Ameri-
cans will benefit from the roads, 
bridges, 
water 
infrastructure, 
broadband, and other modes of core in-
frastructure that would be financed 
through this bill, but I believe some-
thing more foundational than infra-
structure is at stake here. 
We need to demonstrate to the Amer-
ican people that we can work together 
in this Congress to pass major legisla-
tion that benefits our country and, I 
might add, legislation that we have 
passed more than a few times in the 
past. Infrastructure is that perfect 
place to do that. 
Senator CARPER and I led the Envi-
ronment and Public Works Committee 
with the surface transportation reau-
thorization bill, and the Presiding Offi-
cer is on that committee. We passed 
that out of our committee with unani-
mous support, and we also passed a 
drinking water bill that passed out of 
our committee with unanimous sup-
port but also out of this body with 89 
votes. Both of those bills are included 
in this package in their entirety. Bi-
partisan bills reported by Commerce 
and the Energy Committees are also 
included. 
I certainly appreciated Chairman 
CARPER’s leadership and partnership 
throughout the entire process. I appre-
ciate the efforts of our colleagues in 
the G–22 who have worked with each 
other tirelessly and with the Biden ad-
ministration to get us to this point. 
We will soon have a chance to ad-
vance this infrastructure legislation 
toward final passage. Is this bill per-
fect? No—no compromise legislation 
ever is—but it will make a big dif-
ference in modernizing our country’s 
infrastructure. More than that, we will 
demonstrate that both Republicans and 
Democrats can come together and do 
big things that move our country for-
ward. 
I have just a bit of a recitation to re-
mind folks what is in this bill. I will 
try to speed this part up. 
The bill provides $303.5 billion over 5 
years for Federal highway programs—a 
35-percent increase. That investment 
represents historic funding for our 
roads and bridges and provides States 
with the long-term certainty that they 
need and flexibility that they need to 
complete projects. 
The bill ensures that 90 percent of 
the funding is distributed by formula— 
very predictable. It gives the States 
the certainty they need to prioritize 
their projects. For West Virginia, that 
means over $3 billion over 5 years. That 
is a huge investment for our State and 
much needed. 
This bill also creates something that 
I am passionate about, the Rural Sur-
face Transportation Grant Program to 
award $2 billion in competitive grants 
over 5 years to improve and expand 
roads and bridges in rural America. I 
am especially excited that this pro-
gram has a 25-percent set-aside for 
projects that support the completion of 
the Appalachia Development Highway 
System, otherwise known as ADHS. 
That set-aside means ADHS projects in 
West Virginia are eligible to compete 
for $500 million over 5 years in discre-
tionary grants. This package will move 
our Corridor H project along signifi-
cantly because we know that that 
project will be getting $195 million, and 
this grant program opens up the possi-
bility of more. This is a vital connec-
tion in our State for our tourism and 
our economy. It also will open us up 
even broader to the east coast. 
West Virginia will receive $506 mil-
lion to refund and repair our State’s 
bridges, addressing a critical need cer-
tainly in our State and across the Na-
tion. This funding is part of the single 
largest investment in bridge infra-
structure since the construction of the 
Interstate Highway System. 
Briefly, 
the 
bill 
recognizes 
that 
broadband is core infrastructure and 
prioritizes unserved communities. This 
is the area I have gotten really the 
most questions about: What is this 
going to do for West Virginia, for the 
digital divide areas that are still 
unserved? 
Today, 
education, 
tourism, 
healthcare all rely on high internet 
speeds. I launched my Capito Connect 
Initiative 
in 
2015 
to 
help 
expand 
broadband infrastructure in our State. 
Many communities that lack adequate 
broadband are already struggling eco-
nomically. It is impossible to compete 
for jobs if a community cannot offer 
good internet service, causing these 
areas to fall even further behind. And I 
will say, since the pandemic, rural 
America—as we have known who live 
in rural America—is a great and won-
derful place to live. More people in con-
gested areas are realizing there are a 
lot more pluses in rural America than 
what, maybe, they might have realized 
over a year ago. 
The bill invests $65 billion to help fix 
our country’s digital divide. That fund-
ing would support a formula-based 
grant program to States and also sup-
ports competitive grants, like the 
USDA’s ReConnect Program. 
Additionally, this bill makes large 
investments in clean and safe drinking 
water; it provides resources that will 
put West Virginians to work cleaning 
up our abandoned mines and orphaned 
wells. 
Every Senator could stand here and 
tell similar stories about the invest-
ment that this bill will make in his or 
her own State. This is the perfect time 
for us to come together toward the end 
of a summer that has been full of stops 
and starts, and we need to pass this 
legislation that will benefit every 
American. 
I hope my colleagues will join me to 
advance this important legislation to-
ward its passage.

August 7, 2021 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask

Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to be able to com-
plete my remarks this morning. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, well, 
soon we are going to vote on cloture, 
and we will move toward, I hope, con-
cluding our consideration of the Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act. 
I have spoken, as our Presiding Offi-
cer knows, over the last few days quite 
a bit as to why the legislation we are 
considering today is so important. 
I think that as we prepare to take 
this vote, though, we ought to take 
maybe just another minute or two and 
reflect on the bill’s merits and the 
needs that it will address—important 
needs it will address—for our country. 
In my opening statement, several 
days ago, I reminded the Senate that 
the state of our Nation’s infrastructure 
currently ranks and rates at a C-minus 
according to the American Society of 
Civil Engineers. That is not the infra-
structure that the American people 
want or need in the 21st century. 
In the jurisdiction of the Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee, 
which Senator CAPITO and I are privi-
leged to lead and which the Presiding 
Officer is a new member of, this bill in-
cludes language that will make his-
toric investments in our roads, our 
highways, and our bridges—a 34 per-
cent increase, if you will, over the last 
5 years. The bill will also reauthorize 
our drinking water and our water sani-
tation programs at robust new levels. 
As we take this vote, I think it is im-
portant to reflect on our past efforts. I 
want to go back in time and why this 
vote is so important today. 
Since I first joined the Congress as a 
brandnew freshman Congressman from 
Delaware in 1982, we have updated our 
transportation laws in this country 
some eight times—eight times. With 
each of these efforts we have tried to 
improve our policies, address gaps, in-
corporate new information, and deliver 
needed resources. 
The modern era of these transpor-
tation laws began in 1991. George Her-
bert Walker Bush was the President, 
and Congress passed and then Presi-
dent Bush signed into law legislation 
called the Intermodal Surface Trans-
portation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA, as 
it was called at the time—ISTEA. 
Until ISTEA legislation was adopt-
ed—enacted and signed into law—as a 
matter of Federal policy, we divided 
transportation into separate systems. 
We had, on the one hand, highways; an-
other hand we had rail; another hand 
we had transit, and our policies really 
didn’t consider them as a united, uni-
fied, integrated system, which is how 
most commuters and most travelers in 
our Nation really thought it to be. 
ISTEA sought to change that. ISTEA 
sought to change that by requiring in-
tegrated regional planning of transpor-
tation systems that accounted for and 
better facilitated connections amongst 
our highways, our rail, and our transit 
to enable more efficient freight move-
ment and more efficient movement of 
people. 
It was around the same time that we 
also integrated our transportation pol-
icy with the Clean Water Act, which 
represented a major strengthening of 
our pollution laws to respond to urban 
smog, acid rain, ozone depletion, and 
other air pollution problems. 
For the first time, transportation 
planning was obliged to take into ac-
count pollution from mobile sources 
and take steps to reduce the consider-
able contribution of transportation to 
our pollution. 
Today’s 
legislation 
substantially 
builds on our historic efforts to reduce 
dangerous emissions like greenhouse 
gases and particulate matter that spew 
from too many of our cars, our buses, 
and other modes of transportation. 
Congress took another major leap in 
transportation policy a few years later, 
in 1998, in fact, with the Transpor-
tation Equity Act for the 21st Century, 
also known as TEA–21, which focused 
on improving safety while advancing 
America’s economic growth and com-
petitiveness. 
Nearly 10 years later, in 2005, as 
transportation fatalities reached a 10- 
year high of over 43,000 people—over 
43,000 
people—President 
George 
W. 
Bush, son of Herbert Walker Bush, 
signed into law the Safe, Accountable, 
Flexible, Efficient Transportation Eq-
uity Act: A Legacy for Users. That is a 
long title, but we found an acronym for 
it, SAFETEA–LU, in 2005. 
At its core, the key was that this leg-
islation improved highway transpor-
tation safety through the creation of 
the Highway Safety Improvement Pro-
gram to reduce highway fatalities. 
Then, 
in 
2012, 
President 
Obama 
signed into law the Moving Ahead for 
Progress in the 21st Century Act, 
known as MAP–21. Responding to con-
cerns about the growth of the number 
of small programs, MAP–21 sought to 
simplify the highway program struc-
ture, 
provide 
more 
flexibility 
to 
States, while also increasing their ac-
countability and focusing on perform-
ance outcomes, including safety, asset 
conditions, congestion, and air quality. 
Congress reauthorized our transpor-
tation laws most recently in 2015, when 
President Obama signed into law the 
Fixing America’s Surface Transpor-
tation Act, or FAST. 
The FAST Act focused on freight 
movement, supported with new for-
mula and competitive grants for high-
way and intermodal freight, as well as 
a focus on Federal and State freight 
planning efforts. 
Today, our Interstate System is a 
critical national asset, carrying over a 
quarter of all motor vehicle travel in 
our Nation—over one-quarter—despite 
being only 1 percent of all lane miles. 
These highways have enabled a sig-
nificant expansion of truck movement, 
including supporting local businesses, 
interstate 
commerce, 
international 
trade, and providing Americans with 
access to low-cost goods and services. 
Along with the many benefits of 
interstate highways have come indis-
putable costs. Highways have spawned 
sprawling auto-dependent and develop-
ment patterns that exacerbate green-
house gas emissions, thus compro-
mising our efforts to deal with a chang-
ing climate. 
Interstate highways divided commu-
nities and were often intentionally 
built through minority and low-income 
neighborhoods, becoming tangible evi-
dence of racism. Today, more than 
36,000 people lose their lives each year 
on our roadways. While we seek to 
maintain the mobility benefits of the 
Federal-aid highway system, we must 
also acknowledge and address these 
significant detriments. 
We have been at the hard work of 
transportation policy for a long, long 
time in this country, and we have en-
joyed major success, benefiting our 
people and our economy. And if we are 
honest with ourselves, we have made 
quite a few mistakes along the way, di-
viding communities with poorly con-
sidered projects and developing a trans-
portation sector that produces twice as 
much greenhouse gas emissions as any 
other country’s transportation sector. 
We have an opportunity to learn 
from both success and failure, and we 
must account for new challenges that 
were not on our radar screen in the 
past—not the least of which are the se-
rious threat of climate change and the 
obvious specter of environmental injus-
tice. 
Today, we are rising to the challenge. 
The bill before us, the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act, includes, 
among other provisions, the largest 
Federal investment in public transit in 
history; the largest investment in 
clean drinking water and wastewater 
infrastructure in history; the largest 
investment in clean energy trans-
mission in history; the largest invest-
ment in climate resiliency in history; 
and the largest investment in transpor-
tation electrification in history. 
Infrastructure policy is a little bit 
like an aircraft carrier. The Presiding 
Officer, who just left the podium, re-
tired as a Navy Captain, and so did I. 
He and I both spent a lot of time in air-
planes, and he spent a fair amount of 
time in outer space as an astronaut. 
But we have both spent some time on 
aircraft carriers, and we know you 
can’t turn an aircraft carrier on a 
dime. With the Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act, as we say in the 
Navy, we are ‘‘coming hard about.’’ 
Coming hard about. The carrier is 
turning. We are finally recognizing cli-
mate change and addressing it. We are

recognizing some of the mistakes of in-
frastructure policy in the past and fix-
ing them. 
Before I call for us to invoke cloture, 
I am channeling today, of all people, 
Winston Churchill. I love Churchill. I 
know he is quoted by a lot of my col-
leagues as well. One of my favorite 
quotes from Winston Churchill is, ‘‘The 
further back we look, the further for-
ward we see.’’ Another one I especially 
like from Churchill is, ‘‘You can al-
ways count on America to do the right 
thing in the end after trying every-
thing else.’’ 
It would seem, as we have gone 
through this legislative process, that 
we have tried just about everything 
else. We had a lot of surprisingly good 
debate here on this floor. Senator CAP-
ITO, my colleague and partner in the 
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee, has done a great job. But we 
have seen a lot of amendments of-
fered—over 20—to this bill. I think 
most of them were bipartisan. A bunch 
of them have been adopted. 
The other thing I would just offer 
from Churchill is another one of my fa-
vorites: 
Democracy is the worst form of govern-
ment devised by the wit of man . . . 
Democracy is the worst form of govern-
ment devised by the wit of man . . . 
This is a hard way to go, and we have 
learned that again as we have gone 
through this process. As we prepare to 
maybe, hopefully, invoke cloture, I 
again want to say how much I have en-
joyed working with my ranking mem-
ber, Senator CAPITO—two West Vir-
ginians who found common ground on 
these issues and worked hard to lead 
our team and a lot of other committees 
of jurisdiction. Another one of them 
was led by another West Virginian, JOE 
MANCHIN. I want to thank all those 
committees for their good work and for 
the leadership we received from our 
leaders. 
With that having been said, let’s go 
ahead and vote, and I hope to vote to 
invoke cloture and take the critical 
next step. 
I yield the floor.

York, [Mr. SCHUMER] for the Senator 
from Arizona, [Ms. SINEMA] and the 
Senator from Ohio, [Mr. PORTMAN] to 
H.R. 3684, a bill to authorize funds for 
Federal-aid highways, highway safety 
programs, and transit programs, and 
for other purposes, shall be brought to 
a close?

The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this 
vote, the yeas are 67, the nays are 27. 
Three-fifths of the Senators duly cho-
sen and sworn having voted in the af-
firmative, the motion is agreed to. 
The motion was agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, ear-
lier today, I quoted Churchill actually 
a couple of times. One of my favorite 
Churchill quotes is, when asked when 
he was being thrown out of office at 
the end of World War II—he was asked 
by reporters outside of 10 Downing 
Street: Mr. Churchill, for you, is this 
the end? 
He said: It is not the end. This is not 
the beginning of the end. 
He said: This is the end of the begin-
ning. 
While we are grateful for everybody 
who voted for cloture, it is not the end, 
but it takes us a step closer to the end. 
I just want to thank everybody who 
came in, took the time to get here to 
vote. We are prepared to take the next 
step. It involves some additional nego-
tiations. A lot of folks have amend-
ments they want to offer. Some of 
those that are not germane I think will 
largely fall away. There are legitimate, 
germane amendments that still need to 
be negotiated and may require some 
unanimous consent votes. 
This is another step, important step. 
I am grateful that we could be this far. 
I note Senator CAPITO feels the same 
way. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2633 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
call up amendment No. 2633 to H.R. 
3684. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Delaware [Mr. CARPER] 
proposes an amendment numbered 2633. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To establish an effective date for 
the bill) 
On page 15, between lines 5 and 6, insert 
the following: 
SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE. 
Except as otherwise provided, this Act and 
the amendments made by this Act take ef-
fect on the date that is 1 day after the date 
of enactment of this Act. 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, now 
that cloture has been invoked on the 
substitute bill, we are one step closer 
to completing this product, which has 
been the subject of bipartisan negotia-
tion with the White House for quite 
some time. I know a lot of hard work 
has been put into this, and I want to 
thank all of our colleagues who have 
contributed to it. 
After much anticipation, we finally 
received the bill text earlier this week. 
Of course, a lot of it was what we ex-
pected 
to 
see: 
funding 
for 
roads, 
bridges, ports, waterways, airports, and 
broadband. 
Under normal circumstances, an in-
frastructure bill would go through a 
long and arduous committee process

before ever coming to the floor. Mem-
bers of the committees of jurisdiction 
would have an opportunity to debate 
and offer amendments and get votes on 
their proposals to try to improve the 
bill at the committee level. This pro-
vides a very important part of the abil-
ity of everybody to be able to partici-
pate in the process, one that is denied 
members of their committees of rel-
evant jurisdiction when a bill comes to 
the floor already negotiated. 
One of the challenges is when you 
have 20 people who agree on something 
and then they bring it to the floor, and, 
of course, then the 80 who have not 
been part of that discussion want to 
participate and want to try to improve 
the underlying bill. 
I hope that now that the cloture on 
the substitute has been invoked, there 
will be an opportunity for us to vote on 
some additional amendments. 
I have been working with colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to identify 
new pay-fors that could be adopted as 
amendments, and we have come up 
with some good ideas that I hope can 
receive votes now, even postcloture. 
But I want to talk specifically about 
an amendment that I have worked on 
with Senator PADILLA, the junior Sen-
ator from California, to fund infra-
structure 
projects 
in 
communities 
across our country without increasing 
the deficit. Our amendment simply 
gives States and local governments the 
flexibility to use unspent COVID relief 
funding on infrastructure projects. 
Right now, there are limitations that 
we put on that funding. Of course, at 
the time those limitations or guard-
rails were put on that funding, we 
didn’t know how long this pandemic 
would last or what the actual needs 
were of the various States and local ju-
risdictions. 
So qualifying expenses include things 
that are directly related to the pan-
demic, like COVID–19 testing sites, 
vaccine PSAs, and additional bed space 
for hospitals. But here is the rub: That 
funding cannot be used on expenses un-
related to the pandemic or items that 
were previously included in the budget. 
They must be new pandemic-related 
expenses. 
In theory, and at the time, that made 
a lot of sense. After all, this funding 
was meant to bolster the fight against 
COVID–19 in our communities. But not 
every community has the same need. 
In many places, the most urgent needs 
aren’t related to the pandemic because 
they have not been hit quite as hard as 
others, 
unfortunately, 
around 
the 
country. Some of their most urgent 
needs are what we are talking about 
here today: infrastructure—roads and 
bridges and the like. 
We all know that the pandemic has 
interrupted 
infrastructure 
improve-
ments across the country and forced of-
ficials to put many of these projects on 
the back burner. Maintenance, repairs, 
and construction projects have been 
put on hold, as you know, until there 
was enough funding to get things back 
on track. 
I have heard from my constituents in 
Texas—State and local leaders—who 
are frustrated by this lack of flexi-
bility with the Federal funding that 
they have already received or which 
they expect to receive. They simply 
like the option—not a mandate, but an 
option—to use this money when and 
where it is needed most. 
But as I say, right now, their hands 
are tied. Many States and localities 
have relief funds on hand but no nec-
essary qualifying expenses. They have 
to look at this big balance in their 
bank account knowing they can’t actu-
ally spend it on some of their most ur-
gent needs. That is especially the case 
in rural parts of the country. 
In places where COVID numbers are, 
thankfully, low, leaders don’t have the 
need or the opportunity to spend this 
money which we have already appro-
priated on the timeline set within that 
legislation. They simply don’t have a 
need for the full range of pandemic-re-
lated resources that might be nec-
essary in some parts of the country 
with higher case counts. 
So the amendment that Senator 
PADILLA and I have offered would sim-
ply give leaders in rural and urban 
areas alike, where appropriate, the op-
tion—the option—to spend the funding 
on necessary infrastructure projects. 
That can mean widening a highway, 
making safety improvements on a 
bridge, or expanding broadband access. 
Urban areas could even use these funds 
for 
public 
transit 
improvement 
projects. State and local leaders know 
the needs of their community better 
than any of us here, and they should 
have the flexibility to spend that 
money where it is needed most. 
But, Madam President, I think we 
have had a recent bit of evidence of 
how long it takes for Congress to act 
before the money that we appropriate 
actually gets to the intended bene-
ficiary. To me, nothing is more exem-
plary of that than the eviction morato-
rium. Congress appropriated $46 billion 
in rent relief, but if you look around 
the country, many of the intended 
beneficiaries of that rent relief have 
not yet seen that money, thus the 
movement toward extending the mora-
torium. 
I know just from my own experience 
in Texas, after Hurricane Harvey, 
where Congress appropriated billions of 
dollars in relief, it has taken, literally, 
years for the money that come from 
Washington, DC, to get to the intended 
beneficiary. 
One of the biggest benefits of the 
amendment that Senator PADILLA and 
I have offered is that this money is 
readily available and does not, again, 
as I said, add to the deficit or debt, but 
merely provides them flexibility, which 
means they will be able to put that 
money to use more quickly on infra-
structure projects. 
Again, this is not a mandate. This is 
an option. Any place that has new 
COVID expenses to cover can and 
should use the money they have for 
that purpose. There is no question 
about that. But we simply give leaders 
the option to spend relief funds on ur-
gent infrastructure projects that may 
otherwise go unfunded. 
Here is the other problem. I know 
that many of our State and local lead-
ers are sitting on these huge amounts 
of financial resources that we have ap-
propriated, and they are figuring out: 
Well, if we don’t spend it on something, 
then the Federal Government is going 
to claw it back or it may not just qual-
ify for the expenditures that are al-
ready authorized. 
So they will be under a lot of pres-
sure to spend it on things that may be 
simply operating expenses and may not 
provide the long-term economic benefit 
that an infrastructure project would. 
That is another benefit of giving 
them this flexibility. It is that it will 
incentivize them to spend the money 
on the types of things we would hope 
they would spend the money on if they 
don’t need it for COVID–19. 
Back in March, nearly three dozen 
organizations 
wrote 
to 
Secretary 
Yellen, the Treasury Secretary, urging 
her to make transportation infrastruc-
ture an eligible expense. They talked 
about the impact of COVID–19 on 
transportation revenue and noted that 
last year, 18 States and 24 localities an-
nounced delays or cancellations of 
transportation improvement projects, 
totaling more than $12 billion. 
They also noted that the pandemic 
impacted every State and community 
differently, something that should be 
self-evident, and asked for the flexi-
bility, which they said ‘‘will be critical 
to ensuring funds are used expedi-
tiously and with maximum impact.’’ 
President 
Biden’s 
own 
Transpor-
tation Secretary has also suggested as 
much. In his testimony before Con-
gress, Secretary Buttigieg said that 
the American Rescue Plan ‘‘has some 
flexibility in it’’ that he thinks could 
be used to support road budgets that 
have been impacted. 
States and cities shouldn’t be able to 
spend this money. They should be able 
to invest it and in the projects and re-
sources they need the most. This is 
just simply common sense that I think 
all of us can get behind. It ensures that 
money that has already gone out the 
door, which will not add to our deficit 
or debt, will be used to the maximum 
impact before the sunset brings that 
flexibility and that money, those re-
sources, to an end. 
And it puts decision making at the 
local level. Local officials understand 
better than people in Washington, DC, 
what they need the most, and this 
gives them the flexibility to put that 
money to the most efficient and most 
effective use. This amendment has 
earned the support of a broad range of 
organizations across the country, and I 
am 
proud 
to 
work 
with 
Senator 
PADILLA to craft an amendment that 
both sides can get behind. 
Today, I hope this will be one of the 
amendments to receive a vote on the

amendment process and commonsense 
bipartisan ideas like this one are the

I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
EDUCATION 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it 
was in 1957 that there was a world 
event that changed my life and the 
lives of many others. I was just a kid in 
high school at the time. In fact, I 
wasn’t quite in high school. But the 
Russians decided to launch a satellite 
called Sputnik, and that satellite, the 
size of a basketball, which emitted a 
tone as it flew through space, scared 
the world, all of us, to the point where 
the United States of America did some-
thing that was controversial but we 
felt was necessary. 
We decided that the Federal Govern-
ment of the United States would loan 
money to students like DURBIN to go to 
college because we were afraid of the 
Russians, and we knew that, if they 
had the scientific advantage of us, it 
could mean we would lose a war, which 
no one wants that to ever happen. So 
we created here in Washington some-
thing called the National Defense Edu-
cation Act. I am sure that was care-
fully chosen to remind people that 
what we were doing was defending the 
country by loaning money to people 
like DURBIN to go to college, and I took 
advantage of it. 
Those National Defense Education 
Act loans had terms that most of us 
from that era remember very well. You 
didn’t pay anything on your loan bal-
ance for the first year you were out of 
college, and then you had 10 years to 
pay it off at 3 percent interest. 
Of course, those of us who took out 
the loans for college—in my case, for 
law school as well—amassed this great 
debt and worried, when the day came 
for graduation, whether we would ever 
be able to pay it off. I remember saying 
to my wife: Loretta, they have just got 
all the National Defense Education Act 
loans. They put them all together, and 
I am afraid to tell you what has hap-
pened. We have a debt of $8,000 for col-
lege and law school. 
Students today don’t believe that 
number, but that was the number, and 
it scared us to death that we wouldn’t 
be able to pay it off in 10 years. Natu-
rally, we did, and many others did as 
well, and the National Defense Edu-
cation Act really became the pillar of 
the emergence of higher education in 
America. 
Of course, there were those who 
cheated the system, and stories were 
rampant. Whether they were all true, I 
am not sure. There was the story of the 
doctor who graduated from medical 
school and, before he went into his lu-
crative practice, filed for bankruptcy 
and discharged all his Federal loans, 
Federal student loans. I don’t know if 
that ever happened, but it certainly 
was part of the urban legend around 
the National Defense Education Act. 
So, over the years, there were efforts 
made to change the National Defense 
Education Act to avoid abuse, and one 
of the things that was decided was that 
that loan to go to school would not be 
dischargeable in bankruptcy. 
You have to ask the basic question of 
how many debts are not dischargeable 
in bankruptcy. There are only a few: 
alimony, child support, criminal fines, 
taxes, and maybe one other. But I 
think a student loan is the only one of 
that bunch that is a consumer loan 
that you can’t discharge in bank-
ruptcy. 
Over the years, the terms of the 
loans and the number of years that you 
were held back from filing bankruptcy 
changed. Ultimately, the decision was 
made that you could effectively never 
discharge student loans in bankruptcy. 
We held a hearing on student loan 
debt in the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee this week, and I am sorry Sen-
ator CORNYN has left the floor, but he 
and I have introduced a bill which has 
a good chance, I think. 
We know that student loans are the 
fastest growing category of household 
debt in America—45 million student 
borrowers in our country. In a little 
under a decade, student loan debt has 
ballooned from $1 trillion to $1.7 tril-
lion. The average student borrower 
now carries $30,000 in debt, and many, 
especially those who are swindled by 
the for-profit colleges, owe well over 
$100,000. 
Americans of all ages are plagued by 
the debt. We have heard cases of grand-
mothers who have said to their grand-
daughters, ‘‘Well, of course, I will 
cosign your student loan,’’ to learn 
that when the student, the grand-
daughter, defaulted, Grandma was re-
sponsible for it. For some, it is holding 
them back from buying a first home, 
starting a family, a business. For oth-
ers, it means delaying retirement be-
cause of this debt. 
This is not an individual misfortune. 
The student debt crisis is a threat to 
our economy. Federal Reserve Chair-
man Jerome Powell has warned that 
student loan debt may be a drag on our 
economy 
by 
preventing 
Americans 
from basic, fundamental consumer pur-
chases of cars, savings accounts for re-
tirement—otherwise, 
the 
economic 
growth of our country. 
So we had a hearing in the Judiciary 
Committee, and we examined how dif-
ficult it is for student borrowers to get 
financial relief. These, as I said, are 
one of the very few categories of debt 
you cannot discharge in bankruptcy. 
You see, if you buy a home or a car and 
you fall on really hard times, you can 
declare bankruptcy and have all those 
debts discharged. If you like to gamble 
and you are not very good at it and you 
end up running up great debt on your 
credit card and you file for bankruptcy, 
your gambling debts through your 
credit cards can be discharged. You can 
even buy a yacht and have that debt 
discharged if you haven’t paid it off. 
But if you are a student borrower who, 
despite your best efforts, falls on hard 
times—lured into debt, perhaps, by at-
tending a worthless for-profit college— 
a fresh start is not in the cards for you. 
We had Diane Barta testify before 
the committee. She is from Richmond 
Hill, GA, 50 years old, a mother of two. 
She has over $120,000 in student loan 
debt, much of it taken out for a worth-
less degree she received from for-profit 
school Ashford University. I mentioned 
that to Senator GRASSLEY during the 
hearing because Ashford University is 
a curious story. 
A small Catholic college in Iowa was 
about to go out of business, and the 
nuns were persuaded that there was a 
company that wanted to buy it. So 
they sold the campus to this company 
called Ashford University. Ashford had 
no intention of reopening the campus. 
What they basically did was start an 
online operation, claiming the accredi-
tation and the worthiness and the 
credibility of the previous college. 
Well, we looked into it. In fact, it 
was Tom Harkin of Iowa, over 10 years 
ago, who investigated it and found out 
that Ashford was a fraud. It was just 
generating huge profits for their CEO 
and a few others, not providing any-
thing nearly resembling higher edu-
cation. 
Ms. Barta was a good person who 
worked hard. She had two degrees— 
from a community college and then 
from another college—before she went 
for a master’s degree at Ashford Uni-
versity. That was her downfall. She 
talked about how she had to file for 
bankruptcy in 2012 after her husband 
lost his job as a commercial plumber. 
She managed to get relief for most of 
her debts but certainly could not get 
discharged from her student loans that 
she had taken out at Ashford Univer-
sity, this notorious for-profit school. 
Other student borrowers had their 
own stories. We have all heard them. 
Angela, from Florida, wrote: 
I’m a single parent and was on a single in-
come living paycheck to paycheck. I’ve had 
the stress of these student loans haunting 
me for well over a decade now. . . . I am still 
being haunted. 
Lisa, in Nevada, wrote that she had 
given up her passion, teaching—I re-
peat: teaching—because she needed to 
find a higher income job to pay off her 
student loans. 
She wrote: 
It is absolutely disheartening that when 
you try to better yourself in this country 
you’re punished and not rewarded. 
One more story. 
Ann, from Washington State, de-
clared bankruptcy in 2000 because her 
student loan payments were so high 
she couldn’t afford to pay her bills. 
She wrote: 
I never go on vacations. I never married or 
had children for fear of burdening [them] 
with [my] debt. . . . I’m facing retirement 
with [that] threat [still looming over] my fu-
ture. . . . Social Security checks will be gar-
nished for my student loan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6000 
August 7, 2021 
This is clearly a crisis. Fortunately, 
both Republican and Democratic mem-
bers of the Judiciary Committee agree 
that we need to do something. Congress 
has a responsibility to solve this prob-
lem. Wouldn’t it be worth a headline 
somewhere, on some website, that we 
actually solved a problem like this? 
Before 1976, student loans were treat-
ed like any other type of loan in bank-
ruptcy. If you were facing financial 
ruin, you could get relief. Congress got 
the idea that student borrowers were 
running to bankruptcy court right 
after they had taken off their gowns 
and mortarboards and trying to wiggle 
out of their financial obligations. That 
is more anecdote than fact, but it was 
prevalent. Still, Congress began pass-
ing laws that made it harder to dis-
charge student loans. 
Since 1998, student borrowers could 
only discharge Federal student loans 
by proving they suffered from some-
thing called undue hardship. Well, you 
would think the cases I just read to 
you would be undue hardship, wouldn’t 
you, people so deeply in debt that they 
can’t get out of it and are forced to 
make life choices that are terrible? 
Here is the issue: It is nearly impos-
sible to prove undue hardship and dis-
charge your student debt. That is your 
only escape now. In fact, in 2017, the 
Wall Street Journal found only four 
cases—four cases—in the entire coun-
try of bankruptcy judges discharging 
student debt for undue hardship. 
For years, I have asked the Depart-
ment of Education, the collection 
Agency, to change the way they chal-
lenge these undue hardship cases. I am 
still pushing on them, but Congress 
needs to do its part. 
Another witness who joined us on 
Tuesday was my State attorney gen-
eral, Kwame Raoul. He has been an ad-
vocate for student borrowers for a long 
time. He talked about these students 
being deceived and defrauded by these 
schools, particularly the for-profit col-
leges and universities. 
Well, we have decided to do some-
thing about it. We have introduced a 
bill called the FRESH START Through 
Bankruptcy Act. It will allow strug-
gling borrowers to seek a bankruptcy 
discharge for their Federal student 
loans after a waiting period of 10 years. 
That is a long time. If you can’t pay off 
that loan in 10 years and you believe 
there is no other recourse, you could 
file for bankruptcy and have it dis-
charged. 
Our bill also includes another provi-
sion. I want to thank JACK REED of 
Rhode Island, our colleague here. He 
introduced the original bill with this 
concept. It includes important provi-
sions to hold accountable educational 
institutions, particularly these noto-
rious for-profit colleges with consist-
ently high default rates and low repay-
ment rates. 
There are two numbers you need to 
remember—and that is it—to under-
stand for-profit colleges and univer-
sities: Eight. What percentage of Amer-
ican high school graduates go to for- 
profit colleges and universities? Eight 
percent. 
Next question: What percentage of 
student loan defaults in the United 
States are by students from for-profit 
colleges and universities? Thirty. 
Eight percent of high school grads 
and thirty percent of student loan de-
faults. Why? Because these notorious, 
awful schools drag these young people 
into debt they can never get out from 
under. If they so-call finish and grad-
uate from these schools, they find that 
they can’t get the jobs that were prom-
ised. Their lives are virtually ruined. 
So we are basically saying it is time 
that these schools be held accountable. 
At this point, the FRESH START 
bankruptcy will provide a meaningful 
timeline to student borrowers who 
have no other options. It is a break-
through. 
This is the first bipartisan bill the 
Senate has had, in my memory, to re-
store student borrowers’ ability to dis-
charge their loans in bankruptcy. 
I want to thank Senator CORNYN, Re-
publican of Texas. We kind of jokingly 
say, you know, it is one of those situa-
tions where you are on stage, announc-
ing your bill, and you turn to one an-
other and say: Have we both read this 
bill? Well, we have, and we understand 
it. 
We are also going to consider an ele-
ment that was raised during the hear-
ing by one of our expert witnesses of 
defining what ‘‘undue hardship’’ is. 
Right now, it appears the courts 
couldn’t recognize it in any form. 
There certainly are cases. 
I talked about a quadriplegic vet-
eran—disabled, unable to work—who 
was lured into one of these for-profit 
school scams and ends up in debt. 
Shouldn’t they be able to discharge 
that student loan? There is no question 
they will be able to find some great- 
paying job in the future. They strug-
gled to basically face up to their ill-
nesses, and we hope that they have the 
very best future, but even then, it is 
tough to get out from under the debt. 
I hope this is a first of many steps 
that we will take in the committee and 
other places, on a bipartisan basis, to 
deal with this challenge. 
One other point. One way for stu-
dents to avoid becoming buried in stu-
dent loan debt in the first place is to be 
very careful, particularly of for-profit 
colleges and universities, and secondly, 
take advantage of the affordable alter-
native community colleges. Commu-
nity colleges are an underused super-
power of our economy. They help stu-
dents gain the knowledge and skills 
they need to thrive, and they prepare 
workers to compete in the 21st cen-
tury. 
I totally support President Biden’s 
plan to build back better and provide 
every high school graduate to be able 
to continue their studies through com-
munity college, without debt. The 
same goes for displaced workers who 
want to learn new skills to get a better 
job to support their futures. Americans 
will be able to obtain 2-year degrees or 
specialized certificates without taking 
on mountains of debt. 
In the greatest country in the world, 
a college education shouldn’t be a lux-
ury; it should be guaranteed to every-
one. That is the only way we can 
launch a new dream of American pros-
perity and truly build back better after 
this pandemic. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KAINE). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I want 
to take a moment to thank all my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle, in 
this great deliberative body, for show-
ing the United States and the entire 
world that the United States Senate is 
not broken. Actually, we are doing 
fine. We can work together and do 
much better. We can also come to-
gether and do big things, and we did 
with this investment in American in-
frastructure. 
America has not seen this type of in-
frastructure investment in the last 30 
years—talked 
about 
it 
a 
lot 
and 
haven’t seen anything. The polls have 
shown that the American people are 
overwhelmingly supportive of this in-
frastructure deal. Americans of both 
political parties know it is long past 
time to make this investment. And 
once the roads are repaired so the chil-
dren are safe on the buses, they want 
better internet service so they can con-
nect and compete in the 21st century. 
It is just unbelievable what we can 
do. This is about clean water and up-
graded sewer systems. You would think 
in the 21st century this all would be a 
void anywhere in America, but it is—it 
really is. 
This is the largest long-term jobs bill 
in decades. It will create good-paying, 
long-term jobs over the next 8 to 10 
years. So if you want to basically make 
sure we don’t hit the highs and the 
lows as far as the job opportunities, job 
markets, and the economy, this bill 
does that. 
It is the largest investment in clean 
drinking water and wastewater infra-
structure in the history of our coun-
try—in the history of our country. It is 
the largest dedicated bridge invest-
ment since the construction of the 
Interstate Highway System. 
It is the largest investment in energy 
transition in history, and puts our 
money where our mouth is on tech-
nologies that are critical for the fu-
ture. And it is the largest Federal in-
vestment in passenger rail since the 
creation of Amtrak. 
And our bipartisan infrastructure 
package does not raise taxes on every-
day Americans. It does not. A large

S6001 
August 7, 2021 
piece of this bipartisan infrastructure 
bill came out of the Energy and Nat-
ural Resources Committee, which I am 
privileged and honored to chair. We re-
ported the Energy Infrastructure Act 
out of our committee with a bipartisan 
vote after—after—holding a legislative 
hearing and a robust amendment proc-
ess. That is called regular order. It is 
something we have heard about for 
many years—we just haven’t seen it for 
a long time—and it is working. 
The Energy Infrastructure Act will 
create 
good-paying 
jobs 
and 
dem-
onstrate the energy technologies need-
ed to reduce emissions while maintain-
ing affordable, reliable, and dependable 
energy and our Nation’s position as a 
global energy leader. 
I have said all along that the United 
States of America is now energy inde-
pendent. We must fight to maintain 
that position. We should not be held 
captive by any foreign entity or any 
foreign country where we are depend-
ing on any type of supplies that the 
American people need—any type of 
supplies—and energy is one of our 
greatest, and we can do it cleaner and 
better than ever. I have always said 
you cannot eliminate your way to a 
cleaner environment. You can innovate 
your way to a cleaner environment, 
and we have proven that, and we can do 
an awful lot more too. 
It also builds off the great work al-
ready done in my home State of West 
Virginia and your State of Virginia, 
Mr. President, to demonstrate ad-
vanced geothermal technology and es-
tablish a reliable, U.S.-based, rare- 
Earth-element supply chain. 
I have had consideration and I have 
had some pause on us moving so rap-
idly into electric vehicles. My reason 
for my pause has been this: We do not 
produce the rare-Earth minerals—the 
rare-Earth minerals that are needed to 
build these batteries. And we have to 
be very, very careful that we don’t put 
our transportation system—our trans-
portation mode in America in the 
hands of foreign supply chains. We 
could be held very, very captive on 
those. 
I remember in the 1970s, when the oil 
embargo from the oil cartel—the oil 
embargo basically shut our businesses 
down, and then we had rapid inflation 
coming after that. It was just horrible. 
Importantly, the legislation also re-
authorizes abandoned mine lands and 
reclamation fees. In southwest Virginia 
and all of West Virginia, we have a tre-
mendous amount of mines that this 
country needed to be the superpower of 
the world. 
Now it is far beyond time for us to 
clean that up, and this is something we 
can do, and this bill does that. It is set 
to expire, as far as our AML reclama-
tion fees in September. For an addi-
tional 13 years, we have extended that, 
while investing $11.3 billion into re-
claiming these abandoned coal mine 
lands, which an awful lot of beach area 
and water and things were harmed for 
a long time and needs to be fixed. 
It also funds the demonstration of 
clean energy on the abandoned mine 
lands and authorizes grants for manu-
facturers to locate in coal commu-
nities. These coal communities around 
the country bear the scars of the work 
that powered our Nation to greatness, 
and this investment will clean up those 
areas and provide new economic oppor-
tunities. 
The bill also shores up the reliability 
of our electric grid systems. Our grid 
has basically been around for a long 
time, and with all the new technologies 
coming on and all of the renewable 
power, that is not always produced in 
the area where we have the grid sys-
tem, and it is time for us to expand and 
make sure our grid system is able to 
deliver the energy our country needs. 
The bipartisan Energy Infrastructure 
Act authorizes $110 billion, much of 
which is also funded and is a vital com-
ponent of the whole infrastructure 
package. So we are not just talking 
about it. We are putting a lot of money 
into upgrading the grid system and the 
reliability of it. 
This bill will truly do much good 
across the United States. Let me just 
give you the historic investment in the 
needs of our Nation: $110 billion for the 
roads and the bridges; $65 billion for 
broadband access; $66 billion for rail-
roads; $25 billion for airports; $55 bil-
lion for drinking water and wastewater 
systems. 
I don’t know what infrastructure is if 
you don’t call that infrastructure. This 
is as good as it gets. It is something 
that we all have talked about for 
many, many years. 
My State of West Virginia benefits 
from this bipartisan infrastructure bill. 
It will help expand broadband access 
across West Virginia with a minimum 
allocation of $100 million to help pro-
vide broadband coverage across the 
State, including providing access to at 
least 258,000 West Virginians who cur-
rently lack it because of our terrain. 
I think the Presiding Officer has been 
there many, many times, and you un-
derstand what we are dealing with. It 
is really challenging, but if we take 
just a commonsense approach—and I 
have always said this: If during Frank-
lin Delano Roosevelt, when he took 
over after the Great Depression, if he 
could electrify America—rural elec-
trification—if he could do that in the 
thirties, surely and goodness, we can 
basically make sure that every house-
hold has fast, high-speed internet serv-
ice. We can make that happen, and we 
are going to use the same blueprint 
that was used many, many years ago, 
almost 100 years ago. 
We believe that number is much 
higher than the 258,000. But, here 
again, I am urging the FCC to fix their 
coverage in the maps. The maps are 
not accurate. They haven’t been accu-
rate for years. I will never forget when 
I had one of the chairmen of the FCC in 
my State one time, and we were talk-
ing, and I said: Why don’t you meet me 
at a certain place in my State? I said: 
We will have a meeting. I want to talk 
to you. 
He was kind. He drove over there 
with his staff. I said: Why don’t you 
call back to your office and ask if they 
have any messages for you. I said: The 
map here shows—your map shows— 
that you are covered. And I said: You 
can use any phone you want, any serv-
ice you might have. 
And he said: My goodness, I didn’t 
know. 
I said: Sir, this is exactly what we 
are dealing with. The maps are not ac-
curate, and West Virginians are getting 
left behind. 
There are 543,000, or 31 percent, of the 
people in West Virginia who will be eli-
gible for the affordability connectivity 
benefit, which will help low-income 
families. You can have internet serv-
ice, but if it is so costly that people 
can’t afford it, then you have a prob-
lem. This goes along with the same 
thing as LIHEAP, which helps people 
with their utilities who, basically, are 
working hard and trying to make it 
but having a hard time. This makes 
sure that everyone can connect and ba-
sically benefit from this opportunity. 
West Virginia also has some of the 
worst roads in the Nation. This bipar-
tisan bill will repair and rebuild our 
roads and bridges. In West Virginia, 
there are 1,545 bridges—1,545—and over 
3,200 miles of highway in poor condi-
tion. Since 2011, commute times have 
increased by 61⁄2 percent and, on aver-
age, each driver pays $726 per year in 
additional costs due to repairs by driv-
ing on roads that have needed repair. 
That is simply unacceptable, and it 
truly, truly shows the deferred mainte-
nance that we have let go for far too 
long. Based on formula alone, West 
Virginia will receive $3 billion for Fed-
eral-Aid Highway programs and $506 
million for bridge replacement and re-
pairs. We have the greatest need of 
bridge replacement. 
The reason why is that, in the 1930s, 
the 
constitution 
of 
West 
Virginia 
changed during the Great Depression, 
and basically everything was put on 
the State. Before that, local counties 
and communities were all responsible 
to a certain extent, but when the De-
pression hit, the Constitution was 
changed in 1932, at the height of the 
Depression, and everything was: This is 
the State’s responsibility; we can’t pay 
no more. 
So the State has a tremendous obli-
gation here, and we want to make sure 
we help them. 
West Virginia can also compete for 
the $12.5 billion Bridge Investment Pro-
gram 
for 
economically 
significant 
bridges and nearly $16 billion of na-
tional funding in the bill dedicated for 
major projects that will deliver sub-
stantial economic benefits to commu-
nities. 
And we have to address public trans-
portation in the Mountain State. West 
Virginians, who take public transpor-
tation, spend an extra 77 percent of 
their time commuting—commuting—

and non-White households are five 
times more likely to commute via pub-
lic transportation. That is a fact, and 
we have to address these facts and fix 
them. 
And 32 percent of the trains and 
other transit vehicles in the State are 
past their useful life. A third are past 
their useful life. Based on formula 
funding, West Virginia would expect to 
receive $196 million over 5 years to im-
prove public transportation, which is 
desperately, desperately needed. 
These investments are vital to bring-
ing good-paying jobs to our State of 
West Virginia and the Presiding Offi-
cer’s State of Virginia and all of our 
States in this great country of ours, 
and spurring economic development 
like we have never seen before. This is 
solid economic development, not just 
sending checks, not people just receiv-
ing checks but people receiving an op-
portunity of the dignity of work and 
the ability to be able to do what needs 
to be done in order for them to survive 
and sustain a quality of life. 
I am incredibly proud of our bipar-
tisan group of Senators who have 
worked together day and night to ham-
mer out a compromise that will ad-
dress our infrastructure needs without 
going overboard. And I will remind ev-
eryone that not one Senator got every-
thing they wanted, but we all got what 
we needed. This is how compromise 
works. This is what this body was made 
for. This is why the Senate is called 
the most deliberative body. 
It is hard, when you want to basi-
cally take every opportunity to work 
with every single Senator here, to 
make sure you can help them with the 
problems and needs they have in their 
own States, and that is what we have 
done. 
I have always said: The best politics 
is good government. 
Everybody worries about: Oh, I am 
not sure if that is good for my politics. 
Let me tell you, if you do something 
good for all, it is good for you. It will 
be the best politics you have ever done. 
If we do something good, we all take 
credit for it. 
I have seen people take credit for 
things they voted against because it 
was good. It worked well. It didn’t 
bother me at all. I am glad. Maybe 
they won’t fight us as hard the next 
time. Maybe they might join us. Who 
knows? 
I look forward to passing this impor-
tant legislation with strong bipartisan 
support. I just think this is a moment 
for our country. This is extremely im-
portant for our country to show that 
we can still work together and to show 
that we are united when it comes to 
the needs. 
I have always said: There are a few 
things in this country that basically 
unite us. One has always been our mili-
tary. We want to support our military, 
our law enforcement officers, our fire-
men, and all the people who run into 
harm’s way when everyone else is run-
ning away from harm’s way. Those peo-
ple are special—very special—I have al-
ways said. We all seem to rise always 
for that. 
But now we have one other. We have 
infrastructure, which unites us. I have 
never seen a road in my State, in the 
Presiding Officer’s State, or anywhere 
in the country that had a bad road or 
a bad pothole that busted my tire that 
had a Democrat or Republican name on 
it. It will get the Republican, as well as 
it will get me and the Presiding Offi-
cer. 
So that is why this brings us to-
gether. We all have these needs. As 
Governors, we had the same needs. We 
used to talk across the board—whether 
it be education, whether it be high-
ways, whether it be different things 
that we needed in our State that we all 
had the same concerns and problems 
with. We never worried about whether 
it was a Republican or Democrat being 
the Governor. The Presiding Officer 
had the same problems we all had, and 
we shared successes and the challenges 
and how to overcome those challenges. 
This is who we are as Americans. 
And how we become so divided, I 
don’t know. It worries me, and the rea-
son I say this is that this is probably 
the most important bill that we have 
worked on in many, many years be-
cause it is the most difficult, chal-
lenging times of our lives. Our country 
has never been more divided than it is 
today, and we need something to bring 
us together. 
I am so thankful that President 
Biden has taken this piece of legisla-
tion as his own and gone around the 
country on how important this piece of 
legislation is for not just his adminis-
tration but for the entire country. He 
has been able to identify that. Demo-
crats and Republicans—we are going to 
have 20 Republicans today get on the 
bill. Everyone was afraid that someone 
is going to get mad and leave. We kept 
gaining. And as they see the support 
back home, it will continue to create 
more momentum. That is what we 
need. This is extremely as important as 
anything we do from this day forward 
to pass a bipartisan bill—show the peo-
ple that basically, yes, we are all 
Americans first, and we are going to 
take care of the deferred maintenance 
we let go for far too long because of 
politics. We have set politics aside to 
take care of America. 
So I encourage all of my friends, 
please, look and see what this bill does 
for America. Look and see what this 
bill does for your State. You will be 
surprised. And I think we have tried to 
help everybody that we could, and we 
will continue to work together. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Mr. President, I sup-
port hard infrastructure. It is in my 
DNA. As a kid, I grew up shoveling as-
phalt. My father and my grandfather 
were in the road construction business. 
I served as the economic develop-
ment commissioner in my home State 
of Tennessee. I understand firsthand 
the importance of quality infrastruc-
ture. It was essential to attracting 
good jobs to my State. So I am in com-
plete agreement that shoring up our 
hard infrastructure is a worthy cause. 
This bill does some of that, and that 
is good. But there are both good ways 
and bad ways to achieve noble ends. 
And the question is, What is the best 
way to achieve this goal? And my frus-
tration is with the methods and with 
the vehicle that is being used here. 
The first problem is that the bill 
sponsors repeatedly said it would be 
paid for. In fact, it is not. And it is 
more than a little bit off. It is over a 
quarter of a trillion dollars short. That 
is almost seven times the budget of my 
home State of Tennessee. 
We waited weeks for the text of this 
legislation. And before the text even 
existed, the Democrat leader forced the 
Senate to vote on proceeding to it. 
There is absolutely no reason for rush-
ing this process and attempting to 
limit scrutiny of this bill other than 
the Democrats’ completely artificial, 
self-imposed, and politically driven 
timeline. There will be more on that 
later. 
The text, all 2,700-plus pages of it, 
was finally made available to us 6 days 
ago. The Senate has been able to con-
sider that this week, but the Senate 
continued to wait all week for the Con-
gressional Budget Office’s analysis of 
what it would cost. 
The CBO is the entity that Congress 
has 
agreed 
is 
responsible 
for 
scorekeeping on what legislation will 
cost the American people. 
Let’s keep in mind that meeting the 
definition of ‘‘paid for’’ in the CBO’s 
eyes doesn’t always make sense to the 
average American. For instance, CBO 
allows spending now to be offset by 
projected savings that won’t happen for 
10 years. CBO can allow savings that 
are already occurring naturally to 
count, effectively, as new savings for 
purposes of scoring a bill. 
The point is, this kind of scoring is 
designed to make it easier for a bill to 
be scored as paid for, at least on paper. 
As an example, the University of 
Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget 
Model estimates that this legislation 
would actually add $351 billion in def-
icit spending, an even higher total than 
the CBO estimate. 
The 
point 
is, 
even 
using 
these 
scorekeeping advantages, the CBO has 
made it clear this bill isn’t paid for. 
I understand why the Democratic 
leadership kept the CBO score under 
wraps until Thursday. It showed that 
the bill fell far short of ambitions. The 
CBO said that it misses the mark of 
being paid for by a cool quarter of a 
trillion dollars.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6003 
August 7, 2021 
As an aside, I found it incredible that 
despite—or perhaps because of—getting 
this 
news 
on 
Thursday 
afternoon, 
Democrats tried to accelerate the pas-
sage of this bill later that same day. 
Instead of going through the normal 
multiday process for debating and en-
acting a bill, they tried to rush it 
through in the middle of the night. I 
objected to accelerating this process on 
Thursday because the Senate must 
carefully consider what it is doing. 
Now, the proponents of this bill 
claim that the CBO’s analysis is wrong. 
No matter how much explaining they 
do, the Senate agreed on the umpire 
before the game started. 
To this end, if this bill is paid for, 
why will we have to waive Budget Act 
requirements later on in this process? 
The Senate is going to have to pass 
this bill by waiving the Budget Act or 
the pay-go requirements. That is not 
‘‘paid for.’’ 
Most of us probably won’t be around 
when the bill comes due for this never- 
ending deficit spending here in Wash-
ington, but, sadly, our children and our 
grandchildren will be. The politicians 
in Washington spend now to buy votes 
but, conveniently, won’t be around to 
deal with the consequences. 
We can do hard infrastructure— 
again, that is a worthy goal—but we 
can do it without shoveling more debt 
onto the backs of our children and our 
grandchildren. Indeed, if we just lim-
ited this bill to hard infrastructure, it 
would be paid for. As I said, there are 
good and bad ways to achieve noble 
ends. 
The second reason that I am opposed 
to this legislation is because of its Big 
Government, top-down approach. It in-
cludes many half-baked components 
that deserve far more scrutiny. 
Rather than compete against China 
using our unparalleled innovation, our 
ingenuity, our technology, we are sub-
stituting massive government control 
to dictate, to fund, and to decide win-
ners and losers. That is not the Amer-
ican way. 
We are using the cryptocurrency 
market as a pay-for. 
Have we fully vetted how this new 
regulation and taxation will affect this 
rapidly developing industry? 
Will we wind up ceding this industry 
to others because of this regulation? 
What is the point of even having 
committees in the Senate with exper-
tise in certain matters if the most sig-
nificant legislation that passes this 
body doesn’t even go through? 
The whole point of committees is to 
use them—use these committees to 
carefully scrutinize and refine impor-
tant legislation, use committees to 
prevent unintended consequences that 
result from rushed legislation. Yet this 
is a 2,700-page bill that is going 
through no committees. Once again, we 
have to pass it to find out what is in it 
and then learn what kind of unintended 
consequences we can expect. 
The third reason I am frustrated with 
this legislation is because it is tied to 
what I believe is the Democrats’ real 
ambition, which is their multitrillion- 
dollar march to socialism that they 
will unveil right after this infrastruc-
ture legislation is passed. Democrats 
have admitted this. This is their plan. 
The far-left wing of the Democratic 
Party, which is effectively calling the 
shots these days, is demanding that 
Democrats here in Congress spend tril-
lions of dollars to reshape American so-
ciety, to make American citizens more 
dependent on their government. Their 
aim seems to be to turn the United 
States into a sclerotic, government- 
controlled state, just like Western Eu-
rope. 
The upcoming legislation that we are 
talking about now is the third leg of 
the stool of the Democrats’ overall 
plan. The first leg is to pack the Su-
preme Court so the Constitution no 
longer gets in the way of their plan. 
The second is to Federalize and take 
over voting laws and procedures, ensur-
ing Democrats will never lose another 
election, propelling themselves into 
perpetual power over both the legisla-
tive branch and the executive branch. 
And, third, they want to remake the 
U.S. economy and America’s relation-
ship with government into one where 
Americans begin to look to govern-
ment for everything, from Green New 
Deal programs to daycare. In this 
world, American citizens will be less 
free, less prosperous but more captive 
and hooked on government programs. 
That means they will be more depend-
ent on Democrats and the institutions 
that they control. 
So far, Democrats have been unable 
to build legs one and two of the stool, 
but they are actively trying. President 
Biden has a court-packing commission 
ongoing, and the Democratic leader is, 
today, working on scheduling more 
votes on the election takeover. They 
are desperate to appease leftwing ex-
tremists that have all of the energy in 
their party because they need these ex-
tremists’ support to win elections. 
Yet they have stalled out on their 
first two goals, so they have come up 
with a scheme to build the third leg of 
their stool. They previewed phase 1 of 
the scheme in March, when they spent 
$1.9 trillion in the name of COVID re-
lief. Of course, 90 percent of it had 
nothing to do with COVID. It was real-
ly just a payoff to their most loyal po-
litical supporters. 
Sadly, it is now causing the highest 
inflation that we have seen in decades. 
This inflation is a daily tax on every 
American who has to buy goods and 
services here in America. 
But phase 2 of the scheme is even 
more devious. Step 1: Change the con-
versation to trillions with a ‘‘t.’’ Make 
billions sound small. Condition the 
Congress, condition the media, condi-
tion the American public to these big 
numbers. 
Remember, a trillion dollars is an as-
tronomical number, and our children 
are going to have to pay for it. 
Step 2: Tell the United States that 
America 
needs 
infrastructure; 
but 
then, Step 3, redefine the term ‘‘infra-
structure’’ to include government-de-
pendency programs. Really muddy it 
up. 
Step 4: When more reasonable Demo-
crats in the Senate balk at some of 
these more expensive or egregious 
items, promise them a two-track proc-
ess—one for hard infrastructure and 
one for social programs. 
Step 5: Negotiate as much of your so-
cialist wish list into the infrastructure 
track as you can. They got some of it 
into this bill, but not all of it. They 
will just put the rest of it into the wish 
list and put that wish list into the gov-
ernment-dependency bill that is yet to 
come. 
Step 6: Pass the infrastructure bill 
through the Senate as quickly as pos-
sible. Drop a nearly 3,000-page bill and 
demand that it be passed immediately 
before we can even understand or scru-
tinize what is in it. The Trojan horse, 
my friends, is through the gate. 
Step 7: Hold that infrastructure bill 
hostage in the House of Representa-
tives until everything you couldn’t get 
into the infrastructure bill—particu-
larly meaning the trillions of dollars in 
government-dependency programs—are 
passed through the Senate. Therefore, 
NANCY PELOSI has promised that this 
bill will never become law until it is 
joined at the hip with the multitril-
lion-dollar socialist bill. 
More on that in a minute. 
Step 8: Say that the President won’t 
sign the infrastructure bill into law if 
it is not accompanied by trillions of 
dollars in government-dependency pro-
grams. President Biden already did this 
before he clumsily walked it back, but 
we saw and we heard what he was 
thinking. 
Step 9: To get the government-de-
pendency programs part passed, cir-
cumvent the filibuster in the Senate by 
abusing an arcane loophole called rec-
onciliation. 
Reconciliation 
was 
in-
tended to save taxpayer dollars and to 
assure passage of an annual budget for 
the Federal Government. But now they 
are using this process—they are abus-
ing this procedure to pass trillions of 
dollars of government-dependency pro-
grams with only 50 Democrat votes. 
Step 10: Give reasonable Democrats 
political cover to support the par-
liamentary trick and the government- 
dependency 
spending 
by 
saying 
it 
unlocks the ability for their hard- 
fought infrastructure bill that passed 
the Senate—and, by the way, is now 
being held hostage in the House—to fi-
nally get through the House and to the 
President’s desk. 
Wait a minute. What just happened? 
Abracadabra. The American people are 
so confused by the Democrats’ sleight 
of hand that they don’t even notice 
that their wallet has been stolen and 
that their country has been fundamen-
tally changed. 
My question is simple: If these poli-
cies and this spending is so good, why 
does getting it done take a parliamen-
tary house of mirrors?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6004 
August 7, 2021 
There can’t be a bipartisan deal on 
infrastructure if its enactment into 
law requires later tacking on all of the 
socialist wish list items that got ex-
cluded from the deal. 
Democrats have telegraphed these 
plans. You just have to pay attention. 
The President of the United States, 
right after announcing the infrastruc-
ture deal, said it would be held hostage 
on his desk without the trillions of dol-
lars of government-dependency spend-
ing alongside it. 
President 
Biden 
specifically 
said 
this: 
I expect that in the coming months this 
summer, before the fiscal year is over, that 
we will have voted on this bill—the infra-
structure bill—as well as voted on the budget 
resolution. But if only one comes to me . . . 
this is the only thing that comes to me, I’m 
not signing it. It’s in tandem. 
Later, in response to a question, 
President Biden revealed: ‘‘Look, the 
bipartisan bill, from the very begin-
ning, was understood there was going 
to have to be the second part of it,’’ he 
said. ‘‘I’m not just signing the bipar-
tisan bill and forgetting about the 
rest.’’ 
Now, he has later tried to muddy up 
the waters on this because he said too 
much. But if you read his cleanup 
statement carefully, he never took 
back his vow. He never said he would 
sign the bipartisan bill without having 
alongside it the partisan multitrillion- 
dollar bill. 
The Speaker of the House has said 
the same thing repeatedly. On June 24, 
she said: There ain’t going to be a bi-
partisan bill without a reconciliation 
bill. 
She added again: 
Let me be really clear on this: We will not 
take up a bill in the House until the Senate 
passes the bipartisan bill and a reconcili-
ation bill. 
A month later, on July 22, Speaker 
PELOSI again said: 
We will not take up the infrastructure bill 
until the Senate passes the reconciliation 
measure. 
It only takes one Democrat to end 
this insanity, to stand up and say he or 
she won’t participate in this scheme. 
That would change the entire tenor of 
this debate and this process. 
So while I believe in hard infrastruc-
ture, I cannot participate in doing it 
this way: first, by including in this bill 
a bunch of things that aren’t hard in-
frastructure, and the result of that is 
throwing a quarter of a trillion dollars 
more debt at our children and our 
grandchildren; and, secondly, and most 
importantly for the future of this coun-
try, enabling this quadruple bank-shot 
attempt by Democrats to thread their 
government 
dependency 
fantasy 
through a House and a Senate that are 
divided by the narrowest of margins by 
holding this bill, once it passes, hos-
tage in the House. 
The stakes here are too high. Amer-
ica is an exceptional nation. We are 
distinct from all others throughout 
history. We are exceptional because we 
provided more freedom and oppor-
tunity than any other. President Lin-
coln called it the ‘‘last best hope of 
Earth.’’ Ever since, it has fulfilled that 
promise for countless generations. 
We must fight to preserve our Amer-
ican system and the American dream, 
not in a tornado of hurried legislative 
activity that will seal its decline. 
I am asking my colleagues to fight 
for this country’s future. Our children 
and grandchildren deserve to have the 
same sort of wonderful opportunity 
that our parents and grandparents gave 
us. We need to make certain that they 
have a future for them that is better 
than today, and we are duty-bound to 
make certain that it happens. That is 
why I ran for office. 
Let’s work together on infrastruc-
ture, out from under the rapidly ap-
proaching cloud of socialism. Let’s 
make this happen a different way. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
REED). The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
want to concur with my colleague from 
Tennessee in his beautifully stated re-
marks and the way he has brought for-
ward the frustration that Tennesseans 
have. 
You know, I had the opportunity to 
be at home yesterday. We have a great 
event going on in Nashville this week-
end. It is called the Grand Prix. I had 
the opportunity to be at the opening 
event with a lot of women, small busi-
ness owners. I had the opportunity 
later in the day to go cut the ribbon for 
a big county fair and see lots of fami-
lies and talk to families who were 
there. Do you know what? They are 
completely confused with what is going 
on. 
See, Tennesseans are really smart. 
They watch what is happening in 
Washington, DC. They are so concerned 
about the future and about freedom 
and freedom’s cause, and they continue 
to say, as my colleague from Tennessee 
stated, that they want the best for 
their children and for their grand-
children because they appreciate the 
American dream. 
Many of them have lived the Amer-
ican dream, whether they are a farmer 
or a teacher; whether they are a law-
yer, an accountant, a mom, a dad, 
somebody who owns a small business 
on Main Street in one of our 95 coun-
ties in our beautiful towns. They have 
lived it. They are living it every single 
day—blood, sweat, tears, working long 
hours, investing. They look at what is 
happening here in Washington, and 
they are saying: Why are you in such a 
rush to force us into bankruptcy? 
You know, July 6, 2010—I use this 
statement all the time, Mr. President. 
Someone you and I each know because 
of our work on Armed Services: Admi-
ral Mullen. July 6, 2010, he was asked a 
question: What keeps you up at night? 
What is the greatest threat to our Na-
tion’s freedom, our democracy? Do you 
know what he said? He said: Our Na-
tion’s debt. 
Now, let me walk you back through 
the history of that debt. If we were to 
go from the time that George Wash-
ington became President up until the 
time that George W. Bush stepped out 
of office, our Nation had accrued a 
total of $10.6 trillion in debt—too much 
for me. 
When I would go to the White House 
with President Bush, I would say: Mr. 
President, there are two things that I 
think need to be addressed. No. 1 is the 
out-of-control Federal spending, and 
No. 2 is the issue of illegal immigra-
tion. 
Well, he left office $10.6 trillion in 
debt, but still very mild compared to 
what we are facing today, I think we 
would have to say. 
Now, President Obama took office, 
and he and Joe Biden went to work. Do 
you know what they did in 8 years? 
They ended up just about doubling our 
Nation’s debt—double. 
President Trump came in, tried to 
pare back on regulations and cut the 
size of the Federal Government. And 
then we had COVID. That added to the 
debt. 
Then here comes President Biden, 
and it is as if the printing presses have 
cranked up on printing those dollar 
bills, running them through as fast as 
they possibly can, because what the 
Biden administration and CHUCK SCHU-
MER
and NANCY
PELOSI
had pushed 
through was $1.9 trillion, saying that 
was necessary for CARES, even though 
all that money that had previously 
been spent had not been—or that had 
been appropriated had not been spent. 
Now, here we have $1.2 trillion. As 
my colleague said, it has become this 
bill of, here is a little bit for infra-
structure, but, oh, by the way, over 
here, here is this great big downpay-
ment on the Green New Deal. Don’t 
worry that we don’t generate enough 
electricity for an electric vehicle fleet; 
we will figure that one out later. Let’s 
just put in subsidies for electric vehi-
cles. Don’t worry about giving more 
power to the Federal Government; we 
will give you back authority, local gov-
ernments, if we think you need it. So 
$1.2 trillion in spending. Then we hear 
that 
the 
bonus 
round 
in 
this 
lollapalooza is going to be $3.5 trillion, 
but more likely, the realistic view is, it 
is going to be $5 trillion. 
So back to my point, people in Ten-
nessee are saying ‘‘What in the world 
could you possibly be thinking? What 
could you possibly be thinking?’’ be-
cause they know the history of this Na-
tion’s debt. 
Do you know what? And this really 
relates to much of the work that we do 
in SASC. They know that there is a 
threat from the people who own or hold 
our debt. Japan, our friend and ally, is 
at the top of the tier right now. The 
last time I checked last month on who 
owns our debt, you know, No. 2 is 
China. They own well over $1 trillion or 
hold over $1 trillion dollars of our debt. 
If you put the OPEC nations together— 
and, of course, after the Keystone Pipe-
line, we are now dependent on OPEC

and others for fuel. We were energy 
independent 
thanks 
to 
President 
Trump and Republicans in the House 
and Senate. We were energy inde-
pendent. But OPEC is there in that top 
five, all those OPEC countries grouped 
together. 
So people in Tennessee are really 
quite—they are miffed. They are put 
off by what is going on. 
I was really surprised. I had a text 
this morning from one of my county 
mayors: I am all for infrastructure. I 
am for the Cornyn amendment. But 
you know what, I am not for this bill 
because you have got less—or about 25 
percent of this that goes for something 
that we would deem infrastructure. 
Tennesseans love to talk about infra-
structure as four things. They talk 
about roads, river, railways, and run-
ways. And, of course, we are a logistics 
State. Everyone knows Memphis has a 
big port and a rail hub, one of two cit-
ies where all five class A railroads 
come into that city. They know that 
interstates are important. They criss-
cross 
our 
State—indeed, 
Nashville, 
where you have three major interstates 
that crisscross right there in the mid-
dle of that city. They know that Ten-
nessee—so many businesses choose to 
locate there because we are within an 
8-hour drive of a majority of the Na-
tion’s population. 
Logistics require good roads and riv-
ers and rail and runways, but, you 
know what, they are not seeing it in 
this. When you, in the name of infra-
structure, 
spend 
this 
amount 
of 
money—now, I have great respect for 
my colleagues on each side of the aisle 
who have worked to produce a product, 
to do it in a bipartisan way. That is 
commendable. It is commendable. For 
Tennesseans, the result is something 
that is frustrating to them. 
You know, this is considered to be 
the world’s greatest deliberative body. 
I always appreciated how our former 
colleague Senator Alexander would 
talk about the cup and saucer. The hot 
coffee gets poured into the cup. It spills 
over into the saucer. It cools off. You 
add some sweetener, and you get some-
thing that you enjoy. People expect 
more. They expect better of this delib-
erative body. 
Tennesseans know that our Nation’s 
freedom has been well-served by ro-
bust, 
respectful, 
bipartisan 
debate. 
That is a good thing. It strengthens 
freedom. It brings people together. It 
brings them to the table to talk about 
what is their priority. 
Now, unfortunately, most of us in 
this body have not had the opportunity 
to be at that table. Amendments that 
we have worked on that we felt like 
would have improved this bill are not 
going to be heard—not here, not in a 
hearing, in a committee. We are just 
not going to see that as a part of this 
process. That is unfortunate, and it is 
going to be unfortunate if, indeed, that 
happens on the next bill or the bill 
after that or the bill after that. We 
should return to regular order and go 
through this process. 
Now, I had about 30 amendments that 
I had offered as improvements for this 
bill. Rest assured, I am not going to 
stand here and go through each and 
every one of those amendments, but 
there are some things that I thought 
needed our attention in this bill. 
As many of my colleagues know, 
broadband is something that, whether I 
was serving in the House or back in the 
State senate in Tennessee or before 
that, going in and reorganizing the 
Tennessee Film, Entertainment and 
Music Commission for our Governor, 
broadband and moving from analog to 
digital, making high-speed internet 
available all across our State, closing 
that digital divide—I have spent so 
many hours working on this. I filed 
three amendments that I felt like 
would really do some damage control 
on these and help close the divide, get-
ting to our rural and unserved areas, 
people who have no internet. 
Amendment No. 2327 would have pro-
hibited the Federal Government from 
forcing municipal broadband provider 
programs into States that have out-
lawed them. 
Now, Tennessee is one of those States 
that say to municipalities: If you want 
to serve people within your city, that 
is great. You go ahead. But you can’t 
go outside of your boundaries. 
There are other States that have had 
this issue. There is a reason they say: 
If you serve your constituents, great, 
but don’t go outside that. It is because 
States that have allowed these schemes 
ended up banning them for a reason. 
Usually it is because these govern-
ment-run systems would end up im-
ploding, leaving the taxpayers with a 
bill that they were going to have to 
pay. 
Now, another amendment, amend-
ment No. 2377, would have prohibited 
the FCC, our Federal Communications 
Commission, from implementing price- 
setting schemes on broadband pro-
viders. Allowing the FCC to do that 
rate-setting and price-setting would de-
stroy investment in rural broadband. It 
would destroy it. We know this. And it 
would actually incentivize providers in 
avoiding these unserved areas. Some-
times we talk about that as being that 
last mile that needs to get that fiber, 
that last mile that needs fixed wireless, 
that last mile that is needing some 
form of connectivity. 
Amendment No. 2328—and we do hope 
this one makes it in the bill—would 
strike language permitting regulators 
to allow these broadband grant recipi-
ents to use the money for—and I am 
quoting the language in the bill—‘‘any 
use determined necessary . . . to facili-
tate the goals of the program.’’ Now, 
this sounds vague. It is vague. If there 
is one thing that we learned prior when 
we put a lot of money out during Presi-
dent Obama’s time, it is that some-
times this money ends up not being 
targeted to broadband but ends up as a 
slush fund. 
We also have an amendment that will 
deal with a shovel-ready infrastructure 
project on our southern border. Amend-
ment 2406 would redirect $1 billion 
from Amtrak. By the way, Amtrak is 
getting many billions of dollars in this 
bill. And it would send that money 
over to the Department of Homeland 
Security to finish the southern border 
wall construction. 
We all know what is happening on 
that border: record numbers of illegal 
aliens coming in, many very sick, 
COVID-positive. We know that they are 
ending up—as are drugs, as are gangs— 
in cities and towns across this Nation. 
Indeed, until we secure the southern 
border, every town is a border town, 
every State is a border State. 
God bless our law enforcement offi-
cers who are fighting this every day. I 
am hearing from them, and I want 
them to know I hear them, and I under-
stand the pressures that they are 
under. 
We also know that our communities 
are struggling trying to get back to 
work and really move forward with re-
growing the economy, but inflation has 
gotten in the way. 
One of the big problems that people 
point to with the high cost of fuel and 
logistics and the packing materials is 
the killing of the Keystone Pipeline. 
Amendment 2298 would amend section 
4034 of the bill, which calls for a study 
on job loss and impacts on consumer 
energy due to the revocation of the 
permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline. 
My amendment says that if the report 
shows that killing the pipeline caused 
numerous job losses and an impact on 
consumer energy costs, that the Presi-
dent should revoke—he shall revoke his 
Executive order and get out of the way 
of the pipeline construction. 
Get people back to work and get the 
prices at the pump, get them down. Get 
them down to where they were when 
President Trump left office. I mean, 
what is the purpose of a report if it 
doesn’t have any teeth? So let’s take 
an action on that. 
There is no bill that is ever perfect. 
They all have to be worked on. Many 
times, we come back a year or so later, 
and we do technical corrections on a 
bill. We make changes. And this is no 
different. This bill needs time. It needs 
a thorough amendment process. It 
needs to go back to the committees of 
jurisdiction to work through these 
issues. 
Are the American people for infra-
structure? Yes, they are for infrastruc-
ture. Tennesseans are for infrastruc-
ture. I am for infrastructure projects. 
Yes, indeed. Am I for this piece of leg-
islation? No, because it is a document 
that has misplaced priorities. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded.

dered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6006 
August 7, 2021 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, we are de-
bating a bill that a number of us have 
spoken of on a number of occasions. 
Since my last address on the Senate 
floor on this topic, we received a score 
on the bill from the Congressional 
Budget Office. 
Now, remember, it is the CBO’s role 
to put together a score on legislation 
we are considering. It is part of how 
the system works in Washington so we 
can assess what will and will not add to 
the deficit and how it will do so if it 
does. It is an important part of the 
process. 
When we finally received the CBO 
score just about 48 hours ago, we dis-
covered a few things. We discovered 
that, despite the representations we 
have heard by the bill’s staunchest ad-
vocates to the effect that the bill 
would be paid for—that it is, that it 
would not add to the debt and deficit, 
and that it would not add to the debt 
and deficit in a way that also didn’t in-
volve raising taxes—it turned out that 
the CBO rejected the claim that this 
bill was paid for. In fact, the CBO con-
cluded that $256 of the $550 billion it 
claimed in pay-fors did not pay. They 
are not paid for, and thus that they 
will considerably—I mean, we are talk-
ing here about over a quarter of a tril-
lion dollars that would go right on to 
the debt and deficit. 
They also concluded that in the long 
run, over the next 10 years, we will be 
looking at an additional $340 billion in 
cost to the Federal Government—a 
cost that by some estimates could 
reach as high as $400 billion because of 
the spillover effect that this bill is 
likely to have on future spending, con-
tracting authority, and otherwise. 
So this bill is not paid for. The pay- 
fors suggested by the bill’s proponents 
don’t get the job done. In fact, more 
than half of them simply don’t get 
there. We do, however, see that there 
are some of the pay-fors that create 
significant policy concerns. 
One of the pay-fors that isn’t fake is 
an extension of the so-called g-fees—g- 
fees being imposed by entities like 
Fannie Mae that will inevitably in-
crease the cost that home buyers will 
face when they go to buy a home. Now, 
why does that matter here? Well, we 
have seen a startling uptick in infla-
tion—inflation across the board, every-
thing from gas to groceries and every-
thing from healthcare to housing. We 
see that increasing stunningly in a way 
that a lot of people are pointing out, 
correctly, that first-time home buyers 
are now finding it very difficult to get 
into a home. This is something that is 
going to end up affecting all poor and 
middle-class Americans at a time they 
can little afford it. And yet we are in-
creasing these fees—fees that are in ef-
fect a back-door invisible tax on a lot 
of those who are least in a position to 
pay. 
Some of the other non-fake pay-fors 
that actually do bring something in in-
clude an increase in the fees paid by 
manufacturers and distributors of cer-
tain chemicals. The issue there is that 
this fee, while labeled as not a tax—be-
cause, technically speaking, it is not a 
tax—will end up increasing the price of 
basically every consumer good pur-
chased by the American people. 
The way these things end up working 
is that to the tune of about $15 billion 
or so, Americans will find that pretty 
much everything they buy, from ap-
parel to electronics, will get a little 
more expensive. They may not see it. 
In fact, the overwhelming majority of 
them won’t even know to attribute it 
to this particular piece of legislation, 
but it will have that effect. It will 
make all Americans a little poorer. It 
will make all Americans face the very 
stark reality in which their already 
strapped dollars that they earn will go 
just a little bit less far. 
We have to remember that from one 
year to the next, we don’t see dramatic 
fluctuations in the quantity of goods 
that the American people have access 
to that they may buy. In other words, 
the U.S. economy is capable of pro-
ducing a relatively foreseeable, pre-
dictable, somewhat finite supply of 
goods in a particular year. When that 
doesn’t change dramatically from one 
year to the next, as it almost never 
does, but you dramatically increase the 
money supply in the U.S. economy, 
then what you see is that everything 
gets a little bit more expensive. This 
ends up hurting, in particular, Amer-
ica’s poor and middle class. It ends up 
hurting, in particular, those Ameri-
cans, including most Americans who in 
one way or another live paycheck to 
paycheck, who in one way or another 
depend on the income that they have, 
and the income that they have is rel-
atively fixed. So, as a result of that, 
they don’t get as far. 
Now, you have got some Americans, 
including the wealthiest and well-con-
nected in our society, who may well 
figure out ways to get wealthy off of 
this bill. One way or another, they can 
play things to their advantage, and 
they may make a lot of money off of it. 
You have got another category of 
very wealthy Americans—maybe, you 
know, people in the top 1 or 2 percent 
of income earners—who might notice 
that the things they buy are getting 
more expensive, but it might not affect 
them all that much. 
But then you have got everyone else, 
and I mean the vast, overwhelming ma-
jority of all Americans, who, in one 
way or another, plan out each year 
knowing that they have got a rel-
atively finite amount of money to 
spend, and that money goes less far 
when we just print money to the tune 
of trillions and trillions of dollars. 
Remember, the Federal Government, 
in recent years, has been spending 
about $4 trillion a year. Tragically, 
even at the top of our economic cycle, 
with record low unemployment and 
with record high growth, we were still 
spending $1 trillion a year more than 
we were bringing in—bringing in about 
$3 trillion, spending about $4 trillion. 
This was inexcusable then. It would be 
inexcusable now, except that we are 
making it much, much worse. 
Last year, we took in about $3 tril-
lion, and we spent $3.6 trillion—bor-
rowing and then printing close to 4 
trillion additional dollars. What does 
this do? Well, it makes all Americans 
just a little bit poorer, especially those 
living on a relatively fixed income. 
So this is troubling when we do that. 
We ought to be concerned when we do 
that. Inflation numbers that are com-
ing out all the time, including some 
that I have heard about the first time 
today, indicate that everything is get-
ting more expensive. And what are we 
doing? Well, we are on track to spend 
another $1.2 trillion, including $550 bil-
lion of new spending, which the bill’s 
proponents claim is paid for when most 
of it isn’t paid for. And that portion of 
it that is paid for is in one way or an-
other often paid for in a way that will 
inure to the detriment of poor, middle- 
class Americans. This is concerning. 
It is also concerning that one of the 
other pay-for provisions is the one fo-
cused on cryptocurrency. It focuses on 
an industry that is rapidly devel-
oping—rapidly developing within the 
United States—that depends on a lot of 
innovation happening in the United 
States. One of these pay-for provisions 
seeks to bring in more revenue to the 
Federal Government or at least to 
promise more revenue to the Federal 
Government, with the promise of re-
quiring 
those 
who 
spy 
and 
sell 
cryptocurrency to treat it the same 
way as they would the exchange of se-
curities. 
This is very different than securities. 
These aren’t just stocks. It is some-
thing very different. It is a medium of 
exchange that, if adopted more widely, 
could facilitate a lot of economic activ-
ity and a lot of innovation within the 
United States of America. If, in fact, 
we pass this bill, mark my words, it is 
going to have a chilling effect on inno-
vation within this sector. 
And what you will see is that the 
flight of innovation and investment re-
lated to innovation to offshore loca-
tions around the globe, places outside 
the United States, may well be the 
ones to reap the benefit associated 
with the loss here in the United States 
if we adopt an unproven, untested, un-
known strategy for dealing with some-
thing, trying to adopt many decades- 
old regulatory policies to a completely 
new form of exchange; one that, by the 
way, values very highly the privacy of 
those who exchange it. 
So if what you are going to do is take 
away that value by requiring that all 
of it be registered and publicly dis-
closed and by giving the Federal Gov-
ernment the ability to peer into it, you 
are going to stifle innovation. You are 
going to make a lot of people upset, 
and you are going to make Americans 
poorer. 
At the heart of a lot of this is a con-
cern that the Federal Government, as

August 7, 2021 
it takes more and more money, as it 
prints more and more money, as it re-
quires Americans to work weeks or 
months out of every year just to pay 
their Federal taxes, only to be told 
that it is not nearly enough and it 
hasn’t been enough for many decades 
because we are nearly $30 trillion in 
debt—it is still not enough because we 
are still going to borrow and print 
more. 
It is insulting to them, and it is espe-
cially insulting to them when you tell 
them that in connection with the same 
legislation that also includes other in-
trusions into their privacy. 
For example, there is a pilot program 
called for in this legislation that will 
be created by this legislation that 
would be designed specifically to mon-
itor how many miles someone drives in 
a year. Now, this has long been a fan-
tasy of a number of people who would 
like to see the Federal Government 
tracking miles driven by every motor-
ist in America. 
Now, we all know that there is al-
most no way to achieve this that 
wouldn’t excessively interfere with the 
privacy rights of every man, woman, 
and child in America. Look, the Amer-
ican people are fine with a government 
that makes sure that we are safe from 
foreign 
aggressors, 
that 
regulates 
interstate and foreign commerce, that 
coins money and regulates the value 
thereof, that adopts a uniform set of 
bankruptcy laws, immigration laws, 
protects trademarks, copyrights, and 
patents. 
What they do not want is a nanny. 
What they do not want is a snooping 
device added to every car that will 
track them; that will track where they 
and their families are going. It is none 
of their darn business. Keep the Fed-
eral Government out of this. Look, 
whether you want more government 
spending or not, chances are, if you are 
listening to this, you probably are con-
cerned, regardless of what political hat 
you wear, regardless of whom you 
voted for in recent Presidential or con-
gressional 
elections. 
You 
probably 
don’t want the Federal Government in 
your car monitoring your every move 
knowing where you are going. 
We know that when governments do 
that, when they start to assume that 
everything is government’s business, 
bad things happen. It ends in tears and 
wars. That is none of the Federal Gov-
ernment’s darn business. We don’t 
want the Federal Government even de-
veloping technology to start snooping 
on every person’s every move. 
Which brings me to yet another in-
trusion on personal privacy and liberty 
in this legislation. Section 24220 calls 
for the development and, within just a 
few years, the formalization and final-
ization of regulations that would re-
quire passenger vehicles manufactured 
and sold within the United States to 
have a device that would passively 
measure the blood alcohol content of 
the driver and do so in a way that 
would inhibit or at least impair the 
ability of the vehicle to operate if the 
vehicle, in its infinite wisdom, was able 
to ascertain that the blood alcohol con-
tent of the driver was over 0.8. 
Now, look, we are all for stopping 
drunk driving. It is terrible. It results 
in countless lives lost. But we can all 
see a lot of things that can go wrong 
with that. Setting aside for a minute 
the constitutional implications of the 
intrusiveness of putting technology in 
every passenger vehicle that requires, 
at the outset, without any finding that 
anyone has done anything wrong, that 
requires you to take a test mandated 
by the Federal Government every time 
you want to do something as simple as 
turn on your car—then let’s consider 
what happens when, with such a tech-
nology, which to my knowledge doesn’t 
yet exist—with such a technology, as-
suming it is able to come into exist-
ence because of these burdensome regu-
lations in a few years, that technology, 
if they are able to develop it, is going 
to be costly. Who does that hurt? Well, 
you guessed it. Poor and middle-class 
Americans who will all of a sudden find 
that every passenger vehicle will be-
come a lot more expensive. It is just 
the way it works. 
When we mandate the creation of 
new Federal regulations, and those 
Federal regulations apply to any new 
automobile sold in the United States, 
the price of new automobiles goes up. 
And in the case of a particularly novel 
and particularly sophisticated tech-
nology like this one, I suspect it will 
go up a lot. 
This may not be troubling to the mil-
lionaires and billionaires out there who 
don’t feel the pinch of that, but to ev-
eryone else, the 99 percent of all Amer-
icans—more than that, I suppose—this 
hurts. Moreover, what happens when 
that technology malfunctions? Not if 
but when. Look, we have all had cars 
that will malfunction for one reason or 
another, and oftentimes it is basic se-
curity devices, something as simple as 
that annoying beeper that goes off 
until you put your seatbelt on. Some-
times some people will put their seat-
belt on, and it still pings. That is a ter-
ribly annoying nuisance when that 
happens. The consequences are much 
more deeply felt; they are much more 
severe if someone gets in the car, 
whether it is to go to work, to come 
home from work, to take a loved one to 
the doctor or the hospital, and it 
doesn’t work. 
Look, glitches happen, and if you are 
talking about adding an override to a 
vehicle—you know, maybe that over-
ride to the vehicle mistakenly thinks 
that it smells alcohol, maybe it doesn’t 
like the aftershave or cologne you are 
wearing on that particular day, maybe 
the whole thing stops working, and 
your car stops working with it. This 
isn’t one of those things where you can 
just open up the hood and find the pres-
ence of an on-off switch, as Jerry 
Seinfeld might have put it many years 
ago. No, this is much more sophisti-
cated technology that the average, 
hard-working American isn’t going to 
be able to fix quickly. They won’t even 
be able to see it. There again, they are 
going to face more costs as they take 
their vehicle into the shop to have it 
evaluated by a certified technician ca-
pable of dealing with that brandnew, 
very 
sophisticated, 
very 
expensive 
technology. 
So with each of these things, we see 
something of a common theme. The 
Federal Government, which already 
plays too prominent a role in too many 
people’s lives, which is already taxing 
us too much, spying on us too much, 
and considering everything under the 
Sun its business—we are making even 
more 
things 
its 
business, 
from 
cryptocurrency to where and how far 
you drive your car, to whether you can 
operate your car at all. We are doing 
all of this so that we can spend even 
more Federal money on even more Fed-
eral infrastructure projects, which are 
even more expensive by virtue of the 
fact that we are dealing with Federal 
dollars, for the simple reason that com-
pliance with all the Federal regula-
tions that accompany the expenditure 
of Federal infrastructure dollars costs 
a lot of money. In many States like 
mine, it can cost 20, 30 percent, some-
times even more, on top of what it 
would cost if these were just State rev-
enues that they were spending. 
So I would ask the question: Is it 
worth it? I would ask the question: Do 
we want Big Brother knowing our 
every move? I would ask the question: 
Do we want a government that is al-
ready requiring you to work weeks or 
months out of every year just to pay 
your Federal taxes? Do you want it 
printing even more money, making 
sure that the dollars that you spend, 
which are finite, limited, and sacred, 
will go even less far? I think not, and 
I urge my colleagues who support this 
legislation to reconsider.

Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak about the Restaurant Revitaliza-
tion Fund, and then I will be asking 
unanimous consent to consider legisla-
tion. 
We included the Restaurant Revital-
ization Fund in our March legislation 
on COVID relief. We did that because, 
of all of the industries affected by 
COVID–19, restaurants have been some 
of the most difficult businesses to sur-
vive COVID–19. 
They were ordered by government, 
basically, to shut down at the begin-
ning of COVID–19. Then, as we started

August 7, 2021 
to make progress, they were at much 
restricted operations. And to this day, 
restaurants are still not up to their full 
capacity. Their revenues have been 
very much decimated as a result of 
COVID–19. 
We came together in March with bi-
partisan legislation in order to do 
something about that, and we included 
that in our legislation—$28.6 billion of 
relief for restaurants. Now, what it did 
is cover some of their revenue loss as a 
result of COVID–19. It gave them a life-
line to be able to survive this pan-
demic. 
We projected that $28.6 billion would 
be the need, but we were wrong. We 
were wrong because COVID–19 was 
more severe than we thought, res-
taurants were more badly damaged 
than we had anticipated, and there was 
a great deal of more demand and need 
than the $28.6 billion. We are now being 
told by the Small Business Administra-
tion that the right number was $71.3 
billion, or an additional $42.7 billion 
that is needed. 
I have introduced bipartisan legisla-
tion to provide this additional author-
ity to the SBA to complete this pro-
gram. It is bipartisan. My partner in 
this is Senator WICKER. We are joined 
by Senator SCHUMER, Senator MUR-
KOWSKI, Senator CANTWELL, Senator 
ERNST, Senator SINEMA, Senator CAS-
SIDY, Senator STABENOW, and Senator 
HYDE-SMITH. And I might add, there 
are many, many more Senators on both 
sides of the aisle who very much sup-
port our efforts to live up to our com-
mitment. 
Now, why do we need to take this up 
right now? 
This is a matter of life or death for 
many restaurants in our community. 
There is also a matter of fairness. 
We have two restaurants, side by 
side, in the exact same circumstances, 
submitting their applications on the 
same day, having the exact same need. 
Both were advised that they will get 
funding. One got funding before the 
$28.6 billion was exhausted. The other 
that was told they were going to get 
funding, they won’t get funding unless 
we act. That is not right. 
There is a matter of the credibility of 
the U.S. Senate and of Congress and of 
government. We say we are going to do 
something. We should live up to our 
commitments. The urgency of getting 
this done is now. 
I don’t think there is a Senator in 
this Chamber who hasn’t heard from 
restaurants in their State about how 
badly they need these funds and how 
they thought these funds were going to 
be in their bank, and they are no 
longer in the bank. I have heard from 
so many Senators about this. The ur-
gency is now. 
Let me just anticipate one other ar-
gument that I might hear, and that is: 
Well, where are we getting this money 
from? 
Well, legislation before us takes $36 
billion out of the small business pro-
grams—$36 billion. So this is paid for 
by the rescissions that have been made 
in this legislation that we are consid-
ering, that is before us today. So for all 
of those reasons, this is a fiscally re-
sponsible thing to do. 
Lastly, before I yield the floor to the 
majority leader, let me say that we 
made a commitment to help our small 
businesses. We did that—Democrats 
and Republicans—working together. In 
some cases we overestimated the dol-
lars that we need. In some cases we un-
derestimated the dollars that we need. 
But we always came back and provided 
the full funding for the programs we 
have authorized, and, in total, it is not 
much different than has previously 
been authorized. 
This is a matter of fairness and a 
matter of absolute need that we pro-
vide the extra money now for the res-
taurants. 
Before I make my unanimous consent 
request, I would yield the floor so the 
majority leader can get the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Well, I thank my 
good friend from Maryland for offering 
this UC, and strongly and fervently 
support it. 
I have been proud to join Senators 
CARDIN and SINEMA in leading the fight 
to provide direct relief to this industry. 
We all know restaurants were particu-
larly hard hit during COVID, and the 
idea that they have all recovered is 
just so far from the truth. 
You know, any business where people 
had to gather were hit hard—hit the 
hardest; restaurants at the very top of 
the list, and they are a lifeblood to our 
cities and our communities. They, of 
course, are a place where people get 
food, but they get community. They 
join together. They feel roots. Whether 
it is a small town or a large city, res-
taurants in neighborhood after neigh-
borhood, community after community, 
are often the glue that make commu-
nities tick; and they were hurt. 
The funds that we provided, provided 
a lifeline to 100,000 applicants across 
the country. In my State of New York, 
$3.6 billion went to 9,775 restaurants. 
But the job wasn’t done. They ran out 
of money long before restaurants were 
helped. 
And anyone who thinks our res-
taurants are out of trouble, I just ate 
at one last night—a Polish couple in 
Greenpoint—lovely little restaurant: 
Are you hurting? Yes; we might go 
under. 
And this story could be repeated in 
restaurant after restaurant after res-
taurant. 
In New York, 27,000 restaurants are 
waiting in desperation. These are hard- 
working 
people—very 
hard-working 
people. They struggle. They put their 
all, their whole heart and soul, into the 
business and provide, as I said, often 
the glue for our communities. 
This legislation is fair. It is smart. It 
is right. We will get economic payback 
over and over and over again from 
keeping these restaurants going be-
cause they employ so many people, 
contract with so many independent 
suppliers and others. It just makes 
such sense. 
It is almost cruel to tell these res-
taurants, ‘‘You are on your own now,’’ 
when, through no fault of their own, 
they 
have 
suffered 
through 
with 
COVID. 
So I strongly support this proposal 
by Senator CARDIN. We are going to 
keep at it and keep at it and keep at it 
because our restaurants so desperately 
need the help. 
It was bipartisan in the past. Let’s 
keep it bipartisan, but let’s get the job 
done. Our restaurants need help, and 
our communities, our cities, our rural 
towns, our suburbs will be so rewarded 
when these restaurants are allowed to 
continue to stay open and to flourish. 
I thank the Senator for his leader-
ship. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me 
thank Senator SCHUMER for his com-
ments. I agree completely with every-
thing the Senator said. 
I would just make one additional 
point before I make my unanimous 
consent request. 
What I am asking for now has been 
what we have been following in regard 
to small business relief. Let me remind 
our colleagues that we work together, 
Democrats and Republicans, to craft 
the programs that help small business 
and save so many small businesses in 
our community. 
We misprojected the costs of the Pay-
check Protection Program, not by $30 
or $40 billion, by over $300 billion when 
we set it up. And we came back, Demo-
crats and Republicans lived up to our 
commitment and made the funds avail-
able that all small businesses could get 
fair treatment and equitable treatment 
under the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. 
I am asking my colleagues to do the 
exact same thing we did for the Pay-
check Protection Program for the Res-
taurant Revitalization Program. 
And as already has been pointed out, 
there have been funds taken away from 
the small business programs under the 
bill we are considering on the floor 
today to almost the same amount that 
we are asking in supplemental funds. 
With that, Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of S. 
2675 introduced earlier today; that the 
bill be considered read three times and 
passed; and the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. The Treasury has been so 
thoroughly looted that we are incur-
ring debt at a record-setting and 
alarming pace. Never in the history of 
our country have we incurred so much 
debt so fast.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6009 
August 7, 2021 
Our national debt now exceeds $28 
trillion. It is now at 128 percent of our 
GDP. And we are asked by the Demo-
cratic Party to add $48 billion without 
so much as a—could we have a debate 
in committee?—so much as even a word 
spoken over this. We are just going to 
add $48 billion with no discussion. It is 
a huge mistake. 
Now, it has been alleged that, well, 
the thing is that the restaurants are 
suffering because of COVID. No. They 
are suffering because Democrat Gov-
ernors locked them down. This is a 
manmade phenomenon. The economic 
disaster that we are in, that res-
taurants are in, is completely and en-
tirely caused by Democrat Governors. 
In my State, they are suing the Dem-
ocrat Governor because he won’t let 
them open up. This is a manmade phe-
nomenon. So if you reward a manmade 
phenomenon, you will get more of it. 
You reward Democrat Governors who 
shut these restaurants down, guess 
what, they will shut them down longer. 
The longer you give money to Demo-
crat Governors for their lockdown poli-
cies, the more lockdowns you will get. 
We need to open up the country. We 
need to learn to live with this disease. 
As tragic as it has been, we need to 
learn to live with it. 
But the lockdowns have not worked. 
Closing the restaurants did not work, 
did not change the trajectory of this 
virus one iota. The only thing that is 
changing the trajectory of this virus 
now is the vaccine, plus natural immu-
nity. Closing the restaurants did noth-
ing and is doing nothing, except for 
devastating the bottom line of res-
taurants. 
So with that, I would object to the 
unanimous consent. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I regret 
the decision of my colleague from Ken-
tucky. 
I just really want to point out, we 
have had hearings in our committee— 
Small Business Committee—in which 
the Restaurant Revitalization Act was 
very much brought up during the hear-
ing. 
We have been receiving timely infor-
mation about this program and how it 
has been implemented and the need for 
additional funds. So our committee has 
had ample opportunity to question how 
the program was being administered 
and the need for different funds. 
I also regret that my colleague is 
holding the restaurants pretty much 
hostage and saying it is all right for us 
to give money to some but not others, 
when the administration of this was 
compromised because of a court case, 
and certain restaurants are now des-
perate as a result of not having ade-
quate funds. 
I am encouraged by the comments of 
the majority leader, Senator SCHUMER, 
that we will continue to focus on this 
issue. I can tell you, it is urgent. We 
really need to deal with this imme-
diately, and we will be looking for 
every available opportunity to treat 
our restaurants equitably and fairly 
and provide the money that is needed 
to implement the Restaurant Revital-
ization Program. 
I regret that we are not able to act 
today because of the Senator’s objec-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant majority leader. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I just 
would like to add a word and thank the 
Senator from Maryland for his leader-
ship, and the Senator from New York 
for supporting this, and to reflect for a 
moment on the comments of the objec-
tor, the Senator from Kentucky. 
His exact words were: We have got to 
learn to live with this. 
Unfortunately, people are not living 
with this; they are getting infected and 
dying. And to accept the status quo 
and somehow make it a partisan 
issue—that it is the Democratic Gov-
ernors who are responsible for what is 
going on here—is a sad oversimplifica-
tion. In fact, it is tragic. 
We know what is happening. We have 
a new variant of this COVID–19 virus 
that has emerged because it is still on 
the loose and it is changing by the day. 
We think the Delta variant is dan-
gerous, maybe dramatically more con-
tagious than the original virus. 
We know that even people who have 
been 
vaccinated 
can 
unknowingly 
transmit this disease, the new Delta 
variant, and we know that it has taken 
a deadly toll on 90 percent of the pa-
tients who were not vaccinated and 
were subjected to the illness that came 
about. 
I just want to say, in general, I 
couldn’t agree more with Senator 
SCHUMER and Senator CARDIN that res-
taurants in our cities are really the 
lifeblood. Whether it is my hometown 
of Springfield, IL, or Chicago, which I 
am honored to represent, I will tell you 
that these restaurants are still strug-
gling, and as they struggle, our cities 
struggle. 
And people that I know really meas-
ure where we are, as an American na-
tion, recovering by the vibrancy of 
these restaurant businesses, the ones 
that are our favorites and bring us to-
gether. 
They have done their part. We should 
do our part to give them a helping 
hand. Let’s get through this pandemic 
together. We are certainly not going to 
do it by saying that we have to accept 
the Delta variant and that whatever 
else follows is just the natural course 
of things. 
We have it within our power to 
change that. More vaccinations and 
more careful use of masks and social 
distancing will make a difference—can 
make a real difference in this country. 
Until we come to grips with that re-
ality, we are going to continue to face 
these devastating disappointments. 
Again, I thank the Senator from 
Maryland for bringing this before us. I 
hope he will continue to offer it. 
I yield the floor.

ator from New Mexico.

NOMINATION OF EUNICE C. LEE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, in a 
minute, I am going to ask to vote on 
confirmation for Eunice Lee to be a 
U.S. circuit judge on the Second Cir-
cuit. She is an amazing person. I inter-
viewed her and recommended her to 
the President. She will be the only pub-
lic defender on the Second Circuit. We 
have had very, very few public defend-
ers on that circuit and largely on our 
Federal bench. They tend to be pros-
ecutors, partners in big law firms. We 
are changing all of that and getting 
people who have different walks of 
life—like public defenders, like people 
from the ACLU, like people from dif-
ferent organizations—so we have a new 
perspective on the bench. She is a phe-
nomenal person. I am so proud that she 
will now get on the bench. 
I ask that the Senate now vote on 
confirmation of the Lee nomination to 
be a U.S. circuit judge.

MORNING BUSINESS 
RESIDENTIAL SATELLITE 
BROADBAND SERVICE 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, my 
State of Maryland has a proud history 
of innovation in satellite technology 
and space exploration. Greenbelt, MD, 
is home to Goddard, the National Aero-
nautics and Space Administration’s 
first Space Flight Center Space Flight 
Center. The National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration, which oper-
ates a fleet of weather satellites, has 
its headquarters in Silver Spring. Addi-
tionally, the largest provider of resi-
dential satellite broadband service, 
Hughes 
Network 
Systems, 
is 
headquartered in Germantown. Hughes 
serves consumers in some of the most 
rural, hard-to-reach areas of the coun-
try. 
As the Senate considers the bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill, I believe there 
is broad agreement that the broadband 
deployment grants established by the 
bill and administered by the Depart-
ment of Commerce would help bring 
broadband service to unserved and un-
derserved households in some of the 
most rural areas in the U.S. I also be-
lieve that satellite technology can and 
should be one of the technological op-
tions for achieving our broadband de-
ployment goals. Because a geo-sta-
tionary satellite orbits at 22,500 miles 
above earth, however, even signals 
traveling at the speed of light take a 
split-second longer to reach their des-
tination, causing ‘‘latency’’—or delay— 
in real-time broadband applications. 
Fortunately, satellite innovators in 
Maryland and elsewhere have designed 
measures to reduce latency by using a 
mix of communications platforms, in-
cluding low-earth orbit satellites and 
fixed wireless networks. 
I believe that where the broadband 
grants provision in division F, title I of 
the infrastructure bill establishes a 
‘‘real-time, interactive’’ standard for 
permissible latency, residential sat-
ellite broadband service providers may 
meet this standard by offering a hybrid 
mix 
of 
geostationary 
and 
nongeo-
stationary satellite networks or fixed

f 
ZAMBIA 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise to discuss Zambia’s upcoming elec-
tions and the erosion of democracy 
under President Edgar Lungu. On Au-
gust 12, the people of Zambia will go to 
the polls to elect their President and 
members of the National Assembly. 
They will do so under the cloud of 
growing authoritarianism, with troops 
in the streets, protesters in prison, and 
dissenting voices muzzled by censor-
ship. Indeed, many Zambians have good 
reason to be dissatisfied with their 
present government and, in a free and 
fair vote, might very well reject Presi-
dent Lungu’s bid for reelection. But I 
fear they may not have that oppor-
tunity. 
For nearly 30 years, Zambians have 
enjoyed a relatively free and open po-
litical environment. In 1991, Zambia’s 
founding father Kenneth Kaunda lost 
the country’s first multiparty election 
in decades and gracefully stepped aside 
after 27 years in power. President 
Kaunda died in June of this year, at 
the age of 97, with a complicated leg-
acy; he was a liberator, but also held 
an iron grip on power for nearly three 
decades. However, his final act of pub-
lic service paved the way for democ-
racy to take root in his country in the 
years that followed. Sadly, President 
Lungu is erasing that monumental 
contribution to the Zambian people. 
Since 
President 
Lungu’s 
rise 
to 
power in 2014, he has used the organs of 
the state to intimidate his political op-
ponents and consolidate power for his 
Patriotic Front—PF—party. Freedom 
House rates Zambia as only ‘‘partly 
free,’’ citing laws and government ac-
tions which have had the effect of re-
stricting the activities of opposition 
parties, limiting civil society partici-
pation, and curbing free expression. 
Similarly, the U.S. Department of 
State, in its 2020 Country Reports on 
Human Rights Practices, noted ‘‘sig-
nificant human rights issues’’ in Zam-
bia, particularly in the area of elec-
tions and political participation. 
In March, the Zambian political ana-
lyst Dr. Sishuwa Sishuwa published an 
essay in which he warned that ‘‘Zambia 
may burn after the August elections.’’ 
He wrote that the public’s distrust of 
Zambia’s institutions and the ruthless 
competition between its political elites 
had contributed to a climate of fear 
and anger that could plunge the coun-
try into chaos. The subversion of the 
independence of the courts and other 
public institutions has led to a lack of 
confidence. Credible allegations of cor-
ruption and impunity have been made 
against leaders. A collapsing economy, 
mismanaged by President Lungu to the 
point of defaulting on its foreign loans, 
has resulted in mass youth unemploy-
ment 
and 
rising 
inequality. 
Dr. 
Sishuwa also noted Western countries’ 
declining assistance to Zambia and 
their silence on its democratic back-
sliding. He painted a vivid image of a 
once-peaceful and prosperous country 
on the brink of calamity. According to 
the Committee to Protect Journalists, 
Zambian police began investigating Dr. 
Sishuwa for sedition shortly after the 
essay’s publication. 
Indeed, political violence has already 
arrived on the streets of Zambia. 
Fighting between supporters of the PF 
and the opposition United Party for 
National Development—UPND—left at 
least two people dead last week. Troops 
have been mobilized to restore order, 
but Zambian security forces have also 
been accused of using deadly force 
against peaceful protesters. 
The United States has a clear inter-
est in ensuring that Zambia remains a 
free and stable country. We have pro-
vided approximately $500 million in as-
sistance to Zambiaa every year. At a 
time of increasing instability in South-
ern Africa, with unrest in South Africa 
and 
Eswatini, 
crackdowns 
in 
Zimbabwe, a brutal insurgency in Mo-
zambique, and the rampant spread of 
COVID–19, the region cannot afford 
Zambia’s collapse. We know that insta-
bility anywhere has a rippling effect 
that impacts U.S. interests and our al-
lies. 
Moreover, Zambia presents a test for 
the Biden administration’s commit-
ment to promoting and protecting de-
mocracy abroad. I encourage the ad-
ministration to more address Zambia’s 
democratic backsliding. I hope that is 
corrected before elections commence. 
We should be clear with President 
Lungu that the United States does not 
tolerate authoritarianism and that the 
generosity of the American people is 
not without limits. The United States 
should increase support for Zambian 
civil-society and democracy and gov-
ernance programming in Zambia. Fi-
nally, the Biden administration can 
demonstrate its commitment to the bi-
lateral relationship by nominating a 
skilled and experienced diplomat to 
serve as ambassador to Zambia. 
While the United States stands with 
the Zambian people, ultimately, re-
sponsibility for Zambia’s democratic 
decline lies squarely with President 
Lungu and his government. In the 
short term, President Lungu must 
commit to holding free and fair elec-
tions on August 12 and ensure trans-
parency in the process by permitting 
election monitors to observe the vote 
without restrictions. He must also pub-
licly commit to accept the outcome of 
the election, and step aside should he 
lose. Regardless of the outcome, the 
PF, UPND, and all other parties must 
work together to restore the integrity 
and independence of public institu-
tions, end impunity for state violence, 
and address corruption. They must do 
this by partnering with civil society, 
restoring freedom of the press, and re-
specting civil liberties. They must ac-
cept that dissent and protest are not a 
threat to their power, but rather proof 
of a healthy polity. 
This will be a long and difficult proc-
ess which will test the courage and pa-
triotism 
of 
Zambia’s 
elites. 
Next 
week’s elections may be the first step 
towards Zambia’s renewal or else the 
next step towards its ruin. Perhaps 
President Lung can take inspiration 
from Kenneth Kendal’s final act of 
leadership and put his country before 
his own political interests.

RECOGNIZING THE MINORITY 
VETERANS OF AMERICA 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Minority Vet-
erans of America on the occasion of 
their fourth anniversary on August 7, 
2021. Minority Veterans of America is 
doing important work in home State of 
Washington and around the country 
advancing equity and justice for nearly 
5 million underrepresented veterans, 
including 
women, 
people 
of 
color, 
LGBTQIA+, and religious and nonreli-
gious minorities. As a nation, we make 
a promise to take care of our veterans 
when they return from service. It is the 
least we can do for those who have sac-
rificed to defend our freedoms. Minor-
ity Veterans of America addresses the 
additional challenges minority vet-
erans face in receiving the benefits 
they have earned. 
Minority Veterans of America was 
founded in Washington State in 2017 by 
two military veterans, Lindsay Church 
and Katherine Pratt. Over the course 
of 4 years, Minority Veterans of Amer-
ica has grown to include thousands of 
members spread across nearly every 
State. They have worked tirelessly ad-
vocating for reforms that address eco-
nomic and health disparities among 
minority veterans. In my home State 
of Washington, they have organized in-
novative programs that address the 
unique need of minority veterans in 
transitioning to civilian life, financial 
stability, social engagement, and ac-
cess to resources. At the national level, 
Minority Veterans of America has or-
ganized grassroots movements to ad-
dress issues such as discrimination in 
the military, military sexual trauma, 
and the transgender military ban. They 
also work directly with the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs to increase 
equitable and inclusive access to serv-
ices. 
It is clear to me that Minority Vet-
erans of America has made a substan-
tial contribution to veterans in Wash-
ington State and across the country. It 
is my pleasure to thank Minority Vet-
erans of America for their hard work 
and commitment. I congratulate Mi-
nority Veterans of America on 4 years 
of outstanding service to our military 
veterans and look forward to working 
with them in the years to come as we 
continue to advance equity and inclu-
sion for our veterans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6017 
August 7, 2021 
At the end of title VI of division G, add the 
following: 
Subtitle C—National Cyber Resilience 
Assistance Fund 
SEC. 70621. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NATIONAL 
CYBER 
RESILIENCE 
ASSISTANCE 
FUND. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the United States now operates in a 
cyber landscape that requires a level of data 
security, 
resilience, 
and 
trustworthiness 
that neither the United States Government 
nor the private sector alone is currently 
equipped to provide; 
(2) the United States must deny benefits to 
adversaries who have long exploited cyber-
space to their advantage, to the disadvan-
tage of the United States, and at little cost 
to themselves; 
(3) this new approach requires securing 
critical networks in collaboration with the 
private sector to promote national resilience 
and increase the security of the cyber eco-
system; 
(4) reducing the vulnerabilities adversaries 
can target denies them opportunities to at-
tack the interests of the United States 
through cyberspace; 
(5) the public and private sectors struggle 
to coordinate cyber defenses, leaving gaps 
that decrease national resilience and create 
systemic risk; 
(6) new technology continues to emerge 
that further compounds these challenges; 
(7) while the Homeland Security Grant 
Program and resourcing for national pre-
paredness under the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency are well-established, 
the United States Government has no equiv-
alent for cybersecurity preparation or pre-
vention; 
(8) the lack of a consistent, resourced fund 
for investing in resilience in key areas inhib-
its the United States Government from con-
veying its understanding of risk into strat-
egy, planning, and action in furtherance of 
core objectives for the security and resil-
ience of critical infrastructure; 
(9) the Federal Government must fun-
damentally shift the way it invests in resil-
ience and shift the focus away from reactive 
disaster 
spending 
towards 
research-sup-
ported and risk-driven proactive investment 
in critical infrastructure cyber resilience; 
(10) Congress has worked diligently to es-
tablish the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency, creating a new agency that 
can leverage broad authorities to receive and 
share information, provide technical assist-
ance to operators, and partner with stake-
holders across the executive branch, State 
and local communities, and the private sec-
tor; 
(11) the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency requires strengthening in 
its mission to ensure the national resilience 
of critical infrastructure, promote a more se-
cure cyber ecosystem, and serve as the cen-
tral coordinating element to support and in-
tegrate Federal, State, local, and private- 
sector cybersecurity efforts; and 
(12) the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency requires further resource 
investment and clear authorities to realize 
its full potential. 
(b) AMENDMENTS.—Subtitle A of title XXII 
of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 
U.S.C. 651 et seq.) is amended— 
(1) in section 2202(c) (6 U.S.C. 652(c))— 
(A) in paragraph (11), by striking ‘‘and’’ at 
the end; 
(B) in the first paragraph designated as 
paragraph (12), relating to the Cybersecurity 
State Coordinator— 
(i) by striking ‘‘section 2215’’ and inserting 
‘‘section 2217’’; and 
(ii) by striking ‘‘and’’ at the end; and 
(C) by redesignating the second and third 
paragraphs designated as paragraph (12) as 
paragraphs (13) and (14), respectively; 
(2) by redesignating section 2218, as added 
by section 70612 of this Act, as section 2220A; 
(3) by redesignating section 2217 (6 U.S.C. 
665f) as section 2220; 
(4) by redesignating section 2216 (6 U.S.C. 
665e) as section 2219; 
(5) by redesignating the fourth section 2215 
(relating to Sector Risk Management Agen-
cies) (6 U.S.C. 665d) as section 2218; 
(6) by redesignating the third section 2215 
(relating to the Cybersecurity State Coordi-
nator) (6 U.S.C. 665c) as section 2217; 
(7) by redesignating the second section 2215 
(relating to the Joint Cyber Planning Office) 
(6 U.S.C. 665b) as section 2216; and 
(8) by adding at the end the following:

social and economic justice and is worth pur-
