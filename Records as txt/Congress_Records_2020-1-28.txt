WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, JANUARY 28, 2020 
No. 18 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-

DESIGNATION OF SPEAKER PRO 
TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
January 28, 2020. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable G.K. 
BUTTERFIELD to act as Speaker pro tempore 
on this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives.

MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the order of the House of Janu-
ary 7, 2020, the Chair will now recog-
nize Members from lists submitted by 
the majority and minority leaders for 
morning-hour debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m.

QUESTIONS TO THE SENATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. And still I rise, 
Mr. Speaker, and I rise today because I 
have a question. I have a question for 
posterity. I have a question for those 
who reside and dwell within the Sen-
ate. I have a question, but I also have 
a predicate for the question. 
The predicate is this: Knowing what 
you know, knowing that the National 
Security Advisor was in the room with 
the President, knowing that he has in-
dicated that there were concerns with-
in him with reference to the Presi-
dent’s dealings with other countries, 
heads of state, knowing that he took 
his consternation to the Attorney Gen-
eral of the United States of America, 
knowing that the Attorney General ex-
pressed some concerns as well, knowing 
what you know, that the National Se-
curity Advisor, not just another person 
in the room but the person who advises 
the President on concerns with ref-
erence to our security, knowing this, 
how can you possibly thwart efforts to 
have the National Security Advisor 
give testimony before the Senate in the 
impeachment trial? 
I have another question. This ques-
tion is one for eternity. 
Knowing that the hands of history 
are writing your legacy, knowing that 
future generations, that your grand-
children, that the people who will look 
to you for leadership will read what the 
hands of history will record, knowing 
that history will afford you the oppor-
tunity to be on the right side, the right 
side of history, how can you possibly 
decide that you will conduct yourself 
in a trial for the ages such that history 
will record that you were on the wrong 
side of history? 
My dear friends, this is bigger than 
you. It is bigger than all of us. This is 
about the country we love and govern-
ment we have. 
We have a great opportunity to do 
justice in the Senate, and the only way 
we can do justice is to have witnesses 
testify. 
I said before that I believe that there 
would be 51 Senators who would vote to 
have witnesses. Today, I am absolutely 
confident that there will be 51 or more 
Senators who will move to have wit-
nesses present themselves and give tes-
timony. To do otherwise would allow 
the greatest country in the world to 
have history record that, when we had 
the opportunity to stand up for the 
Constitution, some of us turned our 
backs and looked the other way. 
This is your time, Senate. This is 
your time, Members of the great delib-
erative body. I beg that you will do 
what you must and have witnesses 
present themselves so that we will 
have history record that we did the 
right and just thing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARSON of Indiana). Members are re-
minded to address their remarks to the 
Chair, not to a perceived viewing audi-
ence. 
f 
NAVIGABLE WATERS PROTECTION 
RULE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, last week, I had the pleas-
ure of joining the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency and the Army Corps of 
Engineers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 
for an event announcing NWPA, or the 
Navigable Waters Protection Rule, a 
rule that will replace the flawed 2015 
WOTUS, Waters of the United States 
rule. 
For decades, there has been confusion 
and 
never-ending 
litigation 
over 
WOTUS. During my time as chairman 
of the House Agriculture Committee’s 
Conservation 
and 
Forestry 
Sub-
committee, which included watersheds 
and oversees environmental policy re-
garding agriculture, I heard from many 
farmers and ranchers, landowners, and 
environmental advocates about just 
how harmful WOTUS was to their busi-
nesses and to their way of life. 
WOTUS was a gross overreach and 
particularly dangerous for the agri-
culture industry, as vast new areas of 
farmlands would be subject to the 
Clean Water Act and costly new per-
mitting mandates for the very first 
time, even beyond our farms and 
ranches. Anyone who owned any prop-
erty, private property rights would be

regulated. 
Ninety-nine 
percent 
of 
Pennsylvania was swept under these 
overreaching WOTUS regulations. 
In addition to taking away States’ 
authority to manage water resources, 
the 2015 WOTUS rule expanded the 
Clean Water Act far beyond the law’s 
historical limits of navigable waters 
and the long-held intent of Congress. 
Instead of providing much-needed clar-
ity to the Clean Water Act, WOTUS 
created even more confusion. 
Thankfully, the negative impact of 
WOTUS was brought to an end when 
the Trump administration repealed it 
this past fall. 
I support the Clean Water Act, and I 
agree that it must be clarified. How-
ever, this must be done without undue 
burdens on farmers, landowners, pri-
vate property owners, and commercial 
activities that are already effectively 
regulated by the States. 
Times have been very tough over the 
past decade for many farmers in rural 
areas. An average farm income was 
nearly halved during that period. Regu-
latory 
uncertainty—notably, 
the 
former WOTUS rule—only made things 
more difficult. 
I am confident, however, that the 
new Navigable Waters Protection Rule 
is a step in the right direction and will 
address many of the regulatory gray 
areas that WOTUS did not. This new 
rule clearly defines four commonsense 
categories 
of 
Federal 
waters 
that 
would be regulated, while providing 
clarity on what is not regulated. This 
includes ditches, isolated ponds, and 
prior converted croplands. 
The Navigable Waters Protection 
Rule will still support strong water 
protections without compromising the 
rights of States and without unneces-
sary burdens to the agriculture indus-
try. 
With clearly defined State and Fed-
eral regulations, our Nation’s farmers 
can continue to focus on what they 
provide all of us: food, fiber, building 
materials, and energy that we all rely 
upon. 
f 
HONORING THE GREENSBORO 
FOUR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to join my colleague from 
North Carolina, Congresswoman ALMA 
ADAMS, as we introduce a resolution 
recognizing the significance of the 
Greensboro Four sit-in protest which 
took place on February 1, 1960, 60 years 
ago. 
The Greensboro, North Carolina, sit- 
in was a civil rights protest that com-
menced 
when 
four 
young 
African 
American college students staged a sit- 
in at the segregated lunch counter of 
F. W. Woolworth department store in 
Greensboro. They refused to leave after 
being denied service only because of 
their race. 
The four young men—Ezell Blair, Jr.; 
David Richmond; Franklin McCain; 
and 
Joseph 
McNeil—were 
students 
from North Carolina A&T College, now 
known as North Carolina A&T State 
University. I might add that A&T 
State University is now the largest 
HBCU in the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I would also mention 
that Congresswoman ALMA ADAMS is a 
graduate of A&T State University and 
served as a college professor across the 
street at Bennett College for more than 
40 years. 
The Greensboro Four students were 
influenced by the unanimous Supreme 
Court decision in Brown v. Board of 
Education, 1954, wherein the Court 
ruled that State laws establishing ra-
cial segregation in public schools are 
unconstitutional even if the segregated 
schools are otherwise equal. 
The students were also influenced by 
the Supreme Court decision in Keys v. 
Carolina Coach Company, 1955, where-
in, the Court broke with its historic 
adherence to the Plessy v. Ferguson 
separate but equal doctrine and inter-
preted the Interstate Commerce Act as 
banning the segregation of Black pas-
sengers on buses traveling across State 
lines. The Keys case originated at the 
bus station in Roanoke Rapids, North 
Carolina, located in the heart of my 
congressional district. 
The Keys ruling was announced 6 
days prior to Rosa Parks’ refusal to 
move from her seat on a segregated bus 
in Montgomery. And without question, 
the Rosa Parks Montgomery bus boy-
cott, lasting 381 days, also inspired the 
Greensboro Four students. 
The students were also inspired to 
act following the 1955 brutal lynching 
of Emmett Till after he was accused of 
offending a White woman in a Mis-
sissippi grocery store. 
These four college students blazed a 
trail that ignited a movement to chal-
lenge racial segregation in public fa-
cilities 
throughout 
the 
segregated 
South. 
The 
sit-in 
movement 
soon 
spread to college towns throughout the 
South. 
The Greensboro Four sit-ins contrib-
uted greatly to the civil rights move-
ment and served as a catalyst for the 
mobilization of college students in the 
movement, evolving into the formation 
of the Student Nonviolent Coordi-
nating Committee, which was founded 
in Raleigh, North Carolina, in April 
1960. Some of the organizers of SNCC 
were Congressman JOHN LEWIS, Con-
gressman JIM
CLYBURN, and Diane 
Nash. 
Nationwide participation in this new 
movement included over 700,000 people, 
including 
students, 
clergymen, 
and 
unified citizens, both Black and White. 
Many of the protestors, more than 
3,000, were arrested for trespassing, dis-
orderly conduct, or disturbing the 
peace. 
However, the Greensboro Four re-
mained 
peaceful 
throughout 
the 
6-month sit-in, and their actions made 
an immediate and lasting impact, forc-
ing Woolworth’s and other establish-
ments to change their discriminatory 
policies. On July 26, 1960, the Wool-
worth’s lunch counter was finally inte-
grated. Today, the former Woolworth’s 
now houses the International Civil 
Rights Center and Museum, which fea-
tures a restored version of the lunch 
counter where the Greensboro Four 
sat. Part of the original counter is on 
display at the Smithsonian National 
Museum of American History here in 
Washington. 
On Saturday of this week, February 
1, the museum will commemorate the 
60th anniversary of this historic event 
at 
the 
Greensboro 
Coliseum. 
Past 
award recipients have been numerous. 
They include Oprah Winfrey; Jesse 
Jackson, 
Sr.; 
President 
Nelson 
Mandela; and many, many others. 
The award recipients this year will 
be: President Barack Obama, the Rev-
erend Al Sharpton, Danny Glover, Mrs. 
Clayola 
Brown, 
Reverend 
Cardes 
Brown, Dr. Linda Brown, and Mrs. 
Emma Washington. 
Mr. Speaker, the resolution that Ms. 
ADAMS and I introduce seeks to encour-
age all of the States to include in their 
educational curriculum the history and 
contributions of the Greensboro Four. 
It is imperative that we learn the les-
sons from the past and reaffirm that 
the ethnic and racial diversity of our 
country enriches our Nation. 
We are always stronger together. We 
must never forget, in all things, to de-
mand justice and equality for all. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the 
Greensboro Four. I congratulate the 
International Museum, and I look for-
ward to participating in the great gala 
they will have this weekend in Greens-
boro.

NAVIGABLE WATERS PROTECTION 
RULE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to commend 
President Trump for providing much- 
needed relief and regulatory clarity 
through the enactment of the Navi-
gable Waters Protection Rule. 
Under the Obama administration, in 
an era rife with government overreach 
and constricting regulations, our Na-
tion’s hardworking farmers were sub-
jected 
to 
regulations—specifically, 
under the Waters of the United States 
rule—that impeded on their businesses 
and their livelihoods. 
Instead of enacting meaningful envi-
ronmental protections and returning 
power back to State, local, and munic-
ipal governments, WOTUS put govern-
ment overreach in the express lane. 
Farmers were forced to hire expensive 
attorneys to define which bodies of 
water on their properties were subject 
to Federal regulations. 
The most concerning part is that 
bodies of water such as small ponds,

ditches, drains, and even areas of dry 
land were subject to these regulations. 
b 1015 
Sadly, this is just another textbook 
example of the types of government 
overreach that must be eliminated. 
Thanks to the Navigable Waters Pro-
tection Rule, erroneous, misguided reg-
ulations enacted by the Obama admin-
istration are finally repealed. Hard-
working Americans will once again 
have the freedom to compete within 
the marketplace, spur innovation, and 
create lasting value. 
Under this rule, regulatory certainty 
will be returned to farmers, land-
owners, and manufacturers; the laws 
and specific powers that the Federal 
Government has been given under the 
Constitution and the Clean Water Act 
will be respected; and the relationship 
between the Federal Government and 
the State regarding the managing of 
land and water resources will be rebal-
anced. 
By eliminating these constructive 
regulations, 
President 
Trump 
con-
tinues to deliver on his promises to our 
farmers, landowners, and manufactur-
ers. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand 
alongside the President as we support, 
defend, and fight for the men and 
women who provide food, shelter, and 
essential commodities that Americans 
rely on every day. 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL SLAVERY AND HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING PREVENTION MONTH 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, January has been proclaimed 
as National Slavery and Human Traf-
ficking Prevention Month. 
These appalling criminal acts not 
only tear at the fabric of our society, 
but they also reflect a blatant dis-
regard for the sanctity of human life. 
Though human trafficking is often a 
hidden crime, its effects are far-reach-
ing. It is estimated that over 25 million 
people—children and adults around the 
world—are victims of both human traf-
ficking and slavery. Traffickers rob 
victims of their freedom, split families 
apart, and impose sizeable threats to 
communities. 
Let’s be clear. We must remain re-
lentless in our fight to end these abhor-
rent crimes. We must all work together 
to protect and support survivors, pros-
ecute 
those 
responsible, 
and 
proactively foster a culture of justice 
and accountability for these crimes. 
f 
ACT ON PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to talk about the healthcare crisis that 
we have in America today—primarily, 
the physician shortage that exists 
throughout the entire United States. It 
is a crisis that we must do something 
about. 
In the next 15 years, the United 
States is expected to face a shortfall of 
over 4,000 primary care physicians 
alone. Rural and low-income commu-
nities, many of which I represent, are 
expected to feel the brunt of this short-
age, communities such as those in Cali-
fornia, like the San Joaquin Valley. 
The San Joaquin Valley has the low-
est number of physicians in the State, 
approximately 0.9 physicians per 1,000 
people. That is less than one. The 
statewide average is 2.2 physicians for 
every 1,000 people, which is twice as 
many. 
Last week, I introduced legislation to 
help tackle this crisis. The Expanding 
Medical Education Act of 2020 will pro-
vide over $200 million in funding to pro-
mote medical training in areas of high 
need throughout the country, like the 
San Joaquin Valley, with a focus on di-
verse and medically deprived commu-
nities. 
We have Governor Gavin Newsom’s 
and our local legislators’ support on 
this legislation. Medical institutions, 
such as the University of California, 
San Francisco, have used funding from 
this effort to train and develop home-
grown physicians under the residency 
program for 45 years in the valley and 
throughout the State. It is very impor-
tant. 
We have discovered that when you 
train 
physicians 
locally, 
residents, 
they are more inclined to practice in 
that area—in our case, in the valley— 
and bring healthcare to our commu-
nities. 
Studies consistently show that stu-
dents who can find quality education 
near their homes and families will be 
more likely to stay there after gradua-
tion. It is just common sense. 
Growing our own doctors is essential 
to confronting this medical crisis, and 
I will continue to fight for every dollar 
to ensure that our valley residents 
have 
access 
to 
the 
necessary 
healthcare that they deserve. 
RECOGNIZING TOM FLORES 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I also rise 
today to recognize the career of Tom 
Flores, a trailblazer in the Latino/His-
panic 
communities 
in 
professional 
football. It is appropriate. With the 
Super Bowl coming up this Sunday, I 
can’t think of a better time to do it. 
A native of my hometown, Fresno, 
California, Tom Flores was a gifted 
athlete, both in high school and col-
lege, and, later, in professional foot-
ball. He played for the Oakland Raid-
ers, becoming the first Hispanic start-
ing quarterback in professional foot-
ball. 
Tom’s success didn’t stop there. 
After ending his playing career, he 
went on to win Super Bowl XI as the 
assistant coach for the Raiders in 1977. 
Then, 4 years later, he again led the 
team to victory as head coach, becom-
ing the first Hispanic coach to win a 
Super Bowl, both in 1980 and in 1983. He 
won it twice. 
To this day, he is one of only two 
people in history to win multiple Super 
Bowls as a player, an assistant coach, 
and a head coach. Mike Ditka is the 
only other coach who falls in that cat-
egory. 
Tom Flores is terrific. He left profes-
sional football with a record of 97 wins 
and 87 losses as head coach, including a 
playoff record of 8 wins and 3 losses, in-
cluding a stint as head coach and gen-
eral manager of the Seattle Seahawks. 
Since retiring, Tom Flores has used 
his influence to bring educational op-
portunities to the valley, his home, a 
place he has never, ever forgotten, 
through the Tom Flores Youth Foun-
dation effort. Over the years, he has 
raised nearly $2 million to support 
local school districts in science, art, 
and athletic programs. 
Sadly, Tom Flores was short of the 
required votes needed for induction 
into the Professional Football Hall of 
Fame, and this is not the first time he 
has been passed over. 
This week, I am introducing a resolu-
tion calling for the recognition of his 
significant accomplishments in the 
sport and his induction into the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame—well deserved 
and overdue. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation and honor the 
invaluable contributions that Coach 
Tom Flores has made to his commu-
nity, to his country, and to America’s 
game. 
We have the Super Bowl this Sunday. 
We will all be watching it, I am sure. I 
know Tom Flores will be. He deserves 
to be in the national Pro Football Hall 
of Fame at Canton, Ohio. I can’t think 
of anyone more deserving than Coach 
Tom Flores. 
f 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
DAVID GLASS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to remember the life of David 
Glass. 
David was born in 1935 and grew up in 
Mountain View, Missouri. He joined 
the U.S. Army after high school and 
then earned a degree at Missouri State. 
He started a career in business, eventu-
ally making his way to Arkansas. 
He was hired by the famous Sam Wal-
ton in 1976 as the chief financial officer 
for Walmart, a young discount retailer 
at the time. Nobody knew then that his 
hiring would transform the company. 
An entrepreneur in his own right, 
David helped further unleash the po-
tential of the organization. Under his 
leadership, Walmart grew exponen-
tially and transformed from a rural 
chain into the international business 
we all know today. 
After succeeding Sam Walton as the 
chief executive officer of the company, 
he led the building of supercenters, in-
troduced the sale of grocery items, 
helped develop automated distribution 
centers, and increased international 
acquisitions and operations. He ad-
vanced the company into the future 
while maintaining the founding prin-
ciples of his predecessor, Sam Walton.

He would never admit it, but much of 
the success of Walmart and the growth 
of our region is a reflection of the work 
of David Glass. 
His business expertise was rivaled 
only by his love of baseball. He fa-
mously helped keep the Kansas City 
Royals franchise from leaving Kansas 
City in 1993. Under his ownership, the 
team saw two American League pen-
nants and a World Series trophy in 
2015. His passion for the sport, the 
team, and the city helped bring success 
on the field. 
Whether in Arkansas or Kansas City, 
the contributions of David Glass will 
long be remembered. I had the privi-
lege of knowing him, not only as an ac-
complished businessman and a novel 
thinker, but as a friend. 
I hope you will join me in celebrating 
his life, in praying for his wife, Ruth, 
and his children, Dan, Don, Dayna, and 
their families during the time of his 
passing. 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF 
FORREST WOOD 
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and legacy 
of a legend in Arkansas business, the 
founder of Ranger Boats, the late For-
rest Wood. 
Forrest was born in Flippin, Arkan-
sas, in 1932, and his life reflected every-
thing the Natural State has to offer. As 
a pioneer with a love for the outdoors, 
Forrest spent his time raising cattle 
and acting as a guide on Bull Shoals 
Lake, the White River, the Buffalo 
River, and Crooked Creek. 
He became known throughout the re-
gion as an elite fishing guide. He even-
tually leveraged his skills on the water 
to create a float trip business, and in 
1968, he began building lake boats. 
That year, he built six boats. Named 
after the Army Rangers and the Texas 
Rangers, Forrest Woods’ Ranger Boats 
quickly became a household name in 
America. 
He soon went from producing 6 to 600, 
and his novel concept became the mod-
ern bass boat that we know today. For-
rest’s ingenuity and vision transformed 
the boating and fishing industry across 
our Nation. 
No one I know has loved or served 
Arkansas’ great outdoors more than 
Forrest Wood. Whether as an entre-
preneur, instructor, or former chair-
man of the Arkansas Game and Fish 
Commission, he was committed to en-
suring people enjoy the outdoors for 
generations to come. 
He will forever be remembered as a 
legend in the fishing industry, and I be-
lieve his biggest asset was his redeem-
ing personality. A loyal friend, mentor, 
and dedicated family man, his genuine 
smile and caring nature will be sorely 
missed. 
Mr. Speaker, as he is laid to rest this 
week, I ask that we keep his wife, 
Nina, and the entire Wood family in 
our prayers. 
ADDRESS DETROIT BULK 
STORAGE COLLAPSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, on 
November 26, 2019, during the Thanks-
giving holiday, a dock piled with ag-
gregates collapsed into the Detroit 
River. 
Local and State authorities were 
slow to communicate with each other, 
and misinformation quickly spread. 
Concerns 
about 
polluted 
drinking 
water, even radioactive contamination, 
caused confusion and concern in my 
district. Many of us learned about the 
collapse from a Canadian newspaper, 
which published an article days after 
the collapse. 
Over 2 months later, the site con-
tinues to deteriorate. The shoreline 
continues to erode, and contaminated 
soil is still spilling into the water. 
More recently, a sinkhole developed at 
the site, discharging even more con-
taminants into the water. 
The area’s long-serving industrial 
history was another source of concern 
for public health and the environment. 
During the 1940s and the 1950s, the site 
produced uranium for the development 
of the atomic bomb. 
Recently, the site has been leased to 
companies openly storing toxic chemi-
cals and piles of aggregates along the 
water. 
Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed in 
the site owner’s lack of urgency to 
quickly 
fix 
this 
problem. 
Over 
2 
months later, aggregate is still spilling 
into the water. The owners have failed 
to address the erosion and, now, the 
emerging sinkhole. 
Mr. Speaker, I join with the EPA and 
the Michigan Department of Environ-
mental, Great Lakes, and Energy, or 
EGLE, to hold this owner accountable 
to the fullest extent possible. 
b 1030 
The owner has missed key deadlines 
to submit cleanup plans and, so far, 
their proposals don’t even come close 
to stopping the erosion. If it is the re-
sponsibility of the violators to clean up 
their mess, how do we know they will 
do it properly and efficiently? 
I expect our State and Federal agen-
cies to continue to take action to safe-
guard our public health. They are con-
tinuing to test the surrounding area 
for contamination and are regularly 
updating my office with test results. 
The risks to our public health cannot 
be dismissed. My constituents have 
witnessed how government action can 
help or hurt our communities. 
We cannot forget the Flint water cri-
sis. We witnessed a failure of govern-
ment. Just last year, the Detroit Pub-
lic Schools shut off its drinking foun-
tains after finding elevated lead and 
copper. In the last year, Michigan has 
led the Nation in active PFAS sites, 
drawing national attention to the ef-
forts of these ‘‘forever chemicals’’ in 
our waters. 
We cannot—and I will fight to make 
sure we do not—repeat the Flint water 
crisis. We must learn from our mis-
takes. This situation demands a sense 
of urgency to restore the public’s faith 
in our government to protect them 
from being contaminated by water. 
This is why I am continuing to mon-
itor the ongoing cleanup and remedi-
ation of the collapsed site. While the 
latest test results showed no signifi-
cant threat to the public health, I will 
work with the State to ensure the 
site’s cleanup and urge the State to 
push for a third-party independent 
study. We have the right to know that 
the surrounding water and the environ-
ment is safe from contaminants. 
I will also remain in communication 
to ensure the drinking water in Michi-
gan and—also with government over-
sight—that we in America have safe, 
clean water, and we must continue the 
fight for affordable water. 
If there is a threat to our public 
health, the government has a responsi-
bility to safeguard our constituents 
from harm.

OUR RESPONSE TO THE 
CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, with 
more than 4,500 people confirmed in-
fected in China, and over 100 deaths, 
the coronavirus certainly has my at-
tention. But as the outbreak of the 
coronavirus strain originating in China 
continues, I want to remind Kansans 
that U.S. health officials remain on 
high alert and are fully prepared for 
any situation. 
The Centers for Disease Control cur-
rently has teams on the ground, both 
domestically and internationally. Do-
mestically, the CDC is working closely 
with local public health departments 
to identify potential cases early and 
make sure patients get the best and 
most appropriate care. To control the 
spread of the outbreak, the CDC has 
preventive 
screening 
measures 
in 
major U.S. airports. 
Last year, President Trump signed 
into law the reauthorization of the 
Pandemic and All-Hazards Prepared-
ness Innovation Act. This bill has been 
critical for improving preparedness and 
response, and bolstering the emergency 
response workforce, as well as increas-
ing communication and efforts in med-
ical countermeasures. 
The administration has also consist-
ently prioritized funding to build on in-
vestments to protect the civilian popu-
lation in the event of public health 
emergencies related to infectious dis-
ease outbreaks. 
As a physician, I understand the un-
certainty and fear infectious disease 
outbreaks can have. But first, I want to 
encourage 
Kansans 
to 
follow 
rec-
ommendations from your own doctor. 
And if you have any concern about the 
situation, you should call your doctor’s

nurse and talk to them about the situ-
ation and your concerns. 
But all that being said, I might offer 
these tips: First of all, make sure you 
have gotten your flu shot. Now, the flu 
shot 
won’t 
protect 
you 
from 
a 
coronavirus, but it is a much bigger 
threat to you right now than the 
coronavirus is. 
Children, pregnant women, and our 
senior citizens, who are most suscep-
tible to viruses should avoid public 
places where exposure risk is high. 
Thorough handwashing is a great 
best practice as we continue to work 
through the flu and cold season. 
And, finally, follow the CDC and 
State Department’s recommendations 
regarding travel to China. 
If you are at all concerned about any 
symptoms you are experiencing, espe-
cially if you are having new onset of 
wheezing or shortness of breath, you 
should contact your primary care doc-
tor. 
Now, thus far, only 5 cases have been 
confirmed in the United States, and all 
cases include recent travel to China. 
While testing can now only be done at 
the CDC, we hope that a commercially- 
available test will soon be available in 
February, which will help us contain 
and monitor this virus. 
These global outbreaks impact us 
here at home, and that is why we re-
spond to infectious disease outbreaks 
with urgency and as a global commu-
nity. Efforts by President Trump and 
this administration have ensured our 
health agencies have the funding and 
resources necessary to combat out-
breaks and protect Kansans. 
I am confident in the measures being 
taken by our national healthcare offi-
cials and agencies, as well as by our 
local health departments, our local 
doctors, nurses, and our local hos-
pitals. 
NEW NAVIGABLE WATERS PROTECTION 
REGULATIONS 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, last 
Friday, I was honored to join EPA Re-
gion 7 Administrator Jim Gulliford at 
the Kansas Commodity Classic in Man-
hattan, Kansas, to announce the EPA’s 
new Navigable Waters Protection Rule. 
The rule provides a clear definition of 
Waters of the United States, otherwise 
known as WOTUS, delivering on Presi-
dent Trump’s promise to cut burden-
some regulations and slash bureau-
cratic red tape to empower farmers, 
ranchers, builders, small businesses, 
and other landowners. 
Kansas farmers and ranchers are the 
original and best conservationists in 
the world, and I have heard from them 
about this issue since I came into of-
fice. This new rule will tremendously 
reduce the burden on Kansans who 
work in dairy, cattle, and crop oper-
ations, and allow them to implement 
conservation methods without Federal 
overreach. 
The EPA’s new Navigable Waters 
Protection Rule will continue to pro-
tect our environment without stifling 
economic growth and rebalance the re-
lationship between the Federal Govern-
ment and States in managing our land 
and water resources. 
The Navigable Waters Protection 
Rule ends decades of uncertainty over 
where Federal jurisdiction begins and 
ends. It also ensures that America’s 
water protections, among the best in 
the world, remain strong, while giving 
our States and Tribes more flexibility 
in determining how best to manage 
their land and water resources to pro-
tect the environment and local econo-
mies. 
Go Chiefs.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF CONSTER DAVIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CLOUD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Ms. Conster Davis and 
to wish her a very happy 100th birth-
day. 
Ms. Davis is a citizen of south Texas 
whose life has been characterized by a 
servant-hearted desire to help others 
and to work hard. 
During World War II, she drove rivets 
into airplane wings, playing her part, 
along with countless other American 
women, in the war effort. 
Today, at 100 years old, she spends 
her time supporting the students and 
staff at Galvan Elementary School in 
Corpus Christi, Texas, where she is af-
fectionately known as Granny Davis. 
She mentors the pre-K students and 
helps teachers with clerical work. She 
also served as a Senior Corps Foster 
Grandparent for 25 years, mentoring 
young people and pouring into them 
during some of the most formative 
years of their lives. 
Ms. Davis loves caring for young peo-
ple and shows it by investing much of 
her time and energy into the children 
of Corpus Christi. 
It is difficult to imagine the tremen-
dous impact Ms. Conster Davis has had 
in living a life of service that continues 
today to impact generation after gen-
eration. 
On behalf of the people of the 27th 
Congressional District of Texas, I am 
proud to honor her life and service. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF JAKE GODBOLD 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. RUTHERFORD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the memory of 
Mayor Jake Godbold, who served the 
city of Jacksonville from 1978 to 1987 
and, sadly, passed away last week. 
Mayor Godbold, or simply ‘‘Jake,’’ as 
we all called him, was a man of the 
highest integrity whose contributions 
to northeast Florida are seemingly in-
finite. 
One thing I will always remember 
about Jake was that when he spoke to 
you, he made you feel as though you 
were the only person in the room. I re-
call fondly my first interaction with 
the Mayor occurred actually when I 
was a young patrolman on the north 
side of Jacksonville. And as an officer, 
I soon learned every time the Mayor 
saw a police officer or a firefighter, he 
would stop whatever he was doing and 
would take the time to speak with that 
officer or that firefighter. 
Jake loved our policemen, our fire-
men, and our city, and they all loved 
him back. He will be dearly missed. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF ROBERT 
SHIRCLIFF 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of Mr. Robert Shircliff of Jacksonville. 
Bob lived his Christian faith and was 
well-known for his giving and loving 
character. His extraordinary contribu-
tions and service to our country and 
local community are truly legendary. 
Deeply beloved by the people of Jack-
sonville, Mr. Shircliff passed away last 
week at the age of 91. 
He served on the boards of numerous 
civic groups, such as the Community 
Foundation and led countless efforts to 
support institutions like St. Vincent’s 
HealthCare, 
the 
Jacksonville 
Sym-
phony, United Way, and the Cummer 
Art Museum, just to name a few. 
Despite his success, he remained 
humble and grateful to those around 
him. He once said, ‘‘I’ve tried coming 
into the office on Saturdays and chang-
ing the world, and I can’t do it. But if 
I come in on Monday, and I’m sur-
rounded by really good people, any-
thing can happen.’’ 
On behalf of the Fourth District of 
Florida, I want to offer my condolences 
to the many friends and loved ones of 
Mr. Shircliff. His service, generosity, 
and leadership has made northeast 
Florida a better place to live, work, 
and play. 
And since Bob’s arrival, heaven is 
truly a better place.

SUPPORTING CHILD NUTRITION 
RULEMAKING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. COMER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to applaud the Trump adminis-
tration’s recent proposed rulemaking 
for school meals and the Summer Food 
Service Program. 
As a member of the Agriculture Com-
mittee, and ranking member on the 
Education and Labor Subcommittee 
with jurisdiction over the child nutri-
tion programs, I have consistently 
heard from school food service admin-
istrators in my district about their 
frustrations 
with 
the 
heavyhanded 
Obama-era regulations. 
I am glad to see the administration is 
seeking input from those who admin-
ister these programs every day. This 
new rule will provide needed flexibility 
for food service supervisors to adapt 
their menus to teach students proper

UPDATES ON AGRICULTURE AND THE TRADE WAR 
WITH CHINA 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I think 
most people in this body know that I 
am a farmer by trade, and I represent 
a southern Kentucky district that is 
one of the biggest agricultural districts 
in America. 
I am very pleased today to give an 
update on the accomplishments that 
the Trump administration and Con-
gress has made over the past 3 years 
with respect to agriculture. 
Anyone that keeps up with President 
Trump knows that he sincerely cares 
about the farmers in America; and he 
realizes that the farmers, through no 
fault of their own, have been on the 
front lines of this trade war with 
China. 
But if you talk to any farmer, as I do 
on a regular basis when I am home in 
Kentucky, the farmers still strongly 
support the President and they under-
stand why we are in this trade war. 
They also understand the efforts that 
have been made and the accomplish-
ments that have been achieved with re-
spect to agriculture from this adminis-
tration and from this Congress over the 
past 3 years. 
I want to touch on three areas where 
we focused in Congress, where I focused 
as a member of the Agriculture Com-
mittee, to improve our agriculture for 
our family farmers who are struggling, 
again, on the front lines of this trade 
war with China. 
First of all, regulations. As with 
many other industries in America, one 
of the first things that President 
Trump looked at, and then the Repub-
licans and the majority of this body 
looked at 3 years ago, was the regula-
tions. Many industries, especially in 
agriculture, felt like there were bur-
densome regulations that were holding 
farmers 
back, 
holding 
agriculture 
back. 
So, one by one, this administration, 
whether it was through the U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture, or the EPA, 
has looked at every regulation to deem 
whether that regulation was necessary, 
or whether that regulation was exces-
sive and needed to be scaled back. 
b 1045 
I am very pleased to report that the 
biggest regulation that scared most 
people in agriculture was the WOTUS 
rule from the Obama administration. I 
am very pleased, last week, this admin-
istration completely eliminated the 
WOTUS rule with respect to navigable 
streams. Under the Obama regulation, 
every mud puddle in Kentucky would 
have been defined as a navigable 
stream, therefore, creating a situation 
where farmers would be breaking the 
law to farm the land that they farmed 
for many generations. 
Next is tax policy. We focused very 
heavily on passing the Tax Cuts and 
Jobs Act, which helped cut taxes over-
all, but one thing that helped agri-
culture is the accelerated depreciation 
rule, which encouraged farmers to 
make a bigger investment. 
And, lastly, trade. We have had huge 
success on the trade front over the past 
couple of weeks here in Washington, 
and I applaud the Trump administra-
tion for their efforts to not only sign 
the USMCA, which is the new modern 
NAFTA deal that puts workers on a 
level playing field in America with 
workers in Mexico and Canada, but it 
also enhances agriculture opportuni-
ties. 
Also, the phase one trade deal that 
the President signed recently with 
China, this focuses on agriculture. It 
brings back those markets that we lost 
in agriculture because we were on the 
front lines of this trade war, and it also 
increases new markets for agriculture. 
I am very pleased with the achieve-
ments that have been made in agri-
culture, but I realize that our farmers 
are struggling and we have a lot more 
work to do. I pledge to continue to 
work with the Trump administration 
to see that our farmers are treated 
fairly and that we can continue to 
grow our Nation’s most important in-
dustry: agriculture.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
PHILIP M. VAN HOY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to honor the memory of 
Philip M. Van Hoy of Charlotte, who 
passed away unexpectedly Saturday 
morning. 
Phil was a preeminent attorney, a 
mentor to a generation of conserv-
atives, and a dear friend of 30 years. 
Phil grew up in Charlotte and grad-
uated from Duke University and the 
University of North Carolina Law 
School, but he was a lifelong Duke fan. 
Upon graduation, Phil enlisted in the 
U.S. Army Reserve, eventually leaving 
as a first lieutenant. 
As a lawyer, Phil served Duke Power 
and, in due course, founded the law 
firm Van Hoy, Reutlinger, Adams & 
Dunn, where he handled some of the 
most complex employment cases at 
every 
level, 
including 
the 
United 
States Supreme Court. In 2013 and 2019, 
Phil was named Lawyer of the Year for 
employment law by Best Lawyers in 
America. 
Though Phil was a gifted lawyer, his 
true passion was Republican politics. 
Phil served as vice chairman of the 
Mecklenburg County Republican Party 
and was an alternative delegate to the 
RNC convention that nominated Ron-
ald Reagan. 
But most significantly, Phil was a 
mentor to a generation of conserv-
atives. He organized a lunch that still 
goes on in Charlotte, and they refer to 
it affectionately as the ‘‘Hun Lunch’’; 
although, as Phil was quick to point 
out, Attila the Hun was no conserv-
ative. He was a collectivist. 
Phil welcomed me 30 years ago to the 
Hun Lunch, and it continues weekly 
today. Its members are devastated by 
his loss. 
I am lucky to count Phil as a cher-
ished friend. Friends will remember, 
particularly, his trademark sharp wit, 
the ever-ready joke, and the gleam in 
his eye much more since his untimely 
passing and will remember his con-
sistent kindness and commitment to 
values. 
Jo and I extend our deepest condo-
lences and prayers to Sylvia and their 
two sons, Travis and Marshall. May 
Phil Van Hoy rest in peace. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF TERRY L. HUNT 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of Terry L. Hunt, who passed away this 
weekend while on a business trip to 
Kenya. 
Mr. Hunt was president of Lumbee 
Tribe Enterprises and a valued member 
of the Lumbee Tribe. Terry’s life was 
dedicated to the success of the Lumbee 
people, and his passing represents a 
grave loss. 
Mr. Hunt was a native of the Fair-
mont community in Robeson County, 
North Carolina. Terry graduated from 
Fairmont High School in 1979 and 
served his community as a police offi-
cer with the Fairmont Police Depart-
ment. 
In 1993, Terry rose to the position of 
chief of police and was selected by the 
Attorney General to help shape the na-
tional law enforcement initiative for 
cases of missing children. 
Mr. Hunt was deeply devoted to his 
community, and when he retired from 
law enforcement in 2001, he continued 
his public service. Mr. Hunt rep-
resented his district on the Lumbee 
Tribal Council from 2011 to 2017 and 
was elected as economic development 
chairman, taking an active interest in 
economic affairs of the Lumbee people. 
While Mr. Hunt left us far too young, 
it is altogether fitting that he passed 
while finalizing a new contract for the 
Tribe-owned business that he led. Mr. 
Hunt served his community until the 
very end, a community that is deeply 
mourning his loss. 
Terry’s work will go on, but no one 
will be able to fill his shoes. May his 
love and dedication for his people be an 
example for all of us.

Representatives, made up of these lead-
ers, and to bless their work during to-

fortitude. May they seek Your divine 
wisdom and give You due homage in all 
their deliberations and decisions. May 
they always seek the common good, 
the public benefit, and true justice and 
peace for all. 
We ask all these blessings from You, 
who are the Lord God and the giver of 
life, forever and ever. 
Amen.

WELCOMING REVEREND JEFFREY 
F. KIRBY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) is recognized 
for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, it is 
my honor to recognize and nominate 
today’s guest, Father Jeffrey Kirby, to 
serve as guest chaplain for the noon 
prayer. 
Father Kirby, pastor of Our Lady of 
Grace Parish in South Carolina and the 
adjunct professor of theology at Bel-
mont Abbey College, is a devout fol-
lower of Jesus Christ and lives his life 
as a light unto others. 
Father Kirby received his bachelor of 
arts and master’s degree from Francis-
can University of Steubenville before 
receiving his doctorate in moral the-
ology from Holy Cross University in 
Rome. 
His selflessness led him to enlist in 
the National Guard during his studies, 
and he even served on a relief effort for 
Hurricane Mitch. 
In 2002, he entered seminary in Rome 
and was ordained a Catholic priest. He 
has since served parishes across South 
Carolina, from Clemson to Walhalla to 
Seneca to Columbia and now Lan-
caster. 
Governor Nikki Haley selected him 
in 2016 to receive the Order of the Pal-
metto, our State’s highest civilian 
honor. 
In His word, and one that exemplifies 
Father 
Kirby’s 
life, 
the 
Book 
of 
Malachi 2:7 reads: ‘‘For the lips of a 
priest should guard knowledge, and 
people should seek instruction from his 
mouth, for he is the messenger of the 
Lord of hosts.’’ 
In light of his many years of min-
istry, it is my honor to welcome Fa-
ther Kirby as the guest chaplain of the 
United States House of Representa-
tives.

CALI-
FORNIA 
DISTINGUISHED 
SCHOOLS 
(Mr. CISNEROS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1

marks.) 
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, it is 
with great pride that I rise today to 
honor and congratulate 13 elementary 
schools in California’s 39th District for 
their selection as 2020 California Dis-
tinguished Schools. 
The 39th District elementary schools 
awarded this distinction include: Aca-
cia, Blandford, Buena Terra, Charles G. 
Emery, Golden, Hidden Trails, Killian, 
Laguna Road, Laurel Elementary Mag-
net School of Innovation and Career 
Exploration, Mesa Robles, Robert C. 
Fisler, Wedgeworth, and Ybarra Acad-
emy of Arts and Technology. 
Our students’ success is a testament 
not only to their dedication but also to 
the tireless efforts made by educators, 
administrators, staff, and parents. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and 
my honorable colleagues join me in 
congratulating these 13 California dis-
tinguished schools for their tremen-
dous educational achievements. 
f 
CELEBRATING SCHOOL CHOICE 
(Mr. LAMBORN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise during this week to celebrate 
school choice. 
Americans lose their freedom when 
parents aren’t allowed to decide on 
their own where to send their children 
to school. A one-size-fits-all approach 
doesn’t encourage growth for the next 
generation of Americans. 
In March, the Supreme Court will be 
hearing oral arguments for the case of 
Espinoza v. Montana Department of 
Revenue. The Court’s decision could 
have important ramifications for pub-
lic funding of private and 
public 
schools. 
In my district, I am proud of the 
work being done by Steve and Joyce 
Schuck, 
champions 
of 
the 
school 
choice movement in Colorado. Steven 
Woodford is also doing great work for 
the homeschool communities of Colo-
rado. 
These key leaders in our community 
are enabling students to have edu-
cational opportunities they wouldn’t 
otherwise have. 
Colorado is making great strides in 
the school choice movement, and I am 
proud to represent both the community 
leaders who facilitate it and the tal-
ented students of this generation.

COMMEMORATING TODD PORTUNE

Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, it is 
with a heavy heart that I rise today to 
honor two iconic Cincinnati leaders 
who passed away over the weekend. 
On Saturday, we lost longtime Ham-
ilton County Commissioner and former 
Cincinnati 
City 
Councilman 
Todd 
Portune. 
Todd was a true leader, willing to put 
aside political differences and work to-
gether on issues to benefit our commu-
nity. He was also someone I considered 
not only a respected colleague but a 
friend. 
Then, on Sunday, Cincinnati suffered 
another loss with the passing of Judge 
Nathaniel Jones. 
As a civil rights leader, a Federal 
judge, and a person, Judge Jones was 
one of those rare people who was uni-
versally admired and respected. Having 
worked with Thurgood Marshall on 
Brown v. Board of Education, having 
helped South Africa overcome apart-
heid, and having served as general 
counsel for the NAACP, Judge Jones 
not only improved the lives of people in 
Cincinnati but across the country and, 
in fact, across the globe. 
Madam Speaker, while Cincinnati 
will sorely miss Commissioner Portune 
and Judge Jones, their accomplish-
ments will be felt by our community 
and across our Nation for generations 
to come.

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I have 
a 
question. 
What 
does 
Oscar 
the 
Grouch from Sesame Street have in 
common with the republic of Georgia’s 
oligarch Bidzina Ivanishvili? What do 
they have in common? 
Answer: They are both puppets who 
trash their own home. 
Vladimir Putin’s puppet has attacked 
foreign investment in Georgia and 
crushed basic human rights. 
A company from Texas, Frontera Re-
sources, has been drilling in Georgia 
for years and years and years. They 
have created great jobs in America and 
great jobs in Georgia. They have cre-
ated freedom. That was until the gov-
ernment took over all of their oper-
ations, all of their equipment. Now, 
they are drilling zero wells in Georgia. 
Of course, the Napoleon of Siberia, 
Vladimir Putin, is happy to control 
Georgia’s oil. His puppet, oligarch 
Ivanishvili, is getting rich off the 
backs of the Georgian people. 
It is time to wake up. As this photo 
from Getty shows, the protesters in 
Georgia need our support. Join me in 
raising our voices for freedom in Geor-
gia.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL SCHOOL 
CHOICE WEEK 2020 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
MR. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful to be an 
original cosponsor of H. Res. 814 to des-
ignate January 26 to February 1 as Na-
tional School Choice Week. 
As the husband of a teacher, father of 
four, and grandfather of eight, I appre-
ciate the importance of school choice. 
We must continue to support magnet, 
charter, traditional, public, private, 
and homeschools inspired by Zan Tyler 
across the country. 
Every year, I have the opportunity to 
meet with students and teachers and 
talk to them about their unique edu-
cational experiences and why they 
think school choice is important. I will 
be visiting schools this Friday to renew 
this discussion. 
What we have seen is too many top- 
down mandates from unelected Wash-
ington bureaucrats who do not know 
the needs of students like their par-
ents, teachers, and local school boards 
do. The quality of our children’s edu-
cation is too important to rely on a 
one-size-fits-all approach. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism 
with the courageous leadership of 
President Donald Trump.

SAY NO TO THE PRO ACT 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, as 
part of a productive district work pe-
riod, our team met with job creators 
and employers who are members of the 
Williamsport/Lycoming 
Chamber 
of 
Commerce. 
The topic of discussion was the so- 
called Protecting the Right to Organize 
Act, otherwise known as the PRO Act. 
One thing was clear from these individ-
uals: The PRO Act is a bad bill that has 
too much government interference in 
the employee-employer relationship. 
More than being bad for employers, 
the PRO Act is terrible for workers. 
Cloaked in the language of employee 
protection, the real result of the PRO 
Act is providing workers with fewer 
choices, fewer rights, and an inability 
to speak directly for themselves. 
Our Nation is experiencing the great-
est economy in generations with the 
lowest unemployment rate for all cat-
egories of Americans since I was 4 
years old. Congress should not pass leg-
islation that would slow economic 
growth, stifle job creation, and limit 
workers’ free choice and privacy. Yet, 
that is exactly what the PRO Act 
would do. 
If Congress really cares about jobs, 
the economy, and workers’ rights, it 
should say no to the PRO Act. 
f 
EXTEND RIGHT TO LIFE TO ALL 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, last week marked the 
47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. 
Our Nation’s Founders enshrined in 
the Declaration of Independence that 
all humans are ‘‘endowed by their Cre-
ator with certain unalienable rights, 
that among these are life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness.’’ 
Since that fateful Roe v. Wade deci-
sion, we have denied the first of those 
basic rights, the right to life, to more 
than 60 million unborn children. 
I rise today in opposition to this 
atrocity, and I rise in support of the 
brave individuals who flooded the Na-
tional Mall this past Friday to take 
part in the annual March for Life. 
As long as abortion exists in our 
country, a dark cloud will hang over 
us, but the March for Life makes me 
hopeful that this cloud will not hang 
over us forever. I have great hope that 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness will extend to all Americans born 
and those yet to be born. 
f 
EVIDENCE PERTINENT TO 
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, we 
have gone through and are going 
through a serious time in our country. 
The Senate is engaged, as was said the 
other day, in one of its most important 
duties and responsibilities. 
This weekend, a draft of the upcom-
ing book by President Trump’s former 
National 
Security 
Advisor, 
Ambas-
sador John Bolton, was reported on by 
The New York Times. 
In that book, Ambassador Bolton, 
who was the National Security Advisor 
and foreign policy advisor for President 
Donald Trump, revealed additional evi-
dence pertinent to the impeachment 
trial now underway in the Senate. 
There is strong and direct evidence 
that the President linked critical mili-
tary aid to Ukraine. It is reported that 
so many of his advisers, including Mr. 
Bolton, could not understand that aid 
being withheld to our ally. 
He reveals that the President linked 
that critical military aid to Ukraine to 
the announcement of an investigation 
by President Zelensky, which was in-
tended to benefit President Trump per-
sonally and politically. 
f 
b 1215 
Ambassador Bolton’s book further 
confirms this and reveals that he was 
in the room; not a whistleblower; not 
somebody relying on hearsay, in the 
room with the President, and heard 
him state clearly that the two were 
linked or, said in another way, that 
there was a quid for a quo, as was al-
leged in Article I of the Articles of Im-
peachment. They were linked and that 
congressionally-appropriated military 
aid to Ukraine would not be released 
until President Zelensky responded to 
the President’s personal, political de-
mands. 
Whether you are a lawyer or not, you 
have watched trials on TV, or perhaps 
been a witness in a trial. A trial is to 
examine and weigh the evidence, all 
the relevant evidence. That is the defi-
nition of a fair trial, of a quest for jus-
tice trial, a trial in which the jurors 
are impartial and seeking truth; not a 
trial in which the jurors refuse to hear 
the evidence the prosecution wants to 
submit. 
It is unheard of that a juror would 
say, no, I don’t want to hear that evi-
dence. The juror’s duty is to hear the 
evidence and to seek the truth. And the 
witnesses raise their hand, swear to 
tell the truth, the whole truth, and 
nothing but the truth; the whole truth, 
a key phrase in that witness’ oath. 
That, of course, includes Ambassador 
Bolton’s testimony, the whole truth; 
what he heard directly from the Presi-
dent, as well as others who have first-
hand knowledge of facts relevant to the 
truth or falsity of the allegations; in 
this case, abuse of power and obstruc-
tion of justice. 
And, of course, so many of those wit-
nesses have been ordered by the Presi-
dent not to tell the truth, not to tes-
tify, to fight subpoenas of the Congress 
of the United States. 
A juror cannot be impartial if he or 
she willfully ignores evidence upon 
which the case might turn.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H579 
January 28, 2020 
As a Washington Post editorial stat-
ed powerfully yesterday: 
If Senators fail to summon Bolton, whom 
they were talking about, they will turn the 
Senate trial into a farce. 
I might use the words show trial. We 
are familiar with show trials. Show 
trials are to pretend that you are seek-
ing justice while you exonerate, theo-
retically, a guilty party. 
I will remind Members of the iconic 
Japanese monkeys, the macaques. The 
three of them sit and see no evil, hear 
no evil, speak no evil. I would charac-
terize that as a see no evil, hear no 
evil, speak no truth juror. Keeping 
your eyes shut and ears plugged is re-
fusing to hear, refusing to weigh the 
facts. See no evil, hear no evil, speak 
no truth. 
In the old Supreme Court Chamber, if 
you visit that, you will see Lady Jus-
tice, a statue, with no blindfold. We 
hear that justice is blind. Justice can-
not be blind. Justice must see the 
facts. It must see the equities. It must 
see who said what, when, where, how, 
and make a judgment. 
A great legislator and contemporary 
of our Founders, Edmund Burke, once 
said, ‘‘The only thing necessary for the 
triumph of evil is for good men to do 
nothing.’’ 
This is a serious time in America. We 
will judge whether or not party is 
above 
principle; 
whether 
truth 
is 
trumped by see no evil, hear no evil, 
speak no truth. 
Madam Speaker, I implore the good 
men and women of the United States 
Senate, do not do nothing, which Ed-
mund Burke said was the only thing 
necessary for evil to triumph. Do some-
thing that will secure your place in 
history to be remembered for your 
courage, your honesty, and honoring 
your oath. 
Allow 
witnesses 
like 
Ambassador 
Bolton to be heard. Allow a fair and 
impartial trial. 
Madam Speaker, I believe that is 
what the American people are looking 
for. They are pretty divided on whether 
or not this is an impeachable offense. I 
get that. That is a legitimate argu-
ment to make. 
But what is not legitimate is not to 
listen to the evidence. Senators must 
now do their duty to their oaths, to our 
Constitution, and to its authors, and to 
the cause of truth itself, to allow Am-
bassador Bolton and other witnesses to 
be heard. 
I urge Senators to uncover their 
eyes, uncover their ears. The American 
people and history are waiting to hear 
truth from them. They are waiting for 
the Senate trial to seek the truth, the 
whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

HONORING THE GREENSBORO 
FOUR 
(Ms. ADAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and recognize those 
four young men from North Carolina 
A&T State University who helped bend 
the arc of history towards justice, the 
Greensboro Four. 
On February 1, 1960, 60 years ago this 
upcoming Saturday, David Richmond, 
Franklin McCain, Jibreel Khazan, and 
Joseph McNeil, took their seats at a 
Woolworth lunch counter in Greens-
boro, North Carolina, and changed 
American history forever. And after 
they were refused service, they contin-
ued to sit at that lunch counter until 
the store closed. 
The next day, 12 more students sat at 
that same lunch counter; and by the 
next week, thousands of demonstrators 
began to fight against Jim Crow in 
North Carolina. 
To honor the triumphs of these four 
young men, and to commemorate their 
efforts to make this a more just soci-
ety, I am proud to introduce today, 
with 
my 
colleague, 
Representative 
G.K. BUTTERFIELD, a resolution recog-
nizing the significance of the Greens-
boro Four sit-in. 
May we all continue to live by their 
example as we make this a fairer and 
more equitable America for all that 
call it home.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, on 
Monday, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a rule, House Resolution 811, 
providing for consideration of two 
measures: H.R. 3621, the Comprehensive 
CREDIT Act; and the Senate amend-
ment to H.R. 550. 
The rule provides for consideration of 
H.R. 3621 under a structured rule, with 
1 hour of debate equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and the ranking 
member of the Committee on Financial 
Services. It self-executes Chairwoman 
WATERS’ manager’s amendment, which 
updates definitions, amends require-
ments for issuance of final rules, in-
cludes protections for workers affected 
by a Federal shutdown, and makes 
other technical changes. It also makes 
in order 14 amendments. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of two House amendments to the 
Senate amendment to H.R. 550. The 
rule provides for 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs for each 
House amendment. Finally, the rule 
provides for separate votes on each 
House amendment. 
Madam Speaker, on H.R. 3621, the 
Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020, 
credit scores and credit reports play a 
critical role in determining which of 
our constituents across America will 
be able to pay for college, rent an 
apartment, buy a car or a house, start 
a business, meet major unexpected ex-
penses, or even, increasingly, get a par-
ticular job. 
Most Americans do not have the 
wealth to pay out of pocket for major 
expenditures, so credit is essential; and 
credit scores and credit reports have 
become the key screening and sorting 
mechanism, the key gatekeeper that 
makes the difference for millions of 
Americans between having the money 
to pay for college or not, being able to 
buy a house or rent an apartment or 
not, and, increasingly, qualifying as an 
employee for a specific position or not, 
because so many employers are in-
creasingly using credit scores and cred-
it reports as part of the qualifying 
process for appointing and hiring new 
employees. 
The system of credit scores and cred-
it reports is deeply flawed today, and 
we have done nothing to reform it in 17 
years. The Federal Trade Commission 
tells us that one in five Americans has 
an error on at least one of their credit 
reports, and 5 percent of the people 
have errors grave enough to result in 
their being denied credit or having to 
pay substantially more for their mort-
gages or their auto loans or to obtain 
insurance policies. 
The three big CRAs, consumer re-
porting 
agencies—Equifax, 
TransUnion, and Experian—have files 
on more than 200 million American 
consumers, which means that there are 
errors in the credit reports of at least 
40 million of our constituents and seri-
ous, potentially life-changing errors in 
the credit reports of 10 million Ameri-
cans across the country. 
Correcting these errors often takes 
considerable time and procedural ef-
fort, as well as knowledge on how to 
communicate with the credit reporting 
companies. The Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau, the CFPB, deter-
mined that, in 2018, credit reports were 
the single most complained-about fi-
nancial product in our country, and the 
three big CRAs were the most com-
plained-about financial companies in 
America. 
Many vulnerable populations like 
seniors, stressed and busy working- 
class Americans, and less financially 
literate young Americans describe im-
mense frustration in trying to solve 
problems with credit scoring and re-
porting companies. Even beyond the er-
rors and mistakes, the credit system 
takes advantage of the financially in-
secure and precarious, converting tran-
sitory lapses of poverty into a lifetime 
of financial stigma and hardship. It is 
very expensive to be poor in America. 
Consumers lack the right to a free 
annual credit score. Many consumers 
who try to get a free annual credit re-
port or to obtain their scores get 
tricked into purchasing high-priced 
credit monitoring or subscription serv-
ices. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 3621, the Com-
prehensive CREDIT Act of 2020, com-
prehensively addresses these abuses 
and combines six bills carefully con-
structed by our colleagues on the Fi-
nancial Services Committee to improve 
transparency, fairness, and accuracy in 
America’s credit reporting system. It 
reforms and upgrades the process for 
consumers seeking to resolve errors in 
their credit reports, and it seeks to en-
sure that consumer financial informa-
tion held by the CRAs will be accurate, 
complete, and verifiable. 
This bill will: 
Prohibit reporting on consumers’ 
debt relating to medically necessary 
procedures and delay reporting by 1 
year for other forms of medical debt; 
Remove adverse credit file informa-
tion relating to defaulted or delinquent 
private education loans for borrowers 
who demonstrate a history of essen-
tially timely and faithful loan repay-
ments for these loans; 
Permit reasonable interruptions in 
the consecutive repayment periods for 
student borrowers facing unique and 
extenuating life events; 
Prohibit most current and prospec-
tive employers from using credit re-
ports to make employment decisions 
unless required by a local, State, or 
Federal law or government; 
Shorten the time period adverse cred-
it information stays on consumer re-
ports from 7 years to 4 years and from 
10 to 7 years for bankruptcy informa-
tion; 
Give consumers a new right to appeal 
the results of disputes with the CRAs; 
and 
Improve the oversight capabilities of 
the CFPB on credit reporting agencies 
and their scoring modules and require 
these agencies to better train their per-
sonnel on addressing consumer con-
cerns. 
It has been more than 15 years since 
we enacted comprehensive reform of 
the credit reporting system. The House 
can be proud of the significant progress 
this credit reform package will bring 
to hardworking people across America 
for whom credit and credit reports are 
the lifeline to education, housing, and, 
in many cases, good employment and 
financial stability. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
on 
the 
Senate 
amendment to H.R. 550, the House also 
considers the rule on two important 
amendments to the Senate amendment 
of H.R. 550. 
The first amendment, based on Rep-
resentative RO KHANNA’s No War with 
Iran Act, clarifies that Congress has 
not authorized military force against 
Iran and asserts Congress’ funding 
power to enforce the congressional au-
thorization requirements under the 
War Powers Resolution of 1973. It, thus, 
prohibits funds for any military force 
in or against Iran unless Congress de-
clares war or enacts specific statutory 
authorization for the use of military 
force against Iran or there is a national 
emergency created by an attack upon 
the United States or our Armed Forces 
consistent with the provisions of the 
War Powers Resolution. 
The second amendment, based on 
Representative BARBARA
LEE’s bill, 
will repeal the 2002 AUMF for the Iraq 
war against Saddam Hussein, which au-
thorized the President to use the 
Armed Forces to the extent ‘‘he deter-
mines to be necessary and appropriate’’ 
to ‘‘defend the national security of the 
United States against the continuing 
threat posed by Iraq’’ and ‘‘enforce all 
relevant 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council resolutions regarding Iraq.’’ 
The commanding premise of the 2002 
authorization was the need to counter 
the threat of weapons of mass destruc-
tion putatively possessed by Saddam 
Hussein. But Saddam Hussein actually 
never had nuclear weapons or other 
weapons of mass destruction and was 
driven from office in 2003 and was 
killed in 2006. The current government 
in Iraq is a strategic partner of the 
United States in the struggle against 
nonstate terror groups like ISIS and 
al-Qaida and poses no threat to our na-
tional security. 
The 2002 AUMF does not authorize, 
and has never authorized, the use of 
force against Iran; yet it was invoked 
by National Security Advisor Robert 
O’Brien as a primary source of the ad-
ministration’s authority to engage in 
military hostilities against Iran, in-
cluding 
the 
strike 
against 
Qasem 
Soleimani.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H581 
January 28, 2020 
This is one problem with obsolete 
AUMFs hanging around decades after 
they were approved. Presidents can 
treat them like a loaded gun sitting on 
a table which can be picked up at will 
and used in a completely different con-
text for a completely different reason. 
The 2002 authorization must be re-
pealed to ensure that no President now 
or in the future can use it as a 
pretextual justification for deploying 
military force without congressional 
authorization or a formal declaration 
of war as called for by the Constitution 
of the United States. 
Madam Speaker, the Framers gave 
Congress the power to declare war be-
cause they had just had a revolution 
against the kings and the monarchs 
who, for centuries, plunged their popu-
lations into wars of vanity, intrigue, 
political advantage, and distraction of 
the population. The Framers under-
stood that the power over life and 
death, over war and peace, was far too 
awesome to vest in one person, much 
less a political actor motivated by the 
desire for fame, prestige, and power. By 
giving Congress the exclusive power to 
declare war and to appropriate funds 
for war, the Framers made certain that 
the momentous decision to go to war, 
to send our troops into battle, would 
belong primarily to the representatives 
of the people, both the people who fight 
and die in our wars, their parents, and 
their families, and the communities 
that they are drawn from. 
Over the last month, the President 
initiated a dramatic escalation of ten-
sions with Iran without the consent of 
Congress and without consulting Con-
gress pursuant to the War Powers Res-
olution of 1973. In the case of the strike 
against Qasem Soleimani, Congress 
was 
never 
consulted 
by 
President 
Trump, although he apparently spoke 
with several people who were guests of 
his at Mar-a-Lago, where the decisions 
were apparently being made. 
On January 7, Iran retaliated for the 
killing 
of 
General 
Soleimani 
by 
launching ballistic missiles against our 
military and coalition forces in Iraq. 
We now know that at least 34 troops 
have been diagnosed with traumatic 
brain injuries from these strikes, inju-
ries the President has dismissed as 
headaches. We have still yet to receive 
any legitimate explanation for the jus-
tification for the strike in Iraq, and the 
administration’s subsequent briefing 
on these actions left far more questions 
than answers and troubled even many 
Republican Senators to the point of ex-
treme frustration. 
On January 8, when administration 
officials briefed Members of Congress 
on the President’s actions, both Demo-
crats and Republicans, alike, expressed 
grave concerns about the briefing, with 
one Member highlighting the adminis-
tration had given no time, place, or 
method justifying the attacks. The 
President later said there were four 
threats to United States Embassies, an 
explanation 
which 
apparently 
was 
withdrawn in the aftermath. So we 
still don’t know. 
In any event, Madam Speaker, we 
need to return to the Constitution of 
the United States and the rule of law. 
The grave decision to go to war is one 
that belongs properly with Congress. 
If we can send our sons and daughters 
into battle and ask them to exercise 
the most powerful courage in the world 
to do that, certainly, we can exercise 
and summon up the moral and political 
courage needed just to properly exer-
cise our constitutional powers. We 
have the power and we have the duty to 
declare war when we engage in mili-
tary hostilities abroad, and that is 
what we are doing with these two 
amendments. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume and thank my friend from Mary-
land for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, it is not lost on me 
that you are in the chair for this de-
bate; and having put in the years that 
you have put in working on this issue, 
I know you couldn’t be down here for 
your amendment later on this after-
noon. I am glad that you are in the 
chair today. 
It matters, folks who invest them-
selves in ideas around here; and what I 
love about this Chamber is that, if a 
man or a woman, either side of the 
aisle, any region of the country, com-
mits themselves to something, com-
mits themselves in a transparent, 
heartfelt way, their colleagues respond 
to that. 
I have had the great pleasure of vot-
ing for your amendments on this topic 
many times over the years because 
what my friend from Maryland says is 
exactly right. When it comes to mat-
ters of war and peace, this institution 
has, in many ways, by the wheelbarrow 
load, carried its authority down to 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue and left it down 
there, and the American people deserve 
better than that. Our men and women 
in uniform deserve better than that. 
And we, as stewards of this institution, 
can do better than that. 
Though, while I am pleased to see 
you in the chair, Madam Speaker, I 
confess I regret that it is on this bill, 
at this time, in this way. 
For decades, you have worked to 
build bipartisan support; you have not 
tried to work alone. When you have 
had to, you do go it alone. When you 
are going to be the only voice there, 
you will lead because you believe, and 
you will follow that path. But when 
you can, you build bridges. 
What is so frustrating to me about 
the rule that is before us today is we 
have an opportunity to come together; 
we have an opportunity to speak with 
one voice; we have an opportunity to 
restore exactly the kind of dialogue 
that my friend from Maryland suggests 
this House owes the American people; 
and we are letting it slip. 
b 1245 
I will start with the easier one. That 
is the Financial Services Committee 
bill that is wrapped up in this rule. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t know if you 
recall. It was just a few weeks ago we 
had another Financial Services Com-
mittee bill. It was H.R. 2534. It was the 
Insider Trading Prohibition Act. 
It seems like something we ought to 
all be able to get together on, but it 
was brought to the floor in a partisan 
way with absolutely no consultation on 
the other side. It was going to be a 
straight party-line vote, but to the 
credit of the chairwoman and ranking 
member of the Financial Services Com-
mittee, they continued to work to-
gether right up until the Rules Com-
mittee finished its meeting—you know 
that is the last stop before the bill 
comes to the floor—and they found a 
bipartisan pathway forward. 
They changed directions from what 
was going to be a straight party-line 
vote on the floor of the House that goes 
nowhere, to a vote—let me consult my 
notes because I want to be right—410–13 
was the result when we got together 
and worked in a bipartisan way. That 
is a bill that is going to go somewhere. 
All the challenges my friend in Mary-
land talked about with credit reporting 
agencies, they are real, and the rank-
ing member on the Financial Services 
Committee agrees with that. In fact, he 
has a substitute that has supported 
those ideas in a bipartisan way that he 
wanted to make in order to try to get 
us away from a partisan path. 
The Rules Committee, in its wisdom, 
voted on a party-line vote to deny the 
ranking member an opportunity to 
bring forward the bipartisan language 
that he had. 
So, we will go down this partisan 
road. Again, that is a partisan road on 
protecting consumers. It is a shame 
that has to happen. This bill is going to 
go nowhere. The President has prom-
ised he will veto it. The Senate is not 
going to take it up. We are not going to 
protect any consumers. We had a 
chance to, and we let that slip. Shame 
on us. 
As shameful as that is in the finan-
cial services space, as you know from 
your decades of work in the war and 
peace space, the consequences of fail-
ure for war and peace are even greater. 
Time and time again, oftentimes 
with your leadership, this House has 
had opportunities to revisit the Au-
thorization for Use of Military Force 
that it passed in 2001 and that it passed 
in 2002. Generally, it is in our appro-
priations bill, as you well know, be-
cause the committee of jurisdiction, 
the authorizing committee, the For-
eign Affairs Committee, that has the 
ability to have a full-throated debate 
on this issue to decide whether to re-
peal, whether to replace, how to struc-
ture that, has not moved legislation 
forward. We are in that exact same 
place today. 
You 
introduced 
your 
language, 
Madam Speaker, in May 2019. That is 
the language that this rule is going to 
stuff 
into 
the 
Congressional 
Gold 
Medal bill for merchant mariners. We 
will talk about that here in a bit. It is

going to stuff your language that you 
introduced in May that has never had a 
markup. 
Now, you led this issue when Presi-
dent Bush was in the White House, and 
we didn’t get a markup. You led this 
issue while President Obama was in the 
White House, and we didn’t get a mark-
up. You are now leading this issue 
while President Trump is in the White 
House, and we still have never had a 
markup. 
Now, don’t tell me about your com-
mitment to men and women in uni-
form. Do not tell me about what our 
Framers intended and bring language 
that has never had a committee mark-
up to the House floor. 
I asked these questions last night in 
the Rules Committee, Madam Speaker. 
I said: So which operations that are 
going on in Iraq today are going to be 
curtailed if we repeal the AUMF to-
morrow? 
I am not misremembering, Madam 
Speaker. So many times, when you 
have offered this language, you offered 
it for a date certain in the future. You 
recognized that doing something im-
mediately would have consequences 
that would be very difficult for men 
and women in uniform to deal with, 
difficult for the administration, dif-
ficult for our allies. So very often you 
said: Let’s put this down the road 6 
months, 9 months, 12 months. Let’s be 
certain that we are going to be done 
with it, but let’s give time to transi-
tion. 
I asked: This language today, what is 
the impact of that? 
I asked: Which members of the State 
Department have come to testify that 
this is not going to put our allies in a 
predicament, in a precarious predica-
ment in Iraq? 
The answer was: Well, we haven’t had 
those hearings. We don’t know those 
answers. We believe that we know, but 
we have not had those folks come to 
testify. 
Well, what about the FBI? How is 
this going to impact counterterrorism 
operations? 
Well, we have not had those con-
versations. We have not had that in an 
open hearing. We have not had a 
chance to talk about it. 
Well, what does the Pentagon have to 
say? 
Madam Speaker, we have an oppor-
tunity to do this in a thoughtful, bipar-
tisan way. 
The leadership that the new majority 
is providing in the House, candidly, 
gives you an opportunity to do things 
that might not have been possible in a 
Republican-led House. After your dec-
ade of work on that, I think you have 
earned that, and it would have been a 
bipartisan vote. 
Instead, we are here today for a par-
tisan exercise, with no input from the 
minority, that the President has al-
ready recommended a veto on. 
I think our men and women in uni-
form deserve better. I think this insti-
tution deserves better. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t know if you 
were paying attention as the Reading 
Clerk read. He did not go through and 
read all the amendments that were of-
fered. 
For the very important issue of cred-
it agencies and how we regulate them, 
the majority, in its wisdom, has made 
14 amendments in order. Fourteen dif-
ferent ideas are going to be considered 
for how we regulate credit reporting 
agencies. 
For the question of war and peace— 
what 
should 
be 
the 
wind-down 
timeline, how quickly should it take 
effect, who should be affected, what are 
the impacts of that, should it be re-
placed, should it just be repealed—for 
those very complicated life-and-death 
questions, no committee hearing, not 
one amendment made in order. 
The majority, in its wisdom, has pro-
vided 1 hour of debate on the floor of 
the House. 
My friend from Maryland is very 
adept at quoting our Framers. His 
knowledge of the Constitution runs 
deep. Debate has never meant an hour 
to come down to the House floor in a 
take-it-or-leave-it fashion. Debate, as 
our Framers intended it, meant that 
we were going to engage in dialogue 
with one another, that we were going 
to have a conversation about how to 
get it right together, that we were 
going to do what you have done for 
much of your career, in terms of build-
ing coalitions. We are doing none of it 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I have 30 minutes on 
the rule. We will have an hour of a 
take-it-or-leave-it debate. 
For our men and women in uniform, 
as I hold the veto threat from the 
White House here, and we are going to 
produce a partisan outcome with no 
hope of overriding a Presidential veto, 
if the Senate were even to take it up, 
which it won’t, we are going to be abso-
lutely no closer to achieving the goal 
that you and I have striven for to-
gether. In fact, I believe we are going 
to be further away from that goal at 
the end of this. 
I used all the ability I had as a Rules 
Committee member to try to keep this 
from going forward last night because I 
believe it is a missed opportunity. But 
on a 9–4 party-line vote, I was defeated. 
Madam Speaker, the only way to get 
back to the partnership that our men 
and women in uniform deserve, the 
partnership that the efforts that you 
have brought forward over the years 
have received, is to defeat this rule 
today and have the open hearing in the 
Foreign Affairs Committee, to have 
that testimony from the experts in this 
field, and then to move forward, not on 
a party-line vote that goes nowhere in 
this House, but in a big, big, big bipar-
tisan vote that moves through the Sen-
ate and either receives the President’s 
signature or overrides that veto. This 
isn’t going to get that done. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), the distin-
guished chairman of the House Rules 
Committee. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Maryland 
(Mr. RASKIN) for yielding me the time 
and for his leadership on the Rules 
Committee. 
Madam Speaker, something has been 
happening over the last few decades. 
Power meant to be held in these Halls, 
granted to us by the Constitution, in-
tentionally given to us by our Found-
ers, has ended up instead in the hands 
of whoever sat in the Oval Office. 
It wasn’t stolen by any particular 
President. No, Madam Speaker. We 
gave it away. 
Congresses run by both parties sur-
rendered it to Democratic and Repub-
lican administrations alike year after 
year after year. 
Nowhere is this more pronounced 
than when it comes to matters of war 
and peace. Make no mistake, the Con-
stitution is clear on this: The Presi-
dent may be Commander in Chief, but 
only Congress has the power to declare 
war. It is right there in Article I, Sec-
tion 8. 
But we abdicated that responsibility. 
We have been too content to stand on 
the sidelines and watch as wars were 
crafted and carried out by the White 
House with virtually no input from the 
people’s House. 
Our troops, the very people we rep-
resent, have received orders to deploy. 
Taxpayer dollars have been shoveled 
overseas. Policies have changed from 
one administration to the next. But 
too often, Congress remained silent, 
not because we were too engaged on 
other urgent matters, but because we 
feared the political risk of a vote. 
Many of our colleagues, on a bipar-
tisan basis, have tried to force debates 
and votes. I have joined many of my 
colleagues, from ADAM SMITH and BAR-
BARA LEE and RO KHANNA to TOM COLE 
and Walter Jones and MATT GAETZ. 
In fact, I have stood here more than 
two dozen times and pleaded for the 
chance to vote on many conflicts, like 
Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. 
Too often, these simple calls for de-
bate were ignored, but these are pre-
cisely the issues our constituents sent 
us here to debate, the hard ones, the 
ones where lives are at stake. 
Now, I don’t care who is President. I 
don’t care who controls the House. 
When our troops are ordered to engage, 
they do not do so casually. And once 
they are deployed, it is not easy for 
them to withdraw. We all know this. 
Wars are easy to start but are very, 
very hard to end. 
This is why how they begin is the 
most crucial decision. It cannot be left 
to one person. The Constitution en-
shrines that power in our hands, the 
people’s representatives, the people’s 
voice, and the people’s House. 
Today, Madam Speaker, the process 
of reclaiming that authority begins. 
This rule contains two measures. 
The first is a resolution from Con-
gresswoman LEE to repeal the 2002 Iraq

AUMF. For nearly two decades, this 
AUMF has been used by multiple Presi-
dents to unilaterally engage our troops 
in conflicts that Congress never imag-
ined when it was first passed. 
It was used to justify the recent 
strike 
against 
Iranian 
General 
Soleimani. 
If you think the consequences are 
limited, bear in mind that 34 more of 
our troops now suffer from traumatic 
brain injuries from Iran’s retaliatory 
strike. 
Pay attention to the words of Marine 
General Frank McKenzie, U.S. com-
mander in the Middle East, who told 
our troops on Thursday that 20,000 
newly deployed troops to the region 
could be there for ‘‘quite a while.’’ 
Repealing this AUMF isn’t just about 
ensuring that this President cannot 
use it as justification for asserting 
military force without proper congres-
sional authorization. This vote is about 
ensuring that no President can. 
The second item included in this rule 
is 
legislation 
from 
Congressman 
KHANNA to prohibit funding for mili-
tary action against Iran that is not au-
thorized by Congress. 
The situation with Iran remains 
volatile. If tensions should escalate 
again and President Trump wants to 
use military force, he must come to 
Congress first, period. 
These measures passed overwhelm-
ingly as bipartisan amendments to the 
House-passed NDAA bill last year. 
These are not new items or new ideas. 
Unfortunately, both were stripped out 
of the bill in final conference. 
It is my hope that this House will 
again approve these measures and that 
the Senate will recognize the urgency 
of their passage. 
Madam Speaker, I have heard a lot of 
talk about what it means to support 
our troops. Let me just say this: We re-
spect their service when we give them 
an honest, thoughtful debate about 
their sacrifice, about possible deploy-
ments that impact not only them but 
their families and their loved ones. 
Members of our military put their 
lives on the line for this country. The 
least we can do is have the guts to vote 
on their fate. 
Let’s respect our troops. Let’s re-
spect this institution. Let’s finally get 
back to respecting the Constitution, 
doing our jobs, and voting on issues of 
war and peace. 
I have to tell you, I am just sick and 
tired of hearing excuse after excuse, 
not only now, but over the last several 
years, from my colleagues as to why we 
can’t have these debates, why we can’t 
vote on these issues. 
Madam Speaker, it is time now for 
my colleagues to support the rule and 
the underlying measure.

H584 
January 28, 2020 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. KELLER) for the purpose of a 
unanimous consent request. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to amend the rule 
to provide for a motion to recommit on 
the Senate amendment to H.R. 550 so 
that minority voices can be heard on 
the critical issue of war. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair understands that the gentleman 
from Maryland has not yielded for that 
purpose; therefore, the unanimous con-
sent request cannot be entertained. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
BABIN) for the purpose of a unanimous 
consent request. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to amend the rule 
to provide for a motion to recommit on 
the Senate amendment to H.R. 550 so 
that minority voices can be heard on 
this critical issue of war. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair understands that the gentleman 
from Maryland has not yielded for that 
purpose; therefore, the unanimous con-
sent request cannot be entertained. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
CHABOT) for the purpose of a unani-
mous consent request. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to amend the rule 
to provide for a motion to recommit on 
the Senate amendment to H.R. 550 so 
that minority voices can be heard on 
the critical issue of war. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair understands that the gentleman 
from Maryland has not yielded for that 
purpose; therefore, the unanimous con-
sent request cannot be entertained. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. SPANO) for the purpose of a unani-
mous consent request. 
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to amend the rule 
to make in order the Cole-McCarthy 
amendment that would ensure the 
President 
can 
protect 
the 
United 
States and our ally, Israel. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair would advise that all time has 
been yielded for the purpose of debate 
only. 
Does the gentleman from Maryland 
yield for the purpose of this unanimous 
consent request? 
Mr. RASKIN. No, I do not. I have 
yielded for the purpose of debate only, 
and I would love to have a real debate 
about the resolution that is before us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland does not yield; 
therefore, the unanimous consent re-
quest cannot be entertained. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I share with my 
friend from Maryland that if the gen-
tleman is interested in a real debate, 
the gentleman would allow minority 
voices to be heard. 
If the gentleman is not following 
this, the reason that Members are com-
ing to the floor to make this request is 
because these resolutions, as they per-
tain to dealing with Iran, do nothing to 
protect our ally, our strongest friend in 
the Middle East, Israel, and we would 
like to make sure that Israel is pro-
tected. 
I ask my friend if he would yield for 
the debate on protecting our friend, 
Israel, and to have an opportunity for 
not dozens of minority amendments, 
but my friends are asking unanimous 
consent for one single Republican 
amendment to the underlying bill: a 
right that has been guaranteed to the 
minority for over 100 years, but has 
been turned off by clever procedural 
tricks in this particular rule today. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Missouri 
(Mrs. 
HARTZLER) for the purpose of a unani-
mous consent request. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent to amend the 
rule to make in order the Cole-McCar-
thy amendment that would ensure the 
President 
can 
protect 
the 
United 
States and our ally, Israel. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair understands that the gentleman 
from Maryland has not yielded for that 
purpose; therefore, the unanimous con-
sent request cannot be entertained. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. POSEY) for the purpose of a unani-
mous consent request, understanding 
that my friend from Maryland has 
called for a real debate. 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to amend the rule 
to make in order the Cole-McCarthy 
amendment that would ensure the 
President 
can 
protect 
the 
United 
States and our ally, Israel. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair understands that the gentleman 
from Maryland has not yielded for that 
purpose; therefore, the unanimous con-
sent request cannot be entertained. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to amend the rule 
to make in order the Cole-McCarthy 
amendment that would ensure the 
President 
can 
protect 
the 
United 
States and our ally, Israel. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair understands that the gentleman 
from Maryland has not yielded for that 
purpose; therefore, the unanimous con-
sent request cannot be entertained. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Kansas 
(Mr. MARSHALL) for the purpose of a 
unanimous consent request. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent to amend the 
rule to make in order the Cole-McCar-
thy amendment that would ensure the 
President 
can 
protect 
the 
United 
States and her ally, Israel. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair understands that the gentleman 
from Maryland has not yielded for that 
purpose; therefore, the unanimous con-
sent request cannot be entertained. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. WALDEN) for the purpose of a 
unanimous consent request. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that we would 
amend this rule, which then would 
make 
in 
order 
the 
Cole-McCarthy 
amendment. 
Now, that amendment would ensure 
the President can protect the United 
States and our ally, Israel. I don’t 
think that is asking too much. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair understands that the gentleman 
from Maryland has not yielded for that 
purpose; therefore, the unanimous con-
sent request cannot be entertained. 
The Chair would advise Members 
that even though a unanimous consent 
request is not entertained, embellish-
ments accompanying such requests 
constitute debate and will become an 
imposition on the time of the Member 
who yielded for that purpose. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
THORNBERRY) for the purpose of a unan-
imous consent request. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent to amend the 
rule to make in order the Cole-McCar-
thy amendment that would ensure the 
President 
can 
protect 
the 
United 
States and our ally, Israel. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair understands that the gentleman 
from Maryland has not yielded for that 
purpose; therefore, the unanimous con-
sent request cannot be entertained. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. CALVERT) for the purpose of a 
unanimous consent request. 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent to amend the 
rule to make in order the Cole-McCar-

Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I

Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous con-

Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent to amend the 
rule to make in order the Cole-McCar-
thy amendment that would ensure the 
President 
can 
protect 
the 
United 
States and our ally, Israel. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

from Maryland has not yielded for that

Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Alabama 
(Mr. PALMER) for the purpose of a 
unanimous consent request. 
Mr. PALMER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent to amend the rule 
to make in order the Cole-McCarthy 
amendment that would ensure the 
President 
can 
protect 
the

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

purpose; therefore, the unanimous con-
sent request cannot be entertained. 
b 1315 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, your rulings here 
today follow very clearly the Rules 
Committee meeting we had just across 
the Chamber last night that allowed 
for absolutely no amendment or discus-
sion of any kind on two war resolutions 
that have received no markup of any 
kind in the committee of jurisdiction. 
I know that seemed like a bother-
some and worrisome procedural process 
to have just gone through. Madam 
Speaker, in those few minutes that you 
were ruling those unanimous consent 
requests out of order, we have just dis-
cussed whether or not our commitment 
to Israel and its safety and security 
will be hampered by the underlying 
Khanna amendment in more detail 
than any committee of jurisdiction has 
ever done. In these few minutes of 
Members’ asking for a debate and being 
told no, ironically, when time was 
yielded for the purpose of debate only, 
we have discussed the issue more than 
in any markup in any committee of ju-
risdiction. 
There is not one Member of this 
Chamber who does not think our Na-
tion’s sons and daughters in uniform 
deserve better. There is not one Mem-
ber of this Chamber who does not think 
our ally Israel deserves better. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rarely fail to be 
moved by my good friend from Georgia 
(Mr. WOODALL) with his directness, his 
charm, and his legislative prowess. But 
I have to say I fail to be moved by this 
last jack-in-the-box procedural maneu-
ver of people getting up and asking for 
unanimous consent to do something 
that my friends failed to do for the last 
8 years when they could have had a 
hearing at any point on the War Pow-
ers Act, yet they didn’t do it. 
Now, I believe that all of my friends 
who got up in the line were operating 
under a misapprehension because there 
was a hearing in the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee on January 14—that is 
about 2 weeks ago—called ‘‘From Sanc-
tions to the Soleimani Strike to Esca-
lation: 
Evaluating 
the 
Administra-
tion’s Iran Policy’’ and all the implica-
tions in terms of Congress’ war powers. 
For the life of me, I can’t understand 
why my good friend is not joining us 
today. I understand that it is always 
possible to summon up a procedural ob-
jection when the substantive task at 
hand is too difficult to do politically. I 
understand this would require people 
to make the President of the United 
States mad because, like every Presi-
dent before him—and this is a bipar-
tisan issue, as Chairman MCGOVERN 
said—this President wants to be able to 
decide for himself whether or not the 
United States of America is going to be 
plunged into war. 
The very simple proposition that we 
bring before the House that everybody 
in the Chamber can speak to right now, 
and everybody in the Chamber can vote 
on, is the repeal of the Authorization 
for Use of Military Force Against Iraq 
Resolution of 2002. 
That was 18 years ago. We have kids 
who could die in a war against Iran in 
Iraq, or a war in Iran, based on this res-
olution, and they weren’t even born 
when this Authorization of Use of Mili-
tary Force was adopted by Congress. 
The real question is: Are we going to 
have the courage to stand up for the 
Constitution and to stand up for our 
constituents and say that we will not 
go to war unless there is a specific 
statutory authorization by Congress or 
a declaration of war or there is an ac-
tual attack on the United States such 
that the President is really acting in 
self-defense? 
Both 
Democratic 
and 
Republican 
Members of Congress were bewildered 
and frustrated by the presentation of 
this administration as to why the 
United States of America needed to 
commit that strike when they did. 
There were changing stories. About 
every 20 minutes, we got a new story 
about why it was necessary. I have not 
heard a single word on the other side— 
to their credit—defending any of the 
justifications or rationalizations or 
pretexts that were offered by the ad-
ministration. 
So, we come back to a constitutional 
point that is not difficult, and that is 
one that came up at that Foreign Af-
fairs Committee hearing a couple of 
weeks ago. It is one that we talked 
about in the Rules Committee last 
night in debate. It is one that every 
one of us is invited to join in right now 
on the floor of the House to discuss, 
which is the one that was made by the 
chairman of the Rules Committee. 
I have to say a word in honor of our 
great chair on the Rules Committee. 
He has been invoking the Constitution 
and the exclusive power of Congress to 
declare war for two decades, through 
Democratic 
Presidents, 
Republican 
Presidents, Bushes, Clintons, Obamas, 
and now Trump. He has been saying the 
same thing, which is that we should 
not be committing American troops to 
wars abroad without a vote of Con-
gress, which was the explicit design of 
the Framers of the Constitution. 
Go back to the Preamble of the Con-
stitution: 
We the people, in order to form a more per-
fect union, establish justice, ensure domestic 
tranquility, provide for the common defense, 
promote the general welfare, and preserve to 
ourselves and our posterity the blessings of 
liberty do hereby ordain and establish the 
Constitution of the United States of Amer-
ica. 
The very next sentence in Article I 
states that the legislative power is 
vested in a Congress of the United 
States, a House of Representatives and 
a Senate. Then, it sets forth all of our 
powers, including the power to declare 
war, the power of taxes, the power to 
appropriate money, the power to raise 
armies, the power to maintain a navy, 
and so on. All of that is with Congress. 
You go all the way through Article I, 
Madam Speaker, and then you get to 
Article II, where the President is de-
nominated the Commander in Chief of 
the Army and the Navy in times of ac-
tual conflict and insurrection, and the 
President’s core job is to take care 
that the laws are faithfully executed. 
That includes the Constitution itself, 
of course, and it includes the War Pow-
ers Resolution of 1973. 
This is a very clear principle. It is a 
constitutional axiom we are advancing 
today. We had a hearing on it a couple 
of weeks ago, but we don’t need weeks 
and months of hearings. Obviously, our 
good friends didn’t think it required 
any hearings over the 8 years that they 
were in control of the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
It is a simple proposition, which is 
that the war power belongs to Con-
gress. We have to declare war. We can’t 
run away from it any more than our 
brave troops can run away from battle 
when they have been committed to bat-
tle. 
All we are saying is that if there is 
going to be war against Iran, if there is 
going to be a war against the new gov-
ernment in Iraq—not Saddam Hussein, 
who is gone and dead—then we have to 
declare the war; we have to authorize 
the war; and we have to debate and de-
liberate over it as contemplated by the 
Founders of our country. That is our 
job. 
We had a bipartisan vote invoking 
the War Powers Resolution on January 
9. It ended up 224–194, but we had 
Democrats and Republicans invoking 
the War Powers Resolution with re-
spect to the situation in Iran. 
Again, I am not quite sure why our 
colleagues don’t want to do this with 
us. I understand it is easier to do it 
when the opposing party is in the 
White House, but we have many Mem-
bers on both sides of the aisle who have 
demonstrated their courage by invok-
ing the War Powers Resolution and by

standing up for the Constitution. That 
is what we have to do today, and we 
have the perfect opportunity and legis-
lative vehicle to do it right now. 
I reserve the remainder of my time, 
Madam Speaker. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t question my 
friend from Maryland’s passion at all. 
He says that we have the perfect vehi-
cle to get this done today. I refer you 
back to the rule. That perfect vehicle 
is called H.R. 550, the Merchant Mari-
ners of World War II Congressional 
Gold Medal Act of 2019. 
You haven’t heard us talk about mer-
chant mariners or gold medals yet 
today because, as you know, Madam 
Speaker, this rule would strip out all 
the language in the underlying bill 
that deals with gold medals and mer-
chant mariners and replace it with 
matters of war and peace. 
I will quote the author of one of the 
amendments that is stuffed into the 
merchant mariners bill in place of the 
merchant 
mariners 
language, 
Mr. 
KHANNA, who said in Politico last 
week: ‘‘Majority Leader Hoyer has 
done an excellent job in figuring out a 
procedure for how we can get a vote on 
the floor on these bills without an 
MTR,’’ a motion to recommit. 
Madam Speaker, a motion to recom-
mit is what you heard folks asking 
unanimous consent for. A motion to re-
commit in this case would be the only 
opportunity for any voices to be heard 
at all on this issue. 
My friend from Maryland proudly 
talks about a single hearing that was 
held 2 weeks ago, but it wasn’t held on 
this bill. There has been not one mark-
up, not one word, discussed in com-
mittee, marked up, and reported to the 
floor of this House—not one. 
My friend from Maryland says that 
we have to debate and deliberate over 
matters of this gravity, that that is 
our job. 
Madam Speaker, let’s do our job: de-
bate and deliberate. 
What does it tell you? That I have 
been voting with the Speaker on these 
issues for almost a decade, on issues of 
war and peace, and I am offended by 
the process that you are using to bring 
this to the floor the first time. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BUR-
GESS). 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Again, just to recapitulate, today’s 
rule provides for consideration of legis-
lation to do two things: one, to limit 
funding for any military action in or 
against Iran; and, two, repeal the 2002 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force. I do believe it is correct to advo-
cate for Congress to retake Article I 
powers, and it is correct to negotiate a 
new Authorization for Use of Military 
Force. 
I was not here in 2002. I was not able 
to vote on that legislation. However, 
we should not repeal the existing 2002 
authorization without a hearing, with-
out a markup, and without fully as-
sessing how it will affect our troops in 
the region. Further, we should evaluate 
whether or not a new Authorization for 
Use of Military Force should take its 
place. 
In fact, 2 or 3 weeks ago, Democratic 
leadership of this House brought H. 
Con. Res. 83. The House passed this ear-
lier this month. In the findings, the 
majority stated: ‘‘The United States 
has national interests in preserving its 
partnership with Iraq.’’ Yet, here we 
are now just a few weeks later consid-
ering a repeal of that very authority. 
If it was important 3 weeks ago, how 
did it become unimportant today? We 
don’t know because we haven’t had a 
hearing. 
Limiting funding for any military ac-
tion in and against Iran simply broad-
casts our plans or lack thereof to the 
enemy, potentially inciting further ag-
gression. Weakness is provocative. 
I voted for an amendment to the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act pro-
hibiting funding for authorized mili-
tary action in Iran because it was of-
fered, considered, and voted on fol-
lowing regular order. But neither piece 
of legislation addressing war authori-
ties before us today has been marked 
up or has had committee consideration. 
We heard last night in the Rules 
Committee that there have been hear-
ings focused on Iran and that, in fact, 
suffices. But, realistically, regional 
hearings do not allow for the serious 
discussion required for an Authoriza-
tion for Use of Military Force and in-
cluding funding for military action. 
In addition, currently, the Demo-
cratic majority is using a vehicle that 
removes minority Republicans’ ability 
to offer that one opportunity to amend 
the bill that is known as the motion to 
recommit. That is a long-honored tra-
dition of both sides that there should 
at least be one opportunity for the mi-
nority to be heard. 
So, I believe it is wrong to rush to 
limit war authorities, and it is irre-
sponsible. 
Do you know what, Madam Speaker? 
In a dangerous world, it is downright 
dangerous. Congress should be author-
izing action through a renegotiated 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force rather than passing a resolution 
prohibiting funding for military activ-
ity. 
b 1330 
I remember on the floor of this 
House, a former colleague, Rob Sim-
mons from Connecticut, a Republican, 
when there was an effort to limit fund-
ing during the most kinetic part of the 
Iraq war. Mr. Simmons had served in 
the Armed Forces during the Vietnam 
conflict, and he related, from one of 
these very podia, how, as a young sol-
dier in Vietnam, he had heard that 
Congress had withdrawn the funding 
for what he was doing. I will never for-
get his words. He said: At that mo-
ment, I hated the United States Con-
gress. 
That is the effect we can have on the 
young men and women whom we have 
sent to answer the call of duty, that 
Congress could and should be working 
to provide the necessary authorities for 
our Commander in Chief as he directs 
these brave young men and women in 
uniform rather than broadcasting our 
limitations to the enemy. 
Again, weakness is provocative. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, how 
much time do I have? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland has 51⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, if 
we defeat the previous question, we 
will offer an amendment to the rule 
that will make in order a bipartisan 
resolution, an amendment to deal with 
fentanyl and its listing on schedule I. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WAL-
DEN) for the purpose of explaining that 
previous question vote. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague and friend on the 
Rules Committee for yielding me the 
time. 
Our proposal to defeat the previous 
question and offer this amendment 
would do no underlying violence to the 
two bills—it has nothing to do with 
them—but it would save lives of all 
kinds of people in America. 
You see, fentanyl is a synthetic, 
manmade opioid. It is 50 times more 
potent than heroin. It is 100 times more 
potent than morphine. It is a scheduled 
drug under the Controlled Substances 
Act. However, Madam Speaker, drug 
traffickers are able to make small 
changes to fentanyl and its chemical 
structure, and that creates a new vari-
ation of the substance. 
Now, these so-called analogues are 
not on the schedule of controlled drugs. 
They are outside of the control of law 
enforcement, and they are incredibly 
dangerous—may I say, deadly. 
For example, one of these analogues, 
carfentanil, is 100 times as potent as 
the same amount of fentanyl, 5,000 
times more potent than a unit of her-
oin, and 10,000 times as potent as a unit 
of morphine. 
Now, the creation of analogues out-
paced the Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration’s ability to schedule them, so 
the DEA used emergency authorities to 
place all of the analogues in schedule I. 
The Controlled Substances Act, the 
CSA, provides the Attorney General 
with the authority to temporarily 
place a substance in schedule I of the 
CSA for 2 years if he finds that such ac-
tion is necessary to avoid an imminent 
hazard to the public safety. In 2018, the 
Trump administration’s DEA used this 
authority to place fentanyl analogues 
and fentanyl-like substances on that 
schedule I. 
So here is the issue: The emergency 
scheduling order expires next Thurs-
day, February 6, and Congress has yet

to extend it. The Senate passed an ex-
tension, Madam Speaker, I believe, 
unanimously; but, so far, Democrats in 
the House have not acted. 
There is no excuse for this. There is 
no reason for this. Lives will be lost. 
We have seen a series of delay tactics, 
and that is leading to an expiration of 
this incredibly important authority. 
With the United States Senate deal-
ing with impeachment, there is no time 
for the House to generate a new prod-
uct, a different bill, before this expires. 
So the House needs to pass the Senate 
extension this week so law enforce-
ment does not lose or have a lapse on 
this important capability to fight 
fentanyl, which is deadly, which is 
added to heroin, which causes deaths 
all across America. 
We are using this limited tool we 
have asking for a defeat of the previous 
question so that we can offer this 
should-be-unanimous 
amendment 
to 
get it on a vehicle so it can become 
law. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent to put the text 
of our amendment to amend the rule to 
add S. 3201 in the RECORD immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Everything we have talked about has 
been partisan and divisive. What you 
have just heard from the gentleman 
from Oregon is to say, in the midst of 
why ever it is the majority has chosen 
to use this rule today to move partisan 
priorities, to make statements instead 
of policy, that we have one opportunity 
to make policy, actual policy, policy 
that passed the Senate unanimously, 
policy that America needs, desires, 
that is going to expire next week, and 
that, if we added it today, would go 
straight to the President’s desk for his 
approval. 
I can’t count the number of times my 
colleagues have said that issues de-
serve debate. I didn’t come here to be 
part of a debating society. I came here 
to be a part of a getting-something- 
done group, conscientious men and 
women who want to do the best they 
can to serve their constituents. 
My friend from Oregon is offering us 
a chance to do exactly that today, and 
I would ask my friends—they have seen 
fit to use a very strange procedure to 
turn a Congressional Gold Medal for 
merchant mariners bill into a bill on 
war and peace. They have seen fit to 
strip away an opportunity for any 
voices to be heard on any of those 
measures whatsoever. 
They could, as long as they are set-
ting precedent, go ahead and support 
our defeat of the previous question 
today to add one more item so that we 
don’t leave here today having just 
made a point, so that we can leave here 
today having made a difference, as my 
friend from Oregon is giving us the op-
portunity to do. 
Mr. WALDEN. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. WOODALL. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Oregon. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, the 
gentleman’s passionate statements are 
all accurate and true. It was not that 
long ago we came together as a Con-
gress, the last Congress, under my 
leadership of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, and passed nearly 60 
pieces of legislation into one, the SUP-
PORT Act, that deals with the opioid 
crisis, the substance use disorder crisis 
in America, and one of the key points 
of that was dealing with this illegal 
fentanyl that is coming in. 
If we let this authority expire, the 
real practical consequence is these evil 
actors, these chemists in their labs, 
will simply alter the chemical makeup, 
which they do all the time, create an 
even more deadly or powerful fentanyl 
that can go into heroin and other drugs 
and kill our citizens, and they can do 
that lawfully because that new sub-
stance will not be covered. 
Now, we would hope the majority 
would move the Senate bill. But we 
have seen no text; we have heard no 
schedule. This authority expires next 
week on February 6, and we only have 
a legislative day or two left. 
Madam Speaker, lives hang in the 
balance. This, we should adopt. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, I 
know my friend from Maryland is pre-
pared to close. 
We had a bipartisan pathway forward 
on credit reporting agencies and re-
form, but the majority, in its wisdom, 
saw fit to shut those voices out; and 
this rule makes in order a partisan 
pathway forward that will go to the 
President’s desk, if it makes it through 
the Senate, for a veto. 
For decades, you have worked to 
build bipartisan support for finally re-
examining an AUMF that should have 
been reexamined decades ago. The ma-
jority, in its wisdom, has decided to 
shut out all voices, Republican and 
Democrat, hold no markups, change 
language not at all, and make a par-
tisan exercise of what should be a bi-
partisan issue, a resounding bipartisan 
issue, in this House; and my friend 
from Oregon is offering us an oppor-
tunity to take what has always been a 
bipartisan effort to protect our young 
people from the harms of opioids, to 
prevent traffickers from making chem-
ical changes that allow them to thwart 
the law, and move that to the Presi-
dent’s desk immediately. 
Madam Speaker, defeat the previous 
question. Defeat the previous question 
so that we can at least do one thing 
that we know will make a difference 
today, one thing that will bring us to-
gether, one thing the Senate did unani-
mously and the President would put a 
signature on tomorrow. Let’s do that 
one thing: defeat the previous question. 
I tell my colleagues, if they won’t de-
feat the previous question, they are 
going to have to defeat the rule, be-
cause they have turned protecting con-
sumers into a partisan exercise, pro-
tecting men and women in uniform 
into a partisan exercise, and all of the 
goodwill that men and women of this 
Chamber have put into building for 
decades becomes a little bit weaker 
today. 
Defeat the previous question; if not, 
defeat the rule. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I want to thank my good friend from 
Georgia for our robust and active ex-
change today. 
We came to debate matters of war 
and peace and the reassertion of Con-
gress’ essential constitutional powers 
over the declaration of war and the 
commitment of our troops and our 
funds to foreign wars. 
These are critical issues that our 
friends, when they were in charge of 
the Chamber, routinely ignored; but we 
are confronting them, and we invite 
them in enthusiastically to be part of 
this process of reasserting Congress’ 
war powers. 
But the minority’s previous question 
is obviously unnecessary and an irrele-
vant distraction from the important 
issues that we have come to address. 
And I want to be clear about this: It is 
an unnecessary distraction because the 
House majority leader committed this 
morning to bringing up S. 3201, which 
extends the ban on all fentanyl-based 
substances. It took place this morning. 
Check docs.house.gov, which has the 
complete running explanation of what 
is taking place. This morning, he 
scheduled it for the very first item of 
business tomorrow. 
So the bill that my friends are val-
iantly promising to bring to the floor if 
we defeat the previous question is al-
ready scheduled to be considered as the 
first item of business tomorrow morn-
ing under suspension of the House 
rules. 
And I will remind my colleagues of 
what defeating the previous question 
means. It gives control of the floor to 
the minority. We are not going to do 
that because we are here to prevent un-
authorized war with Iran; to repeal the 
obsolete and unnecessary 2002 AUMF, 
which addressed the situation with 
Saddam Hussein; and to modernize the 
credit reporting system, which is fail-
ing millions of Americans, our con-
stituents. 
For all of the reasons that we have 
discussed during this robust debate, we 
need to ensure that the whole House 
gets the chance to vote on all of these 
things: on the repeal of the 2002 Iraq 
AUMF and on reforming the credit re-
porting system so our people have bet-
ter access to credit and we have real 
transparency and fairness in people’s 
credit reports and credit scores.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H588 
January 28, 2020 
I hope that all of our colleagues, both 
in the majority and the minority, will 
join us in voting ‘‘yes’’ on the previous 
question and ‘‘yes’’ on this rule so we 
can move on to serious, thoughtful, de-
liberate consideration of all of these 
critical measures that we bring before 
the Congress and the American people. 
I also hope that all of our colleagues 
will join me in supporting S. 3201, the 
fentanyl legislation, which our col-
league discussed, on suspension tomor-
row. 
Mr. WALDEN. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. RASKIN. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Oregon. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, we 
agree on the fentanyl issue, I think. 
My understanding is that the leader 
posted this, Madam Speaker, at 11:50 
this morning, about a half an hour 
after we posted our previous question 
proposal to bring this to the floor. 
We are just curious what text, when 
it is scheduled. We need to resolve this 
issue, we would agree. 
b 1345 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, re-
claiming my time. I am thrilled to be 
able to assure the gentleman that we 
are taking up the exact Senate bill in 
its exact verbatim text. 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
the gentleman when that will occur. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, this 
will occur tomorrow morning on the 
first bill at 12:15, 12:30. It is the first 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, let me just say that 
I hope our friends take yes for an an-
swer, and I hope that this will perhaps 
usher in their ability to support the 
underlying legislation here because I 
know that they agree with us that the 
Constitution gives the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate the power 
to declare war. It gives Congress the 
power to declare war, to spend money 
on war. We should not allow a Presi-
dent of any party—Democratic, Repub-
lican, or anything else—to usurp that 
power and to engage in unilateral Pres-
idential wars without our specific au-
thorization, without our declaration, 
unless there is an attack on the land, 
the people of the United States, or our 
Armed Forces, as specified in the War 
Powers Resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. WOODALL is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 811 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (S. 
3201) to extend the temporary scheduling 
order for fentanyl-related substances, and for 
other purposes. All points of order against 
consideration of the bill are waived. The bill 
shall be considered as read. All points of 
order against provisions in the bill are 
waived. The previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the bill and on any 
amendment thereto to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Energy & Commerce; and (2) 
one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of S. 3201. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question on the resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. WOODALL. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair 
will 
postpone 
further 
proceedings 
today on motions to suspend the rules 
on which a recorded vote or the yeas 
and nays are ordered, or votes objected 
to under clause 6 of rule XX. 
The House will resume proceedings 
on postponed questions at a later time.

GLOBAL HOPE ACT OF 2019 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 5338) to authorize the Sec-
retary of State to pursue public-private 
partnerships, 
innovative 
financing 
mechanisms, 
research 
partnerships, 
and coordination with international 
and multilateral organizations to ad-
dress childhood cancer globally, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5338 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Global Hope 
Act of 2019’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Approximately 300,000 children aged 0 to 
19 years old are diagnosed with cancer each 
year. 
(2) The most common categories of child-
hood cancers include leukemia, brain cancer, 
lymphoma, and solid tumors, such as neuro-
blastoma and Wilms tumor. 
(3) Most childhood cancers can be cured 
with generic medicines and can be cost-effec-
tive for all income levels. 
(4) In the United States, the survival rate 
for children diagnosed with cancer is over 80 
percent. In many developing countries, the 
mortality rate of children diagnosed with 
cancer is around 80 percent. In some parts of 
Africa, the mortality rate reaches 90 percent. 
(5) In September 2018, the World Health Or-
ganization announced a new effort—the 
Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer—with 
the aim of reaching at least a 60-percent sur-
vival rate for children with cancer by 2030, 
thereby saving an additional 1,000,000 lives. 
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress as follows: 
(1) The work of the United States on infec-
tious disease remains the core tenet of 
United States work on global health. 
(2) As the United States and international 
partners continue to succeed in lowering 
incidences of infectious diseases, global mor-
tality rates of non-communicable diseases 
will become an increasing burden that must 
be addressed. 
(3) The United States should work to sup-
port the goals of the World Health Organiza-
tion Initiative for Childhood Cancer, helping 
increase survival rates for children with can-
cer. 
SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
The United States shall seek to— 
(1) increase political commitment for 
childhood cancer diagnosis, treatment, and 
care globally; 
(2) support efforts to increase the survival 
rate of children with cancer globally; 
(3) support efforts to train medical per-
sonnel and develop the capabilities of other 
existing healthcare infrastructure to diag-
nose, treat, and care for childhood cancer; 
(4) improve access to affordable and essen-
tial medicines and technologies that treat 
childhood cancer; 
(5) elevate and prioritize efforts to reduce 
the mortality rate of childhood cancer in 
international organizations such as the 
United Nations; 
(6) pursue research and research partner-
ships with international institutions to iden-
tify low-cost interventions and best prac-
tices to diagnose, treat, and care for child-
hood cancer in the United States and glob-
ally; and 
(7) 
improve 
partnerships 
with 
inter-
national health ministries and pharma-
ceutical companies to facilitate efforts for 
broader, global clinical trials for medicines 
to treat or care for childhood cancer in the 
United States and globally. 
SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION. 
The Secretary of State, in coordination 
with the heads of relevant Federal depart-
ments and agencies, is authorized and en-
couraged to— 
(1) 
pursue 
public-private 
partnerships, 
other research partnerships, and innovative 
financing mechanisms to address childhood 
cancer globally; and 
(2) coordinate with appropriate agencies of 
the United Nations and other relevant multi-
lateral organizations to address childhood 
cancer globally. 
SEC. 6. REPORT. 
Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
State shall submit to the Committee on For-
eign Affairs of the House of Representatives 
and the Committee on Foreign Relations of 
the Senate a report that includes the fol-
lowing: 
(1) An assessment of opportunities for 
United States engagement in global efforts 
to increase the worldwide survival rate of 
children with cancer. 
(2) An assessment of efforts taken by the 
United States to support efforts to increase 
the worldwide survival rate of children with 
cancer. 
(3) An assessment of existing programs 
funded by the United States that could be 
expanded to support efforts to increase the 
worldwide survival rate of children with can-
cer. 
(4) An assessment of how such increased 
international engagement could positively 
affect— 
(A) survival rates of individuals with child-
hood cancer in the United States; and

(B) reductions in the rates of infant and pe-
diatric morbidity and mortality. 
SEC. 7. COST LIMITATION. 
No additional funds are authorized to be 
appropriated to carry out the provisions of 
this Act. 
SEC. 8. CHILDHOOD CANCER DEFINED. 
In this Act, the term ‘‘childhood cancer’’ 
means cancers formed or diagnosed in indi-
viduals under the age of 20. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Minnesota. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 5338. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the measure before 
us is a wonderful bipartisan bill writ-
ten by Ranking Member MCCAUL and 
supported by Chairman ENGEL. 
Every year, more than 300,000 chil-
dren from all around the world are di-
agnosed with childhood cancer, and 
their lives are instantly turned upside 
down. 
Among them is my very own daugh-
ter, Pia, who was diagnosed with Hodg-
kin’s lymphoma when she was 14 years 
old. While she has since been cured and 
is among the very lucky ones, as a fa-
ther, I know all too well the horror 
that devastates way too many families 
around the world every single day. 
The Global Hope Act works to lever-
age the resources developed in the 
United States to explore public-private 
partnerships in the fight against child-
hood cancer all around the globe. 
It calls on the Secretary of State to 
coordinate these activities across the 
executive branch on this very impor-
tant initiative and to submit a report 
assessing current efforts and future op-
portunities to end such heart-wrench-
ing suffering. 
This is a good and very commonsense 
bill to expand the global fight against 
childhood cancer. I commend the rank-
ing member for his outstanding work 
on this issue, and I urge my colleagues 
to join me in supporting it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of my bill, the Global Hope Act. I 
am proud to have introduced this bill 
with my good friend, Chairman ELIOT 
ENGEL. I thank the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) for his strong 
support and his personal story. I also 
thank the co-chair of the Childhood 
Cancer Caucus, JACKIE SPEIER, for her 
tireless work with me in the caucus to 
help these children. 
I have been a tireless advocate for 
these children with cancer since I first 
came to Congress. In 2010, I helped 
found the Childhood Cancer Caucus 
really to give a voice to patients, advo-
cates, and the children. 
This endeavor is deeply personal for 
me, as well. Growing up in elementary 
school, my best friend passed away 
from leukemia. Back then, it was a 
death sentence. 
Since founding the caucus, we have 
been very successful. Congress passed 
bipartisan legislation to improve can-
cer treatment options, boost research 
opportunities, 
and 
address 
health 
issues of the nearly 500,000 long-term 
childhood cancer survivors. 
Today, childhood cancer is largely 
treatable with an 80 percent, 5-year 
survival rate in the United States. 
Unfortunately, in developing coun-
tries, the opposite is true. Children di-
agnosed with cancer in developing 
countries have an 80 percent mortality 
rate. 
Madam Speaker, in sub-Saharan Afri-
ca, the mortality rate of children diag-
nosed with cancer is as high as 90 per-
cent. This says nothing of the tens of 
thousands of cases that are believed to 
go undiagnosed every year. 
I truly believe that a child’s birth-
place should not determine their fate 
from cancer. That is why I introduced 
the Global Hope Act. 
My bill authorizes the Secretary of 
State to pursue public-private partner-
ships, increase access to treatment op-
tions, train health professionals, and, 
ultimately, improve care for children 
with cancer in developing countries. 
These partnerships will leverage dec-
ades of U.S. investments to strengthen 
health infrastructure and build the ca-
pacity of health ministries. 
This legislation does not take away 
funds from other critical global health 
interventions and infectious disease ef-
forts. 
Rather, 
these 
public-private 
partnerships will build on existing pro-
grams to improve childhood cancer sur-
vival rates. 
Organizations such as Texas Chil-
dren’s Hospital and St. Jude, private 
sector partners such as Bristol-Myers 
Squibb and Teva, and nonprofits such 
as ACCESS are already starting this 
important work and are now seeing re-
sults in Botswana and other nations. 
These efforts are also supported by the 
World Health Organization’s Global 
Childhood Cancer Initiative. 
Launched in 2018, the WHO aims to 
build political support and institu-
tional capacity to treat childhood can-
cer in developing countries. The initia-
tive set a goal of saving an additional 
1 million lives by 2030. 
For the past two decades, the United 
States has been a global leader in fund-
ing health programs around the world, 
and I am proud to support this life-
saving work. 
Most recently, we passed a resolution 
affirming the U.S. commitment to the 
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuber-
culosis and Malaria and secured robust 
funding in the fiscal year 2020 appro-
priations bill. 
Our work to fight HIV/AIDS and 
eradicate other infectious diseases is 
far from over. But there is a critical 
opportunity to build on the successes 
of these global health programs and in-
tegrate projects aimed at improving 
childhood cancer care and available 
treatment options. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important, life-
saving measure, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. SPEIER), my friend 
and co-chair of the Childhood Cancer 
Caucus. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Minnesota 
for granting me the time. 
To my good friend and colleague, the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL), 
let me say that this will be the most 
significant piece of legislation that you 
can take great pride in having au-
thored, as your career continues in this 
august body. I can’t begin to say how 
grateful I am to be working with you, 
not just on this bill but on our Child-
hood Cancer Caucus and the great work 
that you have done. 
This particular bill, the Global Hope 
Act, will have a profound impact on 
children around the world who have 
been diagnosed with cancer, 80 percent 
of whom die because of that diagnosis, 
while here in the United States, 80 per-
cent of those children now live. 
This is a remarkable effort that we 
must embrace wholeheartedly on both 
sides of the aisle. 
The Chinese effort, the Belt and Road 
Initiative, where they are investing in 
concrete around the world, says some-
thing about their values. This shows 
that we, in this country, are investing 
in people, particularly in children 
around the world, to save their lives. 
I join my colleague, again, in saying 
how important this legislation is, how 
enthusiastically I support it, and how, 
as we move forward, we can recognize 
that this is the kind of leadership that 
will bring peace around the world. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, let me thank my 
dear friend, JACKIE
SPEIER, for her 
leadership on this issue and as the co- 
chair of the caucus. I think we can 
prove that, in this toxic, partisan, dif-
ficult time in this Congress, we can 
work across the aisle, Republican and 
Democrat, but most importantly as 
Americans, to get good things done for 
not only the American people but for 
the world and save the children of the 
world. 
I think Congresswoman SPEIER
is 
correct. We passed a lot of bills to-
gether that have saved lives, but I

think this one probably is the most 
profound one. It is very difficult to 
pass a bill in the Congress, much less 
get it signed into law, but when you 
pass a bill and see it saving lives, that 
is perhaps the most remarkable and 
gratifying experience I have personally 
had in my eight terms in Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman so much for her friendship. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, I remem-
ber being in Texas Children’s Hospital 
in September 2018 to hear from the 
President 
of 
Botswana 
about 
the 
project Global HOPE initiative in-
spired by Baylor College of Medicine 
and their early work against HIV/AIDS 
and the epidemic in Africa. Global 
HOPE is starting to deliver childhood 
cancer care in sub-Saharan Africa, as I 
speak. 
At the event, when I met the Presi-
dent of Botswana, where the Global 
HOPE Act was recently constructed in 
a new pediatric facility in Botswana, 
which I will be visiting next month 
with my little, childhood cancer sur-
vivor, Sadie Keller. It is starting to 
train a new generation of Botswanan 
oncologists. 
What I was most impressed by was 
when he told me about the legacy of 
PEPFAR and what we did as a Nation. 
He said: PEPFAR saved a generation of 
my people from extinction—from ‘‘ex-
tinction.’’ 
It is my hope that this bill saves a 
generation of children from this dread-
ed disease. I believe that childhood 
cancer can be the next successful Glob-
al HOPE initiative that will save lives. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank, 
particularly, Dr. Poplack, who was the 
chief oncologist at Texas Children’s. He 
is the one who is responsible for this 
initiative. We are taking their initia-
tive and turning it into law in the Con-
gress. I will be there next month to 
commemorate International Children’s 
Cancer Day. 
Madam Speaker, I do want to ref-
erence, too, my little childhood cancer 
fighter and survivor, Sadie Keller. She 
came into my office, and there are a lot 
of lobbyists in this town, but the chil-
dren had no voice. They had no power. 
That is why JACKIE and I formed the 
Childhood Cancer Caucus, to give them 
a voice.

When she entered my office—she is 7 
years old here—in her pink dress, I 
knew I had met somebody very special. 
I canceled my calendar, my schedule 
for the rest of the day, and I took her 
on a tour of the Capitol. 
Here we are looking—we had no idea 
they were even taking pictures—but I 
took her to the Rotunda in the Capitol. 
I remember we spun around and looked 
at the top of the Capitol. 
Then I took her out to the Speaker’s 
balcony, one of the most beautiful 
views in this Capitol building. Looking 
out on the horizon toward the future, 
seeing the ominous dark clouds, but 
also a ray of sunshine. The sunshine 
that is coming in, the sunshine that 
little Sadie has brought to my life, the 
sunshine that we are trying to bring to 
all these children out there who have 
gone through some really tough experi-
ences. I have met many of them, like 
the Congressman from Minnesota’s 
daughter, and it is very heartbreaking 
to see them in the hospitals. Some sur-
vive, and some don’t. 
But this effort will take it to the 
next step, to take our fight against 
this dreaded disease. We have done so 
much to help children in the United 
States. The FDA’s approval of CAR T, 
which takes your own immune system 
and attacks your own cancer through 
your own T cells, rather than injecting 
chemo—which is really a derivative of 
World War I mustard gas, which has 
been 
banned 
from 
the 
battlefield, 
which kills the cancer just before it 
kills you. 
You can imagine the survivorship 
issues with these children, because 
they have the rest of their lives, if they 
survive, to deal with. 
So, I want to thank all those friends 
of mine on the other side of the aisle 
for helping me move this forward. This 
is a momentous day for our fight 
against childhood cancer. It is a mo-
mentous day to take it global and take 
the fight globally. 
I look forward to this bill’s passage 
in the Senate and it being signed into 
law. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, childhood cancer is 
devastating; yet, many types can now 
be treated effectively and at relatively 
low cost. It is incumbent on all of us to 
make sure the United States’ policy is 
working toward this end and doing 
what we can to stop the suffering. 
The Global Hope Act is a good meas-
ure that leverages the resources devel-
oped here in the United States to ex-
plore public/private partnerships to 
fight childhood cancer all around the 
globe. 
I am very grateful to Ranking Mem-
ber MCCAUL for his dedication and tire-
less work on this cause. 
I am proud to support this, and I urge 
all my fellow Members to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
PHILLIPS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5338, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
SUPPORTING THE RIGHTS OF THE 
PEOPLE OF IRAN TO FREE EX-
PRESSION 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and agree to 
the resolution (H. Res. 752) supporting 
the rights of the people of Iran to free 
expression, condemning the Iranian re-
gime for its crackdown on legitimate 
protests, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 752 
Whereas, on November 15, 2019, popular 
protests against the Iranian regime began 
and rapidly spread to at least 100 cities 
throughout the country, in the most signifi-
cant antigovernment protests in Iran since 
June 2009; 
Whereas the protests began in response to 
an announced increase on the price of fuel 
and protesters have expressed numerous eco-
nomic grievances, while also calling for the 
structural reform of the political system and 
condemning current and former Iranian lead-
ers; 
Whereas reports indicate that Iranian se-
curity forces have used lethal force in arrest-
ing more than 7,000 people and killed hun-
dreds of people in connection with the pro-
tests; 
Whereas reports indicate that Iranian Gov-
ernment authorities have, in many in-
stances, refused to return victims’ bodies to 
their families and that security forces have 
removed bodies from morgues and trans-
ferred them to unknown locations; 
Whereas, on November 16, 2019, Iranian au-
thorities began implementing a near-total 
shutdown of internet services, stopping near-
ly all means of online communications for 
people inside Iran, to preclude the sharing of 
images and videos of deadly violence being 
used by security forces; 
Whereas section 103(b)(2)(B) of the Com-
prehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, 
and Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 
8512(b)(2)(B)) authorizes licensing services re-
lating to personal communications over the 
Internet, to improve the ability of the Ira-
nian people to speak freely; 
Whereas General License D–1 authorizes 
the provision of key communication tools to 
the Iranian people with the aim of ensuring 
that the Iranian people can freely access the 
internet; 
Whereas, on November 16, 2019, Iran’s Inte-
rior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said 
that the Iranian regime will no longer show 
‘‘tolerance’’ and ‘‘self-control’’ toward the 
protesters; 
Whereas, on November 17, 2019, Iranian Su-
preme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called 
the demonstrators ‘‘villains’’ galvanized by 
foreign enemies and domestic insurgents and 
ordered Iranian security services to ‘‘imple-
ment their duties’’ to end the protests; 
Whereas, on November 18, 2019, Iran’s Is-
lamic Revolutionary Guard Corps deployed 
to the city of Mahshahr and engaged in mass 
repression, reportedly killing as many as 100 
people; 
Whereas several laws provide authorities 
to designate and sanction elements of the 
Iranian regime involved in significant cor-
ruption or serious human rights abuses, in-
cluding the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, 
Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010, 
the 
Countering 
America’s 
Adversaries 
Through Sanctions Act, and the Iran Threat 
Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 
2012;

January 28, 2020 
Whereas the Iranian regime was implicated 
in a March 2018 plot in Albania and June 2018 
plot in France against Iranian opposition ac-
tivists; 
Whereas 
Iran’s 
Islamic 
Revolutionary 
Guard Corps and its Basij militia have been 
sanctioned by the United States for planning 
and carrying out serious human rights 
abuses against the Iranian people, including 
for the cruel and prolonged torture of polit-
ical dissidents; 
Whereas in August 2018 the United States 
criminally charged two persons for acting as 
illegal agents of the Government of Iran for 
having conducted surveillance on Jewish and 
Israeli facilities and Iranian political dis-
sidents; 
Whereas the regime has routinely violated 
the human rights of Iranian citizens, includ-
ing by implementing ongoing, systematic, 
and serious restrictions of freedom of peace-
ful assembly and association and freedom of 
opinion and expression, including the con-
tinuing closures of media outlets, arrests of 
journalists, and the censorship of expression 
in online forums such as blogs and websites; 
Whereas the Department of State’s 2018 
Human Rights Report on Iran noted ‘‘severe 
restrictions on free expression, the press, and 
the 
internet, 
including 
censorship, 
site 
blocking, and criminalization of libel; sub-
stantial interference with the rights of 
peaceful assembly and freedom of associa-
tion, such as overly restrictive nongovern-
mental organization (NGO) laws; egregious 
restrictions of religious freedom; restrictions 
on political participation; widespread cor-
ruption at all levels of government’’; 
Whereas, on November 18, 2019, Secretary 
of State Mike Pompeo stated that, ‘‘The 
United States is monitoring the ongoing pro-
tests in Iran closely. We condemn strongly 
any acts of violence committed by this re-
gime against the Iranian people and are 
deeply concerned by reports of several fatali-
ties. . .The Islamic Republic must cease vio-
lence against its own people and should im-
mediately restore the ability of all Iranians 
to access a free and open Internet.’’; 
Whereas, on November 22, 2019, the United 
States imposed sanctions on Iran’s Minister 
of Information and Communications Tech-
nology for his role in shutting down internet 
access in Iran; 
Whereas, on November 18, 2019, the Office 
of the German Chancellor stated that, ‘‘It is 
legitimate and deserving of our respect when 
people courageously air their economic and 
political grievances, as is currently hap-
pening in Iran. The Iranian government 
should respond to the current protests with a 
willingness to engage in dialogue. . .We urge 
the government in Tehran to respect free-
dom of assembly and expression.’’; 
Whereas, on November 20, 2019, the French 
Foreign Ministry stated that, ‘‘France is fol-
lowing the demonstrations taking place in 
Iran with concern. It expresses its deep con-
cern at reports that a large number of dem-
onstrators have been killed in the last few 
days. It reaffirms its attachment to respect 
for the freedom of expression and to access 
to means of communication, as well as to the 
right to demonstrate peacefully. France 
calls on Iran to comply with its inter-
national human rights obligations, in par-
ticular the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights.’’; 
Whereas, on November 21, 2019, the Euro-
pean Union stated that, ‘‘The protests in sev-
eral Iranian cities over the past days have, 
according to reports, led to serious loss of 
life and left many people injured. We convey 
our condolences to the families of victims 
and wish a speedy recovery to those injured. 
Socio-economic challenges should be ad-
dressed through inclusive dialogue and not 
through the use of violence. We expect Iran’s 
security forces to exercise maximum re-
straint in handling the protests and for 
protestors to demonstrate peacefully. Any 
violence is unacceptable. The rights to free-
dom of expression and assembly must be 
guaranteed. We also expect the Iranian au-
thorities to ensure the free flow of informa-
tion and access to the internet.’’; 
Whereas, on November 26, 2019, Secretary 
of State Michael Pompeo stated, ‘‘The Ira-
nian people are once again on the streets be-
cause of the regime’s poor economic manage-
ment. And instead of addressing their griev-
ances, Tehran has responded with violence 
and blaming those outside of the country.’’; 
Whereas, on December 8, 2019, the High 
Representative of the European Union Josep 
Borrell Fontelles stated that, ‘‘A growing 
body of evidence indicates that despite re-
peated calls for restraint, the Iranian secu-
rity forces’ disproportionate response to re-
cent demonstrations has led to high numbers 
of deaths and injuries. For the European 
Union and its Member States, the widespread 
and disproportionate use of force against 
nonviolent protestors is unacceptable.’’; 
Whereas, on December 8, 2019, the High 
Representative of the European Union Josep 
Borrell Fontelles stated that ‘‘A growing 
body of evidence indicates that despite re-
peated calls for restraint, the Iranian secu-
rity forces’ disproportionate response to re-
cent demonstrations has led to high numbers 
of deaths and injuries. For the European 
Union and its Member States, the widespread 
and disproportionate use of force against 
nonviolent protestors is unacceptable.’’; 
Whereas Iran is a member of the United 
Nations, voted for the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, and is a signatory to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Polit-
ical 
Rights, 
among 
other 
international 
human rights treaties; 
Whereas in violation of these and other 
international obligations, Iranian regime of-
ficials continue to violate the fundamental 
human rights of the Iranian people; 
Whereas the Iranian regime has a long his-
tory of violent repression of dissent, includ-
ing— 
(1) in 1988, the Iranian regime carrying out 
the barbaric mass executions of thousands of 
political prisoners by hanging and firing 
squad for refusing to renounce their political 
affiliations and in some cases for possessing 
political reading material, including pris-
oners of conscience, teenagers, and pregnant 
women; 
(2) in 1999, the Iranian regime brutally sup-
pressing a student revolt that was one of the 
largest mass uprisings up until that point in 
the country since 1979; 
(3) following voting irregularities that re-
sulted in the 2009 election of President 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian regime 
brutally suppressing peaceful political dis-
sent from wide segments of civil society dur-
ing the Green Revolution in a cynical at-
tempt to retain its undemocratic grip on 
power; and 
(4) beginning in December 2017, and con-
tinuing for several months after protests 
erupted in more than 80 cities, the Iranian 
regime suppressing such protests with re-
pressive force that resulted in at least 25 
deaths and 4,000 arrests; 
Whereas, on January 9, 2018, the House of 
Representatives overwhelmingly passed H. 
Res. 676, a resolution supporting the rights of 
the people of Iran to free expression and con-
demning the Iranian regime for its crack-
down on legitimate protests; 
Whereas, on December 5, 2019, the Depart-
ment of State identified the Great Tehran 
Penitentiary (Fashafuyeh) and Qarchack 
Prison as entities responsible for gross viola-
tions of internationally recognized human 
rights in Iran and subject to the imposition 
of sanctions under section 106 of the Coun-
tering America’s Adversaries Through Sanc-
tions Act (22 U.S.C. 9405); 
Whereas, on January 8, 2020, the Iranian 
military 
shot 
down 
a 
civilian 
airliner 
Ukrainian Airlines Flight 752 in a surface-to- 
air missile strike, killing 176 civilians 
aboard; 
Whereas for three days, the Iranian mili-
tary denied that it shot down Ukrainian Air-
lines Flight 752 before admitting responsi-
bility on January 11, 2020; 
Whereas 
peaceful 
protestors 
amassed 
throughout Iran on January 11, 2020, and sub-
sequent days, decrying the Government of 
Iran’s downing of the Ukrainian airliner, 
subsequent campaign of lies and obfuscation, 
and continued undemocratic practices; and 
Whereas in response to peaceful protests 
throughout early January 2020, Iranian Gov-
ernment forces fired live rounds and used 
brutal tactics against civilians in a manner 
well-documented by international human 
rights organizations, media, and scores of 
Iranians: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) stands with the people of Iran that are

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H592 
January 28, 2020 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
752. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, since November, 
Iranian protesters have flooded the 
streets, demonstrating against corrup-
tion, high fuel, and high food prices. 
Protests flared up in recent weeks after 
the government of Iran took responsi-
bility for downing a Ukrainian airliner 
after, of course, initially denying it. 
Peaceful protesters have been met 
with violence and brutality from the 
Iranian regime. Over 1,500 people have 
been killed, and thousands more in-
jured. 
For decades, this has been the horri-
fying standard practice of the regime, 
heinous human rights abuses and sig-
nificant corruption, even targeting Ira-
nian dissidents abroad. 
We must send a clear message now to 
the protesters that we stand with 
them. Today’s resolution shows that 
solidarity; that we stand for the rights 
of the Iranian people to free expression, 
and we condemn the regime for its 
crimes. 
Today, we urge the President and the 
Secretary of State to work with the 
international community to ensure 
that violations of human rights are 
part of all formal and informal, multi-
lateral or bilateral discussions with 
and regarding Iran. 
Sending a strong message of support 
is important, but the United States 
must do more to help the Iranian pro-
testers. The administration should help 
the Iranian people access free and unin-
terrupted internet, including broad-
ening General License D–1, the Treas-
ury Department’s license of personal 
communication devices and software 
that helps Iranians access the free flow 
of information. 
The administration should also wel-
come, not deny, Iranian visitors to the 
United States, because giving Iranians 
an opportunity to experience our great 
country for themselves is the best way 
to counter anti-American sentiment 
and fear. 
There is much that we can do to help 
the protesters, and we must start today 
with this resolution. I urge all my col-
leagues to join me in passing this great 
measure. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Iranian people and our con-
demnation of the Iranian regime’s 
crackdown on legitimate protests. 
I want to first thank Congressman 
DEUTCH
for bringing this important 
legislation, introducing this resolution. 
And I am proud to be a cosponsor of it. 
Twice in the past 3 months, the Ira-
nian people have bravely raised their 
voices to protest the conduct of the 
despotic Iranian regime. And both 
times, these peaceful, popular dem-
onstrations have been met with utter 
violence. 
In November, protestors across Iran 
voiced their anger at an abrupt in-
crease in gasoline prices. This soon 
broadened to voicing their anger at the 
regime as a whole. 
The Islamic Republic of Iran re-
sponded with brutal force. Security 
thugs 
opened 
fire 
on 
unarmed 
protestors. The regime cut off the 
internet in an attempt to silence the 
voice of the people and suppress the 
evidence of the security forces’ blood-
shed. 
Despite the regime’s efforts, the 
world still knows about their cruelty. 
We have all seen the videos of security 
forces shooting innocent people on the 
streets. The regime killed as many as 
1,500 people, by far the largest and 
most violent crackdown since the 1979 
revolution. 
Just a few weeks later, the Iranian 
people were once again furious with 
their government. This time, it was be-
cause the regime shot down a commer-
cial airliner, killing 176 innocent peo-
ple, many of whom were Iranian. Even 
worse, the regime did not admit to hav-
ing done so for 3 days. They inten-
tionally lied to their own people and to 
the world. 
Once again, security forces fired on 
peaceful protestors. 
The broad frustration with this cruel, 
lying regime is evident. An Iranian 
Olympic medalist announced she was 
defecting because of ‘‘hypocrisy, lies, 
injustice, and flattery.’’ 
Iran’s State TV anchor resigned, say-
ing, ‘‘It was very hard for me to believe 
the killing of my own countrymen. I 
apologize for lying to you on television 
for the last 13 years.’’ 
With this resolution, we declare that 
the House of Representatives stands 
with the people of Iran demanding ac-
countability from their leaders. 
I thank the President for loudly and 
clearly supporting the rights of the Ira-
nian people. The President has urged 
the regime not to use violence against 
their own people. He has also worked 
to hold the Iranian regime accountable 
for its cruelty. 
The 
administration 
has 
actively 
sought information about the perpetra-
tors of violence through its tip line. 
Using those tips, the administration 
has sanctioned those with blood on 
their hands, such as the IRGC com-
mander who oversaw a massacre in No-
vember, killing as many as 148 people. 
I want to thank the administration for 
taking concrete action to support the 
people of Iran. 
This resolution is our opportunity in 
the Congress to show the same support. 
It is an important step, but we can and 
must do more. Our next course of ac-
tion should be to pass my bill that 
holds the Iranian officials accountable 
for serious human rights abuses. 
So let’s stand together as Americans 
and keep the process and pressure up 
on this dangerous regime. 
And let me just say, I have talked to 
many Iranians throughout this coun-
try, and the people of Iran are watch-
ing this Chamber. They are watching 
what we say here. Our voices do matter 
in Iran and to the Iranian people who 
are in the United States. 
So I want to again thank Congress-
man DEUTCH for bringing this impor-
tant resolution that stands up for the 
people of Iran. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. DEUTCH), the author of 
this important resolution, and the 
chairman of the Subcommittee on the 
Middle East, North Africa, and Inter-
national Terrorism. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Minnesota for 
yielding. 
I appreciate the kind words of the 
ranking member of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, and I appreciate his leader-
ship. 
Special thanks, as well, to the rank-
ing member of the Middle East, North 
Africa, and International Terrorism 
Subcommittee, Mr. WILSON, for his 
leadership on these issues and his com-
mitment to standing up for the Iranian 
people. 
In mid-November, popular protests 
against the Iranian regime began and 
rapidly spread to at least 100 cities 
throughout the country, in the most 
significant anti-government protests in 
Iran since 2009. 
While protesters took to the streets 
in response to an increase in fuel 
prices, they also called for structural 
reform of the Iranian political system. 
They condemned current and former 
leaders. 
In response, Iranian authorities shut 
down the internet. Security forces used 
lethal force, killing hundreds of people, 
marking the highest casualty rate of 
any protest movement in Iran since the 
Islamic revolution 4 decades ago. And 
they arrested over 7,000 more. 
Protesters 
returned 
earlier 
this 
month after Iran shot down Ukrainian 
Airlines Flight 752 as it took off from 
Tehran’s International Airport, killing 
all 176 people on board, and then tried 
to cover it up. 
The Iranians in the streets were frus-
trated by the regime’s lies, frustrated 
by their incompetence, and chanted 
against the IRGC and against the Su-
preme Leader. As in November, Iranian 
authorities met these protests with un-
lawful, disproportionate force. 
Congress has long expressed bipar-
tisan support for the human rights of 
the Iranian people, including the rights 
to peaceably assemble and the right to 
protest.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H593 
January 28, 2020 
Congress has also supported the 
rights of Iranian dissidents and author-
ized the licensing of communication 
services to improve the ability of Ira-
nian people to speak freely. 
In keeping with that tradition, H. 
Res. 752 expresses the support of the 
House of Representatives for the rights 
of the Iranian people to free expression 
and condemns the regime for its crack-
down on the recent, legitimate, peace-
ful protests in Iran. 
The resolution condemns the Iranian 
regime’s serious human rights abuses, 
its significant corruption, destabilizing 
activities abroad, and urges the Presi-
dent and the Secretary of State to 
work with the international commu-
nity to ensure that violations of 
human rights are part of all formal and 
informal multilateral or bilateral dis-
cussions regarding Iran. 
I also encourage additional efforts by 
this House to support the people of 
Iran. These include initiatives proposed 
by my colleagues, like the one by Rep-
resentative TOM MALINOWSKI, to end 
the ban on Iranians and other citizens 
of 
predominantly-Muslim 
countries 
from entering the United States. If we 
truly support the Iranian people, we 
need to allow them to visit so they can 
experience our vibrant society, so they 
can experience democracy, so that they 
can see pluralism and our great demo-
cratic traditions. I look forward to 
working with my colleagues to help ad-
vance these measures as well. 
I thank my colleagues for their 
strong support of this resolution which 
demonstrates 
that 
Congress 
stands 
with the Iranian people and supports 
their right to live in a free society.

Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. WILSON), the rank-
ing member on the Subcommittee for 
the Middle East, North Africa, and 
International Terrorism. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the Repub-
lican leader, MIKE MCCAUL, for yield-
ing. 
I am pleased to speak in favor of H. 
Res. 752, which supports the rights of 
the Iranian people to protest without 
violent consequences from the Islamic 
Republic regime, which I coauthored 
with my appreciative colleague, Chair-
man TED DEUTCH from Florida. 
Last November, thousands of people 
all over 100 cities of Iran demonstrated 
against the regime’s oppressive eco-
nomic and tyrannical other policies. 
The Islamic Republic responded vi-
ciously to these peaceful protests. The 
regime killed over 1,000 people and ar-
rested thousands more. We mourn the 
deaths of these courageous individuals 
who died while advocating for their 
rights. 
The Iranian people again voiced their 
anger in January when the Islamic Re-
public lied about shooting down a 
Ukrainian civilian passenger Boeing 
jet, killing 176 people. 
How did the regime respond to the 
protests over the death of these inno-
cent people? By using more violence 
against innocent civilians. 
Today, we say to the people of Iran: 
We respect the importance of Persian 
culture to the world and your right to 
be heard without fear. We support your 
rights to ask for a better governance. 
We ask for accountability from your 
government, to ask for a government 
that puts your interests first and does 
not deceive you with blatant corrup-
tion. We will not allow you to be over-
looked or forgotten, and we will stand 
by you while this regime brutalizes 
you. 
President Donald Trump has taken a 
firm stand in support of the protestors, 
saying: ‘‘To the brave, long-suffering 
people of Iran: I’ve stood with you 
since the beginning of my Presidency, 
and my administration will continue to 
stand with you. We are following your 
protests closely and are inspired by 
your courage.’’ 
I 
agree 
with 
President 
Donald 
Trump, and I am gratified to stand 
today in support of the free expression 
of 
the 
Iranian 
people. 
President 
Trump’s sanctions deter terrorism and 
protect American families. 
I thank my colleagues for bringing 
this bipartisan resolution to the floor. 
I look forward to seeing it pass and 
continuing to work together to support 
the rights of the Iranian people. 
Iranian 
Americans 
are 
extraor-
dinarily successful in America and very 
much appreciated in every State. In 
my home State of South Carolina, Ira-
nian American doctors are vital. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ), my friend. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud of the growing Iranian American 
community in my district, California’s 
36th. I have spoken with members of 
the community, and I have watched 
the protests in Iran. 
I am increasingly concerned and out-
raged at what we are witnessing from 
the Iranian regime. The violence, the 
oppression, the internet blackouts, the 
large-scale incarcerations—these are 
egregious human rights violations. 
Over 7,000 Iranians have been ar-
rested and, tragically, over 1,000 killed 
by Iranian security forces since No-
vember of last year. 
This shameful use of violence by the 
state security forces, sweeping internet 
shutoffs, jailing of journalists and 
protestors, these are just the most re-
cent examples of merciless attempts of 
censorship by a regime with a long, ab-
horrent history of oppression and vio-
lence against its own people. 
We must support the protestors seek-
ing nothing but their fundamental 
human rights and civil liberties such as 
the freedom to assemble openly, speak 
freely, and have an open and free press. 
That is why I stand with my Iranian 
American constituents in support of bi-
partisan H. Res. 752: to support the 
rights of the people of Iran to free ex-
pression and to say, forcefully, that we 
condemn the Iranian regime for its vio-
lent tactics to oppress its legitimate 
protestors. 
To the Iranian people seeking free-
dom, democracy, and human rights: I 
stand with you. The United States Con-
gress stands with you. The American 
people stand with you. We will con-
tinue supporting you as you fight for 
your basic rights, freedom, and democ-
racy. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
pass H. Res. 752 here today. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
in 2016, President Obama sent $1.7 bil-
lion of untraceable cash on shrink- 
wrapped cargo pallets to the regime in 
Iran. The Iranian expatriates in my 
district reported that immediately fol-
lowing this shameful spectacle, the Ira-
nian Guard expanded dramatically and 
began a brutal round of repression that 
cost thousands of innocent Iranians 
their lives. 
Thankfully, President Trump has re-
versed these destructive policies of ap-
peasement. The renewal of sanctions 
against Iran is again bringing eco-
nomic pressure on the regime and caus-
ing European nations to reconsider 
their ties with that tyranny. 
Iran is one of the oldest and greatest 
civilizations in history, yet it has been 
suppressed and plundered by a clique of 
theocratic thugs who comprise the ille-
gitimate Iranian Government. 
This resolution is an important ges-
ture, but it is empty and idle without 
action. We need to support the free-
dom-fighting organizations operating 
within Iran with the same financial re-
sources that Obama sent to their op-
pressors. I challenge the House major-
ity to do so. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I met with a group 
of Iranian Americans just this last 
weekend, and I talked to them about 
their friends in Iran who are fighting 
this oppression. I saw the video, the 
internet feed that they are able to get 
out of country. One of the problems has 
been they shut down the internet. They 
control the internet in Iran because it 
was built with security in mind, first. 
It is very difficult to get communica-
tions both inside and outside of Iran, 
but we are working on those tech-
nologies today, Madam Speaker, so 
that these people can communicate 
with the outside world. They are being 
held hostage themselves by the Aya-
tollah, who held our Embassy officials 
hostage in 1979. They are listening to 
our voices here in the Congress, and 
they are shooting out texts and emails, 
and we are finding ways to get them to 
communicate. 
There are 80 million people in Iran, 
once a great empire, the Persian em-
pire that brought us so many great 
things; and now, under this oppressive 
theocracy, the majority of these people

do not support their own oppressive, 
brutal killing regime. 
The Islamic Republic of Iran, in my 
judgment, their days are limited, and 
it is time for the people of Iran to take 
back their country. And when I say 
this to the people of Iran, know that 
the American people stand with the 
people of Iran. Know that this House 
stands with the people of Iran and that 
this Congress and President stand with 
the people of Iran. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, Iranian people want 
the same thing that Americans want: 
peace, opportunity, and security. It is 
critical that we now support the peace-
ful protestors in Iran today. 
Today’s resolution shows that we 
stand in solidarity with the Iranian 
people in their struggle against the 
cruelty of their regime, and I hope all 
Members will join me in supporting 
this important measure. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H. Res. 752, a resolution 
supporting human rights and fundamental 
freedoms in Iran. Today, we send a vital mes-
sage to the protest movement in Iran that—as 
they 
face 
persecution 
and 
violence—the 
House of Representatives stands in solidarity 
with them. 
For decades, the Iranian regime has op-
pressed dissidents. From the 1988 massacre 
to the 2009 protests to today, people who 
dared to speak against the Iranian regime has 
been subject to torture, arrest, disappearance 
and worse. Iran’s prisons are some of the 
most notorious in the world. 
The protests have escalated since the Ira-
nian regime lied to the world about their re-
sponsibility for shooting down the Ukrainian 
jetliner. It is unfathomable that for three days, 
the Iranian regime sought to hide their culpa-
bility. 
The United States must do what we can to 
help support those who fight for human rights 
and freedom in Iran. This resolution outlines 
some important steps, including expanding 
internet access for Iranian dissidents by eas-
ing the restrictions on sharing software and 
hardware for personal communication devices. 
I would also add that if the Trump adminis-
tration wants to send a message of solidarity 
to the Iranian protest movement, they should 
repeal the ill-conceived Muslim ban, which has 
prevented Iranians from visiting and studying 
in America. 
The American people have no quarrel with 
the people of Iran. America should welcome 
those Iranians who want to see America for 
themselves. 
I’d like to thank Mr. DEUTCH and Mr. WILSON 
for spearheading this important resolution. 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of H. Res. 752, which reinforces our 
nation’s support for the rights of the Iranian 
people to have free speech, free association 
and fair elections. For over 40 years the Ira-
nian regime has engaged in terrorism and has 
been a declared enemy of freedom, human 
rights, and freedom of religion. The Iranian re-
gime, a designated state sponsor of terrorism, 
states its antipathy for the United States on a 
daily basis. The regime has engaged in atroc-
ities in Iran and throughout the world. 
Recently President Trump authorized the re-
moval of Iranian terrorist Qassem Soleimani. 
The president had the legal authority to do so 
under the Congressionally enacted AUMF per-
taining to Iraq. In the United States, expatri-
ates from Iran applauded this as long overdue 
justice for a leading proponent of terror, death 
and destruction. This action should have been 
taken years ago by the Obama Administration. 
Instead of addressing Iran’s terrorist actions, 
the prior administration gave aid and support 
to the terrorist regime. No doubt some of that 
aid, including billions of dollars, was used to 
kill innocent people. It took the courage of a 
real leader to be bold and do what needed to 
be done. 
Our country supports the Iranian opposition 
via the Organization of Iranian American Com-
munities. Their fight is our fight. With patience, 
a new day will dawn in Iran and its people will 
be free again. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
PHILLIPS) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 752, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

ers, including any future Dalai Lama, is de-

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING THE 
SUCCESSION 
OR 
REINCARNATION 
OF THE DALAI LAMA. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Notwithstanding that Tibetan Bud-
dhism is practiced in many countries includ-
ing Bhutan, India, Mongolia, Nepal, the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China, the Russian Federa-
tion, and the United States, the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China has repeat-
edly insisted on its role in managing the se-
lection of Tibet’s next spiritual leader, the 
Dalai Lama, through actions such as those 
described in the ‘‘Measures on the Manage-
ment of the Reincarnation of Living Bud-
dhas’’ in 2007. 
(2) On March 19, 2019, Chinese Ministry of 
Affairs spokesperson reiterated that the ‘‘re-
incarnation of living Buddhas including the 
Dalai Lama must comply with Chinese laws 
and regulations and follow religious rituals 
and historical conventions’’. 
(3) The Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China has interfered in the process of 
recognizing a successor or reincarnation of 
Tibetan Buddhist leaders, including in 1995 
by arbitrarily detaining Gedhun Choekyi 
Nyima, a 6-year old boy who was identified 
as the 11th Panchen Lama, and purporting to 
install its own candidate as the Panchen 
Lama. 
(4) The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, 
issued a statement on September 24, 2011, ex-
plaining the traditions and spiritual precepts 
of the selection of Dalai Lamas, setting forth 
his views on the considerations and process 
for selecting his successor, and providing a 
response to the Chinese government’s claims 
that only the Chinese government has the 
ultimate authority in the selection process 
of the Dalai Lama. 
(5) The 14th Dalai Lama said in his state-
ment that the person who reincarnates has 
sole legitimate authority over where and 
how he or she takes rebirth and how that re-
incarnation is to be recognized and if there is 
a need for a 15th Dalai Lama to be recog-
nized, then the responsibility shall primarily 
rest with the officers of the Dalai Lama’s 
Gaden Phodrang Trust, who will be informed 
by the written instructions of the 14th Dalai 
Lama. 
(6) Since 2011, the 14th Dalai Lama has re-
iterated publicly on numerous occasions that 
decisions on the successions, emanations, or 
reincarnations of the Dalai Lama belongs to 
the 
Tibetan 
Buddhist 
faith 
community 
alone. 
(7) On June 8, 2015, the United States House 
of Representatives unanimously approved 
House Resolution 337 which calls on the 
United States Government to ‘‘underscore 
that government interference in the Tibetan 
reincarnation process is a violation of the 
internationally recognized right to religious 
freedom . . . and to highlight the fact that 
other countries besides China have long Ti-
betan Buddhist traditions and that matters 
related to reincarnations in Tibetan Bud-
dhism are of keen interest to Tibetan Bud-
dhist populations worldwide’’. 
(8) On April 25, 2018, the United States Sen-
ate unanimously approved Senate Resolution 
429 which ‘‘expresses its sense that the iden-
tification and installation of Tibetan Bud-
dhist religious leaders, including a future 
15th Dalai Lama, is a matter that should be 
determined solely within the Tibetan Bud-
dhist faith community, in accordance with 
the inalienable right to religious freedom’’. 
(9) The Department of State’s Report on 
International Religious Freedom for 2018 re-
ported on policies and efforts of the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China to 
exert control over the selection of Tibetan 
Buddhist religious leaders, including reincar-
nate lamas, and stated that ‘‘U.S. officials 
underscored that decisions on the reincarna-
tion of the Dalai Lama should be made solely 
by faith leaders.’’. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy 
of the United States that— 
(1) decisions regarding the selection, edu-
cation, and veneration of Tibetan Buddhist 
religious leaders are exclusively spiritual 
matters that should be made by the appro-
priate religious authorities within the Ti-
betan Buddhist tradition and in the context 
of the will of practitioners of Tibetan Bud-
dhism; 
(2) the wishes of the 14th Dalai Lama, in-
cluding any written instructions, should 
play a determinative role in the selection, 
education, and veneration of a future 15th 
Dalai Lama; and 
(3) interference by the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China or any other gov-
ernment in the process of recognizing a suc-
cessor or reincarnation of the 14th Dalai 
Lama and any future Dalai Lamas would 
represent a clear violation of the funda-
mental religious freedoms of Tibetan Bud-
dhists and the Tibetan people. 
(c) HOLDING
CHINESE
OFFICIALS
RESPON-
SIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ABUSES TAR-
GETING TIBETAN BUDDHISTS.—It is the policy 
of the United States to consider senior offi-
cials of the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China who are responsible for, 
complicit in, or have directly or indirectly 
engaged in the identification or installation 
of a candidate chosen by China as the future 
15th Dalai Lama of Tibetan Buddhism to 
have committed— 
(1) a gross violation of internationally rec-
ognized human rights for purposes of impos-
ing sanctions with respect to such officials 
under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights 
Accountability Act (22 U.S.C. 2656 note); and 
(2) a particularly severe violation of reli-
gious freedom for purposes of applying sec-
tion 212(a)(2)(G) of the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)(G)) with re-
spect to such officials. 
(d) DEPARTMENT
OF STATE PROGRAMMING 
TO
PROMOTE
RELIGIOUS
FREEDOM
FOR
TI-
BETAN BUDDHISTS.—Consistent with section 
401 of the Frank R. Wolf International Reli-
gious Freedom Act (Public Law 114–281; 130 
Stat. 1436), of the funds available to the De-
partment of State for international religious 
freedom programs, the Ambassador-at-Large 
for International Religious Freedom should 
support efforts to protect and promote inter-
national religious freedom in China and for 
programs to protect Tibetan Buddhism in 
China and elsewhere. 
SEC. 4. POLICY REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENT 
AND WATER RESOURCES ON THE TI-
BETAN PLATEAU. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The Tibetan Plateau contains glaciers, 
rivers, grasslands, and other geographical 
and ecological features that are crucial for 
supporting vegetation growth and biodiver-
sity, regulating water flow and supply for an 
estimated 1.8 billion people. Global warming 
threatens the glaciers in Tibet that feed the 
major rivers of South and East Asia, which 
supply freshwater to an estimated 1.8 billion 
people. 
(2) Rising global temperatures—especially 
in the Tibetan Plateau where the average 
temperature has increased at twice the glob-
al average—will result in variable water 
flows in the future. 
(3) The construction in Tibet of large hy-
droelectric power dams intended to be used 
in part to transmit power to Chinese prov-
inces outside of Tibet, as well as other infra-
structure projects, including the Sichuan- 
Tibet railroad, may also lead to the resettle-
ment of thousands of Tibetans and transform 
the environment. 
(4) The grasslands of Tibet play a signifi-
cant role in carbon production and seques-
tration and Tibet’s rivers support wetlands 
that play a key role in water storage, water 
quality, and the regulation of water flow, 
support 
biodiversity, 
foster 
vegetation 
growth, and act as carbon sinks. 
(5) Rising temperatures and intensifying 
evaporation, can affect the water supply, 
cause desertification, and destabilize infra-
structure on the Tibetan Plateau and be-
yond. 
(6) Traditional Tibetan grassland steward-
ship practices, which can be key to miti-
gating the negative effects of warming on 
the Tibetan Plateau, are undermined by the

resettlement of nomads from Tibetan grass-
lands. 
(7) The People’s Republic of China has ap-
proximately 20 percent of the world’s popu-
lation but only around 7 percent of the 
world’s water supply, while many countries 
in South and Southeast Asia rely on the riv-
ers flowing from the Himalayas of the Ti-
betan Plateau. 
(8) The People’s Republic of China has al-
ready completed water transfer programs di-
verting billions of cubic meters of water 
yearly and has plans to divert more waters 
from the Tibetan plateau in China. 
(b) WATER RESOURCES IN TIBET AND THE TI-
BETAN WATERSHED.—The Secretary of State, 
in coordination with relevant agencies of the 
United States Government, should— 
(1) pursue collaborative efforts with Chi-
nese and international scientific institu-
tions, as appropriate, to monitor the envi-
ronment on the Tibetan Plateau, including 
glacial retreat, temperature rise, and carbon 
levels, in order to promote a greater under-
standing of the effects on permafrost, river 
flows, grasslands and desertification, and the 
monsoon cycle; 
(2) engage with the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China, the Tibetan people, 
and nongovernmental organizations to en-
courage the participation of Tibetan nomads 
and other Tibetan stakeholders in the devel-
opment and implementation of grassland 
management policies, in order to utilize 
their indigenous experience in mitigation 
and stewardship of the land and to assess 
policies on the forced resettlement of no-
mads; and 
(3) encourage a regional framework on 
water security, or use existing frameworks, 
such as the Lower Mekong Initiative, to fa-
cilitate cooperative agreements among all 
riparian nations that would promote trans-
parency, sharing of information, pollution 
regulation, and arrangements on impounding 
and diversion of waters that originate on the 
Tibetan Plateau. 
SEC. 5. DEMOCRACY IN THE TIBETAN EXILE COM-
MUNITY. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The 14th Dalai Lama advocates the Mid-
dle Way Approach, which seeks genuine au-
tonomy for the six million Tibetans in Tibet. 
(2) The 14th Dalai Lama has overseen a 
process of democratization within the Ti-
betan polity, beginning in Tibet in the 1950s 
and continuing in exile from the 1960s to the 
present and to address the needs of the Ti-
betan people until such time as genuine au-
tonomy in Tibet is realized, the 14th Dalai 
Lama devolved his political responsibilities 
to the elected representatives of the Tibetan 
people in exile in 2011. 
(3) In 2011 and again in 2016, members of 
the Tibetan exile community across some 30 
countries held elections to select political 
leaders to serve in the Central Tibetan Ad-
ministration parliament and as chief execu-
tive, elections which were monitored by 
international observers and assessed to be 
free and fair. 
(4) The Dalai Lama has said that the Cen-
tral Tibetan Administration will cease to 
exist once a negotiated settlement has been 
achieved that allows Tibetans to freely enjoy 
their culture, religion and language in Tibet. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) Tibetan exile communities around the 
world should be commended for the adoption 
of a system of self-governance with demo-
cratic institutions to choose their leaders; 
(2) the Dalai Lama should be commended 
for his decision to devolve political author-
ity to elected leaders in accordance with 
democratic principles; and 
(3) as consistent with section 621(d)(3) of 
the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 6901 
note), the United States Special Coordinator 
for Tibetan Issues should continue to main-
tain close contact with the religious, cul-
tural, and political leaders of the Tibetan 
people. 
SEC. 6. SUSTAINABILITY IN TIBETAN COMMU-
NITIES 
SEEKING 
TO 
PRESERVE 
THEIR CULTURE, RELIGION, AND 
LANGUAGE. 
The Secretary of State should urge the 
Government of Nepal to honor the Gentle-
man’s Agreement with the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees and to pro-
vide legal documentation to long-staying Ti-
betan residents in Nepal who fled a credible 
threat of persecution in Tibet in order to 
allow them to more fully participate in the 
economy and society of Nepal.

SEC. 8. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Minnesota. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on H.R. 4331. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman 
MCGOVERN, along with Mr. SMITH, Mr. 
SUOZZI, and Mr. MEADOWS, for author-
ing this very important bill to update 
U.S. policies that support the preserva-
tion of Tibetan culture and faith as 
well as the environment of the Tibetan 
Plateau, which is vital not just to the 
Tibetan people, but also to the Hima-
layan ecosystem. 
I also thank Speaker PELOSI, who has 
been a tireless champion of the Tibetan 
people for many years. She has a long 
history of shining a spotlight on 
human rights abuses in China and has 
ensured that this Chamber does its 
part to defend our values. 
The Tibetan Policy and Support Act 
of 2019 updates existing legislation 
from 2002 to make sure our policies 
keep pace with the challenges facing 
Tibet today. This legislation comes at 
a very critical time for the Tibetan 
people as they seek to preserve their 
cultural and religious identity. 
The Chinese Government has repeat-
edly asserted that it has a role to play 
in the selection of the next Dalai

Lama. This is analogous to the Govern-
ment of Italy announcing that it can 
ignore Catholic tradition and unilater-
ally decide who the next Pope should 
be. Such disregard for the Tibetan faith 
is an undue violation of international 
religious freedoms. 
This bill sends a very clear message 
to Chinese officials that, if they inter-
fere in the selection process for a fu-
ture Dalai Lama or other Tibetan Bud-
dhist leader, they can be sanctioned by 
the United States for violating human 
rights. 
The Tibetan Policy and Support Act 
also reauthorizes programs to preserve 
Tibetan culture and environment. 
The Tibetan Plateau is home to 10 
major Asian river systems feeding 10 
different Asian states, and these re-
sources are being threatened by large- 
scale hydroelectric projects. These riv-
ers are of immense importance to the 
livelihood of not only Tibetan commu-
nities, but also the nearly 2 billion peo-
ple in South and East Asia. 
I urge all Members to join me in sup-
porting this very good measure to con-
tinue underscoring our support for the 
Tibetan people. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 
Washington, DC, January 10, 2020. 
Hon. ELIOT L. ENGEL, 
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN ENGEL: This is to advise 
you that the Committee on the Judiciary 
has now had an opportunity to review the 
provisions in H.R. 4331, the ‘‘Tibetan Policy 
and Support Act of 2019’’ that fall within our 
Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your con-
sulting with us on those provisions. The Ju-
diciary Committee has no objection to your 
including them in the bill for consideration 
on the House floor, and to expedite that con-
sideration is willing to forgo action on H.R. 
4331, with the understanding that we do not 
thereby waive any future jurisdictional 
claim over those provisions or their subject 
matters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees. 
Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 
Washington, DC, January 24, 2020. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on Judiciary, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: I am writing to 
you concerning H.R. 4331, the Tibetan Policy 
and Support Act of 2019. I appreciate your 
willingness to work cooperatively on this 
legislation. 
I acknowledge that provisions of the bill 
fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee 
on Judiciary under House Rule X, and that 
your Committee will forgo action on H.R. 
4331 to expedite floor consideration. I further 
acknowledge that the inaction of your Com-
mittee with respect to the bill does not 
waive any future jurisdictional claim over 
the matters contained in the bill that fall 
within your jurisdiction. I will also support 
the appointment of Committee on Judiciary 
conferees during any House-Senate con-
ference convened on this legislation. 
Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of 
letters is included in the Congressional 
Record during floor consideration of the bill. 
Thank you again for your cooperation re-
garding the legislation. I look forward to 
continuing to work with you as the measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
ELIOT L. ENGEL, 
Chairman. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 4331, the Tibetan 
Policy and Support Act. 
The Chinese Communist Party’s, or 
CCP’s, crusade against faith is the 
greatest threat to religious freedom in 
the world today. This bill reminds us 
that the religious persecution didn’t 
begin under Chairman Xi. The CCP has 
always hated and feared religion. 
Since China invaded Tibet in 1950, 
the CCP has tried to dismantle Tibetan 
Buddhism. In 1995, Chinese authorities 
kidnapped the second highest Tibetan 
faith leader and replaced him with a 
fraud. 
The Chinese Communist Party wants 
to ensure Tibetan leaders are chosen 
according to their political agenda, not 
according to Tibetan Buddhist reli-
gious practices. 
This bill states that the United 
States will not accept the CCP’s de-
struction of Tibetan Buddhism, we will 
not accept fraudulent religious leaders 
appointed by Beijing, and we will not 
accept the CCP’s control of deeply spir-
itual beliefs. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this important 
measure, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), the 
author of this important bill and the 
chairman of the Rules Committee. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his advocacy on behalf of this issue. 
And the ranking member of the For-
eign Affairs Committee, I am delighted 
to be here with him, and I want to 
thank him for his work on this. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 4331, the Tibetan Policy 
and Support Act. I am proud to have 
introduced this legislation with Con-
gressman CHRIS SMITH of New Jersey 
and with Senators RUBIO and CARDIN in 
the Senate. 
I thank Chairman ENGEL and Rank-
ing Member MCCAUL for their strong 
support of this bill and, more impor-
tantly, for their tireless leadership in 
support of the human rights of the Ti-
betan people. 
b 1430 
Madam Speaker, our bill updates and 
strengthens the Tibetan Policy Act of 
2002 to address the challenges facing 
the Tibetan people. Perhaps as impor-
tantly, it reaffirms America’s commit-
ment to the idea that human rights 
matter, that we care about those who 
are oppressed, that we stand with those 
who are struggling for freedom, and 
that we have a moral obligation to do 
something when we see something that 
is not right. 
It should be clear that we support a 
positive and productive U.S.-China re-
lationship, but it is essential that the 
human rights of all the people of China 
are respected by their government. 
Unfortunately, the human rights sit-
uation in Tibet has gotten much worse. 
The Chinese Government has refused to 
enter into genuine dialogue with Ti-
betan leaders. Restrictions on access to 
Tibet, both for Tibetans and foreigners, 
have 
been 
tightened. 
International 
journalists have stated that the isola-
tion of Tibet is as bad as North Korea, 
allowing human rights abuses and envi-
ronmental degradation to be concealed 
from the outside world. 
Last year, the Congress passed the 
Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act to de-
mand that American journalists, dip-
lomats, and tourists be given the same 
freedom to travel to Tibet that Chinese 
officials have to travel freely in Amer-
ica. I hope to see a report from the 
State Department, which was due in 
December, describing the steps that 
the administration has taken to imple-
ment this policy over the last year. 
In addition, the Chinese Government 
has used advanced technology to inten-
sify security and surveillance. 
It has ratcheted up its so-called anti- 
crime and vice campaign targeting Ti-
betans. 
Religious freedom continues to be se-
verely curtailed, including through 
mandatory political education for reli-
gious leaders and arrests of Tibetans 
who display a photo of the Dalai Lama. 
The Panchen Lama turned 30 years 
old this year, but he and his family re-
main incommunicado since being kid-
napped by Chinese authorities in 1995, 
making him the world’s longest-serv-
ing prisoner of conscience. 
Finally, Chinese officials have inter-
vened to select Tibetan Buddhist lead-
ers and threatened to choose the suc-
cessor to the 14th Dalai Lama. These 
actions are in clear violation of China’s 
international obligations to protect re-
ligious freedom. 
It is essential that U.S. policy toward 
Tibet be updated and strengthened. 
The bill we are considering today 
would establish as U.S. policy that the 
succession or reincarnation of Tibetan 
Buddhist leaders, including a future 
15th Dalai Lama, is an exclusively reli-
gious matter that should be decided 
solely by the Tibetan Buddhist commu-
nity. 
Send a clear message that Chinese of-
ficials who interfere in the succession 
or reincarnation process will be subject

to targeted financial, economic, and 
visa-related sanctions, including those 
contained in the Global Magnitsky 
Act. 
Strengthen the role of the State De-
partment Special Coordinator for Ti-
betan Issues by including a mandate to 
work multilaterally to promote a gen-
uine dialogue. 
Mandate that no new Chinese con-
sulates should be established in the 
United States until a U.S. consulate is 
established in Tibet’s historical capital 
of Lhasa. 
Direct the State Department to begin 
collaborative, multinational efforts to 
protect the environment and water re-
sources of the Tibetan Plateau. 
Support democratic governance in 
the Tibetan exile community. 
The Dalai Lama should be com-
mended for his decision to devolve po-
litical authority to elected leaders. 
The Tibetan exile community is also 
to be commended for adopting a system 
of self-governance with democratic in-
stitutions to choose their own leaders, 
including holding multiple free and fair 
elections to select its parliament and 
chief executive. 
The adoption of democracy within 
the Tibetan exile community ensures 
that the Central Tibetan Administra-
tion in Dharamsala, India, legitimately 
represents and reflects the aspirations 
of the Tibetan people around the world. 
Standing 
together, 
the 
American 
people will remain steadfast partners 
of the Tibetan people. For 60 years, His 
Holiness the Dalai Lama and so many 
Tibetans have remained separated from 
their land and their home, while the 
people in Tibet endure some of the 
harshest human rights abuses in the 
world. 
I am proud that today the House of 
Representatives is taking this impor-
tant step to strengthen U.S. policy in 
support of the Tibetan people. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues for their support, and I urge all 
of my colleagues to support this impor-
tant legislation. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, let 
me first commend the Congressman 
from Massachusetts and his great work 
on this issue. He has been a really 
strong fighter for democracy and free-
dom-loving peoples around the world, 
whether it be the Hong Kong Democ-
racy Act or the Tibetan people and 
their persecution in China. I thank 
Chairman MCGOVERN
so much, from 
the bottom of my heart. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
YOHO), the Republican leader of the 
Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Chairman MCCAUL and Mr. PHILLIPS for 
their leadership on this. Also, Mr. 
MCGOVERN has been a strong leader on 
this, and I appreciate it. 
This is the way Congress should 
work. We come together on a common 
goal; we get things passed; and it 
makes a significant difference. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4331, the Tibetan Policy 
and Support Act of 2019. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive MCGOVERN for his work on this im-
portant and timely legislation, which 
would reauthorize the Tibetan Policy 
Act of 2002 and reaffirm our commit-
ment to the Tibetan people. 
Since the 1950 invasion of the Chinese 
PLA forces, Tibet has been a land of 
occupation and oppression. For too 
long, the Chinese Government has uti-
lized campaigns of aggression and in-
timidation in trying to silence and 
bully its neighbor and territories. 
In that regard, the people of Tibet 
have not been spared. The number of 
displaced Tibetans number in the hun-
dreds of thousands, with 110,000 taking 
refuge just in India alone. 
I join my colleagues in Congress in 
reiterating our support for Tibet, the 
Tibetan people, and the protection of 
their distinct cultural identity. 
I also believe that as one of Tibet’s 
strongest partners, the U.S. Congress 
should hear from Tibet’s political and 
spiritual leaders, which is why I intro-
duced legislation last year to invite the 
Dalai Lama to address a Joint Meeting 
of Congress via teleconference to dis-
cuss the peaceful solutions to inter-
national conflicts. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation has 
wide bipartisan support in the House. 
To the people of Tibet, know that we 
support your fight against adversity 
and for religious freedom. 
This legislation makes it clear that 
the U.S. Congress will not sit on the 
sidelines and watch as a spectator but, 
rather, advocate strongly for increased 
protections for the Tibetan people. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from the District of Columbia (Ms. 
NORTON). 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank him and my colleague on the 
other side of the aisle for this resolu-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I had the honor and 
the privilege of visiting the Dalai 
Lama, and I welcome this opportunity 
to speak of his work and the danger he 
and his people face. 
H.R. 4331 is a bipartisan and bi-
cameral bill to update and strengthen 
the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 in light 
of new human rights, religious, and en-
vironmental challenges the Tibetan 
people face today. 
In the 18 years since the original Ti-
betan Policy Act became law, human 
rights in Tibet has grown worse. The 
Chinese Government has refused any 
discussions with Tibetan leaders and 
has threatened to select Tibetan Bud-
dhist leaders, in clear violation of 
international religious freedom and Ti-
betan Buddhist practices. 
The new Tibet Policy and Support 
Act before us today writes into law 
U.S. policy that the succession or rein-
carnation of Buddhist leaders is a reli-
gious matter to be determined by the 
Tibetan Buddhist community alone. 
Among other provisions, interference 
in the process of recognizing a suc-
cessor or reincarnation of the Dalai 
Lama would result in targeted finan-
cial, economic, and visa-related sanc-
tions. 
When the Dalai Lama visited the Na-
tion’s capital in 2011, I introduced a 
resolution welcoming Tibet’s spiritual 
leader and recognizing his lifelong 
commitment to world peace and human 
rights. 
The Dalai Lama welcomed me into 
his home in 2008 as part of a congres-
sional delegation led by Speaker NANCY 
PELOSI. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
HOULAHAN). The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate the additional time. 
Tibetan children, monks, and exiles 
lined the streets to greet our delega-
tion in 2008. 
Our congressional visit heightened 
attention to continuing cultural geno-
cide and brutality in Tibet. Our delega-
tion had a meeting and lunch with the 
Nobel Prize-winning Dalai Lama and 
his government in exile. 
The Dalai Lama and his people have 
nothing to fight with except their own 
nonviolent determination and the will-
ingness of free people everywhere to 
raise their voices. 
The Tibet Policy and Support Act be-
fore us today is important to convey 
and reinforce the understanding that 
the United States will never cease 
working to assure complete freedom 
for the Dalai Lama and his people. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. SUOZZI), my friend. 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 4331, the bipar-
tisan Tibetan Policy and Support Act 
of 2019. 
By voting for this legislation, we are 
standing with the Tibetans and their 
religious and cultural way of life that 
the Chinese Government is seeking to 
eliminate. 
Since President Nixon went to China 
in 1971, most Americans have believed 
that with increased exposure to our 
economic system and to our system of 
democracy, the Chinese Government 
would become more like us. That sim-
ply hasn’t happened. 
Whether it is the Hong Kong stu-
dents, Uighur Muslims, Christians, or 
Tibetan Buddhists, China does not sup-
port our way of life. It does not support 
religious liberty. 
Freedom of religion is a fundamental 
freedom. We must raise our voices loud 
and clear for all that are harassed, im-
prisoned, 
tortured, 
persecuted, 
or 
killed seeking to live out their faith. 
An attack on religious freedom any-
where is an attack on religious freedom 
everywhere.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H599 
January 28, 2020 
Chinese officials in Tibet continue to 
severely restrict religious freedom, 
speech, movement, and assembly. They 
continue to restrict access to the 
unique cultural environment of Tibet. 
In July 2018, authorities displaced 
over 200 under-18-year-old monks from 
at least two monasteries in Tibet and 
forced them to attend government-run 
schools. 
In October 2018, Chinese Communist 
Party officials opened a new political 
education camp to train Tibetans in 
Chinese Communist Party ideology, 
particularly grassroots party-building 
and antiseparatism. 
International journalists have said 
that the isolation of Tibet is worse 
than that of North Korea, allowing the 
Chinese Government to conceal human 
rights abuses. 
The aspirations of the Tibetan people 
for dignity and freedom are viewed by 
the Chinese Government as a direct 
threat to their existence as an authori-
tarian state. 
Reeducation and surveillance meth-
ods pioneered in Tibet are being used 
to target the Uighurs in Xinjiang, 
where the Chinese Government has cre-
ated a surveillance state unlike any-
thing the world has ever seen. 
The Chinese Communist Party’s re-
pugnant campaign to destroy the cul-
tural and religious identities of Tibet-
ans and Uighurs requires more than 
just words of condemnation. We must 
stand up to any country that restricts 
individual liberty and religious free-
dom. 
This legislation would urge the ad-
ministration to place economic or visa 
sanctions against Chinese officials who 
interfere with the process of recog-
nizing the next Dalai Lama. 
Chairman MCGOVERN and I hosted a 
townhall in Queens, New York, this 
past summer with the largest Tibetan 
diaspora community, and we learned of 
their inability to visit their families in 
Tibet. 
This legislation will also direct the 
Department of State to establish a 
United States consulate in Lhasa, 
Tibet, to enable U.S. citizens better ac-
cess to Tibet. 
I am proud to be part of a legislative 
body that continues to advocate for Ti-
betans, for Uighurs, and for human 
rights and the rule of law in China. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 2 minutes to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. SUOZZI. To quote the Dalai 
Lama: ‘‘Tragedy should be utilized as a 
source of strength. No matter what 
sort of difficulties, how painful experi-
ence is, if we lose hope, that’s our real 
disaster.’’ 
The United States’ strength is in our 
values, and our policies should not be 
separated from them. We must not lose 
hope. 
b 1445 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
The United States has a longstanding 
record of bipartisan support for the Ti-
betan people. Religious tolerance is an 
American 
principle, 
an 
American 
value, and one that we must express 
around the entire world. 
I am pleased that we are moving for-
ward with a measure today that up-
dates United States policy so that we 
are not just continuing, but we are 
strengthening this support. 
I hope all Members will join me 
today in supporting this important 
measure that shows our commitment 
to preserving Tibet’s unique culture, 
lands, language, and religion. 
I am also proud of the bipartisan 
work that this Chamber has passed on 
China human rights. This is the third 
bill this Chamber has passed in recent 
months, the Hong Kong Human Rights 
and Democracy Act, and now this bill 
on Tibet. 
I urge support for this bill and pas-
sage in the Senate of each of these ter-
ribly important measures. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Again, I want to thank Chairman 
MCGOVERN for strengthening U.S. sup-
port for Tibet at this critical moment. 
As the Tibetan community prepares 
for the Dalai Lama’s succession, we 
must rein in the Communist Party’s 
attempts to destroy the autonomy of 
Tibetan Buddhism. 
I also want to thank the gentleman 
from Minnesota, and Speaker PELOSI 
for her strong support for human rights 
and religious liberties. The gentle-
woman stood on the floor when we de-
bated the Hong Kong Human Rights 
and Democracy Act. That is what we 
do as Americans: We defend freedom 
and we defend democracy. This Nation 
was formed upon the idea of religious 
freedom and religious liberty. 
Under the Communist Party of Chi-
na’s rule, religion really doesn’t exist. 
In fact, it almost prohibits religious 
freedom. It persecutes religious free-
dom. It kills religious freedom. 
The Dalai Lama himself was exiled 
to India where he is today. The Com-
munist Party of China is brutally mur-
dering and oppressing the Tibetan peo-
ple; oppressing religious freedom and 
liberty, oppressing the Uighurs where 
they sit in camps, as I speak, with no 
voice, and, yes, they suppress the 
Christian community as well. 
So, again, I want to thank my friends 
on the other side of the aisle, and I 
thank Speaker PELOSI so much for sup-
porting this legislation as we stood to-
gether to support Hong Kong and the 
people of Hong Kong. 
We spoke earlier today about sup-
porting the people of Iran against the-
ocracy and oppression, and we support 
the Tibetan people in their effort to ex-
ercise their religious freedom and lib-
erty. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ranking Member MCCAUL for his 
important words. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
PELOSI), our distinguished Speaker of 
the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for bringing this legislation to the 
floor. 
I am pleased to follow the distin-
guished ranking member of the Foreign 
Affairs Committee, Mr. MCCAUL. One of 
the joys of my service in Congress is to 
work in a bipartisan way on issues that 
relate to respecting human rights and 
religious 
freedom 
throughout 
the 
world. 
I thank Mr. MCCAUL for his leader-
ship and Chairman ELIOT ENGEL for his 
leadership 
in 
facilitating 
this 
all 
through the committee. I thank Mr. 
PHILLIPS for giving us access to the 
floor today. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 
2019, a strong, bipartisan and urgently 
needed legislation to strengthen Amer-
ica’s commitment to the Tibetan peo-
ple and their right to safeguard their 
distinct identity. 
I salute Chairman JIM
MCGOVERN, 
the chair of the Congressional-Execu-
tive Commission on China and chair of 
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Com-
mission. I thank Mr. MCGOVERN for 
being a leading voice in Congress and 
in the country for human rights. 
I thank Congressman CHRIS SMITH— 
the gentleman and I go back decades. 
He is the ranking member of the Con-
gressional-Executive Commission on 
China, and also the co-chair of the Tom 
Lantos Human Rights Commission. I 
have worked with the gentleman for 
three decades to hold China account-
able for its oppression, as well as for 
promoting human rights throughout 
the world. I thank Mr. SMITH for his 
leadership. 
I also want to acknowledge Senator 
MARCO RUBIO for his leadership in the 
United States Senate. As we discussed, 
he has been on some of the issues we 
have talked about, supporting the peo-
ple of Hong Kong, the Uighurs, and now 
this important legislation. I thank 
Senator MARCO RUBIO for his leadership 
and courage in facilitating some of this 
legislation through the Senate. 
For many of us, the fight to protect 
human rights in China has been a long- 
term commitment, as I acknowledged 
with Mr. SMITH, as well as Frank Wolf, 
our former Member who worked with 
CHRIS SMITH so closely. 
In 1987 when I first came to Congress, 
I heard Tom Lantos—we mentioned the 
Tom Lantos Human Rights Commis-
sion—he invited me to meet His Holi-
ness the Dalai Lama to be in a small 
meeting with him. I heard His Holiness 
first describe his ‘‘Middle Way Ap-
proach’’ for Tibet. It was an approach 
about autonomy, not about independ-
ence.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H600 
January 28, 2020 
So, when the Chinese say that it is 
about independence, that is not what it 
ever has been about as far as His Holi-
ness’ presentation on Capitol Hill or to 
the world. 
Among other priorities, the Dalai 
Lama proposed that Tibet be allowed 
to be a zone of peace; that the Tibetan 
people’s human rights be respected; 
and Tibet’s natural environment be 
safeguarded. 
He said: ‘‘The Tibetan people must 
once again be free to develop cul-
turally, intellectually, economically 
and spiritually and to exercise basic 
democratic freedoms.’’ 
I just wanted to acknowledge that 
because he talks about Tibet’s natural 
environment. 
His Holiness was the first Nobel Lau-
reate, the first winner of the Nobel 
Peace Prize to have presented in the 
testimonial his protection for the envi-
ronment. It has been there for a long 
time. For many of us, the fight, again, 
has been a long time. 
Twenty years after that meeting, in 
2007, and in 2008, as Speaker of the 
House, I had the privilege of visiting 
Dharamshala. 
Our 
delegation 
was 
blessed to be received by His Holiness 
the Dalai Lama, and we had the oppor-
tunity to see the aspirations of the Ti-
betan people firsthand, especially in 
the eyes of the Tibetan schoolchildren 
we met. 
It was a bipartisan delegation. We 
spoke to big crowds waving American 
flags. It was a beautiful thing. But it is 
important to note the children, the 
beautiful Tibetan children. In order for 
their children to be raised in the tradi-
tion of the Tibetan language, culture, 
and religion, parents had to send them 
from Tibet to India because, sadly, Ti-
betan aspirations of observing their 
culture are under threat because of 
brutal repression in Beijing. That was 
in 2008. 
Then in 2015, along with Chairman 
MCGOVERN, the gentleman and I led the 
first congressional delegation in dec-
ades to enter Tibet. In Jokhang Tem-
ple, Potala Palace, and Sera Mon-
astery, we again witnessed the deep 
faith of the Tibetan people and the 
beauty of their culture. 
We also saw the Potemkin Village- 
like posturing of the Chinese regime. 
For example, they said: We are going 
to invite you to a family’s home so you 
can see how Tibetan families thrive in 
their own culture, language, and reli-
gion. 
So we go to the home—and you prob-
ably have never seen this in anybody’s 
home—but they had a gigantic picture 
of President Xi in the living room. And 
then they talked about their grand-
children and that the daughter had 
taken them to school, and that is why 
they weren’t there. 
So, when the daughter then came 
back from so-called taking them to 
school, we said: Well, how are the chil-
dren? 
And she said: Children? What chil-
dren? 
They had these fake visits to homes 
to show us how they were respecting 
Tibetan culture. 
And then years later in 2017, I led an-
other bipartisan delegation, this time 
to Nepal in India, where we were 
blessed to be received by His Holiness 
the Dalai Lama again. We saw once 
more the beautiful children again wav-
ing American flags, but no closer to an 
autonomous Tibet. 
Today, we are here to pass the Ti-
betan Policy and Support Act. In 2002, 
Congress passed the Tibetan Policy Act 
to support the aspirations of the Ti-
betan people to safeguard their distinct 
identity, as His Holiness had suggested. 
But in the years since, China has cru-
elly accelerated its outrageous aggres-
sion against the Tibetan people. As the 
CECC, 
the 
Congressional-Executive 
Commission on China concluded in its 
most recent report, Beijing is increas-
ing Sinicization efforts and restricting 
the religious freedom of Tibetan Bud-
dhists, including with mandatory polit-
ical education for religious leaders, 
large-scale evictions from Buddhist 
monasteries, and by replacing images 
of the His Holiness the Dalai Lama 
with past and current party leaders. 
The report also concludes that Bei-
jing is expanding a massive surveil-
lance regime to intimidate Tibetans 
and prevent them from practicing their 
culture or observing their religion. We 
could see the cameras every place we 
went, especially near the monasteries. 
Pursuing 
massive 
infrastructure 
projects—I have seen that over the 
years. And we fought some of this in 
the World Bank then with Chris Cox 
and others here then on the Republican 
side of the aisle, working together— 
pursuing 
massive 
infrastructure 
projects that violate the social, eco-
nomic, and cultural rights of Tibetans, 
forcing scores of families from their 
homes and even detaining monks for 
peaceful protest. 
And tightening access to Tibet for 
international 
visitors. 
International 
journalists have stated that the isola-
tion of Tibet is worse than North 
Korea, allowing the Chinese Govern-
ment to conceal human rights abuses 
and environmentally damaging large- 
scale projects. 
Today, the House is taking action to 
update and strengthen the Tibetan Pol-
icy Act to address these growing 
threats. 
We are supporting the Tibetan peo-
ple’s right to religious freedom and 
genuine autonomy by formally estab-
lishing a U.S. policy that the Tibetan 
Buddhist 
community 
has 
exclusive 
right to choose its religious leaders, in-
cluding a future 15th Dalai Lama. 
Imagine that the Chinese Govern-
ment should think that they should be 
choosing the next Dalai Lama of the 
Tibetan Buddhists. 
We are sending Beijing a clear signal 
that they will be held accountable for 
interfering in Tibet’s religious and cul-
tural affairs, making it clear that Chi-
nese officials who meddle in the proc-
ess of recognizing the new Dalai Lama 
will be subject to targeted sanctions, 
including 
those 
in 
the 
Global 
Magnitsky Act. 
We are protecting Tibet’s environ-
mental and cultural rights, working 
with international governments and 
the business community to ensure the 
self-sufficiency of the Tibetan people 
and protect the environment and water 
resources of the Tibetan Plateau. This 
is really very important to the sustain-
ability of our planet. 
This legislation also deploys Amer-
ica’s diplomatic weight to encourage a 
genuine dialogue between Tibetan lead-
ers and Beijing. It is unacceptable that 
the Chinese Government still refuses to 
enter into a dialogue with Tibetan 
leaders. 
b 1500 
Congress will—and must—continue 
to take action to hold China account-
able for its many abuses which sadly 
target so many, including the Uighur 
community—which Mr. MCCAUL
and 
Mr. RUBIO
in a bipartisan way had 
acted 
upon—which 
faces 
horrific 
human rights abuses, including forced 
sterilizations and the mass incarcer-
ation of millions. This is happening as 
we speak. Millions of people are sub-
jected to this in China. 
And, as we know, the current party 
chairman of the Uighur Autonomous 
Region, Secretary Chen, previously 
served as the top party official of the 
Tibetan Autonomous Region. So op-
pressive was he, they rewarded him by 
sending him to the Uighur Autonomous 
Region. That is so sad. 
We also see human rights abuses, as 
we know, in Hong Kong, where millions 
are fighting for the democratic free-
doms they were promised and, on the 
mainland, where journalists, human 
rights lawyers, Christians, and democ-
racy advocates languish in jail cells. 
Today, in the face of rising oppres-
sion in China, Congress has an urgent 
responsibility to act. Sikyong Dr. 
Lobsang Sangay, the President of the 
Central Tibetan Administration, has 
said that, ‘‘The very survival of Ti-
betan culture and identity is in peril.’’ 
Madam Speaker, if we don’t speak 
out for human rights in China because 
of commercial interests, then we lose 
all moral authority to speak out for 
human rights anyplace in the world. 
As I have said on this floor to those 
who take the repressive Chinese Gov-
ernment’s side, we ask: What does it 
profit a man to have gained the whole 
world and suffers the loss of his soul? 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong vote 
for this legislation and support the Ti-
betan people as they seek to defend 
their culture and their identity and to 
pursue a future of freedom of religion 
and dignity. 
I thank, again, the members of the 
Foreign Affairs Committee for giving 
us the opportunity to talk about Tibet 
on the floor of the House today. 
Repression in Tibet by the Chinese 
Government is a challenge to the con-
science of the world. Let’s take this 
step to address that challenge.

KEEPING GIRLS IN SCHOOL ACT 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 2153) to support empower-
ment, economic security, and edu-
cational opportunities for adolescent 
girls around the world, and for other 
purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2153 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS. 
(a) SHORT TITLE.—This Act may be cited as 
the ‘‘Keeping Girls in School Act’’. 
(b) TABLE OF CONTENTS.—The table of con-
tents for this Act is as follows: 
Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. 
Sec. 2. Appropriate congressional commit-
tees defined. 
Sec. 3. Findings. 
Sec. 4. Sense of Congress. 
Sec. 5. Secondary education for adolescent 
girls. 
Sec. 6. Global strategy requirement. 
Sec. 7. Transparency and reporting to Con-
gress. 
SEC. 2. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMIT-
TEES DEFINED. 
In this Act, the term ‘‘appropriate congres-
sional committees’’ means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
the Committee on Appropriations of the 
House of Representatives; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
Senate. 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Adolescence is a critical period in a 
girl’s life, when significant physical, emo-
tional, and social changes shape her future. 
(2) Adolescent girls are particularly vul-
nerable to HIV/AIDS, child, early and forced 
marriage, and other forms of violence which 
are detrimental to their futures, as evi-
denced by the following statistics: 
(A) Each year, 380,000 adolescent girls and 
young women become newly infected with 
HIV, more than 1,000 every day, and comprise 
the fastest-growing demographic for new in-
fections in sub-Saharan Africa. 
(B) Each year, 12,000,000 adolescent girls 
around the world are married before their 
18th birthday, and more than 650,000,000 
women alive today were married as children. 
(C) Child marriages often interrupt school-
ing, limit opportunities, and impact the 
physical, psychological and social well-being 
of such girls. If there is no reduction in child 
marriage, the global number of women mar-
ried as children is projected to increase by 
150,000,000 by 2030. 
(D) One-quarter to one-half of girls in de-
veloping countries become mothers before 
the age of 18, and girls under 15 are five 
times more likely to die during childbirth 
than women in their 20s. 
(3) Approximately 130,000,000 girls around 
the world are not in school, and millions 
more are failing to acquire basic reading, 
writing, and numeracy skills. 
(4) Girls between the ages of 10 and 19 are 
three times more likely than boys to be kept 
out of school, particularly in countries af-
fected by conflict. 
(5) Due to discriminatory gender norms 
and expectations, disparities in access to 
safe and quality education manifest early in 
a girl’s life and continue to become more 
pronounced throughout adolescence. 
(6) Girls living with disabilities are less 
likely to start school and transition to sec-
ondary school than boys living with disabil-
ities and other children, and just 1 percent of 
women with disabilities are literate globally. 
(7) While two-thirds of all countries have 
achieved gender parity in primary education, 
only 40 percent have achieved gender parity 
in secondary education. 
(8) Adolescent girls who remain in school 
are more likely to live longer, marry later, 
have healthier children, and, as adults, earn 
an income to support their families, thereby 
contributing to the economic advancement 
of communities and nations. 
(9) Since July 2015, more than 100 public- 
private partnerships have been formed be-
tween the United States Government and ex-
ternal partners to support innovative and 
community-led solutions in targeted coun-
tries, including Malawi and Tanzania, to en-
sure adolescent girls receive a quality edu-
cation. 
(10) The United States Global Strategy to 
Empower Adolescent Girls, published in 
March 2016, has brought together the Depart-
ment of State, the United States Agency for 
International Development, the Peace Corps, 
and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, 
as well as other agencies and programs such 
as the President’s Emergency Fund for AIDS 
Relief (PEPFAR), to address the range of 
challenges preventing adolescent girls from 
attaining an inclusive and equitable quality 
education leading to relevant learning out-
comes. 
(11) According to the United States Global 
Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls, 
which is the first foreign policy document in 
the world solely dedicated to the rights and 
empowerment of girls globally, ‘‘[w]hile the 
Millennium Development Goals improved 
outcomes for girls in primary education, 
they also highlighted the need for a targeted 
focus on adolescents and young adults, par-
ticularly regarding the transition to and 
completion of secondary school’’. 
(12) PEPFAR, through its DREAMS (Deter-
mined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, 
Mentored, and Safe) Initiative, has worked 
to address a number of the specific barriers 
to education that adolescent girls face. 
SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) every child, regardless of place of birth, 
deserves an equal opportunity to access qual-
ity education; 
(2) the United States has been a global 
leader in efforts to expand and improve edu-
cational opportunities for those who have 
been traditionally disenfranchised, particu-
larly women and girls; 
(3) gains with respect to girls’ secondary 
education and empowerment have been prov-
en to correlate strongly with progress in 
gender equality and women’s rights, as well 
as economic and social progress, and achiev-
ing gender equality should be a priority goal 
of United States foreign policy; 
(4) achieving gender parity in both access 
to and quality of educational opportunity 
contributes 
significantly 
to 
economic 
growth and development, thereby lowering 
the risk for violence and instability; and 
(5) education is a lifesaving humanitarian 
intervention that protects the lives, futures, 
and well-being of girls.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Minnesota. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2153. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Keeping Girls in School 
Act, and I want to thank my dear 
friend and colleague, Representative 
LOIS FRANKEL, for her hard work on 
this bill. 
Access to education should not de-
pend on whether a child is a boy or a 
girl. Yet around the world, 130 million 
girls are kept out of school. Fifteen 
million girls of primary school age will 
never enter a classroom. 
Think of what that means for their 
futures and for their ability to lead 
prosperous lives. 
We know what a difference just a few 
years of school makes. On average, 
when a girl in the developing world re-
ceives 7 years of education, she marries 
4 years later and has fewer children. 
Better educated women tend to be 
healthier and live longer, and women 
with secondary school education earn 
almost twice as much as those with no 
education at all. 
When women and girls have access to 
education, they lift up their entire 
communities. In societies that make 
strides in education equality, we see 
better health outcomes, improved eco-
nomic well-being, and greater security 
for everyone. That is why getting more 
girls in classrooms should be a foreign 
policy priority of the United States of 
America. It is the right thing to do. It 
also helps drive stability and pros-
perity in the long run. 
But today, too many still face bar-
riers like harassment, early marriage, 
disabilities, and lack of access to hy-
giene. These barriers conspire against 
girls succeeding, particularly adoles-
cent girls. 
This bill highlights those barriers to 
keeping girls in school all around the 
world and requires USAID to support 
activities addressing them throughout 
their existing work and into the future. 
I am very proud to support H.R. 2153, 
and I am grateful to Members on both 
sides of the aisle for helping push it 
forward. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the Keeping Girls in School 
Act. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
FRANKEL
and Representative BROOKS 
for their leadership on this legislation. 
The United States has been a global 
leader in funding programs to support 
women and girls from around the 
world. We recognize the importance of 
empowering women to succeed, and 
that starts with receiving an edu-
cation. 
This legislation codifies the existing 
U.S. strategy to empower adolescent 
girls, which coordinates efforts be-
tween 
the 
Department 
of 
State, 
USAID, the Millennium Challenge Cor-
poration, 
the 
Peace 
Corps, 
and 
PEPFAR to ensure that our develop-
ment assistance programs are address-
ing barriers to girls’ attendance in 
schools. It also supports efforts to en-
sure girls receive a quality secondary 
education and have the support nec-
essary to stay in school. 
We know that when women and girls 
are educated and supported, they are 
more likely to invest in their families 
and in their communities. 
Last year, I was honored to travel to 
Cote d’Ivoire to launch the Women’s 
Global Development and Prosperity 
Initiative alongside Ivanka Trump and 
a Senate delegation. W-GDP seeks to 
reach 50 million women in the devel-
oping world by 2025 through efforts to 
empower and enable women to be en-
trepreneurs and productive members of 
the workforce.

January 28, 2020 
I was also proud to be a cosponsor of 
the 
Women’s 
Entrepreneurship 
and 
Economic Empowerment Act which 
was signed into law last year. We must 
continue our bipartisan efforts to en-
sure United States’ support for women 
and girls around the world is strong. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the Keeping Girls in 
School Act, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. FRANKEL), who is the 
author of this important bill and my 
dear friend. 
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Minnesota for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I want to start by 
thanking my very good friend, SUSAN 
BROOKS. Over the past 7 years together 
we have been involved in many efforts 
to advance women and girls. It is an 
honor to work with the gentlewoman. 
I thank my other colleagues for the 
support to bring this bill to the floor. 
It is a bipartisan, bicameral bill. It is 
sponsored by Senators MURKOWSKI and 
SHAHEEN in the Senate. It is called the 
Keeping Girls in School Act. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to start 
with a question: 
Why should Americans even care 
that there are 130 million girls around 
the world who are kept out of school? 
That a young girl in a Malawi village 
is too frightened to walk miles to a 
secondary school for fear of sexual as-
sault? 
Or that a 12-year-old girl in Mozam-
bique is forced to marry and denied 
schooling? 
Or that hundreds of girls are kid-
napped from school by Boko Haram 
terrorists who believe women should be 
cooks or sex slaves? 
Or care about the 14-year-old in Paki-
stan, Malala Yousafzai, shot in the 
head by the Taliban because she want-
ed girls to be educated? 
So why should Americans care that 
there are 130 million girls around the 
world who are kept out of school? 
Madam Speaker, there are 130 mil-
lion reasons to care. According to the 
Malala Fund, the international non-
profit organization that fights for girl’s 
education, cofounded by Malala, girls’ 
education strengthens economies and 
creates jobs. Millions of girls being 
educated means there are more work-
ing women with the potential to add up 
to trillions of dollars in global growth. 
When girls are educated, commu-
nities are more stable and can recover 
faster from conflict. Extremism grows 
alongside inequality. When a country 
gives all its children secondary edu-
cation they cut their risk of war in 
half. 
Educated girls are healthier citizens 
who raise healthier families. They are 
less likely to marry young or to con-
tract HIV, and they are more likely to 
have healthy, educated children. Each 
additional year of school a girl com-
pletes cuts both infant mortality and 
child marriage rates. 
Madam Speaker, when the Keeping 
Girls in School Act is put into full 
force, it will mean that countries 
where girls are educated will be more 
peaceful, making violent conflicts less 
likely and countries more prosperous, 
allowing them to be more self-reliant 
and participate in international trade. 
This means a safer and more economi-
cally vibrant world. 
The Keeping Girls in School Act rec-
ognizes the progress made in closing 
the gender gap for primary education 
in developing countries like Vietnam, 
Tunisia, and Nepal, and recognizes that 
we must do more to advance our young 
girls around the world. 
This 
legislation 
focuses 
on 
the 
unique obstacles keeping adolescent 
girls from accessing quality education 
at the secondary level. It will give 
USAID innovative tools and new fund-
ing mechanisms to address and reduce 
barriers that keep girls out of school— 
barriers like female genital mutilation, 
sexual violence, HIV infection, family 
obligations, and lack of safety. 
This legislation would also codify 
and require updates to the U.S. Global 
Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls, 
bringing together civil society organi-
zations, the private sector, and govern-
ments around the world to prepare 
girls to become the leaders of tomor-
row. 
I am going to end today, Madam 
Speaker, by paraphrasing a poem about 
a young girl’s plea to her father in 
Kenya. It goes something like this: 
Father says to her: You are grown up, and I 
am going to marry you off. 
I say: I don’t want a husband. 
Our fathers say: A daughter is good because 
we marry her off and we get a crate of 
beer. 
Our mothers say: A daughter is good; the 
bridegroom will surely buy us presents. 
And I, the daughter, say: Mother, father, 
give me an education because a hus-
band without an education is nothing. 
Father, look at other communities that have 
educated their daughters and reap good 
fruit. 
Father says: I will take my beloved sons to 
school and my beloved daughters will 
look after the cattle. 
I say: O, father, let the daughter go to 
school. 
Educating a girl is educating a nation. 
Misery will surely be a thing of the past. 
And goodness will spread like a good aroma. 
Let’s surely then educate the daughter. 
Madam Speaker, when our daughters 
are educated, the world will change for 
the better. 
I urge support of this very good bill, 
the Keeping Girls in School Act. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Indiana (Mrs. BROOKS), who is the 
lead Republican cosponsor of this bill. 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of H.R. 2153, the Keeping Girls in 
School Act. 
I want to thank my very good friend 
from Florida, Representative FRANKEL, 
for championing this incredibly impor-
tant legislation, and also my colleague, 
Representative MCCAUL of Texas, for 
helping ensure that this was through 
the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
I am the mother of a daughter, and 
from birth I let her know that she 
could be anything she wanted to be. If 
she wanted to be a lawyer, a doctor, a 
nurse, a teacher, or an engineer, she 
could do whatever she wanted. 
We all know too well that many girls 
around the world are not so lucky. As 
my 
good 
friend, 
Representative 
FRANKEL, just talked about, Malala of 
Pakistan was shot at the age of 15 re-
turning from school. I am very proud 
that the Children’s Museum of Indian-
apolis in my home of Indianapolis will 
be inducting her into the Power of 
Children 
Exhibit, 
because 
she 
has 
fought for the human rights of girls 
and children being able to go to school. 
She was shot returning from school, 
and the Malala Fund is now focusing 
on her activism and trying to make 
sure that girls have the right to go to 
school. 
As we have learned, 130 million girls 
don’t have the opportunity to go to 
school, and it is impossible for them to 
consider their big dreams and goals. So 
this bill is about breaking down these 
barriers that women and girls face in 
attending and staying in school. 
b 1515 
We know that the evidence has al-
ready shown, if we can keep girls in 
secondary 
education, 
it 
can 
boost 
economies of low- and middle-income 
nations by as much as $92 billion, an-
nually. It can cut childhood deaths by 
50 percent, annually. It can reduce vio-
lent conflict in countries, and it can re-
duce child marriage by 66 percent, an-
nually. 
Studies show that girls between the 
ages of 10 and 19 are three times more 
likely than boys to be kept out of 
school, particularly in these countries 
where there is so much conflict. Yet, if 
we keep girls in school past fourth 
grade—and we are trying to get them 
through high school—we know that 
their wages will rise, their countries 
will be better, their communities will 
be better. 
With our foreign investments, why 
wouldn’t we want to take all of the in-
credible aid that we provide and make 
sure that there are strategies in place 
to make sure that girls get education? 
This bill outlines that inexhaustible 
list of 14 barriers that keep girls from 
entering and remaining in secondary 
school. So let’s bring together the 
State 
Department, 
USAID, 
Peace 
Corps, 
Millennium 
Challenge, 
and 
PEPFAR to address those challenges. 
We know that young girls like 
Malala, who is leading the way, is a 
child who is so powerful in her voice 
because of what she went through. We 
know that, when girls succeed, nations 
and our world will succeed. 
Madam Speaker, thank you, and I 
urge passage. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. HOULAHAN),

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H604 
January 28, 2020 
my friend and colleague on the Foreign 
Affairs Committee. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, 
when I rise for women and girls around 
the world, I do so with the awareness 
that the barriers that we face do not 
exist in a vacuum, that a woman’s 
right to education, to bodily auton-
omy, and to self-determination are all 
connected. To combat these barriers, 
we must enact comprehensive legisla-
tion that relies on years of data, stud-
ies, and advocacy efforts to establish a 
truly equal world across gender lines. 
According to UN Women, every addi-
tional year of primary school increases 
girls’ eventual wages by 10 to 20 per-
cent. It also encourages them to marry 
later, to have fewer children, and 
leaves them less vulnerable to vio-
lence. 
In our effort to achieve gender par-
ity, it is crucial that we work with 
international partners and global orga-
nizations 
that 
are 
making 
great 
progress on this issue. Initiatives like 
the U.N. Joint Program to End Child 
Marriage are looking at this issue ho-
listically, with the understanding that 
social protection, health, education, 
and social and behavioral change must 
all be addressed in order to spark sus-
tainable changes for women and girls 
around the world. That is why I co-
sponsored the Keeping Girls in School 
Act, which would empower girls by in-
creasing their educational opportuni-
ties and economic security. 
Girls and women deserve to be edu-
cated, to be economically independent, 
and to be the deciders of their own 
fate, and that is what we believe in the 
United States, and that is what we 
need to fight for in all corners of this 
world. I encourage all of my colleagues 
on both sides of this aisle to join me 
and to take a stand for women and 
girls across the globe. 
The first step on the path to a more 
peaceful world starts with the em-
powerment of women and girls. A vote 
for the Keeping Girls in School Act is 
a vote for equality, for empowerment, 
and for a safer and more prosperous 
world for us all. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, yes-
terday in this Chamber we honored the 
life of a dear friend of mine, a col-
league I came into the Congress with in 
2005, Michael Fitzpatrick, and it was 
quite an honor to know him and to call 
him my friend. With that, I want to 
yield as much time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. FITZPATRICK), his brother and a 
member of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
I want to thank my friend and my col-
league, Mr. MCCAUL, for yielding and 
for his kind words and for his friend-
ship. 
Madam Speaker, first, I want to 
thank the entire committee, including 
yourself, Madam Speaker, Representa-
tive 
FRANKEL, 
and 
Representative 
BROOKS, for all of your and their work 
on this very, very important issue. 
As a co-chair of the bipartisan Inter-
national Basic Education Caucus, I 
want to join with all of our colleagues 
today to voice our strong support for 
H.R. 2153, the Keeping Girls in School 
Act, a bill that many of us helped in-
troduce. 
Today, as was echoed earlier, many 
girls worldwide are not in school, and 
this bill will work to close the gender 
gap between boys and girls and work to 
keep girls in school through the high 
school level, when girls are at the high-
est risk of dropping out. 
This is a commitment of the U.S. to 
support programs, policies, and re-
sources to help vulnerable girls stay in 
school. This bill will provide results- 
based aid grants, lower the cost of sec-
ondary education, and make sure that 
schools are safe for all of our children. 
We must work to ensure that girls in 
every country are able to stay in 
school so that we can empower them in 
order to reduce poverty and create 
safer, 
healthier 
communities. 
The 
Keeping Girls in School Act will help 
reduce barriers girls around the world 
face when trying to remain in school 
and help them access more opportuni-
ties. 
Madam Speaker, the top line sum-
mary of H.R. 2153 states this bill is ‘‘to 
support empowerment, economic secu-
rity, and educational opportunities for 
adolescent girls around the world.’’ 
However, this bill will do much more 
than that. This bill provides oppor-
tunity. This bill provides hope. This 
bill will give some of our most vulner-
able a chance to succeed. 
As Madam Speaker said earlier, we 
need to be a voice for the voiceless. 
And, Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
you for doing just that, yourself and 
Representative BROOKS, because these 
130 million girls, they need a voice, and 
we are going to be that voice for them 
here today. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. WALTZ), a distinguished 
member of the United States military 
who served our country so well over-
seas in some very dangerous places. 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of this impor-
tant legislation. 
Every child deserves access to a qual-
ity education—every child—and, unfor-
tunately, that is not always the case 
for girls around the world. Adolescent 
girls, in particular, are most at risk of 
dropping out of school. 
Worldwide, there are about 61 million 
girls between the ages of 6 and 14 who 
are not in school, and that is unaccept-
able. It is just unacceptable. 
Madam Speaker, as a Green Beret 
who has operated all over the world, I 
have seen this up close and personal. I 
have seen this firsthand. I can tell you 
this from my experiences: I know first-
hand that, where women thrive in busi-
ness, where women thrive in civil soci-
ety, in politics, and in government, ex-
tremism doesn’t. That is it. Where 
women thrive in all of those places, the 
extremists do not. 
So this isn’t just an economic issue, 
although that is a very important one, 
or a humanitarian issue. This is a na-
tional security issue—for the United 
States of America, for the Western 
world, for the entire world. 
For me, in one of my combat tours in 
Afghanistan, an Afghan elder I knew, 
whom I developed a relationship with 
throughout this tour, in every meeting 
kept talking about his secret weapon, 
his secret weapon. This was how we 
were going to defeat the Taliban and 
defeat the extremists, with this secret 
weapon. 
I finally demanded to see this secret 
weapon. It wasn’t a missile. It wasn’t a 
weapon, per se, at all. It was his teen-
age daughters. That was his secret 
weapon. What he was doing was he was 
sneaking them out of Afghanistan and 
over to India to be trained as a lawyer 
and a doctor. 
He pointed to them and said: Com-
mander MIKE, this is how we are going 
to defeat the extremists. This is how 
we are going to win. 
So I echo my colleagues who have 
mentioned the hero Malala Yousafzai. 
My favorite quote from her is: ‘‘Ex-
tremists have shown what frightens 
them most: a girl with a book.’’ 
So as a father of a young woman who 
is here with me today on the floor, 
about to turn 16, this is personal for 
me. This legislation is especially im-
portant to me. And every girl around 
the world, like her, deserves the chance 
to attend school and access a proper 
education. This legislation is a critical 
step in increasing these opportunities 
for young women, globally. 
I want to commend my colleague and 
fellow Floridian, Madam Speaker, Rep-
resentative FRANKEL, for her leadership 
on this issue. I also want to thank 
Ivanka Trump for her leadership. 
Girls’ education and women’s em-
powerment should not be a partisan 
issue at all. It is an American issue. It 
is one of leadership, and it is one of 
human rights, of basic human rights. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
We have heard some really powerful 
testimony about the rights and the 
role of women throughout the world, 
and I think back to my own time as a 
counterterrorism Federal prosecutor, 
to chairman of the Homeland Security 
Committee, and now my role on the 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Committee. 
Where 
women are oppressed, democracy and 
freedom is oppressed. Where extremism 
exists, the rights of women are denied. 
I also want to thank you, Madam 
Speaker, Ms. FRANKEL, for your leader-
ship in bringing this bill to the floor. 
It is a national security issue. I real-
ly view it that way because, where 
women are empowered, we don’t have 
extremism. 
Chairman ENGEL and I will be at the 
Canadian Embassy this night talking 
about the Global Fragility Act and the 
ONE Campaign and Bono’s efforts to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H605 
January 28, 2020 
stabilize the world, stabilize this whole 
region from extremism. What we found, 
whether it was Boko Haram taking 270 
Catholic grade school girls hostage, to 
the Taliban raining down on educated 
women or women trying to get an edu-
cation, to the story of Ms. Yousafzai, 
to killing women in the streets, it is 
absolutely unacceptable. 
I am proud today that we stand as 
Americans and not as partisans stand-
ing for the rights of young women. I 
have four daughters myself, and they 
live in freedom, and they know edu-
cation is important. But women around 
the world deserve this right. Regard-
less of where you are born, women and 
girls around the world deserve this 
right. 
We have seen it from Afghanistan, to 
the Sahel, to Pakistan and, really, all 
over the world. I think the number, 130 
million. I love the quote that the big-
gest threat to extremism is a girl with 
a book. That is what we are going to 
change. 
Madam Speaker, thank you for your 
boldness and your courage and leader-
ship in bringing this to the floor, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume for the purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
you, 
Congresswoman 
FRANKEL, 
for 
your hard work on this measure. You 
have been a tireless advocate for 
women and girls here at home and all 
around the world. 
I also want to thank the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. WALTZ), my col-
league, who had brought his daughter 
here to the floor moments ago in a 
heartwarming gesture. I, too, am a fa-
ther of two extraordinary daughters, 
Daniela and Pia. They have received 
the blessings of education and know 
how lucky they are. They, like me and 
like so many of us here in the U.S. 
House of Representatives, know how 
important it is to extend that same 
blessing to every girl around the world. 
That is why this is one of those areas 
in which American leadership is vitally 
important. 
The benefits of supporting education 
for women and girls are as clear as can 
be. But more than that, helping more 
people live up to their potential and to 
pursue their dreams is a great reflec-
tion of our values, the values that 
should be at the very center of Amer-
ican foreign policy. Girls’ education 
must be made a strategic development 
priority. 
This is a good measure, which I am 
pleased to support, and I urge all of my 
colleagues to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
FRANKEL). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) that the 
House suspend the rules and pass the 
bill, H.R. 2153, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

PROVIDING FOR A JOINT SESSION 
OF 
CONGRESS 
TO 
RECEIVE 
A 
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I send 
to the desk a privileged concurrent res-
olution and ask for its immediate con-
sideration. 
The Clerk read the concurrent reso-
lution, as follows: 
H. CON RES. 86 
Resolved by the House of Representatives (the 
Senate concurring), That the two Houses of 
Congress assemble in the Hall of the House 
of Representatives on Tuesday, February 4, 
2020, at 9 p.m., for the purpose of receiving 
such communication as the President of the 
United States shall be pleased to make to 
them. 
The concurrent resolution was agreed 
to. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING 
VICTIMS OF THE KOBE BRYANT 
HELICOPTER CRASH 
(Mr. ROUDA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in solidarity with the California 
delegation to speak about the terrible 
loss our community has endured and to 
honor the lives of those who perished 
on Sunday. 
We are all heartbroken by the loss of 
life, as this week our neighbors lost 
parents, children, friends, coaches, and 
heroes in a horrific accident: Alyssa, 
Keri, and John Altobelli; Gianna and 
Kobe Bryant; Payton and Sarah Ches-
ter; 
Christina 
Mauser; 
and 
Ara 
Zobayan. 
They were all connected by a love of 
the game, a steadfast belief in sports 
being bigger than a score, more than 
just an hour or two on the court. 
The parents we lost knew all too well 
that the early morning 
wake-ups, 
sweaty car rides, and late nights in a 
gym were worth the lessons they in-
stilled in their children: teamwork, 
dedication, and faith. 
Our community lost kids who were 
overflowing with promise; kids who 
were great competitors and even better 
friends; kids you could count on, on 
and off the court; kids who pushed 
themselves to be more and who were 
the best daughters that any parent 
could ask for. 
All of us wish they could play an-
other game. 
Orange County is grieving, but we 
will find solace and purpose in the ex-
ample they left behind and the belief in 
something bigger than ourselves. 
I ask that in Orange County and 
across our Nation, we think of the lives 
lost, 
in 
neighborhood 
basketball 
courts, school gyms, NBA arenas, and 
wherever the game is played. 
May God bless their families, and 
may our community come together to 
offer them this support in this trying 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. WATERS), 
my distinguished colleague. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I stand 
today on behalf of all Californians; cer-
tainly, the entire city of Los Angeles; 
and millions of fans worldwide who are 
mourning the sudden and tragic loss of 
one of the greatest athletes we have 
ever known: Kobe Bryant. 
Celebrated as a king in Los Angeles, 
Kobe’s death is deeply painful for our 
city and his millions of fans every-
where. 
For decades, he dazzled generations 
of fans and aspiring athletes, leaving a 
legacy as a prolific athlete, devoted 
husband, loving father, and philan-
thropist that will never be forgotten. 
This tragic event is made worse by 
the death of his 13-year-old daughter, 
Gianna Bryant, a beautiful young lady 
who was so full of life and potential. 
Our hearts go out to his wife, 
Vanessa; surviving daughters, Bianka, 
Natalia, and Capri; relatives; team-
mates; and friends. 
On behalf of the California delega-
tion, we lift up the names of Kobe Bry-
ant; his beloved daughter, Gianna; and 
all the victims of this horrible tragedy 
in prayer and reverence. We send our 
deepest condolences to their loved 
ones, now and forever. 
Mr. ROUDA. Mr. Speaker, I ask that 
all Members and guests in the gallery 
rise for a moment of silence.

Mr. STEWART. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent to remove my-

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
GRANDMASTER KEVIN THOMPSON 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a true warrior from my 
district, Grandmaster Kevin Thomp-
son. Grandmaster Thompson was a son 
of Newark and a world-famous martial 
artist. 
He was a lightweight fighter at 155 
pounds who defeated many heavy-
weight challengers. 
In his time, he won more than 100 
trophies at world championships in 
three disciplines: weapons, forms, and 
fighting. 
Today, he is in the Black Belt Hall of 
Fame alongside noted martial artists 
Bruce Lee and Chuck Norris. Through 
his skill, he earned the rank of 
grandmaster, a rare honor for his 
achievements and contributions to the 
sport. 
Grandmaster 
Kevin 
Thompson’s 
bravery and courage helped him battle 
Lou Gehrig’s disease until his passing 
on January 8, but that will not dim the 
bright legacy he left in the world of 
martial arts and in our Newark com-
munity.

RECOGNIZING HARLEY WHEELER 
ON HIS RUGBY ACHIEVEMENTS 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Harley Wheeler, an 
outstanding rugby player from Knox-
ville, Tennessee. His granddad, Roy, 
and 
his 
grandmother—he 
recently 
lost—Alice, were dear friends of mine. 
Harley played rugby since he was 14 
and is now one of the top players in the 
United States. Harley began his rugby 
career with the South Doyle Rugby 
Club while a student at South-Doyle 
High School. In 2015, he enrolled at Life 
University to compete on its rugby 
team at the collegiate level. 
Harley’s 4 years on the Life Univer-
sity rugby team were incredibly suc-
cessful. The team advanced to the Divi-
sion 1A College Rugby National Cham-
pionship match every year he was on 
the team, and won the championship in 
2016, 2018, and 2019. 
After graduating with a degree in 
business, Harley was selected to rep-
resent the United States on the inter-
national stage at the 2019 Pan Amer-
ican Games in Lima, Peru. Team USA 
finished third at the games, defeating 
Brazil 24–19. Harley scored 10 points 
during the bronze medal match. 
As we approach the 2020 Summer 
Olympics, I wish Harley the best of 
luck as he competes for a spot on the 
national rugby team. I hope to see him 
representing Knoxville and the United 
States in Japan. 
f 
PREVENT DOMESTIC EXTREMISM 
(Mr. MALINOWSKI asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, 
last week in my New Jersey district I 
hosted a briefing with over 80 faith 
leaders: Jewish, Christian, Muslim, 
Hindu, and Sikh. We didn’t discuss how 
to build a better world. We just talked 
about how to protect their houses of 
worship from violence. 
Whether a synagogue in Pittsburgh, 
a mosque in New Zealand, a shopping 
mall in Texas, or a Jewish deli in New 
Jersey, people are being targeted for 
who they are, for what they believe. 
Last year, Congress did something to 
help. We restored funding to the De-
partment of Homeland Security to pre-
vent domestic extremism—including 
violent acts of anti-Semitism—which 
the Trump administration cut in 2017. 
This has allowed DHS to substantially 
increase the number of staff working 
with State and local governments to 
stop these attacks. 
This year, there is more to be done, 
from stepping up investigations and 
prosecutions of domestic terrorists, to 
designating 
transnational 
neo-Nazi 
groups as terrorist organizations, to 
confronting social media companies 
over algorithms that amplify hate. 
Let’s make this a priority in 2020 
until no one need be afraid anymore. 
f 
NATIONAL SLAVERY AND HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING 
PREVENTION 
MONTH 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize National Slavery 
and Human Trafficking Prevention 
Month. 
Globally, there are over 40 million 
victims of human trafficking at any 
given time, 75 percent of them women 
and girls, and 25 percent are children. 
While 81 percent are trapped in forced 
labor, millions more are in forced sex-
ual exploitation and forced marriages. 
Not only is human trafficking at epi-
demic levels overseas, but it is also ex-
periencing rampant growth in our own 
backyard. 
Statistics rank the State of Florida 
as the third highest trafficking des-
tination in the U.S. Human trafficking 
traps millions of the most vulnerable 
members of society into modern-day 
slavery and generates annual profits of 
$150 billion. 
Events like the February Super Bowl 
in Miami are major targets. It is im-
perative that we give law enforcement 
the tools needed to identify and pre-
vent human trafficking. 
We also need to pass legislation that 
deters and punishes the perpetrators 
and allows the victims to heal and re-
acclimate. 
This rapidly growing issue demands 
our attention. Let’s work together, no 
matter which side of the aisle we sit 
on, to end this evil for good. 
f 
RECOGNIZING JAMIE DURRENCE 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. 
Jamie Durrence who has been selected 
to serve as the 2020 chair of the Georgia 
Restaurant Association Board of Direc-
tors. 
I can’t think of someone more de-
serving of this responsibility. In his 
more than 20 years managing res-
taurants in Savannah, he has rejuve-
nated 
Savannah’s 
restaurant 
scene 
with four restaurants that serve fresh 
ingredients, 
unique 
menus, 
quality 
service, and overall exceptional dining 
experiences. 
Much of Mr. Durrence’s penchant for 
the restaurant industry stems from his 
youth when he was raised on a working 
farm just outside of Savannah. 
As chairman of the Georgia Res-
taurant Association Board of Direc-
tors, Mr. Durrence will be tasked as 
the chief spokesperson for the industry 
and will be an integral part of the 
statewide events. 
I know that the Georgia restaurant 
industry is in good hands with Mr. 
Durrence. 
Congratulations, Mr. Durrence. Keep 
up the good work.

HONORING BRETT MILAM FOR 
DONATING HIS KIDNEY 
(Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Clermont County 
resident Brett Milam for selflessly do-
nating his kidney to a stranger in need. 
He recently shared his decision with 
our community in The Clermont Sun 
in Ohio where he works, describing his 
recent kidney donation and journey. 
Brett was inspired by an article writ-
ten by a man who had made the same 
choice to donate a kidney for no other 
reason than to commit an act of kind-
ness. 
As Brett tells it, after months of re-
search, contemplation, and discussion 
with other organ donors, he decided to 
help a stranger, giving them an early 
Christmas present: a healthy kidney.

I applaud Brett for making this dona-
tion to save a complete stranger’s life, 
and I am particularly moved by the 
selflessness and kindness that Brett 
made with this action. 
Brett’s choice to donate his kidney

Today, I recognize Brett Milam for

COMMENDING 
EPA 
ADMINIS-
TRATOR ANDREW WHEELER 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
wish to commend EPA Administrator 
Andrew Wheeler for his recent clearing 
up of the definition of waters of the 
United States, known as WOTUS, in-
deed, causing a lot of woe for people in 
my district and the Western U.S., espe-
cially. 
Under the 2015 definition, it seemed 
every puddle, every ditch, every pos-
sible water source was going to be 
brought under the fist of the U.S. Gov-
ernment. With much dismay, many 
farmers, ranchers, people building, and 
people doing simple things were unable 
to understand what they were supposed 
to do. Indeed, it was a long arm of gov-
ernment overreach. 
What we have heard since then: ‘‘Oh, 
the sky is falling. This is going to roll 
back protections.’’ 
These aren’t protections. These are 
things that are way beyond the scope 
of what government should be doing. 
It limited the scope of rivers and 
large streams and our oceans. So with 
all of ‘‘the sky is falling’’ you are hear-
ing, no, it isn’t anything like that. In-
deed, it is putting it back into more eq-
uitable space. 
What this rule does is, indeed, end 
the confusion and ends the Federal 
overreach and helps us get back to 
business and still protect the environ-
ment. 
f 
STATE OF THE ECONOMY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude any extraneous materials on the 
subject of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I come 
to the floor this afternoon with a num-
ber of my Democratic colleagues to 
speak about the subject of paramount 
concern for most Americans: the econ-
omy. Healthcare, the economy, and 
their jobs are what folks are focused on 
when they wake up in the morning. 
The Joint Economic Committee now 
headed on our side of the aisle by DON 
BEYER from Virginia, released two re-
ports today that all Americans should 
look at carefully. One of them focuses 
on the failure of the 2017 Trump tax 
cuts which Chairman NEAL will be fo-
cusing on shortly. 
Republicans claim that the tax cuts 
would pay for themselves and not add a 
penny to deficits and debt. That is a 
theory that we have heard time and 
time again from Republicans to sup-
port their tax cuts for the wealthiest in 
our country. Both experience and evi-
dence tell us that their tax cuts always 
end up driving our deficits up, hurting 
the middle class, and placing the bur-
den on future generations. 
I hope Americans will read that re-
port and draw the same conclusions 
that so many economists have made 
about the dangerous tax scam. 
The second report which we will be 
focusing on this evening concerns the 
economy more broadly. It asks a ques-
tion that many Americans may be ask-
ing this year: Is the Trump economy 
doing as well as the President claimed 
it would? 
And: Can the President take credit 
for economic growth that began long 
before he took office? 
I want to thank the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. BEYER) for his efforts as 
vice chair of the Joint Economic Com-
mittee, as well as the former vice 
chair, CAROLYN
MALONEY, who now 
heads up the Oversight and Reform 
Committee. 
I will be yielding to Mr. BEYER soon 
to speak more about the content of the 
committee’s report. He will be followed 
by Mr. NEAL who is the chairman of 
the Ways and Means Committee, and a 
senior member of this body. He is prob-
ably one of the most knowledgeable 
people, not only about taxes, but about 
the economy in general. 
But first I want to speak a little bit 
about this President’s record on the 
economy. 
President Trump sought office on a 
raft of economic promises. He promised 
to create 25 million new jobs in 10 
years. 
He promised 6 percent growth in our 
domestic product. 
He promised to eliminate the $19 tril-
lion national debt. 
He promised to get wages up for 
American workers with $4,000 raises as 
a result of the tax cuts. 
And the President promised to make 
healthcare much less expensive and 
much better. 
b 1645 
Let’s see how he is doing. 
On the first measure, job growth, job 
growth has slowed under President 
Trump. Let me repeat that. Job growth 
has slowed under President Trump 
compared to the level of the economic 
expansion that began under his prede-
cessor. 
This chart—and it will probably be 
hard to see for many viewers—shows 
that job growth was highest here in the 
years before President Trump took of-
fice and then lower, following. 
Now, what does that mean? 
Let me give you the big figure, 
Madam Speaker, because the specifics 
of the chart will be difficult for people 
to see on the floor and in the gallery. 
What it means is that, on average— 
and this is an important fact to re-
member—under 
President 
Obama, 
there were 227,000 jobs created per 
month over the last 35 months of his 
term. 
Now we have had 35 months of the 
Trump term. What has he done to real-
ize that promise of 25 million jobs? 
Madam Speaker, 36,000 less jobs per 
month have been created under Donald 
Trump than under Barack Obama in 
the same timeframe. 
Now, that is important because the 
President, of course, claims that this is 
the best economy we have ever seen. As 
I said, that is 36,000 fewer jobs per 
month, and 1.26 million fewer jobs over 
President Trump’s term from the trend 
he inherited. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to show 
you a chart on how the economy that 
President Obama had put in place with 
the help of the Congress was going 
straight up. 
At this pace, President Trump’s 4- 
year term will not achieve the same 
level of job creation as the previous 4- 
year term of President Obama. In fact, 
he would fall—listen to this figure—2.5 
million jobs short. 
So, when we hear the President at a 
rally claiming this great economic 
boom, remember, 2.5 million less jobs 
created. 
President Trump also loves to cite 
the low unemployment rate, which, in 
December 2019, stood at 3.5 percent. 
That is, indeed, a low number. It is a 
good number in the sense that it shows 
that so many of our people are work-
ing. But underlying those facts are so 
many of our people are working one, 
two, and three jobs so they can support 
themselves and their family. 
Now, when he took office, the rate 
was 4.7 percent. It is 3.5 percent now 
and 4.7 percent when he took office. 
Compare that to the decline in the un-
employment rate during the same pe-
riod in President Obama’s second term. 
At his second inauguration, the rate 
was 7.9 percent. He left office with 4.7 
percent. That is 3.2 percent less. He left 
the office with a 4.7 percent unemploy-
ment rate, continuing a strong decline. 
Under President Obama, a decline of 
5.3 percentage points from when he 
took office; under President Trump, a 
decline of 1.2 percentage points. 
Madam Speaker, let me give you that 
figure again. Under President Obama, 
he inherited from George Bush a de-
clining employment. It spiked at 10 
percent, and under President Obama,

January 28, 2020 
that came down to 4.7 percent. That is 
where you get the 5.3 percent reduc-
tion. Actually, he halved the unem-
ployment rate if you figure it that 
way. 
Under President Trump, however, he 
inherited a downward trend—in other 
words, less unemployment as opposed 
to more unemployment from Bush to 
Obama—and he has failed to keep the 
pace that President Obama established. 
This was the decline in the unem-
ployment rate under Barack Obama. 
This is what has happened: steeper de-
cline under Obama, got to a low num-
ber, and it has been reduced by 1.2 per-
cent as opposed to the 4.7 percent that 
Obama reduced it to. 
While President Trump boasted that 
his administration would see a 6 per-
cent GDP—that is growth in the do-
mestic product of our country, our en-
tire production—that would have been 
good; 6 percent would have been phe-
nomenal. It was also not attained. 
Over the first 11 quarters of his term, 
that figure was 2.6 percent, dropping to 
2.1 percent in the third quarter of last 
year. The Federal Reserve estimates 
that 2020 will see it fall even lower as 
any short-term stimulus from his tax 
cut disappears. Mr. NEAL is going to 
talk about the tax cut and what was 
promised and what was delivered. 
Madam Speaker, I would simply 
point out to you that what you see is, 
essentially, a level 2.5 percent average 
growth under President Obama and 
under 
President 
Trump, 
notwith-
standing the extraordinary trillion-dol-
lar tax cut that was infused in the 
economy. Again, Mr. NEAL will speak 
more to that. 
It is clear the Trump tax cut did lit-
tle to boost GDP as he claimed it 
would, and, of course, he claimed many 
more jobs. 
On deficits and the debt, President 
Trump’s promise would seem laughable 
if the reality weren’t so dangerous. 
Instead of reversing deficits and 
eliminating the debt, he has overseen 
an increase fueled by his 2017 tax cut 
that gave $2 trillion in new, unpaid-for 
tax cuts primarily to the wealthiest in 
our country. 
Last week, to the surprise of no one 
who understands the history of Repub-
lican tax cuts, President Trump sug-
gested he might seek cuts to Medicare 
and Social Security to offset the defi-
cits created by his tax cuts. I will leave 
it to Chairman YARMUTH to go into 
greater detail about the Trump defi-
cits. 
We have all seen this President’s 
campaign on reducing America’s trade 
deficit, but it has increased on his 
watch. In fact, according to the Joint 
Economic Committee’s report, as many 
as 450,000 jobs were lost in 2019 alone as 
a result of this President’s trade wars. 
The President loves to stand at the 
podium at his rallies and shout slogans 
about how his is the best economy ever 
and how he inherited a mess from 
President Obama. Those statements, 
sadly, as so many of his have been 
shown to be, are not accurate. That is 
a polite way to say it. The facts tell 
the opposite story. 
Over the course of the Obama Presi-
dency, 10.8 million jobs were created as 
the unemployment rate fell from, as I 
said, 10 percent to 4.7 percent. In the 
last 11 quarters of President Obama’s 
term, real GDP growth was averaging 
2.6 percent—a remarkable turnaround 
from the 8.4 percent deficit, decline, 
that he inherited, a decrease in the last 
quarter before he took office. 
Now, annual median income, Madam 
Speaker, you will note, under Presi-
dent Obama, the red line starts declin-
ing 2008, 2009. The deepest recession 
that we have experienced in our life-
times, which started in December of 
‘07, you will see real household income 
declined significantly. 
But you will see, when the recovery 
program that President Obama and 
Democrats put in place in our country, 
the American Recovery Act, you saw 
employment going up, average income 
going up, and you see it going up to 
$63,179. 
The tax cut, you will see a real spike 
here. This is under President Obama, 
and then you see the tax cut, this line 
here, and then you see a flattening out. 
While it has increased, it has been a 
much slower increase. So, when he says 
it is the best economy, the folks here 
who were experiencing this kind of in-
crease would beg to differ. 
Compare that to the first 2 years of 
Trump’s Presidency with an increase in 
annual median household income of 
$1,400. This indicated, under President 
Obama, an increase of $4,800 in median 
income, three times as much—as a 
matter of fact, more than three times. 
In fact, incomes at every level have 
grown faster under Democrats than 
under Republicans since 1968. 
So this is not just picking a par-
ticular year to make a point. This is 68 
years, average. The blue, Democrats, 
increase in every quintile. That means 
those at the bottom increase substan-
tially and, yes, those at the top in-
crease. 
This is not, as some Republicans 
charge us with, class warfare. Every-
body did better, on average, with 
Democratic Presidents in the 20 years 
during that period of time that we had 
the Presidency and the 30 years that 
the Republicans had the Presidency. 
Those are the averages, and you can 
see, in every quintile, everybody in 
America did better under the Demo-
crats’ economic programs. 
President Trump’s economy is just 
the latest chapter in a long story in 
which, time and time again, Demo-
cratic leadership has seen our economy 
out of a recession and danger as Presi-
dent Obama did when he inherited, as I 
said, the deepest recession anybody 
less than 95 years of age in our country 
has experienced. 
This is a contrast that House Demo-
crats will be highlighting this year 
when Americans will again entrust the 
President and Congress with crafting 
economic policies. That means jobs for 
them. That means some money to in-
vest in their children, in their families, 
in their mortgages, in buying a car, a 
refrigerator, or a new stove or fixing 
their heat when it goes out. 
What President Trump doesn’t seem 
to understand, however, is that a thriv-
ing economy is more than growing the 
stock market. 
Let me say this as an aside. I don’t 
have a slide here now, but the average 
growth in the stock market under 
Democrats from 1948 until 2008—I am 
not sure exactly when we ended the 
study—was more in every Democratic 
administration. 
It is about real economic security for 
American workers and their families; 
it is about whether America is still a 
place where everyone has a fair shot, 
where everyone has access to opportu-
nities, and where everyone can get 
ahead. That is what that chart shows, 
and that is over a significant period of 
time. 
By that measure, the President’s 
record has been dismal. 
Now, healthcare, what I started with, 
is one of the greatest concerns. Jobs 
and healthcare were our issues in the 
last election. We added 63 Members to 
the Democratic side of the aisle, which 
is why we are in the majority, because 
people knew that we were the party 
that was focused on healthcare and on 
jobs and had delivered. 
This chart shows the uninsured rate. 
It was going down over the last 3 years, 
but because of the assault on the Af-
fordable Care Act and the uncertainty 
that was created, as you will see, 2014, 
2013, 2016 the President is elected, it 
comes down and flattens out. Why? Be-
cause 
they 
are 
not 
supporting 
healthcare. We need to get it back up 
so there are less and less uninsured. 
Mr. NEAL
represents the State of 
Massachusetts where 100 percent of 
children are covered and 97 percent of 
adults. That is what the Affordable 
Care Act was based upon, the Massa-
chusetts plan, when Governor Romney 
was the Republican Governor in Massa-
chusetts. 
As a result of the policies of this 
President, the number of Americans 
without health insurance rose to 8.5 
percent in 2018. That was the first in-
crease in a decade. 
b 1700 
Not having health insurance is bad 
for your health and bad for your psyche 
and bad for your family. 
His 
efforts, 
meaning 
President 
Trump, alongside congressional Repub-
licans to repeal, undermine, and sabo-
tage the Affordable Care Act have 
brought uncertainty to health insur-
ance markets and made it harder for 
working families to get affordable cov-
erage for the care they need. 
We are working very hard on that. 
We are trying to bring prescription 
drug costs down. We are trying to fix 
the problem of surprise billing. We 
want to make sure that Americans 
have affordable, quality healthcare.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H611 
January 28, 2020 
On wages, we see another lost oppor-
tunity. For 3 years, President Trump 
and the Republican-led Senate have re-
fused to support legislation to raise the 
minimum wage, which has not been 
raised in over a decade, which the 
House finally passed a bill last year, 
under the Democratic majority, which 
tries to lift that minimum wage so peo-
ple can live and support themselves 
when they are working 40 hours a 
week. No American working 40 hours a 
week ought not to be able to afford to 
support themselves and to help support 
a family. 
According to the monthly jobs report 
for December, hourly wage growth 
slipped to its lowest rate in 18 months. 
When you listen to the President talk 
at these rallies about this economy, re-
member that figure and check it. Go to 
Google or go to some reference point. 
Check it. 
According to the monthly jobs report 
for December, last month, hourly wage 
growth slipped to its lowest rate in 18 
months. That is a far cry from the 
$4,000 annual salary increase President 
Trump promised would trickle down 
from his tax cuts for the wealthiest in 
America. 
American workers deserve better. 
America deserves better. American ex-
porters deserve better. American farm-
ers and small business owners deserve 
better than this uncertain Trump econ-
omy. All Americans deserve better. 
That is why the Democratic-led 
House voted last year to raise wages, 
ensure equal pay for equal work, and 
give Federal employees a long-overdue 
cost of living adjustment. 
That is why we voted to lower pre-
scription drug prices, a bill that sits in 
the 
Senate, 
untended 
by 
Senator 
MCCONNELL. 
That is why we voted to make it easi-
er for more workers to save for secure 
retirement, thanks to Chairman NEAL 
and the Ways and Means Committee. 
That is why we voted to protect mul-
tiemployer pension funds, so that hun-
dreds of thousands of people would not 
be left out in the cold after contrib-
uting to and being promised a pension 
in their old age. 
Now, as we look to 2020, House Demo-
crats will continue to make economic 
opportunity our focus. I look forward 
to bringing more legislation to the 
floor this year to ensure that we do not 
squander the gains of our recovery 
under President Obama. We will keep 
looking for ways to help America get 
ahead. 
I hope all of my colleagues will look 
at the facts that I put forward and see 
what the Obama economy did and that 
the last 3 years have been a continu-
ation of the Obama economy. Just look 
at the line. It is almost a straight line 
up. 
I appreciate that a number of my 
Democratic colleagues are here this 
evening to add to this conversation. I 
yield to the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. BEYER), my friend, former Lieu-
tenant Government, former Ambas-
sador, and the vice chair of the Joint 
Economic Committee. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank Majority Leader HOYER for 
his exemplary leadership and thank the 
distinguished chair of the Ways and 
Means Committee, RICHARD NEAL, for 
his friendship and his wise counsel. 
Madam Speaker, you be the judge. 
Two weeks ago, the World Economic 
Forum held its annual conference in 
Davos, and the central theme of the 
meeting this year was climate change, 
the most critical issue we face. 
President Trump spoke at the con-
ference, but instead of focusing on cli-
mate change, he made what amounts 
to a campaign speech, claiming that he 
has worked a miracle with the U.S. 
economy. The fundamental basis of his 
argument is wildly wrong. He claimed 
that the economy he inherited from 
Barack Obama was ‘‘in dismal shape.’’ 
On the basis of this fundamental re-
writing of history, he claimed credit 
for the strong U.S. economy. 
The economy is booming, he pro-
posed, not because Barack Obama 
helped dig us out from the worst reces-
sion since the Great Depression or be-
cause of the hard work and ingenuity 
of the American worker, but because of 
Donald Trump’s magical touch, the 
same magical touch he had with his 
Atlantic City casinos which went bank-
rupt, and Trump Shuttle and Trump 
University and Trump Mortgage and 
Trump Steaks and the Trump board 
game and Trump Vodka. 
That is quite a record. 
I am a businessman. With my broth-
er, my sister, my dad, we spent 46 years 
now building a highly successful com-
pany. And I know it is not easy, but I 
also know that when a businessman 
has a string of spectacular failures, you 
wouldn’t hire him to be CEO of your 
company, let alone President of the 
United States. 
But here we are. Serendipitously, 
with much luck, I became vice chair of 
the Joint Economic Committee re-
cently, and I couldn’t be more thrilled 
by the confidence of my Democratic 
leadership and the opportunity to 
serve. 
The Joint Economic Committee stud-
ies and advises Members of Congress 
about the economy. We are like the 
economic think tank for the economy 
to delve into the issues and, when nec-
essary, to set the record straight. 
So, when the President stands up at 
Davos and claims that he is an eco-
nomic miracle worker, supposedly sav-
ing the economy from what he claims 
is the disaster he inherited, the Joint 
Economic Committee has to step up to 
the plate. I was more than pleased 
when Majority Leader HOYER asked me 
to help lead this hour of discussion. So, 
today, we will talk about the sup-
posedly dismal economy. 
Was it a wreck, as the President 
imagines it? Far from it. 
Has he worked miracles with the 
economy? No way. The data shows that 
this is not true. 
Did his tax cuts supercharge the eco-
nomic growth? Very weak evidence. 
And did his tax cuts pay for them-
selves? Again, no way. 
Has the President’s trade war helped 
American businesses and consumers? 
We will argue it has done much more 
harm than good. 
And 
The 
Washington 
Post 
Fact 
Checker found that, during his Presi-
dency, Donald Trump has made more 
than 1,500 lies or misleading state-
ments about the economy, and he bra-
zenly repeats them even when cor-
rected. 
I suspect, next week, in this very 
Chamber, when he gives the State of 
the Union Address, we will hear many 
of those same misleading claims again. 
Madam Speaker, when you hear him 
make a claim about almost anything, 
you can pretty much know, more often 
than not, that it is not true. 
So, in his Davos speech at the World 
Economic Forum, when he said that 
the economy he inherited from Barack 
Obama was dismal, he also said: ‘‘We 
have the greatest economy we’ve ever 
had in the history of our country.’’ 
This claim and many others did not 
make it by the fact checkers at the As-
sociated Press. This isn’t unusual. He 
is often caught red-handed, in flagrante 
delicto, making easily debunked claims 
on a wide range of topics. And since the 
beginning of his administration, his 
record of falsehoods is astonishing. 
The Washington Post Fact Checker 
says Trump has made over 16,000 false 
or misleading claims in his first 3 years 
of office. When you hear this President 
say almost anything about the econ-
omy, it is likely to be more wrong than 
right. 
For example, he did not create a 
strong economy; he inherited it. This is 
made absolutely clear in a rigorous, 
carefully sourced new report by the 
Democratic staff on the Joint Eco-
nomic Committee. This is what the re-
port shows: that the economy Donald 
Trump inherited from Barack Obama 
was strong and getting stronger. 
Madam Speaker, you can see this on 
the chart right here. Unemployment 
was below 5 percent, GDP growth was 2 
percent in the fourth quarter of 2016, 
and 227,000 jobs were being created 
every month. 
President Obama led the economy a 
very long way back from the economic 
records that he inherited from his pred-
ecessor. Here is how bad it was. 
At the worst of the Great Recession, 
unemployment had reached 10 percent, 
but by the time President Obama left 
office, unemployment had already been 
cut more than in half, down to 4.7 per-
cent. 
When he took office, the economy 
was hemorrhaging 700,000 jobs per 
month. By the time he left, the econ-
omy had already added jobs for 76 
straight months, the longest in Amer-
ican history. 
Inflation was low. Wages and incomes 
were rising. It was a remarkable turn-
around. It was not, as the President 
said at Davos, dismal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H612 
January 28, 2020 
The President called the current 
economy a miracle due to his golden 
touch, but, no, he inherited this from 
the previous economy. 
So let’s thank the President, but not 
this President. Let’s thank my old 
boss, President Obama. 
The President often cherry-picks a 
strong month of job growth and implies 
that it is representative, but let’s look 
at things in the long term, which is 
how economists actually measure these 
things. 
In the first 35 months of the Trump 
administration, his economy added 
191,000 jobs per month. In the last 35 
months of Barack Obama, his economy 
added 227,000 jobs per month. That is a 
36,000 job-per-month difference over a 
comparable 35 months each. Donald 
Trump wants you to forget that, but 
let’s not let him get away with it. 
The job market is strong. Unemploy-
ment is 3.5 percent. But, again, he 
didn’t create low unemployment; he in-
herited it, and you can see that in the 
long-term trends. It was at 4.7 percent; 
now it is down to 3.5. 
But his signature policy impact, the 
$1.9 trillion in tax cuts, didn’t go into 
effect until 2018. So unemployment had 
already dropped to 4.1—that is the 
Obama effect, the 4.1. So the last six- 
tenths of a percent cost us $1.9 trillion, 
and it might be much higher than that. 
Madam Speaker, was the cost worth 
it? Is the President an economic ge-
nius? You be the judge. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Congressman BEYER, and I ap-
preciate his leadership on the Joint 
Economic Committee. 
I am now pleased to yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. 
NEAL), one of the senior Members of 
the House of Representatives, the dean 
of the Massachusetts delegation and 
the chairman of the Ways and Means 
Committee, who, as I said earlier, is as 
knowledgeable about tax policy and its 
consequences as anybody in this House. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, this is 
an opportunity to call attention to 
some of the suggestions that have been 
made by this President and this White 
House as to the economic growth that 
he claims credit for. 
On the day that Barack Obama be-
came President, America was losing 
800,000 jobs a month. When Barack 
Obama left the White House, there 
were 14.3 million new jobs that had 
been created. That is a real turnabout. 
This notion that there was this dismal 
economy that President Trump inher-
ited is simply not true. 
So let’s even go back to the end of 
the Clinton years, which, despite what 
President Trump says, the greatest 
economic growth spurt in American 
history took place during Bill Clinton’s 
Presidency—plus four balanced budg-
ets. So, when Bill Clinton said good- 
bye to the country, we were staring at 
a $15 trillion projected surplus over the 
next 10 years. 
Let’s do the math. A $1.3 trillion tax 
cut in 2001, a $1 trillion tax cut in 2003, 
and, borrowing, $2.3 trillion tax cuts in 
2017. 
So let’s take a look at this with some 
precision for a moment. That means, 
when you add the borrowing cost, 
meaning principal and interest, to 
what actually was embraced by two 
Republican Presidents, that means we 
have cut taxes, over about a 15-year pe-
riod, by $5 trillion, added a trillion dol-
lars to the debt this year, and now a 
national debt of $20 trillion, all based 
upon the theological notion—that is 
what it is, theology—that tax cuts pay 
for themselves. 
You cannot find a mainstream econo-
mist in America who will say that tax 
cuts pay for themselves. 
When we look back at what was done 
with the tax bill in December of 2017, it 
goes like this: 
A major piece of legislation was writ-
ten in 51 days, without one hearing, 
without one professional witness, with-
out one economic forecast, but again, 
this fundamental belief that, as the 
President said in a meeting at the 
White House with some of us, he didn’t 
see why we couldn’t have ‘‘6 percent 
growth.’’ 
He 
completely 
suggested 
that 
Obama’s economic growth spurt would 
be far surpassed by his, yet that has 
not happened. We have had, during the 
Clinton years, 2.3 to 5 percent quarters 
of economic growth, averaging, in the 
end, the highest of any President in the 
last century—really remarkable. 
And 
then 
this 
suggestion, 
even 
though mainstream economists kept 
saying, no, the economy, even with the 
sugar high of the tax cut, will settle 
back down to less than 2 percent, so we 
are at 1.8 percent with $20 trillion 
worth of debt. 
b 1715 
The Obama years, even climbing out 
of the recession, averaged north of 2.3 
to 2.4 percent of economic growth, 
given the worst recession, as the ma-
jority leader said, since the Great De-
pression. 
The argument was that we were 
going to have this unparalleled eco-
nomic growth because of the Repub-
lican tax bill. That has not happened. 
The issues have settled back, and it 
has flat-lined, but here are a couple of 
things that I want to mention here 
that I think really bear noting. 
Productivity, which is probably the 
most important part of raising quality- 
of-life measures for the American peo-
ple, a growth spurt of productivity, 
that has really not happened. 
Here is another key element of eco-
nomic discernment: worker participa-
tion rates. If you really want to know 
what is happening, that is what you 
focus on. 
The postwar norm is about 66 per-
cent, meaning two-thirds of the Amer-
ican people got up and went to work 
every day. Where are we now? At about 
63.8 percent. 
The tax cut did not issue one re-
sponse to one of the most fundamental 
challenges facing the American people, 
the American family, and the Amer-
ican economy. Madam Speaker, 2 mil-
lion people have left the workforce be-
cause of opioid addiction. Two million 
people have left the workforce because 
of addiction. 
We wondered why Social Security 
disability climbed during those years. 
It was because of opioid addiction. 
Back to that issue about labor par-
ticipation rates and productivity, there 
has been no change. Poverty rates re-
main stubborn. 
Here is something we should all be 
concerned about: There are still 40 mil-
lion 
Americans 
who 
receive 
food 
stamps. If you give those people a 
choice between good jobs and food 
stamps, they will always take the good 
jobs, always take the good jobs. 
The number of people who are work-
ing in this gig economy with uncertain 
hours, no benefits, two jobs, three jobs, 
where they would all like to have one 
that gave them some decent benefits 
and a good retirement, those are the 
challenges we face. 
Think 
about 
this 
number—again, 
numbers are stubborn—40 percent of 
the American workforce every day gets 
up, goes to work, and is not in a quali-
fied retirement plan. Their retirement 
is going to be Social Security. 
All of these numbers that we have de-
picted here portray a very different 
story about the President’s suggestions 
when compared to the reality of where 
we find ourselves. The uncertainty 
every day, largely based upon some of 
the bombast, the unpredictability of 
where we head, all are part of the chal-
lenge that we face. 
But this idea that this economic 
growth period has all been because of 
President Trump, it is simply not true. 
He inherited a very good economy from 
Barack Obama. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for his comments, 
and I hope the American people really 
focus on this. So much has been said by 
both sides that the American people 
really need to look at this themselves 
and figure out when did they do well, 
when did their families do well, who 
was watching out for their healthcare, 
who wanted to make sure that we bring 
up the income of those at the lowest 
levels of incomes in our country, and 
make a decision on their behalf as to 
who they want to support and who they 
believe. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. YARMUTH), 
chairman of the Budget Committee in 
the House of Representatives. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Earlier 
today, 
the 
Congressional 
Budget Office released its updated 
budget and economic outlook for the 
next decade. This report once again 
confirms that, despite the economic ex-
pansion he inherited, the fiscal outlook 
has worsened since President Trump 
took office. 
Under President Trump, deficits have 
risen to heights not usually seen out-
side of recessions and major world

January 28, 2020 
wars. They have increased every year, 
an unusual trend given that deficits 
tend to fall as unemployment rises. 
In fact, the deficit in 2019 was the 
highest since 2012, when we were recov-
ering from the Great Recession and the 
unemployment was 8 percent, more 
than double today’s rate. 
As a result of these deficits, the na-
tional debt has climbed higher and 
faster than CBO projected at the end of 
the Obama administration. Perhaps we 
shouldn’t be surprised. After all, this is 
the same President who proclaimed 
just last week, ‘‘Who the hell cares 
about the budget?’’ The record is clear 
that he doesn’t. 
On their face, these fiscal facts might 
not be so concerning if one forgets 
about the multitude of deficits we face 
in the real economy: crumbling infra-
structure, 
skyrocketing 
healthcare 
costs, widening student achievement 
gaps, warming climate, lower life ex-
pectancy. 
In light of these and other problems, 
it is difficult to escape the conclusion 
that we should be making bolder in-
vestments in American families and 
our Nation’s future. But President 
Trump didn’t use our fiscal space to re-
pair the roads and bridges that support 
our economy, to reduce drug prices for 
working families, or to bolster our en-
vironmental resilience in the face of 
the defining threat of a generation. No, 
President Trump and Republicans in 
Congress ran up our tab with a $1.9 tril-
lion tax cut—if you add interest, $2.3 
trillion—that showered benefits on cor-
porations and the wealthy. 
Madam Speaker, that $1.9 trillion 
had little meaningful impact on the 
economy, other than increasing our al-
ready 
shameful 
income 
inequality. 
Madam Speaker, that $1.9 trillion could 
have been, but was not, put toward 
making childcare more affordable, col-
lege education more accessible, and re-
tirement security more achievable for 
American families. 
Making this situation far worse, 
President Trump is once again sug-
gesting that he will offset the deficits 
that his signature policy exploded by 
cutting Social Security and Medicare, 
taking money right out of the pockets 
of America’s seniors and forcing them 
to foot his bill. 
Our economy and budget face dif-
ficult times ahead. An aging popu-
lation and rising healthcare costs mean 
economic growth is projected to be 
slower and deficits are expected to be 
larger going forward. 
Addressing this issue over the next 
several decades will require a balanced 
approach that includes a fair tax sys-
tem. 
President Trump has taken us pre-
cisely in the wrong direction by adding 
trillions to the debt for a tax giveaway 
for the rich that yielded little in return 
for everyone else. He is squandering 
the chance to lay the groundwork for a 
more productive and equitable econ-
omy. 
Despite these challenges, we still 
have the opportunity to make respon-
sible investments in the American peo-
ple, our infrastructure, and the envi-
ronment, investments that reflect our 
values, promote a stronger economic 
and fiscal outlook, and move our Na-
tion forward. 
As chairman of the Budget Com-
mittee, I have stressed that we need to 
think seriously about severe and per-
sistent deficits in the real economy, 
not just deficits in the budget. That 
doesn’t mean that we can spend tax 
dollars without thought or discretion, 
but it does require that we use our Na-
tion’s resources, including our deficits, 
more wisely than this administration 
has. It means prioritizing policies that 
improve the living standards of current 
and future generations that support 
those most in need and help mitigate 
the challenges American families are 
facing today and the challenges they 
may face tomorrow. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for his comments, 
and I thank him for his leadership on 
the Budget Committee. 
I might say, as a result of his work, 
last year, 2019, we completed the appro-
priations process. Unlike the previous 
year, when our Republican colleagues 
were in charge and the government was 
shut down when the new Congress took 
office, we kept the government open. 
There was no drama. On January 3, ev-
erybody was working and being served 
by their government. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAYNE), 
whose father was such a good friend of 
mine and who does such an excellent 
job. His dad would be proud of him here 
in Congress. 
Mr. 
PAYNE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank our majority leader for those 
kind words. I also thank Joint Eco-
nomic 
Committee 
Vice 
Chairman 
BEYER, Budget Committee Chairman 
YARMUTH, and Ways and Means Com-
mittee Chairman NEAL for organizing 
this Special Order hour. 
It is important to discuss the state of 
our economy because it is a case of 
true contrast. Trump’s economic deci-
sions have created two very distinct 
Americas. 
There is the one America for the af-
fluent where incomes are rising and 
taxes are dropping. There is the other 
America, the one reserved for minori-
ties and low-income Americans, the 
one for middle Americans, the one that 
is losing manufacturing jobs to auto-
mation and cheap, foreign labor, the 
one that forces people to turn to min-
imum wage jobs as careers. 
President Obama worked to unite 
these two Americas. Trump has worked 
very hard to divide them, once again. 
As President, Trump is known for 
two major business moves. First, he 
passed his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 
but his law did not give the vast major-
ity of Americans tax cuts. It actually 
cut their tax deductions. He did not 
improve their ability to get new jobs. 
He made it more difficult. 
He has taken away benefits that low- 
and middle-income American families 
took for granted. He took away their 
ability to deduct moving expenses 
when they had to find a better job and 
support their families. He took away 
their ability to deduct alimony, which 
could lead to more deadbeat dads. He 
even forced average Americans to de-
clare more of their income, costing 
them more money in taxes. And while 
you cannot deduct your moving ex-
penses, millionaires can deduct the en-
tire cost of a private plane. 
Then, Trump chose to impose tariffs 
on Chinese goods. Economic advisers 
said the move would hurt our country 
before Trump did it, and they were 
right. A Federal Reserve study pub-
lished last December said that tariffs 
have caused Americans to lose critical 
manufacturing jobs and raised the 
costs of goods for consumers. 
Manufacturing jobs have helped mil-
lions of Americans get out of poverty, 
and that opportunity wanes today. 
They have allowed older generations to 
pay the college tuitions of younger 
generations. They have been critical 
for minorities to grab a piece of the 
American Dream. 
President Trump likes to point to his 
work around minorities participating 
in the job sector, but where I come 
from in north New Jersey, we do not 
see it. Where I come from in my dis-
trict, we do not see it. 
It is a situation of two Americas, 
once again, one for the haves and the 
other for the have-nots. The majority 
of the people under this President have 
not. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for his comments; 
for his leadership on the minimum 
wage, to try to lift people up at the 
bottom of the wage scale; and also for 
his leadership on healthcare, to ensure 
that they have access to affordable, 
quality healthcare. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Ms. 
HOULAHAN), a Representative from the 
Philadelphia suburbs who served so 
well in the military of our country and 
then became a very successful busi-
nesswoman. I know she knows a lot 
about how to run a business and how to 
run an economy. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the majority leader for bringing 
us together this evening to talk about 
the economy. 
January was Jobs Month for me in 
my district and my team. I spent time 
home in my community in Pennsyl-
vania and here in Washington focused 
on three things: one, making sure that 
our economy is working for everyone 
and that Pennsylvanians can afford to 
live where they work and pay their 
bills while receiving fair pay; two, sup-
porting our small businesses, which are 
the backbone of our economy; and 
three, ensuring our workforce is adapt-
ing to new technologies and to the fu-
ture of their work.

January 28, 2020 
lot to be optimistic about. Unemploy-
ment rates remain low, and we added 
more than 300,000 nonfarm jobs. 
The administration also likes to 
point to the record-high stock market 
as an indication of the impact of its 
economic policies. To be sure, there are 
good signs, and this steady economic 
improvement began well before the 
President and his administration took 
office and, thankfully, it continues. 
With this in mind, I would like to 
share, though, what I saw and heard 
during Jobs Month in my community. 
My community is in the enviable po-
sition of having a very low unemploy-
ment rate. I hear more from employers 
who are struggling to fill empty posi-
tions than from long-term unemployed 
people who are looking for work. 
But that doesn’t tell the whole story. 
The rosy jobs report from January 
doesn’t tell the story of people who 
work in my community, or who would 
like to, but can’t afford to even live 
there. 
Last week, I was in Phoenixville, 
Pennsylvania, meeting with affordable 
housing advocates and proponents for 
more mass transit options near those 
affordable housing options. During that 
visit, I learned that in our area, about 
a quarter of the people are renters. 
Working an average wage for renters, 
a 9–5 job is not nearly enough for a 
modest, two-bedroom home in my com-
munity. People are working extra 
hours, holding down two jobs or more 
to be able to afford to live where they 
work; or they are living elsewhere, 
where the cost of living is lower, and 
they 
are 
commuting 
ridiculous 
amounts of time, using inadequate 
road and rail infrastructure to get to 
their work. And they are losing pre-
cious time with their families in the 
process. 
A booming stock market is good for 
some, but it doesn’t change the daily 
math and daily experience of so many 
people in my community. 
The House has passed legislation to 
raise the minimum wage and to help 
workers save for retirement, and we 
need to see action in the Senate to en-
sure that our economy is working for 
all Americans, not just for those who 
have enough money to invest in the 
stock market. 
Earlier this month, many in my com-
munity also celebrated progress on the 
U.S.-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement, 
a 
trade deal that was important for 
many small businesses in my commu-
nity, including our agricultural pro-
ducers. I was very proud to support 
that agreement. 
But this administration’s trade poli-
cies have also harmed my community. 
The trade war in China has hurt small 
businesses as well as larger manufac-
turers whose business models are built 
around global trade in my community. 
Although we now have a ‘‘Phase 1’’ 
deal with China, businesses in my com-
munity are eager for a real and lasting 
agreement 
that 
doesn’t 
harm 
the 
American businesses in an effort to 
punish China. 
Madam Speaker, I also want to high-
light just one other aspect of the Janu-
ary jobs report that stuck out to me. 
Just like here in Congress, women are 
entering the workforce at historic 
rates. Like so many women, and men, 
frankly, I have faced the real struggles 
of how to balance both raising a family 
and excelling at work. Our policies 
need to be adopted to support and en-
courage our changing workforce. 
We have shown that we can work on 
a bipartisan basis to enact paid paren-
tal leave, as an example, for Federal 
workers, setting the example for other 
employers. 
We need to examine how we provide 
for childcare for working parents. We 
need how to examine how to ensure 
that pregnant workers have protec-
tions if they need an accommodation in 
the job during their pregnancy. And we 
need to ensure that we are paying 
equal pay for equal work. All of these 
policies can help move our economy 
forward, and all deserve the attention 
of our Senate and our counterparts in 
the White House. 
Over the last few weeks, I have 
learned a lot by visiting manufacturing 
facilities 
in 
my 
community, 
like 
OmegaFlex in Exton, Pennsylvania, or 
laying tile at the Chester County Inter-
mediate Unit, or working alongside the 
IBEW workers training newly-sepa-
rated veterans for work. 
I have come away deeply optimistic 
about where we are headed, but also 
armed with motivation to move for-
ward with the bold policies that we 
need to make sure our economy is 
working for everyone, for all of us, to 
support our small businesses, and to 
prepare our workforce for the future 
ahead. There certainly is work to be 
done. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for her com-
ments, and I know that she is working 
her district very, very hard, and listen-
ing to people, which is what we need to 
do. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ADAMS), who is the leader of the group 
that I am very enthusiastic about that 
is helping our historically Black col-
leges and universities. I thank her for 
her leadership on that and so many 
other educational issues and economic 
issues for our families. 
Ms. 
ADAMS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the majority leader for yielding, 
and for his leadership, and for orga-
nizing this Special Order Hour. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to join 
my colleagues in setting the record 
straight when it comes to the Trump 
economy. 
The Trump economy was on sad dis-
play in Charlotte, North Carolina, on 
Monday, when 1,300 of my constituents 
stood in line for a chance at 185 afford-
able housing units in West Charlotte. 
Instead of investing in shelter, af-
fordable 
housing, 
and 
community 
health, the Trump economic policy is 
about consolidating wealth. The Trump 
economy is one that works for the 
American billionaire, but not for the 
union boilermaker. It is an economy 
that works for executives with golden 
parachutes, 
but 
not 
for 
educators 
teaching elementary school students 
parachute games. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. In 
2016, when Donald Trump was elected, 
he inherited a robust economy, thanks 
to President Obama and his adminis-
tration. It was President Obama who 
turned our economy around and helped 
pull us out of the Great Recession. Sev-
enty-five consecutive months of pri-
vate sector job growth? Thanks, Presi-
dent Obama. 
However, since then, Trump’s ‘‘Bil-
lionaires First’’ policies have hurt our 
neighbors and our families. Some of 
these harmful policies: The U.S. with-
drawal from the Paris climate agree-
ment; the ongoing trade war with 
China, and threats to place tariffs on 
goods imported from our allies; this ad-
ministration’s cruel efforts to dis-
mantle and weaken the Affordable Care 
Act; Trump’s heartless immigration 
policies that have led to fearmongering 
and separation of families at the bor-
der. 
Trump economic policy is not about 
helping others. Instead, the cruelty is 
the point. In fact, the only compas-
sionate thing about his economic pol-
icy is that it looks out for billionaires, 
and not just millionaires like himself. 
But Scripture tells us that, ‘‘Whoever 
loves money never has enough; who-
ever loves wealth is never satisfied 
with their income.’’ The dividends we 
seek as public servants are not from in-
creased wealth, but from a more per-
fect commonwealth. 
Luckily, the American people are 
standing up to push back against this 
economy. And whether it is a small 
business owner who gives the homeless 
a place to park their cars at night, or 
the community advocates helping their 
displaced neighbors find new homes, 
the Queen City knows that service is 
the rent we pay for living on this 
Earth. 
The American people are working for 
the people, and so is the people’s 
House. It is time for the Trump admin-
istration to do the same. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for her com-
ments. 
I am now pleased to yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO), one of the senior Members 
of the House of Representatives, the 
chair of the Labor, Health and Human 
Services, Education, and Related Agen-
cies Subcommittee of the Appropria-
tions Committee that deals with so 
many of these issues that have been 
discussed over the last hour. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the majority leader for the op-
portunity to speak on this Special 
Order. 
Americans 
are 
struggling 
under 
President Trump. They are desperately 
waiting for their incomes to rise and

January 28, 2020 
their costs to slow. Yet, the President 
has failed to fully deliver on his prom-
ises to them. That is according to the 
Joint Economic Committee’s excellent 
new report. 
In fact, according to this report, 
growth in median annual household in-
come was three times greater during 
the last 2 years of the Obama adminis-
tration than the first 2 years of the 
Trump administration. 
And mostly, job growth has slowed. 
According to the report, in the first 35 
months of President Trump’s term, 
there were 36,000 fewer nonfarm jobs 
created per month than the final 35 
months of President Obama’s term. 
This is despite the Republicans’ 2017 
tax law. It will cost $1.9 trillion, but 83 
percent of its benefits go to the top 1 
percent. Working people, middle-class 
families cannot afford more of the 
President’s giveaways to the wealthy 
and the well-connected. 
The single biggest economic chal-
lenge of our time is that people’s pay is 
not keeping rise with skyrocketing 
costs, healthcare, childcare, housing. 
They struggle, including in my State of 
Connecticut. 
The United Way put out a report, it 
is Asset Limited, Income Constrained, 
Employed, the ALICE report. And what 
essentially it says is that people who 
are working one or two jobs just can’t 
make a standard of living. They are 
above the poverty line, but they can’t 
make it. 
Out of the 20 most common jobs or 
occupations, registered nurses, cash-
iers, laborers, et cetera, only one pays 
enough to reasonably support a house-
hold; that is operations managers. 
Under this President, many Ameri-
cans are suffering something akin to a 
personal economic crisis. To claim oth-
erwise is to ignore the reality of their 
circumstances. 
We see their suffering. That is why 
the House has passed the Paycheck 
Fairness Act for equal pay, lower drug 
costs to reduce prescription drug costs, 
raise the wage by raising the minimum 
wage to $15 by 2025. 
We need to work hard to make oppor-
tunity real for people. We urge the 
President to join us because, as this 
new report from the Joint Economic 
Committee indicates, Americans need 
a break, not more broken promises. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for her com-
ments. 
Madam Speaker, how much time do I 
have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland has 11⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentlewoman from Michigan 
(Ms. STEVENS). 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to discuss the impact of our econ-
omy on our American workers and on 
our American manufacturers. 
The headlines are real. We are in a 
technical manufacturing recession, as 
measured by productivity and output. 
As we know, and as it has been stated 
many times tonight, the Tax Cut and 
Jobs Act of 2017 was a permanent tax 
giveaway for the wealthiest corpora-
tions, not our suppliers, not our work-
ers, but the wealthiest among us, at 
the expense of everyday Americans. 
We have the benefit of hindsight to 
point out what many experts at the 
time cautioned; that this would ulti-
mately not lead to significant job gains 
or raise workers’ wages. 
$1.5 trillion added to our deficit. The 
levels are alarming. The facts are out 
today. 
Madam Speaker, it is clear. We must 
do better. We must continue to work 
for the people. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, in 
2009, President Obama came into office dur-
ing the Great Recession. He inherited a 
dreadful economy but worked hard for policies 
that would stimulate growth and help the aver-
age American. Thankfully, his policies worked 
and America is on the upswing. 
However, we now have a President who 
wants to take credit where credit is not due. 
President Trump is reaping the benefits of 
Obama’s economic policies, while harming the 
people who were still left behind. Recovering 
from a recession and lifting up all Americans 
takes more than eight years, and this Presi-
dent has not taken the torch. 
Instead of building on Obama’s success, 
Trump has kicked the Americans who are still 
down. 
When farmers in the 2nd Congressional Dis-
trict of Georgia and all across the nation were 
suffering from major crop losses from natural 
disasters, President Trump decided to start a 
trade war with China. Trade wars do not often 
have victors, but they always have losers. 
American farmers, workers, and consumers 
were the losers. 
Our farmers lost business, our workers lost 
wages, and our consumers paid higher 
prices—all to cover the costs of the tariffs— 
not China and not President Trump, the archi-
tect of this bad plan. 
When running for office, then-candidate 
Trump said he would use his knowledge of tax 
cuts for the rich to help the people who this 
economy still isn’t working for. When he was 
elected, one of the first things he did was give 
a $1 trillion tax cut to the super rich—also 
known as himself and his friends. 
Trickle down economics did not work then 
and they do not work now. Giving money to 
the wealthy does not translate to higher wages 
for workers. It means more money for the al-
ready super wealthy. 
The Trump tax cut has also ballooned an al-
ready too high national deficit. When you take 
a pay cut, you cannot pay your bills, so your 
debt grows. But it’s not the wealthy who will 
feel the pain from an exploding deficit that will 
slow our economic growth. It is everyday 
Americans who will feel the effects—lower 
wages lead to a lower standard of living. The 
Peterson Foundation estimates that if the na-
tional debt continues rising as is, the average 
income for a family of four will drop by 
$16,000 over the next three decades. 
$16,000 is not much for those at the top. 
But it is devastating for those in the middle 
and working class. Food stamps, unemploy-
ment benefits, Medicare, and Social Security 
could all face cuts because of tax cuts for the 
wealthy. 
We should be trying to make the nation a 
better place for our children and grand-
children. Instead we have a leader who wants 
to leave them with our debt. Instead we have 
a leader who wants to ride on President 
Obama’s coattails and lure us into a false 
sense of security, so he and his rich friends 
can have even more—when so many in Amer-
ica have less! 
America is supposed to be a land of oppor-
tunity, where anyone can succeed with 
enough hard work. Trade wars, tax cuts for 
the rich while cutting food stamps for the poor 
are not the way to make America great. In-
stead of building on our success and lending 
a helping hand to those in need, this President 
has only sought to help himself. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Majority Leader Hoyer Chairmen Neal of Ways 
and Means and Chairman Yarmuth of the 
Budget Committee and Vice-Chairman Beyer 
of the Joint Economic Committee for holding 
this very important and timely Special Order to 
review and assess the state of the national 
economy two years after the Republican-con-
trolled Congress enacted the Trump-GOP 
TaxScam. 
The verdict is now in and it leads to the in-
escapable 
conclusion 
that 
the 
Trump 
TaxScam has not accelerated the economy, 
rather it is a significant drag on the booming 
economy 
President 
Barack 
Obama 
be-
queathed to his successor, the current occu-
pant of the office. 
Specifically, two points cannot be stressed 
enough. 
First, President Trump did not create the 
strong economy; he inherited it. 
Second, we paid an extremely high price— 
$1.9 trillion—for tax cuts that have done so lit-
tle for the economy. 
Madam Speaker, most of President Trump’s 
claims about the economy are false or highly 
misleading. 
There is no such thing as a ‘‘Trump 
bump’’—key economic indicators are the same 
or worse. 
The President’s signature economic policy— 
the $1.9 trillion tax cut—has failed to deliver 
the promised economic boost and his second 
major economic policy—the trade war—is a 
self-inflicted wound, hurting farmers, con-
sumers, businesses and the economy. 
Madam Speaker, those of us who were 
there remember well that the morning of Janu-
ary 20, 2009, which was one of the coldest 
days on record in Washington, DC. 
But it was nothing compared to the chill 
wind blowing through the American economy 
and body politic because at that time the na-
tion was facing economic challenges unseen 
since the Great Depression: Americans were 
losing their jobs at a frightening rate of 
800,000 per month; the national unemploy-
ment rate had risen to 7.8 percent and would 
continue to climb until reaching its peak of 
10.0 percent in October 2009. 
For African Americans, the numbers were 
much grimmer, a jobless rate of 13.5 percent 
in January 2009 which would grow to 16.5 
percent by the end of the year. 
And on top of this, tens of thousands of 
American families each month were losing 
their health insurance and their homes to fore-
closure.

January 28, 2020 
And the average price of gas exceeded $4 
per gallon. 
It was against this backdrop that the new 
President 
of 
the 
United 
States, 
Barack 
Obama, rose to take the oath of office. 
After being sworn in as the nation’s 44th 
President, President Obama reassured an 
anxious but hopeful nation, saying: 
‘‘Today I say to you that the challenges we 
face are real. They are serious and they are 
many. They will not be met easily or in a short 
span of time. But know this America: They will 
be met.’’ 
Because of the actions President Obama 
took, not to further the interests of himself but 
of the American people, these challenges 
were more than met and overcome and for 
that Barack Obama’s presidency is regarded 
by historians as a consequential presidency 
that changed America for the better. 
Madam Speaker, before Trump took office 
in January 2017, the economy had recovered 
from the Great Recession and overall eco-
nomic indicators were already strong and were 
trending stronger. 
Unemployment had been cut by more than 
half during the Obama administration, from a 
peak of 10 percent to 4.7 percent. 
The economy had experienced 76 consecu-
tive months of job growth, the longest sus-
tained period of growth in American history. 
GDP growth was strong, average of 2.6 per-
cent annually in the last 11 quarters of the 
Obama Administration and median household 
income growth was strong and trending up-
ward, increasing $4,800 during in last two 
years of the Obama administration. 
Even Greg Mankiw, chairman of the Council 
of Economic Advisers under President George 
W. Bush, had to admit that ‘‘the economy was 
in fine shape at the end of the Obama admin-
istration, despite what the current President 
falsely asserts. 
Madam Speaker, I will include in the 
RECORD an op-ed published on February 17, 
2016 in the Washington Examiner, entitled 
‘‘Seven Years of Change You Can See and 
Feel.’’ 
President Obama actually had a plan to 
tackle the economic woes that were affecting 
the American people. 
Working 
with 
the 
Democratic-controlled 
Congress, the President signed into law the 
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, 
which created 3.7 million jobs and saved the 
jobs of millions of teachers, firefighters, police 
officers, and social service providers. 
The Recovery Act also cut taxes for working 
families, extended unemployment insurance, 
and expanded the Earned Income and Child 
tax credits, which disproportionately benefit Af-
rican American families. 
The Recovery Act ended the Great Reces-
sion, transformed the economy from one hem-
orrhaging jobs to one that has created over 16 
million new jobs over a record 71 consecutive 
months. 
The national unemployment rate has dipped 
under 5 percent for the first time since Presi-
dent Clinton left office, the deficit has been cut 
by 71 percent, and the Dow Jones stock mar-
ket index topped 18,000 in 2015, an increase 
of 177 percent over where it stood the day 
President Obama took office. 
And, as an added benefit, the average price 
of gasoline has been reduced from more than 
$4.11 per gallon to $1.80, the lowest price 
since before the tragedy of September 11. 
In short, Madam Speaker, President Obama 
bequeathed a booming and vibrant economy 
to his successor, who promptly took actions to 
undermine it and explode the national debt. 
Madam Speaker, the GOP TaxScam was 
the wrong policy at the wrong time because it 
showered benefits on the top 1 percent and 
large multinational corporations while doing lit-
tle for everyday working Americans and Main 
Street small business owners. 
GOP TaxScam also raises the nation’s debt 
by $1.9 trillion at a time when the economy 
was already strong, and when we are facing 
major long-term budgetary challenges driven 
by our aging population. 
And rather than devoting resources to wise 
investments in our workers and small busi-
nesses, the GOP TaxScam further burdens 
working families, endangers Americans’ retire-
ment security, and worsens our budgetary out-
look. 
Our long-term economic growth trajectory is 
unchanged and there is no sign of an invest-
ment boom. 
Real wage growth for workers remains mod-
est and factories and jobs are more likely to 
go overseas. 
The federal deficit is soaring as corporate 
tax receipts plummet and the tax code is rid-
dled with even more special-interest tax 
breaks and loopholes. 
THE GOP TAXSCAM LED TO A RECORD-SETTING $1 
TRILLION IN STOCK BUYBACKS 
The GOP TaxScam delivered huge benefits 
to rich investors and CEOs through record-set-
ting stock buybacks in 2018 while average 
workers struggle to pay for rising health care 
and living costs. 
Stock buybacks do nothing to improve busi-
ness operations or help workers. 
THE
GOP
TAXSCAM
SHOWERS
BENEFITS
ON
THE 
WEALTHY AND LARGE CORPORATIONS WHILE DOING 
LITTLE FOR WORKERS AND MAIN STREET SMALL BUSI-
NESSES 
The GOP tax cut is heavily tilted toward the 
wealthy and corporations and exacerbates the 
stagnation of wages for the vast majority of 
workers and worsens income and wealth in-
equality. 
The GOP tax law does nothing to help small 
businesses gain access to capital and grow 
their receipts. 
Only 5 percent of small businesses pay 
taxes at the corporate level and most of the 
pass-through tax cuts go to the largest 2.6 
percent of businesses. 
THE GOP TAX LAW ENCOURAGES COMPANIES TO SEND 
FACTORIES AND JOBS OVERSEAS 
Under the GOP tax law, income generated 
by American companies abroad face tax rates 
that are half the new top corporate rate of 21 
percent. 
Some companies may be able to avoid tax 
altogether on tangible investments made off-
shore. 
This further incentivizes companies to move 
tangible assets, such as factories and machin-
ery, overseas. 
Rather than protecting workers and their 
families, the GOP tax law tilts the playing field 
against American workers. 
THE GOP TAX LAW INCREASES DEFICITS BY $1.9 TRILLION 
WHEN
WE
ARE
FACING
MAJOR
BUDGETARY
CHAL-
LENGES DRIVEN BY OUR AGING POPULATION 
Even after accounting for any economic 
growth effects, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice (CBO) estimates the GOP taxscam in-
creases deficits by $1.9 trillion over the ten 
years 2018 to 2028—hardly the ‘‘pay for itself’ 
message we heard from the Administration 
and Republicans in Congress. 
Our friends across the aisle promised the 
GOP TaxScam would significantly boost eco-
nomic growth, spurred an investment boom, 
drove unemployment down to the lowest level 
since the 1960s, created jobs for millions of 
workers, and helped middle-class families 
keep more of their paychecks. 
All of these claims have collapsed in the 
crucible of actual experience. 
THE GOP TAXSCAM DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY BOOSTS THE 
ECONOMY 
In the seven quarters before and after pas-
sage of the Trump TaxScam, GDP growth is 
unchanged from the Obama economy, aver-
aging 2.5 percent. 
By 2023, the tax law’s positive effect on 
economic growth will fade away entirely. 
The GOP TaxScam Does Not Spur Busi-
ness Investment 
There is no evidence of an investment 
boom, which Republicans promised would be 
the key to unleashing unprecedented eco-
nomic growth and wage gains. 
Nonresidential business investment grew by 
less than 1 percent in the third quarter of last 
year, while business’ orders for durable goods 
(another measure of investment) fell in De-
cember for the fourth time in five months. 
Instead of encouraging investment, the tax 
cut triggered a record level of stock buybacks. 
GOP TAXSCAM NOT CAUSE OF LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT 
SINCE 1968 
President Trump is coasting on an eco-
nomic expansion—now the second-longest on 
record—that began under President Obama. 
The law has not changed the unemployment 
trend. 
The unemployment rate has fallen steadily 
since the end of the Great Recession. 
THE GOP TAXSCAM HAS NOT CREATED JOBS FOR 
MILLIONS OF WORKERS 
More jobs were created 
in 
President 
Obama’s last two years in office than Presi-
dent Trump’s first two years, a monthly aver-
age of 227,000 for Obama contrasted to an 
average of 191,000 for Trump. 
Monthly non-farm job growth has slowed in 
the first 35 months of the Trump administra-
tion compared to the last 35 months of the 
Obama administration—36,000 fewer jobs per 
month under Trump. 
The tax law also encourages companies to 
send factories and jobs overseas rather than 
protecting jobs at home. 
THE GOP TAXSCAM IS NOT HELPING MIDDLE-CLASS 
FAMILIES KEEP MORE OF THEIR PAYCHECKS 
There has been very little increase in private 
sector compensation or wages since the tax 
law passed. 
Real wage growth continues to be dis-
appointingly modest, and real bonuses in-
creased by just 2 cents per hour between De-
cember 2017 and September 2018. 
The law ignores the stagnation of working- 
class wages and worsens income and wealth 
inequality. 
In fact, only 35 percent of the tax law’s ben-
efits in 2018 will go to the bottom 80 percent 
of households making less than approximately 
$150,000 per year. 
EVEN THOUGH FEDERAL REVENUES HAVE RISEN, THE 
GOP TAXSCAM HAS CREATED A MAJOR REVENUE DEFI-
CIENCY PROBLEM 
Corporate tax receipts dropped an astound-
ing 31 percent drop in 2018, with total receipts

as a share of GDP falling to the lowest levels 
since the end of the Great Recession despite 
healthy economic growth and a tight labor 
market. 
Revenue last year was 16.4 percent of the 
economy, almost two percentage points below 
the 50-year average of 18.3 percent in years 
in which unemployment fell below 5 percent. 
By contrast, spending as a share of GDP 
last year fell right at the historical average. 
Predictably, the President and our Repub-
lican friends seeks to evade blame and re-
sponsibility for the fiscal mess and exploding 
debt they have created. 
Instead of redressing the harm caused by 
the Trump TaxScam, Republicans resort again 
to their past practice of blaming the deficit on 
the entitlement programs such as Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, SNAP, and veterans benefits 
and seek to slash these programs to the 
barebones. 
For example the President sought to cut 
non-defense discretionary (NDD) programs by 
$1.4 trillion, including cuts to Medicare and 
Medicaid, reduce funding for SNAP by $220 
billion or 22 percent, and deny infrastructure 
funding for, cash-strapped state and local gov-
ernments; and pile more hardships on strug-
gling Americans with $327 billion in cuts to di-
rect spending programs that safeguard basic 
living standards they need to get by. 
The President is obsessed with dismantling 
and destabilizing health care for millions of 
Americans by making yet another attempt to 
‘‘repeal and replace’’ the Affordable Care Act 
passed under the extraordinary leadership of 
President Barack Obama which provided 
health security to more than 20 million Ameri-
cans. 
Madam Speaker, we now entering Act III of 
the immorality play we predicted the President 
would write. 
Act I was the cutting of taxes for the rich; 
Act II was the inevitable exploding of the def-
icit we predicted would result and our Repub-
lican friends denied would ever happen. 
And now we have Act III, in which Repub-
licans claim to have newly rediscovered their 
horror over the deficits created by their fiscal 
irresponsibility and insist that the mess they 
created but be cleaned up by slashing invest-
ments in the programs relied upon by the 90– 
95 percent of Americans who were made 
worse off by the GOP TaxScam. 
The President should be embarrassed and 
ashamed of his economic stewardship and 
thankful every day to President Obama for 
tackling and solving the major economic chal-
lenges facing Americans.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF OFFICER KATIE THYNE 
(Mr. SCOTT of Virginia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today on a solemn occa-
sion. I have the honor of representing 
Newport News, Virginia, and last week, 
the Newport News community lost Po-
lice Officer Katie Thyne, who was trag-
ically killed in the line of duty. 
Officer Thyne was only 24 years old 
and was the mother of a 2-year-old 
daughter. The Newport News commu-
nity has lost someone who dedicated 
her life to public service. 
In addition to serving with the New-
port News Police Department, Officer 
Thyne was a Navy veteran, and she 
also spent time volunteering as a bas-
ketball coach at the local Boys and 
Girls Club. 
Only 11 Newport News police officers 
have died in the line of duty in the last 
100 years, and the last loss of an officer 
in the line of duty occurred over 25 
years ago. Officer Thyne was the first 
woman. 
I want to send my deepest condo-
lences to the friends and family of Offi-
cer Thyne, as well as members of the 
Newport News Police Department who 
are dealing with this tragic loss of a 
colleague.

CONGRESSIONAL WESTERN 
CAUCUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. NEWHOUSE) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
before I begin, I ask unanimous con-
sent that all Members may have 5 leg-
islative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous materials on the topic of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise this afternoon to lead a Special 
Order alongside my colleagues from 
the Congressional Western Caucus to 
discuss important efforts to modernize 
one of our Nation’s bedrock conserva-
tion laws that has sorely grown out-
dated and ineffective. 
The Endangered Species Act was 
signed into law 47 years ago to protect 
and revitalize species of endangered or 
threatened animals and wildlife, truly, 
a worthy goal. 
Unfortunately, the ESA has earned a 
recovery rate of only about 3 percent, a 
staggering failure to protect the very 
species that it was intended to aid. 
b 1745 
And while it has failed to safeguard 
those species, the law has been used as 
a political spearhead for frivolous liti-
gation that threatens private property 
rights, public land use decisions, local 
communities, and American jobs. 
Fortunately, there are ongoing ef-
forts in the people’s House here and 
within the White House to update and 
modernize the Endangered Species Act 
to better protect species, all while 
treating States, property owners, and 
local stakeholders as partners rather 
than obstacles to species conservation. 
The Western Caucus recently un-
veiled a package of 18 bills introduced 
by members across the rural West and 
beyond to strengthen the ESA. These 
bills reflect our intention to bring this 
arcane law into the 21st century, aim-
ing to create a more comprehensive 
and streamlined approach to support 
species recovery while ensuring our 
communities are not burdened by over-
regulation and misleading data. 
This package includes my legisla-
tion, the Weigh Habitats Offsetting Lo-
cational Effects Act, to ensure all con-
servation 
measures 
are 
considered 
when Federal decisions that impact 
ESA-listed species are being made. 
By establishing a process that con-
siders the totality of conservation ef-
forts, we can incentivize private invest-
ment in species recovery, streamline 
Federal decisionmaking, and promote 
the comprehensive efforts of States, 
local communities, and Tribes. 
We should not tie our hands when it 
comes to species recovery. Using the 
best available science, considering all 
ongoing 
conservation 
measures, 
streamlining the process for listing de-
cisions, and empowering State and 
local efforts creates a comprehensive 
approach to advance species recovery 
and fulfills the true intent of the En-
dangered Species Act. 
Madam Speaker, with this package of 
bills, you will hear more from many of 
my colleagues in the Western Caucus. 
We are taking a very important step 
toward truly strengthening the ESA. 
The Trump administration has also 
unveiled improvements to the imple-
mentation of ESA regulations devel-
oped to increase transparency and ef-
fectiveness of the law. 
Secretary of the Interior David Bern-
hardt has rightly focused on updating 
the administration of ESA to target 
the areas where resources will do the 
most good, which, of course, are the di-
rect, on-the-ground conservation meas-
ures. 
Much like legislation in the Western 
Caucus package that I and my col-
leagues have championed, the updates 
direct listing decisions to be based 
solely on the best science available as 
well as commercial information. Only 
when sound science, not politics, deter-
mine conservation measures can we 
truly begin to turn the tide to achieve 
successes under the ESA. 
The revisions also establish greater 
certainty for timely decisionmaking by 
Federal agencies and applicants, there-
fore providing streamlined actions and 
coordination for conservation efforts. 
With partners like President Trump, 
Interior Secretary Bernhardt, and the 
U.S. 
Fish 
and 
Wildlife 
Director, 
Aurelia Skipwith, I believe we truly 
can reverse the abysmal track record 
currently set under the Endangered 
Species Act. 
Unfortunately, we are seeing efforts 
right here in the people’s House to 
completely undermine and halt these 
important steps being taken by the ad-
ministration. Our conversation this 
afternoon is quite timely, I believe, be-
cause tomorrow the lead Democrat in 
the House Natural Resources Com-
mittee is marking up legislation to 
thwart the administration’s rule to

bring more transparency and mod-
ernization into the ESA. 
Why anyone would be proud of the 
status quo in which only 3 percent of 
the species that have been listed under 
this law have recovered truly does baf-
fle me. That 3 percent is quite the mea-
ger report card, so it is disappointing 
to see so many of my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle advocate for the 
status quo. I would hope they join me 
and my colleagues who are working to 
strengthen this law in order to provide 
real results, not simply evoking polit-
ical talking points aimed at appeasing 
litigious environmental groups. 
Madam Speaker, like far too many 
regulations that come from our Na-
tion’s Capitol, relying on top-down de-
cisions from bureaucrats only serves to 
limit economic prosperity. These deci-
sions have not only negatively im-
pacted local communities, they have 
done close to nothing to recover and 
protect threatened animals and wild-
life. 
I am looking forward to partnering 
with many of my colleagues from the 
Western Caucus this afternoon to de-
scribe our efforts here in the people’s 
House to finally modernize the Endan-
gered Species Act, something that is 
far overdue for our wildlife, for our en-
vironment, and for all of our commu-
nities. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Montana (Mr. GIANFORTE), 
my colleague and good friend, who is a 
true leader for conservation. 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Washington for 
yielding. He has been a leader in our ef-
forts to reform the Endangered Species 
Act and to return management of 
wolves back to the States. 
I also thank the chairman of the 
Western Caucus, the gentleman from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
GOSAR). 
Congressman 
GOSAR has been instrumental in put-
ting together this package of 17 bills to 
modernize the Endangered Species Act. 
I wish we were here tonight to cele-
brate the successful recovery of the 
grizzly bear in the greater Yellowstone 
ecosystem and elsewhere. The great 
news is the grizzly has recovered. Un-
fortunately, constant litigation has 
prevented the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service from delisting the bear and re-
turning management to the States. 
I brought Secretary Bernhardt of the 
Department of the Interior to meet 
with families, ranchers, and local lead-
ers in Choteau, Montana, just last fall. 
Parents told us how they put bars on 
their windows because the grizzly bears 
were looking in their children’s bed-
rooms. One mom told me of a grizzly 
bear that chased her into her home 
when the bear heard the sound of her 
child crying. 
At the point bears view children as a 
food source, we need to make changes. 
We have to put human safety ahead of 
the recovered grizzly bear. 
Misuse and abuse of the Endangered 
Species Act are also shutting down re-
sponsible forest management. Every 
forest service project in Montana seem-
ingly ends up in court. The result: We 
are unable to manage our forests, im-
prove wildlife habitat, and reduce the 
severity of wildfires. 
We must put commonsense guard-
rails on the Endangered Species Act. 
We must restore it to its original pur-
pose of recovering species, not serving 
as a tool for frivolous lawsuits from ex-
treme special interest groups that 
work to shut down critical projects in 
our State. 
To address these abuses of the ESA, I 
introduced the Less Imprecision in 
Species Treatment Act, or the LIST 
Act. The LIST Act helps modernize the 
ESA. The LIST Act empowers the Fish 
and Wildlife Service to promptly act on 
sound, established science to delist spe-
cies that have recovered—and that 
should be our goal. 
The bill allows the Fish and Wildlife 
Service to reverse listings that were 
made due to bad data, and the bill pro-
hibits abuses of the listing process. It 
will ban those who intentionally sub-
mit false information from submitting 
listing petitions for 10 years. 
These are commonsense reforms. I 
am proud to sponsor the LIST Act and 
support the rest of the package to bet-
ter protect species, increase collabora-
tion, and improve forest health. 
These pieces of legislation focus ef-
forts on recovering species native to 
the U.S. They ensure that data used to 
make 
listing 
decisions 
is 
publicly 
available on the internet, and they pro-
mote voluntary wildlife conservation 
agreements and candidate conservation 
agreements with assurances. 
We can and must modernize the En-
dangered Species Act to work better, 
and the Western Caucus has offered a 
path forward. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
gentleman from Washington State for 
his leadership on this. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. GIANFORTE; his legislation, 
the LIST Act, is exactly the kind of up-
date we need. It is a straightforward, 
science-based tool that equips Fish and 
Wildlife with exactly the kind of abil-
ity to make decisions based on facts re-
garding listing decisions. I thank the 
gentleman for his leadership. He is a 
great spokesman for the State of Mon-
tana, and I appreciate his help here 
this evening. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Missouri (Mr. SMITH), my 
good friend. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Mr. NEWHOUSE for 
yielding and for organizing this Special 
Order. I thank him for presenting to 
this body this piece of legislation with 
all the reforms of the Endangered Spe-
cies Act. It is something that is ex-
tremely important. 
Coming from the State of Missouri, 
we have folks who come from all over 
the country to hike our trails and to 
float our rivers. We are also home to 
the 
first 
Ozark 
National 
Scenic 
Riverway designated by a national 
State park in southern Missouri. So we 
have many people who come to south-
east and south central Missouri to look 
at our nature, to see the native plants 
and the native species, which several of 
them are designated within the Endan-
gered Species Act. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE made a comment ear-
lier about only 3 percent of the species 
come out of the Endangered Species 
Act, that they come back. By any 
other measure, that would be a com-
plete failure, and that is why we need 
these reforms. That is why we need 
these revisions. 
Nowhere is the pain of the Endan-
gered 
Species 
Act 
regulations, 
no 
greater place are those burdens felt 
than in local communities, and that is 
why we have the legislation, the EM-
POWERS Act. And it mandates—not 
mandates the communities, it man-
dates the Federal Government to make 
sure that they get local input from 
communities in any kind of designa-
tion for an Endangered Species Act. 
It is common sense. It is an easy ap-
proach. It is something that I think we 
can all get behind since they know 
their area better. 
When you talk about the Endangered 
Species Act, this is something that is 
very personal to me, and it is personal 
to the people that I represent in south-
ern Missouri. 
Just a few years ago, we had a young 
lady, 13 or 14 years old, who was float-
ing with her family on the White River, 
and a very unfortunate event happened 
where she got caught up underneath a 
broken dam and she lost her life. That 
family outing turned into a day that 
they will never forget, a day that I 
won’t forget. 
The big issue here is that dam 
shouldn’t have been there, or it should 
have been rebuilt or replaced. You see, 
the dam was broken in a flood several 
years earlier but was never replaced 
and couldn’t be torn out, even with the 
local community wanting to tear out 
the dam, the reason being because of 
an endangered species, one called the 
Ozark hellbender. It is a salamander. It 
was found in the White River near the 
dam, so that could be a resting place 
for this endangered species. 
Because of that, a young lady will 
never graduate high school. She will 
never go to college. She will never 
walk down the aisle. 
That is unacceptable. We are fortu-
nate now that dam no longer exists, 
but it shouldn’t have taken the loss of 
a life for Federal bureaucrats to get 
their act together to get that dam re-
moved. 
So this is one example that is ex-
tremely personal to the people I rep-
resent and it is extremely personal to 
me why we need these reforms in the 
Endangered Species Act. 
b 1800 
Government should not stand in the 
way of safety. An endangered species 
should not have more importance than 
a human life.

January 28, 2020 
I am looking forward to these re-
forms. These reforms bring sanity back 
to the Endangered Species Act through 
commonsense reforms, Missouri com-
monsense reforms, reforms such as 
transparency of the rulemaking proc-
ess. 
It helps put a stop to nuisance law-
suits 
from 
extreme 
environmental 
groups, using the best science available 
and, critically, bringing local commu-
nities into the decision-making process 
through my bill, the EMPOWERS Act. 
We all agree commonsense review is 
needed, but what we don’t need is re-
dundant and unnecessary paperwork 
that only serves to keep Washington 
bureaucrats employed. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Mr. 
NEWHOUSE for having me here tonight. 
He is doing the Lord’s work, and I ap-
preciate the honor of being here with 
him. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. SMITH, and I appreciate him 
for sharing some really personal im-
pacts of a law that—can anyone think 
of another law that has been in place 
for 47 years without any kind of im-
provements or changes? It doesn’t hap-
pen very often. 
When we see impacts like that, that 
impact people’s lives—they truly do— 
not only species that we are trying to 
protect but the people who are trying 
to live in concert with those species, it 
is something that really speaks, I 
think, to a lot of us. So I thank the 
gentleman very much for his bill. 
The EMPOWER Act, I think, will 
give a lot of much-needed change and 
improvement to this process so that 
States and local communities can have 
a say. We should have more positive re-
sults from the ESA and move forward 
from that abysmal 3 percent success 
rate that we should not be proud of. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. TIPTON), my 
good friend. 
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Washington 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to be 
able to highlight the importance of 
modernizing the Endangered Species 
Act. 
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
states that it implements the Endan-
gered Species Act by working with oth-
ers to conserve the ecosystems upon 
which the Endangered Species Act and 
threatened species depend upon and by 
developing and maintaining conserva-
tion programs for these species to im-
prove their status to the point that the 
protection of the ESA is no longer nec-
essary. 
I wholeheartedly agree with that 
mission, and we should do everything 
possible to be able to grant the Fish 
and Wildlife Service the ability to be 
able to better protect at-risk or endan-
gered species. I believe this can be done 
by utilizing local and State officials in 
a greater capacity. 
Much of that legwork doesn’t have to 
be done at the Federal level and can in-
stead be taken over by landowners who 
are out on the ground every day, work-
ing their land for farming, ranching, 
and for other purposes. They know the 
challenges that the threatened and en-
dangered species face. They are in a 
unique position to be able to provide 
input on the best conservation strate-
gies. 
That is why, with this concept in 
mind, I have introduced the LOCAL 
Act, to be able to incorporate that 
hands-on local experience, to make 
sure that we are achieving what the ul-
timate goal is: to actually rehabilitate 
the species, to be able to take it off the 
endangered species list, and to be able 
to protect others from being added. 
In the past 46 years of the law’s exist-
ence, there is one glaring statistic that 
points to reforms being necessary. 
Since the ESA was first signed into 
law, there have been over 1,660 species 
listed. Of those, only 54 species have 
fully recovered, or an underwhelming 3 
percent. 
These numbers speak volumes that a 
one-size-fits-all mentality does not al-
ways result in the way that it is in-
tended to. Not only that, but the red 
tape, timeframe, and expense to be able 
to recover a species is astronomical. 
It is important to note that the goal 
of the ESA is to be able to keep species 
off the list in the first place, not keep 
them on for undetermined lengths of 
time. 
Madam Speaker, I am glad to join my 
colleagues in the Congressional West-
ern Caucus to be able to highlight the 
necessity of ESA reform. 
In Colorado, we are proud to be able 
to have an abundance of wildlife, wild-
life that resides on our public lands 
and, in many cases, in our own back-
yards. As residents of the State, we 
self-promote taking extra caution in 
our lands so that they may be pre-
served for future generations to enjoy. 
After almost 50 years of lackluster 
results of recovering endangered spe-
cies, I believe it is time that we 
rethink our strategy and place more 
trust in the local stewards of the land, 
not just bureaucrats in Washington. 
If the goal is truly to recover species 
and to be able to protect species, let’s 
make sure that we have programs in 
place that are going to achieve those 
results that we can all embrace. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. TIPTON for his comments. I 
have to say that he just hit the nail 
right on the head. 
The 
ESA 
should 
encourage 
and 
incentivize voluntary conservation ef-
forts. Species recovery, habitat recov-
ery agreements, along with private 
property conservation grants and habi-
tat conservation loan programs for 
State and local governments, will save 
money and resources while boosting 
conservation. 
The more we can do this locally, the 
more we can direct these measures, the 
more impact they will have on accom-
plishing what we want from this con-
serving of species. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman 
for 
this 
commonsense 
ap-
proach, this collaborative approach 
that he has taken, and for showing 
leadership on all of these crucial issues 
that are important to us in the West 
and all over the country, to the whole 
Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR), the 
leader of the Congressional Western 
Caucus, someone who has shown a true 
sense of commitment to make the ESA 
something that it should be, something 
that is successful that we can all be 
proud of. 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Washington (Mr. 
NEWHOUSE), my friend, for yielding. 
I would like to first look at the Spe-
cial Order and give a big ‘‘thank you’’ 
to Mr. NEWHOUSE for his passion for 
solving these issues affecting the West-
ern States. 
Madam Speaker, I have been honored 
to be the chairman of the Congres-
sional Western Caucus for the past 3 
years. In that time, the caucus has 
been the leading voice in the charge to 
modernize the decades-old Endangered 
Species Act. 
It is clear that the ESA simply isn’t 
working the way it should. Statistics 
show that only 3 percent of species list-
ed under the act have been delisted. 
Madam Speaker, if only 3 percent of 
the patients admitted to a hospital 
walked out healthy, that hospital 
would be shut down immediately. This 
rate of ineptitude is not sustainable. 
Back in September, I was proud to 
organize and chair a forum of Members 
of Congress and more than 30 stake-
holders from across the country to 
hear firsthand testimonials about how 
the ESA is broken and to hear sugges-
tions for modifications and reform to 
make it work better. These testimonies 
hit home, exposing the fact that the 
Endangered Species Act is in disrepair 
and in desperate need of reform. 
There have been several very positive 
developments in modernizing ESA in 
the last year alone. The administra-
tion, with the full support of the Con-
gressional Western Caucus, proposed 
three new rules for the ESA. 
This new rulemaking is the first sub-
stantial amending of the act since the 
1980s. These new rules make the ESA 
more transparent and efficient, and 
they act more in line with Congress’ 
intent. 
In addition, I am excited about the 
Congressional Western Caucus’ Endan-
gered Species Act reform package for 
the 116th Congress, which currently 
comprises 17 separate pieces of legisla-
tion. This package includes six bills 
that were included in a similar pack-
age in the 115th Congress and three 
other bills from Western Caucus mem-
bers offered in the 115th Congress. It 
seeks to codify the three regulations 
recently finalized by the Trump admin-
istration. It also includes six new bills. 
These bills protect private property 
rights, encourage voluntary conserva-
tion, improve forest health in order to

preserve and protect species and local 
communities, increase multiple-use ac-
tivities, and protect critical infrastruc-
ture. 
The sponsoring Members of these 
bills come from nearly every geo-
graphic corner of the United States. 
These Members are taking constituent- 
driven initiatives and working to make 
them law. 
The need for a package like this is 
obvious. For example, forests are burn-
ing across the West on a yearly basis, 
in part because of ludicrous ESA re-
strictions. 
Similarly, I am sure everyone in this 
Chamber is familiar with some of my 
Democratic 
colleagues’ 
sentiments 
that if we do not pass the Green New 
Deal, the world will end in 12 years. 
What they do not talk about is that 
there is no way that their already un-
realistic renewable energy goals can be 
met without large-scale buildup of new 
power lines and other energy trans-
mission infrastructure. Under current 
environmental regulations, including 
the ESA, building pieces of that very 
infrastructure could take at least 12 
years, so I guess we are all doomed 
anyway. 
As I mentioned earlier, great steps 
have been taken by the Trump admin-
istration to bring the ESA into the 21st 
century. My Democratic colleagues, 
however, Madam Speaker, cannot help 
themselves and are preparing to fight 
these commonsense proposals instead 
of helping and getting onboard. 
Tomorrow, the Natural Resources 
Committee will mark the bill that will 
undo these landmark reforms to the 
ESA. This is, once again, a purely po-
litical act by this House, and it has no 
chance of going anywhere. 
Instead, I call on my Democratic col-
leagues to work with us to build on the 
new regulations from the Trump ad-
ministration to get the ESA working 
again and better protect species. 
Once again, Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague, Mr. NEWHOUSE, for al-
lowing me to speak during this impor-
tant Special Order today and for his 
leadership in highlighting the need to 
reform the Endangered Species Act. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. GOSAR for being here to-
night. He truly has been a leader in 
this effort to modernize the ESA. I 
thank him for his commitment to that. 
Legislation like he is proposing is 
going to be a huge step in improving 
the situation that we have in this 
country. So, I thank the gentleman for 
being here, again, very much. 
If I could just say, I think it will im-
prove the predictability for endangered 
species listings and critical habitat 
designations, but it will also level the 
playing field by applying the same 
standards for listing as we do for 
delisting a species. 
If a species is recovered, we should 
celebrate that. It should be a happy 
day, something that is a good thing. 
That is our goal. Then we can remove 
it from the endangered list so that re-
sources can then be directed toward 
species that still need to be protected 
and brought back. It just makes sense. 
I think the best example that comes 
to mind is the gray wolf. We should be 
celebrating that. They are back, and 
they are back strong. The science is 
clear about that. They are recovered, 
and it should be removed from the list 
so that we can better come to the aid 
of other endangered species. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman very much for being here to-
night. 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for hosting this Special 
Order. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LAMALFA), my good friend and fel-
low farmer. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. NEWHOUSE for his leadership 
on this and for providing this time for 
us here this evening to be able to talk 
about this issue in a very real and con-
structive way. 
The ESA passed in 1973, I think with 
a 
pretty 
strong 
bipartisan 
effort, 
signed by President Nixon. It was very 
well intentioned at the time, as were 
some of the other protection measures 
that were put in place for air and 
water. 
As we saw the other day here with 
the changing of the WOTUS rule, the 
waters of the United States rule, over 
time, regulations can get out of con-
trol. They can be used for politics. 
They can be used for controlling peo-
ple, for NIMBYism, and for no-growth 
and all that. I think that is really what 
these have expanded into. 
Our job is to provide oversight. Our 
job is to provide course corrections, to 
make sure the ship is on the course it 
was intended 40-plus years ago. 
The package of reforms that are 
being talked about by my colleagues 
and the bills that are being offered 
aren’t here to gut the Endangered Spe-
cies Act or to eliminate species. It is to 
bring back that course correction that 
we are looking for. 
Though it was signed 40 years ago, it 
is our job to constantly monitor it and 
make sure it is working. 
We talked earlier about that 3 per-
cent of species that were listed that 
have recovered. Now, 3 percent doesn’t 
give you a very good batting average, I 
think, in any league, so that would be 
considered a failure. 
It is not because of a lack of effort or 
lack of spending. Certainly, in my own 
State of California, where species have 
been listed, we have issues with fish, 
with delta smelt, with salmon, and yet 
trillions of gallons of water are ex-
pended flushing the delta each year to 
find a lower result. Only two smelt 
have been caught in their check traps 
in the last five quarters, I think. That 
doesn’t show success, but it shows a lot 
of damage to the people who need that 
water for other purposes as well. 
b 1815 
So, let’s find and focus on things that 
are going to be helpful to the species to 
be recovered and doesn’t have to dam-
age people and their livelihoods along 
the way. 
Reform is necessary to refocus the ef-
forts of the Federal Government to 
help them recover more timely. One of 
the longtime listed in California, the 
valley elderberry longhorn beetle, was 
listed for approximately 40 years. And, 
yet, in 2012, the Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice was saying: Okay, we think it is 
time to pull that from the list. Let’s do 
the work involved to remove it from 
the list because they had seen some 
success in that time period. 
An important part that we don’t talk 
about enough is what is known as crit-
ical habitat. Critical habitat is any 
host plant or other vehicle for a pos-
sible endangered species that might 
take residence there. 
So the bush itself, the elderberry 
bush, any one of those, basically can-
not be touched because it might be a 
potential habitat for a traveling elder-
berry beetle, although maybe none of 
them have ever been tracked in that 
particular 
area. 
Yet, 
every 
single 
bush—it is a battle. It is a fight. 
Now, why are we fighting over the 
bushes? It is because many of these 
grow in floodplain areas, on levees that 
need to be maintained, rebuilt, and up-
graded. We have a lot of potential for 
flooding in northern California. 
Indeed, it wasn’t so much potential 
as several times we have had bad floods 
result. And I would mention in the 
Yuba City-Marysville area, two very 
big floods in 1986 and 1997 that hap-
pened from crumbling levees. 
Why don’t they maintain the levees? 
Because they can’t. It is getting the 
permits and getting through the proc-
ess and then being able to afford it by 
the time you have done that with all 
the requirements that are put on to 
maintain this habitat. 
To maintain these elderberry bushes, 
in this case, makes it cost prohibitive 
for these local levee districts to be able 
to do their job. 
So, what happens? 
Nothing happens. 
And so, in 1986 there was a giant 
flood, hundreds, thousands of homes in 
1986. In 1997, it happened again. If the 
lesson wasn’t learned, 11 years later in 
1997, it happened again in the Yuba 
City-Marysville 
area. 
And 
at 
this 
point, three lives were lost in addition 
to all of that other damage. Three lives 
were 
lost 
needlessly 
because 
we 
couldn’t learn the lessons and get the 
permits done to get the levee work 
done. 
Why does that have to be? 
Because of roadblocks, because of 
endless lawsuits and slow-moving bu-
reaucracies that won’t issue the per-
mits and help with the funding that 
needs to get done. 
So, finally, after all that was liti-
gated, the government had to pay ap-
proximately $400 million in damages 
for the losses of life and property in 
these floods. 
It is pretty disgusting. But still, 
every single bush is litigated as a po-
tential 
for 
critical 
habitat, 
even

though there may not ever be one of 
the species you are talking about, in 
this case the valley elderberry long-
horn beetle, that might potentially use 
it. 
So what happened with the delisting 
in 2012? 
Well, they finally gave up because of 
litigation and about how they do the 
sampling of the beetle; how they do the 
sampling of the habitat of the beetle. 
They said, Well, we can’t tell if it is 
the valley elderberry longhorn beetle 
or the California elderberry longhorn 
beetle that might be making these 
boreholes in the plants and in the 
ground there. 
So they just gave up and said, We are 
not going to delist it anymore. 
That is similar to the situation my 
colleagues were talking about with the 
gray wolf. You can find plenty of gray 
wolves all over the upper Midwest and 
those other States. Yet, the standard 
seems to be in the Endangered Species 
Act, you have to find two or four re-
maining pairs in every single county, 
otherwise it is still listed as endan-
gered in California or anywhere else. 
The rules have gone too far. We need 
caps on the attorney’s fees that make 
it not such an incentive for environ-
mental groups to use this as a way to 
get paid as well as the way to stop 
progress, stop things that people need. 
So I hope this package of bills at 
least can be a light and example of a 
direction we are trying to take back to 
reasonableness and how the Endan-
gered Species Act is interpreted and 
used; not abused, not used as a weapon, 
weaponized against what we need for 
flood control to save peoples’ lives or 
water storage. 
If we are going to play the climate- 
change game, then we need to be able 
to have more of these tools available to 
us to store water. 
It would certainly help if we had 
more input from our local stakeholders 
on this who actually know how to get 
a project done. 
Finally, the Marysville-Yuba City 
area I was talking about, using local 
districts and local efforts, they did 
some amazing work after a lot of road-
blocks were overcome. 
So finally, the last bit—which is up 
to the Army Corps of Engineers—is 
going to be completed in that area of 
rebuilding the levees and putting the 
slurry wall in that is going to make 
them much less likely to erode and 
blow out. In 2020, the last piece is going 
to be done, if the Army Corps stays on 
their own unique schedule. 
This is many years after those two 
floods. So I commend the great work 
that has been done up to this point, but 
how many needless years of risk in 
these flood zones have to happen be-
cause we can’t get out of our own way 
because of a permit or because of some-
body’s interpretation of a critical habi-
tat for a creature that doesn’t even 
show up to these critical habitat areas? 
I am tired of fighting the fight 
against people who don’t seem to care 
how it affects the people who they gov-
ern. 
And so this is, I hope, a true effort 
that everybody can see to reform this 
act into something that actually works 
for people, works for the species, and 
gets a little better batting average 
than 3 percent recovery rate, which is 
pathetic, especially for the trillions of 
gallons of water we lose to the delta 
each year, the risk we have for people 
in flood zones, the high cost, the loss of 
potential, and the anguish that all of 
that brings. 
Madam Speaker, I am glad we had 
this time to be able to share this with 
the public that is watching and our col-
leagues who are hopefully listening 
that we can reform the act and still 
have it pursue the goals of making the 
endangered species, that we talk about 
and care about, come off those lists be-
cause they are thriving once again. 
We have seen some successful exam-
ples. The bald eagles, which I can see 
outside the window of my home in my 
rice field there, that is pretty tremen-
dous. But we have got to get our bat-
ting average up, especially when you 
look at what it is costing society in 
lost 
potential 
and, 
unfortunately, 
sometimes in lost lives. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate Mr. 
NEWHOUSE yielding me the time, and I 
appreciate his efforts on this. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. LAMALFA and have to say 
that he has been a true leader in the 
Congressional Western Caucus and in 
the House of Representatives. It is awe-
some to be able to have someone con-
tribute as much as the gentleman does 
that has the experience and the knowl-
edge of how these laws impact real peo-
ple. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to 
yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
OLSON), my friend who actually serves 
on the important, powerful Committee 
on Energy and Commerce. 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank my friend, Mr. NEWHOUSE, for 
yielding. He is from my birth State of 
Washington, Fort Lewis, the old Mad-
igan Army Medical Center in 1962. That 
was a long, long time ago. 
I thank the gentleman for coming to 
see the Petra Nova project in my dis-
trict, the only viable carbon capture 
project in the whole world. 
I thank the gentleman on behalf of 
the Congressional Western Caucus for 
taking the time to see real solutions to 
real problems. 
My bride is a girl from Los Angeles, 
California—Hollywood. This is a big 
time back home for my Nancy: the 
Screen Actors Guild, the SAG Awards, 
which happened last weekend, and be-
fore that, the Golden Globes. The 
granddaddy of them all, the Oscars, is 
coming up this weekend. 
If the success of the ESA was a 
movie, it would get a 0.0 Rotten Toma-
toes score. 
It would be a horror story that sur-
passes 
Hannibal 
Lecter, 
Freddy 
Krueger, and Jason. It would be a story 
of how misused ESA is a threat to our 
national security, global freedom, and 
guarantees 
more 
greenhouse 
gases 
plaguing our world. 
This story will be set in west Texas 
and southeast New Mexico. It stars an 
unremarkable 
creature 
named 
the 
dunes sagebrush lizard with best sup-
porting actor played by a radical, 
antigrowth environmental activist. 
The lizard lives on top of the Per-
mian Basin, the most powerful force 
America has had for peace and clean 
air in the past two decades. That hap-
pened because of reemergence of Amer-
ican oil and gas as the number one pro-
ducer in the entire world. That is be-
cause of the hydraulic fracturing revo-
lution that has swept our Nation and 
the world. 
The Permian Basin is leading the hy-
draulic fracturing revolution. Experts 
expect it to produce, by itself, 8 million 
barrels of oil per day in the next 4 
years. That is up from its high, a mere 
2 million barrels per day just 10 years 
ago. 
That means, one, American shale 
play will be a bigger producer of oil and 
gas than every country in the world. 
That means bigger than Saudi Arabia, 
bigger than Russia, bigger than OPEC. 
Two countries that emit the most 
greenhouse gases, they are China and 
India. Their only natural power source 
is coal. Right now, as I speak, mega-
tons of American liquefied natural gas 
coming from the Permian Basin, the 
Bakken shale play in South Dakota, 
and Marcellus shale play here out East 
are going to China and India. Their air 
will be cleaner because of American en-
ergy. 
It is a win-win for the jobs here in 
America, exporting technology to our 
friends for cleaner air and cleaner air 
in the global context. 
You would think the environmental 
groups would love this, but, sadly, you 
would be wrong. For 10 years, people 
who have never been to the Permian 
Basin and can’t spell Odessa if I spot 
them O-D-E-S-S, are pushing actively 
to have the dunes sagebrush lizard list-
ed as an endangered species. 
In 
2012, 
they 
pushed 
President 
Barack Obama hard to have that list-
ing. President Obama said, No, it is un-
necessary. The locals are taking care of 
the issue by themselves. President 
Obama was right. The species is still 
with us today. But that hasn’t stopped 
these liberals from using the Endan-
gered Species Act to support OPEC and 
Russian energy. 
They filed another lawsuit this past 
summer that is going through the 
courts. They know by doing that, they 
hinder 
growth 
because 
people 
are 
afraid to invest in the place that may 
have a pop-up endangered species that 
is not actually endangered. 
These groups follow someone from 
Hollywood who is not a real person. His 
name is Forrest Gump. His motto is: 
‘‘Stupid is as stupid does.’’ 
Enough of the stupidity. The ESA 
must focus on species, not political

dreams: My bill, the Listing Reform 
Act, H.R. 5585, addresses this exact 
problem. 
I close by saying something we all 
know: ‘‘Ye shall know the truth, and 
the truth shall set you free.’’ 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his comments. 
I did have the privilege of visiting the 
gentleman’s district and seeing first-
hand the Parish Generating Station, a 
state-of-the-art carbon capture and se-
questration facility. It was amazing 
and truly helped me understand the po-
tential of the technology that we now 
have at our disposal. 
It is that kind of thing that will 
allow our Nation to truly lead in the 
American energy renaissance. 
b 1830 
Unfortunately, all too often, some of 
the complications from the bureauc-
racy get in the way, and things like the 
ESA can prevent us from reaching our 
full potential. 
I thank the gentleman for his leader-
ship and ensuring that the economic ef-
fects are something too that we need to 
take into account. I appreciate the 
gentleman’s contributions here this 
evening. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the Fifth Congressional 
District of the great State of Arizona 
(Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my 
friend 
from 
Washington 
(Mr. 
NEWHOUSE). I appreciate his leadership 
and work on these very important 
issues. 
I am grateful to have a few minutes 
to speak and to address some of these 
issues that confront us as a nation and 
confront us in the Western part of this 
country, particularly in Arizona. 
Land management and species man-
agement 
are 
critically 
important 
issues everywhere in this country, es-
pecially so in the West. Nationwide, 
the Federal Government owns one out 
of every three acres. But when you go 
to the West, Madam Speaker, it is one 
out of every two acres. In fact, in my 
State of Arizona, only about 20 percent 
of the total land area is in private 
hands. Federal holdings actually ex-
ceed the size of the State of Virginia. 
Of course, Federal control over land 
means that bureaucrats in Washington, 
D.C., rather than knowledgeable State 
and local officials get to set the rules, 
and that certainly is the case when it 
comes to the Endangered Species Act. 
ESA listings, in theory, are meant to 
give short-term support for species re-
covery. They are not supposed to turn 
into permanent classifications. How-
ever, as we have been hearing a litany 
of stories in this Special Order to-
night—and as everyone who partici-
pates in this country knows—the re-
ality is far different. In fact, less than 
2 percent of species have been removed 
from the ESA list. 
Another significant problem is that 
current Fish and Wildlife Service poli-
cies make it far easier to list a new 
species than to examine the current 
list for potential removal. 
Excessive ESA listings place enor-
mously costly requirements on private 
landowners and even State and local 
government agencies. 
For this reason, I introduced the 
LIST Act in the last Congress to great-
ly speed up the rate in which recovered 
species may be taken off the ESA list 
once the Secretary of the Interior re-
ceives objective data that the species 
in question has recovered. I am pleased 
to see that my good friend from Mon-
tana, Representative GREG GIANFORTE, 
is championing the LIST Act this year. 
It is a great piece of legislation. 
Meanwhile, I am aiming to reform 
the ESA from an entirely different per-
spective with a new bill I introduced 
last week that I am calling the Amer-
ican Sovereignty and Species Protec-
tion Act. 
I would bet that most Americans 
would be surprised to learn that the 
ESA currently allows the U.S. Govern-
ment to buy foreign land—that is 
right, non-U.S. land, land in foreign na-
tions—to protect endangered species in 
other countries. While this may be a 
well-intentioned policy, it is tragically 
naive. Remember that just because a 
Department of the Interior official pur-
chases foreign land with the hope that 
it will be used to protect an endangered 
species, it does not mean that a foreign 
government will see things in the same 
way. Because the U.S. does not have 
sovereignty over the internal affairs of 
other nations, and exerts especially lit-
tle influence over the developing na-
tions in which so many endangered spe-
cies live, I would much rather see tax-
payer dollars used to advance domestic 
priorities. 
The American Sovereignty and Spe-
cies Protection Act, the LIST Act, and 
all the other ESA modernization ef-
forts we have been talking about today 
in this packet of bills will help us to 
scale back bureaucratic overreach and 
still ensure that critically endangered 
species are protected. Both aims are 
achievable. 
As the Western Caucus’ chief regu-
latory officer, I will work with great 
leaders like those who have spoken and 
like our host today, DAN NEWHOUSE 
from Washington, to ensure that our 
goals are met. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Mr. 
NEWHOUSE for his leadership and for 
yielding. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman helping us 
here this evening as we get down to the 
final few minutes of our hour. 
While the thought behind foreign 
land acquisition in the ESA may have 
been well-intentioned, we need ac-
countability, and we need to be able to 
determine whether results are being 
achieved. 
The point the gentleman made about 
investing in our efforts domestically 
makes a lot of sense where we can 
focus on a results-driven approach 
using science and not emotion. So I 
thank my friend very much for that 
thought. 
In trying to accommodate schedules, 
if I may, I yield to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for a few 
thoughts that he has on this. He is a 
member of the Western Caucus. We are 
happy to adopt South Carolina as a 
Western State. 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend for his leadership on 
this issue and for what he has done 
over a long period of time to help this 
all-important issue. 
Let me just echo what has already 
been said. I am a real estate developer. 
I have felt the effects of the bureau-
cratic overreach of the Endangered 
Species Act. I have seen where a 
heelsplitter snail can slow up projects 
for as many as 4 to 5 years. 
I have been watching from a dis-
tance, and now, finally, we have de-
cided to take action. I rise in support 
of the long-overdue efforts to mod-
ernize the Endangered Species Act and 
specifically my bill that would help 
continue protections for species while, 
more 
importantly, 
protecting 
the 
rights of individual property owners. 
My bill, the Property Rights Protec-
tion Act, would do just that. 
Everyone agrees that it is important 
to protect these species that are 
threatened or endangered, but far too 
often, it comes at the expense of the 
constitutional rights of landowners. 
This vital piece of legislation would 
ensure that we achieve both goals. We 
protect species, but we also protect our 
rights as property owners. 
If the Federal Government deems 
land to be critical habitat because a 
species is endangered, then they ought 
to compensate the landowners, plain 
and simple. I believe that there needs 
to be a more equitable way to treat 
property owners who far too often find 
themselves in this type of situation. 
This legislation will be an excellent 
step in that direction. 
Many landowners cannot afford the 
litigation costs that so many of these 
groups put before the landowners to 
get the rights that they deserve. 
I really hope that all of my col-
leagues can come together to support 
this important piece of legislation to 
protect our rights and species and, 
more importantly, come together to 
update an antiquated law that is the 
Endangered Species Act that has been 
in need of modernization for far too 
long. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate Mr. NORMAN’s thoughts. We 
should be doing everything in our 
power to incentivize landowners to be 
active participants in conservation ef-
forts for threatened and endangered 
species. 
Without oversight over whether cur-
rent restrictions set by the Federal 
Government would actually help these 
species, and with very little recourse 
available for the property owner, this 
legislation takes a very important step 
forward to ensure there is a collabo-
rative approach.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H623 
January 28, 2020 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the good 
gentleman from the First Congres-
sional District of the great State of 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate my friend from Washington, 
who is a great Member of Congress and 
who knows exactly some of the damage 
that the Endangered Species Act has 
done. We certainly have experienced 
that in Texas. 
We did, in the House, modernize the 
Endangered Species Act in my first 
term, 2005 and 2006, and it was quite an 
education to me because I thought the 
Endangered Species Act was all about 
trying to save endangered species. But 
I got an education. I found out that 
was not what the Endangered Species 
Act was about because if it was just 
about saving endangered species, we 
would have saved a lot more than 1, 2, 
and 3 percent of the endangered spe-
cies. 
One of the things that we did in that 
bill that I thought was common sense 
because I know there are landowners— 
I hear about these situations—and that 
is what they rely on to feed their fami-
lies. There is a doctrine that is not an 
official doctrine known as shoot, shov-
el, and shut up. Somebody sees an en-
dangered species, and they are scared if 
somebody sees it, then the use of their 
land will be taken away, and they will 
no longer be able to provide for their 
family. 
Even though I believe that it is a 
taking anticipated under the Bill of 
Rights, which requires remuneration, 
that is not what the courts have found. 
But in that modernized bill back in my 
first term, we said: Look, if you are 
going to tell a landowner he can’t use 
his land, or she can’t use her land, then 
you ought to pay them because you 
have taken away the use. 
I was shocked to find that there were 
people on the other side of the aisle 
who said: No, no, no. We don’t want 
that in there. 
But that will save species; people will 
be more willing to volunteer that they 
found an endangered species. 
The answer was: Well, they shouldn’t 
even have that land anyway. 
I appreciate the efforts of the gen-
tleman from Washington. Hopefully, 
we can work together because we do in-
deed care about endangered species, 
and modernization will allow us to save 
a whole lot more than 1, 2, or 3 percent. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. GOHMERT. The gentleman 
knows full well from his time serving 
on the House Natural Resources Com-
mittee just how ineffective the current 
ESA is performing. I thank the gen-
tleman for his leadership and for spear-
heading the SAVES Act, as he de-
scribed, to enhance our conservation 
measures for endangered species. 
Madam Speaker, you just heard from 
a variety of members from the Con-
gressional Western Caucus who rep-
resent not only rural districts in the 
West but also communities across the 
Nation, from Montana to Missouri, 
from South Carolina to California. 
Their message was clear: We must 
modernize the ESA. Doing so will be 
good for the species. It will be good for 
communities. It will be good for tax-
payers. And it will be good for our 
economy. 
A few Members were unable to join 
us tonight. I want to list some of the 
bills that they are sponsoring: Con-
gresswoman CHENEY’s Increasing Ac-
cess and Multiple Use Act, Congress-
man WESTERMAN’s PETITION Act, Con-
gressman 
MIKE
JOHNSON’s 
Critical 
Habitat Improvement Act, Congress-
man YOUNG’s LAMP Act, Congressman 
STEWART’s Critical Infrastructure Act, 
Congressman 
CALVERT’s 
FISH 
Act, 
Congressman 
MCCLINTOCK’s 
Endan-
gered Species Transparency and Rea-
sonableness 
Act, 
and 
Congressman 
BUCK’s Threatened Species Protection 
Improvement Act. 
All of these bills are critical for a 
comprehensive update to ensure the 
ESA accomplishes what it was designed 
to do: recover threatened and endan-
gered animals and wildlife. 
This package is supported by dozens 
of organizations, including the Na-
tional Rural Electric Cooperative Asso-
ciation, the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, the National Association of 
Counties, the Family Farm Alliance, 
the National Endangered Species Act 
Reform Coalition, the American Gen-
eral Contractors Association, the Inde-
pendent 
Petroleum 
Association 
of 
America, the National Association of 
Home Builders, the Western Energy Al-
liance, the United Snowmobile Asso-
ciation, the National Mining Associa-
tion, American Agri-Women, and the 
National 
Cotton 
Council, 
amongst 
many, many, many others. 
As we continue to push for reforms to 
the ESA in the people’s House and 
work with the administration and the 
White House to support the Depart-
ment of the Interior’s updated imple-
mentation regulations, I hope that my 
colleagues will join us in recognizing 
that we can do so much better to re-
cover our Nation’s magnificent flora 
and fauna. 
The Western Caucus will remain at 
the forefront of this effort. A 3 percent 
success rate is failing our wildlife 
across this beautiful country. We must 
do better. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

WHY IMPOUNDMENT CONTROL ACT 
MATTERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. YAR-
MUTH) for 30 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and insert extraneous material 
on my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kentucky? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, a 
week from today, we will hear about 
the state of our Union from an im-
peached President who has repeatedly 
shown a complete disregard for the 
principles on which that union was 
founded. 
President Trump has brazenly tram-
pled the constitutional boundaries of 
executive power, damaging the founda-
tion of our democracy. He shamelessly 
betrayed his oath of office by putting 
his own corrupt agenda before our na-
tional security. 
His withholding of aid to Ukraine has 
dominated the news, but the adminis-
tration’s willingness to pervert our 
laws for President Trump’s ego, per-
sonal vendettas, and political gains 
goes much deeper. 
Earlier this month, the nonpartisan 
U.S. Government Accountability Of-
fice, or GAO, issued a legal opinion 
stating that Trump’s Office of Manage-
ment and Budget, OMB, violated Fed-
eral law, specifically the Impoundment 
Control Act of 1974, by withholding for-
eign aid. 
Madam Speaker, I will include that 
opinion in the RECORD. 
b 1845 
As chairman of the Budget Com-
mittee, which has jurisdiction over this 
law, it is my responsibility to provide 
the full story to the American people 
and to Members of Congress so that we 
can all fully understand what is hap-
pening to our government. 
To start with, this violation of Fed-
eral law was not an innocent mistake. 
Withholding Ukrainian aid was an in-
tentional and brazen abuse of power. 
This quid pro quo is the most egregious 
example that we know of, but the 
Budget Committee has been concerned 
by OMB’s questionable behavior and 
apparent violations of the Impound-
ment Control Act for some time. 
A deeper look clearly reveals how 
methodically the President and his ad-
ministration have been circumventing 
our laws to advance their authori-
tarian view of executive power. To un-
derstand their scheme, we must under-
stand the law they tried to secretly 
dodge and ultimately broke, the Im-
poundment Control Act. 
The U.S. Constitution grants Con-
gress the power to appropriate our tax 
dollars, while the President’s adminis-
tration carries out these spending deci-
sions. It is a simple but incredibly im-
portant check on executive power. 
In 1974, Congress passed the Impound-
ment Control Act, the ICA, in response 
to another law-breaking 
President, 
President Nixon. By refusing to spend 
congressionally appropriated funds for 
programs he opposed, such as funding 
for clean drinking water, Nixon’s ad-
ministration was impounding funds. 
An impoundment means any action 
or inaction that prevents Federal funds

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

January 28, 2020 
from being obligated or spent, either 
temporarily or permanently. 
By passing the ICA, Congress re-
asserted its constitutional power of the 
purse by establishing procedures to 
block the President and other govern-
ment officials from substituting their 
own funding decisions for those of Con-
gress. 
It created two pathways the execu-
tive branch can use to reduce, delay, or 
eliminate congressionally appropriated 
funding: They can propose to cancel 
funding, which is known as a recision, 
or delay funding, which is a deferral, 
but both must meet strict require-
ments. 
For example, if the President wants 
to eliminate funding for a specific pro-
gram, he must first secure congres-
sional approval to cancel that funding. 
The ICA requires that the President 
send a special message to Congress 
identifying the amount of, the reasons 
for, and the effects of a proposed reci-
sion. 
After submitting this special mes-
sage, the President can withhold those 
funds for up to 45 legislative session 
days while Congress considers the re-
quest. But if Congress does not pass a 
law to cancel those funds within that 
45-day period, those funds must be re-
leased. So even with this process, the 
President cannot cancel funding with-
out Congress’ explicit approval. 
Also, the President cannot use the 
recisions process to run out the fiscal 
year clock, in other words, to withhold 
funds for so long that they can no 
longer be used. We will come back to 
recision, so keep this in mind. 
Now, the ICA defines a deferral as 
withholding, delaying, or effectively 
preventing 
congressionally 
approved 
funds from being obligated or spent, ei-
ther through executive action or inac-
tion. But here is the catch. There are 
only three narrow circumstances in 
which the President can propose a de-
ferral: to provide for contingencies, to 
achieve budgetary savings through ap-
proved operational efficiency, and as 
specifically provided by law. 
Notice that policy reasons is not one 
of the three. 
As with recisions, the ICA requires 
that the President send a special mes-
sage to Congress identifying how much 
they want to defer, why, and for how 
long. However, a proposed deferral may 
not extend beyond the end of the fiscal 
year. Only once Congress receives this 
special message can the President 
withhold those funds. 
Again, the President cannot withhold 
funds for so long that they can no 
longer be used. 
I hope that didn’t make anyone’s 
eyes glaze over, but the details of the 
Impoundment Control Act are at the 
heart of this administration’s lack of 
respect for our Nation’s separation of 
powers and rule of law. 
Today, nearly 46 years after the ICA 
became 
law, 
Congress 
confronts 
a 
President and an administration eager 
to blow past the boundaries of execu-
tive budgetary power and co-opt Con-
gress’ power of the purse for the Presi-
dent’s personal gain. 
This brings us to 2018 and one the 
first red flags. My committee’s con-
cerns about ICA violations under the 
Trump administration actually started 
in 2018, when I was serving as the com-
mittee’s ranking member. 
Multiple reports warned that the 
Trump administration was considering 
a late-in-the-year recisions package 
that would have effectively started 
that 45-day clock close to the end of 
the fiscal year. As you recall, the ICA 
requires congressional approval before 
funds can be canceled. By withholding 
funds through their expiration date, 
President Trump and OMB aimed to 
game the system and create a backdoor 
recission. The White House had to 
abandon this scheme in the face of bi-
partisan condemnation. 
To send a clear message to the White 
House and to put an end to any future 
attempts at backdoor recisions, then- 
Chairman WOMACK and I, in October of 
2018, requested GAO’s legal opinion on 
whether an ill-timed recision package 
from the White House would violate 
the ICA. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the letter that then-Chairman 
WOMACK and I sent to the GAO. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, 
Washington, DC 20515, October 31, 2018. 
Hon. GENE L. DODARO, 
Comptroller General, U.S. Government Account-
ability Office, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. DODARO: We are requesting clari-
fication in the form of a legal opinion on the 
issue of proposed rescissions of funds sub-
mitted close to their expiration date. It is 
important that Congress remain at the cen-
ter of the decision of whether to withhold 
funds. To that end Congress should have ade-
quate time to receive, consider, and act on 
any rescission message sent by the Presi-
dent. 
Under the Impoundment Control Act of 
1974 (ICA), the President may submit a spe-
cial message proposing the rescission of 
budget authority and may withhold funds 
from obligation for a period of 45 calendar 
days of continuous session following trans-
mission of the special message. Public Law 
No. 93–344, as amended, 1012; 2 U.S.C. § 683. If 
Congress does not pass a rescission bill with-
in the 45-day period, the ICA requires that 
the funds be released for obligation. Specifi-
cally, section 1012(b) states: ‘‘Any amount of 
budget authority proposed to be rescinded or 
that is to be reserved as set forth in such 
special message shall be made available for 
obligation unless, within the prescribed 45- 
day period, the Congress has completed ac-
tion on a rescission bill rescinding all or part 
of the amount proposed to be rescinded or 
that is to be reserved.’’ 
As you know, the rescission process has 
been used this year for the first time since 
the Clinton Administration. Naturally, some 
questions have arisen. One question of par-
ticular importance to Congress concerns 
whether the executive can use the rescission 
process to withhold funds from obligation for 
the duration of the 45–day period, even if the 
funds expire before the end of that period. 
GAO has never issued an opinion on the le-
gality of withholding funds in this cir-
cumstance. We now request GAO’s legal 
opinion regarding whether the ICA allows 
funds to be withheld from obligation in this 
situation. 
Thank you for your attention to this mat-
ter. 
Sincerely, 
STEVE WOMACK, 
Chairman, 
JOHN YARMUTH, 
Ranking Member. 
Mr. YARMUTH. In December 2018, 
GAO issued a decision, which I will in-
clude in the RECORD, concluding that, 
while the ICA does, under limited cir-
cumstances, allow the President to 
withhold money for up to 45 congres-
sional session days, the President can-
not freeze the money for so long that it 
can no longer be used. 
GAO confirmed Congress’ constitu-
tional role, saying: ‘‘A withholding of 
this nature would be an aversion both 
to the constitutional process for enact-
ing Federal law and to Congress’ con-
stitutional power of the purse, for the 
President would preclude the obliga-
tion of budget authority Congress has 
already enacted and did not rescind.’’ 
Mr. WOMACK and I both welcomed 
this opinion from GAO, calling it an 
important confirmation of Congress’ 
constitutional authority over funding 
decisions. 
While GAO was deliberating, OMB 
submitted their views, as is customary. 
A letter from OMB’s general counsel 
seems to assert the belief that the 
President can do whatever he wants, 
that he doesn’t have to respect our sep-
aration of powers or the will of Con-
gress to cancel funds he doesn’t want 
to spend, that he is above the law. 
As GAO stated in their opinion: ‘‘The 
President has no unilateral authority 
to withhold funds from obligation.’’ 
‘‘The President cannot rely on the 
authority in the ICA to withhold 
amounts from obligation, while simul-
taneously disregarding the ICA’s limi-
tations.’’ 
This deliberate disregard for our laws 
undermines our democracy. The execu-
tive branch is not a monarchy, but this 
attitude is a pernicious problem with 
this administration. 
Less than a year later, in August of 
2019, a document, a letter apportion-
ment from OMB, was leaked. An appor-
tionment is a legally binding budget 
document used by OMB to set the rate 
at which an agency spends its funds 
over the course of a fiscal year. 
For example, we wouldn’t want an 
agency to come to Congress in March 
saying that it has already spent its en-
tire annual operating budget and must 
cease operations unless Congress pro-
vides more money. To prevent this, 
OMB apportions agencies money. How-
ever, this leaked letter from August 3, 
2019, raised multiple red flags. 
First, this letter apportionment, sent 
to officials at the State Department 
and the U.S. Agency for International 
Development, put an abrupt freeze on 
billions in foreign aid less than 60 days 
before the end of the fiscal year. 
OMB put a legally binding hold on 15 
key accounts that covered a spectrum 
of assistance, international control,

peacekeeping operations, global health 
programs, foreign military financing 
programs, and more. 
Similar to 2018, reports were circu-
lating that President Trump planned a 
late-in-the-year recisions package, de-
spite GAO’s decision just 9 months ear-
lier rebuking the tactic as an end run 
around Congress. 
On August 19, Senate Budget Com-
mittee Ranking Member SANDERS and I 
wrote a letter to President Trump’s 
Acting Chief of Staff and OMB Director 
Mick Mulvaney urging him to follow 
the law and to respect Congress’ con-
stitutional authority. 
Second red flag, this apportionment 
was signed by Michael Duffey, an ad-
ministration political appointee. Since 
OMB’s inception, career officials with 
knowledge and expertise of the appor-
tionment process and impoundment 
law, not political appointees, have 
signed these highly technical budget 
documents. This means that OMB took 
the unprecedented step of stripping ca-
reer officials of their normal role in 
the apportionment process and, in-
stead, gave this responsibility to some-
one who had been appointed by the 
President. This was, to say the least, 
suspicious. 
Third red flag, under current law, ap-
portionments are not public docu-
ments. OMB sent no special message to 
Congress to flag this hold on foreign 
aid, as the law requires; they kept Con-
gress in the dark. If the document had 
not been leaked, Congress might not 
have ever discovered this suspicious 
funding freeze. 
What else were they hiding? 
While this leaked August 3 letter ap-
portionment is what first alerted Con-
gress to the President’s willingness to 
break the law, at that time we could 
not have guessed how nefarious it real-
ly was. A few weeks later, the Budget 
Committee would uncover a pattern of 
abuse of the apportionment process, 
our separation of powers, and current 
law. 
As part of our investigation, my com-
mittee asked OMB for documents and 
answers detailing their involvement in 
the withholding of foreign aid. After 
review of the materials provided to us, 
it was clear that this was an inten-
tional and willful abuse of power. 
To lay this out as plainly as I can, I 
will outline what happened chrono-
logically. 
It all starts on May 23, 2019, when the 
Pentagon sent a letter to Congress cer-
tifying 
that 
the 
Government 
of 
Ukraine 
had 
met 
Congress’ 
anticorruption requirements and was, 
therefore, eligible to receive the crit-
ical security assistance it needed. Most 
importantly, the Pentagon notified 
lawmakers of its plans to spend the 
money. 
Keep in mind that this is critical 
funding Ukraine needs to protect itself 
from Russia, our shared adversary. 
The first sign of trouble came almost 
a month later, on June 19, 2019. In re-
sponse to our request for answers, OMB 
asserts that this is when they first 
reach out to the Department of Defense 
to ask about the Ukraine Security As-
sistance Initiative, or USAI, funds. 
Mark Sandy, an Afghanistan veteran 
and top career OMB official who is re-
sponsible for managing the flow of Pen-
tagon funds, testified that OMB offi-
cials were told the President wanted 
the Ukraine aid paused, but he didn’t 
understand why. 
So, while reaching out to the Pen-
tagon to learn more about the aid 
package, he also repeatedly pressed Mr. 
Duffey about why President Trump im-
posed the hold. But Mr. Sandy didn’t 
get a clear answer. He testified that 
Mr. Duffey ‘‘didn’t provide an explicit 
response on the reason. He simply said, 
‘We need to let the hold take place’— 
and I’m paraphrasing here—‘and then 
revisit this issue with the President.’ ’’ 
Just about a week later, on June 27, 
Mick Mulvaney was flying on Air Force 
One with President Trump when he 
fired off a quick email to an aide back 
in Washington. The email said: ‘‘I’m 
just trying to tie up some loose ends. 
Did we ever find out about the money 
for Ukraine and whether we can hold it 
back?’’ 
The aide, Robert Blair, replied that, 
while they could carry out the Presi-
dent’s request, the move to withhold 
aid passed in a bipartisan spending deal 
would not go over well with Congress. 
‘‘Expect 
Congress 
to 
become 
un-
hinged,’’ he wrote back. 
I don’t know about unhinged, but 
Congress was not going to let this 
abuse of executive overreach go unan-
swered. 
These early conversations are crit-
ical to our timeline because they show 
that this administration’s abuse of our 
laws and plans to blackmail a foreign 
nation into helping President Trump 
cheat our elections was premeditated. 
President 
Trump, 
Mulvaney, 
and 
Duffey abused OMB’s authority to 
withhold Ukraine security assistance 
at the same time President Trump di-
rected 
his 
personal 
lawyer, 
Rudy 
Giuliani, and his associates to solicit 
foreign interference in our elections. 
In July, they set their plans in mo-
tion. During an interagency meeting 
on July 18, an OMB staffer relayed 
President Trump’s order to freeze all 
Ukraine assistance to the State De-
partment 
and 
the 
Pentagon. 
This 
stunned and infuriated our own top 
Ukrainian diplomats, who understood 
the necessity of strong American sup-
port for Ukraine in their fight against 
Russia. Later that day, the House For-
eign Affairs Committee was warned 
about 
the 
hold 
by 
administration 
sources, urging them to investigate. 
But the bottom line was that there 
was no legal way for President Trump 
to withhold aid to Ukraine without 
Congress’ approval. Since it was a po-
litically motivated hold, it would not 
even qualify for a deferral under the 
ICA. If the President was going to hold 
this aid hostage, he had to find a way 
to go behind Congress’ back and se-
cretly impound hundreds of millions of 
taxpayer dollars. 
Mr. Sandy testified that, on July 19, 
Mr. Duffey proposed using the appor-
tionment process to implement the 
hold, that is, to use a legally binding 
budget document to withhold security 
assistance to Ukraine. 
Mr. Sandy also testified that, while 
approving apportionment schedules for 
agencies is routine, attaching a foot-
note to block spending was so unusual 
he did not recall another event like it 
in his 12 years of service at OMB. 
b 1900 
There is a reason for that. It could be 
considered a violation of the Impound-
ment Control Act. 
As you will recall, the ICA prohibits 
the President and his administration 
from withholding aid unless it is done 
under the authorities of the Impound-
ment Control Act, which require notifi-
cation to Congress, which OMB did not 
want to do. 
A week later, on July 25, President 
Trump had his now-infamous call with 
Ukrainian President Zelensky, where 
he asked a foreign government to dig 
up dirt on a political rival. Just 90 min-
utes after the President hung up the 
phone, Mr. Duffey emailed the Pen-
tagon, putting a hold on the Ukraine 
aid. 
In his email, which was only obtained 
under the Freedom of Information Act, 
Mr. Duffey shared OMB’s plan to ‘‘for-
malize the pause with an apportion-
ment footnote’’ that would come later 
that day. In another red flag, Mr. 
Duffey asked Pentagon officials to 
keep this ‘‘hold’’ decision as secret as 
possible. 
According to documents obtained by 
the House Budget Committee, at 6:44 
p.m. Eastern time, just hours after the 
‘‘perfect call,’’ Mr. Sandy signed an ap-
portionment that officially imposed 
what OMB claimed at the time to be a 
‘‘brief pause’’ in USAI funds. 
OMB inserted a footnote into the ap-
portionment that froze all remaining 
USAI funding until August 5. The foot-
note states that the funds are being 
held ‘‘to allow for an interagency proc-
ess to determine the best use of such 
funds,’’ but also that ‘‘DOD may con-
tinue its planning and casework for the 
initiative during this period.’’ 
Why would OMB allow the Pentagon 
to continue working on current plans 
and casework if they were claiming 
they needed to freeze the funds to re-
view those same plans and casework? 
Because this hold was never about a 
policy review. This hold was this ad-
ministration’s attempt to get around 
Congress and secretly undermine the 
law, to freeze foreign aid so that they 
could use it to pressure Ukraine into 
helping President Trump cheat to win 
reelection in 2020. 
It is the same hold that Mulvaney 
referenced in his June email to Mr. 
Blair while flying on Air Force One 
with the President, and it is the same 
hold that would ultimately lead to 
grounds for impeachment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H626 
January 28, 2020 
The July 25 apportionment would be 
the last one Mr. Sandy would sign. The 
White House needed to make sure the 
aid remained frozen while they kept up 
their pressure campaign on President 
Zelensky. But OMB career officials 
were becoming uneasy about the freeze 
and the illegality of using apportion-
ments to create secret impoundments. 
In an unprecedented move, Mr. Sandy 
was stripped of his authority to oversee 
the management of Ukraine aid, and 
the 
apportionment 
authority 
was 
transferred to President Trump’s polit-
ical appointee, Mr. Duffey. 
Remember that leaked letter appor-
tionment that raised red flags? When 
that apportionment leaked in early Au-
gust, Congress still didn’t know about 
the plot to withhold the Pentagon’s 
$250 million in Ukraine aid. So here we 
have 15 State and USAID foreign aid 
accounts on hold, one of which includes 
$26.5 million in Foreign Military Fi-
nancing funds for—you guessed it— 
Ukraine. On top of that, this appor-
tionment is the first one with Mr. 
Duffey’s signature. 
August was a busy time for Mr. 
Duffey. Someone who had never before 
signed apportionment documents start-
ed signing all the apportionment docu-
ments in both the National Security 
Division and the International Affairs 
Division instead of career officials. On 
August 6, Mr. Duffey signed the first 
extension of what was supposed to be 
the brief withholding of the Pentagon’s 
USAI funds, using another footnote to 
freeze the funds until August 12. 
Separately, on August 9, our docu-
ments show Mr. Duffey signed another 
apportionment affecting the State De-
partment and USAID foreign funds in-
cluded in the leaked apportionment. 
This time, OMB said the agencies are 
only allowed to spend 2 percent of the 
funds each day, and it withholds the 
rest from the agencies. That is not a 
programmatic, funds management, or 
even a policy decision. 
The State Department doesn’t send a 
couple thousand dollars to support 
international peacekeeping missions 
one day and then a couple thousand 
dollars to support international nar-
cotics control the next. That is not 
how it works. 
Limiting agencies to such a minus-
cule 
amount 
effectively 
prevented 
these funds from being spent at all, 
while at the same time, the apportion-
ment continued to withhold the major-
ity of remaining funds. It was another 
backdoor attempt to freeze funding and 
possibly rescind it completely by run-
ning out the clock. 
On August 19, Senator SANDERS and I 
sent our letter to OMB and the White 
House, calling on the administration to 
stop impounding funds, to respect 
GAO’s legal opinion from the previous 
December, stating that a late-in-the- 
year rescission request that prevents 
congressional action and withholds 
funds until they can no longer be used 
would violate the ICA. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD
the letter Senator SANDERS 
and I sent to Director Mulvaney. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC, August 19 2019. 
Hon. MICK MULVANEY, 
Director, Office of Management and Budget, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR DIRECTOR MULVANEY: We write to ex-
press our profound concern regarding the Ad-
ministration’s reported plan to submit a re-
scission request to the Congress just a few 
weeks before the end of the fiscal year. 
Under the Impoundment Control Act of 
1974 (ICA), the President may submit a spe-
cial message proposing the rescission of 
budget authority and may withhold funds 
from obligation for a period of 45 calendar 
days of continuous session following trans-
mission of the special message. In keeping 
with Congress’s constitutional power of the 
purse, however, such funding must be re-
leased absent approval by Congress within 
the 
45-day 
period. 
Specifically, 
section 
1012(b) of the ICA states: 
Any amount of budget authority proposed 
to be rescinded or that is to be reserved as 
set forth in such special message shall be 
made available for obligation unless, within 
the prescribed 45-day period, the Congress 
has completed action on a rescission bill re-
scinding all or part of the amount proposed 
to be rescinded or that is to be reserved. 
Submitting a rescissions request and with-
holding funds from obligation this late in the 
fiscal year could result in funding being 
withheld through its expiration date. In De-
cember 2018, at the request of the House 
Budget Committee, the U.S. Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO) issued a legal 
opinion that addressed this circumstance. 
GAO found that ‘‘the ICA does not permit 
the withholding of funds through their date 
of expiration.’’ Further, GAO determined 
that absent Congressional action to rescind 
the funds, 
amounts proposed for rescission must be 
made available for prudent obligation before 
the amounts expire, even where the 45-day 
period for congressional consideration pro-
vided in the ICA approaches or spans the 
date on which funds would expire: the re-
quirement to make amounts available for 
obligation in this situation prevails over the 
privilege 
to 
temporarily 
withhold 
the 
amounts. 
The authority provided by the ICA to the 
Executive Branch to withhold funds tempo-
rarily is necessarily limited. The GAO opin-
ion states: 
It would be an abuse of this limited au-
thority and an interference with Congress’s 
constitutional prerogatives if a President 
were to time the withholding of expiring 
budget authority to effectively alter the 
time period that the budget authority is 
available for obligation from the time period 
established by Congress in duly enacted ap-
propriations legislation. 
As the chairman and ranking member of 
the respective House and Senate committees 
with jurisdiction over the Impoundment 
Control Act, we affirm our strong agreement 
with the legal analysis and conclusions 
reached by GAO. We strongly urge the Ad-
ministration to refrain from sending a re-
scission message to the Congress; however, 
in the event the Administration submits 
such a message, it must take measures to en-
sure that the affected funds will be prudently 
obligated in the event the Congress does not 
approve the rescission, as required by law. 
To withhold these funds until they can no 
longer be prudently obligated or until they 
expire, in the absence of Congressional ap-
proval of the rescission, would violate the 
ICA and flout an important constitutional 
check. We trust that you will comply with 
the law and respect the constitutional role of 
the Congress to remain at the center of fund-
ing decisions. 
Thank you for your attention to these con-
cerns. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN YARMUTH, 
Chairman, House Com-
mittee on the Budg-
et. 
BERNARD SANDERS, 
Ranking Member, Sen-
ate Committee on the 
Budget. 
Mr. YARMUTH. At this time, we did 
not understand that the President and 
OMB actually had learned from their 
2018 attempts to circumvent Congress. 
But they learned the wrong lesson. 
Now, they were just trying to bypass 
Congress completely. 
By the second week of August, Mr. 
Duffey was issuing holds on USAI funds 
every couple of days to block the Pen-
tagon from sending aid. OMB was doing 
what it could to keep the President’s 
hold on Ukraine aid active, but on Au-
gust 28, a senior administration official 
told Politico about the hold on USAI 
funds. The President’s scheme was un-
raveling. 
On August 29, our documents show 
Mr. Duffey signed another letter appor-
tionment releasing 25 percent of the re-
maining State Department and USAID 
funds each Sunday in September. With 
this latest trick, it was clear these 
agencies were not going to be able to 
spend all the funds Congress appro-
priated before they expired on Sep-
tember 30. And in fact, they didn’t, 
which was apparently OMB’s intention 
all along. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Duffey was still sign-
ing apportionments to freeze USAI 
funds until September 12. During this 
time, DOD warned that OMB’s ongoing 
hold on Ukraine assistance would pre-
vent them from using all the funds 
Congress appropriated before they ex-
pired on September 30. And, of course, 
DOD was right. 
On September 18, Chairwoman LOWEY 
and I wrote to OMB, expressing deep 
concerns 
about 
OMB’s 
escalating 
abuses of its apportionment authority 
and its blatant attempts to undermine 
Congress’ power of the purse. Basically, 
we told them to stop their pretty obvi-
ous attempts to evade, invalidate, and 
violate 
congressional 
appropriations 
laws and the ICA. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD that letter of September 18. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, 
Washington, DC, September 18, 2019. 
Hon. MICK MULVANEY, 
Acting Chief of Staff, The White House, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. RUSSELL VOUGHT, 
Acting Director, Office of Management and 
Budget, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. MULVANEY AND MR. VOUGHT: We 
write to express our deep concerns about the 
Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB’s) 
increasingly dubious and politicized applica-
tions of budget law, as well as the role they 
have played in impeding other agencies’ abil-
ity to use their enacted appropriations.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H627 
January 28, 2020 
OMB’s actions have already damaged impor-
tant government programs, diminished our 
country’s security and standing abroad, and 
if continued, threaten to permanently under-
mine fundamental checks and balances in 
our constitutional republic. 
Specifically, during the last year, OMB has 
demonstrated a growing willingness to abuse 
its Presidentially-delegated apportionment 
authorities and impermissibly disrupt the 
balance of powers between the branches. The 
agency’s apportionment authorities may not 
be used as a form of executive control or in-
fluence over agency functions. Rather, they 
may only be exercised in the manner and for 
the purposes prescribed in the Antideficiency 
Act (ADA) and in compliance with other ap-
propriations and budget laws, including title 
X of the Congressional Budget and Impound-
ment Control Act of 1974 (Impoundment Con-
trol Act). None of those laws give the Execu-
tive Branch the unilateral power to invali-
date duly enacted statutes through the ap-
portionment process. 
Nevertheless, OMB continues to abuse 
those authorities, and the apportionment 
process, to flout the Constitution’s assign-
ment of the power of the purse to Congress. 
OMB’s inexplicable and unprecedented ap-
portionment actions have withheld critical 
funding provided for the Department of 
State and United States Agency for Inter-
national Development (USAID) in a manner 
inconsistent with long-standing policies and 
procedures. Those OMB actions are deleteri-
ously impacting the prudent obligation of 
foreign assistance intended to support U.S. 
interests, and are hindering the efficient and 
effective management of U.S. funds and pro-
grams. Indeed, those actions seem to be spe-
cifically designed to obstruct the agencies’ 
ability to use their appropriations for their 
Congressionally-approved purposes in the 
final weeks before they expire. We have seri-
ous legal concerns that those actions will re-
sult in de facto impoundments, and we are 
deeply troubled that this may be OMB’s 
unstated goal. 
The apportionment actions at issue also 
undermine important programs and policies 
that Congress funded, to among other things: 
Fulfill U.S. treaty obligations and support 
the nation’s international allies and part-
ners; 
Counter Russian aggression and Chinese 
influence across the globe; 
Respond to humanitarian crises all over 
the world, including in Venezuela, Syria, and 
Burma; 
Counter violent extremism in the Sahel, 
Yemen, and elsewhere; and 
Enable important initiatives such as the 
Indo-Pacific Strategy and Power Africa. 
Withholding funds through the apportion-
ment process until they can no longer be 
prudently obligated is a back-door rescission 
without Congressional approval. A year ago, 
OMB retreated from its plan to illegally im-
pound State Department and USAID appro-
priations through a cynically-timed rescis-
sions proposal—a misguided scheme that 
OMB threatened again this year, even after 
clear warning from the Government Ac-
countability Office (GAO) that such at-
tempts were in violation of the Impound-
ment Control Act. We are concerned that 
OMB’s intransigence on these issues has led 
it to try to accomplish through the appor-
tionment process what it had hoped to ac-
complish with a rescissions proposal. 
OMB has continued to push this unlawful 
agenda and perniciously broadened its sights 
to target funding provided by the Congress 
to the Department of Defense to counter 
Russian aggression. In particular, OMB with-
held funding provided for the Ukraine Secu-
rity Assistance Initiative, a vital form of 
Congressionally-directed 
assistance 
that 
helps Ukraine defend its sovereign territory. 
As with the State and USAID funding, this 
funding also expires at the end of this 
month, and recent estimates indicate that at 
least tens of millions—and potentially over 
one hundred million—in funds will expire as 
a result of OMB’s attempts to stifle the De-
partment of Defense’s access to this lawfully 
provided funding. This apparent impound-
ment has interrupted the Defense Depart-
ment’s work on security programs that have 
been in place with a partner nation for years. 
OMB also took the unusual and perhaps 
unprecedented step of delegating the author-
ity to execute these apportionments to a po-
litical appointee, in lieu of career civil serv-
ants who have historically been the des-
ignated officials responsible for overseeing 
and executing these technical budget docu-
ments. More than that, the apportionment 
actions taken by this political appointee 
have no justifiable policy, program, or funds 
management rationale. 
We are deeply troubled by this pattern of 
OMB interference with agencies’ use of ap-
propriations for authorized purposes. All the 
funding for the programs and policies men-
tioned above was negotiated in good faith be-
tween, and subsequently approved by, bipar-
tisan majorities in the Congress, and was 
signed into law by President Trump. More-
over, we are deeply concerned that OMB has 
intended that these actions take place with-
out Congressional oversight or transparency 
to the public, given that OMB has been un-
willing to provide apportionments even pur-
suant to written requests by our commit-
tees. 
We assure you that our committees will re-
main focused on OMB’s use of apportion-
ments and that we will respond forcefully to 
Executive Branch actions that seek to over-
ride the Congress’ most fundamental con-
stitutional power. We are actively pursuing a 
range of options to ensure that OMB is held 
accountable for any improper apportionment 
actions and to ensure that the Congress re-
mains at the center of funding decisions. In 
the meantime, we urge you in the strongest 
possible terms to return OMB to its function 
of administering enacted laws, to imme-
diately release for use all remaining expiring 
funds, and to cease further attempts to evade 
and invalidate the laws passed by the Con-
gress. We sincerely hope you can be success-
ful in restoring the trust that OMB has his-
torically held as a valuable institution and 
good steward of federal funding. 
JOHN A. YARMUTH, 
Chairman, House Com-
mittee on the Budg-
et. 
NITA M. LOWEY, 
Chairwoman, 
House 
Committee on Appro-
priations. 
Mr. YARMUTH. But then, Madam 
Speaker, the whistleblower report was 
made public. The report outlined how 
President Trump instructed his admin-
istration and OMB officials to put a 
hold on almost $400 million in Ukraine 
security assistance ahead of his July 25 
phone call with President Zelensky. 
The President abused his power and be-
trayed the oath he took before the 
American people to defend our national 
security and honor our Constitution. 
As the plan unraveled, the picture be-
came clear. The administration was 
abusing the apportionment process to 
secretly and illegally impound funding 
provided by Congress to protect our na-
tional security, to use this leverage 
against a foreign nation to help the 
President cheat our elections, and they 
couldn’t hide it any longer. 
On September 24, Speaker PELOSI an-
nounced a formal impeachment inquiry 
into the shady dealings of the Trump 
administration. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter of September 27 that 
Chairwoman LOWEY and I sent to OMB, 
seeking answers and documents related 
to the withholding of the Ukraine aid, 
State and USAID funds, and abuse of 
the apportionment process. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC, September 27, 2019. 
Hon. MICK MULVANEY, 
Acting Chief of Staff, The White House, Wash-
ington, DC. 
Hon. RUSSELL VOUGHT, 
Acting Director, Office of Management and 
Budget, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. MULVANEY AND MR. VOUGHT: 
The Committees on the Budget and Appro-
priations 
are 
the 
primary 
committees 
charged with overseeing and writing federal 
budget and appropriation laws. Consistent 
with our authority, we are continuing our ef-
forts in the 116th Congress to pursue produc-
tive improvements and reforms to the laws 
and authorities governing federal financial 
management to ensure that the Congress re-
mains at the center of funding decisions. 
Specifically, our committees are considering 
legislative proposals related to the appor-
tionment process and the withholding of 
funds, including in the context of the 
lmpoundment Control Act of 1974 (ICA) and 
the annual appropriations acts. 
As we stated in our September 18th letter, 
we have serious concerns that recent appor-
tionment actions by the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget (OMB) to withhold military 
aid for Ukraine and other foreign assistance 
constitute unlawful impoundments in viola-
tion of the ICA and are an abuse of the au-
thority provided to the President to appor-
tion appropriations. In the short time since 
we sent that letter, additional reports have 
emerged detailing the circumstances sur-
rounding the withholding of funding for 
Ukraine and OMB’s involvement in that 
withholding. 
According to those reports, at least a week 
prior to a July 25th phone call between 
President Trump and Ukrainian President 
Zelenskyy, 
President 
Trump 
told 
Mr. 
Mulvaney to withhold almost $400 million in 
military aid and foreign assistance for 
Ukraine, and ‘‘[o]fficials at the Office of 
Management and Budget relayed Trump’s 
order to the State Department and the Pen-
tagon during an interagency meeting in mid- 
July.’’ The reporting also indicates that 
‘‘[t]here was concern within the administra-
tion that if they did not spend the money 
[appropriated for Ukraine], they would run 
afoul of the law’’ and that, eventually, Mr. 
Vought released the money. 
On Tuesday, September 24, 2019, at the 
United Nations General Assembly, the Presi-
dent confirmed the withholding and added 
his reasoning, stating: 
As far as withholding funds, those funds 
were paid. They were fully paid. But my 
complaint has always been—and I’d withhold 
again, and I’ll continue to withhold until 
such time as Europe and other nations con-
tribute to Ukraine. Because they’re not 
doing it. 
The recently declassified complaint sub-
mitted to the Office of the Inspector General 
of the Intelligence Community (ICIG) on 
Monday, August 12, 2019 provided similar 
confirmation of OMB’s withholding of appro-
priated funding for Ukraine. The complaint, 
which appeared credible according to a letter 
from the ICIG, stated among other things:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H628 
January 28, 2020 
On 18 July, an Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) official informed Departments 
and Agencies that the President ‘‘earlier 
that month’’ had issued instructions to sus-
pend all U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. 
Neither OMB nor the NSC staff knew why 
this instruction had been issued. During 
interagency meetings on 23 July and 26 July, 
OMB officials again stated explicitly that 
the instruction to suspend this assistance 
had come directly from the President, but 
they still were unaware of a policy rationale. 
As of early August, I heard from U.S. offi-
cials that some Ukrainian officials were 
aware that U.S. aid might be in jeopardy, 
but I do not know how or when they learned 
of it. 
As reports continue to emerge, we have 
deepening concerns that OMB continues to 
demonstrate a pattern of impeding agencies’ 
ability to use their enacted appropriations; 
that recent apportionment actions taken by 
OMB to withhold military aid and foreign as-
sistance funding administered by the Depart-
ment of Defense, Department of State, and 
U.S. Agency for International Development 
constitute unlawful impoundments; and that 
OMB took the unusual and seemingly un-
precedented step of delegating the authority 
to execute these apportionments to a polit-
ical appointee, in lieu of career civil servants 
who have historically been the designated of-
ficials responsible for overseeing and exe-
cuting these technical budget documents. 
These actions have collectively undermined 
the longstanding application and predict-
ability of federal funds management proc-
esses and require closer examination by our 
committees to inform appropriate legislative 
responses and reforms. 
Therefore, to support our committees’ ef-
forts, we request that OMB produce written 
responses to the committees, no later than 
Tuesday, October 1, 2019, to the following 
questions: 
(1) a. When did OMB first instruct agencies 
to withhold assistance for Ukraine, including 
amounts appropriated in section 9013 of the 
Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 
2019 for the Ukraine Security Assistance Ini-
tiative and any applicable amounts provided 
in other appropriation acts for the Foreign 
Military Financing Program? 
b. In which Treasury Appropriation Fund 
Symbol(s) (TAFS or account) were amounts 
withheld? 
c. When was the first apportionment action 
executed for (each of) the relevant account(s) 
to withhold those funds? 
d. Were the withheld funds made available 
for immediate use by the agencies during fis-
cal year 2019, and if so, when? 
(2) a. When did OMB first instruct agencies 
to withhold funding in the accounts ref-
erenced in the letter apportionment effective 
as of 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on 
Saturday, August 3, 2019 (‘‘August 3, 2019 
Letter Apportionment’’)? 
b. When were the first apportionment ac-
tions executed to withhold those funds? 
c. Were the withheld funds made available 
for immediate use by the agencies during fis-
cal year 2019, and if so, when? 
No later than Tuesday, October 1, 2019, we 
also request that OMB produce the following 
documentation to the committees: 
(3) All apportionments or reapportion-
ments for fiscal year 2019 that were executed 
in the last quarter of fiscal year 2019, includ-
ing documentation of the approval date of 
each such apportionment action and any 
footnotes, for any applicable TAFS used for 
assistance for Ukraine or the Ukraine Secu-
rity Assistance Initiative appropriation, in-
cluding the Department of Defense, Oper-
ation and Maintenance, Defense-wide ac-
count, 97–0100/2019 and account(s) for any ap-
plicable amounts provided in other appro-
priation acts for the Foreign Military Fi-
nancing Program. 
(4) All apportionments and reapportion-
ments for fiscal year 2019 that were executed 
in the last quarter of fiscal year 2019, includ-
ing documentation of the approval date of 
each such apportionment action and any 
footnotes, for each TAFS referenced in the 
August 3, 2019 Letter Apportionment and any 
applicable child accounts. 
Finally, we request that OMB produce doc-
umentation to the committees, no later than 
Friday, October 11, 2019, on the following: 
(5) Documentation sufficient to show the 
obligational status of the relevant assistance 
funding to Ukraine by account, including all 
amounts appropriated in section 9013 of the 
Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 
2019 and any applicable amounts provided in 
other appropriation acts for the Foreign 
Military Financing Program, as of June 30, 
2019 and as of September 30, 2019, including 
the specific amounts that were (a) unobli-
gated, (b) obligated but not expended, and (c) 
obligated and expended. 
(6) Documentation sufficient to show: 
a. when OMB first instructed agencies to 
withhold assistance for Ukraine, including 
amounts appropriated in section 9013 of the 
Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 
2019 and any applicable amounts provided in 
other appropriation acts for the Foreign 
Military Financing Program; 
b. the amount of funding that was withheld 
from obligation, and in which account(s); 
c. when the first apportionment action was 
executed to withhold those funds; 
d. the period over which the funds were 
withheld; 
e. whether the funds were, subsequent to 
those withholdings, made available for im-
mediate use by the agencies during fiscal 
year 2019, and if so, when; 
f. the factual, legal, and policy bases upon 
which these actions were taken; and 
g. whether requests were made by the af-
fected agencies to reapportion the funding at 
issue, or to alter the conditions of the appor-
tionments in effect, and if so, whether those 
requests were granted. 
(7) Documentation sufficient to show: 
a. whether there was an ‘‘interagency proc-
ess’’ related to the withholding or use of 
amounts appropriated in section 9013 of the 
Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 
2019, and the basis for initiating such inter-
agency process, including its stated purposes 
and goals; 
b. what entities or agencies were involved 
in such interagency process; 
c. when that process began; and 
d. the conclusions reached through that 
process and when they were reached, includ-
ing the outcomes of any interagency meet-
ings that occurred on July 23, 2019 and July 
26, 2019 related to the disposition of the fund-
ing. 
(8) Documentation sufficient to show the 
obligational status of all amounts appor-
tioned as unavailable in the August 3, 2019 
Letter Apportionment. This documentation 
should show the status of those funds as of 
June 30, 2019 and as of September 30, 2019, 
and should show, at a minimum, the specific 
amounts by account that were (a) unobli-
gated, (b) obligated but not expended, and (c) 
obligated and expended.

b. how much funding was withheld from 
obligation in each account, and over what 
period the amounts were withheld; 
c. when the first apportionment actions 
were executed to withhold those funds; 
d. whether the funds were, subsequent to 
those withholdings, made available for im-
mediate use by the agencies during fiscal 
year 2019, and if so, when; 
e. the factual, legal, and policy bases upon 
which these actions were taken; and 
f. whether requests were made by the af-
fected agencies to reapportion the funding at 
issue, or to alter the conditions of the appor-

those requests were granted. 
(10) Documentation sufficient to show the 
timeline and basis for the delegation of ap-
portionment authority to the Associate Di-

2019. 
(11) All apportionments and reapportion-

for assistance for Ukraine or the Ukraine Se-
curity Assistance Initiative appropriation, 
including the Department of Defense, Oper-
ation and Maintenance, Defense-wide ac-
count, 97–0100/2019 and account(s) for any ap-
plicable amounts provided in appropriation 
acts for the Foreign Military Financing Pro-

Thank you for your prompt attention to 
this matter. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN A. YARMUTH, 
Chairman, House Com-
mittee on the Budg-
et. 
NITA M. LOWEY, 
Chairwoman, 
House 
Committee on Appro-
priations. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, 
while we received a partial production 
of documents from OMB, they left out 
large batches of requested materials. 
Meanwhile, the House committees in-
volved in the impeachment inquiry 
were getting completely stonewalled 
by the administration. If they did 
nothing wrong, why wouldn’t they turn 
over documents or allow officials to 
testify? If the President could clear his 
name, don’t you think he would have 
done it by now? 
Instead, the President and his Chief 
of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, have gone on 
national television and confessed to 
the very thing Congress caught them 
doing. Mulvaney’s response? ‘‘Get over 
it,’’ and, ‘‘We do it all the time.’’ 
In December 2019, the House Budget 
Committee released a report, which I 
intend to put in the RECORD, outlining 
three main takeaways from the docu-
ments produced by OMB. 
Number one, the timeline of actions 
taken by OMB, as seen in the provided 
apportionments, shows suspicious ac-
tivity and document a pattern of abuse 
of the apportionment process, OMB’s 
authority, and current law. 
Number two, OMB took the seem-
ingly unprecedented step of stripping 
career officials of their normal role in

the apportionment process and instead 
vested a political appointee with that 
authority. 
And, three, OMB’s actions hindered 
agencies’ ability to prudently obligate 
funds by the end of the fiscal year, by-
passing Congress and creating back-
door rescissions in violation of the ICA. 
Weeks after our report was published, 
the 
House 
of 
Representatives 
im-
peached Donald J. Trump for abuse of 
power and obstruction of justice. 
On January 16, 2020, GAO issued a 
legal opinion, stating that the actions 
taken by OMB to withhold foreign aid 
to Ukraine violated the ICA. The non-
partisan watchdog even went so far to 
say: ‘‘OMB’s assertions have no basis in 
law.’’ 
GAO found the White House’s action 
to withhold security assistance funding 
constituted an illegal deferral of fund-
ing in violation of the ICA. The ICA 
permits deferrals only for very limited 
purposes and requires advanced con-
gressional notification. But this was 
not just a notification violation. GAO 
determined that this deferral was pro-
hibited under the ICA, period. 
As GAO emphasized: ‘‘The ICA does 
not permit deferrals for policy reasons. 
. . . OMB’s justification for the with-
holding falls squarely within the scope 
of an impermissible policy deferral.’’ 
So even if the President had notified 
Congress in advance of the deferral, it 
still would have been illegal. 
The White House has taken a dis-
turbing sense of pride in its obstruc-
tion of Congress so it is no surprise 
that they failed to fully cooperate with 
GAO as well. In its decision, GAO 
called out the Trump administration, 
stating: ‘‘We consider a reluctance to 
provide a fulsome response to have con-
stitutional significance.’’ 
The House Budget Committee repeat-
edly warned the Trump administration 
about the ICA. The Department of De-
fense warned them. The State Depart-
ment warned them. Even people in the 
Executive Office of the President called 
out this flagrant abuse of Federal law. 
But the President ignored the warn-
ings. 
Instead, he used the powers of his of-
fice to subvert our laws, solicit foreign 
interference to help him cheat in his 
next election, and then try to cover it 
all up. 
While the House has taken action to 
show that no one, including the Presi-
dent, is above the law, OMB is still 
scheming. President Trump’s adminis-
tration continues to abuse its author-
ity and infringe on Congress’ power of 
the purse—for example, holding up dis-
aster relief to Puerto Rico. I would 
wager it is because the President 
couldn’t handle some criticism from 
one of their mayors. We shall see. 
Last March, my colleagues and I 
wrote a letter to OMB, which I intend 
to put in the RECORD, calling out this 
administration for declaring bogus na-
tional emergencies to steal funds Con-
gress appropriated for crucial military 
construction and counternarcotic ini-
tiatives to use for the President’s bor-
der wall, another decision motivated 
by the President’s political campaign 
and not taxpayer interests. There is 
more, I am sure, that we just don’t 
know about yet, but we will find out. 
In the face of this administration’s 
clear and present threat to our democ-
racy, we must defend Congress’ con-
stitutional authority, protect our sepa-
ration of powers, and strengthen the 
ICA to prevent such unilateral actions. 
In March, I will introduce legislation 
that will protect Congress’ power of 
the purse. It will promote transparency 
of the executive branch to limit abuse 
and ensure no President can hide 
lawbreaking from the American people 
again. It will add teeth to budget law 
by creating significant deterrents, in-
cluding administrative discipline, to 
create more accountability for execu-
tive branch officials so they won’t 
break the law, and it will ensure Con-
gress remains front and center in de-
termining whether emergency declara-
tions made by the President and the re-
lated shifts in funding are justified. 
Look, this is a lot of information, 
and I am normally not one to give long 
statements, but in the face of such hor-
rendous attacks on our democracy, I 
wanted it all on the RECORD. 
I am also submitting every letter I 
referenced 
into 
the 
CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD, as well. As chairman of the 
House Budget Committee, I felt it was 
my responsibility. 
It is my hope that these facts help 
expose this administration’s systemic 
lawbreaking because if they get away 
with this and Congress does not fight 
back, it will not stop. We all know 
that. 
He could attack specific communities 
by withholding funds that support 
their healthcare. He could retaliate 
against Senators for their votes by 
freezing Federal investments in their 
States. He could punish States that he 
views as unsupportive of his election 
by 
withholding 
the 
infrastructure 
funds. 
If we don’t stop him, President 
Trump will use our taxpayer dollars to 
punish political adversaries. That cre-
ates a destructive precedent for other 
Presidents who follow. 
I implore our Republican colleagues 
to join us in this effort to uphold the 
oath we all swore and to make it un-
equivocally clear that, in the United 
States of America, no one is above the 
law. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President.

REVIEWING INHERITED 
IMMIGRATION CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, it 
appears we are at least in the final 2 
weeks of this impeachment journey, 
and, therefore, it is time to begin to 
look at the issues that have been ig-
nored or kept out of the newspaper for 
the last few months, which I think is 
quite frankly one of the reasons why 
we have had this impeachment. 
I am going to address what progress 
has been made on these issues, largely 
President Trump making the progress 
himself without any help from Con-
gress, and then address what we should 
do in the next few months prior to the 
next election. 
I think the biggest crisis for the 
country that President Trump inher-
ited was the immigration crisis, and 
President Trump has had several suc-
cesses here on his own. 
b 1915 
He has reduced the number of people 
placed in the United States from in 
May, close to 100,000 people by the Bor-
der Patrol, certainly, over 90,000 by the 
Border Patrol and probably another 10 
to 12,000 people sneaking in the coun-
try without being processed at that 
time, to a position where, last month, 
the Border Patrol probably placed 
under 2,000 people in the United States. 
First of all, it is important to review 
what President Trump has done. He has 
begun what we would call a migrant 
protection protocol, in which Mexico is 
holding asylum seekers on their side of 
the border. They have agreed to hold 
anybody who is Spanish-speaking, and 
recently, in an unpublicized success, 
has begun a program holding Brazilians 
who are trying to get in this country as 
well. 
They also have an asylum coopera-
tive agreement in which Guatemala is 
holding asylum seekers who are com-
ing from other Central American coun-
tries without moving into the United 
States. 
I will point out something that 
should be obvious. If you are looking 
for asylum, in other words, to get away 
from danger in your home country, you 
shouldn’t necessarily have to come to 
the United States. If you are an asylum 
seeker in Honduras or El Salvador, for 
example, and you are coming north, 
and you are in danger in your home 
country, it would be enough to stop in 
Guatemala. You do not have to come 
here. 
In addition, we have begun an inte-
rior reparation initiative for people 
from Mexico trying to come here. Nor-
mally, in order to try to come here, 
you have to deal with the Mexican drug 
cartels. By the United States or Mexico 
repatriating people in Central Mexico, 
first of all, they are in many cases, in 
a more prosperous part of Mexico and, 
secondly, are not being dealt with by 
the drug cartels. And finally, you are a 
little bit further away from the border, 
which is something we should do in the 
first place. 
The next thing President Trump has 
done is he has completed 110 miles of

the border wall. We anticipate 630 of 
the 2,000 miles being done by the end of 
the year. It is very difficult to get 
through this wall and, actually, when 
you talk to the Border Patrol, they 
don’t even like to refer to it as a wall. 
They like to refer to it as a wall sys-
tem. But it is going to be over 30 feet 
high and six to 7 feet underground, 
making it very difficult to get through. 
Recently, the Border Patrol appre-
hended people who were kind of stuck 
going up the wall and they got up the 
wall to the point at which they weren’t 
able to get down. 
But in any event, when you combine 
all these activities of the Trump ad-
ministration, with very little help from 
Congress, as well as restricting entry 
of people who are probably going to be-
come a public charge, we have reduced 
the number of people being placed in 
this country from 90,000 to 2,000. 
So, what should Congress do? 
What President Trump has done so 
far is successful but precarious. First 
of all, President Trump is not going to 
be President forever, and secondly, a 
lot of what President Trump has done 
is going to be subject to possible review 
by a bad judge. 
Congress should immediately take up 
the following few actions, which I 
think any average American would 
consider okay, or consider mild. 
First of all, we have to change the 
credible fear standard. Not everybody 
who comes here saying they are in dan-
ger at home is in danger at home. Con-
gress ought to revisit that and pass 
something in the near future, hopefully 
soon. With President Trump no longer 
having to worry about the impeach-
ment, he can use his position to drive 
that sort of bill through Congress. 
Secondly, we still have problems 
with the Flores settlement and that we 
are restricting holding families to only 
20 days pending adjudication. There is 
no reason—I have been down at the 
border to see how well we are treating 
people who are held down there. There 
is no reason why we should have to re-
lease people after only 20 days if we 
have a court hearing coming up. 
Thirdly, we should change the cur-
rent law with regard to unaccompanied 
minors. There are people who claim 
they don’t like to see families sepa-
rated, but back in May, we had, I think 
it was 8 or 9,000 minors coming into 
this country unaccompanied by adults. 
Now, under current law in the United 
States, we can turn these minors back 
if they came from Canada or Mexico. 
We can’t turn around minors or send 
them back if they come from other 
countries. 
There are people around here who 
purport to want to keep families to-
gether. If a 15- or 16-year-old child 
comes here from Guatemala, because 
children are the future of any country, 
the Central American or South Amer-
ican families want their children back; 
and we should go back to the days in 
which it is legal to send back minors 
from other countries. 
The next thing we should do is, Presi-
dent Trump has had success in the 
courts with preventing people from 
coming here who are going to become a 
public charge. Obviously, as we look to 
let people in our country—and I am 
going to digress here for one second. 
There are people who say President 
Trump is anti-immigrant. The number 
of immigrants, the number of people 
who were sworn in legally in this coun-
try in 2018 was 761,000 people. That was 
more than any of the final 3 years 
under President Obama. 
I am going to repeat that if anybody 
back there says President Trump is 
anti-immigrant. More people were let 
in in 2018, were legally sworn in as 
American 
citizens 
under 
President 
Trump than any one of President 
Obama’s final 3 years. 
But it is important, despite President 
Trump’s victory in court, that Con-
gress step up to the plate and make it 
statutory that, as we pick which new 
whatever, 750,000 new people get to be-
come American citizens, we are not 
picking people who are going to be-
come a public charge. 
It is already a huge drain on the 
American people’s budget to take care 
of people who are in desperate straits 
who were born Americans in the first 
place. It is just horrific that people 
want to let people in to become a pub-
lic charge from other countries, par-
ticularly at a time that we are running 
trillion dollar deficits; not to mention, 
I think you are going to eventually 
have a problem with the fiber of Amer-
ica in the future if we let all people in. 
The next thing that President Trump 
has done, I haven’t mentioned, is he 
has, without a lot of fanfare, restricted 
tourist visas for people who are soon 
going to have children. 
I have been at the border. Until you 
have been down there you don’t realize 
the degree to which women frequently 
are coming to this country so that 
their children become citizens. The 
United States is one of only, I believe, 
two out of 40 western countries in the 
world in which you can become a cit-
izen just by being born here. People are 
taking advantage of that. Again, it is 
an example of us not picking the immi-
grants we allow in here. 
It is people being able to, first of all, 
have their children become citizens, 
and then because we want family re-
unification, the women who have the 
child are soon going to be allowed to be 
here without being appropriately vet-
ted. 
In any event, this is something that 
Congress ought to take up as soon as 
this impeachment is over. 
Extend the time you can stay under 
the Flores settlement; adjust the cred-
ible standard for people who claim they 
are in danger back home; change the 
rules with regard to unaccompanied 
minors so we can reunite those chil-
dren with their families. It is ridicu-
lous that that bill is being held up. 
Do something about the sanctuary 
cities which, right now, are a magnet, 
and they scream to people in other 
countries that we are not supposed to 
take our immigration laws seriously. 
Do something about the birthright 
citizenship in which we are one of the 
few countries around the world which 
says that if you come here, you auto-
matically become a citizen. 
But what other things should Con-
gress be tackling over the next seven 
or 8 months before we break for elec-
tions? 
Given the fact that we are broke; and 
given our concern that we do want to 
encourage marriage, where necessary; 
given that we want to encourage people 
to work and that we have a shortage of 
labor in this country, we have to look 
at our current safety net. 
Now, right now, the economy is good, 
and 
the 
number 
of 
people 
on 
Foodshare—which is a good indication 
of the number of people who are taking 
advantage 
of 
our 
safety 
net—has 
dropped in the last couple of years due 
to the booming economy. There were 
still 34,000 people on Foodshare in 2018, 
average. 
In 2003, another time in which the 
economy was largely booming, there 
were 21,000 people. What has happened 
over the last 16 years that we have had 
over a 50 percent increase in the people 
on Foodshare? 
The economy is booming. Obviously, 
what is going on is, Foodshare, to-
gether with many other similar pro-
grams, have changed the work ethic of 
Americans. What can we do to address 
the ease with which people become in-
volved in these programs? 
And I am not saying we have to do 
anything to the people who absolutely 
need these programs. But I can think 
of no reason why we would have over a 
50 percent increase in a 15-year period 
if we weren’t quietly or slowly chang-
ing the work ethic of Americans. 
There are three things that Congress 
should deal with, and that, hopefully, 
President Trump will champion. First 
of all, when I talk to people in my dis-
trict, they are aware that there is a 
labor shortage, particularly in the fac-
tories, and other places as well. And it 
is frustrating how few people can pass 
the drug test. If you cannot get a job 
because you can’t pass a drug test, you 
shouldn’t get public benefits. So drug 
testing should be done. 
The next thing that should be done, 
when I talk to people, particularly peo-
ple who work in our grocery stores or 
our convenience stores, they are frus-
trated that we, right now, have IDs on 
Foodshare 
without 
any 
photos 
on 
them. And again, the people who are 
working these jobs suspect, highly sus-
pect, that these programs are being 
taken advantage of. Congress should 
insist that we have photo IDs on 
Foodshare. 
And, finally, there should be work re-
quirements or an effort that people are 
trying to find work. This would be a 
measure of the sincerity of people as to 
whether it is possible—as to whether or 
not they are really trying their best to 
get off of public benefits.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H631 
January 28, 2020 
I am going to mention three other 
quick things that I hope are taken care 
of, that I don’t think any serious 
American should have a concern with. 
I was very frustrated with the recent 
omnibus bills, recent appropriation 
bills that dealt with a lot of the parts 
of the Tax Code. One more time Con-
gress did not have the guts to take up 
what I consider an exemption for the 
very wealthy, and that is the carried 
interest exemption. 
I know President Trump has asked 
Congress to look at this. Right now, 
highfliers who are venture capitalists, 
hedge fund managers—hedge fund man-
agers in particular—are getting capital 
gains treatment on what should be or-
dinary income. I can think of no rea-
son, other than Congressmen like very 
wealthy people, why, if you are a hedge 
fund manager making millions a year, 
you are paying tax at capital gains 
rates rather than ordinary income 
rates. 
Congress should have the guts to 
stand up to some of our wealthiest citi-
zens and tax them at the rates that the 
average working man pays. I hope Con-
gress will finally take this up and do 
what I know President Trump wants, 
and tax the carried interest of the 
wealthiest hedge fund managers as the 
average working man in this country. 
The next thing I would like to do 
that should be automatic is, when insu-
lin was invented, the inventor wanted 
it cheap and available to everybody. 
Unfortunately, right now, it can be 
wildly expensive, and it is much more 
expensive in this country than in other 
countries. 
What we should do is we should treat 
insulin, not as a drug, but as a bio- 
similar, and see what we can do about 
rushing it to market so that the drug 
companies 
cannot 
make 
excessive 
amounts of money off of an invention 
that was designed—the inventor want-
ed it to be freely available to every-
body. 
The number of Americans with diabe-
tes is excessively high, and the idea 
that, under current law, we allow mak-
ers of insulin, which I don’t really con-
sider a pharmaceutical, but makers of 
insulin to charge an excessive amount, 
when it was invented years ago, is ri-
diculous. It will take this body stand-
ing up to the drug companies, but it is 
something this Congress does not do 
enough. 
I realize there was a bill passed de-
signed to deal with drug prices in this 
House. That bill, we all know, was po-
litically unrealistic, and it probably 
would have resulted in a drastic reduc-
tion in innovation on generally new 
pharmaceuticals. 
But a separate bill should be passed 
on insulin and, hopefully, that is some-
thing Congress can do. 
The final thing Congress could do to 
help the average person is, in the fu-
ture, do something to restrict the 
amount of student loan debt. 
When I talk to people, they feel—and 
I believe this, because it was true when 
I went to school—there are people tak-
ing out more debt than they absolutely 
need. 
b 1930 
I suppose this is true everywhere in 
our country; people probably have too 
much credit card debt, more than they 
need, and they are not disciplined, but 
it is particularly true of 18- or 19- or 20- 
year-olds. 
There was a time in this country 
where, if universities wanted to, they 
could say: No, you don’t need $7,000 in 
debt this year; you need $4,000 in new 
loans. 
They are not able to do that any-
more. We ought to give that ability 
back to universities, and we ought to 
begin to sanction universities if too 
many people are leaving that institu-
tion and are not able to pay back their 
loans. 
I do blame the universities for part of 
this, and it is going to take some polit-
ical will to stand up to these university 
administrators, but they are the ones 
who are leading some of these people 
down the path with the nice brochure 
and the nice song and dance about how 
it is going to be so wonderful if you 
graduate from this university. Some 
people, of course, drop out of the uni-
versity. 
But either way, far too many people 
are not paying off the loans. They are 
having to spend way too long. They 
can’t buy a house. They aren’t forming 
a family. 
Quite frankly, it is a publicized scan-
dal, but it is still underpublicized the 
degree to which some of the best Amer-
icans who are doing what they are told 
are saddled with vast amounts of debt 
and not the income to pay it off; or, if 
they have the income to pay them off, 
it is taking all their income and they 
can’t buy a house and they can’t have 
kids. 
I hope Congress does something seri-
ous there other than just say we should 
put hundreds of billions of dollars into 
paying off the loans. 
In any event, these are things that I 
think Congress could take up. I think 
we could salvage this session. I know 
President Trump did all he could on 
immigration without the help of Con-
gress. 
I feel that the impeachment thing 
was designed to keep people’s eyes off 
the ball on the issues that we should be 
addressing. There are some suggestions 
of what to do. I hope the American peo-
ple insist they be done. I hope Presi-
dent Trump champions them. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
move that the House do now adjourn. 
The motion was agreed to; accord-
ingly (at 7 o’clock and 32 minutes 
p.m.), under its previous order, the 
House 
adjourned 
until 
tomorrow, 
Wednesday, January 29, 2020, at 10 a.m. 
for morning-hour debate.

BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF PAYGO LEGISLATION 
Pursuant to the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO), Mr. YARMUTH hereby submits, prior to the vote on 
passage, for printing in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, that H.R. 4331, the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2019, as amend-
ed, would have no significant effect on the deficit, and therefore, the budgetary effects of such bill are estimated as zero.

leader is recognized. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
we expect several hours of session 
today, with probably one quick break 
in the middle. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res 
483, the counsel for the President have 
15 hours and 33 minutes remaining to 
make the presentation of their case, 
though it will not be possible to use 
the remainder of that time before the 
end of the day. 
The Senate will now hear you. 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, just to 
give you a very quick, brief overview of 
today, we do not intend to use much of 
that time today. Our goal is to be fin-
ished by dinnertime and well before. 
We will have three presentations. First 
will be Pat Philbin, Deputy White 
House counsel. Then, Jay Sekulow will 
give a presentation. We will take a 
break, if that is OK with you, Mr. 
Leader. And then, after that, I will fin-
ish with a presentation. That is our 
goal for the day. With that, I will turn 
it over to Pat Philbin. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Members of the Senate, Majority 
Leader MCCONNELL, Minority Leader 
SCHUMER, I would like to start today 
by making a couple of observations re-
lated to the abuse of power charge in 
the first Article of Impeachment. I 
wouldn’t presume to elaborate on Pro-
fessor Dershowitz’ presentation from 
yesterday evening, which I thought 
was complete and compelling, but I 
wanted to add a couple of very specific 
points in support of the exposition of 
the Constitution and the impeachment 
clause that he set out. 
It begins from a focus on the point in 
the debate about the impeachment 
clause at the Constitutional Conven-
tion where maladministration was of-
fered by George Mason as a grounds for 
impeachment, and James Madison re-
sponded that that was a bad idea, and 
he said: ‘‘So vague a term will be 
equivalent to a tenure during the 
pleasure of the Senate.’’ That evinced 
the deep-seated concern that Madison 
had, and it is part of the whole design 
of our Constitution for ways that can 
lead to exercises of arbitrary power. 
The Constitution was designed to put 
limits and checks on all forms of gov-
ernment power. Obviously, one of the 
great mechanisms for that is the sepa-
ration of powers—the structural sepa-
ration of powers in our Constitution. 
But it also comes from defining and 
limiting powers and responsibilities 
and a concern that vague terms, vague 
standards are themselves an oppor-
tunity for the expansion of power and 
the exercise of arbitrary power. We see 
that throughout the Constitution and 
in the impeachment clause as well. 
This is why, as Gouverneur Morris ar-
gued in discussing the impeachment 
clause, that only few offenses—he said 
few offenses—ought to be impeachable, 
and the cases ought to be enumerated 
and defined. 
Many terms had been included in ear-
lier drafts, when it was narrowed down 
to treason and bribery, and there was a 
suggestion to include maladministra-
tion, which had been a ground for im-
peachment in English practice. The 
Framers rejected it because it was too 
vague; it was too expansive. It would 
allow for arbitrary exercises of power. 
We see throughout the Constitution, 
in terms that relate and fit in with the 
impeachment clause, the same con-
cern. One is in the definition of ‘‘trea-
son.’’ The Framers were very con-
cerned that the English practice of 
having a vague concept of treason that 
was malleable and could be changed 
even after the fact to define new con-
cepts of treason was dangerous. It was 
one of the things that they wanted to 
reject from the English system. So

they defined in the Constitution very 
specifically what constituted treason 
and how it had to be proved, and then 
that term was incorporated into the 
impeachment clause. 
Similarly, in the rejection of mal-
administration, which had been an im-
peachable 
offense 
in 
England, 
the 
Framers rejected that because it was 
vague. A vague standard, something 
that is too changeable, that can be re-
defined, that can be malleable after the 
fact, allows for the arbitrary exercise 
of power, and that would be dangerous 
to give that power to the legislature as 
a power to impeach the executive. 
Similarly—and it relates again to the 
impeachment clause—one of the great-
est dangers from having changeable 
standards that existed in the English 
system was bills of attainder. Under a 
bill of attainder, the Parliament could 
pass a specific law saying that a spe-
cific person had done something unlaw-
ful—they were being attainted—even 
though it wasn’t unlawful before that. 
The Framers rejected that entire 
concept. In article I, section 9, they 
eliminated both bills of attainder and 
all ex post facto laws for criminal pen-
alties at the Federal level, and they 
also included a provision to prohibit 
States from using bills of attainder. 
In the English system, there was a 
relationship, to some extent, between 
impeachment and bills of attainder be-
cause both were tools of the Par-
liament to get at officials in the gov-
ernment. You could impeach them for 
an established offense or you could 
pass a bill of attainder. 
It was because the definition of ‘‘im-
peachment’’ was being narrowed that 
George Mason at the debates sug-
gested—he pointed out—that in the 
English system there is a bill of attain-
der. It has been a great, useful tool for 
the government, but we are elimi-
nating that, and now we are getting a 
narrow definition of ‘‘impeachment,’’ 
and we ought to expand it to include 
‘‘maladministration.’’ Madison said no, 
and the Framers agreed: We have to 
have enumerated and defined offenses— 
not a vague concept, not something 
that can be blurry and interpreted 
after the fact and that could be used, 
essentially, to make policy differences 
or other differences like that the sub-
ject of impeachment. 
All of the steps that the Framers 
took in the way they approached the 
impeachment clause were in terms of 
narrowing, restricting, constraining, 
and enumerating offenses and not a 
vague and malleable approach, as they 
had been in the English system. 
I think the minority views of Repub-
lican Members of the House Judiciary 
Committee at the time of the Nixon 
impeachment inquiry summed this up 
and reflected it well because they ex-
plained—and I am quoting from the mi-
nority views in the report: 
The whole tenor of the Framers’ discus-
sions, the whole purpose of their many care-
ful departures from English impeachment 
practice, was in the direction of limits and of 
standards. An impeachment power exercised 
without extrinsic and objective standards 
would be tantamount to the use of bills of 
attainder and ex post facto laws, which are 
expressly forbidden by the Constitution and 
are contrary to the American spirit of jus-
tice. 
What we see in the House managers’ 
charges and their definition of abuse of 
power is exactly antithetical to the 
Framers’ approach because their very 
premise for their abuse of power charge 
is that it is entirely based on subjec-
tive motive—not objective standards, 
not predefined offenses, but the Presi-
dent can do something that is perfectly 
lawful, perfectly within his authority. 
But if the real reason, as Professor 
Dershowitz pointed out—that is the 
language from their report—the reason 
in the President’s mind is something 
that they ferret out and decide is 
wrong, that becomes impeachable, and 
that is not a standard at all. It ends up 
being infinitely malleable. 
It is something that I think—a tell-
ing factor that reflects how malleable 
it is and how dangerous it is in the 
House Judiciary’s report because after 
they define their concept of abuse of 
power and they say that it involves 
your exercising government power for 
personal interest and not the national 
interest and it depends on your subjec-
tive motives, they realize that is infi-
nitely malleable. 
There is not really a clear standard 
there, and it is violating a fundamental 
premise of the American system of jus-
tice that you have to have notice of 
what is wrong. You have to have notice 
of an offense. This is something Pro-
fessor Dershowitz pointed out last 
night. There has to be a defined offense 
in advance. The way they try to re-
solve this is to say: Well, in addition to 
our definition, high crimes and mis-
demeanors involve conduct that is rec-
ognizably wrong to a reasonable per-
son. And that is their kind of add-on to 
deal with the fact that they have an 
unconstitutionally vague standard. 
They don’t have a standard that real-
ly defines a specific offense. They don’t 
have a standard that really defines, in 
coherent terms that are going to be 
identifiable, what the offenses are, so 
they just add on. It has to be recogniz-
ably wrong. 
They say they are doing this to re-
solve a tension, they call it, within the 
Constitution because they point out— 
and this is quoting from the report— 
‘‘The structure of the Constitution, in-
cluding its prohibition on bills of at-
tainder and the ex post facto clause, 
implies that peaceable offenses should 
not come as a surprise.’’ 
That 
is 
exactly 
what 
Professor 
Dershowitz pointed out. And every-
thing about the terms of the Constitu-
tion, speaking of an offense and a con-
viction, that crime should be tried by 
jury except impeachments. They all 
talk 
about 
impeachment 
in 
those 
criminal offense terms. 
But the tension here isn’t within the 
Constitution; it is between the House 
managers’ definition, which lacks any 
coherent definition of an offense that 
would catch people by surprise and the 
Constitution. That is the tension that 
they are trying to resolve between 
their malleable standards that actually 
states no clear offense and the Con-
stitution and the principles of justice 
embodied in the Constitution that re-
quires some clear offense. 
I wanted to point that out in relation 
to the standards for impeachable of-
fenses because it is another piece of the 
constitutional puzzle that fits in with 
the 
exposition 
that 
Professor 
Dershowitz set out. And it also shows 
an inherent flaw in the House man-
agers’ theory of abuse of power, regard-
less of whether or not one accepts the 
view that an impeachable offense has 
to be a defined crime. There is still the 
flaw in their definition of abuse of 
power; that it is so malleable, based on 
purely subjective standards, that it 
does not provide any recognizable no-
tice of an offense. It is so malleable 
that it, in effect, recreates the offense 
of maladministration that the Framers 
expressly 
rejected, 
as 
Professor 
Dershowitz explained. 
The second point that I wanted to 
make is, how do we tell, under the 
House managers’ standard, what the il-
licit motive is; when is there illicit mo-
tive? How are we supposed to get the 
proof of what is inside the President’s 
head because, of course, motive is in-
herently difficult to prove when you 
are talking about, as they conceded 
they are talking about, perfectly law-
ful actions, on their face, within the 
constitutional authority of the Presi-
dent? They want to make it impeach-
able if it is just the wrong idea inside 
the President’s head. And they explain 
in the House Judiciary Committee re-
port that the way we will tell if the 
President had the wrong motive is we 
will compare what he did to what staff-
ers in the executive branch said he 
ought to do. They say that the Presi-
dent ‘‘disregarded United States for-
eign policy towards Ukraine’’ and that 
he ignored ‘‘official’’ policy that he had 
been briefed on and that ‘‘he ignored, 
defied, and confounded every . . . agen-
cy within the Executive Branch.’’ 
That is not a constitutionally coher-
ent statement. The President cannot 
defy agencies within the executive 
branch. Article II, section 1 of the Con-
stitution vests all of the Executive 
power in a President of the United 
States. He alone is an entire branch of 
government. He sets policy for the ex-
ecutive branch. He is given vast power. 
And, of course, within limits set by 
laws passed by Congress and within 
limits set by spending priorities— 
spending laws passed by Congress—he, 
within those constraints, sets the poli-
cies of the government. And in areas of 
foreign affairs, military affairs, na-
tional security—which is what we are 
dealing with in this case—in foreign af-
fairs and head of state communica-
tions, he has vast powers. 
As Professor Dershowitz explained, 
for over two centuries, the President

January 28, 2020 
has been regarded as the sole organ of 
the Nation in foreign affairs. So the 
idea that we are going to find out when 
the President has a wrong subjective 
motive by comparing what he did to 
the recommendations of some inter-
agency consensus among staffers is 
fundamentally anti-constitutional. It 
inverts the constitutional structure, 
and it is also fundamentally anti- 
democratic because our system is rath-
er unique in the amount of power that 
it gives to the President. 
The Executive here has much more 
power than in a parliamentary system, 
but part of the reason that the Presi-
dent can have that power is if he is di-
rectly democratically accountable to 
the people. There is an election every 4 
years to ensure that the President 
stays democratically accountable to 
the people. Those staffers in these sup-
posed interagencies who have their 
meetings and make recommendations 
to the President are not accountable to 
the people. There is no democratic le-
gitimacy or accountability to their de-
cisions or recommendations. And that 
is why the President, as head of the ex-
ecutive branch, has the authority to 
actually set policies and make deter-
minations, regardless of what his staff-
ers may recommend. They are there to 
provide information and recommenda-
tions, not to set policy. 
The idea that we are going to start 
impeaching Presidents by deciding that 
they have illicit motives if we can 
show they disagree with some inter-
agency 
consensus is fundamentally 
contrary to the Constitution and fun-
damentally 
anti-democratic. 
Those 
were the two observations I wanted to 
add to supplement specific points on 
Professor Dershowitz’ comments from 
last night. 
I want to shift gears and respond to a 
couple of points that the House man-
agers have brought up that are really 
completely extraneous to this pro-
ceeding. They involve matters that are 
not charged in the Articles of Impeach-
ment. They do not relate directly to 
the President and his actions, but they 
are accusations that were brought up 
somewhat recklessly, in any event, and 
we can’t close without some response 
to them. The first has to do with the 
idea that somehow the White House 
and White House lawyers were involved 
in some sort of coverup related to the 
transcript of the July 25 call because it 
was stored on a highly classified sys-
tem. 
Let me start with that. The House 
managers made this accusation of 
something nefarious going on. Let’s see 
what the witnesses actually had to say. 
LTC Alexander Vindman—remember 
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman is the 
person who was listening in on the call 
and who raised a concern. He was the 
only person who went and raised a con-
cern with NSC lawyers that he thought 
there was something improper, some-
thing wrong with the call. Even though 
he later conceded under cross-examina-
tion it was really a policy concern, but 
he thought there was something wrong. 
And he had to say: ‘‘I do not think 
there was malicious intent or anything 
of that nature . . . to cover anything 
up.’’ 
He is the one who went and talked to 
the lawyers. He is the one whose com-
plaint spurred the idea that, wait, 
there might be something that is really 
sensitive here. Let’s make sure this is 
not going to leak. He thought there 
was nothing covering it up. 
His boss, Senior Director Tim Morri-
son, had similar testimony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. CASTOR. So to your knowledge, there 
was no malicious intent in moving the tran-
script to the compartmented server? 
Mr. MORRISON. Correct. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. The idea that 
there was some sort of coverup is fur-
ther destroyed by the simple fact that 
everyone who as part of their job need-
ed access to that transcript, still had 
access to it, including Lieutenant Colo-
nel Vindman. The person who raised 
the complaint still had access to the 
transcript the entire time. 
This is the way Mr. Morrison’s testi-
mony explained that. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. CASTOR. And even on the code word 
server, you had access to it? 
Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. Yes. 
Mr. CASTOR. So at no point in time in 
your official duties were you denied access to 
this information, is that correct? 
Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. Correct. 
Mr. CASTOR. And to your knowledge, any-
body on NSC staff that needed access to 
their official duties always was able to ac-
cess it, correct, people that had a need to 
know and a need to access it? 
Mr. MORRISON. Once it was moved to the 
departmental system? Yes. 
Mr. CASTOR. OK. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Now, Mr. Mor-
rison testified that he recommended 
restricting access to the transcript, not 
because he was concerned there was 
anything improper or illegal, but he 
was concerned about a potential leak 
and, as he put it, how that ‘‘would play 
out in Washington’s polarized environ-
ment’’ and would ‘‘affect bipartisan 
support our Ukrainian partners are 
currently experiencing in Congress.’’ 
He was right to be concerned, poten-
tially, about leaks because the Trump 
administration has faced national secu-
rity leaks at an alarming rate. Lieu-
tenant Colonel Vindman, himself, said 
concerns about leaks seemed justified, 
and it was not unusual that something 
would be put in a more restricted cir-
culation. 
Now, what else is in the record evi-
dence? Mr. Morrison explained his un-
derstanding of how the transcript 
ended up on that server. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. MORRISON. I spoke with the NSC ex-
ecutive secretariat staff, asked them why, 
and they did their research and they in-
formed me that it had been moved to the 
higher classification system at the direction 
of John Eisenberg, whom I then asked why. 
I mean, if that was the judgment he made, 
that’s not necessarily mine to question, but 
I didn’t understand it. And he essentially 
told me: I gave no such direction. He did his 
own inquiry, and he represented back to me 
that it was his understanding that it was 
kind of an administrative error, that when 
he also gave direction to restrict access, the 
executive secretariat staff also understood 
that as an apprehension that there was 
something in the content of the Memcon 
that could not exist on the lower classifica-
tion system. 
Mr. CASTOR. To the best of your knowl-
edge, there was no malicious intent in mov-
ing the transcript to the compartmented 
server? 
Mr. MORRISON. Correct. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Everyone who 
knew something about it and who tes-
tified agreed there was no malicious in-
tent. The call was still available to ev-
eryone who needed it as part of their 
job, and it certainly wasn’t covered up 
or deep-sixed in some way. The Presi-
dent declassified it and made it public. 
So why we are even here talking about 
these accusations about a coverup, 
when it is a transcript that was pre-
served and made public, is somewhat 
absurd. 
The other point I would like to turn 
to—another accusation from the House 
managers—is that the whistleblower 
complaint was not forwarded to Con-
gress. They have said that lawyers at 
the Department of Justice, this time, 
they accused OLC, the Office of Legal 
Counsel, of providing a bogus opinion 
for why the Director of National Intel-
ligence did not have to advance the 
whistleblower’s complaint to Congress. 
Manager JEFFRIES
said that OLC 
opined ‘‘without any reasonable basis 
that the Acting DNI did not have to 
turn over the complaint to Congress.’’ 
The way he portrayed this—now, 
there is a statute that says if the in-
spector general of the intelligence 
community finds a matter of urgent 
concern, it must be forwarded to Con-
gress. And Manager JEFFRIES portrayed 
this as if the only thing to decide was 
were these claims urgent. He said: 
‘‘What can be more urgent than a sit-
ting President trying to cheat in an 
American election by soliciting foreign 
interference?’’ 
Except that is not the only question. 
The statute doesn’t just say, if it is ur-
gent, you have to forward it. It talks 
about ‘‘urgent concern’’ as a defined 
term. If the House managers want to 
come and cast accusations that the po-
litical and career officials at the Office 
of Legal Counsel, which we all know is 
a very respected office of the Depart-
ment of Justice, provides opinions for 
the executive branch on what gov-
erning law is, they should come backed 
up with analysis. 
So let’s look at what the law actu-
ally says, and I think we have the slide 
of that. 
‘‘Urgent concern is defined as a seri-
ous or flagrant problem, abuse, viola-
tion of law relating to the funding, ad-
ministration, or operation of an intel-
ligence activity within the responsi-
bility and authority of the Director of 
National Intelligence involving classi-
fied information.’’ 
So the Office of Legal Counsel was 
consulted by the General Counsel at

the DNI’s office, and they looked at 
this definition, and they did an anal-
ysis. They determined that the alleged 
misconduct was not an urgent concern 
within the meaning of the statute be-
cause they were not just talking about 
‘‘Do we think it is urgent?’’ ‘‘Do we 
think it is important?’’ No. They were 
analyzing the law, and they looked at 
the terms of the statute. 
‘‘The alleged misconduct is not an 
urgent concern within the meaning of 
the statute because it does not concern 
the funding, administration, or oper-
ation of an intelligence activity under 
the authority of the DNI.’’ 
Remember, what we are talking 
about here is a head-of-state commu-
nication between the President of the 
United States and another head of 
state. This isn’t some CIA operation 
overseas. This isn’t the NSA’s doing 
something. This isn’t any intelligence 
activity going on within the intel-
ligence community under the super-
vision of the DNI. It is the head of the 
executive branch, in the exercising of 
his constitutional authority, engaging 
in foreign relations with a foreign head 
of state. 
So, in reaching that conclusion, the 
Office of Legal Counsel looked at the 
statute, case law, and the legislative 
history. It concluded that this phrase 
‘‘urgent concern’’ included matters re-
lating to an intelligence activity sub-
ject to the DNI’s supervision, but it did 
not include allegations of wrongdoing 
arising outside of any intelligence ac-
tivity or outside the intelligence com-
munity itself. 
That makes sense. This statute was 
meant to provide for an ability of the 
inspector general’s of the intelligence 
community, in overseeing the activi-
ties of the intelligence community, to 
receive reports about what was going 
on at intelligence agencies, those who 
were members of the intelligence com-
munity, and if there were fraud, waste, 
abuse—something unlawful—in those 
activities. It was not meant to create 
an inspector general of the Presidency, 
an inspector general of the Oval Office, 
to purport to determine whether the 
President, in exercising his constitu-
tional authorities, had done something 
that should be reported. 
This law is narrow, and it does not 
cover every alleged violation of law, 
the OSC explained, or other abuse that 
comes to the attention of a member of 
the intelligence community. Just be-
cause you are in the intelligence com-
munity and happen to see something 
else doesn’t make this law apply. The 
law does not make the inspector gen-
eral for the intelligence community re-
sponsible for investigating and report-
ing on allegations that do not involve 
intelligence activities or the intel-
ligence community. 
Nonetheless, the President, of course, 
released the July 25 call transcript, and 
it was also not the end of the matter 
that the whistleblower complaint and 
the ICIG’s letter were not sent directly 
to Congress. As the OLC explained, if 
the alleged complaint does not involve 
an urgent concern but if there is any-
thing else there that you want to have 
checked out, the appropriate action is 
to refer the matter to the Department 
of Justice, and that is what the DNI’s 
office did. 
They sent the ICIG’s letter, with the 
complaint, to the Department of Jus-
tice, and the Department of Justice 
looked at it. This was all made public 
some time ago. The Department of Jus-
tice examined the exact allegations of 
the whistleblower’s and the exact fram-
ing and concern raised by the inspector 
general, which had to do with the po-
tential of, perhaps, a campaign finance 
law violation. The DOJ looked at it— 
looked at the statutes, analyzed it— 
and determined there was no violation, 
and it closed the matter. It announced 
that months ago. 
When something gets sent over to the 
Department of Justice to examine, you 
can’t call that a coverup. Everything 
here was done correctly. The lawyers 
analyzed the law. The complaint was 
sent to the appropriate person for re-
view. It was not within the statute 
that it required transmission to Con-
gress. Everything was handled entirely 
properly. 
Again, actually extraneous to the 
matters before you, there is nothing 
about these two points in the Articles 
of Impeachment, but it merits a re-
sponse when reckless allegations are 
made against those at the White House 
and at the Department of Justice. 
With that, Mr. Chief Justice, I yield 
my time to Mr. Sekulow. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice, Majority Leader 
MCCONNELL, Democratic Leader SCHU-
MER, House managers, Members of the 
Senate. 
What we are involved in here, as we 
conclude, is perhaps the most solemn 
of duties under our constitutional 
framework—the trial of the leader of 
the free world and the duly elected 
President of the United States. It is 
not a game of leaks and unsourced 
manuscripts. That is politics, unfortu-
nately, and Hamilton put impeachment 
in the hands of this body—the Senate— 
precisely and specifically to be above 
that fray. This is the greatest delibera-
tive body on Earth. 
In our presentation so far, you have 
now heard from legal scholars from a 
variety of schools of thought, from a 
variety of political backgrounds, but 
they do have a common theme with a 
dire warning—danger, danger, danger. 
To lower the bar of impeachment based 
on these Articles of Impeachment 
would impact the functioning of our 
constitutional Republic and the frame-
work of that Constitution for genera-
tions. 
I asked you to put yourselves—in 
quoting Mr. SCHIFF’s statement that 
his father made—in the shoes of some-
one else, and I said I would like you to 
put yourselves in the shoes of the 
President. I think it is important, as 
we conclude today, that we are re-
minded of that fact. 
The President of the United States, 
before he was the President, was under 
an investigation. It was called Cross-
fire Hurricane. It was an investigation, 
led by the FBI, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation. James Comey eventu-
ally told the President a little bit 
about the investigation and referenced 
the Steele dossier. James Comey, the 
then-Director of the FBI, said it was 
salacious and unverified—so salacious 
and unverified that they used it as a 
basis to obtain FISA warrants. Mem-
bers—managers here, managers at this 
table right here—said that any discus-
sions on the abuse from the Foreign In-
telligence Surveillance Act, utilized to 
get the FISA warrants from the court, 
were conspiracy theories. 
At the very beginning, I asked you to 
put yourselves in the shoes of not just 
this President but of any President 
who would have been under this type of 
attack. FISA warrants were issued on 
people affiliated with his campaign— 
American citizens affiliated with the 
people of his campaign, citizens of the 
United States being surveilled pursu-
ant to an order that has now been ac-
knowledged by the very court that 
issued the order that it was based on a 
fraudulent presentation. 
In 
fact, 
evidence 
specifically 
changed—changed by the very FBI law-
yer who was in charge of this, changed 
to such an extent that the Foreign In-
telligence Surveillance Court—as I said 
earlier, and I will not repeat it again— 
issued two orders, saying that when 
this agent—this lawyer—made these 
misrepresentations to the National Se-
curity Division, they also made a mis-
representation to a Federal court—the 
Federal 
court—the 
Foreign 
Intel-
ligence Surveillance Court. This is a 
court where there are no defense wit-
nesses and is a court where there is no 
cross-examination. It is a court based 
on trust. That trust was violated. 
Then the Director of the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation, James Comey, 
decides he will leak a memo of a con-
versation he had with the President of 
the United States. He is leaking the 
memo for a purpose, he said—to obtain 
the appointment of a special counsel. 
Lo and behold, a special counsel is ap-
pointed. It just so happens that that 
FBI 
agent—lawyer—who 
committed 
the fraud on the FISA Court, became a 
lawyer for the Mueller investigation, 
only to be removed because of political 
animus and bias found by the inspector 
general. 
Then we have a special counsel inves-
tigation. Lisa Page, Agent Strzok—I 
am not going to go into the details. 
You know them. They are not in con-
troversy. They are uncontroverted. The 
facts are clear. But does it bother your 
sense of justice even a little bit—even 
a little bit—that Bob Mueller allowed 
the evidence on the phones of those 
agents to be wiped clean while there 
was an investigation going on by the 
inspector general?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S623 
January 28, 2020 
Now, if you did it, or if you did it, 
Manager SCHIFF, or if you did it, Man-
ager JEFFRIES, or if I did that—de-
stroyed evidence—if anyone in this 
Chamber did this, we would be in seri-
ous trouble. Their serious trouble is 
their getting fired. Bob Mueller’s ex-
planation for it is, I don’t know what 
happened. I don’t know what happened. 
I can’t recall conversations. 
You can’t view this case in a vacuum. 
You are being asked—and I say this 
with the utmost respect—to remove a 
duly elected President of the United 
States. We have referenced the law 
school exams, and I love that. I 
thought there was great analysis yes-
terday. I appreciate all of that, but I 
want to focus today on my section, on 
what you are being asked to do. You 
are being asked to remove a duly elect-
ed President of the United States, and 
you are being asked to do it in an elec-
tion year—in an election year. 
There are some of you in this Cham-
ber right now who would rather be 
someplace else, and that is why we will 
be brief. I understand. You would rath-
er be someplace else. Why would you 
rather be someplace else? Because you 
are running for President, for the nom-
ination of your party. I get it, but this 
is a serious, deliberative situation. You 
are being asked to remove a duly elect-
ed President of the United States. That 
is what the Articles of Impeachment 
call for—removal. 
So we had a special counsel, and we 
got the report. Just for a moment, put-
ting yourselves in the shoes of this 
President—or of any President who 
would be under this situation—you are 
No. 4 at the Department of Justice. His 
wife is working for the firm that is 
doing the opposition research on him 
and is communicating with the foreign 
former spy, Christopher Steele, who 
put together the dossier. It is being 
handled by Christopher Steele, through 
Nellie Ohr, to her husband—then, the 
fourth ranking member at the Depart-
ment of Justice, Bruce Ohr. All of this 
is going on, and he doesn’t want to tell 
everybody—and he has testified to 
this—what he is doing because he is 
afraid he might have to stop. 
Might have to stop? 
How did this happen? This is the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation. And then 
we ask why the President is concerned 
about advice he is being given? 
Put yourself in his shoes. Put your-
self in his shoes. 
We have given you—and our approach 
has been to give—an overview, and to 
be very specific, to remove a duly 
elected President, which is what you 
are being asked to do, for essentially 
policy disagreements—you heard a lot 
about policy, although the one that I 
still—it still troubles me, this idea 
that the President—it was said by sev-
eral of the managers—is only doing 
these things for himself. 
Understanding what is going on in 
the world today, as we are here—they 
raised it, by the way. I am not trying 
to be disrespectful. They raised it: This 
President is only doing things for him-
self while the leaders of opposing par-
ties, by the way, at the highest level, 
to obtain peace in the Middle East—to 
say you are only doing that for your-
self? I think the irony is that those 
statements were made while all of that 
was going on and other acts that this 
body has passed, some of them bipar-
tisan, to help the American people. 
Policy differences—those policy dif-
ferences cannot be used to destroy the 
separation of powers. House managers 
spoke for—I know we have had dis-
agreements on the time. It was 21 
hours or 23 hours. They spoke during 
their time—a lot of time—most of it 
attacking the President, policy deci-
sions. They didn’t like what they 
heard. They didn’t like there was a 
pause on foreign aid. 
I have laid out before that there were 
pauses on all kinds of foreign aid. He is 
not the first President to do it. 
But the one thing I am still trying to 
understand from the managers’ per-
spective—and maybe it is not fair to 
ask the managers because you are not 
the leader of the House. But remember 
the whole idea that this was a dire na-
tional security threat, a danger to our 
Nation, and we had to get this over 
here right away. It had to be done be-
fore Christmas. It was so important; it 
was so significant; the country was in 
such jeopardy; the jeopardy was so se-
rious that it had to be done imme-
diately. 
Let’s hold on to the Articles of Im-
peachment for a month to see if the 
House could force the Senate to adopt 
rules that they wanted, which is not 
the way the Constitution is set up. 
But it was such a dire emergency, it 
was so critical for our Nation’s na-
tional interests, that we could hold 
them for 33 days. Danger, danger, dan-
ger. That is politics. 
As I said, you are being called upon 
to remove the duly elected President of 
the United States. That is what these 
Articles of Impeachment call for. 
They never really answered the ques-
tion of why they thought there was 
such a national emergency. Maybe 
they will during questions; I don’t 
know. If there was such a national 
emergency, they never did explain why 
it was that they waited. They certainly 
didn’t wait to have the proceedings, as 
my colleagues have laid out; I mean, 
those proceedings moved in record 
time. I suspect that we have been here 
more than the House actually consid-
ered the actual Articles of Impeach-
ment. 
Is that the way the Constitution is 
supposed to work? Is that the design of 
the Constitution? 
And then their question, of course, 
came up yesterday on the whole situa-
tion with Burisma and the Bidens and 
that whole issue, and my colleague 
went through that a great deal, and I 
am not going to do that. 
But do we have a—we used to call 
this, in free speech cases, like a free 
speech zone. You could have your free 
speech activities over here; you can’t 
have them over there. Do you we have 
like a Biden-free zone? Was that was 
this was? You mention someone or you 
are concerned about a company, and it 
is now off limits? You can impeach the 
President of the United States for ask-
ing a question? I think we significantly 
showed the question. 
I am not going to go through a de-
tail-by-detail analysis of the facts, but 
there are some that we just have to go 
through. 
You heard a lot of new facts yester-
day in our presentation. On Saturday, 
what we were pointing to was a very 
quick overview, and then yesterday we 
spent 
the 
day—and 
we 
appreciate 
everybody’s patience on that—going 
through the facts: They showed you 
this, but they didn’t show you that. 
The facts are important, though, be-
cause facts have legal ramifications; 
legal ramifications impact the deci-
sions you make. So I don’t take facts 
lightly, and I certainly don’t take the 
constitutional mandate lightly, and we 
can’t. 
The facts we demonstrated yesterday 
and briefly on Saturday demonstrate 
that there was, in fact, a proper gov-
ernmental interest in the questions 
that the President asked and the issues 
that the President raised on that phone 
call. 
A phone call—now, let’s—again, put 
your feet in the shoes of the President. 
Put yourself in the President’s posi-
tion. Do you think he thought, when he 
was on the call, it was him and Presi-
dent Zelensky he was talking to, and 
that was it? Or as I heard one commen-
tator say it was—people listening in on 
the call—the President and 3,000 of his 
closest friends. 
Let’s be realistic. The President of 
the United States knew, when he was 
on that call, there were a lot of people 
listening from our side and from their 
side. So he knew what he was saying. 
He said it. We released a transcript of 
it. 
The facts on the call that have been 
kind of the focus of all of this really fo-
cused on foreign policy initiatives both 
in Ukraine and around the globe. They 
talked about other countries. The 
President has been very concerned 
about other countries carrying some of 
the financial load here, not just the 
United States. That is a legitimate po-
sition for a President to take. If you 
disagree with it, you have the right to 
do that, but he is the President. As my 
colleague Deputy White House Counsel 
Philbin just said, that is the executive 
branch prerogative. That is their con-
stitutional, appropriate role. 
So the call is well documented. There 
were lots of people on the call. The per-
son that would be on the other end of 
the quid pro quo, if it existed, would 
have been President Zelensky. But 
President Zelensky—and we already 
laid 
out 
the 
other 
officials 
from 
Ukraine—has repeatedly said there was 
no pressure. It was a good call. They 
didn’t even know there was a pause in

January 28, 2020 
the aid. All of that is well documented. 
I am not going to go through each and 
every one of those facts. We did that 
over the last several days. 
President Zelensky’s senior adviser, 
Andriy Yermak, was asked if he ever 
felt there was a connection between 
military aid and the request for inves-
tigations, and he was adamant that 
‘‘We never had that feeling’’ and ‘‘We 
did not have the feeling that this aid 
was connected to any one specific 
issue.’’ This is coming from the people 
who were receiving the aid. 
So we talk about this whole quid pro 
quo, and that was a big issue. That is 
how this—actually, before it became an 
impeachment proceeding, there was— 
as the proceedings were beginning in 
the House Permanent Select Com-
mittee on Intelligence under Chairman 
SCHIFF’s role, there were all these dis-
cussions: Is it a quid pro quo? Was it 
extortion? Was it bribery? What was it? 
And we are clear in our position that 
there was no quid pro quo. But then 
yesterday, my cocounsel, Professor 
Alan Dershowitz, explained last night 
that these articles must be rejected— 
he was talking about from a constitu-
tional framework—even if it was a quid 
pro quo, which we have clearly estab-
lished there was not. 
And this is what he said, and I am 
going to quote it verbatim: 
The claim that foreign policy decisions can 
be deemed abuses of power based on subjec-
tive opinions about mixed or sole motives 
that the President was interested only in 
helping himself demonstrate the dangers of 
employing the vague, subjective, and politi-
cally malleable phrase ‘‘abuse of power’’ as a 
constitutionally permissible criteria for the 
removal of a President. 
He went on to say: 
Now, it follows from this that if a Presi-
dent—any President—were to have done 
what ‘‘The Times’’ reported about the con-
tent of John Bolton’s manuscript, that would 
not constitute an impeachable offense. 
I am quoting exactly from Professor 
Dershowitz. He said: 
Let me repeat it. Nothing in the Bolton 
revelations, even if true— 
Even if true. 
would rise to the level of abuse of power or 
an impeachable offense. That is clear from 
history. That is clear from the language of 
the Constitution. You cannot turn conduct 
that is not impeachable into impeachable 
conduct simply by using words like ‘‘quid 
pro quo’’ and ‘‘personal benefit.’’ 
It is inconceivable that the Framers would 
have intended so politically loaded and pro-
miscuously deployed a term as ‘‘abuse of 
power’’ to be weaponized— 
Again, Professor Dershowitz. 
as a tool of impeachment. It is precisely the 
kind of vague, open-ended, and subjective 
term Framers feared and rejected. 
Now, to be specific: You cannot im-
peach a President on an unsourced alle-
gation. But what Professor Dershowitz 
was saying is that even if everything in 
there 
is 
true, 
it 
constitutionally 
doesn’t rise to that level. 
But I want to be clear on this be-
cause there is a lot of speculation out 
there with regard to what John Bolton 
has said, which referenced a number of 
individuals. We will start with the 
President. Here is what the President 
said in response to that New York 
Times piece: 
I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to 
Ukraine was tied to investigations into 
Democrats, including the Bidens. In fact, he 
never complained about this at the time of 
his very public termination. If John Bolton 
said this, it was only to sell a book. 
The Department of Justice. 
While the Department of Justice has not 
reviewed Mr. Bolton’s manuscript, the New 
York Times’ account of his conversation 
grossly mischaracterizes what Attorney Gen-
eral Barr and Bolton discussed. 
There was no discussion of ‘‘personal fa-
vors’’ or ‘‘undue influence’’ on investiga-
tions, nor did Attorney General Barr state 
that the President’s conversations with for-
eign leaders were improper. 
The Vice President’s chief of staff 
issued a statement: 
In every conversation with the President 
and the Vice President, in preparation for 
our trip to Poland— 
Remember, that was the trip that 
was being planned for the meeting with 
President Zelensky. 
the President consistently expressed his 
frustration that the United States was bear-
ing the lion’s share of responsibility for aid 
to Ukraine and that European nations 
weren’t doing their part. 
The President also expressed concerns 
about corruption in Ukraine, and at no time 
did I hear him tie Ukraine aid to investiga-
tions into the Biden family or Burisma. 
That was the response responding to 
an unpublished manuscript that maybe 
some reporters have an idea of maybe 
what it says. I mean, that is what the 
evidence—if you want to call that evi-
dence. I don’t know what you call that. 
I would call it inadmissible, but that is 
what it is. 
To argue that the President is not 
acting in our national interest and is 
violating his oath of office, which the 
managers have put forward, is wrong 
based on the facts and the way the 
Constitution is designed. 
When you look at the fullness of the 
record of their witnesses—their wit-
nesses—the witnesses’ statements, the 
transcripts—there is one thing that 
emerged: There is no violation of law. 
There is no violation of the Constitu-
tion. There is a disagreement on policy 
decisions. 
Most of those who spoke at your 
hearings did not like the President’s 
policy. That is why we have elections. 
That is where policy differentials and 
differences are discussed. But to have a 
removal of a duly elected President 
based on policy differences is not what 
the Framers intended. 
If you lower the bar that way, dan-
ger, danger, danger, because the next 
President or the one after that—he or 
she would be held to that same stand-
ard. I hope not. I pray that is not what 
happens, not just for the sake of my 
client but for the Constitution. Pro-
fessor Dershowitz gave a list of Presi-
dents, from Washington to where we 
are today, who, under the standard 
that they are proposing, could be sub-
ject to abuse of power or obstruction of 
Congress. 
We know that this is not about a 
President pausing aid to Ukraine. It is 
really not about the law. It is about a 
lot of attempts on policy disagree-
ments that are not being debated here. 
My goodness, how much time—how 
much time has been spent in the House 
of Representatives hoping? They were 
hoping that the Mueller probe would 
result in—I mean, I am not going to 
play all the—I was thinking about it, 
playing all the clips from all the com-
mentators the day after Bob Mueller 
testified. Bob Mueller was unable to 
answer, under his examination, basic 
and fundamental questions. He had to 
correct himself, actually. He had to 
correct himself before the Senate for 
something that he said before the 
House. So that is what the President 
has been living with. 
And we are today arguing about 
what? A phone call to Ukraine or 
Ukraine aid being held or a question 
about corruption or a question about 
corruption that happened to involve a 
high-profile public figure? Is that what 
this is? Is that where we are? 
Then what do we find out? The aid 
was released. It was released in an or-
derly fashion. The reform President, 
President Zelensky, wins, but there 
was a question on whether his party 
would take the Parliament. It did. 
They worked late into the evening with 
the desire to put forward reforms. So 
everybody was waiting, including—and 
you heard the testimony from, I will 
say, their witnesses—you heard the 
testimony—everybody was concerned 
about Ukraine. Everybody was con-
cerned about whether these reforms 
could actually take place. Everybody 
was concerned about it. So you hold 
back. 
It didn’t affect anything that was 
going on in the field. We heard Mr. 
CROW worrying about the soldiers. I un-
derstand that, I appreciate that, but 
none of that aid was affecting what was 
going on in the battlefield right then 
or for the next 4 months because it was 
future aid. Are we having an impeach-
ment proceeding because aid came out 
3 weeks before the end of the fiscal 
year, for a 6-minute phone call? You 
boil it down, that is what this is. 
It is interesting to me that every-
body said: Well, the aid was finally re-
leased September 11 only because of 
the committee and the whistleblower 
we have never seen. Mr. Philbin dealt 
with that in great detail. I am not 
going to go over that again. But, you 
know, the new high court, the anti-cor-
ruption court, wasn’t established and 
did not sit until September 5, 2019. So 
while the President of Ukraine was try-
ing to get reforms put in place, the 
court that was going to decide corrup-
tion issues was not set until September 
5. 
I want you to think about this for a 
moment too. They needed a high court 
of corruption for corruption. Think

about that for a moment. Now, it is 
good that they recognized it, but re-
member when I said the other day that 
you don’t wave a magic wand and now 
Ukraine doesn’t have a corruption 
problem? The high court of corruption, 
which they have to have because it is 
not just past corruption—they are con-
cerned 
about 
ongoing 
corruption 
issues. 
You could put all of your witnesses 
back under oath in the next hearings 
you will have when this is all over, and 
you are going to be back in the House 
and you are going to be doing this 
again, putting them all back under 
oath, and ask them, Mr. SCHIFF, is 
there a problem with corruption in 
Ukraine? If they get up there and say: 
No. Everything is great now, halle-
lujah—but I suspect they are going to 
say: We are working really hard on it. 
But this idea that it has just vanished 
and now we are back into ‘‘everything 
is fine’’ is absurd. 
Mr. Morrison testified that while the 
developments were taking place, the 
Vice President also met with President 
Zelensky in Warsaw. That was the 
meeting of September 1—the one, by 
the way, where the Vice President’s Of-
fice said in response to this New York 
Times article that nobody told him 
about aid being held or linked to inves-
tigations. 
Are you going to stop—are you going 
to allow proceedings on impeachment 
to go from a New York Times report 
about someone that says what they 
hear is in a manuscript? Is that where 
we are? I don’t think so. I hope not. 
What did Morrison say? You heard 
firsthand that the new Ukraine admin-
istration was taking concrete steps to 
address corruption. That is good. He 
advised the President that the rela-
tionship with Zelensky is one that 
could be trusted. Good. 
President Zelensky also agreed with 
Vice President PENCE—this is inter-
esting—that the Europeans should be 
doing more and related to Vice Presi-
dent PENCE conversations he had been 
having with European leaders about 
getting them to do more. 
In sum, the President raised two 
issues he was concerned with to get 
them addressed. 
Now I have already gone over—again, 
this is just the closing moments here of 
our portion of this proceeding. Aid was 
withheld or paused, put on a pause but-
ton not just for Ukraine but for Af-
ghanistan, South Korea, El Salvador, 
Guatemala, Lebanon, and Pakistan. I 
am sure I am leaving countries out. 
But do you think the American people 
are concerned if the President says: 
You know, before we give a country, I 
don’t know, $550 million—some coun-
tries, only $400 million—we would like 
to know what they are doing with it. 
You are supposed to be the guardians 
of the trust here. It is the taxpayers’ 
money we are spending. 
There was a lot of testimony from 
Dr. Fiona Hill, John Bolton’s deputy. 
Here is what she said about aid that 
was being held. This was her testi-
mony: There was a freeze put on all 
kinds of aid and assistance because it 
was in the process at the time of an 
awful lot of reviews of foreign assist-
ance. 
Oh, you mean there was a policy 
within the administration to review 
foreign assistance and how we are 
doing it because we spend a lot of 
money? 
By the way, I am not complaining 
about the money. I don’t think any-
body doesn’t want to help. But we do 
need to know what is going on, and 
those are valid and important ques-
tions. 
Manager CROW
told you that the 
President’s Ukraine policy was not 
strong against Russia, but Ambassador 
Yovanovitch stated the exact opposite. 
She said in her deposition that our 
country’s Ukraine policy under Presi-
dent Trump actually—her words—‘‘got 
stronger’’ than it was under President 
Obama. 
So, again, policy disagreements. Dis-
agreements on approach. Have elec-
tions. That is what we do in our Repub-
lic. 
For 3 long days, House managers pre-
sented their case by selectively show-
ing parts of testimony. Good lawyers 
show parts of testimony. You don’t 
have to show the whole thing. But 
other good lawyers show the rest of the 
testimony. And that is what we sought 
to do to give you a fuller view of what 
we saw as the glaring omissions by my 
colleagues, the House managers. 
The legal issues here are the con-
stitutional ones, and I have been I 
think pretty clear over the last week, 
starting when we had the motions ar-
guments, in my concern about the con-
stitutional obligations that we are op-
erating under. I have been critical of 
Manager NADLER’s ‘‘executive privilege 
and other nonsense.’’ 
I want you to look at it this way. 
Take out executive privilege; First 
Amendment free speech and other non-
sense; the free exercise of religion and 
other nonsense; the right to due proc-
ess and other nonsense; the right of 
equal protection under the law and 
other nonsense. You can’t start doing 
that. You would not do that. No admin-
istration has done that, in fact, since 
the first administration, George Wash-
ington. They wanted information. He 
thought it was privileged. He said it 
was executive privilege. 
Let’s not start calling constitutional 
rights ‘‘other nonsense’’ and lumping 
them together. This is from the House 
of Representatives that actually be-
lieves 
the 
attorney/client 
privilege 
doesn’t apply, which should scare every 
lawyer in Washington, DC, but more 
scary for their clients. They say that 
in writing, in letters. They don’t hide 
it. 
I would ask them—I am not going to; 
it is not my privilege to do that—do 
you really believe that? Do you really 
believe that the attorney/client privi-
lege does not apply in a congressional 
hearing? Do you really believe that? 
Because if that is what is believed or 
implied, then there is no attorney/cli-
ent privilege—or is that the attorney/ 
client privilege and other nonsense? 
Danger, danger, danger. 
We believe that article I fails con-
stitutionally. The President has con-
stitutional authority to engage in and 
conduct foreign policy and foreign af-
fairs. It is our position legally—the 
President at all times acted with per-
fect legal authority, inquired of mat-
ters in our national interest, and, hav-
ing received assurances of those mat-
ters, continued his policy that his ad-
ministration put forward of what real-
ly 
is 
unprecedented 
support 
for 
Ukraine, including the delivery of a 
military aid package that was denied 
to the Ukrainians by the prior adminis-
tration. 
Some of the managers right here, my 
colleagues at the other table, voted in 
favor of those—wanted Javelin anti- 
tank missiles for Ukraine. Some of the 
Members here did not, didn’t want to 
do that, voted against that. I am glad 
we gave it to them. I am glad we al-
lowed them to purchase Javelins. 
I never served in the military. I have 
tremendous, tremendous respect for 
the men and women who protect our 
freedom. I have tremendous respect for 
what they are doing and continue to 
do. 
This President actually allowed the 
Javelins to go. Some of you liked that 
idea; some of you did not. Policy dif-
ference. Were you going to impeach 
President Obama because he did not 
give them lethal aid? No. Nor should 
you. You should not do that. It is a pol-
icy difference. Policy differences do not 
rise to the level of constitutionally 
mandated or constitutional applica-
tions for removal from office. It is pol-
icy differences. 
By the way, it is not just on lethal 
weapons; President Obama, as I said, 
withheld aid. He had the right to do 
that. You have allowed him to do that. 
Oh, but we don’t like that this Presi-
dent did it, so the rules change. So this 
President’s rules are different than—he 
has a different set of standards he has 
to apply than what you allowed the 
previous administrations to apply. And 
you know what—or the future adminis-
trations to apply. That is the problem 
with these articles. 
We have laid out, I believe, a compel-
ling case on what the Constitution re-
quires. When they were in the House of 
Representatives putting this together, 
did they go through a constitutionally 
mandated accommodation process to 
see if there was a way to come up with 
something? No, they did not. Did they 
run to court? No. And the one time it 
was about to happen, they ran the 
other way. 
Separation of powers means some-
thing. It is not separation of powers 
and other nonsense. If we have reached 
now, at this very moment in the his-
tory of our Republic, a bar of impeach-
ment because you don’t like the Presi-
dent’s policies or you don’t like the

way he undertook those policies—be-
cause we heard a lot about policy. If 
partisan impeachment is now the rule 
of the day, which these Members and 
Members of this Senate said should 
never be the rule of the day—my good-
ness, they said it—some of them—5 
months ago, but then we had the na-
tional emergency, a phone call. It is an 
emergency, except we will just wait. 
But if partisan impeachment based 
on policy disagreements, which is what 
this is, and personal presumptions or 
newspaper reports and allegations in 
an unsourced—maybe this is in some-
body’s book who is no longer at the 
White House—if that becomes the new 
norm, future Presidents, Democrats 
and Republicans, will be paralyzed the 
moment they are elected, before they 
can even take the oath of office. The 
bar for impeachment cannot be set this 
low. 
Majority Leader MCCONNELL, Demo-
cratic Leader SCHUMER, House man-
agers, Members of the Senate—danger, 
danger, danger. These articles must be 
rejected. The Constitution requires it. 
Justice demands it. 
We would ask the majority leader for 
a short recess, if we can, about 15 min-
utes. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
RECESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
we will be in recess for 15 minutes. 
There being no objection, at 2:18 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 2:44 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate 
will come to order. Please be seated. 
Mr. Cipollone. 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. I thank 
Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the 
Senate. 
Well, I had kind of a lengthy presen-
tation prepared, but I think you have 
heard a lot from our side, and I think 
we have made our case. 
I just want to leave you with a cou-
ple of points. First of all, I thank the 
majority leader and thank Democratic 
Leader SCHUMER and all of you for the 
privilege of speaking on the floor of the 
Senate and for your time and atten-
tion. We really appreciate it. 
We made three basic points. One, all 
you need in this case is the Constitu-
tion and your common sense. If you 
just look at the Articles of Impeach-
ment, the Articles of Impeachment fall 
far short of any constitutional stand-
ard, and they are dangerous. If you 
look to the words from the past that I 
think are instructive, as I said last 
night, they are instructive because 
they were right then and they are right 
now, and I will leave you with some of 
those words. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. NADLER. There must never be a nar-
rowly voted impeachment or an impeach-
ment supported by one of our major political 
parties and opposed by the other. Such an 
impeachment will lack legitimacy, will 
produce divisiveness and bitterness in our 
politics for years to come, and will call into 
question the very legitimacy of our political 
institutions. 
Ms. LOFGREN. This is unfair to the Amer-
ican people. By these actions you would undo 
the free election that expressed the will of 
the American people in 1996. In so doing, you 
will damage the faith the American people 
have in this institution and in the American 
democracy. You will set the dangerous prece-
dent that the certainty of Presidential 
terms, which has so benefited our wonderful 
America, will be replaced by the partisan use 
of impeachment. Future Presidents will face 
election, then litigation, then impeachment. 
The power of the President will diminish in 
the face of the Congress, a phenomena much 
feared by the Founding Fathers. 
Mr. MARKEY. This is a constitutional 
amendment that we are debating, not an im-
peachment resolution. The Republicans are 
crossing out the impeachment standard of 
high crimes and misdemeanors, and they are 
inserting the words ‘‘any crime or mis-
demeanor.’’ We are permitting a constitu-
tional coup d’etat which will haunt this body 
and our country forever. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I warn my colleagues 
that you will reap the bitter harvest of the 
unfair partisan seeds you sow today. The 
constitutional provision for impeachment is 
a way to protect our government and our 
citizens, not another weapon in the political 
arsenal. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I suspect history will show 
that we have lowered the bar on impeach-
ment so much we have broken the seal on 
this extreme penalty so cavalierly that it 
will be used as a routine tool to fight polit-
ical battles. My fear is that when a Repub-
lican wins the White House Democrats will 
demand payback. 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. You were 
right, but I am sorry to say you were 
also prophetic, and I think I couldn’t 
say it better myself, so I will not. You 
know what the right answer is in your 
heart. You know what the right answer 
is for our country. You know what the 
right answer is for the American peo-
ple. 
What they are asking you to do is to 
throw out a successful President on the 
eve of an election with no basis and in 
violation of the Constitution. It would 
dangerously change our country and 
weaken—weaken—forever all of our 
democratic institutions. You all know 
that is not in the interest of the Amer-
ican people. Why not trust the Amer-
ican people with this decision? Why 
tear up their ballots? Why tear up 
every ballot across this country? You 
can’t do that. You know you can’t do 
that. 
So I ask you to defend our Constitu-
tion, to defend fundamental fairness, to 
defend basic due process rights, but 
most importantly—most importantly— 
to respect and defend the sacred right 
of every American to vote and to 
choose their President. The election is 
only months away. The American peo-
ple are entitled to choose their Presi-
dent. 
Overturning the last election and 
massively interfering with the upcom-
ing one would cause serious and lasting 
damage to the people of the United 
States and to our great country. The 
Senate cannot allow this to happen. It 
is time for this to end, here and now. 
So we urge the Senate to reject these 
Articles of Impeachment for all of the 
reasons we have given you. You know 
them all. I don’t need to repeat them. 
They have repeatedly said, over and 
over again, a quote from Benjamin 
Franklin: ‘‘It is a republic, if you can 
keep it.’’ And every time I heard it, I 
said to myself: It is a republic, if they 
let us keep it. 
I have every confidence—every con-
fidence—in your wisdom. You will do 
the only thing you can do, what you 
must do, what the Constitution com-
pels you to do: Reject these Articles of 
Impeachment for our country and for 
the American people. 
It will show that you put the Con-
stitution above partisanship. It will 
show that we can come together on 
both sides of the aisle and end the era 
of impeachment for good. You know it 
should end. You know it should end. It 
will allow you all to spend all of your 
energy and all of your enormous talent 
and all of your resources on doing what 
the American people sent you here to 
do: to work together, to work with the 
President, to solve their problems. 
So this should end now, as quickly as 
possible. Thank you again for your at-
tention. I look forward to answering 
your questions. 
With that, that ends our presen-
tation. Thank you very much. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I have reached an agreement with the 
Democratic leader on how to proceed 
during the question period. Therefore, I 
ask unanimous consent that the ques-
tion period for Senators start when the 
Senate reconvenes on Wednesday; fur-
ther, that the questions alternate be-
tween the majority and minority sides 
for up to 8 hours during that session of 
the Senate; and finally, that on Thurs-
day, the Senate resume time for Sen-
ators’ questions, alternating between 
sides for up to 8 hours during that ses-
sion of the Senate. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Is there objec-
tion? Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
we will complete the question period 
over the next 2 days. I remind Senators 
that their questions must be in writing 
and will be submitted to the Chief Jus-
tice. During the question period of the 
Clinton trial, Senators were thoughtful 
and brief with their questions, and the 
managers and counsel were succinct in 
their answers. I hope we can follow 
both of these examples during this 
time. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. During the im-
peachment trial of President Clinton, 
Chief Justice Rehnquist advised ‘‘coun-
sel on both sides that the Chair will op-
erate on a rebuttable presumption that 
each question can be fully and fairly 
answered in 5 minutes or less.’’ The 
transcript indicates that the statement 
was met with ‘‘laughter.’’

Nonetheless, managers and counsel

limit was a good one and would ask 
both sides to abide by it.

MORNING BUSINESS 
NATIONAL SLAVERY AND HUMAN 
TRAFFICKING 
PREVENTION 
MONTH 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, I join my colleagues on an im-
portant resolution condemning human 
trafficking both at home and around 
the world. 
Congress made human trafficking a 
federal crime 20 years ago with passage 
of the Trafficking Victims Protection 
Act. Since then, I have worked with 
my colleagues on several pieces of leg-
islation to strengthen existing protec-
tions and continue putting victims 
first. 
President Trump has also made ad-
dressing human trafficking one of his 
top priorities. He signed my bill, the 
Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 
2017 into law, as well as other measures 
that I cosponsored, such as the Stop 
Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, the 
Abolish Human Trafficking Act and 
the Frederick Douglass Trafficking 
Victims Prevention and Reauthoriza-
tion Act. He also proclaimed January 
as National Slavery and Human Traf-
ficking Prevention Month. 
f 
IOWA CAUCUSES 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this 
coming Monday, the first in the Nation 
Iowa caucuses kick off the Presidential 
nomination process. The Presidential 
preference part of the caucus is just 
one part, however. In truth, the Iowa 
caucuses are an example of grassroots 
democracy. Iowa voters for each polit-
ical party gather in each of the 1681 
precincts across my State. At these 
neighborhood meetings, voters discuss 
issues of local and national importance 
and elect party officers and convention 
delegates. The platform planks ap-
proved and the officers and delegates 
elected often have a longer lasting im-
pact on the political parties than the 
Presidential preference votes. 
Mr. President, in a week, all political 
focus will be set on my home State of 
Iowa for the first in the Nation pre-
cinct caucuses. Many pundits ask why 
Iowa should be awarded this much im-
pact in the Presidential nomination 
process? Iowans take this job seriously. 
They 
study 
the 
candidates’ 
back-
grounds and positions on issues and 
they thoughtfully listen to the debates. 
In Iowa, Presidential candidates must 
explain and discuss their positions and 
answer tough questions directly to citi-
zens instead of relying on advertising. 
Candidates who have done this success-
fully will be rewarded with momentum 
and excitement that could launch the 
rest of their candidacy. 
SUPPORT FOR AMERICAN VICTIMS 
OF TERRORISM 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this past 
December, H.R. 1865, the Further Con-
solidated Appropriations Act, 2020, was 
enacted into law as Public Law 116–94. 
I want to take a moment to offer some 
clarity regarding section 903 of division 
J of the Act, which is a modified 
version of the Promoting Security and 
Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 
2019. 
I 
commend 
the 
Republican 
and 
Democratic Senators who have dedi-
cated their time to pursuing justice for 
American victims of terrorism. We all 
want these victims to have their day in 
court and to be appropriately com-
pensated. It is also important that we 
do so in a manner that does not do 
more harm than good. That is the bal-
ance that was sought in section 903 on 
a bipartisan basis. 
One component of section 903 is a 
provision that enables the Palestinian 
Authority and the Palestinian Libera-
tion Organization, PA and PLO, to con-
duct certain activities in the United 
States ‘‘exclusively for the purpose of 
conducting official business’’ and ac-
tivities ‘‘ancillary’’ to those listed in 
the provision without consenting to 
personal jurisdiction in civil cases. The 
provision was included because Sen-
ators of both parties understand that it 
is in our national interest to permit 
certain activities related to the official 
representation of the PA and PLO. 
Having been part of the negotiation 
that resulted in this language, I believe 
it is important that we have a clear un-
derstanding of the types of activities 
that are considered ‘‘ancillary’’ to the 
conduct of official business. 
While the official business of any for-
eign mission necessarily includes meet-
ings with Members of Congress and 
their staff, representatives of the exec-
utive branch, and other public officials, 
ancillary activities are those which 
may not be essential for the minimal 
functioning of the mission but which 
support the mission’s primary oper-
ations. By way of example, I am con-
fident that every Member of this body 
would, as I do, consider a public state-
ment, the issuance of a press release, 
or a meeting or public appearance— 
while not essential—to be ancillary to 
his or her primary functions as a U.S. 
Senator and would reject any attempt 
to define such activities otherwise. 
That is also why, with regard to the 
PA and PLO, while we may or may not 
agree with the statements of its rep-
resentatives, 
the 
law 
contemplates 
that its representatives may meet with 
advocates regarding relevant issues, 
make public statements, and otherwise 
engage in public advocacy and civil so-
ciety activities that are ancillary to 
the conduct of official business without 
consenting to personal jurisdiction. 
Such jurisdiction is provided for else-
where in section 903. 
The message in this bill is clear: Con-
gress is committed to pursuing justice 
for American victims of terrorism 
while ensuring appropriate standards 
regarding the ability of foreign mis-
sions to conduct official business in the 
United States. This is a solution that 
protects U.S. national interests, and I 
thank the Senators on both sides of the 
aisle who have worked together to find 
a way forward on this measure. 
f 
THE PHILIPPINES 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President I want to 
take a few moments to discuss an issue 
that has garnered some attention in re-
cent months, which is our relations 
with the Government of the Phil-
ippines, including President Duterte’s 
counter-drug strategy and his govern-
ment’s treatment of those who have 
openly criticized that strategy. 
It is important to first recount the 
long history of friendship and strategic 
cooperation between the United States 
and the Philippines. Family and cul-
tural ties that extend back many gen-
erations bind us together, as do our 
shared goals in East Asia and the Pa-
cific. Our Armed Forces regularly en-
gage in joint exercises to enhance re-
gional 
security. 
Despite 
our 
dif-
ferences, relations between our two 
countries are strong and based on mu-
tual respect. 
We should also extend our deepest 
sympathies to those harmed by the re-
cent eruption of the Taal volcano in 
Luzon. It has displaced tens of thou-
sands of families and destroyed the 
livelihoods of many. The U.S. Agency 
for 
International 
Development 
and 
international organizations that re-
ceive U.S. funding like the World Food 
Programme are responding with hu-
manitarian aid to those in need, which 
I and others in Congress strongly sup-
port. 
One of the manifestations of our 
longstanding, close relations with the 
Philippines is the assistance we provide 
annually to promote a wide range of in-
terests there, from humanitarian and 
economic assistance to military assist-
ance, which in fiscal year 2019 totaled 
more than $150 million. However, as is 
the case for other recipients of U.S. as-
sistance, those funds are not an enti-
tlement and they are not a blank 
check. For example, in the Philippines 
they may not be used to support police 
counter-drug operations. We condemn 
the thousands of extrajudicial execu-
tions of suspected drug users and drug- 
traffickers by police and their collabo-
rators. Such a strategy is not con-
sistent with due process and the rule of 
law, nor an effective way to combat the 
trafficking and abuse of illegal drugs 
that 
every 
country, 
including 
the 
United States, is struggling with. We 
do support treatment programs for 
Filipinos suffering from drug addic-
tion. 
We also stand strongly in support of 
freedom of expression, whether in the 
Philippines or anywhere else, including 
in our own country, and that, as well 
as President Duterte’s counter-drug 
strategy, is what underlies our current

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S628 
January 28, 2020 
disagreement with his government that 
is illustrated, most recently, by the 
passage without opposition of S. Res. 
142, which condemns the imprisonment 
of Senator Leila De Lima and calls for 
her immediate release. It also calls on 
the Government of the Philippines to 
guarantee freedom of the press and to 
drop charges against Maria Ressa and 
the online news network Rappler. 
As said by Senator DURBIN who, like 
I, cosponsored that resolution, ‘‘[i]n 
the end, [De Lima’s] freedom and the 
end of government harassment against 
journalists like Maria Ressa will be im-
portant tests of whether cherished 
democratic norms we share with our 
long-standing Filipino allies will be re-
spected by President Duterte.’’ 
The response of the Duterte govern-
ment 
was 
regrettable, 
albeit 
not 
uncharacteristic. Like Senator DURBIN, 
I have become accustomed to being on 
the receiving end of baseless personal 
attacks by President Duterte’s spokes-
man, as if those attacks might intimi-
date us or boost domestic support for 
his government. Rather than respond 
substantively to legitimate concerns 
about extrajudicial killings, impunity, 
and freedom of expression that I, Sen-
ator DURBIN, Senator MARKEY, our 
Democratic and Republican colleagues, 
the U.S. State Department, the United 
Nations, and respected human rights 
organizations have raised over the 
years, we are told that S. Res. 142 is 
based on ‘‘bogus narratives . . . pro-
moted by Duterte’s usual antagonists.’’ 
We are accused of being ‘‘prejudiced’’ 
and ‘‘misguided,’’ our support for Sen-
ator De Lima ‘‘a direct and shameless 
affront to the Republic of the Phil-
ippines, which has long ceased to be a 
colony of the United States.’’ Our ac-
tions are called ‘‘brazen and intrusive 
to the dignity of an independent, demo-
cratic and sovereign state’’ which 
would ‘‘not be bullied by any foreign 
country or by its officials, especially 
by misinformed and gullible politicians 
who grandstand at our expense.’’ Going 
a step further, the Duterte government 
inexplicably threatened to deny visas 
to Americans who seek to visit the 
Philippines and who have nothing to do 
with these concerns. 
Such vitriolic hyperbole is barely de-
serving of a response, but suffice it to 
say that none of us remotely regards 
the Philippines as a colony of the 
United States, nor are our concerns 
about the treatment of Senator De 
Lima and Maria Ressa an intrusion of 
the Philippines’ sovereignty, which we 
respect. S. Res. 142 is based on con-
sistent reporting by the Trump admin-
istration’s 
State 
Department, 
the 
United Nations, and other credible ob-
servers, including in the Philippines, 
who share the conviction that defend-
ing freedom of expression has nothing 
to do with sovereignty. To the con-
trary, it is everyone’s responsibility, 
wherever it is denied. If there is any 
‘‘intrusion of dignity’’ or ‘‘shameless 
affront’’ in this instance, it is the har-
assment, threats, false charges, and 
imprisonment of those who have dared 
to criticize the Duterte government’s 
lawless counter-drug strategy. 
None of us here, nor in the Phil-
ippines, has an interest in prolonging 
this dispute. To the contrary, we want 
to enhance our cooperation in a mul-
titude of areas of common interest— 
from maritime security to human traf-
ficking to climate change. What 100 
U.S. Senators—Republicans and Demo-
crats—have urged is succinctly spelled 
out in the resolution. Rather than deny 
visas to Americans, many of whom 
have family in the Philippines, and 
rather than resort to ad hominem at-
tacks, there is, as Senator DURBIN has 
said, ‘‘an easy and honorable way for-
ward.’’ As I have said for months, we 
are not aware of any credible evidence 
that Senator De Lima, who has been 
detained for nearly 3 years, is guilty of 
the crimes she has been accused of. If 
such evidence exists, it should be 
promptly produced in a public trial, 
and she should be provided the oppor-
tunity to refute it. Otherwise she 
should be released. As a former pros-
ecutor, I know that is the minimum to 
which anyone accused of a crime is en-
titled. 
And respected, courageous investiga-
tive 
journalists 
like 
Maria 
Ressa

destroy the underpinnings of democ-
racy than by using threats and unlaw-
ful arrest to silence the press.

IMPRISONMENT OF LOUJAIN AL- 
HATHLOUL 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have 
spoken repeatedly about the unlawful 
imprisonment and abuse of human 
rights activists by the Saudi Govern-
ment, which continue despite promises 
of reform by Crown Prince Mohammed 
bin Salman. In fact, the murder of 
Jamal Khashoggi, the botched coverup 
and sham investigation, and the ongo-
ing, systematic repression of Saudi ac-
tivists have only served to confirm 
what we already knew, which is that 
the Crown Prince is no reformer but, 
instead, a ruthless autocrat intimi-
dated by non-violent dissent from his 
own people. 
One such activist being unlawfully 
detained by the Saudi royal family— 
which for all intents and purposes is 
the 
government—is 
Loujain 
al- 
Hathloul, a prominent and outspoken 
women’s rights defender known for her 
activism against the women’s driving 
ban and the male guardianship system. 
In 2014, Ms. al-Hathloul, who had a 
driver’s license from the United Arab 
Emirates, UAE, was detained for 73 
days after attempting to drive into 
Saudi Arabia from the UAE. 
She was arrested again in May 2018 
along 
with 
several 
other 
women’s 
rights activists, weeks before the Saudi 
Government lifted the ban on female 
drivers. She was detained and forcibly 
deported via private Saudi jet from the 
UAE and remains in a Saudi prison 
today. According to Ms. al-Hathloul’s 
family and several human rights orga-
nizations, she has been tortured, sexu-
ally harassed, and threatened with rape 
and murder by Saudi officials. 
For the first 10 months of her deten-
tion, Ms. al-Hathloul was held without 
charges or trial and for the first 3 
months, without access to her family 
or lawyer. In her first trial session on 
March 13, 2019, she was charged with 
promoting women’s rights; calling for 
an end to the male guardianship sys-
tem; and contacting international or-
ganizations, foreign media, and other 
activists. It is hard to believe that in 
the year 2020, advocacy that has been 
protected under international law for 
nearly half a century is grounds for im-
prisonment and prosecution in Saudi 
Arabia, a country whose leaders enjoy 
the best of what oil revenues can buy 
while subjecting their critics to treat-
ment reminiscent of the 1800s. 
Imprisoned, tortured, and charged 
with 
multiple 
‘‘crimes,’’ 
Ms. 
al- 
Hathloul’s last court appearance was 
on April 3, 2019, more than 250 days 
ago. She remains in prison without any 
information regarding when her next 
court session will take place. The right 
of due process simply does not exist in 
Saudi Arabia. 
This is typical of how Saudi Arabia 
treats those who dare to exercise their 
rights to free expression, association, 
and assembly. We should all be out-
raged, and in fact Republicans and 
Democrats in Congress as well as doz-
ens of foreign governments have called 
for Ms. al-Hathloul’s release and the 
release of others facing politically mo-
tivated charges in Saudi Arabia. Until 
there are consequences for these viola-
tions of human rights and misuse of 
the 
judicial 
process, 
nothing 
will 
change. 
Fortunately, our hands are not tied. 
The United States can do more than 
simply call for Ms. al-Hathloul’s re-
lease. Section 7031(c) of division G of 
the Further Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2020, which applies to all for-
eign countries, states that ‘‘[o]fficials 
of foreign governments and their im-
mediate family members about whom 
the Secretary of State has credible in-
formation have been involved, directly 
or indirectly, in . . . a gross violation 
of human rights shall be ineligible for 
entry into the United States.’’ 
Secretary of State Pompeo unques-
tionably has such information. Ms. al- 
Hathloul’s prolonged, arbitrary deten-
tion and abuse in custody are gross vio-
lations of human rights. Secretary 
Pompeo should apply section 7031(c) 
and immediately impose visa restric-
tions on all Saudi Government officials 
involved, directly or indirectly, in her 
detention and abuse. That is our law. 
It is as ironic as it is unconscionable 
that the Crown Prince has been praised 
for ending the ban on a woman’s abil-
ity to drive a car in Saudi Arabia, at 
the same time that his government is 
unjustly and cruelly imprisoning a cou-
rageous woman for advocating for that

U.S. SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE 
ON ETHICS ANNUAL REPORT 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent, 
for 
myself 
as 
chairman of the Select Committee on 
Ethics and for Senator CHRISTOPHER A. 
COONS, vice chairman of the com-
mittee, that the Annual Report for the 
Select Committee on Ethics for cal-
endar year 2019 be printed in the 
RECORD. The Committee issues this re-
port today, January 28, 2020, as re-
quired by the Honest Leadership and 
Open Government Act of 2007. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE 
ON ETHICS 
116TH CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION 
JANUARY 28, 2020 
The Honest Leadership and Open Govern-
ment Act of 2007 (the Act) calls for the Se-
lect Committee on Ethics of the United 
States Senate to issue an annual report no 
later than January 31st of each year pro-
viding information in certain categories de-
scribing its activities for the preceding year. 
Reported below is the information describing 
the Committee’s activities in 2019 in the cat-
egories set forth in the Act: 
(1) The number of alleged violations of 
Senate rules received from any source, in-
cluding the number raised by a Senator or 
staff of the Committee: 251. (In addition, 16 
alleged violations from previous years were 
carried into 2019.) 
(2) The number of alleged violations that 
were dismissed— 
(A) For lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
or in which, even if the allegations in the 
complaint are true, no violation of Senate 
rules would exist: 135. (This figure includes 4 
matters from the previous year carried into 
2019.) 
(B) Because they failed to provide suffi-
cient facts as to any material violation of 
the Senate rules beyond mere allegation or 
assertion: 118. (This figure includes 5 matters 
from previous years carried into 2019.) 
(3) The number of alleged violations for 
which the Committee staff conducted a pre-
liminary inquiry: 16. (This figure includes 8 
matters from previous years carried into 
2019.) 
(4) The number of alleged violations for 
which the Committee staff conducted a pre-
liminary inquiry that resulted in an adju-
dicatory review: 0. 
(5) The number of alleged violations for 
which the Committee staff conducted a pre-
liminary inquiry and the Committee dis-
missed the matter for lack of substantial 
merit or because it was inadvertent, tech-
nical or otherwise of a de minimis nature: 11. 
(6) The number of alleged violations for 
which the Committee staff conducted a pre-
liminary inquiry and the Committee issued 
private or public letters of admonition: 0. 
(7) The number of matters resulting in a 
disciplinary sanction: 0. 
(8) Any other information deemed by the 
Committee to be appropriate to describe its 
activities in the previous year: 
In 2019, the Committee staff conducted 36 
Member and committee office campaign 
briefings (includes 6 remedial training ses-
sions); 21 employee code of conduct training 
sessions; 11 public financial disclosure clin-
ics, seminars, and webinars; 19 ethics semi-
nars and customized briefings for Member 
DC offices, state offices, and Senate commit-
tees; 4 private sector ethics briefings; and 3 
international briefings. 
In 2019, the Committee staff handled ap-
proximately 10,998 inquiries (via telephone 
and email) for ethics advice and guidance. 
In 2019, the Committee wrote approxi-
mately 784 ethics advisory letters and re-
sponses including, but not limited to, 581 
travel and gifts matters (Senate Rule 35) and 
133 conflict of interest matters (Senate Rule 
37). 
In 2019, the Committee received 3,586 public 
financial disclosure and periodic disclosure 
of financial transactions reports.

TRIAL OF PRESIDENT DONALD J. 
TRUMP 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
the impeachment trial of President 
Trump has devolved into a parade of 
last-minute red herrings meant to dis-
tract this body from the issue at hand. 
The near-hysteria over books, bore-
dom, and beef jerky has provided a con-
venient vehicle for the House man-
agers, who are trying their best to ped-
dle outrage as evidence. 
We learned nothing new from the 
House managers’ presentations, but 
outside the Senate Chamber, they have 
been doing their best to convince us 
that we are one ‘‘bombshell’’ away 
from, at last, having all the elements 
needed for a speedy conviction. These 
efforts to keep unfounded allegations 
in the limelight have not gone unno-
ticed by those who should be com-
manding our attention: the American 
people. 
Outside the beltway, Americans have 
grown weary of trials and talking 
points. They have heard enough, and 
they have had enough. 
Taking that feedback into consider-
ation, I thought it might be helpful to 
offer an update on what we could be fo-
cusing on instead of this farcical par-
tisan grudge match. 
Behind the scenes, we are limping 
along as best we can, but our focus is 
necessarily distracted from regular 
business. Before our time was monopo-
lized by impeachment, the Senate was 
making wonderful progress on filling 
the Federal bench with well-qualified, 
constitutionalist judges. 
When we weren’t interviewing those 
nominees, members of the Judiciary 
Committee spent time hearing testi-
mony on privacy, competition, and the 
crisis on our southern border. 
Before impeachment, Senators serv-
ing on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee 
were hard at work considering a com-
prehensive mental health bill that 
would 
strengthen 
veteran 
mental 
health and suicide prevention pro-
grams. My own IMPROVE Act is part 
of this effort. We were also working on 
the IT Reform Act, which would im-
prove information technology projects 
at the VA, and the Network of Support 
Act, which would help VA officials 
guide veterans through the emotional 
upheaval of transitioning between Ac-
tive Duty and civilian life. We were 
doing all of this in addition to our con-
tinued oversight of the VA MISSION 
Act, and check-ins on struggling clin-
ics such as the one in Murfreesboro, 
TN, which just reduced bed space for 
veterans struggling with opiate addic-
tion and thoughts of suicide. 
This Thursday, we have an Armed 
Services Committee hearing on the 
U.S.’ role in AFRICOM. When I visited 
with our troops in Djibouti and Soma-
lia at the end of last year, I saw first-
hand the importance of our advisory 
support 
on 
the 
African 
continent. 
Drawing down resources or personnel 
in AFRICOM would harm our position 
as we compete with Russia and China— 
but we won’t have much time to dis-
cuss this potentially disastrous change. 
Every day, work grinds to a halt at 1:00 
p.m., so that we can sit in our seats in 
the Senate Chamber and focus on the 
impeachment trial. 
We could be paying attention to the 
full-blown health crisis plaguing our 
rural communities. Since 2010, 118 rural 
hospitals have shut their doors. Four-
teen of those facilities were in my 
home State of Tennessee. Between 
these hospital closures, and high drug 
prices, there is enough work to be done 
in the health care sector alone to keep 
us busy through Christmas. 
Mister President, if Tennessee is a 
good test group for the rest of the Na-
tion—and it usually is—I can tell you 
that when asked to choose between dis-
cussing impeachment politics and real 
world problems, the American people 
are much more worried about trade, 
transportation, 
and 
manufacturing, 
and how evolving policy initiatives will 
affect prices at the grocery store. 
I would encourage my colleagues to 
remember the cost of indulging these 
proceedings and to listen to their con-
stituents back home and not the 
breathless coverage that dominates the 
24 hour news cycle.

H. CON. RES. 83 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, H. 
Con. Res. 83 directs the President to 
terminate the use of U.S. Armed 
Forces to engage in hostilities against 
Iran, unless Congress has authorized 
the use of military force against Iran 
or such use is necessary to defend 
against an imminent armed attack. H. 
Con. Res. 83 was agreed to in the House 
of Representatives on January 9, 2020 
and received in the Senate and referred 
to the Senate Committee on Foreign 
Relations on January 13, 2020. 
The War Powers Resolution, PL 93– 
148, 
has 
special 
procedures 
under-
scoring the privileged nature of a con-
current resolution like H. Con. Res. 83. 
Section 1546(c) of the War Powers Reso-
lution requires that once a privileged 
concurrent resolution such as H. Con. 
Res. 83 has been passed by the House, it 
must be referred to the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee, and ‘‘shall be re-
ported out by such committee together 
with its recommendations within fif-
teen calendar days.’’ Fifteen calendar

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S630 
January 28, 2020 
days from January 13 is today, January 
28, 2020. Under the law, the concurrent 
resolution may be reported out with a 
favorable or unfavorable recommenda-
tion, or no recommendation at all, but 
it must be reported out. 
Unfortunately, it appears that the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
majority leadership has decided to 
allow the 15 calendar days to lapse 
without taking action on H. Con. Res. 
83. This failure to act leaves a statu-
tory obligation unfulfilled. 
I understand that the chairman is 
basing this inaction primarily on the 
contention that a concurrent resolu-
tion under 50 U.S.C. 1544(c) may be 
privileged only if it uses the word ‘‘re-
move’’ or the phrase ‘‘removal of 
United States Armed Forces engaged in 
hostilities,’’ rather than ‘‘terminate’’ 
or ‘‘terminate the use of United States 
Armed Forces to engage in hostilities’’ 
as used in H. Con. Res. 83. The argu-
ment appears to be that the use of ‘‘re-
moved’’ in 1544(c) of the War Powers 
Resolution eliminates the possibility 
of privilege if any other terminology is 
used, regardless of functional equiva-
lency. This argument suggests that 
‘‘removal’’ is a term of art required for 
privilege. 
The approach is unjustifiably restric-
tive. Treating ‘‘removal’’ as a term of 
art required for privilege is incon-
sistent with the overarching purpose of 
the War Powers Resolution and with-
out support in either the statutory 
framework or legislative history. It 
also undermines Senate and congres-
sional prerogatives. 
The purpose of the War Powers Reso-
lution was for Congress to reconfirm 
and reassert its constitutional powers 
over ‘‘undeclared’’ wars. The avail-
ability of a privileged and binding reso-
lution to force a President to stop 
using U.S. Armed Forces in hostilities 
is central to that purpose. Limiting 
such privilege to a single phrase or 
word is inconsistent with this reasser-
tion of congressional powers and is nei-
ther a feature of the statute nor its 
legislative history. 
The statutory framework of the War 
Powers Resolution does not support 
the assertion that ‘‘removal’’ or ‘‘re-
moval from hostilities’’ are terms of 
art that are required for and exclusive 
to the availability of privilege. To the 
contrary, those terms are not defined 
in law; nor is there any reference in the 
statute to a military or other usage of 
those phrases to suggest that they are 
terms of art. 
The absence of statutorily mandated 
language for privilege in the War Pow-
ers Resolution directly contrasts with 
many other statutes in which Congress 
expressly requires specific language for 
privilege to attach. For example, in 
contrast to the War Powers Resolution, 
section 130(f) of the Atomic Energy Act 
of 1954, PL 83–703, section 101 of the 
Arms Export Control Act, PL 90–629, 
and section 216(c) of the Countering 
America’s Adversaries Through Sanc-
tions Act, PL 115–44 all require specific 
text for privileged resolutions and pro-
vide that text in quotations in the 
statute. Clearly, as evidenced by laws 
enacted before and after the War Pow-
ers Resolution, Congress knows how to 
require the use of unique, statutorily 
mandated language for privilege to 
apply. The fact that it did not do so in 
the 
War 
Powers 
Resolution 
dem-
onstrates that there was no intent to 
limit privilege to use of a single word 
or phrase. 
Further, the legislative record of the 
War Powers Resolution does not sup-
port the assertion that there is an ex-
clusive connection between the use of 
‘‘removal’’ and the availability of 
privilege. To the contrary, the record 
indicates that ‘‘remove’’ and ‘‘termi-
nate’’ were used synonymously. The 
record is replete with the interchange-
able usage of synonymous terms con-
sistent with a cessation of the use of 
U.S. forces in hostilities. For example, 
House Report 93–287 uses no less than 
seven terms in this regard, including 
‘‘conclude,’’ 
‘‘disengage,’’ 
‘‘remove,’’ 
‘‘terminate,’’ ‘‘abandon such action,’’ 
and ‘‘stop.’’ In fact, the conferees even 
used ‘‘terminate’’ to describe the privi-
leged resolution envisioned in 1544(c), 
clearly demonstrating that these terms 
were considered to be functionally 
equivalent for purposes of War Powers. 
‘‘The House joint resolution provided 
that use of United States Armed 
Forces by the President without a dec-
laration of war or specific statutory 
authorization could be terminated by 
Congress through the use of a concur-
rent resolution. The Senate amend-
ment provided for such termination by 
a bill or joint resolution.’’ H. Rept. 93– 
547, Conference Report to H.J. Res. 542. 
This legislative history, in tandem 
with a statutory construct that does 
not require a term of art, demonstrates 
that the insistence on such a term for 
privilege is misguided. 
Finally, strictly limiting privilege to 
a resolution that uses ‘‘remove’’ is in-
consistent with Senate and congres-
sional perogatives. The purpose of the 
War 
Powers 
Resolution—reasserting 
the power of Congress over undeclared 
wars—can be vindicated only if the ex-
ecutive branch and its supporters in 
the Senate cannot use committee or 
floor procedure to bottle up a resolu-
tion consistent with both the purpose 
and construct of the War Powers Reso-
lution. Reading into the statute a re-
quirement 
for 
specific 
terminology 
where 
no 
such 
requirement 
exists 
unjustifiably restricts Senate action 
and limits the reassertion of congres-
sional authority over War Powers. 
For the reasons stated above, I urge 
the chairman to immediately take the 
necessary steps to ensure full compli-
ance with the law.

REMEMBERING RETIRED ARMY 
COLONEL (DR.) ROBERT J.T. JOY 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I pay 
tribute to a pioneer in the field of mili-
tary medicine, retired Army COL Dr. 
Robert J.T. Joy. Colonel Joy was 
founding professor of military medi-
cine and commandant of the School of 
Medicine at the Uniformed Services 
University, USU. Most recently, he 
served as professor emeritus of USU’s 
Section of Military Medical History. 
He passed away last year at the age of 
90. 
Born in Rhode Island and raised be-
tween Narragansett, RI, and St. Peters-
burg, FL, he studied pre-med and pre- 
law at the University of Rhode Island, 
before attending Yale University Med-
ical School on a Reserve medical offi-
cers training scholarship. 
From there, his service to his coun-
try began. After assignments stateside, 
Dr. Joy volunteered to lead the Walter 
Reed Army Institute of 
Research, 
WRAIR, team to Vietnam, where he re-
ceived his first—of four—Legion of 
Merit medals and his team received a 
Meritorious Unit Citation for their 
field research. After becoming Deputy 
Director and then Director of WRAIR, 
many thought he had found his dream 
job. 
However, after a meeting with Dr. 
Jay Sanford, the first dean of USU, in 
1976, Colonel Joy received a transfer to 
take the position of professor of mili-
tary medicine and commandant of the 
School of Medicine at the newly cre-
ated USU. While there, he was instru-
mental in the creation of the field of 
military 
medical 
history, 
and 
his 
teachings, 
lectures, 
and 
leadership 
were integral to the development of to-
day’s ‘‘joint’’ concept of military medi-
cine. 
Dr. Joy retired from Active Duty in 
1981 and was awarded the Distinguished 
Service Medal for his Army career. He 
continued to teach as a civilian pro-
fessor until 2005, and his legacy lives on 
through his students—the physicians 
and surgical teams that continue to 
provide world-class care for our wound-
ed, ill, and injured service members. 
I would like to close with a quote 
about Dr. Joy from retired Army BG 
Robert Doughty, professor and chair of 
history at the United States Military 
Academy at West Point: ‘‘His contribu-
tion has influenced, and will continue 
to influence, students, historians, and 
soldiers for decades to come.’’ 
I salute Dr. Joy and extend my con-
dolences to his family.

TRIBUTE TO CARY JONES 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to 
take a few minutes today to honor 
Cary Jones, an Oregonian retiring after 
a long career in the Coast Guard and 
the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
The bottom line is Mr. Jones has em-
braced and embodied the essence of 
public service throughout his distin-
guished career. 
He joined the Coast Guard in 1976 and 
was stationed in Honolulu, Seattle, and 
Coos Bay. He served for several years 
aboard the USCGC Boutwell, a high-en-
durance cutter used to intercept smug-
gling vessels.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S631 
January 28, 2020 
Mr. Jones left the Coast Guard in 2001 
as a senior chief yeoman, and he could 
have sailed off into an easy retirement. 
Instead, he went to work for the VA, 
where he would spend nearly two dec-
ades 
helping 
Oregon 
veterans. 
He 
served in a number of roles at the Port-
land VA Medical Center, but in every 
capacity he sought to do right by vet-
erans. He worked with my Portland 
staff for years, and if you ever want to 
get one of them going, just ask how 
helpful Cary Jones was. They will tell 
you he worked on more than 10,000 con-
gressional inquiries, each of which rep-
resented an attempt to help an Oregon 
veteran or military family. 
Cary Jones is a shining example of 
what public service is supposed to be 
all about. He has always been one of 
the good guys, in it for the right rea-
sons, and always laser-focused on lift-
ing up people who need a little bit of 
help. 
Mr. Jones’ career reminds me of a 
quote by the famous naturalist John 
Burroughs: ‘‘For anything worth hav-
ing one must pay the price; and the 
price is always work, patience, love, 
self-sacrifice—no paper currency, no 
promises to pay, but the gold of real 
service.’’ 
And so today I say thank you to Sen-
ior Chief Yeoman Cary Jones for his 
work, patience, love and self-sacrifice. 
I say thank you for leading by exam-
ple, for showing countless Oregonians 
that public service is a noble calling, 
and for paying the gold of real service. 
I wish you the best as you embark on 
your well-deserved retirement. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO CARL ADRIAN 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to recognize the career and 
service of Carl Adrian, who is retiring 
this month after more than 16 years as 
the president of the Tri-Cities Eco-
nomic Development Council in my 
home State of Washington. 
Carl has devoted his career to mak-
ing the Tri-Cities an economic power-
house, and throughout his time as the 
longest serving president of TRIDEC, 
Carl Adrian accomplished so many im-
portant things for the region. Thanks 
in part to his work, the Tri-Cities of 
today is very different from the Tri- 
Cities of 16 years ago. 
Under Carl’s leadership, more than 
1,300 businesses set up shop in the Tri- 
Cities and more than 35,000 new jobs 
were created. These business leaders 
weren’t drawn to the Tri-Cities just be-
cause of the weather or the excellent 
Washington wine; they came because 
Carl helped create new opportunities 
and supported significant investments 
for employers in the region. 
I have been so pleased to partner 
with Carl and TRIDEC on so many en-
deavors over the years. When it comes 
to Hanford, Carl saw the site as history 
that should be celebrated and remem-
bered. We worked together to establish 
the Manhattan Project Historical Park 
in Richland, which honors the more 
than 51,000 Hanford workers who helped 
drive our country’s nuclear program 
and remembers those whose lands were 
taken when the facilities were built. 
The site is helping to educate new gen-
erations and bringing new visitors to 
the Tri-Cities. More than 10,000 people 
visit every year from all 50 States and 
more than 80 countries. 
Carl also knows how important it is 
that we get Hanford cleaned up. He has 
been a stalwart advocate for the fund-
ing we need to clean up the site. And I 
share his strong belief that the Federal 
Government has a moral obligation to 
the Tri-Cities and our State to make 
sure the Hanford cleanup and its work-
ers receive Federal funding they need. 
Throughout his time at TRIDEC, 
Carl has worked on so many other 
projects of importance to the Tri-Cit-
ies. He has been one of the Pacific 
Northwest 
National 
Laboratory’s 
strongest 
supporters, 
working 
tire-
lessly to make sure Congress and the 
Department of Energy recognize the 
importance of the lab to our region and 
country. As a result of his advocacy, 
the lab has experienced significant 
growth, particularly in energy innova-
tion including grid security, battery 
storage and clean energy technologies. 
I was also proud to work with Carl 
and TRIDEC to expand the Tri-City Re-
gional Airport. His leadership enabled 
the airport to bring non-stop daily 
flights 
from 
San 
Francisco, 
Min-
neapolis, and Chicago to the region, 
along with many other destinations. 
These flights have helped grow the 
attractiveness of southeastern Wash-
ington and allowed many more people 
to see what the Tri-Cities have to offer. 
For more than 16 years, Carl Adrian’s 
leadership of the Tri-Cities Economic 
Development Council has made an im-
pact throughout Southeastern Wash-
ington and our entire State. We are all 
grateful for his hard work and many 
contributions. 
Congratulations on your retirement, 
Carl. I wish you and Rheta great suc-
cess as you transition to the next chap-
ter of your life.

TRIBUTE TO COLONEL ROBERT 
DESOUSA 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, today I 
rise to honor the service of COL Robert 
DeSousa upon his retirement from the 
Army on February 29, 2020. For over 26 
years, Colonel DeSousa has served with 
distinction and dedication in the U.S. 
Army Reserve and the Pennsylvania 
National Guard. Many Pennsylvanians 
may know Colonel DeSousa in his civil-
ian capacity as the widely respected 
State director for my offices in the 
Commonwealth. 
A native of New Jersey but an adopt-
ed 
son 
of 
Pennsylvania, 
Colonel 
DeSousa holds a bachelor’s degree from 
Bucknell University, a law degree from 
the Dickinson School of Law, and a 
master’s degree from the U.S. Army 
War College. He began his military ca-
reer as a judge advocate with the U.S. 
Army Reserve in 1993 and quickly es-
tablished himself as an outstanding de-
fense lawyer and soldier. Following the 
September 11 terror attacks, Colonel 
DeSousa aided in the mobilization of 
our troops and then deployed to Iraq in 
2007. 
While 
deployed, 
he 
simulta-
neously held three distinct positions 
for the Pennsylvania National Guard, 
the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Army 
Reserve. 
In 2008, Colonel DeSousa returned to 
serve in the 28th Infantry Division 
Headquarters of the Pennsylvania Na-
tional Guard. The following year, he 
was tasked as the first ever regional 
defense counsel in what would become 
the Army’s first fully integrated trial 
defense service for Reserve, Active 
Duty, and National Guard soldiers. As 
a result of Colonel DeSousa’s leader-
ship in this role, thousands of Army 
soldiers in nine different States gained 
greater access to legal defense services. 
He was subsequently appointed as the 
State judge advocate for the Pennsyl-
vania National Guard’s Joint Force 
Headquarters in 2013. In this position, 
from which he will retire this Feb-
ruary, Colonel DeSousa advised the 
Pennsylvania National Guard’s adju-
tant general and his command staff on 
legal and ethical matters while super-
vising nearly 50 judge advocates. 
Colonel DeSousa has built an exem-
plary career on service and leadership. 
His selflessness and competency, un-
doubtedly aided by his positive can-do 
attitude and infectious smile, have 
earned him numerous honors in the 
U.S. Army Reserve and Pennsylvania 
National Guard. These honors include a 
Bronze Star Medal, Meritorious Serv-
ice Medal, Army Commendation Medal, 
and over a dozen other commendations. 
His dedication to public service is 
evinced by his civilian career, too, hav-
ing previously been a Federal law 
clerk, an assistant U.S. attorney, the 
chief counsel for Pennsylvania’s De-
partment of State, and the inspector 
general 
for 
the 
Commonwealth 
of 
Pennsylvania. 
Thankfully, Colonel DeSousa’s re-
tirement is not the end of his service to 
Pennsylvanians. He will continue in his 
current role as State director for my 
Senate office, where he oversees the 
daily operations of my seven State- 
based offices. In this role, Colonel 
DeSousa is famous for his bits of wis-
dom he passes down. In particular, he 
reminds his colleagues often that ‘‘an 
email sent or a phone call made does 
not mean mission accomplished.’’ Colo-
nel DeSousa meets this mission every 
day, as he can generally be found out 
on the road, crisscrossing our great 
Commonwealth to meet with constitu-
ents. 
Colonel DeSousa, who is known to 
appreciate a good cigar, the occasional 
whiskey, and, unrelatedly, sporting 
dapper bow-ties, is a true friend to 
Pennsylvanians anywhere. I offer Colo-
nel DeSousa my heartfelt congratula-
tions on his military retirement and

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
150TH ANNIVERSARY OF MISSOURI 
UNIVERSITY 
OF 
SCIENCE 
AND 
TECHNOLOGY 
∑ Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, today I 
stand to recognize the 150th anniver-
sary of Missouri University of Science 
and Technology. Part of the University 
of Missouri System, Missouri S&T was 
founded in 1870 in Rolla, MO, as one of 
the 
first 
technological 
institutions 
west of the Mississippi and continues 
to be one of the top technological re-
search institutions in the nation. 
Originally established as the Univer-
sity of Missouri School of Mines and 
Metallurgy, Missouri S&T has grown 
from its original mining focus to offer 
99 degree programs, while maintaining 
its leadership in engineering and the 
sciences. In fact, Missouri S&T is con-
sistently ranked as one of the top engi-
neering schools in the nation. 
Missouri S&T was chartered on Feb-
ruary 24, 1870, and classes were first 
called to order on November 6, 1871. 
Since that time, more than 60,000 men 
and women have gone on to carry their 
status as ‘‘miners’’ into successful en-
deavors all over the world. Missouri 
S&T alumni consistently achieve some 
of the highest average starting salaries 
in the Midwest, and the university is 
ranked sixth in the Nation for annual 
return on investment. 
The campus boasts a Center for Infra-
structure Engineering Systems, a Ma-
terials Research Center, a Center for 
Biomedical Research, and several other 
centers generating world-class discov-
eries. Faculty, staff, and students 
produce research on everything from 
bioactive glass and bioactive ceramic 
scaffolds for regenerating bone to ad-
vancing 
treatments 
for 
traumatic 
brain injury. Partnerships with hos-
pitals, the U.S. Army, and local busi-
nesses that are industry leaders have 
strengthened and grown already suc-
cessful programs and put Missouri S&T 
at the forefront of solving difficult 
problems. 
The commitment of Missouri Univer-
sity of Science and Technology to edu-
cate young men and women and push 
for solutions to some of our most dif-
ficult problems is to be commended. I 
extend my sincere thanks for every-
thing the faculty, staff, and adminis-
trators have accomplished over the last 
150 years. Congratulations to Chan-
cellor Mohammad Dehghani and all 
Missouri S&T faculty, staff, students, 
and alumni on this important occa-
sion.∑

RECOGNIZING THE BONNEVILLE 
HOTEL 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along 
with my colleagues Senator JAMES E. 
RISCH and Representative MIKE SIMP-
SON, I congratulate the city of Idaho 
Falls and Bonneville County on the 
preservation of the historic Hotel Bon-
neville. 
The Bonneville County Heritage As-
sociation 
provided 
historical 
back-
ground about the area and the original 
naming and purpose of the hotel that 
has stood in Idaho Falls for nearly a 
century. The association notes this re-
markable structure was named for Cap-
tain Bonneville, who led an expedition 
from 1832 to 1834 through the vast 
country between the Missouri and Co-
lumbia Rivers. Idaho later became part 
of the United States through the Or-
egon Treaty in 1846. Then, on March 4, 
1863, 
President 
Abraham 
Lincoln 
signed a bill establishing the Idaho 
Territory, and Idaho became the 43rd 
State on July 3, 1890. Further, the Bon-
neville County Heritage Association 
explained that on February 7, 1911, 
Governor James Henry Hawley put an 
end to a fight for county division by 
signing a bill designating Bonneville 
County and naming Idaho Falls the 
county seat. 
The Bonneville County Heritage As-
sociation found a May 1927 Times Reg-
ister article providing an account of 
the historical significance of the Hotel 
Bonneville in Idaho Falls at the time of 
its construction that states the hotel 
‘‘is the result of the desire on the part 
of a number of the people of Idaho 
Falls, and community, to have the use 
of a strictly first class hotel, with ade-
quate accommodations and quality of 
service which would enable Idaho Falls, 
as a community, to invite public gath-
erings and conventions and to be pre-
pared to take care of them in a way 
and manner, which would reflect on the 
community.’’ The name Hotel Bonne-
ville was selected for the original hotel 
to honor the founder of this part of the 
country, and the hotel opened its doors 
for business on June 1, 1927. 
The Bonneville Hotel has recently 
undergone extensive renovations trans-
forming it into an affordable housing 
complex that includes retail space. We 
commend the visionaries and partners 
who came together to provide a new 
life for this local landmark. A plaque 
at the building notes the original Hotel 
Bonneville was built by 481 citizens. 
Through the leadership of Idaho Falls 
Mayor Rebecca Casper, the Idaho Falls 
City Council, the Idaho Falls Redevel-
opment Agency, and the hard work and 
vison of many Idahoans, the renewal of 
this landmark honors the founders of 
the county and those who worked to 
build and renovate the hotel and pre-
serves this historic building for genera-
tions to come. Congratulations on this 
local transformation.∑

TRIBUTE TO BRANDON ROBERTS 
AND STACIA FUZESY 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Brandon Roberts and Stacia Fuzesy of 
Chouteau County for their hard work 
and entrepreneurial spirit. 
Brandon and Stacia opened the Gold-
en Triangle Brewing Co. in Fort Ben-
ton. Their craft beers showcase the 
rich history of Montana ag and the 
grain growers of the Golden Triangle. 
Working with local farmers, Brandon 
and Stacia are energizing the local 
economy and crafting beers that Mon-
tanans can call their own. 
They have also worked with local 
historians to help create unique names 
for their craft beer that highlight Mon-
tana history such as Shepweizen and 
Bentonbier. 
It is my honor to recognize Brandon 
and Stacia for opening up this thriving 
Montana small business that promotes 
our rich history and values. Small 
craft breweries like the Golden Tri-
angle Brewing Co. are helping drive the 
economy across Big Sky Country. Keep 
on brewing.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO ANNA, GRACE, AND 
JOY WILLIAMS 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Anna, Grace, and Joy Williams of Dan-
iels County, for their hard work in 
planning Hands Across Scobey, an 
event that raised money for Montana 
foster children. 
These three Montana sisters took the 
initiative to give back to their commu-
nity and organize an effort to help 
those most vulnerable in our society— 
foster children. 
Their 
mother, 
Ruth 
Williams, 
a 
mother of five, including one foster 
child, was the motivation for the 
‘Hands Across Scobey’ event. 
It is my honor to recognize Anna, 
Grace, and Joy for their selflessness 
and willingness to serve others. Their 
charitable effort is exemplary of the 
Montana spirit. 
I look forward to following the future 
accomplishments of these three young 
ladies.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO PASTOR DOUGLAS P. 
JONES 
∑ Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Pastor Douglas P. 
Jones of Welcome Missionary Baptist 
Church of Pontiac, MI, as the con-
gregation and the Pontiac community 
celebrate his 30th pastoral anniversary. 
Pastor Jones moved from his native 
Cincinnati in 1989 to Pontiac, MI, to as-
sume 
leadership 
of 
Welcome 
Mis-
sionary Baptist Church. Under his 
guidance, membership at Welcome Mis-
sionary Baptist Church grew from a 
few hundred to more than 4,000 wor-
shippers. From the very beginning of 
his tenure at the church, Pastor Jones 
has worked tirelessly to implement a 
vision of unity and kindness, bringing 
worshippers together so that they may 
find strength in their community and, 
with that strength, work toward posi-
tive change throughout the Pontiac 
area. 
His focus on ensuring that church 
members’ needs are met can be seen in

the number and diversity of ministries 
established at Welcome. In support of 
his younger members, Pastor Jones 
created both the Young Men Making a 
Difference Ministry for preteen and 
teenage boys, as well as the Teen Es-
teem Ministry for preteen and teenage 
girls. Pastor Jones has endeavored to 
create resources for the most vulner-
able members of the Welcome commu-
nity such as the T.I.P.—Tots, Infants, 
and 
Preschoolers—ministry, 
which 
looks after the congregation’s young-
est members, the Exodus Dependency 
Program, which assists those con-
tending with problems relating to sub-
stance abuse and HIV, and the Domes-
tic Violence Ministry. 
Pastor Jones has not limited his 
dedication to service to the members of 
Welcome Missionary Baptist Church 
but, rather, extended his unwavering 
faith and generosity to the broader 
Pontiac community. He has been fun-
damental in the positive growth seen 
throughout the city over the last 30 
years. He has served on committees, 
boards, and partnerships in support of 
the community, including the Pontiac 
Youth Assistance, the NAACP North 
Oakland Medical Center, and the Wood-
ward Dream Cruise, Inc., to name only 
a few. Seeing a lack of unity among 
those trying to create change, Pastor 
Jones founded the Greater Pontiac 
Community Coalition, a federation of 
over 190 Oakland County individuals, 
community groups, clergy, elected offi-
cials, and businesses that work to-
gether to encourage positive change on 
the individual, social, and institutional 
level through advocacy and community 
action. Pastor Jones has further been a 
driving force behind helping the stu-
dents of Pontiac achieve their goals of 
pursuing higher education. Under his 
guidance the Pontiac Promise Zone 
Scholarship 
Program 
was 
created, 
which has given many Pontiac stu-
dents the chance to obtain the finan-
cial aid necessary to pursue their 
dreams of higher education in the 
State of Michigan. 
Since his arrival in 1989, Pastor 
Jones has been a source of strength and 
good will for all those in the Pontiac 
community. He is often called upon to 
act as a consensus builder among 
groups and people of different perspec-
tives, preaching partnership and co-
operation in order to inspire success 
and transformation. He has worked 
tirelessly in pursuit of what he thinks 
is best for the community and has done 
so while spreading a message of moral-
ity and kindness. 
I have no doubt that the congrega-
tion at Welcome Missionary Baptist 
Church is proud to call Pastor Jones 
their leader and celebrate his many ac-
complishments over the last 30 years. I 
am grateful to Pastor Jones for his 
friendship and for his selflessness in 
serving the residents of Pontiac and 
surrounding area. I wish Pastor Jones, 
First Lady JoAnn, and their family 
continued happiness and success as 
they continue to work for the better-
ment of the community.∑ 
TRIBUTE TO NATHANIEL JONES 
∑ Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
to honor the memory of one of our 
country’s great civil rights leaders and 
judges, the Honorable Nathaniel Jones, 
who passed away on January 26 at the 
age of 93. 
Judge Jones was a native of Youngs-
town in my home State of Ohio, a vet-
eran who served in the Air Force dur-
ing World War II, and a tireless advo-
cate for justice and equality. After his 
time in the military, he earned an un-
dergraduate degree and a JD from 
Youngstown State University. 
For much of the 1960s, Judge Jones 
was the assistant U.S. attorney for the 
Northern District of Ohio at the ap-
pointment of Attorney General Robert 
F. Kennedy. In 1969, he became the gen-
eral counsel for the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Colored 
People, NAACP, where he argued nu-
merous 
cases 
before 
the 
Supreme 
Court. 
In 1979 he moved to the Cincinnati 
area upon being appointed as an ap-
peals judge for the Sixth Circuit by 
President Carter, and he served admi-
rably in that role for decades. With all 
of his experience, and his reputation 
for 
integrity 
and 
problem-solving, 
Judge Jones was an active member of 
the Cincinnati community and widely 
respected in legal circles. As an exam-
ple, he was asked to deliver the inau-
gural Judge A. Leon Higginbotham 
Distinguished Memorial Lecture at 
Harvard Law School. 
His work also included helping to end 
the apartheid regime in South Africa, 
working to promote a free and inde-
pendent Namibia, participating in the 
U.S.-Egypt 
Judicial 
Exchange 
Pro-
gram, and advocating for human rights 
within the Soviet Union. Among his 
many accomplishments, he received 
the 
Distinguished 
Service 
Citation 
from the National Conference for Com-
munity Justice and the State Depart-
ment’s Millennium International Vol-
unteer Award. For all of his accom-
plishments, worked in the House of 
Representatives to write and pass leg-
islation to rename the U.S. courthouse 
in Youngstown after Judge Jones—the 
courthouse stands only a few miles 
down the road from where he was 
raised as a child. It now bears the name 
of this proud son of Youngstown. 
Back home in Cincinnati, Judge 
Jones was just as important a figure in 
the fight for a more equitable society, 
having taught law at the University of 
Cincinnati, among other schools. I was 
proud to work with him on launching 
the National Underground Railroad 
Museum, housed in my hometown of 
Cincinnati. It is there in large part be-
cause of the efforts of Judge Jones, 
who also served as a co-chair of the 
board of trustees for the museum. I was 
honored to work with him over the 
years to further its mission. Just last 
fall, the University of Cincinnati Col-
lege of Law renamed its Center for 
Race, Gender, and Social Justice in his 
honor. 
Judge Jones was a model public serv-
ant, working to better his community 
and his fellow man. I will remember 
him as a friend who brought people to-
gether to support racial healing, equal-
ity and to improve the community. His 
legacy of justice and equality before 
the law should inspire all of us to con-
tinue to seek positive change. 
Today, my thoughts are with his 
family—his 
sister, 
Allie 
Jean, 
his 
daughters Stephanie and Pamela, his 
sons Rick, William, and Marc, and the 
many others whose lives he touched.∑

REMEMBERING CARMELLA WOOD 
∑ Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a great Ne-
vadan, American, and member of the 
Greatest Generation, Carmella Wood, 
who passed away on January 26, 2020 at 
the age of 97 in Las Vegas, the city she 
called home in the Silver State since 
2003. 
Carmella, like many others of her 
generation, answered her country’s call 
during World War II, volunteering to 
serve in the fight against tyranny. 
When the U.S. Army would not take 
her because of her 4-foot 11-inch height, 
she joined the war effort, working in a 
factory on the east coast building Cor-
sair Bombers. Carmella’s dedication to 
serving her country is reflected in the 
fact that even though the factory she 
was assigned to was 20 miles from her 
home, she never missed a day, some-
times having to walk in the snow the 
rest of the way to work when the bus 
she rode on could not completely reach 
the factory. She and the women she 
worked with day in and day out kept 
our troops in the fight, and these 
women would eventually come to be 
collectively and affectionately known 
as Rosie the Riveters. Rosies like 
Carmella produced over 297,000 air-
planes, 102,000 tanks, 88,000 warships, 
and countless other pieces of wartime 
equipment which helped American and 
Allied troops defeat enemy forces both 
in the European and Pacific Theaters, 
winning the war and bringing an end to 
the terror Nazi Germany and Japan 
had inflicted upon countless countries. 
After the war Carmella, like many 
other Rosies and members of the 
‘‘greatest generation’’, returned to liv-
ing their lives. They married, had kids 
of their own, and worked outside the 
home. However, Carmella never forgot 
her time as a Rosie. Over 20 years ago, 
she started attending national Rosie 
the Riveter Association reunions and 
other events where she was able to 
share her experiences and teach cur-
rent generations about how these dedi-
cated women kept America fighting in 
the war so their sacrifices and work are 
not forgotten or overlooked. 
Mr. President, please join me in hon-
oring 
and 
remembering 
Carmella 
Wood, one of our legendary Rosie the 
Riveters of World War II, a true Ne-
vadan and American patriot who an-
swered her Nation’s call to service, 
someone who reflects the high ideals of 
this country. Her spirit, perseverance, 
and dedication are an inspiration to all 
Americans, and she will be truly 
missed.∑

RECOGNIZING HULL’S SEAFOOD 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, as chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Small 
Business and Entrepreneurship, each 
week I honor a small business that 
demonstrates America’s unique entre-
preneurial spirit. I am pleased to rec-
ognize a business for its participation 
in Florida’s integral economy and its 
involvement in the community. Today, 
it is my pleasure to name Hull’s Sea-
food of Ormond Beach, FL, as the Sen-
ate Small Business of the Week. 
Jimmy Hull, owner of Hull’s Seafood, 
spent 
his 
childhood 
exploring 
and 
catching fresh fish at Ponce Inlet. At 
20 years old, he obtained his captain’s 
license, began running fishing charters, 
and selling the day’s catch to local 
markets. Eventually, Hull’s Seafood 
opened its doors in 1984. This res-
taurant and market makes a conscious 
effort to support sustainability by only 
selling 
fresh-caught, 
local 
seafood. 
They guarantee each of their cus-
tomer’s seafood is of the highest qual-
ity. Over the years, Jimmy and his 
team have continued to expand the 
business. Led by Jimmy’s strategic vi-
sion, Hull’s Seafood has evolved from a 
small take-out kitchen into a full-serv-
ice restaurant and market. In 2018, 
Hull’s Seafood received support from 
the city of Ormond Beach, which pro-
vided a building improvement grant de-
signed to assist local small businesses. 
Jimmy was able to more than triple 
the size of the restaurant and double 
the number of employees, adding an ad-
ditional forty workers. 
Today, Hull’s Seafood Market and 
Restaurant continues to supply cus-
tomers and other local restaurants 
with the freshest seafood available. 
After operating in Ormond Beach for 
nearly 40 years, the restaurant has be-
come a landmark within the commu-
nity and a gathering place for local 
residents. Located on Ormond Beach’s 
downtown Main Street, Hull’s Seafood 
is active within its community, par-
ticipating in many city events and sup-
porting local artists by hosting con-
certs and displaying art in the res-
taurant 
dining 
room. 
Additionally, 
Hull’s Seafood makes a point of show-
casing other local businesses on their 
social media pages. Jimmy stays true 
to his passion and is a commercial fish-
erman who also operates the res-
taurant’s charter boat to take pas-
sengers on fishing trips. In 2018, Jimmy 
was awarded the Governor’s Business 
Ambassador Award for the restaurant’s 
continuous effort to create local jobs. 
Jimmy and his team was commended 
for his advocacy for fisheries and help-
ing to maintain their sustainability in 
Florida. 
Hull’s Seafood is an excellent exam-
ple of a community and family ori-
ented small business. The entire team’s 
efforts toward sustainability and pro-
viding high quality seafood do not go 
unnoticed. I am proud to recognize 
Jimmy and everyone at Hull’s Seafood 
for their hard work, and I look forward 
to seeing their future successes. Con-
gratulations again on being named the 
Senate Small Business of the Week.∑

TRIBUTE TO ORLY MUNZING 
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today in recognition of Orly Munzing, 
an extraordinary Vermonter and long-
time advocate for family farms and re-
silient communities. 
Orly founded Strolling of the Heifers 
in 2002 in Brattleboro, VT, to help 
bring awareness to the plight of small 
dairy farms. During Orly’s tenure as 
executive director of Strolling of the 
Heifers, she transformed a small town 
parade into a widely renowned event 
celebrating sustainable agriculture and 
family farms. I am proud to have 
marched in many of these parades over 
the last 17 years to celebrate our farms 
and our communities in Vermont and 
around the country. Under Orly’s lead-
ership, Strolling of the Heifers has con-
tinued to expand, now including the 
farm-to-table culinary apprenticeship 
program to provide underserved com-
munity members with the vital skills 
necessary for obtaining good quality 
jobs in the food sector. 
In addition to Strolling of the Heif-
ers, Orly founded the nationally recog-
nized Locavore Index, the first tool to 
measure the growth of the local food 
movement. She also created Windham 
Grows, a program to provide valuable 
skills and resources to farm and food 
entrepreneurs. Just this past year, Orly 
received the Innovation & Spirit Award 
from the Vermont Businesses for So-
cial Responsibility as recognition of 
this work. 
Prior to all these important accom-
plishments, Orly worked for 24 years as 
a learning specialist in the public 
school system and consulted with 
teachers on cutting-edge educational 
techniques. For decades, she has been a 
truly tireless champion who has made 
significant 
strides 
to 
create 
more 
healthy and prosperous rural commu-
nities. At a time of increased recogni-
tion of the profound impact agriculture 
and food have on the vibrancy of rural 
lands, our health, and the health of the 
planet, it is heartening to know that 
dedicated, passionate people like Orly 
are making a real difference in our 
communities. 
Mr. President, I am not only enor-
mously grateful for all of Orly’s many 
contributions over the years, but I am 
also proud to call her a good friend. I 
wish her all the best in her retirement 
and know she will continue to fight for 
more environmentally sound and fun-
damentally just communities.∑

MURRAY, Mr. MARKEY, Mrs. FEINSTEIN,

HOLLEN, Mr. SANDERS, Mrs. GILLI-
BRAND, Ms. WARREN, Mr. DURBIN, Ms. 
HIRONO, Mr. CARDIN, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. 
BOOKER, 
Ms. 
KLOBUCHAR, 
and 
Mr. 
COONS) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 484 
Whereas the world is in the midst of the 
worst global displacement crisis in history, 
with more than 25,900,000 refugees worldwide, 
according to United Nations High Commis-
sioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates; 
Whereas UNHCR reports that global reset-
tlement needs have doubled in recent years, 
reaching over 1,440,000 refugees in 2020; 
Whereas the United States Refugee Admis-
sions Program (USRAP) is a life-saving solu-
tion critical to global humanitarian efforts, 
which serves to strengthen global security, 
leverage United States foreign policy goals, 
and support regional host countries while 
serving individuals and families in need; 
Whereas the United States has been a glob-
al leader in responding to displacement cri-
ses around the world and promoting the safe-
ty, health, and well-being of refugees and 
displaced persons; 
Whereas refugees are the most vetted trav-
elers to enter the United States and are sub-
ject to extensive screening checks, including 
in-person interviews, biometric data checks, 
and multiple interagency checks; 
Whereas the United States Government 
leverages resettlement to encourage other 
countries to keep their doors open to refu-
gees, allow refugee children to attend school, 
and allow adults to work; 
Whereas the USRAP emphasizes early self- 
sufficiency through employment, and most 
adult refugees are employed within their 
first six months of arriving to the United 
States; 
Whereas refugees contribute to their com-
munities by starting businesses, paying 
taxes, sharing their cultural traditions, and 
being involved in their neighborhoods, and 
reports have found that refugees contribute 
more than they consume in State-funded 
services—including for schooling and health 
care; 
Whereas, for over 40 years, the United 
States has resettled up to 200,000 refugees per 
year, with an average admissions goal of 
95,000 refugees per year; 
Whereas the United States Government 
has abdicated its leadership by setting a 
record-low refugee admissions goal in fiscal 
year 2020 at 18,000; 
Whereas, on January 27, 2017, President 
Donald J. Trump released an executive order 
banning individuals from seven Muslim-ma-
jority countries and all refugees from enter-
ing the country; 
Whereas, since that time, the President 
has taken further executive and administra-
tive actions to ban people from Muslim-ma-
jority countries and to dismantle the United 
States refugee program, resulting in signifi-
cantly lowered capacity and loss of institu-
tional memory and experience in the histori-
cally successful USRAP; 
Whereas the President issued a Proclama-
tion on November 9, 2018, that wrongfully 
and illegally blocks people who cross be-
tween ports of entry from applying for asy-
lum, and since then has taken further ag-
gressive steps to dismantle the United States 
asylum system; 
Whereas the Department of Homeland Se-
curity started implementation of the Mi-
grant Protection Protocols on January 29, 
2019, and it has exposed tens of thousands of 
asylum seekers to torture, kidnapping, traf-
ficking, and exploitation by returning them 
to dangerous border cities in Mexico; 
Whereas the 2018 Department of State 
country report for Mexico acknowledges se-
rious and targeted risks faced by migrants 
and 
asylum 
seekers 
in, 
and 
transiting 
through, Mexico, such that it remains an un-
safe place for many; 
Whereas the United States has returned 
more than 24,000 asylum seekers alone to 
Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros, widely recog-
nized as among the most violent cities in the 
world, located in the state of Tamaulipas, 
which is the subject of a Department of 
State ‘‘Level 4: Do Not Travel’’ advisory; 
Whereas sending asylum seekers to an-
other country limits and may completely 
eliminate their opportunity to identify and 
meet with counsel, thereby lowering their 
chances of obtaining relief; and 
Whereas all individuals seeking asylum in 
the United States are entitled to due process 
and access to an attorney: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms the United States’ proud his-
tory of refugee resettlement and protection 
of asylum seekers; 
(2) recognizes January 27, 2020, as the anni-
versary of the first refugee and Muslim ban; 
(3) reaffirms the strong bipartisan commit-
ment of the United States to promote the 
safety, health, and well-being of refugees, in-
cluding through resettlement and the asy-
lum seeking process to the United States for 
those who cannot return home; 
(4) underscores the importance of the 
United States Refugee Admissions Program 
and a robust asylum system as critical tools 
for United States global leadership; 
(5) recognizes the profound consequences 
faced by refugees, asylum seekers, and their 
families who have been stranded, separated, 
and scarred by current United States poli-
cies, leaving thousands mid-process and 
more with little hope of protection in the 
United States; and 
(6) calls upon the United States Govern-
ment— 
(A) to resettle a robust number of refugees 
to meet global need in fiscal years 2020 and 
2021 with an emphasis on rebuilding the re-
settlement program and returning to his-
toric norms; 
(B) to operate the program in good faith in 
an attempt to meet their own stated objec-
tives, restore historic refugee arrivals, im-
prove consultation with Congress, and ad-
here to the clear congressional intent within 
the Refugee Act of 1980 (Public Law 96–212); 
(C) to ensure that no funds be made avail-
able by any Act to implement or enforce the 
Migrant Protection Protocols announced by 
the Secretary of Homeland Security on De-
cember 20, 2018, or any subsequent revisions 
to those protocols; 
(D) to enact the National Origin-Based 
Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants Act, 
introduced in the Senate as S.1123 (116th 
Congress) and in the House of Representa-
tives as H.R.2214 (116th Congress), which 
would terminate the Muslim, refugee, and 
asylum bans; and 
(E) to recommit to offering freedom to in-
dividuals fleeing from persecution and op-
pression regardless of their country of origin 
or religious beliefs.

following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 485 
Whereas the goals of National Mentoring 
Month are to raise awareness of mentoring, 
recruit individuals to mentor, celebrate the 
powerful impact of caring adults who volun-
teer time for the benefit of young people, and 
encourage organizations to engage and inte-
grate quality in mentoring into the efforts of 
the organizations; 
Whereas there are young people across the 
United States who make everyday choices 
that lead to the big decisions in life without 
the guidance and support on which many 
other young people rely; 
Whereas a mentor is a caring, consistent 
presence who devotes time to a young person 
to help that young person discover personal 
strength and achieve the potential of that 
young person; 
Whereas quality mentoring encourages 
positive life and social skills, promotes self- 
esteem, bolsters academic achievement and 
college access, supports career exploration, 
and nurtures youth leadership development;

January 28, 2020 
Whereas mentoring happens in various set-
tings, including community-based programs, 
elementary and secondary schools, colleges, 
government agencies, religious institutions, 
and the workplace, and in various ways, in-
cluding formal mentoring matches and infor-
mal relationships with teachers, coaches, 
neighbors, faith leaders, and others; 
Whereas mentoring programs have been 
shown to be effective in helping young people 
make positive choices; 
Whereas studies have shown that incor-
porating culture and heritage into men-
toring programs can improve academic out-
comes and increases community engage-
ment, especially for Alaskan Native and 
American Indian youth; 
Whereas young people who meet regularly 
with mentors are 46 percent less likely than 
peers to start using illegal drugs; 
Whereas research shows that young people 
who were at risk for not completing high 
school but who had a mentor were, as com-
pared with similarly situated young people 
without a mentor— 
(1) 55 percent more likely to be enrolled in 
college; 
(2) 81 percent more likely to report partici-
pating regularly in sports or extracurricular 
activities; 
(3) more than twice as likely to say they 
held a leadership position in a club or sports 
team; and 
(4) 78 percent more likely to pay it forward 
by volunteering regularly in the commu-
nities of young people; 
Whereas students who are chronically ab-
sent are more likely to fall behind academi-
cally, and mentoring can play a role in help-
ing young people attend school regularly, as 
research shows that students who meet regu-
larly with a mentor are, as compared with 
the peers of those students— 
(1) 52 percent less likely to skip a full day 
of school; and 
(2) 37 percent less likely to skip a class; 
Whereas youth development experts agree 
that mentoring encourages positive youth 
development and smart daily behaviors, such 
as finishing homework and having healthy 
social interactions, and has a positive im-
pact on the growth and success of a young 
person; 
Whereas mentors help young people set ca-
reer goals and use the personal contacts of 
the mentors to help young people meet in-
dustry professionals and train for and find 
jobs; 
Whereas each of the benefits of mentors de-
scribed in this preamble serves to link youth 
to economic and social opportunity while 
also 
strengthening 
communities 
in 
the 
United States; and 
Whereas, despite those described benefits, 
an estimated 9,000,000 young people in the 
United States feel isolated from meaningful 
connections with adults outside the home, 
constituting a ‘‘mentoring gap’’ that dem-
onstrates a need for collaboration and re-
sources: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes January 2020 as ‘‘National 
Mentoring Month’’; 
(2) recognizes the caring adults who serve 
as staff and volunteers at quality mentoring 
programs and help the young people of the 
United States find inner strength and reach 
their full potential; 
(3) acknowledges that mentoring is bene-
ficial 
because 
mentoring 
supports 
edu-
cational achievement and self-confidence, 
supports young people in setting career goals 
and expanding social capital, reduces juve-
nile delinquency, improves positive personal, 
professional, and academic outcomes, and 
strengthens communities; 
(4) promotes the establishment and expan-
sion of quality mentoring programs across 
the United States to equip young people with 
the tools needed to lead healthy and produc-
tive lives; and 
(5) supports initiatives to close the ‘‘men-
toring gap’’ that exists for the many young 
people in the United States who do not have 
meaningful connections with adults outside 
the home.

Whereas the United States abolished the 
transatlantic slave trade in 1808 and abol-
ished chattel slavery and prohibited involun-
tary servitude in 1865; 
Whereas, because the people of the United 
States remain committed to protecting indi-
vidual freedom, there is a national impera-
tive to eliminate human trafficking and 
modern slavery, which is commonly consid-
ered to mean— 
(1) the recruitment, harboring, transpor-
tation, provision, or obtaining of an indi-
vidual through the use of force, fraud, or co-
ercion for the purpose of subjecting that in-
dividual to involuntary servitude, peonage, 
debt bondage, or slavery; or 
(2) the inducement of a commercial sex act 
by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the 
individual induced to perform that act is 
younger than 18 years of age; 
Whereas forced labor and human traf-
ficking generates revenues of approximately 
$150,000,000,000 annually worldwide, and there 
are an estimated 40,000,000 victims of human 
trafficking across the globe; 
Whereas victims of human trafficking are 
difficult to identify and are subject to ma-
nipulation, force, fraud, coercion, and abuse; 
Whereas the Department of Justice has re-
ported that human trafficking and modern 
slavery has been reported and investigated in 
each of the 50 States and the District of Co-
lumbia; 
Whereas the Department of State has re-
ported that the top 3 countries of origin of 
federally identified human trafficking vic-
tims in fiscal year 2018 were the United 
States, Mexico, and the Philippines; 
Whereas, to help businesses in the United 
States combat child labor and forced labor in 
global supply chains, the Department of 
Labor has identified 148 goods from 76 coun-
tries that are made by child labor and forced 
labor; 
Whereas, since 2007, the National Human 
Trafficking Hotline has identified nearly 
52,000 cases of human trafficking; 
Whereas, of the more than 23,500 endan-
gered runaways reported to the National 
Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 
2019, 1 in 6 were likely child sex trafficking 
victims; 
Whereas the Administration for Native 
Americans of the Department of Health and 
Human Services reports that American In-
dian, Alaska Native, and Pacific Islander 
women and girls have a heightened risk for 
sex trafficking; 
Whereas the Department of Justice found 
that studies on the topic of human traf-
ficking of American Indians and Alaska Na-
tives suggest there are— 
(1) high rates of sexual exploitation of Na-
tive women and girls; 
(2) gaps in data and research on trafficking 
of American Indian and Alaska Native vic-
tims; and 
(3) barriers that prevent law enforcement 
agencies and victim service providers from 
identifying and responding appropriately to 
Native victims; 
Whereas, according to the Government Ac-
countability Office, from fiscal year 2013 
through fiscal year 2016, there were only 14 
Federal investigations and 2 Federal pros-
ecutions of human trafficking offenses in In-
dian country; 
Whereas, to combat human trafficking and 
modern slavery in the United States and 
globally, the people of the United States, the 
Federal Government, and State and local 
governments must be— 
(1) aware of the realities of human traf-
ficking and modern slavery; and 
(2) dedicated to stopping the horrific enter-
prise of human trafficking and modern slav-
ery; 
Whereas the United States should hold ac-
countable all individuals, groups, organiza-
tions, and countries that support, advance, 
or commit acts of human trafficking and 
modern slavery; 
Whereas, through education, the United 
States must also work to end human traf-
ficking and modern slavery in all forms in 
the United States and around the world; 
Whereas victims of human trafficking de-
serve a trauma-informed approach that inte-
grates the pursuit of justice and provision of 
social services designed to help them escape, 
and recover from, the physical, mental, emo-
tional, and spiritual trauma they endured; 
Whereas combating human trafficking re-
quires a whole-of-government effort that 
rests on a unified and coordinated response 
among Federal, State, and local agencies and 
that places equal value on the identification 
and stabilization of victims, as well as the 
investigation and prosecution of traffickers; 
Whereas laws to prosecute perpetrators of 
human trafficking and to assist and protect 
victims of human trafficking and modern 
slavery have been enacted in the United 
States, including— 
(1) the Trafficking Victims Protection Act 
of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.); 
(2) title XII of the Violence Against Women 
Reauthorization Act of 2013 (Public Law 113– 
4; 127 Stat. 136); 
(3) the Justice for Victims of Trafficking 
Act of 2015 (Public Law 114–22; 129 Stat. 227); 
(4) sections 910 and 914(e) of the Trade Fa-
cilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 
(Public Law 114–125; 130 Stat. 239 and 274); 
(5) section 1298 of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (22 
U.S.C. 7114); 
(6) the Abolish Human Trafficking Act of 
2017 (Public Law 115–392; 132 Stat. 5250); 
(7) the Trafficking Victims Protection Act 
of 2017 (Public Law 115–393; 132 Stat. 5265); 
(8) the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Vic-
tims Prevention and Protection Reauthor-
ization Act of 2018 (Public Law 115–425; 132 
Stat. 5472); and 
(9) the Trafficking Victims Protection Re-
authorization Act of 2017 (Public Law 115–427; 
132 Stat. 5503); 
Whereas the Justice for Victims of Traf-
ficking Act of 2015 (Public Law 114–22; 129

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S643 
January 28, 2020 
Stat. 227) established the United States Ad-
visory Council on Human Trafficking to pro-
vide a formal platform for survivors of 
human trafficking to advise and make rec-
ommendations on Federal anti-trafficking 
policies to the Interagency Task Force to 
Monitor and Combat Trafficking established 
by the President; 
Whereas the Department of Defense, the 
General Services Administration, and the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion issued a final rule (80 Fed. Reg. 4967) to 
implement Executive Order 13627, entitled 
‘‘Strengthening Protections Against Traf-
ficking in Persons in Federal Contracts’’, 
that clarifies the policy of the United States 
on combating trafficking in persons as out-
lined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation 
by strengthening the prohibition on contrac-
tors from charging employee recruitment 
fees; 
Whereas, although such laws and regula-
tions are currently in force, it is essential to 
increase 
public 
awareness, 
particularly 
among individuals who are most likely to 
come into contact with victims of human 
trafficking and modern slavery, regarding 
conditions and dynamics of human traf-
ficking and modern slavery precisely because 
traffickers use techniques that are designed 
to severely limit self-reporting and evade 
law enforcement; 
Whereas January 1 is the anniversary of 
the effective date of the Emancipation Proc-
lamation; 
Whereas February 1 is— 
(1) the anniversary of the date on which 
President Abraham Lincoln signed the joint 
resolution sending the 13th Amendment to 
the Constitution of the United States to the 
States for ratification to forever declare, 
‘‘Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude 
. . . shall exist within the United States, or 
any place subject to their jurisdiction’’; and 
(2) a date that has long been celebrated as 
National Freedom Day, as described in sec-
tion 124 of title 36, United States Code; and 
Whereas, under the authority of Congress 
to enforce the 13th Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States ‘‘by appro-
priate legislation’’, Congress, through the 
Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 
(22 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.), updated the post-Civil 
War involuntary servitude and slavery stat-
utes and adopted an approach of victim pro-
tection, vigorous prosecution, and preven-
tion of human trafficking, commonly known 
as the ‘‘3P’’ approach: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate supports— 
(1) observing National Trafficking and 
Modern Slavery Prevention Month during 
the period beginning on January 1, 2020, and 
ending on February 1, 2020, to recognize the 
vital role that the people of the United 
States have in ending human trafficking and 
modern slavery; 
(2) marking the observation of National 
Trafficking and Modern Slavery Prevention 
Month with appropriate programs and activi-
ties, culminating in the observance on Feb-
ruary 1, 2020, of National Freedom Day, as 
described in section 124 of title 36, United 
States Code; 
(3) urging continued partnerships with 
Federal, State, and local agencies, as well as 
social service providers and nonprofit orga-
nizations to address human trafficking with 
a collaborative, victim-centered approach; 
and 
(4) all other efforts to prevent, eradicate, 
and raise awareness of, and opposition to, 
human trafficking and modern slavery.

THE 
HARM 
CAUSED BY INTERNATIONAL PA-
RENTAL CHILD ABDUCTION

Mr. 
MCCONNELL, 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Mr. CRAPO, Ms. HARRIS, 
Mr. RUBIO, Mr. BOOKER, Mr. CORNYN, 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR, and Mr. MARKEY) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 487 
Whereas thousands of children in the 
United States have been abducted from the 
United States by parents, separating those 
children from their parents who remain in 
the United States; 
Whereas it is illegal under section 1204 of 
title 18, United States Code, to remove, or 
attempt to remove, a child from the United 
States or retain a child (who has been in the 
United States) outside of the United States 
with the intent to obstruct the lawful exer-
cise of parental rights; 
Whereas more than 11,500 children were re-
ported abducted from the United States be-
tween 2008 and 2018; 
Whereas, during 2018, 1 or more cases of 
international parental child abduction in-
volving children who are citizens of the 
United States were identified in 107 coun-
tries around the world; 
Whereas the United States is a party to the 
Convention on the Civil Aspects of Inter-
national Child Abduction, done at The 
Hague, October 25, 1980 (TIAS 11670) (referred 
to in this preamble as the ‘‘Hague Conven-
tion on Abduction’’), which— 
(1) supports the prompt return of wrongly 
removed or retained children; and 
(2) calls for all participating parties to re-
spect parental custody rights; 
Whereas the majority of children who were 
abducted from the United States have yet to 
be reunited with their custodial parents; 
Whereas, during 2018, Argentina, Brazil, 
Ecuador, Egypt, India, Jordan, Lebanon, 
Peru, and the United Arab Emirates were 
identified under the Sean and David Gold-
man International Child Abduction Preven-
tion and Return Act of 2014 (22 U.S.C. 9101 et 
seq.) as engaging in a pattern of noncompli-
ance (as defined in section 3 of that Act (22 
U.S.C. 9101)); 
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United 
States has recognized that family abduc-
tion— 
(1) is a form of child abuse with potentially 
‘‘devastating consequences for a child’’, 
which may include negative impacts on the 
physical and mental well-being of the child; 
and 
(2) can cause a child to ‘‘experience a loss 
of community and stability, leading to lone-
liness, anger, and fear of abandonment’’; 
Whereas, according to the 2010 Report on 
Compliance with the Hague Convention on 
the Civil Aspects of International Child Ab-
duction by the Department of State, re-
search shows that an abducted child is at 
risk of significant short- and long-term prob-
lems, including ‘‘anxiety, eating problems, 
nightmares, mood swings, sleep disturb-
ances, [and] aggressive behavior’’; 
Whereas international parental child ab-
duction has devastating emotional con-
sequences for the child and for the parent 
from whom the child is separated; 
Whereas the United States has a history of 
promoting child welfare through institutions 
including— 
(1) in the Department of Health and 
Human Services, the Children’s Bureau of 
the Administration for Children and Fami-
lies; and 
(2) in the Department of State, the Office 
of Children’s Issues of the Bureau of Con-
sular Affairs; 
Whereas Congress has signaled a commit-
ment to ending international parental child 
abduction by enacting the International 
Child Abduction Remedies Act (22 U.S.C. 9001 
et seq.), the International Parental Kidnap-
ping Crime Act of 1993 (Public Law 103–173), 
which enacted section 1204 of title 18, United 
States Code, and the Sean and David Gold-
man International Child Abduction Preven-
tion and Return Act of 2014 (22 U.S.C. 9101 et 
seq.); 
Whereas the Senate adopted Senate Reso-
lution 543, 112th Congress, on December 4, 
2012, condemning the international abduc-
tion of children; 
Whereas the Senate adopted Senate Reso-
lution 431, 115th Congress, on April 19, 2018, 
to raise awareness of, and opposition to, 
international parental child abduction; 
Whereas all 50 States and the District of 
Columbia have enacted laws criminalizing 
parental kidnapping; 
Whereas, in 2018, the Prevention Branch of 
the Office of Children’s Issues of the Depart-
ment of State— 
(1) fielded more than 5,200 inquiries from 
the general public relating to preventing a 
child from being removed from the United 
States; and 
(2) enrolled more than 4,700 children in the 
Children’s Passport Issuance Alert Program, 
which— 
(A) is one of the most important tools of 
the Department of State for preventing 
international parental child abductions; 
and 
(B) allows the Office of Children’s Issues 
to contact the enrolling parent or legal 
guardian to verify whether the parental 
consent requirement has been met when a 
passport application has been submitted 
for an enrolled child; 
Whereas the Department of State cannot 
track the ultimate destination of a child 
through the use of the passport of the child 
issued by the Department of State if the 
child is transported to a third country after 
departing from the United States; 
Whereas a child who is a citizen of the 
United States may have another nationality 
and may travel using a passport issued by 
another country, which— 
(1) increases the difficulty in determining 
the whereabouts of the child; and 
(2) makes efforts to prevent abductions 
more critical; 
Whereas, during 2018, 232 children were re-
turned to the United States and an addi-
tional 174 cases were resolved in other ways; 
and 
Whereas, in 2018, the Department of Home-
land Security, in coordination with the Pre-
vention Branch of the Office of Children’s 
Issues of the Department of State, enrolled 
236 children in a program aimed at pre-
venting international parental child abduc-
tion: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes and observes ‘‘Countering 
International 
Parental 
Child 
Abduction 
Month’’ during the period beginning on April 
1, 2020, and ending on April 30, 2020, to raise 
awareness of, and opposition to, inter-
national parental child abduction; and

IN REMEMBRANCE OF CHRIS 
ALLEN 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
offer my condolences to the family and friends 
of Chris Allen, a valued member of the Senate 
Finance Committee staff. Chris was a leader 
on an issue that is of particular importance to 
me, retirement security. Chris will always be 
remembered for his tireless work ensuring the 
solvency of the pensions of thousands of 
workers in multiemployer pensions—and his 
leadership in making it easier for Americans to 
save for retirement in the SECURE Act. 
An alum of Loyola College in Maryland and 
Johns Hopkins University, he worked on pen-
sion and benefit issues and exempt organiza-
tion issues for the Senate Finance Committee, 
under both Chairmen CHUCK GRASSLEY and 
Orrin Hatch. Before he joined the Finance 
Committee, he worked as a senior economic 
policy adviser for Senator PAT ROBERTS. And 
before that, he worked as a consultant and 
advisor for various groups, including the Fi-
nancial Accounting Foundation and the Na-
tional Association of State Treasurers. 
Widely known and widely liked, Chris will be 
remembered for his dedication, his passion, 
his candor and his sense of humor. His was 
a warm presence that lightened the tone of 
meetings and briefings. And he worked hard 
for what he believed in. 
Not just widely known and widely liked, 
Chris will also be widely missed. We hold in 
our hearts those closest to Chris, especially 
his wife Lynda, his daughters Sophie and 
Lucie, and the rest of his family and friends. 
I send my deepest sympathies to the Allen 
family, to his friends, and to Senator GRASS-
LEY and to our other colleagues in the Senate, 
and I ask my colleagues to do the same.

HONORING DYLAN COOK 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Dylan Cook. 
Dylan is a very special young man who has 
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship 
and leadership by taking an active part in the 
Boy Scouts of America, Troop 135, and earn-
ing the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Dylan has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Dylan has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Dylan 
has contributed to his community through his 
Eagle Scout project. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Dylan Cook for his accom-
plishments with the Boy Scouts of America 
and for his efforts put forth in achieving the 
highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

RECOGNIZING FRANK AND 
BELINDA VANDERSLOOT 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and congratulate Frank and Be-
linda VanderSloot for receiving the 2020 
Alturas Institute John and Abigail Adams 
Award in recognition of their commitment to 
service and equal protection under the law. 
Frank and Belinda VanderSloot have dedi-
cated their time, talents and treasures to the 
betterment of our world. 
When disaster strikes and the world won-
ders what can be done, the VanderSloots act. 
Donated trucks, planes, and cargo ships 
stocked with lifesaving supplies act as an an-
swer to prayers for those whose lives have 
been turned upside down by natural disaster. 
Thanks to their incredible partnership with 
the American Red Cross and the Salvation 
Army countless lives have been blessed and 
lives have literally been saved. 
The list of their philanthropy is lengthy, from 
sponsoring an orphanage in Ecuador or the 
renovation and donation of a school in Idaho 
Falls. Family farms have been saved, busi-
ness have flourished, and scholarships grant-
ed all because the VanderSloots choose to 
act. 
Most recently Frank and Belinda have 
added to their legacy assisting hundreds of 
people who find themselves in the jaws of 
overly aggressive medical debt collectors. In 
establishing a one-million-dollar defense fund, 
they have given a voice to the voiceless. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Frank 
and 
Belinda 
VanderSloot give because of the goodness of 
their hearts, not for applause or accolades; 
which is why I stand today to congratulate 
them on receiving the 2020 Alturas Institute 
John and Abigail Adams Award and to thank 
them for ‘enhancing lives and doing good 
where good is needed’.

COMMERCE 
CHAMBER 
FAMILY AWARD 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dominic & Adi Wade for receiv-
ing the Fulton Montgomery Regional Chamber 
of Commerce Chamber Family Award. 
Dominic and Adi Wade, builders of Amster-
dam’s new shopping plaza, Southside Square, 
have created a wonderful selection of busi-
nesses near the Route 5 corridor. The Square 
now includes a range of small and medium 
size businesses that greatly benefit the sur-
rounding area. These businesses include 
Pleasant Cleaners, Southside Beverage, Bour-
bon Street Wine and Liquor, and DomAdi’s 
Deli. Dominic and Adi Wade established Bour-
bon Street and DomAdi’s Deli themselves, 
both of which are thriving under their great 
leadership. The availability of adequate com-
mercial real estate is vital to the economic 
wellbeing of a community, and the North 
Country has greatly benefited from the Wade’s 
contributions. 
Dominic and Adi Wade have made a lasting 
positive impact on the vitality of their commu-
nity, providing much needed investment to the 
area. On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I 
would like to congratulate the Wade Family for 
this well-deserved recognition. I look forward 
to their future success.

REMEMBERING THE LEGACY OF 
COACH MARC STRINGER 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to remember the incredible legacy of 
Coach Marc Stringer of White Hall, Arkansas. 
A longtime coach of basketball and football at 
White Hall High School, Mr. Stringer lost his 
battle with cancer several days ago. 
Coach Stringer and his family have been 
longtime residents of Arkansas’ Fourth District, 
and their story serves as a testimony of serv-
ice to our fellow man and of dedication to see-
ing future generations succeed. 
Coach Stringer coached for nine years, bat-
tling cancer for the last three. According to the 
faculty and students of White Hall School Dis-
trict, Coach Stringer was a ‘‘good coach, but 
an even better person.’’ His dedication to stu-
dents showed not only in his coaching ability, 
but also in his creation of Endure the Dirt Ad-
venture Race and Personal Pep Rally, which 
awards scholarships to students whose fami-
lies are facing a battle with cancer. 
Coach Stringer was also awarded the Norm 
Stewart Legacy Award in 2018 at the Coaches 
vs. Cancer Program and the Arkansas Basket-
ball 
Coaches 
Association 
PGC 
Trans-
formational Coach Award for his perseverance 
throughout his health struggles. 
I’m honored to recognize Coach Stringer’s 
servant leadership and his legacy of endur-
ance in adversity. My prayers are with his 
family as they mourn his loss.

HONORING DALTON SCOTT RIPLEY 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Dalton Scott Rip-
ley. Dalton is a very special young man who 
has exemplified the finest qualities of citizen-
ship and leadership by taking an active part in 
the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 120, and 
earning the most prestigious award of Eagle 
Scout. 
Dalton has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Dalton has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, Dal-
ton has contributed to his community through 
his Eagle Scout project. Dalton raised the 
funds and placed a granite bench in the Vet-
erans Memorial Plaza at the Livingston County 
Courthouse. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Dalton Scott Ripley for his 
accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of 
America and for his efforts put forth in achiev-
ing the highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

ADVANCING RESEARCH TO 
PREVENT SUICIDE ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 4704, which advances the 
knowledge and understanding of issues that 
may be associated with several aspects of sui-
cide, including intrinsic and extrinsic factors re-
lated to wellbeing, resilience, and vulnerability. 
The bill directs the National Science Foun-
dation (NSF) to provide for additional multi-
disciplinary research on the science of suicide. 
The fundamental research done by the NSF 
includes but is not limited to basic under-
standing of human social behavior, the neutral 
basis of human cognition, the basic under-
standing of cognitive, linguistic, social, cultural 
and biological processes related to human de-
velopment across the lifespan, the basic un-
derstanding of perceptual, motor, and cog-
nitive process, and their interaction in typical 
human behavior; and the basic understanding 
of the relevance of drug and alcohol abuse. 
The rate of Americans dying by suicide is 
on the rise, increasing from 10.7 to 14 deaths 
per 100,000 people from 2001 to 2017. 
In the UK, the rate of death by suicide per 
100,000 people is 11.2, in Canada, 11.3, and 
in Japan, 14.3. 
In 2019, the number of deaths per 100,000 
people by suicide in Texas was 13.8, which is 
relatively high compared to the national high 
of 14. 
Suicide among seniors over the age of 85 in 
Texas is the highest, with a rate of 19.2 
deaths per 100,000 people. 
In 2017, there were an estimated 1.4 million 
suicide attempts and more than 47,000 deaths 
by suicide nationwide. 
Currently, suicide is the tenth-leading cause 
of death among people in the United States 
and the second-leading cause of death for 
young people between the ages of 15 and 34. 
Societal costs including lifetime medical 
care and lost work costs associated with sui-
cide are estimated at $70 billion. 
Ninety percent of all people who died by 
suicide in Harris County were suffering from a 
mental illness at the time, most often depres-
sion. 
The NSF funds will support research that 
can improve our basic understanding of fac-
tors with potential relevance to suicide, includ-
ing prevention and treatment. 
The rate of suicide is far too high in the 
United States and we must be more aware of 
the issue in order to take preventative action. 
I ask my colleagues from both sides of the 
aisle to join me in voting in support of H.R. 
4704.

RECOGNIZING DR. THERESA 
FLOYD, PH.D. 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
Black History Month, I rise today in recognition 
of Dr. Theresa Floyd, an African American 
Pioneer and outstanding constituent, who has 
devoted her life to promoting the importance 
of faith, family and community in our district. 
As an educator, mentor, dedicated volun-
teer, wife of 54 years, and a mom to seven 
kids, Dr. Floyd has worn many important hats 
in our community. Her strong faith-based foun-
dation can be attributed to her time at Jack-
sonville Theological Seminary, where she 
earned her Bachelor’s, Master’s and Doctoral 
degrees. During her education, she served as 
a role model and counselor for many students 
who went on to graduate and give back to our 
community. 
Dr. Floyd founded the New Hope Pente-
costal Church in Orange Park Florida, where 
she served the church in many capacities 
such as Executive Administrator, Board Mem-
ber, Evangelist, Deaconess and even Choir 
Director. Her leadership in Orange Park was 
well regarded by her peers, eventually serving 
as a town councilmember, school counselor, 
teacher, and canvassing board member. Ulti-
mately, she and her family were recognized as 
the Most Outstanding Black Family in the 
Town of Orange Park. 
Currently Dr. Floyd acts as Pastor and Chief 
Executive of Faith and Deliverance Ministry in 
Vero Beach. In her role, she provides 
mentorship and guidance to those suffering 
from addiction, and helps those who need 
food and shelter. A true humanitarian, she is 
always putting others before herself. 
The contributions that Dr. Floyd has made 
to Indian River County are immeasurable and 
will be felt for generations to come. We are 
grateful to her for her spiritual works and un-
wavering altruism, that have made the Treas-
ure Coast a better place for all families to 
enjoy. 
On Tuesday, February 18th, 2020, the In-
dian River County Board of Commissioners 
will honor Dr. Floyd’s service to our commu-
nity in celebration of Black History Month. The 
Board is dedicated to celebrating African 
American pioneers in the community such as 
Dr. Floyd, who have paved the way for future 
generations. 
I ask my colleagues of the U.S. House of 
Representatives to join me in recognizing Dr. 
Floyd’s service to residents and families 
across our district, and her continued devotion 
to making our community a better place.

HONORING CITY OF COACHELLA 
FIRE 
DEPARTMENT 
CAPTAIN 
MARCOS MACHUCA 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
my constituent, City of Coachella Fire Depart-
ment Captain Marcos Machuca, for his years 
of service to California’s 36th Congressional 
District. After 42 years of exceptional service 
to our communities, Captain Machuca retired 
on November 30, 2019. 
Captain Machuca fulfilled his childhood 
dream to serve his community when he joined 
the City of Coachella Fire Department in 1977. 
Over his decades’ long career, he accumu-
lated a wealth of leadership experience and 
made a difference in the lives of our friends, 
families, and neighbors. 
Every day, Captain Machuca answered the 
call to defend our community. For example, 
when a semi-tractor caught fire in Oasis, he 
rescued the driver from his truck before it en-
gulfed in flames. This is just one instance of 
how Captain Machuca’s bravery saved a life 
and prevented tragedy. 
Captain Machuca is more than a coura-
geous first responder—he is also a skilled ed-
ucator. As Fire Captain, he has instilled valu-
able lessons in the young firefighters he 
mentored, and he played a key role in growing 
Coachella’s volunteer force. 
As a two-time recipient of the Firefighter of 
the Year award, Captain Machuca exemplifies 
the qualities of our community’s firefighters 
who work tirelessly to keep us safe. His self-
lessness, courage, and dedication to public 
service are inspiring, and his legacy will be felt 
in Coachella for years to come. 
On behalf of our entire community, I thank 
Captain Machuca for his exceptional service 
and congratulate him on his well-deserved re-
tirement.

DAIRY FOR RECEIVING THE NEW

NEXT 
GENERATION 
FARMER AWARD 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Hanehan Family Dairy for re-
ceiving the New York State Agricultural Soci-
ety’s Next Generation Farmer Award. The 
NYS Agricultural Society honors established 
producers and industry newcomers who are 
farming in new and vibrant ways with the Next 
Generation Farmer Award. For NY agriculture 
to continue to be successful, the next genera-
tion of innovative farmers are needed to work 
the land, plant crops, raise livestock and feed 
our global population. The Hanehan family has 
diversified their business to remain competi-
tive, while continuing their tradition and pass-
ing their successful business onto the next 
generation. 
Hanehan Family Dairy maintains two farms 
in Mount Upton and Saratoga Springs. Upon 
returning from service in World War II, Edward 
Hanehan purchased the farm next door to the 
one that he grew up on. Today, his descend-
ants include his three sons, 11 grandchildren 
and 19 great-grandchildren. Edward’s sons, 
Charlie, Cliff, and Dave, currently run both 
farms and several of their children are working 
their way into the family business as partners, 
carrying on the agricultural tradition. In addi-
tion to their core business of dairy, they also 
breed livestock and grow pumpkins, raising 
around eight acres at each farm. 
Agriculture is an essential component of the 
economy in Northern New York and Hanehan 
Family Dairy exemplifies the quality and diver-
sity of North Country farms. On behalf of New 
York’s 21st district, I would like to congratulate 
the entire Hanehan family for this well-de-
served recognition. I look forward to their fu-
ture success. 
SUPPORTING VETERANS IN STEM 
CAREERS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the House Judiciary Com-
mittee and the Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity, I rise in strong support of S. 153, the 
‘‘Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act.’’ 
It is with the great sacrifice of the men and 
women, who have served in our armed forces 
and protected our freedom in mind that I urge 
members on both sides of the aisle to vote in 
favor this bill. 
We often hear about the many difficulties 
veterans face while attempting to transition 
back to civilian life. 
From physical and mental trauma to unem-
ployment to the struggles associated with re-
familiarizing themselves with civilian life, vet-
erans face many obstacles in life after service. 
With respect to employment, nearly one- 
third of veteran job seekers are under-
employed, which is 15.6 percent higher than 
non-veteran job seekers. 
In addition, the Texas Workforce Investment 
Council reported that in 2017, 35,734 veterans 
remained unemployed. 
In 2019, LinkedIn published its Veteran’s 
Opportunity Report, which stated that veterans 
who had degrees as well as four or more 
years of experience were less likely to land 
the job than less-experienced civilians who ap-
plied for the same role. 
I am voting in favor of S. 153 because it 
seeks to address that barrier by encouraging 
veterans to study and pursue rewarding ca-
reers in science, technology, engineering, and 
math as well as by creating an interagency 
working group. 
This group is tasked with coordinating fed-
eral programs for transitioning and training 
veterans for STEM careers. 
By facilitating this process, veterans will be 
able to have a meaningful career that utilizes 
their skillsets and secures their livelihood. 
In addition, S. 153 will result in filling thou-
sands of open positions and contribute to 
growing our economy. 
Today, STEM careers are growing at an un-
precedented rate. 
Texas is home to more than three-quarters 
of a million great STEM jobs. 
In fact, Texas is expected to represent near-
ly 10 percent of future STEM opportunities in 
the nation. 
According to a study by Syracuse University 
in 2018, Texas possesses the largest percent-
ages of veterans working in the STEM work-
force. 
At the state-level, 9 percent of veterans 
work in STEM. 
Yet, the report states that 18.66 percent of 
veterans in Houston are employed in STEM. 
Throughout my tenure In Congress, I have 
strongly supported veterans. 
With that in mind, I authored and introduced 
the ‘‘Helping to Encourage Real Opportunity 
for Veterans Transitioning from Battlespace to 
Workplace Act’’, or the HEROES Act, in pre-
vious congresses. 
Through my advocacy work with veterans, I 
have come to understand that one of the 
greatest barriers to entry for veterans seeking 
employment is that civilian employers do not 
adequately understand how the skills, experi-
ence, and training of veterans can contribute 
in the private sector. 
In an effort to address this problem, the HE-
ROES Act creates a Military Skills Translator 
Database to remove that obstacle and better 
incorporate veterans into the workforce, espe-
cially in fields like STEM. 
I strongly believe that we must come to-
gether and address the barriers that prevent 
veterans from re-entering the workforce. 
It is imperative that we, the American peo-
ple, continuously recognize the sacrifices 
these men and women have made to ensure 
our freedom and safety. 
We must take it upon ourselves to try and 
ease the burdensome transition that thou-
sands of veterans’ experience. 
And so, I ask all members from both parties 
to join me in voting to pass S. 153.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E92 
January 28, 2020 
Petra Ruiz was an organizer, activist, and 
leader who used her life to stand up for 
farmworking women across California. 
As the son of farmworkers in the eastern 
Coachella Valley, I am all too familiar with the 
social, economic, and political hardships the 
farmworking community faces on a daily basis. 
The struggles can often be so great that you 
have to have someone or something to look to 
for inspiration. For me, and for so many of us 
in the Coachella Valley, Petra Ruiz was one 
such inspiration. 
Petra was a fierce and loving leader who 
was held in high esteem, even by the people 
who didn’t agree with what she had to say. 
But it was hard not to agree with what she 
had to say. You see, Petra believed in helping 
farmworking women across California advo-
cate for themselves, for their families, and for 
their communities in the struggle for equality 
and their basic human rights. 
Petra got involved in the union movement in 
the 1970s and was a warrior for justice and 
equality within the farmworking community 
through her final days. 
A phrase that I have heard repeatedly in 
talking with members of the community and 
with her family is ‘‘she was always there.’’ 
Petra was always there. 
Even as a mother and a grandmother to a 
big family, she worked with the United Farm 
Workers of America to advocate for the rights 
of the farmworker community. Petra led 
marches; she attended meetings; she would 
even go door-to-door with flyers making sure 
that farmworkers knew their rights. 
Petra was a remarkable woman, revered, 
admired, a mover and shaker, an effective 
leader who led with her actions as much as 
she did by her words. She inspired me to 
never say no to my dreams, to pursue justice 
at every turn, and to always believe I could 
make a difference. 
Madam Speaker, while she is missed dear-
ly, Petra’s legacy didn’t end with her passing. 
Her impact is felt today and will continue in 
the lives of generations to come.

Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Ken Armstrong for his 
years of dedicated service to the Boy Scouts 
of America, specifically Troop ONE in Hot 
Springs, Arkansas. 
First Presbyterian Church of Hot Springs 
chartered Troop ONE in 1923, making it the

State of Arkansas. Mr. Armstrong’s own ca-
reer with Troop ONE began in 1994 and con-
tinued for another 25 years after he was 
named Scoutmaster for the troop in 1998. He 
will be retiring on February 9, 2020 after 21 
years as the Scoutmaster for Troop ONE. 
With more than 40 years of service as both 
a youth scout and as a Scoutmaster in Arkan-
sas and Texas, Mr. Armstrong was also 
awarded the Silver Beaver Award last year in 
recognition of his lifelong service in leadership. 
He remains a respected mentor and resource 
to countless young people in the Fourth Dis-

NEVER AGAIN EDUCATION ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 27, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 943, ‘‘Never Again Edu-
cation Act,’’ which requires the creation of the 
Holocaust 
Education 
Assistance 
Program 
Fund for the Department of Education. 
The fund will award grants to qualified enti-
ties to implement Holocaust education pro-
grams and host a series of regional work-
shops to provide teachers with assistance on 
how to incorporate Holocaust education into 
standard teaching while meeting state and 
local education requirements. 
The establishment of the Holocaust Edu-
cation Advisory Board to prepare application 
criteria for grant recipients, and the formulation 
of the Holocaust education program website 
will allow for a regulated, definitive introduction 
of this curriculum. 
Holocaust Remembrance Day, January 27, 
is an international memorial day that marks 
the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death 
camps in January 1945. 
In addition to the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp, 
we must also remember the victims of the 
Belzec, 
Bergen-Belsen, 
Buchenwald, 
Chelmno, 
Dachau, 
Dora-Mittelbau, 
Flossenburg, 
Gross-Rosen, 
Janowska, 
Kaiserwald, Majdanek, Mauthasen, Natzweiler- 
Struthof, 
Neuengamme, 
Oranienburg, 
Plaszow, 
Ravensbruck, 
Sachsenhausen, 
Sobibor, Stutthof, Terezin, Treblinka and 
Westerbork concentration camps. 
The United States Holocaust Memorial Mu-
seum states that the extermination by the Nazi 
regime and its allies led to the deaths of 6 mil-
lion Jews. 
In addition to the millions of deaths within 
the Jewish community, the Third Reich sepa-
rately targeted and murdered many other com-
munities and ethnic groups, some estimates 
range from an additional 3 million to 11 million 
deaths. 
These deaths include members of the 
LGBTQ community, the physically and men-
tally disabled, Freemasons, Jehovah’s Wit-
nesses, the Romani, Poles, Serbians, Spanish 
Republicans, members of the Soviet Union, 
Soviet Prisoners of War, people of Slavic de-
scent, Germans of African descent, Com-
munists, Socialists and more. 
After Adolf Hitler’s invasion of Poland on 
September 1, 1939, France and Britain de-
clared war on Germany, officially beginning 
World War II. 
World War II lasted from 1939 to 1945 and 
caused about 75 million deaths, including 
members of the military and civilians, around 
3 percent of the world’s population at the time. 
Almost 75 years have passed since the end 
of World War II, but the aftermath is still a re-
minder of a brutal and merciless era of history

where racism and prejudice were unleashed 
on a grand scale seeking to quench the rights 
of man. 
The United States Holocaust Memorial Mu-
seum reports that its Registry of Holocaust 
Survivors currently contains the names of over 
195,000 survivors and family members. 
In 1981, Holocaust survivor and Houston 
resident Siegi Izakson had the inspiration to 
create an education center and memorial to 
preserve the memory of those who perished, 
the stories of those who survived and to edu-
cate the public about the threats of prejudice 
and hatred in society. 
Thanks to Siegi Izakson’s tireless dedica-
tion, the Holocaust Museum Houston opened 
on March 3, 1996 and is fully bilingual in 
English and Spanish, contains a welcome cen-
ter, multiple galleries, a research library, in-
door theater, outdoor amphitheater and inter-
active terminals with doors open to 130,000 
visitors per year. 
In the United States, there are over 50 Hol-
ocaust museums and memorials dedicated to 
educating people about the dangers of hatred 
and genocide, protecting democratic values 
and preventing antisemitism. 
In June 2019, Texas enacted S. Bill 1828, 
requiring that Texas schools include age ap-
propriate instruction concerning the Holocaust 
for grades kindergarten through 12. 
The Texas Holocaust and Genocide Com-
mission has worked with Texas government 
agencies to adopt new educational standards 
that approach the Holocaust, genocide and 
mass murders. 
Texas students will learn about these topics 
in their World Geography Studies, World His-
tory Studies, and United States History Stud-
ies Since 1877 courses. 
I support this bill because it will enhance the 
quality of our students’ education and provide 
them with an authentic understanding of this 
dark and complex chapter in world history. 
The creation of the Holocaust Education As-
sistance Program Fund for the Department of 
Education will only improve the knowledge 
provided to our children. 
The Holocaust Education Assistance Pro-
gram Fund for the Department of Education 
will award grants to eligible entities to create 
Holocaust education program and conduct 
workshops with teachers on how to include 
this information along with students’ normal 
educational programs. 
The Department of Education will maintain a 
Holocaust education program website with re-
sources for middle and high school students, 
establish the Holocaust Education Advisory 
Board to develop criteria for the fund’s grants, 
and decide on content for the Holocaust edu-
cation program website and lead efforts to 
promote donations for the fund. 
The Holocaust requires us to remember the 
magnitude with which antisemitism, racism, 
Nazism and fascism destroyed millions of 
lives, as well as consider the consequences of 
apathy and passivity. 
I ask my colleagues from both sides of the 
aisle to vote in support of H.R. 943.

BIRTHDAY OF DOUGLAS DILLARD 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN

Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of Mr. Douglas Dillard, a long-time resi-
dent of Detroit, Michigan, who celebrates his 
seventy-fifth birthday this year. 
Mr. Dillard was born February 2, 1945, the 
second of seven children born to the late 
Christopher and Virginia Dillard. He is proud 
graduate of historical Detroit Northwestern 
High School, class of 1963. Mr. Dillard earned 
a Computer Science and Industrial Manage-
ment degree from Detroit Institute of Tech-
nology. 
After graduating, Mr. Dillard worked as a de-
signer for Ford Motor Company Body Engi-
neering, a career that spanned twenty-seven 
years. In his free time, Mr. Dillard was an en-
thusiastic softball player. He garnered numer-
ous awards, including many All Stars and 
Most Valuable Player awards. Mr. Dillard has 
also participated in the Huntsman World Sen-
ior Games and has been inducted into its Hall 
of Fame. He currently operates Gray Street 
Housing. He enjoys his time spent with his 
wife Gloria and their three grown children. 
Please join me in celebrating Mr. Douglas 
Dillard’s seventy-fifth birthday.

RECOGNIZING 
INTERNATIONAL 
HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY 
2020 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the International Day 
of Remembrance of the Holocaust. The United 
Nations General Assembly designated Janu-
ary 27 as this remembrance day to inspire re-
flection on the events that led to the execution 
of more than six million Jews and countless 
other oppressed communities. 
This year marks the 75th anniversary of the 
liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi 
death camp, which I visited in August 2018. 
This complex is most notorious for its horrific 
death toll, resulting in more than 1.1 million 
deaths in its few years of operation. To de-
scribe the inhumanity observed in Auschwitz 
and other camps, holocaust survivor Lilly 
Appelbaum Malnik stated the following: 
‘‘And they said, ‘From now on you do not 
answer by your name. Your name is your 
number.’ And the delusion, the disappoint-
ment, the discouragement that I felt, I felt like 
I was not a human person anymore.’’ 
We must never forget the victims of the Hol-
ocaust and never cease working towards a 
more just society. Within 25 years, it is likely 
no Holocaust survivor will be alive to account 
for the events carried out in extermination 
camps. According to a 2018 survey commis-
sioned by the Conference on Jewish Material 
Claims Against Germany, 41 percent of Amer-
ican adults do not know about Auschwitz. With 
hate crimes reaching a 16-year high in 2018, 
it is imperative that we recount the atrocities of 
the Holocaust, lest discrimination based on 
race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, 
ethnicity, gender, or gender identity continue 
to spread. 
Madam Speaker, people throughout the 
world are coming together to commemorate 
the more than six million lives lost during the 
Holocaust. We stand in solidarity with the 
United Nations in remembering these victims 
and honoring those who defend human rights. 
We must always be vigilant that this horror of 
humanity is never repeated.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF IAN MCBETH 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, today I wish 
to honor the life and service of Mr. Ian 
McBeth, a Colorado-born firefighter who was 
killed in a helicopter crash in Australia this 
month. Mr. McBeth went to Australia as a vol-
unteer assisting in fighting that nation’s dev-
astating wildfires. 
Born and raised in Wray, Colorado, Mr. 
McBeth served in the Wyoming Air National 
Guard while a student at the University of Wy-
oming and later joined the Air National Guard 
in Montana. His service included tours in Iraq 
and Afghanistan. He is survived by his wife 
and three children. 
Coloradans and Americans throughout the 
West know all too well the great cost wildfires 
have on life, land, and our environment. These 
devastating impacts are curtailed only through 
the enormous sacrifice and bravery of the men 
and women who set aside their personal safe-
ty to run toward the blaze with the goal of sav-
ing their neighbors and communities. We are 
endlessly indebted to all those who rise to 
serve these dire needs, and particularly those 
who give their lives in these fights. 
I send my deepest condolences to Mr. 
McBeth’s family, friends, and all those who 
were impacted by his loss. We thank Mr. 
McBeth for his many years of service for our 
nation.

and memory of Kenneth C. Ryken, who re-
cently passed away. 
Ken was born in Walnut Creek, California 
on April 27, 1965, to proud parents Richard 
and Deanna Ryken. He grew up in the East 
Bay where he attended and graduated from 
Hayward High School in 1983. Upon grad-
uating from high school, Ken went on to study 
at Chabot College, San Francisco State Uni-
versity, and the University of Southern Cali-
fornia, where he received his law degree. 
After graduating law school, Ken began 
practicing law with Sedgwick LLP, and in 1996 
he joined the Alameda County District Attor-
ney’s office where I had the privilege of having 
him as a colleague. Ken served as the office’s 
finance director and an assistant district attor-
ney until his passing on January 5, 2020. Ken 
was frequently described as a ‘‘rock’’ and a 
‘‘shining star’’ by his colleagues and superiors. 
One of the accomplishments Ken was most 
proud of during his career was the creation of 
Clean Slate Services in collaboration with the 
East Bay Community Law Center. This prac-
tice helps reduce the pathways into the crimi-
nal justice system and removes barriers to 
employment and civic participation for people 
with criminal records. Ken’s work was pivotal 
to the creation of this program, and it is only 
one of the many highlights of his career. 
Ken’s commitment to public service and his 
community extended beyond working for the 
Alameda County District Attorney’s Office. Ken 
was a proud member of the 100 Club and the 
Hayward Rotary Club, and he served on the 
board of directors for the Hayward Area His-
torical Society. Outside of work Ken was 
known to be a music enthusiast who espe-
cially loved his bass guitar. 
We lost Ken far too soon. He is survived by 
his wife of 17 years, Jean Luevano, as well as 
his children, Jackson and Lauren, grandson, 
Wesley, parents, Dick and Deanna, and sib-
lings, Tim and Kathy. Ken loved spending time 
with his family and was always a proud hus-
band, father, and grandfather. His legacy will 
live on through them and the everlasting im-
pact he made on our community.

JIM LEHRER 
HON. MICHAEL CLOUD 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, today, I pay 
tribute to Mr. Jim Lehrer who passed away at 
the age of 85 last week. 
Mr. Lehrer is dear to Texas’ 27th district be-
cause he graduated from Victoria College, 
right in my hometown of Victoria, Texas, in 
1956. 
As a student, he wrote for the college 
paper, the Jolly Roger, and worked as a ticket 
agent at the Continental Trailways station 
downtown. 
Today a plaque near the bus station he 
worked at 65 years ago honors his accom-
plishments. 
After college, he sacrificially served our 
country for three years with the United States 
Marines. 
He then went on to the Dallas Morning 
News, reporting on local politics before making 
the change to television. 
He never forgot his Texas roots, despite the 
fact that he went on to have a distinguished 
career as a world-renowned journalist. 
Over the span of his lifetime, he moderated 
twelve presidential debates, cofounded and 
hosted PBS NewsHour for 36 years, and au-
thored numerous books. 
Through much hard work and determination, 
he achieved great success as a journalist, and 
we are proud that he called Victoria home for 
a little while. 
He is survived by his wife of six decades, 
Kate, three daughters, Jamie, Lucy, and 
Amanda, and six grandchildren.

HONORING KING BROTHERS DAIRY 
FOR RECEIVING THE NEW YORK

AGRICULTURAL 
SOCI-

AWARD 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor King Brothers Dairy for receiv-
ing the New York State Agricultural Society’s 
Business of the Year Award. For over 17 
years, the NYS Agricultural Society has pre-
sented Business of the Year honors to both a 
producer and an agribusiness, recognizing the 
quality, leadership and innovation they dem-
onstrate that enhances the integrity of the in-
dustry. 
King’s 
Ransom 
Farm, 
located 
in 
Schuylerville has been in operation for over 
100 years. Jan and Jeff King’s grandparents 
had been in the creamery business through 
the 1960s and in 2010, the family decided to 
return to their roots, establishing King Brothers 
Dairy. They began bottling and delivering milk 
from their own 1,000-cow herd to customers in 
their community and throughout the Hudson 
Valley. In 2019, they launched a retail store, 
selling over 34 flavors of ice cream and local 
products sourced from the area. When I vis-
ited the King Brothers Dairy in 2018 with 
USDA Secretary Perdue, I was impressed with 
their dedication to producing wholesome dairy 
products and providing excellent customer 
service. Their popularity within the community 
and their commitment to quality warrant this 
recent award. 
Agriculture is an essential component of the 
economy in Northern New York and King 
Brothers Dairy exemplifies the quality and di-
versity of North Country farms. On behalf of 
New York’s 21st District, I would like to con-
gratulate the entire King Family for this well- 
deserved recognition. I look forward to their fu-
ture success. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ENEDINA 
CELIZ RAPAN 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to remem-
ber and recognize the incredible life of 
Enedina Celiz Rapan, who passed away this 
month at the age of 93. 
I was raised in a farmworker community 
with farmworker parents in the eastern 
Coachella Valley, where, for many of us, hard-
ship and injustice can feel like the norm; and 
if it weren’t for women like Enedina Rapan, 
many of us would still believe that it is true, 
and we would not be standing where we are 
today. 
Enedina came to America at a young age to 
work hard, earn her living, and give her chil-
dren a better life. And while she was working 
away in the fields, sweating in 120-degree 
heat with calloused hands, she witnessed the 
mistreatment of her fellow farmworkers and 
she saw their suffering. 
If there is one thing about Enedina, it is that, 
when she saw injustice, she would speak up 
and get to work to fix it. So, when she saw 
farmworkers laboring for hours on end with no 
bathrooms nearby, she fought to bring rest-
rooms to the fields. 
And when she saw seniors in the commu-
nity going hungry, she organized, asking for 
donations and cooking meals so they could 
have dinner to eat. 
And Enedina devoted her life to standing up 
for people who were mistreated, discriminated 
against, and vulnerable. There was no voice 
too soft that Enedina didn’t hear and elevate. 
Enedina was a giant for our community, 
serving as a co-founder of Mujeres Mexicanas 
and Lideres Campesinas while working with 
the United Farm Workers of America and 
Cesar Chavez to stand up for the rights of 
farmworkers. She used her tireless will and 
unmatched strength to pick people up, fight for 
what is right, and make the Coachella Valley 
a better place for everyone who lives there. 
I am better off because of Enedina’s work. 
My family and the entire farmworker commu-
nity of the Coachella Valley, we are all better 
off because of Enedina’s work, 
And she would not be happy with me for 
being up here talking about her, because she 
was so humble. A woman who elevated every-
one’s voice around her, she would never seek 
this type of recognition. 
Madam Speaker, today, I want to make sure 
the country knows Enedina’s story. I want to 
make sure you know about her contributions 
to our community and her unrelenting pursuit 
of justice. Enedina will be sorely missed, but 
her presence will be felt and her life, an inspi-
ration for years to come.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E95 
January 28, 2020 
of H.R. 5671, the ‘‘Merchant Mariners of World 
War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 
2020’’, a bill that recognizes World War II mer-
chant mariner veterans with congressional 
gold medals for their service to the United 
States. 
I am a strong proponent of our veteran pop-
ulation having the recognition they deserve for 
their bravery, honor, valor and sacrifice. 
Throughout World War II, our armed forces 
relied on the Merchant Marine to provide com-
bat equipment, fuel, food, commodities and 
raw materials to troops stationed abroad in 
both theaters of operation, and they paid a 
heavy price in service to their country. 
The Merchant Marine is a war essential 
supply chain that transports the nation’s car-
goes in times of peace and prosperity, and in 
times of war and grave danger. 
Military missions and war planning are con-
tingent upon the availability of resources and 
the Merchant Marine played a vital role in this 
regard. 
The Merchant Marine provided for the suc-
cessful transport of resources and personnel 
despite consistent and ongoing exposure to 
enemy combatants from both the air and the 
sea, including from enemy bomber squadrons, 
submarines, and naval mines. 
The Merchant Marines were the best in-
formed and most widely traveled, constantly 
supplying the front-line troops until they could 
break through German, Japanese and Italian 
aggression to secure victory. 
The Merchant Marine suffered the highest 
per capita casualty rate in the U.S. Armed 
Forces during World War II. 
An estimated 8,300 mariners lost their lives, 
and another 12,000 were wounded during 
WWII. 
The Merchant Marine proved to be an in-
strumental asset on an untold number of occa-
sions, participating in every landing operation 
by the United States Marine Corps, from Gua-
dalcanal to Okinawa. 
Merchant Marines were engaged in the 
longest battle of the war—the Battle of the At-
lantic, fought over the vital supply lines to Eu-
rope—and they fought longer than any other 
branch of the service. 
These mariners have waited over 70 years 
to get the recognition they earned braving the 
perils of the Atlantic during the Second World 
War. 
There are 1.5 million veterans living in 
Texas and each of them deserve recognition 
for their service and sacrifice for this nation. 
Approximately 16 million Americans served 
in World War II and have come to receive vet-
eran status after the somber duration, but vic-
torious conclusion of the war. 
More than a quarter million, 250,000 thou-
sand civilian sailors, served in the U.S. Mer-
chant Marine by the end of the war. 
Despite their honorable, vital and heroic 
service in wartime, the men of the U.S. mer-
chant marine were not officially accorded vet-
eran status until 1988, decades following the 
end of World War II. 
The feats and accomplishments of the Mer-
chant Marine are deserving of broader public 
recognition. 
Unfortunately, the courageous contribution 
of the Merchant Mariners sacrifices are com-
monly overlooked. 
Every American owes these mariners a debt 
of gratitude we cannot begin to repay. 
The Congressional Gold Medal would be an 
appropriate way to shed further light on the 
service of the merchant mariners in World War 
II and the instrumental role they played in win-
ning that war. 
I ask my colleagues from both sides of the 
aisle to vote in support of H.R. 5671.

HONORING RAYMOND LERMA 
HON. TJ COX 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 28, 2020 
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of Raymond Lerma, a be-
loved husband, father, and leader in the com-
munity of Corcoran, California. Ray passed 
away on January 11th. Among his many hon-
ored roles in life, Ray served 25 years as 
Mayor and Councilmember in Corcoran and 
was a pillar of the community. 
Ray was born in El Paso, Texas and raised 
in Corcoran in a large and loving family that 
worked hard, long days in the fields of the 
Central Valley. Encouraged by his parents to 
reach for higher education, Mr. Lerma grad-
uated from UC Berkeley—he was a proud 
CAL Bear. 
After college, Ray returned to the commu-
nity that raised him to build his own family with 
his beloved wife Lola. He touched countless 
lives in his 38 years as an educator at Cor-
coran High School. He also kept changing 
lives after retirement, teaching English as a 
second language to adult learners. Ray also 
served as a longtime board member of the 
Kings Community Action Organization, which 
helps bring resources to the Central Valley. 
Ray once said that he wanted to be remem-
bered as someone who made a difference in 
his community. I stand before you today to 
say we will always remember his dedication 
and contributions to the community, and we 
will miss his leadership. 
Raymond Lerma leaves behind his wife 
Lola, their three children, Eva, Ramon, and 
Pablo, as well as his grandchildren.
