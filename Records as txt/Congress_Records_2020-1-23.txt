THURSDAY, JANUARY 23, 2020 
The Senate met at 1:02 p.m. and was 
called to order by the Chief Justice of 
the United States. 
f 
TRIAL 
OF 
DONALD 
J. 
TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate 
will convene as a Court of Impeach-
ment. 
The Chaplain will offer a prayer. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, our rock of ages, be 
omnipresent during this impeachment 
trial, providing our Senators with the 
assuring awareness of Your powerful 
involvement. May they strive to have a 
clear conscience in whatever they do 
for You and country. Lord, help them 
remember that listening is often more 
than hearing. It can be an empathetic 
attentiveness that builds bridges and 
unites. May our Senators not permit 
fatigue 
or 
cynicism 
to 
jeopardize 
friendships that have existed for years. 
At every decision point throughout 
this trial, may they ask, which choice 
will bring God the greater glory? 
We pray in Your mighty Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Chief Justice led the Pledge of 
Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
THE JOURNAL 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators will 
please be seated. 
If there is no objection, the Journal 
of proceedings of the trial are approved 
to date. 
The Sergeant at Arms will make the 
proclamation. 
The Sergeant at Arms, Michael C. 
Stenger, made proclamation as follows: 
Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are 
commanded to keep silence, on pain of im-
prisonment, while the Senate of the United 
States is sitting for the trial of the articles 
of impeachment exhibited by the House of 
Representatives against Donald John Trump, 
President of the United States. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
it is my understanding the schedule 
today will be similar to yesterday’s 
proceedings. We will plan to take short 
breaks every 2 or 3 hours and will ac-
commodate a 30-minute recess for din-
ner, assuming that is needed. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to 
the provisions of S. Res. 483, the man-
agers of the House of Representatives 
have 16 hours and 42 minutes remain-
ing to make the presentation of their 
case. 
The Senate will now hear you. 
The Presiding Officer recognizes Mr. 
Manager SCHIFF to continue the pres-
entation of the case for the House of 
Representatives. 
OPENING STATEMENT—CONTINUED 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I thank you, and I thank the Sen-
ators for 2 now very long days. We are 
greatly appreciative of Chief Justice, 
knowing that, prior to your arrival in 
the Chamber each day, you have a lot 
of work at the Court, necessitating our 
beginning in the afternoon and going 
into the evening. 
I also want to, again, take this op-
portunity to thank the Senators for 
their long and considerable attention 
over the course of the last 2 days. I am 
not sure the Chief Justice is fully 
aware of just how rare it is, how ex-
traordinary it is, for the House Mem-
bers to be able to command the atten-
tion of Senators sitting silently for 
hours—or even for minutes, for that 
matter. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that 
the morning starts out every day with 
the Sergeant at Arms warning you 
that, if you don’t, you will be impris-
oned. It is our hope that, when the trial 
concludes and you have heard us and 
you have heard the President’s counsel 
over a series of long days, that you 
don’t choose imprisonment instead of 
anything further. 
Two days ago we made the case for 
documents and for witnesses in the 
trial. Yesterday we walked through the 
chronology, the factual chronology, at 
some length. 
Today we will go through article I, 
the constitutional underpinnings of 
abuse of power, and apply the facts of 
the President’s scheme to the law and 
Constitution. Here I must ask you for 
some forbearance. Of necessity, there 
will be some repetition of information

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S488 
January 23, 2020 
from yesterday’s chronology, and I 
want to explain the reason for it. 
You have now heard hundreds of 
hours of deposition and live testimony 
from the House condensed into an ab-
breviated narrative of the facts. We 
will now show you these facts and 
many others and how they are inter-
woven. You will see some of these facts 
and videos, therefore, in a new context, 
in a new light: in the light of what else 
we know and why it compels a finding 
of guilt and conviction. So there is 
some method to our madness. 
Tomorrow we will conclude the pres-
entation of the facts and law on article 
I, and we will begin and complete the 
same on article II, the President’s un-
constitutional obstruction of Congress. 
The President’s counsel will then have 
3 days to make their presentations, and 
then you will have 16 hours to ask 
questions. Then the trial will begin. 
Then you will actually get to hear 
from the witnesses yourself, and then 
you will get to see the documents your-
self—or so we hope, and so do the 
American people. After their testimony 
and after we have had closing argu-
ments, then it will be in your hands. 
So let’s begin today’s presentation. I 
yield to House Manager NADLER. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. Good morn-
ing, Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, my 
fellow House managers, and counsel for 
the President. This is the third day of 
a solemn occasion for the American 
people. 
The Articles of Impeachment against 
President Trump rank among the most 
serious charges ever brought against a 
President. As our recital of the facts 
indicated, the articles are overwhelm-
ingly 
supported 
by 
the 
evidence 
amassed 
by 
the 
House, 
notwith-
standing 
the 
President’s 
complete 
stonewalling, his attempt to block all 
witnesses and all documents from the 
U.S. Congress. 
The first Article of Impeachment 
charges the President with abuse of 
power. President Trump used the pow-
ers of his office to solicit a foreign na-
tion to interfere in our elections for his 
own personal benefit. 
Note that the active solicitation 
itself—just the ask—constitutes an 
abuse of power, but President Trump 
went further. In order to secure his 
favor from Ukraine, he withheld two 
official acts of immense value. First, 
he withheld the release of $391 million 
in vital military assistance appro-
priated by Congress on a bipartisan 
basis, which Ukraine needed to fight 
Russian aggression. Second, President 
Trump withheld a long-sought-after 
White House meeting which would con-
firm to the world that America stands 
behind Ukraine in its ongoing struggle. 
The President’s conduct is wrong. It 
is illegal. It is dangerous. It captures 
the worst fears of our Founders and the 
Framers of the Constitution. 
Since President George Washington 
took office in 1789, no President has 
abused his power in this way. Let me 
say that again. No President has ever 
used his office to compel a foreign na-
tion to help him cheat in our elections. 
Prior Presidents would be shocked to 
the core by such conduct, and rightly 
so. 
Now, because President Trump has 
largely failed to convince the country 
that his conduct was remotely accept-
able, he has adopted a fallback posi-
tion. He argues that even if we dis-
approve of his misconduct, we cannot 
remove him for it. Frankly, that argu-
ment is itself terrifying. It confirms 
that this President sees no limits on 
his power or on his ability to use his 
public 
office 
for 
private 
gain. 
Of 
course, the President also believes that 
he can use his power to cover up his 
crimes. 
That leads me to the second article 
of impeachment, which charges that 
the President categorically, indiscrimi-
nately, and unlawfully obstructed our 
inquiry, the congressional inquiry, into 
his 
conduct. 
This 
Presidential 
stonewalling of Congress is unprece-
dented in the 238-year history of our 
constitutional Republic. It puts even 
President Nixon to shame. 
Taken together, the articles and the 
evidence conclusively establish that 
President Trump has placed his own 
personal political interests first. He 
has placed them above our national se-
curity, above our free and fair elec-
tions, and above our system of checks 
and balances. This conduct is not 
America first; it is Donald Trump first. 
Donald Trump swore an oath to faith-
fully execute the laws. That means 
putting the Nation’s interests above 
his own. The President has repeatedly, 
flagrantly, violated his oath. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GERHARDT. I just want to stress that 
if this—if what we’re talking about is not 
impeachable, then nothing is impeachable. 
This is precisely the misconduct that the 
Framers created a constitution, including 
impeachment, to protect against. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. All of the 
legal experts who testified before the 
House Judiciary Committee—those in-
vited by the Democrats and those in-
vited by the Republicans—all agreed 
that the conduct we have charged con-
stitutes 
high 
crimes 
and 
mis-
demeanors. 
Professor Michael Gerhardt, the au-
thor of six books and the only joint 
witness when the House considered 
President Clinton’s case, put it simply: 
‘‘If what we are talking about is not 
impeachable, then nothing is impeach-
able.’’ 
Professor Jonathan Turley, called by 
the Republicans as a witness, agreed 
that the articles charge an offense that 
is impeachable. In his written testi-
mony, he stated: ‘‘The use of military 
aid for a quid pro quo to investigate 
one’s political opponent, if proven, can 
be an impeachable offense.’’ 
Thus far, we have presented the core 
factual narrative. None of that record 
can be seriously disputed, and none of 
it will be disputed. 
We can predict what the President’s 
lawyers will say in the next few days. I 
urge you, Senators, to listen to it care-
fully. You will hear accusations and 
name-calling. You will hear complaints 
about the process in the House and the 
motives of the managers. You will hear 
that this all comes down to a phone 
call that was perfect—as if you had not 
just seen evidence of a months-long, 
government-wide effort to extort a for-
eign government. But you will not hear 
a refutation of the evidence. You will 
not hear testimony to refute the testi-
mony you have seen. Indeed, if the 
President had any exculpatory wit-
nesses—even a single one—he would be 
demanding their appearance here, in-
stead of urging you not to permit addi-
tional witnesses to testify. 
Let me offer a preview of the path 
ahead. First, we will examine the law 
of impeachable offenses, with a focus 
on abuse of power. That will be the 
subject of my presentation. Then, my 
colleagues will apply the law to the 
facts. They will demonstrate that the 
President has unquestionably 
com-
mitted the high crimes and mis-
demeanors outlined in the first Article 
of Impeachment. 
Once those presentations are con-
cluded, we will take the same approach 
to demonstrating President Trump’s 
obstruction of Congress—the second 
Article of Impeachment. We will begin 
by stating the law. Then we will review 
the facts, and then we will apply the 
law to the facts, proving that President 
Trump is guilty of the second Article 
of Impeachment as well. 
With that roadmap to guide us, I will 
begin by walking through the law of 
abuse of power. Here, I will start by de-
fining the phrase in the Constitution 
‘‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ 
When the Framers selected this term, 
they meant it to capture, as George 
Mason put it, all manner of ‘‘great and 
dangerous offenses’’ against the Na-
tion. 
In 
contemporary 
terms, 
the 
Framers had three specific offenses in 
mind: abuse of power, betrayal of the 
Nation through foreign entanglements, 
and corruption of elections. 
You can think of these as the ABCs 
of high crimes and misdemeanors: 
abuse, betrayal, and corruption. The 
Framers believed that any one of these 
offenses, standing alone, justified re-
moval from office. 
Professor Noah Feldman of Harvard 
Law School explained this well before 
the House Judiciary Committee. Here 
is his explanation of why the Framers 
created the impeachment power. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Professor FELDMAN. The Framers pro-
vided for the impeachment of the President 
because they feared that the President might 
abuse the power of his office for personal 
benefit, to corrupt the electoral process and 
ensure his reelection, or to subvert the na-
tional security of the United States. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. That is the 
standard as described by Professor 
Feldman. All three appear at once— 
abuse, betrayal, and corruption. That 
is where we have the strongest possible 
case for removing a President from of-
fice. Later on, we will apply this rule 
to the facts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S489 
January 23, 2020 
Abuse: We will show that President 
Trump abused his power when he used 
his 
office 
to 
solicit 
and 
pressure 
Ukraine to meddle in our elections for 
his personal gain. 
Betrayal: We will show that he be-
trayed vital national interests—specifi-
cally, our national security—by with-
holding diplomatic support and mili-
tary aid from Ukraine, even as it faced 
armed Russian aggression. 
Corruption: President Trump’s intent 
was to corrupt our elections to his per-
sonal, political benefit. He put his per-
sonal interest in retaining power above 
free and fair elections—and above the 
principle that Americans must govern 
themselves, without interference from 
abroad. 
Article I thus charges a high crime 
and misdemeanor that blends abuse of 
power, betrayal of the Nation, and cor-
ruption in elections into a single unfor-
givable scheme. That is why this Presi-
dent must be removed from office, es-
pecially before he continues his effort 
to corrupt our next election. 
The charges set forth in the first Ar-
ticle 
of 
Impeachment 
are 
firmly 
grounded in the Constitution of the 
United States. Simply stated, impeach-
ment is the Constitution’s final answer 
to a President who mistakes himself 
for a King. 
The Framers had risked their free-
dom, and their lives, to escape mon-
archy. Together, they resolved to build 
a nation committed to democracy and 
the rule of law—a beacon to the world 
at an age of aristocracy. In the United 
States of America, ‘‘We the people’’ 
would be sovereign. We would choose 
our leaders and hold them accountable 
for how they exercised power on our be-
half. 
In writing our Constitution, the 
Framers recognized that we needed a 
Chief Executive who could lead the Na-
tion with efficiency, energy, and dis-
patch. So they created a powerful Pres-
idency and vested it with immense pub-
lic trust. But this solution created a 
different problem. 
The Framers were not naive. They 
knew that power corrupts. They knew 
that Republics cannot flourish—and 
that people cannot live free—under a 
corrupt leader. They foresaw that a 
President faithful only to himself 
would endanger every American. So 
the Framers built guardrails to ensure 
that the American people would re-
main free and to ensure that out-of- 
control Presidents would not destroy 
everything they sought to build. 
They imposed elections every 4 years 
to ensure accountability. They banned 
the President from profiting off his of-
fice. They divided the powers of the 
Federal 
Government 
across 
three 
branches. They required the President 
to swear an oath to faithfully execute 
the laws. 
To the Framers, the concept of faith-
ful execution was profoundly impor-
tant. It prohibited the President from 
exercising power in bad faith or with 
corrupt intent, and thus ensured that 
the President would put the American 
people first, not himself. 
A few Framers would have stopped 
there. This minority feared vesting any 
branch of government with the power 
to remove a President from office. 
They would have relied on elections 
alone to address rogue Presidents. But 
that view was decisively rejected at the 
Constitutional Convention. 
Convening in the shadow of rebellion 
and revolution, the Framers would not 
deny the Nation an escape from Presi-
dents who deemed themselves above 
the law. Instead, they adopted the 
power of impeachment. In so doing, 
they offered a clear answer to George 
Mason’s question: ‘‘Shall any man be 
above justice?’’ As Mason himself ex-
plained, ‘‘some mode of displacing an 
unfit magistrate is rendered indispen-
sable by the fallibility of those who 
choose, as well as by the corrupt abil-
ity of the man chosen.’’ 
Unlike in Britain, the President 
would answer personally—to Congress 
and thus to the Nation—for any serious 
wrongdoing. But this decision raised a 
question: What conduct would justify 
impeachment and removal? 
As careful students of history, the 
Framers knew that threats to democ-
racy can take many forms. They feared 
would-be monarchs but also warned 
against fake populists, charismatic 
demagogues, 
and 
corrupt 
‘‘kleptocrats.’’ 
In describing the kind of leader who 
might menace the Nation, Alexander 
Hamilton offered an especially striking 
portrait. Mr. SCHIFF read this portrait 
in his introductory remarks and it 
bears repetition. 
When a man unprincipled in private life, 
desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper 
. . . known to have scoffed in private at the 
principles of liberty—when such a man is 
seen to mount the hobby horse of popu-
larity—to join in the cry of danger to lib-
erty—to take every opportunity of embar-
rassing the General Government & bringing 
it under suspicion—to flatter and fall in with 
all the non sense of the zealots of the day— 
It may justly be suspected that his object is 
to throw things into confusion that he may 
ride the storm and direct the whirlwind. 
Hamilton was a wise man. He foresaw 
dangers far ahead of his time. Given 
the many threats they had to antici-
pate, 
the 
Framers 
considered 
ex-
tremely broad grounds for removing 
Presidents. For example, they debated 
setting the bar at maladministration, 
to allow removal for run-of-the-mill 
policy disagreements between Congress 
and the President. 
They also considered very narrow 
grounds, strictly limiting impeach-
ment to treason and bribery. Ulti-
mately, they struck a balance. 
They did not want Presidents re-
moved for ordinary political or policy 
disagreements, but they intended im-
peachments to reach the full spectrum 
of Presidential misconduct that might 
threaten the Constitution, and they in-
tended our Constitution to endure for 
the ages. They adopted a standard that 
meant, as Mason put it, to capture all 
manner of ‘‘great and dangerous of-
fenses’’ incompatible with the Con-
stitution. 
This 
standard, 
borrowed 
from the British Parliament, was ‘‘high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors.’’ 
In England, the standard was under-
stood to capture offenses against the 
constitutional system itself. That is 
confirmed by the use of the word 
‘‘high,’’ as well as by parliamentary 
practice. 
From 1376 to 1787, the House of Com-
mons impeached officials on a few gen-
eral 
grounds—mainly 
consisting 
of 
abuse of power, betrayal of national se-
curity and foreign policy, corruption, 
treason, bribery, and disregarding the 
powers of Parliament. 
The phrase ‘‘high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’ 
thus 
covered 
offenses 
against the Nation itself—in other 
words, crimes against the British Con-
stitution. 
As scholars were shown, the same un-
derstanding prevailed on this side of 
the Atlantic. In the colonial period and 
under newly ratified State constitu-
tions, most impeachments targeted 
abuse of power, betrayal of the revolu-
tionary cause, corruption, treason, and 
bribery. These experiences were well- 
known to the Framers of the Constitu-
tion. 
History thus teaches that ‘‘high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors’’ referred 
mainly to acts committed by officials 
using their power or privileges, that in-
flicted grave harm on society. Such 
great and dangerous offenses included 
treason, bribery, abuse of power, be-
trayal of the Nation, and corruption of 
office. And they were unified by a clear 
theme. 
Officials who abused, abandoned, or 
sought to benefit personally from their 
public trust—and who threatened the 
rule of law if left in power—faced im-
peachment and removal. Abuse, be-
trayal, corruption—this is exactly the 
understanding that the Framers incor-
porated into the Constitution. 
As Supreme Court Justice Robert 
Jackson wisely observed, ‘‘the purpose 
of the Constitution was not only to 
grant power, but to keep it from get-
ting out of hand.’’ 
Nowhere is that truer than in Presi-
dency. As the Framers created a formi-
dable Chief Executive, they made clear 
that impeachment is justified for seri-
ous abuse of power. 
James Madison stated that impeach-
ment is necessary because the Presi-
dent ‘‘might pervert his administration 
into a scheme of . . . oppression.’’ 
Hamilton set the standard for re-
moval at an ‘‘abuse or violation of 
some public trust.’’ 
And in Massachusetts, Rev. Samuel 
Stillman asked: ‘‘With such a prospect 
[of impeachment], will dare to abuse 
the powers vested in him by the peo-
ple?’’ 
Time and again, Americans who 
wrote and ratified the Constitution 
confirmed that Presidents may be im-
peached for abusing the power en-
trusted to them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S490 
January 23, 2020 
To the Framers’ generation, more-
over, abuse of power was a well-under-
stood offense. It took two basic forms. 
The first occurred when someone exer-
cised power in ways far beyond what 
the law allowed—or in ways that de-
stroyed checks on their own authority. 
The second occurred when an official 
exercised power to obtain an improper 
personal benefit, while ignoring or in-
juring the national interest. In other 
words, the President may commit an 
impeachable abuse of power in two dif-
ferent ways: by engaging in clearly for-
bidden acts or by taking actions that 
are allowed but for reasons that are 
not allowed—for instance, to obtain 
corrupt, private benefits. 
Let me unpack that idea, starting 
with the first category: conduct clearly 
inconsistent with the law, including 
the law of checks and balances. The 
generation 
that 
rebelled 
against 
George III knew what absolute power 
looked like. It was no abstraction to 
them. They had a different idea in 
mind when they organized our govern-
ment. Most significantly, they placed 
the President under the law, not above 
it. That means the President may exer-
cise only the powers vested in him by 
the Constitution. He must also respect 
the legal limits on the exercise of those 
powers. 
A President who egregiously refuses 
to follow these restrictions, by engag-
ing in wrongful conduct, may be sub-
jected to impeachment for abuse of 
power. Two American impeachment in-
quiries have involved claims that a 
President grossly violated the Con-
stitution’s separation of powers. 
The first was in 1868, when the House 
impeached President Andrew Johnson, 
who had succeeded Abraham Lincoln 
after his assassination at Ford’s The-
atre. 
In firing the Secretary of War, Presi-
dent Johnson allegedly violated the 
Tenure of Office Act, which restricted 
the President’s power to remove Cabi-
net members during the term of the 
President who had appointed them. 
The House of Representatives ap-
proved articles charging it with con-
duct forbidden by law. That is an ac-
tion that is an abuse of power on its 
face. Ultimately, the Senate acquitted 
President Johnson by one vote. This 
was partly because there was a strong 
argument that the Tenure of Office 
Act, which President Johnson was 
charged with violating, was itself un-
constitutional—a position the Supreme 
Court later accepted. Of course, histo-
rians have also noted that a key Sen-
ator appears to have changed his vote 
at the last minute in exchange for 
promises of special treatment by Presi-
dent Johnson. So perhaps that acquit-
tal means a little less than meets the 
eye. 
In any event, just over 100 years 
later, the House Judiciary Committee 
accused the second Chief Executive of 
abusing his power in a manner egre-
giously inconsistent with the law. The 
committee charged President Nixon 
with obstruction of Congress based on 
his meritless assertion of executive 
privilege to cover up key White House 
tape recordings. 
We will have more to say about the 
obstruction charge in a moment. 
But the Nixon case also exemplifies 
the second way a President can abuse 
his power. President Nixon faced two 
more Articles of Impeachment. Both of 
these articles charged him with abus-
ing the powers of his office with cor-
rupt intent. One focused on his abuse of 
power to obstruct law enforcement. 
The other targeted his abuse of power 
to target political opponents. Each ar-
ticle enumerated specific abuses by 
President Nixon, many of which in-
volved the wrongful, corrupt exercise 
of Presidential power and many of 
which 
were 
likely 
not 
statutory 
crimes. 
In explaining its second article, the 
House 
Judiciary 
Committee 
stated 
that President Nixon’s conduct was 
‘‘undertaken for his personal political 
advantage and not in furtherance of 
any valid national policy objective.’’ 
That should sound familiar to every-
one here. It reflects the standard I have 
already articulated: the exercise of of-
ficial power to corruptly obtain a per-
sonal benefit while ignoring or injuring 
the national interest. 
To be sure, all Presidents account to 
some extent for how their decisions in 
office may affect their political pros-
pects. The Constitution does not forbid 
that. Elected officials can and should 
care about how voters will react to 
their decisions. They will often care 
about whether their decisions make it 
more likely that they will be reelected. 
But there is a difference—a difference 
that matters—between political cal-
culus and outright corruption. 
Some uses of Presidential power are 
so outrageous, so obviously improper, 
that if they are undertaken for a Presi-
dent’s own personal gain, with injury 
or indifference to core national inter-
ests, then they are obviously high 
crimes and misdemeanors. Otherwise, 
even the most egregious wrongdoing 
could be justified as disagreement over 
policy or politics, and corruption that 
would have shocked the Framers—that 
they expressly sought to prohibit— 
would overcome the protections they 
established for our benefit. 
There should be nothing surprising 
about impeaching a President for using 
his power with corrupt motives. The 
House and Senate have confirmed this 
point in prior impeachments. More im-
portant, the Constitution itself says 
that we can do so. 
To start, the Constitution requires 
that the President ‘‘faithfully execute’’ 
the law. A President who acts with cor-
rupt motives, putting himself above 
country, has acted faithlessly, not 
faithfully executing the law. 
Moreover, the two impeachable of-
fenses that the Constitution enumer-
ates—Treason and Bribery—each re-
quire proof of the President’s mental 
state. For treason, he must have acted 
with a ‘‘disloyal mind,’’ according to 
the Supreme Court. And it is well es-
tablished that the elements of bribery 
include corrupt motives. 
In sum, to the Framers, it was dan-
gerous for officials to exceed their con-
stitutional power. But it was equally 
dangerous—perhaps more so—for offi-
cials to use their power with corrupt, 
nefarious motives, thus perverting pub-
lic trust for private gain. 
Abuse of power is clearly an impeach-
able offense under the Constitution. To 
be honest, this should not be a con-
troversial statement. I find it amazing 
that the President rejects it. Yet he 
does. He insists there is no such thing 
as impeachable abuse of power. This 
position is dead wrong. All prior im-
peachments considered of high office 
have always included abuse of power. 
All of the experts who testified before 
the House Judiciary Committee, in-
cluding those called by the Repub-
licans, agreed that abuse of power is a 
high crime and misdemeanor. 
Here is testimony from Professor 
Pam Karlan of Stanford Law School, 
joined by Professor Gerhardt. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. EISEN. Professor Karlan, do scholars 
of impeachment generally agree that abuse 
of power is an impeachable offense? 
Ms. KARLAN. Yes, they do. 
Mr. EISEN. Professor Gerhardt, do you 
agree that abuse of power is impeachable? 
Mr. GERHARDT. Yes, sir. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. Professor 
Turley, who testified at the Republican 
invitation, echoed that view. In fact, 
he not only agreed, but he ‘‘stressed’’ 
that ‘‘it is possible to establish a case 
for impeachment based on a non-crimi-
nal allegation of abuse of power.’’ 
Professor Turley is hardly the only 
legal expert to take that view. Another 
who comes to mind is Professor Allen 
Dershowitz—at least Alan Dershowitz 
in 1998. Back then, here is what he had 
to say about impeachment for abuse of 
power. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. DERSHOWITZ. It certainly doesn’t 
have to be a crime. If you have somebody 
who completely corrupts the office of Presi-
dent and who abuses trust and poses great 
danger to our liberty, you don’t need a tech-
nical crime. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. But we need 
not look to 1998 to find one of Presi-
dent Trump’s key allies espousing this 
view. Consider the comments of our 
current 
Attorney 
General, 
William 
Barr, a man known for his extraor-
dinarily expansive view of Executive 
power. In Attorney General Barr’s 
view, as expressed about 18 months 
ago, Presidents cannot be indicted or 
criminally investigated—but that’s OK 
because they can be impeached. That’s 
the safeguard. And in an impeachment, 
Attorney General added, the President 
is ‘‘answerable for any abuses of discre-
tion’’ and may be held ‘‘accountable 
under law for his misdeeds in office.’’ 
In other words, Attorney General 
Barr believes, along with the Office of 
Legal Counsel, that a President may 
not be indicted. He believes that is OK.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S491 
January 23, 2020 
We don’t need that safeguard against a 
President who would commit abuses of 
power. It is OK because he can be im-
peached. That is the safeguard for 
abuses of discretion and for his mis-
deeds in office. 
More recently, a group of the Na-
tion’s leading constitutional scholars— 
ranging across the ideological spec-
trum from Harvard Law Professor 
Larry Tribe to former Ronald Reagan 
Solicitor General Charles Fried—issued 
a statement affirming that ‘‘abuse of 
power counts as an instance of im-
peachable 
high 
crimes 
and 
mis-
demeanors under the Constitution.’’ 
They added: ‘‘That was clearly the 
view of the Constitution’s framers.’’ 
I could go on, but you get the point. 
Everyone, except President Trump and 
his lawyers, agrees that Presidents can 
be impeached for abuse of power. The 
President’s position amounts to noth-
ing but self-serving constitutional non-
sense. And it is dangerous nonsense at 
that. A President who sees no limit on 
his power manifestly threatens the Re-
public. 
The Constitution always matches 
power with constraint. That is true 
even of powers vested in the Chief Ex-
ecutive. Nobody is entitled to wield 
power under the Constitution if they 
ignore or betray the Nation’s interests 
to advance their own. President Nixon 
was wrong in asserting that ‘‘when the 
President does it, that means it is not 
illegal.’’ And President Trump was 
equally wrong when he declared that 
he had ‘‘the right to do whatever I 
want as president.’’ 
Under the Constitution, he is subject 
to impeachment and removal for abuse 
of power. And as we will prove, that is 
exactly what must happen here. 
Of course, President Trump’s abuse 
of power—as charged in the first Arti-
cle of Impeachment and supported by a 
mountain of evidence—is aggravated 
by another concern at the heart of the 
Constitution’s impeachment clause. 
Betrayal. The Founders of our coun-
try were not fearful men. When they 
wrote our Constitution, they had only 
recently won a bloody war for inde-
pendence. But as they looked outward 
from their new Nation, they saw Kings 
scheming for power, promising fabu-
lous wealth to spies and deserters. The 
United States could be enmeshed in 
such conspiracies. ‘‘Foreign powers,’’ 
warned Elbridge Gerry, ‘‘will inter-
meddle in our affairs, and spare no ex-
pense to influence them.’’ 
The young Republic might not sur-
vive a President who schemed with 
other nations, entangling himself in se-
cret deals that harmed our democracy. 
That reality loomed over the impeach-
ment debate in Philadelphia. 
Explaining why the Constitution re-
quired an impeachment option, Madi-
son argued that a President ‘‘might be-
tray his trust to foreign powers.’’ To be 
sure, the Framers did not intend im-
peachment for genuine, good faith dis-
agreements between the President and 
Congress over matters of diplomacy. 
But they were explicit that betrayal of 
the Nation through plots with foreign 
powers must result in removal from of-
fice. And no such betrayal scared them 
more than foreign interference in our 
democracy. 
In his Farewell Address, George 
Washington warned Americans ‘‘to be 
constantly awake, since history and 
experience prove that foreign influence 
is one of the most baneful foes of re-
publican government.’’ 
And in a letter to Thomas Jefferson, 
John Adams wrote: 
You are apprehensive of foreign Inter-
ference, Intrigue, Influence.—So am I.—But, 
as often as Elections happen, the danger of 
foreign Influence recurs. 
The Framers never suggested that 
the President’s role in foreign affairs 
should prevent Congress from impeach-
ing him for treachery in his dealings. 
Case in point: they wrote a Constitu-
tion that gives Congress extensive re-
sponsibility over foreign affairs—Con-
gress—including the power to declare 
war, regulate foreign commerce, estab-
lish a uniform rule of naturalization, 
and define offenses against the law of 
nations. 
Contrary to the claims you heard the 
other day—that the President has ple-
nary authority in foreign affairs and 
there is nothing Congress can do about 
it—the Supreme Court has stated that 
constitutional authority over the ‘‘con-
duct of the foreign relations of our 
Government’’ is shared between ‘‘the 
Executive and Legislative [branches].’’ 
Or to quote another Supreme Court 
case: ‘‘The Executive is not free from 
the ordinary controls and checks of 
Congress merely because foreign affairs 
are at issue.’’ 
In these realms, Justice Jackson 
wrote, the Constitution ‘‘enjoins upon 
its branches separateness but inter-
dependence, 
autonomy 
but 
reci-
procity.’’ 
Where the President betrays our na-
tional security and foreign policy in-
terests for his own personal gain, he is 
unquestionably subject to impeach-
ment and removal. The same is true of 
a different concern raised by the Fram-
ers: the use of Presidential power to 
corrupt the elections and the Office of 
the Presidency. 
The Framers were no strangers to 
corruption. They understood that cor-
ruption had broken Rome, debased 
Britain, and threatened America. They 
saw no shortage of threats to the Re-
public and fought valiantly to guard 
against them. But as one scholar 
writes, ‘‘the big fear underlying all the 
small fears was whether they’d be able 
to control corruption.’’ 
So the Framers attempted to build a 
government in which officials would 
not use public power for personal bene-
fits, disregarding the public good in 
pursuit of their own advancement. 
This principle applied with special 
force to the Presidency. As Madison 
emphasized, because the Presidency 
‘‘was to be administered by a single 
man,’’ his corruption ‘‘might be fatal 
to the Republic.’’ 
Indeed, no fewer than four delegates 
to the Constitutional Convention— 
Madison, plus Morris, Mason, and Ran-
dolph—listed corruption as a central 
reason why Presidents must be subject 
to impeachment and removal from of-
fice. Impeachment was seen as espe-
cially necessary for Presidential con-
duct corrupting our system of political 
self-government. The Framers foresaw 
and feared that a President might 
someday place his personal interest in 
reelection above our abiding commit-
ment to democracy. Such a President, 
in their view, would need to be re-
moved from office. 
Professor Feldman made this point in 
his testimony before the House Judici-
ary Committee: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. FELDMAN. The Framers reserved im-
peachment for situations where the Presi-
dent abused his office, that is, used it for his 
personal advantage. And, in particular, they 
were specifically worried about a situation 
where the President used his office to facili-
tate corruptly his own reelection. That’s, in 
fact, why they thought they needed impeach-
ment and why waiting for the next election 
wasn’t good enough. 
Professor Feldman’s testimony is 
grounded in the records of the Con-
stitutional Convention. 
There, William Davie warned that a 
President who abused his office might 
spare no efforts or means whatever to 
get himself reelected and, thus, to es-
cape justice. 
George Mason built on Davie’s posi-
tion, asking: ‘‘Shall the man who has 
practiced 
corruption, 
and 
by 
that 
means procured his appointment to the 
first instance, be suffered to escape 
punishment by repeating his guilt?’’ 
Mason’s concern was straightforward. 
He feared that Presidents would win 
election 
by 
improperly 
influencing 
members of the electoral college. 
Gouverneur Morris later echoed this 
point, urging that the Executive ought 
therefore to be impeachable for cor-
rupting his electors. 
Taken together, these debates dem-
onstrate an essential point: The Fram-
ers knew that a President who abused 
power to manipulate elections pre-
sented the greatest possible threat to 
the Constitution. After all, the beating 
heart of the Framers’ project was a 
commitment to popular sovereignty. 
At a time when democratic self-gov-
ernment existed almost nowhere on 
Earth, the Framers imagined a society 
where power flowed from and returned 
to the people. That is why the Presi-
dent and Members of Congress must 
stand before the public for reelection 
on fixed terms, and if the President 
abuses his power to corrupt those elec-
tions, he threatens the entire system. 
As Professor Karlan explained in her 
testimony: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Professor KARLAN. [D]rawing a foreign 
government into our elections is an espe-
cially serious abuse of power because it un-
dermines democracy itself. Our Constitution 
begins with the words ‘‘We the people’’ for a 
reason. Our government, in James Madison’s

January 23, 2020 
words, derives all its powers directly or indi-
rectly from the great body of the people, and 
the way it derives these powers is through 
elections. Elections matter, both to the le-
gitimacy of our government and to all of our 
individual freedoms, because, as the Su-
preme Court declared more than a century 
ago, voting is preservative of all rights. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. Professor 
Karlan is right—elections matter. They 
make our government legitimate, and 
they protect our freedom. A President 
who abuses his power in order to knee-
cap political opponents and spread Rus-
sian conspiracy theories—a President 
who uses his office to ask for or, even 
worse, to compel foreign nations to 
meddle in our elections—is a President 
who attacks the very foundations of 
our liberty. That is a grave abuse of 
power. It is an unprecedented betrayal 
of the national interest. It is a shock-
ing corruption of the election process, 
and it is without a doubt a crime 
against the Constitution, warranting, 
demanding his removal from office. 
The Framers expected that free elec-
tions would be the usual means of pro-
tecting our freedoms, but they knew 
that a President who sought foreign as-
sistance in his campaign must be re-
moved from office before he could steal 
the next election. 
In a last-ditch legal defense of their 
client, the President’s lawyers argue 
that impeachment and removal are 
subject to statutory crimes or to of-
fenses against established law, that the 
President cannot be impeached because 
he has not committed a crime. This 
view is completely wrong. It has no 
support in constitutional text and 
structure, original meaning, congres-
sional precedents, common sense, or 
the consensus of credible experts. In 
other words, it conflicts with every rel-
evant consideration. 
Professor Gerhardt succinctly cap-
tured the consensus view in his testi-
mony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
COUNSEL. Now, Professor Gerhardt, does 
a high crime and misdemeanor require an ac-
tual statutory crime? 
Mr. GERHARDT. No. It plainly does not. 
Everything we know about the history of im-
peachment reinforces the conclusion that 
impeachable offenses do not have to be 
crimes. And, again, not all crimes are im-
peachable offenses. We look, again, at the 
context of the gravity of the misconduct. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. This position 
was echoed by the Republicans’ expert 
witness, Professor Turley, in his writ-
ten testimony. 
There, he stated: ‘‘It is possible to es-
tablish a case for impeachment based 
on a non-criminal allegation of abuse 
of power.’’ 
He also stated: ‘‘It is clear that high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors can encom-
pass non-criminal conduct.’’ 
More recently, Professor Turley— 
again, the Republican witness at our 
hearing—wrote an opinion piece in the 
Washington Post entitled ‘‘Where the 
Trump defense goes too far.’’ In this 
piece, he stated that the President’s ar-
gument ‘‘is as politically unwise as it 
is constitutionally shortsighted.’’ He 
added: ‘‘If successful, it would also 
come at a considerable cost for the 
Constitution.’’ 
Although 
I 
disagree 
with Professor Turley on many, many 
issues, here, he is clearly right. 
I might say the same thing of then- 
House Manager LINDSEY GRAHAM, who, 
in President Clinton’s trial, flatly re-
jected the notion that impeachable of-
fenses are limited to violations of es-
tablished law. 
This is what he said: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GRAHAM. What is a high crime? How 
about if an important person hurts somebody 
of low means? It is not very scholarly, but I 
think it’s the truth. I think that’s what they 
meant by high crimes. It doesn’t have to be 
a crime. It is just—when you start using 
your office and you’re acting in a way that 
hurts people, you have committed a high 
crime. 
Mr. Manager NADLER. There are 
many reasons why high crimes and 
misdemeanors are not and cannot be 
limited to violations of the Criminal 
Code. We address them at length in the 
briefs we have filed and in the report of 
the House Judiciary Committee re-
specting these Articles of Impeach-
ment, but I would like to highlight a 
few 
especially 
important 
consider-
ations. I will tick through them quick-
ly. 
First, there is the matter of the his-
torical record. The Framers could not 
have meant to limit impeachment to 
statutory crimes. Presidents are to be 
impeached and removed from office for 
‘‘treason, 
bribery, 
and 
other 
high 
Crimes and Misdemeanors,’’ but brib-
ery was not made a statutory crime 
until 1837. 
Second, the President’s position is 
contradicted 
by 
the 
Constitution’s 
text. The Framers repeatedly referred 
to ‘‘crimes,’’ ‘‘offenses,’’ and ‘‘punish-
ment’’ elsewhere in the Constitution, 
but here they refer to ‘‘high Crimes.’’ 
That matters. It matters because the 
phrase ‘‘high Crimes’’ refers to offenses 
against the State rather than to work-
aday crimes, and it matters because 
the phrase ‘‘high crimes and mis-
demeanors’’ had a rich history in Eng-
land, where it had been applied in 
many, many cases that did not involve 
crimes under British law. When the 
Framers added ‘‘high Crimes’’ here but 
nowhere else in the Constitution, they 
made a deliberate choice. Any doubt in 
that score is dispelled by the Framers’ 
own statements. 
In Federalist No. 65, Alexander Ham-
ilton explained that impeachable of-
fenses are defined fundamentally by 
‘‘the abuse or violation of some public 
trust.’’ 
A few years later, James Wilson, a 
Constitutional 
Convention 
delegate, 
agreed with Hamilton. 
Wilson stated: 
Impeachments, and offences and offenders 
impeachable, come not . . . within the 
sphere of ordinary jurisprudence. They are 
founded on different principles, governed by 
different maxims, and are directed to dif-
ferent objects. 
George Mason expressed concern that 
the President might abuse the pardon 
power to ‘‘screen from punishment 
those whom he had secretly instigated 
to commit the crime, and thereby pre-
vent a discovery of his own guilt.’’ 
Sound familiar? 
James Madison responded directly to 
Mason’s concern because Mason’s con-
cern was that the pardon power might 
be too broad and the President might 
misuse his broad pardon power to par-
don his own coconspirators and prevent 
a discovery of his own guilt. 
Madison responded: 
If the President be connected, in any sus-
picious manner, with any person, and there 
be grounds to believe he will shelter him, the 
House of Representatives can impeach him; 
they can remove him if found guilty. 
At the North Carolina ratifying con-
vention, James Iredell, who would go 
on to serve on the Supreme Court, re-
sponded to the same concern. He as-
sured delegates that if the President 
abused his power with ‘‘some corrupt 
motive or other,’’ he would be ‘‘liable 
for impeachment.’’ 
In the early 1800s, this understanding 
was echoed by Supreme Court Justice 
Story, who wrote a famous treatise on 
the Constitution. There, he rejected 
the equation of crimes and impeach-
able offenses, which, he stated, ‘‘must 
be examined upon very broad and com-
prehensive principles of public policy 
and duty.’’ 
Later in American history, Chief Jus-
tice and former President William 
Howard Taft, as well as Chief Justice 
Charles Evans Hughes, publicly stated 
that impeachable offenses are not lim-
ited to crimes but, instead, capture a 
broader range of misconduct. Indeed, 
under Chief Justice Taft, the Supreme 
Court 
unanimously 
observed 
that 
abuse of the President’s pardon power 
to frustrate the enforcement of court 
orders ‘‘would suggest resort to im-
peachment.’’ 
Now, 
notice, 
pardon 
power is unlimited. What they are say-
ing here is the abuse of the pardon 
power. Abuse of the pardon power for a 
corrupt motive is impeachable. 
If all of that authority is not enough 
to convince you, there is more. 
Historians have shown that Amer-
ican colonists before the Revolution 
and American States after the Revolu-
tion but before 1787 all impeached offi-
cials for noncriminal conduct. Over the 
past two centuries, moreover, a strong 
majority of the impeachments voted by 
the House have included one or more 
allegations that did not charge a viola-
tion of criminal law. Indeed, the Sen-
ate has convicted and removed mul-
tiple judges on noncriminal grounds. 
Judge Archbald was removed in 1912 
for noncriminal speculation in coal 
properties. 
Judge Ritter was removed in 1936 for 
the noncriminal offense of bringing his 
court ‘‘into scandal and disrepute.’’ 
During Judge Ritter’s case, one of my 
predecessors as chairman of the House 
Judiciary Committee stated expressly: 
‘‘We do not assume the responsibility

. . . of proving that the respondent is 
guilty of a crime as that term is known 
in criminal jurisprudence.’’ What is 
true for judges is also true for Presi-
dents, at least on this point. 
The House Judiciary Committee ap-
proved three Articles of Impeachment 
against President Nixon. Each of them 
encompassed many acts that did not 
violate Federal law. One of the arti-
cles—obstruction of Congress—involved 
no allegations of any legal violation. 
It is worth reflecting on why Presi-
dent Nixon was forced to resign. Most 
Americans are familiar with the story. 
The House Judiciary Committee ap-
proved Articles of Impeachment in 
July 1974. Those articles passed with 
bipartisan support, although most Re-
publicans stood by President Nixon. 
Then the smoking gun tape came 
out. Within a week, almost everyone 
who supported the President the week 
before changed his position, and the 
President was forced to resign because 
of what was revealed on the smoking 
gun tape. Within a week, Senator Gold-
water and others from the Senate went 
to the President and said: You won’t 
have a single vote in the Senate. You 
must resign, or you will be removed 
from office because of the evidence on 
the smoking gun tape. 
But what was on the smoking gun 
tape? The smoking gun tape had re-
cordings of President Nixon’s instruct-
ing White House officials to pressure 
the CIA and the FBI to end the Water-
gate investigation. No law explicitly 
prohibited that conversation—it was 
not, in that sense, a crime—but Presi-
dent Nixon had abused his power. He 
had tried to use two government agen-
cies—the FBI and the CIA—for his per-
sonal benefit. His impeachment and re-
moval were certain, and he announced 
his resignation within days. 
Decades later, in President Clinton’s 
case, the Judiciary Committee’s report 
on the Articles of Impeachment stated: 
‘‘The actions of President Clinton do 
not have to rise to the level of vio-
lating the federal statute regarding ob-
struction of justice in order to justify 
impeachment.’’ 
There is, thus, overwhelming author-
ity against restricting impeachments 
to violations of established or statu-
tory law. Every relevant principle of 
constitutional law compels that result. 
So does common sense. 
Impeachment is not a punishment for 
crimes. Impeachment exists to address 
threats to the political system, applies 
only to political officials, and responds 
not by imprisonment or fines but only 
by stripping political power. 
It would make no sense to say that a 
President 
who 
engages 
in 
horrific 
abuses must be allowed to remain in of-
fice unless Congress had anticipated 
his or her specific conduct in advance 
and written a statute expressly out-
lawing it. For one thing, that would be 
practically 
impossible. 
As 
Justice 
Story observed, the threats posed by 
Presidential abuse ‘‘are of so various 
and complex a character’’ that it would 
be ‘‘almost absurd’’ to attempt a com-
prehensive list. 
The Constitution is not a suicide 
pact. It does not leave us stuck with 
Presidents who abuse their power in 
unforeseen ways that threaten our se-
curity and democracy. 
Until recently it did not occur to me 
that our President would call a foreign 
leader and demand a sham investiga-
tion meant to kneecap his political op-
ponents, all in exchange for releasing 
vital military aid that the President 
was already required by law to provide. 
No one anticipated that a President 
would stoop to this misconduct, and 
Congress has passed no specific law to 
make this behavior a crime. 
Yet this is precisely the kind of 
abuse that the Framers had in mind 
when they wrote the impeachment 
clause and when they charged Congress 
with determining when the President’s 
conduct was so clearly wrong, so defi-
nitely beyond the pale, so threatening 
to the constitutional order as to re-
quire his removal, and that is why we 
are here today. 
You 
must 
judge 
for 
yourselves 
whether justice will be had for Presi-
dent Trump’s crimes against our free-
dom and the Constitution. 
I will conclude by highlighting a few 
points that merit special emphasis, as 
you apply the law of impeachment to 
President Trump’s misconduct. 
First, impeachment is not for petty 
offenses. The President’s conduct must 
constitute, as Mason put it, a great and 
dangerous offense against the Nation— 
offenses that threaten the Constitu-
tion. 
Second, impeachable offenses involve 
wrongdoing that reveal the President 
as a continuing threat if he is allowed 
to remain in office. In other words, we 
fully recognize that impeachment does 
not exist for a mistake. It does not 
apply to acts that are merely unwise or 
unpopular. Impeachment is reserved 
for deliberate decisions by the Presi-
dent to embark on a course of conduct 
that betrays his oath of office and does 
violence to the Constitution. 
When the President has engaged in 
such conduct, and when there is strong 
evidence that he will do so again— 
when he has told us he will do so again, 
when he has told us that it is OK to in-
vite interference from a foreign power 
into our next election—the case for re-
moval is at its peak. 
This is certainly the case when he in-
vites, indeed, attempts to compel a for-
eign government to help him subvert 
the integrity of our next election. 
There can be no greater threat to the 
Republic. 
Finally, 
high 
crimes 
and 
mis-
demeanors involve conduct that is rec-
ognizably wrong to a reasonable, hon-
orable citizen. The Framers adopted a 
standard for impeachment that could 
stand the test of time. At the same 
time, the structure of the Constitution 
implies 
that 
impeachable 
offenses 
should not come as a surprise. Im-
peachment is aimed at Presidents who 
act as if they are above the law, at 
Presidents who believe their own inter-
ests are more important than those of 
the Nation, and, thus, at Presidents 
who ignore right and wrong in pursuit 
of their own gain. 
Abuse, betrayal, corruption. Here are 
each of core offenses that the Framers 
feared most: The President’s abuse of 
power, his betrayal of the national in-
terest, and his corruption of our elec-
tions plainly qualify as great and dan-
gerous offenses. 
President Trump has made clear in 
word and deed that he will persist in 
such conduct if he is not removed from 
power. He poses a continuing threat to 
our Nation, to the integrity of our elec-
tions, and to our Democratic order. He 
must not remain in power one moment 
longer. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. 
Chief Justice, Senators, President’s 
counsel, we will now walk through the 
President’s abuse of power, the corrupt 
object of his scheme, his three official 
acts carrying out his scheme, his at-
tempted coverup and exposure, and the 
harm to our Nation and continuing 
threat caused by his misconduct. 
Let’s start first with the object of 
the President’s scheme. 
Senators, we have today provided 
handouts that you can follow along in 
our slides. 
So as this first slide indicates, in this 
portion of our presentation, we will 
discuss the evidence that shows over-
whelmingly that President Trump di-
rected this scheme with corrupt intent, 
with one corrupt objective: to obtain 
foreign assistance in his reelection bid 
in the 2020 United States Presidential 
election. 
We will walk through first how the 
President wanted Ukraine to help in 
his reelection campaign. He wanted 
Ukraine to publicly announce two in-
vestigations: one into his political 
rival Joe Biden and the second into the 
debunked conspiracy theory relating to 
Ukraine interference in the 2016 elec-
tion. President Trump himself later 
confirmed this intent in public state-
ments. 
We will then explain how we know 
these investigations were solely for 
President Trump’s personal, political 
gain. 
First, President Trump made clear he 
cared only about the announcement— 
the announcement of the investiga-
tions, not the actual investigations. 
Second, President Trump similarly 
made clear he cared only about the 
‘‘big stuff.’’ The ‘‘big stuff’’ meaning 
his political investigations. 
Third, he used his personal attorney, 
Mr. Giuliani, who repeatedly told us he 
was pursuing the investigations in his 
capacity as the President’s personal 
lawyer and that this wasn’t about for-
eign policy. 
Fourth and fifth, there is no real dis-
pute that these investigations were 
never part of an official U.S. policy, 
and they in fact went outside official 
channels. The Department of Justice

even publicly confirmed that they were 
never asked to talk to Ukraine about 
these investigations—never. 
Six, multiple officials who knew 
what was going on repeatedly reported 
these concerns to supervisors and even 
the NSC legal advisors. 
Seven, Ukraine expressed concerns 
multiple times that these were polit-
ical investigations and Ukraine didn’t 
want to get involved in domestic U.S. 
politics. 
Eight, the White House tried to bury 
the call. 
Nine, President Trump himself told 
us what he really wanted and cared 
about in his own words, in many public 
statements. 
And finally, despite the President’s 
counsel’s attempts to justify his ac-
tions, the evidence makes clear that 
President Trump did not care about 
anticorruption efforts in Ukraine. This 
was only about one thing: his political 
investigations. 
If you are following along on the 
slide, now, as I mentioned, the object 
of the President’s scheme is clear: two 
investigations to help his political re-
election. 
The Constitution grants the Presi-
dent broad authority to conduct U.S. 
foreign policy. He is our Commander in 
Chief and chief diplomat. When the 
President of the United States calls a 
foreign leader, a President’s first and 
only objective should be to get foreign 
leaders to do what is best for the U.S. 
national interest, consistent with the 
faithful execution of his oath of office 
and consistent with official U.S. policy. 
But on July 25, when President 
Trump called the President of Ukraine, 
President Trump did the opposite. In-
stead of following official U.S. talking 
points, instead of listening to his staff 
on what was important to our national 
interests, 
President 
Trump 
asked 
Ukraine for something that benefited 
only himself: his political investiga-
tions. And not only did these investiga-
tions diverge from U.S. national inter-
ests, 
as 
you 
will 
hear, 
President 
Trump’s actions harmed our national 
security. In putting himself above our 
country, he put our country at risk, 
and that is why his actions are so dan-
gerous. 
Now let’s take a moment and look 
carefully at the two investigations 
that President Trump sought from 
Ukraine, which are at the heart of the 
President’s scheme, and how he stood 
to benefit politically from Ukraine’s 
announcement of each. 
As you can see on the slide, the first 
investigation was, of course, of former 
Vice President Biden. Let’s go straight 
to that July 25 telephone call again 
where President Trump stated clearly 
each of these investigations he wanted. 
So let’s start with Vice President Joe 
Biden and the removal of a corrupt 
prosecutor in Ukraine. 
The first investigation related to 
former Vice President Joe Biden and 
the Ukrainian gas company Burisma 
Holdings, on whose board his son Hun-
ter Biden used to sit. 
President Trump himself summarized 
the theory behind his request in broad 
strokes in his July 25 call with Presi-
dent Zelensky. Here is what he said: 
The other thing, There’s a lot of talk about 
Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecu-
tion and a lot of people want to find out 
about that so that whatever you can do with 
the Attorney General would be great. Biden 
went around bragging that he stopped the 
prosecution so if you can look it . . . It 
sounds horrible to me. 
Now let’s look carefully at the inves-
tigation President Trump was asking 
for and what it was based on. In short, 
President Trump asked for the inves-
tigation into Biden based on a made-up 
theory that no one agreed with—no 
one. We will go into this in more de-
tail, but at a high level, the allegation 
is that late in 2015, Biden pressured 
Ukraine to remove the then-prosecutor 
general, Viktor Shokin, by threatening 
to withhold approximately $1 billion in 
loan guarantees if he was not removed. 
According to this theory, Vice Presi-
dent Biden did this in order to help his 
son in a company called Burisma. Vice 
President Biden’s son sat on the board 
of Burisma. 
As the theory goes, Vice President 
Biden tried to remove Ukraine’s pros-
ecutor, all to make sure the prosecutor 
wouldn’t investigate that specific com-
pany Burisma because, again, his son 
was on the board. 
Then, Senators, if that doesn’t sound 
farfetched and complicated to you, it 
should. So let’s take this step-by-step 
and start from the beginning. 
In 2014, Vice President Biden’s son 
Hunter joined the board of the Ukrain-
ian natural gas firm Burisma Holdings. 
At 
the 
time, 
Burisma’s 
owner, 
a 
Ukrainian oligarch and former govern-
ment minister, was under investiga-
tion. 
In 
2015, 
Viktor 
Shokin 
became 
Ukraine’s prosecutor general, a job 
similar to Attorney General in the 
United States. 
Although Shokin vowed to keep in-
vestigating Burisma amid an inter-
national push to root out corruption in 
Ukraine, he allowed the Burisma inves-
tigation to go dormant—allowed it to 
go dormant. That is when he was re-
moved. He was not actively inves-
tigating Burisma. He had let it go dor-
mant. Moreover, Shokin was widely 
perceived as ineffective and corrupt. 
George Kent, the second most senior 
official at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv at 
the time described Shokin as ‘‘a typ-
ical Ukraine prosecutor who lived a 
lifestyle far in excess of his govern-
ment salary, who never prosecuted 
anybody known for having committed 
a crime and covered up crimes that 
were known to have been committed.’’ 
In late 2015, Vice President Biden, 
who had assumed a significant role in 
U.S. policy toward Ukraine, publicly 
called for the removal of Mr. Shokin 
because of his failure—his failure—to 
adequately combat corruption. But 
Vice President Biden wasn’t alone. The 
European Union, our European allies, 
the International Monetary Fund, and 
three reformers inside Ukraine also 
wanted Mr. Shokin removed to reform 
the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s of-
fice—to reform it. 
Reforming the prosecutor general’s 
office was also supported on a bipar-
tisan basis by the Ukrainian Caucus 
here in the Senate. On February 12, 
2016, after Vice President Biden had 
urged removal of Mr. Shokin but before 
the Ukrainian Parliament voted to re-
move him, a bipartisan group of Sen-
ators, including Senators PORTMAN, 
DURBIN, SHAHEEN, RON JOHNSON, MUR-
PHY, KIRK, BLUMENTHAL, and SHERROD 
BROWN
sent a letter to President 
Poroshenko that urged him to make 
urgent reforms to the prosecutor gen-
eral’s office. The month after the Sen-
ators sent that letter, Mr. Shokin was 
fired. He was fired. 
So let’s be very clear. Vice President 
Biden called for the removal of this 
prosecutor at the official direction of 
U.S. policy, because the prosecutor was 
widely perceived as corrupt, and with 
the support of all of our international 
allies. His actions were therefore sup-
ported by the executive branch, Con-
gress, and the international commu-
nity. 
Common sense would tell us that this 
allegation against Joe Biden is false 
and that there was no legitimate basis 
for any investigation. But there are 
several other reasons you know that 
the only reason President Trump want-
ed Ukraine to announce the investiga-
tion into Biden was solely for his very 
own personal benefit. 
If you look at the slide, we will sum-
marize some points. 
First, none of the 17 witnesses in the 
House’s inquiry said there was any fac-
tual basis for this allegation—not 1 of 
the 17. To the contrary, they testified 
it was false. 
Second, as I mentioned, the former 
prosecutor 
general 
Vice 
President 
Biden tried to remove was widely con-
sidered to be corrupt and failed to in-
vestigate corruption in Ukraine. Thus, 
removing him from office would only 
increase the chances that Burisma 
would be investigated for possible cor-
ruption. 
Third, because the prosecutor was so 
corrupt, Vice President Biden calling 
for his removal was also at the direc-
tion of official U.S. policy and under-
taken with the unanimous support of 
our allies. 
Fourth, the successor to the fired 
Ukrainian prosecutor general admitted 
that Vice President Biden’s son didn’t 
do anything wrong in connection with 
Burisma. So the entire premise of the 
investigation that the President want-
ed Ukraine to pursue was simply false. 
Finally, President Trump didn’t care 
about any of this until 2019, when Vice 
President 
Biden 
became 
the 
frontrunner for the Democratic Presi-
dential nomination and polls showed 
that he had the largest head-to-head 
lead against President Trump. That be-
came a problem.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S495 
January 23, 2020 
Let’s start with the first and second 
points. Vice President Biden’s conduct 
was uniformly validated by the wit-
nesses in the House investigation, who 
confirmed his conduct was consistent 
with U.S. policy. Every single witness 
who was asked about the allegations 
against Biden said it was false. They 
testified that he acted properly. Every 
witness with knowledge of this issue 
testified that Vice President Biden was 
carrying out official U.S. policy in call-
ing 
for 
Shokin’s 
removal 
because 
Shokin was corrupt. These witnesses 
explained, too, that the United States 
was not alone in this view. All of our 
European allies also supported this ac-
tion. There is simply no evidence— 
nothing, nada—in the record to support 
this baseless allegation. 
I would like to go through some of 
that testimony now. 
First, here are Dr. Hill and Mr. 
Holmes: Let’s watch. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Dr. Hill, are you aware of 
any evidence to support the allegations 
against Vice President Biden? 
Dr. HILL. I am not, no. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And, in fact, Mr. Holmes, 
the former prosecutor general of Ukraine 
who Vice President Biden encouraged to fire 
was actually corrupt; is that right? 
Mr. HOLMES. Correct. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And was not pursuing cor-
ruption 
investigations 
and 
prosecutions; 
right? 
Mr. HOLMES. My understanding is that 
the prosecutor general at the time, Shokin, 
was not at that time pursuing investigations 
of Burisma or the Bidens. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And, in fact, removing 
that prosecutor general was part of the 
United States’ anticorruption policy; isn’t 
that correct? 
Mr. HOLMES. That’s correct. And not just 
us but all of our allies and other institutions 
who were involved in Ukraine at the time. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Am-
bassador Yovanovitch confirmed these 
points. Let’s watch her testify. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And in fact, when Vice 
President Biden acted to remove the former 
corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine, did he do so 
as part of official United States policy? 
Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. Official U.S. 
policy that was endorsed and was the policy 
of a number of other international stake-
holders, other countries, other monetary in-
stitutions, and financial institutions. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Simi-
larly, when asked if there was any fac-
tual basis to support the allegations 
about Biden, George Kent replied, 
‘‘None whatsoever.’’ 
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and Ms. 
Williams also confirmed that they are 
not aware of any credible evidence to 
support the notion that Vice President 
Biden did anything wrong. Ambassador 
Volker testified that the Biden allega-
tions were not credible and that Biden 
‘‘respects his duties of higher office.’’ 
Now, as I mentioned, there was also a 
concrete reason that the U.S. Govern-
ment wanted Shokin removed. As 
David Holmes, a senior official at the 
U.S. Embassy in Ukraine testified, by 
the time that Shokin was finally re-
moved in 2016, there were strong con-
cerns that Shokin was himself corrupt 
and not investigating potential corrup-
tion in the country. In fact, part of the 
concern was that Shokin was not in-
vestigating Burisma. Under Shokin, 
the investigation into the owner of 
Burisma for earlier conduct had stalled 
and was dormant. That was part of the 
reason why the United States and 
other countries wanted to remove 
Shokin. 
Because of this, and as confirmed by 
witness testimony we will hear shortly, 
calling for Shokin’s replacement would 
actually increase the chances that 
Burisma would be investigated. In 
other words, Shokin was corrupt and 
not 
investigating 
allegations 
that 
Burisma was corrupt, and so Vice 
President Biden calling for Shokin’s 
removal and advocating for his replace-
ment would actually increase chances 
of Burisma’s investigation. 
Ambassador Yovanovitch made this 
point during her testimony. Let’s lis-
ten. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And, in fact, if he would 
help to remove a corrupt Ukrainian pros-
ecutor general who was not prosecuting 
enough corruption, that would increase the 
chances that corrupt companies in Ukraine 
would be investigated; isn’t that right? 
Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. One would 
think so. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And that would include 
Burisma; right? 
Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. Yes. 
Ms. 
Manager 
GARCIA 
of 
Texas. 
President Trump and his allies have 
tried to justify President Trump’s 
withholding of military aid and a 
White House meeting unless Ukraine 
announced the investigations he want-
ed by saying it is the same thing the 
Vice President did when he called for 
Ukraine to remove its corrupt pros-
ecutor. It is not the same thing. As you 
just heard, Vice President Biden fol-
lowed official U.S. policy. He went 
through official channels to remove the 
prosecutor that was corrupt, and he did 
it with the support of our allies. That 
is the exact opposite of what President 
Trump did. He pushed Ukraine for an 
investigation that has no basis, that no 
one agreed with, that was not at all 
U.S. policy, and that only benefited 
him. 
George Kent addressed this very 
point during his testimony. Let’s lis-
ten. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. HIMES. And Mr. Kent and Mr. Taylor, 
the defenders of the President’s behavior, 
have made a big deal out of the fact that 
Vice President Biden encouraged the Ukrain-
ians to remove a corrupt former Ukrainian 
prosecutor in 2016, Mr. Shokin. And, in fact, 
Senator RAND PAUL on Sunday said, and I 
quote him, ‘‘They’re impeaching President 
Trump for exactly the same thing Joe Biden 
did.’’ Is that correct? Is what the President 
did in his phone call and what Joe Biden did 
in terms of Mr. Shokin, are those exactly the 
same things? And if not, how are they dif-
ferent? 
Mr. KENT. I do not think they are the 
same things. What former Vice President 
Biden requested of the former President of 
Ukraine, Poroshenko, was the removal of a 
corrupt prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, 
who had undermined a program of assistance 
that we had spent, again, U.S. taxpayer 
money to try to build an independent inves-
tigator unit to go after corrupt prosecutors. 
And there was a case called Diamond Pros-
ecutor case in which Shokin destroyed the 
entire ecosystem that we were trying to help 
create, the investigators, the judges who 
issued the warrants, the law enforcement 
that had warrants to do the wiretapping, ev-
erybody to protect his former driver who he 
had made a prosecutor. That’s why Joe 
Biden was asking, remove the corrupt pros-
ecutor. 
Mr. HIMES. So Joe Biden was partici-
pating in an open effort to establish whole of 
government effort to address corruption in 
Ukraine? 
Mr. KENT. That is correct. 
Mr. HIMES. Great. So, Mr. Kent, as you 
look at this whole mess, Rudy Giuliani, 
President Trump, in your opinion, was this a 
comprehensive and whole government effort 
to end corruption in Ukraine? 
Mr. KENT. Referring to the requests in 
July? 
Mr. HIMES. Exactly. 
Mr. KENT. I would not say so. No, sir. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. In 
short, the allegations against Vice 
President Biden are groundless. So 
there is no comparison—none at all— 
between what he did and President 
Trump’s abuse of power. 
Now let’s turn to the third point. 
Part of the allegation against former 
Vice President Biden is that he pushed 
for the corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor’s 
removal in order to protect his son 
from the investigation. In fact, the 
President’s claim about being con-
cerned about corruption in Ukraine has 
recently emphasized this component of 
the theory: that the President wanted 
Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden’s 
work on the board of Burisma, not the 
former Vice President. 
This, too, is false—simply false. You 
need look no further than the July 25 
call record and the President’s own 
statements to see that the President 
wanted the Ukrainians to investigate 
Vice President Biden. 
Let’s look again at what the Presi-
dent’s call said. 
The other thing, there is a lot of talk 
about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the 
prosecution and a lot of people want to find 
out about that, so whatever you can do with 
the Attorney General would be great. Biden 
went around bragging that he stopped the 
prosecution, so if you can look into it. It 
sounds horrible to me. 
The President was clearly asking 
President Zelensky to investigate Joe 
Biden. And what did the President say 
on the White House lawn on October 3, 
when he was asked about the Ukrain-
ian scheme? 
He said: 
Well, I think if they were honest about it, 
you saw the film yesterday, they would start 
a major investigation into the Bidens. It is a 
very simple answer. 
He said the Bidens, plural, not one 
Biden—the Bidens. 
It is clear what the President wanted 
from Ukraine: an investigation to 
smear his political rival. But even if 
the President wanted an investigation

January 23, 2020 
of Hunter Biden, there is no basis for 
that either. 
Now, 
how 
do 
you 
know? 
Well, 
Ukraine’s former prosecutor general 
admitted that the allegation against 
Vice President Biden’s son was plainly 
false. You can see it on the slide in his 
own 
words—‘‘plainly 
false.’’ 
Then- 
Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy 
Lutsenko recanted his earlier allega-
tions and confirmed: ‘‘Biden was defi-
nitely not involved in any wrongdoing 
involving Burisma.’’ 
So even the Ukrainians believed that 
Biden’s son did nothing wrong. The 
long and short of it is that there was 
no basis for the investigation that the 
President was pursuing and pushing— 
none. He was doing it only for his own 
political benefit. 
Let’s look at one more important 
reason why it is clear that President 
Trump simply wanted a political ben-
efit from Ukraine’s announcement of 
this 
investigation 
and 
didn’t 
care 
about the underlying conduct. The al-
legations against Vice President Biden 
were based on events that occurred in 
late 2015 and early 2016. They were all 
well publicized at the time, but as soon 
as President Trump took office, he in-
creased military support to Ukraine in 
2017 and the next year, 2018. 
It wasn’t until 2019, over 3 years after 
Vice 
President 
Biden 
called 
for 
Shokin’s removal—3 years after—that 
President 
Trump 
started 
pushing 
Ukraine to investigate that conduct. 
So what changed? What changed? 
Why did President Trump not care at 
all about Biden’s request on the re-
moval of Shokin the year after it hap-
pened in 2017 or the next year in 2018? 
Senators, you know what changed in 
2019 when President Trump suddenly 
cared. It is that Biden got in the race. 
On April 25, Vice President Biden an-
nounced he would run for President in 
2020. If President Trump was so con-
cerned about this alleged corruption, 
why didn’t he push Ukraine to inves-
tigate when he entered office in 2017 or 
in 2018 after Biden gave public remarks 
about how he pressured Ukraine to re-
move 
Shokin? 
Why 
did 
President 
Trump instead wait until former Vice 
President Biden was campaigning for 
the Democratic nomination? 
Senators, 
it 
is 
obvious: 
because 
President Trump wanted to hurt Vice 
President Biden’s candidacy and help 
himself politically. He pushed for the 
investigation in 2019 because that is 
when it would be valuable to him, 
President Trump. He pushed for it 
when it started to become clear that 
Vice President Biden could beat him, 
and he had good reason to be con-
cerned. 
Let’s look at the slide about some 
polls. Throughout this scheme, polling 
had consistently shown the former 
Vice President handily beating Presi-
dent Trump by significant margins in 
head-to-head matchups. The chart on 
the screen shows FOX News polls em-
phasizing this point. The chart shows 
that from March to December, Vice 
President Biden had consistently led 
President Trump in national polls by 
significant 
margins. 
So 
beginning 
around March, Vice President Biden is 
beating the President in the polls, even 
on FOX News. 
In April, Biden officially announces 
his candidacy, and that is when the 
President gets worried. In May, the 
President’s personal lawyer tells the 
press that he is planning to travel to 
Ukraine to urge newly elected Presi-
dent Zelensky to conduct the two in-
vestigations—one into Vice President 
Biden. Do you know what else hap-
pened in May? A FOX News poll showed 
Biden beating Trump by 11 points. This 
clearly did not go unnoticed. 
On May 9, the President’s personal 
lawyer, Mr. Giuliani, said in an inter-
view: ‘‘I guarantee you, Joe Biden will 
not get to election day without this 
being investigated.’’ And by July, right 
before President Trump’s call with 
President Zelensky, where he asked for 
the investigation into Biden, the FOX 
News poll showed Biden beating Trump 
by 10 points. Then, on July 25, after 
years of not caring what the Vice 
President did, does President Trump 
ask for an investigation in his formi-
dable political rival in the 2020 elec-
tion. 
Senators, looking at this timeline of 
events, it is not difficult to see why the 
investigation into the Bidens would be 
helpful to President Trump. The mere 
announcement of such an investigation 
would immediately tarnish the former 
Vice President’s reputation by embroil-
ing him and his son in a foreign crimi-
nal investigation—even if the charges 
were never pursued, just the mere an-
nouncement. And if a foreign country 
announced a formal investigation into 
those allegations, it would give allega-
tions against the Bidens an air of credi-
bility and could carry through the elec-
tion. 
The 
evidence 
is 
clear. 
Everyone 
knew—even Ukraine—that there was 
no merit to the allegation that Biden 
called for the removal of Shokin for 
any illegitimate reason. Biden asked 
for it because it was consistent—con-
sistent 
with 
U.S. 
policy 
because 
Shokin was corrupt, and it was with 
the backing of our allies. Even Presi-
dent Trump knew there was no basis 
for this investigation. That is why, for 
years, after Shokin’s removal, he con-
tinued to support Ukraine. He never 
once raised the issue. 
It wasn’t until Biden began beating 
him in the polls that he called for the 
investigation. 
The 
President 
asked 
Ukraine for this investigation for one 
reason and one reason only: because he 
knew it would be damaging to an oppo-
nent who was consistently beating him 
in the polls and therefore it could help 
him get reelected in 2020. President 
Trump had the motive, he had the op-
portunity, and the means to commit 
this abuse of power. 
Now, let’s turn to the second inves-
tigation that President Trump wanted. 
What he wanted was a widely debunked 
conspiracy theory that Ukraine—rath-
er than Russia—interfered in the 2016 
U.S. 
election 
to 
benefit 
President 
Trump’s opponent. As we will explain, 
the allegation that Ukraine interfered 
in the 2016 elections, just like the alle-
gation that Biden improperly removed 
the Ukraine prosecutor, has absolutely 
no basis in fact. In fact, this theory ig-
nored the unanimous conclusions of 
the U.S. intelligence agency, the con-
gressional 
Intelligence 
Committees, 
and Special Counsel Mueller, which 
found that Russia—Russia attacked 
our elections. It also went against the 
Senate Intelligence Committee report 
which found no evidence supporting 
that Ukraine attacked our elections, 
nor did any witness support the theory 
that Ukraine attacked our elections. 
Indeed, even President Trump’s own 
advisers told him the claim was false. 
In fact, the one person who told 
President Trump his theory is true— 
who was it? You know it was our adver-
sary, Russia, which had everything to 
gain by deflecting the blame from their 
attack on Ukraine. 
Let’s look at what President Trump 
was actually suggesting Ukraine inves-
tigate. The theory is this: Instead of 
listening to our entire intelligence 
community that concluded that Russia 
interfered in our 2016 election to assist 
Donald Trump, the new theory says it 
was Ukraine that interfered in the 
election to help Hillary Clinton and 
hurt Donald Trump. 
One aspect of this conspiracy theory 
was that the American cyber security 
firm, CrowdStrike, which had helped 
the DNC respond to Russia’s cyber at-
tack in 2016, moved a DNC server to 
Ukraine to prevent the FBI from exam-
ining it. Here is what President Trump 
said about this conspiracy theory dur-
ing the July 25 call. 
I would like you to find out what happened 
with this whole situation with Ukraine, they 
say Crowdstrike . . . I guess you have one of 
your wealthy people . . . The server, they 
say Ukraine has it. 
Once again, if this sounds farfetched 
and crazy, it should because it is. 
There is simply no factual basis to sup-
port this conspiracy theory. Let’s walk 
through the concrete reasons why. 
First, as I mentioned, our entire U.S. 
intelligence community, the Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence, and 
Special Counsel Mueller all unani-
mously 
found 
that 
Russia—not 
Ukraine—interfered in the 2016 elec-
tions, and Russia did it to help Donald 
Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton. Here 
is an example of that. 
This is the conclusion of the Director 
of National Intelligence’s report enti-
tled ‘‘Assessing Russian Activities and 
Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections.’’ I 
will quote part of it, and you can fol-
low along in the slide. 
We assess Russian President Vladimir 
Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 
aimed at the U.S. Presidential election. Rus-
sia’s goals were to undermine public faith in 
the US democratic process, denigrate Sec-
retary Clinton, and harm her electability 
and potential Presidency. We further assess

Putin and the Russian Government devel-
oped a clear preference for President-elect 
Trump. We have high confidence in these 
judgments. 
‘‘Clear preference for President-elect 
Trump.’’ And here is the conclusion of 
the Senate Select Committee on Intel-
ligence: 
The Committee found that the [Russian- 
based Internet Research Agency] sought to 
influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election 
by harming Hillary Clinton’s chances of suc-
cess and supporting Donald Trump at the di-
rection of the Kremlin . . . The Committee 
found that the Russian government tasked 
and supported the IRA’s interference in the 
2016 U.S. election. 
‘‘Supporting Donald Trump at the di-
rection of the Kremlin’’—that is what 
it said. And here is the special coun-
sel’s conclusion Mueller reported in 
2019: 
As set forth in detail in this report, the 
Special Counsel’s investigation established 
that Russia interfered in the 2016 presi-
dential election principally through two op-
erations. First, a Russia entity carried out a 
social media campaign that favored presi-
dential candidate Donald J. Trump and dis-
paraged presidential candidate Hillary Clin-
ton. Second, a Russian intelligence service 
conducted 
computer-intrusion 
operations 
against entities, employees, and volunteers 
working on the Clinton Campaign and then 
released stolen documents. 
On December 9, 2019, even President 
Trump’s own FBI Director Christopher 
Wray stated unequivocally that there 
is no evidence to support the theory 
that Ukraine interfered in our election 
in 2016. 
Here is a video of that interview. 
Let’s watch. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
REPORTER. 
Did 
the 
Government 
of 
Ukraine directly interfere in the 2016 elec-
tion on the scale that the Russians did? 
Director WRAY. We have no information 
that indicates that Ukraine interfered with 
the 2016 presidential election. 
REPORTER. When you see politicians 
pushing this notion, are you concerned about 
that in terms of its impact on the American 
public? 
Director WRAY. Well, look, there’s all 
kinds of people saying all kinds of things out 
there. I think it’s important for the Amer-
ican people to be thoughtful consumers of in-
formation and to think about the sources of 
it and to think about the support and predi-
cation for what they hear. And I think part 
of us being well protected against malign 
foreign influence is to build together an 
American public that’s resilient, that has ap-
propriate media literacy, and that takes its 
information with a grain of salt. 
REPORTER. And Putin has been pushing 
this theory. And your message to him in 
terms of the American public? 
Director WRAY. Stop trying to interfere 
with our elections. 
REPORTER. And we recently heard from 
the President himself that he wanted the 
CrowdStrike portion of this whole con-
spiracy in the Ukraine investigated, and I’m 
hearing you say there’s no evidence to sup-
port that as far as you know. 
Director WRAY. As I said, we have no—We 
at the FBI have no information that would 
indicate that Ukraine tried to interfere in 
the 2016 presidential election. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. You 
heard him. He said ‘‘no information 
that would indicate that Ukraine tried 
to interfere in the 2016 Presidential 
election.’’ 
So to be really, really clear, there is 
no 
real 
dispute 
that 
Russia, 
not 
Ukraine, attacked our elections. 
It is not just that there is no evi-
dence to support his conspiracy theory; 
it is more dangerous than that. Where 
did 
this 
theory 
come 
from? 
You 
guessed it. The Russians—Russia. Rus-
sian President Vladimir Putin and Rus-
sian intelligence services perpetuated 
this false, debunked conspiracy theory. 
Now remember, there is no dispute 
among the intelligence community 
that Russia attacked our 2016 elec-
tions. The Senate’s own Intelligence 
Committee published a report telling 
us that as well. So it is no surprise that 
Russia wants to blame somebody else. 
In fact, President Trump even said 
that President Putin is the one who 
told him it was Ukraine who interfered 
in our elections. 
In short, this is a theory that the 
Russians are promoting to interfere, 
yet again, in our democratic process 
and deflect blame from their own at-
tacks against us. But what is so dan-
gerous is that President Trump is help-
ing them perpetuate this. Our own 
President is helping our adversary at-
tack our processes, all to help his own 
reelection. 
Dr. Hill, an expert on these matters, 
explains it in more detail as to why 
this is very concerning. Let’s watch. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Dr. HILL. This relates to the second thing 
I want to communicate. Based on questions 
and statements I have heard, some of you on 
the committee appear to believe that Russia 
and its security services did not conduct a 
campaign against our country and that per-
haps somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did. 
This is a fictional narrative that is being 
perpetrated and propagated by the Russian 
security services themselves. 
The unfortunate truth is that Russia was 
the foreign power that systematically at-
tacked our democratic institutions in 2016. 
This is the public conclusion of our intel-
ligence agencies, confirmed in bipartisan and 
congressional reports. It is beyond dispute, 
even if some of the underlying details must 
remain classified. 
The impact of the successful 2016 Russian 
campaign remains evident today. Our nation 
is being torn apart. Truth is questioned. Our 
highly professional, expert career Foreign 
Service is being undermined. U.S. support for 
Ukraine which continues to face armed Rus-
sian aggression is being politicized. The Rus-
sian Government’s goal is to weaken our 
country, to diminish America’s global role, 
and to neutralize a perceived U.S. threat to 
Russian interests. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Their 
‘‘goal is to weaken our country, to di-
minish America’s global role, and to 
neutralize a perceived U.S. threat to 
Russian interests.’’ That is why it is so 
dangerous. Despite the lack of any evi-
dence to support this debunked con-
spiracy theory, the unanimous conclu-
sion of the intelligence community, 
Congress, Special Counsel Mueller, and 
the FBI to the contrary, President 
Trump continued to promote this fake 
conspiracy 
theory 
just 
because 
it 
would be beneficial and helpful to his 
own reelection campaign. 
Even President Trump’s own senior 
advisers told him these allegations 
were false. Tom Bossert, President 
Trump’s former Homeland Security 
Advisor, 
stated 
publicly 
that 
the 
CrowdStrike 
theory 
had 
been 
de-
bunked. 
Here is that interview. Let’s watch. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. BOSSERT. It’s not only a conspiracy 
theory, it is completely debunked. You 
know, I don’t know want to be glib about 
this matter, but last year, retired former 
Senator Judd Gregg wrote a piece in The Hill 
magazine saying the three ways or the five 
ways to impeach oneself. And the third way 
was to hire Rudy Giuliani. 
And at this point, I am deeply frustrated 
with what he and the legal team is doing in 
repeating that debunked theory to the presi-
dent. It sticks in his mind when he hears it 
over and over again. And for clarity here, 
George, let me just again repeat that it has 
no validity. The United States government 
reached its conclusion on attributing to Rus-
sia the DNC hack in 2016 before it even com-
municated it to the FBI and long before the 
FBI ever knocked on the door at the DNC. So 
a server inside the DNC was not relevant to 
our determination to the attribution. It was 
made upfront and beforehand. And so while 
servers can be important in some of the in-
vestigations that followed, it has nothing to 
do with the U.S. government’s attribution of 
Russia to the DNC hack. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. The 
theory ‘‘has no validity.’’ That is what 
he said. 
Dr. Hill, too, testified that White 
House officials, including Mr. Bossert 
and former National Security Advisor 
H.R. McMaster spent a lot of time re-
futing the CrowdStrike conspiracy the-
ory to President Trump. Let’s hear it. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Daniel GOLDMAN. Now, Dr. Hill, is this a 
reference to this debunked conspiracy theory 
about Ukraine interference in the 2016 elec-
tion that you discussed in your opening 
statement as well as with Chairman SCHIFF? 
Fiona HILL. The reference to CrowdStrike 
and the server, yes, that’s correct. 
Daniel GOLDMAN. And it is your under-
standing that there is no basis for these alle-
gations, is that correct? 
Fiona HILL. That’s correct. 
Daniel GOLDMAN. Now, isn’t it also true 
that some of President Trump’s most senior 
advisors had informed him that this theory 
of Ukraine interference in the 2016 election 
was false? 
Fiona HILL. That’s correct. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. When 
she was asked if it is false, she said: 
‘‘That’s correct.’’ 
If Vladimir Putin’s goals, as Dr. Hill 
testified, were to deflect from Russia’s 
systematic interference in our election 
and to drive a wedge between the 
United States and Ukraine, he has suc-
ceeded beyond his wildest dreams. The 
alternative narrative of Ukrainian in-
terference in the 2016 election has now 
been picked up by the President’s de-
fenders and the conservative media. It 
has muddied the waters regarding Rus-
sia’s own interference in our elec-
tions—efforts that remain ongoing, as 
we have learned this week from report-
ing that Russia hacked Burisma.

January 23, 2020 
If there were any doubt about how 
President Putin feels about the Presi-
dent’s conduct, you need only look to 
Putin’s own words. His statement on 
November 20 tells it all. He said: 
Thank God nobody is accusing us anymore 
of interfering in U.S. elections. Now they’re 
accusing Ukraine. 
That is a short quotation from Putin, 
but it speaks volumes. Even though 
President Trump knew there was no 
factual basis for the theory that it was 
Ukraine that interfered in the 2016 
election rather than Russia and knew 
that Russia was perpetuating this the-
ory, he still wanted President Zelensky 
to pursue the investigation. Why? Be-
cause, while Putin and Russia clearly 
stood to gain by promoting this con-
spiracy theory about Ukraine, so did 
Donald Trump. He knew it would be po-
litically helpful to his 2020 election. 
An announcement of an investigation 
by Ukraine would have breathed new 
life into a debunked conspiracy theory 
that Ukrainian election interference 
was there in 2016, and it lent it great 
credibility. It would have cast doubt on 
the conclusions of the Intelligence 
Committee 
and 
Special 
Counsel 
Mueller that Russia interfered in the 
2016 election to help President Trump. 
And it would have helped eliminate a 
perceived threat to the legitimacy of 
Donald Trump’s Presidency, that he 
was only elected because of the help he 
received from President Putin. 
I now yield to Mr. SCHIFF. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
f 
RECESS SUBJECT TO CALL OF THE 
CHAIR 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I am going to recommend that we take 
a 15-minute break at this point. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objec-
tion, it is so ordered. 
There being no objection, at 2:57 p.m. 
the Senate, sitting as a Court of Im-
peachment, recessed until 3:25 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Manager 
SCHIFF. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, I am 
going to pick up where my colleague 
from Texas left off, but I want to begin 
by underscoring a few of the points 
that she made, in listening to her pres-
entation, that really leapt out at me in 
a way they hadn’t leapt out at me be-
fore. 
First, I want to address—my col-
league shared a number of slides show-
ing the polling strength of Joe Biden 
vis-a-vis the President as a demonstra-
tion of his motive, the fact that he 
went over these political investiga-
tions to undermine someone he was 
deeply concerned about. 
This is an appropriate point for me to 
make the disclaimer that the House 
managers take no position in the 
Democratic primary for President. I 
don’t want to lose a single more vote 
than necessary. But those polls do 
show the powerful motive that Donald 
Trump had—a motive that he didn’t 
have the year before or the year before 
that; a motive that he didn’t have 
when he allowed the aid to go to 
Ukraine without complaint or issue in 
2017 or 2018. It was only when he had a 
growing concern with Joe Biden’s can-
didacy that he took a sudden interest 
in Ukraine and Ukraine funding and 
the withholding of that aid. 
I also want to underscore what the 
President said in that July 25 call. My 
colleague showed you that transcript 
from July 25 where the President says: 
‘‘I would like you to find out what hap-
pened with this whole situation with 
Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike.’’ My 
colleagues have explained what that 
theory is about that server, that 
CrowdStrike server—the crazy theory 
that it was Ukraine that hacked the 
Democratic server and that server was 
whisked away to Ukraine and hidden 
there so that the investigators and the 
FBI couldn’t look at this server. That 
is what Donald Trump was raising in 
that 
conversation 
with 
President 
Zelensky. 
I bring up this point again because 
you may hear from my colleagues, the 
President’s lawyers, as we heard during 
the testimony in the House, that the 
concern was over Ukrainian inter-
ference in the election, and why isn’t it 
possible that both Russia and Ukraine 
interfered in the election? Never mind 
that is contrary to all the evidence. 
But it is important to point out here 
that we are not talking about generic 
interference. We are not talking about, 
as we heard from some of my col-
leagues in the House, a tweet from a 
Ukrainian here or an op-ed written by 
somebody there and equating it with 
the kind of systematic interference of 
the Russians. What we are talking 
about here—what the President is talk-
ing about here is a very specific con-
spiracy theory going to the server 
itself, meaning that it was Ukraine 
that hacked the Democratic server, not 
the Russians. This theory was brought 
to you by the Kremlin, OK? So we are 
not talking about generic interference. 
We are talking about the server. We 
are talking about CrowdStrike. At 
least, that is what Donald Trump want-
ed to investigate or announced—this 
completely bogus, Kremlin-pushed con-
spiracy theory. 
I was also struck by that video you 
saw of Tom Bossert, the former home-
land security adviser for the President, 
in which he talked about how com-
pletely debunked and crazy this con-
spiracy theory is. And then there was 
that rather glib line that he admitted 
was glib, but nonetheless made a point, 
about the three or five ways to im-
peach oneself, and the third way was to 
hire Rudy Giuliani. 
Now, it struck me in watching that 
clip, again, that it is important to em-
phasize that Rudy Giuliani is not some 
Svengali here who has the President 
under his control. There may be an ef-
fort to say: OK, the human hand gre-
nade, Rudy Giuliani, it is all his fault. 
He has the President in his grip. 
And even though the U.S. intel-
ligence agencies and the bipartisan 
Senate Intelligence Committee and ev-
eryone else told the President time 
after time that this is nonsense, that 
the 
Russians 
interfered, 
not 
the 
Ukrainians, he just couldn’t shake 
himself of what he was hearing from 
Rudy Giuliani. You can say a lot of 
things about President Trump, but he 
is not led by the nose by Rudy Giuliani. 
And if he is willing to listen to his per-
sonal lawyer over his own intelligence 
agencies, his own advisers, then you 
can imagine what a danger that pre-
sents to this country. 
My colleague also played for you that 
interview with Director Wray. And, 
again, I was just struck anew by that 
interview. In that interview, Director 
Wray says: ‘‘We have no information 
that indicates that Ukraine interfered 
with the 2016 presidential election.’’ 
That is Donald Trump’s Director of the 
FBI: ‘‘We have no information that in-
dicates that Ukraine interfered with 
the 2016 election’’—none, as in zero. 
The reporter then says: When you see 
politicians pushing this notion, are you 
concerned about that in terms of the 
impact on the American public? 
And the Director says: ‘‘Well, look, 
there’s all kinds of people saying all 
kinds of things out there.’’ 
Well, yes, there are, but this person 
is the President of the United States. 
When he says ‘‘there are all kinds of 
people out there saying all kinds of 
things,’’ well, what he is really saying 
is the President of the United States. 
It is one thing if someone off the 
streets says it, but when it is coming 
from the President of the United 
States, you can see what a danger it is 
if it is patently false and it is promul-
gated by the Russians. 
And, again, the reporter says: We 
heard from the President, himself, he 
wanted the CrowdStrike portion of this 
whole conspiracy investigated, and I 
am hearing you say there is no evi-
dence to support this. 
And Wray says: ‘‘As I said, we at the 
FBI have no information that would in-
dicate that Ukraine tried to interfere 
in the 2016 presidential election’’— 
none. 
And so you can imagine the view 
from the Kremlin of all of this. You 
can imagine Putin in the Kremlin with 
his aides, and one of his aides comes 
into the office and says: Vladimir, you 
are never going to believe this. The 
President of the United States is push-
ing our CrowdStrike theory. 
I mean, you can almost imagine the 
incredulity of Vladimir Putin: You are 
kidding; right? You mean he really be-
lieves this? His own people don’t be-
lieve this. Nobody believes this. 
It would be bad enough, of course, 
that the President of the United States 
believes 
this 
Russian 
propaganda 
against the advice of all of his advis-
ers—common 
sense—and 
everything

else, but it is worse than that. It is 
worse than that. On the basis of this 
Russian propaganda, he withheld $400 
million in military aid to a nation Rus-
sia was fighting, our ally. I mean, when 
we ask about what is the national secu-
rity implication of what the President 
did, how much more clear can it be 
that he is not only pushing Russian 
propaganda, he is not only misleading 
Americans about who interfered in the 
last election, that he is not only doing 
the Kremlin a favor, but that he is 
withholding aid from a nation at war. 
The Russians not only got him to de-
flect blame from their interference in 
our democracy, but they got him to 
withhold military aid. 
Now, of course, there was this con-
vergence of interest between the Krem-
lin and the President. The President 
wasn’t pushing Kremlin talking points 
just to do Vladimir Putin a favor. He 
was doing it because it helped him, be-
cause it helped him and because it 
could get these talking points for him 
in his reelection campaign. And for 
that, he would sacrifice our ally and 
our own security. 
But nothing struck me more from 
Representative GARCIA’s presentation 
than that quote from Vladimir Putin 
from November of this past year, just a 
couple of months ago. Putin said: 
Thank God nobody is accusing us anymore 
of interfering in U.S. elections. Now they’re 
accusing Ukraine. 
‘‘Thank God,’’ Putin says. Well, you 
have to give Donald Trump credit for 
this. He has made a religious man out 
of Vladimir Putin, but I don’t think we 
really want Vladimir Putin, our adver-
sary, to be thanking God for the Presi-
dent of the United States, because they 
don’t wish us well. They don’t wish us 
well. They are a wounded animal. They 
are a declining power. But like any 
wounded animal, they are a dangerous 
animal. Their world view is completely 
antithetical to ours. We do not want 
them thanking God for our President 
and what he is pushing out. We don’t 
want them thanking God for with-
holding money from our ally, although 
we can understand why they may. To 
me, that is what stuck out from that 
presentation. 
Now, in the first part of this presen-
tation, we walked through the corrupt 
object of President Trump’s scheme— 
getting Ukraine to announce these two 
political investigations that would help 
benefit his reelection campaign. And 
just looking at how baseless and fab-
ricated the allegations behind him 
were made plain his corrupt motive. 
But in addition to this overwhelming 
evidence, there are at least 10 other 
reasons we know that President Trump 
directed his scheme with corrupt in-
tent. There are at least 10 other rea-
sons we know that President Trump 
was interested in his own personal gain 
and not the national interest in press-
ing for these investigations. 
First, the President only wanted 
these investigations to be announced 
publicly, not even conducted. 
Second, the President’s only interest 
in Ukraine was the ‘‘Big Stuff’’ that 
mattered to himself, not issues affect-
ing Ukraine or the United States. 
Third, the President tasked his per-
sonal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to pursue 
these investigations on his behalf, not 
government officials. 
Fourth, both before and after the 
July 25 call, the investigations were 
never part of U.S. official foreign pol-
icy. NSC officials, too, make clear that 
this was not about foreign policy. 
Other witnesses confirmed the inves-
tigations, in fact, diverged from U.S. 
official policy. 
Fifth, the investigations were under-
taken outside of normal channels. 
Sixth, Ukrainian officials understood 
that the investigations were purely po-
litical in nature. 
Seventh, multiple administration of-
ficials reported the President’s July 25 
call. 
Eighth, the White House buried the 
call. 
Ninth, President Trump confirmed he 
wanted Ukraine to conduct investiga-
tions in his own words. 
And, finally, President Trump did 
not care about anti-corruption efforts 
in Ukraine. 
Let’s go through these one by one. 
First, perhaps the simplest way that 
we all know that President Trump 
wanted these investigations done sole-
ly to help his personal political inter-
ests and not the national interest is 
that he merely wanted a public an-
nouncement of the investigations, not 
an assurance that they would actually 
be done. If his desire for these inves-
tigations was truly to assist Ukraine’s 
anti-corruption efforts or because he 
was worried about the larger issues of 
corruption in Ukraine, someone actu-
ally investigating the facts underlying 
the investigations would have been 
most important. But he didn’t care 
about the facts or the issues. He just 
wanted the political benefit of the pub-
lic announcement of an investigation 
that he could use to damage his polit-
ical opponent and boost his own polit-
ical standing. 
Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who 
was at the center of this scheme, made 
this quite clear in his testimony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
GOLDMAN. Now, for Mr. Giuliani, by this 
point, you understood that in order to get 
that White House meeting that you wanted 
President Zelensky to have and that Presi-
dent Zelensky desperately wanted to have 
that Ukraine would have to initiate these 
two investigations. Is that right? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Well, they would 
have to announce that they were going to do 
it. 
GOLDMAN. Right. Because Giuliani and 
President Trump didn’t actually care if they 
did them, right? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. I never heard, 
Mr. Goldman, anyone say that the investiga-
tions had to start or had to be completed. 
The only thing I heard from Mr. Giuliani, or 
otherwise, was that they had to be an-
nounced in some form and that form kept 
changing. 
GOLDMAN. Announced publicly? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Announced pub-
lically. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The other evi-
dence gathered by the House’s inves-
tigation 
confirms 
Ambassador 
Sondland’s understanding. For exam-
ple, recently, the House received docu-
ments from Lev Parnas, an associate of 
Rudy Giuliani’s, now indicted, in re-
sponse to a subpoena. As you know, 
Lev Parnas was indicted by the South-
ern District of New York for crimes, in-
cluding election law violations. As part 
of the documents that Parnas turned 
over, we obtained handwritten notes 
that Parnas apparently took some time 
in 2019. One of those notes lays out the 
scheme very clearly and succinctly. 
Now, it is not every day that you get 
a document like this—what appears to 
be a member of the conspiracy writing 
down the object of the conspiracy, but 
that is exactly what we see here. We 
see the scheme that ultimately was di-
rected by President Trump to coerce 
Ukraine to announce the investigation 
of the Bidens. I repeat: to announce the 
investigation—not 
investigate, 
not 
conduct. The only thing that mattered 
was the public announcement, as this 
note says with an asterisk: ‘‘Get 
Zelensky to Announce that the Biden 
case will Be Investigated.’’ 
And in early September, after Mr. 
Giuliani and Ambassadors Volker and 
Sondland had tried but failed to get 
President Zelensky to issue a public 
statement, President Trump made this 
clear himself. He explained to Ambas-
sador Bolton that he wanted Zelensky 
in a ‘‘public box’’; that is, President 
Trump would only be satisfied if Presi-
dent Zelensky made a public announce-
ment of the investigations, which he 
subsequently agreed to do on CNN. 
Here is Ambassador Taylor’s testi-
mony on this: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And so, even though Presi-
dent Trump was saying repeatedly that there 
is no quid pro quo, Ambassador Sondland re-
layed to you that the facts of the matter 
were that the White House meeting and the 
security assistance were conditioned on the 
announcement of these investigations. Is 
that your understanding? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. That’s my under-
standing. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Now, you referenced a tel-
evision interview and a desire for President 
Trump to put Zelensky in a public box, 
which you also have in quotes. Was that in 
your notes? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. It was in my notes. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And what did you under-
stand that to mean, to put Zelensky in a 
public box? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. I understood that to 
mean that President Trump, through Ambas-
sador Sondland, was asking for President 
Zelensky to very publicly commit to these 
investigations, that it was not sufficient to 
do this in private, that this needed to be a 
very public statement. 
The fact that the President only 
wanted a public announcement and not 
the investigations to actually be con-
ducted demonstrates that his desire for 
investigations was simply and solely to 
boost his reelection efforts.

No. 2, turning to the second reason, 
President Trump’s agents who helped 
to carry out this scheme confirmed 
that his desire for Ukraine to announce 
the investigations was solely for his 
personal political benefit. 
As we will explain in more detail in a 
few minutes, President Trump never 
expressed any interest in U.S. anti-cor-
ruption policy toward Ukraine, nor did 
he care about Ukraine’s war against 
Russia. He only expressed interest in 
one thing: investigating his political 
opponent. This was unequivocally con-
firmed by the testimony of David 
Holmes, the senior official at the U.S. 
Embassy in Kyiv. The day after the 
July 25 call, Holmes overheard a con-
versation between President Trump 
and Ambassador Sondland, who was in 
Kyiv. The only topic they discussed re-
lated to Ukraine was as to the inves-
tigations. 
Here is his testimony: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. 
HOLMES. 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
placed a call on his mobile phone, and I 
heard him announce himself several times 
along the lines of ‘‘Gordon Sondland, holding 
for the President.’’ It appeared that he was 
being transferred through several layers of 
switchboards and assistants, and I then no-
ticed 
Ambassador 
Sondland’s 
demeanor 
changed and understood he had been con-
nected to President Trump. While Ambas-
sador 
Sondland’s 
phone 
was 
not 
on 
speakerphone, I could hear the President’s 
voice through the ear piece of the phone. 
The President’s voice was loud and rec-
ognizable, and Ambassador Sondland held 
the phone away from his ear for a period of 
time, presumably because of the loud vol-
ume. I heard Ambassador Sondland greet the 
President and explained he was calling from 
Kyiv. I heard President Trump then clarify 
that Ambassador Sondland was in Ukraine. 
Ambassador Sondland replied, yes, he was in 
Ukraine, and went on to state that President 
Zelensky ‘‘loves your ass.’’ I then heard 
President Trump ask, ‘‘So he’s going to do 
the investigation?’’ 
Ambassador Sondland replied that ‘‘he’s 
going to do it,’’ adding that President 
Zelensky will do ‘‘anything you ask him to 
do.’’ 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. After the call, 
Ambassador Sondland confirmed to 
Holmes that the investigations were 
the 
President’s 
sole 
interest 
with 
Ukraine because—and this is very im-
portant—they benefit the President. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. HOLMES. After the call ended, Ambas-
sador Sondland remarked that the President 
was in a bad mood, as Ambassador Sondland 
stated was often the case early in the morn-
ing. I then took the opportunity to ask Am-
bassador Sondland for his candid impression 
of the President’s views on Ukraine. In par-
ticular, I asked Ambassador Sondland if it 
was true that the President did not give a 
[expletive] 
about 
Ukraine. 
Ambassador 
Sondland agreed that the President did not 
give a [expletive] about Ukraine. 
I asked, ‘‘Why Not?’’ Ambassador Sondland 
stated the President only cares about ‘‘big 
stuff.’’ I noted there was big stuff going on in 
Ukraine, like a war with Russia. Ambassador 
Sondland replied that he meant big stuff 
that benefits the President, like the Biden 
investigation that Mr. Giuliani was pushing. 
The conversation then moved on to other 
topics. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. This under-
standing by Ambassador Sondland is 
independently confirmed by President 
Trump’s 
own 
interactions 
with 
Ukraine. 
During his two telephone calls with 
President Zelensky—first on April 21 
and then on July 25—President Trump 
did not refer to any anti-corruption ef-
forts or the war against Russia. He 
never even uttered the word ‘‘corrup-
tion.’’ Instead, he only spoke about in-
vestigating his political opponents. 
He later confirmed this narrow and 
singular focus to the press. On October 
3, when asked about the Ukraine 
scheme, he said: ‘‘Well, I would think if 
they were honest about it, they would 
start a major investigation into the 
Bidens. It’s a very simple answer.’’ 
Here is that conference: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
REPORTER. What exactly did you hope 
Zelensky would do about the Bidens after 
your phone call? 
The PRESIDENT. Well, I would think that, 
if they were honest about it, they’d start a 
major investigation into the Bidens. It’s a 
very simple answer. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So we know 
from witnesses, the President’s per-
sonal agents, and, most importantly, 
the President himself that the only 
thing President Trump cared about 
with Ukraine was his investigations in 
order to benefit himself. 
To see this even more starkly, it is 
helpful to remember what Presidential 
head-of-state calls are normally used 
for. 
Talk to any former occupant of the 
Oval Office, and he will tell you that 
the disparity in power between the 
President of the United States and 
other heads of state is vast. Since 
World War II—and consistent with the 
requirement to ‘‘faithfully execute’’ 
their oaths of office—U.S. Presidents 
from both political parties have made 
good use of this disparity in power in 
their telephone calls with foreign lead-
ers. They have used those calls to se-
cure commitments that have bolstered 
American security and prosperity. 
Acting as our chief diplomat, Presi-
dent Reagan used his calls to our Euro-
pean allies, like Prime Minister Mar-
garet Thatcher, to rally the world 
against the Soviet threat—the shining 
city on the hill standing up to the evil 
empire. His calls laid the foundation 
for landmark nonproliferation agree-
ments that averted nuclear Armaged-
don. 
It was during a phone call on Christ-
mas Day in 1991 that President George 
H. W. Bush learned that Mikhail 
Gorbachev intended to resign as Soviet 
Premier, marking the end of the Soviet 
Union. Historians credit his deft diplo-
macy, including numerous one-on-one 
phone calls, for bringing about a peace-
ful end to the Cold War. 
Following September 11, President 
George W. Bush used his calls with 
heads of state to rally global support 
for the U.S. campaign to defeat al- 
Qaida and to work with our allies to 
protect and defend U.S. national secu-
rity and combat terrorism. 
President Obama used his calls with 
foreign leaders to contain the fallout 
from the global economic crisis, assem-
ble an international coalition to fight 
the Islamic State, and, of course, to 
rally support for Ukraine following 
Russia’s invasion of Crimea. 
No matter what you think of the pol-
icy views or priorities of these prior 
Presidents, there is no question that 
they are examples of the normal diplo-
macy that happens during Presidential 
telephone calls, and there is no doubt, 
when you are the President of the 
United States and you call a foreign 
leader, that you are on the clock for 
the American people. Consistent with 
the faithful execution of his or her 
oath of office, a President’s first and 
only objective is to get foreign leaders 
to do what is in the best interest of the 
United States. 
That is not what happened on July 
25. On that date, President Trump used 
a head-of-state call with the leader of 
Ukraine to help himself—to press a for-
eign leader to investigate the Presi-
dent’s political opponent in order to 
help his reelection campaign. President 
Trump abused his authority as Com-
mander in Chief and Chief Diplomat to 
benefit himself, and he betrayed the in-
terests of the American people when he 
did so. 
Let’s go to the third reason that we 
know the President put his interests 
first. 
The third reason you know that the 
investigations were politically moti-
vated is the central role played by 
President Trump’s personal attorney, 
Mr. Giuliani, who has never had an of-
ficial role in this government but, in-
stead, was at all times representing the 
President in his personal capacity. 
There is no dispute about this. 
For example, Mr. Giuliani made this 
point clearly in his May 10 letter to the 
President of Ukraine himself, where he 
wrote: 
Dear President-Elect Zelensky, I am pri-
vate counsel to President Donald J. Trump. 
Just to be precise, I represent him as a pri-
vate citizen, not as President of the United 
States. This is quite common under Amer-
ican law because the duties and privileges of 
a President and a private citizen are not the 
same. Separate representation is the usual 
process. 
Mr. Giuliani also repeated this pub-
licly. For example, he confirmed this 
point on May 9, in the New York 
Times, 
when 
he 
said—well, 
many 
things—‘‘We’re not meddling in an 
election, we’re meddling in an inves-
tigation, which we have a right to do.’’ 
‘‘There is nothing illegal about it,’’ 
he said. ‘‘Somebody could say it’s im-
proper. And this isn’t foreign policy.’’ 
He went on to say, referring to the 
President: ‘‘He basically knows what 
I’m doing, sure, as his lawyer.’’ 
‘‘My only client is the president of 
the United States,’’ he said. ‘‘He’s the 
one I have an obligation to report to, 
tell him what happened.’’ 
Think about that. The President is 
using his personal lawyer to ask

Ukraine for investigations that aren’t 
‘‘foreign policy’’ but that will be very, 
very helpful to the President person-
ally. It is not often you get it so 
graphically as we do here. 
Let’s go to the fourth reason that 
these investigations were never part of 
U.S. policy. 
It was not just that President Trump 
used his personal lawyer; it was also 
that what he was asking for was never 
a part of U.S. policy. Witnesses told us 
that President Trump’s investigations 
were not in his official, prepared talk-
ing points or briefing materials. To the 
contrary, they went against official 
policy and diverged from our national 
security interests. 
All three witnesses—Tim Morrison at 
the National Security Council, LTC 
Alex Vindman at the National Security 
Council, and Jennifer Williams, who 
listened to the July 25 call—testified 
that when President Trump demanded 
that President Zelensky investigate 
the Bidens, he had completely departed 
from the talking points they had pre-
pared for him. 
Now, before I get to the video clip, I 
just want to underscore this: He is not 
obligated to use his talking points, and 
he is not obligated to follow the rec-
ommendations of his staff no matter 
how sound they may be. What this 
makes clear is that it was not U.S. pol-
icy that he was conducting; it was his 
private, personal interests that he was 
conducting. If it were U.S. policy, it 
probably would have been in the talk-
ing points and briefing materials, but, 
of course, it was not. 
Let’s look at Mr. Morrison’s testi-
mony on this point. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
GOLDMAN. Now, Mr. Morrison, were— 
these references to CrowdStrike, the server 
and 2016 election, and to Vice President 
Biden and son, were they included in the 
President’s talking points? 
Mr. MORRISON. They were not. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Here is Lieu-
tenant Colonel Vindman on this point: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ms. SPEIER. Colonel Vindman, you are the 
National Security Council’s director for 
Ukraine. Did you participate in preparing 
the talking points for the President’s call? 
VINDMAN. I did. I prepared them. 
Ms. SPEIER. So you prepared them. They 
were then reviewed and edited by multiple 
senior officers at the NSC and the White 
House. Is that correct? 
VINDMAN. That is correct. 
Ms. SPEIER. Did the talking points for the 
president contain any discussion of inves-
tigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens or 
Burisma? 
VINDMAN. They did not. 
Ms. SPEIER. Are you aware of any written 
product from the National Security Council 
suggesting that investigations into the 2016 
election, the Bidens, or Burisma are part of 
the official policy of the United States? 
VINDMAN. No, I’m not. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Dr. Hill also 
elaborated on this point. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Dr. HILL. My point, Mr. NUNES, is that we 
at the National Security Council were not 
told either by the President directly or 
through Ambassador Bolton that we were to 
be focused on these issues as a matter of U.S. 
foreign policy towards Ukraine. So when we 
are talking about Ukraine in 2016, I never 
personally heard the President say anything 
specific about 2016 and Ukraine. I’ve seen 
him say plenty of things publicly, but I was 
not given a directive. In fact, I was given a 
directive by Ambassador Bolton on July 10 
very clearly to stay out of domestic politics. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So, to be clear, 
when President Trump asked for these 
investigations, he was not asking for 
them based on an official U.S. policy. 
His top official advisers had not even 
been told about these investigations. 
To the contrary, they were told to stay 
out of U.S. politics. 
And it gets worse. It was not just 
that President Trump ignored official 
U.S. policy and the talking points he 
was given; it was that what he was 
doing—withholding 
support 
from 
Ukraine—was actually contrary to and 
harmful to U.S. policy. 
There is clear and undisputed bipar-
tisan support for Ukraine. Ukraine is 
our ally. What is more, they are at war 
with our adversary, Russia. So our goal 
should be to help President Zelensky’s 
anti-corruption reforms and to help 
Ukraine fight its adversary, Russia, in 
any way that we can. 
President Trump’s own national de-
fense strategy stated that the United 
States and its European allies ‘‘will 
deter Russian adventurism’’—a clear 
reference to Russia’s usurpation of 
Ukrainian territory and sovereignty. 
Consistent with that strategy, we cur-
rently have approximately 68,000 troops 
stationed in Europe. Roughly 10,000 of 
those U.S. troops are deployed on 
NATO’s eastern border with Russia, to 
countries like Poland, Hungary, Lith-
uania, and Bulgaria. These American 
forces are literally holding the line 
against another land grab by Vladimir 
Putin. 
The author of that strategy, former 
U.S. National Security Advisor LTG 
H.R. McMaster, issued this stark warn-
ing about Russia’s aggression: 
[F]or too long, some nations have looked 
the other way in the face of these threats. 
Russia brazenly and implausibly denies its 
actions and we have failed to impose suffi-
cient costs. The Kremlin’s confidence is 
growing as its agents conduct their sus-
tained campaigns to undermine our con-
fidence in ourselves and in one another. 
What General McMaster says obvi-
ously makes sense. Russia’s confidence, 
sadly, is growing. We need to stand up 
to them, and that is why we support 
Ukraine, to help defeat Russian aggres-
sion. 
So, on July 25, when President 
Zelensky spoke with President Trump, 
that is what he, McMaster, was hoping 
to discuss—or he would be hoping that 
he would discuss how we can support 
Ukraine in its fight against a huge ad-
versary. 
Our confidence in one another; that 
is what President Zelensky was most 
worried about when he got on the line 
with the President on July 25, whether 
Ukraine could have confidence in U.S. 
support. 
Nearly 70 percent of Ukraine’s terri-
tory—I am sorry. Nearly 7 percent of 
Ukraine’s territory had been annexed 
by Russian-backed forces. More than 
15,000 troops have been lost in the hot 
war over the past 5 years. 
But when President Zelensky raised 
the issue of U.S. military aid needed to 
confront Russian aggression, President 
Trump did nothing to reassure the 
Ukrainian leader of our steadfast sup-
port for Ukraine’s sovereignty. Instead, 
he made personal demands. 
It is for these reasons that President 
Trump’s investigations went against 
official U.S. policy. Witnesses con-
firmed that President Trump’s requests 
actually diverged not just from our 
policy but from our own national secu-
rity. 
As Dr. Hill testified, Ambassador 
Sondland, in carrying out President 
Trump’s scheme, ‘‘was being involved 
in a domestic political errand, and we 
were being involved in national secu-
rity policy, and those two things had 
just diverged.’’ 
And as Ambassador Taylor elabo-
rated, ‘‘[O]ur holding up of security as-
sistance that would go to a country 
that is fighting aggression from Rus-
sia, for no good policy reason, no good 
substantive reason, no good national 
security reason, is wrong.’’ 
As these officials so correctly ob-
served, there is no question that Presi-
dent Trump’s political errand and our 
national security diverged; that he did 
this to advance his reelection, not to 
advance U.S. national security goals, 
and that he did it for no good reason 
but the political one. 
But it is more than that. It is more 
than our national security policy. We, 
as a country, are meant to embody the 
solution to corruption. Our country is 
based on promoting the rule of law. 
And here, what the President did at-
tacks another of the U.S. strengths, 
that of our ideals and our values. 
Part of that is ensuring the integrity 
of our democracy and our political in-
stitutions. It is a fundamental Amer-
ican value underlying our democracy 
that we do not use official powers to 
ask for investigations of our political 
opponents to gain a political advan-
tage. 
When President Trump asked a for-
eign leader to investigate his political 
opponent, he abused the broad author-
ity provided to the President of the 
United States. 
Witness testimony again confirms 
this. Vice President PENCE’s adviser, 
Jennifer Williams, was concerned by 
the President’s focus on domestic polit-
ical issues rather than U.S. national 
security because the President is not 
supposed to use foreign governments 
for political errands. 
She characterized the call as ‘‘a do-
mestic political matter.’’ Here is her 
testimony: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Jennifer WILLIAMS. During my closed- 
door deposition, members of the committee 
asked about my personal views, and whether

I had any concerns about the July 25th call. 
As I testified then, I found the July 25th 
phone call unusual because, in contrast to 
other Presidential calls I had observed, it in-
volved discussion of what appeared to be a 
domestic political matter. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Lieutenant 
Colonel Vindman also thought the call 
was improper and unrelated to the 
talking points he had drafted for the 
President. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Lt. Col. VINDMAN. It is improper for the 
President of the United States to demand 
that a foreign government investigate a U.S. 
citizen, and a political opponent . . .—it was 
also clear that if Ukraine pursued an inves-
tigation into the 2016 elections, the Bidens 
and Burisma, it would be interpreted as a 
partisan play. This would undoubtedly result 
in Ukraine using bipartisan support, under-
mining U.S. national security, and advanc-
ing Russia’s strategic objectives in the re-
gion. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Lieutenant 
Colonel Vindman, as a reminder, is a 
Purple Heart veteran and says what we 
all know clearly: It is improper for the 
President of the United States to de-
mand a foreign government to inves-
tigate a U.S. citizen and a political op-
ponent. 
And it wasn’t just that Colonel 
Vindman thought it was wrong; he was 
so concerned that he warned Ukraine, 
too, not to get involved in our domes-
tic politics. 
In May, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman 
grew concerned by the pressure cam-
paign he witnessed in the media, waged 
primarily by Rudy Giuliani. During a 
meeting with President Zelensky on 
May 20, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman 
warned the Ukrainian leader to stay 
out of U.S. politics—because that is 
our official U.S. policy. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. During a 
bilateral meeting in which the whole delega-
tion was meeting with President Zelensky 
and his team, I offered two pieces of advice: 
To be particularly cautious with regards to 
Ukraine—to be particularly cautious with 
regards to Russia, and its desire to provoke 
Ukraine; and the second one was to stay out 
of U.S. domestic policy. 
The CHAIRMAN. Do you mean politics? 
Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. Politics, 
correct. 
The CHAIRMAN. And why did you feel it 
was necessary to advise President Zelensky 
to stay away from U.S. domestic politics? 
Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. Chairman, 
in the March and April timeframe, it became 
clear that there were—there were actors in 
the U.S., public actors, nongovernmental ac-
tors that were promoting the idea of inves-
tigations and 2016 Ukrainian interference. 
And it was consistent with U.S. policy to 
advise any country, all the countries in my 
portfolio, any country in the world, to not 
participate in U.S. domestic politics. So I 
was passing the same advice consistent with 
U.S. policy. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. He once again 
makes this clear: ‘‘[I]t was consistent 
with U.S. policy to advise any country, 
all the countries in my portfolio, any 
country in the world’’ we do not par-
ticipate in U.S. domestic politics. 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State 
George Kent, too, testified that the 
President’s political investigations, of 
course, had nothing to do with Amer-
ican anticorruption efforts in Ukraine, 
which has consistently focused on 
building institutions and never specific 
investigations, and that if we do ask 
countries to do our political errands, it 
entirely threatens our credibility as a 
democracy. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
HECK. You also testified on October 15th, 
in the deposition, about fundamental re-
forms necessary for Ukraine to fight corrup-
tion and to transform the country. And you 
cited the importance of reforming certain in-
stitutions, notably the security service in 
the Prosecutor General’s Office. Was inves-
tigating President Trump’s political oppo-
nents a part of those necessary reforms? Was 
it on that list of yours, sir? Or, indeed, was 
it on any list? 
KENT. No, they weren’t. 
HECK. In fact, historically, is it not true 
that a major problem in the Ukraine has 
been its misuse of prosecutors precisely to 
conduct investigation of political opponents? 
That’s a legacy, I dare suggest, from the So-
viet era, when, as you stated in your testi-
mony, prosecutors like the KGB were and I 
quote you now ‘‘instruments of oppression.’’ 
Is that correct? 
KENT. I said that, and I believe it’s true. 
HECK. So, finally, Mr. Kent, for as long as 
I can remember, U.S. foreign policy has been 
predicated on advancing principled interests 
in democratic values—notably, freedom of 
speech, press, assembly, religion; free, fair, 
and open elections; and the rule of law. Mr. 
Kent, when American leaders ask foreign 
governments to investigate their potential 
rivals, doesn’t that make it harder for us to 
advocate on behalf of those democratic val-
ues? 
KENT. I believe it makes it more difficult 
for our diplomatic representatives overseas 
to carry out those policy goals, yes. 
HECK. How is that, sir? 
KENT. Well, there’s an issue of credibility. 
They hear diplomats on the ground saying 
one thing, and they hear other U.S. leaders 
saying something else. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The bottom 
line is this: What was in the best inter-
est of our country was to help Ukraine, 
to give them the military aid, to fight 
one of our greatest adversaries, and to 
help promote the rule of law. And what 
was in President Trump’s personal in-
terest was the opposite: to pressure 
Ukraine 
to 
conduct 
investigations 
against his 2020 rival to help ensure his 
reelection. And when what is best for 
the country and what was best for Don-
ald Trump diverged, President Trump 
put himself above the best interests of 
our country. 
Let’s now go to the fifth reason that 
we know the President put himself 
first. 
A fifth reason is that the request for 
these investigations departed not just 
from U.S. policy but from established 
U.S. Government channels. 
On the July 25 call, President Trump 
told President Zelensky that he should 
speak to Mr. Giuliani and Attorney 
General Barr, but after the July 25 
transcript was released, the Depart-
ment of Justice disclaimed any knowl-
edge or involvement in the President’s 
political investigations. 
The Department of Justice statement 
from the day the July 25 call was re-
leased says this. This was from Sep-
tember 25. 
(Text of Videotape presentation.) 
The President has not spoken with the At-
torney General about having Ukraine inves-
tigate anything relating to former Vice 
President Biden or his son. The President 
has not asked the Attorney General to con-
tact Ukraine—on this or any other matter. 
The Attorney General has not communicated 
with Ukraine—on this or any other subject. 
Nor has the Attorney General discussed this 
matter, or anything relating to Ukraine, 
with Rudy Giuliani. 
Now, this is pretty extraordinary. 
You can say a lot of things about the 
Attorney General, but you cannot say 
that he ever has looked to pursue 
something he thought was not in the 
President’s interest. 
This is pretty extraordinary, where 
he is saying the moment this tran-
script is publicly released: I have got 
nothing to do with this scheme. I don’t 
know why they brought me up in this 
call. I don’t know why the President 
brought me up in this call. He hasn’t 
asked me to do anything about this. I 
want nothing to do with this business. 
I suspect the Attorney General can 
recognize a drug deal when he sees it, 
too, and he wanted nothing to do with 
this. 
Now, if this were some legitimate in-
vestigation, you would think the De-
partment of Justice would have a role. 
That is traditionally how an investiga-
tion with an international component 
would work, but this wasn’t the case. 
This wasn’t the case. And the Attorney 
General wanted nothing to do with it. 
If these were legitimate investiga-
tions that were in the national inter-
est, why was Bill Barr’s Justice De-
partment so quick to divorce them-
selves from it? 
The simple answer is that, as we see 
so clearly, they were against U.S. offi-
cial policy and our national security. 
The Justice Department wanted noth-
ing to do with it, and by asking for 
these investigations, the President was 
abusing his power. 
Let’s go to the sixth reason you know 
President Trump put himself first. It 
wasn’t just that these witnesses told 
us—what these witnesses told us in the 
impeachment hearings about this being 
wrong. They reported the President’s 
conduct in realtime. So it is not just 
that they came forward later; they 
came forward in realtime to report the 
President’s conduct. 
Of course, you have seen over the last 
couple days how many times people are 
told: Go talk to the lawyers. 
Well, Tim Morrison, former Repub-
lican staffer, and Colonel Vindman 
were sufficiently concerned by what 
they heard President Trump solicit on 
that July 25 call that they both imme-
diately went to speak to the lawyer, 
John Eisenberg, the NSC Legal Advi-
sor. Let’s take a look. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Now, Mr. Morrison, short-
ly after you heard the July 25th call, you tes-
tified that you alerted the NSC legal advisor, 
John Eisenberg, pretty much right away. Is 
that right?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S503 
January 23, 2020 
Mr. MORRISON. Correct. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And you indicated in your 
opening statement, or at least from your 
deposition, that you went to Mr. Eisenberg 
out of concern over the potential political 
fallout if the call record became public and 
not because you thought it was illegal. Is 
that right? 
Mr. MORRISON. Correct. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. But you would agree, 
right, that asking a foreign government to 
investigate a domestic political rival was in-
appropriate, would you not? 
Mr. MORRISON. It is not what we rec-
ommended the President discuss. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I think that is 
a profound understatement. Mr. Morri-
son clearly recognized that the request 
to investigate Biden and Burisma was 
about U.S. domestic politics and not 
U.S. 
national 
security. 
Lieutenant 
Colonel Vindman knew this, too, and 
he reported his concerns to the White 
House counsel. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Now, you said you also re-
ported this incident to the NSC lawyers; is 
that right? 
Lt. Col. VINDMAN. Correct. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. What was their response? 
Lt. Col. VINDMAN. John Eisenberg said 
that he—he took notes while I was talking, 
and he said that he would look into it. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Why did you report this 
meeting and this conversation to the NSC 
lawyers? 
Lt. Col. VINDMAN. Because it was inap-
propriate. And, following the meeting, I had 
a short conversation—following the post- 
meeting meeting, in the Ward Room. I had a 
short conversation with Ambassador—cor-
rection—Dr. Hill. And we discussed the idea 
of needing to report this. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. In fact, Lieu-
tenant Colonel Vindman reported con-
cerns twice, and Mr. Morrison did so 
multiple times as well. 
They, of course, weren’t the only 
ones. As this slide shows, Dr. Hill re-
ported her concerns to the NSC legal 
advisor. Mr. Kent reported his concerns 
about the State Department’s failure 
to respond to the House’s document re-
quest. The lawyers were awfully busy. 
And why did President Trump’s own 
officials—not so-called Never Trump-
ers, not Democrats or Republicans, but 
career public servants—report this con-
duct in real time? Because they knew 
it was wrong. 
Dr. Hill said: ‘‘It was improper, and it 
was inappropriate, and we said that in 
the time, in real time.’’ 
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman said: 
‘‘[The July 25] call was wrong’’ and he 
had a ‘‘duty to report it.’’ 
Ambassador Taylor said: ‘‘Holding up 
of security assistance . . . for no good 
policy reason, no good substantive rea-
son, no good national security reason, 
is wrong.’’ 
Mr. Morrison admitted that he re-
ported the July 25 call ‘‘pretty much 
right away’’ and ‘‘recommended to 
them that we restrict access to the 
package.’’ 
And Ms. Williams said: ‘‘[The July 25 
call] struck me as unusual and inappro-
priate,’’ and ‘‘more political in na-
ture.’’ 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The consensus 
is clear. The President’s demand for po-
litical investigations was improper, in-
appropriate, and wrong, and again con-
firms that the requested investigations 
were not about anything except Donald 
Trump’s political gains. 
Let’s go to the seventh reason why 
you know President Trump put himself 
first. American officials weren’t the 
only ones who recognized the political 
nature of these requests. Ukrainian of-
ficials did, too. That brings us the sev-
enth reason we know that this was 
against our national interests. Ukrain-
ian officials themselves expressed con-
cern that these corrupt investigations 
would drag them into U.S. domestic 
politics. 
For example, in mid-July, Ambas-
sador Taylor texted Sondland and Tay-
lor and explained President Zelensky’s 
reluctance to become a pawn in U.S. 
politics. 
Ambassador 
Taylor 
said: 
‘‘Gordon, one thing Kurt and I talked 
about yesterday was Sasha Danyliuk’s 
point’’—he is a top adviser to President 
Zelensky—‘‘Sasha 
Danyliuk’s 
point 
that President Zelensky is sensitive 
about Ukraine being taken seriously, 
not merely as an instrument in Wash-
ington domestic reelection politics.’’ 
So here you have Sasha Danyliuk, 
one of the top advisers to President 
Zelensky affirming that his President 
wants to be taken seriously. It is pret-
ty extraordinary when a foreign leader 
has to communicate to this country 
that they want him to take him seri-
ously and not just as some kind of a 
political pawn for political purposes. 
An ally dependent on us for military 
support, economic support, and diplo-
matic support has to say: Please take 
us seriously. But this is what the 
Ukrainians are saying. They under-
stood this wasn’t American policy—as 
much as we do—and they didn’t want 
to be used as a pawn. 
Ambassador Taylor explained his 
text during his testimony: ‘‘The whole 
thrust of this irregular channel was to 
get 
these 
investigations, 
which 
Danyliuk and presumably Zelensky 
were resisting because they didn’t want 
to be seen to be interfering but also to 
be a pawn.’’ 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. This is an im-
portant point, too. It wasn’t just that 
they didn’t want to be seen as getting 
into politics, because if they did and it 
looked like they were getting on the 
side of Donald Trump, that would hurt 
their support with Democrats, and if it 
looked like they were getting involved 
with the other side, it would hurt them 
with the President. There was no ben-
efit to Ukraine to be dragged into this. 
There was no benefit to Ukraine by 
this, but they also didn’t want to be 
viewed as a pawn. 
President Zelensky has his own elec-
torate. He is a new leader. He is a 
former comedian, and he wants to be 
taken seriously. He needs to be taken 
seriously, because if the United States 
isn’t going to take him seriously, you 
can darn well bet Vladimir Putin will 
not take him seriously. 
So the perception—not just that 
there is a rift, that he can’t get mili-
tary aid or it is in doubt or in question, 
but the impression—that he is nothing 
more than a pawn, you could see how 
problematic that was for President 
Zelensky. In other words, Ukrainian of-
ficials understood, just as our officials 
understood, just as all those folks you 
saw—Morrison, Vindman, Hill, and oth-
ers, all the people who had to go to the 
lawyers, all the people who listened to 
that call and understood—that this was 
just wrong. 
Morrison goes on to say that he is no 
legal expert and can’t really opine on 
the legality of what happened on this 
call, but they all knew it was wrong. 
They also knew that it was damaging 
to bipartisan support. They knew it 
was damaging to our national security. 
But here we see. It wasn’t just our peo-
ple. It was the Ukrainians who also un-
derstood this was a pure political er-
rand they were being asked to perform. 
That is no way to treat an ally at 
war. 
Now, it wasn’t just the testimony of 
U.S. officials on this. We know this di-
rectly from the Ukrainians. Indeed, we 
know this directly from President 
Zelensky himself, who said: ‘‘I am 
sorry, but I don’t want to be involved 
to democratic, open elections—elec-
tions of the USA.’’ 
Here is Zelensky saying: ‘‘I don’t 
want to be involved.’’ He shouldn’t be 
involved. He shouldn’t be involved in 
our elections. That is not his job, and 
he knows that, and it is a tragic fact 
that the world’s oldest democracy has 
to be told by this struggling democ-
racy: This isn’t what you are supposed 
to do. But that is what is happening. 
Let’s go to the eighth reason why 
you can know that President Trump 
put himself first, and that is because 
there is no serious dispute that the 
White House tried to bury the call 
record. They tried to bury the call 
record. Although President Trump has 
repeatedly insisted that his July con-
versation 
with 
President 
Zelensky 
‘‘was perfect,’’ the White House appar-
ently believed otherwise. Their own 
lawyers apparently believed otherwise. 
Following a head-of-state call, the 
President issues a summary or readout 
to lock in any commitments made by 
the foreign leader and publicly rein-
force the core elements of the Presi-
dent’s message. However, no public 
readout was posted on the White House 
website following the July 25 call. I 
wonder why that was. 
The White House instead provided re-
porters with a short, incomplete sum-
mary that, of course, omitted the 
major elements of the conversation. 
The short summary said: 
Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke 
by telephone with President Volodymyr 
Zelenskyy of Ukraine to congratulate him 
on his recent election. President Trump and 
President 
Zelenskyy 
discussed 
ways 
to 
strengthen the relationship between the 
United States and Ukraine, including energy 
and economic cooperation. Both leaders also 
expressed that they look forward to the op-
portunity to meet.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S504 
January 23, 2020 
That was it. Now, I don’t know about 
you, but that does not seem like an ac-
curate summary of that call. As you 
can see, that summary did not mention 
President Trump’s mention of a de-
bunked conspiracy theory about the 
2016 election promoted by Russian 
President Putin. The summary did not 
mention President Trump’s demand 
that Ukraine announce an investiga-
tion into his domestic political rival, 
former Vice President Biden. The sum-
mary did not mention that President 
Trump praised a corrupt Ukrainian 
prosecutor, who to this day continues 
to feed false claims to the President 
through Rudy Giuliani. 
If the call was ‘‘perfect,’’ if these in-
vestigations were legitimate foreign 
policy, if the White House had nothing 
to hide, then ask yourselves: Why did 
the White House’s readout omit any 
mention of the investigations? Why not 
publicly confirm that Ukraine had been 
asked by the President to pursue them? 
Why? Because it would have exposed 
the President’s corruption. 
Sanitizing the call readout wasn’t 
the only step taken to cover up the 
President’s 
wrongdoing. 
The 
White 
House Counsel’s office also took irreg-
ular efforts to hide the call record 
away on a secure server used to store 
highly classified information. National 
Security Council Senior Director Tim 
Morrison, whom you saw video clips 
on, testified that he requested that ac-
cess to the electronic file of the call 
record be restricted so that it would 
not be leaked. 
Mr. Morrison said the call record did 
not meet the requirements to be placed 
on the highly classified system, and 
Mr. Eisenberg later claimed the call 
record had been placed on the highly 
classified system ‘‘by mistake.’’ 
I am sure it was a very innocent mis-
take. However, mistake or no mistake, 
it remained on that system until at 
least the third week of September 2019. 
So that mistake continued from July 
all the way through September. 
Why were they trying to hide what 
the President did? This was U.S. policy 
and they were proud of it. If they were 
really interested in corruption, if this 
was about corruption, if this had noth-
ing to do with the President’s reelec-
tion campaign, if Biden was merely an 
interesting coincidence, why did they 
bury the record? Why did they hide the 
record? Why did they put the record on 
a system meant for highly classified 
information, which the folks in here on 
the Intelligence Committee and many 
others can tell you is usually used for 
things like covert action operations— 
the most sensitive secrets? 
Well, this was a very sensitive polit-
ical secret. This was a covert action of 
a different kind. This was a corrupt ac-
tion and it was hidden, and they knew 
it was, and that is why they hid it. In-
nocent people don’t behave that way. 
Let’s go to the ninth reason that you 
know President Trump put himself 
first. The clearest reason that we can 
tell that all that President Trump 
cared about was the investigations is 
that President Trump confirmed his 
desire for these investigations in his 
statements to his agents and when this 
scheme was discovered to the American 
people. 
The very day after he solicited for-
eign interference to help him cheat in 
the 2020 election, President Trump 
spoke with Gordon Sondland, who was 
in Ukraine. President Trump had only 
one question for Ambassador Sondland: 
‘‘So, he’s going to do the investiga-
tion?’’ 
Here is David Holmes recounting the 
call between President Trump and 
Sondland: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. HOLMES. I then heard President 
Trump ask, ‘‘So he’s going to do the inves-
tigation?’’ 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
replied 
that he is going to do it, adding that Presi-
dent Zelensky will do ‘‘anything you ask 
him to do.’’ 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So here we 
are; this is July 26. President Zelensky 
doesn’t want to be used as a pawn and 
doesn’t want to be drawn into U.S. pol-
itics, but at this point he feels he has 
no choice. Sondland tells David Holmes 
he is going to do it. Of course, that is 
the only thing the President asked 
about in that call. Sondland says he is 
going to do it, adding that Zelensky 
will do ‘‘anything you ask’’ him to do, 
including, apparently, be his pawn. 
Although Sondland didn’t remember 
the details of his conversation, he did 
not dispute Holmes’ recollection of it. 
In fact, Ambassador Sondland had an 
interesting take on it, which you 
should hear. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Actually, actu-
ally, I would have been more surprised if 
President Trump had not mentioned inves-
tigations, particularly given what we are 
hearing from Mr. Giuliani about the Presi-
dent’s concerns. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. That is pretty 
telling that in this call, the day after 
he has had this head-of-state call—they 
finally got the call arranged between 
these two Presidents—and Ambassador 
Sondland, with major support of the 
President, says: I would have been 
more surprised if he didn’t bring it up. 
The President doesn’t bring up the 
war with Russia. He doesn’t bring up 
anything else. He just brings this up, 
and Sondland confirms: Yeah, frankly, 
I would have been surprised if it was 
something different because we are all 
in the loop here. 
Everybody 
understood 
what 
this 
President wanted, and apparently ev-
erybody 
also 
understood 
just 
how 
wrong it was and how damaging it was. 
In September 2019, even after Presi-
dent Trump learned that his scheme 
was in danger of becoming publicly ex-
posed, he would not give up. He still ex-
pected Ukraine to announce investiga-
tions into Joe Biden and his alleged 
Ukrainian interference in 2016. Accord-
ing 
to 
three 
witnesses, 
President 
Trump 
emphasized 
to 
Ambassador 
Sondland during a call on September 7 
that President Zelensky ‘‘should want 
to do it.’’ 
Then you have the President’s re-
marks on October 3: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
REPORTER. What exactly did you hope 
Zelensky would do about the Bidens after 
your phone? 
President TRUMP. Well, I would think 
that, if they were honest about it, they’d 
start a major investigation into the Bidens. 
It’s a very simple answer. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So here we 
hear again from the President’s own 
words what his primary object is, and 
his primary object is helping his re-
election campaign—help to cheat in his 
reelection campaign. After all that we 
have been through and after all that we 
went through with the Russian inter-
ference in our election and all that 
cost, he was at it again, unrepentant 
and undeterred. If anything, he was 
emboldened by escaping accountability 
from his invitation and willful use of 
Russian-hacked materials in the last 
election, and unconstrained. This is a 
President who truly feels that under 
article II he can do whatever he wants, 
and that includes coercing an ally to 
help him cheat in an election. 
If he is successful, the election is not 
a remedy for that. A remedy in which 
the President can cheat is no remedy 
at all, which is why we are here. This 
was not about corruption, which brings 
me to No. 10, the 10 reasons you know 
President Trump put himself first. 
Ironically, the President has argued 
that his corrupt conduct in soliciting 
sham investigations from Ukraine was 
driven by his concerns about corrup-
tion in Ukraine. This attempt to legiti-
mize his efforts is simply not credible 
and not the least bit believable given 
the mountain of evidence in the record 
of President Trump’s corrupt intent. 
There is no evidence that President 
Trump cared one whit about anti-cor-
ruption efforts at all. That is the 10th 
reason you know this was all political. 
First, the evidence and President 
Trump’s own public statements make 
clear that when the President talks 
about corruption in Ukraine, he is only 
talking about that sliver—that little 
sliver—of alleged corruption that just 
somehow happened to be affected by 
his own political interests, specifically 
two investigations that would benefit 
his reelection. 
For example, on September 25, in a 
joint press availability with President 
Zelensky—the man who doesn’t want 
to be a pawn—at the United Nations 
General Assembly, President Trump 
emphasized his understanding of cor-
ruption to relate to the Biden inves-
tigation. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
TRUMP. Now, when Biden’s son walks 
away with millions of dollars from Ukraine, 
and he knows nothing, and they’re paying 
him millions of dollars, that’s corruption. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I mean, you 
can imagine how President Zelensky 
feels sitting there and hearing this— 
the man who does not want to be a 
pawn and the man who doesn’t want to 
be pulled into American politics. And

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S505 
January 23, 2020 
there is the President, at it again, try-
ing to draw his nation in, even while 
they have a war to fight. 
Another example was on September 
30, when President Trump stated: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Now, the new President of Ukraine ran on 
the basis of no corruption. That’s how he got 
elected. And I believe that he really means 
it. But there was a lot of corruption having 
to do with the 2016 election against us. And 
we want to get to the bottom of it, and it’s 
very important that we do. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. This is, of 
course, 
again, 
bringing 
up 
the 
CrowdStrike conspiracy theory. What 
does the President say? ‘‘Corruption 
. . . against us.’’ He is not concerned 
about actual corruption cases, only 
about matters that affect him person-
ally. 
Two days later, President Trump 
again tried to link corruption with the 
Biden investigation. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
The only thing that matters is the tran-
script of the actual conversation that I had 
with the President of Ukraine. It was per-
fect. We’re looking at congratulations. We’re 
looking at doing things together. And what 
are we looking at? We’re looking at corrup-
tion. And, in, I believe, 1999, there was a cor-
ruption act or a corruption bill passed be-
tween both—and signed—between both coun-
tries, where I have a duty to report corrup-
tion. And let me tell you something: Biden’s 
son is corrupt, and Biden is corrupt. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Just 2 days 
after that, the President again equated 
corruption with actions by others to 
hurt him politically. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
The PRESIDENT: Here’s what’s okay: If 
we feel there’s corruption, like I feel there 
was in the 2016 campaign—there was tremen-
dous corruption against me—if we feel 
there’s corruption, we have a right to go to 
a foreign country. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So here, again, 
the President is pushing out the Krem-
lin talking points of Ukrainian inter-
ference in 2016 and the CrowdStrike 
conspiracy theory. Again, when Presi-
dent Trump is talking about corrup-
tion, he is talking about perceived ef-
forts by political opponents to hurt 
him. It is personal, and it is political, 
but it is not anti-corruption policy. 
Ambassador Volker confirmed this 
fact. Fighting corruption in Ukraine, 
when used by President Trump and 
Giuliani, in fact, refers to the inves-
tigation of the Bidens in 2016. Volker 
said: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
VOLKER. In hindsight, I now understand 
that others saw the idea of investigating pos-
sible corruption involving the Ukrainian 
company Burisma as equivalent to inves-
tigating former Vice President Biden. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So, again, al-
though 
President 
Trump 
and 
Mr. 
Giuliani had used the general term 
‘‘corruption’’ to describe what they 
want Ukraine to investigate, it wasn’t 
about anything actually related to cor-
ruption. The evidence, including the 
President’s own statements, makes 
clear that this is simply code for the 
specific investigations that President 
Trump wanted Ukraine to pursue. 
Second, as we have discussed, the 
President’s timing of his purported 
concerns about corruption in Ukraine 
make it all the more suspect. Before 
news of Vice President Biden’s can-
didacy broke, President Trump showed 
no 
interest 
in 
Ukraine. 
He 
gave 
Ukraine hundreds of millions of dollars 
under a regime that lost power because 
of mounting concerns about corrup-
tion. 
So here we are, the President, in 
these prior years, giving money to a 
government, to Mr. Poroshenko, that 
is viewed as corrupt, and Zelensky 
comes and runs against him in an un-
derdog campaign—underdog campaign 
of Zelensky against Poroshenko. And 
what is the heart of Zelensky’s cam-
paign? That Poroshenko’s government 
is corrupt, and he is running to clean it 
up. He is the reformer. He succeeds be-
cause the Ukrainians really want to 
clean up their government. We see this 
reformer win and carry the hopes of 
the Ukrainian people. 
President Trump had no problem giv-
ing money appropriated by Congress to 
Ukraine under the corrupt regime of 
Poroshenko where corruption had ex-
isted during Poroshenko. But a re-
former gets elected, devoted to fighting 
corruption, and suddenly there is a 
problem. There was a reason to give 
more support to Ukraine. We had a 
President for whom this was the cen-
tral pillar of his campaign. He came 
from outside of the government. People 
placed their hopes in him. You can see 
President Zelensky trying to flatter 
the President in that July 25 call by 
saying: I am up for draining the swamp 
too. He ran on a campaign of reform. 
So there was no problem giving 
money to the prior regime where there 
were abundant concerns about corrup-
tion, but you get a reformer in office, 
and now there is a problem? Of course, 
we know what changed: the emergence 
of Joe Biden as a candidate. 
In the prior regime, corruption was 
no problem. A reformer comes into of-
fice; suddenly, there is a problem. If 
you need any more graphic example, 
again, you look at that call. 
No 
one 
disputes 
that 
Marie 
Yovanovitch was and is a devoted 
fighter against corruption. That is her 
reputation. That was part of the reason 
they had to get rid of her. If you look 
at that July 25 call, the President is 
badmouthing this person fighting cor-
ruption. He is praising the former 
Ukrainian prosecutor, who is corrupt. 
Are we really to believe that this is 
about fighting corruption? There was 
no problem supporting the former re-
gime with corruption problems but 
problems supporting a reformer trying 
to clean it up; no problems with a cor-
rupt 
former 
Ukrainian 
prosecutor 
whom he praises in that call—he is a 
good man—but problems with a U.S. 
Ambassador who has devoted her life to 
this country. 
It wasn’t until 2019, after Biden 
emerged as a considerable opponent 
and after Special Counsel Mueller con-
firmed that President Trump’s cam-
paign had welcomed Russian assistance 
in 2016 that President Trump, we are to 
believe, suddenly developed an interest 
in anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine. 
Never mind that his own Defense De-
partment said they were meeting all 
the benchmarks. This new administra-
tion, the reformer, was doing exactly 
what we wanted him to do. Never mind 
that. Now that Biden is in the picture, 
he has a problem. 
Third, when given the opportunity to 
raise the issue of corruption with the 
Ukrainians, the President never did. 
Despite at the request of his staff, the 
word ‘‘corruption’’ never crosses his 
lips, just the Bidens and CrowdStrike. 
When the President first spoke to 
President Zelensky on April 21, he was 
supposed to—he was asked to by his 
staff—bring up corruption. Go back and 
check, but I think the readout of that 
congratulatory call actually said that 
he brought up corruption. Am I right? 
My staff says I am right. 
So, on April 21, he is asked to bring 
up corruption. In the congratulatory 
call to President Zelensky—great re-
former—he doesn’t bring it up, but you 
know the readout says that he did. It 
was just like the readout of the July 25 
call, misleading. 
Of course, the readout for the second 
call was far more misleading because 
there was far more to mislead about. 
But in those two conversations, there 
is nary a mention of the word ‘‘corrup-
tion.’’ We are to believe that, apart 
from the Bidens, this is what our Presi-
dent was concerned about in Ukraine. 
Here is Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. SCHIFF. Colonel Vindman, if I could 
turn your attention to the April 21 call, that 
is the first call between President Trump 
and President Zelensky, did you prepare 
talking points for the President to use dur-
ing that call? 
Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. Yes, I did. 
The CHAIRMAN. And did those talking 
points include rooting out corruption in 
Ukraine? 
Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. Yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. That was something the 
President was supposed to raise in the con-
versation with President Zelensky? 
Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. Those were 
the recommended talking points that were 
cleared through the NSC staff for the Presi-
dent, yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. Did you listen in on the 
call? 
Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. Yes, I did. 
The CHAIRMAN. The White House has now 
released the record of that call. Did Presi-
dent Trump ever mention corruption in the 
April 21 call? 
Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. To the best 
of my recollection, he did not. 
Mr. 
Manager 
SCHIFF. 
President 
Trump also did not mention the word 
‘‘corruption’’ on the July 25 call. Here 
is Lieutenant Colonel Vindman con-
firming that as well. Well, actually, 
that slide is what I was referring to 
earlier—the good work of my staff. 
This is the readout of the April 21 
call, which says: 
President Donald J. Trump spoke today to 
President-elect Volodymyr Zelensky to con-
gratulate him on his victory in Ukraine’s

January 23, 2020 
April 21 election. The President wished him 
success and called the election an important 
moment in Ukraine’s history, noting the 
peaceful and democratic manner of the elec-
toral process. President Trump underscored 
the unwavering support of the United States 
for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial in-
tegrity—within its internationally recog-
nized borders—and expressed his commit-
ment to work together with President-elect 
Zelensky and the Ukrainian people to imple-
ment reforms that strengthen democracy, in-
crease prosperity, and root out corruption. 
Except that he didn’t. 
Let’s hear Colonel Vindman. No, we 
don’t have that. OK. Let’s not hear 
Colonel Vindman. You heard enough of 
Colonel Vindman. 
When President Trump had the ear of 
President Zelensky during the April 21 
and July 25 calls, he did not raise that 
issue—the word ‘‘corruption’’—a single 
time. 
There is ample other evidence as 
well. White House officials made clear 
to President Trump that President 
Zelensky 
was 
anti-corruption, 
that 
President Trump should help him fight 
corruption. The President’s Agencies 
and Departments supported this too. 
The Defense Department and State De-
partment certified that Ukraine satis-
fied all anti-corruption benchmarks be-
fore President Trump froze the aid. 
The point is this: The evidence is 
consistent. It establishes clearly that 
President Trump did not care about 
corruption. To the contrary, he was 
pursuing a corrupt aim. He wanted 
Ukraine to do the exact thing that 
American policy officials have tried for 
years to stop foreign governments from 
doing: corrupt investigations of polit-
ical rivals. 
To sum up, the evidence is unmistak-
ably clear. On July 25, while acting as 
our Nation’s chief diplomat and speak-
ing to the leader of Ukraine, President 
Trump solicited foreign interference in 
the U.S. election for one particular ob-
jective: to benefit his own reelection. 
To seek help in cheating in a U.S. elec-
tion, 
he 
requested—effectively 
de-
manded—a personal political favor: 
that Ukraine announce two bogus in-
vestigations that were only of value to 
himself. 
This was not about foreign policy. In 
fact, it was inconsistent with and di-
verged from American national secu-
rity and American values. His own offi-
cials knew this, and they reported it. 
Ukraine knew this. And his own White 
House attempted to bury the call. 
The President has confirmed what he 
wanted in his own words. He has made 
it clear he didn’t care about corrup-
tion; he cared only about himself. Now 
it is up to us to do something about it, 
to make sure that a President—that 
this President cannot pursue an objec-
tive that places himself above our 
country. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Well, we 
have gone through the object of Presi-
dent Trump’s scheme: getting Ukraine 
to announce that investigations would 
be held, and that would help him cheat 
and gain an advantage in the 2020 elec-
tion. Those sham investigations were 
to advance his personal political inter-
ests, not the national interests of 
America. Let’s drill down on the how— 
how the President abused the power of 
his office and executed his corrupt 
scheme. 
As noted earlier, the President exe-
cuted his scheme through three official 
actions: first, by soliciting foreign 
election interference; second, by condi-
tioning an official Oval Office meeting 
on Ukraine doing or at least announc-
ing the political investigations; and 
third, by withholding military aid to 
pressure Ukraine to announce those in-
vestigations. 
All three of President Trump’s offi-
cial actions were an abuse of his power 
as President and done for personal 
gain, but the original abuse was Presi-
dent Trump’s solicitation of election 
interference from a foreign country— 
Ukraine. He tried to get an announce-
ment of investigations designed to help 
him in the 2020 Presidential election, 
so let’s start there. 
President Trump’s corrupt demands 
of President Zelensky in the July 25 
phone call were not just a spontaneous 
outburst; they were a dramatic cre-
scendo in a monthslong scheme to ex-
tort Ukraine into assisting his 2020 re-
election campaign. 
As was shown, there is evidence of 
President Trump himself demanding 
that Ukraine conduct the investiga-
tions, but President Trump also dele-
gated his authority to his political 
agent, Rudy Giuliani, to oversee and 
direct this scheme. That was beginning 
in late 2018 and early 2019. Here is how 
that scheme worked: 
First, in January of 2019, Mr. Giuliani 
and his associates discussed the inves-
tigations with the then current and 
former prosecutor generals of Ukraine. 
As we discussed, both were corrupt. 
Then in late April 2019, the scheme 
hit a roadblock. A reform candidate, 
Zelensky, won the Ukrainian Presi-
dential election. The fear was that 
President-elect Zelensky would replace 
the corrupt prosecutor Giuliani had 
been dealing with. 
President Trump removed Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch because his agents, 
including Giuliani, believed she was 
another 
roadblock 
to 
the 
corrupt 
scheme they were undertaking on his 
behalf. In her place, President Trump 
directed a team of handpicked political 
appointees—U.S. officials who were 
supposed to work in the public inter-
est—to instead work with Mr. Giuliani 
to advance the President’s personal in-
terests. Those were the three amigos. 
As Ambassador Sondland said, those 
U.S. officials ‘‘followed the President’s 
orders.’’ 
But 
even 
with 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch gone, President Zelensky 
still resisted Mr. Giuliani’s overtures. 
So, 
at 
the 
President’s 
direction, 
throughout May and June, Giuliani 
ratcheted 
up 
public 
pressure 
on 
Ukraine to announce the investiga-
tions. No luck. It was only then, when 
Mr. Giuliani could not get the deal 
done, that President Trump turned to 
the second official action—using the 
Oval 
Office 
meeting 
to 
pressure 
Ukraine. 
Before we turn to this scheme for so-
liciting foreign election interference, 
we 
need 
to 
understand 
how 
Mr. 
Giuliani, the President’s private agent, 
assumed the leadership role in this 
scheme that applied escalating pres-
sure on Ukraine to announce investiga-
tions helpful to the President’s polit-
ical interest. 
Why is that so important? First, let’s 
be clear. Mr. Giuliani is President 
Trump’s 
personal 
lawyer. 
He 
rep-
resented President Trump with his 
knowledge and consent. The evidence 
shows 
Mr. 
Giuliani 
and 
President 
Trump were in constant contact in this 
time period. Both U.S. and Ukrainian 
officials knew Mr. Giuliani was the key 
to Ukraine. 
Let’s review the President’s use of 
Mr. Giuliani to advance his scheme. 
First, no one disputes that Mr. 
Giuliani was and is President Trump’s 
personal lawyer. President Trump has 
said this. Mr. Giuliani says it. We all 
know it is true. 
Second, President Trump at all times 
directed and knew about Mr. Giuliani’s 
actions. How do we know this? Let’s 
start with the letter signed by Giuliani 
to President Zelensky. Here is that let-
ter. 
On May 10, 2019, Mr. Giuliani wrote 
to a foreign leader, President-elect 
Zelensky. The letter reads: ‘‘In my ca-
pacity as personal counsel to President 
Trump and with his knowledge and 
consent. . . . ’’ Rudy Giuliani, not a 
government official, asked to speak 
about President Trump’s specific re-
quest, and he makes it clear that it 
was in his role as the President’s coun-
sel. 
Mr. Giuliani didn’t just tell a foreign 
leader that; he also told the press. The 
day before Mr. Giuliani’s letter to 
Zelensky, the New York Times pub-
lished an article about Mr. Giuliani’s 
upcoming trip to Ukraine. 
Here is a slide about that article. It 
said: ‘‘Rudy Giuliani Plans Ukraine 
Trip to Push for Inquiries That Could 
Help Trump.’’ 
Mr. Giuliani said his trip was to pres-
sure Ukraine to initiate investigations 
into 
false 
allegations 
against 
the 
Bidens and the 2016 election and that it 
was at the request of the President. He 
stated that President Trump ‘‘basically 
knows what I’m doing, sure, as his law-
yer.’’ 
President Trump repeatedly admit-
ted knowledge of Mr. Giuliani’s activi-
ties and to coordinating with him 
about the Ukrainian activities. 
POLITICO reported on May 11, 2019: 
In a telephone interview with POLITICO 
on Friday, Trump said he didn’t know much 
about Giuliani’s planned trip to Ukraine, but 
wanted to speak to him about it. 
And this is a quote of the President’s: 
‘‘I have not spoken to him at any great 
length, but I will,’’ Trump said in the inter-
view. ‘‘I will speak to him about it before he 
leaves.’’

S507 
January 23, 2020 
President Trump knew and directed 
Mr. Giuliani’s activities in May 2019 
when Mr. Giuliani was planning his 
visit to Kyiv, and that remains true 
today. 
The Wall Street Journal reported 
that when Rudy Giuliani returned from 
a trip to Kyiv just last month, ‘‘the 
President called him as the plane was 
still taxiing down the runway.’’ Presi-
dent Trump asked his lawyer: ‘‘What 
did you get?’’ Giuliani answered: ‘‘More 
than you can imagine.’’ 
Even as President Trump faced im-
peachment in the House of Representa-
tives, he was coordinating with his per-
sonal attorney on the Ukraine scheme. 
The President asked Rudy: ‘‘What did 
you get?’’ 
The evidence also shows that Mr. 
Giuliani and the President were in fre-
quent contact. During the investiga-
tion and in response to a lawful sub-
poena, the House got call records. They 
show contacts—not content—between 
Giuliani, the White House, and other 
people involved in the President’s 
scheme. For example, on April 23, Rudy 
Giuliani learned President Trump had 
decided 
to 
fire 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch. 
According 
to 
phone 
records, on that day, Giuliani had an 8- 
minute-and-28-second call with a White 
House number. 
Let’s look at what happened the next 
day, on April 24. Giuliani was again in 
repeated contact with the White House. 
For example, he had one 8-minute-42- 
second call with a White House num-
ber. An hour and a half later, he had 
another call, which lasted 3 minutes 
and 15 seconds, with the White House. 
When a reporter recently asked whom 
he called at the White House, Mr. 
Giuliani said this: ‘‘I talk to the Presi-
dent, mostly.’’ 
Rudy Giuliani remained in close con-
tact with the White House after the 
disclosure 
of 
his 
planned 
trip 
to 
Ukraine in mid-2019. Now, Rudy is the 
key to Ukraine. We know from Mr. 
Giuliani and the President’s own state-
ments about his role as President 
Trump’s personal agent advancing the 
Ukraine scheme. We know from their 
comments and the documentary evi-
dence about the frequency of their con-
tact. 
But it wasn’t just the frequency of 
Mr. Giuliani’s contact that is signifi-
cant. Here is what matters: President 
Trump directed U.S. officials to work 
with his personal agent, who was pur-
suing investigations not at all related 
to foreign policy. U.S. officials, includ-
ing the President’s own National Secu-
rity Advisor, knew there was no get-
ting around Rudy Giuliani when it 
came to Ukraine. Witnesses repeatedly 
testified to the constant presence of 
Rudy Giuliani on television and in the 
newspapers. A State Department offi-
cial, Christopher Anderson, said that 
John Bolton ‘‘joked about, every time 
Ukraine is mentioned, Giuliani pops 
up.’’ 
After Ambassador Yovanovitch’s dis-
missal, Ambassador Bolton told Dr. 
Hill that Rudy Giuliani was a ‘‘hand 
grenade that’s going to blow everybody 
up.’’ Dr. Hill testified that Ambassador 
Bolton issued guidance for the Na-
tional Security Council staff to not en-
gage with Rudy Giuliani. That made 
sense. Why? Because Mr. Giuliani was 
not conducting official U.S. foreign 
policy; he was doing a domestic polit-
ical errand for President Trump. 
Now, these phone records, as I say, 
lawfully obtained, reveal potential con-
tact between Ambassador Bolton and 
Rudy Giuliani on May 9, the day the 
New York Times reported his trip to 
Kyiv. Rudy Giuliani’s role in Ukraine 
policy is yet another topic that Ambas-
sador Bolton could speak to. You 
should call him and hear what he has 
to say about it. 
Even without Ambassador Bolton’s 
testimony, multiple other administra-
tion officials confirmed Mr. Giuliani’s 
central 
role. 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
said: It was apparent to everyone that 
the key to changing the President’s 
mind on Ukraine was Giuliani. David 
Holmes, U.S. political counselor in 
Kyiv, said: ‘‘Giuliani, a private lawyer, 
was taking a direct role in Ukrainian 
diplomacy.’’ 
Bad enough that the President or-
dered U.S. diplomats to ‘‘talk to Rudy’’ 
about Ukraine, the scheme got worse. 
The evidence shows that Ukrainian of-
ficials also came to recognize the im-
portant role of Mr. Giuliani. On July 
10, 2019, Andriy Yermak, the top aide to 
President Zelensky, sent a text to Am-
bassador Volker about Rudy Giuliani. 
In that text, the Ukrainian official said 
this: 
Thank you for the meeting and your clear 
and very logical position. Will be great meet 
with you before my departure and discuss. I 
feel that the key for many things is Rudi and 
I ready to talk with him at any time. 
Let me repeat that quote: ‘‘[T]he key 
for many things is Rudy. 
So the President used his personal 
agent to conduct his scheme with 
Ukraine. They were in frequent con-
tact. Everyone—White House officials 
and Ukrainian officials—knew they had 
no choice but to deal with Giuliani. 
What was Mr. Giuliani doing that was 
so important to Ukraine? Again, the 
evidence is clear. Mr. Giuliani’s focus 
was to get investigations into Presi-
dent Trump’s political rival to help the 
President’s reelection. 
We have walked through some of the 
timeline of Mr. Giuliani’s actions and 
statements about Ukraine, but let’s 
just line them up briefly because it 
makes the story so clear. April 2019: 
Vice President Biden officially an-
nounced his campaign for the Demo-
cratic Party’s Presidential nomination. 
And a reminder: At the time of Biden’s 
announcement and for months after, 
public polling, including from FOX 
News, showed that Biden would beat 
President Trump. The FOX News poll-
ing data is up on the chart. 
Right after Vice President Biden an-
nounced his candidacy and while Biden 
was beating President Trump in the 
polls, Mr. Giuliani said in a public 
interview with the New York Times 
that he was traveling to Ukraine to 
pursue investigations. He wanted to 
make sure that ‘‘Biden will not get to 
election day without this being inves-
tigated.’’ The scheme was all about 
President Trump’s reelection. 
This continued in June. Mr. Giuliani 
tweeted on June 21 and urged President 
Zelensky to pursue the investigation. 
The scheme continues even now. Mr. 
Giuliani has tweeted about Joe Biden 
over 65 times since September, and 
President Trump told you himself. He 
admitted on October 2: ‘‘ . . . we’ve 
been 
investigating, 
on 
a 
personal 
basis—through Rudy and others, law-
yers—corruption in the 2016 election.’’ 
Again, to review, President Trump 
used his personal agent for Ukraine. He 
has made this clear to U.S. officials 
and to the Ukrainians. The evidence 
shows 
President 
Trump 
and 
Rudy 
Giuliani were in constant contact dur-
ing this period. President Trump di-
rected him to pursue investigations. He 
told U.S. officials to work with Rudy. 
He told Ukrainians to work with Rudy. 
Rudy 
and 
his 
associates 
pressed 
Ukraine for investigations into the 
President’s political rival. Giuliani 
said: ‘‘Biden will not get to election 
day without this being investigated.’’ 
Keeping all this in mind, let’s turn to 
the President’s first official act: solic-
iting foreign interference. As we men-
tioned, in late 2018 and early 2019, Rudy 
Giuliani and his associates Lev Parnas 
and Igor Fruman were busy soliciting 
information from corrupt Ukrainians 
to help President Trump. They pursued 
a monthslong campaign to dig up dirt 
on Biden. In late 2018 and early 2019, 
Parnas, Fruman, and Giuliani met ex-
tensively with two corrupt Ukrainian 
prosecutors, 
Yuriy 
Lutsenko 
and 
Viktor Shokin, to gather information 
they believed would help President 
Trump. As you will recall, Shokin was 
corrupt. George Kent described Shokin 
as ‘‘a typical Ukrainian prosecutor who 
lived a lifestyle far in excess of his gov-
ernment salary, who never prosecuted 
anybody known for having committed 
a crime’’ and who ‘‘covered up crimes 
that were known to have been com-
mitted.’’ 
And 
remember, 
because 
Shokin was corrupt, Vice President 
Biden had urged his removal. This was 
in accordance with U.S. policy. 
Shokin 
blamed 
the 
former 
Vice 
President for his dismissal by the 
Ukrainian Parliament. He wanted to 
revive his political fortunes in Ukraine 
by assisting with Giuliani’s effort. At 
the end of January, Giuliani, Parnas, 
and Fruman participated in a con-
ference call with Shokin. He made alle-
gations about Vice President Biden and 
Burisma. Shokin also falsely claimed 
that Ambassador Yovanovitch had im-
properly denied him a U.S. visa and 
that she was close to Vice President 
Biden. Also, in January, Giuliani, 
Parnas, 
and 
Fruman 
met 
with 
Lutsenko in New York. They discussed 
investigations into Burisma and the

Bidens 
and 
whether 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch was ‘‘loyal to President 
Trump.’’ 
Lutsenko 
held 
a 
grudge 
against Ambassador Yovanovitch be-
cause she and the broader State De-
partment were critical of Lutsenko’s 
failures. They were critical of his fail-
ure to prosecute corruption in Ukraine. 
This was the motivation for Lutsenko 
to give Giuliani and his associates false 
information on Biden and Burisma. 
And here is the point: Lutsenko and 
Shokin had grudges against Biden and 
Ambassador Yovanovitch. Why? Be-
cause they were implementing U.S. 
policy to fight corruption in Ukraine. 
Now, Giuliani and his associates had 
motive to harm Biden: to help get 
President Trump reelected. They had 
motive 
to 
remove 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch or anyone else who got in 
the way of their efforts to smear Biden. 
Giuliani admitted this. He told the 
New York Times that he spoke to 
President Trump about how Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch frustrated efforts 
that could be politically helpful to 
President Trump. Giuliani admitted 
this 
was 
all 
to 
benefit 
President 
Trump. Documents give us evidence of 
this scheme. WhatsApp exchanges that 
Parnas recently gave to Congress made 
clear that, in exchange for derogatory 
information about Biden, Lutsenko 
wanted Yovanovitch removed from her 
post in Kyiv. 
Here is that WhatsApp report. For 
example, on March 22, Lutsenko wrote: 
‘‘It’s just that if you don’t make a deci-
sion about Madam—you are bringing 
into question all my allegations, in-
cluding about B.’’ Now, here, ‘‘B’’ could 
either be Biden or Burisma or both, but 
‘‘Madam’’ is Ambassador Yovanovitch. 
In the March 22 text, Lutsenko im-
plied that, if Parnas wanted dirt on 
Biden—Burisma—he 
needed 
to 
do 
something 
about 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch. Days later, on March 28, 
Parnas assured Lutsenko that his ef-
forts were being recognized in the 
United States and that he would be re-
warded. Parnas wrote: 
I was asked to personally convey to you 
that America supports you and will not let 
you be harmed no matter how things look 
now. Soon everything will turn around and 
will be on the right course. Just so you 
know, here people are talking about you as a 
true Ukrainian hero. 
Lutsenko responded with the dirt 
that 
President 
Trump 
wanted. 
He 
wrote: ‘‘I have copies of payments from 
Burisma to Seneca.’’ Minutes after 
being reassured that ‘‘America sup-
ports you and will not let you be 
harmed,’’ Lutsenko claimed he had 
records of payments from Burisma to 
Rosemont Seneca Partners, a firm 
founded by Hunter Biden. This text 
message, along with others, shows that 
Lutsenko was providing derogatory in-
formation on the Bidens in exchange 
for Parnas pushing for Ambassador 
Yovanovitch’s removal. 
Now, in late March and throughout 
April 2019, the smear campaign against 
the Bidens and against Ambassador 
Yovanovitch entered a more public 
phase through a series of opinion pieces 
published in The Hill. The public airing 
of these allegations was orchestrated— 
orchestrated by Giuliani, Parnas, and 
Lutsenko. We know from records pro-
duced by Parnas that he played an im-
portant role in getting derogatory in-
formation from Lutsenko and his dep-
uty to John Solomon, who wrote the 
opinion pieces in The Hill. 
According 
to 
The 
Hill 
articles, 
Ukrainian officials falsely claimed to 
have evidence of wrongdoing about the 
following: One, Vice President Biden’s 
efforts in 2015 to remove Shokin; two, 
Hunter Biden’s role as a Burisma board 
member; three, Ukrainian interference 
in the 2016 election in favor of Hillary 
Clinton; and four, the misappropriation 
and transfer of Ukrainian funds abroad. 
This was what President Trump 
wanted from the Ukrainians: the same 
information 
Mr. 
Giuliani 
and 
his 
agents were scheming up with Ukraine 
to hurt Biden and, in exchange, to have 
Ambassador Yovanovitch removed. 
Now, Mr. Giuliani was very open 
about this, and here is a clip worth 
watching. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Let me tell you my interest in that. I got 
information about three or four months ago 
that a lot of the explanations for how this 
whole phony investigation started will be in 
the Ukraine, that there were a group of peo-
ple in the Ukraine that were working to help 
Hillary Clinton and were colluding really— 
[LAUGHTER]—with the Clinton campaign. 
And it stems around the ambassador and the 
embassy, being used for political purposes. 
So I began getting some people that were 
coming forward and telling me about that. 
And then all of a sudden, they revealed the 
story about Burisma and Biden’s son. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Giuliani 
got laughed at on FOX News for ad-
vancing the crowd source conspiracy 
theory, but the clip shows that he had 
been making an effort to get deroga-
tory information from the Ukrainians 
on behalf of his client, President 
Trump. 
My colleague Mrs. DEMINGS will now 
further detail how the scheme evolved. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I understand the 
presentations will continue for a while, 
and I would suggest a dinner break at 
6:30 for 30 minutes. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objec-
tion. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Chief Jus-
tice Roberts, Senators, and, of course, 
the counsel for the President, at this 
point, everything was going to plan. 
Mr. Giuliani was scheming with the 
corrupt Ukrainian prosecutors who 
were offering dirt on Biden that would 
help President Trump get reelected. 
They were pressing President Trump to 
remove Ambassador Yovanovitch, in-
cluding publicly tarnishing her reputa-
tion, 
based 
on 
false 
and 
baseless 
claims. 
But 
then 
the 
President’s 
scheme hit a roadblock. 
On April 21, President Zelensky— 
then the anti-corruption candidate— 
won a landslide victory in Ukraine’s 
Presidential 
election. 
U.S. 
officials 
unanimously testified that President 
Zelensky’s mandate to pursue reform 
would be good for our national secu-
rity. However, it was potentially bad 
news for President Trump’s scheme. 
Mr. Giuliani did not have a relation-
ship with Zelensky. As a reformer, he 
would be less amenable to announcing 
the 
sham 
investigations. 
Zelensky 
would not want to get dragged into 
U.S. domestic politics. 
Additionally, the election of a new 
Ukrainian President raised the concern 
that 
Lutsenko, 
with 
whom 
Mr. 
Giuliani had been plotting, would be 
replaced by a new Ukrainian pros-
ecutor general. A new prosecutor gen-
eral, especially one appointed in an 
anti-corruption regime, would likely be 
less willing to conduct sham investiga-
tions to please an American President. 
Mr. Giuliani decided to attack the 
issue from both sides. He pressed Presi-
dent Trump to remove Ambassador 
Yovanovitch, 
which 
would 
keep 
Lutsenko happy. He continued to work 
hard to get dirt on Biden. And he tried 
to get a meeting with Zelensky to se-
cure the new Ukrainian leader’s com-
mitment to press the investigations. 
This strategy played out on April 23 
and 24. 
First, 
on 
April 
23, 
Parnas 
and 
Fruman were in Israel, trying to ar-
range a meeting between Giuliani and 
the newly minted Ukrainian President 
Zelensky. 
On April 23, Giuliani left a voicemail 
message for Parnas. Let’s play that 
voicemail. 
Well, I was going to say it would be 
difficult to hear, but I am sure you 
cannot hear it at all. Let me tell you 
what it says. He says: 
It’s Rudy. When you get a chance, give me 
a call and bring me up to date okay? I got a 
couple of things to tell you too. 
Parnas and Giuliani eventually spoke 
on that same day. We have the phone 
records that prove that. According to 
phone records, Parnas and Giuliani had 
a 1-minute-50-second call. 
Fifteen minutes after they hung up, 
the records also show that Mr. Giuliani 
placed three short phone calls to the 
White House. Shortly thereafter, the 
White House called Giuliani back. 
Giuliani spoke with someone at the 
White House for 8 minutes and 28 sec-
onds. 
I will quickly note that at the time 
the Intelligence Committee issued its 
report in mid-December, we did not 
know whether that 8-minute-28-second 
call was from the White House. We 
have since received information from a 
telecom company that it was indeed 
the White House. 
We don’t have a recording of that 
call. Neither the White House nor 
Giuliani produced any information to 
Congress about what was discussed. Of 
course, the White House has refused, as 
you already know, to cooperate in any 
way. But even without the evidence 
that the White House is hiding—with

January 23, 2020 
the evidence we do have—these phone 
records prove that Mr. Giuliani was 
keeping 
President 
Trump 
informed 
about what was going on when he was 
trying to meet President Zelensky and 
get Ukraine to commit to the inves-
tigations. 
Let’s look at President Trump’s deci-
sion 
to 
remove 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch. Following the call be-
tween Mr. Giuliani and the White 
House 
on 
April 
23, 
Parnas 
asked 
Giuliani for an update. Parnas texted: 
‘‘Going to sleep my brother please text 
me or call me if you have any news. 
Giuliani responded: ‘‘He fired her 
again.’’ 
That was, of course, in reference to 
Ambassador Yovanovitch. Her removal 
would no doubt please the corrupt 
Ukrainian prosecutor, Lutsenko, who 
offered derogatory information about 
Hunter Biden. It also eliminated a po-
tential obstacle identified by Giuliani. 
Parnas responded: ‘‘I pray it happens 
this time I’ll call you tomorrow my 
brother.’’ 
And it did—because we know that the 
very next day, on April 24, Ambassador 
Yovanovitch 
received 
two 
frantic 
phone calls from Ambassador Carol 
Perez at the State Department. The 
second call came at 1 a.m. 
According 
to 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch, as you can see from the 
slide on the screen, the Director Gen-
eral of the Foreign Service told her 
that ‘‘there was a lot of concern for 
me, that I needed to be on the next 
plane home to Washington.’’ 
Yovanovitch recalled: 
And I was like, what? What happened? 
And Perez said: 
I don’t know, but this is about your secu-
rity. You need to come home immediately. 
You need to come home on the next plane. 
Yovanovitch asked what Perez meant 
by ‘‘physical security.’’ Perez ‘‘didn’t 
get that impression’’ but repeated that 
Yovanovitch needed ‘‘to come back im-
mediately.’’ This was no coincidence. 
Mr. Giuliani and his agents conspired 
to meet President Zelensky. They con-
spired for Ambassador Yovanovitch to 
be removed. Within hours of Mr. 
Giuliani saying he prayed Ambassador 
Yovanovitch would get fired, Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch got a frantic phone 
call to get on the next plane. 
That same day, on April 24, Giuliani 
appeared on ‘‘Fox & Friends’’ and pro-
moted the false conspiracy theories 
about Ukraine and Vice President 
Biden that were all part of this agree-
ment. Let’s look and listen to what he 
said. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
And I ask you to keep your eye on 
Ukraine, because in Ukraine, a lot of the 
dirty work was done digging up the informa-
tion. American officials were used, Ukrain-
ians officials were used. That’s collusion 
with Ukrainians. And, or actually in this 
case, conspiracy with the Ukrainians. I 
think you’d get some interesting informa-
tion about Joe Biden from Ukraine. About 
his son, Hunter Biden. About a company he 
was on the board of for years, which may be 
one of the most crooked companies in 
Ukraine. [Ukranian Russian company—not a 
Ukranian—you know, big difference there. 
Yanukovych—the guy they tossed out and 
Manafort got in all the trouble with—the 
guy who owns it worked for Yanukovych, 
pulled 10 billion out of the Ukraine, has been 
a fugitive—was a fugitive when Biden’s kid 
first went to work there.] And Biden bragged 
about the fact that he got the prosecutor 
general fired. The prosecutor general was in-
vestigating his son and then the investiga-
tion went south. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch was never provided 
a justification for her removal. She was 
an anti-corruption crusader, a highly 
respected diplomat. And she had been 
recently asked to extend her stay in 
Ukraine. 
While American Ambassadors serve 
at the pleasure of the President—we do 
understand that—I am sure you would 
all agree that the manner and cir-
cumstances surrounding the Ambas-
sador’s removal were unusual and 
raised questions of motive. 
Every witness who testified con-
firmed that there was no factual basis 
to the accusations Lutsenko lodged 
against 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch. 
Under Secretary of State David Hale, 
the most senior career diplomat at the 
State Department, testified that Maria 
Yovanovitch was an outstanding Am-
bassador and should have been per-
mitted to remain in Kyiv. 
Even more significant, several wit-
nesses testified that President Trump’s 
decision 
to 
remove 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch undercut U.S. national se-
curity objectives in Ukraine during a 
critical time. 
Dr. Hill, for example, explained that 
many of the key U.S. policies toward 
Ukraine were being implemented by 
the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv. And then 
suddenly ‘‘we had just then lost the 
leadership.’’ This created what Hill la-
beled ‘‘a period of uncertainty’’ as to 
how our government was going to exe-
cute U.S. policy. 
George Kent testified that the ouster 
of Ambassador Yovanovitch ‘‘hampered 
U.S. efforts to establish rapport with 
the new Zelensky administration in 
Ukraine.’’ 
So why did President Trump remove 
a distinguished career public servant 
Yanukovych and anti-corruption cru-
sader and a top diplomat in the State 
Department? 
We know why. The answer is simple: 
President Trump removed Ambassador 
Yovanovitch because she was in the 
way. She was in the way of the sham 
investigations that he so desperately 
wanted; investigations that would hurt 
former Vice President Biden and under-
mine the Mueller investigation into 
Russian election interference; inves-
tigations that would help him cheat in 
the 2020 election. 
Rudy Giuliani admitted that he per-
sonally told President Trump about his 
concern that Ambassador Yovanovitch 
was an obstacle to securing Ukrainian 
cooperation on the two bogus inves-
tigations they solicited from Ukraine. 
And Rudy Giuliani confirmed that 
President Trump decided to remove 
Ambassador Yovanovitch based on the 
bogus claim that she was obstructing 
his scheme to secure Ukraine’s co-
operation. Indeed, Mr. Giuliani was ex-
plicit about this when he told the New 
Yorker last month. He said: 
I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of 
the way. She was going to make the inves-
tigations difficult for everybody. 
So let’s recap. Mr. Giuliani and his 
agents, on behalf of President Trump, 
the United States President, worked 
with corrupt Ukrainians to get dirt on 
President Trump’s political opponent. 
Mr. Giuliani said this in press inter-
views. He texted about it with his 
agents, and he repeatedly called the 
White House. 
Following the election of a new 
Ukrainian leader committed to fight-
ing corruption, President Trump re-
moved Ambassador Yovanovitch, an 
anti-corruption 
crusader, 
and 
Mr. 
Giuliani told us why: to get her out of 
the way for the investigations to move 
forward. That is how far President 
Trump was willing to go to get his in-
vestigations. To smear a highly re-
spected, dedicated Foreign Service offi-
cer who had served this country unself-
ishly for his own selfish political inter-
ests is disgraceful. 
Even with the removal of Ambas-
sador 
Yovanovitch, 
President 
Zelensky’s election victory threw a 
wrench into the President’s scheme. 
That is because Lutsenko was report-
edly going to be replaced. After Mr. 
Giuliani told the New York Times on 
May 9 that he intended to travel to 
Ukraine on behalf of President Trump 
in order to ‘‘meddle in an investiga-
tion,’’ 
Ukrainian 
officials 
publicly 
pushed back. Please hear what I said. 
Ukrainian officials publicly pushed 
back on the suggestions of corruptions 
proposed by Mr. Giuliani, who was 
working on behalf of the U.S. Presi-
dent. 
Well, Mr. Giuliani canceled his trip 
on May 10 and claimed on FOX News 
that 
President 
Zelensky 
was 
sur-
rounded by ‘‘enemies’’ of President 
Trump. Let’s listen. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GIULIANI. I decided, Sharon, I’m not 
going to go to Ukraine. 
Ms. BREAM. You are not going to go? 
Mr. GIULIANI. I am not going to go be-
cause I think I’m walking into a group of 
people that are enemies of the President. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. It appears 
Giuliani’s statement influenced Presi-
dent Trump’s view of Ukraine, as well. 
At an Oval Office meeting on May 23, 
U.S. officials learned of Giuliani’s in-
fluence. Ambassador Volker testified 
that President Trump ‘‘didn’t believe’’ 
the positive assessment government of-
ficials gave the new Ukrainian Presi-
dent. Instead, President Trump told 
them that Giuliani ‘‘knows all of these 
things’’ 
and 
said 
that 
President 
Zelensky has ‘‘some bad people around 
him.’’ At this point, the scheme had 
stalled. Mr. Giuliani and the President 
knew that they were going to have

January 23, 2020 
trouble with President Zelensky ful-
filling his corrupt demand for inves-
tigations that would benefit President 
Trump’s reelection campaign. 
That brings us to the next phase of 
this scheme. Although his corrupt 
scheme was in trouble due to the unex-
pected results of the Ukrainian elec-
tion—the election which yielded an 
anti-corruption 
reformer—President 
Trump doubled down on his scheme to 
solicit investigations for his personal 
benefit. 
In May of 2019, with a gap in Amer-
ican leadership in Ukraine after Am-
bassador Yovanovitch was removed, 
President Trump enlisted U.S. officials 
to help to do his political work. The 
scheme grew from false allegations by 
disgruntled, corrupt Ukrainian pros-
ecutors to a plot by the President of 
the United States to extort the new 
Ukrainian President into announcing 
his political investigations. During the 
May 23 Oval Office meeting, President 
Trump directed Ambassador Sondland, 
Ambassador 
Volker, 
and 
Secretary 
Perry to work with Mr. Giuliani on 
Ukraine. Giuliani had made clear he 
was pursuing investigations for Presi-
dent Trump in a personal capacity. He 
said publicly, on numerous instances, 
that he was only working for the Presi-
dent in a personal capacity and not on 
foreign policy. Yet President Trump 
still told White House officials that 
they had to work with Mr. Giuliani to 
get anywhere on Ukraine. We heard 
significant testimony on this point. 
For example, Ambassador Volker re-
called that at the Oval Office meeting 
on May 23, President Trump directed 
the U.S. officials to ‘‘talk to Rudy.’’ 
Ambassador Sondland testified that 
President Trump directed them to 
‘‘talk to Rudy.’’ In that moment, the 
U.S. diplomats saw the writing on the 
wall and concluded ‘‘that if we did not 
talk to Rudy, nothing would move for-
ward, nothing would move forward on 
Ukraine.’’ Pay attention to Ambas-
sador Sondland’s testimony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. In response to 
our persistent efforts in that meeting to 
change his views, President Trump directed 
us to, quote, ‘‘talk with Rudy.’’ We under-
stood that ‘‘talk with Rudy’’ meant, talk 
with Mr. Rudy Giuliani, the President’s per-
sonal lawyer. 
Let me say again, we weren’t happy with 
the President’s directive to talk with Rudy. 
We did not want to involve Mr. Giuliani. I 
believe then, as I do now, that the men and 
women of the State Department, not the 
President’s personal lawyer, should take re-
sponsibility for Ukraine matters. 
Nonetheless, based on the President’s di-
rection, we were faced with a choice. We 
could abandon the efforts to schedule the 
White House phone call and the White House 
visit 
between 
Presidents 
Trump 
and 
Zelensky, which was unquestionably in our 
foreign policy interest, or we could do as 
President Trump had directed and talk with 
Rudy. We chose the latter, of course, not be-
cause we liked it, but because it was the only 
constructive path open to us. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. And just 
like that, U.S. officials charged with 
advancing U.S. foreign policy—U.S. of-
ficials who were supposed to act in our 
country’s interest—were directed to, 
instead, advance President Trump’s 
personal interests. From that point on, 
they worked with the President’s per-
sonal agent on political investigations 
to benefit the President’s reelection. 
Their work on President Trump’s be-
half to solicit foreign interference in 
our elections continued throughout all 
of June. For instance, on June 21, Mr. 
Giuliani 
tweeted 
that 
President 
Zelensky had not yet publicly com-
mitted on two politically motivated in-
vestigations designed to benefit Presi-
dent Trump. And when Mr. Giuliani’s 
public efforts and his tweets didn’t 
move President Zelensky to announce 
the investigations, he used U.S. dip-
lomats as directed by President Trump. 
This is important. 
After Giuliani canceled his trip to 
Ukraine in May and commented that 
President-elect Zelensky had enemies 
of 
President 
Trump 
around 
him, 
Giuliani had minimal access to the new 
Ukrainian leader’s inner circle. His pri-
mary Ukraine connection, Prosecutor 
General Lutsenko, had already been in-
formed that he would be removed as 
soon as the new Parliament convened. 
So President Trump gave him U.S. dip-
lomats and directed them to work with 
Mr. Giuliani on his scheme. As you 
heard, President Trump told Ambas-
sadors Sondland and Volker to talk 
with Rudy and work with Rudy on 
Ukraine. And what did that mean? 
Well, Mr. Giuliani tried to use Ambas-
sador Sondland and Volker to gain ac-
cess to President Zelensky and his 
inner circle through their official State 
Department channels and made clear 
to President Zelensky that he had to 
announce the investigations. 
On June 27, Ambassador Sondland 
brought Ambassador Taylor up to 
speed on Ukraine since Ambassador 
Taylor had just arrived in the country 
a few weeks beforehand. Ambassador 
Sondland 
explained 
that 
President 
Zelensky needed to make clear that he 
was not standing in the way of the in-
vestigations 
that 
President 
Trump 
wanted—that President Zelensky need-
ed to make clear that he was not 
standing in the way of the investiga-
tions that President Trump wanted. 
And here is his testimony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. On June 27th, Am-
bassador Sondland told me during a phone 
conversation that President Zelensky needed 
to make clear to President Trump that he, 
President Zelensky, was not standing in the 
way of investigations. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Ambas-
sador Taylor relayed this conversation 
to one of his deputies, U.S. Diplomat 
David Holmes, who testified that he 
understood the investigations to mean 
the 
‘‘Burisma-Biden 
investigations 
that Mr. Giuliani and his associates 
had been speaking about’’ publicly. 
Let’s listen to Mr. Holmes. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. HOLMES. On June 27th, Ambassador 
Sondland told Ambassador Taylor in a phone 
conversation, the gist of which Ambassador 
Taylor shared with me at the time, that 
President Zelensky needed to make clear to 
President Trump that President Zelensky 
was not standing in the way of, quote, ‘‘in-
vestigations.’’ I understood that this meant 
the Biden/Burisma investigations that Mr. 
Giuliani and his associates had been speak-
ing about in the media since March. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Even with 
the addition of President Trump’s po-
litical appointees to aid Mr. Giuliani’s 
efforts, President Zelensky did not an-
nounce the investigations. As Mr. 
Giuliani’s June 21 tweet shows, the 
Ukrainian 
President 
was 
resisting 
President Trump’s pressure. 
So what happened? Well, that brings 
us to the President’s next official act: 
turning up the pressure by condi-
tioning an official White House meet-
ing on Ukraine announcing his polit-
ical investigations. 
Senators, I know we have covered a 
lot of ground, but as we have shown, 
there is overwhelming and uncontra-
dicted 
evidence 
of 
the 
President’s 
scheme to solicit foreign interference 
in this year’s Presidential election. 
Let me say this also. Each time that 
we remind this body of the President’s 
scheme to cheat, to win, some of his 
defenders say that we are only con-
cerned about winning the next elec-
tion—the Democrats are only doing 
this to win the next election. 
But you know better because this 
trial is much bigger than any one elec-
tion, and it is much bigger than any 
one President. This moment is about 
the American people. Whether a maid 
or a janitor, whether a nurse, a teach-
er, or a truck driver, whether a doctor 
or a mechanic, this moment is about 
ensuring that their votes matter and 
that American elections are decided by 
the American people. 
President Trump acted corruptly. He 
abused the power of his office by order-
ing U.S. diplomats to work with his po-
litical agent to solicit two politically 
motivated investigations by Ukraine. 
The investigations were designed solely 
to help his personal interests, not our 
national interests. Neither investiga-
tion solicited by President Trump had 
anything to do with promoting U.S. 
foreign policy or U.S. national secu-
rity. Indeed, as we will discuss later, 
both investigations and the President’s 
broader scheme to secure Ukraine’s in-
terference was a threat. It was a 
threat. It was a threat to our national 
security. The only person who stood to 
benefit from the abuse of office and so-
licitation of these investigations was 
Donald Trump—the 45th President of 
the United States. 
This was a violation of public trust 
and a failure to take care that the laws 
be faithfully executed, but when it 
came down to choosing between the na-
tional interests of the country and his 
own 
personal 
interests—his 
reelec-
tion—President Trump chose himself. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief 
Justice, the distinguished Members of 
the Senate, the counsel to the Presi-
dent, and all of those who are assem-
bled here today, earlier this morning, I

was on my way to the office, and I ran 
into a fellow New Yorker who just hap-
pens to work here in Washington, DC. 
He said to me: Congressman, have 
you heard the latest outrage? 
I wasn’t really sure what he was talk-
ing about. So, to be honest, I thought 
to myself, Well, the President is now 
back in town. What has Donald Trump 
done now? So I said to him: What out-
rage are you talking about? 
He paused for a moment, and then he 
said to me: Someone voted against 
Derek Jeter on his Hall of Fame ballot. 
(Laughter.) 
Life is all about perspective. 
I understand that, as House man-
agers, we certainly hope we can sub-
poena John Bolton and subpoena Mick 
Mulvaney, but perhaps we can all agree 
to subpoena the Baseball Hall of Fame 
to try to figure out who, out of 397 indi-
viduals, was the one person who voted 
against Derek Jeter. 
I was thinking about that as I pre-
pared to rise today, because what is 
more American than baseball and apple 
pie? Perhaps the one thing that falls 
into that category is the sanctity and 
continuity of the U.S. Constitution. 
As House managers, we are here in 
this august body because we believe it 
is necessary to defend our democracy. 
Some of you may agree with us at the 
end of the day, and others most likely 
will not, but we do want to thank you 
for your courtesy and for your patience 
in extending to us the opportunity to 
present our case with dignity to you 
and to the American people during this 
solemn constitutional moment. 
I want to speak for just some time on 
the second official act that President 
Trump used to corruptly abuse his 
power, which was the withholding of an 
official Oval Office meeting with the 
President of Ukraine. 
As discussed yesterday, ‘‘quid pro 
quo’’ is a Latin term. It means ‘‘this 
for that.’’ 
President Trump refused to schedule 
that Oval Office meeting until the 
Ukrainian leader announced the phony 
political investigations that he de-
manded on July 25. He knew President 
Zelensky needed the meeting to bolster 
his standing. He knew that Ukraine 
was a fragile democracy. He knew that 
President Zelensky needed the meeting 
to show Vladimir Putin that he had the 
support of Donald Trump, but Presi-
dent Trump exploited that desperation 
for his own political benefit—this for 
that. Did a quid pro quo exist? The an-
swer is yes. 
Let’s listen to Ambassador Sondland 
on this point. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Amb. SONDLAND. I know that members of 
this committee frequently frame these com-
plicated issues in the form of a simple ques-
tion. Was there a quid pro quo? As I testified 
previously with regard to the requested 
White House call and the White House meet-
ing, the answer is yes. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Did Presi-
dent Trump abuse his power and com-
mit an impeachable offense? The an-
swer is yes. 
The phony political investigations 
that President Trump demanded from 
Ukraine were part of a scheme to sabo-
tage a political rival—Joe Biden—and 
cheat in the 2020 election. No national 
interest was served. The President used 
his awesome power to help himself and 
not the American people. He must be 
held accountable. 
The President’s defenders may argue, 
as Mick Mulvaney tried to, that quid 
pro quo arrangements are a common 
aspect of U.S. foreign policy. Nonsense. 
There are situations where official 
United States acts, like head-of-state 
meetings or the provision of foreign as-
sistance, are used to advance the na-
tional interests of the United States. 
That is not what happened here. Here, 
President Trump sought to advance his 
own personal political interests, facili-
tated by Rudolph Giuliani, the human 
hand grenade. 
Let’s walk through the overwhelming 
evidence of how President Trump with-
held an official White House meeting, 
which 
was 
vitally 
important 
to 
Ukraine, as part of a corrupt scheme to 
convince President Zelensky to an-
nounce two phony political investiga-
tions. 
First, the Oval Office meeting Presi-
dent Trump corruptly withheld con-
stitutes 
an 
official 
act. 
President 
Trump chose to withhold this meeting 
for a reason. It was not some run-of- 
the-mill meeting. It was one of the 
most powerful tools he could wield in 
his role as the leader of the free world. 
It would have demonstrated U.S. sup-
port for Ukraine’s newly elected leader 
at a critical time. Ukraine is under re-
lentless attack by Russian-backed sep-
aratists in Crimea and in the East. 
Ukraine desperately needed an Oval Of-
fice meeting, and President Trump 
knew it. 
Second, President Trump withheld 
that Oval Office meeting to increase 
pressure on Ukraine to assist his re-
election campaign by announcing two 
phony investigations. As my colleagues 
have detailed extensively throughout 
the day, this is a classic quid pro quo. 
Third, multiple administration offi-
cials, including the President’s own 
handpicked supporters and appointees, 
confirmed that a corrupt exchange was 
being sought. 
Finally, 
contemporaneous 
docu-
mentation makes clear that the Presi-
dent corruptly abused his power to ad-
vance the scheme to try and cheat in 
the 2020 election—this for that. 
Let’s explore whether the granting or 
the denial of an Oval Office meeting 
constitutes an official act. 
As we discussed earlier today, an 
abuse of power occurs when the Presi-
dent exercises his official power to ob-
tain a corrupt personal benefit while 
ignoring or injuring the national inter-
ests. 
Pursuant to the Constitution and 
more than 200 years of tradition, as 
President, Donald Trump is America’s 
head of state and chief diplomat. Arti-
cle II grants the President wide lati-
tude to conduct diplomacy and to, spe-
cifically, 
receive 
Ambassadors 
and 
other public Ministers. The President 
decides which head-of-state meetings 
best advance the national interests and 
which foreign leaders are deserving of 
an official reception in the Oval Of-
fice—perhaps one of the most pres-
tigious nonreligious venues in the 
world. 
In diplomacy, perception matters. 
Meetings between heads of state are 
make-or-break moments that can de-
termine the trajectory of global events, 
and a meeting with the President of 
the United States in the Oval Office is 
unquestionably monumental, particu-
larly for a fragile democracy like 
Ukraine. 
The Oval Office is where foreign lead-
ers facing challenges at home go—like 
a war with Russia—in pursuit of a 
strong and public demonstration of 
American support. That is especially 
true in this particular case. The deci-
sion to grant or withhold an Oval Of-
fice meeting to President Zelensky has 
profound consequences for the national 
security interests of both Ukraine and 
the United States. 
To understand the full context of 
President Trump’s corrupt demands to 
the Ukrainian leader, it is important 
to consider the geopolitical context— 
that all of you are very familiar with— 
confronting the Ukrainian people. 
Ukraine is at war with Russia. In 
2014, Russia annexed Crimea by force. 
The United States and other European 
countries rallied to Ukraine’s defense, 
providing economic assistance, diplo-
matic support, and later, with strong 
advocacy from this body, lethal aid. 
This support meant Russia faced con-
sequences for its aggression. 
Here is Ambassador Yovanovitch’s 
testimony explaining just how impor-
tant the United States is to Ukraine. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Amb. YOVANOVITCH. The U.S. relation-
ship for Ukraine is the single most impor-
tant relationship, and so I think that Presi-
dent Zelensky, any president, would do what 
they could to lean in on a favor request. I’m 
not saying that that’s a yes, I’m saying they 
would try to lean in and see what they could 
do. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Fair to say that a presi-
dent of Ukraine that is so dependent on the 
United States would do just about anything 
within his power to please the president of 
the United States if he could? 
Amb. YOVANOVITCH. If he could. I’m sure 
there are limits, and I understand there were 
a lot of discussions in the Ukrainian govern-
ment about all of this, but yeah, we are an 
important relationship on the security side 
and on the political side. And so, the presi-
dent of Ukraine, one of the most important 
functions that individual has is to make sure 
the relationship with the U.S. is rock solid. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. But it isn’t 
just the relationship itself. It was a 
public meeting in the White House that 
would show U.S. support for Ukraine. 
A meeting with the President of the 
United States in the Oval Office is one 
of the most forceful diplomatic signals 
of support that the United States can 
send.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S512 
January 23, 2020 
Veteran diplomat George Kent testi-
fied to this. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. KENT. New leaders, particularly coun-
tries that are trying to have good footing in 
the international arena, see a meeting with 
the US president in the Oval Office at the 
White House as the ultimate sign of endorse-
ment and support from the United States. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. President 
Zelensky was a newly elected leader. 
He was swept into office on the pledge 
to end pervasive corruption. He also 
had a mandate to negotiate an end to 
the war with Russia. To achieve both 
goals, he needed strong U.S. support, 
particularly from President Trump, 
which Zelensky sought in the form of a 
White House meeting. 
David Holmes, political counselor to 
the Embassy in Kyiv, described the 
particular importance of a White House 
visit to Ukraine in the context of its 
war with Russia. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. HOLMES. It is important to under-
stand that a White House visit was critical 
to President Zelensky. President Zelensky 
needed to show U.S. support at the highest 
levels in order to demonstrate to Russian 
President Putin that he had U.S. backing, as 
well 
as 
to 
advance 
his 
ambitious 
anticorruption agenda at home. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. In other 
words, Ukraine knew that Russia was 
watching carefully. 
That was particularly true in the 
spring of 2019, when Donald Trump 
launched the scheme at the center of 
the abuse of power charge. 
During this time period, Vladimir 
Putin was preparing for peace negotia-
tions with the new Ukrainian leader. 
Putin could choose to escalate or he 
could choose to deescalate Russian ag-
gression. And influencing his decision 
was an assessment of whether Presi-
dent Trump had Ukraine’s back. 
(Text of Videotape presentation.) 
Amb. TAYLOR. The Russians, as I said in 
my deposition, ‘‘would love to see the humil-
iation of President Zelensky at the hands of 
the Americans.’’ 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. An Oval Of-
fice meeting would have sent a strong 
signal of support that President Trump 
had Ukraine’s back. The absence of 
such a meeting could be devastating. 
Indeed, Ukraine made very clear to the 
United States just how important a 
White House meeting between the two 
heads of State was for its fragile de-
mocracy. 
At the deposition, as the one on the 
screen 
reveals, 
LTC 
Alexander 
Vindman, the director for Ukraine on 
the National Security Council, recalled 
that following President Zelensky’s in-
auguration, at every single meeting 
with Ukrainian officials, they asked 
their American counterparts about the 
status of an Oval Office meeting be-
tween the two Presidents. 
Initially, the Ukrainians had reason 
to be optimistic that a White House 
meeting would be promptly scheduled. 
On 
April 
21, 
during 
President 
Zelensky’s first call with President 
Trump, 
the 
new 
Ukrainian 
leader 
asked about a White House visit three 
times. As part of that brief congratula-
tory call, President Trump himself did 
extend an invitation. Ukraine’s depend-
ence on the United States and its des-
perate need for a White House meeting 
created an unequal power dynamic be-
tween the two Presidents. 
As Lieutenant Colonel Vindman tes-
tified, it is that unequal power dy-
namic that turned any subsequent re-
quest for a favor from the President 
into a demand. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
The CHAIRMAN. Colonel, you’ve described 
this as a demand, this favor that the Presi-
dent asked. What is it about the relationship 
between the President of the United States 
and the President of Ukraine that leads you 
to conclude that when the President of the 
United States asks a favor like this, it’s real-
ly a demand? 
Lieutenant Colonel VINDMAN. Chairman, 
the culture I come from, the military cul-
ture, when a senior asks you to do some-
thing, even if it’s polite and pleasant, it’s 
not—it’s not to be taken as a request, it’s to 
be taken as an order. 
In this case, the power disparity between 
the two leaders, my impression is that, in 
order to get the White House meeting, Presi-
dent Zelensky would have to deliver these 
investigations. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Ambassador 
Gordon Sondland, Trump appointee, 
also acknowledged the importance of 
this power disparity and how it made 
President Zelensky eager to satisfy 
President Trump’s wishes. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Holmes then said that he 
heard President Trump ask, quote, ‘‘is he,’’ 
meaning Zelensky, ‘‘going to do the inves-
tigation?’’ To which you replied, ‘‘he’s going 
to do it.’’ And then you added that President 
Zelensky will do anything that you, meaning 
President Trump, ask him to. Do you recall 
that? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. I probably said 
something to that effect because I remember 
the meeting—the President—or President 
Zelensky was very—‘‘solicitous’’ is not a 
good word. He was just very willing to work 
with the United States and was being very 
amicable. And so putting it in Trump speak 
by saying he loves your ass, he’ll do what-
ever you want, meant that he would really 
work with us on a whole host of issues. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. He was not only willing. 
He was very eager, right? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. That’s fair. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Because Ukraine depends 
on the United States as its most significant 
ally. Isn’t that correct? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. One of its most, 
absolutely. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. In other 
words, any request President Trump 
made to Ukraine would be difficult to 
refuse. 
So when President Trump asked 
Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, as 
well as the wild conspiracy theory 
about the 2016 election, those were ab-
solutely 
interpreted 
by 
President 
Zelensky and his staff as a demand. 
And that is where the White House 
meeting enters into the equation. 
When Ukraine did not immediately 
cave to Rudy Giuliani in the spring and 
announce the phony investigations, 
President Trump ratcheted up the pres-
sure. As leverage, he chose the White 
House meeting he dangled during his 
April 21 call, precisely because Presi-
dent Trump knew how important the 
meeting was to Ukraine. 
Following their visit to Kyiv for the 
new Ukrainian leader’s inauguration, 
Ambassador 
Sondland, 
Ambassador 
Volker, and Secretary Perry met with 
President Trump, and each of them en-
couraged the President to schedule the 
meeting. Here is what Ambassador 
Sondland had to say. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Amb. SONDLAND. We advised the presi-
dent of the strategic importance of Ukraine 
and the value of strengthening the relation-
ship with President Zelensky. To support 
this reformer, we asked the White House for 
two things. First, a working phone call be-
tween Presidents Trump and Zelensky, and 
second, a working oval office visit. In our 
view, both were vital to cementing the US- 
Ukraine relationship, demonstrating support 
for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression 
and advancing broader US foreign policy in-
terests. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. So even 
though this meeting was critical to 
both Ukraine and America, President 
Trump ignored all of his policy advis-
ers and expressed reluctance to meet 
with the new Ukrainian President. He 
refused to schedule an actual date. 
He claimed that Ukraine ‘‘tried to 
take me down’’ in 2016 and directed 
that three U.S. officials ‘‘talk to 
Rudy.’’ And even though on May 29 the 
President signed a letter reiterating 
his earlier invitation for President 
Zelensky to visit the White House, he 
still did not specify a date. 
But then President Trump went fur-
ther. He met with Ukraine’s adversary, 
Ukraine’s enemy, our enemy. President 
Trump met with Russia. 
This didn’t go unnoticed. Ukrainian 
officials became concerned when Presi-
dent Trump scheduled that face-to-face 
meeting with Vladimir Putin at the 
G20 summit in Japan on June 28. 
Mr. Holmes testified on this par-
ticular point and the troubling signal 
that meeting sent to our friend, to our 
ally, Ukraine. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. HOLMES. Also, on June 28th, while 
President Trump was still not moving for-
ward on a meeting with President Zelensky, 
we met with . . . He met with Russian Presi-
dent Putin at the G20 Summit in Osaka, 
Japan, sending a further signal of lack of 
support to Ukraine. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Now, let’s 
discuss how exactly President Trump 
used the withholding of the White 
House meeting to pressure Ukraine for 
his phony investigations—his quid pro 
quo scheme. 
It is important to understand that 
the pressure exerted on Ukraine by de-
laying the White House meeting didn’t 
just occur right before the July 25 call. 
That pressure existed during the entire 
scheme, and it continues to this day. 
We know this from the efforts of ad-
ministration officials to secure the 
meeting and from the Ukrainians con-
tinuously trying to lock down a date.

S513 
January 23, 2020 
For example, even after President 
Trump 
expressed 
reluctance 
about 
Ukraine on May 23, his administration 
officials continued working to secure a 
White House meeting. 
On July 10, for instance, they raised 
it 
again 
when 
Mr. 
Yermak 
and 
Ukraine’s national security advisor 
met with John Bolton at the White 
House. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Dr. HILL. And then we knew that the 
Ukrainians would have on their agenda, in-
evitably, the question about a meeting. As 
we get through the main discussion, we are 
going into that wrap-up phase. The Ukrain-
ians, Mr. Danylyuk, starts to ask about a 
White 
House 
meeting 
and 
Ambassador 
Bolton was trying to parry this back. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. As you have 
seen, President Zelensky didn’t just 
raise the Oval Office meeting on his 
April 21 call, he raised the meeting on 
the July 25 call with President Trump 
again. 
President Zelensky said on the July 
25 call: ‘‘I also wanted to thank you for 
your invitation to visit the United 
States, specifically Washington, DC.’’ 
After the July 25 call, the Ukrainians 
continued to press for the meeting, but 
that meeting never happened. 
Only on September 25, after the 
House announced its investigation into 
the President’s misconduct as it re-
lates to Ukraine and the existence of a 
whistleblower complaint became pub-
lic, did President Trump and President 
Zelensky meet face-to-face for the first 
time. That meeting was on the side-
lines of the U.N. General Assembly in 
New York. It was dominated by public 
release of the July 25 call record that 
occurred the day before. It was a far 
cry from the demonstration of strong 
support that would have been achieved 
by an Oval Office meeting. 
Even President Zelensky recognized 
that a face-to-face talk on the sidelines 
of the United Nations General Assem-
bly was not the same as an official 
Oval Office meeting. Sitting next to 
President Trump in New York, he 
again raised a White House meeting. 
Here is what President Zelensky said: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
President ZELENSKY. And I want to 
thank you for the invitation to Washington. 
You invited me, but I think—I’m sorry, but 
I think you forgot to tell me the date. But I 
think in the near future. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. President 
Trump was not just withholding a 
small thing; the Oval Office meeting 
was a big deal. Ukraine remains at war 
with Russia. It desperately needs our 
support. As a result, the pressure on 
Ukraine 
not 
to 
upset 
President 
Trump—who still refuses to meet with 
President Zelensky in the Oval Office— 
continues to this day. 
David 
Holmes 
testified 
that 
the 
Ukrainian Government wants an Oval 
Office meeting even after the release of 
the security assistance and that our 
own U.S. national security objectives 
would also benefit from such a meet-
ing. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. HOLMES. And although the hold on 
the security assistance may have been lifted, 
there were still things they wanted that they 
weren’t getting, including a meeting with 
the President in the Oval Office. Whether the 
hold, the security assistance hold continued 
or not, the Ukrainians understood that 
that’s something the President wanted and 
they still wanted important things from the 
President. That continues to this day. We 
have to be very careful. They still need us 
now going forward. 
In fact, right now President Zelensky is 
trying to arrange a summit meeting with 
President Putin in the coming weeks, his 
first face-to-face meeting with him to try to 
advance the peace process. He needs our sup-
port. He needs President Putin to understand 
that America supports Zelensky at the high-
est levels. So this doesn’t end with the lift-
ing of the security assistance hold. Ukraine 
still needs us, and as I said, still fighting this 
war this very day. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Let’s evalu-
ate exactly how President Trump made 
clear to Ukraine that a White House 
meeting was conditioned on Ukraine 
announcing two phony political inves-
tigations that would help with Presi-
dent Trump’s reelection in 2020—help 
him cheat and corrupt our democracy. 
By the end of May, it was clear that 
President Trump’s pressure campaign 
to solicit foreign election interference 
wasn’t working. President Zelensky 
had been elected and was rebuffing Mr. 
Giuliani’s overtures. Even when Presi-
dent Trump directed his official staff 
to work with Mr. Giuliani in an effort 
to get President Zelensky to announce 
the two phony political investigations, 
that didn’t work. So President Trump 
apparently realized that he had to in-
crease the pressure. That is when he 
explicitly made clear to Ukraine that 
it would not get the desperately sought 
after Oval Office meeting unless Presi-
dent Zelensky publicly announced the 
phony investigations that President 
Trump sought. 
On July 2, 2019, Ambassador Volker 
personally communicated the need for 
investigations directly to President 
Zelensky during a meeting in Toronto. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador VOLKER. After weeks of reas-
suring the Ukrainians that it was just a 
scheduling issue, I decided to tell President 
Zelensky that we had a problem with the in-
formation reaching President Trump from 
Mayor Giuliani. I did so in a bilateral meet-
ing at a conference on Ukrainian economic 
reform in Toronto on July 2, 2019, where I led 
the U.S. delegation. 
I suggested that he call President Trump 
directly in order to renew their personal re-
lationship and to assure President Trump 
that he was committed to investigating and 
fighting corruption, things on which Presi-
dent Zelensky had based his Presidential 
campaign. I was convinced that getting the 
two Presidents to talk with each other would 
overcome the negative perception of Ukraine 
that President Trump still harbored. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. After Am-
bassador Volker instructed President 
Zelensky in Toronto on what to do, he 
updated Ambassador Taylor on his ac-
tions. He told Ambassador Taylor that 
he had counseled the Ukrainian Presi-
dent on how to ‘‘prepare for the phone 
call with President Trump.’’ He also 
told Ambassador Taylor that he ad-
vised Zelensky that President Trump 
‘‘would like to hear about the inves-
tigations.’’ 
In addition to Ambassador Volker’s 
direct outreach to President Zelensky, 
Ambassador Sondland continued to 
apply pressure as well during two 
White House meetings that took place 
on July 10 with Ukrainian officials. 
The first meeting included National 
Security Advisor John Bolton, Dr. 
Fiona Hill, LTC Alexander Vindman, 
Secretary 
Rick 
Perry, 
Ambassador 
Volker, as well as Bolton’s Ukrainian 
counterpart 
and 
Ukrainian 
Presi-
dential aide Andriy Yermak. 
After discussion on Ukraine’s na-
tional security reform plans, Ambas-
sador Sondland broached the subject of 
the phony political investigations. 
Fiona Hill, who also attended the 
meeting, 
recalled 
that 
Ambassador 
Sondland blurted out the following in 
that meeting with the Ukrainians: 
‘‘Well, we have an agreement with the 
Chief of Staff for a meeting if these in-
vestigations 
in 
the 
energy 
sector 
start.’’ That is code for Burisma, which 
is code for the Bidens. 
Ambassador Volker also recalled that 
Ambassador Sondland raised the issue 
of the 2016 election and Burisma inves-
tigations. Ambassador Volker found 
Ambassador Sondland’s comments in 
that meeting to be inappropriate. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador VOLKER. I participated in the 
July 10 meeting between National Security 
Advisor Bolton and then-Chairman of the 
National Security Defense Council, Alex 
Danyliuk. As I remember, the meeting was 
essentially over when Ambassador Sondland 
made a general comment about investiga-
tions. I think all of us thought it was inap-
propriate. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. The ex-
change underscores that by early July, 
President Trump’s demand for inves-
tigations had come to totally dominate 
almost every aspect of U.S. foreign pol-
icy 
toward 
Ukraine. 
Securing 
a 
Ukrainian commitment to do inves-
tigations was a major priority of senior 
U.S. diplomats, as directed by Presi-
dent Donald John Trump. 
The July 10 meetings also confirmed 
that the scheme to pressure Ukraine 
into opening investigations was not a 
rogue operation but one blessed by sen-
ior administration officials at 1600 
Pennsylvania Avenue. As Ambassador 
Sondland testified, ‘‘Everyone was in 
the loop.’’

The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority

Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
after 
consulting 
with 
Congressman 
SCHIFF, it looks like roughly 10:30 to-

somewhere between now and 10:30. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief 
Justice, distinguished Members of the 
Senate, counsel to the President, my 
colleagues, the American people, the 
second 
official 
act 
that 
President 
Trump used to corruptly abuse his 
power was the withholding of an Oval 
Office meeting with the President of 
Ukraine. 
Before we took the break, we started 
walking through the overwhelming evi-
dence about how President Trump 
withheld this official White House 
meeting that was vitally important to 
Ukraine as part of a corrupt scheme to 
convince President Zelensky to an-
nounce two phony political investiga-
tions. These investigations were en-
tirely unrelated to any official U.S. 
policy and solely benefited President 
Trump. 
We talked about why withholding the 
meeting was so significant to our ally 
Ukraine. Ukraine is a fragile democ-
racy, under relentless attack from Rus-
sian-backed separatists in the east. 
U.S. support is vitally important to 
Ukraine in that war. They desperately 
need our support. They desperately 
need our assistance. 
Because of this vast power disparity, 
President Trump had immense power 
over Ukraine, and President Trump 
knew it. So when President Trump 
asked for a favor on a July 25 call, he 
knew that President Zelensky would 
feel incredible pressure to do exactly 
what President Trump wanted. 
President Trump used his agents— 
both his administration appointees and 
his 
personal 
attorney, 
Rudolph 
Giuliani—to make clear to Ukraine, 
even in early July, that the much- 
needed White House meeting they re-
quested would only occur if they an-
nounced these phony political inves-
tigations. 
To be clear, as Ambassador Sondland 
testified, ‘‘everyone was in the loop.’’ 
That includes Acting Chief of Staff 
Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State 
Mike Pompeo, and Secretary of Energy 
Rick Perry. 
Even ahead of the July 25 call, Am-
bassador Sondland was in close, re-
peated contact with these officials. His 
mission: Schedule a telephone con-
versation 
during 
which 
the 
new 
Ukrainian 
leader 
would 
personally 
commit to do the phony investigations 
sought by President Trump in order to 
unlock a meeting in the Oval Office— 
this for that, a quid pro quo. 
This isn’t just based on the testi-
mony of witnesses. It is corroborated 
by texts and emails as well. Let’s look 
at some of that evidence now. 
On July 13, for example, Ambassador 
Sondland emailed National Security 
Council official Timothy Morrison and 
made the case for President Trump to 
call the Ukrainian leader prior to the 
parliamentary elections scheduled for 
July 21. In that email, as the high-
lighted 
text 
shows, 
Ambassador 
Sondland said the ‘‘sole purpose’’ of the 
call was to assure President Trump 
that investigations would be allowed to 
move forward. In other words, to get 
the Oval Office meeting, President 
Zelensky had to move forward on the 
phony political investigations, part of 
the scheme to cheat in the 2020 Presi-
dential campaign—this for that. 
On July 19, Ambassador Sondland 
spoke 
directly 
with 
President 
Zelensky. He spoke directly with Presi-
dent Zelensky to prepare him for a call 
with President Trump. Ambassador 
Sondland coached President Zelensky 
to use key phrases and reassure Presi-
dent Trump of Ukraine’s intention to 
bend to President Trump’s will with re-
spect to the phony investigations that 
President Trump sought. 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
told 
Kurt 
Volker that he gave the Ukrainian 
leader ‘‘a full briefing. He’s got it.’’ 
That is what Sondland told Volker. 
In response, Volker texted: ‘‘Most 
important is for Zelensky to say that 
he will help with the investigation.’’ 
That 
same 
day, 
Ambassador 
Sondland emailed top administration 
officials, including Acting Chief of 
Staff Mulvaney, Secretary Pompeo, 
and Secretary Perry, to summarize his 
conversation with Zelensky. In that 
email, 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
said 
Zelensky 
is 
‘‘prepared 
to 
receive 
POTUS’ call. Will assure him’’—mean-
ing POTUS—‘‘that he intends to run a 
fully transparent investigation and 
will ‘turn over every stone.’ ’’ 
Both Acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney 
and Secretary Perry responded to the 
email, noting that the head-of-state 
call would be scheduled. 
Secretary Perry wrote: ‘‘Mick just 
confirmed the call being set up for to-
morrow by NSC’’—the National Secu-
rity Council. 
Mulvaney responded: ‘‘I asked NSC to 
set it up for tomorrow.’’ 
Neither 
Mulvaney 
nor 
Secretary 
Perry took issue with the fact that 
Sondland coached Zelensky to yield to 
President Trump’s pressure campaign, 
but instead they took steps to connect 
the two leaders. Everyone was in the 
loop. 
They were aware that during the 
July 20 call, President Trump intended 
to solicit foreign interference in the 
2020 election and pressed the Ukrainian 
leader to announce investigations into 
former Vice President Biden and the 
CrowdStrike conspiracy theory. There 
was no focus on advancing America’s 
foreign policy or national security ob-
jectives. The only priority was Presi-
dent 
Trump’s 
corrupt 
demand 
for 
phony investigations in exchange for 
an Oval Office meeting—this for that. 
Here is Ambassador Sondland’s testi-
mony confirming this scheme. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Everyone was in 
the loop. It was no secret. Everyone was in-
formed via email on July 19th, days before 
the Presidential call. As I communicated to 
the team, I told President Zelensky in ad-
vance that assurances to run a fully trans-
parent investigation and turn over every 
stone were necessary in his call with Presi-
dent Trump. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. ‘‘Necessary 
in his call with President Trump.’’ 
Now, we come to July 25, the morn-
ing of the infamous phone call—the 
culmination of a monthslong campaign 
to engineer a corrupt quid pro quo. 
That morning, before the call took 
place, President Trump provided guid-
ance to Sondland. On the morning of 
July 25, he told him that President 
Zelensky should be prepared to an-
nounce the investigations in exchange 
for the White House meeting. After 
Sondland’s call with President Trump 
on the morning of July 25, Sondland 
urgently tried to reach Kurt Volker. 
When he could not reach Ambassador 
Volker by phone, he sent a text that 
said, ‘‘Call ASAP,’’ and he left a mes-
sage. 
Volker testified that he indeed re-
ceived that message, which involved 
the 
following 
content: 
‘‘President 
Zelensky should be clear, convincing, 
forthright, 
with 
President 
Trump 
about his commitment to fighting cor-
ruption, investigating what happened 
in the past.’’ That refers to the Rus-
sian-inspired fake, phony, and false 
conspiracy theory about Ukraine hav-
ing been involved in interfering in our 
2016 elections. 
He continues: ‘‘And if he does that, 
President Trump was prepared to be re-
assured, that he would say yes, come 
on, let’s get this date for this visit 
scheduled.’’ 
Ambassador Volker then conveyed 
that message approximately 30 minutes 
before the Trump-Zelensky call to 
Zelensky’s top aide, Andrey Yermak. 
As you can see on the slide, Ambas-
sador Volker texts Yermak, Zelensky’s 
guy, and says, ‘‘assuming President Z 
convinces Trump he will investigate/ 
‘get to the bottom of what happened’ in 
2016,’’ the White House meeting would 
get scheduled—this for that. 
So President Trump talks to Ambas-
sador Sondland. Sondland talks to Am-
bassador Volker. Volker talks to Presi-
dent Zelensky’s aide Yermak, and then 
the July 25 call occurs. 
When Ambassador Sondland testified, 
he agreed with this sequence, indi-
cating it ‘‘certainly makes sense.’’ 
Here is what Sondland had to say. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. But the sequence certainly 
makes sense, right? 
Amb. SONDLAND. Yeah, it does. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. You talked to President 
Trump. 
Amb. SONDLAND. Yeah. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. You told Kurt Volker to 
call you. You left a message for Kurt Volker. 
Kurt Volker sent this text message to

Yermak 
to 
prepare 
President 
Zelensky, and then President Trump had a 
phone call where President Zelensky spoke 
very similar to what was in this text mes-
sage. Right? 
Amb. SONDLAND. Right. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And you would agree that 
the message in this, that is expressed here is 
that President Zelensky needs to convince 
Trump that he will do the investigations in 
order to nail down the date for a visit to 
Washington, DC. Is that correct? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. That’s correct. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Indeed, on 
the July 25 call when President Trump 
asked for a favor, President Zelensky 
was ready with the magic words. He 
said: 
I also wanted to thank you for your invita-
tion to visit the United States, specifically 
Washington DC. On the other hand, I want to 
ensure you that we will be very serious 
about the case and will work on the inves-
tigation. 
This for that. 
‘‘Read 
the 
transcript,’’ 
President 
Trump says. We have read the tran-
script, and it is damning evidence of a 
corrupt quid pro quo. 
The evidence against Donald Trump 
is hiding in plain sight. During our 
presentation, we walked through the 
serious issues presented in the plain 
reading of the July 25 call, but now you 
can see the entire content of how this 
corrupt parade of horribles unfolded. 
The quid pro quo was discussed in 
text 
messages, 
emails, 
voicemails, 
calls, and meetings amongst top ad-
ministration officials and top Ukrain-
ian officials. Indeed, President Trump’s 
message was delivered to either Presi-
dent Zelensky or his top aides on four 
different occasions in the month of 
July—four different occasions: on July 
2, in Toronto; on July 10, at the White 
House; on July 19, during a call be-
tween 
Zelensky 
and 
Ambassador 
Sondland; and then on July 25, before 
the call with the two leaders. 
Before that fateful call on July 25, 
President Zelensky understood exactly 
what needed to be done—a quid pro 
quo. 
The evidence of President Trump’s 
grave misconduct does not end with 
that July 25 call. From that point on-
ward, President Zelensky was on notice 
that it was President Trump himself 
who demanded those two phony polit-
ical investigations. 
After the July 25 call, the Ukrainians 
followed up with President Trump’s di-
rection and began to coordinate with 
Rudolph Giuliani, the President’s polit-
ical bagman. Acting on the President’s 
orders, U.S. diplomats, including Am-
bassador Sondland and Ambassador 
Volker, worked with Mr. Giuliani to 
continue pressuring Ukraine to an-
nounce the phony investigations that 
President Trump sought in exchange 
for that Oval Office meeting. This is 
corruption and abuse of power in its 
purest form. 
Over the next 2 weeks, Mr. Giuliani 
directed Ambassadors Sondland and 
Volker to negotiate a public statement 
for President Zelensky announcing the 
investigations that President Trump 
corruptly demanded. Here is how Am-
bassador Sondland described this Au-
gust timeframe. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Mr. Giuliani con-
veyed 
to 
Secretary 
Perry, 
Ambassador 
Volker and others that President Trump 
wanted a public statement from President 
Zelensky committing to investigations of 
Burisma and the 2016 election. Mr. Giuliani 
expressed those requests directly to the 
Ukrainians and Mr. Giuliani also expressed 
those requests directly to us. We all under-
stood that these prerequisites for the White 
House call and the White House meeting re-
flected President Trump’s desires and re-
quirements. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Deputy As-
sistant Secretary of State George Kent 
described the pursuit of President 
Trump’s corrupt demands as ‘‘infecting 
U.S. engagement with Ukraine.’’ Here 
is his full testimony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. KENT. In mid-August it became clear 
to me that Giuliani’s efforts to gin up politi-
cally-motivated investigations were now in-
fecting 
U.S. 
engagement 
with 
Ukraine, 
leveraging President Zelensky’s desire for a 
White House meeting. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. In short, 
U.S. diplomats responsible for Ukraine 
policy understood that Giuliani had de 
facto control over whether the Oval Of-
fice meeting would be scheduled and 
under 
what 
circumstances. 
Mr. 
Giuliani had been given that level of 
authority by President Trump, and it 
was infecting official U.S. policy to-
ward Ukraine. 
To shake loose the White House 
meeting, top Ukrainian officials knew 
that they had to meet with Mr. 
Giuliani, who John Bolton described as 
a human hand grenade who was going 
to blow everybody up. So, on August 2, 
Mr. Giuliani met with Mr. Yermak, 
President Zelensky’s top aide, in Ma-
drid—Giuliani, in Madrid, meeting with 
Zelensky’s top aide on August 2. Mr. 
Giuliani made clear in that meeting 
that President Trump needed more pri-
vate assurances that Ukraine would 
pursue the investigations. Mr. Giuliani 
made clear that President Trump need-
ed a public statement. 
According to Ambassador Sondland— 
and this is very important—President 
Trump did not require that Ukraine ac-
tually conduct the investigations in 
order to secure that White House meet-
ing. The Ukrainian Government only 
needed to announce the investigations 
because they were phony and they were 
simply designed to cheat in the 2020 
election, solicit foreign interference, 
and corrupt our democracy—to the 
benefit of President Trump. So the goal 
was not the investigations themselves 
but the corrupt political benefit Presi-
dent Trump would receive as a result of 
these announcements. He also wanted 
to shake ‘‘this Russia thing’’ and in-
stead blame Ukraine with the fairytale 
that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 
election. The facts didn’t matter for 
President Trump; he only cared about 
the personal political benefit of these 
sought-after investigative announce-
ments. 
Over the next few weeks, Ambas-
sadors Sondland and Volker worked 
with Mr. Yermak to draft a public 
statement for President Zelensky to 
issue. Ambassador Volker was also in 
frequent contact with Rudy Giuliani 
regarding the content of that state-
ment. 
Now, Rudy Giuliani, of course, is not 
a Secretary of State. He is not an Am-
bassador. He is not a member of the 
diplomatic corps. He was working in 
the 
political 
personal 
interests 
of 
President 
Trump, 
interacting 
with 
Ukrainian officials. 
On August 9, Ambassador Volker 
texted Mr. Giuliani and requested a 
call to update him on the progress of 
the negotiations for the statement and 
discuss the content of what it should 
include. Volker said that Yermak had 
‘‘mentioned Z’’—President Zelensky— 
‘‘making a statement.’’ He suggested 
that he and Mr. Giuliani ‘‘get on the 
phone to make sure I advise Zelensky 
correctly as to what he should be say-
ing.’’ 
Later that afternoon, Ambassador 
Sondland 
suggested 
to 
Ambassador 
Volker that they obtain a draft state-
ment from the Ukrainian Government 
‘‘to avoid misunderstandings’’ or, in 
other words, make sure that President 
Trump’s political objectives were met. 
Ambassador Sondland also reiterated 
that President Trump would not be 
satisfied by a vague statement. The 
Ukrainian leader needed to commit to 
the phony investigations in explicit 
terms in order to secure the sought- 
after Oval Office meeting—this for 
that. 
Call records subpoenaed by the House 
show 
multiple 
communications 
be-
tween Ambassador Sondland and Mr. 
Giuliani on the one hand and numbers 
associated with the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget and the White House 
on the other. 
On August 8, around the time of di-
rect 
communications 
between 
Mr. 
Giuliani and Mr. Yermak, Mr. Giuliani 
communicated 
repeatedly 
with 
the 
White House, sending or receiving six 
text messages and completing several 
calls. 
Most notably, late in the evening on 
August 8, Mr. Giuliani called the White 
House in a highly distinctive pattern. 
At 8:53 p.m., Giuliani texted a White 
House number. 
At 10:09, a number identified only as 
‘‘-1’’ in the White House call records 
called Mr. Giuliani five times in rapid 
succession. 
Two minutes later, Mr. Giuliani at-
tempted to return the call, trying an 
Office of Management and Budget num-
ber, then the White House Situation 
Room, and then the White House 
switchboard. 
At 
10:28, 
16 
minutes 
after 
Mr. 
Giuliani tried to call the White House 
back, frantically—Situation Room, Of-
fice 
of 
Management

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S516 
January 23, 2020 
Giuliani tried to call the White House 
back, Giuliani and the -1 number con-
nected for 4 minutes 6 seconds. 
We should be clear. We do not know 
what Mr. Giuliani said or even whom 
he talked to. We do not know who was 
on the other end of that mysterious 
call with the -1. President Trump re-
fused to produce documents and or-
dered key witnesses not to testify, hid-
ing part of the truth from the Amer-
ican people. He obstructed our congres-
sional investigation. But we do know 
that 
Rudolph 
Giuliani 
frantically 
called the White House late into the 
night. We do know that he talked to 
someone at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, 
and we know that Mr. Giuliani likely 
talked about the drug deal that John 
Bolton characterized. 
Over the next few days, President 
Zelensky’s 
aide, 
Mr. 
Yermak, 
ex-
changed drafts of the public statement 
with 
Ambassadors 
Volker 
and 
Sondland, who consulted on these 
drafts with Mr. Giuliani. The Ukrain-
ian officials appeared to finally relent. 
They agreed to Mr. Giuliani’s specific 
language about the phony political in-
vestigations in exchange for the Oval 
Office meeting. 
On August 10, Yermak texted Volker 
that the Ukrainians were willing to 
make the requested statements but 
only if they received a date for the 
White House meeting first. Mr. Yermak 
texted: ‘‘I think it’s possible to make 
this declaration and mention all these 
things.’’ Yermak, again, is Zelensky’s 
top guy. He later wrote that the state-
ment would come out ‘‘after we ‘re-
ceive a confirmation of date ’ for the 
White House visit. 
Ambassador Volker counterproposed: 
They would iron out the statement in 
private, use that to get the date for the 
meeting in the Oval Office, and then 
President Zelensky would make the 
public statement—this for that. 
Mr. Yermak countered: ‘‘Once we 
have a date, will call for a press brief-
ing, announcing upcoming visit and 
outlining vision for the reboot of the 
US-UKRAINE relationship, including, 
among other things, Burisma and elec-
tion meddling in investigations.’’ That 
was the specific reference to President 
Trump’s corrupt demands. 
Two days later, Mr. Yermak sent the 
draft statement, but the statement did 
not reference Burisma or the 2016 elec-
tion. As soon as Mr. Yermak sent the 
statement, 
what 
did 
Ambassadors 
Sondland and Volker do? They sought 
a call with Rudolph Giuliani to see if 
the statement would suffice. They 
needed to check in with Mr. Giuliani, 
who was leading the charge to lock 
down the corrupt quid pro quo. 
Let’s listen to Ambassador Volker. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador VOLKER. This is the first 
draft of that from Mr. Yermak after the con-
versations that we had. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And it does not mention 
Burisma or the 2016 election interference, 
correct? 
Ambassador VOLKER. It does not. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And you testified in your 
deposition 
that 
you 
and 
Ambassador 
Sondland and Mayor Giuliani had a con-
versation about this draft after you received 
it. Is that right? 
Ambassador VOLKER. That is correct. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And Mr. Giuliani said that 
if the statement did not include Burisma and 
2016 election, it would not have any credi-
bility. Is that right? 
Ambassador VOLKER. That’s correct. 
Mr. 
Manager 
JEFFRIES. 
Mr. 
Giuliani, acting on behalf of President 
Trump, made clear that the statement 
from the Ukrainians had to target Vice 
President Biden—for reasons outlined 
earlier today—and it had to mention 
the conspiracy theory about Ukraine 
interfering in the 2016 election. 
After Mr. Giuliani conveyed this on 
the 
telephone 
call, 
Ambassadors 
Volker 
and 
Sondland 
texted 
Mr. 
Yermak and requested a call to convey 
that message. Ambassador Volker says: 
‘‘Hi Andrey—we spoke with Rudy. 
When is good to call you?’’ And Ambas-
sador Sondland makes clear the ur-
gency, texting: ‘‘Important. Do you 
have 5 minutes?’’ 
Now, Ambassador Volker made clear 
to Mr. Yermak that the statement 
needed the two key items Mr. Giuliani 
required for the President. 
Here is Ambassador Volker’s testi-
mony to that effect. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Amb. VOLKER. Hi, Andre. Good talking. 
Following is text with insert at the end for 
the two key items. We will work on official 
request. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And then you will see the 
highlighted portion of the next text. The 
other is identical to your previous one and 
then it just adds including the . . . Including 
Burisma and the 2016 elections. Is that right? 
Amb. VOLKER: That is correct. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And that was what Mr. 
Giuliani insisted on adding to the state-
ment? 
Amb. VOLKER. That’s what he said will be 
necessary for that to be credible. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And the Ukrainians ulti-
mately did not issue the statement. Is that 
right? 
Amb. VOLKER. That is correct. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And President Zelensky 
ultimately did not get the Oval Office meet-
ing either, did he? 
Amb. VOLKER. Not yet. 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. President 
Zelensky is still waiting for that Oval 
Office meeting. 
Ronald Reagan, in a speech that he 
delivered in 1987 at the foot of the Ber-
lin Wall, in the midst of the Cold War, 
said to the world: 
East and West do not mistrust each other 
because we are armed. We are armed because 
we mistrust each other. And our differences 
are not about weapons. It’s about liberty. 
The Trump-Ukraine scandal is cer-
tainly about weapons. It is about the 
unlawful withholding of $391 million in 
security aid. It is about a withheld, 
sought-after Oval Office meeting. It is 
about trying to cheat in the 2020 elec-
tion. It is about corrupting our democ-
racy. It is about undermining Amer-
ica’s national security. It is about a 
stunning abuse of power. It is about ob-
struction of Congress. It is about the 
need for us here in this great Chamber 
to have a fair trial with witnesses and 
evidence. It is about a corrupt quid pro 
quo. 
Perhaps, above all, it is about lib-
erty, because in America, for all of us, 
what keeps us free from tyranny is the 
sacred principle that in this great 
country no one is above the law. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Mr. 
Chief Justice, Senators, President’s 
counsel, we have reviewed the moun-
tain of evidence that proves the Presi-
dent’s official act in his scheme: the 
corrupt bargain of a White House meet-
ing in exchange for Ukraine announc-
ing sham political investigations. 
You heard from each relevant wit-
ness with firsthand knowledge of the 
President’s corrupt scheme—Sondland, 
Taylor, Volker, Hill, and Vindman— 
that there was a corrupt deal: an Oval 
Office meeting for investigations—quid 
pro quo, this for that. 
You also saw inescapable documen-
tary proof that clearly proves a corrupt 
quid pro quo. The evidence is con-
sistent, corroborated. It comes in many 
forms, from many individuals who are 
lifelong public servants with no moti-
vation to lie. In short, the evidence is 
overwhelming. 
Given how much we have gone 
through, let’s review some of those ca-
reer public servants’ testimony, who 
state clearly that they too believed it 
was a quid pro quo—a this for that—be-
cause it is really powerful to hear di-
rectly from them. 
Let’s watch Ambassador Taylor. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Amb. TAYLOR. By mid-July, it was be-
coming clear to me that the meeting Presi-
dent Zelensky wanted was conditioned on 
the investigations of Burisma, and alleged 
Ukrainian interference and the 2016 U.S. 
elections. It was also clear that this condi-
tion was driven by the irregular policy chan-
nel I had come to understand was guided by 
Mr. Giuliani. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. It 
was clear that these were conditions 
driven by irregular policies. We know 
this too because Ambassador Sondland 
said so at the July 10 meeting. Dr. 
Fiona Hill described the scene in Am-
bassador Bolton’s office, where the 
quid pro quo was made clear. 
Let’s watch. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Dr. HILL. Ukrainian Mr. Danylyuk starts 
to ask about a White House meeting, and 
Ambassador Bolton was trying to parry this 
back. Although he’s the National Security 
Advisor, he’s not in charge of scheduling the 
meeting. We have input recommending the 
meetings, and this goes through a whole 
process. It’s not Ambassador Bolton’s role to 
start pulling out the schedule and start say-
ing, ‘‘Right, well, we’re going to look and see 
if this Tuesday in this month is going to 
work with us.’’ And he does not as a matter 
of course like to discuss the details of these 
meetings, he likes to leave them to, you 
know, the appropriate staff for this. So, this 
was already going to be an uncomfortable 
issue. 
As Ambassador Bolton was trying to move 
that part of the discussion away, I think he 
was going to try to deflect it onto another 
wrap-up topic, Ambassador Sondland leaned 
in basically to say, ‘‘Well, we have an agree-
ment that there will be a meeting, and the

specific investigations are put underway.’’ 
And that’s when I saw Ambassador Bolton 
stiffen. I was sitting behind him in the chair, 
and I saw him sit back slightly like this. 
He’d been more moving forward, like I am, to 
the table. And, for me, that was an unmis-
takable body language, and it caught my at-
tention. And then he looked up to the clock 
and, you know, at his watch, or at his wrist 
in any case. Again, I am sitting behind him 
. . . and basically said, ‘‘Well, you know, it’s 
been really great to see you. I’m afraid I’ve 
got another—another meeting.’’ 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. ‘‘Am-
bassador Bolton stiffened’’—quite a de-
scription. 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman’s 
testimony 
is 
consistent 
with Dr. Hill’s recollection of the July 
10 meeting, and that it was made clear 
that the deal for the White House 
meeting was investigations. 
Let’s 
watch 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. I want to move now to 
that July 10th meeting that you referenced, 
Colonel Vindman. What exactly did Ambas-
sador Sondland say when the Ukrainian offi-
cials raised the idea of a White House meet-
ing? 
Lt. Col. VINDMAN. As I recall, he referred 
to specific investigations that the Ukrain-
ians would have to deliver in order to get 
these meetings. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Lieu-
tenant 
Colonel 
Vindman, 
firsthand 
knowledge—they would have to deliver 
in order to get these meetings. 
It was also clear that this wasn’t 
about general investigations about cor-
ruption. This wasn’t about corruption 
at all. Ambassador Sondland directed 
everyone—including the Ukrainian of-
ficials—to 
reconvene 
in 
the 
Ward 
Room, where he discussed the arrange-
ment 
he 
had 
reached 
with 
Mr. 
Mulvaney in more detail. He made 
clear that it was about specific inves-
tigations that would benefit President 
Trump personally. 
Here is Lieutenant Colonel Vindman 
testifying, where he explains that Am-
bassador Sondland referred to the 
Bidens, Burisma, and the 2016 election, 
which had nothing to do with national 
security policy. 
Let’s watch. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Were the investigations, 
the specific investigations that Ambassador 
Sondland referenced in the larger meeting, 
also discussed in the Ward Room meeting? 
Lt. Col. VINDMAN. They were. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And what did Ambassador 
Sondland say? 
Lt. Col. VINDMAN. Ambassador Sondland 
referred to investigations into the Bidens, 
Burisma, and 2016. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. How did you respond, if at 
all? 
Lt. Col. VINDMAN. I said that this request 
to conduct these meetings was inappro-
priate—these investigations was inappro-
priate and had nothing to do with national 
security policy. 
Ms. 
Manager 
GARCIA 
of 
Texas. 
‘‘Nothing to do with national security 
policy’’—that about some sums it up. 
Doesn’t it? It has nothing to do with 
national 
security 
policy. 
President 
Trump’s scheme was for his personal 
interest, not national security. And his 
testimony, once again, is corroborated. 
Dr. Hill joined the Ward Room con-
versation later and also recalled the 
discussion of investigations and a 
White House meeting, and that Lieu-
tenant Colonel Vindman said: ‘‘This is 
inappropriate. We’re the National Se-
curity Council; we can’t be involved in 
this.’’ 
Here is her testimony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Dr. HILL. And so when I came in, Gordon 
Sondland was basically saying, well, look, we 
have a deal here that there will be a meet-
ing. I have a deal here with Chief of Staff 
Mulvaney. There will be a meeting if the 
Ukrainians open up or announce these inves-
tigations into 2016 in Burisma. 
And I cut it off immediately there. Because 
by this point, having heard Mr. Giuliani over 
and over again on the television and all of 
the issues that he was asserting, by this 
point it was clear that Burisma was code for 
the Bidens, because Giuliani was laying it 
out there. I could see why Colonel Vindman 
was alarmed. And he said: ‘‘This is inappro-
priate. We’re the National Security Council; 
we can’t be involved in this.’’ 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. And 
what’s more, as Ambassador Sondland 
told us, everyone was in the loop— 
meaning, it became clear that Presi-
dent Trump was directing this. 
Dr. Hill, who at one point confronted 
Gordon Sondland over this arrange-
ment, further reached the conclusion 
that he was acting on the President’s 
orders and coordinating with other sen-
ior officials. He had made this clear: he 
was briefing the President on all this. 
Here is Dr. Hill’s testimony. Let’s 
watch. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Dr. HILL. So, I was upset with him that he 
wasn’t fully telling us about all of the meet-
ings that he was having. And he said to me: 
‘‘But I’m briefing the president. I’m briefing 
Chief of Staff Mulvaney. I’m briefing Sec-
retary Pompeo and I’ve talked to Ambas-
sador Bolton. Who else do I have to deal 
with?’’ 
And the point is we have a robust inter-
agency process that deals with Ukraine. It 
includes Mr. Holmes, it includes Ambassador 
Taylor as, the Charge in Ukraine, it includes 
a whole load of other people. But it struck 
me when yesterday, when you put up on the 
screen Ambassador Sondland’s emails and 
who was on these emails and he said, these 
[are] the people who need to know, that he 
was absolutely right. Because he was being 
involved in a domestic political errand, and 
we were being involved in national security 
foreign policy. And those two things had just 
divulged. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. The 
evidence is very clear: The White 
House meeting would only be scheduled 
if Ukraine announced the investiga-
tions that everyone, including the 
Ukrainians, understood to be purely 
political efforts to benefit the Presi-
dent. The only way to come to a dif-
ferent conclusion is to ignore the evi-
dence. 
One additional way you can tell that 
this conduct is truly corrupt, and not 
U.S. foreign policy as usual, is that 
these officials—these lifetime, career 
public 
servants—didn’t 
just 
testify 
about 
this 
in 
impeachment 
pro-
ceedings. They contemporaneously re-
ported this conduct in realtime. 
Their reactions illustrate that this 
was not the kind of thing that both 
parties do when they have the White 
House. This was something different, 
something corrupt, something ‘‘insid-
ious,’’ to use Ambassador Sondland’s 
characterization in later testimony. 
The officials who instinctively re-
coiled from the corrupt deal that 
Sondland blurted out were distin-
guished patriotic public servants. 
Let’s go through some specific exam-
ples of that evidence. 
After the July 10 meeting we just 
talked 
about, 
where 
Ambassador 
Sondland made clear the agreement 
that the White House meetings were 
conditioned on the investigations, Dr. 
Hill consulted with Ambassador Bolton 
and told him what she had heard. Am-
bassador Bolton gave her, as she put it, 
a ‘‘very specific instruction’’ to report 
this conduct in realtime, and she did. 
Here is her testimony. Let’s watch. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Dr. HILL. The specific instruction was 
that I had to go to the lawyers, to John 
Eisenberg, our senior counsel for the Na-
tional Security Council, to basically say, 
you tell Eisenberg, Ambassador Bolton told 
me, that I am not part of this whatever drug 
deal that Mulvaney and Sondland are cook-
ing up. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. What did you understand 
him to mean by the drug deal Mulvaney and 
Sondland were cooking up? 
Dr. HILL. I took it to mean investigations 
for a meeting. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. Did you go speak to the 
lawyers? 
Dr. HILL. I certainly did. 
Ms. 
Manager 
GARCIA 
of 
Texas. 
Again, investigations for a meeting, 
the quid pro quo. 
Consistent with Dr. Hill’s recounting, 
after both the July 10 meeting and the 
July 
25 
call, 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman reported what he had learned 
through the lawyers. 
Here he is discussing that later inter-
action. Let’s see it. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. MALONEY. And you went imme-
diately, and you reported it, didn’t you? 
Col. VINDMAN. I did. 
Mr. MALONEY. Why? 
Col. VINDMAN. Because that was my duty. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. When 
Vindman said he reported this conduct, 
again, ‘‘because that was my duty,’’ he 
acted as he did out of a sense of duty 
and as a Purple Heart veteran, with 
confidence that in America he would be 
protected for doing the right thing 
even if it angered the President of the 
United States. 
His father, who fled the Soviet Union 
to come to this country, worried about 
his son fulfilling that duty. 
Here was Colonel Vindman’s message 
to his father. Let’s listen. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Lt. Col. VINDMAN. Dad, my sitting here 
today in the U.S. Capitol talking to our 
elected officials is proof that you made the 
right decision 40 years ago to leave the So-
viet Union to come here to the United States

of America in search of a better life for our 
family. Do not worry. I’ll be fine for telling 
the truth. 
Mr. MALONEY. You realize when you 
came forward out of a sense of duty that you 
were putting yourself in direct opposition to 
the most powerful person in the world? Do 
you realize that, sir? 
Lt. Col. VINDMAN. I knew I was assuming 
a lot of risk. 
Mr. MALONEY. And I’m struck by the 
word . . . that phrase, ‘‘do not worry,’’ you 
addressed to your dad. Was your dad a war-
rior? 
Lt. Col. VINDMAN. He did serve. It was a 
different military though. 
Mr. MALONEY. And he would’ve worried if 
you were putting yourself up against the 
President of the United States, is that right? 
Lt. Col. VINDMAN. He deeply worried 
about it because in his context it was the ul-
timate risk. 
Mr. MALONEY. And why do you have con-
fidence that you can do that and tell your 
dad not to worry? 
Lt. Col. VINDMAN. Congressman, because 
this is America. This is the country I’ve 
served and defended, that all of my brothers 
have served, and here right matters. 
Mr. MALONEY. Thank you, sir. I yield 
back. [applause]. 
Ms. 
Manager 
GARCIA 
of 
Texas. 
Imagine. He had to tell his father: Do 
not worry; I will be fine for telling the 
truth. It was his duty because, in 
America, right matters. 
President Trump has suggested that 
all of the witnesses are Never Trump-
ers. That couldn’t be further from the 
truth. As we just saw, these U.S. offi-
cials are brave public servants. It is 
wrong—just 
flat 
wrong—to 
suggest 
they were doing anything other than 
testifying out of a sense of duty, as 
Lieutenant Colonel Vindman testified. 
But it wasn’t just U.S. officials 
whose reactions show us that this was 
wrong; it is also clear how corrupt this 
scheme was because Ukraine resisted 
it. President Zelensky was elected as a 
reformer. His first few months in office 
lived up to this promise. 
Here is Ambassador Taylor testifying 
on this point. Let’s see it. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. But once I arrived 
in Kyiv, I discovered a weird combination of 
encouraging, 
confusing, 
and 
ultimately 
alarming circumstances. 
First, the encouraging. President Zelensky 
was reforming Ukraine in a hurry. He ap-
pointed reformist ministers and supported 
long-stalled anti-corruption legislation. He 
took quick executive action, including open-
ing Ukraine’s High Anti-Corruption Court. 
With a new parliamentary majority stem-
ming 
from 
snap 
elections, 
President 
Zelensky changed the Ukraine Constitution 
to remove absolute immunity from Rada 
deputies, the source of raw corruption for 
two decades. The excitement in Kyiv was 
palpable. This time could be different, a new 
Ukraine finally breaking from its corrupt, 
post-Soviet past. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. So 
we know that President Zelensky was a 
reformer, fighting corruption, fighting 
for reform, and he got started early, as 
soon as he was sworn in. We know that 
President Zelensky’s agenda was in our 
U.S. national interest. In fact, every 
witness 
testified 
that 
President 
Zelensky deserved America’s support 
and that they told President Trump 
that. 
So keeping that in mind, it is ex-
tremely 
telling 
what 
President 
Zelensky and his aides were saying be-
hind closed doors. They were concerned 
about being dragged into President 
Trump’s scheme. They recognized the 
political peril of going along with the 
President’s corrupt scheme. We know 
that was the case for many reasons, 
but let’s look at some of the evidence 
showing that now. 
First, the Ukrainians made their con-
cerns clear directly to U.S. officials. 
On July 20, just days ahead of the July 
25 call, Ambassador Taylor spoke with 
President Zelensky’s national security 
advisor. He then conveyed to Ambas-
sadors Sondland and Volker that the 
Ukrainian leader ‘‘did not want to be 
used as a pawn in a U.S. reelection 
campaign.’’ 
Here is Ambassador Taylor explain-
ing what he understood that to mean. 
Let’s watch. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. GOLDMAN. What did you understand 
it to mean when—that Zelensky had con-
cerns about being an instrument in Wash-
ington domestic reelection politics? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Danyliuk un-
derstood that these investigations were pur-
suant to Mr. Giuliani’s request to develop in-
formation, 
to 
find 
information 
about 
Burisma and the Bidens. This was very well 
known in public. Mr. Giuliani made this 
point clear in several instances in the begin-
ning—in the springtime. And Mr. Danyliuk 
was aware that that was a problem. 
Mr. GOLDMAN. And would you agree that, 
because President Zelensky is worried about 
this, they understood, at least, that there 
was some pressure for them to pursue these 
investigations? Is that fair? 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Danyliuk indi-
cated that President Zelensky certainly un-
derstood it, that he did not want to get in-
volved in these type of activities. 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. As 
the slide shows, on July 21, Ambas-
sador Taylor relayed the same message 
to Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, 
making clear that ‘‘President Zelensky 
is sensitive about Ukraine being taken 
seriously, not merely as an instrument 
in Washington domestic politics.’’ 
But Ambassador Sondland did not 
back 
down. 
Instead, 
Ambassador 
Sondland reinforced the importance 
that 
President 
Zelensky 
reassure 
President Trump of his commitment to 
investigations. He said: ‘‘Absolutely, 
but we need to get the conversation 
started and the relationship built, irre-
spective of the pretext. I am worried 
about the alternative.’’ The ‘‘pretext’’ 
that Ambassador Sondland referred to 
was President Trump’s requirement 
that Ukraine announce investigations 
that would benefit him personally and 
politically. He wanted help in cheating. 
It wasn’t just Ambassador Taylor. 
Deputy Assistant Secretary George 
Kent, too, testified that Ukraine was 
‘‘very uncomfortable’’ when the issue 
of investigations was raised during the 
negotiations of the statement in Au-
gust of 2019. 
As the slide shows, Mr. Kent said: 
I had a conversation with Charge´ Taylor in 
which he . . . indicated that Special Rep-
resentative Volker had been engaging Andriy 
Yermak; that the President and his private 
attorney Rudy Giuliani were interested in 
the initiation of investigations and that 
Yermak was very uncomfortable when this 
was raised with him, and suggested that if 
that were the case, if that were really the 
position of the United States, it should be 
done officially and put in writing . . . And I 
told Bill Taylor, that’s wrong, and we 
shouldn’t be doing that as a matter of U.S. 
policy. 
When asked, ‘‘What did he say?’’ Mr. 
Kent said, ‘‘He said he agreed with 
me.’’ 
What is also important to note here 
is why. Ukraine made this clear. If the 
United States was asking them for in-
vestigations, especially investigations 
that made them uncomfortable, they 
should be done ‘‘officially’’ and ‘‘put in 
writing.’’ 
Mr. Kent’s testimony shows that. He 
said: 
Yermak was very uncomfortable when this 
was raised with him, and suggested that if 
that were the case, if that were really the 
position of the United States, it should be 
done officially and put in writing. 
And this wasn’t the only time. On 
August 13, Mr. Yermak asked Ambas-
sador Volker ‘‘whether any requests 
had ever been made by the U.S. to in-
vestigate election interference in 2016.’’ 
Now, this makes sense. Normally, if 
something is actually about official 
U.S. policy, the President would go 
through official U.S. channels, but, as 
we have seen here, he didn’t. His per-
sonal attorney made this—this wasn’t 
about foreign policy; it was something 
that would benefit President Trump 
personally. 
The administration officials made 
this clear too. There was undisputed 
testimony that the investigations were 
not part of U.S. policy. In fact, they di-
verged with the U.S. national security 
and our Nation’s values. The Depart-
ment of Justice has made this crystal 
clear in public statements. There has 
never been an official asked officially 
to do any of these investigations. And 
that is how we know this is so very 
wrong. 
Even Ukraine, a struggling, new 
country, knew this was wrong, and 
they stood up to President Trump and 
said no. Yermak—remember, he was 
Zelensky’s chief aide—was basically 
saying: You want an investigation? 
Please send us a formal request from 
DOJ. Show us you are willing to stand 
behind the legitimacy of what you are 
asking. But Ambassador Volker was 
unable to provide that information. 
And that is why—even though the 
White House meeting was so critical to 
Ukraine, even though Ukraine needed 
it so desperately—they still wouldn’t 
make the statement with key addi-
tions: President Trump’s political in-
vestigations, which were solely to help 
his reelection and had nothing to do 
with foreign policy. 
President Zelensky tried in different 
ways to resist the pressure of becoming

a ‘‘pawn’’ in U.S. politics. Even though 
the Oval Office meeting was important, 
Zelensky repeatedly tried to find a way 
around committing to the investiga-
tions 
that 
President 
Trump 
de-
manded—or at the very least, schedule 
it before taking any official action. 
This is what you saw in the negotiation 
over the statement in August, and this 
is why even President Trump’s second 
official act—withholding the White 
House meeting—was not enough to 
make Ukraine do his dirty work. 
Senators, we are coming to the end of 
a section of the presentation regarding 
the withholding of the White House 
meeting. So I want to just quickly re-
mind us one last time about the cen-
tral points that we have covered. 
President Trump exercised his offi-
cial power when he withheld an Oval 
Office meeting that was critical to 
Ukraine, and he did this for only one 
reason and one reason only: President 
Trump conditioned that Oval Office 
meeting on Ukraine’s announcing in-
vestigations that would help him po-
litically. This had nothing to do with 
official U.S. policy. President Trump 
directed U.S. officials who were sup-
posed to work for the American people 
to work, instead, with his personal 
agent, Rudy Giuliani, and focus only 
on his personal political interests. 
Acting on behalf of the President and 
with the President’s full knowledge, 
Mr. Giuliani worked with those U.S. of-
ficials to carry out the President’s 
scheme. They pressured the Ukrainian 
Government to act as a personal oppo-
sition 
research 
firm 
for 
President 
Trump. They tried to use a foreign gov-
ernment to dig up dirt on his client’s 
rival, former Vice President Biden, an 
American 
citizen—all 
so 
President 
Trump could win his election. They 
made clear that Ukraine would not get 
the official U.S. Government support it 
so desperately needed—support that 
the President’s national security team 
conveyed was necessary to advance our 
own national security objectives—un-
less President Zelensky announced the 
sham investigations. 
Remember that an abuse of power oc-
curs when a President corruptly exer-
cises official power to obtain a per-
sonal benefit in a way that ignores or 
injures the national interest. 
Senators, that is exactly what hap-
pened here. By withholding a White 
House meeting, President Trump used 
official power to corruptly pressure 
Ukraine. Indeed, the entire quid pro 
quo—the ‘‘this for that’’—the entire 
campaign to use the Oval Office meet-
ing as some kind of asset for the Presi-
dent’s reelection campaign—was cor-
rupt. U.S. officials knew this. Ukrain-
ians knew this too. I think, deep down, 
we all know it, and I think the Amer-
ican people know it. 
Senators, I ask you this one question: 
Is that not an abuse of power? Was it 
OK? If it is not an abuse of power, then 
what is? Is it OK to withhold official 
acts from a foreign country until that 
foreign country assists in your reelec-
tion effort? 
If any other public official did that, 
he or she would be held accountable. I 
know, if one of us did that, we would be 
held accountable. The only way to hold 
this President accountable is right 
here in this trial. Otherwise, you would 
be telling Ukraine and the world that 
it is OK for the President to use our 
Oval Office and this country’s prestige 
and power for himself instead of for the 
American people. 
If we allow this gross abuse of power 
to continue, this President will have 
free rein to abuse his control of U.S. 
foreign policy for personal interests 
and so would any other future Presi-
dent. Then this President and all Presi-
dents become above the law. A Presi-
dent could take the powers of the 
greatest office in this land and use 
those powers not for the country, not 
for the American people but for him or 
herself. 
I ask you to make sure this does not 
happen because, in this country, no 
one—no one—is above the law. 
(The above statement is spoken in 
Spanish.) 
I now yield to Mrs. DEMINGS. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
RECESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
the House managers have requested a 
5-minute break. 
There being no objection, the Senate, 
at 8:19 p.m., recessed until 8:38 p.m. and 
reassembled when called to order by 
the CHIEF JUSTICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
if I may, one brief announcement: In 
the 
morning, 
there 
will 
be 
a 
coronavirus briefing for all Members at 
10:30. Senator ALEXANDER and Senator 
MURRAY are involved in that. The loca-
tion will be emailed to your office. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Chief Jus-
tice Roberts, Senators, and counsel for 
the President, we have now been 
through the first two official acts by 
the President. But neither of those offi-
cial acts got the President what he 
wanted—help in his reelection cam-
paign. So he turned to another official 
act to turn up the pressure even more— 
withholding nearly $400 million of vital 
military assistance to Ukraine in ex-
change for the investigations. 
Withholding military assistance to 
Ukraine made the original abuse of 
power, soliciting foreign interference 
in our elections, that much worse. But 
it was also in and of itself an abuse of 
power. And not only that, it violated 
the law. It was illegal. 
The Government Accountability Of-
fice, a nonpartisan, independent agen-
cy, concluded that President Trump’s 
hold on the security assistance clearly 
violated the Empowerment Control 
Act, a law that Congress enacted to 
curb President Nixon’s own abuse of 
power. 
President Trump may not like it, but 
once a law is passed, the President can-
not change that law without coming 
back to us, the Congress. 
And President Trump did not just 
break the law, he jeopardized our na-
tional security, because Ukraine’s na-
tional security is our national secu-
rity. How? Because a free and demo-
cratic Ukraine is a shield against Rus-
sian aggression in Europe. That has 
been one of America’s most important 
foreign policy and national security 
goals since World War II. Freedom, lib-
erty, democracy—those values keep us 
safe. 
Let us now explain how President 
Trump’s improper withholding of mili-
tary assistance was clearly done to 
pressure Ukraine to announce the two 
baseless investigations—a gross abuse 
of power. 
First, we will briefly describe how 
important the military aid was to 
Ukraine’s defense against Russian ag-
gression, which affects our security. 
Second, we will explain how Presi-
dent Trump used the power of his office 
to freeze military aid to Ukraine in a 
way meant to conceal it from Congress. 
And third, we will present the over-
whelming 
evidence 
that 
President 
Trump ordered the hold for a corrupt 
purpose: to pressure Ukraine to an-
nounce two investigations that would 
personally benefit his own reelection 
effort. 
Let us start with the importance of 
the aid to our—the United States’—na-
tional security. The United States has 
supported Ukraine since it secured 
independence from the Soviet Union in 
1991. Our support was critical to con-
vince Ukraine to forgo its pursuit of a 
nuclear arsenal in 1994. We promised 
them that we would defend them if nec-
essary. But our support became truly 
vital in 2014, when Ukraine revolted 
against its Russian-friendly President, 
Viktor Yanukovych. Ukrainian citi-
zens rose up in protest, demanding 
democratic reforms and an end to cor-
ruption. The protests, rightly known as 
the Revolution of Dignity, removed the 
pro-Kremlin President. 
Russia responded by using its own 
military forces and proxies in Ukraine 
to invade Ukraine. This was the first 
effort to redraw European boundaries 
by military force since World War II. 
The war was devastating to Ukraine 
and remains so today. Approximately 7 
percent of Ukraine’s territory is now 
occupied by Russia. Approximately 
15,000 people have been killed as a re-
sult of the conflict, and over 1.4 million 
people have been displaced. 
In response to Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine, the United States and our al-
lies imposed sanctions on Russian indi-
viduals and entities and agreed to pro-
vide billions of dollars in assistance to 
support 
Ukrainian 
sovereignty 
and 
democratic development. 
We understood immediately, Demo-
crats 
and 
Republicans 
alike, 
that 
Ukraine’s safety and security was di-
rectly tied to our safety and security. 
With this all in mind, since 2014, the 
United States has delivered roughly 
$1.5 billion in security assistance and 
another $1.5 billion in other assistance

rope have provided approximately $18 
billion in loans and grants since 2014. 
As we have explained, the U.S. assist-
ance comes partially from the Depart-
ment of Defense, which provides impor-
tant military support. It comes par-
tially from the State Department, 
which helps Ukraine purchase military 
services or equipment manufactured by 
American companies in the United 
States. 
Ambassador Taylor explained how se-
curity assistance counters Russian ag-
gression and can help shorten the war 
in the east. Here is his testimony: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, the 
security assistance that we provide takes 
many forms. One of the components of that 
assistance is counter-battery radar. Another 
component are sniper weapons. 
These weapons and this assistance allows 
the Ukrainian military to deter further in-
cursions by the Russians against Ukrainian 
territory. If that further incursion, further 
aggression, were to take place, more Ukrain-
ians would die. So it is a deterrent effect 
that these weapons provide. 
It’s also the ability—it gives the Ukrain-
ians the ability to negotiate from a position 
of a little more strength when they nego-
tiate an end to the war in Donbas, negoti-
ating with the Russians. This also is a way 
that would reduce the numbers of Ukrain-
ians who would die. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Congress 
imposed certain conditions on the DOD 
assistance. Those conditions require 
DOD to hold half of the money in re-
serve. To release all of the funds, DOD, 
in coordination with the State Depart-
ment, must conduct a review and cer-
tify to Congress that Ukraine has done 
enough to fight corruption. 
President Trump may argue that the 
conditions imposed by Congress are 
similar to the hold he placed on aid to 
Ukraine. As Mick Mulvaney said, ‘‘[w]e 
do that all the time.’’ But let us be 
very clear: These types of conditions, 
which are often included in appropria-
tions bills, are designed to promote of-
ficial U.S. policy, not the policy of one 
individual or one President. This is ex-
actly the type of permissible condition 
on aid that Vice President Biden was 
implementing when he required that 
Ukraine fire its corrupt prosecutor 
general before getting a loan guar-
antee. 
Prior to 2019, the Trump administra-
tion provided security assistance to 
Ukraine without incident. Even under 
the previous Ukrainian administration 
of President Petro Poroshenko—which 
suffered 
from 
serious 
corruption— 
President Trump allowed $510 million 
in 2017 and $359 million in 2018 to flow 
unimpeded to Ukraine. 
But in the summer of 2019, without 
any 
explanation, 
President 
Trump 
abruptly withheld the security assist-
ance for Ukraine. 
So what had changed by July of 2019? 
Congress had appropriated the funds. 
President Trump had signed this into 
law. The Department of Defense had 
certified that Ukraine was meeting the 
required anti-corruption reforms. In 
fact, DOD had begun to spend the 
funds. So what happened? 
Well, in April, two critical things 
happened. First, Joe Biden publicly an-
nounced his campaign for President. 
Second, the Mueller investigation con-
cluded that Russia interfered in the 
2016 U.S. elections to assist the Trump 
campaign and that the Trump cam-
paign had extensive contacts with Rus-
sians and even took advantage of some 
of the Russian efforts. The evidence 
shows that the only reason—the only 
logical reason, and we deal in what is 
reasonable—President Trump withheld 
the aid was to undermine these threats 
to his political future. 
As we have discussed, security assist-
ance to Ukraine has broad bipartisan 
support from Congress, as well as every 
agency within the President’s own ad-
ministration. 
Let us be clear about something. The 
money 
mattered 
to 
Ukraine. 
It 
mattered to Ukraine. Witness testi-
mony revealed that this money was 10 
percent of Ukraine’s defense budget—10 
percent. 
Now imagine if President Trump just 
decided without cause or explanation 
to hold 10 percent of our own defense 
budget. That would have a dramatic 
impact on our military. It certainly did 
to Ukraine, our ally. 
Keep in mind, too, that President 
Trump had to sign the bill into law, 
which he did in September of 2018. At 
no time—at no time—through the con-
gressional debate or passage of the bill 
did the White House express any con-
cerns about the funding or the program 
itself. 
I want you to see the slide before us. 
It shows President Trump signs the bill 
authorizing aid to Ukraine for fiscal 
year 2019. 
On June 18, President Trump’s own 
Department of Defense certified that 
Ukraine had met all of the anti-corrup-
tion requirements necessary to receive 
aid. And do you know what? The De-
partment of Defense announced that 
the money was on its way, just as we, 
the United States of America, had 
promised. 
Senators, our word must continue to 
mean something. Our word must con-
tinue to mean something powerful in 
the world. So let us make certain that 
America continues to live up to its 
promise. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senators, thank you so 
much for the attention that you have 
given to our presentation throughout 
this day. It is a long day. You are here 
without your cell phones or any access 
to other information. It is not easy, 
but you are paying attention, and the 
country and the managers thank you 
for that. 
We have just gone through the im-
portance of security assistance to 
Ukraine to our national security and 
the clear consensus among Congress, 
the Executive, and the President’s 
agencies and advisers that the aid 
should be released to Ukraine. In fact, 
by June 18, after having certified that 
Ukraine had met all the anti-corrup-
tion reform requirements to receive 
the aid, DOD announced its intention 
to provide the $250 million in security 
assistance to Ukraine. 
This brings us to the second part of 
this section of our argument. 
Soon after that June 18 press release, 
President Trump quickly moved to 
stop the aid from flowing. He did this 
with no explanation, against the clear 
consensus of his advisers and his agen-
cies, and against our Nation’s security 
interests. He was so determined to do 
it in order to pressure Ukraine to do 
his political dirty work that he was 
willing to violate the law, something 
his own officials were well aware of and 
worried about. 
How do we know the President or-
dered the hold? First, there is no real 
dispute that the President ordered the 
hold. The hold on security assistance 
to Ukraine was a unilateral official act 
by the President. Immediately after 
the DOD’s June 18 press release an-
nouncing the $250 million in security 
assistance funds for Ukraine, President 
Trump started asking questions about 
the funding program. Laura Cooper 
from DOD and Mark Sandy from OMB 
testified about this sudden interest in 
Ukraine security assistance, something 
that Cooper called unusual. 
We, of course, have received no docu-
ments from OMB and DOD because of 
the President’s obstruction. Why did 
the President want to hide these docu-
ments? We don’t know, but thanks to 
Freedom of Information Act lawsuits 
and hard-working reporters, we know a 
little from the documents that we do 
have. 
For instance, we know that the day 
after the DOD press release, the Presi-
dent asked for information about the 
Ukraine aid. On June 19, Michael 
Duffey, the Associate Director for Na-
tional Security Programs at OMB, sent 
an email to Elaine McCusker, the DOD 
comptroller, with an article by the 
Washington Examiner reporting: ‘‘Pen-
tagon to send $250M in weapons to 
Ukraine.’’ 
In Duffey’s email, he asked McCusker 
the following question: 
The President has asked about this funding 
release, and I have been tasked to follow-up 
with someone over there to get more detail. 
Do you have insight on this funding? 
It seems that on June 19, Robert 
Blair, Mick Mulvaney’s deputy, called 
Acting OMB Director Russell Vought 
to discuss Ukraine’s security assist-
ance. He told him: ‘‘We need to hold it 
up.’’ 
That is right. The hold was actually 
directed impulsively without any pol-
icy or agency review as soon as Presi-
dent Trump learned about it from a 
press release. 
We know what was on the President’s 
mind about Ukraine that day because 
President Trump gave a phone inter-
view with Sean Hannity on FOX News. 
During the interview, he mentioned the 
so-called CrowdStrike conspiracy the-
ory that blames Ukraine rather than

Russia for interfering in the 2016 elec-
tion. 
Remember, 
President 
Trump 
raised the CrowdStrike theory a month 
later during his July 25 call with Presi-
dent Zelensky. Of course—and this has 
been said many times—that theory has 
been completely refuted by U.S. intel-
ligence agencies, as well as the Presi-
dent’s own handpicked senior advisers. 
The New York Times also reported 
that on June 27, Mick Mulvaney sent 
Blair an email. Mulvaney wrote: 
I am just trying to tie up some loose ends. 
Did we ever find out about the money to 
Ukraine and whether we can hold it back? 
What 
was 
Blair’s 
response 
to 
Mulvaney? That it was possible to hold 
security assistance, but he warned: 
‘‘Expect 
Congress 
to 
become 
un-
hinged.’’ 
Blair, who previously worked for 
Congress, knew that Congress would be 
‘‘unhinged’’ because there was over-
whelming 
bipartisan 
support 
for 
Ukraine. Congress had already author-
ized the release of the funds. DOD had 
already told Congress and the world 
that it was going to spend the $250 mil-
lion on Ukraine security assistance, 
and it had already started to do so. 
Mark Sandy, the senior career offi-
cial at OMB responsible for this type of 
aid, couldn’t recall any other time in 
his 12-year career at OMB when a hold 
was placed on security assistance after 
a congressional notification was made. 
Later, if the President’s counsel 
starts listing other times that aid has 
been held, ask yourself three questions. 
One, had Congress already cleared 
the money to be released; two, was 
there a significant geopolitical devel-
opment in that country; and three, did 
the GAO determine that the hold was 
illegal, in part, because Congress was 
not notified? 
Here, the money had been cleared. 
There was nothing new or important in 
Ukraine to disrupt the aid—just that a 
true 
anti-corruption 
reformer 
was 
elected. The hold was illegal. 
From freedom of information re-
leases and press reports, we know 
about just a few of the many docu-
ments being hidden from you about 
how the hold began. Given President 
Trump’s obstruction with the facts 
that have come to light through the 
Freedom of Information Act lawsuits 
and news reporting, you may assume 
the documents that are being withheld 
would probably incriminate the Presi-
dent; otherwise, why wouldn’t he have 
provided them? If he had a legitimate 
executive privilege claim, he could fol-
low the rules and make each claim. In-
stead, he just said no—no to every-
thing. 
By mid-July, the President had put a 
hold on all the money. Jennifer Wil-
liams, special adviser to Vice President 
PENCE for Europe, learned about the 
hold on July 3. She said it came ‘‘out of 
the blue’’ and hadn’t previously been 
discussed by OMB or the National Se-
curity Council. The hold was never dis-
cussed with any policy experts in any 
of the relevant agencies. 
That is remarkable. President Trump 
ordered a hold on congressionally ap-
propriated funds without the benefit of 
any interagency deliberation, consulta-
tion, or advice. The evidence shows the 
President’s hold was an impulsive deci-
sion unrelated to any American policy. 
On July 12, Robert Blair, Mulvaney’s 
deputy, emailed Duffey at OMB. He 
said ‘‘the President is directing a hold 
on 
military 
support 
funding 
for 
Ukraine.’’ This is according to Sandy, 
the career officer at OMB who got a 
copy of the email. 
Now, we don’t have a copy of the 
email because of the President’s ob-
struction, but here is what we do know 
from Mr. Sandy’s description of the 
email, as well as testimony from other 
witnesses. The hold was not part of a 
larger review of foreign aid. We do 
know it was not the result of a policy 
debate about what was best for Amer-
ica. It came ‘‘out of the blue.’’ We now 
know why it was done: to turn the 
screws on Ukraine to provide political 
help for the President. 
The hold was immediately suspect 
simply because of its timing. Duffey 
later asked Blair about the reason for 
the hold. Blair gave no explanation. In-
stead he said ‘‘we need to let the hold 
take place’’ and then ‘‘revisit’’ the 
issue with the President. Blair either 
didn’t know the reason or wouldn’t 
share the real reason because it was 
corrupt. It sure would be nice to know 
what Blair knew about the reason for 
the hold and what Duffey knew. We 
could ask them the question if you au-
thorize a subpoena. 
Now, we had hoped, as we said, that 
the Senate would authorize subpoenas 
before our arguments were made. We 
thought it would have been helpful. 
But we know that you will have an-
other opportunity to call witnesses, to 
require documents, and we hope that 
your decision will be informed by the 
arguments we are making to you over 
these days and that you will, in fact, 
get the full story. 
Well, we do know actually the reason 
why the President did what he did. We 
know the President held the money. It 
wasn’t because of any policy reason to 
benefit America or any concern about 
corruption in Ukraine or any desire for 
more burden-sharing from other coun-
tries. It was because the President was 
upset that Ukraine was not announcing 
the investigations that he wanted be-
cause he wanted to ramp up pressure to 
force them to do it. 
From the very beginning, it was clear 
the hold was not in America’s national 
interest. Those within the U.S. Govern-
ment responsible for Ukraine security 
and for shaping and implementing U.S. 
foreign policy were caught off guard by 
the President’s decision. Support for 
the aid and against the hold was unani-
mous, forceful, and unwavering. The 
President can call Ukraine policy ex-
perts ‘‘unelected bureaucrats’’ all he 
wants, but those are officers charged 
with implementing his official policy 
developed by the President himself, 
which was also a product of congres-
sional action. 
Anyway, it wasn’t just the career of-
ficers. President Trump’s own politi-
cally appointed senior officials—his 
Cabinet members—also opposed the 
hold. Why? Because it was against our 
national interest. 
But the President wasn’t persuaded 
by arguments about national interest. 
Why? Because the hold had nothing to 
do with the national interest. It had to 
do with the interest of just one person, 
Donald J. Trump. 
The demand for Ukraine to announce 
these investigations was not a policy 
decision but a personal decision by the 
President to benefit his own personal 
interest. At an NSC-led meeting on 
July 8, OMB announced that President 
Trump had directed a hold on Ukraine 
security assistance. The news shocked 
meeting participants. Ambassador Tay-
lor testified that he and others on the 
call ‘‘sat in astonishment’’ when they 
learned about the hold. He imme-
diately ‘‘realized that one of the key 
pillars 
of 
our 
strong 
support 
for 
Ukraine was threatened.’’ 
David Holmes, political counselor at 
the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, testified he 
was ‘‘shocked’’ and thought the hold 
was ‘‘extremely significant’’ because it 
undermined what he understood to be 
longstanding U.S. policy in Ukraine. 
Catherine Croft, the State Department 
special adviser for Ukraine, testified 
that the announcement ‘‘blew up the 
meeting.’’ 
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State 
George Kent said. ‘‘There was great 
confusion among the rest of us because 
we didn’t understand why that had 
happened.’’ He explained: Since there 
was unanimity about this security as-
sistance to Ukraine, it was in our na-
tional interest, it just surprised all of 
us. 
The policy consensus at this and 
later NSC meetings was clear. With the 
exception of OMB, which was following 
the direction of the President, every-
one supported lifting the hold. All the 
way up to the No. 2 officials at the 
agencies—the political appointees of 
President Trump—there was unani-
mous agreement that the hold was ill- 
advised and the aid should be released. 
Tim Morrison, national security ad-
viser to John Bolton, understood that 
the most senior appointed officials 
‘‘were all supportive of the continued 
disbursement of the aid.’’ 
On August 15, at the President’s golf 
club in Bedminster, NJ, members of 
the 
President’s 
Cabinet 
‘‘all 
rep-
resented to Ambassador Bolton that 
they were prepared to tell President 
they endorsed the swift release and dis-
bursement of the funding.’’ 
The President ignored his advisers’ 
recommendation to lift the hold. He 
provided no credible explanation for 
it—not from the day the hold was made 
until the day it was lifted. 
Witness 
after 
witness—including 
Hale, Vindman, Croft, Holmes, Kent, 
Cooper, Sandy—testified they weren’t

given any reason for the hold while it 
was in place. 
Croft said: ‘‘[T]he only reason given 
was that the order came at the direc-
tion of the President.’’ 
Mr. Holmes confirmed: ‘‘The order 
had come from the President without 
further explanation.’’ 
Kent testified too: ‘‘I don’t recall any 
coherent explanation.’’ 
Ambassador Sondland agreed: ‘‘I was 
never given a straight answer as to 
why it had been put in place to begin 
with.’’ 
Dr. Hill explained: ‘‘No, there was no 
reason given.’’ 
Even Senator MCCONNELL has said: ‘‘I 
was not given an explanation for the 
hold.’’ 
Even as OMB was implementing the 
hold, officers in OMB were saying it 
should be lifted. Mr. Sandy testified 
that his team drafted a memo on Au-
gust 7 to OMB Acting Director Russ 
Vought. It recommended lifting the 
hold because of, one, the assistance was 
consistent with national security to 
support a stable, peaceful Europe; two, 
the aid countered Russian aggression; 
and three, there was bipartisan support 
for the program. 
Michael Duffey, the senior political 
appointee overseeing funds, approved 
the memorandum. He agreed with the 
policy recommendations, and it wasn’t 
just OMB. Senior advisers in the ad-
ministration tried over and over again 
to convince President Trump to lift the 
hold over the summer. 
Sometime prior to August 16, Ambas-
sador Bolton had a one-on-one meeting 
with President Trump about the aid. 
The President didn’t budge. Then, at 
the end of August, when the hold on 
the aid became public, Ambassador 
Taylor expressed to multiple officials 
his concerns about withholding the aid 
from Ukraine at a time when it was 
fighting Russia. Ambassador Taylor 
stressed the importance of the hold not 
just as a message to Ukraine but, im-
portantly, to Russia as well. With-
holding the aid on vital military assist-
ance while Ukraine was in the midst of 
a hot war with Russia sent a message 
to 
Russia 
about 
U.S. 
support 
of 
Ukraine. 
Ambassador Taylor felt so strongly 
about the harm withholding the secu-
rity assistance that for the first time 
ever in his decades of service at the 
State Department, he sent a first-per-
son cable with his concerns to Sec-
retary Pompeo. In the cable, he de-
scribed directly the ‘‘folly’’ that Taylor 
saw in withholding the aid. Here is his 
testimony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Patrick MALONEY: Have you ever sent a 
cable like that? How many times in your ca-
reer of 40, 50 years have you sent a cable di-
rectly to the Secretary of State? 
Bill TAYLOR: Once. 
Patrick MALONEY: This time? 
Bill TAYLOR: Yes, sir. 
Patrick MALONEY: In 50 years? 
Bill TAYLOR: Rifle company commanders 
don’t send cables, but yes, sir. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Ambassador 
Taylor never received an answer to the 
cable, but he was told that Secretary 
Pompeo carried it with him to a White 
House meeting about security assist-
ance to Ukraine. 
It seemed this meeting about the aid 
may have occurred on August 30. There 
are 
press 
reports 
that 
Secretary 
Pompeo, Secretary Esper, and National 
Security Advisor Bolton discussed the 
hold with President Trump shortly 
after 
Ambassador 
Taylor 
sent 
his 
cable. Keep this in mind. This was 2 
days after the hold was publicly re-
ported and after the President was 
briefed on the whistleblower com-
plaint. 
Yet, 
even 
then, 
President 
Trump refused to release the aid. 
On August 30, Michael Duffey sent an 
email to Elaine McCusker, the DOD 
comptroller. It said: ‘‘Clear direction 
from POTUS to continue to hold.’’ 
President 
Trump 
has 
refused 
to 
produce this or any other email to Con-
gress. 
When the administration was forced 
to produce it in a freedom of informa-
tion case in response to a court order, 
this 
critical 
passage 
was 
actually 
blacked out. What is the reason for 
blacking out this direction from the 
President about an issue so central to 
this case? No reason has been given to 
us. So you should ask yourself this: 
What is the President hiding? 
The President finally released the 
hold on September 11, but, again, there 
was no credible reason given for the re-
lease. Mark Sandy testified that he 
could 
not 
recall 
another 
instance 
‘‘where a significant amount of assist-
ance was being held up’’ and he ‘‘didn’t 
have a rationale in this case.’’ 
On the day it was released, OMB still 
didn’t know why President Trump had 
ordered the hold. On September 11, the 
day the President finally released the 
aid, McCusker at DOD reportedly sent 
an email to Duffey asking: ‘‘What hap-
pened?’’ 
Michael Duffey answered: ‘‘Not ex-
actly clear but President made the de-
cision to go. Will fill you in when I get 
details.’’ 
So let’s take a step back for a 
minute. Why was no reason given to 
anyone for the President deciding to 
hold up hundreds of millions of dollars 
in military assistance to our allies? Be-
cause there was no supportable reason 
for withholding the aid. No one agreed 
with it. According to the 17 witnesses 
in the House impeachment inquiry, 
President Trump insisted on holding 
the aid and provided no reason, despite 
unanimous support for lifting the hold 
throughout his administration, includ-
ing his handpicked top advisers. It also 
wasn’t consistent with American pol-
icy. The aid had the clear support of 
career officers and political appointees 
in President Trump’s administration as 
important for national security. There 
was no national security or foreign pol-
icy reason provided. No one could 
think of one. DOD had already certified 
to Congress, as the law required, that 
Ukraine had met the anti-corruption 
conditions for the aid and that it 
planned to begin implementing the ex-
penditures. 
So why did the President do this? I 
think we know why. The President or-
dered the hold for an improper purpose: 
to pressure Ukraine to announce inves-
tigations that would personally benefit 
President Trump. 
That brings us to a key point. It 
wasn’t just that the President ordered 
a hold on the aid without any expla-
nation against the unanimous advice of 
his advisers and even after, for weeks, 
as his administration—both career and 
political appointees—continued to try 
to get him to release the hold. What 
the President was trying to hide was 
worse. What the President did was not 
just wrong; it was illegal. 
In 
ordering 
the 
hold, 
President 
Trump not only took a position con-
trary to his senior advisers, counter to 
congressional intent, and adverse to 
American national security interests 
in Ukraine, he also violated the law. 
This issue was not a surprise. From 
the start of the hold in July, compli-
ance of the Impoundment Control Act 
was a significant concern for OMB and 
DOD officials. Mark Sandy raised con-
cerns with his supervisor, Michael 
Duffey, that the hold might violate Im-
poundment Control Act. DOD voiced 
the same concerns. 
Laura Cooper from DOD described 
the discussion at a July 26 meeting 
with No. 2 officials at all of the rel-
evant agencies about the hold, stating: 
‘‘Immediately, deputies began to raise 
concerns about how this could be done 
in a legal fashion.’’ She further testi-
fied that there was no legal mechanism 
to use to implement the hold after Con-
gress had been notified of the release of 
the funding. 
At a July 31 meeting with more jun-
ior officials, Laura Cooper put all 
attendees on notice, including rep-
resentatives of the White House, that 
because ‘‘there were only two legally 
available options, and we do not have 
direction to pursue either,’’ DOD would 
have to start spending the funds on or 
about August 6. 
In other words, the President had a 
choice. He could release the aid, or he 
could break the law. He chose to break 
the law. He was so determined to turn 
up the pressure on Ukraine that he 
kept the hold for no legitimate purpose 
and without any congressional notifi-
cation for long enough to violate the 
law. 
The concerns from OMB and DOD 
were ultimately accurate. As has been 
mentioned just last week, the non-
partisan Government Accountability 
Office found that President Trump 
broke the law by implementing the 
hold and in failing to notify Congress 
about it. 
Because of the President’s hold, DOD 
was ultimately unable to spend all the 
$250 million in security assistance be-
fore the end of the fiscal year, as Con-
gress—as we—intended.

January 23, 2020 
As GAO explained, the Constitution 
grants the President no unilateral au-
thority to withhold funds from obliga-
tion. And they further explained: 
Faithful execution of the law does not per-
mit the President to substitute his own con-
stitutional priorities for those that Congress 
has enacted into law. OMB withheld funds 
for a policy reason, which is not permitted 
under the Impoundment Control Act. 
The bottom line, President Trump 
froze the aid to increase the pressure 
on Ukraine to announce the investiga-
tions he wanted. He violated the law. 
He violated his constitutional duty to 
take care that the laws be faithfully 
executed. 
But the President didn’t just violate 
the Impoundment Control Act while 
pressuring Ukraine to announce the in-
vestigations he wanted. He was dis-
honest about it in the process. This is 
really telling because he is still not 
telling the truth about it even now. 
The budget documents that imple-
mented the hold until September 11 as-
serted that it was being imposed to 
‘‘allow for an interagency process to 
determine the best use of such funds.’’ 
But that wasn’t true. There was no 
ongoing interagency process after July 
31 after it became clear that the entire 
interagency, including Cabinet offices, 
unanimously agreed the aid should be 
released. The truth is, there simply 
was no debate or review in the inter-
agency regarding the best use of such 
funds. So the reason given by the 
President was not only illegal; it was 
false too. 
The dishonesty in the budget docu-
ments weren’t the only steps that the 
President’s men at OMB took to cover 
up his misconduct and enable his 
scheme. OMB went so far as to remove 
the authority to approve the budget 
documents from Mark Sandy, a career 
officer, and gave it to Michael Duffey, 
a political appointee without experi-
ence managing such documents. 
This change was unusual. It occurred 
less than 2 weeks after Sandy raised 
concerns that the hold violated the 
law. Sandy was not aware of any prior 
instance when a political appointee as-
sumed this kind of funding approval 
authority. 
Duffey’s explanation that he simply 
wanted to learn more about the ac-
counts doesn’t make sense to Sandy. 
Really? This odd change in responsi-
bility was just another way to keep the 
President’s illegal hold within a tight- 
knit unit of loyal soldiers within the 
OMB. 
Michael Duffey defied the House’s 
subpoena. At the President’s direction, 
he refused to appear. The White House 
did not assert any privileges or immu-
nities when it directed Duffey to defy 
Congress’s subpoena. It wasn’t a real 
exercise of executive privilege. They 
told him not to appear, and they had 
no reason why. 
If Mr. Duffey knew about any legiti-
mate reason for the hold, I will bet he 
would not have been blocked from tes-
tifying. The fact that he was blocked 
might lead you to infer that his testi-
mony would be damaging to the Presi-
dent and would be consistent with the 
testimony of the other witnesses that 
the hold was solely used to ratchet up 
pressure on Ukraine. 
But the warning from DOD wasn’t 
just about how the hold was illegal. 
There 
were 
also 
practical 
con-
sequences. By August 12, the Depart-
ment of Defense told OMB it could no 
longer guarantee it would be able to 
spend all $250 million that Congress 
had directed before the end of the fiscal 
year. 
Not long after this August 12 email, 
DOD determined that time had run 
out. Ms. Cooper testified that DOD es-
timated that as much as $100 million of 
aid might go unspent, even if the hold 
was immediately lifted. As a result, 
DOD refused to certify that it would be 
able to spend the funds by September 
30. 
On August 20, OMB issued the first of 
six budget documents and removed the 
language providing legal cover for the 
hold. From that point on, the White 
House knew that DOD would not be 
able to spend all the funds, which was 
what the law required before Sep-
tember 30. Yet, even though he knew 
the hold would violate the Impound-
ment Control Act, President Trump 
continued the hold for another 23 days 
without telling us—without telling the 
Congress. 
This had the exact outcome that 
DOD feared. After the President lifted 
the hold on the evening of September 
11, DOD had only 18 days to spend the 
remaining $223 million, which is about 
89 percent of the total. DOD scrambled, 
and they spent all but approximately 
$35 million. About 14 percent of the ap-
propriated funds were left. 
That $35 million would have expired 
and would have been forever lost to 
Ukraine had Congress not stepped in to 
pass a law to roll the money over to 
the next year. But even as of today, 
more than $18 million of that money 
has not yet been spent. Why? You will 
have to ask DOD. They haven’t given 
us a reason. 
OK, all of this shows, clearly, that 
President Trump knowingly and will-
fully violated the law when he withheld 
aid from Ukraine. But just to be clear, 
the Articles of Impeachment do not 
charge Donald Trump with violating 
the Impoundment Control Act. We are 
not arguing that, but understanding 
this violation of the law is important 
to understanding the broader scheme of 
his abuse of power. It shows the great 
lengths the President was willing to go 
to in order to pressure Ukraine to do 
his political dirty work. 
The security assistance wasn’t some-
thing the law allowed him to give or 
take at his discretion. No, he was le-
gally obliged to release the money, but 
he simply didn’t care. 
Why? He was so determined to get 
the announcement from Ukraine to 
smear his election opponent that hold-
ing the aid to force Ukraine to do that 
was the most important thing. He 
didn’t care if he was breaking the law. 
I have been sitting here on the Sen-
ate floor. Honestly, I never wanted to 
be here under these circumstances. But 
I have been looking at ‘‘novus ordo 
seclorum.’’ Now, I didn’t study Latin. 
So I had to look it up. It means: ‘‘A 
new order of the ages is born.’’ That is 
what the Founders thought they were 
doing. Keeping that new order, the de-
mocracy, where the power is in the 
hands of the people, not in the hands of 
an unaccountable executive, is what we 
in the Congress—the House and the 
Senate—are charged to do. 
Senator BLUNT and I are in charge of 
the Joint Committee on Printing. 
Every year, we print a new copy of the 
Constitution. This year, in the back, 
we printed a quote: ‘‘At the conclusion 
of the Constitutional Convention, Ben-
jamin Franklin was asked, ‘What have 
you wrought?’ He answered, ‘ . . . a Re-
public, if you can keep it.’ ’’ 
That is the challenge that all of us 
face, and that you Senators face. 
I turn now to Mr. CROW, who will out-
line information about the President’s 
intentions. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Members of the Senate, counsel 
for the President, just bear with us a 
little while longer. I promise, we are 
almost there. 
You have heard a lot the last few 
days about what happened. How do we 
know that the President ordered the 
hold to pressure Ukraine to announce 
investigations that would help his per-
sonal political campaign? In other 
words, how do we know why it hap-
pened? 
We know it because, to this day, 
there is no other explanation. We know 
it because senior administration offi-
cials, including the President’s own 
senior political appointees, have con-
firmed it. We know it because the 
President’s own Chief of Staff said it at 
a national press conference. And we 
know it because the President himself 
directed it. 
Here are the facts. One, the President 
asked President Zelensky for a favor 
on July 25, and we all know what that 
favor was. 
Two, multiple U.S. officials with 
fact-based knowledge of the process 
have confirmed it. 
Three, President Trump lifted the 
hold only after his scheme was exposed. 
Four, there were no other legitimate 
explanations for the release of the 
hold. It was not based on a legitimate 
review of the foreign aid. It was not 
based on concerns of corruption in 
Ukraine. It was not because President 
Trump wanted countries to pay more. 
There are no facts that show that the 
President cared about any of those 
things. 
Five, as we know, White House Chief 
of Staff Mick Mulvaney admitted at a 
press conference that the bogus 2016 
election interference allegations were 
‘‘why we held up the money.’’ 
Eventually, the truth comes out. 
There was no legitimate policy reason

January 23, 2020 
for holding the aid. So the truth came 
out. 
As Ambassador Sondland said, the 
President was a businessman who saw 
congressionally 
approved, 
taxpayer- 
funded military aid for Ukraine, our 
partner at war, as just another busi-
ness deal to be made. Military aid in 
exchange for fabricated dirt on his po-
litical opponent. Dirt for dollars. This 
for that. A quid pro quo. 
Let’s start with the President’s own 
words to President Zelensky on the 
July 25 call. With the hold on his mind 
and on President Zelensky’s mind, 
too—we know that—President Trump 
linked military aid to his request for a 
favor. At the very beginning of the 
call, President Zelensky said: 
I would also like to thank you for your 
great support in the area of defense. We are 
ready to continue to cooperate for the next 
steps specifically we are almost ready to buy 
more Javelins from the United States for de-
fense purposes. 
The ‘‘great support in the area of de-
fense’’ included, of course, the $391 mil-
lion in military aid, because remember, 
just a month before, DOD had publicly 
announced its intent to provide $250 
million of that aid. President Zelensky 
was showing gratitude to the President 
for the aid that DOD had just an-
nounced would be on its way. But the 
President had put a hold just a few 
weeks before. 
Immediately 
after 
President 
Zelensky brought up the U.S. military 
support and said that Ukraine was al-
most ready to buy more Javelin anti- 
tank missiles, President Trump pivoted 
to what he wanted in return. He turned 
from the quid to the quo. 
President Trump immediately re-
sponded. He said: ‘‘I would like you to 
do us a favor though because our coun-
try has been through a lot and Ukraine 
knows a lot about it.’’ 
And what was that favor? Well, we 
all know by now; don’t we? It wasn’t to 
fight corruption. It wasn’t to help the 
United States or our national inter-
ests. It was the two specific political 
investigations that he wanted Ukraine 
to announce to help his own personal 
political campaign. President Trump’s 
quick pivot from the critical military 
aid that he knew Ukraine desperately 
needed 
to 
the 
investigations 
that 
would benefit him personally speaks 
volumes. By bringing up the investiga-
tions 
immediately 
after 
President 
Zelensky raised the issue of military 
support, he linked the two issues. 
U.S. officials listening to the call 
also made that connection. Here is 
what Jennifer Williams, Vice President 
PENCE’s aide, testified: 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. SCHIFF. But I was struck by some-
thing else you said in your deposition. You 
said that it shed some light on possible other 
motivations behind the security assistance 
hold. What did you mean by that? 
Ms. WILLIAMS. Mr. Chairman, I was asked 
during the closed-door testimony how I felt 
about the call; and, in reflecting on what I 
was thinking in that moment, it was the 
first time I had heard internally the Presi-
dent reference particular investigations that 
previously I had only heard about through 
Mr. Giuliani’s press interviews and press re-
porting. So, in that moment, it was not clear 
whether there was a direct connection or 
linkage between the ongoing hold on secu-
rity assistance and what the President may 
be asking President Zelensky to undertake 
in regard to investigations. So I—it was—it 
was noteworthy in that regard. I did not 
have enough information to draw any firm 
conclusions. 
Mr. SCHIFF. But it raised a question in 
your mind as to whether the two were re-
lated. 
Ms. WILLIAMS. It was the first I had 
heard of any requests of Ukraine which were 
that specific in nature. So it was noteworthy 
to me in that regard. 
Mr. Manager CROW. In fact, the hold 
was formally implemented by OMB the 
very day of the call. Just hours after 
the call between President Trump and 
President Zelensky, Duffey sent an 
email to senior DOD officials instruct-
ing them to put a hold on the security 
aid. He said he underscored: ‘‘Given the 
sensitive nature of the request, I appre-
ciate your keeping that information 
closely held to those who need to know 
to execute the direction.’’ In other 
words, don’t tell anybody about it. If 
the President ordered the hold for a le-
gitimate policy reason, then why did 
he want to hide it from the rest of the 
administration? 
President 
Trump 
has 
obstructed 
Congress’s ability to get those answers. 
We would like to ask Duffey why they 
wanted to keep it quiet. There is more 
evidence, of course—a lot more. In fact, 
there is so much evidence that, accord-
ing to witnesses, the fact that the secu-
rity assistance was conditioned on in-
vestigations became as clear as ‘‘two 
plus two equals four.’’ Everyone knew 
it. Indeed, with no explanation for the 
hold, unanimous support for its release 
in the administration, and ongoing ef-
forts by the President’s top advisers to 
pressure Ukraine into announcing the 
investigations by holding up the White 
House 
meeting, 
it 
became 
crystal 
clear, as confirmed by multiple wit-
nesses, that the only reason for the 
hold was to put additional pressure on 
Ukraine. 
David Holmes, the senior official at 
the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, explained. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
GOLDMAN. Mr. Holmes, you have testified 
that by late August you had a clear impres-
sion that the security assistance hold was 
somehow connected to the investigation that 
President Trump wanted. How did you con-
clude that—how did you reach that clear 
conclusion? 
HOLMES. We’d been hearing about the in-
vestigation since March, months before. 
President Zelensky had received a letter, a 
congratulatory letter, from the President 
saying he’d be pleased to meet him following 
his inauguration in May. And we hadn’t been 
able to get that meeting, and then the secu-
rity hold came up with no explanation. I’d be 
surprised if any of the Ukrainians . . . you 
said earlier, we discussed earlier, sophisti-
cated people . . . when they received no ex-
planation for why that hold was in place, 
they wouldn’t have drawn that conclusion. 
GOLDMAN. Because the investigations 
were still being pursued? 
HOLMES. Correct. 
GOLDMAN. And the hold was still remain-
ing without explanation? 
HOLMES. Correct. 
GOLDMAN. This to you was the only log-
ical conclusion that you could reach? 
HOLMES. Correct. 
GOLDMAN. Sort of like two plus two 
equals four? 
HOLMES. Exactly. 
Mr. Manager CROW. And Ambassador 
Sondland said the same thing. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
GOLDMAN. So, is this kind of a two plus 
two equals four conclusion that you reached? 
SONDLAND. Pretty much. 
GOLDMAN. Is the only logical conclusion 
to you that, given all of these factors, that 
the aid was also a part of this quid pro quo? 
SONDLAND. Yep. 
Mr. 
Manager 
CROW. 
Ambassador 
Sondland didn’t reach that conclusion 
based only on common sense. It was 
confirmed by Secretary Pompeo and 
Vice President PENCE, too. 
So let’s begin with what Secretary 
Pompeo knew about the link between 
the investigations and the aid. In front 
of you is an email. At the end of Au-
gust, before President Trump canceled 
his trip to Warsaw to meet with Presi-
dent Zelensky, Sondland sent an email 
to Secretary Pompeo in which he pro-
posed a pull-aside between President 
Zelensky and President Trump at the 
proposed meeting in Warsaw. Three 
minutes later, Secretary Pompeo re-
plied ‘‘yes.’’ That is it. Ambassador 
Sondland explained the email in his 
testimony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
The CHAIRMAN. Later in August, you told 
Secretary Pompeo that President Zelensky 
would be prepared to tell President Trump 
that his new justice officials would be able to 
announce matters of interest to the Presi-
dent, which could break the logjam. When 
you say matters of interest to the President, 
you mean the investigations that President 
Trump wanted. Is that right? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Correct. 
The CHAIRMAN. And that involved 2016 
and Burisma or the Bidens? 
Ambassador 
SONDLAND. 
2016 
and 
Burisma. 
The CHAIRMAN. And when you’re talking 
here about breaking the logjam, you’re talk-
ing about the logjam over the security as-
sistance, correct? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. I was talking 
logjam generically because nothing was 
moving. 
The CHAIRMAN. But that included the se-
curity assistance, did it not? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Correct. 
The CHAIRMAN. And based on the context 
of that email, this was not the first time you 
had discussed these investigations with Sec-
retary Pompeo, is it? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. No. 
The CHAIRMAN. He was aware of the con-
nections that you were making between the 
investigations and the White House meeting 
and the security assistance? 
Ambassador SONDLAND. Yes. 
Mr. Manager CROW. So let’s break 
that down for a minute. A meeting be-
tween two Presidents is a big deal. A 
pull-aside is a big deal. These are high-
ly choreographed events. Secretary 
Pompeo didn’t ask any questions and 
didn’t show any surprise or confusion 
in response to the email. Instead, he

S525 
January 23, 2020 
immediately endorsed the idea. This 
shows that Secretary Pompeo, who 
also listened to the July 25 call as well, 
understood that the security assistance 
was conditioned on the investigations. 
By this time, everyone knew what 
was happening. A simple ‘‘yes’’ by Sec-
retary Pompeo was enough. Secretary 
Pompeo wasn’t the only senior official 
who knew. Vice President PENCE knew 
as well. Sondland raised the issue to 
Vice President PENCE during a meeting 
to prepare for the Warsaw trip. At 
some 
point 
late 
in 
the 
meeting, 
Sondland said: ‘‘It appears that every-
thing is stalled until this statement 
gets made.’’ What Sondland was refer-
ring to, of course, was the military aid 
and the White House meeting. Ambas-
sador Sondland testified about Vice 
President PENCE’s reaction. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
GOLDMAN. Now, I want to go back to that 
conversation that you had with Vice Presi-
dent PENCE right before that meeting in 
Warsaw. And you indicated that you said to 
him that you were concerned that the delay 
in the aid was tied to the issue of investiga-
tions. Is that right? 
SONDLAND. I don’t know exactly what I 
said to him. This was a briefing attended by 
many people, and I was invited at the very 
last minute. I wasn’t scheduled to be there. 
But I think I spoke up at some point late in 
the meeting and said, it looks like every-
thing is being held up until these statements 
get made, and that’s my, you know, personal 
belief. 
GOLDMAN. And Vice President PENCE just 
nodded his head? 
SONDLAND. Again, I don’t recall any ex-
change or where he asked me any questions. 
I think he, it was sort of a duly noted re-
sponse. 
GOLDMAN. Well, he didn’t say, Gordon, 
what are you talking about? 
SONDLAND. No, he did not. 
GOLDMAN. He didn’t say, what investiga-
tions? 
SONDLAND. He did not. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Like Secretary 
Pompeo, Vice President PENCE wasn’t 
surprised, 
nor 
did 
he 
ask 
what 
Sondland 
meant—because 
they 
all 
knew. This meeting also confirmed 
Sondland’s 
understanding 
that 
the 
President had indeed conditioned the 
military aid on the public announce-
ment of the investigations. This was a 
commonsense conclusion, confirmed by 
the Secretary of State and the Vice 
President. 
With that confirmation in mind, 
Sondland pulled aside Yermak, the top 
aide to President Zelensky, imme-
diately after the Pence-Zelensky meet-
ing. Now, recall, he was the one who re-
sisted the public statement about the 
specific investigations in August. Am-
bassador Sondland described what he 
told Yermak in that short meeting. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
SONDLAND. Based on my previous com-
munication with Secretary Pompeo, I felt 
comfortable sharing my concerns with Mr. 
Yermak. It was a very, very brief pull-aside 
conversation that happened within a few sec-
onds. I told Mr. Yermak that I believed that 
the resumption of U.S. aid would likely not 
occur until Ukraine took some kind of ac-
tion on the public statement that we had 
been discussing for many weeks. 
Mr. Manager CROW. You see, this 
just wasn’t an internal scheme among 
the President’s top advisers. President 
Trump, through his agents, commu-
nicated the quid pro quo clearly to 
Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland told 
President Zelensky’s top aide on Sep-
tember 1 that Ukraine would not get 
the military aid unless it announced 
the investigations. This, my Senate 
colleagues, is the very definition of a 
quid pro quo. 
But other witnesses know it, too. 
Morrison watched Sondland’s conversa-
tion with Yermak and then received an 
immediate 
readout 
from 
Sondland 
after that meeting. Morrison urgently 
reported the interaction to Ambas-
sador Bolton on a secure phone call, 
and, of course, Bolton told him to go 
tell the NSC lawyers. 
Morrison did as he was instructed. He 
also told Ambassador Taylor. Ambas-
sador 
Taylor 
then 
confronted 
Sondland. Taylor texted: ‘‘Are we now 
saying that security assistance and WH 
meeting are conditioned on investiga-
tions?’’ 
Sondland responded: ‘‘Call me.’’ 
And as everyone knows, when some-
one says ‘‘call me,’’ it says stop put-
ting this in writing. 
During their subsequent phone call, 
Sondland confirmed to Taylor that the 
military aid was conditioned on an an-
nouncement of investigations and that 
President 
Trump 
wanted 
President 
Zelensky in a ‘‘public box.’’ 
Here is how Taylor, who took con-
temporaneous notes of the conversa-
tion, explained that call. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
TAYLOR. During that phone call Ambas-
sador Sondland told me that President 
Trump had told him that he wants President 
Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will 
investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian 
interference in the 2016 election. Ambassador 
Sondland also told me that he now recog-
nized that he had made a mistake by earlier 
telling Ukrainian officials that only a White 
House meeting with President Zelensky was 
dependent on a public announcement of the 
investigations. 
In 
fact, 
Ambassador 
Sondland said, everything was dependent on 
such an announcement including security as-
sistance. He said that President Trump 
wanted President Zelensky in a public box 
by making a public statement about order-
ing such investigations. 
Mr. 
Manager 
CROW. 
President 
Trump wanted President Zelensky in a 
‘‘public box.’’ A private commitment 
wasn’t enough for President Trump be-
cause he needed the political benefit, 
and he could only get the political ben-
efit if it was public. We all know how 
this works with President Trump, how 
he weaponizes investigations for polit-
ical purposes. 
Think about that for a second. That 
is actually the exact opposite of how 
law enforcement investigations are 
conducted. If they are legitimate, law 
enforcement does not announce to the 
world they are investigating before ac-
tually doing it. That would tip off your 
targets. It would lead to witness in-
timidation, destruction of evidence. 
But the President didn’t actively want 
a legitimate investigation. He only 
wanted the announcement. 
At the end of that conversation be-
tween Taylor and Sondland on Sep-
tember 1, Taylor asked Sondland to 
speak to the President to see if he 
could change his mind. That is exactly 
what Sondland did. 
On September 7, President Trump 
and Sondland spoke. We know the call 
was on September 7 for four reasons. 
First, Morrison testified that he had a 
conversation with Sondland on Sep-
tember 7 about Sondland’s discussion 
with the President. 
Second, Morrison told Taylor about 
this conversation on September 7. 
Third, Sondland and Taylor had a 
conversation on September 8 about the 
conversation that Sondland had the 
day before. 
Finally, Sondland texted Taylor and 
Volker on September 8 that he had 
conversations 
with 
‘‘POTUS’’ 
and 
‘‘Ze’’—meaning President Trump and 
President Zelensky. So we know that 
the conversations must have happened 
before the morning of September 8, 
when that text was sent. 
For his part, Sondland, who doesn’t 
take notes, also recalled that on that 
call, he simply asked President Trump 
an open-ended question about what he 
wanted from Ukraine. President Trump 
immediately responded: ‘‘I want no 
quid pro quo.’’ 
Let’s stop here for a second. The 
President has latched on to this state-
ment that he said that, and because he 
said it, it must be true, right? But wait 
just a minute. Remember what is hap-
pening here at the same time. The 
President had just learned about the 
whistleblower complaint in the Wash-
ington Post editorial linking the mili-
tary aid to the investigations just 2 
days before. The fact that the Presi-
dent immediately blurted that out 
speaks volumes. 
I am a parent, and there are a lot of 
parents in this room. I think many of 
you can probably relate to the situa-
tion where you are in a room and you 
hear a large crash in the next room, 
and you walk in, and your kid is sitting 
there, and that first thing that happens 
is ‘‘I didn’t do it.’’ 
But there is more. Sondland did ac-
knowledge that President Trump said 
he wanted Zelensky to ‘‘clear things 
up.’’ 
You will no doubt hear a lot from the 
President’s counsel that Sondland tes-
tified no one in the world told him that 
there was a quid pro quo, including 
President Trump. And, of course, that 
is right, because people engaging in 
misconduct don’t usually admit it. 
But we know exactly what the Presi-
dent told Sondland. We know it from 
the testimony of Tim Morrison and 
Ambassador Taylor. We know it be-
cause Sondland testified that his own 
conclusion that there was a quid pro 
quo was confirmed by his conversation 
with President Trump. And we know it 
because Sondland relayed the exact 
message to President Zelensky right 
after he spoke to President Trump.

take notes, and he readily admitted 
that if he could have seen his own doc-
uments prior to testifying, he would 
have remembered more. 
But Morrison and Taylor took exten-
sive notes at the time and testified 
based on those notes, and Sondland— 
and this is important—said he did not 
dispute any of the accounts of Morri-
son and Taylor. 
Let’s look at what Morrison and Tay-
lor said about that September 7 phone 
call. Here is Tim Morrison’s under-
standing of the Trump-Sondland call. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
GOLDMAN. Now, a few days later, on Sep-
tember 7th, you spoke again to Ambassador 
Sondland, who told you that he had just got-
ten off the phone with President Trump. Is 
that right? 
MORRISON. That sounds correct, yes. 
GOLDMAN. 
What 
did 
Ambassador 
Sondland tell you that President Trump said 
to him? 
MORRISON. If I recall this conversation 
correctly, 
this 
was 
where 
Ambassador 
Sondland related that there was no quid pro 
quo, but President Zelensky had to make the 
statement and that he had to want to do it. 
GOLDMAN. And by that point, did you un-
derstand that the statement related to the 
Biden and 2016 investigations? 
MORRISON. I think I did, yes. 
GOLDMAN. And that that was essentially 
a condition for the security assistance to be 
released? 
MORRISON. I understood that that’s what 
Ambassador Sondland believed. 
GOLDMAN. After speaking with President 
Trump? 
MORRISON. That’s what he represented. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Here is the con-
sistent recollection of how Ambassador 
Taylor described his understanding of 
the call. First, here is what he heard 
from Mr. Morrison. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
TAYLOR. According to Mr. Morrison, 
President Trump told Ambassador Sondland 
he was not asking for a quid pro quo, but 
President Trump did insist that President 
Zelensky go to a microphone and say he is 
opening investigations of Biden and 2016 
election interference and that President 
Zelensky should want to do this himself. 
Mr. Manager CROW. And second, 
here is Ambassador Taylor explaining 
what Sondland himself told Taylor 
about 
what 
took 
place 
on 
that 
Sondland-Trump call a day later. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
TAYLOR. He confirmed that he had talked 
to President Trump, as I had suggested a 
week earlier, but that President Trump was 
adamant that President Zelensky himself 
had to clear things up and do it in public. 
President Trump said it was not a quid pro 
quo. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Like Sondland, 
both Taylor and Morrison recalled that 
President Trump said that he did not 
want a quid pro quo, but they both tes-
tified that President Trump followed 
that statement immediately by de-
scribing perfectly an exchange of this 
for that—or, in other words, a quid pro 
quo. 
Prior to his call with the President, 
Sondland had reached the conclusion 
that the aid was being held until the 
public announcement of the investiga-
tions. That conclusion was confirmed 
by Secretary Pompeo and Vice Presi-
dent PENCE. Then Sondland relayed it 
to the Ukrainians. And after this phone 
call with President Trump, that con-
clusion was confirmed. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
GOLDMAN. Well, you weren’t dissuaded 
then, right, because you still thought that 
the aid was conditioned on the public an-
nouncement 
of 
the 
investigations 
after 
speaking to President Trump? 
SONDLAND. By September 8 I was abso-
lutely convinced it was. 
GOLDMAN. And President Trump did not 
dissuade you of that in the conversation that 
you acknowledge you had with him? 
SONDLAND. I don’t ever recall because 
that would have changed my entire calculus. 
If President Trump had told me directly, I’m 
not— 
GOLDMAN. That’s not what I’m asking, 
Ambassador Sondland. I’m just saying, you 
still believed that the security assistance 
was conditioned on the investigation after 
you spoke to President Trump. Yes or no? 
SONDLAND. From a timeframe stand-
point, yes. 
Mr. Manager CROW. How else do we 
know that President Trump confirmed 
to Sondland that the aid was condi-
tioned on the announcement? Sondland 
relayed 
the 
message 
to 
President 
Zelensky right after his conversation 
with President Trump. 
Here is Ambassador Taylor’s recol-
lection 
of 
what 
Sondland 
told 
Zelensky, based on his notes. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Ambassador 
TAYLOR. 
Ambassador 
Sondland also said that he had talked to 
President Zelensky and Mr. Yermak and had 
told them that, although this was not a quid 
pro quo, if President Zelensky did not clear 
things up in public, we would be at a stale-
mate. I understood a ‘‘stalemate’’ to mean 
that Ukraine would not receive the much 
needed military assistance. 
Mr. 
Manager 
CROW. 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
confirmed 
that 
Taylor’s 
memory of this call was accurate; 
there would be a stalemate without the 
investigations. Here is his testimony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
GOLDMAN. And then you also told Ambas-
sador Taylor in that same conversation that 
if President Zelensky, rather you told Presi-
dent Zelensky and Andriy Yermak that al-
though this was not a quid pro quo as the 
President had very clearly told you, it was 
however required for President Zelensky to 
clear things up in public or there would be a 
stalemate. You don’t have any reason to dis-
pute Ambassador Taylor’s recollection of 
that conversation you had with President 
Zelensky, do you? 
SONDLAND. No. 
GOLDMAN. And that you understood the 
stalemate referenced the aid, is that correct? 
GOLDMAN. At that point, yes. 
Mr. Manager CROW. A stalemate. 
Nothing would happen with the aid un-
less President Zelensky publicly an-
nounced the investigations. The Presi-
dent had not received his ‘‘quid’’ so 
there would be no ‘‘quo.’’ 
Don’t take my word for it. Here is a 
recap of how we knew what happened 
during the call. First, Sondland testi-
fied about the conversation. Second, 
Morrison 
received 
a 
readout 
from 
Sondland immediately after the call 
and testified based on his notes. Third, 
Taylor testified based on his own 
notes. And fourth, Sondland agreed 
that President Trump had confirmed a 
quid pro quo, and Sondland actually re-
layed the message to the President of 
Ukraine and told Ambassador Taylor 
about it. 
President Zelensky got the message. 
He succumbed to the pressure. At the 
end 
of 
the 
conversation 
between 
Sondland 
and 
President 
Zelensky, 
President Zelensky explained that he 
had finally relented. His country need-
ed the military aid, desperately. Their 
people were dying on the frontline all 
of the time. They were taking casual-
ties every day. He agreed to make the 
statement. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
TAYLOR. Ambassador Sondland said that 
this conversation concluded with President 
Zelensky agreeing to make a public state-
ment in an interview on CNN. 
Mr. 
Manager 
CROW. 
President 
Zelensky had resisted making the an-
nouncement of the corrupt investiga-
tions for months. He resisted when 
Giuliani and other agents of the Presi-
dent made it known that President 
Trump required it. He resisted when 
President Trump himself asked di-
rectly on July 25. He resisted when the 
White House meeting he so desperately 
desired was conditioned on that an-
nouncement. And he resisted as vital 
military aid was on hold. But the 
money is 10 percent of his entire de-
fense budget. Russia occupied the east-
ern part of his country. He could resist 
no more. 
Ambassador Taylor was worried that 
even if the Ukrainian leader did as 
President Trump wanted, President 
Trump might continue to hold the 
military aid. 
Ambassador Taylor texted his con-
cerns 
to 
Ambassadors 
Volker 
and 
Sondland stating: 
The nightmare is they give the interview 
and don’t get the security assistance. The 
Russians love it. (And I quit.) 
In other words, the nightmare is that 
they make the announcement but 
President Trump doesn’t release the 
aid. This would be perfect for the Rus-
sians. Russian propaganda would be 
adopted by the United States and the 
United States would be withdrawing its 
support for Ukraine. 
On September 9, Ambassador Taylor 
reiterated 
his 
concerns 
about 
the 
President’s quid pro quo in another se-
ries of text messages with Ambassadors 
Volker and Sondland. Ambassador Tay-
lor said: 
The message to the Ukrainians (and Rus-
sians) we send with the decision on security 
assistance is key. With the hold, we have al-
ready shaken their faith in us. Thus my 
nightmare scenario. 
And then later, he texted again say-
ing: 
Counting on you to be right about this 
interview, Gordon. 
Ambassador Sondland responded:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S527 
January 23, 2020 
Bill, I never said I was ‘‘right’’. I said we 
are where we are and believe we have identi-
fied the best pathway forward. Lets hope it 
works. 
Ambassador Taylor replied: 
As I said on the phone, I think it’s crazy to 
withhold security assistance for help with a 
political campaign. 
Here it is. Once again, in clear text 
message between three U.S. officials: 
‘‘It’s crazy to withheld security assist-
ance for help with a political cam-
paign.’’ 
Think about that. If there was no 
quid pro quo, then why did everybody 
know about it? Well, Ambassador Tay-
lor told us why, too. Here is his testi-
mony. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
TAYLOR. As I said on the phone, I think it 
is crazy to withhold security assistance for 
help with a political campaign. 
GOLDMAN. What did you mean when you 
said you thought it was crazy? 
TAYLOR. Mr. Goldman, I meant that the 
importance—because of the importance of 
security assistance that we had just de-
scribed and had a conversation with the 
chairman, because that was so important, 
that security assistance was so important 
for Ukraine as well as our own national in-
terests, to withhold that assistance for no 
good reason other than help with a political 
campaign made no sense. It was counter-
productive to all of what we had been trying 
to do. It was illogical. It could not be ex-
plained. It was crazy. 
GOLDMAN. And when you say ‘‘all of what 
we were trying to do,’’ what do you mean by 
‘‘we’’? 
TAYLOR. I mean that the United States 
was trying to support Ukraine as a frontline 
state against Russian attack. And, again, the 
whole notion of a rules based order was being 
threatened by the Russians in Ukraine. So 
our security assistance was designed to sup-
port Ukraine. And it was not just the United 
States; it was all of our allies. 
GOLDMAN. When you referenced ‘‘help 
with a political campaign’’ in this text mes-
sage, what did you mean? 
TAYLOR. I meant that the investigation 
of Burisma and the Bidens was clearly iden-
tified by Mr. Giuliani in public for months as 
a way to get information on the two Bidens. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Now, that testi-
mony is really clear, and it makes 
sense. It is consistent with all of the 
evidence you have seen here today. 
That is a quid pro quo as clear as two 
plus two equals four. 
And what happened next also makes 
sense. Sondland got scared. Taylor was 
making clear that he didn’t agree with 
the scheme. In response to Taylor’s 
text message that it was ‘‘crazy to 
withhold security assistance for help in 
a political campaign,’’ Sondland re-
peated again the false denial of a quid 
pro quo. At 5:17 a.m., Sondland re-
sponded to Taylor: 
Bill, I believe you are incorrect about 
President Trump’s intentions. The President 
has been crystal clear: no quid pro quos of 
any kind. The President is trying to evaluate 
whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the 
transparency and reforms that President 
Zelensky promised during his campaign. I 
suggest we stop the back and forth by text. 
If you still have concerns, I recommend you 
give Lisa Kenna or S— 
That is Secretary Pompeo— 
a call to discuss them directly. Thanks. 
Now, the text message says very 
clearly that there are no quid pro quos 
‘‘of any kind.’’ So end of story, right? 
Case closed. But Sondland’s testimony 
revealed this text and the President’s 
denial were false. Just like President 
Trump, when Ambassador Sondland 
thought he was getting caught, he got 
nervous, and he wanted to deny it in 
writing to cover his tracks. That is 
why he suddenly says: ‘‘I suggest we 
stop the back and forth by text.’’ 
Again, quit putting this in writing. 
We know that Sondland’s denial in 
the text was false because later, when 
he was under oath, under penalty of 
perjury, he actually said a quid pro quo 
did exist. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
SONDLAND. Was there a quid pro quo? As 
I testified previously with regard to the re-
quested White House call and the White 
House meeting, the answer is yes. 
Mr. Manager CROW. The answer is 
yes. It is clear that President Trump 
himself confirmed that the aid was 
conditioned on the public announce-
ment of the investigations that the 
President wanted. To get Ukraine to 
help him with his reelection campaign, 
the President of the United States vio-
lated the law by withholding nearly 
$400 million of taxpayer dollars in-
tended to fight Russia. He put his own 
interests over the country, and that is 
why we are here. 
Mr. Chief Justice and Members of the 
Senate, in deference to our proposed 
schedule and the late hour, I am now 
going to yield to my colleague, Mr. 
SCHIFF, to provide a brief recap of 
today and then we will begin again in 
the morning. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. He means the 
afternoon. 
Senators, Chief Justice, President’s 
counsel, it has been a long day. We 
started out the day with the Chaplain 
asking for empathetic listening, and I 
think that is certainly what you have 
delivered for us today. I know you have 
been bombarded with information all 
day, and when you leave this Chamber, 
you are bombarded again by members 
of the press. There is no refuge, I know. 
And I just want to thank you for keep-
ing an open mind about all the issues 
that we are presenting—an open mind 
for us and an open mind for the Presi-
dent’s counsel. That is all that we can 
ask for. 
Having watched you now for 3 days, 
whether it is someone you are pre-
disposed to agree with or predisposed 
not to, it is abundantly clear that you 
are listening with an open mind, and 
we can’t ask for anything more than 
that, so we are grateful. 
At the beginning of the trial, you 
may have seen the President’s tweet. 
He tweeted a lot, but he tweeted a com-
mon refrain: ‘‘Read the transcript.’’ So 
I thought at the end of the evening, I 
would join in the President’s request 
that you reread the transcript because 
now that you know a lot more of the 
facts of this scheme, it reveals a lot 
more about that conversation. 
Let me just point out a few things 
that may have escaped your attention 
about that transcript, which is not 
really a transcript because it is not 
complete. Let me just tell you a few 
things that may have escaped your at-
tention about that call record. We have 
already talked about it. I will not go 
into it again. There are the pivotal sec-
tions 
where 
he 
talks 
about 
CrowdStrike and he asks for that favor 
and he wants investigation of the 
Bidens. There is a lot more to that call. 
Now that you know so much more 
about that scheme, let me just point 
out a few things that really struck my 
attention. Early in the call, President 
Zelensky says: 
We brought in many many new people. Not 
the old politicians, not the typical politi-
cians, because we want to have a new format 
and a new type of government. 
Again, this is the July 25 call. Early 
in the call, President Zelensky wants 
to impress upon President Trump he 
has brought in new people; that he is a 
reformer. 
This 
was 
his 
campaign 
pledge. He is a reformer. He is coming 
in. He is bringing in new people. So if 
there had been any concern about cor-
ruption in Ukraine, he is bringing in 
new people. He is a reformer. That is 
one of the first messages he wants to 
get across. 
You can better well believe that he is 
prepared for this call because he needs 
that White House meeting. So every-
thing he says is prepared. And early on, 
he wants to make sure that he lets the 
President know he is a reformer. Now, 
the President has his own agenda in 
this call, and immediately after that, 
in the next exchange, the President 
makes this point: 
[T]he United States has been very very 
good to Ukraine. I wouldn’t say that it’s re-
ciprocal necessarily because things are hap-
pening that are not good but the United 
States has been very very good to Ukraine. 
This is very interesting that he 
brings up very early in the conversa-
tion this relationship is nonreciprocal. 
We’ve 
been 
‘‘very 
very 
good 
to 
Ukraine,’’ but, you know, can’t say 
there is much coming the other way. 
Now, you will remember that Bill 
Taylor had this reaction to talking to 
Gordon Sondland. When Sondland says: 
Donald Trump is a businessman. Before 
he writes a check, he likes to get what 
he is owed, Taylor’s reaction is, well, 
that makes no sense because Ukraine 
doesn’t owe us anything. 
Well, in this call you can see that 
Donald Trump does think he is owed. 
This is what he is talking about when 
he says ‘‘there’s not much reciprocity 
here.’’ He thinks he is owed something. 
You want to get this military, you 
want to get this meeting—I don’t see 
much reciprocity here. He thinks he is 
owed something. When you read that 
passage and you know about that: ‘‘He 
is a businessman. Before he signs a 
check’’ that takes on new meaning. 
Now, a little later in the call, 
Zelensky says: 
I will personally tell you that one of my 
assistants spoke with Mr. Giuliani just re-
cently and we are hoping very much that Mr.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S528 
January 23, 2020 
Giuliani will be able to travel to Ukraine and 
we will meet once he comes to Ukraine. 
You should read this carefully your-
self, but this may be the first mention 
of Giuliani. Zelensky is bringing him 
up and saying: Well, I would really like 
to meet with Giuliani. 
This is July. What do we know now 
about the meeting between Giuliani 
and Zelensky? We know that Giuliani, 
in May, wanted to go meet with 
Zelensky. We saw that letter from 
Giuliani: I want to go meet with 
Zelensky. And we know he was rebuffed 
or something happened because he 
didn’t get that meeting. And he was 
angry and went on TV and he said that 
Zelensky is surrounded by enemies of 
Trump, right? 
So Zelensky is prepared for this call, 
and he knows it is going to resonate 
with Donald Trump if he says he would 
like to meet with Rudy Giuliani. And 
immediately after that he says: ‘‘[W]e 
are hoping very much that Mr. Giuliani 
will be able to travel to Ukraine and 
we 
will 
meet 
once 
he 
comes 
to 
Ukraine.’’ Immediately thereafter, the 
next sentence he says: ‘‘I just wanted 
to assure you once again you have no-
body but friends around us.’’ 
Now, we could have read this tran-
script to you early on, and that 
wouldn’t have meant much to you, but 
now that you know that Rudy Giuliani 
was out there on TV saying Zelensky is 
surrounded by enemies of Trump, you 
can see why Zelensky says ‘‘you have 
nobody but friends around us.’’ And he 
goes on. ‘‘I also wanted to tell you that 
we are friends.’’ He brings up friendship 
again. ‘‘We are great friends.’’ That is 
the third time he wants to underscore 
what great friends they are. And why? 
Because Rudy Giuliani has been saying 
they are enemies. And then he goes on 
to say: 
I also plan to surround myself with great 
people and in addition to that investigation, 
I guarantee as the President of Ukraine that 
all the investigations will be done openly 
and candidly. That I can assure you. 
He needs to assure the President that 
he is going to get his deliverable be-
cause it has been made clear before 
this call what the President wants to 
hear—more than that—what the Presi-
dent needs to hear is there will be no 
stone unturned in that investigation. 
So the President in the next response 
says: 
Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man. He 
was the mayor of New York City, a great 
mayor, and I would like him to call you. 
Well, that sounds familiar, doesn’t 
it? Call Rudy. The same thing he told 
the three amigos in May: Call Rudy. 
Now he is telling Zelensky: Call Rudy. 
And he says: I will ask him to call you 
along with the Attorney General. Rudy 
very much knows what’s happening 
and he is a very capable guy. If you 
could speak to him, that would be 
great. 
Talk to Rudy. 
That is pretty remarkable—right?—a 
head-of-state to head-of-state call. It is 
not: Talk to my Secretary of State. It 
is not: Talk to my national security 
advisers. It is: Talk to Rudy. 
It is interesting, too, that it is not 
just Rudy, right? 
I will ask him to call you along with 
the Attorney General. 
That was quite a shock when this 
call record was released, right? The At-
torney General shows up in this call 
record. A couple of times, he shows up 
in this call record. 
That is when the Department of Jus-
tice immediately issues a statement: 
We have got nothing to do with this. 
We don’t know anything about this. 
The ink is barely dry. This thing has 
been released, and we don’t know what 
this is about. We haven’t talked about 
it. We haven’t gone to Ukraine. We 
don’t know a thing about it. 
Now, bear in mind a couple of other 
things that you know at this point. 
Bear in mind that there was a whistle-
blower 
complaint 
before 
this 
call 
record was released. Bear in mind that 
the law that we passed and you passed 
requires that a whistleblower com-
plaint that is designated to go to Con-
gress must go to Congress and must go 
to the intelligence committees. If the 
inspector general finds it credible and 
urgent, it has to not only go to Con-
gress, it has to go to Congress soon. 
There is a timetable. 
Bear in mind what happens when 
that complaint is filed and the inspec-
tor general says: It is not only cred-
ible—it is urgent. It is urgent. 
What happens? Well, it goes to the 
Acting Director of National Intel-
ligence. And what does he do? He con-
tacts the White House, and he contacts 
Bill Barr’s Justice Department. And 
what does Bill Barr’s Justice Depart-
ment do in consultation with the White 
House? They say: Don’t turn it over to 
Congress. You don’t have to turn it 
over to Congress. 
I know what the law says. It says 
‘‘you shall.’’ It doesn’t say ‘‘you may.’’ 
It doesn’t say ‘‘you might.’’ It doesn’t 
say ‘‘you can if you want to.’’ It 
doesn’t say ‘‘if the President doesn’t 
object.’’ It says ‘‘you shall.’’ We are 
telling you—Bill Barr’s Justice Depart-
ment is telling you—you don’t have to. 
The highest office of the law in the 
land is saying: Ignore the law. Ignore 
the law. We will come up with some ra-
tionalization. We will get our guys at 
the Office of Legal Counsel to write 
some opinion. We will find a way. Do 
not turn it over. You don’t have to. 
And they don’t. 
The inspector general, who deserves a 
lot of credit for guts, reports to the in-
telligence committees and says: They 
are violating the law, and I don’t know 
what to do about it. They are supposed 
to turn it over to you, and I don’t know 
what to do about it, but I need to tell 
you, to meet my obligation, they are 
not doing what they should. 
So we subpoena the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence, and we make it 
clear to the Director of National Intel-
ligence that he is going to have to 
come before Congress in an open hear-
ing and explain why he is the first Act-
ing Director to refuse to turn a com-
plaint over to Congress. The investiga-
tions are open. 
The result is they are forced to turn 
it over to Congress, and they are forced 
to release this call record, but here you 
have the Department of Justice weigh-
ing in: You don’t have to turn it over. 
It is the same call record that men-
tions the Attorney General of the 
United States, but it fails. That effort 
to cover up—to conceal the whistle-
blower complaint—fails, and it comes 
out. No sooner than it does, the Attor-
ney General says: We had nothing to do 
with this. 
Of course, if that had never been re-
leased, well then, the Attorney Gen-
eral’s name would have never come up 
in this call record, and there would 
have been no necessity to distance 
himself from the President’s actions. 
In the next exchange, President 
Zelensky says that he or she—he is 
going to have a new Prosecutor Gen-
eral—will look into the situation, spe-
cifically into the company that you 
mention in this issue. 
Now, this is also interesting: the 
company that you mention in this 
issue. 
There is no company mentioned in 
this issue in the call record, but, of 
course, you have heard now testimony 
from two witnesses who were on that 
call that Burisma was mentioned. 
So why isn’t Burisma in the call 
record? Well, I can say this: That call 
record went to that highly classified 
server, and the mention of Burisma 
didn’t make it into the call record. 
Zelensky goes on to say: The issue of 
the investigation of the case is actu-
ally the issue of making sure to restore 
the honesty. So we will take care of 
that, and we will work on the inves-
tigation of the case. 
Time after time after time, Zelensky 
feels the need to assure the President 
he is going to do those political inves-
tigations that the President wants. 
In the next exchange, after Zelensky 
says this, the President says: I will 
have Mr. Giuliani give you a call, and 
I am also going to have Attorney Gen-
eral Barr call, and we will get to the 
bottom of it. 
I mean, you can count. Don’t take 
my word, but I think there is no one 
who comes up more in this call record 
than Rudy Giuliani, which tells us 
something. 
In the next exchange, among other 
things, Zelensky says: I also wanted to 
thank you for your invitation to visit 
the United States, specifically Wash-
ington, DC. On the other hand, I also 
want to assure you that we will be very 
serious about the case, and we will 
work on the investigation. 
In the same way that earlier in the 
conversation Zelensky brings up those 
weapons he needs—those Javelins—the 
President immediately says: I have a 
favor. So we have military assistance 
and ‘‘I have a favor.’’ 
Here, Zelensky says: I want to thank 
you for your invitation to come visit. I

also want to assure you we are serious 
about doing the investigation. 
Clearly, he is linking the two, and, of 
course, he is linking the two because 
he is told the two are linked before the 
call, and he is conveying to the Presi-
dent: I got the message. 
The President, in the next exchange, 
says: I will tell Rudy and Attorney 
General Barr to call. 
Again, let’s make sure there is no 
misunderstanding here. 
I am going to have them call. I want 
you in touch with Rudy Giuliani and 
the Attorney General. I will tell Rudy 
and Attorney General Barr to call. 
Thank you. Whenever you would like 
to come to the White House, feel free 
to call. 
I am going to have you talk to Rudy 
and the Attorney General, and by the 
way, any time you want to come to the 
White House, just call. 
Give us a date, and we will work that 
out. I look forward to seeing you. 
Then Zelensky says: Thank you very 
much. I would be very happy to come. 
I am looking forward to our meeting. 
Again and again, Zelensky goes into 
that call with his wanting the meeting. 
You could tell what he was prepared 
for. He was prepared for the request for 
investigations. He knew what he had to 
promise, and he knew what he wanted 
to obtain, and that was the visit. 
You also saw in that video, that rath-
er sad video—yes, sort of humorous but 
sad, 
too—Zelensky 
and 
President 
Trump at the U.N., where he is saying: 
You know, I still haven’t gotten that 
meeting. 
I can tell you something—and this is 
what is so frightening about these cir-
cumstances. If we had not discovered 
all of this, he would likely be saying at 
that U.N. meeting: You know, we are 
still waiting on that military aid. 
Yes, we forced the aid to be released 
because the President got caught, but, 
even now, our ally can’t get his foot in 
the door. Even now, our ally can’t get 
his foot in the door. 
This brings me to the last point I 
want to make tonight, which is, when 
we are done, we believe that we will 
have made the case overwhelmingly of 
the President’s guilt—that is, that he 
has done what he is charged with. He 
withheld the money. He withheld the 
meeting. He used it to coerce Ukraine 
to do these political investigations. He 
covered it up. He obstructed us, and he 
is trying to obstruct you. He has vio-
lated the Constitution. 
But I want to address one other thing 
tonight. OK. He is guilty. OK. He is 
guilty. Does he really need to be re-
moved? We have an election coming up. 
Does he really need to be removed? He 
is guilty. You know, is there really any 
doubt about this? I mean, do we really 
have any doubt about the facts here? 
Does anybody really question whether 
the President is capable of what he is 
charged with? Nobody is really making 
the argument ‘‘Donald Trump would 
never do such a thing’’ because, of 
course, we know that he would, and, of 
course, we know that he did. 
It is a somewhat different question, 
though, to ask: OK. It is pretty obvi-
ous. Whether we can say it publicly or 
we can’t say it publicly, we all know 
what we are dealing with here with 
this President, but does he really need 
to be removed? 
This is why he needs to be removed: 
Donald Trump chose Rudy Giuliani 
over his own intelligence agencies. He 
chose Rudy Giuliani over his own FBI 
Director. He chose Rudy Giuliani over 
his own national security advisers. 
When all of them were telling him this 
Ukraine 2016 stuff was kooky, crazy, 
Russian propaganda, he chose not to 
believe them. He chose to believe Rudy 
Giuliani. That makes him dangerous to 
us, to our country. That was Donald 
Trump’s choice. 
Why would Donald Trump believe a 
man like Rudy Giuliani over a man 
like Christopher Wray? OK. Why would 
anyone in his right mind believe Rudy 
Giuliani over Christopher Wray? Be-
cause he wanted to, because what Rudy 
was offering him was something that 
would help him personally and what 
Christopher Wray was offering him was 
merely the truth. What Christopher 
Wray was offering him was merely the 
information he needed to protect this 
country and its elections, but that was 
not good enough. What is in it for him? 
What is in it for Donald Trump? This is 
why he needs to be removed. 
You may be asking: How much dam-
age can he really do in the next several 
months until the election? A lot—a lot 
of damage. 
We just saw last week a report that 
Russia tried to hack or maybe did hack 
Burisma, OK? I don’t know if they got 
in. I am trying to find out. My col-
leagues on the Intel Committees of the 
House and Senate are trying to find 
out. Did the Russians get in? What are 
the Russians’ plans and intentions? 
Well, let’s say they get in, and let’s 
say they start dumping documents to 
interfere in the next election. Let’s say 
they start dumping some real things 
they have from Burisma. Let’s say 
they start dumping some fake things 
they didn’t hack from Burisma, but 
they want you to believe they did. 
Let’s say they start blatantly inter-
fering in our election again to help 
Donald Trump. 
Can you have the least bit of con-
fidence that Donald Trump will stand 
up to them and protect our national in-
terests over his own personal interests? 
You know you can’t, which makes him 
dangerous to this country. You know 
you can’t. You know you can’t count 
on him. None of us can. 
What happens if China got the mes-
sage? Now, you can say: Well, he is just 
joking, of course. He didn’t really mean 
China should investigate the Bidens. 
You know that that is no joke. 
Now, maybe you could have argued it 
3 years ago when he said: Hey, Russia. 
If you are listening, hack Hillary’s 
emails. Maybe you could have given 
him a freebee and said he was joking, 
but now we know better. Hours after he 
did that, Russia did, in fact, try to 
hack Hillary’s emails. There is no mul-
ligan here when it comes to our na-
tional security. 
So what if China does overtly or cov-
ertly start to help the Trump cam-
paign? Do you think he is going to call 
them out on it or do you think he is 
going to give them a better trade deal 
on it? 
Can any of us really have the con-
fidence that Donald Trump will put na-
tional interests ahead of his personal 
interests? Is there really any evidence 
in this Presidency that should give us 
the ironclad confidence that he would 
do so? You know you can’t count on 
him to do that. That is the sad truth. 
You know you can’t count on him to do 
that. 
The American people deserve a Presi-
dent they can count on to put their in-
terests first—to put their interests 
first. 
Colonel Vindman said: Here, right 
matters. Here, right matters. 
Well, let me tell you something. If 
right doesn’t matter—if right doesn’t 
matter—it doesn’t matter how good 
the Constitution is; it doesn’t matter 
how brilliant the Framers were; it 
doesn’t matter how good or bad our ad-
vocacy in this trial is; it doesn’t mat-
ter how well written the oath of impar-
tiality is. If right doesn’t matter, we 
are lost. If the truth doesn’t matter, we 
are lost. The Framers couldn’t protect 
us from ourselves if right and truth 
don’t matter. And you know that what 
he did was not right. 
You know, that is what they do in 
the 
old 
country 
that 
Colonel 
Vindman’s father came from or the old 
country 
that 
my 
great-grandfather 
came from or the old countries that 
your ancestors came from or maybe 
you came from, but here, right is sup-
posed to matter. It is what has made us 
the greatest Nation on Earth. No Con-
stitution can protect us if right doesn’t 
matter anymore. 
And you know you can’t trust this 
President to do what is right for this 
country. You can trust he will do what 
is right for Donald Trump. He will do it 
now. He has done it before. He will do 
it for the next several months. He will 
do it in the election if he is allowed to. 
This is why, if you find him guilty, you 
must find that he should be removed— 
because right matters. Because right 
matters. And the truth matters. Other-
wise, we are lost.

leader is recognized.
