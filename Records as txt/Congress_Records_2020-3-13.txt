God of mercy, thank You for giving 
us another day. 
Bless the Members of the people’s 
House today, a legislative day in re-
sponse to the growing impact of the 
coronavirus. As our leaders near an 
agreement on an economic stimulus 
package to combat the effects of the 
pandemic, send Your comforting and 
encouraging spirit to each one. 
May they, united in their resolve to 
serve all Your people, put aside the di-
visions that exist to find an effective 
response that benefits all, but most es-
pecially those who are one or two pay-
checks removed from long-lasting neg-
ative impacts beyond the presence of 
the disease itself. 
We thank You, as well, for those men 
and women in the private sector whose 
generosity and sensitivity to the vul-
nerable have emerged to the edifi-
cation of all who have eyes to see. 
Bless them for their response in the 
current environment. 
Finally, continue to bless those who 
suffer with the virus infection and 
those whose labor is in treating this 
illness and finding an effective cure. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

PROMPT ACTION NEEDED TO AD-
DRESS CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC 
(Mrs. DINGELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Families First 
Coronavirus Response Act. 
Our Nation is confronting an unprec-
edented pandemic, unlike what any of 
us can remember. 
Our role in the Congress is to be 
proactive and ensure public health offi-
cials have the resources and tools that 
they need to keep our communities 
safe in the coming weeks and months. 
Prompt action is needed to address 
this extraordinary situation, and the 
Families First Coronavirus Response 
Act begins to meet the needs of many 
people in our communities. 
The legislation ensures testing is 100 
percent covered and paid sick leave. It 
ensures that food and economic assist-
ance goes directly to hardworking men, 
women, and families deeply affected by 
the outbreak. 
It also provides much-needed finan-
cial assistance to the States to meet 
this critical public health challenge 
that they are facing right now. 
Leaders must lead. People are legiti-
mately afraid, but we have to work to-
gether to address this issue.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1674 
March 13, 2020 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the extension of the 
Chemical 
Facility 
Anti-Terrorism 
Standards program. 
The CFATS program, first authorized 
in 2006, is a continuation of congres-
sional efforts since September 11 to 
protect the homeland. The program 
surgically and directly addresses gaps 
in Federal law regarding the security 
of high-risk facilities that use or pos-
sess chemicals of concern at levels of 
concern. 
The program is unique in that, to 
avoid overlapping with other Federal 
programs, CFATS was designed to fos-
ter collaboration between the govern-
ment and regulated parties. 
CFATS is a security program. Re-
grettably, over the years, some have 
tried to make CFATS a safety pro-
gram, but safety and security are two 
very different things. Security is about 
protecting your ability to operate, and 
safety is about controlling how you op-
erate. We should continue to preserve 
the program’s focus on security. 
Finally, it is imperative that, going 
forward, we find a way to extend the 
life of the program for a longer period 
of time, at least 5 years, in order to 
give the program, its personnel, and 
the participants the consistency they 
all need to be successful in their mis-
sion. 
f 
DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MINI-
MIZE DAMAGE FROM PANDEMIC 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, 
today, the House will vote on the Fam-
ilies First Coronavirus Response Act. 
This 
critical 
legislation 
provides 
much-needed support for working peo-
ple across America. 
It 
includes 
funding 
for 
free 
coronavirus tests for everyone who 
needs it; 14 days of paid sick leave and 
up to 3 months of paid family and med-
ical leave; enhanced unemployment in-
surance that will protect furloughed 
workers; food security through SNAP, 
student meals, senior nutrition, and 
food banks; and increased Federal 
funds for Medicaid. 
We are facing an enormous crisis in 
our country right now. 
Once we pass this bill, the Senate and 
the President need to act swiftly so 
these resources are made available to 
the American people. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Speaker 
NANCY PELOSI and all of our colleagues 
who worked so hard on this over the 
last several days. Nothing is more im-
portant than protecting the health and 
well-being of the American people. 
There is more work to be done, and 
we will do whatever it takes, bear any 
burden, confront any obstacle in order 
to minimize the damage that this pan-
demic will do to our country, and we 
will do all that we can to keep our 
country and our constituents safe. 
SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES TO 
HELP RECOVERY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, the 
prevailing thought has been ‘‘things 
will get worse before it gets better,’’ 
and recently, it appears the ‘‘worse’’ 
part is here. 
Necessary measures are being taken 
as we have learned more about this 
virus. We now have a new term: ‘‘social 
distancing.’’ 
Small businesses, though, are suf-
fering, and tourism, the economy in 
general. This outbreak is causing a lot 
of hurt. 
Now more than ever, it is important 
to support our local small businesses. 
They are the backbone of our economy 
and are experiencing a decline that we 
haven’t seen in a long time from the 
recent coronavirus outbreak in their 
towns. 
Their failure will result in a much 
larger problem for a country that has 
proven to be quite resilient. 
The SBA is offering disaster assist-
ance loans to small businesses im-
pacted by the virus. 
The issue is to ease and cushion our 
economy so that, in a few weeks, we 
can start our bounce back. And, indeed, 
we will bounce back. 
Last week’s measure will help our 
health 
providers. 
Hopefully, 
this 
week’s economic package is not chock- 
full of socialist wish lists by the Demo-
crats but is something that will actu-
ally be helpful to save lives and the 
economy and is affordable at the same 
time. 
I hope we can accomplish good work 
this week. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS NOT REPUBLICAN 
OR DEMOCRATIC 
(Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. 
Madam Speaker, today, the House of 
Representatives will consider the Fam-
ilies First Coronavirus Response Act, 
critical legislation to expand paid 
emergency leave for American work-
ers, to ensure free coronavirus testing, 
to bolster unemployment insurance for 
furloughed workers, and to strengthen 
our safety net for workers and students 
experiencing food insecurity due to clo-
sures. 
Democrats and Republicans must 
continue to advance this emergency 
legislation to protect the health and 
economic security of the American 
people. 
The coronavirus does not choose Re-
publican or Democrat, and the Amer-
ican people are looking to this Cham-
ber for swift and decisive leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I thank our front-
line nurses, doctors, physicians, public 
health officials, and first responders for 
their tireless and courageous efforts to 
keep Granite Staters safe. They are he-
roes to all of us, and they are bringing 
needed comfort to those who have been 
impacted by this public health crisis. 
f 
HONORING 
CAPTAIN 
MOISES 
NAVAS 
AND 
GUNNERY 
SER-
GEANT DIEGO PONGO 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
Captain Moises Navas and Gunnery 
Sergeant Diego Pongo, both Marine 
Raiders, lost their lives on March 8 
while on a mission to eliminate ISIS 
terrorists in Iraq. 
I met Captain Navas last year when 
he spoke at a ceremony to rename a 
local post office in honor of his fallen 
comrade, 
Sergeant 
Dietrich 
Schmieman, a central Washington na-
tive. 
With great poise and humility, the 
captain said at the time: ‘‘We can all 
sleep well and find comfort in knowing 
that it is Americans who raise their 
hands; this Nation’s defense is in the 
hands 
of 
guys 
such 
as 
Dietrich 
Schmieman.’’ 
Madam Speaker, it is imperative 
that we not lose sight of the fact that, 
as we speak, the brave men and women 
of our Armed Forces are standing 
guard to keep our Nation safe. 
Today, I rise to echo those powerful 
words from a brave young captain, pic-
tured 
here 
alongside 
Sergeant 
Schmieman’s parents at the post office 
dedication, to say that we can indeed 
sleep soundly because of heroes like 
Moises, Diego, and Dietrich. 
f 
HONORING SIDNEY ESKENAZI 
(Mr. PENCE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my friend and fellow 
Hoosier, Sidney Eskenazi. He will be 
celebrating 
his 
90th 
birthday 
this 
March 25. 
Sidney is a true philanthropist and 
civic leader. He and his loving wife, 
Lois, serve as pillars of our Hoosier 
community and role models for future 
generations. Without their charitable 
efforts, many Hoosiers would not have 
access to higher education, the fine 
arts, and quality healthcare. 
Indiana is indebted to the Eskenazis 
for their leadership and generosity over 
the past five decades. 
The Pence family, my wife, my chil-
dren, are truly blessed to consider Sid-
ney and Lois close friends, and we 
thank them for serving our commu-
nities with a true servant heart. 
God bless Sid and Lois, and I look 
forward to continuing to work with 
them for the benefit of Hoosiers every-
where. 
Happy birthday, Sid.

March 13, 2020 
WE REPRESENT ALL OF AMERICA 
(Mr. REED asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I came 
down this morning, after hearing Fa-
ther Conroy give his opening speech, to 
address this House and to address this 
Nation today in these hallowed Halls 
to send the message that today is not a 
day to engage in partisan politics. 
As a Republican, my hand is open to 
my fellow Americans, for us to come 
together, to stand with our Nation as 
we face this coronavirus crisis across 
the country. 
Madam Speaker, the people of Amer-
ica are who we represent. They are not 
Democrat and Republican; they are 
American. Now is the time to lead with 
smart, targeted decisionmaking pro-
posals that will improve their lives for 
the better. 
God bless.

COVID–19 REQUIRES 
COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE 
(Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam 
Speaker, Miami-Dade County has its 
first two confirmed cases of COVID–19, 
and we are all very concerned. Across 
the country, events are canceled and 
store shelves are empty. With anxieties 
high, we are receiving mixed messages 
when what we need right now is coher-
ent direction. 
It is discouraging to see countries 
like South Korea respond much more 
effectively than we are. While they 
screen tens of thousands, we have sick 
patients and frustrated doctors who 
cannot access testing. 
This is not right. We must make 
tests available and accessible to every-
one. 
We 
must 
strengthen 
our 
healthcare system so we have the beds, 
the masks, the respirators, and the 
supplies to respond to a surge in cases. 
We must provide relief to our working 
families and local businesses strug-
gling to cope with this virus. 
Madam Speaker, I believe we have it 
within us to fulfill these needs, but we 
all must come together for a com-
prehensive response to meet this mo-
ment. I urge my colleagues to support 
this legislation.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. LOWEY) and the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 6201, 
currently under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Families First 
Coronavirus Response Act builds on 
the $8.3 billion supplemental enacted 
last week to meet the needs of the 
American people, by: 
Guaranteeing free coronavirus test-
ing; 
Providing paid leave; and 
Strengthening food security initia-
tives through additional investments 
in WIC, food banks, and senior nutri-
tion. 
The bill also makes sure that chil-
dren who depend on free and reduced- 
price meals have access to food during 
school and childcare closures. 
Mr. Speaker, we must help ensure the 
physical safety and financial security 
of our Nation’s working families during 
this time of crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in support of this legislation, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6201, the second coronavirus re-
lief bill. 
Fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills 
were enacted less than 3 months ago, 
which included record levels of spend-
ing on our public health infrastructure. 
This allowed the administration to re-
spond immediately to the coronavirus 
when the threat became clear. 
Last week, the House and Senate 
voted almost unanimously on an $8 bil-
lion emergency supplemental, giving 
the administration new resources to re-
spond to the virus. Unfortunately, the 
threat we face has grown more complex 
and costly in only a week’s time. 
The bill before us will provide a sec-
ond installment of supplemental funds 
and combat the negative economic ef-
fects of this disease that has now been 
called a pandemic. 
This legislation builds off of last 
week’s bill, where we expanded the 
availability of tests for the coronavirus 
to ensure that everyone who needs to 
be tested, gets tested. 
Mr. Speaker, in his remarks today, 
the President reaffirmed his commit-
ment to distribute millions of tests and 
speed up how they are processed. This 
bill takes the next step to include more 
than $1 billion to cover the cost of tak-
ing these tests, including for service-
members and veterans. We must ensure 
tests are administrated so that people 
know if they are infected. This is the 
only way we can stop the spread of this 
virus. 
Emergency food assistance is pro-
vided in the bill for seniors, women, 
children, 
and 
low-income 
families. 
That includes additional help for chil-
dren whose schools are being closed as 
a precautionary measure to keep them 
safe. 
Tax incentives are included to en-
courage American businesses to allow 
employees to take emergency leave to 
limit the spread of the virus. No one 
should have to choose between getting 
a paycheck or infecting other people. 
Mr. Speaker, we have heard many 
concerns about the needs of small busi-
nesses. In addition to the tax incen-
tives in the bill, more than $37 billion 
is already available from prior appro-
priations for the Small Business Ad-
ministration to make loans. As we 
watch the impact of this virus on our 
Nation’s job creators, I will continue 
working with the administration and 
my colleagues to ensure they get the 
help they need. 
While bringing this bill to the floor 
has taken much longer than I had 
hoped, it is time for Congress to pass 
it. This bill will give the President and 
our public health officials the tools 
that are needed right now to respond to 
this quickly changing threat. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting for this measure. We 
must pass this bill today to help lessen 
the devastating impact of this global 
pandemic on the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 0020 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. 
NEAL), the chair of the Committee on 
Ways and Means. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this important legislative package 
to protect Americans’ health and fi-
nancial security as our Nation con-
fronts the coronavirus crisis. 
I want to highlight quickly three 
policies that the Ways and Means Com-
mittee contributed to the measure be-
fore us this evening. 
First, we are ensuring that the 
coronavirus testing is provided free of 
charge. It is imperative that anyone 
who needs to be tested for coronavirus 
is able to afford that testing. If individ-
uals worry that they can’t afford the 
cost of the test, they will forgo it and 
risk endangering themselves and their 
community. 
To provide Americans with the nec-
essary confidence they need to seek 
testing, we have included a provision 
that ensures free coronavirus testing in 
Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP, as well 
as for people enrolled in private insur-
ance, the uninsured, Tribal commu-
nities receiving care outside of Indian 
health facilities, and our military fam-
ilies. 
Second, we are making a historic 
emergency commitment to paid leave 
for the American family members af-
fected by coronavirus. One of our top 
priorities was to get Americans af-
fected by coronavirus emergency paid 
leave so that they can pay their bills. 
After intense negotiation with Treas-
ury, we have agreed that this is an 
emergency. 
We will require employers to provide 
the leave and reimburse them for the 
full cost via tax credits. Affected self- 
employed workers would be eligible for 
refundable tax credits. 
In the long run, we need a com-
prehensive paid leave program like the 
one in the FAMILY Act. If we had that 
now, we would be in a far better place 
with options available to us as workers 
confront these challenges. 
Finally, we are implementing meas-
ures to stabilize the unemployment in-
surance system and make sure that 
workers can access their earned bene-
fits. These provisions will immediately 
help States deal with spikes in unem-
ployment and prepare them for any fu-
ture local or national recessions. 
These provisions give States nec-
essary flexibility to provide unemploy-
ment insurance to coronavirus-affected 
individuals without delays caused by 
waiting periods and work search re-
quirements. 
I want to acknowledge, in closing, 
that despite the urgency with which we 
have worked, this legislation had the 
benefit of extensive bipartisan negotia-
tions and thoughtful consideration. My

H1688 
March 13, 2020 
staff has worked around the clock, as 
always, working with Ranking Member 
BRADY’s staff to get bipartisan input 
into these provisions. 
The Speaker and I have spent much 
time on the phone with the Secretary 
of the Treasury to ensure, along with 
Mr. Mnuchin, that this bill is a solu-
tion that the administration and both 
parties in this institution can support. 
As a result, we have a very good 
product here. I am confident this meas-
ure will pass Congress with full bipar-
tisan support and reach the President’s 
desk without issue. 
As we face this challenge, Americans 
are looking to their government lead-
ers to come together and present real 
solutions. Today, we are doing that. We 
are taking decisive action to help limit 
the spread of coronavirus, allow Ameri-
cans critical access to testing, and pro-
vide families financial security in the 
near and the long term. 
Lastly, let me acknowledge the com-
mittee staff at the Ways and Means 
Committee for the work that they have 
put into this legislative achievement. 
Legislative counsel truly put in a Her-
culean effort to assemble this bill, 
along 
with 
leadership 
staff. 
They 
worked around the clock, all hours of 
the day and night, to create the imme-
diacy of this legislation that will slow 
the spread of this virus, support Amer-
ican workers and families, and save 
lives. 
In particular, I want to acknowledge 
the teams on our Health, Worker and 
Family Support, Select Revenue Meas-
ures, and Social Security Subcommit-
tees for their excellent contributions. 
The American people will be better 
equipped to weather this crisis thanks 
to their important bipartisan work. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge full support of 
this legislation. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
to 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. BRADY). 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, President 
Trump’s declaration of a national 
emergency is a call to action to protect 
American’s health and well-being and 
protect the economy. 
This bill, thanks to the leadership of 
Secretary Mnuchin and Leader MCCAR-
THY, and working with both sides of the 
aisle, meets many of these goals. 
The President has succeeded in work-
ing with the private sector to achieve 
free testing, and now our bill builds on 
that. Americans in need of lab tests for 
the coronavirus will get them free. 
We are making good on President 
Trump’s promise to provide financial 
assistance for working Americans who 
are ‘‘ill, quarantined, or caring for oth-
ers due to coronavirus,’’ and it does so 
using our Tax Code rather than by cre-
ating a new entitlement. 
The original bill contained provisions 
that would create undue burdens on 
America’s small businesses. I have spo-
ken directly with President Trump, the 
champion of small business, who agrees 
that America’s small businesses need 
flexibility and cash flow when pro-
viding emergency leave for workers so 
that they can operate and survive dur-
ing this economic challenge. 
In order to help small businesses and 
their workers, language has been added 
to this bill, and President Trump is di-
recting the Secretaries of the Treasury 
and Labor to write rules to ensure that 
small businesses do have the flexibility 
to provide paid leave for their employ-
ees. 
They shouldn’t have to be concerned 
about cash flow when they work to re-
tain the workers they need to operate 
and keep serving their customers and 
our communities. This is vital to 
America’s economic rebound. 
This bill also protects seniors and 
those with severe medical conditions 
by ensuring that the Social Security 
Administration is not running a new 
permanent mandate. 
We were also able to stop some mis-
guided demands. In this bill, the health 
provisions are now limited to COVID–19 
without 
including 
unrelated 
treat-
ments, ensuring that pro-life Hyde 
amendment protections remain intact 
to prevent taxpayer funds being used 
for abortions. 
Republicans were able to block ef-
forts to add new burdens on hospitals 
that would have overruled the CDC’s 
science-based guidelines and prevented 
critical 
flexibility 
for 
our 
local 
healthcare providers. 
These are temporary, targeted meas-
ures. They are temporary because we 
have seen what happens when a bill 
that is supposed to be ‘‘timely, tar-
geted, and temporary’’ drags on for 
years. It prolongs economic hardship. 
We will rebound, and we will rebound 
strongly. 
Good 
policies—ones 
that 
strengthen our local communities—re-
sult in speedy recoveries. 
In America, we know we are blessed, 
even when faced with great adversity. 
We are blessed by an abundance not 
only of resources but of spirit. It is 
that very spirit that will get us 
through the coronavirus and the other 
challenges we face in the future. 
While today’s bill is not perfect, it is 
another step in the right direction to-
ward safety and security and a revital-
ized economy. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote for 
this bill and then come back to the 
table so we can continue our work to 
keep American workers and families 
prepared, safe, and healthy. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, the hour 
is late, vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we have 
once again been called to respond to a crisis. 
In the past, we have faced national security 
threats and natural disasters. But today, it is 
something radically different: A pandemic. 
What started half a world away has now 
spread to more than 100 countries, including 
the United States. Layoffs have begun, 
schools have cancelled classes, and large 
gatherings have been banned. 
The impacts of this virus are cascading 
across society. People’s health is at risk. And 
for many their economic reality has changed 
overnight. 
People need to get tested. Quarantined 
workers are wondering how they will pay their 
bills. Healthcare workers are putting their own 
health at risk. And children are missing their 
school lunches. 
They need help. 
They need help now. 
The coronavirus knows no border. It knows 
no political party. And Mr. Speaker, our re-
sponse shouldn’t either. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
today, I rise in support of the Families First 
Coronavirus Response Act, which will provide 
the crucial support for our workforce and 
economy amid the current public health emer-
gency associated with COVID–19. It is our 
duty to care for all members of our society, 
and this stimulus package will do so. We will 
ensure that hourly workers and families have 
access to emergency paid sick leave, food se-
curity, and—most importantly—free testing for 
corona virus regardless of insurance status. 
For families’ economic security, we have se-
cured paid emergency leave, with two weeks 
of paid sick leave and up to three months of 
paid family and medical leave. We have also 
secured enhanced Unemployment Insurance, 
a step that will extend protections to fur-
loughed workers. 
For 
families’ 
food 
security, 
we 
have 
strengthened nutrition security initiatives, in-
cluding SNAP, student meals, seniors’ nutri-
tion and food banks. For the twenty-two million 
children who rely on free or reduced-price 
school meals for their food security, we must 
ensure that they have food to eat. 
For families’ health security, we have in-
creased federal funds for Medicaid to support 
our local, state, tribal and territorial govern-
ments and health systems, so that they have 
the resources necessary to combat the 
coronavirus. 
As representatives of Americans from all 
corners of our country, we have a responsi-
bility to protect the health and well-being of 
our communities in times of crisis. I urge my 
colleagues to support the Families First 
Coronavirus Response Act. 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
strongly support this bill. 
As Chairman of the Agriculture, Rural De-
velopment, and FDA Subcommittee of Appro-
priations, I want to acknowledge the tremen-
dous cooperation between the Appropriations 
and authorizing committees in producing this 
bill so quickly. 
It takes a truly multi-jurisdictional approach 
to addressing the urgent needs, many families 
will have, as we face this pandemic. 
[The fight against this scourge will be tough 
and we must be prepared.] 
Last week we provided $61 million to FDA 
for the development and review of medical 
countermeasures, devices, therapies, and vac-
cines to combat the coronavirus. 
Today, we work to protect our families. 
Cancellation of conferences, sporting events 
and other gatherings is having a major impact 
on the hospitality, transportation, and related 
industries, resulting in layoffs that will likely 
cause families to turn to WIC and food banks 
for help. 
Schools are closing, leaving children without 
free and reduced-price meals.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1689 
March 13, 2020 
But I am pleased this bill would allow 
households with eligible children to receive 
emergency SNAP assistance to put food on 
the table. 
Three programs get additional funds in this 
bill. 
First, we provide $500 million for WIC to 
provide nutritious foods for low-income preg-
nant women or mothers with young children 
who lose their jobs or are laid off due to the 
coronavirus emergency. 
Second, we provide $400 million for The 
Emergency 
Food 
Assistance 
Program— 
TEFAP—to help local food banks meet in-
creased demand during the emergency. 
Third, we provide $100 million for Nutrition 
Assistance for the U.S. Territories. Puerto 
Rico, American Samoa, and the Northern Mar-
iana Islands rely on Congress to block grant 
their SNAP funds in an emergency and these 
funds will support their pandemic response. 
Thanks to the Chairs and staffs of the Ap-
propriations and authorizing committees who 
worked so hard over the last 72 hours on this 
bill. It will bring relief, consolation, and hope-
fully food security to our constituents. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the 
spread of COVID–19 will present increasingly 
severe challenges for students, workers, and 
families. Communities across the country are 
counting on this Congress to deliver a bold, 
immediate, and targeted response. 
The Families First Coronavirus Response 
Act—which is the result of careful bipartisan 
negotiations—is an important step toward pro-
viding the American people the support they 
need to confront this national emergency. 
This bill ensures that all Americans can ac-
cess cost-free COVID–19 testing. 
It provides states and schools the flexibility 
they need to ensure that students do not go 
hungry during school closures. It also provides 
child and adult care providers additional sup-
port to make sure people are getting the nutri-
tion they need. 
It provides women, infants, and children with 
the flexibility to access WIC food benefits and 
infant formula without the need to make un-
safe visits to clinics. 
It provides workers 14 days of emergency 
paid sick leave, so they are not forced to 
choose between their paycheck and their 
health. 
And it also provides enhanced unemploy-
ment compensation and paid family and med-
ical leave so that workers can take time off to 
care for themselves and their loved ones with-
out losing their jobs. 
By passing this legislation, we protect the 
health and financial security of millions of stu-
dents, workers, and families. 
But we must recognize that this package 
alone is not sufficient. In the coming weeks, 
we must be willing to take further action to ad-
dress the consequences of this epidemic. 
For example, I am particularly concerned 
that this bill does not include important safety 
protections for our front-line health care work-
ers, who will be called upon to perform heroic 
work in the months ahead. I will continue to 
work with my colleagues to pass necessary 
legislation to protect their safety. 
Additionally, at the last minute, provisions 
were inserted into the bill that regrettably de-
nied some workers paid leave benefits. But 
millions of workers will have access to paid 
leave that is not available to them today. 
So, I urge all Members to support the Fami-
lies First Coronavirus Response Act. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in strong support of the Families First 
Coronavirus Response Act which is designed 
to put families first, protect and stabilize our 
economy, and provide Americans with assur-
ance that this House has their needs and in-
terests at the top of our priority concerns. 
I support this measure because—during this 
period of uncertainty—it helps provide critical 
paid sick and family leave for workers affected 
by this public health crisis. 
Approximately 80 million workers aged 16 
and older are paid hourly, which means they 
typically lack paid sick and family leave. 
Around 75 percent of workers live paycheck 
to paycheck. 
These benefits will help cover employees 
who are sick, quarantined, or caring for loved 
ones who must remain at home. 
If a worker is furloughed, laid off, or ex-
hausts their paid leave, it provides enhanced 
unemployment benefits and flexibility in eligi-
bility requirements to help. 
The bill provides free testing to determine 
who is affected. 
It provides substantial dollars to nutrition for 
low-income 
individuals—including 
pregnant 
women, mothers with young children, food 
banks, students receiving free and reduced 
lunch whose schools have closed, and sen-
iors. 
It safeguards Medicare benefits and pay-
ments, protects frontline health care workers, 
and directs special attention to the hardest hit 
communities. 
I am pleased to support this bill because it 
is an important step by our country’s leaders 
to say to the American people that we’ve got 
your back. We are not done. This House will 
take further action when needed to help our 
residents weather this crisis. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the bill. The American people are 
rightly concerned about coronavirus, and as a 
Congress, we have a responsibility to help 
them deal with this crisis. Many Americans— 
sick or not—will need to stay home from work. 
Many will need access to testing and care. 
Our state and local health care providers and 
first responders are on the front lines of this 
fight. We’re all in this together. That’s how I’m 
thinking about it as a citizen—for my family— 
and as United States Congressman working 
for you, for Oregon, and for our nation. 
Last week, we approved over $8 billion to 
get more tests out into our communities, reim-
burse local entities for the work they are 
doing, and to find a vaccine and treatments. 
We need to do more, and that’s what we will 
do today. 
By working together, our efforts will leave 
our country better prepared to address this cri-
sis. But I must note that more could have 
been done. 
First, we all know hospitals across the na-
tion are preparing to treat a surge of patients 
and health care providers are already running 
low on crucial respirator masks. We need to 
make more of these masks available to pro-
tect our health workers who are on the front 
lines of this pandemic. By making common-
sense changes to the PREP Act, we could 
boost the availability and supply of critically 
needed respirators. This is a missed oppor-
tunity, but I’m going to keep pushing. We need 
to get these crucial pieces of protective equip-
ment out to communities who need them 
most. 
Second, our front-line needs reinforcements. 
We currently have provider shortages; to win 
this next stage of the fight we must maintain 
sufficient hospital staffing. Dr. Burgess and 
Representative ESHOO have a bipartisan bill 
that would improve the ‘‘Ready Reserve’’ of 
the United States Public Health Service Com-
missioned Corps. The ‘‘Ready Reserve’s’’ pur-
pose is to fulfill the need for additional per-
sonnel on short notice for public health and 
emergency response. We must improve the 
surge capacity of our health care workforce. 
Why this was left out is maddening; it makes 
no sense. 
Of course, we all know there will be more 
work to do in the coming weeks. We must get 
ready. We need to turn our attention to our 
medical product supply chain—both for this 
pandemic and future ones. 
For me, this is not a new concern, prior to 
the coronavirus outbreak, I’ve raised concern 
about our country’s overreliance on foreign 
pharmaceutical manufacturing. If a country 
monopolizes the production of a drug and 
wishes to retaliate against the U.S., they could 
substantially increase drug prices or reduce 
supply in an attempt to cause shortages, lim-
iting access to critical medications. This could 
put American lives at risk in a time of crisis. 
Finally, I still believe the Medicaid policies in 
the bill could have been designed more effec-
tively and better-targeted to the immediate 
challenge presented by COVID–19. With that 
said, states and localities are on the front lines 
and this enhanced funding will help states im-
mediately address public health needs as well 
as handle an expected surge in new patients. 
Even with these concerns, I do rise in sup-
port of the bill because we need to make sure 
people can get tested, help those who have to 
stay home from work and their families, and 
ensure our health professionals have the sup-
port they need from the federal government. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. To 
the American people, our country is strong. 
Our economy is resilient. Do not panic but be 
smart and vigilant and we can overcome this 
challenge. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong 
support 
of 
the 
Families 
First 
Coronavirus Response Act. 
I want to thank our Speaker for her remark-
able and steady leadership, our entire leader-
ship team, the committee chairs, and our Ap-
propriations Chair, Nita Lowey who helped to 
craft this package. 
We must boldly fight this pandemic with all 
the science-based tools and resources we 
have. And we must put families first. 
The bill before us does exactly that by: 
Providing free coronavirus testing for every-
one who needs it, 
Establishing an emergency paid leave pro-
gram, 
Enhancing state unemployment benefits, 
Strengthening food assistance programs for 
seniors and school kids. 
I urge all members to support this critical 
legislation to help address the needs of fami-
lies across this nation facing the impact of this 
pandemic. 
Lastly, I want to thank the Governor, State 
Officials, our Mayor, Local Officials, Port of 
Oakland, our workers, Federal Partners, and 
our residents who have pulled together so that 
public health protocols were put in place to 
ensure the health and safety of everyone in-
cluding the West Oakland community.

The West Oakland community has been sig-
nificant challenged by environmental racism 
and injustice in the past. I am proud of the 
community their compassion and competence 
and for stepping up during these challenging 
times. 
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, as we respond to 
the Coronavirus pandemic, it’s crucial that we 
don’t forget the 22 million children who rely on 
free or reduced-priced school lunches. 
For many kids, it is the only meal they get 
each day. It is our responsibility to ensure that 
kids continue to get the meals they need. 
I’m proud that the package the House is 
passing today includes my legislation—the 
Maintaining Essential Access to Lunch for Stu-
dents Act. 
My bill gives schools that are forced to close 
during a public health emergency the flexibility 
to implement alternate options—like home de-
livery of meals—in order to ensure their stu-
dents are fed. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this bill 
and ensure that no child goes hungry due to 
school closures in times of crisis. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in strong support of H.R. 6201, the 
Families First Coronavirus Response Act of 
2020, which provides much needed protec-
tions for American families from the worst con-
ditions that might arise as the nation fights the 
spread of COVID–19. 
My thoughts and prayers are with the fami-
lies who have lost loved ones and the thou-
sand who are sick, and the many others who 
will struggle with the effects of COVID–19 over 
the coming days, weeks, and months. 
We owe a special debt to First Responders 
who will be the lifeline for those who will need 
medical care to overcome this coronavirus 
designated as COVID–19. 
The legislation includes: 
Health Care Worker Protections; 
Emergency Paid Leave; 
Emergency Unemployment Insurance; and 
Paid Sick Days for Public Health Emer-
gencies and Personal and Family Care. 
This bill provides immediate help to Amer-
ican families that are now on the frontline of 
this fight to defeat COVID–19. 
Yesterday, the World Health Organization 
declared COVID–19 a pandemic, which has 
reached at least 114 countries, sickening over 
139,000 people, and killing more than 5,116 
worldwide. 
The first presumptive COVID–19 positive 
case was reported in the Houston area oc-
curred in Montgomery County, Texas, which 
borders Harris County, the location of Hous-
ton, Texas. 
Montgomery County, Texas officials con-
firmed that the man has not traveled out of the 
state or country recently. 
Currently, the 20 people he had been in 
close contact with are in self-quarantine. 
If the case is confirmed by the CDC, this 
could be the first community-spread case in 
the Houston area. 
Community-spread occurring is the reason 
why we need tests in enough supply that ev-
eryone can be tested so that we know the 
state of COVID–19 in each community. 
While the Houston area has other cases 
that are linked to travel outside of the state, 
this is the first case not linked to travel outside 
of the state. 
The Montgomery County, Texas Public 
Health officials took steps to protect children 
by closing schools two days before spring 
break to do a deep clean, and they are ex-
pecting to resume classes after the break. 
The person is being treated at an undis-
closed hospital and is reported to be under 
observation and doing well. 
COVID–19 is more contagious than the flu. 
The contagious score is 1.5 and COVID–19 
is 2.3. 
Although symptoms are compared to the flu, 
COVID–19 is not the flu. 
Because there is no immunity, vaccine, or 
widely agreed upon treatment there are only a 
few options for protecting the public and lim-
iting its spread. 
This is a time in our nation that historians 
will write about and anthropologists will study, 
but for us—living today—we are in a fight 
against a foe that we have never faced before, 
but we must defeat. 
The army before us are our medical re-
searchers, doctors, nurses, first responders, 
and sanitation workers, but they cannot defeat 
this enemy alone. 
Each of us, not just in the United States but 
around the world must join the fight by paying 
attention to facts and not spread rumors. 
The weapons for slowing the spread of 
COVID–19 are simple and they work: 
Washing hands; 
Sanitizing surfaces; 
Social Distance; 
Isolation; and 
Quarantines. 
These tools for controlling the spread of in-
fectious diseases are as old as civilization and 
are still used today because they work. 
Some of the first records of the use of 
cleaning, washing, and isolation of the sick 
and those thought to be ill is found in the Bible 
in the Book of Leviticus Chapter 13. 
It provides detailed instructions to the com-
munity about leprosy, a dreaded contagious 
disease. 
To defeat COVID–19, we must practice 
hand washing, social distance, isolation, and 
quarantine. 
Hand washing sounds simple but it involves 
much more attention and time to do it right— 
and remove germs. 
To get accurate instructions on what is 
needed to know visit https://coronavirus.gov, 
where information can be found on cleaning 
and personal care. 
Social distance means limiting physical con-
tact and having at least six feet separating 
persons while in public spaces. 
Social distance practices can include not 
shaking hands, or touching surfaces where the 
virus can be picked up. 
Social distance can also involve limiting the 
number of people who may be in an enclosed 
space. 
Isolation for at least 14 days is for persons 
who may have been in contact with a person 
who tests positive for COVID–19. 
Quarantine is for persons who are sus-
pected of having COVID–19 or tested positive 
for having COVID–19. 
Given the fluid nature of the events unfold-
ing each person should be informed and ready 
to support efforts to prevent or slow the 
spread of the illness. 
The National Institutes of Health, the CDC, 
university researchers, and private companies 
are working on a vaccine, which will take a 
year to produce in enough quantities to inocu-
late people from becoming infected with 
COVID–19. 
In the meantime, we must do all that we can 
to protect the elderly; those with serious pre- 
existing health conditions, and our health care 
workers from contracting COVID–19. 
I believe that we must do more to prepare 
the public for what may be localized, house-
hold, or individual quarantines to address the 
spread of COVID–19. 
We must vastly increase the number of 
tests and make sure that everyone presenting 
with mild cold or flu like symptoms is tested to 
accurately gauge the spread of COVID–19 in 
communities. 
I saw news reports in early January on the 
novel Coronavirus’s rapid spread and the 
numbers of infected expanding so quickly, I 
knew this was not something to be taken light-
ly and that time was not on our side to mount 
an effective defense. 
On February 10, 2020, I held the first press 
conference 
on 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
novel 
coronavirus at Houston Intercontinental Air-
port. 
I was joined by public health officials, local 
unions, and advocates to raise awareness re-
garding the virus and the implications it might 
have for travel to the United States from China 
and to combat early signs of discrimination 
targeting Asian businesses in the United 
States. 
On February 24, 2020, I held a second 
press conference on the International Health 
Regulations Emergency Committee of the 
World Health Organization declaration of a 
‘‘public health emergency from the outbreak of 
the Coronavirus.’’ 
At that time, I formally requested the Presi-
dent of the United States by letter to imme-
diately suspend any health-related cuts that 
impact efforts to contain and treat the 
coronavirus, including the $3.3 billion in cuts 
to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and 
the discretionary budget cuts for the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of 
nearly 19 percent at $678 million, severely 
threatening the CDC’s ability to respond to this 
and other epidemics in the future. 
Additionally, I requested the President to 
suspend cuts in both the Medicare and Med-
icaid programs. 
On February 26, 2020, I sent a letter to the 
Chair and Ranking Member of the Committee 
on Homeland Security seeking a meeting with 
Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad 
Wolf to gain insight into the Preparedness of 
the Agency to address a possible pandemic. 
On February 28, 2020, I spoke on the Floor 
of the House and announced plans to form a 
Congressional Coronavirus Task Force. 
I thank Congressmen BRIAN FITZPATRICK 
and Dr. RAUL RUIZ for joining me as co-chairs 
of the Congressional Coronavirus Task Force. 
Today, March 13, 2020, the House of Rep-
resentatives is offering additional tools to help 
the American public during this crisis, the sec-
ond relief package in less than a week. 
I want to impress upon the American people 
that if they have not been paying attention to 
the issue of the virus, they need to stop and 
learn all that they can. 
First, do not panic—get informed with facts 
by visiting https://coronavirus.gov, this website 
is maintained by the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (https://cdc.gov). 
They must prepare for what is coming—if it 
has not officially arrived in their community— 
do not assume that it will not make its pres-
ence known.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1691 
March 13, 2020 
The earlier bill provided $8.3 billion in fund-
ing in emergency supplemental appropriations, 
which included: 
More than $3 billion for research and devel-
opment 
of 
vaccines, 
therapeutics, 
and 
diagnostics; 
$2.2 billion in public health funding for pre-
vention, preparedness, and response, $950 
million of which is to support state and local 
health agencies; 
Nearly $1 billion for procurement of pharma-
ceuticals and medical supplies, to support 
healthcare 
preparedness 
and 
Community 
Health Centers, and to improve medical surge 
capacity; 
$435 million to support health systems over-
seas to prevent, prepare, and respond to the 
coronavirus; 
$300 million to respond to humanitarian 
needs; 
$61 million to facilitate the development and 
review of medical countermeasures, devices, 
therapies, and vaccines, and to help mitigate 
potential supply chain interruptions; and 
Allows for an estimated $7 billion in low-in-
terest loans to affected small businesses. 
On, Thursday, March 12, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) re-
ported the coronavirus outbreak has now in-
fected more than 1,000 people in nearly 40 
U.S. states—and the country’s top authority on 
infectious diseases reports that things will only 
get worse. 
The World Health Organization reports a 3.4 
percent mortality rate for COVID–19. 
The challenge with this new coronavirus is 
that it is highly contagious, and of those in-
fected, 15–20 percent contract pneumonia 
And 5 percent of these cases may develop 
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), 
which is a rapidly progressive disease occur-
ring in critically ill patients. 
The main complication in ARDS is that fluid 
leaks into the lungs making breathing difficult 
or impossible. 
This virus is a serious public health threat, 
but this does not mean that we should have 
a public health panic. 
There are knowledgeable and trained virol-
ogists, public health experts, and physicians 
who need the funding provided by this bill. 
I ask that my colleagues join me in voting in 
support of H.R. 6201. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
LOWEY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6201, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, on that

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the House 
has now spoken in a clear voice and ap-
proved this bipartisan bill. If there are 
any developments that would require 
Members to return before our sched-
uled return date of March 23, 24 hours’ 
notice will be provided. 
I want to thank all Members for their 
patience as leaders on both sides 
worked 
hard 
to 
negotiate 
the 
coronavirus response legislation the 
House has now adopted. Much remains 
to be done, but we have done good work 
last week on behalf of the American 
people and good work this week on be-
half of the American people.

tions and conforming changes to the

Commerce be discharged from further

extend the chemical facility anti-ter-

HONORING RUBY ANN WHITTLE 
SMITH ON HER 100TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Ruby Ann Whittle 
Smith on the occasion of her 100th 
birthday. 
Ms. Smith has been a district resi-
dent for 95 years. She was born in 
South Hill, Virginia, on March 15, 1920, 
and moved to Orange, New Jersey, 5 
years later. 
Ms. Smith graduated from Orange 
High School and later the New York 
Institute of Dietetics. She started her 
career as a hospital dietician and 
worked at Community Hospital in 
Newark, New Jersey, then she spent 30 
years as a clerk at Western Electric. 
But she is known and loved for her 
passions: her dedication to New Hope 
Baptist Church in East Orange, her en-
joyment of Denzel Washington movies, 
and her love of peppermints and bingo. 
Happy birthday to Ruby Ann Whittle 
Smith. She is truly 100 years young.

NO WAY TO HANDLE BILLIONS OF 
DOLLARS 
(Mr. GOHMERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is 
quite sad that something this impor-
tant had this kind of procedure. 
Now, I got a bill at around 9 o’clock 
or so. I was told it was the most recent 
draft. I read through that, and I got 
through it in time to have a number of 
questions highlighted, tagged. 
I wasn’t able—my staff was trying— 
to get a copy of the bill we were going 
to vote on. I got it right before the 
buzzer goes off that we are going to 
have a vote in 15 minutes. 
This is no way to handle something 
so important. Part of my problem, my 
concerns and questions I couldn’t get 
answered: Is this going to put some 
people out of business? I get over here, 
and people hadn’t read it, so they can’t 
answer my questions. 
This is no way to handle billions and 
billions of dollars when we are trying 
to help people, and we don’t even know 
whether we will help them or hurt 
them. 
f 
TOGETHER, OUR COUNTRY WILL 
SURVIVE CORONAVIRUS 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Mr. Speaker, the 
hour is late, but I wanted to rise to 
speak to my constituents. 
We are facing a novel illness in the 
coronavirus. I know that many are 
feeling nervous and uncertain with this 
type of disease, but I want to remind 
my community in northern Illinois 
that we have some tools at our dis-
posal, commonsense solutions, like 
making sure to wash our hands and use 
hand sanitizer, to sanitize frequently 
touched surfaces, and to refrain from 
touching our faces. But we also need to 
make sure that we are extending com-
mon courtesies, kindness, and respect 
to our neighbors. 
If you are feeling sick, stay home. If 
you are really feeling sick, please call 
ahead to your healthcare provider so 
that they can be ready to accommo-
date you. 
Together, our country will survive 
the coronavirus and make it through 
this challenging time. 
f 
VOTING TO SAVE LIVES 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as 
I stand before the words ‘‘In God We 
Trust,’’ tonight we took a vote to save 
the lives of our fellow Americans. 
I am very glad that what we did 
today was for families, healthcare 
worker protections, emergency paid 
leave, emergency unemployment insur-
ance, paid sick days for public health 
emergencies, and personal and family 
care. 
I will go home to my district and 
convene meetings regarding those who 
are dealing with education, healthcare, 
and testing, but the main thing that we 
must do is test every single American 
who is showing signs or needs. 
What we have in this bill is to pro-
vide free testing. In addition, we have 
organized the bipartisan Congressional 
Coronavirus Task Force. We are doing 
that to engage with Members as they 
are away in their districts. 
This is more contagious than the flu 
and more deadly. 
Let us be assured that we take care 
of the American people. I intend to do 
so in my State of Texas and intend to 
make sure that resources go to save 
lives. 
In God we trust.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE, LEGACY, 
AND 
MEMORY 
OF 
PATRICIA 
‘‘TRISH’’ BERRY-BELL 
HON. SUZAN K. DelBENE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Patricia ‘‘Trish’’ Berry-Bell, a treas-
ured friend and constituent, who passed away 
peacefully on January 19, 2020 after a coura-
geous battle with glioblastoma. Trish was a re-
tired registered nurse. She began her career 
at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago 
in the Neuro-Intensive Care Unit. After moving 
to Washington in 1983, she became a staple 
of our health care community. She first worked 
as an ICU nurse, then later in Recovery and 
Research, at the University of Washington 
Medical Center. Though she retired in 2016, 
she certainly did not remove herself from the 
health care world. Trish was a strong advo-
cate for both nurses and patients during her 
career and after her retirement. 
Trish was a jack-of-all-trades, receiving a 
degree in fashion design in addition to her de-
gree in nursing. She exemplified the strong 
sense of community Washington is known for 
in so many aspects of her life, and any of us 
could count on her to be the first to step up 
if we needed help. Trish was loyal (a member 
of the same book club for twenty-seven 
years), loving, caring (my daughter’s god-
mother), and was known for her quick wit and 
sense of humor. Her favorite holiday was St. 
Patrick’s Day when we would gather at her 
house for a corned beef dinner. She was eas-
ily recognizable from her flaming red hair and 
her clear zest for life. I know her husband 
John, daughters Caitlin and Maeve, son-in-law 
John and all of us whose lives were better be-
cause we knew her will keep her memory 
alive. My family and I will miss her dearly.

RICK ENGLER 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and commend Washington, 
District of Columbia resident, Mr. Rick Engler, 
for his retirement from the Chemical Safety 
Board. 
In February of 2020, Mr. Rick Engler retired 
from his position on the Chemical Safety and 
Hazard Investigation Board, a position he held 
since President Barack Obama nominated him 
in January of 2014 and was confirmed by the 
United States Senate in December 2014. 
Prior to his appointment to the United States 
Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation 
Board, Mr. Engler spent more than four dec-
ades helping to prevent chemical hazards. Mr. 
Engler advocated for New Jersey Worker and 
Community Right to Know and Toxic Catas-
trophe laws that increased government trans-
parency and the public’s ‘‘right to know’’ about 
potential chemical dangers they may have 
been exposed to on the job and in the com-
munity. 
Moreover, he advocated for national 1990 
Clean Air Act amendments which enabled 
workers and management representatives to 
fully participate during Environmental Protec-
tion Agency and Chemical Safety Board inves-
tigations of facilities that use highly hazardous 
chemicals. He also advocated for several state 
and federal public policies that promote haz-
ard communication, workforce development, 
chemical incident prevention, inherently safer 
processes, and whistleblower protection. 
Mr. Engler has consistently been a leader in 
collaborative 
labor-management-community 
initiatives to help investigate and prevent 
chemical incidents. Among Rick’s accomplish-
ments and contributions during his tenure in-
clude his role as the Director of the New Jer-
sey Work Environment Council, his founding 
of the Philadelphia Area Project on Occupa-
tional Safety and Health, his service as an 
elected Vice President of the New Jersey In-
dustrial Union Council, AFL–CIO, as well as 
his service on the New Jersey Department of 
Health Occupational Health Surveillance Advi-
sory Committee. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring Mr. Rick Engler, a dedicated public 
servant who has fought tirelessly for the safety 
of our communities and of all workers.

HONORING WRESTLING CHAMPION 
HEAVEN FITCH 
HON. MARK WALKER 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Mr. WALKER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Heaven Fitch on winning the 
wrestling state championship for North Caro-
lina’s 106-pound weight class. Competing 
against all boys, Heaven’s win makes her the 
first female athlete in North Carolina to win a 
wrestling state championship. 
She and her three brothers first became in-
terested with wrestling at an early age after 
watching the sport on television. When Heav-
en and her brothers joined the local wrestling 
club, she was the only girl. Heaven wrestled 
wherever she could, often practicing up to five 
days a week. Despite being smaller than al-
most all her high school opponents, Heaven’s 
agility and speed has led her to dominate on 
the mat finishing the season with a 54–4 
record. Heaven currently goes to Uwharrie 
Charter Academy in Asheboro, North Carolina, 
where she has gotten support from her class-
mates, teammates, coaches and parents Ryan 
and Stacey. 
Each March, we come together to celebrate 
women who have broken barriers, defied 
stereotypes, and contributed to our country’s 
history. While we recognize trailblazing women 
over the course of history, it is our great honor 
to recognize women making history today in 
our backyards. 
Congratulations to Heaven for all her ac-
complishments and serving as an inspiration 
to girls across the country.

IN HONOR OF THE SAN CARLOS 
CHICKEN’S BALL 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 80th anniversary of a San 
Carlos school fundraiser known as the Chick-
en’s Ball. The name is taken from a tradition 
of San Francisco’s Barbary Coast when local 
music halls would hold an annual charity fund-
raiser. Chorus performers wore costumes with 
a lot of feathers, hence the name Chicken’s 
Ball. 
The first ball in San Carlos was held in 1940 
and it was organized by Howard J. Demeke, 
a teacher at Central School. The money bene-
fited the PTA milk fund. Its stated purpose 
was to build the ‘‘unification of a lasting com-
munity fellowship.’’ Every two years since, 
shows have been produced, including this one 
in March of 2020. 
Approximately 250 volunteers and business 
sponsors produce the ball every two years. It 
is an ‘‘all-consuming effort,’’ to quote a local 
historian, Linda Garvey, and may be the long-
est running PTA fundraiser in the country. The 
show features three melodramas and three 
variety skits based on people and events of 
the Barbary Coast era of 1890 to 1918. Since 
the 1940’s, more than 60 PTA and civic 
groups have contributed original skit ideas. 
Music is provided by the Poultry (Paltry) Phil-
harmonic. 
Humor and the unexpected are a big part of 
the charm of the Chicken’s Ball. While skit 
writers often produce shows with great laughs, 
some of the best moments come when the 
lines are forgotten and actors ad lib to get 
over an awkward moment. 
Watching community members in novel 
parts is also fun. Children in the audience love 
seeing siblings and friends on stage, particu-
larly if the part calls for a child to boss around 
an adult. A lot of the fun comes from the 
imaginative sets, all locally produced by skilled 
residents. 
Performers range in age from 14–94. Sing-
ers, dancers, choreographers, designers, writ-
ers and stage crew are all volunteers and ac-
cepted regardless of talent. The theme of the 
2020 Chicken’s Ball is ‘‘The Night They In-
vented Champagne.’’ The year’s show opens 
on March 13th and runs through March 22nd. 
This is a chance for San Carlos, a small 
town with a great deal of talent and charm, to 
come together for several months of skit de-
velopment, costume design, set construction,

rehearsals, and finally theatrical production. I 
want to extend my congratulations to all who 
make this event possible. San Carlos is a spe-
cial place where humor, a love of education, 
and copious amounts of talent combine to 
produce a beloved community tradition. Every 
two years San Carlos lights up the stage to 
support its schools. Learning to celebrate as a 
community of Americans is also a profound 
act of education. I wish this year’s Chicken’s 
Ball a spectacular season.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
HAMILTON 
COUNTY 
ENGINEER 
TED HUBBARD 
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Hamilton County Engineer Ted Hub-
bard for his 38 years of service at the county 
engineer’s office and congratulate him on his 
recent retirement. 
Ted is a graduate of the University of Cin-
cinnati who has committed his career to en-
hancing Southwest Ohio. He holds deeply the 
belief that honest public service is key to 
bettering civil society. Mr. Hubbard is right; our 
republic is built on the hard work and service 
of devoted men and women. Ted Hubbard is 
one such public servant. 
Ted’s tenure at the Hamilton County engi-
neer’s office was marked by a keen ability to 
forge relationships with the people, groups, 
and governments around him. Throughout his 
time at the office, whether as a design engi-
neer, in permitting and construction, or as a 
deputy engineer, Ted had a positive impact on 
Hamilton County. Ted’s leadership on projects 
such as Colerain Ave, Montgomery Ave, 
Fields-Ertel Road, Winton Road, and the 
Cross County Highway will benefit our com-
munity for years to come. 
I wish Ted the best as he moves on to a 
new chapter of his life and thank him for his 
service. 
May God bless Ted and his family.

HONORING KERISA BAEDKE AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Kerisa Baedke, teacher and ed-
ucator at Prairieview School in Waukee, as 
this week’s Iowan of the Week. 
Kerisa is a foreign language teacher at 
Prairieview School in Waukee, Iowa. In her 
Spanish classes, she has built an immersive, 
vibrant environment in which her students feel 
comfortable and confident learning a new lan-
guage. By combining a bright, colorful array of 
decorations with interactive lessons—taught 
almost entirely in Spanish—Kerisa brings a 
world of art, culture, and history to Prairieview 
School. 
Kerisa has a passion for teaching foreign 
languages and promoting different cultural ex-
periences in her classes. Her whole family 
speaks three or four languages, she says, and 
it’s where she first discovered love and pas-
sion for language. She also comes from a 
family of educators; her parents both dedi-
cated themselves to teaching. Kerisa said she 
was born to be a teacher and couldn’t imagine 
doing anything else. 
Prairieview School students look forward to 
Mrs. Baedke’s class each year, including her 
well-known 
projects 
like 
creative 
cultural 
dances or the ‘‘Dia de los Muertos’’ shoebox. 
Kerisa has made a lasting impression on her 
students, cultivating a passion for language 
and for learning. In fact, it was one of her stu-
dents that nominated her for the Iowa State 
Education Association’s Excellence in Edu-
cation Award—and Kerisa won. 
The accolades don’t stop there. I am proud 
to say that Kerisa was also awarded with the 
National Education Association’s Horace Mann 
Award. This prestigious national honor is 
awarded to only five teachers each year for 
their outstanding contributions to their students 
and to the teaching profession. Kerisa is the 
first ever teacher from Iowa to receive the 
Horace Mann Award, and I know the entirely 
Prairieview School community is delighted by 
her achievement. 
As a mom, I know that education is the sin-
gle most important investment we can make in 
our children. I am proud to know that our chil-
dren have teachers like Kerisa helping them 
learn and grow. It is her commitment to cre-
ating an engaging, nurturing, and most impor-
tantly exciting environment for students to 
learn that makes her a pillar of our community. 
It is my honor to celebrate Kerisa Baedke and 
recognize her as the Iowan of the Week.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DANIEL 
(DAN) DILL 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Daniel Dill, who passed 
away on September 17, 2019 at the age of 48 
after a lifetime of public service to his commu-
nity. 
Born on June 11, 1971, to Danny and 
Grace Dill, Dan attended Fortuna High School, 
then studied wildlife management at Humboldt 
State University. After graduating, Dan worked 
for the Pacific Lumber Co., where he became 
a senior wildlife biologist in 1995. In 2008, he 
went to work as a wildlife biologist at Six Riv-
ers National Forest, and he was named dep-
uty district ranger for the Orleans/Ukonom 
Ranger District in 2012. He then became dis-
trict ranger for the Mad River Ranger District 
in 2015. Dan also was a member of the Scotia 
and Fortuna volunteer fire departments, and 
the Scotia School Board. 
Dan’s commitment to the U.S. Forest Serv-
ice and the communities it serves was particu-
larly apparent during the 2015 wildfires on Six 
Rivers National Forest where he displayed tre-
mendous leadership. Recognized for being in 
tune with residents’ needs during and fol-
lowing the fires, he worked diligently to ad-
dress critical forest fuels management and 
restoration projects in the area. Dan knew how 
to bring diverse groups of people together to 
bring these efforts to fruition. Even during try-
ing times, Dan remained a cheerful and under-
standing individual focused on doing good 
work for the forest and the people who live in 
it. 
Dan is survived by his wife Dawn, his 
daughters Emily and Ava, his parents Danny 
and Grace, and his brother Brett. His tremen-
dous service to the country through his work 
in the U.S. Forest Service is a legacy that will 
improve the Six Rivers National Forest for 
generations to come. Madam Speaker, please 
join me in honoring Daniel Dill and his many 
important contributions to Northern California 
and the U.S. Forest Service.

RECOGNIZING THE REMARKS OF 
AMBASSADOR MARTHA BA´ RCENA 
HON. HENRY CUELLAR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to include in the RECORD remarks made 
by Her Excellency, Martha Ba´rcena Coqui 
after she was recognized for the prestigious 
Mr. South Texas Award for the 123rd Wash-
ington’s Birthday Celebration on February 
22nd, 2020 in Laredo, Texas. The Mr. South 
Texas designation is presented to a deserving 
individual who has made a significant and last-
ing contribution to the growth and develop-
ment of Laredo and the South Texas region. 
Ambassador Ba´rcena is a distinguished career 
diplomat and noted for being the first woman 
appointed Ambassador of Mexico to the 
United States. 
AMBASSADOR MARTHA BA´ RCENA’S REMARKS AT 
MR. SOUTH TEXAS LUNCHEON 
I am humbled and honored to receive this 
recognition that showcases the closeness of 
our ties at a very important time. 
I want to thank the Washington’s Birthday 
Celebration 
Association 
and 
the 
Inter-
national Bank of Commerce for putting to-
gether this great event. 
I also want to thank Mayor of Laredo, Pete 
Saenz, the officials that work at the City of 
Laredo and the rest of the business commu-
nity leaders and special guests that join us 
here today. 
American writer James Baldwin used to 
say that ‘‘the past is all that makes the 
present coherent’’. Today, I believe that the 
present of Laredo and the U.S. cannot be un-
derstood without its shared history with 
Mexico. 
Texas is close to us because its history is 
closely intertwined with Mexico and with 
Mexican and Latino immigrants in this 
country. 
As the first female Ambassador of Mexico 
to the U.S., I have proudly repeated that the 
Latino community, and among them, the 
Mexican community, are the past, the 
present and the future of this country. 
In fact, my own personal story reflects the 
stories of millions that live on either side of 
the border but comprise one close-knit com-
munity. My grandmother’s ancestors arrived 
from Europe in the Mayflower and finally 
settled in Texas. They were what Emma Laz-
arus brilliantly described as the ‘‘huddled 
masses yearning to breathe free’’. 
My 
great 
great 
grandfather, 
Leonard 
Pierce Jr., from Maine, served as President 
Lincoln’s Consul in Matamoros, where he 
cared for the Confederate territory refugees 
and enlisted Union sympathizers. His family

finally settled in Laredo, where my grand-
father, a French immigrant, married Rachel 
Pierce Cushman. My grandmother, Claire 
Jannet Pierce was born here in 1904. The 
family migrated to Mexico later on, but 
other part of the family stayed here. 
That is why, the last time I was here I got 
to visit a school that bears the name of my 
great aunt, Alma Allerton Pierce Elemen-
tary. 
I can feel this sense of fellowship, sup-
ported 
by 
a 
binational, 
bilingual 
and 
bicultural community, that is so char-
acteristic of Laredo. 
Our border is one of the busiest and most 
frequently crossed international borders in 
the world, but it is way more than a customs 
and immigration checkpoint. 
When we talk about the border, we are also 
talking about us. We are talking about peo-
ple that move, that invest, that shop and 
that socialize across the boundary line. 
When we talk about the border we talk 
about ranchers, railroad builders, miners, in-
vestors and immigrants. We talk about thou-
sands of people who cross the border every 
single day in both directions to work, con-
duct business, attend school or get medical 
treatment. 
When I come to the border, I see an envi-
ronment of opportunity defined by social and 
commercial exchanges, and of common nat-
ural landscapes. I also see it as the symbol of 
our economic stature as a region. Together, 
the 10 Border States would constitute the 
world’s 4th largest economy. 
Dear friends: 
We are neighbors by geography, but part-
ners and allies by choice. In less than a cen-
tury, we transformed mistrust into a strong, 
collaborative and mutually beneficial rela-
tionship. 
Our special partnership has made us grow 
together and prosper together. Today, the 
great state of Texas has witnessed firsthand 
the benefits of the close trade with Mexico, 
twenty-eight years after NAFTA was signed 
here in San Antonio. 
Under NAFTA, exports from Texas to Mex-
ico increased 350%. In a striking comparison, 
Texas’ exports to Mexico are greater than all 
U.S. exports to Japan and India combined. 
Mexico is Texas main trading partner, its 
first export destination and its number one 
source of imports. 
Our bilateral trade rose to more than 200 
billion dollars in 2019 and there are almost 
half a million Texans whose jobs depend on 
trade with Mexico. 
Moving forward, we are confident that 
NAFTA successor, the US-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement, USMCA or TMEC, will be a stra-
tegic component for economic growth in 
North America and the ongoing creation of 
opportunities in cities like Laredo. 
With the passing of USMCA, we accom-
plished three additional objectives: 
(1) To support North America’s competi-
tiveness, with rules of origin that strengthen 
regional value chains 
(2) To increase trade and investments, and 
(3) To restore certainty and stability 
Now is the time for implementation and as 
Laredo is the main port for bilateral trade 
we have multiple challenges ahead, particu-
larly in the area of infrastructure and per-
sonnel for the port, to be able to grasp the 
opportunities that we have ahead of us. 
But when I talk about infrastructure is not 
only the ports of entry, it’s water sanitation, 
and it is also realizing that we share a com-
mon environment and discussing how are we 
going to deal with the challenges that a bor-
der wall will bring to that environment. 
We have shared this environment for cen-
turies, and this construction can change it 
permanently. This is something that we have 
to reflect on, because, above all, the wall 
will be a symbol that will separate us, while 
our rivers, our landscape and our bridges had 
united us. 
Dear all, 
Mexico is well aware that all of the oppor-
tunities that stand before us cannot be fully 
seized, and will not be fully seized, without a 
careful reconsideration of the difficulties 
that lie ahead. 
There is no silver bullet that will resolve 
all of our challenges overnight, but we are 
confident that we are moving in the right di-
rection. 
Today, the U.S.-Mexico relationship is at a 
crossroads, and the decisions that we take 
from now on will impact the direction of 
both our countries and the lives of millions 
of people. 
We have sensitive pending issues like mi-
gration, where reality requires that we see 
it, not as a national security problem, but as 
a phenomenon that can allow us to establish 
a link between demographic profiles and 
labor markets. 
We are convinced of the necessity of a con-
tinuous 
dialogue, 
especially 
on 
divisive 
issues, because as long as we remain neigh-
bors, American and Mexican futures will be 
intertwined. 
The role of cities like the two Laredos, its 
community and its values are key in this 
shared future. Thank you very much.

HONORING JUSTIN MITCHELL 
HON. JAMES COMER 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Justin Mitchell of Franklin-Simp-
son Middle School, located in Franklin, Ken-
tucky. As an 8th Grade Social Studies teach-
er, Justin received the American History 
Teacher of the Year Award from the Kentucky 
Society of the Daughters of the American Rev-
olution. 
This prestigious honor is a testament to the 
professionalism Justin demands of himself 
every day and a recognition of the great influ-
ence he has had and will continue to have 
within Franklin-Simpson Middle School. 
Active at the state level, working to push 
education into the future, Justin serves as the 
Vice Chair of the Education Professional 
Standards Board and the Assessment and Ac-
countability Council. He continues to organize 
enriching trips for students to Colonial Wil-
liamsburg, VA, and teach at Western Kentucky 
University’s Center for Gifted Studies. 
He has committed his career to working with 
community leaders to improve opportunities 
for the next generation and ushering in a 
brighter future for the Commonwealth. 
His impact on Simpson County, and public 
education, cannot be overstated. I’ve seen the 
great work Justin Mitchell has done, and join 
with all of my constituents in the 1st Congres-
sional District of Kentucky in congratulating 
him.

BIRTHDAY WISHES TO ROBERT E. 
HILL 
HON. MICHAEL GUEST 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to wish Mr. Robert E. Hill a happy 100th birth-
day and recognize his service to our nation as 
a citizen and veteran. After graduating from 
Paulett High School in Cooksville, Mississippi 
in 1939, Mr. Hill joined the United States 
Army. After completing Basic Training, Mr. Hill 
served our nation for over four years and saw 
service during World War II. Mr. Hill served his 
country honorably on the Italian Peninsula and 
was a part of the Rome-Arno, Northern 
Appennines, and Po Valley campaigns. At the 
end of his service, Mr. Hill held the rank of 
sergeant. On behalf of our country and state, 
I would like to thank Mr. Hill for his service to 
our great nation and wish him a happy birth-
day.

HONORING AMORY ‘‘AMO’’ 
HOUGHTON JR. 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, Amo 
Houghton was a dear friend and for many of 
us, probably the most respected member of 
Congress from either party. He was thoughtful, 
positive and constructive. When Congress was 
bitterly divided during the Newt Gingrich era, it 
seems almost quaint now, Amo stepped up to 
bring us together. He was always the voice for 
civility, thoughtful policy and bipartisanship be-
fore that became merely a talking point. 
Amo was a modest, quiet, unassuming gen-
tleman. You would never know that he was 
the only fortune 500 CEO to ever serve in 
Congress, coming from a distinguished family 
long successful in business, politics and phi-
lanthropy. Yet, he was unpretentious. He 
cared about good policy and more important 
than the institution, he cared about the people 
. . . members and staff. 
He was a thoughtful conservative who voted 
against gimmicks like a balanced-budget 
amendment despite its popularity with his Re-
publican colleagues. He was against the Iraq 
war when it had overwhelming support from 
not just the Bush administration and fellow Re-
publicans, but the majority of the American 
public. 
Amo was ahead of his time in so many 
ways. 
He was deeply concerned about the human 
dynamic. He didn’t just care about ‘‘people.’’ 
He cared about you. He was a strong sup-
porter of the ‘‘Faith and Politics’’ program and 
efforts at racial reconciliation. His was a 
unique voice. His positions would be almost 
unimaginable in today’s Congress, but anyone 
who knew Amo would respect him and more 
than a few would quietly agree with him. 
When I was first elected, I luckily moved 
into an office next to Amo’s. He helped this 
former freshman member in innumerable 
ways. His wife Priscilla was herself an amaz-
ing person: strong, thoughtful, understated, 
and civil. She was a dedicated bike rider and 
was cremated in her favorite dress, wearing a 
bike pin as did all the ushers at the funeral. 
Amo was a consistent voice for people in 
Congress to do the right thing. He and Pris-
cilla touched many of our lives and made us 
better people, His participation and example 
can, and should, live on in this Congress and 
beyond. His friends, family, neighbors, col-
leagues, and admirers share a profound sense

CELEBRATING THE 33RD ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
JAMES 
TATUM 
FOUNDATION 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
tribute to the James Tatum Foundation for the 
Arts on the occasion of its thirty third anniver-
sary. 
The James Tatum Foundation for The Arts 
was founded in 1987 by a coalition of con-
cerned educators and civic leaders who recog-
nized vast numbers of artistically talented 
young people in the Metropolitan Detroit area 
and the lack of opportunities to nurture that 
talent. Since then, the James Tatum Founda-
tion, under the leadership of James Tatum, a 
world-renowned jazz musician and educator, 
has carried out its mission to provide opportu-
nities to young artists to develop and display 
their talents. Furthermore, through its Youth 
Scholarship Program, the Foundation works to 
award young people with financial assistance 
to help attain performing art studies beyond 
high school. 
Over the years, the James Tatum Founda-
tion has blossomed into one of Detroit’s most 
distinguished nonprofit organizations, nurturing 
students with diverse talents by providing 
scholarships, mentoring and exposure. The 
Foundation has awarded hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars in performing arts scholar-
ships to graduating seniors who are advancing 
to some of the most prestigious colleges and 
universities, 
including 
Juilliard 
School 
of 
Music, New England Conservatory of Music, 
Curtis Music Institute, Yale University, Oberlin 
Music School, and the University of Michigan 
School of Music. 
Please join me in celebrating the thirty third 
anniversary of the James Tatum Foundation 
for the Performing Arts and the countless 
young people who have been able to pursue 
their dreams in the performing arts.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF MRS. 
VERLIA HOGGARD 
HON. STEVEN HORSFORD 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I ask 
that this body recognize the life of Mrs. Verlia 
Hoggard, who recently passed away. 
Ms. Hoggard dedicated her life to serving 
Las Vegas, and her consistent work to better 
the lives of those around her made her a fix-
ture in our community. 
As the former Director of Clark County So-
cial Services, she dedicated her career to so-
cial work, including spending 32 years as the 
Director of Welfare. 
Whereas most people may become bogged 
down after such a long career in social work— 
a notoriously tiring profession that asks so 
much of those in it—Ms. Hoggard remained 
focused on those she served, demonstrating 
her steadfast commitment and boundless 
dedication to her community. 
Additionally, she was active in many local, 
county, and state governments, as well as or-
ganizations including the NAACP, Clark Coun-
ty Library Board, Women’s Democratic Club, 
the Links, Incorporated, and Alpha Kappa 
Alpha Sorority. 
Even after her official work ended with her 
retirement in 2003, her involvement did not. 
She continued her longtime participation in 
various organizations, served on the Steward 
Board and Hospitality Committee. 
She also remained an active member of the 
First African Methodist Episcopal Church, 
serving her community through it as well. 
Beyond her work as a public official, Ms. 
Hoggard was known for her kind spirit, her 
selflessness, and her fortitude. Put simply, it 
was a privilege to know her. 
Las Vegas is lucky to have been the place 
that Ms. Hoggard called home and to have 
benefitted tremendously from her years of 
service. 
I am proud of the work my dear friend ac-
complished and honored to continue her leg-
acy of service—pushing forward with her con-
tributions alongside my colleagues in the Ne-
vada delegation here in the House of Rep-
resentatives, as well as those serving in the 
state and local governments back home.

2020 GIRL SCOUTS BIRTHDAY 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to honor Girl Scouts of the USA 
and its 108 years of building girls of courage, 
confidence, and character who make the world 
a better place. 
On March 12, 1912, Juliette Gordon Low 
founded the first Girl Scout troop with just 18 
girls. More than 100 years later, Girl Scouts is 
2.5 million strong—more than 1.7 million girls 
and 750,000 adults who believe in the power 
of every girl to change the world. 
By developing girls’ leadership potential— 
helping girls identify their passions, take the 
lead, and pursue their dreams—Girl Scouts 
has shaped generations of girls and women. 
Today, more than 50 million women are Girl 
Scout alums, including 57 percent of women 
currently serving in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and 69 percent in the U.S. Sen-
ate. 
Girl Scouts is committed to ensuring all girls 
develop to their full potential. The inclusive, 
all-female environment of a Girl Scout troop 
gives girls the change to try new things, de-
velop a range of skills, take on leadership 
roles, and just be themselves. Girl Scouts is 
proven to help girls thrive in five key ways, as 
they develop a strong sense of self; seek chal-
lenges and learn from setbacks; display posi-
tive values; form and maintain healthy relation-
ships; and identify and solve problems in the 
community. As we celebrate Girl Scouts’ 108th 
birthday, I applaud the Girl Scout councils that 
serve in my community for encouraging girls 
to dream big and do bigger to achieve their 
extraordinary goals. 
FEDERALLY REQUIRING EARNED 
EDUCATION-DEBT 
DISCHARGES 
FOR VETS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SUSIE LEE 
OF NEVADA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to correct the Record. Earlier in my re-
marks, I stated that the Department of Edu-
cation’s automated loan discharge for these 
loans had been stalled. While they were 
stalled for three months, the department has 
resumed forgiving hundreds of millions of dol-
lars in student loans owed by veterans with 
severe disabilities. This bill will require the 
Secretary to continue matching borrowers with 
data from Veterans Affairs to identify and 
automatically discharge the debt of matched 
individuals, eliminating burden on our vet-
erans. 
f 
WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH 
HON. SUSAN A. DAVIS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to commemorate Women’s History 
Month—and specifically, this year’s Women’s 
History Month. 
In 2020, we celebrate 100 years since the 
passage of the 19th Amendment and the be-
ginning of women’s suffrage. 
This is also the year in which 38 states fi-
nally ratified the Equal Rights Amendment and 
we held a vote on the House floor to extend 
the deadline for passage. 
These historic milestones remind us of how 
hard women have worked and fought in the 
streets, in the courts, and in political office for 
the rights we have today. 
But even as we celebrate the role of coura-
geous trailblazers, we remember, too, the hid-
den figures whose contributions are not in our 
history books. 
I think about the knowledge we cannot pass 
down, and about the women we will never 
know because their history was not recorded. 
We’ve made gains in the home, in the work-
place, in military service, across civil and re-
productive rights, and as global leaders. 
Despite that, we know that there are many 
places where young girls do not see what they 
can be—shattering elusive glass ceilings will 
change that.
