HONORING SURVIVORS OF GUN 
VIOLENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the survivors of gun 
violence. 
Last month, I had the opportunity to 
meet with Jules Oringel of Charlotte 
when she led the Pledge of Allegiance 
at my State of the District address. 
She is a local high school senior, and 
her story is a story that no young 
woman should ever have to tell. 
She was at home in her room, on her 
phone, like any teenager, and then she 
gets a message from one of her best 
friends. She says there is an active 
shooter in her school and she doesn’t 
know what is going on. She tells every-
one in the group chat she loves us. 
The 
best 
friend 
is 
at 
Marjory 
Stoneman Douglas High School in 
Parkland, Florida. Eventually, Jules 
learns that one of the people she had 
attended camp with lost her life in the 
shooting. 
Jules says, for the next few weeks, 
she was riddled with anxiety at school, 
at other public spaces; she couldn’t 
sleep, and she did not know how her 
friends would heal. 
That is something no young woman 
should ever go through. 
That is not okay with me. 
In the aftermath, Jules stepped up to 
start the nonprofit Return Home Sup-
plies, because every student and every 
teacher deserves to return home. 
It is hard for me to believe that we 
have reached a point in our country 
where people have legitimate concerns 
about making it home at the end of the 
day. As a 40-year educator, I cannot 
imagine how students balance those 
concerns with every other challenge 
that they face. 
And that is not okay with me. 
Last year, the city of Charlotte saw 
the worst violence that we have seen in 
decades. Tragically, we concluded 2019 
with 107 murders, the highest in dec-
ades. Our community lost a dispropor-
tionate number of African American 
men whose lives matter, too. The 
towns of the 12th Congressional Dis-
trict lost people to gun violence as 
well. 
And that is not okay with me. 
107 murders, total—the vast majority 
involving guns. Charlotte families lost 
siblings and parents and loved ones and 
community members, congregants, stu-
dents, and children to gun violence. 
Our community has been torn apart. 
That is not okay with me. 
Our very own UNC Charlotte, our 
49ers, lost two souls who called our 
community home. Four other students 
were gravely injured, and our commu-
nity was shaken to its core. And many 
of us are still in disbelief. 
A school shooting happened in Char-
lotte. In a hallowed place that is sup-
posed to prepare our youth for their fu-
ture, two futures ended. 
It was the first mass shooting that 
we have had at a school in Charlotte, 
and it should also be the last. 
That is not okay with me. 
Many Holy Books tell us that who-
ever destroys a single life is considered 
by Scripture to have destroyed the 
whole world, and whoever saves a sin-
gle life is considered by Scripture to 
have saved the whole world. Each time 
we lose someone, we lose an entire 
world, an entire universe of hopes, 
dreams, and aspirations; we lose a 
thread that binds together families and 
communities. 
Well, as a Charlotte community, as a 
nation, we must do something to stop 
the gun violence that tears at the fab-
ric of our communities. 
In this Congress, the first three bills 
the House sent to the Senate took 
weapons of war off the street and would 
make our communities safer. Now that 
the Senate has concluded its impeach-
ment trial, they have no excuse to con-
tinue to hold these bills up other than 
they just don’t care. 
And that is not okay with me. 
My colleagues and I have led the ef-
forts to introduce key pieces of legisla-
tion that would close the loophole in 
our background checks, extend the 
background check process, prohibit 
those convicted of hate crimes from 
purchasing firearms, and reinstate the 
Federal ban on assault weapons. 
I would like to take a moment to ap-
plaud the Charlotte City Council for

taking the lead with their Safe Com-
munities Committee and our edu-
cational institutions for their security 
upgrades and initiatives. 
Despite this Congress, more work lies 
ahead. And that is personal to me, be-
cause the violence must stop. 
Let me end by sharing one more mes-
sage from the Queen City. Our city’s 
comedians at Charlotte Squawks took 
a break from being funny to add a som-
ber note to the comedy show. 
To the tune of ‘‘This Land is Your 
Land’’ by Woody Guthrie: 
This land is Parkland, 
It’s Columbine and 
It’s Thousands Oaks at 
A student line dance. 
From Santa Fe High School 
To Virginia Beach murders, 
This stuff is not okay with me. 
As I keep watching 
This endless violence, 
With thoughts and prayers for 
A moment of silence, 
The politicians 
Are doing nothing, 
This stuff is not okay with me. 
I agree. This is not okay with me. We 
need sensible gun laws, and we need 
them right now.

HAROLD KNIGHT AND DAVID HALE 
TO BE INDUCTED INTO GRAND 
NATIONAL 
TURKEY 
CALLERS 
HALL OF FAME 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. COMER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Trigg Countians Harold 
Knight and David Hale for their com-
ing induction into the Grand National 
Turkey Callers Hall of Fame. Next 
week in Nashville, they will be for-
mally recognized for this high honor 
within the hunting and turkey calling 
world. 
Kentuckians are notably passionate 
about hunting and outdoors, but maybe 
none as much as Harold and David. 
Their impact on this unique industry 
cannot be understated. 
Starting in the early 1970s, these two 
individuals started Knight & Hale 
Game Calling and have been promoting 
their passion for the outdoors ever 
since. What began as a small startup 
out of a basement has become a suc-
cessful and recognized enterprise with-
in the hunting industry. 
After 40 years of work and raising 
significant attention to the field of 
game calling, I am thrilled to see two 
of my constituents receive this very 
high honor. This distinguished accom-
plishment is certainly something to be 
proud of and is deserving of recognition 
by this entire body. 
HONORING THE PADUCAH WORKFORCE EFFORTS 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, near the 
end of last week, I had the privilege of 
being back home in Kentucky and, as I 
try to do often, visit with constituents 
and see some of the exciting programs 
underway in the First Congressional 
District. 
While stopping in the city of Padu-
cah, I had the opportunity to see some 
of the life-changing workforce develop-
ment opportunities becoming available 
to our citizens. In a time when we have 
more available jobs than qualified 
workers 
to 
fill 
them, 
both 
the 
McCracken County Jail and Paducah’s 
school system are stepping up to fill 
the void. 
At the local jail, I saw the great 
work they are doing to provide low- 
level inmates with a pathway to be-
coming productive members of society. 
The training programs they are pro-
viding for welding and HVAC training 
will help fill critical workforce gaps 
and reduce incarceration rates over the 
long term. 
Once operational, the Paducah Inno-
vation Hub will house technical classes 
like carpentry, welding, and engineer-
ing. I was excited to see the construc-
tion of this new innovative facility, 
which will be a model for education 
moving forward. 
The old model of 4-year degrees and 
piles of student loan debt are not the 
answer for moving forward in edu-
cation. Instead, we must emphasize 
certificates and skills training. I thor-
oughly enjoyed traveling my district 
and seeing firsthand the need for a 
more skills-based education system 
moving forward. 
I am proud to represent McCracken 
County in this distinguished body, and 
I look forward to seeing the great work 
being done by the McCracken County 
Jail—and, in the future, the Paducah 
Innovation Hub—become a model for 
both Kentucky and the entire Nation. 
COMMENDING PRESIDENT TRUMP’S SUCCESSFUL 
WEEK 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commend President Trump for 
the overwhelmingly successful week he 
has had in Washington. 
In addition to delivering a strong and 
forward-looking vision to the country 
on Tuesday night, the President has fi-
nally been acquitted of the baseless 
smear charges leveled against him by 
NANCY PELOSI and ADAM SCHIFF. 
The historically partisan impeach-
ment put forward by House Democrats 
was a stain on American history. But, 
thankfully, their desperate attempt to 
silence the will of the American people 
is finally behind us. 
Starting with President Trump’s uni-
fying State of the Union Address, the 
country is now ready to move forward. 
It is long past time for Congress to join 
the President in advancing a positive 
agenda that will improve the lives of 
every single American. That includes 
moving on from classless actions like 
tearing up Presidential speeches on na-
tional television. 
Whether it be the current economic 
boom, fairer trade deals, or steady 
leadership in keeping America safe, the 
President has a strong record of accom-
plishment. But, as always, we have 
more challenges to tackle. 
I sincerely hope to see the Democrats 
move beyond the politics of impeach-
ment and resistance and get to work 
for the American people. It is time for 
action on lowering healthcare costs, se-
curing the southern border, and con-
tinuing to advance our Nation’s tre-
mendous economic momentum. 
I hope to see my Democrat colleagues 
join me in supporting the President’s 
efforts to improve opportunities for 
working families and keep Americans 
safe. The millions of Americans whom 
we represent expect and deserve noth-
ing less.

NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate National Gun 
Violence Survivors Week and to honor 
and support the Oregonians and people 
across the country who have been af-
fected by gun violence. 
Gun violence is a public health crisis 
in this country. Each year, more than 
36,000 people, nationwide, including al-
most 500 Oregonians, are killed by 
guns, and more than 100,000 people 
across the country are injured by gun-
fire. 
For those survivors of gun violence 
and the friends and families of those 
killed, life will never be the same. 
Nobody is immune to the threat of 
gun violence, and communities have 
been forced to take what should be un-
thinkable steps to protect themselves. 
Parents 
are 
buying 
bulletproof 
backpacks for their young children. 
Schools across the country are con-
ducting active-shooter drills to make 
sure their students know what to do in 
the event of an attack. These drills 
often cause trauma for students and for 
educators. 
At a townhall meeting, a student 
told me the first thing she does when 
she goes into a classroom is she looks 
where to hide and how to escape. 
As a mom, this is heartbreaking; as a 
policymaker, it is unacceptable. Kids 
in classrooms should be focused on 
learning, not being fearful for their 
lives. This is not normal, and it should 
never be normal. 
But there is reason to be hopeful. 
Families and communities in Oregon 
and around the country are rising up 
and demanding change. Students are 
demanding that Congress finally take 
action to protect them. 
This Congress, we took the critical 
step of passing H.R. 8, a comprehensive 
bipartisan background check bill that 
will save lives if it is enacted. I call on 
Leader MCCONNELL
to immediately 
bring H.R. 8 to the floor. We cannot 
wait any longer. Every day this bill 
languishes in the Senate is another day 
when people are dying in Oregon and 
around the country. 
We will not rest until we have done 
all we can to reduce gun violence in 
this country. We owe it to the children 
who are looking for a place to hide in 
the classrooms; we owe it to the fami-
lies who are mourning their loved ones

they have lost; and we owe it to the

I stand in solidarity with the sur-
vivors of gun violence.

RECOGNIZING THE BUCKS 
COALITION AGAINST TRAFFICKING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the Bucks Coa-
lition Against Trafficking, a group 
working 
to 
eradicate 
human 
traf-
ficking in Bucks County and in our en-
tire 
region. 
The 
Bucks 
Coalition 
Against Trafficking is a project cre-
ated by the Network of Victim Assist-
ance, working to end this modern-day 
slavery. 
Members of NOVA received recogni-
tion recently from the Bucks County 
Board of Commissioners for their work 
to educate our community and to raise 
awareness. 
The project was established to en-
courage victim identification, commu-
nity education, enhancement of arrests 
and prosecution of traffickers, legisla-
tive advocacy, and a coordinated re-
sponse for survivor services. 
Mr. Speaker, it is estimated that 25 
million people across the globe are vic-
tims of human trafficking, and ap-
proximately 75 percent of these victims 
are women and girls. Statistics show 
that one in seven children who run 
away from home end up being traf-
ficked. 
Mr. Speaker, one of the first bills I 
introduced this Congress, the End 
Banking for Human Traffickers Act of 
2019, would increase the role of finan-
cial institutions in combating human 
trafficking, which is an incredibly im-
portant part of this fight. 
I call upon the House to bring this 
commonsense legislation to a vote, and 
to continue to work to support the vic-
tims of human trafficking.

RECOGNIZING 2019 SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST OF THE 
YEAR, DR. JULIA SZARKO 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Dr. Julia 
Szarko, who was recently named the 
2019 School Psychologist of the Year by 
the Association of School Psycholo-
gists of Pennsylvania. 
Dr. Szarko is in her 23rd year as a 
school psychologist, currently working 
at Cold Spring Elementary in Central 
Bucks County, Pennsylvania. A former 
president of the Association of School 
Psychologists 
of 
Pennsylvania, 
Dr. 
Szarko has worked for years to expand 
school-based mental health services in 
Pennsylvania and to address the na-
tional school psychologist shortages 
across the country. 
Ensuring students have access to 
mental health resources is vital to 
their current and their future success, 
along with that of their peers as well. 
With only 20 percent of America’s 
youth receiving the mental health 
services they need, further action must 
be taken to expand access to these 
services in schools, which is legislation 
that Dr. Szarko helped us draft. 
We need more people like Dr. Szarko 
working to ensure that children in 
Pennsylvania and across our Nation 
have the resources and support they 
need to succeed. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF LESLIE 
KOLIFRATH 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of 
Leslie 
Kolifrath, 
who 
recently 
passed away after a brave and coura-
geous fight with breast cancer. 
A lifelong resident of Bucks County, 
Leslie always put the needs of others 
ahead of her own. She was very much 
beloved by her family, her friends, her 
pets, and her coworkers. 
Mr. Speaker, I got to know Leslie 
personally through the amazing work 
she did throughout Lower Bucks Coun-
ty, particularly Bristol Township, and 
helping so many people. The one thing 
that we all remember about Leslie is 
that no issue was too small for her to 
tackle when it came to protecting and 
serving the residents of Bristol Town-
ship and Lower Bucks County. 
So we offer our prayers to Leslie’s 
family. We stand by her family in this 
very difficult time. 
She is now enjoying her eternal re-
ward for a life she lived serving others 
in Bucks County and across our region. 
RECOGNIZING IVY HILL THERAPEUTIC 
EQUESTRIAN CENTER 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in recognition of an organi-
zation in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, 
changing the lives for individuals with 
cognitive, physical, emotional, behav-
ioral, and psychological needs. 
For over 20 years, the Ivy Hill Thera-
peutic Equestrian Center in Hilltown, 
Bucks County, has created therapeutic 
programs for people of all ages and lev-
els of ability utilizing the equine expe-
rience. 
In addition to equine-assisted activi-
ties, Ivy Hill collaborates with several 
community partners to provide job 
training through specialized programs 
dedicated to an exponentially-growing 
special needs population in our region 
and across the country. Through these 
programs, Ivy Hill serves over 150 pro-
gram riders with more than a dozen 
trained therapy horses, led by nearly 
200 staff members and volunteers. 
Mr. Speaker, their motto is: ‘‘Horses 
+ Love = Hope’’ and, having heard first-
hand the heartwarming testimonials of 
riders and their families, it is clear 
that this equation is holding very true. 
We are very thankful for all they do for 
our special needs population and every-
body in our region. 
f 
GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gun 
Violence Survivors Week. 
The gun violence epidemic in our Na-
tion is destroying lives. A recent study 
found that 58 percent of adults in 
America reported that they or someone 
they care about has experienced gun vi-
olence in their lifetime. Think about 
that. More than half of the adults in 
America have been touched by gun vio-
lence. It doesn’t have to be this way. 
In January of last year, our former 
colleague and gun violence survivor, 
Gabby Giffords, joined me, the Speak-
er, and members of the Gun Violence 
Prevention Task Force as we intro-
duced H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Back-
ground Checks Act of 2019. It was 8 
years to the day that she was shot. 
Gabby had one message for us in Con-
gress. She said: ‘‘We must never stop 
fighting.’’ 
And the House did just that. We kept 
fighting, and we passed H.R. 8 almost 1 
year ago, 344 days ago, to be exact. 
Majority Leader MCCONNELL has had 
344 days to act—to fight gun violence. 
What has he done? Nothing. Nothing. 
Not one vote, not one hearing. Sur-
vivors have called on him to act. More 
than 90 percent of Americans support 
the bill. Why won’t he give the bill a 
vote? 
Every time there is a mass shooting 
that makes headlines, the Republican 
leadership sends thoughts and prayers. 
Survivors don’t want your thoughts 
and prayers; they want a vote. They 
want to keep guns away from felons. 
They want to keep guns away from do-
mestic abusers. 
I call on the Senate to act. Honor 
survivors. Do your job. Pass H.R. 8 for 
Gabby and for every survivor across 
our country. 
f 
PROTECT MEDICAID 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I am so 
proud to stand here today to support H. 
Res. 826, the protect Medicaid resolu-
tion. I am proud to go on record today 
to spotlight the administration’s con-
tinuous 
attempts 
to 
take 
away 
healthcare for Americans, especially 
those most vulnerable, such as seniors 
and those with disabilities. 
Mr. Speaker, Medicaid was created in 
recognition 
of 
the 
importance 
of 
healthcare for all Americans. Even 
though many low-income people have 
jobs, working every single day, the re-
ality is that they don’t have access to 
employer or private health insurance, 
and Medicaid fills that gap. 
It is such a sad reality that we need 
to remind this administration that the 
purpose of Medicaid is to provide 
healthcare for low-income individuals 
and families. Medicaid recognizes the 
humanity of everyone, despite their so-
cioeconomic status. 
When I was on the Budget Com-
mittee, I repeatedly voted against per-
nicious efforts to change the Federal-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H854 
February 6, 2020 
State Medicaid partnership through 
the per capita caps, onerous work re-
quirements—I led a letter on that— 
State waivers to jettison core medical 
protections, repeal of the Affordable 
Care Act. It was just exhausting. And 
of course, the favorite tool in the tool-
kit was block grants. Block grants. 
If you don’t know what block grants 
are, just think, chopping block. 
And why has Congress repeatedly not 
enacted these harmful proposals? Be-
cause 
block-granting 
Medicaid 
will 
only lead to gutting care for millions, 
including seniors and people with dis-
abilities. 
Block-granting Medicaid means set-
ting caps on total funding and leaving 
the hard choices to governors and 
State legislators to decide which popu-
lations to serve and which ones to 
drop. 
Seniors and persons with disabilities, 
those account for a good portion of 
Medicaid spending, and any attempts 
to cut costs, as a result of cap funding, 
will hit these groups the hardest. 
Perhaps we should cut services to 
more healthy children to meet the 
needs of those in nursing homes. We 
literally pit the medical needy against 
the medical needy. 
Healthcare providers whose Medicaid 
payments would be curtailed and cut so 
low that they may decide not to pro-
vide services, will make it harder for 
even those who are eligible for Med-
icaid to find those services. 
And let me just remind you that 
Medicaid block grants are not respon-
sive to recessions. Per capita cuts, 
block grants, and work requirements 
would undermine Medicaid’s ability to 
help when the need is greatest, such as 
during an economic recession, as it was 
designed to do. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H. Res. 826 to reject 
efforts to reduce access to quality and 
affordable healthcare for low-income 
patients, especially those with serious 
and chronic health conditions. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF CAPTAIN RYAN PHANEUF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Air 
Force Captain Ryan Phaneuf, who died 
last week serving his country in Af-
ghanistan. 
His sacrifice is a solemn reminder 
that, after nearly 20 years of conflict, 
brave Americans regularly volunteer to 
take tremendous risks in order to keep 
us all safe. We are grateful for the serv-
ice of our men and women in uniform. 
Ryan grew up dreaming of flying. His 
commitment to service began at a 
young age. While at Alvirne High 
School in Hudson, New Hampshire, he 
joined the Junior ROTC program and 
was considered a leader by his peers. 
After graduating from Embry-Riddle 
Aeronautical University, he signed up 
for the United States Air Force. Ryan 
served his country with distinction and 
was a decorated pilot. 
By flying communications missions, 
Ryan risked his own life to facilitate 
effective battlefield communication in 
Afghanistan which, in turn, helped 
keep servicemembers on the ground 
safe. 
Tragically, Ryan’s plane crashed in 
the snowy mountains of Afghanistan 
on January 27. Our thoughts and pray-
ers are with his parents, Nancy and 
Donald, and his loving wife, Megan, 
during this tragic time. 
We will never forget Ryan’s commit-
ment to protecting our country and our 
men and women in uniform. By the 
grace of God, we pray that the boy who 
dreamed of flying will forever rest 
peacefully. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE OF KATIE 
THYNE 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Officer 
Katie Thyne, a Newport News police of-
ficer who died while serving her com-
munity on January 23, 2020. 
Katie spent her formative years in 
New Hampshire and attended Alvirne 
High School in Hudson, New Hamp-
shire. Her commitment to service 
began early. While at Alvirne, Katie 
participated in the Junior ROTC pro-
gram, where she gained a reputation 
for hard work and kindness. 
After high school, Katie enlisted in 
the Navy, serving her country with dis-
tinction and receiving commendation 
for her good conduct. Upon completing 
her service in the Navy, she continued 
to serve and joined the Newport News, 
Virginia police force. 
Tragically, on January 23, Katie was 
killed in the line of duty. Her sacrifice 
is a reminder of the tremendous risks 
police officers take every day when 
they put on their uniform and go to 
work keeping our communities safe. 
Because of the service and sacrifice of 
members of law enforcement, all our 
communities are better for it. 
Katie was irreplaceable, and she is 
dearly missed. She will always be re-
membered for her kind heart, her radi-
ant and constant smile, and her love of 
family and friends. 
We will keep Katie, and her family, 
and the Hudson community in our 
thoughts and prayers.

THE STAIN ON THE SENATE AND 
OUR CONGRESS FOR HISTORY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. KENNEDY) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, ‘‘Cor-
rupting an election to keep oneself in 
office is perhaps the most abusive and 
destructive violation of one’s oath of 
office that I can imagine.’’ 
Yesterday, Senator MITT
ROMNEY 
outlined what so many of us know to 
be the truth; that the evidence of this 
President’s guilt is beyond any doubt; 
that despite silencing witnesses and 
shielding even more evidence, that this 
President abused his office to retain 
his slipping grasp on power. 
b 1030 
Yet Senators voted to acquit, none-
theless. This will be a stain on the Sen-
ate and on Congress for all history. 
But lost beneath the headlines and 
the attempts to justify the unjustifi-
able lies, the true motivation that 
guided almost every single Republican 
Senator and every last Republican 
Member of this House—fear, not just of 
losing a seat but of losing power; fear 
of what might happen if we allow this 
representative democracy to truly rep-
resent the interests and desires and 
agenda of all its people; fear of a coun-
try: 
Where we actually address climate 
change because it is devastating our 
planet and threatening our lives; 
Where women could have an unalter-
able right to bodily autonomy; 
Where 
everyone 
would 
get 
the 
healthcare they need when they need 
it; 
Where guns wouldn’t shatter our 
schools and our churches and theaters 
and every place in between; 
Where working families wouldn’t go 
to bed fearful of what tomorrow may 
bring; 
Where babies won’t be ripped from 
their parents’ arms and kids trapped in 
cages; 
Where freedom means the freedom to 
be you, whoever you may be; 
Where you count, no matter the God 
of your prayers, the color of your skin, 
the hand that you hold, the language 
that you speak. 
The good news is, however, that their 
power, our power, as elected officials is 
temporary. The people’s power is not. 
It is our people who have always 
forced our Nation forward on civil 
rights, on healthcare, on justice, on 
war and peace, on liberty, on freedom. 
And it is our people who will hold 
every single person in Washington ac-
countable for their actions yesterday, 
and that gives me faith. It gives me 
hope. It makes me sure that the best 
days of our democracy are still to 
come.

Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr.

least one victim of gun violence in 
their lifetime. Imagine who that might 
be in your own life. 
344: That is the number of days that 
have gone by since House Democrats 
passed not one but two safety bills to 
help bring an end to senseless suf-
fering. For 344 days, both of these bills 
have been met by MITCH MCCONNELL’s 
wall of obstruction. These are bipar-
tisan bills that are also supported by 90 
percent of Americans across political 
ideology, and they require immediate 
action. 
Senator MCCONNELL, your compla-
cency is lethal. Every day you fail to 
act is another day that more Ameri-
cans suffer loss. Stop the silence. Start 
doing your job, and change the course 
of gun violence in this country. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward Mem-
bers of the Senate. Members are fur-
ther reminded to address their remarks 
to the Chair and not to a perceived 
viewing audience. 
f 
SENATE SHOULD ENACT COMMON-
SENSE SOLUTIONS TO GUN VIO-
LENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
the honor of representing the great 
State of Colorado. Unfortunately, Colo-
rado is no stranger to gun violence. 
I was 14 years old when my high 
school was put on lockdown. Soon 
after, my classmates and I learned 
that, just a couple of miles down the 
road, a terrible tragedy was unfolding 
at Columbine High School, a terrible 
tragedy in which 13 people were shot 
and killed. 
One of those 13 victims was a 14-year- 
old boy named Daniel Mauser. This 
week, I brought Daniel’s father, Tom 
Mauser, to the State of the Union to 
highlight the urgent need for action on 
the gun violence epidemic. He sat here 
in the gallery just a few days ago as 
the President delivered his State of the 
Union and heard that the President 
failed to mention any effort to engage 
in gun violence prevention and to deal 
with the public health crisis that we 
face. 
For 20 years, Tom has bravely con-
verted his pain and his anguish into ac-
tion, pushing for gun violence preven-
tion. Yet 20 years later, he and, frank-
ly, the entire State of Colorado are 
still waiting on Congress to address the 
most basic and commonsense solutions 
to gun violence. 
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise for Tom. I 
rise for his son. 
I rise for the so many victims that 
we have lost to gun violence across 
Colorado and across our country. I rise 
today for the more than 100,000 Ameri-
cans who every year survive a gunshot 
wound and now face the lifelong phys-
ical and emotional toll surviving gun 
violence takes on an individual. 
I rise today to give voice to the mil-
lions of Americans across this great 
country who are tired of the Senate’s 
leadership being held hostage by the 
special interest gun lobby. 
I rise today because all Americans 
have a right to make their commu-
nities safe from the onslaught of gun 
violence that this country witnesses 
day after day. They have a right to de-
mand the dangerous loopholes like the 
Charleston loophole are closed. They 
have a right to demand an end to the 
unbelievable number of military-style 
firearms flowing through their streets. 
And demanded they have, Mr. Speak-
er. Indeed, a majority of Americans 
support creating a red flag law, by way 
of example, allowing police or family 
members to request a judge to tempo-
rarily remove guns from individuals 
who may be dangerous. A majority of 
Americans think that it is absolutely 
ridiculous that we do not require uni-
versal background checks for gun pur-
chases at gun shows or other private 
sales. And a majority of Americans 
think that it is beyond comprehensible 
that Members of Congress would stand 
in the way of working to ensure that 
individuals do not have access to weap-
ons of mass murder. 
Let us be clear, Mr. Speaker. Let us 
be clear. The gun violence epidemic 
that has gripped this country is neither 
a Democratic nor Republican issue, 
but, rather, one of national impor-
tance, the solutions to which must not 
face further delay. 
We have grieved together; we have 
demanded change together; and we 
have been shocked by the paralysis 
that has gripped this institution when 
it comes to tackling our country’s gun 
violence epidemic. 
Mr. Speaker, I will close simply by 
saying the time has well since passed 
when we should have enacted these 
commonsense reforms. We should have 
done it 20 years ago. There is bipar-
tisan legislation in the Senate right 
now that will address these pressing 
issues, and it is time for the Senate 
majority leader to bring that legisla-
tion to the Senate floor for a vote. 
Coloradans and Americans have waited 
long enough. 
f 
SUPPORT PUERTO RICO 
EARTHQUAKE SUPPLEMENTAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in solidarity with the thousands 
of our Puerto Rican brothers and sis-
ters surviving the loss and trauma of 
ongoing natural disasters that have 
ravaged the island of Puerto Rico, the 
youth, 
the 
elderly, 
the 
ill, 
the 
unhoused, those in poverty, and those 
living with disabilities who find them-
selves disproportionately harmed by 
food and healthcare insecurity, fre-
quent power outages, infrastructure 
collapse, and barriers to transparency. 
Just last month, 13-year-old Jaideliz 
Moreno Ventura died due to chronic 
medical supply shortages. The only 
medical center on her island, Vieques, 
has not reopened its doors since Hurri-
cane Maria 3 years ago. 
To this day, 240,000 students and 
their educators must stay home be-
cause their schools are still too unsafe 
to open, and 5,000 families remain dis-
placed from their homes. 
But the fear and anguish are not lim-
ited to those remaining on the island. 
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts 
proudly boasts the fifth largest Puerto 
Rican community in the country, and 
in the Massachusetts Seventh Congres-
sional District, I represent 35,000 Puer-
to Ricans. 
I have borne witness to both the 
strength and the pain of those who 
were displaced after Hurricane Maria 
who now call Boston home and those 
Puerto Ricans who have called Boston 
home for decades who fear for their 
family members who are still on the is-
land. They share with me their ongoing 
fear for their families in Puerto Rico 
facing ongoing threats to their homes 
and their lives. 
For too long, this administration has 
turned its back on the people of Puerto 
Rico. It is shameful, and we must not 
allow it to continue. 
I am grateful for the leadership of 
Chairwoman 
LOWEY
and 
Chairman 
NEAL
in working to organize this 
much-needed funding package that we 
will vote on later today. I also recog-
nize my colleague from New York, Rep-
resentative VELA´ ZQUEZ, for her unwav-
ering love, which has informed her un-
wavering fight for the island. 
In my own district, I thank IBA, 
Chelsea 
Collaborative, 
Somos 
de 
Sabana Grande, the Puerto Rican Vet-
erans Association, and many more. I 
urge my colleagues to support this 
package, H.R. 5687.

You hear our prayer, we will heed Your 
wisdom, or at least try to. 
In the midst of darkness, You are 
light; enlighten us. In the midst of dis-
cord, You are harmony; mend us. 
When we swagger with self-righteous-
ness, remind us that You are righteous-
ness. When we hasten to justify our-
selves, remind us You are our justifica-
tion. 
We thank You, God, for the blessings 
of vibrant, industrious newcomers from 
many nations that make our Nation 
stronger. 
When, in our shadows, we despair; 
create hope in Your brightness. When, 
in our frailty, we doubt; give us faith 
in Your strength. When, out of fear and 
ignorance, we hate, make us wise and 
secure in Your love. 
God, please, faith, hope, and love,

Amen.

Ms. SHERRILL led the Pledge of Al-

I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

WELCOMING MONSIGNOR KEVIN 
SULLIVAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. ESPAILLAT) is recognized for 
1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to welcome Monsignor Kevin 
Sullivan as a guest chaplain here 
today. 
Monsignor Sullivan is the Executive 
Director of Catholic Charities for the 
Archdiocese of New York. 
Monsignor Sullivan also represents 
Catholic Charities agencies in public 
policy discussions about immigration, 
welfare reform, job development, and 
foster care. He joins us on a day when 
we welcome more than 500 Dominican 
Americans from around the country to 
celebrate Dominican heritage and dis-
cuss civic engagement and issues af-
fecting 
the 
Dominican 
community 
across the country. 
A native of the Bronx, the Monsignor 
served as a parish priest at St. Eliza-
beth’s Church, my church, in Wash-
ington Heights, which is home to a his-
toric and thriving Dominican Amer-
ican community. 
We owe a debt of gratitude to Mon-
signor Sullivan for his service to our 
community and to all New Yorkers and 
I am proud to see him give the invoca-
tion in the House of Representatives 
today.

COMMEMORATING THE 20TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
THE 
POSITIVE 
COMMUNITY MAGAZINE 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to acknowledge The Positive 
Community magazine on its 20th anni-
versary. 
The Positive Community started as 
an idea of two broadcasting profes-
sionals, Adrian Council, Sr., and Jean 
Nash Wells. They were tired of all of 
the negative press about African Amer-
icans. They wanted to create a publica-
tion that focused on the good news 
coming from these communities. 
They started with a newsletter and 
distributed it to churches and commu-
nity centers. It became so popular that 
they turned it into a magazine. Today, 
The Positive Community magazine and 
its website highlights great events and 
people from our African American cul-
ture. 
I applaud their efforts and encourage 
more people to read it. It is time to 
hear more positive stories from African 
Americans in their communities. 
f 
AMERICAN HEART MONTH 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, February is American 
Heart Month, a month where we espe-
cially recognize and promote positive 
heart health. 
Currently, 302,000 people in South 
Carolina have coronary heart disease. I 
am thankful for the great work of the 
National Coalition for Women with 
Heart Disease and the American Heart 
Association for their steps to spread 
awareness about heart disease, the 
number one killer of men and women 
in America. 
I am grateful that, in the Second 
Congressional District, we have many 
incredible events to recognize heart 
health, including the Heart Walk, held 
in Aiken and the Midlands. These 
walks raise critical funds to help save 
lives from heart disease. 
As a volunteer with the Lexington 
County Heart Association, I know 
firsthand of the dedicated personnel. I 
appreciate American Heart Association 
Executive Director Crystal Kirkland of 
the Midlands and Jackie Lipscomb of 
the American Heart Association-CSRA. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
Congratulations, President Donald 
Trump, for your deserved exoneration.

NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS WEEK 
(Mr. TED LIEU of California asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in honor of Na-
tional Gun Violence Survivors Week. 
Every day in America, 103 people are 
killed by gun violence, and many more 
survivors are left to deal with the life-
long trauma. This is horrific and it de-
mands action. 
It is one of the reasons that last year 
the House Judiciary Committee, on 
which I sit, as well as the House of 
Representatives, passed for the first 
time in over a quarter century, signifi-
cant gun legislation. We passed uni-
versal background checks. 
It is now before the Republican-con-
trolled Senate, and I ask them to sim-
ply do their jobs and put that bill up 
for a vote. 
I am also grateful that last month, 
California’s 33rd Congressional Dis-
trict’s Youth Advisory Council, which 
consists of high school students in the 
area, got together to discuss ways to 
address the gun violence epidemic. 
At their recommendation, I am proud 
to lend my support to bills like Ghost 
Guns Are Guns Act and Jaime’s Law, 
both of which I believe will protect 
American lives.

IN MEMORY OF ROBERT AICHELE 
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and mem-
ory of a true community leader, Mr. 
Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Aichele, of Lancaster, 
who passed away at the age of 92 on 
Tuesday. Bob was a friend to everyone 
and would always greet you with a sig-
nature warm smile. 
He spent his life in service to others, 
in service to the Nation as a seaman 
first class in the United States Navy, a 
veteran of World War II and the Korean 
War. 
He also served his community, serv-
ing as the president of many boards 
and associations, and was a Manor 
Township supervisor for more than 25 
years. 
When he was not serving the commu-
nity he loved, Bob was with his family. 
He is survived by his loving wife of 67 
years, Mary Anne, five children, 15 
grandchildren, and one great grand-
child.

know I always appreciated his friend-

THE TRAGEDY OF GUN VIOLENCE 
IS PREVENTABLE 
(Ms. SHERRILL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, 
there have been 37 days so far in 2020. 
More gun deaths happened in this 
country in the first 37 days than in 
every other high-income nation in a 
year. 
The tragedy of gun violence in this 
country is that it is preventable; 36,000 
American lives are needlessly lost an-
nually. Tens of thousands more are 
shot, injured, or left grieving for a fam-
ily member, like Jamie McLaughlin 
from my community in New Jersey. 
Twenty-eight 
years 
ago, 
Jamie’s 
brother, Chet, was shot and killed. In 
honor of Chet and National Gun Vio-
lence Survivors Week, Jamie recently 
shared that there is not a day that goes 
by that she doesn’t ache for her broth-
er’s presence in her life. 
Families across this country grieve 
like Jamie, waiting for the Senate to 
have the courage to act. 
We passed a bipartisan background 
check bill 344 days ago, a commonsense 
measure that more than 90 percent of 
Americans in this country support. 
We owe action to victims, survivors, 
and families torn apart by gun vio-
lence. It is time, past time, that the 
Senate acts and passes H.R. 8.

HONORING THE LIVES OF FRANK 
AND CINDA EDWARDS 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to re-
member Frank and Cinda Edwards 
from Springfield, Illinois, who trag-
ically died in a plane crash last week. 
Frank and Cinda were my good 
friends. I met Frank when he was the 
fire chief in Springfield, Illinois. Frank 
was a proud Illinois National Guards-
man, a former alderman, and a former 
mayor. Everyone who knew Frank 
knew that he was not afraid to speak 
his mind, and we will miss that. 
Cinda worked as a nurse for 27 years 
before becoming the Sangamon County 
Coroner. She truly loved her job as cor-
oner and took pride in making the of-
fice the best it could be. 
I was blessed to see Cinda days before 
the tragic crash. I can’t believe they 
are gone. 
I still owe Frank a cheeseburger from 
Bill’s Toasty for a wager he won with 
me last year. It will be a reminder 
when I eat that cheeseburger that life 
is too short. 
My thoughts and prayers are truly 
with their son, Alex, during this impos-
sibly difficult time. 
Springfield won’t be the same with-
out you, Frank and Cinda. 
God bless.

GUN VIOLENCE IS AN EPIDEMIC 
(Mr. HUFFMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
HUFFMAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
what if I told you there was an epi-
demic in the United States that has 
killed close to 40,000 people, just in the 
year 2019 alone? 
And what if I told you this epidemic 
has taken the lives of almost 8,000 peo-
ple since 2014 in California alone? 
I am not talking about coronavirus, 
or Ebola, or AIDS, or some global pan-
demic. This public health crisis is 
uniquely American. I am talking, of 
course, about gun violence. 
We have let this public health epi-
demic go unchecked far too long. If gun 
violence were a disease with the death 
numbers I just shared with you, we 
would not rest until we had a cure. But 
because many Members of Congress are 
frozen in their ability to act in the face 
of the money the NRA pours into the 
gun lobby, we haven’t acted; especially 
the Senate has not stepped up to act. 
This week is National Gun Violence 
Survivors Week, where we honor the 
lives lost to gun violence and share the 
stories of those whose lives have been 
affected. 
This disease does have a cure. We 
need the Senate to hear our urgency 
and to act on gun violence legislation 
now.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF FIRE 
CHIEF MIKE BRENT 
(Mr. RIGGLEMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to salute a life of service. 
Next week, Fire Chief Mike Brent will 
hang up his helmet and enter a well-de-
served retirement. 
Mike joined the Fluvanna County 
Volunteer Fire Department in January 
of 1977 as a member of the Palmyra 
Volunteer Fire Company. He quickly 
rose through the ranks, and just 10 
years later he was elected to serve as 
the Chief of Fluvanna County Volun-
teer Department; leading volunteers 
from Palmyra, Fork Union, and Kents 
Store. 
During his 32 years as chief, he was 
instrumental in many significant im-
provements to the delivery of fire and 
EMS services in Fluvanna County, to 
include a capital improvements plan 
for 
three 
new, 
state-of-the-art 
firehouses. 
Even after retiring as chief, Mike 
continues to volunteer as a member of 
the Palmyra Volunteer Fire Company; 
a true testament to his resolute com-
mitment and unwavering service to our 
community. 
Chief Brent truly embodies what it 
means to be selfless and putting others’ 
needs before his own. We are forever 
grateful for his service.

PROTECTING

WORK-
FORCE 
AGAINST 
EROSION 
OF 
THEIR RIGHTS 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I rise to express 
my strong support for H.R. 2474, the 
Protecting the Right to Organize Act. 
For over 3 years, the Trump adminis-
tration has waged an assault on orga-
nized labor, limiting unions’ ability to 
fairly represent the American work-
force while undermining safeguards 
that protect against discrimination 
and unsafe working conditions. 
This bill will protect our Nation’s 
workforce against this erosion of their 
rights. The PRO Act introduces mean-
ingful, enforceable penalties for compa-
nies that violate workers’ rights to 
unionize, streamlines access to justice 
for workers who suffer retaliation, fa-
cilitates collective bargaining, and in-
creases transparency in labor relations. 
Our Nation was not built by gold or 
silver but was built by labor. Pro-
tecting the rights of workers to orga-
nize strengthens our workforce, our 
economy, and our Nation. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this important bill.

COMMEMORATING 
LEGACY 
OF 
PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN ON 
HIS BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to com-
memorate the legacy of President Ron-
ald Reagan on his birthday. 
Some have called him Ronnie, the 
Gipper, or the Great Communicator. 
No matter what you call him, he was 
the right President for this country at 
the right time. 
President Reagan came into office 
with the world still in crisis over the 
Cold War and a country under the 
crushing weight of stagflation. By the 
time President Reagan left office, the 
economy roared and Reagan’s words 
had inflicted a mortal blow to the Ber-
lin Wall. Shortly after leaving office, 
the Berlin Wall fell and the threat of 
communism along with it. 
President Reagan led this country 
with conviction. His conservative prin-
ciples empowered millions of people

from coast-to-coast and across the 
world. His words struck fear into the 
hearts of our enemies and warmed the 
hearts of our friends. 
We have a lot to learn from President 
Reagan’s life, his legacy, and his lead-
ership.

RECOGNIZING VICTIMS AND SUR-
VIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
(Ms. SHALALA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Speaker, this 
is National Gun Violence Survivors 
Week, and I rise to recognize the vic-
tims and survivors of domestic vio-
lence across the United States who 
have felt the effects of our weak gun 
laws. 
Just last week in my community in 
Miami, a man killed his infant son’s 
mother, grandmother, and great-grand-
mother with a high-powered rifle be-
fore abducting the days-old baby. The 
infant, Andrew, is still missing. 
Stories like this are not unusual in 
this country. Women in the United 
States are 21 times more likely to be 
murdered with a gun than in other 
high-income countries. 
When we don’t take action, it is peo-
ple like Andrew, his mother, his grand-
mother, and his great-grandmother 
who pay the price. 
Andrew deserves to grow up with his 
family. 
He 
deserves 
leaders 
who 
prioritize his well-being over the vio-
lent whims of abusers. He deserves a 
chance at life not tinged with tragedy. 
f 
GUN VIOLENCE IS MISNOMER 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, it is 
indeed National Gun Violence Sur-
vivors Week. We all share in mourning 
the loss of those lives that have been 
taken by those filled with anger, hate, 
and evil. However, gun violence is a 
misnomer. 
Evil lies in the hearts of people. Guns 
are inanimate objects, much like this 
pen, which isn’t going to move for the 
entire time I am making this speech. 
It is naive to believe that more gun 
seizures, more violations of our Second 
Amendment, are going to do anything 
other than create more victims in gun- 
free zones. Ask Jack Wilson, who 
stopped evil because he was armed in 
that church in Texas recently. 
It is naive to think that evil will be 
disarmed. Only the innocent will be 
disarmed in this continued press to 
have our Second Amendment violated 
and eliminated. 
f 
LOSING LOVED ONE TO GUN VIO-
LENCE IS WOUND THAT NEVER 
HEALS 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, 
like so many of my colleagues, I rise 
today during National Gun Violence 
Survivors Week. 
We mark this occasion at the begin-
ning of February because with a gun 
death rate 10 times greater than other 
developed nations, more Americans 
have already been killed with guns in 
2020 than are killed in the entire year 
in our peer countries. We are a Nation 
suffering an epidemic of gun violence. 
Each year, more than 36,000 Ameri-
cans are killed in acts of gun violence, 
and an additional 100,000 are injured by 
firearms. 
The trauma caused by this violence 
is not limited to the victims. Losing a 
loved one to gun violence is a wound 
that never heals. 
If this were any other epidemic de-
stroying lives on such a great scale, we 
would have long ago taken action. 
To be fair, in this House, we did act. 
Nearly a year ago, we passed bipartisan 
background check legislation, H.R. 8, 
to close loopholes that allow gun sales 
to go unchecked. In the Senate, Leader 
MCCONNELL
is blocking a vote and 
choosing obstruction over saving lives. 
Enough is enough. For all the sur-
vivors of gun violence, this week, we 
demand action. 
f 
CHILDREN SHOULD GROW UP 
WITHOUT FEAR OF GUN VIOLENCE 
(Mr. ALLRED asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. ALLRED. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor survivors during Na-
tional Gun Violence Survivors Week. 
Tragically, this week, sisters Deja 
and Abbaney Matts of Garland were 
killed, and Abbaney’s toddler was in-
jured at a shooting at Texas A&M- 
Commerce University. The shooter was 
believed to be her ex-boyfriend, who 
was recently charged with aggravated 
assault for attacking Abbaney. 
I send my deepest condolences to the 
Matts family. 
To honor the Matts and to under-
score the need for action, I want to 
share a letter 6-year-old Cal Bingham 
of Rowlett sent me after the mass 
shootings in El Paso at Midland. He 
wrote: ‘‘When kids get shot, that’s less 
friends to play with. When I grow up, I 
don’t want to hear about anymore on 
the news about people being killed with 
guns. What are you going to do to help 
make us safer?’’ 
I want my son, Jordan, and kids like 
Cal to grow up without fear of gun vio-
lence. I call on the Senate to act and 
pass the bipartisan bills that we have 
passed in this House, including back-
ground 
checks 
and 
the 
Violence 
Against Women Act. Our children are 
watching. 
f 
SUPPORTING FEDERAL PRIVACY 
LEGISLATION 
(Ms. DELBENE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DELBENE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of Federal pri-
vacy legislation. 
With 
every 
new 
app 
that 
is 
downloaded or website that is used, 
people run the risk of turning over 
their most sensitive personal data 
without even knowing it. 
Right now, consumers are left with 
virtually no rights or protections. We 
have seen the damage done by the 
Facebook Cambridge Analytica scan-
dal, yet there has been zero action 
from Congress. This is unacceptable. 
I believe we can and must have a na-
tional data privacy law that gives con-
sumers control over their data and 
that sets fair rules of the road for busi-
nesses to comply. 
I introduced H.R. 2013, the Informa-
tion Privacy and Personal Data Protec-
tion Act, which would address both. I 
urge my colleagues to take up this 
issue to make it a priority and work 
with me in moving this legislation for-
ward. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL GUN 
VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK 
(Mr. CLAY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLAY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of National Gun 
Violence Survivors Week. 
When gun violence occurs in a com-
munity, lives are too often lost, but for 
survivors, 
the 
neighborhoods 
they 
know and love are never the same. 
This is especially true when gun vio-
lence impacts our young people. De-
spite the terrible loss of so many young 
lives in my district last year, I see 
hope in the messages from their peers. 
I recently heard from some high 
school students who shared their sto-
ries and support for a bill I introduced 
with Congresswoman ROBIN
KELLY, 
H.R. 3435, the Local Public Health and 
Safety Act, to empower local commu-
nities to address gun violence. 
These students believe we can make 
changes to heal our communities and 
prevent future tragedies. I agree and 
join them in a renewed call to action 
on behalf of survivors everywhere.

HONORING 
COURAGEOUS 
SUR-
VIVORS OF GUN VIOLENCE WHO 
ARE FIGHTING FOR CHANGE 
(Ms. ESHOO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, this is 
National 
Gun 
Violence 
Survivors 
Week, and I rise today to honor the 
many courageous survivors of gun vio-
lence across our country who are fight-
ing for change.

ple, including a majority of gun own-
ers,

checks. They know this policy will help 
keep guns out of the hands of crimi-
nals. 
The 
current 
system 
has 
already 
stopped 3 million gun sales to con-
victed felons and others who are pro-
hibited by law from owning a firearm, 
but we can and must do more. 
The good news is that, a year ago 
this month, the new majority in the 
Congress took up two bills to establish 
universal background checks, includ-
ing H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background 
Checks Act. Sadly, the Senate refuses 
to take up these bills, and with every 
day that passes, 96 Americans are 
killed by guns. 
Today, we remember the over 100,000 
survivors who have been injured by 
guns and are every day, those that we 
have lost, and the countless other 
Americans who are affected by gun vio-
lence in our country. We should never 
rest until Congress takes every action 
to address this. 
f 
DON’T BE FOOLED 
(Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam 
Speaker, the new Medicaid proposal 
from the White House is a reverse 
Robin Hood on steroids, a coordinated 
effort to steal from the poor and give 
to the rich campaign donors at Mar-a- 
Lago and other places. 
This White House has put Medicaid 
on the chopping block, Medicaid, the 
program specifically put in place to 
provide healthcare to our most vulner-
able citizens, our seniors, our veterans, 
the working poor, and their children. 
My Republican colleagues will tell 
you, no, this is merely about giving 
States greater flexibility. That is non-
sense. Federal law already gives States 
flexibility. This is about taking away 
healthcare to pay for their tax cuts. 
This is the latest in the GOP’s long 
war on the working people and the poor 
people of this country. They have cut 
the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-
gram. They have cut food stamps. And 
now they are cutting Medicaid. 
Don’t be fooled. This has long been in 
their plan.

GUN 
VIOLENCE 
CONTINUES 
TO 
BRING AGONY TO COMMUNITIES 
AND FAMILIES 
(Mr. VARGAS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, like 
many of my colleagues, I rise today in 
support of National Gun Violence Sur-
vivors Week. 
Every year, over 36,000 Americans are 
killed in acts of gun violence, and al-
most 100,000 more are shot and injured. 
This includes nearly 3,000 children and 
teens who are shot and killed and near-
ly 15,600 who are shot and injured. 
Firearms are the second leading 
cause of death for children and teens 
and the first leading cause of death for 
African American children and teens in 
the U.S. 
Gun violence overly affects people of 
color. African Americans represent 
most gun homicide victims and are 10 
times more likely than White Ameri-
cans to die from gun violence. 
Gun violence continues to bring 
agony every day to communities and 
families around the country. While we 
cannot bring back the many loved ones 
lost to gun violence, we must act to 
prevent more casualties. It is past time 
for the Senate to act to save American 
lives.

RECOGNIZING GUN VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS WEEK 
(Mr. MOULTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, 2 
years ago, I was standing at a rally 
where the father of a gunshot victim, a 
father who lost his son to gun violence, 
spoke of all the things that he and oth-
ers are doing to stop this senseless 
scourge, things that they are already 
doing. 
But then he turned to the crowd, and 
he said, ‘‘But what is Congress doing?’’ 
And tens of thousands of people, as if 
they had rehearsed it a hundred times, 
all said, together, ‘‘Nothing.’’ 
‘‘But what is Congress doing?’’ 
‘‘Nothing.’’ 
Madam Speaker, for too long, Con-
gress has done nothing. We have passed 
bills here in the House that take the 
right steps, but this alone is not 
enough. The Senate needs to do their 
job, and we need to make them law. 
Thoughts and prayers won’t cut it, 
only action saves lives.

ADMINISTRATION’S LACK OF 
DIVERSITY IN ITS ACTIONS 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I am 
concerned about the lack of diversity, 
the lack of care about diversity that 
this administration shows in its ap-
pointments and its actions. 
In the Federal judiciary, the Presi-
dent has appointed approximately 250 
judges, 6 of whom are African Amer-
ican. That is a disturbing and chilling 
number. 
In a Super Bowl ad, he showed Alice 
Marie Johnson, whom he gave execu-
tive clemency to, a commutation, and 
said he was trying to help people who 
looked like her, an African American 
woman. 
He has given two executive clem-
encies to African Americans. One was 
Jack Johnson, posthumous, dead for 80 
years. Only one living African Amer-
ican has gotten a commutation, and 
that was when Kim Kardashian cham-
pioned her case, as Sylvester Stallone 
championed that of Jack Johnson. 
During his speech, he talked about 
the Tuskegee Airman, the woman who 
he said would get a scholarship, the 
young girl. The fact is he just ap-
pointed a TVA Board, Tennessee Valley 
Board, 
nine 
members—no 
African 
Americans, one woman. 
The lack of diversity is chilling. 
America is diverse. It is our strength. 
We need to embrace it and not have an 
all White world.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, 
on Wednesday, the Rules Committee 
met and reported a rule, House Resolu-
tion 833, providing for consideration of 
three measures: H. Res. 826, Expressing 
Disapproval of the Trump Administra-
tion’s Harmful Actions Towards Med-
icaid; H.R. 5687, the Emergency Supple-
mental Appropriations for Disaster Re-
lief and Puerto Rico Disaster Tax Re-
lief Act; and, finally, H.R. 2474, the 
Protecting the Right to Organize Act. 
The rule provides for H. Res. 826 to be 
considered under a closed rule, with 1 
hour of debate equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce. 
The rule further provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 2474 under a structured 
rule, with 1 hour of debate equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
the ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Education and Labor. 
The rule self-executes the manager’s 
amendment 
from 
Chairman 
SCOTT 
making in order 16 amendments and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
Finally, the rule provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 5687 under a structured 
rule, with 1 hour of debate equally di-
vided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations. The rule 
makes in order six amendments and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
Madam Speaker, before us today, we 
have three measures that all speak to 
one very, very important topic in 
America today. That topic is inequal-
ity. 
Madam Speaker, Justice Louis Bran-
deis once famously said: In this coun-
try, we can either have democracy or 
we can have the concentration of 
wealth in the hands of very few, but we 
can’t have both. 
Unfortunately, right now in this 
country, we are at historic levels of in-
equality. A handful of families control 
more wealth than the bottom 50 per-
cent of Americans—160 million Ameri-
cans. Forty percent of lower income 
Americans make $30,000 a year. The top 
1 percent in income—not wealth, but in 
income—earn over $7 million a year, 
while the other 99 percent earn on an 
average of $54,000 a year. 
We cannot have this level of inequal-
ity. 
President Abraham Lincoln famously 
said that labor and capital must al-
ways be balanced in America to have 
democracy. And he said: 
If capital ever had the control over labor, 
democracy would cease to exist. 
From the pearls of wisdom of people 
like Lincoln and Brandeis, we are 
warned again today that we have to 
have countervailing institutions, as 
John Galbraith said, between labor and 
capital. This is in the best interests of 
everyone, including those who are 
making and reaping exorbitant benefits 
from the current inequality. 
But most importantly—most impor-
tantly—as Brandeis said, you cannot 
have democracy with the current situa-
tion of inequality. 
Not only is this inequality wrong, 
but its consequences in our everyday 
lives, like worse health outcomes, dis-
eases of depression, behavioral health 
impacts, 
and 
economic 
insecurity, 
these public health instances are di-
rectly correlated to income inequality 
as demonstrated by the landmark 
work, ‘‘The Spirit Level,’’ 10 years ago. 
The first resolution that is part of 
this rule expresses strong disapproval 
of the Trump administration’s recent 
attempt to turn Medicaid into a block 
grant. 
Medicaid is our Nation’s promise to a 
group left behind by rampant inequal-
ity that will help provide basic services 
to protect their health and well-being— 
basic services. The Trump administra-
tion proposal doubles down on its cruel 
policies that put cost savings over life 
savings. 
The second bill provides disaster re-
lief to Puerto Rico. This is a commu-
nity that has been devastated repeat-
edly by disasters, exposing the inequal-
ity not only in Puerto Rico, but be-
tween this administration’s treatment 
of a territory versus a State. Puerto 
Rico needs our help. Without it, roads 
will remain unpassable, schools will re-
main closed, and the poor will become 
poorer. 
And, finally, we have the Protecting 
the Right to Organize, the PRO Act. 
President Eisenhower once said that 
only a fool would attempt to block a 
working man or woman, an American 
worker, from joining a labor union. 
President Eisenhower said this, a Re-
publican President, much admired. 
This was at a time where America 
had the largest expansion in our his-
tory, and the world’s expansion, grow-
ing at over 6 percent of GDP a year 
that everybody benefited from. One 
year was 13 percent. At that time, one 
in three American workers were in a 
labor union. 
By the time Ronald Reagan became 
President, one in four Americans was 
in a labor union. By the time President 
Reagan left office, 1 in 10 American 
workers were in a labor union. 
The balance between labor and cap-
ital is the essence of American democ-
racy. It is unbalanced and risks our de-
mocracy at this moment. 
The ability for American workers to 
organize and have a voice in the out-
comes, not just of their work, but of 
their retirement and the benefit to 
their families and communities, has 
been attacked since President Reagan 
was in office.

in union membership. By most esti-
mates, 
declining 
unionization 
ac-
counted for about a third of the in-
crease in inequality of which I speak in 
the 1980s and 1990s. 
To address inequality, you have to 
include working people. You have to 
include the right to organize. Labor 
unions are universally recognized as 
providing major boosts to employees’ 
wages and benefits. Sadly, the best evi-
dence we have on this trend is by com-
paring union States like the one I am 
proud to represent, California, to right- 
to-work States. 
In 1979, States with historically high 
levels of union membership, like in the 
Northeast and the Rust Belt, saw rel-
atively low rates of income inequality. 
Just the opposite held true for right- 
to-work States. If you watched data 
over the years since the 1970s as States 
move as a group toward less union cov-
erage, those same States have much 
worse inequality and poor performing 
GDP. 
Unions not only raise wages for 
workers they represent, but they also 
have been shown to moderate com-
pensation for executives. On top of all 
the obvious benefits you think of that 
are associated with labor unions like 
higher wages and safer workplaces, 
some of the others that come along 
with union membership also help ad-
dress the inequities in our society. 
Union workers are more likely to re-
ceive paid leave, are up to 28 percent 
more likely to have employer-spon-
sored health insurance and are up to 54 
percent more likely to be enrolled in 
employer-sponsored pensions. 
Not only do workers have better ac-
cess to pensions, but their employers 
contribute an average of 28 percent 
more toward those pensions than non-
union employers. 
The PRO Act simply updates labor 
laws, labor laws that have been at-
tacked for 30 years, to ensure that 
workers in today’s economy are able to 
create and join labor unions to receive 
the same kinds of protections they see 
in other sectors. Nothing more. 
Madam Speaker, I suspect we will 
hear a lot of misinformation—espe-
cially about the PRO Act—from our 
colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle. Make no mistake about it, 
Madam Speaker, these three bills will 
help restore power to the people, which 
the administration repeatedly has tried 
to strip power from. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from California 
for yielding me the customary 30 min-
utes, and I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, today’s rule pro-
vides for consideration of three unre-
lated measure, each of which have lit-
tle chance of passing the Senate or be-
coming law. The one is a nonbinding 
messaging resolution, another one a 
partisan labor bill, and the third pro-
vides billions of dollars in Federal aid 
for 
disaster 
recovery 
from 
recent 
earthquakes in Puerto Rico, but actu-
ally can be distributed to meet unmet 
needs in other States. 
Let’s talk first about the resolution 
expressing disapproval for the Trump 
administration’s Healthy Adult Oppor-
tunity demonstration project that was 
just announced on January 30. 
A letter provided by the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services to 
State Medicaid directors detailed an 
option for States to apply for increased 
flexibility under the section 1115 for 
Medicaid waivers. 
The Healthy Adult Opportunity dem-
onstration 
provides 
States 
with 
a 
choice as to how they would like to re-
ceive their funding for adults under the 
age of 65 who are covered by a Medicaid 
expansion population. 
This does not include children. This 
does not include pregnant women. It 
does not include individuals with dis-
abilities, or the elderly. 
This only applies to healthy adults 
who are not covered as part of the tra-
ditional Affordable Care Act popu-
lation, and if, and only if, the States 
decide to pursue the Healthy Adult Op-
portunity. 
H. Res. 862 is a political statement 
made to diminish the efforts of the 
Trump administration. It is unreason-
able and unrealistic for Democrats to 
declare this demonstration an attack 
on Medicaid after only a few days since 
the release of the plan. 
Do we have a full understanding of 
the opportunity grants? So I strongly 
suggest Members on both sides of the 
aisle speak with their Governors and 
their counterparts in State legislatures 
to ask about this option. 
My office did indeed speak with our 
Texas Governor this week. The State is 
still unpacking everything that the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services may provide, and this may not 
be an option Texas will take, but it is 
up to them. They are currently run-
ning internal analyses to come to a 
conclusion, a process that does take 
some time. 
Recognizing 
this, 
there 
is 
little 
chance that the Senate will agree to 
this messaging resolution. A far better 
approach would have been for us to 
have, perhaps, a hearing and a markup 
in our committee of jurisdiction. 
Unfortunately, not everyone agreed 
with that. 
H.R. 2474, the PRO Act, has a simi-
larly low chance of being considered by 
the Senate. The bill is nothing more 
than a requirement that workers be-
come members of labor unions. Repub-
licans support the right of employees 
to form a labor union, but it should be 
a choice for every individual worker. 
There is a card-check system in-
cluded in this bill. Employees will no 
longer enjoy the privacy of a secret 
ballot election. Organizers will be able 
to collect authorization cards covering 
50 percent of the bargaining unit and 
form a union without holding a secret 
election. 
In effect, employees are not pro-
tected from potential political intimi-
dation and not protected from coercive 
behavior by organizers in an effort to 
obtain the required number of cards. 
That is not free and voluntary 
choice. 
Against a recent National Labor Re-
lations Board decision, the bill rein-
states what are called micro unions, al-
lowing bargaining units smaller than a 
workplace if there is a community of 
interest. 
The joint employer standard is ex-
panded, creating liability for franchise 
owners, franchise owners who may 
have no direct relationship with the 
franchisee employee. This is not only 
unreasonable, it is impractical, and 
certainly will weaken or damage the 
franchise model of business. 
In addition, the bill preempts State 
right-to-work laws. My State is a 
right-to-work State. Does the Federal 
Government know Texas citizens bet-
ter than the State of Texas? This dis-
regards the rights of 27 States by over-
turning their right-to-work laws. 
Even more concerning, employers 
will be required to provide union orga-
nizers with an employee’s personal in-
formation without the employee’s con-
sent. 
In the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee we are in the middle of negoti-
ating both sides: What are the param-
eters, or what should be the param-
eters of a Federal privacy law? This 
provision in this bill flies in the face of 
protecting individuals’ privacy, and it 
is odd because in the committee, the 
other side seemed so eager to defend 
privacy in any other forum. 
Along with these partisan measures, 
we are also considering emergency dis-
aster funding for Puerto Rico. The sup-
plemental appropriation provides over 
$4 billion for cyber and energy secu-
rity, electricity restoration, education 
assistance, the Federal Highway Ad-
ministration, and the Community De-
velopment Block Grant. 
In recent years, Puerto Rico has 
faced multiple natural disasters, in-
cluding Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 
2017, and a series of earthquakes in 
January of this year. There is no doubt 
that Puerto Rico is facing a long road 
to recovery, but compounding the na-
tional disasters is a mismanagement of 
aid. 
Just a couple of weeks ago, a ware-
house was discovered full of emergency 
supplies. Some of them had been there 
since 2017. Citizens were outraged. 
They broke into the warehouse and 
took it upon themselves to distribute 
the aid. 
President Trump released nearly $16 
billion in aid funding in January but 
did place restrictions on usage to help 
prevent any squandering of Federal re-
sources. This bill provides additional 
billions in aid without any account-
ability measures. Existing disaster aid 
should 
be 
expended 
before 
appro-
priating billions of taxpayer dollars. 
And then here is the kicker: It may not 
go towards its intended recipients.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H862 
February 6, 2020 
Only a small portion of these funds 
are specifically directed to Puerto 
Rico. The rest may be applied to unmet 
needs of disasters in recent years. Yes, 
including Puerto Rico, but including 
many other States. 
FEMA has yet to complete its dam-
age assessment, and initial assess-
ments indicate $40 million in Federal 
costs, a much smaller amount than ap-
propriated in this bill. 
No one wants to deny any Americans 
support when they are in need, but this 
appropriation is premature. We could 
and should take the time to evaluate 
the best path for recovery for Puerto 
Rico, and we have the ability because 
there is existing disaster aid that has 
been released to meet those immediate 
needs. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
the rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, just a couple of 
points to my friend from Texas’ com-
ments. 
I include in the RECORD a February 2 
Washington 
Post 
article 
entitled: 
‘‘You’d 
think 
Trump 
would 
stop 
threatening 
insurance 
coverage 
by 
now. Think again.’’ 
[From the Washington Post, Feb. 2, 2020] 
YOU’D THINK TRUMP WOULD STOP THREAT-
ENING INSURANCE COVERAGE BY NOW. THINK 
AGAIN. 
(By the Washington Post Editorial Board) 
Notwithstanding 
the 
progress 
under 
Obamacare, the United States still does not 
provide health insurance to all of its popu-
lation. About 27.5 million people, or 8.5 per-
cent of the population, lacked coverage 
throughout 2018, according to the most re-
cent Census Bureau report published in Sep-
tember. The country has moved in the wrong 
direction since President Trump took office: 
The 2018 uninsured numbers were up over 
2017. 
You might think, given this history, that 
the Trump administration would cease pro-
posing policy that threatens coverage; well, 
think again. 
Mr. Trump’s Department of Health and 
Human Services has unveiled a proposal that 
would allow states to receive federal Med-
icaid funding as a block grant, annually ad-
justable for inflation, while implementing 
cost-cutting measures such as work require-
ments, asset tests, co-payments and pre-
scription drug limitations. (As a sweetener, 
states would be allowed to pocket some of 
the budgetary savings.) Existing rules essen-
tially require states to provide a set of serv-
ices to all those who meet federally estab-
lished criteria, and fund them on an open- 
ended basis. 
To be sure, the administration’s proposal 
would not affect traditional Medicaid popu-
lations such as low-income pregnant women 
and people with disabilities. It targets only 
the so-called expansion population—the 17 
million low-income adults who got Medicaid 
through Obamacare. And even then, it’s un-
likely it will be adopted in blue states with 
large Medicaid populations, such as Cali-
fornia, or in red states that never expanded 
Medicaid in the first place and probably 
won’t no matter how federal aid is struc-
tured, such as Texas. 
Where it might make a difference is in red 
states that reluctantly expanded Medicaid 
but are looking for ways scale it back, or in 
those 14 states that have not yet expanded 
but still want to do so in a limited way. An 
example of the latter category is Oklahoma, 
which is having a referendum on Medicaid 
expansion in November. That state’s Repub-
lican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who opposes the ref-
erendum, jumped at the administration’s 
offer. The proposal invokes—probably incor-
rectly—HHS’s statutory authority to adjust 
Medicaid’s core requirements, so its ulti-
mate fate may depend on the courts. A fed-
eral judge in Washington blocked previous 
attempts by the agency to let New Hamp-
shire, Kentucky and Arkansas set work re-
quirements for Medicaid, which cost 18,000 
people in the latter state their coverage, 
though the administration has appealed. 
(Kentucky has withdrawn its work require-
ments, which never took effect.) 
Whatever its short-term practical impact, 
the administration’s latest block-grant pro-
posal could be significant in the long run. 
The ultimate goal is to legitimize block- 
granting and the coverage reductions the ap-
proach almost certainly entails. Reduced 
coverage, it should be mentioned, was partly 
why Congress previously, and repeatedly, re-
jected Republican plans to block-grant Med-
icaid. The United States badly needs a sys-
tem of universal coverage that delivers serv-
ices more efficiently than the existing 
hodgepodge. In its determination to chip 
away at Obamacare’s compromise solution— 
Medicaid expansion—the Trump administra-
tion has revealed that it has other priorities. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, 
on the Medicaid block grants, I would 
just say, from my experience, as some-
one who was very involved in the adop-
tion of the ACA in the California State 
Senate, both chairing the committee of 
jurisdiction and being involved in what 
we look back on as a very successful 
rollout, doing the block grants sets the 
threshold lower than is necessary. Re-
member that the Federal thresholds 
are only a base level. States can put 
more contributions from the State and 
local level in, which we have done in 
California. It has been successful at 
getting millions of Californians into 
insurance, as opposed to being in indi-
gent care. 
On the organizing aspect, this has 
come up in the Rules Committee, the 
secret ballot and privacy. A reminder, 
as Chairman SCOTT said last night: Se-
cret ballot is still sacrosanct. It only 
comes up that it will not be if the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board sanctions 
the employer for violating organizing 
rules. 
Our research shows that 45 percent of 
employers threaten workers in meet-
ings, threaten them if they are trying 
to organize. Seventy-five percent of 
employers hire consultants to run 
antiunion campaigns, and one in five 
employees who try to organize their 
fellow workers get fired or threatened 
with termination. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
RASKIN), a distinguished member of the 
Rules Committee. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I want 
to thank Mr. DESAULNIER for his lead-
ership. I rise in very strong support of 
the PRO Act because it will restore the 
constitutional and civil rights of Amer-
ican citizens seeking to organize a 
union. 
We have to remember that the right 
to organize is rooted in the First 
Amendment of the Constitution which 
protects the right of the people to 
speak, to assemble, and to petition for 
a redress of grievances. 
All of these rights have been under 
severe attack over the last several dec-
ades of union busting and interference 
with the right of the people to organize 
into unions. 
There are three specific provisions I 
want to mention that will restore the 
constitutional rights of the people to 
organize. 
The first treats the violation of the 
right to organize like a violation of 
any other civil right in America. If 
your civil rights are violated based on 
race or based on gender, you have a 
right to go to court to sue for enforce-
ment of your rights and for compensa-
tion for violation of those rights. 
This PRO Act will give the same 
right to workers to go to court to en-
force their labor organizing rights. 
Right now, they have got to go through 
the National Labor Relations Board 
which has been stifled with bureauc-
racy and red tape. And right now, 
under the PRO Act, if it passes, you 
will have the right to go to court as 
well as to go to the NLRB in order to 
enforce your right to organize. 
b 1300 
Secondly, the PRO Act will end so- 
called captive audience speeches. Those 
are already illegal right now. Employ-
ers cannot herd all the workers into a 
big room and tell them why they have 
to vote for Donald Trump for President 
at the risk of perhaps earning the dis-
favor of the employer, being fired or 
demoted or whatever. But they can 
herd you into the room to tell you why 
unions are bad and why unions are a 
bad choice and predicting that the 
company will have to leave or lay off 
people if a union is voted in by the 
workers. 
This ends captive audience speeches. 
The union doesn’t have the right to 
herd all the workers into a room to 
propagandize them for the union; the 
employers should not have the right to 
herd all of them into a conference 
room to propagandize them against a 
union. 
Finally, the PRO Act will restore the 
First Amendment rights of workers or-
ganizing a union or in a union to sup-
port boycotts, strikes, and other labor 
actions by workers in other places. 
Amazingly, under the Taft-Hartley 
provisions and the way the labor law 
has grown up now, it is against the law 
for workers in a union to engage in sec-
ondary support and secondary boycotts 
and so on. This is a naked violation of 
the First Amendment rights of work-
ers. Unionized workers should have 
every same right to support boycotts 
and strikes of their fellow workers as 
anyone else. 
Madam Speaker, I do strongly sup-
port the PRO Act. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from

Kentucky (Mr. COMER), who is a valued 
member of the Education and Labor 
Committee. 
Mr. 
COMER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I have heard from 
business owners throughout my dis-
trict about the investments they are 
making in their businesses and hard-
working 
employees 
thanks 
to 
the 
strong economy ushered in by Presi-
dent Trump. We have seen companies 
establish education programs, provide 
bonuses to their employees, and rein-
vest in their communities as a result of 
our booming economic climate. Unfor-
tunately, the bill we are considering 
today 
would 
quickly 
erode 
this 
progress. 
As was made clear during the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor hearing 
and subsequent markup, the PRO Act 
would not serve the interests of indi-
vidual workers. By overriding States’ 
choices to enact right-to-work laws 
meant to curtail forced unionization, 
codifying harmful rulemakings from 
the previous administration regarding 
the definition and classification of em-
ployees, and increasing the prevalence 
of worker intimidation and privacy in-
fringement, the PRO Act is a maze of 
misguided and costly antiworker poli-
cies. 
To correct one of the countless issues 
with this legislation, I submitted an 
amendment to strike the provisions 
that would legalize secondary boycotts. 
Unions should not be empowered to 
target and economically harm sup-
pliers or business partners of a work-
place they are seeking to organize. 
Unfortunately, this and many other 
commonsense amendments were re-
jected by my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle during markup and 
again at the Rules Committee yester-
day. 
Notably, the PRO Act federalizes 
California’s ABC test limiting flexi-
bility 
and 
opportunity 
for 
entre-
preneurs in our modern economy and 
codifies the previous administration’s 
joint employer standard that would 
disrupt and fatally damage the fran-
chise model, harming thousands of 
small business owners across the Na-
tion. 
I recognize a business’s greatest asset 
is its workers. For this reason, I am 
solidly proworker and probusiness and 
want to continue our strong economic 
growth while also protecting the free-
doms of hardworking Americans. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Kentucky an 
additional 1 minute. 
Mr. COMER. Thankfully, this Demo-
cratic dream will meet a rude awak-
ening in the Senate, where it will not 
see the light of day, and President 
Trump has signaled he would veto. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume before I introduce our next 
speaker. 
I am a former small business owner 
who met a payroll for hundreds of peo-
ple in the restaurant business in Cali-
fornia. Our economy is the fifth largest 
economy in the world. There is lots of 
evidence showing that helping the em-
ployer and helping the consumer so 
they have more disposable income ac-
tually helps everyone. 
As far as the dual employer rule, all 
we are doing is trying to protect what 
has been in effect for decades and not 
have it diminished, so there should be 
no impact on franchisees. 
Lastly, the distinction I think that 
needs to be reiterated over and over 
again in light of the administration’s 
assertions about the economy is, yes, 
the GDP is growing, not as large as the 
President had promised, but it is not 
being spread out. 
As I mentioned in my opening com-
ments, 50 percent—150 million, 160 mil-
lion people—live on $30,000 a year. They 
don’t see the big benefit in what Wall 
Street gets. The average income is for 
the bottom 90 percent of Americans. It 
has increased just 1 percent from 1980 
to 2017, while all their other costs have 
gone up, most notably healthcare and 
education. Average incomes, on the 
other hand, for the wealthiest 1 percent 
have increased by 184 percent. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Connecticut 
(Ms. DELAURO). 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to speak in support of the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act, or 
the PRO Act. 
I am the daughter of a garment 
worker, so the fight for workers’ rights 
has always had a special place in my 
heart. My mother toiled every day in 
the sweatshops in New Haven, Con-
necticut, 
sewing 
shirt 
collars 
and 
dresses. And she was a pieceworker, 
which meant she got pennies on the 
dollar. As chair of the Appropriations 
Committee’s Labor, Health and Human 
Services, Education, and Related Agen-
cies Subcommittee, I work every day 
to ensure that her early struggles were 
not in vain. 
I am proud to be an original cospon-
sor of the PRO Act introduced by the 
chair of the committee, Congressman 
BOBBY SCOTT. It strengthens the rights 
of working people to come together in 
union to secure better wages and better 
working conditions. 
The single biggest economic chal-
lenge of our times is that people’s pay 
doesn’t keep up with their rising costs 
of healthcare, education, and childcare. 
From 1980 to 2017, average incomes for 
the bottom 90 percent of households 
stagnated to a 1.1 percent increase 
while skyrocketing more than 180 per-
cent for the wealthiest 1 percent in this 
country. It is no coincidence that, at 
the same time, union membership fell 
to a record low of 10 percent. 
Economists at Princeton found that 
the alarming rise of income inequality 
since the 1970s can be at least partially 
attributed to the decline in union 
membership. 
The PRO Act is about leveling the 
playing field for working people. It pe-
nalizes predatory corporations that 
violate workers’ rights and streamlines 
procedures at the National Labor Rela-
tions Board to more effectively deal 
with violations. It protects workers 
from 
being 
misclassified 
as 
inde-
pendent contractors. It helps working 
people secure a winning agreement as 
part of a union. It protects union elec-
tions against interference. And it em-
powers unions and employers to nego-
tiate agreements that collect fair share 
fees. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Con-
necticut an additional 30 seconds. 
Ms. DELAURO. It establishes a medi-
ation and arbitration process to help 
ensure corporations and newly formed 
unions reach a first contract. 
As Nobel-winning economist Joseph 
Stiglitz has said: Inequality is not in-
evitable. It is about the public policy 
choices we make. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
it 
is 
not 
globalization, and it is not technology. 
We have the opportunity today to 
choose a public policy that, in fact, 
will defend and protect working people 
in this country. 
Madam Speaker, pass the PRO Act. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to immediately con-
sider a resolution reinforcing policies 
that are part of the ‘‘best is yet to 
come’’ blueprint, which was outlined 
by President Trump in this very Cham-
ber on Tuesday night in his historic 
and optimistic State of the Union Ad-
dress. 
His address highlighted the increase 
in wages for American workers, the de-
crease in unemployment, the reduction 
in the number of those receiving nutri-
tion assistance, and the strength of our 
Armed Forces. He went on to detail the 
ongoing efforts to decrease healthcare 
costs 
and 
to 
improve 
access 
to 
broadband and the continuing defense 
of our borders, among other priorities. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of the 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. RIGGLEMAN) to speak on 
his amendment. 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H864 
February 6, 2020 
the ‘‘best is yet to come’’ blueprint 
during the State of the Union Address. 
This agenda is an optimistic plan to 
continue the record-setting economic 
growth we are seeing and provide solu-
tions to problems that ail American 
citizens. It is imperative that Congress 
step forward and support this agenda 
as I do. 
It is an agenda that dramatically 
lowers prescription drug prices and 
raises wages for hardworking Ameri-
cans, an agenda that will build an in-
clusive society and make sure every 
young American has the opportunity 
to achieve the American Dream, and an 
agenda that will ensure every citizen 
can have access to high-speed internet, 
including in rural areas. 
With a national unemployment rate 
of 3.5 percent and a Virginia unemploy-
ment rate of 2.6 percent, it is clear the 
economic policies the President has 
implemented are working. The ‘‘best is 
yet to come’’ blueprint will continue 
this growth and build upon it. 
The American economy is stronger 
than ever, and we should work to con-
tinue this growth. 
I have a district that is 10,000 square 
miles large, bigger than the State of 
New Jersey. Seeing the optimism and 
excitement in Virginia and Virginia’s 
Fifth District is something to behold. 
We have built an inclusive economy 
where the least well-off are making 
some of the fastest gains and unem-
ployment is at an all-time low. 
There is no doubt that we are in the 
midst of a blue-collar boom in this 
country. Those who support the pre-
vious question are opposing the eco-
nomic boom. That is why I will be vot-
ing against the previous question. 
A vote against the previous question 
is a vote for lowering the number of 
impoverished 
Americans 
on 
food 
stamps. A vote against the previous 
question is a vote to continue the 
booming economic growth we have ex-
perienced. A vote against the previous 
question is a vote for enacting all these 
policies into law and furthering Presi-
dent Trump’s agenda. 
Madam Speaker, I urge defeat of the 
previous question so that we can con-
sider my resolution and support the 
policies outlined in the ‘‘best is yet to 
come’’ policy blueprint. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY). 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my good friend from California 
for his leadership, especially in bring-
ing before us the Protecting the Right 
to Organize Act of 2019. 
Right now, in my home State, the 
Virginia General Assembly is engaged 
in a big debate about whether to repeal 
the right-to-work laws that have domi-
nated our State for so many years, a 
repeal I have long supported. 
That is why, today, I am proud to 
stand with my good friend and fellow 
Virginian, Chairman BOBBY SCOTT, in 
supporting this bill, the Protecting the 
Right to Organize Act. 
Unions have been the backbone of a 
just and equitable economy. Their hard 
work gave us the 5-day workweek. 
Their hard work gave us safer working 
conditions. Their hard work helps de-
liver fair wages and better access to 
healthcare. But this isn’t just an eco-
nomic issue. It is also a question of 
civil rights. Society itself is freer when 
workers are empowered to band to-
gether and negotiate for better pay, 
benefits, and working conditions. 
I might say, even in those States 
that are not right-to-work States, it is 
hard to organize, but when you impose 
a right-to-work law, then you have 
really stacked the odds in the ability of 
working men and women to organize 
themselves. 
This is Black History Month, and I 
am reminded of these words from Dr. 
Martin Luther King: ‘‘In our glorious 
fight for civil rights, we must guard 
against being fooled by false slogans, 
such as ‘right-to-work.’ . . . Wherever 
these laws have been passed, wages are 
lower, job opportunities are fewer, and 
there are no civil rights. We do not in-
tend to let them do this to us. We de-
mand this fraud be stopped. Our weap-
on is our vote.’’ 
Dr. King was right. Our weapon is our 
vote, and today, we are going to exer-
cise that weapon and strike a blow for 
working men and women and for re-
storing the constitutional right of 
working men and women to organize 
freely and benefit this economy and 
benefit the quality of lives for people 
in communities all across this great 
land. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
from California for giving me the time. 
I urge passage of the bill, and I support 
the rule underlying it. 
b 1315 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire as to how much time I have 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 16 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Cali-
fornia has 101⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, one of the under-
lying bills here, H. Res. 826, is really 
nothing more than a political exercise, 
and I really am disappointed at how we 
have come to discuss the healthier 
adult opportunity demonstration, in 
the manner that it is. 
If we were to have a legitimate de-
bate on an optional policy, we should 
do so in a hearing in the committee of 
jurisdiction. That is why the Com-
mittee on Energy and Commerce, Re-
publican leader WALDEN and me sent a 
letter to Chairman PALLONE to request 
such a hearing. 
We should be asking questions of 
agencies and States that are deciding 
whether or not they would like to uti-
lize this option to deploy the new sec-
tion 1115 waiver for this very specific 
population. 
Should a State choose to apply for 
this Healthy Adult Opportunity dem-
onstration, it will only be allowed to 
address the adults that are under 65 
that fall into the expansion population. 
This optional demonstration changes 
nothing for children. It changes noth-
ing for seniors, changes nothing for in-
dividuals with disabilities. All essen-
tial health benefit requirements re-
main in place. 
Most importantly, States do not have 
to take this option because it is an op-
tion. States can maintain the status 
quo and continue to operate their Med-
icaid programs as they were before this 
opportunity was presented to them. 
Some States may find this demonstra-
tion provides the necessary increased 
flexibility for them to handle the lim-
ited healthy adult population that is 
now covered under Medicaid expansion. 
In fact, under one of the financing 
mechanisms, if a State does not spend 
all of its Federal allotment under the 
Healthy Adult Opportunity demonstra-
tion, it can keep 25 to 50 percent of the 
savings not to transfer over to the road 
and bridge fund, but to reinvest in 
Medicaid. In the States that might be 
ravished by an opioid epidemic, that 
could mean getting more individuals 
with opioid use disorder into treat-
ment. 
It could allow States additional flexi-
bility to help their most vulnerable 
populations. And we heard very com-
pelling testimony in the Rules Com-
mittee last night from the gentle-
woman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS) about the unconscionably long 
waiting list for individuals with dis-
abilities to get coverage under Med-
icaid. 
Madam Speaker, 700,000 people across 
the country are on that waiting list. 
These shared savings could go in to re-
ducing that case backlog for those indi-
viduals. 
Look, this may not be an opportunity 
that every State wants to take. That is 
why it is optional. That is what op-
tional means. My State, the State of 
Texas, is working through whether or 
not this would be beneficial, a bene-
ficial demonstration opportunity for 
them. There is a lot to look at in the 
rule that was produced by the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services. 
After all, it was just a week ago that 
this was received, and people are look-
ing into whether or not it makes sense 
for them. 
But we, in this body, should take the 
time to understand this, rather than 
simply jump to a conclusion with an 
action that is ultimately going to be 
meaningless because it goes nowhere. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman from Califor-
nia’s Eleventh District. I also thank, if 
I may, the persons who are associated

tirelessly to get these bills to the floor. 
And I also thank the House leadership 
for allowing the bills to come to the 
floor. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored today 
to say that I traveled to Puerto Rico 
after one of the hurricanes hit, Hurri-
cane Maria. I was there with the Hon-
orable BENNIE THOMPSON. This was a 
Homeland Security codel. And while I 
was there, I had the opportunity to 
meet with various and sundry NGOs, 
met with some of the emergency re-
sponders, the Corps of Engineers, the 
National Guard. 
I had a firsthand opportunity to see 
the devastation that Puerto Rico suf-
fered from. And this was prior to the 
6.7 earthquake that hit on January 7. 
Madam Speaker, I believe that it is 
time for us to act. I believe this legis-
lation provides the means by which we 
can 
act 
appropriately 
and 
effica-
ciously. I believe that this bill, with 
what it contains from my bill, H.R. 
3702, which was the CDBG-DR, disaster 
recovery bill, this legislation contains 
language from that, my bill, and I 
would like to just share some of the 
things that are important. 
The 
bill 
includes 
the 
rigorous 
timelines for allocation action plan ap-
proval and grant agreement execution 
that was contained in the bill. It con-
tains language that HUD will be re-
quired to allocate funds no later than 
60 days after enactment of the supple-
mental. HUD would be required to re-
view and approve or disapprove an ac-
tion plan within 60 days of its submis-
sion to the Department, and HUD will 
be required to allocate funds no later 
than 60 days after the date of approval 
of a grantee’s plan. 
Madam Speaker, I think we have 
reached a point now where an emer-
gency has become something that we 
must act upon immediately, if not 
sooner. The sooner would be today, but 
unfortunately, we will have the rule 
today. Immediately will be the vote to-
morrow. I beg that all would support 
the bill. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Iowa (Mr. KING). 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentleman from Texas 
yielding to me. 
I rise in opposition to this rule. And 
I have a whole stack of things that I 
will raise, but in the time that is avail-
able, I will say this: We watched as the 
Medicaid program was opened up more 
and more under President Obama. And 
when that happened, it caused a sig-
nificant amount of turmoil in my State 
and many States across the country. 
And so President Trump has stepped 
in and decided that he is going to offer 
an opportunity to have the equivalent 
of block grants going back to the 
States and let them make the decision, 
let them write the regulations because 
the States know best. 
This great experiment in Federalism 
that we have, where the closer to the 
people that the decision can be made, 
the more effective that decision is and 
the more effective the resources of our 
taxpayers are. That is the attempt and 
the endeavor on the part of President 
Trump, and I regret that so much poli-
tics have been churned into this, we 
have a hard time focusing on the pol-
icy. 
When I see what happened at the 
prayer breakfast, and when I listened 
to the statement that has been made 
by the Speaker publicly in a conference 
a little earlier today, it spills forth 
upon this. Some of her words essen-
tially show up in this document. 
Madam Speaker, it is time for us to 
take a deep breath. Impeachment is 
over. Let’s focus on policy. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON), dis-
tinguished member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to rise in support of the PRO 
Act. This much-needed legislation re-
balances the economic playing field to 
give workers a fair shake, and it is long 
overdue. 
Two nights ago, the President stood 
here and talked about how great the 
economy is doing, how the stock mar-
ket is soaring, and unemployment is 
falling. But the truth on the ground is 
that people in the middle class and 
below are not being lifted by this tide. 
The cost of housing, childcare, edu-
cation, and other basic essentials are 
rising at rates not matched by stag-
nant wages. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a report by the Foundation for 
Delaware 
County 
and 
Philadelphia 
Citizens For Children and Youth. 
UNDERWATER: WHAT’S SINKING FAMILIES IN 
DELAWARE COUNTY 
[From PCCY, Public Citizens for Children 
and Youth, Mar. 2019] 
The American Dream is eroding in Dela-
ware County. Incomes that used to provide a 
comfortable middle class life are no longer 
enough to even cover the basics. Four in ten 
families are likely to be underwater if 
they’re raising children. Their financial out-
look is bleak—a far cry from the prosperity 
that their parents enjoyed. And if things 
continue down this road, their children face 
a future of continued decline. 
Hard-working families earning $50,000, for 
instance, are likely to be more than $3,000 in 
debt between child care, health care, hous-
ing, 
utilities, 
transportation, 
food, 
and 
taxes. And that’s with the help of crucial 
child care and health insurance benefits. 
Even if these families have no child care 
needs, they will have less than $7,000 left 
over after paying for the other essentials. 
That’s under $7,000 for things like clothes, 
sports teams, birthday presents, summer 
camps, class trips—just to name a few. Near-
ly a quarter of families earn this much or 
less in Delaware County. 
Even families who are near the median in-
come—an income that should solidify their 
middle class status—are drowning. Families 
making $75,000 a year, for example, are likely 
to be saddled with over $2,000 in debt after 
paying for the basics, since they do not re-
ceive subsidies for child care and health 
care. If these families are free from the bur-
den of child care, they would have around 
$15,000 left after the major basic costs, but 
this is still hardly enough to cover the addi-
tional everyday costs for the children and 
parents. On top of that, these families have 
little money, if any, to save for things like 
retirement or college for their children, not 
to mention any emergency costs that may 
spring up. Nearly 40% of families in Dela-
ware County make this much or less. 
The parents in these struggling families 
bank on the hope that their children can 
move up the economic ladder, becoming 
more prosperous as adults than they, the 
parents, were. The surest way for children to 
achieve that upward mobility is to get a 
good education. Unfortunately, many Dela-
ware County schools are in a similar boat as 
many families, struggling to find the re-
sources to provide students with the skills 
they need to be upwardly mobile. 
The mandated costs of pensions, special 
education and charter school payments are 
skyrocketing, growing by $223 million in 
Delaware County school districts since 2010. 
Meanwhile State funding for these districts 
has grown by just $107 million, forcing dis-
tricts to make up the difference through 
local property tax increases. Even with these 
tax increases, most districts are unable to 
get more money in the classroom. 
The funding challenges translate to aca-
demic struggle. The majority of students in 
the county—58%—fail the math PSSA, and 
39% fail in reading. These figures are even 
worse in the districts with high shares of low 
income students, where 75% of students fail 
the math exam and 52% fail in reading. 
The bleak situation facing Delaware Coun-
ty families will only change with large-scale 
action. History teaches us that bold policies 
can overcome massive problems facing soci-
ety and lead to huge gains in the quality of 
life for all. As Nobel Prize-winning econo-
mist Paul Romer notes in discussing these 
types of policy changes, ‘‘[If we have a] sense 
of ‘we’ve got to do the right thing’ . . . ev-
erything can turn out better for everybody. 
But if you just are complacent, say ‘it’ll 
work itself out,’ you are not going to be 
happy with the outcome.’’ Delaware County 
families cannot afford complacency. The fol-
lowing policies must be implemented, or the 
cycle of financial stress will never end. The 
children in these struggling families will be-
come the next generation of struggling fami-
lies. The American Dream will become the 
American Drain. 
To boost families’ incomes: 
Create a workforce development strategy 
to help people move into higher paying jobs. 
Increase the State government’s payments 
to agencies that employ low-wage, govern-
ment-funded professionals, such as Direct 
Support Professionals and child care work-
ers, so that wages are at least $15 an hour 
and ideally $18 an hour, to increase the abil-
ity of these professionals to stay above water 
while supporting a family. 
To reduce the child care and early edu-
cation cost burden: 
Increase funding for Child Care Works, 
Pre-K Counts and Head Start. 
Expand eligibility for Child Care Works. 
Implement full day kindergarten in all 
school districts. 
To reduce the health care cost burden: 
Expand eligibility for free and subsidized 
Children’s Health Insurance Program. 
Preserve the Affordable Care Act. 
To reduce the cost burden of other living 
expenses: 
Create 
more 
affordable 
transportation 
through mobility planning at the County 
level. 
Create affordable housing strategies at the 
County level. 
To reduce the tax burden on financially 
struggling families:

February 6, 2020 
Expand Pennsylvania’s Tax Forgiveness 
program to incomes of at least $75,000. 
Offset property taxes by increasing State 
funding for public schools. 
To improve the financial outlook of public 
schools: 
Increase State K–12 basic education and 
special education funding. 
Restore the State’s charter school reim-
bursement to school districts. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, ac-
cording to that report released in Octo-
ber, families in my district in Pennsyl-
vania are being left underwater due to 
the high cost of living and debt they 
are forced to incur in order to make 
ends meet in this economy. A family 
making the median income of $75,000 is 
likely to be $2,000 under water at year’s 
end. 
The middle class is shrinking, and it 
is clear to see why. The economic di-
vide in the United States has reached 
unprecedented levels, wealth is con-
centrated at the very top, and it is not 
trickling down. Workers have seen 
their rights stripped, their wages cut, 
and their dignity taken away. 
Over the past three decades the aver-
age income for the bottom 90 percent of 
families, increased by 1.1 percent. Dur-
ing this same period, the average in-
come for the wealthiest 1 percent near-
ly doubled. 
Put simply, workers responsible for 
wealth creation in this country are not 
seeing their fair share. Over that same 
30-year period, we have seen the per-
centage of American workers in unions 
steadily decline, not because people 
don’t want to join unions and take part 
in the higher average salaries and bet-
ter benefit structure they are likely to 
receive. No, it is a direct result of re-
lentless coordinating and well-funded 
antiunion attacks from corporations 
and special interests. 
Cynically 
misnamed 
right-to-work 
laws have harmed workers and their 
families. No one in this country is 
forced to join a union, but the fact is, 
states with higher numbers of union 
membership also have higher average 
salaries for all workers. 
This bill would weaken antilabor 
State laws and close other loopholes 
that corporations use to exploit work-
ers. The PRO Act will restore some 
fairness to the American economy and 
give workers a seat at the bargaining 
table they rightly deserve. It will in-
troduce meaningful and forceable pen-
alties for companies that violate work-
ers’ rights. No longer will companies be 
able to exploit employees’ labor, bet-
ting that a toothless NLRB will only 
give them a slap on the wrist. 
This bill would ensure that employ-
ees have the right to collectively bar-
gain with companies that control the 
terms and conditions of their employ-
ment. One of the misleading arguments 
being made against this bill is that it 
will affect privacy. That is not true. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly support 
this rule and the underlying bill, and I 
urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
port. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 2 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I just want to high-
light a few things. 
The gentleman from Virginia came 
and spoke about an amendment that 
will be offered if we defeat the previous 
question. 
As a consequence of that defeat of 
the previous question is the consider-
ation of the amendment offered by Mr. 
RIGGLEMAN. And some of the things 
that people need to understand is that, 
well, they will be voting against these 
things if they vote to approve the pre-
vious question: 
The acknowledgment that jobs and 
investment are coming into this coun-
try at a rate that has previously not 
been known. America is now energy- 
independent and energy jobs, like so 
many elements of our country, are at a 
record high. 
We are building an inclusive society 
that is making sure that every young 
American gets a great education and 
the opportunity to achieve the Amer-
ican Dream. That Congress wants to 
support our students and back the plan 
to offer vocational and technical edu-
cation to every single high school in 
America. 
In addition, the commitment to ac-
cess to high speed internet, including 
rural America, and the defense of reli-
gious liberty. 
Many of us worked the prayer break-
fast this morning and heard this an ad-
ditional time, but including the con-
stitutional right to pray in public 
schools. I just want people to be aware 
that if they defeat the previous ques-
tion, this is where we will be engaging. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, as 
usual, Trump says one thing here and 
does another. He continues his assault 
on healthcare—no protection for pre-
existing conditions, nothing done to 
lower prescription price-gouging, and 
even considering potential cuts to what 
they call ‘‘entitlements’’ and we call 
Medicare. 
Trump supports only junk insurance 
and junk ideas, like this crazy idea to 
block-grant Medicaid, which is a truly 
block-headed approach that will jeop-
ardize insurance coverage for 1 in 5 
Americans. 
In Texas, Medicaid is a safety net 
with more holes than net through 
which many needy Texans regularly 
fall. Much of the available assistance is 
critical to our seniors. Already slashed 
to the bone, Texas Medicaid does not 
have any more room for the kind of 
cuts that Trump is urging. Hospitals 
are struggling to stay afloat in many 
parts of the State. Healthcare pro-
viders, some of them go out of busi-
ness. And to the disgrace of the Lone 
Star State, we have almost 1 million 
children, more than in any other State 
in the Union, who lack any insurance 
access. 
Indeed, it is the Affordable Care Act 
that actually slowed Medicaid spend-
ing, but Republicans will have none of 
that. This landmark legislation tried 
to patch the holes in the safety net, 
but even when Texas was offered 100 
cents on the dollar from the Federal 
Government to extend Medicaid to 
some of its citizens, Texas refused to 
do that, and has continued to do so. 
Now this Trump block-headed ap-
proach would widen the coverage gap 
for 5 million people with disabilities 
and millions of children who suffer 
when their parents cannot get care. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield another 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Texas. 
Mr. DOGGETT. One of the advan-
tages of the Medicaid program is if 
more people require coverage during an 
economic downturn, or if costs go up 
because of a public health emergency, 
like coronavirus or an opioid epidemic, 
the Federal funding automatically in-
creases. If you have a stingy State Re-
publican government that caps it, that 
coverage will go down instead of up. 
What is out of control in America 
today is not Medicaid spending, but 
this unhinged President’s attempts to 
undermine healthcare access for as 
many Americans as he can do. 
Madam Speaker, let’s oppose it. 
b 1330 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
As I have stated many times over, 
the rule proposed by the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services is an 
option for States. It does in no way af-
fect or impact the mandatory safety 
net populations that are required to be 
covered under Medicaid. 
The population that was included in 
Medicaid expansion, in States that un-
derwent expansion, this is where the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services would provide those State 
Governors, those State legislatures, an 
option to consider a block grant if they 
desired. It is also written in the pro-
posed rule that they could opt for a 
per-beneficiary allotment, which might 
even impart additional flexibility. 
But one of the provisions of the rule, 
as has been proposed, is that, if there is 
a significant change—the State under-
goes a natural disaster or emergency— 
the block grant number can be ad-
justed. It is not something that is im-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

February 6, 2020 
over 50 percent of the world’s popu-
lation can now be considered middle 
class or above. That means, for the 
first time, a majority of the world’s 
population is above the poverty line. 
According to this article from Brook-
ings, worldwide, one person escapes ex-
treme poverty every second, and five 
people are entering the middle class 
per second. 
In the United States, the strength of 
our economy is partly based on pro- 
growth and pro-business policies, in-
cluding those policies included in the 
2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
Madam Speaker, I include the Brook-
ings article in the RECORD. 
[From Brookings, Sept. 27, 2018] 
A GLOBAL TIPPING POINT: HALF THE WORLD IS 
NOW MIDDLE CLASS OR WEALTHIER 
(By Homi Kharas and Kristofer Hamel) 
Something of enormous global significance 
is happening almost without notice. For the 
first time since agriculture-based civiliza-
tion began 10,000 years ago, the majority of 
humankind is no longer poor or vulnerable 
to falling into poverty. By our calculations, 
as of this month, just over 50 percent of the 
world’s population, or some 3.8 billion peo-
ple, live in households with enough discre-
tionary expenditure to be considered ‘‘mid-
dle class’’ or ‘‘rich.’’ About the same number 
of people are living in households that are 
poor or vulnerable to poverty. So September 
2018 marks a global tipping point. After this, 
for the first time ever, the poor and vulner-
able will no longer be a majority in the 
world. Barring some unfortunate global eco-
nomic setback, this marks the start of a new 
era of a middle-class majority. 
We make these claims based on a classi-
fication of households into those in extreme 
poverty (households spending below $1.90 per 
person per day) and those in the middle class 
(households spending $11–110 per day per per-
son in 2011 purchasing power parity, or PPP). 
Two other groups round out our classifica-
tion: vulnerable households fall between 
those in poverty and the middle class; and 
those who are at the top of the distribution 
who are classified as ‘‘rich.’’ 
Our ‘‘middle class’’ classification was first 
developed in 2010 and has been used by many 
researchers. While acknowledging that the 
middle class does not have a precise defini-
tion that can be globally applied, the thresh-
old we use in this work has the following 
characteristics: those in the middle class 
have some discretionary income that can be 
used to buy consumer durables like motor-
cycles, refrigerators, or washing machines. 
They can afford to go to movies or indulge in 
other forms of entertainment. They may 
take vacations. And they are reasonably con-
fident that they and their family can weath-
er an economic shock—like illness or a spell 
of unemployment—without falling back into 
extreme poverty. 
By classifying all households in the world 
into one of these four groups, using income 
and expenditure surveys from 188 countries, 
we are able to derive measures of the global 
distribution of income. Our social enterprise 
World Data Lab—the maker of World Pov-
erty Clock—has refined these estimates and 
created a new interactive data model to esti-
mate all income brackets for almost every 
country for every point in time until 2030 by 
combining demographic and economic data. 
A lot has been written about the world’s 
progress in reducing the number of people 
living in extreme poverty, as highlighted in 
the recent Goalkeepers report put out by the 
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. We be-
lieve that another story relates to the rapid 
emergence of the global middle class. This 
middle class story is probably bigger in 
terms of the number of people affected. In 
the world today, about one person escapes 
extreme poverty every second; but five peo-
ple a second are entering the middle class. 
The rich are growing too, but at a far small-
er rate (1 person every 2 seconds). 
Why does it matter that a middle-class tip-
ping point has been reached and that the 
middle class is the most rapidly growing seg-
ment of the global income distribution? Be-
cause the middle class drive demand in the 
global economy and because the middle class 
are far more demanding of their govern-
ments. 
Consider the structure of global economic 
demand. Private household consumption ac-
counts for about half of global demand (the 
other half is evenly split between investment 
and government consumption). Two-thirds of 
household consumption comes from the mid-
dle class. The rich spend more per person, 
but are too few in number to drive the global 
economy. The poor and vulnerable are nu-
merous, but have too little income to spend. 
For most businesses, the sweet spot to target 
is the middle class. This has long been true 
in individual advanced economies; it is now 
true on a global scale. 
Targeting the global middle class is not 
easy. The middle class like differentiated 
products, and their tastes will vary from 
country to country. The new middle class is 
predominantly Asian—almost nine in 10 of 
the next billion middle-class consumers will 
be Asian—but they are spread out in China, 
India, and South and South East Asia. It’s no 
accident that the latest Hollywood hit is 
Crazy Rich Asians or that Asian multi-
nationals are emerging that have built a do-
mestic brand and now look to compete 
abroad. 
The middle class is already the largest seg-
ment of demand in the global economy. What 
makes it interesting for business is that it is 
also the most rapidly growing segment, pro-
jected to reach some 4 billion people by end 
2020 and 5.3 billion people by 2030. Compared 
to today, the middle class in 2030 will have 1. 
7 billion more people, while the vulnerable 
group will have 900 million fewer people. 
Trends for the poor and the rich and more 
modest, at ¥150 million people and +100 mil-
lion, respectively. 
By our calculations, the middle-class mar-
kets in China and India in 2030 will account 
for $14.1 trillion and $12.3 trillion, respec-
tively, comparable in size to a U.S. middle- 
class market at that time of $15.9 trillion. 
In most countries, there is a clear relation-
ship between the fate of the middle class and 
the happiness of the population. According 
to the Gallup World Poll, new entrants into 
the middle class are noticeably happier than 
those stuck in poverty or in vulnerable 
households. Conversely, individuals in coun-
tries where the middle class is shrinking re-
port greater degrees of personal stress. The 
middle class also puts pressure on govern-
ments to perform better. They look to their 
governments to provide affordable housing, 
education, and universal health care. They 
rely on public safety nets to help them in 
sickness, unemployment or old age. But they 
resist efforts of governments to impose taxes 
to pay the bills. This complicates the poli-
tics of middle-class societies, so they range 
from autocratic to liberal democracies. 
Many advanced and middle-income countries 
today are struggling to find a set of politics 
that can satisfy a broad middle-class major-
ity. 
The tipping point in the world today offers 
opportunities for business but complications 
for policymakers. 
Mr. 
BURGESS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
labor unions were initially created to 
ensure fair wages and fair working con-
ditions for employees. Today, Ameri-
cans are more prosperous than ever. 
While I support the freedom of an in-
dividual to join a labor union, the ne-
cessity that required labor unions is 
waning as wages increase and, subse-
quently, union membership decreases. 
Why would we now pass a bill that is 
diametrically in opposition to the ben-
efits that have been enjoyed by this 
country? 
And, again, I would like to emphasize 
that State participation in the Healthy 
Adult Opportunity demonstration is 
optional. If this demonstration project 
does not fit the needs or the goals of a 
State Medicaid program, they do not 
have to participate. 
As the Republican leader of the En-
ergy 
and 
Commerce 
Health 
Sub-
committee, I believe conversations like 
this are best to occur at the committee 
level first, where Members can call wit-
nesses and have a serious discussion. 
Do you know what? Regular order 
can be your friend. It doesn’t appear 
that Democrats are taking this seri-
ously. 
Finally, Republicans remain com-
mitted to helping all Americans in 
need, including those in Puerto Rico, 
but a thorough evaluation of best and 
most accountable allocation of re-
sources is needed. We support our fel-
low Americans in Puerto Rico and will 
continue to find ways to ensure their 
recovery. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the previous question, ‘‘no’’ on the 
rule, ‘‘no’’ on the underlying measures, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I just want to thank everyone who 
came down and spoke on this impor-
tant issue. In my view, there is nothing 
more important. 
You don’t have to read the 600 pages 
in Thomas Piketty to know that the 
level of inequality in this country right 
now. And I acknowledge some of the 
improvements that globalism has given 
to people who earn $1 a day and are 
now up to the astronomical level of $2 
a day, but that has not benefited the 
American worker. 
As I said in my opening comments, 40 
percent of American households live on 
$30,000 a year. That is not helping ev-
erybody. Most of the benefits of the 
last 50 years went to the top 1 percent, 
people, as I said before, who earn—not 
own, earn—$7 million a year as opposed 
to the 99 percent below them who earn 
$54,000 a year. 
We have to fix this. This is not de-
mocracy, as Brandeis and Lincoln said. 
As Eisenhower said, when the economy 
was growing at historic records, as I 
mentioned in my opening statements. 
And this is how times have changed, 
particularly as a former Republican, 
former small business owner, former 
teamster, and former hotel and res-
taurant union member. Those jobs, 
that protection, gave me the money to

save enough money to go into business 
for myself and treat my employees as I 
would want to be treated, which helped 
my customers. 
Eisenhower said: 
Only a handful of reactionaries harbor the 
ugly thought of breaking unions and depriv-
ing working men and women of the right to 
join the union of their choice. 
President Eisenhower said: 
I have no use for those, regardless of their 
political party, who hold some vain and fool-
ish dream of spinning the clock back to days 
when organized labor was a huddled, almost 
helpless mass. 
Eisenhower said: 
Only a fool would try to deprive working 
men and women of the right to join the 
union of their choice. 
Lincoln said: 
All that harms labor is treason to Amer-
ica. 
Madam Speaker, for decades, tax 
breaks, rollbacks on regulations that 
benefited the ultrawealthy and power-
ful corporations, unfair labor laws and 
the enactment and enforcement of 
those laws, and the rise of monopolies 
have fueled inequality to the point 
where we are at Great Depression lev-
els, and we will suffer the consequences 
if we don’t address that in this room. It 
will be addressed outside of this room. 
We have an opportunity today to 
move this country in the right direc-
tion with these three measures. I urge 
a ‘‘yes’’ vote on the rule and the pre-
vious question. 
And I have two last quotes. Plutarch 
said, 2,000 years ago, that the oldest 
and fatal flaw to republics has always 
been the imbalance between the rich 
and the poor. 
Samuel Gompers, great union leader, 
when he was fighting to organize 
Americans during the Depression, said: 
Unions and equality, and until we get 
it, no surrender. 
The text of the material previously 
referred to by Mr. BURGESS is as fol-
lows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 833 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the resolution 
(H. Res. 834) supporting policies that are a 
part of the ‘‘Best is Yet to Come’’ blueprint, 
outlined by President Trump during his his-
toric, optimistic State of the Union Address. 
The resolution shall be considered as read. 
The previous question shall be considered as 
ordered on the resolution and preamble to 
adoption without intervening motion or de-
mand for division of the question except one 
hour of debate equally divided and controlled 
by the Majority and Minority Leaders or 
their designees. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall 
not apply to the consideration of House Res-
olution 834. 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time, and 
I move the previous question on the 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned. 
f 
RAISING A QUESTION OF THE 
PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to offer a question of the privileges 
of the House previously noticed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
DEGETTE). The Clerk will report the 
resolution. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
H. RES. 832 
Whereas, on December 20, 2019, Speaker 
Pelosi extended an invitation for President 
Trump to address a joint session of Congress 
on February 4, 2020; 
Whereas, on February 4, 2020, President 
Trump delivered his State of the Union ad-
dress, in which he honored the sacrifice of 
the following American heroes and their 
families: 
General Charles McGee, one of the last sur-
viving Tuskegee Airmen, who served in 
World War II, the Korean War, and the Viet-
nam War; 
Kayla Mueller, a humanitarian aid worker 
who was caring for suffering civilians in 
Syria when she was kidnapped, tortured and 
enslaved by ISIS for over 500 days before 
being murdered by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al- 
Baghdadi; 
Army Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake, 
who was killed while serving his second tour 
of duty in Iraq by a roadside bomb supplied 
by Iranian terrorist leader Qasem Soleimani; 
Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, 
who is currently serving his fourth deploy-
ment in the Middle East and his wife Amy, 
who works full time for the Army and de-
votes hundreds of hours helping military 
families; 
Whereas immediately following the ad-
dress, while still presiding over the joint ses-
sion, Speaker Pelosi ripped up an official 
copy of the President’s remarks, which con-
tained the names and stories of these patri-
ots who sacrificed so much for our country; 
and 
Whereas the conduct of Speaker Pelosi was 
a breach of decorum and degraded the pro-
ceedings of the joint session, to the discredit 
of the House: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives disapproves of the behavior of Speaker 
Pelosi during the joint session of Congress 
held on February 4, 2020. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution qualifies. 
MOTION TO TABLE 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I have 
a motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. HOYER moves that the resolution be 
laid on the table. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to lay the 
resolution on the table. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15- 
minute vote on the motion to table 
will be followed by 5-minute votes on: 
Ordering the previous question on 
House Resolution 833; and 
Adoption of House Resolution 833, if 
ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 224, nays 
193, not voting 12, as follows:

EXPRESSING 
DISAPPROVAL 
OF 
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S 
HARMFUL 
ACTIONS 
TOWARDS 
MEDICAID 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude any extraneous material on H. 
Res. 826, Expressing Disapproval of the 
Trump Administration’s Harmful Ac-
tions Towards Medicaid. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BLUMENAUER). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentleman from New 
Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
b 1430 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, pursu-
ant to House Resolution 833, I call up 
the resolution (H. Res. 826) expressing 
disapproval of the Trump administra-
tion’s harmful actions towards Med-
icaid and ask for its immediate consid-
eration. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 833, the resolu-
tion is considered read. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 826 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the House 
of Representatives that— 
(1) the illegal actions taken by the Trump 
administration to undermine the Medicaid 
program, including beneficiary protections, 
are a cruel attack on a program that pro-
vides for the health and well-being for some 
of our most vulnerable citizens; 
(2) the Trump administration should im-
mediately withdraw its illegal block grant 
guidance and cease its campaign to under-
mine and weaken Medicaid; and 
(3) the Trump administration should up-
hold its responsibility to faithfully execute 
the law, including the Medicaid Act, and 
cease any and all efforts that threaten the 
care of the millions of Americans who rely 
on Medicaid. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution shall be debatable for 1 hour, 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce. 
The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) and the gentleman from Or-
egon (Mr. WALDEN) each will control 30 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in 
support of H. Res. 826 expressing dis-
approval of the Trump administra-
tion’s harmful actions toward Med-
icaid. 
Last Thursday, the Trump adminis-
tration continued through its relent-
less campaign to sabotage the Afford-
able Care Act and its unprecedented at-
tack on Medicaid. Despite promising as 
a candidate that he would not cut Med-
icaid, the Trump administration pro-
posed just that last week. It has issued 
guidance that will allow States to 
block grant their Medicaid program. 
Just another day and another broken 
promise by this President. 
Unfortunately, like a lot of his other 
broken promises, this proposal could 
have devastating consequences on the 
health of millions of Americans, in-
cluding those affected by the opioid 
epidemic. 
One in five Americans have access to 
healthcare through Medicaid. Block 
grants limit the amount of Federal dol-
lars States receive, forcing them to cut 
benefits, cut payments to doctors, and 
tighten eligibility standards. 
The administration’s proposal is also 
illegal. Converting Medicaid to a block 
grant would require an act of Congress. 
Our Republican colleagues understand 
this, and that is why they included a 
Medicaid block grant provision in their 
failed attempt to repeal the ACA. 
Congressional Republicans know that 
block granting Medicaid is a seismic 
change in the program that requires a 
change in the law. I would hope that 
they would be concerned by this illegal 
action and would join us in sending a 
bipartisan message of disapproval to 
the Trump administration. 
I would also like to refute some 
claims that you are likely to hear dur-
ing this debate, Mr. Speaker. First, 
this has nothing to do with increasing 
State flexibility. It is about cutting

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H871 
February 6, 2020 
Medicaid. States already have signifi-
cant flexibility to design a Medicaid 
program that works best for them. 
You are also likely to hear that the 
Trump administration proposal only 
applies to the Medicaid expansion pop-
ulation. But, again, that is not true. 
As the Kaiser Family Foundation 
makes clear, States could include 
many low-income parents and pregnant 
women who currently rely on Medicaid. 
Now, imagine if States would be al-
lowed to cut pregnant women off of 
their health coverage in the midst of a 
maternal mortality crisis, which we 
now have. 
At the end of this day, this illegal 
proposal will lead to lower quality of 
care for fewer people. I encourage my 
colleagues to support this resolution 
and reject the administration’s illegal 
and cruel attack on working families, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
this resolution. We wouldn’t be having 
what is going to be a spirited debate 
today over the facts if the Energy and 
Commerce Committee had bothered to 
have a hearing on the underlying issue. 
I have asked the chairman, my 
friend, Mr. PALLONE, to do exactly 
that. He cited a source, Kaiser Family 
Foundation, saying pregnant women 
are going to be involved in all of this. 
The head of CMS and their lawyers say: 
Not true. Not the case at all. 
So here we have a disputed fact on 
the floor being hammered out here 
without the benefit of due process and 
regular order. There has been no reg-
ular order, no hearing, no opportunity 
to bring in these very qualified people, 
and do what we do best in this Con-
gress, which is listen to the experts, 
take the testimony, make up our 
minds, and have debates. 
No. The administration put out their 
letter, their guidance, saying here is 
how States can innovate. Our State of 
Oregon spent a lot on innovation in 
this space. We were both in the State 
legislature at times, and we sought 
waivers as a State so we could inno-
vate, create the Oregon Health Plan, 
and do all of these things. Forty States 
have waivers. Most of our States have 
waivers so they can innovate; so they 
can bring better healthcare to the 
working poor; and find cost savings 
they can plow back into better services 
and more services, which is what this 
underlying proposal allows. 
Let me talk about a couple of things: 
One, there is no mandate here. This is 
not, as my friend describes, some evil- 
empire approach where the Trump ad-
ministration is forcing something on 
States. That is factually not the case. 
This is States seeking an option to in-
novate and provide better healthcare 
at lower costs to the people they are 
trying to serve. 
They would have to meet rigorous 
standards, including all of the essential 
health 
benefits 
required 
under 
ObamaCare. That is a requirement 
here. They can’t walk away from that. 
This applies to able-bodied adults, 
not to children, not to people with dis-
abilities, on down that list of manda-
tory populations. This does not affect 
the mandatory. This is only the expan-
sion population in the States that ex-
panded Medicaid. 
They are going to argue differently 
because I heard it in the Rules Com-
mittee. I can tell you directly from 
CMS, that is not the case. That is not 
their intent. That is not what they 
have suggested. That is not in their 
proposal. 
If we are going to have this difference 
of opinion, I go back to the underlying 
issue here. Why in the devil did we not 
take an hour or two to do regular order 
and have the Subcommittee on Health, 
chaired by my dear friend from Cali-
fornia, Ms. ESHOO, who could have done 
a great job having a hearing? She can 
be rigorous on the administration. We 
could have hashed this out there. But 
no. 
This isn’t even a resolution of dis-
approval that stops what the adminis-
tration is proposing. This is the par-
tisan equivalent of a press release. It is 
a sense of Congress saying: We don’t 
like this. 
So when we are done with that, then 
what happens? Nothing. This is a par-
tisan, political, pathetic debate that 
serves no real legislative purpose. 
Done. 
If you want to argue legislation, the 
grownup work we do so well at Energy 
and Commerce, then let’s have a legis-
lative hearing. Let’s bring in the Kai-
ser Family Foundation that was just 
cited and hold them accountable under 
oath to show us where what they claim 
is fact. We can dispute whether some-
thing is legal or not. Let’s have the 
lawyers there to give us guidance. But 
that is not what we are doing. 
On Monday afternoon, this language 
got posted. We went to the Rules Com-
mittee. We asked for an opportunity to 
have an alternative, a motion to re-
commit on this issue. We were denied 
that. We had no opportunity to dig into 
the facts and the figures. 
We do know one thing: Our States 
are great laboratories for innovation. 
They really are. California has waivers. 
Oregon has waivers. A lot of States 
have waivers. We had it back in the 
day when, I think, Project Independ-
ence was a waiver from Medicaid be-
cause we thought we could do it better 
and be a laboratory. 
This administration believes in that. 
States can, those closest to the people 
can create even better programs to 
take care of those they serve. This is a 
Federal-State partnership. 
Mr. Speaker, I object to this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to House 
Resolution 826; a resolution hastily put to-
gether that opposes the Administration’s 
Healthy Opportunity demonstration initiative in 
Medicaid. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 
Services introduced a voluntary proposal to 
allow states to file for an 1115 Waiver called 
the Healthy Adult Opportunity Initiative. This is 
an option; let me emphasize, an option, for 
states for certain able-bodied adults-only. 
This optional Healthy Adult Opportunity Ini-
tiative does not apply to children, seniors, or 
those with disabilities—just able-bodied adults. 
It is a prepackaged set of flexibilities, most of 
which are already used by states in running 
their programs. 
There are many provisions in this proposal 
that we can all get behind: lowering drug 
costs, increasing transparency, and greater 
access to health care. These proposals build 
on bipartisan legislation we’ve worked on in 
the past. 
Administrator Verma released a 56-page let-
ter for the demonstration initiative on January 
30th. Industry groups were already voicing op-
position to the initiative only an hour later— 
pretty quick to read it and write an opposition 
to it if you ask me. House members were fast-
er than that. 
The day before the plan was released, 36 
House members sent a letter to Secretary 
Azar and Administrator Verma opposing the 
initiative. How can you oppose something you 
haven’t even seen? 
The resolution says that the goal of the 
Waiver Opportunity is to deprive Medicaid 
beneficiaries of health services. But on Page 
7, CMS points out that any state electing to 
participate in this demonstration initiative will 
be expected, at a minimum, to provide cov-
erage of items and services in the categories 
of 
the 
ACA’s 
Essential 
Health 
Benefits 
(EHBs), benefits such as (1) ambulatory pa-
tient services; (2) emergency services; (3) 
hospitalization; (4) maternity and newborn 
care; (5) mental health and substance use dis-
order services, including behavioral health 
treatment; (6) prescription drugs; (7) rehabilita-
tive and habilitative services and devices; (8) 
laboratory 
services; 
(9) 
preventive 
and 
wellness services and chronic disease man-
agement; and (10) pediatric services, including 
oral and vision care, which generally are not 
applicable for the populations that would be 
covered under any state that participates in 
the Waiver Opportunity. 
The resolution also asserts the initiative 
would roll back access standards. But on 
Page 4, CMS expressly states that those who 
participate in the demonstration will be mon-
itored 
to 
ensure 
health 
outcomes 
are 
achieved. 
This resolution is just another case of 
Democrats putting partisan political rhetoric in 
the way of facts and meaningful health reform. 
The Healthy Adult Opportunity—if states 
choose to participate in it—will not give states 
the ability to cap beneficiary enrollment or cut 
benefits. CMS is putting an expenditure cap 
on the waiver should a state choose to take 
this option, but expenditure caps are fairly 
common in health programs. 
For example, the Children’s Health Insur-
ance Program (CHIP) and many section 1115 
Medicaid demonstrations (of which more than 
40 states currently participate voluntarily) al-
ready operate under a funding ceiling. 
I want to point out that while total federal 
funding will be capped, the waiver does not 
change the need for states to submit claims 
reflecting actual expenditures to obtain federal 
matching funds for the Medicaid program and 
to maintain health outcomes as under current 
law. Again, states will not be allowed to cap

enrollment and qualify for the statutory en-
hanced federal match rate for this expansion 
population. 
Finally, to the extent a State achieves sav-
ings and demonstrate no declines in access or 
quality, CMS will share back a portion of the 
federal savings for reinvestment into Medicaid. 
Perhaps, this sort of shared responsibility and 
incentives could help the people the Medicaid 
program is intended to serve. 
Now, to be clear, I agree this is a major pro-
posal, one that needs to be examined care-
fully. To that end, let’s have a committee hear-
ing at Energy and Commerce, the Committee 
with jurisdiction over Medicaid, where we can 
hear from stakeholders as well as the Admin-
istration and walk through the facts of the 
Waiver Opportunity. Instead of a hurried dis-
approval resolution that bypassed the Com-
mittee process, let’s do the work at the Com-
mittee level to examine this proposal carefully. 
When I was Chairman of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, we were committed to 
a process of regular order, allowing for 
enough time to have meaningful debate and 
examination of the issues that came before 
our committee. 
House Democrats said they are just as 
committed to regular order, yet time and time 
again, we come to the House floor to debate 
bills or resolution with no committee process 
and always for partisan political theatre. 
Instead of this resolution, we should be vot-
ing to end surprise billing. We should be de-
bating how to avoid the Part D catastrophic 
cliff Obamacare created. We should be con-
sidering bipartisan legislation to lower drug 
prices. 
This is another episode of House Demo-
crats putting politics over progress. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. VEASEY), who is a sponsor of this 
resolution. 
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to bring this resolution to the 
floor today which will fight against the 
Trump administration’s harmful Med-
icaid block grants. 
I would like to take a moment to 
thank the chairman and the committee 
and their staff for working hard to pro-
tect healthcare for all Americans. 
Today, we are here to shine a light 
on yet another one of the harmful and 
irresponsible policies designed by the 
Trump administration. 
These block grants are just the latest 
in a slew of attempts by his adminis-
tration to gut the Affordable Care Act 
and the numerous coverage expansions 
that have been offered to millions of 
Americans of all ages and all back-
grounds who were unable to gain cov-
erage before, and the millions more 
who could gain coverage if States like 
mine would be smart and expand Med-
icaid in our own States. 
They have been talking about these 
block grants in Texas for a while, and 
they are a hee-hee, ha-ha joke. Every-
body knows that these are harmful. 
People in the healthcare industry in 
Texas know that these are harmful, 
and block grants would be harmful for 
the Nation. 
This resolution on the floor today 
demonstrates our majority’s strong op-
position to removing the expanded pro-
tections that the Affordable Care Act 
provided to primarily childless adults 
and those parents who are living at or 
below the poverty line. 
Millions of hardworking Americans 
have finally been able to gain afford-
able health insurance. Now the Trump 
administration wants to take away the 
progress made by these Americans and 
undercut their access to healthcare. 
They also want to chip away at the 
access to healthcare for millions of 
Americans who have and will be able to 
gain coverage through State Medicaid 
expansions. 
That is why I am proud to lead this 
resolution today because affordable 
and accessible healthcare is a right. It 
should not be a privilege, Mr. Speaker. 
It should be a right for all. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. LATTA). 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the Republican leader of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee for yielding. 
I rise in opposition to H. Res. 826. 
This resolution is solely a political 
talking point. The administration’s 
proposal does not harm Medicaid. I ap-
plaud the Trump administration for 
moving in the right direction. Block 
grants give States the flexibility to in-
vest in their citizens’ best interests, 
while spending an estimated $1.4 tril-
lion over the next 10 years. That is tril-
lion. 
It is plain and simple. Children, sen-
iors, and individuals with disabilities 
will not be negatively affected by this 
option, and those in low-income com-
munities will be greatly benefited. 
Additionally, CHIP and many of the 
other 
Medicaid 
demonstrations 
are 
currently running under similar struc-
tures. 
As earlier stated by the Republican 
leader, States do know what is best for 
their residents. By giving States the 
options to voluntarily participate in 
this program and to share in the Fed-
eral savings, it is a win. This resolu-
tion is simply a Democrat health scare 
tactic, and I encourage all of my col-
leagues to oppose H. Res. 826. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. ESHOO), who is the chair of 
our Health Subcommittee. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairman of the committee for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
resolution. I do so for the following 
reasons: We have heard from our 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
about process issues. They are always 
appropriate to bring up. But that real-
ly is an obfuscation of why we are on 
the floor today with this resolution. 
This is about healthcare. This is about 
the Democrats looking to protect the 
healthcare that the American people 
have today. 
Now, from the outset of this adminis-
tration, Medicaid coverage for low-in-
come and disabled Americans, medi-
cally complex children, and our Na-
tion’s most vulnerable communities 
have been under attack. 
After failing to repeal Medicaid cov-
erage for 17 million Americans in the 
last Congress, the Trump administra-
tion is now taking a hatchet to Med-
icaid. They are ripping coverage away 
from families, through onerous paper-
work—saying: ‘‘Oh, no, that really 
doesn’t matter,’’ but it does—onerous 
paperwork requirements, discrimina-
tory policies against documented im-
migrants, and funding cuts through 
proposed block grants. 
b 1445 
Block grants are not exactly tidy. It 
is not the way they are being rep-
resented. They use the word ‘‘flexible.’’ 
Whom is it flexible for? It is flexible 
for the States that can’t stand it and 
allow them to cut, and they are the 
States that have some of the poorest 
people in them. 
The administration’s actions have al-
ready taken a terrible toll. They are di-
rectly responsible for 818,000 fewer chil-
dren being enrolled in Medicaid and the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program 
and 750,000 fewer adults being enrolled 
in Medicaid since 2017. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman from California an 
additional 30 seconds. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to hear the Republicans today 
stand up on the floor and say: We ob-
ject to the administration being in the 
court to eviscerate, remove, undo, and 
get rid of the entirety of the Affordable 
Care Act, and I don’t think this can 
stand. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support it. I think a vote against this 
resolution is a vote to throw millions 
of Americans with preexisting condi-
tions overboard. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I have to 
just respond in that none of that is 
what is in this resolution because this 
resolution has no force of law. This res-
olution is not healthcare policy; it is a 
press statement. It does nothing to 
deal with any of the issues my dear 
friend has just raised, other than make 
a statement. 
Do you want to legislate? Then legis-
late. Let’s go have a hearing. Let’s go 
have a markup. Let’s go work on these 
issues together. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS). 
The good doctor is the former chair-
man of the Health Subcommittee. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I did 
want to speak in opposition to H. Res. 
826. It is indeed a political exercise, and 
I am disappointed that the Democrats 
have decided to discuss the Healthy 
Adult Opportunity demonstration in 
this manner. 
If we are to have legitimate debate 
on this optional policy, then we should 
do so in a hearing. We should do so in

February 6, 2020 
a hearing in our committee. That is 
why the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee Republican Leader WALDEN and 
I sent a letter to Chairman PALLONE to 
request such a hearing. We should be 
asking the questions of the agencies 
and the States that are deciding as to 
whether or not they want to utilize 
this option, a new section 1115 waiver 
for a very specific population. 
This optional demonstration changes 
nothing for children, seniors, or indi-
viduals with disabilities. 
The comments about the State of 
Texas are absolutely erroneous. Texas 
did not expand Medicaid. This only ap-
plies to the Healthy Adult expansion 
population, not to the traditional man-
datory populations. 
All essential health benefits require-
ments would remain in place, and 
States do not have to take the option. 
States can maintain the status quo and 
continue to operate their Medicaid pro-
grams as they were before this oppor-
tunity was presented to them. 
Again, this is an option. Give States 
flexibility. States are great labora-
tories of innovation. We should let 
them innovate. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RUSH), who chairs our Energy 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairman of the full Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce for yielding me 
this time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. 
Res. 826. Over the last 3 years, the 
Trump administration has deliberately 
and repeatedly sabotaged the Afford-
able Care Act. This has led to higher 
healthcare costs for low- and middle- 
income Americans. This has also led to 
an increase in the number of uninsured 
Americans, including those in my 
home State of Illinois. 
As such, Mr. Speaker, it is not sur-
prising to me that the administration 
is, once again, attacking vulnerable 
Americans’ healthcare. 
We have not forgotten that our col-
leagues across the aisle tried and failed 
to force through the Medicaid block 
grant in the year 2017. It failed, Mr. 
Speaker, because the American people 
saw the plan for what it was: a way to 
weaken the Medicaid program. 
Under this latest proposal, just like 
TrumpCare, much of the financial bur-
den would shift to States. States, Mr. 
Speaker, would be forced to reduce 
benefits, kick vulnerable Americans off 
Medicaid, and siphon funds from other 
priorities, including schools, roads, and 
first responders. 
Mr. Speaker, healthcare is a human 
right, and we cannot and we will not 
stand idly by if this right is taken 
away from the most vulnerable among 
us. 
As such, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to 
vote in favor of this resolution to ex-
press my disapproval of the Trump ad-
ministration’s Medicaid block grant 
plan. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, once 
again, I just point out the State Gov-
ernor would have to seek a waiver and 
get approval to maintain all the essen-
tial benefits of the Affordable Care Act 
in everything they do. This only ap-
plies in States that took the expansion, 
not others. States are the great labora-
tories 
that 
innovate 
and 
deliver 
healthcare better for the working poor. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. 
RODGERS). 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman and 
our leader for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand in opposition to 
H. Res. 826. 
It really is a partisan resolution. It 
has zero reforms. It is being rushed 
through to attack the administration’s 
Healthy Adult Opportunity program to 
modernize Medicaid. 
The majority is ignoring that Medic-
aid’s status quo is leaving people like 
pregnant women, the elderly, and peo-
ple with disabilities behind today. In-
stead of working in a bipartisan fash-
ion to actually improve Medicaid, they 
are more interested in scoring political 
points. 
There are currently over 700,000 indi-
viduals across this country on waiting 
lists, people with disabilities on wait-
ing lists, to get care within Medicaid. I 
would urge you to check your States, 
Mr. Speaker. Two-thirds of the 700,000 
who are waiting for care and services 
that they need currently today on Med-
icaid are living with a disability. 
I listened to one family’s story. Their 
daughter had a rare neurological condi-
tion. She was put on a Medicaid wait-
ing list for 10 years to be approved for 
services—10 years. 
This is happening in my home State 
of Washington, too. There are almost 
14,000 
individuals 
with 
disabilities 
today waiting for care and services. 
The most appalling figure is that at 
least 21,900 people across the country 
have died waiting for Medicaid services 
that they need. 
The status quo is unacceptable. It 
needs to be fixed. We need a solution, 
not a partisan resolution that main-
tains the status quo. 
It is time to modernize Medicaid. 
Let’s work together. Let’s get solu-
tions. The Healthy Adult Opportunity 
program will improve the Medicaid 
program’s integrity by giving States 
the option to innovate and provide cov-
erage by enrolling in the program. This 
will give States the flexibility to con-
trol costs and share the program’s sav-
ings 
within 
Medicaid. 
States 
like 
Washington could put those savings di-
rectly back into the Medicaid program 
so that they can shorten their waiting 
list and save lives. 
Let’s have a hearing. Let’s get this 
done. Let’s work in a bipartisan way. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE), who 
chairs our Communications and Tech-
nology Subcommittee. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, I have a strange 
feeling of deja vu today because, once 
again, Democrats are down on the 
floor, speaking out against another at-
tempt by the Trump administration to 
take away people’s healthcare. 
This should go without saying, but 
let me say clearly: Block grants do not 
strengthen the Medicaid program, and 
they do not protect Americans. 
It makes sense that when the econ-
omy is bad, more people might need 
Medicaid, and when the economy is 
good, Medicaid payments shrink. This 
is common sense and good public pol-
icy. Medicaid should be there when 
people need it the most, yet the Trump 
administration wants to undo that. In-
stead, the amount of money that a 
State would receive would be flat, and 
States would have to adjust their cov-
erages accordingly. 
That means one of two things: either 
fewer people can be covered or fewer 
services can be covered. In fact, this 
policy encourages States to cut cov-
erage and divert Medicaid money to 
other parts of their budgets. 
We should be trying to improve peo-
ple’s healthcare and investing more so 
that American families don’t have to. 
Republicans have been trying to cut 
Medicaid for 30 years. This is just the 
latest attempt. They most recently 
failed to cut Medicaid coverage when 
they were in the majority and tried to 
repeal the Affordable Care Act because 
the American people were overwhelm-
ingly opposed to their plan. Now the 
Trump administration is trying to go 
it alone. 
But the American people will see 
through what you are doing, and they 
will see the Republicans in Congress, 
once again, turning a blind eye while 
this President and his administration 
try to take healthcare away from mil-
lions of Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this resolution to condemn 
this outrageous and unwise proposal. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are requested to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, could I 
inquire as to how much time each side 
has remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 181⁄4 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from New 
Jersey has 19 minutes remaining. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. MITCHELL). 
Mr. MITCHELL. I am not sure, Mr. 
Speaker, if you are aware or my col-
leagues are aware that we are now over 
15 resolutions expressing disapproval 
with some policy of the administra-
tion, more than one per month. It ap-
pears maybe we have a monthly check-
list that we must do some resolution 
disapproving of the administration’s 
action on a monthly basis. 
There is a point in time in this body 
we actually legislated. Imagine that. 
We considered an issue. We would have 
hearings. We would get experts in. We 
would have a bill. We would have reg-
ular order. We would amend the bill. 
And we would debate the policies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H874 
February 6, 2020 
This is not legislation. H. Res. 826 has 
less impact and less importance than 
the tissue in the Cloakroom has on this 
body. I repeat that: less impact be-
cause, frankly, it is more useful. 
This is not. This is a media oppor-
tunity. This is a press release. At some 
time, the media will have people gath-
ered together to bemoan the policy of 
the Trump administration. 
By the way, this is simply a guide to 
the States if they want to pursue waiv-
ers. States are choosing what is best 
for their citizens to serve them. As has 
been noted, there have been over 43 
waivers approved by multiple States. 
So let me just say, I watched with 
great interest last evening the debate 
over expressing one’s opinion and First 
Amendment rights in this body. With 
great interest, I watched them. So let 
me at this point in time express my 
opinion and exercise my First Amend-
ment rights by simply saying—— 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), who chairs our 
Consumer Protection and Commerce 
Subcommittee in Congress. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to condemn the Trump administra-
tion’s cuts to Medicaid as yet another 
broken promise from this President. 
On 
May 
7, 
2015, 
then-candidate 
Trump tweeted: ‘‘I was the first and 
only potential GOP candidate to state 
there will be no cuts to Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, and Medicaid.’’ He even 
said that these programs were a part of 
what makes America great. 
The President was right. Medicaid is 
a pillar of our society. Mr. Speaker, 
3.26 million people in my home State of 
Illinois 
receive 
their 
healthcare 
through Medicaid. Since Illinois ex-
panded Medicaid in 2013, our uninsured 
rate has been cut nearly in half. One 
study found that expanded Medicaid 
coverage reduced mortality in Illinois 
by 6 percent. 
Mr. Speaker, 40 percent of kids in my 
State can see a doctor when they are 
sick 
and 
get 
vaccinations 
and 
screenings that they need only because 
of Medicaid, and over 275,000 Illinois 
seniors and almost 400,000 people with 
disabilities rely on Medicaid. In fact, 
Medicaid pays for over half of all long- 
term services and supports across the 
United States. 
b 1500 
Despite all this, the administration 
is gutting Medicaid funding and allow-
ing States to cut benefits. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voicing our opposition to 
the Trump administration by voting 
‘‘yes’’ on this resolution. Medicaid 
matters, and we will protect your care. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I just point out that, again, this is a 
State option. Nobody is mandating 
anything on any State. States can 
come to the Federal Government, as 
they willfully do, and say: We have a 
better idea to take care of the working 
poor. We think we can achieve some 
savings that we understand. If we do, 
we will be plowed back into more bene-
fits and services in some large measure 
to improve and expand Medicaid in our 
State. 
Mr. Speaker, our States have done 
that. As you know, others are. This is 
an option. It is not a mandate. 
Finally, the resolution on the floor 
today has no legal effect on any of this. 
It is a press release called a resolution. 
It never even goes to the Senate. It will 
never go to the President. It will never 
become a law. It is just a press state-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, so for all the comments 
about stopping this and stopping that, 
you do that with legislation. That is 
why we have said you ought to have a 
hearing in the committee of jurisdic-
tion. If you want to mark up a bill, 
let’s go do that. Let’s have witnesses. 
Let’s do what we do best around here. 
But we are not doing this. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), 
Congress’ pharmacist. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to speak against H. Res. 
826, a resolution that was hastily put 
together that opposes the administra-
tion’s Healthy Adult Opportunity dem-
onstration initiative in Medicaid. 
The use of waivers to grant States 
more flexibility in managing their 
healthcare systems is foundational to 
health 
reforms 
from 
both 
parties 
throughout the years. In fact, most 
Medicaid programs across the country 
today are currently operating under 
some form of waiver. 
In the latest waiver proposal, the 
Trump 
administration 
would 
allow 
States more flexibility to manage their 
Medicaid 
expansion 
population 
by 
choosing to accept their Federal funds 
in a per person or lump sum basis. 
States would be able to take that Fed-
eral money and more efficiently treat 
these patients and then share in the 
savings. 
The Medicaid program was built to 
be a safety net for our children and the 
poor, not to be our Nation’s largest in-
surer. This waiver would not affect how 
Medicaid cares for children, seniors, or 
those with disabilities. 
The Healthy Adult Opportunity waiv-
ers are designed only to help States 
manage the rapidly ballooning costs 
from able-bodied adults who are now on 
Medicaid after ObamaCare. 
Medicaid benefits and patient access 
to care will not be cut in this proposal. 
Any State pursuing a Healthy Adult 
Opportunity waiver will still be held 
responsible for the accessibility of 
services to beneficiaries. 
As much as my friends across the 
aisle seek to demonize this proposal 
and use every scare tactic in the book, 
this is sound policy to help the growing 
number of States struggling to manage 
the costs of their growing Medicaid 
programs. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend President 
Trump, Secretary Azar, and Adminis-
trator Verma for their work, and I urge 
my colleagues to vote against this res-
olution. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. CASTOR). 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Chairman PALLONE for yielding 
the time. 
Affordable healthcare is fundamental 
to the well-being of American families, 
but the Trump administration doesn’t 
believe that. Now, they are proposing 
again to shrink, block, or eliminate 
health services under Medicaid. 
For over 50 years, Medicaid has pro-
vided a coverage guarantee. It is guar-
anteed that if you fall on hard times or 
if you have a disability or you are a 
senior in skilled nursing, care will be 
there if you need it. But this proposal 
out of the administration will severely 
chip away at that coverage guarantee. 
It is particularly harmful to my 
home State of Florida, and it will com-
plicate our ability to expand Medicaid 
health services to families who need it. 
Don’t just take it from me. Patient 
advocates, doctors, and hospitals over-
whelmingly oppose block grant waivers 
because they will weaken access to 
care. Groups like AARP, the American 
Cancer Society Action Network, the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, the 
Federation of American Hospitals, the 
Children’s Hospital Association, and 
many others have spoken out against 
block grants and waivers. 
Unfortunately, this is part of the ad-
ministration’s broader antihealthcare 
agenda. They have tried to weaken af-
fordable care through budgets; we have 
rejected it. Through legislation, we 
have defeated it. Now, they are in the 
courts to take away that coverage for 
preexisting conditions. 
The Trump antihealthcare agenda is 
cruel. It is wrong. And I urge my col-
leagues to reject it today by passing 
this resolution. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. GUTHRIE). 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H. Res. 826, a 
rushed resolution to dismantle the 
Trump administration’s Healthy Adult 
Opportunity Medicaid initiative. 
The Affordable Care Act expansion of 
Medicaid is simply unsustainable. It is 
bankrupting my home State of Ken-
tucky. 
In the 114th Congress, I served as the 
chair of the House Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce’s Medicaid Task 
Force. We explored ways that would 
make Medicaid sustainable so that it 
can be fully utilized by vulnerable pop-
ulations for generations to come. 
The Trump administration has pro-
posed a commonsense option that will 
not affect funding for children, preg-
nant women, the elderly, or people 
with 
disabilities 
but, 
rather, 
give 
States flexibility for their Medicaid 
programs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H875 
February 6, 2020 
I will continue to work with my col-
leagues on the House Committee on 
Energy and Commerce to make Med-
icaid sustainable and accessible to 
those who need it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose H. Res. 826. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. MATSUI). 
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of the millions of 
Americans who rely on Medicaid for ac-
cess to mental health services. Individ-
uals with mental illnesses and addic-
tions were among the largest bene-
ficiaries of the Medicaid expansion. 
The mentally ill, along with disabled, 
low-income families, and older adults, 
will undoubtedly suffer if their cov-
erage is reduced or taken away entirely 
under the Trump administration’s new 
guidance to cut Medicaid funding. 
Block grants will shift costs to States, 
forcing them to make tough decisions 
about what services to cut, picking the 
well-being and care needs of one pa-
tient population over another. 
Not only is this plan unethical, it is 
illegal. And the American people un-
derstand block grants would hurt some 
of the most vulnerable amongst us. We 
cannot allow this administration to 
recklessly cause such hardship. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in expressing their disapproval 
of the Trump block grant plan by vot-
ing to support H. Res. 826. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. KENNEDY). 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Speaker, Med-
icaid saves lives. It helps save patients 
from poverty and provides families 
with access to critical care. It is the 
largest payer of mental healthcare in 
the country and the longest payer of 
long-term care in the country. 
It covers half of all births and 
strengthens special education opportu-
nities in our schools. It covers working 
families. It covers babies. It covers the 
elderly, the sick, the addicted, and 
those in need. 
In short, it covers those that this ad-
ministration has relentlessly targeted 
from 
its 
very 
first 
day, 
from 
a 
healthcare repeal effort that would 
have denied care to millions of Ameri-
cans; to a lawsuit that could still steal 
healthcare from millions more; then a 
relentless effort to impose onerous bu-
reaucratic red tape known as work re-
quirements on people struggling to 
make ends meet; and now this, an ille-
gal and immoral block grant that will 
end in countless lives lost to prevent-
able deaths. 
We can afford trillions of dollars in 
tax cuts to make the rich richer. We 
can afford $60 billion for a wall that 
falls in the wind and fails in the rain. 
But taking care of our neighbors, that 
is a cost we can’t bear, a challenge too 
great for this country to shoulder. 
For an administration that seeks to 
make America great, our President far 
too frequently doubts the capabilities 
and grit of our fellow neighbors. But as 
this administration stands proudly be-
hind this illegal policy, I have no doubt 
that it will be rejected by this Cham-
ber, in our courts, and by the American 
people yet again. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CA´ RDENAS). 
Mr. CA´ RDENAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to express my strong opposition 
to President Trump’s constant efforts 
to gut Medicaid. 
Let’s be clear. This is another at-
tempt by President Trump to take 
healthcare 
away 
from 
millions 
of 
Americans. This block grant proposal 
is the latest step in Trump’s ongoing 
efforts to end the Affordable Care Act. 
Trump is, tragically, trying to affect 
the most vulnerable in our country: 
children, people with disabilities, low- 
income families, and seniors. 
According to a recent study, this pro-
posal could lead to cuts of $37 billion, 
perhaps as much as $49 billion a year of 
healthcare benefits to our American 
citizens. 
Just 2 days ago, President Trump 
spoke right here in this Chamber, say-
ing that he is out to protect healthcare 
for the American people. But once 
again, we see he is trying to hurt 
Americans when all he is trying to do 
is talk one way and take actions like 
this against the American people and 
their healthcare. 
I know what it is like to not have 
healthcare, when I was a little boy, 
when an aspirin, a prayer, and the 
emergency room were your only op-
tions. 
Americans should not have to suffer 
through that. There is no need for it. 
But this President wants people to suf-
fer. 
Many of my constituents rely on 
Medicaid for their health coverage. 
People shouldn’t be forced to choose 
between buying medicine for their chil-
dren or putting food on their tables. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join my 
colleagues in Congress, such as Con-
gressman VEASEY, in supporting H. 
Res. 826. We will not stay silent as this 
administration continues its efforts to 
gut and take healthcare away from 
millions of Americans across our great 
Nation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I was 
going to raise that point. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. RUIZ), a member of our 
committee. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, block-grant-
ing Medicaid will increase out-of-pock-
et costs, limit patient care, and take 
away health coverage for millions of 
Americans across this country. 
Block-granting Medicaid is just an-
other way of cutting Medicaid. To re-
duce costs, States will cut eligibility, 
cut payments to doctors and hospitals 
that care for the poor, and cut cov-
erage for seniors and medicines. 
These cuts will raise out-of-pocket 
costs for Americans, result in fewer 
hospitals and providers for Medicaid 
recipients, and increase barriers to 
care for low-income, rural, and vulner-
able patients. 
b 1515 
It will harm people in underserved 
areas with physician shortages, like 
Desert Hot Springs, Eastern Coachella 
Valley, and Hemet in my district, peo-
ple in rural areas, low-income seniors, 
children, people with disabilities, our 
neighbors and families. 
Put simply, Medicaid block grants 
hurt the very people Medicaid is here 
to help. That is why I urge this body to 
vote for H. Res. 826 and make a strong 
statement to protect healthcare for 
millions of Americans. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself as much time as I may con-
sume. 
May I say, the proposal before us 
today has no force of law. There is a lot 
of heated rhetoric, yes. There is a lot of 
fire and brimstone, yes. There are even 
words that probably could have been 
taken down. But the resolution before 
us is nothing more than a partisan po-
litical press release. 
So for all of the comments, you could 
legislate, but you are not. You could 
actually have the force of law. 
Now, let’s get to the underlying 
issue. All these attacks on the Presi-
dent say the President is doing this, 
the President is doing this, that, and 
the other thing, when, in fact, that is 
not what is happening here. The Presi-
dent is giving States the opportunity 
to 
do 
a 
better 
job 
of 
providing 
healthcare to their citizens. 
Nothing in this waiver process that 
exists today in statute or exists tomor-
row under this proposal that the ad-
ministration has put forward is allowed 
to adversely affect people on disabil-
ities or pregnant women or children. 
This goes to the expanded adult popu-
lation, where they can then innovate. 
Our State, Mr. Speaker, as you know, 
is seeking a waiver to be able to expand 
substance abuse disorder treatment. 
That would be allowed under this. 
States like California could come to 
the administration under this author-
ity and say we would like to expand 
our Medicaid program to include more 
services for people who need mental 
health, so mental health and substance 
abuse disorders. 
Mr. Speaker, earlier in the debate, 
my colleague from Washington State 
talked about the backlog for people on 
disabilities who can’t get access to 
Medicaid. So what is wrong with a 
State saying: We can do it better; we 
can do it more efficiently; we can save 
money; and we can plow the savings 
back into expanded coverage?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H876 
February 6, 2020 
By the way, Mr. Speaker, Oregon has 
been a leader in this sort of effort with 
our CCOs, our Coordinated Care Orga-
nizations, where they have done pre-
cisely this. They do wraparound serv-
ices. They take the most vulnerable 
and people in need in our communities 
and say: Let’s all get together and take 
care of this patient. In doing so, the 
savings, in large measure, go back into 
expanded services. 
So, for all the doomsday talk I hear 
on the floor, Mr. Speaker, let’s get to 
the facts of the matter. The facts of 
the matter are nobody is being forced 
to do a block grant; nobody is being 
forced to do cap and a gap. 
What we are saying is: States, let’s 
be thoughtful about this. Come to 
Washington. Here are some things we 
know work elsewhere, and you can do 
it in your State and save money and 
probably provide more benefits and 
maybe save a little for the taxpayers 
and 
improve 
the 
quality 
of 
the 
healthcare for the people you are over-
seeing. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL), also a mem-
ber of our committee. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my chairman for all the hard work he 
has been doing. 
I rise in strong support of H. Res. 826 
and in opposition to the Trump admin-
istration’s recent proposed cuts to 
Medicaid. 
Medicaid provides important life-
saving care for our Nation’s children, 
seniors, and disabled, including in my 
home State of Michigan. That is why 
political leaders, under the leadership 
of Governor Rick Snyder, a Repub-
lican, worked across the aisle to ex-
pand Medicaid in Michigan in 2014. 
This expansion, Healthy Michigan, 
currently covers over 650,000 Michi-
ganders, providing them access to both 
quality and affordable healthcare and 
protection from crippling medical bills. 
It has also supported rural hospitals 
both in Michigan and across the coun-
try. Without Healthy Michigan, hos-
pitals across the State that serve some 
of our most vulnerable residents would 
face closures and terrible increased fi-
nancial pressures. 
Finally, Medicaid is the single larg-
est payor of long-term care in this 
country and allows our seniors the op-
portunity to live with dignity as they 
age. 
The Trump administration’s recent 
actions puts this all at risk. Both the 
2017 healthcare proposal and the CMS 
proposal would block grant Medicaid, 
drastically cutting the resources it 
provides for lifesaving medical care. 
We know what this means: increased 
healthcare costs for my constituents 
and a loss of coverage for seniors, the 
disabled, and our children, who are the 
overwhelming majority of Medicaid re-
cipients. 
This resolution sends a strong mes-
sage: We will make good on our com-
mitment to provide quality and afford-
able healthcare to every American, and 
I urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, Michigan doesn’t have 
to apply for another waiver. Nobody is 
going to force anything like we just 
heard on Michigan. That is not the pro-
posal from the administration, and 
nothing in this resolution stops any-
thing anyway. 
In fact, I would argue, Michigan 
probably came to an administration to 
get exactly an 1115 waiver to do every-
thing my friend and colleague just said 
they are doing in Michigan, just like 
Oregon had to come back and get waiv-
ers to do what we are doing. 
All this administration is doing is 
saying: Let’s make that waiver process 
a little easier, but you have to make 
sure you are continuing to provide the 
best care possible to the people you 
serve. 
And once again, despite what we have 
heard on the floor today, nothing in 
their proposal would apply to the cat-
egories we have been discussing: the 
mandatory, 
the 
legacy 
population. 
That is not what is there. 
That is why, Mr. Speaker, it would 
have been so much better to have a 
real hearing in the Energy and Com-
merce Committee where we could have 
had a real discussion with real experts 
there to get us all on the same basis of 
fact. It is unfortunate we don’t have 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD), who is the 
vice chair of our Health Subcommittee. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, for 
the life of me—for the life of me—I just 
cannot understand why 14 States have 
flatly refused to expand their Medicaid 
program to provide healthcare to their 
low-income, healthy, childless adults, a 
demographic that was omitted from 
Medicaid in 1965 when it was enacted 
into law. 
North Carolina, my home State, 
would greatly benefit from Medicaid 
expansion. Other congressional dis-
tricts would benefit. 
And to my Republican friends: The 
fact is that your low-income constitu-
ents would greatly benefit. Talk to 
your doctors. Talk to your hospitals. 
Talk to your providers. The coverage 
low-income individuals would receive 
will not only benefit them, but the en-
tire economy of your State. 
Let’s cooperate on this one. Let the 
States know that Medicaid expansion 
will benefit them, and it will not break 
their budget. We, the Federal Govern-
ment, will pay 90 percent of the costs 
in perpetuity. 
For the President to direct the block 
granting of Medicaid to the State will 
be absolutely beyond his executive au-
thority. 
I repeat: To direct block granting to 
the State will absolutely be beyond his 
executive authority. 
To cap and slash these benefits is un-
lawful, and it is cruel. It will require 
authorization from this Congress. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘aye’’ 
on this resolution, H. Res. 826. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair would remind Members to ad-
dress their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. 
WALDEN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
my 
friend from North Carolina, I would 
just say, through the Chair, that Or-
egon is an expansion State. So you are 
right. We have seen the benefits of this 
in my State. We have seen the benefit 
of flexibility. We have sought waivers 
and gotten them to do exactly the 
sorts of things you are saying. 
And, ironically, under the proposal of 
the administration, North Carolina 
could use this authority to expand its 
Medicaid population. That is allowed 
under the proposal from the adminis-
tration out to the States. They can ac-
tually use these tools and do exactly 
what the gentleman is saying: expand 
the population in North Carolina. 
So there are good thing things in 
here. 
Mr. Speaker, I am not going to get 
into the legal debate. I am not a law-
yer. I am not burdened with a law de-
gree. But I would argue that, if we had 
this discussion in our committee we 
love so much, maybe we would have a 
better outcome here. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL). 
Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I have 
a great deal of respect for both you and 
the chairman, but there is a parting of 
the ways here. I want to urge my col-
leagues to stand against the adminis-
tration’s vicious assault on Medicaid. 
That is how I perceive it. 
The expansion of Medicaid by the 
ACA is one of the great success stories 
of government in action in the last 50 
years. Despite the decade-long obstruc-
tionism, Medicaid expansion has saved 
19,000 older, low-income adult lives— 
and I know they don’t challenge those 
numbers—and 825 lives just in our 
State of New Jersey. 
But many Republicans have rejected 
the attempts to destroy—they tried to 
destroy the ACA at the ballot box and 
at the courthouse. But like Captain 
Ahab after his white whale, they re-
main singularly dedicated to stealing 
healthcare away from as many Ameri-
cans as possible. 
This administration knows their pol-
icy is pure poison. They gave it an in-
nocuous name and, as we heard on 
Tuesday, are lying about the details to 
fool people. 
Americans will not be fooled by this 
Orwellian scheme. This policy would 
rip away healthcare for some of the 
most vulnerable of our neighbors. They 
want to obliterate the ACA no matter 
what the consequences.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H877 
February 6, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I support this resolu-
tion to send a loud message: Those on 
the other side cannot be allowed to 
steal your healthcare. We will do ev-
erything in our power to stop their 
schemes. 
Now, the ‘‘Joker’’ movie may not 
prevail at Sunday’s Oscars. We must 
think about any other jokers that go 
through any of their basements, in-
cluding the White House, after today’s 
vote. What will they be sulking about? 
This is important legislation. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to the amount of time each 
side has. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 8 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from New Jer-
sey has 33⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
have any more speakers other than 
myself at this time, so I am prepared 
to close. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
believe we have any more, but I still 
have 8 minutes, so I am going to share 
a few comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to say a couple 
of things. 
When I chaired the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, we did try to do 
some reforms on healthcare, certainly, 
and there was a big disagreement, but 
we also extended funding for commu-
nity health centers, the biggest in-
crease they had ever gotten, 2 years 
fully funded. 
The chairman and I both are sup-
portive of a 5-year extension of fully 
funding 
community 
health 
centers 
going forward. In my State, I think we 
had 63 different places people got 
healthcare in my district, and 122— 
well, a lot of people in Oregon go 
through community health centers. 
As chairman, I led the effort in this 
Congress the last session to fully fund 
a 10-year expansion of the Children’s 
Health Insurance Program. That is the 
biggest expansion, I think, in modern 
legislative history, probably. 
Many Democrats voted against it 
when I tried to get it extended for 4 
years, and then a lot of Democrats 
voted against it when it was 6, and 
then eventually we got to 10—unprece-
dented. We got that into law. We even-
tually came together and we got that 
into law. 
We have done a lot of work on special 
diabetes program funding and a special 
program for those with diabetes in our 
Native American community. 
One thing after another, in the last 
Congress, we accomplished in a bipar-
tisan way. 
The work we did on opioids together 
as a Congress, you were a very impor-
tant part of that, Mr. Chairman, on a 
proposal that we passed in the House. 
Unfortunately, we fell a little short in 
the Senate to get better communica-
tion among providers. 
We put real money behind that, bil-
lions of dollars into our States and 
communities; and that help is starting 
to show up with expanded access—I 
think it is a 38 percent increase in ac-
cess—to the kind of services, health 
services, people dealing with addiction 
need. 
And, as a result of our work, I would 
say, in public education and other 
work, we saw, finally, a topping off in 
the overdose deaths. 
Now, there is more work to do there. 
b 1530 
This proposal, the underlying pro-
posal the administration has put for-
ward, I would argue, builds on the no-
tion of local, State, Federal partner-
ship to serve the same people. We 
would give States more authority to 
manage their Medicaid programs more 
efficiently 
and 
effectively. 
Savings 
would be put back into the Medicaid 
program in large measure. 
Now, my friend from New Jersey, not 
the chairman, but the predecessor 
speaker here, talked about ripping 
away healthcare. Ironically, it is the 
socialist left that wants to take away 
all Americans’ healthcare and have the 
Federal Government run it. That would 
be Medicare, Medicaid, Medicare Ad-
vantage, veterans’ healthcare in there, 
Medicare for all proposals that would, I 
think, bankrupt the Federal Govern-
ment. 
But it would rip away all the health 
insurance products out there and make 
them illegal. So if you liked your 
health insurance, you could say good- 
bye to it. And some of these same peo-
ple that can’t count votes in Iowa want 
to run your insurance in America, and 
I don’t think that is really a good 
thing. 
So we stand here today opposing this 
resolution. We stand here today saying, 
the resolution does nothing anyway, 
other than make a statement. Do you 
want to legislate? 
We can be partners, as we were on 
community health centers, as we were 
on opioids, as we were on children’s 
health insurance, as we were on a lot of 
things; but let’s go back to work where 
it belongs, in the committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I would just ask my col-
leagues, vote against this resolution. 
Then let’s get back to work on the real 
policy in the place where policy is done 
best. And with all due respect to those 
on the Ways and Means Committee, 
that would be the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. That is one thing we 
agree on in a bipartisan way. 
We can do our work there. We can get 
this right. Mr. Speaker, I ask for a 
‘‘no’’ vote, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume to 
close. 
I would urge my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to support this resolu-
tion. And in doing so, I would like to 
point to some of the whereas clauses of 
the actual resolution. 
It points out that the President has 
waged an unrelenting war on Medicaid. 
It says that, under President Trump’s 
watch, the number of uninsured chil-
dren has increased, reversing years of 
decline, largely as a result of substan-
tial losses in Medicaid coverage for 
children. 
Over a million children have lost 
Medicaid and CHIP coverage, and over 
750,000 adults have lost Medicaid cov-
erage. 
And I know that my colleague, the 
ranking member, who I respect, made 
reference to pregnant women and said 
that they would not be included under 
this block grant. 
In contrast to that, I want to read 
something from—the American College 
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists was 
sent a letter, and they say, under Fed-
eral law, States must cover pregnant 
women earning up to 138 percent of the 
Federal poverty level in their Medicare 
programs. 
Almost all States cover pregnant 
women beyond the Federal minimum. 
Any pregnant women covered beyond 
this minimum are, therefore, an op-
tional population, and could be in-
cluded in a State’s block grant dem-
onstration program. So, the fact of the 
matter is that pregnant women and 
postpartum women would be included 
in this. 
Also, it says in the whereas clauses, 
not only the guidance that we are try-
ing to reverse here today that allows 
States to cap their Medicaid funding 
through a block grant, but the Presi-
dent has also proposed regulations to 
roll back access standards put in place 
to ensure beneficiaries receive the care 
they need. 
He also issued guidance to allow 
State Medicaid programs to restrict 
access to prescription drugs by adopt-
ing closed formularies. He proposed 
massive annual compounding cuts in 
Federal funding to the program, in di-
rect contradiction to an explicit cam-
paign promise. 
Last year, the President’s budget cut 
Medicaid by $1 trillion. We are going to 
get the President’s budget next week. I 
would not be shocked if he didn’t cut it 
again by $1 trillion. 
We have been seeing this war by 
President Trump on Medicaid in every 
way, and that is why we are here 
today, to say this war against Medicaid 
has to stop. 
If the GOP claim that they support 
Medicaid, which oftentimes they don’t, 
then they should be voting for this res-
olution. 
So I urge all my colleagues to sup-
port this resolution, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
condemn the Trump Administration’s cuts to 
Medicaid as yet another broken promise from 
this President. 
On May 7, 2015, then-Candidate Trump 
tweeted: ‘‘I was the first & only potential GOP 
candidate to state there will be no cuts to So-
cial Security, Medicare & Medicaid.’’ 
He even said that these programs were a 
part of what makes America great. 
Well, Mr. President—you were right: Med-
icaid is a pillar of our society. 
3.26 million people in my home state of Illi-
nois receive their health care through Med-
icaid.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H878 
February 6, 2020 
Since Illinois expanded Medicaid in 2013, 
our uninsured rate has been nearly cut in half. 
One study found that expanding Medicaid 
coverage reduced mortality by 6 percent. 
40 percent of kids in my state can see a 
doctor when they are sick and get the vac-
cinations and screenings they need to stay 
healthy only because of Medicaid. 
Over 275,000 of Illinois’ seniors and almost 
400,000 people with disabilities rely on Med-
icaid to live independently, including nursing 
home care and services that help them live at 
home. 
In fact, Medicaid pays for over half of all 
longterm services and supports a cross the 
United States. 
Despite all this, the Administration is gutting 
Medicaid funding and allowing states to cut 
benefits that people need to survive. 
Why? 
Maybe because they need to pay for the 
GOP Tax Scam, which created a $1.5 trillion 
deficit in tax breaks for millionaires and billion-
aires. 
And because they want to continue their 
legacy of punishing low-income people and 
the most vulnerable among us. 
Medicaid is critical to the health and finan-
cial security of people across the United 
States. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in voting 
YES on this resolution so that we can send a 
clear message: Medicaid matters, and we will 
Protect Your Care. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I adamantly op-
pose Tennessee’s proposal to block grant its 
version of Medicaid, TennCare, and the Ad-
ministration’s proposal for all states to have 
the opportunity to restrict Medicaid funding. 
This proposal would harm Americans most in 
need across the country. We should not be 
encouraging states to limit resources and cap 
budgets. In Tennessee, one in ten people 
have no health insurance. When this is the 
case, we should be expanding options for af-
fordable health care options. Instead, this Ad-
ministration has relentlessly attacked Medicaid 
and the people who depend on its support to 
stay healthy. The fact is, the majority of non- 
disabled, non-elderly adults on Medicaid are 
working hard and rely on Medicaid to help get 
the basic health care that they need. I am 
proud to support H. Res. 826 and will continue 
to fight for access to health care for all Ameri-
cans. I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
join my Colleagues in support of House Reso-
lution 826, ‘‘Expressing disapproval of the 
Trump administration’s harmful actions to-
wards Medicaid.’’ 
Great Presidents are made by landmark pol-
icy initiatives and programs that bring a posi-
tive impact for the lives of the American peo-
ple or the world. 
Trump has promised to introduce new pro-
posals to protect those with pre-existing condi-
tions if the Affordable Care Act (ACA) bill is 
replaced, but so far none of his administra-
tion’s alternatives have come close to pro-
viding the level of healthcare currently avail-
able. 
The landmark bill, seen as one of the key 
pieces of legislation signed by President 
Obama barred insurers from denying cov-
erage, or charging more, to those with a pre- 
existing condition. 
Trump said during his State of the Union 
Address that he would protect the rights of the 
insured with pre-existing conditions is not true 
and the dishonesty of his statement is re-
vealed by his administration joining a lawsuit 
to take away this important protection. 
Through his actions Trump is doing all that 
he can to end the protections for those with 
pre-existing conditions. 
Trump’s Justice Department joined a lawsuit 
that would end the protections for pre-existing 
conditions. 
In July of this year, Medicare and Medicaid 
will reach 55 years of service to Americans 
from all walks of life. 
On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon B. 
Johnson, another great president, signed 
Medicare and Medicaid into law as part of the 
Social Security Act. 
This landmark legislation that truly rep-
resents Americans at our best became a re-
ality due to the tireless efforts of great leaders 
like Teddy Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and Lyn-
don B. Johnson. 
The signing of the law that established 
Medicare forged a promise with American sen-
iors that we must not allow Donald J. Trump 
to take from them. 
America’s word matters and our promise to 
our seniors cannot be allowed to be broken. 
Both Medicare and Medicaid promise our 
nation’s elderly and poor that they could enjoy 
their lives with peace of mind and the security 
of 
reliable, 
affordable, 
and 
high-quality 
healthcare. 
Medicaid created a crucial partnership be-
tween the Government and the governed to 
provide a basic health care safety net for 
some of the most vulnerable Americans: chil-
dren of adults with low incomes, persons with 
disabilities and the poor. 
Mr. Speaker, over half a century later, the 
legacy of these programs has proven how 
powerful government action can be to the life 
and wellbeing of our nation’s most vulnerable. 
Today, the Trump administration is trying to 
go back on this promise. 
On January 30, the Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services (CMS) released its long-ru-
mored guidance on Medicaid block grants. 
This notice to state Medicaid directors in-
vites states to restructure their Medicaid pro-
grams in a radical manner previously rejected 
by Congress, by capping federal funding at an 
artificially low level. Millions of Americans will 
be denied health care because of this draco-
nian directive. Also persons who are disabled, 
children, and seniors will be most impacted. 
We should vote no on cutting medicaid and 
making Americans sicker. 
Medicaid’s financing is already based on 
federal matching of state Medicaid costs. 
The current program reimburses states as 
they spend money to pay for Medicaid serv-
ices, with the federal government paying for a 
portion of state costs ranging from 50 percent 
to 90 percent, depending on the nature of the 
cost and the state. 
State fiscal flexibility is therefore built into 
Medicaid: States can spend what is needed 
on Medicaid knowing that their match rate is 
fixed in statute. 
Today, 70 million Americans rely on Med-
icaid for health care, ranging from preventive 
services, hospital visits, lab tests, to critical 
medical supplies, and prescription drugs. 
Before the Medicaid, funding poor families 
with children, pregnant women, and low-in-
come working Americans were not able to af-
ford even the most basic medical care they 
needed to remain healthy and productive. 
The most likely group to be block granted 
under HAO in the next several months is 
therefore the Medicaid expansion population, 
composed of adults who are under 138 per-
cent of the federal poverty level and do not 
otherwise qualify for Medicaid as disabled, as 
a very low-income parent, or as a pregnant 
woman. 
However, according to the guidance that 
CMS released, other groups of Medicaid 
beneficiaries are also vulnerable to a federal 
approval of a similar block grant if they are in 
any way optional for states to cover. 
The HAO guidance is a quid pro quo that 
proffers to states accept financial risk in return 
for new flexibility. 
But ‘‘flexibility’’ in this case is simply another 
route to cuts to Medicaid that are not allowed 
under the Medicaid statute. 
As detailed below, HAO allows states to 
make otherwise disallowed cuts to Medicaid 
eligibility, benefits, and provider payment 
rates. 
The underlying reason for changing eligi-
bility is to reduce the numbers of those cov-
ered. 
In my home state of Texas and in commu-
nities across the U.S. Medicare and Medicaid 
are vital programs that have significantly 
changed the lives and improved health out-
comes of many Americans over the past cen-
tury and represent the best American values 
where we believe Health is a Human right not 
a commodity. Medicaid is also really needed 
when communities face natural disasters like 
hurricane Harvey in Texas. 
Unfortunately, Texas has the highest per-
centage of uninsured (27.6 percent) in the na-
tion, 4 percent more than Louisiana the next 
state on the list and has opted out of partici-
pating in Medicaid expansion. 
The State of Texas’ refusal to participate in 
the Medicaid expansion created by the Afford-
able Care act has already put the poor resi-
dents in my state in jeopardy, with this pro-
posed change many more will be at risk of 
losing health insurance. 
In the 18th Congressional District there are 
195,400 persons with Medicaid. 
Mr. Speaker, my constituents in the 18th 
Congressional District of Texas favor access 
to universal health care, because they under-
stand the insecurity and feeling of helpless-
ness of being uninsured or underinsured. 
I join my colleagues in support of H. Res. 
826 because it sends a clear message to this 
Administration and the American people that 
the House of Representatives—the People’s 
House will not tolerate harmful changes to crit-
ical health care programs like Medicaid by this 
Administration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
COURTNEY). All time for debate has ex-
pired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 833, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
resolution. 
The question is on the resolution. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this question will be post-
poned.

PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO 
ORGANIZE ACT OF 2019 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 2474, 
the Protecting the Right to Organize 
Act of 2019. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 833 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in 
the Committee of the Whole House on 
the state of the Union for the consider-
ation of the bill, H.R. 2474. 
The Chair appoints the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER) to pre-
side over the Committee of the Whole. 
b 1536 
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 
Accordingly, 
the 
House 
resolved 
itself into the Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union for the 
consideration of the bill (H.R. 2474) to 
amend the National Labor Relations 
Act, the Labor Management Relations 
Act, 1947, and the Labor-Management 
Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 
and for other purposes, with Mr. BLU-
MENAUER in the chair. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the 
bill is considered read the first time. 
General debate will be confined to 
the bill and shall not exceed 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the 
Committee 
on 
Education 
and 
Labor. 
The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT) and the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Chair, throughout their history, 
America’s labor unions have enabled 
millions of American workers to secure 
their place in the middle class and re-
ceive their fair share of the profits 
they produce. When workers have the 
power to stand together and negotiate 
with their employer, they have higher 
pay, better benefits, and safer working 
conditions. 
Unions not only benefit union mem-
bers, but also nonunion members ben-
efit from the higher wages that union 
members enjoy. And even the children 
of union members also do better. And 
under union contracts, pay gaps dis-
appear because union members get 
equal pay for equal work. 
But union membership, which peaked 
at around 30 percent of the workforce 
during the 1950s, is just at 10 percent 
today. That is the lowest level since 
just after the National Labor Relations 
Act was enacted in 1935. It is not a co-
incidence that as union membership 
has decreased, income inequality has 
increased. 
This decline in union membership is 
not a function of workers’ choices. A 
recent study found that nearly half of 
nonunion workers would join a union if 
given the chance. The gap between 
worker preferences and union member-
ship is the product of intensified 
antiworker attacks and labor laws that 
fail to address unfair labor practices. 
The lesson from the last 40 years is 
clear: That it is our current labor laws 
that are too weak to defend workers’ 
rights to join a union and to collec-
tively bargain with their employer. 
H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to 
Organize Act, or the PRO Act, is the 
most significant upgrade in U.S. labor 
laws in 80 years. This comprehensive 
proposal makes sensible reforms to 
protect and strengthen workers’ rights. 
The PRO Act would put teeth in the 
Nation’s labor laws by authorizing the 
NLRB to assess meaningful civil pen-
alties when companies violate their 
workers’ rights to organize and bar-
gain. 
It will close loopholes that the cor-
porations use to misclassify workers as 
independent contractors instead of em-
ployees; thereby evading their obliga-
tion to bargain, as well as evading 
their obligation to pay minimum wage 
and overtime; provide Worker’s Com-
pensation, unemployment compensa-
tion, and employee benefits. 
It ensures that workers can decide 
whether to form a union without inter-
ference. Democracy in the workplace 
should be a right, not a fight. 
Too many Americans are now work-
ing too hard for too little. And while 
corporations are enjoying record-level 
profits, workers and their families are 
struggling to keep pace with rising 
costs of housing, childcare, education, 
and other essentials. 
So I urge my colleagues to support 
the PRO Act, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 
2474, the Protecting the Right to Orga-
nize Act of 2019. 
Big Labor is in a panic over plum-
meting 
union 
membership. 
Union 
bosses could self-correct and increase 
transparency and accountability to 
serve workers better, or dedicate more 
resources to union organizing, rather 
than attempting to organize less than 
one-tenth of 1 percent of eligible em-
ployees, as they did in 2018. 
Instead, the largest federation of 
labor unions in America spends more 
than three times as much money on po-
litical activities as it does on its stated 
purpose of organizing and representing 
workers. And they are resorting to 
their usual arm-twisting and intimida-
tion tactics by demanding Democrats 
pass the PRO Act. 
Before I get into the many, many 
failings of this bill, I want to correct 
the Democrats’ false narrative that the 
decline in union membership is hurting 
workers. 
Americans are benefiting from a 
booming economy, thanks to Repub-
lican tax and regulatory reforms. De-
spite Democrats’ false claims, wages 
are rising fastest for lower- and middle- 
income workers. Unemployment is at a 
50-year low, and millions of jobs have 
been created since President Trump 
took office. 
In fact, millions of poor Americans 
continue to move into the middle class, 
and millions in the middle class are 
moving into the ranks of the wealthy. 
The 
substantial 
economic 
mobility 
many 
Americans 
are 
experiencing 
should be celebrated. 
Instead, Democrats are trying to 
claim falsely that the economy isn’t 
working for average Americans, and 
the only way to fix it is to expand en-
forced unionism through coercive, so-
cialist schemes like the PRO Act. 
Let’s also remember that Federal law 
already protects the rights of employ-
ees to organize, and Republicans re-
spect that right. Any reforms to U.S. 
labor laws should help workers, not 
union bosses. 
The PRO Act will require employers 
to hand over workers’ private, personal 
information to union organizers, with-
out workers having any say in the mat-
ter. This would make it even easier for 
union organizers to target, harass and 
intimidate workers. 
It would also overturn all State 
right-to-work laws. These are laws that 
allow workers to decide for themselves 
whether to join a union and pay dues. 
If the PRO Act becomes law, workers 
will be forced to take money from their 
paychecks and give it to labor unions, 
even if they don’t want to be rep-
resented by a union. 
This provision is astonishing since 
we know that from 2010 to 2018, unions 
spent $1.6 billion in members’ dues on 
hundreds of left-wing groups, without 
first receiving consent from workers to 
do so. 
The PRO Act will also undermine 
workers’ rights to vote by secret bal-
lot. This is hypocrisy at its worst, or 
best. House Democrats elect their own 
leaders by secret ballot, and Democrats 
held up the USMCA trade deal to guar-
antee workers in Mexico had the right 
to a secret ballot. Yet, they are willing 
to deprive American workers of that 
same protection. 
Among the PRO Act’s most harmful 
provisions is the incorporation of Cali-
fornia’s newly-enacted, overly broad, 
and confusing definition of employee, 
which will deprive millions of Ameri-
cans of the opportunity to work inde-
pendently and start their own busi-
nesses. 
Bottom line, there are over 50 harm-
ful provisions in this bill that are bad 
for workers, job creators, and the U.S. 
economy. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H880 
February 6, 2020 
b 1545 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, low-income workers are being 
better paid because of State minimum 
wage laws that most Republicans op-
posed. And jobs created in the 35 
months of the Trump administration 
are fewer than the jobs created in the 
last 35 months of the Obama adminis-
tration. 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. WILSON), chair of the 
Subcommittee 
on 
Health, 
Employ-
ment, Labor, and Pensions. 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Chair, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in support of H.R. 2474, the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act, or 
the great PRO Act. The Subcommittee 
on Health, Employment, Labor, and 
Pensions, which I am privileged to 
chair, conducted three long, riveting 
hearings in the 116th Congress. During 
these hearings, we assessed a multitude 
of legal obstacles workers face in se-
curing union recognition and winning 
collective bargaining agreements. 
Some facts are indisputable. Collec-
tive bargaining gives America’s work-
ers an economic ladder and safer work-
ing conditions. There are so many un-
safe working conditions all over Amer-
ica. 
During our first hearing, we heard 
testimony from Cynthia Harper, who 
suffered a severe injury in an Ohio as-
sembly plant. Even though Cynthia 
was hurt, she did not give up. She 
fought for her rights. Cynthia was fired 
from her plant for organizing a union 
to win safer working conditions for 
herself and her coworkers. 
Incredibly, the National Labor Rela-
tions Act has no civil penalties that 
deter employers from violating work-
ers’ rights. Importantly, the PRO Act 
addresses this by establishing meaning-
ful penalties for companies that violate 
their employees’ rights. This impor-
tant legislation cements into law the 
principle that workers deserve the 
right to negotiate for a fair share of 
the wealth, wealth that their hard 
work, sweat, and tears helps to create 
for this Nation. 
This bill makes every American 
man’s, woman’s, and child’s life better. 
Make no mistake, anyone who has got-
ten a livable wage, equal pay for equal 
work, and a safe working environment 
should thank unions and support the 
PRO Act. Anyone who grew up in a 
middle-class home and is fighting to 
build a middle-class home for their own 
children should thank unions and sup-
port the PRO Act. Anyone who believes 
in growing wages, providing healthcare 
for all people, and protecting workers’ 
rights should thank unions and support 
the PRO Act. Anyone who knows we 
should protect the right to organize 
and institute financial penalties on 
companies that interfere should thank 
unions and support the PRO Act. 
Every single Member of Congress, 
Democrats and Republicans, House and 
Senate, represents working people, and 
this is a working people’s bill. 
Simply put, if you claim to fight for 
and support the interests of working 
people, you must support the PRO Act. 
I ask all of my colleagues, Democrats 
and Republicans, to support the work-
ing people of America and support the 
PRO Act. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
WALKER). 
Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chair, I thank 
Ranking Member FOXX for yielding me 
the time. 
Mr. Chair, today, I rise in strong op-
position to H.R. 2474, the PRO Act. In 
fact, the more you learn about this leg-
islation, the more the name fits. It is 
prounion boss. It is proshadiness. It is 
prounemployment. It is prohibitive. 
You know what it is not? It is not 
proworker. 
By repealing right-to-work laws, this 
legislation fails to protect workers 
from being forced into paying hefty 
union dues. With unemployment hit-
ting record lows and wages hitting 
record highs, our workers should be 
able to keep their paychecks, not hand 
them over to corrupt union bosses. 
By changing the classification of the 
majority of independent contractors to 
employees—that 
is 
important—this 
legislation will restrict workers, create 
confusion, 
reduce 
opportunity, 
and 
then increase costs. It also dramati-
cally expands the joint employer stand-
ard, trying to force businesses to re-
structure their entire business models. 
What might seem like an insignifi-
cant or a small change would actually 
result in the labor union mafia taking 
our booming economy in a one-way 
ride. In fact, this legislation is esti-
mated to cost employers and workers 
more than $47 billion—with a B—$47 
billion annually. 
For a party that likes to talk about 
the right to choose when it comes to 
our most essential rights, why are 
House Democrats trying to restrict the 
power of choice for an entire industry 
of workers, and in doing so, forcing 
middle-income workers to hand over 
their earnings? 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
blatant effort to reinstate a mob boss 
rule and vote against H.R. 2474. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI), 
the chair of the Subcommittee on Civil 
Rights and Human Services. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chair, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Income inequality is challenging our 
communities and our future. In north-
west Oregon and across the country, 
the labor movement has helped fight 
income inequality, raise wages, im-
prove working conditions, and expand 
benefits. 
More workers would join a union if 
given a choice, but many feel retalia-
tion for supporting or engaging in or-
ganizing efforts. Under current law, 
tactics to intimidate, coerce, or fire 
workers involved in union organizing 
are illegal, but the penalties aren’t 
strong enough to deter employers. 
I helped ban captive audience meet-
ings when I served in the Oregon legis-
lature, but these rights should be pro-
tected for every worker in the country. 
We should be making it easier, not 
harder, for workers to form unions and 
collectively bargain. 
I am an original cosponsor of Chair-
man SCOTT’s Protecting the Right to 
Organize Act. Under this bill, employ-
ers who break the rules will finally be 
held accountable. 
Today, by supporting the bipartisan 
PRO Act, we can support workers, re-
store fairness, and help to make sure 
our economy works for everyone. 
Mr. Chairman, I insert in the RECORD 
letters in support of the PRO Act from 
the BlueGreen Alliance and more than 
70 environmental groups.

THY: As a coalition of some of the nation’s 
largest labor unions and environmental orga-
nizations, collectively representing millions 
of members and supporters, we write to ex-
press the BlueGreen Alliance’s support for 
the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) 
Act of 2019, H.R. 2474. 
In the United States, we face a critical 
juncture for the rights of employees to orga-
nize. As Supreme Court cases and anti-union 
legislators and their financial backers seek 
to strip workers of their rights, we need a 
strong law on the books to ensure that work-
ers are not penalized for organizing and de-
manding collective bargaining for higher 
wages, safer working conditions, and better 
benefits. 
Union membership has fallen dramatically 
from 33 percent in 1956 to ten percent in 2018, 
due in large part to exploitation by employ-
ers of labor laws that have been made tooth-
less. As it stands, no meaningful penalties 
exist for corporations using illegal tactics to 
eliminate the option to organize. 
Additionally, 
workers 
now 
are 
facing 
record wage inequality, and we know based 
on 
the 
National 
Bureau 
of 
Economic 
Research’s statistics that unions consist-
ently provide working Americans with ten to 
twenty percent higher wages than non- 
unionized workers. Empowering workers to 
band together to negotiate better wages and 
safer working conditions is the best path for-
ward to protecting our workers and rebuild-
ing America’s middle class. 
Organizing does not just affect job quality, 
though: 
unionized 
workers 
are 
better 
equipped to handle potentially hazardous 
workplace situations, and have more free-
dom to blow the whistle in dangerous situa-
tions. This can avert industrial accidents 
and result in safer communities, as well as 
cleaner air and water. Many unions also take 
firm positions on environmental issues be-
cause they understand the impact that clean 
air and water have on workers. Unions have 
supported the Clean Air Act, the Clean 
Water Act, and other actions designed to 
both reduce the carbon pollution driving cli-
mate change and grow good-paying jobs in 
the clean economy. 
The PRO Act empowers employees by 
strengthening workers’ rights to bargain and 
to organize. It does so by ending prohibitions

on collective and class-action litigation, pro-
hibiting employers from permanently replac-
ing striking employees, amending how em-
ployees are defined so that no one is 
misclassified as an independent contractor, 
strengthening remedies and enforcement for 
employees who are exercising their rights, 
creating a mediation and arbitration process 
for new unions, protecting against coercive 
captive audience meetings, and streamlining 
the National Labor Relations Board’s proce-
dures. 
The PRO Act would take tangible steps to 
stem the tide of continued violations of the 
rights of working people to organize and 
would provide real consequences for those 
who violate the rights of workers. We must 
restore fairness to our economy so that 
workers no longer get a raw deal, and 
strengthen the right of workers all over the 
country to unionize and bargain for better 
working conditions. 
For these reasons, the BlueGreen Alliance 
urges you to vote yes on the PRO Act. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Sincerely, 
JASON WALSH, 
Executive Director, BlueGreen Alliance. 
5 FEBRUARY 2020. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE: As organizations 
dedicated to a sustainable future, we believe 
that such a future must include fair treat-
ment for the people and communities work-
ing to build a clean and thriving economy. 
For that reason, we support H.R. 2474, the 
Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, 
and urge you to vote in favor of the bill when 
it comes before the House this week. 
Since 1970, global carbon dioxide emissions 
have nearly doubled, spiking the frequency 
and intensity of natural disasters, increasing 
the risk of drought, and putting the future of 
our entire planet at risk. Over that same pe-
riod, income and wealth inequality have ex-
ploded in the United States and elsewhere— 
incomes have risen by 229% in the U.S. for 
the top 1% of earners since 1979, while the 
bottom 90% of households have seen income 
growth of just 46%, or 1% on an annual basis. 
These parallel trends reflect an economy 
built to serve the interests of a small group 
of the extremely wealthy and powerful, not 
people or the planet. 
One key element of fixing our broken eco-
nomic system is ensuring that working peo-
ple have a voice in the economy and earn a 
fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work. Workers 
are often unable to have their voices heard 
or to earn fair pay, a function of weak labor 
laws that have made it virtually impossible 
for workers to organize and form unions in 
the face of unrelenting, aggressive corporate 
opposition. 
The PRO Act would make common-sense 
changes to existing law to enable workers 
who want to organize and form unions to do 
so. It would penalize corporations that break 
the law, limit tactics used to intimidate 
workers, help workers who organize secure 
timely collective bargaining agreements, 
and institute a number of changes to better 
enable workers to act in solidarity with one 
another. 
Remaking our economy and environment 
to address climate change and rising inequal-
ity will require substantial investment and 
transition, across many sectors. This is an 
opportunity to create millions of good jobs 
with family-sustaining wages and strong 
worker protections. We need strong, com-
mon-sense worker protections like those in 
the PRO Act to ensure that a sustainable 
economy reverses rather than reinforces ris-
ing inequity. There is no way to build a 
greener, more inclusive economy without 
strong, thriving labor unions. 
Our planet and our communities are under 
enormous threat. We must act urgently to 
confront the dangers imposed by climate 
change, including by ensuring that working 
people are treated fairly and helping lead the 
transition to a fair, green economy. The PRO 
Act would help advance that goal and help us 
rebuild our economy to function for both 
people and the planet. Therefore, we urge 
you to vote in favor of the PRO Act.

Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Chairman, I 
thank Chairman SCOTT for his leader-
ship. I urge my colleagues to support 
this bill. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chairman, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
This week, in this very Chamber, we 
heard from President Trump about the 
great American comeback. Our boom-
ing economy is a result of proworker, 
progrowth, and pro-American policies 
passed during the 115th Congress and 
enacted by President Trump. 
Wages are rising. Jobs are being cre-
ated. And Americans from all different 
backgrounds are getting back to work, 
including workers without high school 
diplomas, who are experiencing the 
lowest unemployment rate recorded in 
U.S. history. 
This body must build on this success, 
not go backward. The radical PRO Act 
will undoubtedly hurt the economy and 
force Americans out of work. In fact, a 
report 
from 
the 
American 
Action 
Forum found employers could face 
more than $47 billion in new annual 
costs if the PRO Act becomes law. 
As a small business owner, I know 
firsthand the PRO Act would harm 
both employers and employees. The 
PRO Act contains numerous poison 
pills, from outrageous privacy viola-
tions to forced union dues. 
This bill would outright ban the 
right-to-work laws that have been suc-
cessful in States like my home State of 
Georgia, which has been named the 
best State to do business in now 7 years 
in a row. 
Without right-to-work laws, workers 
are forced to pay for representation 
and political activities that they may 
not even agree with. From 2010 to 2018, 
unions spent more than $1.6 billion in 
member dues to hundreds of leftwing 
groups. Those include Planned Parent-
hood and the Clinton Foundation. 
That is why I offered an amendment, 
which I hope everyone will support, to 
strike 
that 
provision 
and 
protect 
States’ right-to-work laws. The Fed-
eral Government should not restrict 
American workers’ First Amendment 
rights by forcing them to pay union 
dues. 
The PRO Act will restrict our boom-
ing economy and infringe on the rights 
of workers and employers. The Amer-
ican worker deserves fairness, and he 
deserves choice. 
My colleagues have a choice before 
them. They can stand with Americans 
and President Trump to keep America 
great and free by voting ‘‘no’’ on the 
PRO Act, or they can join the radicals 
who have seized the Democratic Party 
and put America on a path of social-
ism. I will always stand with liberty 
and President Trump and will proudly 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the PRO Act. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN), the co- 
chair of the Progressive Caucus. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chair, I insert in the 
RECORD a letter from the AFL–CIO. 
AFL–CIO, 
January 30, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
AFL-CIO, I urge you to support the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, H. 
R. 2474, and to oppose weakening amend-
ments and any Motion to Recommit when 
the House of Representatives considers the 
bill next week. The PRO Act will restore the 
original intent of the National Labor Rela-
tions Act (NLRA), which was to give work-
ing people a voice on the job so they can ne-
gotiate for higher wages, better benefits, a 
more secure retirement and a safer work-
place. 
For too long, employers have been able to 
violate the NLRA with impunity, routinely 
denying workers their basic right to join 
with coworkers for fairness on the job. As a 
result, the collective strength of workers to 
negotiate for better pay and benefits has 
eroded and income inequality has reached 
levels that predate the Great Depression. 
(Please see the attached summary of recent re-
search on unions, inequality and the economy). 
The PRO Act would modernize the NLRA 
by bringing its remedies in line with other

workplace laws. In addition to imposing fi-
nancial penalties on companies and indi-
vidual corporate officers who violate the 
law, the bill would give workers the option 
of bringing their case to federal court. The 
bill would make elections fairer by prohib-
iting employers from requiring their employ-
ees to attend ‘‘captive audience’’ meetings 
whose sole purpose is to convince workers to 
vote against the union. 
Under the bill, once workers vote to form 
a union, the National Labor Relations Board 
(NLRB) would be authorized to order that 
the employer commence bargaining a first 
contract. These orders would be enforced in 
district courts to ensure swift justice. In ad-
dition, the bill would ensure that employees 
are not deprived of their right to a union be-
cause their employer hides behind a subcon-
tractor or other intermediary, or delib-
erately misclassifies them as supervisors or 
independent contractors. 
Too often, when workers choose to form a 
union, employers stall the bargaining proc-
ess to avoid reaching an agreement. The 
PRO Act would establish a process for medi-
ation and arbitration to help the parties 
achieve a first contract. This important 
change would make the freedom to negotiate 
a reality for countless workers who form 
unions but never get to enjoy the benefits of 
a collective bargaining agreement. 
The PRO Act recognizes that employees 
need the freedom to picket or withhold our 
labor in order to push for the workplace 
changes we seek. The bill protects employ-
ees’ right to strike by preventing employers 
from hiring permanent replacement workers. 
It also allows unrepresented employees to 
engage in collective action or class action 
lawsuits to enforce basic workplace rights, 
rather than being forced to arbitrate such 
claims alone. 
Finally, the bill would eliminate state 
right to work laws. These laws have been 
promoted by a network of billionaires and 
special interest groups to give more power to 
corporations at the expense of workers, and 
have had the effect of lowering wages and 
eroding pensions and health care coverage in 
states where they have been adopted. 
Restoring our middle class is dependent on 
strengthening the collective power of work-
ers to negotiate for better pay and working 
conditions. That is why public support for 
unions is the highest it has been in decades. 
We urge you to support the PRO Act and 
help us build an economy that works for all 
working families. 
Sincerely, 
WILLIAM SAMUEL, 
Director, Government Affairs. 
Mr. POCAN. Mr. Chair, as one of the 
few union members in Congress, let me 
tell you that the benefits that workers 
and families earn from being in a union 
are significant. 
Workers in a union make almost 
$10,000 more per year, and 70 percent of 
workers in a union have a pension plan 
compared to just 13 percent of non-
union workers. 
The problem is there have been dec-
ades-long coordinated attacks on work-
ers’ rights to join or form a union. It is 
time to make it easier for workers to 
have a voice in their workplace, and we 
have got some work to do. 
There are laws that make it harder 
to organize, and employees involved in 
organizing face barriers, including a 
one-in-five chance of getting fired. 
Even when workers do form a union, 
employers refuse to bargain, and more 
than half of the unions don’t get a col-
lective bargaining agreement within a 
year. 
If you vote to form a union, you 
should have one and get a contract. If 
you are an employee, you shouldn’t be 
misclassified as an independent con-
tractor. And if an employer violates 
your labor rights, they shouldn’t be let 
off the hook. 
I am proud to support workers’ 
rights, and I am proud to support the 
Protecting the Right to Organize Act. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
South 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
TIMMONS). 
Mr. TIMMONS. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today in strong opposition to the PRO 
Act. 
Our economy is booming. The unem-
ployment rate is at a record low. The 
PRO Act would interfere with this his-
toric progress by adding more Federal 
regulations on the very businesses that 
have been responsible for this growth. 
Employers and businesses could face 
more than $47 billion in new annual 
costs if this bill becomes law. This bill 
would force employees to take a public 
vote on whether they would want to be 
a part of a union, a rule that the House 
Democrats do not even follow them-
selves. 
Democrats even held up the USMCA 
vote to guarantee the right to a secret 
ballot, yet they are depriving the 
American worker of that same protec-
tion in the PRO Act. Over half of the 
States in this country have passed 
their own right-to-work laws, including 
my home State of South Carolina. 
The PRO Act would effectively inval-
idate those laws by forcing workers to 
pay union dues in order to keep their 
jobs. This is a gross overreach of the 
Federal Government and something we 
need less of not more of throughout 
this country. 
The PRO Act is yet another example 
of Democratic partisanship and a fla-
grant power grab and is, as many other 
things we have done this year, not 
going to get a hearing in the Senate. I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY), a 
distinguished member of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chair, I rise in 
support of the Protecting the Right to 
Organize Act, which is a pro-middle- 
class measure that, if enacted, would 
increase incomes, improve benefits, 
and promote better working conditions 
for tens of millions of Americans. 
The bill essentially debugs all the 
outdated gaps and loopholes that a cot-
tage industry of unscrupulous lawyers 
and consultants have exploited over 
the last 50 years to delay and deny 
Americans their right to organize for a 
better standard of living. 
The data is crystal clear. The decline 
of unions since the 1970s has coincided 
with wage stagnation for the middle 
class and the skyrocketing wealth of 
Americans in the top one-tenth of 1 
percent, re-creating our new gilded age 
of outrageous income inequality. 
The rights this bill will secure have 
been 
internationally 
recognized 
as 
basic human rights in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights by the 
United Nations Charter in the wake of 
World War II and the Vatican in Pope 
Leo XII’s encyclical Rerum Novarum 
in 1891. The right to organize ‘‘is the 
natural right,’’ Leo wrote, ‘‘and the 
state has for its office to protect nat-
ural rights, not to destroy them.’’ 
Passage of this bill will protect those 
rights. Please vote ‘‘yes’’ for the PRO 
Act. 
Mr. Chairman, I insert in the RECORD 
a letter from 2 million members of the 
Service 
Employees 
International 
Union, signed by its president, Mary 
Kay Henry, in support of this legisla-
tion. 
SEIU, 
May 8, 2019. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 2 
million members of the Service Employees 
International Union (‘‘SEIU’’), we write to 
endorse the Protecting the Right to Organize 
(‘‘PRO’’) Act of 2019. This important bill 
would strengthen working Americans’ rights 
to join together in unions and bargain for 
higher wages and better working conditions 
to help create balanced, inclusive growth. 
In today’s economy, too many people are 
working longer hours for lower wages, even 
as corporate profits soar. Unions are the best 
solution to leveling the playing field. But be-
cause of a concerted effort to undermine 
unions in America over the past forty years, 
just 6% of private sector working people 
have a say in the decisions that affect them 
at work, in their communities and in our 
economy. Too many unscrupulous employers 
take advantage of America’s outdated labor 
laws to stifle the ability of working people to 
join together in unions to improve their jobs 
and build a better future for their families. 
The PRO Act would reinvigorate labor law 
to help build an economy that works better 
for the millions of people who work for a liv-
ing—not just those at the top. We applaud 
the bill’s joint employer provision, which 
would ensure that workers can meaningfully 
bargain with all companies that actually 
control their employment. We also endorse 
the bill’s new standard to stop employers 
from misclassifying their workers as inde-
pendent contractors or supervisors to escape 
their responsibilities. These changes would 
make it harder for companies to circumvent 
basic worker protections through subcon-
tracting arrangements or other evasions. 
We also strongly support the PRO Act’s re-
forms banning anti-worker state laws that 
supersede collective bargaining agreements. 
These so-called Right-to Work laws weaken 
workers’ voice at the workplace, drive down 
wages, and threaten the economic security of 
all workers—union and nonunion alike. 
Working people subject to these laws earn 
$1,558 less per year than those who are not. 
The PRO Act permits companies and work-
ers to decide for themselves whether to nego-
tiate fair share agreements in collective bar-
gaining. 
In addition, we are pleased to see PRO Act 
provisions that would deter employer mis-
conduct by making remedies meaningful, pe-
nalizing the most egregious violations, lim-
iting interference in union elections, and fa-
cilitating first contracts with newly formed 
unions. The bill rightfully removes re-
straints 
on 
workers’ 
solidarity 
actions 
across different workplaces. 
Working people around the country ur-
gently need new laws like the PRO Act to

make it easier for people to join unions and 
hold companies accountable. The PRO Act’s 
much-needed reforms will help level the 
playing field for people like Jim Staus who 
testified in support of the PRO Act before 
House Education and Labor Committee, 
Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions 
Subcommittee on May 8, 2019. Although the 
federal government twice found that Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) il-
legally fired Jim for trying to form a union, 
six years later he still has not returned to 
work at UPMC, nor has he seen a penny of 
back-pay. If the PRO Act were law, Jim and 
so many other working people around the 
country would not have to risk everything to 
organize their unions to have a seat at the 
table in determining their families and com-
munity’s future, the same way their bosses 
and corporations do. 
SEIU members are proud to support the 
PRO Act. We will add any future votes on 
this legislation to our legislative scorecard. 
Sincerely, 
MARY KAY HENRY, 
International President.

Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I 
thank my good friend from North Caro-
lina for yielding. 
I rise today in strong opposition to 
H.R. 2474, but not necessarily because 
of some of the reasons that I have 
heard, though questionable, from my 
friends on the other side of the aisle. 
As the son of a machinist tool and 
die maker and a former union steel-
worker myself, I value the time-hon-
ored role unions play in our workforce. 
I can remember some of the argu-
ments that my dad made for the unions 
in the steel mills’ machine shops where 
he worked. I also remember many of 
the arguments he made for unions 
going above and beyond, in the sense of 
going too far, for their own protection 
and not that of the employees. 
But any reforms we make to Federal 
labor laws should put workers first, not 
union leaders first. When we fail to do 
that, it opens the door to extravagant 
abuses of power. Just look at what is 
happening in Michigan, sadly, with the 
corruption scandal at the top levels of 
the UAW. 
How can we even entertain a trans-
formational labor law at a time when 
members of the UAW leadership are 
under an ongoing Federal investigation 
for using members’ dues to pay for 
UAW leadership’s lavish trips to Cali-
fornia featuring poolside villas, top- 
shelf liquor, fine cigars, golf, and even 
a $1,200 bill at a Hollywood salon. In 
our ethics investigations, we would 
certainly put those to the top of our 
concerns. 
This corruption scandal has already 
yielded 11 convictions. Two previous 
UAW presidents have been formally 
implicated as members of a racket-
eering enterprise within the union—I 
hate hearing those words, because 
those impact union membership and 
their dues—and the current president, 
who took over because of the corrup-
tion allegations against the former 
presidents, has come under Federal in-
vestigation as well. 
We should, instead, be looking into 
these abuses as our committee rather 
than turning a blind eye and passing 
legislation that will, instead, consoli-
date special interest power to coerce 
workers by undermining their right to 
privacy. 
Clearly, this bill sends exactly the 
wrong message at the wrong time. It is 
not speaking for the hardworking fami-
lies we represent, the hardworking 
union members we represent. They de-
serve better, and that is what this leg-
islation doesn’t offer. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. POCAN). The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr 
chair, I yield an additional 10 seconds 
to the gentleman from Michigan. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chair, I simply 
cannot, in good faith, support a bill 
that undermines basic freedoms for 
workers and takes our labor laws back-
wards. Instead, let’s put workers’ inter-
ests first by focusing on protecting and 
expanding workers’ rights within their 
union. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. JUDY CHU). 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. 
Chair, before I begin, I enter into the 
RECORD letters in support of the PRO 
Act from the American Federation of 
Musicians and the International Alli-
ance of Theatrical Stage Employees. 
AMERICAN
FEDERATION
OF
MUSI-
CIANS OF THE UNITED STATES AND 
CANADA, 
New York, NY, February 4, 2020. 
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: On behalf of 
80,000 members of the American Federation 
of Musicians, I write urging your support of 
H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to Orga-
nize Act (‘‘PRO Act’’) and ask that you op-
pose any amendments or any offensive mo-
tions that may be offered during House delib-
erations. 
The PRO Act strengthens the National 
Labor Relations Act by supporting the abil-
ity of working people to have a voice on the 
job. The bill would update the National 
Labor Relations Act to allow workers to 
have a greater say in such important work-
place issues as higher wages and retirement 
security. Once workers vote to form a union, 
the National Labor Relations Board could 
seek enforcement and relief in federal court 
allowing for swifter justice. In addition, the 
bill would prohibit employers from forcing 
workers to attend captive audience meetings 
designed to encourage workers from voting 
against the union. Companies and corporate 
officers would be confronted with stiff finan-
cial penalties for violating the law. 
The PRO act also establishes a mediation 
and arbitration process to prevent employers 
from avoiding the completion of a first con-
tract. Historically, many employers attempt 
to stall first-contract negotiations in an ef-
fort to frustrate and in some cases stop the 
collective bargaining process, often after 
union 
organizers 
and 
negotiators 
have 
worked for years to finalize a first contract. 
The bill also supports workers’ right to 
picket or withhold their labor in order to 
push for workplace changes. It also protects 
employees’ right to strike and prevents an 
employer from hiring permanent replace-
ment workers and allows unrepresented 
workers to participate in collective action 
and class action lawsuits against unscrupu-
lous employers. 
Finally, HR 2474 eliminates state right to 
work laws which over the years have given 
more power to billionaires and special inter-
est groups at the expense of lowering worker 
wages, eroding pensions and healthcare cov-
erages in states where such laws have been 
enacted. 
We urge you to support the PRO Act. 
Thank you. 
Sincerely yours, 
RAYMOND M. HAIR, JR., 
International President, 
American Federation of Musicians of the 
United States and Canada. 
NEW YORK, NY, FEBRUARY 3, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the ap-
proximately 125,000 American members of 
the International Alliance of Theatrical 
Stage Employees (IATSE), I urge you to sup-
port the Protecting the Right to Organize 
(PRO) Act, H.R. 2474, and to oppose weak-
ening amendments and any Motion to Re-
commit when the House of Representatives 
considers the bill. The PRO Act will restore 
fairness to the economy by strengthening 
the federal laws that give working people a 
voice on the job so they can negotiate for 
higher wages, better benefits, a more secure 
retirement and a safer workplace. 
Too often, when workers choose to form a 
union, employers stall the bargaining proc-
ess to avoid reaching an agreement—as evi-
denced by riggers in the Pacific Northwest 
employed by Rhino Staging Northwest who 
voted in 2015 to be represented by Local 15 of 
the IATSE, but today still don’t have a con-
tract. 
These 
riggers—who 
work 
high 
above 
stages, on scaffolding or catwalks, installing 
complex lighting and audio equipment—fol-
lowed state and federal labor laws, and over 
many years organized themselves. Fed up 
with 
low 
pay, 
no 
employer-funded 
healthcare, and unsafe working conditions 
they voted to unionize. 
Yet, after these workers voted for the 
union, Rhino refused to bargain in good faith 
as required by federal labor law. Rhino chal-
lenged the union before the National Labor 
Relations Board (NLRB) and in federal court. 
It lost. It has stalled and delayed and still 
today has not entered into a contract. 
This is just one example of how some em-
ployers have been able to violate the Na-
tional Labor Relations Act (NLRA) with im-
punity, routinely denying workers their 
basic right to join with coworkers for fair-
ness on the job. Time after time, employers 
get away with it. 
The PRO Act would establish a process for 
mediation and arbitration to help the parties 
achieve a first contract. This important 
change would make the freedom to negotiate 
a reality for countless workers who form 
unions but never get to enjoy the benefits of 
a collective bargaining agreement. 
The PRO Act would modernize the NLRA 
by bringing its remedies in line with other 
workplace laws. In addition to imposing fi-
nancial penalties on companies and indi-
vidual corporate officers who violate the 
law, the bill would give workers the option 
of bringing their case to federal court. 
Under the bill, once workers vote to form 
a union, the National Labor Relations Board 
(NLRB) would be authorized to order that 
the employer commence bargaining a first 
contract. These orders would be enforced in 
district courts to ensure swift justice. In ad-
dition, the bill would ensure that employees 
are not deprived of their right to a union be-
cause their employer hides behind a subcon-
tractor or other intermediary, or delib-
erately misclassifies them as supervisors or 
independent contractors.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H884 
February 6, 2020 
The bill would also eliminate ‘‘right to 
work’’ laws; prohibit mandatory ‘‘captive au-
dience’’ meetings; and protect the right to 
strike, among other provisions. 
The PRO Act is a top priority for the 
IATSE, we urge you to support this bill and 
help us build an economy that works for all 
working families. 
Sincerely, 
MATTHEW D. LOEB, 
International President. 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. 
Chair, when I was a young college pro-
fessor in the Los Angeles Community 
College District, the board of trustees 
passed a measure that would lay off 
over 100 of us, even though we had ten-
ure. 
It was my union, the American Fed-
eration of Teachers, that organized the 
protests and stood up for us. The union 
saved my job. 
Yet, today, we see that there is a de-
cline in union membership. It is not be-
cause workers don’t want to be in a 
union. It is because employers have 
been allowed to use antiunion tactics, 
such as paying millions of dollars to 
professional union busters who come 
into the workplace to intimidate work-
ers in captive audience meetings. 
Even when workers vote to approve a 
union, more than half of them still do 
not have a collective bargaining agree-
ment 1 year later. That is because em-
ployers face few penalties for bar-
gaining in bad faith, while employees 
can be fired for striking and exercising 
their rights. 
The PRO Act is the best way to pro-
tect the right to organize and to help 
workers have the quality of life they 
deserve. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Chairman, I thank 
the ranking member for yielding. 
As a Virginian, I am proud that my 
State is currently one of the 27 that 
protects the fundamental right to 
work. Because of Virginia’s pro-busi-
ness and pro-employer stance, it has 
once again been ranked the number one 
State in which to do business by CNBC. 
Unfortunately, this is being threat-
ened both at the State level in the Vir-
ginia General Assembly and now at the 
Federal level through this bill, the 
PRO Act. 
Every American should have the 
right to get a job or keep a job without 
being required to join a labor union. 
This bill would inappropriately pre-
empt and prohibit that right, while 
concurrently violating the privacy of 
workers by forcing the sharing of their 
personal 
contact 
information 
with 
union organizers, even when this has 
been shown to enable harassment and 
intimidation of those very workers. 
This is unacceptable. 
The PRO Act would have grave im-
pacts on workers and businesses at a 
great cost to the fabric of our work-
force. 
Founding Father and fellow Vir-
ginian Thomas Jefferson said: ‘‘To 
compel a man to furnish contributions 
of money for the propagation of opin-
ions which he disbelieves is sinful and 
tyrannical.’’ 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in opposing this bill and to 
stand for the freedoms and success that 
our Founding Fathers believed in. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. TAKANO), a distin-
guished member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Chair, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in strong support of the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act. I 
rise in support of unions and millions 
of workers fighting for higher wages, 
better benefits, and safe working condi-
tions. 
For years, Republicans and corporate 
interests have been chipping away at 
the rights of workers in America. Em-
ployers are aggressively waging a cam-
paign against unions and against the 
best interests of their workers. 
It is illegal for employers to intimi-
date workers who want to join unions, 
but it is still happening, because these 
union-busting bosses are not being held 
responsible. The PRO Act will ensure 
that penalties are enforced to help put 
an end to these antiunion activities. 
American workers are putting in the 
work; they should also be reaping the 
rewards of their labor. The PRO Act 
will help workers stand together to de-
mand their fair share and to make 
their bosses listen. 
Mr. Chair, I enter into the RECORD a 
letter 
from 
the 
International 
Longshore and Warehouse Union in 
support of the PRO Act. 
INTERNATIONAL LONGSHORE & 
WAREHOUSE UNION, 
San Francisco, California, February 3, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: As President of the 
International 
Longshore 
and 
Warehouse 
Union (ILWU), I urge you to support the PRO 
Act (Protecting the Right to Organize Act, H.R. 
2474) when debated on the House Floor this 
week. The ILWU further urges you to oppose 
amendments that would weaken this impor-
tant legislation. 
The ILWU is committed to organizing the 
unorganized. We recently celebrated the first 
union contract for workers at Anchor Steam 
Brewing Co. in San Francisco, California. We 
have organized other workers into our great 
union, but have been unsuccessful in achiev-
ing a fair contract due to bad faith bar-
gaining. The truth is that every day workers 
are intimidated, threatened, and coerced 
simply because they aspire to join a union 
and achieve a better life. Our current labor 
law allows this immoral corporate behavior 
without meaningful consequences. 
The United States gave Americans the 
right to organize labor unions under the Na-
tional Labor Relations Act (NRLA). The in-
crease in unionization encouraged by the law 
significantly diminished income inequality 
over the next forty years. American workers 
prospered as a result of having a voice in the 
workplace. 
However, over time, corporations and their 
political 
allies 
have 
gutted 
organizing 
rights, and diminished unions, which has 
caused great economic disparities. The de-
cline in union density accounts for one third 
of the rise in income inequality among men 
and one fifth among women according to the 
Economic Policy Institute. 
The time is now to restore workers’ poten-
tial to organize. The PRO Act restores the 
balance of power we desperately need be-
tween workers and management. This bill 
authorizes the NLRB to assess monetary 
penalties for each violation in which a work-
ers is wrongfully terminated or suffers seri-
ous economic harm. The bill importantly im-
poses personal liability on corporate direc-
tors and officers who participate in viola-
tions of workers’ rights or have knowledge of 
and fail to prevent such violations. 
The PRO Act also gives workers the right 
to override so-called ‘‘right to work’’ laws 
that prevent unions from collecting dues 
from the people they represent. The bill 
would give employers and unions the right to 
enter into a contract that allows unions to 
collect fair share fees that cover the costs of 
collective bargaining and administering the 
contract. It is simply unfair and divisive for 
some non-dues paying workers to get a free 
ride off the backs of their fellow dues paying 
workers. 
Further, the Act protects First Amend-
ment rights by removing prohibitions on 
workers acting in solidarity with workers at 
other companies. The bill also prohibits 
companies 
from 
permanently 
replacing 
striking workers. 
A critical part of the legislation seeks to 
facilitate initial collective bargaining agree-
ments. Even when workers succeed in form-
ing a union, nearly half of newly formed 
unions fail to ever reach a contract with the 
employer. The bill facilitates first contracts 
between 
companies 
and 
newly 
certified 
unions by requiring mediation and arbitra-
tion to settle disputes. 
The ILWU fully supports the PRO Act and 
we urge you to actively support this impor-
tant legislation to benefit the organized 
labor and those workers who seek to join a 
union. It is time to restore the right to orga-
nize to American workers. 
Sincerely, 
WILLIAM ADAMS, 
President. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
SMUCKER). 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today in strong opposition to the PRO 
Act. 
Today’s egregious legislation really 
is mislabeled. It is called the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act, but 
it really should be renamed the Unfair 
to American Workers, or the UAW, 
Act. 
I strongly agree that our constitu-
tionally guaranteed rights, like the 
freedom of association, should be pro-
tected, but this bill doesn’t strengthen 
protections for all Americans. This bill 
upsets the balance between the right of 
employees to form a union and the 
right of individuals to refrain from 
joining a union. 
H.R. 2474 deliberately speeds up the 
union election process so that employ-
ees do not have the time to fully vet 
the pros and cons of joining a union. 
This bill also strips away critical pri-
vacy rights by forcing employers to 
hand over sensitive private employee 
information, such as where an em-
ployee lives, what work shifts they 
work, and more. 
Why do they want this information? 
So union leaders can stalk and harass 
employees until they agree to sign up.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H885 
February 6, 2020 
The PRO Act, in fact, leaves no cor-
ner of labor law untouched. This bill 
will disrupt the franchise model to 
eliminate a franchisee’s ability to op-
erate their business as their own, and 
it even decimates the sharing economy 
by codifying California’s ABC test. 
What is worse, this bill repeals every 
right-to-work law in the Nation, forc-
ing millions of Americans to con-
tribute to a union that they don’t need 
or that they don’t want. 
I offered a commonsense amendment 
to this bill that would require unions 
to seek employee consent when using 
dues for political purposes, but my 
amendment was blocked by Democrats 
from being even debated on the House 
floor. 
My colleagues on the left will claim 
that economic inequality has resulted 
because of declining union member-
ship, but we know this isn’t true. The 
economic success that we are seeing 
today, particularly for minority groups 
who have historically faced the most 
inequality, is changing thanks to poli-
cies put in place by a Republican Con-
gress and by President Trump. Wage 
growth is rising faster today for mi-
norities and individuals most impacted 
by economic inequality than for any 
other group. 
Rather than innovating to become 
more attractive to employees so they 
want to join, unions are trying to 
change Federal law to stack the deck 
against hardworking Americans. 
Americans 
aren’t 
rejecting 
union 
membership because current labor law 
acts as a barrier to forming one. They 
are declining to join because they are 
sick of seeing union leaders harass and 
coerce their colleagues; line their own 
pockets with dues, as we have seen ex-
hibited in the recent racketeering acts 
committed by former UAW leaders; and 
use employee dues to support political 
platforms that don’t align with an indi-
vidual’s views. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this harmful power grab. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS), a dis-
tinguished member of the Committee 
on Education and Labor. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today on an issue very personal to me 
and to American workers: the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act, or 
the PRO Act. 
I am a member of the IBEW for over 
40 years and a lifelong labor leader, a 
proud labor leader. I can attest to the 
importance of giving workers a voice 
by protecting them from unfair labor 
practices. 
I saw, firsthand, as workers were un-
justly fired, lost their wages, their job, 
because they dared to speak up about 
unionization; workers with families 
back home, living paycheck to pay-
check, who couldn’t afford to be out of 
work, but they understood how impor-
tant this was. 
Companies have the money. They 
hire the $1,000-an-hour lawyers. They 
delay, they delay, they delay. They 
would make an example out of one per-
son, as unjust as that is. They put the 
life of that worker on hold. 
Currently, the NLRA has no pen-
alties for employers that do this, that 
violate the law. If workers are fired, 
there is no current recourse. 
I would just ask that we support the 
PRO Act. 
Mr. Chair, I enter into the RECORD 
letters of support from the IBEW, the 
International Union of Operating Engi-
neers, and the International Union of 
Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers. 
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD 
OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS, 
Washington, DC, February 3, 2020. 
To: All Members of the United States House 
of Representatives. 
Re Protecting the Right to Organize Act. 
DEAR MEMBER OF CONGRESS: On behalf of 
the 775,000 active members and retirees of 
the International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers (IBEW), I urge you to vote in sup-
port of H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to 
Organize (PRO) Act, when it is considered by 
the full U.S. House of Representatives this 
week and to oppose weakening amendments 
and any Motion to Recommit. The PRO Act 
would restore the original intent of the Na-
tional Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to pro-
tect workers’ right to organize a union and 
negotiate higher wages and better benefits. 
The right to organize and collectively bar-
gain is a fundamental right of all Americans 
and the bedrock of a capitalist society that 
allows the benefits of a growing economy to 
be shared broadly between workers and em-
ployers. These fundamental rights, however, 
have been steadily undermined in recent dec-
ades. As a result, union membership has 
dropped precipitously from over 20 percent in 
1983 to just 10 percent in 2018. During the 
same period, incomes for the bottom half of 
income earners in the United States have 
grown by just one percent between 1980 and 
2014, while income for the top one percent in-
creased by 205 percent. Today, income in-
equality has reached levels that predate the 
Great Depression. 
The reason membership in labor unions is 
declining is not due to eroding interest in 
family-sustaining wages and benefits—it is 
because employers have the upper hand. 
Workers attempting to unionize often face a 
hostile legal environment and are commonly 
intimidated by aggressive anti-union em-
ployers. Outdated labor laws have failed to 
provide Americans with protection from this 
anti-worker onslaught against collective 
bargaining. 
The Economic Policy Institute published a 
report in December 2019 that found 41.5 per-
cent of all employers in a National Labor Re-
lations Board (NLRB) sponsored election 
were charged with violating federal labor 
law. The PRO Act would help even this vast-
ly tilted playing field by invoking stronger 
remedies for violating the law. Currently, 
there are no penalties on employers who ille-
gally fire or retaliate against workers at-
tempting to form a union. This legislation 
establishes compensatory damages for work-
ers and penalties against employers when 
they fire or retaliate against workers. In ad-
dition, the PRO Act streamlines the NLRB 
process so workers can petition to form a 
union and get a timely vote without their 
employer interfering or delaying the vote. It 
would also prohibit companies from forcing 
workers to attend mandatory captive audi-
ence meetings as a condition of continued 
employment. 
Even if workers do vote for union represen-
tation, more than half do not have a collec-
tive bargaining agreement a year later. The 
PRO Act would establish a process for reach-
ing a first agreement when workers organize. 
Employers often misclassify workers as su-
pervisors or independent contractors to de-
prive them of their rights under the NLRA 
while allowing management to skirt min-
imum wage, Social Security and workers’ 
compensation laws. The PRO Act tightens 
the definitions of independent contractor 
and 
supervisor 
to 
crack 
down 
on 
misclassification and extend NLRA protec-
tions to more eligible workers. 
Unions provide skills training and con-
tinuing education to their membership, as 
well as a more stable and safer workforce. A 
worker covered by a union contract earns 
more than 13 percent more in wages than a 
peer with similar education, occupation and 
experience in a non-union workplace in the 
same sector. Where unions are strong, wages 
are higher for typical workers—union and 
nonunion members alike. 
Research shows that workers want unions, 
evidenced by the large gap between the share 
of workers with union representation—about 
12 percent—and the share of workers that 
would like to have a voice on the job—48 per-
cent. The PRO Act would take a major step 
forward toward closing that gap. 
There is no better path to the middle class 
than a union job with the security it pro-
vides in salary, health benefits and retire-
ment income. Family sustaining middle 
class jobs are the route to economic secu-
rity, providing the crucial financial cushion 
that protect so many families on the edge of 
economic disaster once a job loss or a med-
ical emergency hits a family. Unions provide 
economic independence and self-sufficiency, 
and an expanding middle class is good for the 
economy and the country. 
The IBEW urges all members of the United 
States House of Representatives to stand 
with working Americans in every state and 
community and vote in favor of the PRO 
Act. 
Sincerely yours, 
LONNIE R. STEPHENSON, 
International President. 
INTERNATIONAL UNION OF 
OPERATING ENGINEERS, 
Washington, DC, January 31, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The International 
Union of Operating Engineers requests your 
support for the Protecting the Right to Or-
ganize (PRO) Act, H.R. 2474, and to oppose 
any weakening amendments and any Motion 
to Recommit when the House of Representa-
tives considers the bill. The PRO Act will re-
pair the National Labor Relations Act 
(NLRA) to protect workers and strengthen 
the fundamental rights of Operating Engi-
neers across the nation. 
The International Union of Operating En-
gineers (IUOE) is one of North America’s 
leading construction unions, representing 
nearly 400,000 hardworking men and women 
in the United States and Canada. Most mem-
bers of the IUOE work in the construction 
sector, operating and maintaining heavy 
equipment, in addition to other occupations 
in the industry. We represent heavy equip-
ment operators, mechanics, surveyors, and 
other occupations in the sector, and, build-
ing the nation’s public works is the bread 
and butter of the skilled, proud members of 
the Operating Engineers union. 
The PRO Act would reinforce the federal 
laws that protect workers’ right to organize 
a union and bargain for better wages, bene-
fits, and conditions at their workplaces. For 
decades, working families could depend on 
unions to represent their collective interests 
and, by encouraging collective bargaining, 
the NLRA offered protection and empowered 
workers to seek fairness on the job.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H886 
February 6, 2020 
Over the past 50 years, unethical employ-
ers have exploited labor laws and routinely 
denied workers their basic rights. While the 
collective strength of workers has eroded 
over time, income inequality has reached 
levels that predate the Great Depression. It 
is imperative that Congress protect the 
rights of workers in order to guarantee a 
healthy economy. 
This legislation addresses several major 
problems with the current law and tries to 
level a playing field that is currently 
stacked against workers. It will penalize em-
ployers for interfering in the workers’ right 
to form a union, conduct organizing cam-
paigns, and hold fair elections. It will 
strengthen their ability to negotiate first 
contract agreements and notably overrides 
so-called ‘‘right-to-work’’ laws by estab-
lishing a ‘‘fair share’’ clause. It will ensure 
workers have a voice on the job by prohib-
iting employers from permanently replacing 
strikers and repealing the prohibition on sec-
ondary boycotts. In addition, it will protect 
workers against misclassification—an egre-
gious tactic used in the construction indus-
try to dodge wage and hour standards. The 
PRO Act would ensure employers are not 
able to skirt their responsibilities for pay, 
benefits, and other working conditions. 
This legislation will close loopholes in fed-
eral laws and increase transparency in 
labormanagement relations. Without these 
essential protections, the playing field will 
remain heavily stacked against workers. 
Strengthening the collective power of work-
ers will strengthen our economy and restore 
the American middle class. We urge you to 
support the PRO Act to defend the dignity of 
work for all working families. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES T. CALLAHAN, 
General President. 
INTERNATIONAL
UNION
OF
BRICK-
LAYERS
AND
ALLIED 
CRAFTWORKERS, 
Washington, DC, January 31, 2020. 
DEAR HOUSE MEMBERS: On behalf of the 
International Union of Bricklayers and Al-
lied Craftworkers (BAC), I am writing to ex-
press our strong support for the Protecting 
the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, H.R. 2474. 
The PRO Act is historic legislation that will 
help level the playing field and help give 
workers the opportunity to exercise their 
right to organize a union. 
BAC is proud of the relationship that we 
share with our signatory employers across 
the United States to provide vital building 
and construction services to the commu-
nities we live in. However, our members, and 
just as importantly the contractors that hire 
them, are under assault by unscrupulous cor-
porations and employers that abuse and deny 
their workers from having a meaningful 
voice in the workplace. The PRO Act would 
help address these abuses and provide work-
ers a fair shot at forming a union of their 
choice to bargain for better wages, benefits, 
and conditions in the workplace. 
Too often, employers intentionally violate 
the law during organizing campaigns because 
some of the penalties are so weak that low 
road employers just view them as a small 
cost of doing the business of union busting. 
The PRO act strengthens penalties for such 
behavior in order to deter employers from 
interfering with workers’ rights. 
The PRO Act also clarifies the definition of 
independent contractor and supervisor to 
help prevent the misclassification of work-
ers. Misclassification is far too common in 
construction and other industries and it pre-
vents workers from exercising their rights, 
getting the pay and benefits they deserve, 
and deprives communities of much-needed 
revenue through tax evasion. 
Our economy is out of balance and it is 
time for Congress to step up to protect work-
ing class families and restore economic sta-
bility. We urge you to support the PRO Act 
and oppose any weakening amendments 
when the House of Representatives considers 
the bill. 
Sincerely, 
TIMOTHY J. DRISCOLL, 
President. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-
LER). 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Chair, I thank the 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
FOXX) for yielding. 
I rise today in opposition to the PRO 
Act. 
I have heard some things from the 
other side of the aisle about how work-
ers earn more in States that are not 
right-to-work. 
Of the right-to-work States, accord-
ing to the U.S. Department of Labor’s 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 7 of the top 
10 States in wage increases are right- 
to-work States. The highest right-to- 
work State, number one, saw an in-
crease in wages over the period of time 
from 2001 to 2019 of 20 percentage 
points, which is 20 percentage points 
more than the closest right-to-work 
State. 
This is not a bill about helping work-
ers. This is a bill about getting in the 
way of the relationship between the 
employee and employer. 
b 1615 
This is just another Democrat mes-
saging bill that is nothing short of a 
special interest giveaway. The PRO 
Act needlessly inserts more govern-
ment control into the employee-em-
ployer relationships. 
At 
a 
roundtable 
I 
held 
with 
businessowners in Pennsylvania’s 12th 
Congressional District, I heard first-
hand how legislation like this would 
negatively impact their ability to grow 
and raise wages. 
One of the many onerous provisions 
in this legislation is the allowance for 
intermittent strikes and banning per-
manent replacements. I am offering an 
amendment today to remove the inter-
mittent striking provisions of this bill. 
Intermittent striking would cripple 
the ability of job creators to do busi-
ness and raise prices on consumers. 
Even if this amendment were adopted, 
I still have significant reservations 
about the bill. That is because the PRO 
Act is also terrible for employees. 
Cloaked in the language of employee 
protection, the real result of the PRO 
Act is providing workers with fewer 
choices, fewer rights, and the inability 
to speak for themselves. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I yield the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania an additional 10 seconds. 
Mr. KELLER. Strikingly, the PRO 
Act would destroy employee privacy 
rights by requiring employers to give 
away employee identifying information 
to union bosses. 
If Congress really cares about jobs, 
the economy, and workers’ rights, it 
should say ‘‘no’’ to the PRO Act. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mrs. 
TRAHAN), a distinguished member of 
the Committee on Education and Labor 
who knows that union members make 
more than nonunion members. 
Mrs. 
TRAHAN. 
Mr. 
Chairman, 
I 
thank my friend from Virginia for 
yielding and for his steady leadership 
on this issue. 
Mr. Chairman, on Tuesday evening, 
the American people were treated to a 
number of fairy-tale promises. But 
none was more preposterous than the 
claim that the administration’s agenda 
has been ‘‘relentlessly proworker.’’ 
It has been relentless, all right. Re-
lentlessly hostile to our unions, par-
ticularly those seeking redress from 
the NLRB; relentless in favoring cor-
porate interests over working people, 
such as those deliberately misclassified 
as contractors; and relentless in its op-
position to permitting employees the 
right to have their day in court when 
their rights are violated. 
The 
PRO 
Act 
is 
what 
a 
real 
proworker agenda looks like: It levels 
the playing field for workers in orga-
nizing drives. It reorients the NLRB to 
defend workers who are unfairly tar-
geted. 
It 
blocks 
worker 
misclassifications, and it demands real 
penalties for violations of workers’ 
rights. 
I am pleased that the PRO Act in-
cludes my amendment to ban offensive 
lockouts, a cruel technique designed to 
bring workers to their knees rather 
than the negotiating table in good 
faith. The steelworkers in my home 
State of Massachusetts know that 
cruel tactic all too well. 
Mr. Chairman, as the daughter of a 
union 
ironworker 
and 
the 
grand-
daughter of a union carpenter, I have 
experienced firsthand why unions are 
the foundation of America’s middle 
class. I have lived the benefits that 
unions and organized labor bring to 
families across Massachusetts and the 
United States. 
I wouldn’t be standing here today 
without them. And it is perfectly clear 
why our unions must have their rights 
restored. Income inequality has risen 
as union membership has declined. It is 
time to reverse that trend. 
Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD a 
letter 
from

the dignity of work as a path to growth, 
human development, and personal fulfill-
ment. The PRO Act does just that by restor-
ing workers’ rights to collectively bargain, 
empowering them to negotiate for fair 
wages, benefits, retirement security, and 
protection from discrimination and harass-
ment. We urge a YES vote on the PRO Act to 
achieve 
fairness 
and 
justice 
for 
disenfranchised working people. 
Labor union participation has fallen pre-
cipitously over the years: from a third of 
wage and salaried workers in the United 
States to just 10.7 percent, as of 2017. Pro-
tecting the right to freely associate and or-
ganize at the workplace has been proven to 
help settle workplace disputes by restoring 
the balance of bargaining power between em-
ployers and employees. Workers and employ-
ers alike benefit from the institution of 
labor protections through unions. Disputes 
can be settled unfairly when the power dif-
ferential between the employer and em-
ployee goes unchecked. Without the power of 
collective bargaining, workers’ voices go un-
heard and workers’ concerns go unheeded. 
When Congress passed the National Labor 
Relations Act in 1953, they knew this. How-
ever, nearly every amendment to the law 
since has undermined its spirit—making it 
harder for working people to form unions, 
chipping away at workers’s rights, and 
harming the economy. The PRO Act would 
expand the full force of protections once of-
fered by the NRLA. 
The PRO Act would: shield workers from 
retaliation when they exercise their right to 
form a union, end mandatory arbritration in 
contracting, and apply a clear, fair standard 
of protection nationwide which ‘‘right to 
work’’ laws currently sidestep. 
The PRO Act would also: prevent further 
erosion of the law by penalizing employers 
that don’t comply, and apply simple tests to 
end misclassification of employees. 
The PRO Act is a historic proposal that 
faithfully restores dignity to workers and 
rightly appraises their value as full partici-
pants in the workplace and in the economy. 
We urge you to vote YES to pass the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act (H.R. 2474). 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Chair, it is time 
to pass the PRO Act. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the 
gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. 
JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Chairman, I rise in opposition to the 
misnamed Protecting the Right to Or-
ganize Act. 
The American economy is thriving 
by almost any economic measure, and 
it seems as though an important job of 
Congress would be to continue to sup-
port the workers, the employers, and 
the jobs that have been powering this, 
the longest economic expansion in 
American history. 
What we shouldn’t do is act to re-
strict State flexibility, worker flexi-
bility, and worker choice. Unfortu-
nately, the PRO Act eliminates the 
State’s ability to decide that they 
want to be a right-to-work State; and 
unfortunately, the PRO Act hurts the 
franchise sector by imposing an aggres-
sive new joint employer rule; and un-
fortunately, the PRO Act hurts work-
ers who are involved in the gig econ-
omy by enacting unreasonable restric-
tions on who can be an independent 
contractor, and how they can work. 
Now, let’s make no mistake about it. 
The impact of these changes will, in-
deed, mean less freedom, less flexi-
bility, and over time, it will mean less 
prosperity. As a result, Mr. Chairman, 
I am voting ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentle-
woman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
JAYAPAL), the co-chair of the Progres-
sive Caucus and distinguished member 
of the Committee on Education and 
Labor, and a lady who knows, by every 
measure, that economic progress was 
better under Obama than President 
Trump. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chair, I rise in 
strong support today of the PRO Act. I 
talk to people every day who take tre-
mendous pride in the work that they 
do, and, yet, many of these workers are 
facing terrible injustices on the job; 
poorly paid; inadequately insured; har-
assed; and often in workshops that are 
dangerous and discriminatory. 
Mr. Chairman, no one should have to 
go to work and face injustice and be 
afraid to speak up. That is just not 
right. 
The PRO Act makes it clear that we 
are putting power back into the hands 
of workers; and that we are ensuring 
and expanding workers’ rights to orga-
nize. Let’s be clear that that benefits 
everybody. 
Unionized 
women 
earn 
wages that are 23 percent higher. Black 
workers’ wages are 14 percent higher, 
and Latinx workers’ wages are 21 per-
cent higher than in nonunionized work-
places. 
Young unionized workers more often 
have health insurance, higher pay, and 
a retirement plan. That is why work-
ers’ approval for unions keeps rising. 
Mr. Chairman, every worker deserves 
a fair and safe workplace, and that is 
what the PRO Act does. 
Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD a 
petition signed by over 63,000 commu-
nity members in support of the PRO 
Act.

DEAR CHAIRMAN BOBBY SCOTT: Please ac-
cept over 63,000 signatures from community 
members across the country on behalf of a 
coalition of 11 advocacy, climate, labor, and 
trade organizations advocating for the pas-
sage of the Protecting the Right to Organize 
(PRO) Act. We ask that your office enter this 
letter and the accompanying signatures into 
the public record. We thank you, Chairman 
Scott, for your introduction and support of 
this historic legislation. 
Our coalition believes that working class 
and middle class families in the United 
States deserve income security and should be 
able to organize their co-workers to demand 
living wages and healthy working condi-
tions. 
In a time when the richest Americans’ 
wealth growth has increased by over 200 per-
cent while wages remain stagnant for the 
rest of us, we urge the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives to pass the PRO Act.

Alliance (APALA), Climate Hawks Vote,

Kos, Economic Policy Institute Policy Cen-
ter, Friends of the Earth Action, National

American Way, Public Citizen’s Global Trade 
Watch. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chair, I also in-
clude in the RECORD a letter from the 
CWA on how unions reduce income in-
equality. 
COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS OF AMERICA, 
Washington, DC, February 5, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the of-
ficers and 700,000 members of the Commu-
nications Workers of America (CWA), I am 
writing to urge you to vote for H.R. 2474, the 
Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, 
when it comes before the House this week 
and to oppose any amendments that would 
weaken the bill. For CWA, this is the most 
important vote that has come before the 
House of Representatives in years and our 
members are watching it closely. 
The huge surge in economic inequality 
over the past quarter-century is related di-
rectly to many workers’ lack of a strong 
voice on the job. Over that time, wages have 
stagnated for workers across the economy, 
while income has skyrocketed for CEOs and 
the wealthiest 1%. By 2012, the wealthiest 1% 
made 22.5% of national income, while the 
bottom 90% of families made less than half 
of national income—just 49.6%. 
During that same time period, union den-
sity has declined substantially. Since the 
early 1980s, the overall unionization rate has 
been cut in half. This harms workers who are 
unable to form unions directly, but it also 
hurts other workers, as research by the Eco-
nomic Policy Institute shows that higher 
union density increases wages for all work-
ers. 
Moreover, the harm to workers caused by 
the lack of an organized voice on the job is 
not limited simply to compensation. Work-
ers who form unions have stronger protec-
tions against discrimination and retaliation, 
enhanced job security, better retirement 
benefits, and more effective ways of com-
bating practices that jeopardize their health 
and safety on the job. 
Unfortunately, the National Labor Rela-
tions Act (NLRA) does not currently include 
protections strong enough to ensure that 
workers are able to effectively exercise their 
right to organize, bargain collectively, and 
have a strong voice on the job. The NLRA’s 
penalties are ineffective and insufficient, 
amounting to little more than a vague 
threat of a slap on the wrist to employers 
who violate the NLRA. As a result, workers 
are routinely illegally disciplined or even 
fired for exercising their NLRA rights, with 
little to no consequence for the bad actors. 
Just as concerning is what is actually per-
mitted under the NLRA. Employers can hold 
‘‘captive audience’’ meetings, in which ex-
ecutives can and do force workers to attend 
hours-long meetings in which management 
berates and intimidates workers who want to 
organize. Employers can and do also fail to 
negotiate fair first contracts, preventing 
workers who form unions from ever securing 
a collective bargaining agreement. As a re-
sult, many workers are deterred from fight-
ing to exercise their rights in the first place. 
The PRO Act would strengthen the NLRA 
and, in so doing, empower workers across the 
country. The PRO Act would: 
Strengthen remedies for workers who face 
illegal retaliation, including swift temporary 
reinstatement for workers who are illegally

suspended or fired, real financial penalties, 
and the clarification of their ability to have 
their day in court; 
Clarify coverage of the NLRA to prevent 
the misclassification of workers as inde-
pendent contractors; 
Protect the integrity of union elections 
against coercive captive audience meetings; 
Ensure that the National Labor Relations 
Board’s orders are enforced in a timely man-
ner; 
Protect workers’ right to strike for basic 
workplace improvements; 
Ensure that workers and employers are 
able to reach fair deals for a first contract by 
establishing mediation and arbitration pro-
cedures; 
Strengthen the ability of workers and com-
panies to negotiate contracts that include 
fair share fees that cover the basic costs of 
representation and bargaining; 
Safeguard the rights of all workers to en-
gage in employment-related class action liti-
gation. 
The PRO Act would ensure that workers’ 
right to a voice on the job would be pro-
tected. In doing so, it would help combat 
skyrocketing 
economic 
inequality 
and 
strengthen the middle class. Therefore, I 
strongly urge you to vote for the PRO Act. 
CWA will include votes on this bill and any 
amendments that would undermine the bill 
in our Congressional Scorecard and this is 
the single highest priority vote for CWA and 
our members of the 116th Congress. 
Thank you in advance for your consider-
ation. 
Sincerely, 
DAN MAUER, 
Director of Government Affairs, 
Communications Workers of America (CWA). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Chair, I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill 
today. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE). 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, I thank 
my friend, the distinguished ranking 
member, for yielding. 
Mr. Chairman, there is one reason we 
are here today and one reason alone. It 
is not to protect American workers. 
No, it is to protect big labor and their 
bosses. 
There is so much real work to be 
done. We should be working to em-
power American workers, to modernize 
our employment laws, and to meet the 
demands of the 21st century economy. 
Instead, 
with 
this 
legislation, 
my 
friends on the other side want to turn 
back the clock and try to force power 
back into the hands of union bosses. 
Make no mistake, this bill is a mas-
sive job killer. It will wipe out right- 
to-work laws which have now been 
adopted in a majority of States in this 
country. It will close small businesses. 
It will allow union bosses the freedom 
to coerce American workers, and it will 
force millions to pay union dues 
against their consent. 
For some reason, my friends on the 
other side refuse to see the results of 
the proworker Trump agenda. When 
government gets out of the way, when 
we put down the regulatory pen, when 
we let the American economy work, 
American 
ingenuity 
will 
lead 
the 
world. 
At a time of record prosperity, they 
propose we bring back many of the 
failed policies of the Obama adminis-
tration, the very policies that led to so 
many years of stagnation. 
My message to my friends on the 
other side is clear: Do not betray the 
American worker. Do not turn back 
the clock. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the PRO Act. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the distin-
guished majority leader of the House of 
Representatives. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I have not been on the floor to hear 
all of the debate, but it is interesting 
to hear how proworker the debate is 
from a party that has been responsible 
for 
opposing 
workers’ 
protections, 
workers’ wages, minimum wages, and 
almost every other thing that lifted 
workers up. 
I will remind my friends on the other 
side of the aisle that the best times for 
the middle class were when the unions 
had the largest number of members. 
Why? Because employers could not just 
tell them: You are going to get this. 
No, there had to be a bargaining say-
ing: Look, we are making a lot of prof-
its. We want to share in those profits 
because we enabled those profits. 
So, yes, we are for giving workers the 
right to organize. We are for everybody 
who benefits from that, paying part of 
the taxes for that. There are a lot of 
people who don’t like the policies we 
pursue. But they have to pay taxes be-
cause the majority decides that that is 
what we are going to do. And that is 
the policy of the United States. And 
you can’t say: Well, I don’t like the 
policy, so I am not going to pay. 
I rise in very strong support of this 
bill. This is a bill about the middle 
class. This is a bill about working peo-
ple. You talk a lot about working peo-
ple. This is what lifts up working peo-
ple, giving them some ability to nego-
tiate on somewhat of an equal plane. 
Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup-
port of this legislation which will pro-
tect workers’ rights to organize and 
bargain collectively. That right is at 
the heart of American opportunity. 
Furthermore, I would suggest there is 
not a robust democracy in the world 
that does not have a trade union move-
ment. It is what made prosperity pos-
sible for generations of working people 
and their families. 
This administration and Republicans 
in Congress have been working to un-
dermine that right and erode the pro-
tections won by the workers’ rights 
movement. Today, I am proud to bring 
this legislation to the floor to make it 
clear that Democrats will not allow 
that to happen. 
We stand with the men and women of 
organized labor, and all workers who 
benefit through their efforts, and we 
will fight on their behalf to protect 
workers’ rights. 
I want to thank Chairman BOBBY 
SCOTT
of the Education and Labor 
Committee for introducing this legisla-
tion and shepherding it through the 
committee 
where 
Members 
helped 
strengthen it and ensure broad support 
across our caucus. 
In addition to banning employers 
from forcing workers to participate in 
anti-union 
activities—perhaps 
my 
friends in the House who believe in 
freedom think maybe that is wrong. I 
don’t know. We will see—the PRO Act 
ends 
the 
practice 
of 
management 
misclassifying workers in order to deny 
them benefits and fair pay. I challenge 
anybody to get up and say that doesn’t 
happen. 
It puts the National Labor Relations 
Board back on the side of workers, 
stopping the Trump administration’s 
use of that board to subvert workers’ 
rights. When they say ‘‘deregulation,’’ 
regulation is making sure workplaces 
are safe; making sure that products 
that are sold are safe—that is regula-
tion—making sure that automobiles 
are safe to be on the road. That is regu-
lation. 
By the way, we all know about regu-
lations. We watch a football game. It is 
a regulation that you can’t cross the 
line until the ball is hiked. That is reg-
ulation. It makes the game fair. This 
bill strengthens unions’ hands in nego-
tiations by prohibiting employers from 
hiring 
permanent 
replacements 
for 
striking workers. In other words, do it 
my way, kid, or get out. 
That is the way it used to be before 
the 1930s where some people died walk-
ing lines. They were trying to picket or 
trying to make the case for their em-
ployees. Yes, some people died, and 
some people bled so that other workers 
would have a fair shot, fair pay, safe 
workplace, and some long-term secu-
rity. 
In short, the PRO Act is the workers’ 
rights legislation our Nation has been 
waiting for. If we are for the middle 
class, we need to make sure that the 
middle 
class 
has 
some 
bargaining 
power. It is the legislation our country 
needs to confront the assault of unor-
ganized labor that has been ramped up 
under this antiworker President. 
b 1630 
When we have strong unions, work-
ers—even those not in unions—end up 
with higher wages, better healthcare, 
more secure retirement benefits, and 
safer workplaces. 
They had to fight for that, and as I 
said, some people died for that. That is 
why we need legislation like the PRO 
Act. 
When 
the 
Democratic-led 
House 
passes this bill, it will join other 
proworker legislation waiting for ac-
tion in the Senate. These include the 
Raise the Wage Act to bring the Fed-
eral minimum wage up to $15. There is 
not one of us who could live on $15 an 
hour, but we have kept, over the 12 
years that the Republicans were in the 
majority, $7.25 as the minimum wage. I 
challenge anybody in this House to live 
on $7.25 an hour for 40 hours. 
We ensured equal pay for women in 
the Equality Act, which bans discrimi-
nation against LGBT workers. Martin

Luther King said to judge on the con-

may have nothing to do with whether

We also passed the Butch Lewis Act

funds, as well as the SECURE Act to 
help more workers save for a secure re-
tirement. 
Let’s not forget we passed legislation

White House right after they passed it 
from the House to the Senate. 
Guess what happened 2 weeks later? 
The President said: That is a mean bill. 
Check the RECORD, Mr. Chairman. All 
of these bills are sitting on Senator 
MITCH MCCONNELL’s desk. I call on Sen-
ator MCCONNELL to restore democracy 
and let Senators vote. 
I urge my colleagues to send the PRO 
Act to the Senate with strong support. 
This is proworker, pro-middle class, 
profamily, 
and 
pro-American. 
Vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I have to say that saying that 
this is the most antiworker President 
ever in the country is just pretty far 
off the mark. And we are, on our side of 
the aisle, I believe, the most proworker 
people in the Congress. 
American workers have the right to 
organize, and Republicans support that 
right. This bill is not needed to protect 
those rights. 
Mr. Chair, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY 
DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Chairman, I thank the ranking mem-
ber, who has fought hard on this legis-
lation that I want to talk to you about 
today. 
It is very interesting to stand here 
and listen to my colleagues and me 
talk 
about 
refereeing 
and 
talking 
about 
regulations. 
Sometimes, 
ref-
ereeing doesn’t get it right when it 
comes to sporting events, and it is dis-
appointing today because I stand here 
as somebody who has worked with, sup-
ported, and been supported by many 
members of organized labor, my friends 
in the building trades and my friends 
the airline pilots and the air traffic 
controllers. I would use the rest of my 
time if I talked about all the men and 
women in organized labor whom we 
have worked with to try to come up 
with bipartisan solutions. 
Despite my strong record of sup-
porting Davis-Bacon, PLAs, and ensur-
ing 
workers 
have 
the 
means 
to 
unionize, I have to oppose this bill. 
The Democrat majority has brought 
to the floor another bill that has no 
chance of becoming law. It is a mes-
saging bill, and it has a couple of provi-
sions that I really have to highlight. 
Last year, the Democrat majority 
proposed in H.R. 1 that every single 
member of the Democratic majority 
who voted for that had public financing 
of their own congressional campaigns 
with corporate fines. The corporate 
fine provision in this bill could create a 
circumstance where a business com-
mits an unfair labor practice and the 
civil penalties get directed to Members 
of Congress’ campaigns, not to victims. 
This is irresponsible. 
The joint employer standard that is 
codified in this law is wrong. 
Mr. Chairman, reconsider this legis-
lation. Let’s work together to actually 
come up with solutions. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT), 
who is the co-chair of the House Demo-
cratic 
Policy 
and 
Communications 
Committee. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I 
rise today to urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the PRO Act, the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act. 
The right to organize in this country 
has become a fundamental right. It is 
one of the core pillars of the American 
middle class. 
Nowhere do we understand that bet-
ter than in my home area of north-
eastern Pennsylvania, where we re-
member that, almost 100 years ago, an-
thracite coal miners went out on strike 
to protest unsafe working conditions, 
children in the mines, terrible wages, 
and bad conditions generally. They 
have made fair wages and safe work-
places. They wove them into the fabric 
of American law. 
This is all because they had the right 
to organize, and that is what we are 
here to do. Today, we strengthen and 
preserve the right to organize through 
the Protecting the Right to Organize 
Act. Let’s vote ‘‘yes’’ on it. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I thank 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
for the opportunity. 
Mr. Chairman, if the majority be-
lieved its own rhetoric surrounding 
this legislation, it would have been a 
day one priority. Instead, they brought 
this legislation up in the shadow of im-
peachment to conceal the harm it 
would impose on working-class Ameri-
cans. 
This legislation explicitly eliminates 
the employer as a party in the election 
process determining whether the work-
place is unionized, limiting the ability 
of workers to understand the full im-
plications of any decision at hand. 
Worse, it requires the employer to 
hand over the workers’ private, per-
sonal information to organizers, in-
cluding their home addresses, listed 
phone numbers, personal email ad-
dresses, et cetera, without the consent 
of the employee or the ability for em-
ployees to opt-out. 
This information sharing subjects 
every single employee to the well-docu-
mented tactics of harassment, intimi-
dation, and deception by union orga-
nizers. Just consider the presentment 
in the recent Pennsylvanian case that 
included The Helpful Union Guys. That 
is an acronym. Figure it out. There 
were charges of racketeering, assault, 
and arson. 
Making matters worse, the bill vast-
ly restricts the right to secret ballot 
elections in favor of the organization 
by card-check process, providing the 
union leaders with access to a list of 
all employees who did not support or-
ganization efforts and all of their con-
tact information. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle held up the USMCA deal to 
ensure the right to secret ballot union 
elections for Mexican workers but, just 
weeks later, are voting to strip those 
same rights away from American work-
ers. What is good for Mexican workers 
is not good for American workers, ap-
parently. 
This bill rewrites the definition of 
‘‘employee’’ and ‘‘employer’’ so that 
they completely eliminate the gig 
economy, independent contractors, and 
the franchise model, and it will dis-
proportionately 
impact 
small 
busi-
nesses. 
The estimated combined cost of the 
provisions in this bill is $47 billion an-
nually on employers, necessarily re-
sulting in loss of jobs, reduction of 
wages, and higher consumer costs. 
Yet again, the majority is placing 
special interests of union bosses above 
the American people. 
Mr. Chairman, as a person who went 
to vocational and technical school and 
worked manual labor jobs, I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote for this bill. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LEE). She 
is someone who has read the bill and 
knows that civil fines in the bill are 
paid to the U.S. Treasury, not to the 
unions victimized by unfair labor prac-
tices. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chairman, 
first, let me thank Chairman SCOTT for 
yielding, but also for his tremendous 
leadership on behalf of American work-
ers. 
I rise in strong support today of the 
PRO Act. This bill protects the basic 
right to join a union by giving millions 
of workers protections to organize, ne-
gotiate better pay, and a strong voice 
on the job. 
Unions are vital to the health of our 
economy and our community. They 
help reduce racial and economic in-
equality, boost pay, and increase bene-
fits for workers. 
Unfortunately, antiworker attacks 
have seriously weakened our unions 
and our middle class. Union member-
ship is at an all-time low, and workers 
are scared even to organize or join a 
union. That is so shameful. 
We must protect workers’ rights to 
organize and improve the quality of 
life for themselves and their families. 
That is why this bill is so important. 
The PRO Act strengthens the power of

in support of this PRO Act. These let-
ters are from the Department for Pro-
fessional

DEPARTMENT FOR PROFESSIONAL 
EMPLOYEES, AFL–CIO, 
Washington, DC, February 4, 2020. 
Re H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to Or-
ganize (PRO) Act. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 24 
national unions in the Department for Pro-
fessional Employees, AFL–CIO (DPE), I urge 
you to support H.R. 2474, the Protecting the 
Right to Organize (PRO) Act, and to oppose 
any weakening amendments and any Motion 
to Recommit when the House of Representa-
tives considers this bill. The PRO Act will 
ensure that professionals can exercise their 
right to join together in union and negotiate 
collectively with their employers by restor-
ing the original intent of the National Labor 
Relations Act (NLRA). 
DPE knows from our 2016 national survey 
of nonunion professionals that a majority of 
professionals want to join together in union. 
Unfortunately, in too many instances, em-
ployers are able to violate the NLRA and 
deny professionals their right to form a 
union with their colleagues. 
The PRO Act will help ensure all profes-
sionals can achieve their right to join to-
gether in union and negotiate collectively 
with their employers to improve their lives 
and their workplaces. The legislation mod-
ernizes the NLRA so that it has remedies 
consistent with other workplace laws, ending 
the perverse incentive that exists currently 
for employers to break the law. Companies 
and individual corporate officers will be sub-
ject to financial penalties if they violate the 
NLRA, and professionals will have the abil-
ity to bring their cases to federal court. Fur-
ther, the PRO Act will provide for fair union 
elections. The bill will also stop employers 
from hiding behind a subcontractor or other 
intermediary, or deliberately misclassifying 
professional employees as supervisors or 
independent contractors to evade their em-
ployer responsibilities. 
Recognizing that professionals can only 
fully realize the value of joining together in 
union when they have a written contract, 
the PRO Act will also put a stop to employ-
ers using tactics that prevent employees 
from achieving a union contract. The legisla-
tion establishes a process for mediation and 
arbitration to assist employers and their em-
ployees with reaching agreement on a first 
contract. A written contract—just like CEOs 
have—is how union professionals can guar-
antee pay and benefits, ensure a voice in de-
cisions affecting them at work, and secure 
pathways to sustain their careers. 
The PRO Act also recognizes that profes-
sionals must be able to picket or withhold 
their labor in order to have the power nec-
essary to improve their workplaces. The leg-
islation will prevent employers from hiring 
permanent replacement workers in instances 
when professionals decide they have no 
choice but to go on strike. In addition, non-
union professionals will be able to engage in 
collective action to enforce basic workplace 
rights, instead of being required to pursue 
justice on their own through employer-fa-
vored arbitration proceedings. 
Lastly, the PRO Act would eliminate state 
right to work laws. Secretive special interest 
groups and their billionaire funders push 
these laws in an effort to give corporations 
more power at the expense of everyday pro-
fessionals. We must learn from the experi-
ence of the past seven decades, which has 
shown that people in states with right to 
work laws have lower wages and reduced ac-
cess to quality health care and retirement 
security. 
The experience of the more than four mil-
lion professional, technical, and other highly 
skilled workers who make up DPE’s 24 na-
tional unions demonstrates that working 
people do better when they can negotiate 
collectively for better pay and improved 
working conditions. That is why a majority 
of nonunion professionals want to join to-
gether with their colleagues and negotiate 
with their own employers. And it is why I 
urge you to support the PRO Act when it 
comes before you for a vote on the House 
floor. 
Sincerely, 
JENNIFER DORNING, 
President. 
FEBRUARY 6, 2020. 
Re Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) 
Act (H.R. 2474). 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE: The undersigned 
organizations write in support of the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act 
(H.R. 2474) and in opposition to any amend-
ment that would deny the bill’s protections 
to the approximately 9.2 million working 
people in franchise employment in the 
United States. The PRO Act is an important 
measure that will improve the lives of mil-
lions of working people and their families by 
streamlining the process for forming a 
union, ensuring that new unions are able to 
negotiate a first collective bargaining agree-
ment, and holding employers accountable 
when they violate workers’ rights. These 
rights are especially critical for women, who 
not only disproportionately benefit from 
union representation, but who make up 6 out 
of 10 low-paid workers in the United States 
toiling in jobs that are in desperate need of 
union protections. 
Of the 9.2 million people who work in fran-
chise employment, the largest share by far 
works in the restaurant and fast food indus-
try—approximately 5 million people. The 
consequences of shielding these corporate 
franchisors from taking responsibility for 
employees they jointly control would be felt 
by some of the most vulnerable and lowest- 
paid working people. Over half of employees 
in the U.S. fast food industry are women, and 
around one-quarter are raising children. The 
fast-food industry is notorious for workplace 
abuse: according to one recent survey, for ex-
ample, over 40 percent of women in the fast- 
food industry face sexual harassment on the 
job, which can lead to negative physical and 
mental health impacts, job insecurity, and 
major life disruption. Carving franchise em-
ployment out of the protections of the PRO 
Act would allow franchisors to continue to 
shirk their responsibilities to these working 
people. For collective bargaining to be most 
meaningful and effective, every entity with 
control over workers’ jobs must be at the 
bargaining table. 
For instance, the Time’s Up Legal Defense 
Fund, the ACLU, Fight for $15 and others are 
supporting courageous McDonald’s workers 
who are speaking out about the sexual har-
assment they face working at corporate and 
franchise-run stores. These allegations in-
clude vile verbal abuse, groping, stalking, 
and assault, including of teenagers, as well 
as swift retaliation for workers who speak 
out about harassment. In its public re-
sponses, McDonald’s continues to distance 
itself from responsibility for the sexual har-
assment in its franchise-run stores. When an-
nouncing new policies to respond to sexual 
harassment, McDonald’s has carefully noted 
that the new plans apply only to corporate- 
owned stores; franchise-run stores were en-
couraged, but not required, to have similar 
policies. At the same time, McDonald’s sets 
policies for its franchise-run stores that de-
termine so many details of the work—down 
to the kind of pickles on a hamburger—pre-
cisely so that any difference between cor-
porate and franchise stores is undetectable. 
In fact, McDonald’s corporate identity is so 
intertwined with franchise operations that 
many workers do not even realize they are 
working in a franchise-run store—just as 
customers do not notice any difference, ei-
ther. McDonald’s wants it both ways: to 
closely control the product and reap the ben-
efits of its brand in franchise-run stores but 
not to have any of the liability when work-
ers whose day-to-day work is dictated by 
this corporate control are harassed. 
The McDonald’s workers who have come 
forward to make their industry better for 
millions of other women deserve the chance 
to improve their lives using the tools that 
the PRO Act provides, and so do all working 
people employed at franchise establish-
ments. Unions can help create a safe and 
healthy workplace for all working people. 
Working people with a union may be better 
able to raise harassment concerns because 
collective bargaining agreements can pro-
vide increased protection from firing and re-
taliation than are available to most non- 
union workers—and if harassment or retalia-
tion does occur, individuals may have more 
mechanisms to challenge unjust employer 
actions. 
The PRO Act is critical for women and 
their families because collective bargaining 
increases women’s equality at work. Women 
in unions are more likely than their non- 
union counterparts to receive higher and 
more equal pay, better health care and pen-
sion 
benefits, 
and 
greater 
protections 
against discrimination on the job. 
We urge you to support the PRO Act and 
reject attempts to weaken this bill by chang-
ing the joint employer standard to leave be-
hind millions of franchise workers. 
Sincerely, 
Coalition of Labor Union Women, Equal 
Rights Advocates, National Employment 
Law 
Project,

Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Chairman, 
I ask for a ‘‘yes’’ vote for our workers 
and a ‘‘yes’’ vote for this bill. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, among the PRO Act’s 
most harmful provisions is the ABC 
test to determine employee status. 
Like many of the Democrats’ worst 
ideas, the ABC test was enacted in 
California in a law known as AB5 and 
is already causing pain since going into 
effect on January 1 of this year. 
Last week, hundreds rallied to repeal 
the law. One worker said: ‘‘I worked 
years to gain my skill as an American 
Sign Language interpreter. It was my 
goal since I was 9 years old. After AB5, 
I lost all three of my agencies. The 
dream I worked for is lost. I can’t pro-
vide for my family, and thousands of 
California deaf won’t be serviced.’’

February 6, 2020 
One artistic director at last week’s 
rally summed it up for the Chico En-
terprise-Record: ‘‘We are not stupid. 
We do not need to be saved from our-
selves. We can negotiate our own con-
tracts. AB5 is insulting.’’ 
Mr. Chair, this is the reaction of 
California 
workers 
who 
are 
being 
harmed by a section that will be in this 
piece of legislation. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, can you advise how much time is 
remaining on each side? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Virginia has 111⁄4 minutes remain-
ing. The gentlewoman from North 
Carolina has 21⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Massachusetts (Mr. LYNCH), who 
is a strong supporter of workers and 
who hails from one of the majority of 
States that have an ABC test. 
Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I thank 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT) for yielding me this time. 
Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 2474, the Protecting the 
Right to Organize Act. As a former— 
well, I am still an ironworker. I still 
pay my dues every single month. 
I strapped on a pair of work boots for 
about 20 years as an ironworker and 
eventually worked my way up to be-
come president of Ironworkers Local 7 
in Boston. So I guess that makes me a 
union boss, as I have been referred to 
previously. I am organized labor, I 
guess. 
I have seen firsthand how employers 
have used intimidation and threats to 
punish and deter workers from the 
right to join a union, to seek safe con-
ditions at work and fair wages, and to 
have a voice in the workplace. 
This bill before us takes direct aim 
at the abusive employer practices by 
closing loopholes in existing law, es-
tablishing civil penalties for retalia-
tion, and ensuring new unions get their 
first contract. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to 
vote in favor of this act. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chairman, I 
am going to address on this bill some-
thing that I assume has been addressed 
before but, nevertheless, of all the pro-
visions of the bill I find most offensive. 
Under this bill, the employers are re-
quired to give the telephone number, 
the email, and the address of each em-
ployee. I do believe in the importance 
of protecting people’s privacy, and to 
say that, by wanting to have a union 
election, you have the right to find out 
where every possible person lives I 
think is offensive, not to mention I 
think it would be very scary to have 
somebody come home one night and 
they find somebody there waiting for 
them to talk about the union election. 
You have to wonder what are these 
people doing here. And then you are: 
Oh, they are here to deal with this. 
It is hard for me to believe that a 
party that purports to look out for 
women and that sort of thing is going 
to turn around and pass a bill saying 
we are going to hand out everybody’s 
address. 
b 1645 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Illinois (Mr. LIPINSKI), who knows 
that Social Security numbers are not 
available under this bill, but the same 
information that the Trump NLRB cur-
rently provides is in the bill. 
Mr. 
LIPINSKI. 
Mr. 
Chairman, 
I 
thank Chairman SCOTT. 
I am a proud supporter of the hard-
working men and women of our Nation, 
and no one does more for American 
workers than organized labor. Workers 
standing together and bargaining col-
lectively have been instrumental in 
building our country and our middle 
class for more than a century. Unions 
helped bring tens of millions of good- 
paying jobs to Americans by working 
for fair and safe workplaces and better 
wages and benefits. 
In Chicagoland, we are fortunate to 
have many labor unions fighting every 
day to improve the lives of workers and 
their families. Across my district, 
thousands display a lawn sign created 
by Chicago Federation of Labor that 
reads, ‘‘Proud Union Home.’’ 
But, sadly, some are now trying to 
hinder collective bargaining and under-
mine the National Labor Relations Act 
just at a time when workers need 
greater protection. 
Mr. Chair, today, I urge my col-
leagues to support American workers, 
support American prosperity, and vote 
to pass the PRO Act. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. RUIZ). 
Mr. RUIZ. As labor goes, so goes 
America. 
When workers’ rights are diminished, 
our middle class struggles. 
This economy has made millions and 
billions for millionaires and billion-
aires, but middle-class families feel left 
behind. Their wages fail to keep pace 
with inflation, and workers struggle 
for better conditions. 
That is why I urge the House to vote 
for H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right 
to Organize Act, to strengthen and pro-
tect workers’ right to organize so they 
can negotiate higher wages, fight for 
better benefits, and protect themselves 
from abuse. 
It was labor that first stood up for 
workers’ rights; it was labor that built 
America’s middle class; and it is labor 
that continues to fight to bring fair-
ness to our economy and improve the 
lives of hardworking middle-class fami-
lies. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support workers across the Nation by 
voting ‘‘yes’’ on the PRO Act today. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Chair-
man, I include in the RECORD letters of 
support for the PRO Act from the 
TWU, ATU, and AFSCME. 
TRANSPORT WORKERS UNION OF 
AMERICA, AFL–CIO, 
Washington, DC, February 3, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of more 
than 151,000 members of the Transport Work-
ers Union (TWU), I am writing to urge you to 
support the passage of Protecting the Right 
to Organize (PRO) Act (H.R. 2474), as well as 
to oppose any weakening amendments or 
motion to recommit. As written, his bill di-
rectly addresses the needs of the middle- 
class in the 21st century and will help ensure 
that our next generation economy is one 
that puts working families first. 
Our labor laws are designed to provide ac-
cess to the time-tested process of collective 
bargaining. Under the National Labor Rela-
tions Act, certain workers, through their 
elected representatives, negotiate directly 
with their employer over the terms of their 
labor. How often will they work? How much 
will they be paid? What benefits will they re-
ceive beyond their salary? Through collec-
tive bargaining, these questions are an-
swered in a unique way for each work group 
and at each company. This is an incredibly 
flexible process that has allowed TWU to 
successfully negotiate contracts for every-
one from flight attendants to mechancis to 
railroad inspectors to bus operators to 
bikeshare workers. 
In the nearly 75 years since Congress last 
took action to substantially reform our 
labor laws, our economy has undergone sig-
nificant changes. However, the central role 
that workers play in generating wealth for 
our nation has not changed. While Facebook 
bikeshare workers (TWU members since 2019) 
may be employed at a company and in a job 
that did not exist in 1947, they still deserve 
the right to collectively bargain to improve 
their compensation and benefits. The re-
forms in the PRO Act will ensure that 
gSains in the 21st century economy include 
working families. 
The proportion of unionized workers in the 
U.S. is at a 90-year low because of structural 
hurdles which make joining a new union 
very difficult. Companies misclassify work-
ers as independent contractors, engage shell 
companies to hire employees, and ignore our 
labor laws on a daily basis in order to deny 
their workers the right to organize and col-
lectively bargain. Tactics like these have 
driven down the percent of unionized work-
ers in the U.S. along with salaries and bene-
fits for the middle class. Our era of historic 
income inequality can only be fixed by re-
forming our outdated labor laws and empow-
ering working families. 
The PRO Act would directly address these 
issues and give workers across the entire 
economy equal access to the collective bar-
gaining process. In order ensure workers’ 
rights keep pace with the new economy, the 
Transport Workers Union strongly urges you 
to to vote for final passage of H.R. 2474 and 
oppose any weakening amendments. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN SAMUELSEN, 
International President. 
AMALGAMATED TRANSIT UNION, 
Silver Spring, MD, February 3, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU), the larg-
est union representing transit workers in the 
U.S., I am writing to urge you to vote in 
favor of the Protecting the Right to Organize

ficult circumstances. Bus drivers work long 
shifts, refraining from drinking water be-
cause they don’t get adequate time to use

the restroom. Operators frequently get as-
saulted by angry passengers who don’t want 
to pay increased fares for reduced service. 
Transit maintenance employees do their jobs 
under dangerous conditions, from the ga-
rages they work in, to the tools they use, to 
the air they breathe. 
Often times when low paid transit employ-
ees attempt to improve their standard of liv-
ing by joining a union, they are thwarted by 
ruthless multinational companies which do 
everything they can to squash workers’ 
dreams, and current U.S. Labor Laws author-
ize and enable them to do so. 
Private transit employers regularly vio-
late the National Labor Relations Act 
(NLRA) with no consequences. Workers are 
forced to attend ‘‘captive audience’’ meet-
ings whose sole purpose is to convince them 
to vote against the union. Companies place 
massive pressure on the shoulders of low in-
come individuals with families and tell them 
lies about what it means to be in a union. 
Sometimes, the companies hide behind 
definitions in the law to get their way. Last 
year, in the case of SuperShuttle DFW, Inc. 
v. Amalgamated Transit Union 1338, the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled 
that a shuttle company’s drivers were cor-
rectly classified as independent contractors, 
making it difficult for gig-workers to be 
classified as employees under the NLRA be-
cause protected bargaining is only granted 
to traditional employees. 
Moreover, even when workers actually 
vote to join a union, the companies still 
fight, working ruthlessly to decertify bar-
gaining units and bust unions even before 
they get a chance to negotiate a first con-
tract. It never ends, and it is not a fair fight. 
The PRO Act would modernize the NLRA 
by bringing its remedies in line with other 
workplace laws, imposing appropriate finan-
cial penalties on companies that violate the 
code. It would also establish a process for 
mediation and arbitration to help the parties 
achieve a first contract, making the freedom 
to negotiate a reality for countless workers 
who form unions but never get to enjoy the 
benefits of a collective bargaining agree-
ment. It would generally provide a more 
level playing field so that an increased num-
ber of workers could join unions and have a 
better chance to successfully fight for their 
wages, benefits, and working conditions. 
On behalf of the members and potential fu-
ture members of the ATU living in your con-
gressional district, we urge you to support 
H.R. 2474. Thank you for your consideration 
of our views. 
AFSCME, 
Washington, DC, January 27, 2020. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The American Fed-
eration of State, County and Municipal Em-
ployees (AFSCME) strongly supports passage 
of the ‘‘Protecting the Right to Organize 
(PRO) Act’’ (H.R. 2474). As the largest public- 
sector union, our members believe that all 
workers, both private and public sector 
workers, deserve the right to organize and 
bargain collectively to improve their work-
ing conditions. 
At a time when the economy is strong and 
unemployment is low, there are still people 
who have to work two or three jobs to make 
ends meet. Some workers cannot take time 
off of work due to a cold or to take care of 
a sick family member because they will lose 
pay and won’t be able to cover rent or buy 
food. When workers can form or join a union, 
they can negotiate a contract that provides 
livable wages, paid leave, health insurance 
and retirement benefits. Workers have pro-
tections if they are retaliated against by 
their employer. They can demand safe work-
place environments. When workers have pro-
tections and good working conditions, the 
products and services that they provide are 
better. This is good for the company, con-
sumers and the economy. 
According to a study by David Madland at 
the Center for American Progress (CAP), 
there is a direct correlation between the 
strength of unions and the middle class. 
Union membership rates have fallen over the 
past 50 years, along with the share of income 
that goes to the middle 60 percent of Amer-
ican households. In 1968, this group of house-
holds brought home 53.2 percent of national 
income. That same year, 28.2 percent of 
American workers were union members. As 
union membership rates began to slide down-
ward, so too did the share of income accruing 
to the middle class. In 2017, just less than 11 
percent of American workers were unionized, 
and the middle 60 percent of households now 
earn just 45.5 percent of national income, 
barely up from 45.4 percent in 2016, a record 
low share. 
For decades, abusive employers have been 
able to violate federal labor laws with rel-
ative impunity, making it more difficult for 
workers to organize and negotiate for fair 
pay, benefits and working conditions. The 
PRO Act builds upon collective bargaining 
rights for private sector workers by expand-
ing coverage to more employees. It increases 
penalties for violations of workers’ rights. It 
strengthens support for workers who suffer 
retaliation and it prohibits employers from 
interfering in union elections. 
AFSCME strongly urges Congress to pass 
the PRO Act. This bill will improve the 
rights of workers, which will make our coun-
try stronger. 
Sincerely, 
SCOTT FREY, 
Director of Federal Government Affairs. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Chair, I 
rise today in support of the PRO Act to 
protect workers against an unprece-
dented tide of attacks on hardworking 
Americans. 
Unions are the backbone of our econ-
omy, and, for too long, Congress has 
watched as unions are trampled on in 
the name of shareholder value. Well, no 
more. 
For far too long, the Democratic 
Party has treated unions as if they 
were fully owned subsidiaries, talking 
to them only during times of elections. 
Well, with this Congress, we say that 
those days are no more. 
For too long, the Democratic Party 
stood on the sidelines and watched 
nonunion members go to war with 
union members, all in the working 
class and the middle class, and we had 
forgotten that, when the union move-
ment works well, when the union 
movement grows, the entire middle 
class prospers. Well, that ends today. 
With this bill, we reaffirm workers’ 
rights to organize a union and to nego-
tiate higher wages and better benefits. 
By passing this bill, we uphold the bed-
rock values of this country. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), the vice 
chair of the Committee on Education 
and Labor. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair, I 
thank Chairman SCOTT for his incred-
ible leadership on this bill. 
Mr. Chairman, I am so proud to sup-
port the PRO Act. It is an essential 
step to restoring the power of the 
American middle class, raising wages, 
improving benefits and working condi-
tions, and tackling income inequality. 
I have spent most of my career help-
ing workers form unions and bargain 
collectively, so I know firsthand the 
power that comes with the ability to 
organize. 
Union workers make, on average, 13 
percent more than their nonunion 
counterparts; they are 27 percent more 
likely to be offered health insurance 
through their employers; and they are 
five times as likely as nonunion work-
ers to have a real pension. 
Working families across this country 
who are trying to make ends meet need 
bigger paychecks, better benefits, and 
a safe place to work where they are 
treated with respect. The PRO Act will 
get us there, and I urge my colleagues 
to support it. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I 
have a couple of other speakers, but 
they are not here now, so we are pre-
pared to close. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Chair, for nearly 80 years, Fed-
eral labor law has struck a careful bal-
ance among the rights of employers, 
employees, and unions, resulting in a 
growing economy and greater pros-
perity. But the Democrats are seeking 
to upend that balance and radically tilt 
the playing field in favor of unions and 
against workers and small businesses. 
We now have additional proof about 
the motivations of House Democrats 
for advancing this radical special inter-
est legislation. It comes from Demo-
crats’ most feared, Big Labor union 
boss, Richard Trumka, President of the 
AFL–CIO, who said the following yes-
terday: 
Those who would oppose, delay, or derail 
this legislation, do not ask us, do not ask the 
labor movement for a dollar or a door knock. 
We won’t be coming. 
That truly says it all. The PRO Act 
is all about serving the interests of 
union bosses at the expense of workers 
and business owners. 
Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the PRO Act, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Chairman, the Protecting the 
Right to Organize Act is based on a 
simple idea that hard work should pay 
off. Strong labor unions and collective 
bargaining rights have long ensured 
that workers receive a fair share of the 
profits that they have produced. 
Unfortunately, decades of antiunion 
attacks have slowly eroded workers’ 
collective bargaining rights, weakened 
labor unions, and contributed to a dra-
matic rise in income inequality. 
When workers have the power to 
stand together and form a union, they

have higher wages, better benefits, and 
safer working conditions. The pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act is an 
opportunity for all of us to stand with 
workers and help build an economy 
where everyone can succeed. 
Mr. Chair, I recognize the workers 
and advocates, both here today and 
across the country, who have been crit-
ical in bringing this legislation to the 
floor. In that regard, I include in the 
RECORD a letter from 138 unions and 
civil rights and faith-based organiza-
tions in support of H.R. 2474. 
JANUARY 31, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVES: The undersigned 
organizations support the Protecting the 
Right to Organize (PRO) Act, as introduced 
by Senators Patty Murray (D–Wash.) and 
Jacky Rosen (D–Nevada), Representatives 
Bobby Scott (D–Va.), Frederica Wilson (D– 
Fla.), 
Andy 
Levin 
(D–Mich.), 
Pramila 
Jayapal (D–Wash.), and Brendan Boyle (D– 
Penn.). 
The ability of working people to join to-
gether to collectively bargain for fair pay 
and working conditions is a fundamental 
right. When working people join a union, 
they have a voice on the job and the ability 
to collectively bargain for wages, benefits, 
and working conditions. Unions are crucial 
in fostering a vibrant middle class and reduc-
ing income inequality. When unions are 
strong, they set wage standards for entire in-
dustries and occupations, they make wages 
more equal within occupations, and they 
help close racial and gender wage gaps. 
For decades, however, that right has been 
eroding as employers exploit weaknesses in 
the current law to interfere with workers’ 
rights—and face no real consequences for 
doing so. The result has been stagnant 
wages, unsafe workplaces, and rising in-
equality. 
The PRO Act would go a long way toward 
restoring workers’ right to organize and bar-
gain collectively by streamlining the process 
for forming a union, ensuring that new 
unions are able to negotiate a first collective 
bargaining agreement, and holding employ-
ers accountable when they violate workers’ 
rights. 
This is important because by bringing 
workers’ collective power to the bargaining 
table, unions are able to win better wages 
and benefits for working people. On average, 
a worker covered by a union contract earns 
13.2 percent more in wages than a peer with 
similar education, occupation, and experi-
ence in a nonunionized workplace in the 
same sector. Moreover, when unions are 
strong, they set wage standards for entire in-
dustries and occupations, they make wages 
more equal within occupations, and they 
help close racial and gender wage gaps. Fi-
nally, there is a huge gap between the share 
of workers with union representation (11.9 
percent) and the share of workers that would 
like to have a union and a voice on the job 
(48 percent). The PRO Act would take a 
major step forward in closing that gap. 
The PRO Act protects the right to join a 
union by: 
1. Imposing stronger remedies when em-
ployers interfere with workers’ rights. Under 
current law, there are no penalties on em-
ployers nor any compensation awarded to 
workers when employers illegally fire or re-
taliate against workers who are trying to 
form a union. The PRO Act would institute 
civil penalties for violations of the National 
Labor Relations Act (NLRA) and would also 
require the National Labor Relations Board 
(NLRB) to go to court and get an injunction 
to immediately reinstate workers if the 
NLRB believes the employer has illegally re-
taliated against workers for union activity. 
Finally, the PRO Act would give workers the 
right to go to court on their own to seek re-
lief, bringing labor law in line with other 
workplace laws that allow for a private right 
of action. 
2. Strengthening workers’ right to join a 
union and collectively bargain over working 
conditions. Though current federal law re-
quires employers to bargain in good faith 
with the union chosen by their employees to 
reach a collective bargaining agreement, em-
ployers often drag out the bargaining process 
to avoid reaching an agreement. The PRO 
Act establishes a process for reaching a first 
agreement when workers organize, employ-
ing mediation and then, if necessary, binding 
arbitration, to enable the parties to reach a 
first agreement. The PRO Act would also 
allow employers and unions to agree upon a 
‘‘fair share’’ clause requiring all workers 
who are covered by the collective bargaining 
agreement to contribute a fair share fee to-
wards the cost of bargaining and admin-
istering the agreement, even in so called 
‘‘right-to-work’’ states. Furthermore, the 
PRO Act will help level the playing field for 
workers by repealing the prohibition on sec-
ondary boycotts and prohibiting employers 
from permanently replacing strikers. 
3. Unrigging the rules that are tilted 
against 
workers. 
Too 
often, 
employers 
misclassify workers as independent contrac-
tors because only employees have the right 
to organize under the NLRA. Similarly, em-
ployers will misclassify workers as super-
visors to deprive them of their NLRA rights. 
The PRO Act tightens the definitions of 
independent contractor and supervisor to 
crack down on misclassification and make 
sure that all eligible workers are able to 
unionize if they choose to do so. The PRO 
Act also makes clear that workers can have 
more than one employer, and that both em-
ployers need to engage in collective bar-
gaining over the terms and conditions of em-
ployment that they control or influence. And 
in an effort to create transparency in labor- 
management relations, the PRO Act would 
require employers to post notices that in-
form workers of their NRLA rights and to 
disclose contracts with consultants hired to 
persuade workers on how to exercise their 
rights. 
The time for the PRO Act is long overdue, 
and we cannot delay in working toward its 
passage. We call on Congress to enact this 
important piece of legislation as quickly as 
possible to ensure working people are paid 
fairly, treated with dignity, and have a voice 
on the job.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H894 
February 6, 2020 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I 
once again urge my colleagues to sup-
port the legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chair, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 2474, the Protecting 
the Right to Organize Act. This bill will go a 
long way in restoring the right to organize for 
millions of hardworking Americans while hold-
ing employers accountable for practices that 
undermine collective efforts to improve the 
lives of their employees. 
Over the past few decades, our country has 
seen profits for corporations and executive 
pay rise exponentially. Sadly, this prosperity 
has failed to trickle down to the average work-
er. This is due to practices like union busting 
used by employers and legislation such as 
right-to-work laws enacted by business-friendly 
state legislators. The lopsided employee—em-
ployer relationship that has been created 
thanks to these actions has led to the greatest 
level of income inequality in my lifetime. 
As a dues-paying member of the American 
Federation of Government Employees Union, I 
understand how important unions are to en-
sure higher wages, better benefits, and safer 
work environments for hardworking Ameri-
cans. Every worker across the country should 
have the opportunity to organize and fight for 
a bigger paycheck, not just those that are 
lucky enough to live in specific states or work 
in a certain industry. 
The PRO Act gives workers the opportunity 
to hold fair union elections while also pre-
venting employers from interfering and stack-
ing the deck against workers. This bill also 
gives employees a fighting chance when ne-
gotiating collective bargaining agreements with 
employers. Loopholes that employers com-
monly use to exploit workers would be closed 
off. And finally, the bill also holds employers 
accountable by enacting meaningful penalties 
on employers that violate the rights of work-
ers. 
Mr. Chair, it is time we restore the middle 
class and give workers a fair shot when they 
fight for better pay and benefits. I urge all my 
colleagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Chair, I rise today to strongly 
support the passage of H.R. 2474, the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act, and oppose 
any motion to Recommit or amendment that 
will weaken this very important piece of legis-
lation. 
In a letter to Members of Congress, Robert 
Martinez, Jr., the President of the International 
Association of Machinists and Aerospace 
Workers writes: 
‘‘American workers approve of unions ac-
cording to a Gallop poll conducted last year, 
and if they had the opportunity, they would 
choose to have labor representation. How-
ever, the right to freely form a union with-
out the threat of company intimidation or 
interference is denied to workers today. The 
PRO act expands the enforcement powers of 
the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) 
and strengthens protections for employees 
that engage in collective action. The bill 
would level the playing field by prohibiting 
employers from requiring their employees to 
attend ‘‘captive audience’’ meetings whose 
sole purpose is to convince workers to vote 
against the union. In addition to imposing fi-
nancial penalties on employers and indi-
vidual corporate offices who violate the law, 
the bill would give workers the option of 
bringing their case to federal court. 
The PRO Act is a crucially bold piece of 
legislation that modernizes federal laws and 
establishes a process for mediation and arbi-
tration to help the parties achieve a first 
contract. It protects workers’ rights to orga-
nize a union and bargain for higher wages 
and better benefits. 
Finally, the PRO Act would eliminate 
state right to work laws. These laws are sim-
ply designed to give more power to corpora-
tions at the expense of workers and have had 
the effects of lowering wages and eroding 
pensions and healthcare coverage in states 
where they have been adopted. 
For all the above reasons, I respectfully 
urge you to support the PRO Act and vote 
‘‘Yes’’ when this long overdue legislation is 
considered.’’ 
Labor unions are the backbone of our econ-
omy. They have played a vital role in securing 
worker protections by allowing workers to col-
lectively bargain for better wages and work 
environments. We must ensure the rights of 
workers are protected, which I why I strongly 
urge my colleagues on both sides of a isle to 
votes yes and pass the PRO Act. 
I include in the RECORD a copy of Mr. Mar-
tinez’s letter. 
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
MACHINISTS AND AEROSPACE WORKERS, 
Upper Marlboro, MD, January 30, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
International Association of Machinists and 
Aerospace Workers, I strongly urge you to

the Right to Organize (‘‘PRO’’) Act (H.R.

Thank you, 
ROBERT MARTINEZ, Jr., 
International President 
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Chair, I rise today in op-
position to H.R. 2474, the next in the long line 
of job-killing legislation that we have consid-
ered this Congress. 
Dubbed by the National Retail Federation as 
‘‘the worst bill in Congress’’ and referred to by 
the Chamber of Commerce as a ‘‘major 
threat’’ to American jobs, the bill’s faults are 
almost too numerous to count. Repealing state 
right-to-work laws, codifying harmful and bur-
densome Obama-era regulations, and violating 
employee privacy are truly just the tip of the 
iceberg. 
Democrats are selling this legislation as pro- 
worker, but, in fact, it’s the opposite. This bill 
is anti-worker choice and freedom. They would 
like you to believe that while they need secret 
ballot elections to choose their own Party 
leadership, workers do not deserve that same 
fundamental American right when voting to 
unionize. 
To see the potential effects of this legisla-
tion look no further than California. AB5 is al-
ready wreaking havoc on small business and 
independent contractors across the state. 
Workers are having to reevaluate their careers 
and livelihoods. The PRO Act includes all of 
AB5’s flaws but none of its numerous 
carveouts. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no on H.R. 
2474. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Chair, I rise today to 
join my colleagues from the Education and 
Labor Committee in speaking in support of the 
Protecting the Right to Organize Act—the 
PRO Act. 
The PRO Act is necessary for America’s 
workers because the economy is simply NOT 
working for millions of Americans who are 
struggling to get by while corporate profits are 
soaring. 
We know now, thanks to a study from 
Princeton University, that unions have consist-
ently provided workers with a 10- to 20-per-
cent wage boost over their non-union counter-
parts. And the benefits pervade race and gen-
der lines. 
People of color in unions make five times 
more than people of color who are NOT in 
unions. Women union members see the gen-
der pay gap nearly eliminated. 
Unions across our country are fighting to se-
cure better working conditions and better 
wages for their members. 
In my hometown of Las Vegas, the Culinary 
Union represents 60,000—those are 60,000 
people who already benefit immensely from 
fair wages, job security, and good health ben-
efits. 
But we can expand these benefits to ALL 
Americans. 
We must protect the mission and legacy of 
organizations like the Culinary Union by pass-
ing the PRO Act, and strengthen workers’ 
power to stand together and negotiate for 
higher wages, better benefits, and safer work-
ing conditions. 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, today I will be op-
posing H.R. 2474, the PRO Act. Unfortunately, 
my Democrat colleagues are bringing legisla-
tion to the floor that will continue finding ways 
to pick winners and losers between special in-
terests and businesses in America. Addition-
ally, the legislation puts the heavy hand of 
government in between the contracts between 
workers, unions and their employers. 
There are ways that we can build up work-
ing families in America, protect workers in 
their workplaces, and advance the growing gig 
economy in America, but this bill does none of 
that. Therefore, I cannot support this legisla-
tion. 
But I want to be clear, I support America’s 
workers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H895 
February 6, 2020 
Yesterday, as Chairman of the Western 
Caucus I hosted a job forum focusing on the 
creation of hundreds of union jobs in Northern 
Minnesota. Union jobs that are strongly op-
posed by Democrat members from St. Paul. If 
you want to fight for more union jobs then join 
us in supporting the development of the Twin 
Metals mine and the hundreds of Project 
Labor Agreement Jobs that will be filled as a 
result of what could be the largest project in 
the history of Minnesota. 
I support the development of the Atlantic 
Coast Pipeline which will bring 2,000 to 4,000 
union construction jobs to West Virginia, Vir-
ginia and North Carolina but is strongly op-
posed by Democrat representatives and gov-
ernors up and down the path. 
I support the construction of the Appalachia 
Petrochemical Complex; a $6 billion ethylene 
cracking plant being built in Pennsylvania with 
union workers. A project made possible only 
by the development and advancements of hy-
draulic fracturing technology and the natural 
gas boom made possible by that technology. 
A technology that Sen. BERNIE SANDERS, Sen. 
ELIZABETH WARREN and a parade of other 
Democrat presidential candidates want to ban 
the minute they gain power. 
I support the modernization of the ESA and 
NEPA because we need to get America back 
to building large projects in a timely fashion. 
Right now, in America, billions of dollars of in-
vestment is held up in long permitting times 
from Offshore wind in the Atlantic, to mines in 
Arizona, to pipelines in New York, Nebraska 
and Pennsylvania. 
If we want to support American workers, we 
need to free our people to invest in American 
jobs and infrastructure. For too long my col-
leagues have attempted to promote heavy 
handed government intervention, like this leg-
islation, rather than freeing Americans to build 
pipelines, mines, create jobs and build eco-
nomic opportunity. Rather than siding with rad-
ical environmentalists for who no mine any-
where is acceptable or climate change activ-
ists who insist that not a single mile of new 
pipe be built. I am choosing to side with Amer-
ica’s workers, union and private. 
The Acting CHAIR. All time for gen-
eral debate has expired. 
Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be 
considered for amendment under the 5- 
minute rule. 
The amendment in the nature of a 
substitute recommended by the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor, print-
ed in the bill, modified by the amend-
ment printed in part A of House Report 
116–392, shall be considered as adopted. 
The bill, as amended, shall be consid-
ered as an original bill for purpose of 
further amendment under the 5-minute 
rule, and shall be considered read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as 
follows: 
H.R. 2474 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

consider as relevant direct control and indirect 
control over such terms and conditions, reserved 
authority to control such terms and conditions,

cient given specific facts and circumstances.’’.

do so, the Service shall designate any members 
not selected by the labor organization or the em-
ployer. A majority of the tripartite arbitration 
panel shall render a decision settling the dispute 
and such decision shall be binding upon the 
parties for a period of two years, unless amend-
ed during such period by written consent of the 
parties. Such decision shall be based on—

pects; 
‘‘(ii) the size and type of the employer’s oper-
ations and business; 
‘‘(iii) the employees’ cost of living;

selves, their families, and their dependents on 
the wages and benefits they earn from the em-
ployer; and 
‘‘(v) the wages and benefits other employers in 
the same business provide their employees.’’; 
(5) by amending subsection (e) to read as fol-
lows: 
‘‘(e) Notwithstanding chapter 1 of title 9, 
United States Code (commonly known as the 
‘Federal Arbitration Act’), or any other provi-
sion of law, it shall be an unfair labor practice 
under subsection (a)(1) for any employer— 
‘‘(1) to enter into or attempt to enforce any 
agreement, express or implied, whereby prior to 
a dispute to which the agreement applies, an 
employee undertakes or promises not to pursue, 
bring, join, litigate, or support any kind of 
joint, class, or collective claim arising from or 
relating to the employment of such employee in 
any forum that, but for such agreement, is of 
competent jurisdiction; 
‘‘(2) to coerce an employee into undertaking 
or promising not to pursue, bring, join, litigate, 
or support any kind of joint, class, or collective 
claim arising from or relating to the employment 
of such employee; or 
‘‘(3) to retaliate or threaten to retaliate 
against an employee for refusing to undertake 
or promise not to pursue, bring, join, litigate, or 
support any kind of joint, class, or collective 
claim arising from or relating to the employment 
of such employee: Provided, That any agree-
ment that violates this subsection or results from 
a violation of this subsection shall be to such ex-
tent unenforceable and void: Provided further, 
That this subsection shall not apply to any 
agreement embodied in or expressly permitted by 
a contract between an employer and a labor or-
ganization.’’; 
(6) in subsection (g), by striking ‘‘clause (B) of 
the last sentence of section 8(d) of this Act’’ and 
inserting ‘‘subsection (d)(2)(B)’’; and 
(7) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(h)(1) The Board shall promulgate regula-
tions requiring each employer to post and main-
tain, in conspicuous places where notices to em-
ployees and applicants for employment are cus-
tomarily posted both physically and electroni-
cally, a notice setting forth the rights and pro-
tections afforded employees under this Act. The 
Board shall make available to the public the 
form and text of such notice. The Board shall 
promulgate regulations requiring employers to 
notify each new employee of the information 
contained in the notice described in the pre-
ceding two sentences. 
‘‘(2) Whenever the Board directs an election 
under section 9(c) or approves an election agree-
ment, the employer of employees in the bar-
gaining unit shall, not later than two business 
days after the Board directs such election or ap-
proves such election agreement, provide a voter 
list to a labor organization that has petitioned 
to represent such employees. Such voter list 
shall include the names of all employees in the 
bargaining unit and such employees’ home ad-
dresses, work locations, shifts, job classifica-
tions, and, if available to the employer, personal 
landline and mobile telephone numbers, and 
work and personal email addresses; the voter list 
must be provided in a searchable electronic for-
mat generally approved by the Board unless the 
employer certifies that the employer does not 
possess the capacity to produce the list in the 
required form. Not later than nine months after 
the date of enactment of the Protecting the 
Right to Organize Act of 2019, the Board shall 
promulgate regulations implementing the re-
quirements of this paragraph. 
‘‘(i) The rights of an employee under section 7 
include the right to use electronic communica-
tion devices and systems (including computers, 
laptops, tablets, internet access, email, cellular 
telephones, or other company equipment) of the 
employer of such employee to engage in activi-
ties protected under section 7 if such employer 
has given such employee access to such devices 
and systems in the course of the work of such 
employee, absent a compelling business ration-
ale.’’. 
(e) REPRESENTATIVES AND ELECTIONS.—Section 
9 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 
159) is amended— 
(1) in subsection (c)— 
(A) by amending paragraph (1) to read as fol-
lows: 
‘‘(1) Whenever a petition shall have been 
filed, in accordance with such regulations as 
may be prescribed by the Board, by an employee 
or group of employees or any individual or labor 
organization acting in their behalf alleging that 
a substantial number of employees (i) wish to be 
represented for collective bargaining and that 
their employer declines to recognize their rep-
resentative as the representative defined in sec-
tion 9(a), or (ii) assert that the individual or 
labor organization, which has been certified or 
is being recognized by their employer as the bar-
gaining representative, is no longer a represent-
ative as defined in section 9(a), the Board shall 
investigate such petition and if it has reason-
able cause to believe that a question of represen-
tation affecting commerce exists shall provide 
for an appropriate hearing upon due notice. 
Such hearing may be conducted by an officer or 
employee of the regional office, who shall not 
make any recommendations with respect there-
to. If the Board finds upon the record of such 
hearing that such a question of representation 
exists, it shall direct an election by secret ballot 
and shall certify the results thereof. The Board 
shall find the labor organization’s proposed unit 
to be appropriate if the employees in the pro-
posed unit share a community of interest, and if 
the employees outside the unit do not share an 
overwhelming community of interest with em-
ployees inside. At the request of the labor orga-
nization, the Board shall direct that the election 
be conducted through certified mail, electroni-
cally, at the work location, or at a location 
other than one owned or controlled by the em-
ployer. No employer shall have standing as a 
party or to intervene in any representation pro-
ceeding under this section.’’; 
(B) in paragraph (3), by striking ‘‘an eco-
nomic strike who are not entitled to reinstate-
ment’’ and inserting ‘‘a strike’’; 
(C) by redesignating paragraphs (4) and (5) as 
paragraphs (6) and (7), respectively; 
(D) by inserting after paragraph (3) the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(4) If the Board finds that, in an election 
under paragraph (1), a majority of the valid 
votes cast in a unit appropriate for purposes of 
collective bargaining have been cast in favor of 
representation by the labor organization, the 
Board shall certify the labor organization as the 
representative of the employees in such unit and 
shall issue an order requiring the employer of 
such employees to collectively bargain with the 
labor organization in accordance with section 
8(d). This order shall be deemed an order under 
section 10(c) of this Act, without need for a de-
termination of an unfair labor practice. 
‘‘(5)(A) If the Board finds that, in an election 
under paragraph (1), a majority of the valid 
votes cast in a unit appropriate for purposes of 
collective bargaining have not been cast in favor 
of representation by the labor organization, the 
Board shall dismiss the petition, subject to sub-
paragraphs (B) and (C). 
‘‘(B) In any case in which a majority of the 
valid votes cast in a unit appropriate for pur-
poses of collective bargaining have not been cast 
in favor of representation by the labor organiza-
tion and the Board determines that the election 
should be set aside because the employer has 
committed a violation of this Act or otherwise 
interfered with a fair election, and the employer 
has not demonstrated that the violation or other 
interference is unlikely to have affected the out-
come of the election, the Board shall, without 
ordering a new election, certify the labor orga-
nization as the representative of the employees 
in such unit and issue an order requiring the 
employer to bargain with the labor organization 
in accordance with section 8(d) if, at any time 
during the period beginning one year preceding 
the date of the commencement of the election 
and ending on the date upon which the Board 
makes the determination of a violation or other 
interference, a majority of the employees in the 
bargaining unit have signed authorizations des-
ignating the labor organization as their collec-
tive bargaining representative. 
‘‘(C) In any case where the Board determines 
that an election under this paragraph should be 
set aside, the Board shall direct a new election 
with appropriate additional safeguards nec-
essary to ensure a fair election process, except 
in cases where the Board issues a bargaining 
order under subparagraph (B).’’; and 
(E) by inserting after paragraph (7), as so re-
designated, the following: 
‘‘(8) 
Except 
under 
extraordinary 
cir-
cumstances— 
‘‘(A) a pre-election hearing under this sub-
section shall begin not later than eight days 
after a notice of such hearing is served on the 
labor organization; and 
‘‘(B) a post-election hearing under this sub-
section shall begin not later than 14 days after 
the filing of objections, if any.’’; and 
(2) in subsection (d), by striking ‘‘(e) or’’ and 
inserting ‘‘(d) or’’. 
(f) PREVENTION

PRAC-
TICES.—Section 10(c) of the National Labor Re-
lations Act (29 U.S.C. 160(c)) is amended by 
striking ‘‘suffered by him’’ and inserting ‘‘suf-
fered by such employee: Provided further, That 
if the Board finds that an employer has dis-
criminated against an employee in violation of 
paragraph (3) or (4) of section 8(a) or has com-
mitted a violation of section 8(a) that results in 
the discharge of an employee or other serious 
economic harm to an employee, the Board shall 
award the employee back pay without any re-
duction (including any reduction based on the 
employee’s interim earnings or failure to earn 
interim earnings), front pay (when appropriate), 
consequential damages, and an additional 
amount as liquidated damages equal to two 
times the amount of damages awarded: Provided 
further, no relief under this subsection shall be 
denied on the basis that the employee is, or was 
during the time of relevant employment or dur-
ing the back pay period, an unauthorized alien 
as defined in section 274A(h)(3) of the Immigra-
tion and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a(h)(3)) 
or any other provision of Federal law relating to 
the unlawful employment of aliens’’. 
(g) ENFORCING COMPLIANCE WITH ORDERS OF 
THE BOARD.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Section 10 of the National 
Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 160) is further 
amended— 
(A) by striking subsection (e); 
(B) by redesignating subsection (d) as sub-
section (e); 
(C) by inserting after subsection (c) the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(d)(1) Each order of the Board shall take ef-
fect upon issuance of such order, unless other-
wise directed by the Board, and shall remain in 
effect unless modified by the Board or unless a 
court of competent jurisdiction issues a super-
seding order.

an order of the Board shall forfeit and pay to 
the Board a civil penalty of not more than 
$10,000 for each violation, which shall accrue to

civil action brought by the Board to the district 
court of the United States in which the unfair 
labor practice or other subject of the order oc-
curred, or in which such person or entity resides 
or transacts business. No action by the Board 
under this paragraph may be made until 30 days 
following the issuance of an order. Each sepa-
rate violation of such an order shall be a sepa-
rate offense, except that, in the case of a viola-
tion in which a person fails to obey or neglects 
to obey a final order of the Board, each day 
such failure or neglect continues shall be 
deemed a separate offense. 
‘‘(3) If, after having provided a person or enti-
ty with notice and an opportunity to be heard 
regarding a civil action under subparagraph (2) 
for the enforcement of an order, the court deter-
mines that the order was regularly made and 
duly served, and that the person or entity is in 
disobedience of the same, the court shall enforce 
obedience to such order by an injunction or 
other proper process, mandatory or otherwise,

cers, agents, or representatives of such person or 
entity, from further disobedience to such order;

or neglect to urge such objection shall be ex-
cused because of extraordinary circumstances.

tions of fact if supported by substantial evidence 
on the record considered as a whole shall be 
conclusive. If either party shall apply to the 
court for leave to adduce additional evidence 
and shall show to the satisfaction of the court 
that such additional evidence is material and 
that there were reasonable grounds for the fail-
ure to adduce such evidence in the hearing be-
fore the Board, its member, agent, or agency, 
the court may order such additional evidence to 
be taken before the Board, its member, agent, or 
agency, and to be made a part of the record. 
The Board may modify its findings as to the 
facts, or make new findings, by reason of addi-
tional evidence so taken and filed, and it shall 
file such modified or new findings, which find-

modification or setting aside of its original 
order. Upon the filing of the record with it the 
jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and 
its judgment and decree shall be final, except

‘‘(2) Notwithstanding subsection (m), when-
ever it is charged that an employer has engaged 
in an unfair labor practice within the meaning 
of paragraph (1) or (3) of section 8(a) that sig-
nificantly interferes with, restrains, or coerces 
employees in the exercise of the rights guaran-
teed under section 7, or involves discharge or 
other serious economic harm to an employee, the 
preliminary investigation of such charge shall 
be made forthwith and given priority over all 
other cases except cases of like character in the 
office where it is filed or to which it is referred. 
If, after such investigation, the officer or re-
gional attorney to whom the matter may be re-
ferred has reasonable cause to believe such 
charge is true and that a complaint should 
issue, such officer or attorney shall bring a peti-
tion for appropriate temporary relief or restrain-
ing order as set forth in paragraph (1). The dis-
trict court shall grant the relief requested unless 
the court concludes that there is no reasonable 
likelihood that the Board will succeed on the 
merits of the Board’s claim.’’; and 
(2) by repealing subsections (k) and (l). 
(i) PENALTIES.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Section 12 of the National 
Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 162) is amend-
ed— 
(A) by striking ‘‘SEC. 12. Any person’’ and in-
serting the following: 
‘‘SEC. 12. PENALTIES. 
‘‘(a) VIOLATIONS
FOR
INTERFERENCE
WITH 
BOARD.—Any person’’; and 
(B) by adding at the end the following:

AND VOTER LIST.—If the Board, or any agent or 
agency designated by the Board for such pur-
poses, determines that an employer has violated 
section 8(h) or regulations issued thereunder, 
the Board shall— 
‘‘(1) state the findings of fact supporting such 
determination; 
‘‘(2) issue and cause to be served on such em-
ployer an order requiring that such employer 
comply with section 8(h) or regulations issued 
thereunder; and 
‘‘(3) impose a civil penalty in an amount de-
termined appropriate by the Board, except that 
in no case shall the amount of such penalty ex-
ceed $500 for each such violation. 
‘‘(c) CIVIL PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Any employer who commits 
an unfair labor practice within the meaning of 
section 8(a) shall, in addition to any remedy or-
dered by the Board, be subject to a civil penalty 
in an amount not to exceed $50,000 for each vio-
lation, except that, with respect to an unfair 
labor practice within the meaning of paragraph 
(3) or (4) of section 8(a) or a violation of section 
8(a) that results in the discharge of an employee 
or other serious economic harm to an employee, 
the Board shall double the amount of such pen-
alty, to an amount not to exceed $100,000, in 
any case where the employer has within the pre-
ceding five years committed another such viola-
tion. 
‘‘(2) CONSIDERATIONS.—In determining the

on the charging party, on other persons seeking 
to exercise rights guaranteed by this Act, and on 
the public interest; and 
‘‘(C) the gross income of the employer. 
‘‘(3) DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITY.—If the 
Board determines, based on the particular facts

officer’s personal liability is warranted, a civil 
penalty for a violation described in this sub-
section may also be assessed against any direc-
tor or officer of the employer who directed or 
committed the violation, had established a pol-
icy that led to such a violation, or had actual or 
constructive knowledge of and the authority to 
prevent the violation and failed to prevent the 
violation. 
‘‘(d) RIGHT TO CIVIL ACTION.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—Any person who is injured 
by reason of a violation of paragraph (1) or (3) 
of section 8(a) may, after 60 days following the 
filing of a charge with the Board alleging an 
unfair labor practice, bring a civil action in the 
appropriate district court of the United States

expiration of the 60-day period or the date the 
Board notifies the person that no complaint 
shall issue, whichever occurs earlier, provided 
that the Board has not filed a petition under 
section 10(j) of this Act prior to the expiration of 
the 60-day period. No relief under this sub-
section shall be denied on the basis that the em-
ployee is, or was during the time of relevant em-
ployment or during the back pay period, an un-
authorized alien as defined in section 274A(h)(3) 
of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
U.S.C. 1324a(h)(3)) or any other provision of 
Federal law relating to the unlawful employ-
ment of aliens.

ing any reduction based on the employee’s in-
terim earnings or failure to earn interim earn-
ings;

706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 
2000e–5(g)) or by section 1977A(b) of the Revised 
Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1981a(b)). 
‘‘(3) ATTORNEY’S
FEES.—In any civil action 
under this subsection, the court may allow the 
prevailing party a reasonable attorney’s fee (in-
cluding expert fees) and other reasonable costs 
associated with maintaining the action. 
‘‘(4) PUNITIVE DAMAGES.—In awarding puni-

SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 
There are authorized to be appropriated such

The 
Acting 
CHAIR. 
No 
further 
amendment to the bill, as amended, 
shall be in order except those printed 
in part B of House Report 116–392. Each 
such further amendment may be of-
fered only in the order printed in the

AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MS. STEVENS 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 1 printed in 
part B of House Report 116–392. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
as the designee of Mr. MORELLE, and I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
On page 32, line 8, redesignate section 5 as 
section 6. 
On page 32, after line 7, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. 
The amendments made under this Act 
shall not be construed to affect the defini-
tions of ‘‘employer’’ or ‘‘employee’’ under 
the laws of any State that govern the wages, 
work hours, workers’ compensation, or un-
employment insurance of employees. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 833, the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
today to offer a very simple and 
straightforward 
amendment. 
This 
amendment does not alter the critical 
provisions of this legislation, but it 
does provide clarity about what the 
PRO Act will and will not do, as well as 
recognizes State efforts when it comes 
to employee rights and standards. 
The PRO Act does not govern in any 
way the definition of who is an em-
ployee for the workplace protections 
related to minimum wages, overtime, 
or unemployment insurance. Under the 
PRO Act, the definition of who is an 
employee only applies to who is eligi-
ble to join a union and collectively bar-
gain. 
If a worker is an employee under the 
PRO Act, they will have the right to 
join or refrain from union representa-
tion, engage in collective bargaining 
and bargain over the terms and condi-
tions of their work. 
As we know, employment status var-
ies under Federal and State statutes. 
Thus, an individual can be an employee 
under one law and remain an inde-
pendent contractor for the purposes of 
another. 
I have a deep respect for State au-
thority and believe that, as we address 
Federal NLRA standards, it is impor-
tant to thoughtfully assess the 20 
States that have taken differing ac-
tions currently relying on some version 
of the ABC test to determine their own 
worker protection eligibility. 
This straightforward amendment I 
am offering today does not end the dis-
cussion on the ABC test but helps clar-
ify the benefits of the PRO Act and 
sets our country on a path to support 
workers. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this amendment 
as well as the underlying bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from North Carolina is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, this amendment is lit-
tle more than an attempt to protect 
the few well-connected interests that 
received a carveout from the California 
Democrats’ disastrous Assembly Bill 5, 
but it is a fig leaf meant to provide 
cover for vulnerable Democrat Mem-
bers. 
AB–5 redefined California’s wage and 
hour laws to expand the definition of 
‘‘employee’’ using the same language 
found in the PRO Act, but with dozens 
of industries exempted from the oner-
ous standard that has placed tens of 
thousands of jobs at risk. 
If the PRO Act becomes law, workers 
could find themselves in a confusing 
scenario where they are classified dif-
ferently under State wage and hour law 
and Federal labor law. 
Democrats will draw a distinction be-
tween Federal labor relations law and 
State wage and labor laws, but, in re-
ality, the distinction means little to 
businesses that will be hit with costly 
new and confusing employment regula-
tions and to the workers whose jobs are 
put at risk as a result. 
b 1700 
Moreover, 
once 
all 
workers 
are 
deemed employees for collective bar-
gaining purposes, as required by the 
PRO Act, they will become subject to 
union organizing. Once unionized, the 
collective bargaining agreement would 
govern their wages and benefits, even if 
State law still considers them an inde-
pendent contractor. 
Essentially, if unions have their way, 
this fig leaf amendment will accom-
plish nothing in the way of preserving 
a worker’s independent contractor sta-
tus under State law. 
The only winners in this scheme will 
be the unions and trial lawyers, whom 
Democrats always seem to find a way 
to benefit, no matter the issue. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I 
rise in favor of the amendment and 
also the underlying bill. 
As a proud union member myself of 
Workers United, SEIU, I see the impor-
tance of sticking with my union. Even 
though I am no longer active on the 
job, I want to pay my dues. 
Unions have brought us the middle 
class; they brought us the weekend; 
they brought us the benefits that ordi-
nary people have in order to have a liv-
ing wage and a successful life. 
I also want to say that the amend-
ment clarifies that the ABC test in-
cluded in the PRO Act does not pre-
empt any State law governing the 
wages, worker hours, et cetera, and so 
it is a very good amendment. 
But I want to say, for three decades, 
we have seen corporations trying to 
undermine workers’ rights to gather 
together for their own benefit. Finally, 
today, we are going to pass a bill that 
gives workers those rights. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Chairman, at this 
time, I would like to close out our de-
bate, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
It is very interesting that our col-
leagues have talked about unions pro-
viding the middle class better jobs and 
benefits. It is very interesting to look 
at the declining rate of union member-
ship and see the increasing salaries, 
number of jobs being created in the

country, benefits, and all positive 
things happening, record unemploy-
ment, record wage increases. That is 
going along with declining union par-
ticipation. 
Mr. Chairman, the PRO Act is one of 
the most antiworker, anti-small busi-
ness bills to be considered by Congress 
in decades, and this amendment makes 
it worse. 
The PRO Act is a liberal Democrat 
wish list designed to enrich and em-
power union bosses and trial lawyers at 
the expense of rank-and-file workers 
and small businesses. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to defeat this misleading, unworkable, 
and misguided amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. STE-
VENS). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it. 
RECORDED VOTE 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Chair, I demand a 
recorded vote. 
A recorded vote was ordered. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by 
the gentlewoman from Michigan will 
be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MS. FOXX OF 
NORTH CAROLINA 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 2 printed in 
part B of House Report 116–392. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I have an amendment at the 
desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Beginning on page 14, line 25, strike ‘‘the 
names of all employees’’ and all that follows 
through ‘‘personal email addresses’’ on page 
15, line 4, and insert ‘‘the names of all em-
ployees in the bargaining unit and not more 
than one additional form of personal contact 
information for the employee, (such as a 
telephone number, an email address, or a 
mailing address) chosen by the employee in 
writing’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 833, the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from North Carolina. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, Americans have a reason-
able expectation of privacy. In the 
modern economy, this means deciding 
for themselves whether to share their 
personal information. 
At an Education and Labor Com-
mittee hearing on this bill last year, 
AFL–CIO President Richard Trumka 
testified that unions need workers’ per-
sonal information so that they can so-
licit them anyplace you can get them, 
including at their home. 
As we know from previous testimony, 
these are not always friendly visits. In 
many instances, they are intended to 
exert pressure on workers to support 
the union. 
The PRO Act requires that business 
owners provide employees’ home ad-
dresses, home phone numbers, cell 
phone numbers, personal email address, 
and more to union bosses, which will 
promote union harassment of employ-
ees at home or in public. This is out-
rageous and unacceptable. 
Moreover, there are no safeguards for 
how 
workers’ 
personal 
information 
might be used or misused. For one, the 
information could be used by unions 
for unwanted political campaigning, 
solicitation, or worse. The PRO Act 
contains no protections or restrictions 
on how this information will be used 
and no repercussions if unions allow it 
to fall into the wrong hands. 
We have seen countless examples of 
private 
companies 
and 
government 
agencies subjected to hacks and leaks 
that allow private, personal informa-
tion to fall into the wrong hands. The 
last thing American workers need is 
for self-interested union bosses to have 
that information and for hackers and 
scammers to gain access as well. 
Many Members of Congress know 
firsthand the risks associated with 
having their personal information dis-
tributed. My amendment provides basic 
privacy protections to the workers we 
represent so that, while they are free 
to organize together, they are just as 
free to protect their valuable personal 
information. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in opposition to this amend-
ment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlemen is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairman, the rule 
this amendment seeks to gut dates all 
the way back to 1966, and it has been in 
operation ever since. It is the Excelsior 
Underwear case. 
I have done hundreds and hundreds of 
house visits based on the information 
provided by these lists. Now, just be-
cause it has been in operation doesn’t 
mean it has always worked well. For 
years, when I was organizing, I was 
given lists of names and incomplete in-
formation scribbled across scattered 
sheets of paper, and somehow this com-
plied with the law. 
I am not going to admit how long ago 
this was, Mr. Chairman, but it was dec-
ades ago. 
The PRO Act simply codifies the rule 
regarding contact information to make 
it work better and modernizes it by en-
suring that, among other things, con-
tact information is provided in elec-
tronic, searchable format, this being 
the 21st century. 
Now, 
my 
distinguished 
colleague 
across the aisle might attempt to scare 
you 
with 
nightmares 
about 
union 
boogeymen coming to blow your house 
down; but, in reality, not one person 
has ever charged a union with abusing 
the voter information list since the 
NLRB updated its election procedures 
to modernize them in 2014, 6 years ago. 
Not one charge; it is completely made 
up. 
In fact, when the Trump NLRB, a 
body not exactly known for being on 
the side of workers, recently revamped 
their election procedure, they left this 
rule entirely intact, just as we are at-
tempting to codify it in the PRO Act. 
Ensuring that workers are fully in-
formed about an organizing drive is 
paramount to effective labor relations. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to oppose this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chair, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. Chair, my amendment addresses 
just one radical component of the PRO 
Act by preserving workers’ privacy, en-
suring that they can protect their own 
personal information and decide for 
themselves whether they wish to share 
it with the union. 
Importantly, the amendment does 
not restrict unions from receiving any 
information at all; rather, the workers 
can decide for themselves which one 
piece of contact information they wish 
to share. And the union is free to gath-
er the rest directly from workers with-
out the employer acting as a middle-
man. 
Like with every other provision of 
the PRO Act, Democrats claim that in-
vading workers’ privacy is about lev-
eling the playing field; but, time and 
again, polling has shown that workers 
prefer choice, privacy, and control 
within the unions that claim to rep-
resent them. 
The PRO Act is an affront to all of 
these basic concepts, none of its provi-
sions more so than the requirement 
that employers share employees’ per-
sonal information with union orga-
nizers against the employees’ will. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of this commonsense 
amendment that will put workers, not 
union bosses, in control of their own 
private, personal information, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Mr. Chair, I 
want to emphasize that the gentle-
woman’s amendment is not about the 
PRO Act; it is about current law. 
All the PRO Act does on the question 
of lists and how they are to be given 
from the company to the union is codi-
fying current law. So this is not an ar-
gument against the PRO Act; it is an 
argument against the structure of our 
labor relations as they have been for 
decades. 
Mr. Chair, I would offer to the gentle-
woman that, if she would like to join 
me in writing the law that would allow 
workers to have access to union orga-
nizers in the workplace, I would be glad 
to do that with her, and then we 
wouldn’t need a law that allows work-
ers to gain access to unions the only 
way they can under our system, which 
is at home or on the phone. 
Our country provides workers no 
right to have access to union staff in

among countries. And if the gentle-
woman is serious about feeling like it 
is better for workers to interact with 
the union at work rather than at home, 
that would be a wonderful discussion to 
have for another day. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 3 OFFERED BY MR. NORCROSS 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 3 printed in 
part B of House Report 116–392. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chair, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
On page 19, line 15, insert ‘‘and shall con-
tinue from day to day until completed’’ after 
‘‘organization’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 833, the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chair, I rise to 
offer a simple amendment to protect 
the efficiency of the union representa-
tion election process by ensuring that 
preelection hearings before the NLRB 
are conducted on a day-to-day basis. 
The PRO Act strengthens workers’ 
rights to a free and fair union represen-
tation election. It does so by pre-
venting 
unnecessary 
delays, 
which 
allow employers to engage more time 
against antiunion campaigns that are 
designed to erode support for the 
union. 
In 2014, the NLRB updated its union 
election procedures by enacting rea-
sonable deadlines and preventing em-
ployers from stalling elections through 
frivolous litigation. The PRO Act codi-
fies many of these requirements, in-
cluding the timeliness for pre- and 
post-election hearings. 
One important change in the 2014 
election rule was to require that, when-
ever the NLRB conducts a preelection 
hearing, the hearing must be held from 
day to day. Prior to 2014, hearings 
could either be held day to day or ad-
journed to a later date. Requiring these 
hearings to be held day to day provides 
more certainty in the preelection hear-
ing process that codifies this best prac-
tice. 
b 1715 
In those cases where the NLRB de-
cides a pre-election hearing is nec-
essary; this amendment ensures effi-
ciency in the NLRB pre-election proc-
ess and prevents employers from seiz-
ing upon unnecessary delays. 
Unnecessary delays leading up to a 
representation election enables em-
ployers to have more time to campaign 
against the union, through lawful, or 
many times unlawful means. Once the 
NLRB receives a petition for the union 
election, it must process the election 
expeditiously in order for the rights of 
the workers to be upheld. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge this amend-
ment be voted on in the affirmative, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from North Carolina is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume. 
This amendment is designed to short- 
circuit the union election process dras-
tically by micromanaging the National 
Labor Relations Board. 
The goal of this amendment is to 
rush the election process in order to 
deprive workers of the opportunity to 
weigh the pros and cons of unioniza-
tion, and employers of the adequate 
time to prepare for union election. 
Rushing union elections simply tilts 
the playing field against both workers, 
who deserve the benefit of hearing both 
sides, and businessowners who should 
have the right to make their case to 
their workforce about unionization. 
Unions often begin organizing cam-
paigns weeks, or even months, before 
employers are made aware, creating a 
scenario in which workers are hearing 
only one side of the issue prior to a 
union election. 
When an election petition is filed, 
employers, and particularly small em-
ployers, must seek counsel and at-
tempt to understand complex matters 
of labor law within an unreasonably 
short time period. This amendment 
seeks to impose an unfair and unneces-
sary ambush election scheme through a 
change in the law. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Back on December 18, the Trump 
NLRB issued a dramatic rewrite of the 
union election procedures, thus under-
mining the streamlining efficiency of 
the original 2014 election rule. 
However, even in the NLRB by 
Trump, the new rule left this require-
ment for elections to proceed day by 
day. They believe in efficiency. They 
believe in doing things the correct way. 
This just codifies it. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Chairman, the PRO Act is one of 
the most antiworker and antismall 
business bills to be considered by Con-
gress in decades. It is a liberal Demo-
crat wish list designed to enrich and 
empower union bosses and trial law-
yers at the expense of rank-and-file 
workers and small businesses, and this 
amendment makes it worse. 
The largest federation of unions in 
America spends more than three times 
as much money on politics as it does 
on its stated purpose of organizing and 
representing workers. And unions at-
tempted to organize less than one- 
tenth of 1 percent of eligible workers in 
2018, so it should come as no surprise 
that union membership in the United 
States is plummeting. 
Yet, rather than correct their own 
wrongdoing and increase their ranks by 
serving workers better, unions are de-
manding that Congress enact this 
sweeping, radical bill that tilts the 
playing field aggressively in their 
favor, against workers and small busi-
nesses. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
antiworker, 
pro-union 
boss 
amend-
ment. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Fake news. Don’t believe it. 
Just ask the people what they want 
to do. Close to 80 percent of those in 
the workplace would vote today to join 
a union, if they were allowed to under 
a fair process. That doesn’t happen. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. NOR-
CROSS). 
The amendment was agreed to.

SEC. l. SECRET BALLOT ELECTIONS. 
(a) SECRET BALLOT ELECTION.—Section 9(a) 
of the National Labor Relations Act (29

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 833, the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. ROE) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Tennessee. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Chair, my commonsense amendment to 
the PRO Act is very simple. It would 
require union elections to be conducted 
by a secret ballot, like every election 
in the country is. 
Look, anybody who wants to in this 
country has the right to belong to a 
union. I was raised in a union house-
hold. My dad, after World War II, 
worked for 30 years in a factory as a 
union member. 
In fact, this is so simple that in April 
of 2019, over 80 House Democrats, in-
cluding 12 on the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor, signed a letter to 
Ambassador Lighthizer demanding the 
same protections for workers in Mexico 
as part of the USMCA. I happen to 
agree with that. If I had been asked, I 
would have signed this letter. 
If House Democrats believe a secret 
ballot is essential for Mexican workers, 
why don’t they want the same rights 
for American workers? 
Mr. Chair, 47 years ago I put on a uni-
form. I left my family, I left this coun-
try to serve in the United States Army 
in the 2nd Infantry Division in Korea, 
about 11 miles south of the DMZ, to 
guarantee those rights for every Amer-
ican citizen to vote by a secret ballot. 
My wife tells me she votes for me by 
secret ballot, but I don’t know that for 
a fact because it is a secret ballot. 
Secret ballots are the pillar of our 
democracy. It is a right that—I don’t 
care if you are a billionaire or you 
don’t have two wooden nickels to rub 
together; you have that power when 
you go in the voting booth because no 
one, no one has the right to intimidate 
you in a secret ballot. You are free 
from any threat of retribution. 
Guaranteeing the right of a secret 
ballot for union representation is not 
just the right thing to do, it is also 
wildly popular on the political spec-
trum. According to 2015 polling from 
Opinion Research Corporation, 79 per-
cent of union households, 81 percent of 
Democrats, and 81 percent of Independ-
ents support the right to a secret bal-
lot for union organizing campaigns. 
This amendment eliminates the so- 
called ‘‘card-check’’ automatic certifi-
cation in which a union can organize 
workers by potentially harassing, in-
timidating, or misleading them into 
signing authorization cards. 
Over the years, in our committee, we 
have heard firsthand testimony in the 
Committee on Education and Labor 
from several witnesses about being 
pressured to sign a card check by union 
organizers. Under the card check sys-
tem, the union organizers are free to 
harass a worker over email, the tele-
phone, at their homes, in public, into 
signing the union authorization card. 
That is just not right. 
Congress is elected, everybody in this 
body is elected by a secret ballot. 
House and Senate Democrats want a 
Mexican worker to have that right. I 
completely agree with that. 
So why aren’t American workers 
being granted the exact same freedoms 
that are being demanded and granted 
abroad? 
Furthermore, you are going to hear 
supporters of card check say that a 
card check is needed because the elec-
tion gives employers the ability to de-
feat a union organizing drive. That is 
nonsense. The most recent data we 
have from the Center for Union Facts 
say that unions were able to win al-
most 69 percent of the secret ballot 
elections that were held. 
Our constituents deserve the same 
guarantee of privacy at the ballot box 
as Members of Congress. Union leaders 
are elected that way; and an opposition 
to this amendment makes it clear who 
is putting the interests of union bosses 
above the interest of workers. 
We should all support the right to a 
secret ballot for all Americans. It is 
the most American thing I can think 
of, Mr. Chairman, is that right you 
have to go in that voting booth and 
press the button for whomever you 
wish to vote for. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I 
claim 
time 
in 
opposition 
to 
this 
amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, 
under current law, which has been in 
effect since 1935, an employer may vol-
untarily recognize the union if a ma-
jority of employees have demonstrated 
support through signed cards or a peti-
tion to organize. 
If an employer decides not to recog-
nize the union based on those signa-
tures, then NLRB will direct a secret 
ballot election to determine whether 
the employees will be represented by 
the union. The PRO Act does not alter 
these requirements which have been in 
effect since 1935. 
This amendment would limit the 
workers’ and employers’ option to 
enter into voluntary recognition agree-
ments. There is no reason why we 
should limit workers’ options to an 
election if the workers and employers 
agree to forego it. 
But let’s be clear. The PRO Act does 
not require card check in lieu of elec-
tions. Instead, it strengthens current 
law by requiring an employer to bar-
gain with a union if the union has dem-
onstrated majority support and the 
employer’s interference coerced em-
ployees into voting against the union. 
The only time the NLRB can order 
an employer to bargain, absent a secret 
ballot, is when the employer interferes 
with the union election after a major-
ity have already indicated support 
through signed authorization cards or 
a petition. Again, this is current law, 
set forth by the Supreme Court, and it 
has been in effect since 1969. 
In 
fact, 
the 
PRO 
Act 
actually 
strengthens secret ballot elections by 
ensuring they are free and fair, both to 
the workers and to the employers. 
Contrary to the argument that this 
legislation undermines secret ballots, 
the PRO Act does make a change be-
cause it expands the use of secret bal-
lot elections because current law al-
lows employers to withdraw recogni-
tion of a union without an election to 
decertify the union if the employer has 
evidence that the union has lost the 
majority support. 
The PRO Act just says that union 
elections are required for decertifica-
tion, by secret ballot, that must take 
place before the employer can with-
draw recognition. So this actually ex-
pands secret ballot elections and, oth-
erwise, pretty much maintains current 
law that has been in effect for decades. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the amendment, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
For over 220 years since we have had 
a Constitution in the United States of 
America, one of the most precious 
rights we have is a secret ballot. And I 
wouldn’t know why anybody would 
fear—if you have a great case to make 
for the union, fine. Make it. 
I think we have a right to be union-
ized or not be unionized. As I said, I 
was raised in a union household. 
But I think that is one of the most 
sacred rights that we have, as Amer-
ican citizens, as many people do not 
have. We ask that same right for our 
Mexican worker. I think we should 
treat an American worker the same 
way. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself the balance of my 
time, only to remind the House that 
the only time the NLRB can order an

employer to bargain with a union, ab-
sent a secret ballot, is when the em-
ployer interferes with the union elec-
tion after the majority has already in-
dicated support through signed cards 
or petitions. 
If the employer wants to insist on a 
secret ballot, all they have to do is not 
violate the Labor Relations Act. 
The other side of it is that if they 
want to decertify, they have to have an 
election. So that is a change. But that 
is more secret ballot elections, not 
fewer. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ 
on the amendment, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.

AMENDMENT NO. 5 OFFERED BY MS. WILD 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 5 printed in 
part B of House Report 116–392. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Chairman, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
On page 32, line 8, redesignate section 5 as 
section 6. 
On page 32, after line 7, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. 
The amendments made under this Act 
shall not be construed to affect the privacy 
of employees with respect to voter lists pro-
vided to labor organizations by employers 
pursuant to elections directed by the Board. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 833, the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Chairman, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I rise to offer a very simple amend-
ment that I am hopeful will assuage 
the concerns of my friend and col-
league, Ms. FOXX, regarding privacy 
issues. This amendment very simply 
clarifies a provision in the PRO Act 
that deals with the list of voters that 
employers are to provide to a union be-
fore an election. My amendment pro-
vides 
that 
the 
requirements 
sur-
rounding this list of voters shall not af-
fect employee privacy. 
For more than 60 years, the NLRB 
has required employers to provide a 
list of names and home addresses of 
employees who are part of a potential 
bargaining unit and who will vote in a 
union election. This list has never con-
scripted workers into a union against 
their will, and workers are still free to 
vote in favor of unionization or against 
it. Rather, this procedure is designed 
to create a modicum of fairness during 
a union election because employers al-
ready have this information to reach 
their employees, whereas unions other-
wise would not. It just puts the em-
ployer and the union on equal footing 
in the lead-up to an election. 
In 2014, the NLRB updated what had 
to be included in that list, requiring 
employers also to include job classi-
fications, telephone and cell phone 
numbers, and email contact informa-
tion that was in the employer’s posses-
sion. The PRO Act simply codifies that 
2014 election rule. 
According to information the NLRB 
provided to the Education and Labor 
Committee in 2018, no person has ever 
charged a union with abusing the voter 
information list since the new 2014 
election rule took effect. Even the Re-
publican NLRB in December 2019 kept 
the voting list requirement as it over-
hauled other union representation pro-
cedures. 
My amendment removes any ambi-
guity in the PRO Act by making it 
clear that nothing in the bill will be 
permitted to affect employee privacy. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. VARGAS). The 
gentlewoman from North Carolina is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume. 
This amendment is a weak attempt 
to lend lip service to employee privacy, 
but it fails to reduce the PRO Act’s in-
vasion of workers’ personal lives. Sim-
ply because this amendment says the 
bill shall not be construed to affect em-
ployee privacy does not make it so. 
This amendment will not affect the 
PRO Act’s mandate forcing employers 
to share employees’ home addresses, 
home phone numbers, cell phone num-
bers, personal email addresses, and 
more with union organizers without 
giving workers any say in the matter 
or ensuring that their personal infor-
mation is protected. 
The PRO Act’s provision is an inva-
sion of privacy, and empty rhetoric in 
this fig leaf amendment does nothing 
to fix this harmful mandate. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Chairman, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
The argument of my friend and col-
league is all well and good, but I am 
happy to report that current law al-
ready prohibits unions from engaging 
in harassment and coercion. The PRO 
Act doesn’t change that. The PRO Act 
simply codifies the 2014 election rule 
and the NLRB rules about what had to 
be included in the list. 
Harassment and coercion are prohib-
ited today, will be prohibited tomor-
row, and would still be prohibited if the 
PRO Act bill makes its way to the 
President’s desk for signature. 
The truth is that this list is already 
narrowly designed to be used solely for 
union organizing campaigns before an 
election, and no union has ever been 
charged with using this list for any im-
proper purpose or in violation of em-
ployee privacy. 
If my friend’s fears of coercion or in-
timidation were legitimate, we would 
see labor charges against unions, but 
that hasn’t happened because the fear 
is unfounded. 
My amendment merely memorializes 
and protects employees by clarifying 
that nothing in the PRO Act will affect 
employee privacy. 
I am proud to support workers’ pri-
vacy and their right to organize. 
I am proud of the PRO Act, a bill 
that recognizes that union participa-
tion is the fabric of our middle class; a 
bill that recognizes that strong union 
membership increases productivity, re-
duces turnover, and gives the middle 
class more purchasing power; a bill 
that recognizes that while union mem-
bership is at an all-time low, it is not 
the result of union apathy, and that 62 
percent of workers want to unionize 
but cannot because workers are not on 
equal footing with management; a bill 
that ends unfair union election prac-
tices like employer-mandated captive 
audience speeches because the freedom 
to associate or not associate should 
also include the freedom not to listen. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amend-
ment and the underlying bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Chairman, the PRO Act is one of 
the most antiworker and anti-small 
business bills to be considered by Con-
gress in decades. It is a liberal Demo-
crat wish list designed to enrich and 
empower union bosses and trial law-
yers at the expense of rank-and-file 
workers in small businesses, and this 
amendment does nothing to change 
that. 
My colleagues keep saying that the 
Trump administration is supporting 
many bad rules put in place in 2014; 
however, that is misleading. The ad-
ministration has not completed its 
work on modifying or changing some of 
those rules. 
Unions attempted to organize less 
than one-tenth of 1 percent of eligible 
workers in 2018, so it should come as no 
surprise that union membership in the 
United States is plummeting. Yet, 
rather than correct their own wrong-
doing and increase their ranks by serv-
ing workers better or going out and ac-
tually doing the job that unions are 
supposed to do, unions are demanding 
that Congress enact this sweeping, rad-
ical bill that tilts the playing field ag-
gressively in their favor against work-
ers and small businesses.

ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
As a small business owner, I came to 
Congress to put America back on a 
path to prosperity and create jobs. I 
am proud to say that as a result of 
progrowth policies passed by the 115th 
Congress and enacted by President 
Trump, American workers are thriving 
under our strong economy. Unemploy-
ment is down and wages and jobs are 
up. I am particularly excited by the 
growth in my home State of Georgia. 
For the seventh year in a row, Geor-
gia has been named the best place to do 
business. A large part of that is be-
cause Georgia became a proud right-to- 
work State back in 1947. Ever since, 
families are flourishing; people are 
working; and business is booming. 
But some of my colleagues in other 
States think they know what is best 
for Georgia. The PRO Act will outright 
ban right-to-work laws that have been 
so successful in States like Georgia. I 
can tell you right now that the folks of 
Georgia know what is best for them, 
not the Federal Government. 
My amendment is simple. It strikes 
the ban on right-to-work States. The 
right to work is what fuels the Amer-
ican Dream, opening a door to upward 
mobility and the opportunity for work-
ers to achieve their goals. No American 
should be forced to pay for representa-
tion and political activities that they 
do not agree with, and that is what will 
happen if we take away States’ author-
ity to enact right-to-work laws. 
My amendment will protect States’ 
right-to-work laws so that union dues 
are voluntary, giving power to work-
ers, not union bosses, who pocket these 
benefits 
from 
mandatory 
dues. 
It 
should not even be up for debate. Work-
ers should be in control of their earn-
ings and how they spend it. 
As Members of Congress our duty is 
to put our constituents first, so I en-
courage my colleagues to support my 
amendment, which prioritizes hard-
working Americans’ right to choose 
over the special interests of a union. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Virginia is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. SHERMAN). 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
to oppose the amendment and to com-
mend the Chair for including in the 
PRO Act provisions that will end the 
free-rider problem caused by so-called 
right-to-work States. 
Right-to-work provisions undermine 
the right to unionize because our basic 
labor law requires a union to represent 
all those in the bargaining unit, and 
everyone in the bargaining unit bene-
fits from the union contract. If you tell 
people you don’t have to join, you 
don’t have to pay the union dues, you 
don’t have to pay a fee and you still 
get all the benefits, then right-to-work 
is really code for right to free ride. 
The result is that States with so- 
called right-to-work laws have half the 
private sector unionization rates as 
other States. It doesn’t just hurt those 
who are in a union because it hurts 
every wage earner in the whole State. 
Average wages decline. That is why av-
erage wages in so-called right-to-work 
States are $8,700 less than they are in 
other States, but it doesn’t just affect 
that whole State. It drives other States 
to perhaps adopt so-called right-to- 
work laws in a race to the bottom as 
they fight for businesses. It even hurts 
us in California, where we have to com-
pete 
with 
low-wage 
employers 
in 
antiunion States. 
I have been working on this problem 
for decades. That is why I introduced 
the Nationwide Right to Unionize Act 
in the 110th Congress, the 111th Con-
gress, the 112th Congress, the 113th 
Congress, the 114th Congress, the 115th 
Congress, and now the 116th Congress 
each time with dozens of cosponsors. 
Last Congress I was joined by ELIZA-
BETH WARREN in the Senate where we 
introduced our bills together. Last 
week Senator WARREN and I each intro-
duced our bills in the House with 30 
original cosponsors and the Senate 
with 16. 
The PRO Act is to be commended be-
cause it solves this free-rider problem. 
We had the State Department testify 
before my subcommittee of Foreign Af-
fairs that so-called right-to-work laws 
are a violation of the U.N. Declaration 
of Human Rights because the right to 
organize is a human right, and right- 
to-work laws make a mockery of that 
right. 
I also rise in opposition to the 
amendment we are going to be dealing 
with, No. 10 by Mr. MEADOWS, which is 
substantively identical to what we are 
considering now. The Rules Committee 
in an effort to be incredibly bipartisan 
has allowed two substantively identical 
amendments to be presented to this 
House. They are both substantively 
identical. They are both equally rep-
rehensible. 
Defeat this amendment. Pass the bill. 
End the race to the bottom and raise 
wages nationwide. A country which 
even last year saw wages rise just 1 
percent more than inflation needs 
unions. We need the right to organize. 
Pass the bill. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chairman, the fact 
of the matter is that right-to-work 
States are stronger, growing faster, 
and more prosperous. The Federal Gov-
ernment has no business outright ban-
ning right-to-work laws that are so 
successful in many States across the 
Nation. 
Why would California tell Georgia 
how to run their State? 
Democrats in this body have a rad-
ical agenda to erode the rights of 
States. It is just wrong. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
protect States’ rights and vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on my amendment, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
b 1745 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, 
how much time is remaining? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Virginia has 2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chair, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
First, I want to point out that, by 
every measure, unemployment, jobs 
per month, a Dow Jones industrial av-
erage, even the deficit were all better 
under President Obama than President 
Trump. 
We also know that union members 
get better wages, better benefits, and 
safer workplaces than nonmembers. 
But unions have the duty to represent 
all workers in a bargaining unit, even 
those who are not members of the 
union. 
In so-called right-to-work States, 
that means the union must equally 
represent those nonmembers who are 
free to avoid paying their fair share of 
the costs of representation. This obli-
gation to represent everyone is known 
as the duty of fair representation. 
Since all workers receive a benefit 
from union representation, it is only 
fair that everyone contribute their fair 
share. For example, if a worker files a 
grievance, the union must represent

that person with individualized rep-
resentation, and that could cost thou-
sands of dollars a day. 
Likewise, when a union incurs ex-
penses while bargaining for raises or 
benefits, everyone in the bargaining 
unit benefits, so it only makes sense 
that everyone help pay for that rep-
resentation. 
The PRO Act permits unions and em-
ployers to negotiate labor agreements, 
which include a service fee to cover the 
fair share of the cost of providing serv-
ices mandated by law. That does not 
mean political activities or advocacy 
or holiday parties or Fourth of July 
celebrations, just those that are re-
quired by law. It just ensures that 
those who enjoy the benefits of union 
representation pay their fair share. 
Mr. Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-

Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chair, I demand a

AMENDMENT NO. 7 OFFERED BY MRS. HAYES 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 7 printed in 
part B of House Report 116–392. 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Chair, I have an

Page 19, line 20, striking the period at the

House Resolution 833, the gentlewoman 
from Connecticut (Mrs. HAYES) and a

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Connecticut. 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Chair, I rise to 
offer an amendment to preserve the 
ability for new, voluntarily recognized 
unions to collectively bargain for a 
reasonable period of time without the 
threat of an invited decertification 
campaign. 
I include in the RECORD a letter from 
the National Education Association in 
support of the PRO Act. 
NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION, 
Washington, DC, February 6, 2020. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 3 
million members of the National Education 
Association who work in schools and on col-
lege campuses in 14,000 communities, we urge 
you to vote YES on the Protect the Right to 
Organize Act (H.R. 2474). Votes associated 
with this issue may be included in NEA’s Re-
port Card for the 116th Congress. 
Collective bargaining is crucial in pro-
viding working people with a voice in the 
workplace and a means for improving their 
families’ financial circumstances. The free-
dom to collectively bargain, in both the pub-
lic and the private sectors, helps reduce in-
come inequality and assists low- and middle- 
income workers in sharing in economic 
growth. However, according to Bureau of 
Labor statistics, only 6.2 percent of workers 
in the private sector were union members in 
2019. Employers’ hostility to union orga-
nizing is largely to blame for the declining 
number of private-sector union members. 
This negatively affects working families and 
our nation’s economic viability. The PRO 
Act will take several steps to reduce the bar-
riers to private-sector union organizing, in-
cluding: 
Revising the definition of ‘‘employee’’ and 
‘‘supervisor’’ to prevent employers from 
classifying employees as exempt from labor 
law protections; 
Expanding unfair labor practices to in-
clude prohibitions against replacement of or 
discrimination against workers who partici-
pate in strikes; 
Making it an unfair labor practice to re-
quire or coerce employees to attend em-
ployer 
meetings 
designed 
to 
discourage 
union membership an unfair labor practice; 
and 
Allowing injunctions against employers 
engaging in unfair labor practices involving 
discharge or serious economic harm to an 
employee. 
All working families deserve financial sta-
bility and the ability to negotiate to im-
prove their circumstances. The right to orga-
nize is essential to these, and to our nation’s 
overall economic health. We urge you to vote 
YES on the PRO Act to help remove barriers 
to organizing in the private sector. 
Sincerely, 
MARC EGAN, 
Director of Government Relations, 
National Education Association. 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Chair, as a union 
member, I have had the benefits of the 
organizing and collective bargaining 
power of WTA, CEA, NEA, and SEIU 
1199. But not all people work in fields 
with a history of unionization. New 
unions need a chance to bargain with 
employers and prove they are produc-
tive and skilled advocates on behalf of 
their members. 
For over 40 years, the National Labor 
Relations Board protected the vol-
untary recognition process by affording 
a reasonable amount of time for em-
ployers and unions to collectively bar-
gain without fear of decertification 
challenges. That rule balanced the need 
for stability in labor relations with the 
right to have an election, while giving 
the unions a chance to demonstrate ef-
fectiveness to its members. 
In 2007, the Bush administration’s 
NLRB scrapped that policy by requir-
ing employers to post a notice inviting 
a decertification election within a 45- 
day 
window, 
fostering 
uncertainty 
among employees, undermining sta-
bility in collective bargaining, and en-
couraging employers to stall at the 
bargaining table. Although the NLRB 
rejected this policy in 2011, this admin-
istration has proposed to revive it. 
Unions need our support now more 
than ever. In 2018, Connecticut saw a 
3.5 percent decline in union member-
ship from the previous year. Due to 
this administration’s attacks following 
the Janus Supreme Court decision, na-
tional union membership is at 10.3 per-
cent, down from 20.1 percent from the 
first year data was collected in 1983. 
We should not be proposing new rules 
meant to antagonize and intimidate 
newly formed unions or new workers 
advocating 
for 
their 
constitutional 
right to organize. We should be giving 
new unions the tools they need to suc-
ceed. 
A 
nonunionized 
workforce 
means 
lower wages, poorer working condi-
tions, and reduced benefits. It means 
working at risk of exploitation. It 
means a workforce left with no tools to 
advocate for themselves in the work-
place. 
The PRO Act will strengthen unions 
formed over a century ago and those 
formed today. It will bolster the power 
of workers and the middle class by giv-
ing labor law teeth to prevent intimi-
dation and retaliation. It will strength-
en Connecticut workers’ rights to col-
lectively bargain on behalf of their 
members. And it will put a stop to the 
blatant attacks from employers and 
State legislatures. 
Mr. Chair, I stand with my union 
brothers and sisters at all stages of the 
unionization process. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support my amendment ensuring new 
unions are given the chance to organize 
without a rushed threat of decertifica-
tion. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself such time as 
I may consume. 
The biggest problem with our Federal 
labor laws today is inadequate protec-
tion of workers’ rights within the labor 
organizations 
that 
represent 
them. 
This amendment would make that 
problem worse. Workers should not be 
forced into a union with which they do 
not wish to associate. 
The existing process for workers to 
remove a union is too limited and bur-
densome as it is. Workers face tremen-
dous one-sided barriers to a decertifica-
tion election that they do not face in a 
certification election. 
Worse, more than 90 percent of work-
ers represented by a union today have 
never voted for that union to represent 
them. 
Let me repeat that. More than 90 per-
cent of workers represented by a union

today have never voted for that union 
to represent them. 
Democrats oppose legislation that 
would allow workers to vote periodi-
cally on the union in their workplace, 
and this amendment would make it 
even more difficult for workers to have 
an opportunity to vote, even after 
clearing all of the existing unnecessary 
hurdles. 
This amendment would make the 
PRO Act even more antiworker than it 
already is. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. HAYES. Mr. Chair, first, the 
PRO Act does not require employees to 
recognize unions without first having 
an election. Rather, the right of an em-
ployer to voluntarily recognize a union 
has been the law of this land since 1935, 
when the National Labor Relations Act 
was enacted. 
Voluntary recognition happens with 
demonstrated majority support from 
members by petition or union author-
ization cards. 
Again, voluntary recognition hap-
pens with demonstrated majority sup-
port from members by petition or 
union authorization cards. 
The PRO Act simply strengthens em-
ployees’ right to a free and fair elec-
tion by establishing more effective 
remedies when an employer unlawfully 
interferes with an election. 
Second, my amendment does not un-
dermine the right to have an election. 
It codifies a period of time during 
which a union and an employer can 
focus on bargaining an agreement and 
allows workers to exercise their con-
stitutional right to collectively bar-
gain. It prevents wasteful delay tactics 
so both parties can get to the negoti-
ating table. 
If we are going to protect the prac-
tice of collective bargaining, we need 
to ensure there is a reasonable time pe-
riod for the union to represent employ-
ees and bargain on their behalf without 
fighting over other challenges. 
This time period only begins after 
the employees have demonstrated a 
majority want to have a union. It does 
not stop employees from seeking an 
election after a reasonable time of 1 
year, provided it does not interfere 
with other existing NLRB policies. 
The reality is union membership is 
declining because of the continued at-
tacks on working-class Americans. Our 
workers are losing a seat at the table 
in their own workplaces. They need us 
to defend their rights and ensure they 
have a fair shot at negotiation. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
stand up for unions and support this 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Chairman, union membership is 
plummeting because American workers 
have realized that they don’t need the 
unions. We are seeing such a pros-
perous economy. And as I said, union 
membership declining is correlated 
with the fact that our economy is 
booming for the middle class. 
The PRO Act, Mr. Chairman, is one 
of the most antiworker and anti-small 
business bills to be considered by Con-
gress in decades. It is a liberal Demo-
crat wish list designed to enrich and 
empower union bosses and trial law-
yers at the expense of rank-and-file 
workers and small businesses. 
The largest federation of unions in 
America spends more than three times 
as much money on politics as it does 
on its stated purpose of organizing and 
representing workers. 
With this bill, the unions are trying 
to take a shortcut. They have decided 
it is better to just focus on getting 
Democrats to do their work for them. 
Unions attempted to organize less 
than one-tenth of 1 percent of eligible 
workers in 2018, so it should come as no 
surprise that union membership in the 
United States is plummeting, along 
with the great economy that we have. 
Yet, rather than correct their own 
wrongdoing and increase their ranks by 
serving workers better, unions are de-
manding their allies in Congress enact 
this sweeping, radical bill that includes 
over 50 harmful provisions, including 
those which eliminate workers’ pri-
vacy, forces workers to pay a labor 
union against their will, subjects work-
ers and small businesses to direct 
union harassment, and will kill thou-
sands of small businesses and good-pay-
ing jobs. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this antiworker, pro-union boss 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support 
of my amendment to H.R. 2474. This 
amendment would maintain current 
law, which protects the ability of em-
ployers to continue to do business and 
provide for their customers during a 
labor relations dispute. 
One of the purposes of the National 
Labor Relations Act was to ‘‘eliminate 
. . . substantial obstructions to the 
free flow of commerce.’’ After the eco-
nomic chaos of the 1930s, Congress 
passed the NLRA. 
The NLRA struck a careful balance 
by protecting workers’ ability to strike 
while outlawing intermittent strikes 
that create upheaval and uncertainty 
in the absence of a genuine commit-
ment by the employees to abandon 
their work. 
b 1800 
Similarly, the Supreme Court has 
upheld the right of employers to re-
place striking workers permanently in 
order to keep their business running. 
H.R. 2474 discards more than 80 years 
of precedent by weaponizing the pain of 
economic conflict in order to empower 
union bosses. The bill aims to make it 
impossible for employers to continue 
to do business in the event of a labor 
dispute, a death sentence for thousands 
of small businesses. 
In 1937, there were nearly 5,000 
strikes in the United States, a night-
mare for employers, customers, and the 
economy as a whole. H.R. 2474 seeks to 
resurrect this chaotic time in Amer-
ica’s history. Imagine what a system 
that allows for intermittent strikes 
and bans on the replacement of strik-
ing workers would do to our economy, 
our global competitiveness, and the in-
centive to invest in American workers. 
Allowing intermittent strikes and 
banning permanent replacements is 
great for union bosses, but a raw deal 
for workers, consumers, and small 
businesses. 
Having worked in the manufacturing 
sector for over 25 years, I know it is 
critically important for the overall 
health of a business to be reliable and 
keep the doors open so employees can 
keep their jobs. 
You 
cannot 
be 
pro-jobs 
and 
antibusiness. If a business cannot do 
its work, then its purpose no longer ex-
ists. Competition will inherently force 
businesses to close. 
Allowing intermittent strikes and 
banning permanent replacements could 
force businesses to close their doors 
permanently. I urge my colleagues to 
adopt this amendment to protect small 
businesses and to prevent unnecessary 
disruptions of our economy. 
Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Chairwoman, I rise in opposition to

February 6, 2020 
INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD 
OF TEAMSTERS, 
February 4, 2020. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 1.4 
million members of the International Broth-
erhood of Teamsters, I am writing to state 
our strong support for H.R. 2474, the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act). 
I urge you to support this critical legislation 
and to oppose any weakening amendments 
and any motion to recommit when H.R. 2474 
comes to the House floor this week. 
Today, the economy is not working for 
working people. Wages have stagnated for 
workers across the economy, while income 
has skyrocketed for CEO’s and the wealthi-
est one percent. This inequality is the result 
of a loss of bargaining power and the erosion 
of workers’ ability to exercise their rights on 
the job. 
Today, when workers make the decision to 
stand together and bargain with their em-
ployer for improved working conditions, the 
deck is stacked against them from day one. 
Under current law, unscrupulous employers, 
armed with limitless funds, routinely violate 
the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) 
and block workers’ ability to exercise their 
right to bargain for better wages and better 
working conditions. The Protecting the 
Right to Organize Act is an important step 
forward for workers’ rights. It would restore 
and strengthen worker protections which 
have been eroded over the years. 
The Protecting the Right to Organize Act 
addresses several major weaknesses in cur-
rent law. H.R. 2474 enacts meaningful, en-
forceable penalties on employers who break 
the law and gives workers a private right of 
action if they’ve been terminated for union 
activity. The bill would make elections fair-
er by prohibiting employers from using coer-
cive activities like captive audience meet-
ings. H.R. 2474 establishes a process for medi-
ation and arbitration to stop stalling tactics 
at the bargaining table and help parties 
achieve a first contract. Importantly, the 
bill 
also 
addresses 
rampant 
intentional 
misclassification 
and 
ensures 
that 
misclassified workers are not deprived of 
their right to form a union under the NLRA. 
These are among the many important provi-
sions in the bill to help restore the middle 
class. 
Research shows that workers want unions. 
However, there is a huge gap between the 
share of workers with union representation 
and the share of workers that would like to 
have a union and a voice on the job. The PRO 
Act would take a major step forward in clos-
ing that gap and ultimately growing a strong 
middle class. 
I urge you to demonstrate to the American 
people that workers and their rights are a 
priority for this Congress. I hope I can tell 
our members that you stood with them and 
other workers in their efforts to achieve 
meaningful workers’ rights and protections 
and better wages and working conditions. 
The Teamsters Union urges you to support 
H.R. 2474 and oppose all efforts to weaken 
this bill by amendment. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES P. HOFFA, 
General President. 
INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF 
PROFESSIONAL & TECHNICAL ENGINEERS, 
Washington, DC, January 31, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of 90,000 
workers represented by the International 
Federation of Professional and Technical En-
gineers (IFPTE), we urge you to vote for the 
H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to Orga-
nize Act of 2019 (PRO Act), scheduled for a 
floor vote next week. As currently written, 
the PRO Act would restore and protect work-
ers’ rights to organize and collectively bar-
gain in their workplaces and we urge you to 
oppose any Motion to Recommit and any 
amendments that would weaken the lan-
guage, intent, or purpose of the bill. 
If enacted, the PRO Act would counter the 
all too common anti-union intimidation tac-
tics that workers who are organizing a union 
are subjected to. For example, upwards of 800 
highly trained professionals employed by 
Southern California Edison are currently en-
gaged in an organizing effort with IFPTE 
Local 20 to address issues such as mandatory 
overtime and ever-shortening training for 
new hires. These designers, estimators, field 
planning technicians, and planners play an 
important role in ensuring safety and wild-
fire mitigation to the more than 15 million 
people in Southern California. Unfortu-
nately, Southern California Edison has de-
cided to engage in some of the very anti- 
worker behavior that this bill seeks to cor-
rect. This include such activities as manda-
tory all-staff captive audience meetings, one 
on one meetings, and handing out anti-union 
literature filled with misinformation, all 
aimed at discouraging union activity. 
The PRO Act would counter the all too 
common 
anti-union 
intimidation 
tactics 
that workers in union organizing campaigns 
and first contract negotiations are subjected 
to. This bill meaningfully restores workers’ 
rights to determine for themselves if they 
want a union by providing a fair process for 
union recognition if the National Labor Re-
lations Board (NLRB) determines that the 
employer illegally interfered with the union 
representation election. Provisions in the 
bill also allow the union or the employer to 
request a mediation-arbitration process for 
first contract negotiations that take longer 
than 90 days. Language in this bill that pro-
hibits captive audience meetings and rein-
states the employer requirement to disclose 
any hiring of anti-union consultants will 
help workers make informed choices when 
they receive information from their employ-
ers. By clarifying and updating the National 
Labor Relations Act’s definitions for em-
ployee, supervisor, and employer, the PRO 
Act closes loopholes that allow employers to 
misclassify workers and prevents employers 
from dodging joint employer liability. Fur-
thermore, this bill gives the NLRB the au-
thority to conduct economic analysis as it 
sets policies and regulations, increases pen-
alties against employers who violate the Na-
tional Labor Relations Act, requires employ-
ers to reinstate workers while the NLRB in-
vestigates the retaliatory firing, and gives 
unions the ability to collect fair-share fees. 
For all the reasons above, IFPTE we re-
quest you vote for the PRO Act and opposed 
any weakening amendments that may be 
considered. 
Sincerely, 
PAUL SHEARON, 
President.

Secretary-Treasurer/Legislative Director.

WORKERS 
OF AMERICA—UAW, 
January 29, 2020. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
more than one million active and retired 
members of the International Union, United 
Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Im-
plement Workers of America, UAW, I urge 
you to vote Yes on the Protecting the Right 
to Organize (PRO) Act (H.R. 2474) and oppose 
any weakening amendments, including the 
motion to recommit. 
The right to form unions paved the way for 
the creation of a strong middle class. Over 
time, unions have vastly improved work-
place rights, wages, benefits, and conditions 
for all workers. A worker with a union con-
tract earns, on average, 13.2 percent more in 
wages than a peer with similar education, 
occupation, and experience in a nonunion-
ized workplace in the same sector. Although 
unions are fundamental to rebuilding the 
middle class, the percentage of workers in 
unions has declined over the last several dec-
ades. Weak labor laws, anti-worker policies 
and court rulings have severely curtailed 
workers’ rights to have a voice on the job. 
Aggressive employer anti-union campaigns 
and weak labor laws have taken a toll on 
workers as union membership has dimin-
ished from 33 percent in 1956 to 10 percent in 
2019. The ramifications of anti-worker poli-
cies extend well beyond the workplace and 
impact our society at large. Our labor laws 
need to be strengthened significantly. 
Over the past several decades, workers 
seeking to form their union at their work-
place have faced aggressive opposition from 
unscrupulous corporations and other well fi-
nanced anti-union special interest groups. 
According to the Economic Policy Institute 
(EPI), in one out of every three campaigns, 
employers fire pro-union workers, and spend 
at least $1 billion annually in opposition to 
organizing. EPI found that 90 percent of em-
ployers require captive-audience meetings to 
dissuade workers from joining a union. 
Lower unionization rates harm our middle 
class, economy and democratic institutions. 
Collective bargaining raises wages for both 
union and non-union workers, lessens racial 
wage gaps, and increases wages for women. 
The PRO Act directly addresses these and 
other problems by including provisions that 
could help ensure workers have a voice on 
the job and a fair opportunity to form a 
union if they so choose. Under the PRO Act, 
the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) 
would be empowered to assess significant 
monetary penalties to deter or punish em-
ployers that unlawfully fire workers for ex-
ercising their rights to form a union or for 
speaking out to improve working conditions. 
The bill would also allow workers to enforce 
their labor rights in federal court and pro-
hibit mandatory attendance in captive audi-
ence meetings. Should workers vote to form 
a union, the NLRB would be authorized to 
order immediate bargaining of a first con-
tract, which would avoid common employer 
stall tactics and deliberate misclassification 
of workers. It would also ensure that unions 
can collect ‘‘fair-share fees’’ and eliminates 
so-called ‘‘right to work’’ laws in order for 
unions to have the necessary resources to ef-
fectively enforce collective bargaining agree-
ments and other legally protected rights. 
Furthermore, the PRO Act protects em-
ployees’ right to strike by preventing em-
ployers from hiring permanent replacement 
workers. H.R. 2474 also permits unrepre-
sented employees to engage in collective ac-
tion or class action lawsuits to enforce basic 
workplace rights, rather than being forced to 
arbitrate such claims alone. It also reigns in 
offensive lockouts. In a lockout, a company 
expels its union-represented employees from 
the worksite, locks the gate, and refuses to 
permit them to return to work unless they 
accept the employer’s proposal. Companies 
have all too often chosen to lock out workers 
than rather engage in good faith negotia-
tions. 
The PRO Act will strengthen the middle 
class and our national economy. We urge you 
to vote Yes on H.R. 2474. 
Sincerely, 
JOSH NASSAR, 
UAW Legislative Director.

Chairwoman, I would remind the gen-

February 6, 2020 
precisely the result of the arrange-
ment, the balance that was struck by 
the National Labor Relations Act, 
which was passed in 1935. 
The National Labor Relations Act 
sets forth procedures so that workers 
and employers could both advocate for 
their rights in the economy. And so to 
ban intermittent strikes, as the gen-
tleman would propose, puts at stake 
two core portions of our Constitution’s 
First Amendment: the freedom to 
peaceably assemble and the freedom of 
speech. 
This amendment would place speech- 
and 
content-based 
restrictions 
on 
workers only because they choose to 
gather and speak on behalf of a union 
or forming a union. 
We freely allow civil rights pro-
testers, animal welfare activists, anti- 
choice activists, and all others to gath-
er and share their messages. Union 
members should be no different. 
Understand, going on strike is an op-
tion of last resort. No worker wants to 
risk their job and their paycheck to 
walk a picket line in the cold, the rain, 
or anything in-between. I have stood 
with striking workers and seen their 
resolve and know the impact striking 
has on them and their families. 
These workers strike because they 
must, because they have no other op-
tion but to say: ‘‘No more.’’ We must 
respect this resolve by allowing work-
ers the dignity to stand up for them-
selves and shout: ‘‘One day longer. One 
day stronger.’’ 
I urge my colleagues to oppose this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Chairwoman, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Chairwoman, recently, members of the 
United Auto Workers went on strike at 
General Motors for 40 days. There was 
no leader who made them do this, and 
I have never seen a strike, in fact in 
my life, that was dictated by someone 
from on high. The workers voted, in 
that case way over 90 percent, to go on 
strike. 
When I repeatedly visited picket 
lines at various workplaces throughout 
my district in Michigan, I was amazed 
that a lot of the veteran workers were 
out there striking; not for themselves. 
They were striking for workers forced 
to be temporary workers, and not hav-
ing full-time status and regularized 
status for months and years at a time. 
These 
veteran 
workers, 
some 
of 
whom had worked there 10, 20, 30 years 
said it just felt wrong to work side by 
side doing the same job with someone 
who was denied the pay and benefits 
due to workers at that workplace. 
All of this talk about union bosses 
disgusts 
me, 
Madam 
Chairwoman. 
Unions are organizations that workers 
build themselves to advocate for their 
interests. They are nonprofits. They 
are not businesses. In an economy 
where the real bosses are making 300 
and 400 times what the regular workers 
make, that is something that would be 
an obscenity to the people in the man-
ufacturing sector, to CEOs in the man-
ufacturing sector, decades ago. 
The CEO of General Motors, then the 
biggest company in the land, made 80 
times or 50 times—I forget, something 
like that—what the workers made, 
which is nothing like what happens 
today. Those are the bosses that need 
to be brought under control. 
The right to strike is basic to our 
labor relations and it must be pre-
served. We must pass the PRO Act. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is

tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 833, the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Chairwoman, 
today, as we consider the PRO Act, we 
think of how far the labor movement 
has come and how far we have yet to 
go. We think of all the important steps 
we need to take as a government and 
as a nation to rebuild our working 
class as productivity is dropping and 
inequality is rising, to ensure funda-
mental, basic protections are in place 
for a better work environment and a 
stronger economy for all, to secure 
workers’ rights to collectively bargain. 
The PRO Act represents the rights of 
the nearly 700,000 brothers and sisters 
in unions across my home State of 
Michigan where the steady humming of 
hard work and determination abounds. 
The PRO Act is in our bones. 
Public approval of labor unions is 
near a 50-year high, but union member-
ship is at its lowest level since just 
after the National Labor Relations Act 
was enacted in 1935. It is not a coinci-
dence that as union membership has 
declined, income inequality has soared. 
At the same time, new forms of work 
continue to emerge in our innovation 
economy, work that allows individuals 
the complete freedom to work when-
ever and for whomever they choose. 
Many 
developed 
countries 
have 
sought to address the changing nature 
of work through sectoral bargaining, 
where representatives of workers and 
employers in a given industry bargain 
over wages and standards throughout 
that industry. By covering more work-
ers under a collective bargaining agree-
ment, workers and employers can bar-
gain for industry-wide floors in wages 
and benefits. 
This amendment asks the Govern-
ment Accountability Office to look to 
the future by evaluating how laws and

February 6, 2020 
policies on sectoral bargaining have 
been playing out in other countries, 
strengthening workers’ ability to effec-
tively bargain in the face of a rapidly 
changing economy. 
Specifically, my amendment asks the 
GAO to assess the various forms of sec-
toral bargaining, including: 
One, 
multiemployer 
bargaining, 
which permits unions to collectively 
bargain contracts for workers across a 
region or an industry; 
Two, pattern bargaining, which in-
volves union organizing and collective 
bargaining with all the companies in 
an industry. The United Auto Workers 
has used this model to bargain for com-
mon terms with the big three in Michi-
gan; and 
Three, wage standard boards where 
government, industry, and labor would 
be responsible for setting wages, bene-
fits, and other terms and conditions of 
employment across specific industries. 
Madam Chairwoman, the Education 
and Labor Committee has held three 
hearings on the future of work where 
we have begun exploring alternative 
models to empower workers in the face 
of this rapidly changing economy. 
While sectoral bargaining is no sub-
stitute for the essential reforms in the 
PRO Act, a number of emerging indus-
tries, think tanks, and other worker 
advocates have begun to explore this 
idea to complement the PRO Act. 
We ask that the GAO also assess the 
economic impacts of sectoral bar-
gaining, 
including 
the 
impact 
on 
wages, prices, productivity, and the de-
velopment of emerging industries, in-
cluding 
those 
who 
engage 
their 
workforces through technology. 
As a co-chair of the Future of Work 
Task Force on the New Democrat Coa-
lition, we, as Democrats, realize that 
there is an urgency to start to fix the 
problem that some of this legislation 
addresses. But this must not be the end 
of the conversation of what we need to 
do to support workers and allow our 
economy to thrive in the 21st century 
labor movement. 
Another amendment I had introduced 
was not made in order, but it would 
have asked the GAO to explore the de-
ployment of portable benefit systems 
and the feasibility of a new employee 
classification for this gig economy and 
their employees. 
We will continue exploring these al-
ternative work models that ensure a 
strong set of benefits and protections 
for workers, while allowing them to re-
tain the independence and flexibility 
they want. 
With a comprehensive assessment by 
the GAO on sectoral bargaining in 
other countries, Congress will be better 
informed on the next steps after the 
PRO Act is enacted into law. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on my amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the 
gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chairwoman, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The Acting Chair. The gentlewoman 
is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chairwoman, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
This amendment will open Pandora’s 
box. Sectoral bargaining which would 
apply a single one-size-fits-all contract 
to every employee in every business 
across a particular industry in the 
United States would be an unmitigated 
disaster for American small businesses. 
It would rob small business owners and 
workers alike of the freedom to nego-
tiate their own contracts. 
Every business is different. One-size- 
fits-all union contracts applied across 
an entire industry throughout the 
United States would saddle small busi-
nesses with labor and employment 
costs that do not work for their par-
ticular business and that they may not 
be able to afford. 
Similarly, employees would be forced 
to accept wages, benefits, and other 
terms and conditions of employment 
that they had no say in determining, 
and that may not work for their indi-
vidual situations. 
b 1815 
Collective bargaining agreements al-
ready force workers into one-size-fits- 
all contracts, but currently, in the 
United States, they are at least con-
fined within the walls of one business 
at a time. 
Sectoral bargaining is a flawed and 
economically stifling policy used in 
other countries, and one we should not 
be importing into the United States. It 
would likely expand union contracts to 
hundreds of thousands of additional 
employees, to the detriment of every 
worker hoping for more individualized 
wages and benefits. 
The absence of sectoral bargaining 
has allowed America’s spirit of freedom 
and innovation to drive unrivaled eco-
nomic growth and prosperity. Congress 
should not entertain importing the so-
cialist method of collective bargaining 
from other countries. Look at our 
economy, especially compared to so-
cialist European economies. It is boom-
ing; they are stagnant. 
The United States Congress does not 
need to import the worst economic 
ideas from other countries with weaker 
economies, but socialist Democrats in-
sist on doing so. Sectoral bargaining is 
one such proposal that we should not 
entertain. 
Madam Chairman, I have seen some 
interesting amendments in my time in 
the Congress, in this Chamber, but I 
have to say, this is the most bizarre 
amendment that I believe I have ever 
seen. I urge my colleagues to defeat the 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

in part B of House Report 116–392. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Chair, I have

lows: 
Strike page 30, line 17, and all that follows 
through page 31, line 2. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 833, the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. MEADOWS) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from North Carolina. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Chairman, 
my amendment strikes the language in 
the PRO Act that would, in effect, re-
peal right-to-work laws nationwide. 
Currently, 27 States have adopted 
right-to-work laws that protect work-
ers in their States from forced union-
ization. Eight of these States further 
protect their workers by enshrining 
right to work in their State constitu-
tions. 
At their root, right-to-work laws let 
workers choose whether or not to join 
a union. Right-to-work laws do not ban 
union membership. Instead, they let 
workers, not their employer and not 
the government, make the choice for 
them. 
My colleagues opposite want to make 
the government the answer to every-
thing. Yet, here we are today, and we 
should be protecting American values, 
American freedoms, that freedom of 
speech and that freedom to associate as 
a worker chooses. 
The Supreme Court already recog-
nized these rights in the union context 
when it ruled that government workers 
cannot be forced to pay union dues. 
Taking away this freedom in the pri-
vate sector would reverse decades of 
protections that the States have given 
their workers. 
I might add that some of the best 
growing economies are States where we 
have this ability, and my colleagues 
opposite want to, indeed, come in and 
reach into States and tell them how to 
operate when we have growing econo-
mies? 
If California wants to make sure that 
everybody has to be in a union, let 
them move to California. 
But do you know what? The verdict 
is already in. They are leaving Cali-
fornia for States like Texas and other 
places where workers truly have the 
ability to choose for themselves. 
I believe that we ought to adopt this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Chairman, I claim the time in opposi-
tion to this amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is

Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Chairwoman, this amendment is a 
naked attempt to undermine unions by 
making it harder to collect reasonable 
fees for the services that they are re-
quired by law to perform. 
Unions have a legal obligation to rep-
resent and advocate for all members of

a bargaining unit, even if those people 
choose to remain nonunion. As a re-
sult, the law has created a perverse in-
centive for workers to receive the ben-
efits of unions’ labor without paying a 
reasonable fee for these services—in 
fact, without paying anything at all. 
For years, so-called right-to-work 
laws have been wildly misnamed. They 
don’t actually provide any right to a 
job. Instead, they allow States to inter-
fere with the freedom of contract, sole-
ly for the purposes of pitting workers 
against one another and threatening a 
union’s ability to exist at all. 
Let me be clear, the PRO Act does 
not allow the employer and union to 
agree that employees must be a mem-
ber of the union as a condition of em-
ployment. Despite the rhetoric, that 
has not been possible since the late 
1940s when the Supreme Court decided 
that no worker can be required to be a 
member of a union. It is simply false. 
Nor does it allow fair share dues to go 
toward political activity or advocacy. 
It covers only the cost of representa-
tion and contract administration, what 
the union is required by law to provide 
for everybody in the bargaining unit. 
The PRO Act simply restores fairness 
to the system. 
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues 
to oppose this amendment, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Chair, it is 
interesting to hear this debate because 
the very State that the gentleman is 
from is a right-to-work State. I find it 
just amazing. He comes down here and 
suggests that somehow Washington, 
D.C., knows better than his own home 
State. 
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER). 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Chair, 
I thank the gentleman. 
The gentleman over there used the 
word ‘‘perverse.’’ There is something 
perverse here, all right. I will say that 
I support the amendment by Mr. MEAD-
OWS. 
Among the numerous perverse power 
grabs in this bill offered today, H.R. 
2474 seeks to eliminate right-to-work 
protections 
nationwide, 
superseding 
laws passed in those 27 States my good 
friend talked about, including my 
home State of Texas, which as he al-
luded to, by the way, its economy is so 
successful and our economy so big that 
if we were a country, we would be the 
10th largest country in the world. That 
is how good our economy is. 
Right-to-work laws prohibit the ter-
mination of employees for refusal to 
join or pay dues or fees to an organiza-
tion they may or may not even sup-
port. 
Let’s protect families, not organiza-
tions. Let’s protect families’ incomes, 
not unions’. 
My friend Mr. MEADOWS’ amendment 
strikes the provision of this bill so that 
States may continue to protect work-
ers from forced unionization and en-
sure Americans keep their hard-earned 
money. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Chairwoman, the real motives are re-
vealed in the rhetoric. This is an at-
tack on unions themselves. 
The way that our labor relations 
have been organized since the 1930s 
when the Wagner Act was passed is 
that private-sector labor relations are 
governed by Federal law. Everything 
about our National Labor Relations 
Act and the way workers can form 
unions in the private sector and the 
rules for how elections happen, all 
these things are Federal. 
This carve-out for States to be able 
to try to starve workers’ organizations 
by allowing this free-riding to go on is 
something that happened over Presi-
dent Truman’s veto, and, yes, we have 
been against it for the last 70 years. 
The proof is in the pudding. The right- 
to-freeload States have lower incomes; 
they have lower percentages of workers 
who have benefits; and they have 
shorter life expectancy. 
Over and over, the statistics show 
that workers and families are better 
off. The old saw about letting people 
keep their hard-earned money, unions 
are something that workers form vol-
untarily to advance their interests. 
Union members make more money 
than nonunion members. They make a 
great investment by coming together 
and bargaining together to form a 
union. 
Our labor relations are set up for 
workers to make a democratic choice 
as a group in a workplace about wheth-
er or not to form a union. If workers 
come together and make that choice, it 
is only fair that everybody pays their 
fair share to administer the contract 
that benefits all of them. 
Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Chair, I just 
find it amazing that somehow we are 
here debating this issue, and he is sug-
gesting that the numbers prove his 
point, and they do exactly the oppo-
site. 
The fact of the matter is that the 
reason why unions are failing is be-
cause the workers are going other 
places because they get a better ben-
efit. 
It is what it is because of what we are 
seeing on the ground not only in North 
Carolina and Texas but in 27 other 
States. It is more than half of the 
country. 
Yet 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Michigan over here somehow says: 
Well, it is the freeloaders. 
I can tell you, Madam Chair, based 
on his assumption, there are a few peo-
ple who pay dues into the Freedom 
Caucus. Some of the things that we 
have supported he has actually bene-
fited from. So should he pay dues to 
the Freedom Caucus, based on his as-
sumption? 
I think that he would have a problem 
with that, just like everyone over here 
has a problem with forcing people to 
pay union dues when they don’t want 
to join the union, and this is the pro-
tection for that. 
I suggest that we support this amend-
ment, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Chairwoman, 
I 
challenge 
the 
gen-
tleman to point out a Chamber of Com-
merce in this country that allows peo-
ple to receive the benefits of the cham-
ber without paying dues. They have 
members 
and 
nonmembers. 
Health 
clubs, any kind of organization in this 
country, people pay their fair share for 
the benefits that it creates. 
The purpose of right-to-freeload laws 
has been nakedly obvious from the be-
ginning in the 1940s when they were 
pushed by far rightwing foundations 
like the Olin Foundation and the 
Scaife Foundation, whose sole purpose 
was to destroy collective bargaining in 
this country. 
The other side is trying to destroy 
the solidarity of American workers, to 
benefit the bosses and the employers 
that want to have a union-free environ-
ment. 
The facts are so obvious. When work-
ers come together and form unions, 
they make more money; they make 
better wages; they are five times more 
likely to have a pension; and they are 
much more likely to have employer- 
provided health insurance. This is the 
truth. 
Employers and their enablers simply 
want to destroy collective bargaining 
in this country, and I don’t care if it is 
State by State or any other way. 
Right is right, and wrong is wrong. 
These laws have been wrong since they 
came into existence, and they are still 
wrong today. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Chair, may I 
inquire how much time I have remain-
ing. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from North Carolina has 45 seconds re-
maining. 
Mr. MEADOWS. Madam Chair, at 
least we have found something that the 
gentleman from Michigan and I can 
agree on. What is wrong is wrong, and 
that is wrong. 
When you look at what the gen-
tleman is trying to propose with his 
legislation, and the fact that he is try-
ing to put the will of Washington, D.C., 
on States all across this great country, 
that is wrong. 
Why do we not allow the status quo 
to continue? Why? Because it is good 
for workers. It is good for my State. It 
is good for South Carolina. It is good 
for Texas. It is good for all kinds of 
States. I would even say it is good for 
his State because he is a right-to-work 
State. 
But do you know what? We have 
talking points that are prepared by 
people who will benefit from this legis-
lation and nothing more. This does not 
help the worker. 
Madam Chair, I urge the adoption of 
my amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.

uting factor in the unfavorable personnel ac-
tion alleged in the complaint. 
‘‘(3) BURDENS OF PROOF.— 
‘‘(A)

DETERMINATION.—In 
making a determination or adjudicating a 
complaint pursuant to this subsection, the 
Secretary, an administrative law judge or a 
court may determine that a violation of sub-

adverse action alleged in the complaint. 
‘‘(B) PROHIBITION.—Notwithstanding sub-
paragraph (A), a decision or order that is fa-
vorable to the complainant shall not be 
issued in any administrative or judicial ac-

Secretary of Labor concludes that there is 
reasonable cause to believe that a violation 
of subsection (a) has occurred, the Secretary

nary order providing the relief prescribed by 
paragraph (4)(B). 
‘‘(D) REQUEST
FOR
HEARING.—Not later 
than 30 days after the date of receipt of noti-
fication of a determination of the Secretary 
of Labor under this paragraph, either the 
person alleged to have committed the viola-
tion or the complainant may file objections 
to the findings or preliminary order, or both, 
and request a hearing on the record. The fil-
ing of such objections shall not operate to 
stay any reinstatement remedy contained in 
the preliminary order. Any such hearing 
shall be conducted expeditiously, and if a 
hearing is not requested in such 30-day pe-
riod, the preliminary order shall be deemed a 
final order that is not subject to judicial re-
view.

GENERAL.—A hearing requested 
under this paragraph shall be conducted ex-
peditiously and in accordance with rules es-

EVI-
DENCE.— In conducting any such hearing, the 
administrative law judge may issue sub-
poenas. The respondent or complainant may

FINAL
ORDERS; REVIEW 
PROCEDURES.—

that a violation of subsection (a) has oc-
curred, the Secretary of Labor shall order 
the person who committed such violation— 
‘‘(I) to take affirmative action to abate the 
violation; 
‘‘(II) to reinstate the complainant to his or 
her former position, together with com-
pensation (including back pay with interest) 
and restore the terms, conditions, and privi-
leges associated with his or her employment;

favorable personnel action, and, at the com-
plainant’s direction, transmission of a copy 
of the decision on the complaint to any per-
son whom the complainant reasonably be-
lieves may have received such unfavorable 
information.

the Secretary of Labor, by the complainant 
for, or in connection with, the bringing of 
the complaint upon which the order was 
issued. 
‘‘(C) FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS.—If the Secretary 
of Labor finds that a complaint under para-

February 6, 2020 
‘‘(D) DE NOVO REVIEW.— 
‘‘(i) FAILURE OF THE SECRETARY TO ACT.—If 
the Secretary of Labor has not issued a final 
order within 270 days after the date of filing 
of a complaint under this subsection, or 
within 90 days after the date of receipt of a 
written determination, the complainant may 
bring an action at law or equity for de novo 
review in the appropriate district court of 
the United States having jurisdiction, which 
shall have jurisdiction over such an action 
without regard to the amount in con-
troversy, and which action shall, at the re-
quest of either party to such action, be tried 
by the court with a jury. 
‘‘(ii) PROCEDURES.—A proceeding under 
clause (i) shall be governed by the same legal 
burdens of proof specified in paragraph (3). 
The court shall have jurisdiction to grant all 
relief necessary to make the employee 
whole, including injunctive relief and com-
pensatory damages, including— 
‘‘(I) reinstatement with the same seniority 
status that the employee would have had, 
but for the discharge or discrimination; 
‘‘(II) the amount of back pay, with inter-
est; 
‘‘(III) compensation for any special dam-
ages sustained as a result of the discharge or 
discrimination, including litigation costs, 
expert witness fees, and reasonable attorney 
fees; and 
‘‘(IV) expungement of all warnings, rep-
rimands, or derogatory references that have 
been placed in paper or electronic records or 
databases of any type relating to the actions 
by the complainant that gave rise to the un-
favorable personnel action, and, at the com-
plainant’s direction, transmission of a copy 
of the decision on the complaint to any per-
son whom the complainant reasonably be-
lieves may have received such unfavorable 
information. 
‘‘(E) OTHER
APPEALS.—Unless the com-
plainant brings an action under subpara-
graph (D), any person adversely affected or 
aggrieved by a final order issued under sub-
paragraph (A) may file a petition for review 
of the order in the United States Court of 
Appeals for the circuit in which the violation 
with respect to which the order was issued, 
allegedly occurred or the circuit in which 
the complainant resided on the date of such 
violation, not later than 60 days after the 
date of the issuance of the final order of the 
Secretary of Labor under subparagraph (A). 
Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5, 
United States Code. The commencement of 
proceedings under this subparagraph shall 
not, unless ordered by the court, operate as 
a stay of the order. An order of the Secretary 
of Labor with respect to which review could 
have been obtained under this subparagraph 
shall not be subject to judicial review in any 
criminal or other civil proceeding. 
‘‘(5) FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ORDER.— 
‘‘(A) ACTIONS
BY
THE
SECRETARY.—If any 
person has failed to comply with a final 
order issued under paragraph (4), the Sec-
retary of Labor may file a civil action in the 
United States district court for the district 
in which the violation was found to have oc-
curred, or in the United States district court 
for the District of Columbia, to enforce such 
order. In actions brought under this para-
graph, the district courts shall have jurisdic-
tion to grant all appropriate relief including 
injunctive relief, compensatory and punitive 
damages. 
‘‘(B) CIVIL
ACTIONS
TO
COMPEL
COMPLI-
ANCE.—A person on whose behalf an order 
was issued under paragraph (4) may com-
mence a civil action against the person to 
whom such order was issued to require com-
pliance with such order. The appropriate 
United States district court shall have juris-
diction, without regard to the amount in 
controversy or the citizenship of the parties, 
to enforce such order. 
‘‘(C) AWARD
OF
COSTS
AUTHORIZED.—The 
court, in issuing any final order under this 
paragraph, may award costs of litigation (in-
cluding reasonable attorney and expert wit-
ness fees) to any party, whenever the court 
determines such award is appropriate. 
‘‘(D) MANDAMUS
PROCEEDINGS.—Any non-
discretionary duty imposed by this section 
shall be enforceable in a mandamus pro-
ceeding brought under section 1361 of title 28, 
United States Code. 
‘‘(d) UNENFORCEABILITY OF CERTAIN AGREE-
MENTS.—Notwithstanding any other provi-
sion of law, the rights and remedies provided 
for in this section may not be waived by any 
agreement, policy, form, or condition of em-
ployment, including by any predispute arbi-
tration agreement. 
‘‘(e) SAVINGS.—Nothing in this subsection 
shall be construed to diminish the rights, 
privileges, or remedies of any employee who 
exercises rights under any Federal or State 
law or common law, or under any collective 
bargaining agreement.’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 833, the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I 
rise with enthusiasm and support for 
H.R. 2474, the PRO Act. 
I would indicate that in America we 
would ask the question, When will we 
have a 40-hour week or the weekend? 
All brought about by union organizing 
and union leadership. 
We need the PRO Act to ensure that 
Americans across the land have the 
ability legally to organize and to be 
able to operate under the Labor Man-
agement Reporting and Disclosure Act. 
Let me also say that it is imperative 
that we begin to recognize that the 
American people like unions. Over 64 
percent of Americans and millennials 
appreciate the idea of having represen-
tation for better quality of life and 
work. 
So I rise to add to this very impor-
tant legislation an amendment that ex-
tends whistleblower protections to em-
ployees of both employers and unions 
under the Labor Management Report-
ing and Disclosure Act. This is a fair 
and balanced amendment. We remem-
ber Supreme Court decisions like the 
Janus Act, and many others, who un-
dermine the ability for unions to be 
able to organize or to engage. This pro-
tects the people who are trying to or-
ganize. 
But the whistleblower protections 
allow employees of employers and em-
ployees of unions to be protected if 
they see something wrong and they 
want to make sure that it is right. 
Let me give you an example: 
Today, I met Kimberly Lawson, who 
is part of the Fight for $15. She also 
came to share the problems she has had 
with sexual harassment on the job. It 
happens to be in one of the fast-food 
operations. She said, on the record, 
that if we could pass the PRO Act, she 
wouldn’t be alone trying to raise our 
hourly wage or face sexual harassment 
without a union to help her. 
This is important legislation. The 
whistleblower protection is important 
because Ms. Lawson would have the 
ability to be able to report what is hap-
pening to her without losing her job as 
a single mother with a young child. 
Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to 
support the Jackson Lee amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I claim the time in opposition to 
the amendment, although I plan to 
vote in favor of the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, this amendment is little more 
than a recognition from the Democrats 
that the PRO Act is truly a union boss 
wish list that strips rights away from 
workers, increases the coercive power 
of union bosses, and will make union 
corruption like we are seeing at the 
United 
Auto 
Workers 
Union 
even 
likelier. 
It is ironic that Democrats have cho-
sen to offer whistleblower protection 
for illegal union activities 
as 
an 
amendment to the PRO Act after years 
of opposing more transparency and ac-
countability for union leaders when the 
Republicans were in the majority. 
Last Congress, Congressman FRANCIS 
ROONEY offered not one, but two bills 
with 
whistleblower 
protections 
for 
union corruption. Both bills had zero 
Democrat cosponsors. This attempt to 
provide Democrat Members with a 
talking point is too little too late and 
does nothing to address the PRO Act’s 
overwhelming problems. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, 
may I inquire as to how much time is 
remaining? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from Texas has 3 minutes remaining. 
The gentlewoman from North Carolina 
has 4 minutes remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, 
let me, first of all, thank the gentle-
woman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Ms. 
FOXX), ranking member, for her sup-
port. 
Let me also thank the chairman of 
this committee for his leadership and 
support, and the staff for working with 
my staff so very ably. 
But let me add that, as I have seen, 
committee Democrats on this par-
ticular committee strongly agree that 
allegations of corruption should be 
fully investigated. They have not ig-
nored it, and those who are charged 
should be prosecuted and held account-
able. They have not ignored it. That is 
why we have robust criminal and civil 
penalties for unions and companies. 
This is about whistleblower protec-
tion, and I would say that no union is 
against this. That is why this amend-
ment particularly reinforces that the 
employees of employers and employees 
of unions have the right to bring to the 
attention anything that undermines

their workplace or their quality of 
work. 
I believe this is an amendment that 
all of us can support and that it focuses 
on whistleblowers, and I ask my col-
leagues to support it. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, Democrats bemoan that plum-
meting union membership does not re-
flect workers’ actual opinion of unions. 
But NLRB decisions and so-called con-
servative attacks are not the reason 
workers have voluntarily chosen to 
leave unions behind. 
Democrats and their friends in Big 
Labor refuse to acknowledge that mil-
lions 
of 
workers 
are 
simply 
dis-
enchanted with union representation 
and that union leaders have lost the 
trust of their members. 
We need not look any further than 
the ongoing corruption scandal at 
United Auto Workers in which several 
high-ranking union officials have al-
ready been convicted of a litany of 
crimes, including embezzlement, mis-
use of workers’ union dues on lavish 
personal expenses, money laundering, 
tax fraud, and accepting bribes in vio-
lation of Federal labor law. 
Two former UAW vice presidents 
have been charged. The last two UAW 
presidents have been formally impli-
cated in a racketeering scheme of more 
than $1.5 million, and the current UAW 
president is under investigation for re-
ceiving bribes and kickbacks. 
The UAW is now at risk of being 
placed under Federal oversight under 
the Racketeering Influence and Corrup-
tion Organization Act, or RICO. That is 
why I have sent not one, not two, but 
three letters requesting a public hear-
ing by the Committee on Education 
and Labor to examine this widening 
corruption scandal. 
It should come as no surprise that 
the UAW, long one of the largest 
unions in the country and a major ben-
efactor of the Democrat party, lost 
35,000 members in 2018, and the overall 
union membership fell again in 2019 to 
just 6.2 percent. 
Rather than increase transparency 
and accountability to serve workers 
better, over the past decade unions suc-
cessfully lobbied the Obama adminis-
tration to roll back transparency re-
quirements and are now calling on 
their political allies in Congress to 
pass the radical, coercive H.R. 2474 as a 
bailout. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, 
may I inquire how much time is re-
maining for both sides? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from Texas has 2 minutes remaining. 
The gentlewoman from North Carolina 
has 2 minutes remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, 
let me be very clear. It is an important 
point to make that Democrats—the 
committee Democrats, in particular— 
recognize that a few bad actors are not 
going to deter or dissuade us from tak-
ing this historic step towards strength-
ening workers’ rights to organize and 
restoring balance to the economy. 
As I said earlier, the growing support 
for unions is phenomenal. Millions of 
Americans look for a better quality of 
life because unions are negotiating on 
their behalf. If this particular em-
ployee at the fast-food organization 
had a union, she would be able to orga-
nize and ensure that she got $15 an 
hour, or to be able to make sure she 
had better healthcare for her young 5- 
year-old. 
Madam Chair, this is legislation that 
is long in coming. And my amendment 
adds to the importance of it by pro-
tecting whistleblowers who work for 
employers and work for unions. I also 
want to say that the Government Ac-
countability 
Project 
that 
protects 
whistleblowers is supporting this legis-
lation. I would ask that my colleagues 
support it because we are standing up 
to corruption, but we are also standing 
up for workers—workers who need op-
portunities and the ability to get a bet-
ter quality of life. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Democrats 
believe 
one-size-fits-all 
union contracts are good for workers in 
the modern economy and that forcing 
these workers to pay hundreds of dol-
lars per year to left-wing political or-
ganizations is the only way to guar-
antee wage growth, combat inequality, 
and strengthen the middle class. But 
the last 3 years and beyond have made 
clear that nothing could be further 
from the truth. 
Wages are not stagnant, and to claim 
they are is a blatant lie. Wages have 
grown by 3 percent each of the last 2 
years. Moreover, the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Atlanta reported the pay for 
the bottom 25 percent of workers rose 
4.5 percent from a year earlier, com-
pared to 2.9 percent for the top 25 per-
cent, meaning wages are rising faster 
for rank-and-file workers than for their 
bosses. 
Over the first 3 years of the Trump 
presidency, wages for the bottom 10 
percent of earners over age 25 rose an 
average of 5.9 percent per year com-
pared to 2.4 percent during President 
Obama’s second term. Wages for the 
middle two quartiles have also grown 
faster under President Trump than 
during President Obama’s second term. 
Overall, the typical American house-
hold earns over $1,000 more per month 
today, adjusted for inflation, than it 
did in 1975. The union membership rate 
today is less than half of what it was in 
1975. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, do 
I have the right to close as the pro-
ponent of the amendment? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from Texas has the right to close. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I believe that I am in opposition, 
do I not have the right to close? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from North Carolina indicated her sup-
port for the amendment. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, may I inquire how much time I 
have remaining? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from North Carolina has 30 seconds re-
maining. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I am prepared to close, and I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Chair, the PRO Act is one of 
the most antiworker and anti-small 
business bills to be considered by Con-
gress in decades, and this amendment 
does not change that. 
The PRO Act is a liberal Democrat 
wish list designed to enrich and em-
power union bosses and trial lawyers at 
the expense of rank-and-file workers 
and small businesses. 
While I will support the amendment 
by the gentlewoman from Texas, we 
will still oppose the bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, 
may I inquire how much time is re-
maining? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
has 1 minute remaining. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I 
thank the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina for us being able to come to-
gether around a very vital amendment 
that gives protection to employees of 
employers and employees of unions to 
be able to indicate when matters are 
wrong, incorrect, or violate the law, or 
impact negatively on employees of any 
organization. 
But what I would say is that it is im-
portant that this particular legislation 
go forward because of the historic na-
ture of ensuring the ability to organize 
for willing individuals. 
And let me cite Kimberly Lawson 
again. She is fighting for $15. A union 
would help her provide for her family 
and organize for those dollars. Maybe 
we don’t know about those particular 
workers who are living below the pov-
erty line or living with wages that are 
below an hourly wage or decent wage. 
Unions would help that. 
We cannot talk about individuals al-
ready in the higher, upper brow of 
work in this Nation. Their salaries 
may be going up. Hers is not. 
Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to 
support and vote for the Jackson Lee 
amendment and support the PRO Act. 
Madam Chair, I would like to offer an 
amendment today that would provide whistle-
blower protections to employees who report 
violations of the Labor Management Reporting 
and Disclosure Act (LMRDA). This amend-
ment covers BOTH employees of employers 
as well as employees of labor unions. 
The LMRDA is an important labor law 
passed in 1959 that protects union members’ 
through a ‘‘bill of rights’’ for members of labor 
organizations, requires extensive reporting and

public disclosure of labor union finances, 
guards against the failure to observe high 
standards of responsibility and ethical conduct 
by providing civil and criminal remedies 
against employers and unions who engage in 
misconduct, and mandates transparency re-
garding arrangements between employers and 
anti-labor consultants. 
I am pleased that the PRO Act includes re-
forms to the LMRDA that further clarify the 
original intent of the law by ensuring that em-
ployers not only disclose arrangements they 
enter into with antiunion consultants to directly 
persuade employees on how to exercise their 
rights under the NLRA, but also to disclose ar-
rangements where the consultants are hired to 
engage in indirect persuasion activities. 
Examples of indirect persuasion include 
planning employee meetings, drafting speech-
es or presentations to employees, training em-
ployer representatives, identifying employees 
for disciplinary action or targeting, or drafting 
employer personnel policies. 
The DOL has narrowly construed the law for 
too long and excludes up to 75% of the ar-
rangements with union busting consultants. To 
remedy this, the PRO Act reinstates require-
ments of the Persuader Rule adopted by the 
Obama Administration in 2016 but was unfor-
tunately repealed by the Trump Administration. 
That repeal, coupled with the Trump Adminis-
tration’s refusal to defend the rule in court, en-
sures workers remain in the dark about the 
activities of consultants hired to bust union or-
ganizing drives. 
Another way to strengthen the LMRDA is to 
provide whistleblower protections; which is ex-
actly what this amendment does. All workers 
deserve whistleblower protections for reporting 
potential violations of law, no matter their 
place of employment or the type of employer. 
This amendment covers reporting alleged vio-
lations by an employee, regardless of whether 
their employer is a business or a labor organi-
zation. 
This amendment allows employees to file 
complaints with the Department of Labor and 
provides for a prompt investigation of allega-
tions of unlawful retaliation. It ensures employ-
ees have a right to a hearing, and effective 
remedies including reinstatement, back pay 
and attorney fees. And if the DOL fails to act 
in a timely manner, employees have the right 
to bring suit in federal court to secure a rem-
edy. I urge all members to support this 
amendment. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I 
demand a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by 
the gentlewoman from Texas will be 
postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 12 OFFERED BY MR. ROONEY OF 
FLORIDA 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 12 printed 
in part B of House Report 116–392. 
Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Madam 
Chair, I have an amendment at the 
desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 16, beginning line 1, strike subpara-
graph (A) and insert the following: 
(A) in paragraph (1)— 
(i) in subparagraph (A), by striking ‘‘or’’ at 
the end; 
(ii) in subparagraph (B), by adding ‘‘or’’ at 
the end; and 
(iii) by inserting after subparagraph (B) 
the following new subparagraph: 
‘‘(C) by an employee or a group of employ-
ees or any individual or labor organization 
acting in their behalf, or an employer, alleg-
ing that the labor organization that has been 
certified or is currently recognized by the 
employer as the bargaining representative is 
no longer a representative as defined in sub-
section (a), if— 
‘‘(i) fewer than 50 percent of the members 
of the bargaining unit in question had an op-
portunity to vote in the certification elec-
tion that resulted in certifying the labor or-
ganization then recognized as the bargaining 
representative for such unit; or 
‘‘(ii) no certification election was con-
ducted regarding such unit;’’; 
Page 17, after line 8, insert the following: 
(B) in paragraph (2), by adding at the end 
the following: ‘‘When a petition is filed under 
paragraph (1)(C), a question of representa-
tion affecting commerce exists if the peti-
tioner establishes the existence of the cir-
cumstances described in paragraph (1)(C)(i) 
or paragraph (1)(C)(ii).’’; 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 833, the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. ROONEY) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Florida. 
Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Madam 
Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Chair, I am proud to offer 
this pro-worker amendment. Current 
employees are locked into old, obso-
lete, and outdated union contracts that 
were approved long before they ever 
came to work there. 
Employees deserve a voice that is re-
flective of today’s rapidly modernizing 
workforce 
and 
workplace. 
Baby 
boomers are retiring, and countless ex-
isting employees are locked into col-
lective bargaining agreements made 
decades ago. 
In 2016 alone, NLRB data showed that 
only 6 percent of union members voted 
to be represented by their union in 
those agreements that they were bound 
to. This simple amendment would 
allow employees to petition for a union 
certification election whenever fewer 
than 50 percent of the current union 
members were members during the last 
election. It also empowers employees 
who might deem unions unnecessary. It 
will allow them the right to decertify 
and to represent themselves. 
This proposal gives new and current 
employees a seat at the table. They get 
their own voice and it provides for 
more accountability. With the recent 
news of embezzlement and corruption 
by United Auto Worker Union bosses, 
we must go further to empower all em-
ployees who are forced to pay dues to 
their unions that they haven’t voted on 
or wanted. 
All employees deserve honest rep-
resentation and the ability to decertify 
a collective bargaining agreement if 
they no longer need union representa-
tion. I encourage all of my colleagues 
to join me in supporting the current 
and future workforce by supporting 
this amendment. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
b 1845 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. I rise in op-
position to this amendment, Madam 
Chairwoman. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Michigan is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Chairwoman, there are no workers in 
America who are ‘‘locked into collec-
tive bargaining agreements negotiated 
decades ago’’—zero. 
What happens in our country is that 
workers vote to form a union in a 
workplace, and then they periodically 
negotiate contracts. 
Usually, contracts last 2 or 3 years, 4 
or 5 years. It is usually employers who 
want them to last longer. And the two 
parties, in freedom of contract, agree 
on those terms. 
What the gentleman’s amendment 
seeks to do is not for workers to have 
any rights whatsoever. Workers al-
ready have the right to decertify a 
union through an election. What this 
amendment seeks to do is to give a 
right to employers to destroy unions 
by not recognizing a union anymore 
under very strange circumstances. 
The point of the National Labor Re-
lations Act is to protect employees’ 
freedom to choose a union or refrain 
from forming a union. This amend-
ment, however, undermines that right 
by allowing an employer to step in and 
demand a new election without any ob-
jective showing that the union no 
longer enjoys majority support, no ob-
jective showing whatsoever. 
As I said, employees already have the 
right to petition for another election if 
that is what they want. That is an ex-
isting law. It is in the PRO Act. 
This amendment is a backdoor to 
providing an employer the ability to 
conduct another antiunion campaign 
designed to sow fear and discord 
amongst its employees. Under this 
amendment, a union with majority 
support could be challenged by an em-
ployer simply by virtue of the passage 
of time and the natural turnover that 
exists in all workplaces. 
My colleagues across the aisle often 
speak about the need to protect em-
ployees’ rights to choose a union, and 
yet here they are seeking to undermine 
that very right. This amendment is 
about promoting decertification, not 
protecting the rights of workers. 
Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Madam 
Chairwoman, I would like to reempha-
size a couple of facts here that are at

variance from what the gentleman 
from over there said. 
Six percent of union members have 
voted to be represented by their union 
under current collective bargaining 
agreements. This amendment would 
say, if 50 percent or more of the people 
in a collective bargaining agreement 
never voted on it, they get the right to 
vote on it. 
We all know people in business who 
have dealt with unions—and I have de-
certified unions all over Oklahoma and 
Texas and other States. These con-
tracts are not as easy to decertify, 
given the existing impediments as 
might be seen. This law would enable 
those workers to have the freedom to 
do it themselves and not be subjugated 
to agreements that they never voted on 
in the first place. 
When I decertified the unions in 
Oklahoma and Texas back in the 
eighties, thousands of our building 
trades employees flocked to vote yes to 
get rid of the unions because they 
weren’t adding value and they wanted 
to keep those fees for themselves. 
Since that time, we know how the con-
struction industry has developed in 
Oklahoma and Texas. 
So I speak from real, personal experi-
ence, having been a member of the car-
penters union, that it is good to give 
employees the right to decertify their 
union and to make it easier for them to 
do that. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Chairwoman, I reiterate that workers 
have the right to decertify a union if 
they want to under existing law and 
under the PRO Act. It doesn’t change 
that. What we do is say that employers 
may not stop recognizing a union sim-
ply because of turnover. 
If workers negotiated a contract with 
an employer through their union sev-
eral years ago and now there has been 
some turnover, that doesn’t mean the 
workers are against the collective bar-
gaining agreement that benefits them. 
The contract will expire, and then the 
workers will negotiate another one, 
whichever workers are there at that 
time. At that time, if a majority of the 
workers want to decertify the union, 
they are fully free to do that. 
What the gentleman is trying to de-
fend is the employer’s role in destroy-
ing unions. That is what is really going 
on here. 
Madam Chairwoman, in my 30-some 
years of being involved in the labor 
movement, the biggest problem in 
workers’ freedom to form unions is the 
idea that the employers are a party, 
and you have to try to create a union 
or keep a union by going up against 
your boss, the person who decides your 
wages, decides your assignment. This is 
just another tactic to allow employers 
to pressure workers out of having col-
lective bargaining. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Madam 
Chairwoman, how much time do I 
have? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Florida has 21⁄2 minutes remain-
ing. 
Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Madam 
Chairwoman, maybe I ought to do this 
in Spanish or Italian, because we are 
not communicating effectively. 
There is nothing in this amendment 
that has anything to do with employers 
determining who is or is not decerti-
fied. It is when a certain number of em-
ployees have not voted on that collec-
tive bargaining agreement because of 
turnover in the rapidly evolving, mod-
ernizing workforce—which I appreciate 
the gentleman recognizing—it makes it 
easier for them to do it. 
Employers don’t have a role in this. 
This is about employees deciding if 
they want to keep their collective bar-
gaining agreement or not. 
We have all seen the difficult institu-
tional impediments to the ability to 
decertify the way it is right now. This 
will help that and recognize that we 
are in an era of high volatility, work-
ers going to many more jobs than they 
used to throughout their career, and 
making the NLRB get with the pro-
gram on adapting to the current work-
force that we live in. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Chairwoman, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Madam 
Chairwoman, one more time, I would 
like to say that the NLRB was a very 
important piece of legislation 70 years 
ago. These little tweaks like this to up-
date the NLRB for the modern work-
force, the volatility, the digital era, 
are perfectly legitimate and logical re-
sponses to the conditions that we find 
ourselves in now. 
We don’t have carpenters who would 
spend their entire career at one com-
pany anymore. They come and go at 
different places. It happens in manu-
facturing as well. This bill would rec-
ognize that volatility and institu-
tionalize it in a constructive manner. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. How much 
time do I have, Madam Chairwoman? 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
has 11⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Chairwoman, I would point out that 
the gentleman’s amendment says that 
an employer alleging that a labor orga-
nization no longer has majority status 
because of turnover may seek a decer-
tification election. The gentleman’s 
amendment empowers the employer to 
decertify the union. 
What we are doing in the PRO Act is 
overturning the Johnson Controls deci-
sion of the Trump NLRB from July 3 of 
last year that allowed an employer to 
announce it was withdrawing recogni-
tion of a union because of this turn-
over, because simply more than half 
the people weren’t there the last time 
they negotiated a contract or when the 
union was formed. 
This is an attempt to allow employ-
ers to determine that they want an-
other election and to go all, again, 
through the captive audience meetings 
where they force workers to attend on 
pain of termination, meetings whose 
sole purpose is to scare workers out of 
forming a union, to show movies or 
other propaganda that doesn’t have to 
be truthful at all to scare workers out 
of forming a union. 
It is time to stop having employers 
prevent workers from forming a union. 
That was the purpose of this amend-
ment. That is why I oppose it. I urge 
all my colleagues to oppose it. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. ROONEY). 
The amendment was rejected. 
AMENDMENT NO. 13 OFFERED BY MR. VARGAS 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 13 printed 
in part B of House Report 116–392. 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Chair, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
On page 19, line 15, strike ‘‘and’’. 
On page 19, after line 15, insert the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(B) a regional director shall transmit the 
notice of election at the same time as the di-
rection of election, and shall transmit such 
notice and such direction electronically (in-
cluding transmission by email or facsimile) 
or by overnight mail if electronic trans-
mission is unavailable; and’’. 
On page 19, line 16, strike ‘‘(B)’’ and insert 
‘‘(C)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 833, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. VARGAS) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Chair, I rise to 
offer an amendment to improve the ef-
ficiency of the union election process. 
This 
amendment 
will 
reverse 
an 
antiworker rule adopted by the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board several 
months after the PRO Act was marked 
up in the Education and Labor Com-
mittee. 
The PRO Act strengthens workers’ 
rights to a free and fair union represen-
tation election. It does so by pre-
venting unnecessary delays. If we allow 
these delays to occur, then we are al-
lowing employers more time to engage 
in antiunion campaigns designed to 
erode support for the union. 
Democracy in the workplace should 
be a right, not a fight, and the workers 
who request a union representation 
election should not be denied their 
right to vote through unnecessary 
delay. 
In 2014, the National Labor Relations 
Board, the NLRB, updated its union 
election procedures by enacting rea-
sonable deadlines and preventing em-
ployers from stalling elections through 
frivolous litigation. The PRO Act codi-
fies many of those requirements, in-
cluding the timelines for pre- and post- 
election hearings.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H915 
February 6, 2020 
The 2014 election rule protected the 
integrity of the union representation 
process and was upheld in every court 
where it was challenged. However, on 
December 18, 2019, the Trump NLRB re-
scinded parts of the 2014 rule, bur-
dening the employees with unnecessary 
delays and giving employers more op-
portunity to stall a timely election 
with frivolous litigation. 
One important change in the 2014 
election 
rule 
was 
that, 
once 
the 
NLRB’s regional director decides that 
a representation election should be 
held, the director must ordinarily issue 
the notice of election at the same time 
as that decision. The notice of election 
must be posted in the workplace. It is 
crucial to informing employees of the 
time and details of the voting process. 
However, the Trump NLRB changed 
this policy to allow delay before the re-
gional director issues a notice which 
details the election. This amendment 
removes the delay by requiring the de-
cision directing an election and the no-
tice of an election to be issued at the 
same time, unless extraordinary cir-
cumstances warrant otherwise. 
In doing so, my amendment provides 
clarity to employees so that they may 
know the details of their election as 
soon as possible. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment, despite my affection for 
the gentleman offering it. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from North Carolina is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Chair, while this amendment 
appears to make arbitrary changes to 
union election procedures, make no 
mistake: It is part of Democrats’ and 
union bosses’ ongoing efforts to rush 
the union election process at the ex-
pense of American workers by requir-
ing 
that 
National 
Labor 
Relation 
Board, NLRB, regional directors trans-
mit the notice of election at the same 
time as the direction of election. 
This amendment should actually be 
called the ambush elections amend-
ment, as it would worsen the already 
harmful impacts of the Obama NLRB’s 
ambush election rule, which shortened 
the timeline for union elections from a 
median of 38 days to as few as 11 days. 
This amendment would reduce the 
timeline even more, increasing the un-
fair advantage for labor unions that 
the Obama NLRB created and which 
the PRO Act makes Federal law. 
The unfairly condensed timeline re-
quired by this amendment—in which 
employers are expected to obtain coun-
sel, understand complex matters of 
labor law, and effectively communicate 
with their employees—infringes on an 
employer’s right to due process and is 
antithetical to the NLRB’s promise of 
a fair and robust election process. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
b 1900 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Unnecessary delays in union rep-
resentation elections enable employers 
to have more time to campaign against 
unions through lawful or unlawful 
means. 
Once the NLRB determines that an 
election should go forward, the details 
of the election must be settled expedi-
tiously so employees understand their 
rights as quickly as possible. 
Employers engage in all kinds of tac-
tics designed to scare employees out of 
supporting the union, from holding 
captive audience meetings, to issuing 
threats to specific employees. 
Unnecessary 
delays 
only 
provide 
more time for employers to undermine 
employees’ free choice. The choice of 
whether to join a union belongs to the 
employee. The PRO Act prevents em-
ployers from interfering with employ-
ees’ freedom of association. 
Moreover, 
the 
provisions 
of 
my 
amendment apply except under ex-
traordinary circumstances. 
When the NLRB created this rule ini-
tially in 2014, it found the details of the 
election, included in the notice, would 
often be resolved either in a pre-elec-
tion hearing or in an agreement be-
tween the union and the employer. 
If there is still an issue with the de-
tails of the election after the pre-elec-
tion hearing, and at the time the re-
gional director issues the direction of 
election, these would count as ‘‘ex-
traordinary circumstances.’’ 
Minimizing these delays preserves 
employee free choice by ensuring that 
their vote is untainted by employer in-
terference. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Americans continue to enjoy sub-
stantial economic mobility, despite 
Democrat claims that the decline in 
union membership has led to a perma-
nent upper class. Millions of poor 
Americans continue to move into the 
middle class and millions in the middle 
class are moving into the ranks of the 
wealthy, a group heavily criticized by 
the Democrats’ class-warfare politics. 
In inflation-adjusted 2018 dollars, 
from 1967 to 2018, the portion of U.S. 
households earning less than $35,000 a 
year fell by 25 percent. 
The portion earning between $35,000 
and $100,000, the middle class, fell by 22 
percent, from 53.8 percent to 41 percent 
of the country. But it did not fall be-
cause the middle class is worse off. 
The ranks of the poor and middle 
class are shrinking as the ranks of the 
wealthy and upper middle class are 
growing. From 1967 to 2018, the portion 
of U.S. households making more than 
$100,000 rose from 9 percent to more 
than 30 percent of the country. 
In 1967, nearly 25 percent of workers 
belonged to a union. In 2018, that num-
ber was just 10.5 percent. That means 
that while the union membership rate 
fell by more than half, the share of 
American households earning six-fig-
ure 
incomes—that 
is 
more 
than 
100,000—more than tripled. 
And, yes, contrary to another pop-
ular Democrat claim, throughout most 
of the country, these wage gains are 
outpacing the cost of living. 
No one can argue with this good 
news, yet, in an attempt to score polit-
ical points and bail out their allies in 
Big Labor, Democrats claim that the 
economy isn’t working for the poor and 
the middle class. 
As lawmakers, we can always do 
more to increase opportunities for peo-
ple to achieve the American Dream. 
But to suggest the economy isn’t work-
ing for average Americans, and the way 
to fix it is to expand forced unionism 
through coercive socialist schemes like 
H.R. 2474, is flatly untrue. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Unions created the middle class in 
our country. And all of the things that 
we enjoy, the safety that we have in 
our manufacturing, the 5-day work 
week, all the opportunities that women 
have, and people of color, all those 
came because unions stood up for these 
rights. 
My amendment strengthens the op-
portunity for people to choose to be-
come a union. 
I ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
Madam Chair, again, I really respect 
my colleague from California, and he 
knows that. 
However, it is not the unions who 
have created the middle class in this 
country. What has created the middle 
class in this country is freedom, the 
capitalistic society, the rule of law, our 
Judeo-Christian beliefs. We are the 
most prosperous, most successful coun-
try in the world, and it is because of 
those things. 
Did unions help at one time? Yes, 
they did. But they have outgrown their 
usefulness. We don’t need to force un-
ionism on the American people. We 
need to preserve their freedom and do 
everything that we can. That is what 
grows this country and makes it great. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. VARGAS). 
The amendment was agreed to.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 833, the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Chair, I rise to 
offer an amendment that protects 
union elections by ensuring timely no-
tices of union representation elections. 
This amendment overturns a recent 
National Labor Relations Board regu-
lation that undermines workers’ rights 
to organize in their workplace. 
I would like to begin by thanking 
Chairman SCOTT and his exceptional 
staff for working with me on this 
amendment, and for their tireless ef-
forts to strengthen unions and protect 
our country’s workers. 
The PRO Act strengthens workers’ 
rights to a free and fair union represen-
tation election. It does so by fostering 
transparency in the workplace about 
the right to organize and removing bar-
riers that were solely created to under-
cut labor organizing at the workplace. 
In 2014, Madam Chair, the Board up-
dated its union election procedures by 
streamlining the union representation 
process. The PRO Act codifies many of 
the 2004 requirements, including the 
timelines for pre- and post-election 
hearings. 
The 2014 Election Rule protected the 
integrity of the union representation 
process, which is critical, and it was 
upheld in every court where it was 
challenged. 
You see, corporate greed is what is 
driving this administration’s attack on 
workers. In December of 2019, the 
Board rescinded many parts of that 
2014 rule, burdening our workers with 
unnecessary delays and giving corpora-
tions more opportunity to stall work-
place rights and organizing with frivo-
lous litigation. 
The Republican Chairman of the 
Board, 
John 
Ring, 
pushed 
these 
changes without providing any notice 
to the public, ambushing workers with 
new procedures, solely designed to un-
dermine the rights for our folks, for 
our neighbors and workers to organize. 
One important change in that 2014 
Election Rule required corporations to 
post a notice when workers file a peti-
tion for an election. This notice is crit-
ical to informing workers about the de-
tails of the petition, and their rights, 
while the board processes their peti-
tion. 
Notably, the 2014 rule required cor-
porations to post this notice within 
two business days, 2 business days after 
the board issues notice of a pre-elec-
tion hearing. This requirement was 
fair, and it was just. 
However, once again, the agents of 
corporate greed are trying to cheat us 
out of our rights. Chairman Ring and 
the other Republican members of the 
board nearly tripled the amount of 
time corporations have to post that no-
tice to 5 days after being notified about 
the pre-election hearing. This delay en-
ables the corporations to take advan-
tage of a crucial time period where 
workers may not know their rights or 
the details of the board process gov-
erning their petition for a fair election. 
We should be doing all we can do, 
Madam Chair, to ensure workers’ col-
lective bargaining rights are protected. 
Enough of the antiworker mentality 
driven by those who want to avoid pay-
ing fair wages and offering strong 
workplace protections for our neigh-
bors. 
This amendment restores fairness 
and 
democracy 
into 
our 
process, 
Madam Chair, and it brings back the 
2014 election rule by requiring the cor-
porations to post the notice of petition 
for election within 2 days after the 
board notifies the corporations and the 
union about the pre-election hearing. 
It is pretty simple. In doing so, this 
amendment will foster more trans-
parency, and will prevent unnecessary 
delays that undermine the right to or-
ganize in our country. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, this amendment imposes yet an-
other unnecessary and harmful require-
ment on employers as they prepare for 
a union election; and this new mandate 
will be imposed on business owners who 
will have already lost numerous em-
ployer rights because of other provi-
sions in the PRO Act. 
During the Obama administration, 
the National Labor Relations Board 
drastically changed its union election 
procedures, adding dozens of new re-
quirements and restrictions on employ-
ers in an effort to short-circuit the 
union election process and increase 
union membership. 
On top of this, the PRO Act makes 
over 50 changes to existing labor law, 
adding a litany of burdensome con-
straints that will harm employers, par-
ticularly small employers who do not 
have infinite time and resources to re-
spond to a union organizing drive. 
Unions often begin organizing cam-
paigns weeks, or even months before 
employers are made aware; creating a 
scenario in which workers are only 
hearing one side of the issue prior to a 
union election. 
When an election petition is filed, 
employers have only a few days to pre-
pare their case, depriving them of their 
rights to due process and all parties of 
their right to a fair and robust election 
process. This amendment would further 
burden employers and tilt the playing 
field in favor of union bosses. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Look, unnecessary delays in union 
representation elections provide cor-
porations with more time to wage anti- 
union campaigns using illegal and legal 
tactics. That is why folks are going to 
be against this. 
When workers file a petition for 
union representation elections, cor-
porations must properly notify them of 
their rights under the law. It is pretty 
clear. It is pretty transparent, and al-
lows, again, information to get to 
workers, our neighbors that are there 
that want to organize for better wages, 
for protection at the workplace. 
I urge my colleagues to please vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this amendment. 
Madam Chair, I yield the balance of 
my time to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. FRANKEL). 
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Chair, be-
cause of the force of labor unions, 
American workers have higher wages 
and workplaces that are fairer and 
safer. And we can thank labor unions 
for things like employee health cov-
erage, the end of child labor, and a 40- 
hour work week. 
To counter the power of collective 
bargaining, some in corporate America 
have struck back by harassing union 
organizers, denying information to em-
ployees, and using independent con-
tractors. 
That is why I am voting for the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act of 
2019, to defend and secure our labor 
unions, the champions of the American 
workers. I urge support of this amend-
ment and the bill. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Democrats insist that the PRO Act 
expands workers’ rights. But, in re-
ality, this bill coerces workers and un-
dermines their rights in order to in-
crease the wealth and power of union 
bosses. Unions have a long and sordid 
history of harassing and intimidating 
workers into supporting them, and this 
bill makes it worse. 
For example, in 2013, Ms. Marlene 
Felter, a medical records coder in Cali-
fornia, testified that union organizers 
‘‘were calling them on 
their 
cell 
phones, coming to their homes, stalk-
ing them, harassing them . . . to con-
vince them to sign union cards.’’ 
In 2017, one Minnesota personal care 
attendant, who chose not to provide 
her full name, described her experience 
with an SEIU union organizer for a 
Forbes.com piece: ‘‘The woman identi-
fied herself as a SEIU representative,

and asked if they could talk for a few 
minutes. Holly said she didn’t have 
time right now, but the woman per-
sisted, placing herself between Holly 
and the front of the door and repeat-
edly asking her how she intended to 
vote in the upcoming union election. 
‘‘Holly became frightened; arms full 
of groceries, she could hear her patient 
becoming agitated and distressed in-
side, and here was this strange woman 
blocking her way and demanding to 
know how she would ‘vote.’ Holly fi-
nally extricated herself and entered her 
home, slamming the door behind her. 
But that wasn’t the end of things. Over 
the next weeks and months, she re-
ceived multiple calls and visits from 
the union.’’ 
b 1915 
The author of the piece asked Holly 
how she would characterize the nature 
of these calls and visits. ‘‘Stalking, ab-
solutely,’’ said Holly. ‘‘They wouldn’t 
leave me alone.’’ 
Richard Trumka, president of the 
AFL–CIO, testified before our com-
mittee in May 2019 that unions need 
workers’ personal information because 
‘‘it is essential in order to be able to 
communicate with them. . . . You may 
have to meet with them at a grocery 
store, anyplace else where you can get 
them. The most efficient place and the 
best place for them to be able to talk is 
in their home setting, at their home, so 
that you can have a real conversation 
with them.’’ 
The PRO Act’s own supporters admit 
unions will harass workers at their own 
homes, at work, and at the grocery 
store, yet Democrats claim this bill ex-
pands and protects workers’ rights. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this amendment and ‘‘no’’ on the un-
derlying bill. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 15 OFFERED BY MRS. LAWRENCE 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 15 printed 
in part B of House Report 116–392. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Chair, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
On page 19, line 15, strike ‘‘and’’. 
On page 19, after line 15, insert the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(B) regional directors shall schedule elec-
tions for the earliest date practicable, but 
not later than the 20th business day after the 
direction of election; and’’. 
On page 19, line 16, strike ‘‘(B)’’ and insert 
‘‘(C)’’. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 833, the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Chair, I 
thank Chairman SCOTT and the com-
mittee for working so hard to bring 
this historic legislation to the floor. 
As Members may know, my district, 
which includes the city of Detroit, was 
built on the backs of unions and stand-
ing up for worker rights. Thanks to our 
unions, our communities receive re-
spectful benefits, fair pay, and great 
representation. However—this comes 
as no surprise—this administration has 
weakened workers’ rights and labor au-
thority. 
The PRO Act and my amendment 
look to shed some light on these recent 
attacks 
by 
strengthening 
workers’ 
rights to a free and fair union represen-
tation election. My amendment accom-
plishes this by preventing unnecessary 
delays between the filing of a petition 
and the holding of an election. When 
such delays ensue, this gives employers 
the opportunity to launch antiunion 
campaigns designed to erode union sup-
port. 
Madam Chair, we need to protect 
workers’ rights to a timely election, 
not dismiss it. My amendment does 
just that, as it looks to eliminate an 
unnecessary delay relating to union 
elections recently imposed by the 
NLRB. This amendment addresses the 
mandatory 20-day wait period between 
the filing of the petition and holding 
the election. There has been no jus-
tification for establishing this wait pe-
riod. 
In 2014, under the Obama administra-
tion, the NLRB updated its union elec-
tion processes by enacting reasonable 
deadlines and preventing employers 
from stalling elections through frivo-
lous litigation. The PRO Act codifies 
many of these requirements, including 
the timelines for pre- and post-election 
hearings. 
One of the most notable changes in 
the 2014 election rule was that once the 
NLRB regional director concludes that 
an election should happen, the regional 
director must schedule the election for 
the 
earliest 
date 
practicable. 
The 
NLRB changed this by requiring re-
gional directors to impose a random 20- 
day waiting period. 
My amendment eliminates this arbi-
trary waiting period and returns to the 
requirement that an election shall be 
scheduled as soon as practicable, unless 
extraordinary circumstances apply. 
Workers who request a union rep-
resentation election should not be im-
peded in their right to vote with frivo-
lous delays. Democracy in the work-
place should be a right, not a fight. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from North Carolina is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, again, I have respect for the gen-
tlewoman on this, but I have to re-
spectfully 
oppose 
this 
amendment, 
which is intended to tilt the playing 
field even further against workers and 
in favor of union bosses, more so than 
the underlying bill already does. 
By requiring union elections to be 
held as early as practicable, union 
bosses will have an unfair advantage 
because it deprives workers of adequate 
opportunity to hear from their em-
ployer about potential risks of union-
ization. 
The PRO Act codifies the Obama 
NLRB’s ambush election rule, which 
shortened the time before a union elec-
tion takes place from a median of 38 
days to as few as 11 days. This amend-
ment would further reduce that time, 
increasing union bosses’ advantage. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Chair, un-
necessary delays only serve one pur-
pose, and that is to enable antiunion 
employers to have more time to expose 
employees to their campaign against 
the union. 
I have so much respect for my col-
league on the other side, but to say 
that we should not protect our workers 
because of a union boss? They are not 
bosses. They are elected by the mem-
bership. 
We should be promoting employee 
free choice by ensuring that their vote 
is untainted by an employer delay or 
interference. Once the NLRB deter-
mines that an election should go for-
ward, it should happen as soon as pos-
sible. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on my amend-
ment and this bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
My colleague and I agree that work-
ers should be protected. There is abso-
lutely no disagreement between Demo-
crats and Republicans on that, but we 
believe that the existing law is suffi-
cient both for protecting the right to 
organize as well as protecting workers. 
Democrats bemoan attacks on the 
right to organize, but the right to orga-
nize has not changed in more than 70 
years. Unions have simply abandoned 
their stated purpose of organizing 
workers and are trying to take a short-
cut through the Congress. 
NLRB data shows that the number of 
representation petitions filed by unions 
with the NLRB fell from 5,000 in 1997 to 
fewer than 1,600 in fiscal year 2018, the 
fewest in over 75 years. Let me repeat 
that. The number of representation pe-
titions filed by unions with the NLRB 
fell from 5,000 in 1997 to fewer than 
1,600 in fiscal year 2018, the fewest in 
over 75 years. 
In fiscal year 2018, there were more 
than 110 million private-sector employ-
ees available for organizing under the 
National Labor Relations Act, but the 
number of employees who actually pe-
titioned for union representation was 
just 73,000. That means that unions 
sought to represent less than one one- 
tenth of 1 percent of potential new

members in this country in fiscal year 
2018, 
yet 
Democrats 
blame 
falling 
unionization on conservatives. 
This lack of attention to organizing 
is reflected in unions’ financial prior-
ities, as well, and not just by UAW 
leaders spending workers’ dues on cigar 
parties and golf. The AFL–CIO’s 2018– 
2019 budget dedicated less than one- 
tenth of the budget to organizing ef-
forts. The largest portion of the budg-
et, more than 35 percent, was dedicated 
to political activities. 
In addition to spending massive sums 
on political activities, unions also gen-
erously spent workers’ dues, money in-
tended for collective bargaining rep-
resentation, 
to 
advance 
political 
causes. From 2010 through 2018, unions 
sent more than $1.6 billion in union 
dues to hundreds of leftwing advocacy 
organizations, including Planned Par-
enthood, the Progressive Democrats of 
America, and the Center for American 
Progress. 
Much of this spending came amidst a 
Presidential cycle in which more than 
40 percent of union households voted 
for the Republican Donald J. Trump for 
President, yet Democrats blame con-
servatives for plummeting union mem-
bership. That is not the problem. 
The Acting CHAIR. The time of the 
gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Chair, I 
want to be clear that we should be pro-
moting employee free choice. This is 
not about the election process. 
When we are standing here on the 
floor, we are talking about the Amer-
ican people and their rights. I stand 
here representing the city of Detroit, 
the city that put the country on wheels 
by strong union workers. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this amend-
ment and a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. LAW-
RENCE). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 16 OFFERED BY MR. ROUDA 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 16 printed 
in part B of House Report 116–392. 
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Chair, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Redesignate section 5 as section 6. 
After section 4, insert the following: 
SEC. 5. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION. 
The amendments made by this Act shall 
not be construed to affect the jurisdictional 
standards of the National Labor Relations 
Board, including any standards that measure 
the size of a business with respect to reve-
nues, that are used to determine whether an 
industry is affecting commerce for purposes 
of determining coverage under the National 
Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 833, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. ROUDA) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
As a businessman, I know firsthand 
the power of small businesses as a driv-
er of economic growth, not just for the 
owners but for the 60 million small 
business 
employees 
in 
the 
United 
States. 
While the underlying bill makes the 
playing field fairer for American work-
ers, my amendment clarifies that the 
National Labor Relations Board juris-
dictional standards for small busi-
nesses 
remain 
consistent, 
ensuring 
small businesses have the stability 
they need to develop long-term busi-
ness plans. 
The NLRB uses businesses’ gross an-
nual volume to determine whether a 
company is subject to its standards, 
with different thresholds for different 
types of businesses. My amendment en-
sures 
existing 
thresholds 
do 
not 
change. 
Madam Chair, we cannot keep shift-
ing the goalposts for millions of Ameri-
cans. Small businesses need stability 
to strategize and consistency to create 
jobs. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to support small businesses 
across America and adopt this amend-
ment. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman 
from North Carolina is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
This amendment changes nothing 
about the underlying bill and the pain 
it will inflict on American workers and 
businesses. It is simply another weak 
attempt to pay lip service to address 
one of the many glaring flaws in the 
PRO Act. 
The National Labor Relations Act, 
NLRA, already applies to nearly every 
business in the country, and the PRO 
Act’s harmful provisions will also. This 
amendment does nothing to protect 
small business entrepreneurs and inde-
pendent contractors. 
If adopted, small businesses will still 
be saddled with new costs and man-
dates. They will still be forced to turn 
their employees’ private information 
over to union organizers. They will 
still be subject to completely unre-
stricted union harassment even if they 
aren’t the subject of a union organizing 
campaign. They will still have their 
rights throughout that process com-
pletely obliterated. 
Independent contractors will still be 
at risk of being classified as employees 
under the bill’s onerous ABC test. The 
NLRA’s existing jurisdictional stand-
ards do not change that reality. The 
ABC test is not about whether inde-
pendent contractors are businesses cov-
ered by the NLRA but, rather, whether 
they are employees covered by the act. 
This amendment does nothing to 
change the fact that millions of inde-
pendent contractors will be classified 
as employees against their will and, as 
a result, will have their livelihoods put 
at risk by socialist Democrats in Wash-
ington. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
b 1930 
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of the 
House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Chair, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank 
him for his leadership in bringing this 
important amendment to the floor, and 
I rise in support of it. It clarifies that 
nothing in this act shall be construed 
to affect the jurisdictional standards of 
the National Labor Relations Board 
with respect to small businesses. I 
thank the gentleman, Mr. ROUDA, for 
his leadership in that regard. I urge 
passage of the amendment. 
Madam Chair, I proudly rise on this 
historic day as the Democratic House 
takes bold action to restore funda-
mental fairness to America’s workers 
by passing the Protecting the Right to 
Organize Act, the PRO Act. 
Madam Chair, I salute our distin-
guished chairman, BOBBY SCOTT, for his 
lifetime of leadership to tilt back the 
playing field to the side of the Amer-
ican worker. I thank the members of 
the Education and Labor Committee 
and all who have worked to make this 
legislation go over the finish line. 
Some people always say to us: Your 
Caucus is so very diverse. What unifies 
them? 
I say it is diverse in every way. Sixty 
percent of our Caucus are women, peo-
ple of color, LGBTQ. We have genera-
tional differences, geographical, gen-
der, gender identity, ethnicity, opin-
ion—the beautiful diversity of opinion. 
But what does unify us is our com-
mitment to America’s working fami-
lies, and that is what brings us to the 
floor today. It is a commitment to sa-
lute working families, to raise pay-
checks, and to do so by enabling work-
ers to bargain collectively. 
I always say that the middle class is 
the backbone of America’s democracy. 
The middle class has a union label on 
it. 
So many things that have come into 
the workforce, whether it is the 40- 
hour workweek, safer working condi-
tions, fair pay for family leave, collec-
tive bargaining for secure retirement— 
the list goes on and on—the labor 
unions have been responsible for that. 
Yesterday, several Members and I 
were honored to meet with Jennifer 
Womack, a worker who had been pre-
vented from joining a union, and I 
want to share her story with my col-
leagues. 
She told us about the unfair working 
conditions that she has faced: how she

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H919 
February 6, 2020 
was illegally denied pay after missing 
work to undergo serious surgery, even 
after spending her entire recovery pe-
riod on the phone with the benefits de-
partment to help her pay her bills; how 
one of her managers engaged in offen-
sive and bigoted behavior but was 
never disciplined, in fact, was given a 
company award. 
When Jennifer and her coworkers 
tried to form a union to improve work-
ing conditions, she was subjected to 
humiliating retaliation and forced to 
attend antiunion trainings designed to 
scare her off. 
She told us: ‘‘I believe that the deci-
sion of whether to join a union should 
be up to me and other workers without 
having to face threats and retaliation. 
And Democrats agree. 
Sadly, her story is shared every day 
by millions of Americans who face a 
grim reality of reprisal, of retaliation, 
of denial of their rights to join or try-
ing to join a union. 
Democrats offered our Better Deal 
for Workers, pledging to tilt the play-
ing field, with Mr. Chairman so much 
in the lead, to tilt the playing field 
back to the side of workers. 
Since day one, our majority has 
worked to build an economy that 
works for workers’ interests, not the 
special interests: passing the $15 min-
imum wage, securing paycheck fairness 
for women. 
Madam Chair, I thank the unions for 
their leadership in our country for 
equal pay for equal work. No institu-
tion has done more in that regard. We 
are trying to make that the case for all 
workers that you would have equal pay 
for equal work. 
We are also protecting the pensions 
of millions and lowering healthcare 
costs and increasing paychecks, to 
name a few. 
Today, we are building on that 
progress by passing the cornerstone of 
our pro-worker agenda, the PRO Act. 
With this legislation, Democrats are 
holding companies that violate work-
ers’ 
rights 
accountable. 
We 
are 
strengthening workers’ sacred collec-
tive bargaining rights, and we are pro-
tecting workers’ access to fair union 
elections. 
The PRO Act secures justice for 
workers and advances progress for all. 
As Richard Trumka, the President of 
the AFL–CIO, which represents 12.5 
million Americans and 55 unions, testi-
fied last year: ‘‘A happier, healthier, 
more upwardly mobile workforce is 
good for our economy as consumers 
have additional money to spend. Local 
tax revenues increase, and education 
funding 
is 
bolstered. 
Inequality 
shrinks. It is a virtuous cycle. 
‘‘The union movement and all work-
ing people are hungry for pro-worker 
reforms to our existing labor laws. . . . 
It is time for our laws to catch up. It is 
time to make the PRO Act the law of 
the land.’’ 
I quite agree. 
Democrats call on Republicans to 
join us to pass the PRO Act and to re-
balance the scales toward workers. 
I always say, whether it is an elec-
tion or a debate or a negotiation: Who 
has the leverage? 
Well, right now there is too much le-
verage used against America’s workers, 
and that is harmful to America’s work-
ing families. 
We want to again tilt that playing 
field back into the direction of workers 
so their leverage is increased, so their 
opportunities are improved, and then 
we can move closer to ending the in-
equality, the disparity in income in our 
country. 
Madam Chair, I urge our colleagues 
to vote ‘‘aye’’ on this important PRO 
Act. 
Madam Chair, I commend the chair-
man, the distinguished chairman, for 
his leadership again, Mr. SCOTT, and 
members of his committee. 
And I again thank Mr. ROUDA for his 
amendment that clarifies that nothing 
in this act shall be construed to affect 
the jurisdictional standards of the 
NLRB with respect to small businesses. 
I thank the gentleman, Mr. ROUDA, for 
his leadership. 
Madam Chair, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote 
on both the underlying bill and this 
amendment. 
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Chair, once 
again, I reiterate the previous com-
ments that this bill and the supporting 
amendments deserve the bipartisan 
support that we have already seen. I 
encourage Members across the aisle to 
reconsider those ideas and support the 
passage of this bill. 
Madam Chair, if the gentlewoman is 
ready to close, I am as well, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I enter into the RECORD
the 
Statement of Administration Policy on 
H.R. 2474. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 2474—PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE 
ACT—REP. SCOTT, D–VA, AND 218 COSPONSORS 
The Administration opposes H.R. 2474, the 
Protecting the Right to Organize Act. The 
Administration supports the rights of work-
ers to freely join a union. In fact, under 
President Trump, on average over 250,000 
more Americans are members of a private- 
sector union than under President Obama. 
This growth has been driven, in part, by the 
tremendous strength of the Trump economy. 
The Administration is willing to work with 
Congress to strengthen protections for union 
members. Unfortunately, H.R. 2474 contains 
provisions that would kill jobs, violate work-
ers’ privacy, restrict freedom of association, 
and roll back the Administration’s success-
ful deregulatory agenda. 
H.R. 2474 would hurt workers in several 
ways. First, the bill would kill jobs and de-
stroy the gig economy. It appears to cut and 
paste the core provisions of California’s con-
troversial AB 5, which severely restricts self- 
employment. AB 5 is actively threatening 
the existence of both the franchise business 
sector and the gig economy in California. It 
would be a serious mistake for Congress to 
impose this flawed job-killing policy on the 
entire country. Additionally, H.R. 2474’s job- 
killing effects could be even greater, as it 
would empower third-party arbitrators to 
impose collective bargaining agreements. In-
voluntary contracts that do not work for 
employees or their employers could force 
layoffs or even bankruptcies—ultimately, 
harming workers. 
Second, H.R. 2474 would violate workers’ 
privacy. It would require companies to give 
union organizers their employees’ home ad-
dresses, personal phone numbers, and per-
sonal e-mail addresses, and it also would 
allow unions to bypass secret-ballot elec-
tions. Secret ballots protect workers from 
both employer and union coercion, and the 
Administration 
believes 
voting 
privacy 
should be protected. 
Third, H.R. 2474 would also restrict work-
ers’ freedom of association. It abolishes 
State right-to-work laws, and would thereby 
make union dues compulsory nationwide. 
Additionally, the bill would legalize ‘‘sec-
ondary boycotts,’’ which Congress previously 
banned because they pressure workers to 
join a particular union. And it would rush 
union elections, depriving employees of time 
to make a considered choice. The Adminis-
tration is willing to discuss legislation clari-
fying that unions do not need to represent 
workers who do not pay dues. But it believes 
that workers’ decisions to join and support a 
union should be the product of choice, not 
compulsion. 
Finally, by imposing unnecessary and cost-
ly burdens on American businesses, this bill 
would take the country in precisely the op-
posite direction from the President’s suc-
cessful deregulatory agenda, which has pro-
duced rising blue-collar wages and record low 
unemployment. For example, by expansively 
defining joint employer liability, the bill 
would discourage investment and job cre-
ation and reduce opportunities for workers. 
If H.R. 2474 were presented to the President 
in its current form, his advisors would rec-
ommend that he veto it. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I would like to quote from a part 
of the Statement of Administration 
Policy. 
‘‘The administration opposes H.R. 
2474, the Protecting the Right to Orga-
nize Act. The administration supports 
the rights of workers to freely join a 
union. In fact, under President Trump, 
on average, over 250,000 more Ameri-
cans are members of a private-sector 
union than under President Obama. 
This growth has been driven, in part, 
by the tremendous strength of the 
Trump economy. The administration is 
willing to work with Congress to 
strengthen protections for union mem-
bers. Unfortunately, H.R. 2474 contains 
provisions that would kill jobs, violate 
workers’ privacy, restrict freedom of 
association, and roll back the adminis-
tration’s successful deregulatory agen-
da.’’ 
‘‘Finally, by imposing unnecessary 
and costly burdens on American busi-
nesses, this bill would take the country 
in precisely the opposite direction from 
the President’s successful deregulatory 
agenda, which has produced rising 
blue-collar wages and record low unem-
ployment.’’ 
Madam Chair, I oppose this amend-
ment, I oppose the underlying bill. We 
need to keep this economy doing very 
well, and we need not to support this 
piece of legislation which is unfair to 
American workers, unfair to busi-
nesses, unfair to the American tax-
payers. 
Madam Chair, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
the amendment and a ‘‘no’’ vote on the

So the amendment was agreed to. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. RASKIN). 
There being no further amendments, 
under the rule, the Committee rises. 
Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. PIN-
GREE) having assumed the chair, Mr. 
RASKIN, Acting Chair of the Committee 
of the Whole House on the state of the 
Union, reported that that Committee, 
having had under consideration the bill 
(H.R. 2474) to amend the National 
Labor Relations Act, the Labor Man-
agement Relations Act, 1947, and the 
Labor-Management Reporting and Dis-
closure Act of 1959, and for other pur-
poses, and, pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 833, he reported the bill, as amend-
ed by that resolution, back to the 
House with sundry further amend-
ments adopted in the Committee of the 
Whole. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered. 
Is a separate vote demanded on any 
further amendment reported from the 
Committee of the Whole? If not, the 
Chair will put them en gros. 
The amendments were agreed to. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the engrossment and 
third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. 
Madam Speaker, I have a motion to re-
commit at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman opposed to the bill? 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. 
Madam Speaker, I am in its current 
form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma moves to re-
commit the bill H.R. 2474 to the Committee 
on Education and Labor with instructions to 
report the same back to the House forthwith, 
with the following amendment: 
Page 15, line 21, strike the closed quotation 
marks and the second period. 
Page 15, after line 21, insert the following: 
‘‘(j) A labor organization shall not commu-
nicate with an employee regarding joining or 
supporting the labor organization if the em-
ployee is not authorized to work in the 
United States.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Oklahoma is recognized for 5 minutes 
in support of his motion. 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. 
Madam Speaker, this motion is the 
final opportunity to amend the legisla-
tion and would do so without any delay 
in passage. 
This amendment ensures that labor 
unions are not using illegal foreign 
labor to expand their region to the 
American workplaces and collect more 
union dues. 
Under current law, an employee can 
sign a union authorization card to 
count toward the showing of interest in 
union elections regardless of whether 
that worker is authorized to work in 
the United States. Illegal immigrants 
should not be working at American 
companies, let alone used by labor 
unions to organize workplaces. 
This motion to recommit ensures 
that unions cannot communicate with 
employees for organizing purposes if 
the employee is not legally authorized 
to work in the United States. 
Because of the success I have worked 
for in life, not many people know that 
my life began very differently. 
My family was dependant on food 
stamps for most of my youth. My 
stepdad never worked, and my siblings 
and I paid the price for it. 
I knew from a young age that I would 
not let that be my life. From the mo-
ment I could start working, I did what-
ever it took to earn financial security: 
hog farming, welding, computer pro-
gramming, and the list goes on. 
If it weren’t for the McDonald’s 
Franchisee program, I wouldn’t be here 
today. After 11 years working in the 
restaurants, I was able to work my way 
into the franchisee program and pur-
chase my first franchise location, then 
build a successful company with over 
20 locations; a program that allowed a 
person that came from a place like I 
did to achieve the American Dream. 
I have lived a true American story. 
And my mission in life is to help every 
child who grew up like me, wondering 
where their next meal would come 
from, unsure if their lights would be on 
when they got home from school; I 
want those kids to know that our coun-
try is a place of opportunity and a 
place of hope for those who will work 
for it. 
We shouldn’t be here discussing this 
bill today. It is not worthy of this 
Chamber. But since we are, I must do 
everything I can to show my dis-
approval in the strongest terms. 
The change we are proposing here is 
simple. We are asking that unions be 
barred from contacting individuals who 
are not eligible to work in this coun-
try. 
If an employer cannot hire someone 
in our country illegally, a union should 
not be allowed to organize those indi-
viduals. Believe it or not, this is not 
currently outlawed. 
If my colleagues insist on moving 
forward with legislation that empowers 
union bosses and strips independence 
from our workers, they should not do it 
in a way that encourages illegal immi-
gration. 
This motion to recommit would 
make the PRO Act pro-American work-
er, rather than just pro-union bosses.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H926 
February 6, 2020 
I have been doing my research a long 
time. I spent 34 years as a business 
owner before coming to Congress. I 
have dealt with union issues for longer 
than some of my colleagues have been 
alive. 
AFL–CIO President Richard Trumka, 
who will financially benefit from the 
passage of this bill, said: 
Those who will oppose, delay, or derail this 
legislation, do not ask us for a single dollar 
or a door knock. We won’t be coming. 
Well, I am standing here today to let 
Mr. Trumka know that I proudly op-
pose this legislation. 
One of the biggest glaring failures of 
this legislation is taking away em-
ployee choice; effectively repealing 
right-to-work laws all across this coun-
try, like in my home State, where we 
choose to empower employers and em-
ployees alike. 
Decades of legal precedent will be 
pushed aside. Where workers have pre-
viously had the freedom to choose 
whether or not to pay fees and join a 
union, they will now be forced to pay 
membership fees or lose their job. This 
will put immeasurable power in the 
hands of union bosses. 
Privacy provisions—that have been 
in place for decades—barring unions 
from accessing private information 
about employees, will be eradicated 
under this bill. You heard that right. 
Unions will be able to access employ-
ees’ private information, even those 
that are not members of the union. 
They can use that information for any-
thing; sell it to the highest bidder, all 
without the knowledge or the consent 
of the individuals. 
The same franchises that gave me 
the opportunity to achieve the Amer-
ican Dream are under attack with this 
legislation. Over 750,000 franchise loca-
tions that employ more than 8 million 
people are at risk because of the joint 
employer provisions in the bill. 
The expanded joint employer stand-
ard has cost franchise businesses $33.3 
billion per year; resulting in 376,000 
lost job opportunities and 93 percent 
more lawsuits. 
Many of the ideas in this bill have al-
ready been rejected in the court system 
and are currently opposed by a bipar-
tisan coalition in Congress. 
I urge my friends across the aisle to 
support the motion to recommit on be-
half of the American worker and their 
right to choose. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the mo-
tion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, the PRO Act is about tack-
ling income inequality and remedying 
laws that have failed to protect work-
ers’ rights. 
The PRO Act expressly says it shall 
not be construed to amend any laws re-
garding hiring undocumented workers. 
It also prevents employers from being 
able to bust a union organizing drive 
simply by firing undocumented work-
ers they had hired previously. 
The real-world effect of this MTR is 
to create a perverse incentive to go 
ahead and hire undocumented workers, 
because they could never receive infor-
mation from a union about organizing. 
Moreover, carving out undocumented 
workers from organizing deters all 
workers from exercising their rights. 
Employees who witness employers vio-
lating labor laws without repercussions 
will be afraid to rely on the National 
Labor Relations Act. 
Finally, our immigration laws re-
quire employers to find out about 
whether workers are documented or 
not. There is no provision in our laws 
that allow unions to find that out. 
This MTR is truly bad policy. It will 
encourage more hiring of undocu-
mented workers; exactly the opposite 
of what the authors intend. But the 
main thing is it will undermine the 
freedom to form unions and bargain 
collectively for all workers. 
Republicans offered this MTR to 
score political points. But we are fo-
cused on rebuilding the American mid-
dle class. 
I have spent most of my career help-
ing workers form unions and bargain 
collectively. The power of workers to 
unite and demand fair wages, better 
benefits, and safer working conditions 
is truly inspiring, and it is essential for 
working families simply trying to get 
by. 
Right now, corporate profits are sky-
rocketing, 
while 
the 
share 
of 
healthcare costs paid by employers is 
falling. Worker productivity is at a 
peak, yet wages are stagnant. The gap 
between the rich and poor is the high-
est ever recorded. 
One of the main causes of these prob-
lems is declining union membership, 
which is at its lowest point in decades. 
The PRO Act is about reversing these 
trends so workers can enjoy their fair 
share in the economy that they help 
create. 
Recent studies have shown that in 
cities 
where 
union 
membership 
is 
strong, children in low-income families 
go on to ascend to higher income levels 
than their parents. Isn’t that what 
every parent wants? 
Creating a pathway to a better life, 
that is the American Dream, and that 
is the power of a union. 
Fifty-eight million Americans say 
they would join a union if given the op-
portunity; 58 million, 48 percent of non-
union workers. 
Just think of the impact we could 
have simply by making it easier for 
Americans to exercise the rights they 
already supposedly have under the law; 
rights that have been undermined sys-
tematically by special interests that 
want to keep the economy working for 
the very wealthiest, at the expense of 
the vast majority of Americans. 
The PRO Act is about that most 
American of ideals, freedom. All we are 
doing today is allowing workers to de-
cide on their own, free of harassment 
and intimidation, whether or not they 
wish to form a union and bargain col-
lectively, and to access their other 
rights under the NLRA. 
When we pass the PRO Act today, we 
say loud and clear that we are not on 
the side of special interests. We stand 
proudly on the side of working fami-
lies. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no’’ on this motion to recommit, and 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the PRO Act. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), the 
distinguished chairman of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, this is the last step before we 
can pass the PRO Act. We know that 
union members make higher salaries, 
get better benefits, work in safer work-
places. 
Nonunion 
members 
benefit 
from the high salaries. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
RECORDED VOTE 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. 
Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded 
vote. 
A recorded vote was ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5- 
minute vote on the motion to recom-
mit will be followed by 5-minute votes 
on: 
Passage of H.R. 2474, if ordered; and 
Agreeing to H. Res. 826.

MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING 
REPRESENTATIVE 
FORTNEY 
‘‘PETE’’ STARK 
(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, we rise to 
honor the legacy of Representative 
Fortney ‘‘Pete’’ Stark, who passed 
away on January 24. 
With his passing, the country, Cali-
fornia, and the East Bay community 
lost a champion of the people and a 
leader of great courage and compassion 
who served in the House of Representa-
tives for 40 years. 
Those of us who had the honor of 
serving with Pete in our California 
congressional delegation have all lost a 
dear friend. 
Pete was a relentless champion for 
universal 
healthcare. 
He 
had 
an 
unrivaled understanding of the chal-
lenges of America’s health system. 
Whether it was fighting for COBRA 
to help working families maintain 
their coverage during times of finan-
cial insecurity or taking a leading role 
in writing the Affordable Care Act, 
Pete always seized opportunities to ex-
pand 
access 
to 
quality, 
affordable 
healthcare for all. 
Pete will rightly be remembered and 
celebrated for his commitment to 
fighting for those in need, particularly 
America’s children. 
He fought relentlessly to improve our 
children’s access to quality education, 
to protect clean air for them to breathe 
and clean water for them to drink, and 
to leave them a more peaceful world. 
Pete leaves behind a legacy that will 
inspire 
generations 
of 
future 
law-
makers, and he leaves behind a wonder-
ful family, whom he adored, who are 
with us tonight. 
May it give comfort to his wife, 
Deborah; his children, Jeffrey, Bea-
trice, Thekla, Sarah, Fish, also known

as Fortney, Hannah, and Andrew; his 
eight grandchildren; two great-grand-
children; and the entire Stark family 
that so many mourn their loss and are 
praying for them at this sad time. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all Members and 
guests in the gallery to rise for a mo-
ment of silence. 
f 
NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS WEEK 
(Mr. RUSH asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of National Gun Violence Sur-
vivors Week. 
At a field hearing in my district last 
November, we heard from Pastor Bren-
da Mitchell, who lost both her brother 
and a son to gun violence. After her 
son’s death, Pastor Mitchell experi-
enced hypertension, and the trauma 
forced her to leave a successful career 
behind. 
According to the Gun Violence Ar-
chive, which tracks gun violence sta-
tistics, there have been 862 deaths in 
my district since 2013, 862 families who 
have experienced the trauma of losing 
a loved one to gun violence. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues in the Senate to stand up to 
the empty minds, the empty hearts, 
and the empty suits of the gun lobby 
and send H.R. 8 to the President’s desk. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DEPUTY 
RICHARD WHITTEN 
(Mr. BABIN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart that I rise today to honor 
the life and legacy of Liberty County 
Sheriff’s Deputy Richard Whitten, who 
succumbed to complications of a gun-
shot wound. 
On May 29, 2019, Deputy Whitten was 
off duty when he heard a ‘‘shots fired’’ 
call over the dispatch. Responding 
without hesitation, he drove to the 
scene. After a brief pursuit, Deputy 
Whitten was shot in the neck by the 
murder suspect, paralyzing him in-
stantly. 
After visiting with him and his wife, 
Kami, in the hospital last July, he told 
me that he would do it all over again 
to protect his community and his citi-
zens. 
On February 3, 2020, Deputy Whitten 
suffered a complication while under-
going physical therapy and passed 
away. He served with the Liberty 
County Sheriff’s Office for 4 years, and 
he will be greatly missed. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank a 
real hero, Deputy Richard Whitten, for 
his faithful service. 
Thank you.

for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, 
we lost a devoted public servant with 
the recent passing of our dear friend, 
Representative Pete Stark. 
As a student at Mills College during 
the early 1970s, I was president of the 
Black Student Union, and Pete helped 
me with many of my organizing efforts. 
He was also the very first Member of 
Congress I voted for. 
Pete served for 40 years as a pas-
sionate and courageous public servant 
who made it his goal to advocate for 
those most in need. 
Through working alongside him in 
Congress, I came to admire his willing-
ness to speak out for what he believed 
to be right, even when it meant chal-
lenging those in power. 
Pete made a difference in the lives of 
millions of people across the country. 
His substantial and lasting influence 
on health policy reflected his deeply 
held values of compassionate legis-
lating and courageous advocacy. 
Pete believed it was his role to fight 
for the people’s interests, not for spe-
cial interests. He saw his role as one of 
advocacy for the underserved people of 
his district and throughout the coun-
try. 
Pete never failed to speak up when it 
came time to champion a more com-
passionate approach to governance. He 
truly spoke truth to power. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
Pete’s wife, Deborah, his children, his 
family, and his loved ones. 
May we carry his baton forward in 
our work for a more just world, a more 
compassionate world, and may he rest 
in peace.

RECOGNIZING KEVIN ‘‘CATFISH’’ 
JACKSON 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Mr. Kevin 
‘‘Catfish’’ Jackson, who was honored at 
this year’s Opportunity Award Gala at 
the Savannah Technical College Foun-
dation for his business acumen, vision, 
and commitment to developing the 
next generation of Georgia’s leaders. 
This award is much deserved for all the 
hard work and dedication that Mr. 
Jackson has poured into the Savannah 
business community. 
He is the founder and CEO of 
EnviroVac Holdings, which employs 
over 1,000 people, and the chairman of 
the Savannah Economic Development 
Authority. He was appointed by the 
Governor to serve on the board of the 
Georgia Ports Authority, and he has 
continued to volunteer with numerous 
charitable organizations around town. 
This is now the third major award he 
has won in Savannah for his accom-
plishments. He won Entrepreneur of 
the Year awards in both 2015 and 2018. 
I am so proud that the Savannah 
Technical College Foundation chose 
Catfish for this year’s honor. 
Congratulations, Catfish. Keep up the 
great work.

AMERICAN 
WORKERS 
ARE 
THE 
LIVING FABRIC AND BACKBONE 
OF OUR COUNTRY AND ECONOMY 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, today’s 
passage of the Protecting the Right to 
Organize Act is a major victory for the 
American worker. 
Nationwide, millions of Americans 
work 
full-time 
jobs 
yet 
earn 
unsustainable wages and little to no 
benefits. Too many people work mul-
tiple jobs yet struggle to make ends 
meet while they watch the stock mar-
ket and their executives, who, to-
gether, make millions upon millions. 
But by restoring balance to the gut-
ted National Labor Relations Act, the 
PRO Act will restore the collective 
voice and dignity of American workers 
from all backgrounds, no matter the 
color of their collar. 
The PRO Act includes meaningful, 
enforceable penalties for union-busting 
companies and executives. It restores 
workers’ ability to stand together by 
weakening States’ antilabor right-to- 
work laws and closes loopholes that 
corporations use to exploit workers. 
Most importantly, it strengthens work-
ers’ right to free and fair union elec-
tions and requires corporations to re-
spect the results. 
American workers are the living fab-
ric and backbone of our country and 
economy and the future of our pros-
perity. They deserve the power to 
stand together and advocate for them-
selves. The PRO Act is the pathway to 
that power.

TIME TO GET BACK TO ISSUES 
THAT MATTER TO THE AMER-
ICAN PEOPLE 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to address my colleagues in both 
Chambers of Congress. 
Yesterday, we saw the absolute ac-
quittal in the Senate of President Don-
ald Trump after 3 years of baseless ac-
cusations, harassment, and a prolonged 
witch hunt known as the impeachment 
process. 
Without a doubt, the saddest part of 
this 130-day fiasco that cost taxpayers 
an estimated $3 million and yielded 
zero direct evidence implicating the 
President has been the colossal waste 
of time and resources. 
The question we must ask ourselves 
now is this: How many lives could we 
have bettered during all of this? 
The answer is: Countless. 
It is time to get back to the issues 
that matter to the American people. 
Let’s find common ground and do 
something.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H930 
February 6, 2020 
Today, I stand here just feet away 
from where President Trump stood on 
Tuesday and called for unity in this 
body. 
As the President said that night, the 
only victories that matter in Wash-
ington are those that deliver for the

Will you join me? 
The American people are watching.

THREE IMPORTANT BILLS 
(Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. DAVIDS of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to share my support of 
three important bills that were consid-
ered by the House on Wednesday: H.R. 
4044, the Protect and Restore Amer-
ica’s Estuaries Act; H.R. 4031, the 
Great 
Lakes 
Restoration 
Initiative 
Act; and H.R. 2382, the USPS Fairness 
Act. 
Regrettably, I was unable to cast my 
votes for this legislation, but had I 
been able to, I would have voted to pass 
all three. 
I had the pleasure to support Mr. 
MALINOWSKI’s and Mr. JOYCE’s bills in 
the full Transportation and Infrastruc-
ture Committee markup and would 
have gladly voted for them on the 
House floor as well. 
I am particularly disappointed to 
have missed the vote on the USPS 
Fairness Act, offered by Chairman 
DEFAZIO, which I cosponsored. Impor-
tantly, it would repeal the 2006 man-
date that the U.S. Postal Service 
prefund future retiree health benefits. 
My mom has had a long civil service 
career at the U.S. Post Office, and so 
the issue really hits home for me. 
No other industry is so unfairly bur-
dened with prefunding benefits in this 
way, and this bill would help stem the 
financial losses faced by the USPS. 
What is more, it would have no effect 
on the Federal budget. 
This legislation is not the end of the 
discussion for how we protect this vital 
industry and its workers; it is merely 
the beginning.

NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Mr. Speaker, this morn-
ing, my father, my son, my father-in- 
law, and I attended the National Pray-
er Breakfast, and joined thousands of 
other men and women to pray for our 
country and our President. 
This was one of the most humbling 
experiences of my life and will remain 
one of the greatest honors that has 
come with the position of my office. 
Prayer is an important part of my 
Christian faith. It is an act that people 
of faith value immensely, and every 
person should be able to pray, free from 
persecution, in any institution of the 
United States. 
Additionally, our children should 
never feel ostracized for displaying 
their faith and expressing their reli-
gious beliefs in our schools across our 
Nation. It is more important than ever 
to defend our First Amendment rights 
and to support efforts made by our 
President and his administration, and 
Members of Congress should uphold 
these values and protect prayer.

NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS WEEK 
(Ms. JUDY CHU of California asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. 
Speaker, earlier this week, President 
Trump delivered his State of the Union 
address in this very Chamber. At one 
point, he praised the Second Amend-
ment and gun rights, but neglected to 
even mention the 100 Americans who 
are killed with guns every day. That 
number is only part of it. 
This week is National Gun Violence 
Survivors Week and their stories fill 
out the picture of the reality of guns in 
America. Over half of adult Americans 
have or know someone who has experi-
enced gun violence, and about 3 million 
children experience gun violence every 
year. 
That doesn’t even include the mil-
lions more students who go to school 
afraid that they could be the victim of 
a mass shooting, all because the NRA 
and the Republican lawmakers they 
fund refuse to even allow the most 
commonsense gun legislation, like H.R. 
8. 
This legislation would ensure that no 
one could buy a gun without a back-
ground check, and a bipartisan major-
ity of Americans agree. 
It is time to end the NRA strangle-
hold, and end gun violence.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF RATIFICA-
TION OF 19TH AMENDMENT IN 
NEW JERSEY 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, 
February 9, 2020 marks the 100th anni-
versary of the ratification of the 19th 
Amendment in New Jersey. 
The 19th Amendment was introduced 
to Congress in 1878. The amendment 
reads: ‘‘The right of citizens of the 
United States to vote shall not be de-
nied or abridged by the United States 
or by any State on account of sex.’’ 
It was not passed by Congress until 
the House of Representatives passed it 
in May of 1919 and the Senate passed it 
in June of 1919. It was then sent to the 
States for ratification, with New Jer-
sey being the 29th of the 36 States. 
I would like to honor the tireless ef-
forts of advocates over history, pio-
neer’s like New Jersey’s own, Dr. Alice 
Paul, who worked for years to get 
women the right to vote. Her persist-
ence and the persistence of thousands 
of women before and after her is a true 
example of how the dedication of these 
women changed our country and the 
world for the better. They are true 
American heroes. 
f 
PASS GUN SAFETY BILLS 
(Mr. CISNEROS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, in 
1960 my mother’s life changed dramati-
cally forever. That was the year her fa-
ther was murdered through an act of 
gun violence. She was just 10 years old 
and my grandmother became a widow 
with six children left to raise on her 
own. 
This week marks National Gun Vio-
lence Survivors Week, where we listen 
to stories like my mom’s and other 
survivors of gun violence through the 
country. 
But here in Congress, we need to do 
more than just listen to these stores. 
We need to act. Last year, the House 
passed commonsense, bipartisan gun 
safety legislation, H.R. 8, to expand 
background checks. This measure is 
something over 90 percent of the Amer-
ican public wants. 
Unfortunately, it has been sitting in 
the Senate for almost a year and that 
is unacceptable. Survivors of gun vio-
lence, victims of gun violence, and the 
American people deserve a Congress 
who will act and pass these gun safety 
bills. Enough is enough. 
f 
NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS WEEK 
(Mr. CROW asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in solemn observance of National 
Gun Violence Survivors Week. 
Colorado is home, and I am proud to 
represent the communities of Colo-
rado’s Sixth Congressional District, 
communities that have seen the hor-
rors of gun violence firsthand. 
Too many of my constituents bear 
the scars of gun violence long after 
their wounds have healed. Some never 
heal. In honor of their pain, their cour-
age, and their advocacy, we must call 
on the Senate to pass the commonsense 
reforms that have already been ap-
proved in the House. 
We must act now for Julie from High-
lands Ranch, Colorado, who was shot 
when she was 13. Julie was left para-
lyzed from the chest down, requiring 
her to walk with canes and braces for 
the rest of her life. My heart is with 
Julie for having the courage to speak 
out in support of commonsense re-
forms.

CENTRAL VIRGINIAN OF THE 
WEEK: HANNAH HOWARD 
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in recognition of the perse-
verance, strength, and compassion of 
my constituent, Hannah Howard. 
Hannah is a Gordonsville resident, 
Orange County High School senior, and 
Blue Ridge Virtual Governor’s School 
student. 
On May 8, 2019, Hannah lost her older 
brother, Devon, to a heroin overdose. 
In the 9 months since Devon’s death, 
Hannah has shown tremendous courage 
by studying addiction and educating 
her peers. 
As part of her senior project, Hannah 
interned at a rehabilitation facility 
where she learned about the recovery 
process and engaged with patients to 
understand substance use disorders. 
Following her internship, Hannah 
not only became certified to admin-
ister Narcan herself, but she led her 
first Narcan certification course to 
members of the Orange County Youth 
Council and plans to hold additional 
trainings in the future. 
I admire Hannah’s empathy and de-
termination. 
Through 
unimaginable 
loss, she has created a framework with-
in the Orange community to prevent 
tragedies like the one she and her fam-
ily have faced. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in thank-
ing Hannah for her selflessness and her 
service to Virginia’s Seventh Congres-
sional District.

REMARKS OF SENATOR MITT 
ROMNEY 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
know that Senator ROMNEY does not 
need to have his words further edified, 
but there is something about courage 
and something about his words that 
struck my heart. 
So if I might, in the remarks that 
Senator ROMNEY made yesterday in his 
decision to cast a vote for article I, he 
said, briefly: The Constitution is at the 
foundation of our Nation. We each take 
an oath to defend it. Paraphrasing, he 
said: We arrived at different judg-
ments, and he hoped that we would re-
spect each other’s good faith. Senator 
jurors swore an oath before God. 
He said: ‘‘I am profoundly religious. 
My faith is at the heart of who I am.’’ 
And he knew his decision would be 
hard. 
I thought we lived in a nation that 
respected the heartfelt decisions and 
deliberation that Members have to 
make. But after his decision and vote 
there was an onslaught of ugly and 
nasty comments, individuals calling 
him weak, #ExpellMitt. 
I want to live in a nation that is bet-
ter than that, that when we have to 
make hard decisions, we will be re-
spected by all of America. 
We all love the Constitution. I want 
to thank Senator ROMNEY for his pro-
file in courage. There needs to be more 
of that. He voted the right way. We all 
did who voted ‘‘aye’’ on article I and 
article II.

RECOGNIZING 175TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF BAYLOR UNIVERSITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. FLORES) is recognized until 10 p.m. 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 175th anniver-
sary of Baylor University. 
Baylor University, a private Chris-
tian university, was chartered by the 
Republic of Texas on February 1, 1845. 
The charter, signed by Republic of 
Texas President, Anson Jones, was sup-
ported by the efforts of Baptist pio-
neers who sought to establish a Chris-
tian university ‘‘fully susceptible of en-
largement and development to meet 
the needs of all ages to come.’’ 
Originally located in Independence, 
Texas, Baylor is the oldest, continually 
operating university in Texas, and was 
actually formed before Texas became a 
State. 
In 1886, Baylor moved its main cam-
pus to Waco, Texas, where it remains 
today, and combined with Waco Uni-
versity. The new flagship campus of 
over 1,000 acres along the banks of the 
Brazos River enabled the university to 
flourish in its new central Texas home. 
Today, Baylor continues to uphold 
their mission to educate men and 
women for worldwide leadership and 
service by integrating academic excel-
lence and Christian commitment with-
in a caring community. 
Baylor’s diverse student body is com-
prised of over 18,000 students from all 
50 States and from over 90 countries. 
Both undergraduate and graduate stu-
dents are propelled toward success by 
passionate and committed faculty and 
staff who recognize a calling to address 
society’s greatest challenges. 
A nationally ranked and distinctly 
Christian research university, Baylor 
is on an ambitious path to become the 
ninth Research 1, or R1, university in 
Texas, and the world’s preeminent 
Christian research university. 
As Baylor strives to attain the cov-
eted R1 status, it is continually engag-
ing in research at the highest levels as 
students work to fight disease, inves-
tigate environmental challenges, pio-
neer new technologies, and advance 
human flourishing. 
This university-wide commitment to 
excellence is evident through class-
room teaching and a communal drive 
toward 
success. 
Faculty 
provide 
impactful services to Baylor students 
and support them academically, spir-
itually, personally, and in their future 
careers. 
b 2145 
Baylor strives to enable each student 
to achieve at the highest levels of 
human performance in academics, arts, 
and 
athletics, 
preparing 
them 
for 
worldwide leadership and service. 
Mr. Speaker, in recognition of the re-
cent 175th anniversary of Baylor Uni-
versity in Waco, Texas, I applaud the 
university’s ongoing commitment to 
Christian values and academic excel-
lence. 
I have requested that a United States 
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol 
to honor the 175 years of legacy and 
impact of Baylor University. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue praying for our country, 
for our military men and women who 
protect us, and for our first responders 
who keep us safe at home. 
RECOGNIZING BEN DOWNS 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ben Downs of 
Bryan, Texas, as a 2019 inductee into 
the Texas Radio Hall of Fame. 
Ben’s radio career began as a child-
hood fascination. Growing up in Hope, 
Arkansas, Ben dreamed of hearing his 
own voice over the radio. As a child, he 
recalls sitting up in the Hope Field 
House, pretending to give play-by-plays 
into an empty soda can. 
His dream came true on November 4, 
1968, when, at the age of 14, Ben went 
on the air for the first time. Looking 
back, Ben says he ‘‘wouldn’t let a 14- 
year-old run my station, but fortu-
nately for me, the manager at that 
radio station did.’’ 
By the time he went away to college 
at Texas A&M University in College 
Station, Texas, Ben was a seasoned 
pro. After 4 years at the station in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H932 
February 6, 2020 
Hope, Ben decided to focus on his stud-
ies and enjoy the radio solely as a lis-
tener. This didn’t last long, as he 
quickly found himself accepting a job 
offer from the local station in Bryan- 
College Station. That was in 1972, and 
he has been broadcasting ever since. 
It was at Texas A&M University that 
Ben and I first met during the fall of 
1972 as students in our management 105 
class. We are both proud members of 
the centennial class of 1976, and he and 
I remain close friends today. 
Since 1989, Ben has led Bryan Broad-
casting. 
Under 
his 
leadership, 
the 
group has expanded significantly into a 
variety of genres and formats. He has 
worked hard to ensure that Bryan 
Broadcasting is always at the forefront 
of technology and constantly offering 
its listeners new and exciting content. 
The rise of the internet and stream-
ing service has provided WTAW and 
Bryan Broadcasting with a platform 
for a wide array of programs and on-de-
mand podcasts while still promoting 
the traditional radio broadcast me-
dium. 
Ben remains involved in the broad-
casting community through the Texas 
Association of Broadcasters and the 
National Association of Broadcasters. 
He also consults regularly with Mem-
bers of Congress and the Federal Com-
munications Commission to address 
important issues to the broadcasting 
community. One issue that he is par-
ticularly passionate about is revitaliza-
tion of AM radio. 
Outside of his work in the broad-
casting industry, Ben has lived a life 
committed to service. During his time 
at Texas A&M University, Ben ac-
quired a reputation for community 
service, which continues today. He has 
said that he is proud to be a part of a 
community that takes giving to heart. 
In 2018, Ben was named Citizen of the 
Year by the Bryan-College Station 
Chamber of Commerce. 
It was Ben’s philanthropic spirit 
which led him to meet his wife, Lillian, 
44 years ago as he was working on a 
tennis tournament to benefit the local 
Boys and Girls Club. Today, Ben and 
Lillie have two adult children and 
three beautiful grandchildren. 
Mr. Speaker, I am humbled to honor 
the many accomplishments of my 
friend, Ben Downs, for his induction to 
the Texas Radio Hall of Fame, as well 
as his nomination for the Marconi 
Radio Award and the legendary Man-
ager of the Year Award, both from the 
National Association of Broadcasters. 
For decades, Ben’s career has been 
dedicated to the passion he found as a 
child, broadcasting, while continuing 
to push the industry to take advantage 
of ever-advancing technology. His ac-
complishments and his service-centric 
spirit are more than deserving of this 
amazing honor. He is a faithful commu-
nity leader, selfless servant, husband, 
father, grandfather, and friend. 
I have requested that a United States 
flag be flown over our Nation’s Capitol 
to honor Ben’s meaningful accomplish-
ments and contributions to the broad-
casting industry and to our Brazos Val-
ley community. 
As I close, I ask all our viewers to 
continue praying for our country, for 
our military men and women who pro-
tect us, and for our first responders 
who keep us safe at home. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF GEORGE AGUILAR 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of George 
Aguilar of Bryan, Texas, who passed 
away on January 13, 2020, after a battle 
with cancer. 
George was born on January 12, 1958, 
in San Antonio to Policarpio and 
Delores Aguilar. 
Growing up in a military family, 
George traveled a great deal across the 
United States and Germany. He grad-
uated from Killeen High School in 
Killeen, Texas, and went on to attend 
Central Texas College, where he stud-
ied criminal justice. 
From a young age, George lived a life 
of service and was dedicated to giving 
back to his community. Following 
graduation, he served as a jailer in 
Killeen and then as a corrections offi-
cer in Huntsville, which led him to find 
his dream job as a police officer. In 
1980, George joined the Bryan Police 
Department as a patrol officer. 
Over the next three decades, George 
served in many roles within the depart-
ment. As part of his commitment to 
the Bryan community, he served on pa-
trol, as a detective, as a school re-
source officer, and as a canine handler. 
He was instrumental in starting impor-
tant programs, such as Camp PAL, 
which operated from 1994 to 2005. He 
was 
awarded 
six 
commendations 
throughout his career and eventually 
earned a master peace officer’s license. 
After 341⁄2 years on the force, George 
retired from the Bryan Police Depart-
ment in 2015. However, his dedication 
to a life of service did not end there. 
Following his retirement, George went 
on to work as a bailiff for the Brazos 
County Associate Courts. 
George is remembered for his great 
sense of humor, his love of dance, and 
his bright, smiling face that brought 
joy to all of those around him. 
As a lifelong Dallas Cowboys fan, he 
attended as many games as he could, 
always 
cherishing 
the 
Cowboys 
v. 
Packers games he would attend with 
his son. 
Mr. Speaker, George’s life was de-
fined by his service to his community. 
He will forever be remembered as a fa-
ther, a brother, a fiance, and a selfless 
servant. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our heart-
felt condolence to the Aguilar family. 
We also lift up the family and friends 
of George Aguilar in our prayers. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans 
to continue praying for our country, 
for our first responders who protect us 
at home, and for our uniformed mili-
tary service personnel who protect us 
around the world. 
HONORING DR. STEPHEN A. HOLDITCH 
Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Stephen A. Holditch 
of College Station, Texas, who passed 
away unexpectedly on August 9, 2019. 
Before I continue our discussion 
about Steve, I want to give some con-
text about the importance of his pro-
fessional career. Let me state first that 
Steve considered his roles as a hus-
band, father, and grandfather to be his 
most important. Because of the excep-
tional way he lived those roles, his leg-
acy is readily apparent in the lives of 
those he left behind—his wife, Ann; his 
daughters, Katie and Abbie, and their 
five grandchildren. 
The discussion of his professional ac-
complishments starts with a descrip-
tion of current energy metrics. Today, 
the United States of America is blessed 
to be the number one producer of oil 
and natural gas in the world, and as of 
this year, we are a net exporter of oil 
and gas. Reserves of American oil and 
gas rank us among the top 10 countries 
in the world. We also lead the industri-
alized world in the reduction of carbon 
dioxide emissions over the past few 
decades. Ten years ago, no one would 
have ever predicted we would be where 
we are today. 
This new world of American energy 
dominance is having dramatic implica-
tions, both domestically and inter-
nationally. We have secure, stable, en-
vironmentally responsible, and attrac-
tively 
priced 
energy 
resources 
for 
American families and businesses. We 
have become a reliable source of en-
ergy for our allies, giving them the 
flexibility to move away from unstable 
Russian and Middle Eastern suppliers. 
The oil and gas sector of our economy 
has created millions of good jobs and 
great 
paychecks 
for 
hardworking 
Americans. Our balance of trade pay-
ments has improved, and our geo-
political position has strengthened. 
This dramatic energy renaissance 
didn’t happen by accident or by govern-
ment. It is the result of American inge-
nuity, research, and bold leadership. 
While no one person is solely respon-
sible for the seismic shift in American 
energy, there are a number of bold 
leaders 
who 
took 
challenges 
that 
looked impossible to solve and solved 
them, particularly in the area of stim-
ulation of low permeability, or tight, 
reservoirs. Their developments, stud-
ies, research, and field experiments 
using horizontal drilling and very large 
hydraulic fracturing treatments revo-
lutionized American oil and natural 
gas and transformed our economy and 
our security. 
One of those bold leaders was the late 
George P. Mitchell, Texas A&M class of 
1940. Another is the person we are hon-
oring today, Dr. Stephen A. Holditch, 
Texas A&M class of 1969. 
Stephen Holditch was born on Octo-
ber 20, 1946, in Corsicana, Texas, to 
Damon and Margie Holditch. Growing 
up, Steve and his family moved often 
while his father pursued a career in the 
oil and gas industry. He spent most of 
his childhood in San Antonio before 
moving to Richardson, Texas, for his 
final year of high school, where he 
graduated in 1965.

February 6, 2020 
Following 
graduation, 
Steve 
at-
tended Texas A&M University, where 
he joined the Corps of Cadets and began 
his journey as a Fightin’ Texas Aggie. 
Steve quickly excelled both in aca-
demics and the corps. While at A&M, 
he was a member of Company F–1, a 
member of the prestigious Ross Volun-
teers Honor Guard, and a member of 
the Ross Volunteers Firing Squad. Dur-
ing his senior year, he served as second 
battalion commander. In 1969, Steve 
graduated from Texas A&M University 
with a bachelor of science degree in pe-
troleum engineering. He continued at 
A&M to earn a master’s degree in the 
same discipline. 
Steve began his career with Shell Oil 
Company in Houston, Texas. Much of 
his work over his 5 years with Shell fo-
cused on designing and pumping large 
hydraulic fracture treatments to stim-
ulate production from the deep, low 
permeability 
geopressured 
gas 
res-
ervoirs in south Texas. It was his work 
with hydraulic fracturing that inspired 
him to return to Texas A&M and set 
him apart from his peers as a true leg-
end of the oil and gas industry for the 
advancement of this critically impor-
tant technology. 
One day in 1970, Steve was riding the 
elevator at work and met Ann Friddle, 
who was also working at Shell. Steve 
and Ann were married 6 months later 
on January 9, 1971, and they had been 
married over 48 years when Steve 
passed away. 
He and Ann returned to College Sta-
tion, and he pursued a Ph.D. in petro-
leum engineering, which he completed 
in 1975. In 1976, Steve joined the Texas 
A&M petroleum engineering faculty, 
and as if he didn’t have enough to do as 
a young father and new professor, he 
started his own consulting company, 
S.A. Holditch & Associates. 
S.A. Holditch & Associates quickly 
became a worldwide powerhouse in the 
petroleum engineering space. Over the 
years, Steve earned a reputation for 
being able to solve the most difficult 
petroleum engineering problems, espe-
cially those dealing with low perme-
ability reservoirs needing stimulation, 
typically through hydraulic fracturing. 
He was distinctly proud of the work 
that Holditch & Associates did along-
side the Gas Research Institute to ad-
vance understanding of low perme-
ability sandstones, shales, and coalbed 
methane. 
After over 20 years of success, Steve 
chose to sell Holditch & Associates to 
Schlumberger, where he stayed on as a 
fellow, the highest technical designa-
tion 
in 
that 
organization. 
As 
a 
Schlumberger Fellow for 5 years, Steve 
traveled extensively to help solve some 
of the world’s most difficult petroleum 
engineering problems. 
In 1995, at the age of 49, Steve was 
elected to the National Academy of En-
gineering, the highest honor that can 
be given to an engineer. After many 
years of service to the Society of Pe-
troleum Engineers, or SPE, Steve was 
elected to the board of directors, then 
vice president of finance, and finally 
president of this global organization 
with over 70,000 members. 
He was awarded almost every rec-
ognition that SPE has to give, includ-
ing three of the society’s top technical 
awards. He was elected an SPE hon-
orary member in 2006, the highest 
award that SPE can bestow upon an in-
dividual, and was officially named a 
Legend of Hydraulic Fracturing by 
SPE in 2014. 
While Steven enjoyed many profes-
sional successes in the commercial re-
gime, many of his accomplishments 
were at Texas A&M University, where 
he served on the faculty for 37 years. 
During his tenure, he taught 97 classes 
and served on over 150 graduate com-
mittees. From 2004 to 2012, Steve 
worked as head of the Harold Vance 
Department of Petroleum Engineering. 
During this time, he revitalized the 
Crisman Institute of Petroleum Re-
search and saw the number of students 
in the petroleum engineering depart-
ment more than double. Under his lead-
ership, the department quickly earned 
a reputation as the number one ranked 
university petroleum engineering de-
partment in the world. 
It was during his time at A&M that 
he created this second legacy for Amer-
ica’s hydrocarbon industry, the thou-
sands of Aggie petroleum engineers 
who work around the world every day 
utilizing Steve’s teaching and men-
toring to solve the world’s greatest en-
ergy challenges. Collectively, these 
pacesetters—George 
P. 
Mitchell, 
Michel T. Halbouty, and Dr. Stephen A. 
Holditch, and ones they taught and 
guided—have contributed significantly 
to America’s energy dominance that is 
changing the world today. 
In 2013, Steve retired from the fac-
ulty after many years of dedicated 
service to the Texas A&M community. 
Throughout his life, Steve often cred-
ited Texas A&M University as the 
foundation from which his success 
grew. He praised the values instilled in 
all Aggies, and in 2014, he was named a 
Texas A&M Distinguished Alumnus, an 
honor he richly deserved for a life of 
service and devotion to his beloved uni-
versity. In thanking the Aggie commu-
nity, Steve said: ‘‘You will look back 
at your years at Texas A&M as one of 
the best periods of your life. Always re-
member the Aggie Code of Honor.’’ 
In 2016, Steve was inducted in the 
Corps of Cadets Hall of Honor, an 
award which made him prouder and 
happier than perhaps any other award 
he had ever received. 
Following retirement, Steve enjoyed spend-
ing time in Bryan/College Station, with his wife 
Ann, their two daughters, and their five grand-
children. As a season ticket holder to a variety 
of Texas A&M sports, Steve continued to sup-
port the Aggies, but Fightin’ Texas Aggie Foot-
ball remained closest to his heart. Steve con-
tributed a great deal to the Texas A&M com-
munity and can be described as a model 
Texas Aggie, who was true to its core values 
of Excellence, Integrity, Leadership, Loyalty, 
Respect, and Selfless Service. One of my fa-
vorite phrases that Steve often used was ‘‘I re-
serve the right to get smarter.’’ That is what 
he did best, always pushing to find solutions 
to the world’s toughest oil and gas challenges. 
Mr. Speaker, Steve’s life was defined by his 
dedication to his family and friends, his world- 
changing accomplishments in energy, and his 
true love of Texas A&M University. He will be 
forever remembered as a true pioneer in his 
field, a devoted husband, father, grandfather, 
teacher, mentor and friend. My father has a 
saying—‘‘go make a hand.’’ Mr. Speaker, 
Steve Holditch truly ‘‘made a hand’’ for his 
family, his university, his community, our coun-
try, and the world. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and 
heartfelt condolences to the Holditch family. 
We also lift his family and friends in our pray-
ers. 
I have requested that a United States flag 
be flown over our Nation’s Capitol to honor the 
life and legacy of Dr. Stephen A. Holditch. 
As I close today, I urge all Americans to 
continue praying for our country, for our vet-
erans, for our military men and women who 
protect us, and for our first responders who 
keep us safe at home. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

RECOGNIZING THE 550TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BIRTH OF GURU 
NANAK 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize the 550th anniversary 
of the birth of Guru Nanak, founder of the Sikh 
religion. The 8th Congressional District of Illi-
nois is home to many Sikh-Americans and 
Sikh faithful. I wish to acknowledge Guru 
Nanak’s birth anniversary in the history of the 
Sikh religion and the important influence of 
Guru Nanak and Sikhism on other religions. 
Born the child of Hindu merchants, Guru 
Nanak spent his childhood in the village of 
Talwandi, which is located in the modern-day 
province of Punjab in the modern nation of 
Pakistan. In keeping with the custom of the 
times, he married at an early age and was 
quickly blessed with two sons. He began his 
adult years working at a storehouse for tax 
collections, and exploring his spiritual side 
through meditation, writing hymns, and poetry. 
Guru Nanak soon felt an irresistible calling 
to pursue spiritual enlightenment, however, 
after his thirtieth year embarked upon a series 
of pilgrimages in search of wisdom and reli-
gious truth. During this phase of his life, he 
composed a series of hymns that formed the 
basis of the Sikh religion and the foundation of 
the Adi Granth, the sacred text compiled in the 
early 17th century by the Fifth Sikh Guru 
Arjun. 
As revealed by Guru Nanak and the Adi 
Granth, Sikhism teaches that there is only one 
God, that God is without form or gender, that 
we are all equal before God, and that a good 
life is lived as part of a community and ex-
pressed by good deeds (and not merely by 
faith or good thoughts). Sikh spirituality en-
compasses a belief in an unending succession 
of birth, life, death and rebirth until perfection 
is realized and one’s soul is released from this 
cycle after achieving a complete under-
standing and acceptance of the nature of God. 
Guru Nanak is recognized as the first of the 
ten gurus revered by Sikh faithful throughout 
the world. His truths continue to guide the 
Sikh community and form the bedrock of its 
commitment to public service and deeply eth-
ical behavior. 
Madam Speaker, on this 550th anniversary 
of his birth I want to recognize the founding 
contribution of Guru Nanak to Sikhism, one of 
the world’s great religions, and also the many 
gurdwaras in the greater Chicagoland area 
and the Sikh faithful in the 8th Congressional 
District, for their service to their communities. 
HONORING XANDER CARTER 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Xander Carter. 
Xander is a very special young man who has 
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship 
and leadership by taking an active part in the 
Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1099, and earn-
ing the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Xander has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Xander has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, 
Xander has contributed to his community 
through his Eagle Scout project. Xander 
helped perform habitat maintenance at Martha 
LaFite Thompson Nature Sanctuary in Liberty, 
Missouri, clearing over an acre of land of 
invasive honeysuckle and unhealthy trees and 
planting 25 new Missouri Dogwood trees. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Xander Carter for his ac-
complishments with the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica and for his efforts put forth in achieving the 
highest distinction of Eagle Scout.

TRIBUTE TO DEAN SEIF 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to an individual 
whose dedication and contributions to the 
community of Corona in Riverside County, 
California are exceptional. On Thursday, Feb-
ruary 6, 2020, Dean Seif will be honored as 
the 2019 Citizen of the Year by the Corona 
Chamber of Commerce. 
The mission statement of the Corona Cham-
ber is to promote business, advocacy, commu-
nity and economic development while serving 
as a catalyst for improving the overall quality 
of life in our community and region. Dean ex-
emplifies this mission statement in all that he 
does in business and beyond. Dean has 
served the Chamber through various roles, in-
cluding as the Chairman of the Board in 2016, 
and remains a strong advocate for the Cham-
ber and their principles. 
Today, Dean continues to serve our com-
munity as a Board Member for the Corona 
Chamber and as the President of the Corona 
Chamber Foundation. He is also a Corona- 
Norco United Way Board Member, sits on the 
Governing Board of the Corona Regional Med-
ical Center, and is a Member of the Corona 
Rotary Club. Dean is a local business owner, 
an active community member, and role model 
for many. 
Considering all that Dean has done for the 
community of Riverside County and the city of 
Corona, it is only fitting to honor him as Cit-
izen of the Year. Dean has contributed im-
mensely to the betterment of our region and I 
am proud to call him a friend, a fellow commu-
nity member, American and a constituent of 
the 42nd Congressional District of California. I 
add my voice to the many who will be con-
gratulating Dean Seif on being named Citizen 
of the Year by the Corona Chamber of Com-
merce.

HONORING GREATER VALLEJO 
RECREATION DISTRICT 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Greater Vallejo 
Recreation District (GVRD) on the 75th anni-
versary of its founding. 
Greater Vallejo Recreation District was es-
tablished in June of 1944 and has provided 
exceptional services to better the quality of life 
in our community ever since. This independent 
special service district offers recreational ac-
tivities and leisure services to the people of 
Vallejo. GVRD is strongly committed to cre-
ating and managing age inclusive programs 
and facilities for the benefit and enjoyment of 
over 120,000 residents. 
Greater Vallejo Recreation District manages 
mostly city-owned recreational properties and 
an additional 1000 acres of public land. These 
city properties include neighborhood parks, 
special purpose parks, an Olympic-size swim-
ming pool and community centers. GVRD is 
responsible for organizing and overseeing 
services provided by Parks & Recreation. 
GVRD holds a variety of youth and family- 
friendly programs, such as Family Campouts, 
Breakfast with Santa, Concerts in the Park 
and Family Movie Nights. The GVRD staff 
works tirelessly to uphold the organization’s 
mission to improve the livelihood of our com-
munity, and their outstanding service is evi-
denced by the gratitude of our community. 
GVRD also offers educational programs to 
adults and youths. Students can attend an 
array of afterschool programs, including mar-
tial art classes, painting lessons, Spanish 
classes, online drivers education courses and 
many more. Furthermore, GVRD advocates 
passionately for a healthy lifestyle. The District 
organizes basketball and baseball trainings for 
children and teens along with cardio and 
weight lifting classes for adults. GVRD has 
maintained a tradition of creativity paired with 
excellent services that demonstrate ideals de-
fined by the programs it provides. 
Madam Speaker, the Greater Vallejo Recre-
ation District has been instrumental in fulfilling 
the educational and amusement needs of our 
community. It is therefore fitting and proper 
that we honor the Greater Vallejo Recreation 
District on the 75th anniversary of its founding.

wife and a friend to many; Ann Keyes. Mrs.

tification in Emergency Management, State

cation for Community Rating System Coordi-
nator, and Certification for Chronic Diseases 
and Chronic Pain Self-Management Training

North Carolina, I applaud Mrs. Keyes for her

gency preparedness of our communities in 
North Carolina. On behalf of the United States 
House of Representatives and the people of 
the First District of North Carolina, I express 
appreciation to Mrs. Ann Keyes for 44 years of 
committed service to Washington County. I 
thank for her for her perseverance and willing-
ness to go the extra mile to ensure public

Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Tate Eivins. Tate 
is a very special young man who has exempli-
fied the finest qualities of citizenship and lead-
ership by taking an active part in the Boy

Tate has been very active with his troop,

HONORING THE LIFE OF EDWARD

Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise

time 
Concord 
resident, 
Edward 
Anthony 
Vaccaro, Sr., Ph.D. 
Edward Vaccaro was born in Paterson, New

HONORING THE LIFE OF DEPUTY 
RICHARD WHITTEN 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
heavy heart that I rise today to honor the life 
and legacy of Liberty County Sheriff’s Deputy 
Richard Whitten, who succumbed to complica-
tions of a gunshot wound sustained on May 
29, 2019, while responding to a crisis call in 
Cleveland, Texas. 
On May 29, Deputy Whitten was off-duty 
and en route to a law enforcement training 
class, when ‘‘shots fired’’ was dispatched over 
the radio. Deputy Whitten did not hesitate to 
put himself in harm’s way, he responded in-
stantly, arriving just as the suspect was fleeing 
the scene after murdering two people at a 
Cleveland business. After a brief pursuit, Dep-
uty Whitten was shot in the neck by the mur-
der suspect—paralyzing him instantly. The 
perpetrator subsequently committed suicide. 
Following this tragedy, Deputy Whitten re-
mained hospitalized at TIRR Memorial Her-
man, a world-class rehabilitation hospital in 
the Houston Medical Center. On February 3, 
2020, Deputy Whitten suffered a complication 
while undergoing physical therapy and trag-
ically passed away. 
In July 2019, Deputy Whitten, his wife, 
Kami, and I had a lengthy conversation about 
his passion for law enforcement as well as his 
recovery process. He personally told me that 
he would do it all over again to protect his 
community. He served with the Liberty County 
Sheriff’s Office for four years and will be great-
ly missed. 
Deputy Whitten selflessly paid the ultimate 
sacrifice to ensure the safety and well-being of 
the citizens of Liberty County. Madam Speak-
er, I would like to thank Deputy Richard Whit-
ten, for his faithful service and devotion to his 
community. My prayers remain with his family 
and friends at this time.

CONGRATULATING MISSOURI’S 7TH 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT’S 
FOOTBALL TEAMS 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
commend the Webb City football team, who 
won their 15th State Title in Class 4 last year. 
‘‘Go Cardinals’’. I would also like to commend 
the Carthage football team for winning the 
Class 5 State Championship and our Joplin 
High School football team who were runner’s 
up in the Class 6 State Championship. They 
all performed admirably this season and dem-
onstrated a determination and dedication to 
their team, school, supporters and commu-
nities. 
Webb City football has a legacy of excel-
lence and tradition that is evident in their 
record, which they only improved upon by 
claiming their fifteenth state title 48–0 against 
Platte County. The Cardinal’s, ranked 1st in 
their Class with a 13–1 record, had a hard 
road reaching the finals. They faced not only 
the 2nd best ranked team, but also the 3rd 
and 4th in the lead up to their championship 
win. Following their semifinal defeat in 2018 to 
the eventual champions, Webb City’s program 
worked hard all season and succeeded in ac-
complishing their goal of ‘‘Chasing 15.’’ 
Carthage football’s Class 5 Championship 
win was tough fought, including a nail-biting 
third quarter with an impressive long comple-
tion that secured their 27–21 win against sec-

HONORING CALEB JONES 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly pause to recognize Caleb Jones. 
Caleb is a very special young man who has 
exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship 
and leadership by taking an active part in the 
Boy Scouts of America, Troop 1099, and earn-
ing the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout. 
Caleb has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities. Over the 
many years Caleb has been involved with 
scouting, he has not only earned numerous 
merit badges, but also the respect of his fam-
ily, peers, and community. Most notably, 
Caleb has contributed to his community 
through his Eagle Scout project. Caleb set up 
a school supply drive and raised money to re-
build non-working bathrooms at a school in 
the country of Kosovo, while also installing 
playground equipment at the school when he 
visited in 2019. 
Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join 
me in commending Caleb Jones for his ac-
complishments with the Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica and for his efforts put forth in achieving the

HONORING GEORGE L. ORTIZ 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with my colleague, Rep-
resentative JARED
HUFFMAN, to remember 
George L. Ortiz for decades of exceptional 
public service to Northern California and to 
honor him for his commitment to our Latino 
community. 
Mr. Ortiz was born in East Los Angeles in 
1934 to migrant farmworker parents. From an 
early age, Mr. Ortiz followed in his parents’ 
footsteps by working in the fields of Southern 
California. He then served in the U.S. Army in 
Germany in 1957 and 1958. After his time in 
the military, he received a track scholarship at 
Fresno State College, where he became the 
first member of his family to attend college. 
Mr, Ortiz moved to Northern California in the 
1960s and became a social worker, first for 
Sonoma County and then for California Rural 
Legal Assistance. For nearly 60 years, he was 
at the forefront of efforts to organize and bring 
equal opportunity and treatment to Mexican 
Americans living in the North Bay and beyond. 
In 1967, Mr. Ortiz co-founded California 
Human Development, a leading human serv-
ices organization, and the Latinos Unidos 
scholarship program. 
In 1999, The Press Democrat named 
George Ortiz as one of 50 people most re-
sponsible for shaping Sonoma County through 
the 20th Century. In 2017, the North Bay Busi-
ness Journal bestowed on him the Latino 
Business Leadership Award. In 2018, Sonoma 
State University awarded Mr. Ortiz the hon-
orary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters and 
that same year, the Mexican government pre-
sented him one of its highest honors, the Ohtli 
Award, for his efforts on behalf of Mexican na-
tionals in the United States. 
Mr. Ortiz leaves behind a loving and de-
voted family; his wife Carol and their children, 
Robert and Diane and two granddaughters. 
Madam Speaker, we thank Mr. Ortiz for his 
unrelenting commitment to uplift Latinos in 
Northern California. It is therefore fitting and 
proper that we honor his service and remem-
ber the life of George L. Ortiz here today.

REMEMBERING ACTOR KIRK 
DOUGLAS 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember the great actor, humanitarian and 
philanthropist Kirk Douglas, who passed away 
Wednesday at the age of 103. Americans of a 
certain age will remember Kirk Douglas in his 
roles as Spartacus, leader of a slave revolt in 
ancient Rome; the painter Vincent Van Gogh; 
the gunfighter Doc Holliday; and General 
George S. Patton. Others will recall that he re-
ceived the Presidential Medal of Freedom 
from Jimmy Carter and the Kennedy Center 
Honors award from President Bill Clinton. I will 
remember him for the personal note he sent to 
me in 2015 after I wished him well from the 
House floor on the occasion of his 99th birth-
day. I said that he would go down in Holly-
wood and American history for his courageous 
role in breaking the McCarthy era blacklist by 
putting the screenwriter Dalton Trumbo’s 
name in the film credits for ‘‘Spartacus.’’ In his 
note to me, he said: ‘‘Unfortunately, I have 
lived long enough to see that climate of fear 
and xenophobia reborn. I sincerely hope you 
and your fellow legislators will find a way to 
come together in these troubling times. It is 
essential that our leaders lead rather than fol-
low the hateful messages of the new dema-
gogues.’’ He added that no one should take 
for granted ‘‘the privilege of living in America.’’ 
Mr. Douglas’ humanitarianism was displayed 
not only in his choice of roles but in the mes-
sages of the films he produced. He said he 
loved the theme of ‘‘Lonely Are the Brave’’ 
that, ‘‘if you try to be an individual, society will 
crush you.’’ He said he chose to play char-
acters who were ‘‘part scoundrel,’’ because ‘‘I 
don’t find virtue photogenic.’’ His philanthropic 
activities through the Douglas Foundation, cre-
ated in 1964, included building 400 play-
grounds in Los Angeles; creating the Douglas 
Family Early Childhood Center at Sinai Tem-
ple in Los Angeles; substantial underwriting of 
programs at the Children’s Hospital of Los An-
geles and establishing the Anne Douglas Cen-
ter for Homeless Women, named for his wife. 
Mr. Douglas was born into poverty in Amster-
dam, New York, the son of illiterate Russian 
Jewish immigrants; his father was a ragman, 
a seller of discarded goods. His best-selling 
autobiography was The Ragman’s Son, pub-
lished in 1988. He knew anti-Semitism from an 
early age, but also knew he wanted to be an 
actor, changing his name from Isadore 
Demsky to Kirk Douglas and making his 
Broadway debut in 1941 as a singing Western 
Union messenger in ‘‘Spring Again.’’ Known 
for his rugged good looks and dimpled chin, 
he received three Academy Award nomina-
tions. In 1996, the Academy honored his body 
of work with a Lifetime Achievement Oscar. 
America will long remember Kirk Douglas. His 
was a storied life.

HONORING PATRICK J. JOLLY 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Patrick J. Jolly 
for his dedicated service to our community as 
Napa County Veteran Services Officer. 
Mr. Jolly was born in San Francisco and 
served in the Navy for twenty years. Following 
his service, he went on to help fellow veterans 
as a Veteran Services Officer for Sonoma 
County, where he stayed for three years. 
Afterwards, Mr. Jolly became a Napa County 
Veterans Services Officer, ensuring all vet-
erans, surviving spouses and family members 
receive access to all benefits to which they 
are entitled. In this function, he has helped 
over 5,000 veterans and their families receive 
millions in benefits, one-time claims, and col-
lege fee waivers. Mr. Jolly was also instru-
mental in bringing a VA healthcare presence 
to Napa County, and has advocated for vet-
erans throughout his career. After thirteen 
years of honorable community service, Mr. 
Jolly is retiring. 
Mr. Jolly has served as President of the 
California Association of County Veteran Serv-
ices Officers (CACVSO) as well as CACVSO 
Parliamentarian. He is also a Certified Vet-
erans Advocates, a member of the American 
Legion, part of The Military Order of the Pur-
ple Heart, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. 
He has been married to his wife, Kate Jolly, 
since 1977. He is known for his unique hob-
bies such as playing the bagpipe and brewing 
his own beer. A kind, compassionate, and 
knowledgeable member of our community, Mr. 
Jolly has served our district and our country 
for decades. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Jolly is the kind of cit-
izen we should all strive to be. He has dedi-
cated his life to service and to his fellow vet-
erans. It is therefore fitting and proper that we 
honor Patrick J. Jolly here today.

HONORING THE LIFE OF EARL

HON. MARK DeSAULNIER

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and service of long-
time Concord resident, Earl Meyer Goldman. 
Earl Goldman was born in Milwaukee, Wis-
consin and along with his mother and brother, 
eventually came to California. Earl graduated 
from Albany High School and then UC Berke-
ley with a degree in business. After marrying, 
Earl and his wife moved to Concord where 
they raised their family. 
In his professional life, Earl’s entrepreneurial 
spirit led him down many different paths. He 
started Earl Goldman Insurance from his 
house, which he grew into a successful local 
business. He also owned a laundromat and 
co-owned a radio station. 
Earl’s passion for his community has left a 
mark on the City of Concord. He envisioned a 
revitalization of Concord’s downtown Todos 
Santos Plaza, and not only worked with public 
officials to improve Concord’s infrastructure, 
but also dedicated himself to the long process 
of expansion and redevelopment. In addition 
to that work, Earl also supported various orga-
nizations, including the Concord Junior Opti-
mist baseball league, Mount Diablo Hospital, 
and Friends of Camp Concord. Most of all, 
Earl will be remembered for his positive atti-
tude and the love he had for his community. 
Earl Goldman was a cherished member of 
Concord and he will be missed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E143 
February 6, 2020 
Einar’s career as a civil engineer in the 
greater Sacramento area began immediately 
after his graduation from California State Uni-
versity, Sacramento. After stints at two local 
engineering firms, Einar joined PCWA in 1985, 
and his rapid ascension since then highlights 
his profound impact in serving the needs of 
the community. 
Water resiliency and infrastructure are 
among the most pressing needs in our region, 
and Einar has never shied away from tackling 
the most challenging projects that certainly 
could not have been completed without his 
hard work and devotion. 
Beginning his tenure at PCWA as a Senior 
Civil Engineer, Einar went on to serve as the 
Agency’s Director of Strategic Affairs for fif-
teen years. His responsibilities in engaging in 
external matters included his participation in 
the Sacramento Area Water Forum and man-
aging several large-scale water infrastructure 
projects critical to the region. These include 
the Penryn/Lincoln pipeline project, the expan-
sion of the Foothill Water Treatment Plant, 
and the Stanford Ranch project, just to name 
a few. 
Einar provided strategic planning, manage-
ment, and oversight for PCWA’s Cross-Basin 
Pipeline Project, L.L. Anderson Dam spillway 
modification project, American River Pump 
Station project, and relicensing of the Middle 
Fork American River Project, where he nego-
tiated a new power sale contract and the re-
newal of PCWA’s water supply contracts. All 
of this work has greatly expanded the Agen-
cy’s status in the California energy market. 
This extensive list of accomplishment led to 
him being selected as PCWA’s General Man-
ager in 2015, a role he has thrived in over the 
past five years. As General Manager, he 
worked to ensure PCWA’s long-term viability 
as the local leader in water rights and eco-
nomic prosperity by overseeing a clear and 
transparent budget process, increasing cus-
tomer accessibility to the Agency, and expand-
ing its regional and national influence on water 
issues. Throughout this long tenure, Einar has 
always prioritized the needs and interests of 
the customers and community. 
Einar is now retiring after nearly 35 years of 
service at the Agency, where he took tremen-
dous pride in serving the people of Placer 
County. His work will leave a lasting impact on 
water planning, resiliency, and management in 
Northern California for decades to come, and 
Representative LAMALFA and I could not be 
more thankful for all Einar has done. He will 
now be able to spend much more time trav-
eling, playing golf, and spending time with his 
wife Susan, his son, daughter, stepdaughter, 
and two grandsons. We wish him the best of 
luck in his much-deserved retirement.

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF MARK 
DAVIS 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to Mark Davis in ap-
preciation of his dedicated service to the peo-
ple of Kentucky’s Fifth Congressional District, 
specifically through his tireless work with Op-
eration UNITE and the Eastern Kentucky 
PRIDE organization over the last two decades. 
I count it a great honor to have had high- 
caliber individuals, like Mark, helping lead ini-
tiatives that I personally launched to meet dire 
needs across more than 40 counties in south-
ern and eastern Kentucky. He’s the type of in-
dividual who has sacrificed countless hours, 
executing a broad spectrum of tasks with his 
unique charisma, the utmost humility, a tire-
less reliability and sheer excellence. 
Mark joined Eastern Kentucky PRIDE (Per-
sonal Responsibility in a Desirable Environ-
ment) in 2002 as a Field Representative. 
PRIDE is a grassroots non-profit organization 
that was launched to help clean-up the hill-
sides, roadways, lakes and streams, across 
our beautiful Appalachian region in Kentucky. 
Thanks in-large-part to Mark’s ambition, orga-
nizational skills, and drive, upwards of 30,000 
volunteers have participated in litter clean-up 
campaigns every year to improve the environ-
ment. There has never been a task too great 
or too small for Mark. He was always the first 
to graciously give his time and energy for the 
greater good, whether it involved greeting vol-
unteers at events and handing out trash bags, 
or working directly with state officials to clean 
up the largest illegal dumpsites in Eastern 
Kentucky, or educating students about the 
value of greenhouses and protecting our wet-
lands. While others discussed ways to im-
prove our environment, Mark was outdoors 
getting the job done. PRIDE’s work is where 
the rubber meets the road—and Mark could 
often be found pulling up his bootstraps to 
haul appliances from illegal dumpsites, trans-
port volunteers to service sites, building out-
door classrooms, and finding every opportunity 
to make a difference every single day. 
Mark’s passion for PRIDE bled over to an-
other powerful movement in our region, Oper-
ation UNITE, a holistic non-profit organization 
aimed at curbing the deadly opioid epidemic 
both in our region and nationwide. After faith-
fully volunteering for Camp UNITE, where he 
served as a mentor to at-risk middle school 
students, he joined the UNITE team in 2014 
as the Youth Programs Coordinator, and later 
a Law Enforcement Liaison. In an effort to cre-
atively raise drug-free awareness among our 
youth, Mark operated a state-of-the-art mobile 
education trailer and prevention program, 
called ‘‘On the Move,’’ in partnership with the 
Kentucky Army National Guard and the Appa-
lachian High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area 
(AHIDTA). Since 2013, approximately 40,000 
students from schools in 43 counties and four 
states have participated in the interactive pro-
gram. He also played a valuable role each 
year at the National Rx Drug Abuse and Her-
oin Summit, coordinating logistics for the event 
that has grown into the largest conference in 
the country aimed at saving lives and address-
ing the nation’s opioid crisis through a 
multipronged approach. 
Mark is the teammate you want to have in 
the fox hole with you when things get tough, 
and the comic relief you need on a difficult 
day. His dedication, his inspirational attitude, 
and perseverance have set the bar high for 
programs operated by PRIDE and UNITE. I’m 
grateful for the personal efforts that he has in-
vested in the lives of countless students and 
families across Southern and Eastern Ken-
tucky, and I wish him the very best success in 
the years ahead. 
RECOGNIZING EMILY 
HERGENRIDER OF LAUREL 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Emily Hergenrider of Laurel for 
her resilience as she faces life’s challenges 
and her leadership. 
A senior at Laurel High School, Emily was 
born with 16 congenital heart defects and has 
had seven open-heart surgeries. They are a 
huge part of Emily’s life, but she has not let 
them define her. 
Emily faced one of her most challenging 
times in seventh grade. She had gone through 
her seventh open-heart surgery and was miss-
ing a lot of school. As a result, it was rec-
ommended she be held back for a year. Not 
wanting to do that, Emily refused to let the cir-
cumstances get the best of her, and instead 
used it as motivation. 
Emily worked diligently to catch up in 
school, even as she recovered from surgery 
and 
attended 
numerous 
follow-up 
visits. 
Today, five years later, her hard work and 
drive have paid off. Emily is reaching her full 
potential and is expected to graduate in May. 
In addition to her success in the classroom, 
Emily serves as president of the Laurel High 
School chapter of Future Farmers of America. 
She says she fell in love with agriculture be-
cause of her dad. She dreams of one day be-
coming a rancher and owning cattle. Emily 
says FFA, along with her other extracurricular 
activities, have motivated her to come to 
school even when she isn’t feeling well. 
Emily says she plans to continue her edu-
cation and earn a degree in ag business or ag 
management. She even already has a few 
heads of her own cattle. 
Madam Speaker, for her persistence and 
perseverance in the face of life’s challenges 
and for her leadership and service, I recognize 
Emily Hergenrider of Laurel for her Spirit of 
Montana.

Nacha serves as trustee of the Automated 
Clearing House (ACH) Network, enabling pay-
ments such as direct deposit and direct pay-
ment via ACH. Today, Nacha’s work is more 
important than ever, as more than 80 percent 
of U.S. workers now receive their regular pay 
using Direct Deposit via ACH, and consumers 
now pay 800 million bills each month with Di-
rect Payment via ACH. 24.7 billion ACH pay-
ments, valued at a total of $55.8 trillion, 
moved across the ACH Network in 2019 
alone, the fifth straight year to see a gain of 
more than one billion payments. 
Rep. WEXTON and I are thrilled to recognize 
Nacha’s commitment to creating and fostering 
an award-winning work environment in North-
ern Virginia, and we commend them on their 
efforts to strengthen the ACH Network. We 
are proud to represent in Congress many em-
ployees of one of the 2020 Best Places to 
Work in Virginia. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join us in recognizing Nacha’s successes, and 
in congratulating them on the well-deserved 
honor of being named one of the 2020 Best 
Places to Work in Virginia.

HONORING RUDY CAMPBELL 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Rudy Campbell, 
former mayor of Tempe, who passed away on 
February 3, 2020 at the age of 96. Arizonans 
will remember him as a dedicated man who 
committed his life to serving his country and 
making Tempe a better place to work and live. 
Deeply committed to his community, Mayor 
Campbell had a long and storied history of 
public service. 
Born in Oklahoma to migrant farmworkers, 
Campbell learned the early value and dignity 
of hard work. He forged his own path and 
worked every day to provide his parents and 
sister with the support they needed to succeed 
in their own lives. After serving in World War 
II, Campbell came to Arizona and made 
Tempe his home. He settled down to work 
and raised his family in Tempe with his wife, 
Greta. They had two children, four grand-
children, and nine great-grandchildren together 
over their 76-year marriage. 
Campbell took on many leadership roles 
throughout his decades of public service in the 
Tempe community. He served as President of 
the Tempe Chamber of Commerce, Chairman 
of the Arizona Highway Commission, and a 
member of the Tempe City Council. A cham-
pion of public education, Campbell advocated 
for accessible and affordable higher education 
for all during his service on the Arizona Board 
of Regents. In 1966, Campbell made history 
by becoming the first Mayor elected by the 
people of Tempe. His tenure leading the city 
served as a model for future mayors and will 
continue to inspire generations of leaders in 
Tempe and across Arizona. 
As Mayor, Campbell worked tirelessly to ex-
pand and transform Tempe’s infrastructure. 
Campbell modernized Tempe’s roads, high-
ways, and bridges, leading the way for indus-
try and accelerating economic growth in the 
region. His contributions to the city were in-
valuable and laid the foundation for modern- 
day Tempe. 
His service as mayor and in the community 
led to the City of Tempe naming a park in his 
honor. Today, Campbell Park is a beloved 
place in our local community and a testament 
to his lifetime achievement. His legacy will 
continue to live on for years to come. 
I thank Mayor Campbell for his service and 
Godspeed.

REMARKS AT THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE LIBERATION OF 
AUSCHWITZ BY SURVIVOR MAR-
IAN TURSKI 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, on January 
27, world leaders gathered at the site of 
Auschwitz, the notorious Nazi death camp, 
where 1.1 million innocent people—960,000 of 
them Jews—were systematically murdered 
during the Second World War. They joined 
survivors to mark the seventy-fifth anniversary 
of the camp’s liberation by Allied forces on 
January 27, 1945. Among the survivors who 
spoke at that commemoration was Marian 
Turski, a Polish-Jewish journalist and historian 
who has been a global advocate for Holocaust 
remembrance and human rights—and who 
marched in 1965 with Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr. from Selma to Montgomery. 
His powerful words stirred the souls of those 
gathered on that solemn day. I have read 
them, and I want to share them with my col-
leagues so that they too will be moved. All 
Americans ought to read his account and his 
warning to future generations that we must 
heed the lessons of the Holocaust and the rise 
of the Nazi movement that brought it about. 
Therefore, I include in the RECORD his re-
marks. 
REMARKS BY MARIAN TURSKI, AUSCHWITZ, 
JANUARY 27, 2020 
Dear friends, I am one of the few still alive 
of those who remained in this place almost 
to the very last moment before liberation. 
My so-called evacuation from Auschwitz 
commenced on the 18th of January. Over the 
next six and a half days it proved a death 
march for more than half of my fellow in-
mates, with whom I marched in a column of 
six hundred. In all likelihood, I will not 
make it to the next commemoration. Such 
are the laws of nature. 
Please therefore forgive me the emotion in 
what I will now say. This is what I want to 
say above all to my daughter, my grand-
daughter, who I thank for being present 
here, to my grandson: it concerns those who 
are the peers of my daughter, of my grand-
children; a new generation, particularly the 
youngest, those who are younger even than 
them. 
When the Second World War broke out, I 
was a teenager. My father was a soldier who 
had received a serious gunshot wound to the 
lung. It was a dramatic situation for our 
family. My mother came from the Polish- 
Lithuanian-Belarusian border, where armies 
had swept back and forth, plundering, 
looting, raping, burning villages so as to 
leave nothing for those who came after 
them. You might say I knew first-hand from 
my father and mother what war is. Yet de-
spite everything, although only 20 or 25 years 
had passed, it seemed as distant as the Pol-
ish uprisings of the 19th century; as distant 
as the French Revolution. 
When I meet young people today, I realize 
that after 75 years they seem a little weary 
of this topic: war, the Holocaust, genocide. I 
understand them. That is why I promise you, 
young people, that I will not tell you about 
my suffering. I will not tell you about my ex-
periences, my two death marches, how I 
ended the war weighing 32kg, exhausted, on 
the verge of death. I will not talk about the 
worst of it, that is, the tragedy of parting 
with loved ones after the selection, when you 
sensed what awaited them. No, I won’t talk 
about these things. I would like to talk to 
you about my daughter’s generation, and my 
grandchildren’s generation. 
I see that President of Austria Alexander 
Van der Bellen is among us. You will remem-
ber, Mr. President, when you hosted me and 
the leaders of the International Auschwitz 
Committee and we talked about those times. 
At one point you used the phrase: ‘Auschwitz 
isl nicht vom Himmel gefallen.’ Auschwitz 
did not descend from the sky. This is, to use 
a phrase of ours, an obvious obviousness. 
Of course it didn’t descend from the sky. 
Yet while this may seem a banal enough 
statement, it contains a profound and ex-
tremely important cognitive shortcut. Let 
us shift our imagination for a moment to 
Berlin in the early 1930s. We are almost in 
the 
city 
center, 
in 
a 
district 
called 
Bayerisches Viertel, the Bavarian Quarter. 
Three stops from Ku’damm; from the zoo. 
Where the Bayerischer Platz metro is today. 
And here, one day in the early 1930s, a sign 
appears on the benches: ‘Jews may not sit 
here.’ ‘Okay,’ you might think, ‘this is un-
pleasant, it’s unfair, it’s not nice, but after 
all there are so many benches around here, 
you can sit somewhere else, it’s fine.’ 
This was a district inhabited by German 
intelligentsia of Jewish origin. Albert Ein-
stein, Nobel laureate Nelly Sachs, the indus-
trialist, politician and Foreign Minister Wal-
ter Altenau lived there. One day a sign ap-
pears at the swimming pool. ‘Jews are for-
bidden to enter this swimming pool.’ ‘Okay,’ 
you might say, ‘this is unpleasant, but Ber-
lin has so many places to swim, so many 
lakes, canals—it’s practically Venice—so 
you can go and swim somewhere else.’ 
Then another sign appears. ‘Jews are not 
allowed to belong to German choral associa-
tions.’ So what? They want to sing and make 
music? Let them gather together and sing by 
themselves. Then another sign. ‘Jewish, non- 
Aryan children are not allowed to play with 
German, Aryan children.’ So they can play 
by themselves. And another. ‘We sell bread 
and other food products to Jews only after 
5pm.’ Okay, now this is a real hindrance be-
cause there’s less choice, but in the end you 
can still shop after 5pm. 
And here we start to get used to the idea 
that you can exclude someone. That you can 
stigmatize someone. That you can turn 
someone into an alien. Slowly, gradually, 
day by day, people begin to get used to it— 
victims, perpetrators, witnesses, those we 
call bystanders—all begin to get used to the 
idea that a minority that gave the world 
Einstein, Nelly Sachs, Heinrich Heine and 
the Mendelssohns is different, that these 
people can be pushed to the edges of society, 
that they are strangers, that they spread 
germs and start epidemics. These terrible, 
dangerous thoughts are the beginning of 
what happens next. 
The regime of the time plays things clev-
erly, meeting the demands of workers. The 
first of May wasn’t celebrated in Germany

before? Never mind, here you go. On leisure 
days, they introduce Kraft durch Freude— 
Strength Through Joy. Organized holidays 
for the workers. They vanquish unemploy-
ment and play on the strings of national dig-
nity: ‘Germany, rise from the shame of 
Versailles. Restore your pride.’ At the same 
time, the regime sees that the people are 
gradually overwhelmed by the anesthesia of 
indifference. They stop reacting to evil. And 
so, the regime can afford to accelerate the 
process of evil. 
From there, things accelerate. A ban on 
employing Jews. A ban on emigration. Then 
the evil spreads to the ghettos: to Riga; to 
Kaunas; to my ghetto, the to´dz´
ghetto— 
Litzmannstadt. Most of those there are sent 
to Kulmhof—Chetmno—where they will be 
murdered in gas vans, and the rest are sent 
to Auschwitz, where they will be murdered 
with Zyklon B in modern gas chambers. And 
here we see the truth of what President Van 
der Bellen said: ‘Auschwitz didn’t suddenly 
descend from the sky.’ Auschwitz crept up, 
pattered with small steps, came closer and 
closer, until the things that happened here 
began. 
My daughter, my granddaughter, peers of 
my daughter, peers of my granddaughter— 
perhaps you do not know the name of Primo 
Levi. Primo Levi was one of the most well- 
known prisoners of this camp. He once 
coined the phrase: ‘It happened, therefore it 
can happen, it can happen everywhere.’ 
I will share with you one personal memory. 
In 1965, I was in the United States of Amer-
ica on a scholarship during the fight for 
human rights, for civil rights, for rights for 
African Americans. I had the honor of taking 
part in the march from Selma to Mont-
gomery with Martin Luther King. When my 
fellow marchers found that I had been in 
Auschwitz, they asked me ‘Do you think 
that such a thing could only happen in Ger-
many? Or could it happen elsewhere?’ I told 
them: ‘It could happen to you. If civil rights 
are violated, if minority rights are not re-
spected and are abolished. If the law is vio-
lated, as happened in Selma, then such 
things could happen.’ What to do? You must 
do what you can. If you can defend the con-
stitution, defend your rights, defend your 
democratic order, defend the rights of mi-
norities —then you can overcome this. 
Most of us Europeans come from the 
Judeo-Christian 
tradition. 
Believers 
and 
non-believers alike accept the Ten Com-
mandments as the canon of our civilization. 
A friend of mine, Roman Kent, the president 
of the International Auschwitz Committee, 
who spoke here five years ago during the pre-
vious commemoration, could not be here 
today. He coined the ‘Eleventh Command-
ment,’ which stems from the experience of 
the Shoah, the Holocaust, the terrible epoch 
of contempt. It runs thus: ‘Thou shalt not be 
indifferent.’ 
And this is what I want to tell my daugh-
ter, what I want to tell my grandchildren. 
My daughter’s peers, my grandchildren’s 
peers, wherever they might live, in Poland, 
Israel, America, Western Europe, Eastern 
Europe. This is very important. Thou shalt 
not be indifferent in the face of lies about 
history. Thou shalt not be indifferent when 
the past is distorted for today’s political 
needs. Thou shalt not be indifferent when 
any minority faces discrimination. Majority 
rule is the essence of democracy, but democ-
racy also means that minority rights must 
be protected. Thou shalt not be indifferent 
when any authority violates the existing so-
cial contract. Be faithful to this command-
ment. To the Eleventh Commandment: thou 
shalt not be indifferent. 
Because if you are indifferent, you will not 
even notice it when upon your own heads, 
and upon the heads of your descendants, an-
other Auschwitz descends from the sky.

HONORING THE UPVALLEY FAM-
ILY CENTERS OF NAPA COUNTY 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize The 
UpValley Family Centers of Napa County for 
20 years of exceptional public service. 
Since 1999, UpValley Family Centers has 
been the primary trusted resource for low-in-
come and vulnerable households in Napa 
County. By partnering with different organiza-
tions in our community, it has built an impres-
sive infrastructure of over 40 regional agen-
cies that work together to provide access to a 
variety of services in our community. Such 
services include education and mentorship ini-
tiatives, immigration assistance, tax prepara-
tion, substance-use prevention programs, and 
case management services. 
Since 2005, the Family Centers have partici-
pated in the Internal Revenue Service’s Volun-
teer Income Tax Assistance program, making 
free tax-preparation assistance available for 
Napa residents. To date, their VITA program 
has brought more than $5 million in state and 
federal refunds back to our community. The 
UpValley Family Centers also provides li-
censed staff able to give immigration assist-
ance to non-citizen residents, including natu-
ralization assistance and permanent residence 
renewals. UpValley Centers have become an 
irreplaceable resource to our community and 
today, it serves thousands of individuals 
across Napa’s region. 
UpValley Family Center’s commitment to 
serving our community is truly remarkable. In 
addition to running programs that help working 
families build economic stability, UpValley Re-
source Centers provides life-saving disaster 
response and recovery services. These serv-
ices include updating state fire resources like 
CalFire, helping people apply for disaster un-
employment assistance, and bilingual informa-
tion about disaster assistance available to all 
community members. 
Madam Speaker, the UpValley Family Cen-
ters of Napa County is a dedicated source of 
support for northern Napa that has made great 
contributions to better our community. It is 
therefore fitting and proper that we honor this 
organization here today.

RECOGNIZING THE ACHIEVEMENTS 
OF RICHARD WAYNE PARKS 
HON. G. K. BUTTERFIELD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the accomplishments of a 
great North Carolinian, public servant, role 
model and recipient of the Rocky Mount Area 
Chamber of Commerce 2019 Distinguished 
Citizen Award, Mr. Richard Wayne Parks. 
Mr. Parks’ deep dedication to service and 
community protection led him to spend over 
30 years in the law enforcement field in Rocky 
Mount, North Carolina. His experience in-
cludes extensive expertise through his work 
with the Rocky Mount Police Department, 
Nash County Sheriffs Office, Rocky Mount Po-
lice Department and the Supreme Court of 
North Carolina Marshals Offices. 
Richard Parks experience also includes a 
wide range of training and education with insti-
tutions such as the Coastal Plains Law En-
forcement Academy, Police Law Institute (PLI) 
and the FBI-Law Enforcement Executive De-
velopment Association. He has also taken a 
Management Course for Law Enforcement Ex-
ecutives and was awarded the Intermediate 
Law Enforcement Certificate and the Ad-
vanced Law Enforcement Certificate. 
Mr. Parks demonstrated strong leadership 
skills through his state-level law enforcement 
program participation which includes involve-
ment between 2006 and 2010 with the NC 
FOP State Executive Board and the NC FOC 
State Legislative Committee and also his in-
volvement with the North State Law Enforce-
ment Officers Association, NC Peace Officers 
Memorial Day Steering Committee and the NC 
Police Executive’s Associations; all of which 
he serves as a current participant. 
Rocky Mount, Nash County, Edgecombe 
County and the State of North Carolina have 
all benefited from Mr. Parks’ advancement as 
a law enforcement professional, and also from 
his selfless commitment to community service. 
He has a remarkable track-record of service 
participation through his current membership 
with the North Carolina Fraternal Order of Po-
lice, North Carolina Peace Officers Memorial 
Day Ceremony Steering Committee, Jim Dick-
ens First Responders Appreciation Day Com-
mittee, NC Governor’s Task Force on Safer 
Schools, North Carolina Police Executive’s As-
sociation, Nash County Farmers Market Advi-
sory Board and the Westridge Swim Club 
Board of Directors. As referred to by many of 
his colleagues; ‘‘Ricky’’ also serves as a mem-
ber of the North State Law Enforcement Offi-
cers Association. As the only law enforcement 
association that minority officers could join 
when it was formed in 1952, Ricky Parks’ en-
listed in the Association to demonstrate that 
the inclusion of all people, regardless of race 
or gender and in all levels of law enforcement 
would lead to better and more productive law 
enforcement in all of the local communities 
across the State. 
With a long and strong history of local and 
state professional law enforcement experi-
ence, Richard Wayne Parks has earned the 
deep respect of his law enforcement col-
leagues. He is greatly admired for his leader-
ship and work as a law enforcement profes-
sional, his experience and expertise and his 
efforts to promote unity among law enforce-
ment officers regardless of the branch of serv-
ice. His efforts have surpassed law enforce-
ment support through his work to serve the 
needs of domestic abuse victims, those in 
need of substance abuse treatment, care for 
the homeless and numerous other community 
education and family care needs. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I 
recognize the remarkable achievements of 
one of North Carolina’s own, Mr. Richard 
Wayne Parks and I congratulate him on being 
the recipient of the Rocky Mount Area Cham-
ber of Commerce Distinguished Citizen Award.

RECOGNIZING TED HILLMER 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Ted Hillmer, Jr.’s 17 years of service as 
superintendent of Wilson’s Creek National Bat-
tlefield in Greene County, Missouri. The park 
commemorates the Battle of Wilson’s Creek, 
first major American Civil War engagement 
west of the Mississippi River on August 10, 
1861. Hillmer’s first experience at the park 
was in 1988, whereas project engineer he 
oversaw the construction of a brand-new vis-
itor center for the 2,100-acre national park, 
southeast of Republic, Missouri. 
Hillmer later returned to the park in 2003, 
where he worked for 17 years as park super-
intendent. He leaves the historic battlefield 
knowing that a new, vastly-improved, and ex-
panded visitors center, which he oversaw the 
design and planning, is scheduled for comple-
tion sometime in summer. The expanded visi-
tor’s center will include a wider array of arti-
facts from the battle and a far more expansive 
retelling of the almost 5-hour long battle that 
claimed 2500 lives. 
Hillmer has overseen a great increase in 
visitors and interest to the park since he be-
came superintendent. Last year saw 220,067 
people visit the historic park, including 3 class-
es from the Fort Leonard Wood. Without 
Hillmer’s oversight, or the staff and experts 
working to meticulously maintain the surviving 
documents and artifacts of the battle, these 
lessons would have been lost to history. 
Madam Speaker, the passion and hard work 
shown by Ted Hillmer, Jr. should be an exam-
ple to all of us. The legacy Ted Hillmer leaves 
behind will not be forgotten, both by the staff 
of Wilson’s Creek National Battlefield as well 
as the surrounding communities who cherish 
the historic site. I hope we can all join together 
in remembering him for his service, not only to 
the community, but to the continued remem-
brance of the victims of our civil war.

THE TEMPORARY REAUTHORIZA-
TION AND STUDY OF THE EMER-
GENCY 
SCHEDULING 
OF 
FENTANYL ANALOGUES ACT (S. 
3201) 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to S. 3201, The Temporary Reau-
thorization and Study of the Emergency 
Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act. 
Synthetic opioids such as fentanyl have 
caused tens of thousands of deaths in recent 
years and Congress has an obligation to con-
tinue to offer solutions to this ongoing public 
health crisis. Unfortunately, the measures 
taken in S. 3201 go too far in expanding man-
datory minimum sentencing and would place 
further burdens on our already-strained crimi-
nal justice system. 
S. 3201 extends the Drug Enforcement Ad-
ministration’s (DEA) ‘‘class-wide’’ scheduling 
of fentanyl-related substances, causing more 
individuals to be prosecuted seeking burden-
some and ineffective mandatory minimum sen-
tences. This expansion of DEA authority 
raises civil liberty concerns and has the poten-
tial of reversing meaningful criminal justice re-
form. 
In 2018, I was proud to vote in favor of the 
First Step Act (P.L. 115–391), bipartisan re-
form that overwhelmingly passed Congress 
and was eventually signed into law. Among 
other things, this bill addressed the growing bi-
partisan consensus that mandatory minimums 
are 
unsustainably 
costly 
and 
counter-
productive. Rather than building on this suc-
cess, S. 3201 expands outdated mandatory 
minimum sentences even for those caught 
with trace amounts of illicit fentanyl-related 
substances. This issue is particularly burden-
some because according to the U.S. Sen-
tencing Commission, roughly 85 percent of in-
dividuals charged with trafficking fentanyl were 
unaware that that they were in fact in posses-
sion of the illegal substance. 
All levels of government must continue to 
strive towards removing illicit fentanyl and 
fentanyl-related substances from our commu-
nities. However, any legislation that addresses 
this issue cannot simply overcorrect the prob-
lem and must instead form a sustainable drug 
enforcement strategy. 
Madam Speaker, I urged my colleagues to 
vote against The Temporary Reauthorization 
and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of 
Fentanyl Analogues Act.

HONORING THE LIFE OF HOWARD 
SKAVDAHL 
HON. ADRIAN SMITH 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, I 
honor the life of Howard Skavdahl, who re-
cently passed away. 
He was a native of Harrison, in Nebraska’s 
Third District, and is laid to rest with the select 
men and women of our armed services buried 
in Arlington Cemetery. 
He earned this honor through his valued 
service to our nation in World War II. 
During World War II, Howard Skavdahl 
served our country in England, France, and 
Germany as a meteorologist in the Army Air 
Corps. 
He continued in the Reserves until retiring in 
1965 as a Major. 
Major Skavdahl truly embodies our ‘‘greatest 
generation.’’ He had a lifelong passion for aer-
onautics. 
After completing his active duty military 
service, he completed his Masters Degree at 
the California Institute of Technology, and 
brought his aeronautical expertise to the pri-
vate sector at the Rand Corporation and Boe-
ing. 
While at Boeing, he was chief technical en-
gineer for two NASA airplanes, and worked on 
propulsion systems for the 747, 757, 767, and 
777. 
He retired in 1990 as the head of Boeing’s 
Propulsion Research Department. 
Besides his accomplishments, Mr. Skavdahl 
was known for his compassion for his family 
and friends. 
Throughout his life, he touched countless 
others, and is survived by his three sons, ten 
grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren. 
We are grateful for his service to our coun-
try.

Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate the Frances Ann Lutcher Theater

ruary 7, 1980, with a sold-out performance by 
the great pianist Liberace! 
I am proud to say that this outstanding the-
ater is located in the 36th Congressional Dis-
trict in the beautiful city of Orange, Texas. The 
Lutcher Theater is the largest Performing Arts 
Series from Houston to New Orleans, with an-
nual attendance of approximately 30,000 
adults and children. In its first 40 seasons, the 
theater has brought 1,026,285 patrons through 
their doors to experience a variety of events 
from Broadway to dance recitals, Willie Nelson 
to Blue Man Group, Riverdance to local read-
ing and declamation contests.

tional Endowment for the Arts, the Lutcher 
Theater most recently received a grant to 
produce a professional theater event for sec-
ondary students from Southeast Texas. This 
event will allow students to experience the 
performing arts world and potentially discover 
a life-long love of theater. Students can see 
the literature from their classrooms in action, 
for a full ‘page to stage’ experience, featuring 
professionally trained actors and actresses. 
The Lutcher Theater creates the opportunity to 
share the love of art and literature with the 
next generation. 
This theater is only one of four theaters in 
Texas having received with the Kennedy Cen-
ter Partners in Education designation. The 
Kennedy Center Partnership was established 
in 2003 to bring nationally accredited teaching 
artists to work with local educators, training 
them how to integrate the arts into their class-
room curriculum. 
Embracing their mission, Lutcher Theater is 
committed to providing professional entertain-
ment for the enlightenment and cultural growth 
of residents living in Southeast Texas. 
For 40 seasons, the Lutcher Theater has 
enriched the region with invaluable resources 
and opportunities for the study and enjoyment 
of the performing arts. I thank them for their 
continued support and dedication to both the 
city of Orange and Southeast Texas.

community member, Eizo Kobayashi as he 
celebrates his 88th birthday, a milestone of 
special esteem in the Japanese culture. 
Eizo Kobayashi was born in Oakland, Cali-
fornia in 1932. During World War II, Eizo’s 
family was interned and moved to the Topaz 
Relocation Center in Utah. As a 10-year-old 
Japanese American, Eizo was faced with insti-
tutionalized racism, the experiences of which 
would stay with him throughout his life. His 
memories during the three years his family 
was interned include his father being hospital-
ized and subsequently moved to another loca-
tion, while the rest of his family remained in 
Utah. Eizo would go out into the desert and 
collect shells, crystals, arrowheads and other 
artifacts he could find. Upon being released 
from the internment camp, the Kobayashi fam-
ily moved back to California where Eizo grad-
uated from Piedmont High School. He went on 
to study at the University of California, Berke-
ley where he received a Bachelor of Arts and 
a Community College Lifetime Teaching Cre-
dential. After graduation, Eizo served in the 
U.S. Army before turning his focus to law en-
forcement. In 1956, Eizo became a Deputy 
Probation Officer in the Adult Division of the 
Alameda County Probation Department. He 
later began working for the California Depart-
ment of Corrections in 1962 and moved up the 
ranks until he retired as a Unit Supervisor and 
District Administrator in 1995. 
While tirelessly pursuing professional suc-
cess, Eizo always understood the importance 
of family and community. Eizo and his wife, 
Mary, wed in 1965 and moved to Concord, 
California where they raised two daughters, 
Keiko and Tamiko. Not only is Eizo a dedi-
cated family man, but he is also passionate 
about his community. He has been the Presi-
dent of the Diablo Valley Chapter for the Japa-
nese American Citizens League, the Vice 
President of the Unity Foundation in Concord, 
President of the Concord Senior Citizens Club, 
and a board member of the Concord Ambas-
sadors. Additionally, in 1992 Eizo was ap-
pointed to the Police Facility Blue Ribbon Task 
Force. Eizo’s connection to the local commu-
nity is also exemplified by his contributions as 
a former columnist for the Contra Costa 
Times. Eizo continues his work to this day 
serving the homeless at the Concord Adult 
Homeless Shelter and is an appointed mem-
ber of the Contra Costa County Merit Board, 
a seat which he has held for the last 30 years. 
Eizo has always been a civic leader and 
has received the 1993 Humanitarian Award 
from the Unity Foundation, the 1994 Civil 
Rights Advocacy Award from the Concord 
Human Relations Commission, and the 1996 
City of Concord Mayor’s Award, among other 
awards. 
Eizo’s influence and strong moral character 
continue to foster a positive impact in the 
community. As a longtime friend and inspira-
tion, please join me in congratulating Eizo on 
his 88th birthday and his life of service and 
leadership.

HON. MIKE THOMPSON

Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with Representative 
JARED HUFFMAN to recognize Nancy Dobbs for 
years of exceptional public service to the peo-
ple of Northern California and to honor her at 
the Northern California Public Media 35th An-
niversary Celebration. 
Nancy Dobbs was born in Los Angeles,

versity. She has dedicated her career to help-
ing shape the health, education and civic en-
gagement of the North Bay. She has devel-
oped a variety of TV and radio programs to

media can act as a springboard for action to 
improve our region and our relationships with 
our neighbors. 
Ms. Dobbs is the Founder, President and 
CEO of Northern California Public Media, 
which works to empower individuals to explore 
their world with informative television, radio 
and other media programs. For 38 years, Ms. 
Dobbs has worked tirelessly to serve the Bay 
Area with a reliable news outlet and accurate 
news coverage. In 1994, she launched KRCB 
FM Radio 91, which is celebrating its 25th

complishments are board memberships with 
Roseland University Prep, North Bay Leader-
ship Council and California Public Television 
as the chairwoman. In addition, she has 
played a crucial role in the creation of the TV 
series ‘‘Natural Heroes,’’ which documents 
successful local efforts to be environmentally

Madam Speaker, Nancy Dobbs is a dedi-
cated seeker of truth who has made great

therefore fitting and proper that we honor her

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF LEO 
GOLDNER 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 6, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember the life of an extraordinary man, 
Leo Goldner. Leo lived a full life, brought joy 
to so many, and served as a valued member 
of the Toledo community. Today his family 
and friends gather to eulogize him, and I 
would like to read his obituary into the 
RECORD on this day: 
‘‘Leo Goldner was born in Toledo Hospital 
on July 3rd, 1923, son of Herman and Margret 
Fleichocher Goldner and brother to his be-
loved sister. For many years the Goldner’s 
lived above their family dry goods store 
called the Chicago Bargain House. 
‘‘He lived in a Hungarian immigrant neigh-
borhood in East Toledo and learned to speak 
fluent Hungarian. He was an avid Stamp col-
lector and a Yo Yo champion. 
‘‘Leo was the only Jewish boy in his ele-
mentary and high school and learned to de-
fend himself against neighborhood bullies by 
learning Judo and quickly worked his way 
up to Black Belt 5th degree status. He had 
release parochial time in elementary school, 
but instead of taking two buses to go to his 
synagogue, he agreed at the request of the 
Monsignor of St. Stephen’s Church to be-
come an altar boy at St. Stephens Church, 
an interesting choice for a Jewish boy. 
‘‘There are pictures of Leo hanging in 
Waite High School and in St. Stephen’s 
Church where he donated the bronze statue 
of St. Stephen, which still stands there out 
front today on Genesee Street. He graduated 
from Waite High School as a member of the 
National Honors Society. 
‘‘Leo attended the University of Toledo to 
study pre-law, was on the wrestling and ten-
nis team, and joined the Lamda Chi frater-
nity. Upon the invasion of Pearl Harbor, he 
enlisted in the U.S. Army. There, as a lowly 
private, he was eventually sent to officer’s 
candidate school to become a Lieutenant. 
‘‘In the Army, he served under General 
George C. Marshall as chief of staff and 
helped liberate the Philippines under Gen-
eral Douglas MacArthur where he was in-
jured in hand to hand combat. He had no less 
than 12 medals and five decorations, includ-
ing the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. 
‘‘He served as director of USO Camp Shows 
in the Western Pacific after being wounded 
in battle. He was an expert Magician and 
Hypnotist. 
‘‘During the time he was an infantry offi-
cer, he used two three day passes to marry 
the love of his life Marian Rachel Baron, to 
whom he was married for 76 years. 
‘‘After being discharged from the Army, he 
worked at the family dry goods store, but 
really wanted to have a store of his own. He 
accepted a job offer from his brother-in-law, 
Jerry Baron at Baron Steel Company. There 
he flourished as a salesman, making an un-
heard-of million dollars for the firm his very 
first year. Later, he and his brother-in-law 
Sidney Baron, started Tyler Steel, in 1953. 
Two years later, Leo started Parker Steel 
Company, which today is the number one 
distributor of metric metals in the nation. 
Leo and Marian began their married life in 
a house on Vermont Street in Toledo. In 1955 
they built a home in Ottawa Hills. He in-
cluded in the home a Theater room where he 
could perform magic tricks. 
He was past president of the Association of 
Steel distributors and a founding member of 
Magician Ring 68, Toledo, Ohio. He was the 
longest living member of the International 
Brotherhood of Magicians (where he was 
awarded the Order of Merlin), which he 
joined on his 16th birthday. 
Leo and his wife Marian were founding 
members of the Toledo Chapter of Hillel at 
the University of Toledo. He did hundreds of 
Hypnosis demonstrations benefiting Waite 
High School and raised over $200,000 for 
scholarships. 
For well over 34 years, he was the State of 
Israel Bond Chairman for NW Ohio and trav-
eled to Israel over 20 times. He was on the 
National Board of Myasthenia Gravis Foun-
dation, the Darlington House, (home for the 
aged) the Elks Club, the Kiwanis, a 32nd de-
gree Mason, the Damaseus Lodge, as well as 
a member of Temple B’nai Israel, Temple 
Shomer Emunim, Congregation Etz Chayim, 
and the American Israel Policy Conference. 
‘‘Leo was also a member of the American 
Society of Clinical Hypnotists, the National

Guild of Hypnotists Gold Baton Group at To-
ledo Symphony Orchestra, the President’s 
Council of the Toledo Museum of Art, and 
the Ohio Governor’s Club. 
‘‘He is listed in Who’s Who in America and 
is a member of the Jewish Community Cen-
ter, where he taught Judo for many years. 
He was an avid boater and fisherman. 
‘‘Leo was President of Parker Steel Com-
pany, a board member of Temple Shomer 
Emunim, Couples Club Co-chair, and Chair-
man of the board of the Footlighters’ Club of 
South Florida which raises money for indi-
gent entertainers and musicians. He and 
Marian had many joyous years at the family 
cottage, the Squeezum Inn, on Kelleys Is-
land. 
‘‘Leo and Marian spent many winters in 
their home in the Florida Keys, before mov-
ing to Aventura, FL for the last 16 years. 
‘‘When asked if he had any regrets, Leo 
said: 
‘Not really, I really don’t have any regrets. 
I’ve lived my life enjoying every minute. I’ve 
tried to enjoy every minute. I don’t know 
when it’s going to end, but I don’t want any-
one to feel sorry for me when I’m gone. I’ve 
enjoyed every minute and accomplished ev-
erything I ever wanted to do. As far as I’m 
concerned, they can dance and celebrate a 
life well lived at my funeral.’ 
‘‘Leo is survived by his wife Marian; his 
four children, Paul (Linda Bender, Sandra 
Soifer), Harriet (aka Camryn Lee), Marcia 
Alter and Janet Killam (Michael); his grand-
children, 
Andrea 
DeMar 
(David), 
Mark 
Goldner, Sharon Tipping (Michael), Olivia 
Potash (Daniel), and Jordan Killam; and his 
great-grandchildren, Lauren, Noah and Re-
becca DeMar, Talia, Emma, and Abigail Tip-
ping and Omri Potash.’’ 
Leo Goldner was a fine man and will be re-
membered admirably by all those who knew 
him. We offer his family and friends our 
prayers and hope that they find comfort in 
the wonderful memories of what Leo meant 
to each of the people who shared in his life.
