DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

I hereby appoint the Honorable ANTHONY

f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Lord, we believe, help our unbelief. 
We bow our heads in prayer and yet we 
remain skeptical that You are listen-
ing. For despite our urgent pleas for 
peace, war rages throughout the world. 
Even though we depend on You to 
make sense of the confusion around us, 
nonetheless we cannot see that You are 
always near, even in the chaos. 
Holy God, show us the mercy You 
showed Thomas. Though we are blinded 
by doubt, reveal Yourself to us. Though 
we demand answers, need proof, in 
Your mercy show us the evidence of 
Your constant presence among us. 
Blessed are those who have not, can-
not see—yet believe: for people whose 
lives are upturned by terror tragedy 
and yet stand firm in their faith, those 
who lift up their voices in prayer and 
supplication, sure that You will re-
spond to them in their need. 
May their belief serve as our founda-
tion when our own faith falters. Then 
may we, though we cannot see, pro-
claim, in our word and deed, the hope 
to be found in Your salvation. 
In the strength of Your name, we be-
lieve and offer our prayers this day. 
Amen. 
f

April 21, 2022 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF CAPTAIN JAMES H. PATTON, 
JR. 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 21, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of United States Naval 
Captain James H. Patton, Jr. Captain Patton 
passed away last year on September 27, 
2021, at his home in North Stonington, Con-
necticut. I have had the distinct pleasure of 
connecting with Captain Patton over the years 
and can personally attest to his distinguished 
character, major contributions to policy con-
versations on our nation’s submarine force, 
and participation and care for his local com-
munity. 
Born on January 6, 1939, to James H. Sr. 
and Suzanne Patton in Norwood, Massachu-
setts, James had the spirit of a New 
Englander through and through. Due to his 
shrewd and strong character, it was no sur-
prise that James went on to attend the U.S. 
Naval Academy, where he graduated in 1960. 
Upon graduation, James immediately set sail 
on his military career, dedicating the next 25 
years of his life toward faithful leadership with-
in our nation’s Navy. It was during these years 
that he became an incredible bank of knowl-
edge with respect to our nation’s submarine 
force, serving on five nuclear-powered attack 
submarines, two ballistic-missile submarines, 
and commanding the USS Pargo. By the time 
of his retirement from the Navy, his merited 
service had earned him the rank of Captain as 
well as several accolades, including the Le-
gion of Merit and the National Defense Serv-
ice Medal. 
Captain Patton’s dedication to the strength 
of our nation’s Navy was never intended to 
end with his retirement from the military. Upon 
his departure in 1985, our region became 
lucky enough for Captain Patton to discover 
North Stonington as a place to call his perma-
nent home. As a newfound resident, Captain 
Patton would go on to leverage his extensive 
experience with the Navy and found his own 
advocacy firm, Submarine Tactics & Tech-
nology, Inc. It was through this medium and 
his several published materials that Captain 
Patton championed advancing the narrative on 
investing in our ‘‘Silent Service,’’ directly con-
tributing to our region’s existence as a manu-
facturing powerhouse as well as the position 
of naval strength which we continue to benefit 
from to this day. 
As a resident of North Stonington, Captain 
Patton made sure his outgoing personality 
also enriched his local community. For in-
stance, he was not only a member of but a 
valuable contributor to the Naval Submarine 
League, North Stonington Lions Club and the 
Education Foundation. Truly, it was always in 
his nature to lend a helping hand. 
Madam Speaker, as the representative of 
eastern Connecticut, I cannot think of a citizen 
more outstanding than Captain James H. Pat-
ton, Jr. The quarter of a century dedicated to 
serving our nation is commendable by itself, 
but James continued to demonstrate excep-
tional civic duty even upon his initial retire-
ment. Our entire southeastern Connecticut 
community continues to mourn his loss to this 
day. I find gratitude in the fact that his sur-
viving family has stood strong in bearing the 
standard of his memory, namely, his wife Mary 
Patton, three children Terry Rhoads, John Pat-
ton and James Patton III, sister Mary Cobbett, 
and numerous grandchildren, nieces and 
nephews. In particular, I have had the oppor-
tunity to get to know James III, who has fol-
lowed the example of his fathers informed 
idealism to serve overseas to promote peace-
ful sustainable international development all 
over the globe. The invaluable contributions of 
Captain Patton’s life and legacy will continue 
to impact our nation’s security and his local 
community for generations to come. To these 
ends, I ask that my colleagues in the House 
join me in honoring Captain James Patton, 
Jr.’s incredible life of service.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
BREASTFEEDING MOTHERS JURY 
DUTY EXCLUSION ACT OF 2022 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 21, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to introduce the Breastfeeding Mothers Jury 
Duty Exclusion Act of 2022, which would allow 
breastfeeding mothers summoned for jury 
service in federal court or in the Superior 
Court of the District of Columbia to be ex-
cused from service for the period they are 
breastfeeding upon the individual’s request. 
The benefits of breastfeeding are well-docu-
mented, and breastfeeding mothers should not 
be deterred from breastfeeding by jury service. 
The District of Columbia Home Rule Act 
prohibits the D.C. Council from enacting any 
law relating to title 11 of the D.C. Code. Title 
11 governs jury service. Therefore, this bill is 
necessary to provide this exclusion for both 
the federal and D.C. courts. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
f 
REMEMBERING DR. JOEL B. WOOD 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 21, 2022 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Dr. Joel B. Wood, who 
passed away on Thursday, March 31, 2022, at 
the age of 51. 
Joel was born on July 19, 1970, in 
Wellsboro, PA, a son of the late Sonny and 
Twilla Wood. 
He was a graduate of CV High School in 
Westfield, PA, and continued his education at 
Edinboro University receiving his BA in Busi-
ness and English, and his MA in Counseling 
Psychology. He worked at Northshore Psycho-
logical Associates of Erie, PA where he was a 
Clinical Psychologist and a loyal advocate for 
his patients. 
Outside of work, he was a history buff, es-
pecially for Presidential history. He loved vis-
iting historical sites, museums, cemeteries, 
presidential gravesites, and maintaining the 
Packard family graves in Warren, OH. He was 
an avid flower gardener, a voracious reader, 
enjoyed listening to music, and had a great 
love for animals, especially cats. 
Joel will be deeply missed by his partner, 
Charles Ohlin; brothers, Kenneth Lampman II 
and Dan (Lori) Wood; nieces and nephews, 
Summer (Jeff) Hunter, who he adored and 
mentored, Shane (Sarah) Lampman, Danielle 
(Aaron) Marsh, Morgan and Kyle Mills, and 
Olivia and Makenzie Lampman; many great- 
nieces and nephews; and his cats Josie and 
Simon.

Firearm Safe Storage Act. This legislation 
takes important steps to keep our children and 
our communities safe from unsecured fire-
arms. 
On May 18, 2018, Kimberly Vaughan was 
among eight students and two teachers who 
were shot and killed at Santa Fe High School 
in Texas. Thirteen others were wounded. The 
shooter was a 17-year-old who brought a 
shotgun and a .38 caliber pistol from his home 
to commit this heinous crime. Neither weapon 
was stored securely and placed the lives of all 
these students in jeopardy. 
Sadly, school shootings like the one that oc-
curred in Santa Fe have become horrifyingly 
familiar. In 80 percent of school shootings in-
volving a shooter under 18 years old, the gun 
was taken from the home of family or friends. 
Some of these shootings may have been pre-
vented if the weapons were securely stored 
and made inaccessible to minors. Unsecured 
firearms also increase the risk of unintentional 
shootings and suicide. 
On average, eight children are killed every 
day by improperly stored or misused guns. 
The American Academy of Pediatrics rec-
ommends that if parents keep firearms in their 
home, all firearms should be locked, unloaded, 
and stored separately from ammunition. How-
ever, only 3 of 10 adults in households with 
children report storing all guns unloaded and 
locked up. It is estimated that 4.6 million

American children live in a home with at least 
one unlocked, loaded firearm. 
The Kimberly Vaughan Firearm Safe Stor-
age Act encourages responsible firearm stor-
age to make our communities safer. This leg-
islation would require the Department of Jus-
tice to establish and publish voluntary best 
practices for safe firearm storage. It requires a 
label or notice on most firearms at purchase 
that says, ‘‘Safe Storage Saves Lives’’ and in-
cludes the website where the Department of 
Justice’s best practices can be found. It also 
requires Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to 
have compatible safe storage devices avail-
able for purchase for every handgun, rifle, or 
shotgun that they sell. The bill authorizes $10 
million in grants every year for 10 years to 
state, local, and tribal governments to dis-
tribute safe firearm storage devices. Finally, 
this legislation incorporates the Prevent Family 
Fire Act, authored by Congressman MIKE 
LEVIN, which establishes a 10 percent tax 
credit to FFLs for safe storage devices sold for 
up to $400 to encourage the sale of these de-
vices. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in keeping 
our children safe from unsecured firearms by 
supporting this important legislation.

HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 21, 2022 
Mr. 
LUETKEMEYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize Missouri’s Third Dis-
trict Eldon High School Volleyball teams from 
1980 to 1996 in my home district for being in-
ducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. 
This accomplishment is not one to be taken 
lightly and reflects the Eldon community dedi-
cation to youth athletics and the sport of 
volleyball. 
Their induction into the Missouri Sports Hall 
of Fame is a testament to the impact Eldon 
High School Volleyball has made on high 
school sports in Missouri. One of the best eras 
in Missouri high school sports history running 
from 1980 to 1996 with an astounding 14 dis-
trict titles in this span of time and eight straight 
final four berths also winning the Class 3 state 
title in 1991. Eleven different players received 
AllState recognition and Coach Ann Gulshen 
has been inducted into the Missouri Sports 
Hall of Famer. 
You likely will not find a team more deserv-
ing of this tremendous achievement. The im-
pact it has made on high school sports in Mis-
souri cannot go unnoticed. 
Madam Speaker please join me in congratu-
lating Eldon High School’s Volleyball teams 
from 1980 to 1996 for being inducted into the 
Missouri Sports Hall of Fame.

PRESIDENT 
AND 
CEO 
EMILY 
BARR 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 21, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize President and Chief Execu-
tive Officer Emily L. Barr on the occasion of 
her retirement from Graham Media Group 
after a decade of stellar work. Her service to 
our community is worthy of commendation. 
A native of Massachusetts, Mrs. Barr’s ca-
reer has been nothing short of exemplary. She 
began her career in broadcasting in 1980 as 
a news editor in St. Paul, Minnesota, before 
working as a writer and producer at a station 
in Washington, D.C. Until 1988, Mrs. Barr 
served as the Director of Creative Services 
and Advertising and Promotion Manager at 
KHOU–TV in Houston, Texas. In 1988, she 
became the Director of Broadcast Operations 
and Programming at WMAR–TV in Baltimore, 
Maryland. Later, she led the ABC-owned sta-
tion in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina as the 
President and General Manager before she 
became President and General Manager of 
ABC 7 Chicago. In 2012, Mrs. Barr joined 
Graham Media Group, which includes WDIV 
Detroit, as the President and Chief Executive 
Officer. Her work propelled Graham Media 
Group to evolve from a broadcast-based 
model to seven local media hubs. She led the 
acquisition of top social media software, and 
developed Graham Digital, a digital media and 
technology development group in Detroit. Her 
fierce dedication to her work has transformed 
Graham Media Group to represent nearly 7 
percent of coverage in the United States. 
As a leader in our community, Mrs. Barr’s 
work did not end in the broadcasting space. 
She has been a leader for women wherever 
she has been and has supported civic causes 
throughout her career. At home, she led city-
wide efforts to raise funds for the Haitian 
earthquake relief effort and serves on the 
Board of Trustees at her alma mater, Carleton 
College in Minnesota. Mrs. Barr is also the re-
cipient of numerous awards and honors, in-
cluding the Broadcaster of the Year Award, 
the Vincent T. Wasilewski Broadcaster of the 
Year 
Award, 
the 
Distinguished 
Alumni 
Achievement Award, the Golden Mike Award, 
and holds an Honorary Doctorate from Robert 
Morris University. Amongst this, she has been 
inducted into the Silver Circle of the Chicago/ 
Midwest Chapter of the National Academy of 
Television Arts and Sciences and will be elect-
ed to the Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame 
this Spring. Mrs. Barr currently resides with 
her husband Scott and two daughters in Chi-
cago. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Mrs. Emily Barr for her out-
standing career. She has led with compassion 
and integrity, ensuring the success of Graham 
Media Group and has been an innovative 
leader in media for over two decades and who 
truly cares about the Midwest. I join with Mrs. 
Barr’s family, friends, and colleagues in ex-
tending my best wishes to her in retirement. 
HONORING THE WILTON VOLUN-
TEER 
FIRE 
DEPARTMENT 
ON 
THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS 
FOUNDING 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 21, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and celebrate the Wilton Volun-
teer Fire Department on the 75th anniversary 
of its founding. This fire department has 
shown tremendous dedication to protecting 
and serving the town of Wilton as well as the 
surrounding municipalities in Saratoga County. 
The Wilton Volunteer Fire Department held 
their first unofficial meeting, comprised of 
twenty members, on September 17, 1947. The 
Wilton Town Board then approved a com-
mittee of six commissioners, who held their 
first charter meeting on October 1, 1947. De-
spite limited funding and resources, Wilton’s 
first group of volunteers overcame these ob-
stacles and soon raised enough funds to pur-
chase their first truck, a 1944 United States 
Navy vehicle that had been in service in WWII 
and became known as ‘‘713.’’ 
In the years that followed, the Department 
grew and evolved within the community but 
never lost touch with their history. Today, 
Truck 713 is still proudly displayed at the main 
station, though it has been retired from active 
service. The Department has now expanded 
its fleet to include a variety of modern vehicles 
capable of responding to any emergency. 
The Department now employs an extremely 
diverse group of members. Still relying exclu-
sively on volunteers, members range in age 
from teenage recruits to veteran members, 
some of whom have been on the job since 
nearly the beginning. William E. Morgan is the 
longest serving member in the Department’s 
history with sixty-seven years of firefighting in 
Wilton under his belt. Mr. Morgan, along with 
the rest of the Wilton volunteer firefighters, 
serve their community exceptionally. On behalf 
of New York’s 21st Congressional District, I 
am honored to recognize and thank the Wilton 
Volunteer Fire Department on their 75th anni-
versary.

HONORING 
JASON 
BOUDREAUX, 
JALEAHA 
JOSEPH, 
AND 
SHONTENAISHA MANUEL AS 2022 
C–SPAN STUDENTCAM COMPETI-
TION WINNERS 
HON. CLAY HIGGINS 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 21, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam Speak-
er, I would like to honor three constituents of 
mine who were recently recognized as win-
ners of the C–SPAN StudentCam documen-
tary competition. 
Jason Boudreaux, Jaleaha Joseph, and 
Shontenaisha Manuel, students at College 
Street Vocational Center in Lake Charles, LA, 
were chosen as first prize winners in the Cen-
tral region. The students were tasked with ex-
plaining how the federal government impacts 
their daily lives, and they competed against 
thousands of other participants across the na-
tion. 
Jason, Jaleaha, and Shontenaisha’s docu-
mentary, ‘‘FEMA’s Impact on Our Lives in 
Southwest Louisiana,’’ was powerful and mov-
ing. The students highlighted the devastating 
impacts of Hurricanes Laura and Delta and 
shared their personal experiences with FEMA 
as their families sought to recover. Their sto-
ries and experiences are those shared by 
many families across Southwest Louisiana. 
However, despite the devastation to our com-
munity, the students also showcased the 
strength and resilience of Louisiana’s citizenry. 
I commend these students for their hard 
work, determination, and exemplary story-
telling abilities. 
They crafted a powerful narrative that told 
the story of Southwest Louisiana and thought-
fully explained FEMA’s role in our recovery 
mission. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the citizens of 
Louisiana’s 3rd District, I congratulate Jason 
Boudreaux, 
Jaleaha 
Joseph, 
and 
Shontenaisha Manuel on their achievements 
in the C–SPAN StudentCam documentary 
competition. I thank them for sharing their sto-
ries, and I wish each of them great success in 
the future.

IN RECOGNITION OF MARY 
DIERICH 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 21, 2022 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate Mary Dierich on her recent selec-
tion as a 2022 Fellow of the American Asso-
ciation of Nurse Practitioners (AANP). 
AANP Fellows have a direct impact on the 
communities they serve by engaging with 
nurse practitioners (NPs) from around the 
country to lead new initiatives while also sup-
porting the mission of AANP. Additionally, 
these Fellows play a critical role in the 
mentorship and development of other NPs. At 
a time when every level of our health care 
sector is struggling with recruitment and reten-
tion, this cultivation of talented NPs is abso-
lutely essential to our entire health infrastruc-
ture. 
Mary is a stellar embodiment of what an 
AANP Fellow should be. A proud holder of 
multiple degrees from the University of Min-
nesota, including a PhD from the School of 
Nursing, Mary was a Clinical Associate Pro-
fessor at her alma matter for over sixteen 
years. She has also worked on the frontlines 
at HealthPartners for the last fourteen years 
serving as a Geriatric Nurse Practitioner. In 
the early days of the pandemic, Mary was a 
critical resource to me and my office as we 
sought real-time analysis from frontline work-
ers who saw COVID–19 unfold. This was 
helpful to understand the PPE shortages fac-
ing health care professionals and the re-
sources they needed to keep our communities 
safe. We all owe a debt of gratitude to Mary 
and her fellow frontline workers for the amaz-
ing selflessness they have exhibited over the 
last two and a half years. 
It is no wonder why Mary Dierich has been 
selected for this prestigious opportunity at 
AANP. I look forward to AANP’s Induction 
Ceremony which will take place in Orlando, 
Florida on June 23, 2022. Madam Speaker, 
please join me in honoring the achievements 
of a great nurse practitioner and a beloved 
member of my family.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
LISA TROLAN 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 21, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend the career of Lisa Trolan, 
who retired from her work with General Dy-
namics Electric Boat, on December 23, 2021. 
Madam Speaker, Ms. Trolan retires from a 
long, dedicated career that spans 35 years 
with Electric Boat. As a senior member of 
Electric Boat’s Public Affairs team, Lisa wel-
comed thousands of visitors to the company’s 
locations in Connecticut and Rhode Island and 
helped to highlight the skilled workforce of 
technological marvels produced by Electric 
Boat. In doing so, Lisa has acted as a staunch 
advocate for our community, representing a 
major employer within the region to attract 
businesses, suppliers, and employees alike. 
A Groton, Connecticut native and a grad-
uate of the University of Connecticut, Lisa has 
lived out a destiny of nurturing the growth of 
the very community that raised her. These 
foundational values trace all the way back to 
her upbringing under her parents, Julio and 
Frances, who also served the Town of Groton 
well through their longstanding, respective 
roles with Groton Utilities and the Public 
School system. It is no coincidence that Elec-
tric Boat’s Connecticut headquarters is in 
Groton. It is also no surprise that even in re-
tirement, Lisa remains an active supporter of 
local civic organizations as well as the Univer-
sity of Connecticut. 
Madam Speaker, Lisa’s legacy with Electric 
Boat—one of excellence and commitment to 
its employees, the Navy and the nation—is 
unrivaled. She has always prioritized giving 
back to her foundations and has played a di-
rect part in adding oil to the economic engine 
that is Electric Boat. With his departure, our 
region and Electric Boat can find comfort in 
the sound supply chain infrastructure that he 
directly brought about. To that end, I ask that 
my colleagues in the House join me in con-
gratulating Lisa Trolan on her well-earned re-
tirement.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DEPART-
MENT OF THE TREASURY OFFI-
CER PROTECTION ACT OF 2022 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 21, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I introduce 
the Department of the Treasury Officer Protec-
tion Act of 2022. This bill would help ensure 
the safety of Treasury Department police offi-
cers by allowing them, including those who 
work at the Mint and the Bureau of Engraving 
and Printing (BEP), to carry their government 
firearms home. 
BEP officers were among the first respond-
ers when a gunman opened fire at the United 
States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 2009. 
However, BEP officers also can be targets be-
cause they wear uniforms to and from work. 
Many BEP officers carry personal firearms to 
and from work because they are not allowed 
to take their government firearms home, and 
some are forced to leave those personal fire-
arms in their cars while they are on duty, cre-
ating a possibly dangerous situation. 
Allowing BEP officers to carry their govern-
ment firearms home will put them in the same 
position as Mint officers. Although both agen-
cies are under the Treasury Department, 
under Treasury Department rules, Mint officers 
are allowed to carry their government firearms

home, while BEP officers are not. There is no 
meaningful distinction between officers for 
these two agencies. They should be treated 
equally. 
This bill would allow all uniformed officers in 
the Treasury Department to carry their govern-
ment firearms home to protect officers and the 
public and so that the Treasury Department 
does not have separate rules for different law 
enforcement agencies under its umbrella. 
I ask my colleagues to support this bill.

INTRODUCTION OF THE SECURING 
PROTECTIONS AGAINST CARBON 
EMISSIONS (SPACE) TAX ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 21, 2022 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Securing Protections Against 
Carbon Emissions (SPACE) Tax Act so that 
the federal government taxes commercial 
space travel like it taxes commercial aviation. 
For months, the American public has wit-
nessed billionaires and celebrities with enough 
money to vaccinate entire countries, end 
homelessness, cure diseases, or feed a nation 
launch themselves into space to gain notoriety 
and create a new space tourism industry. 
These launches are yet another example of 
the disturbing trend in rising wealth inequality 
in the United States. 
As this nascent industry takes shape, Amer-
icans cannot overlook the environmental im-
pact of sending humans into space, particu-
larly when there is no scientific value associ-
ated with the launch. While proponents of sub-
orbital space flights point to transatlantic flights 
as having similar carbon footprints, these 
flights carry significantly more passengers and 
travel much farther. The result is space 
launches that account for an estimated 60- 
times greater emissions than transatlantic 
flights on a per-passenger basis. That is 
enough to drive a car around the earth and 
more than twice the carbon budget rec-
ommended in the Paris climate accord. 
The SPACE Tax Act addresses these envi-
ronmental and fairness concerns by estab-
lishing a new excise tax regime on commercial 
space flights that is structured like the excise 
taxes we all pay for commercial aviation. 
The legislation would establish a 10 percent 
per-passenger tax on the price of a commer-
cial flight to space. It also includes a two- 
tiered excise tax for each commercial launch 
carrying humans into space that is based on 
distance above the Earth’s surface. 
The SPACE Tax Act makes our tax code 
fairer, ends the tax holiday on space travel, 
and is part of the policy prescription to ensure 
that billionaires are paying their fair share. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF JOE 
BARRATT 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 21, 2022 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of Joe Barratt. 
Throughout his life, Joe’s compassion, kind-
ness, and creativity were evident to all who 
knew him. He had a passion for music and 
was a talented musician. Joe played cello for 
Concord High School’s orchestra, taught him-
self how to play guitar, and was a talented 
songwriter and producer. His other interests 
included astrology and spending time with his 
friends in Todos Santos Plaza and Civic Park. 
An animal lover, Joe also enjoyed helping his 
mother, Leslie, walk dogs on the weekends. 
One of their favorite traditions was to stop at 
IHOP afterwards and Joe would indulge in the 
red velvet pancakes. 
Joe had an extraordinary ability to help oth-
ers feel accepted and cared for. He was wel-
coming and warm to kids that needed extra 
love and kindness. He has been described as 
a ‘‘shepherd amongst the misfit kids at 
school’’. 
Tragically, Joe was killed in a hit-and-run 
accident and passed away on February 11, 
2020. He is survived by his mother and father, 
Leslie and Joe Barratt II. He will be remem-
bered for his gentle spirit and outstanding 
character. Please join me in honoring the life 
of Joe Barratt.

Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Elizabeth Mary Kilpatrick (ne´e 
O’Connell), 
originally 
of 
Cleveland, 
who 
passed away at her home in Prospect 
Heights, Illinois this week at the age of 82. 
Elizabeth was the beloved wife of the late 
Thomas L. Kilpatrick for 56 years. The loving 
mother of Kevin (Patricia), Kimberly and Kerry 
Kilpatrick. Dear grandmother of Molly, Gra-
ham, Logan, and Chandler. Beloved daughter 
of the late Francis and Sue O’Connell. Adored 
sister of Dennis (late Bonnie) O’Connell, Patri-
cia (William) Smith, Timothy (late Phyllis) 
O’Connell, and Suzanne O’Connell. Sister-in- 
law to Daniel (Barbara) Kilpatrick and Joanne 
(Jim) Mortensen. Loving aunt, cousin, and 
friend to many. 
Liz was a longtime member of the Buffalo 
Grove Garden Club, an avid shopper, and a 
serious holiday decorator. She was always 
proud to celebrate her Irish heritage and her 
Catholic faith. 
Mrs. Kilpatrick was a supporter of mine and 
was the great aunt to my friend and former 
staffer, Sean F. Lowe. My deepest condo-
lences go out to Elizabeth’s immediate family, 
the entire Kilpatrick and O’Connell families, 
and to all whose lives Elizabeth so deeply 
touched. May her memory be a blessing.

HONORING 
MICHAEL 
J. 
PERRY 
FOR FORTY YEARS OF SERVICE 
AT SUNY CANTON 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 21, 2022 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and commemorate the life of 
Michael J. Perry, known to his students as 
‘‘Poppa Mike,’’ for 40 years of diligent service 
to SUNY Canton. 
Mr. Perry joined the SUNY Canton family in 
1976 and served the students until his retire-
ment in 2016. From Bookstore Manager to Ex-
ecutive Director of the College Association, 
Mr. Perry held many roles that established his 
supportive presence on campus. He was a 
member of the Canton College Foundation as 
well as both the Eastern and National Asso-
ciations of Auxiliary Services. Upon retirement, 
Mr. Perry served as Town Supervisor for the 
Town of Hermon from 2020 until 2022. He re-
mained actively involved with SUNY Canton 
by keeping score at their basketball games 
and advocating for student success. 
Students remember Mr. Perry as a strong 
advocate for their well-being and a major culti-
vator of their college experience. Many credit 
him for inspiring their passion for student lead-
ership. For years, he organized the famous 
hot air balloon rides on Family Weekend and 
helped create numerous scholarships and en-
rollment opportunities. His colleagues will re-
member him as a unique and quick problem 
solver that helped their school thrive through-
out many pivotal periods. 
Mr. Perry is survived by his four children 
and seven grandchildren, all who will undoubt-
edly carry on his legacy of service and en-
couragement. On behalf of New York’s 21st 
District, I want to honor and remember Mi-
chael Perry for his four decades of dedication 
to the students and communities of the North 
Country.
