PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Loving God, in these days when so 
much of our experience is of disunity 
and 
disparagement, 
coldheartedness 
and hatred, we pray Your guidance in 
our attempts to find unity in spirit and 
love for one another. 
When all around us seems to encour-
age mean-spirited retorts and arrogant 
attitudes, may we be of tender heart 
and humble mind. 
Give us courage that we would not 
yield to the desire to repay evil for evil 
or to even the score of abuse with even 
more abuse. 
Rather, give us the wealth of faith to 
repay each insult, affront, indignity, 
barb, and slur, with blessing. 
Cast Your eyes on the righteous, O 
Lord, and open Your ears to our pray-
ers. 
It is in Your merciful name we pray. 
Amen.

account for inflation. The proposed rental rate is fully serviced including all operating expenses, whether paid by the 
lessor or directly by the Government. GSA will conduct the procurement using prevailing market rental rates as a 
benchmark for the evaluation of competitive ofters and as the basis for negotiating with offerors to ensure that lease 
award is made in the best interest of the Government. 
2 New leases may contain an escalation clause to provide for annual changes in real estate taxes and operating costs.

Acquisition Strategy 
PROSPECTUS-LEASE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE 
NORTHERN,VA 
PBS 
Prospectus Number: 
PVA-01-WA22 
Congressional District: 
8, 10,11 
To maximize the flexibility and competition in acquiring space for DoD and its sub-
agencies, GSA may issue a single, multiple-award solicitation that will allow offerors to 
provide blocks of space able to meet requirements in whole or in part. All offers must 
provide space consistent with the delineated area defined by this prospectus. 
Background 
The DoD's mission is to provide the military forces needed to deter war and protect the 
security of our country. 
Currently, the DoD tenants housed in the Polk Building facility include the Pentagon Force 
Protection Agency (PFPA), Department of the Navy, F-35 Lightning II Joint Program 
Office (JPO), Headquarters Department of the Army (HQDA), WHS/Boards, 
Commissions and Task Forces (BC&TF)/Cross Functional Teams (CFT), and the Defense 
Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). The Joint Projects Office (JPO) is responsible for 
overseeing and ensuring the development and delivery of a highly complex weapon system 
to three U.S. Services, seven international partner nations, and multiple foreign military 
customers. The JPO has over 1,100 personnel located in Crystal City, Arlington, VA, and 
coordinates mission-essential functions supporting global operations. All the sub-agencies 
must remain as close as possible to the Pentagon campus to avoid disruptions that could 
have a negative impact on the agency's ability to meet the evolving security needs of our 
Nation. 
GSA will consider whether DoD's continued housing needs should be satisfied in the 
existing location based on an analysis of other potential locations within the delineated 
area. Other potential locations have been identified through market research; however, an 
extension cost-benefit analysis will be conducted to determine whether the Government 
can expect to recover the relocation and duplication costs of real and personal property 
needed for the DoD agencies to accomplish their missions. 
Justification 
The DoD and several of its sub-agencies are currently housed at 2521 S. Clark Street, 
Arlington, VA, in a lease that expires September 14, 2025. DoD and its sub-agencies 
require continued housing to carry out their missions. 
These tenants interface daily with senior personnel who are in the Pentagon and on Capitol 
Hill; proximity to the Pentagon remains a critical factor, along with the ability to remain 
co-located with other staff sections in the adjacent Zachary Taylor building. The missions

of these staff sections vary, but all support the warfighter, defend the Constitution, protect 
the American people, and further the mission of the United States Army, Air Force and 
Navy to fight and win the Nation's wars. 
There are also other national security implications attached to this location. Changes to 
the current configuration could lead to disjointed efforts and solutions impairing mission 
readiness for several of the agencies housed at the Polk Building. To meet the current and 
future requirements for system migration and transformation efforts, it is critical to 
maintain close proximity to the headquarters offices at the Pentagon and have the capacity 
to expand for onsite civilian staff and their respective contractor support required to 
complete various mission requirements. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease Proposals 
and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the approved prospectus. 
GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set forth in the procurement 
and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or higher. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and 
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the 
required rentable area. 
Interim Leasing 
GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued housing 
of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the new lease. It is in the best interest of 
the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy. 
0MB Memorandum M-21-25 Implementations and Long-Term Space Requirements 
The requirements within this prospectus reflect the known space needs prior to its 
submission to Congress. Agencies continue to develop their return to physical workplaces 
strategies consistent with 0MB Memorandum M-21-25, incorporate lessons learned while 
working both in-person and under maximum telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and determine each agency's long-term space posture. Accordingly, the requirements 
outlined in this prospectus may change prior to award of a lease. In the event that a change 
results in a revised requirement that makes a material change and does not fit within the

Border Protection (CBP), currently located at 90 K Street NE and 1331 Pennsylvania 
Avenue NW in Washington, DC. CBP has occupied space in the buildings between 2011 
and 2012 under leases that expire on various dates as noted below. These leases will 
provide continued housing for CBP with an overall space utilization rate of 182 usable 
square feet (USF) per person, while DHS pursues a long-term strategy of placing more 
CBP employees on the St. Elizabeth's Campus and in the Ronald Reagan Building with a 
resultant all-in utilization rate of 150 USF per person.

account for inflation. The proposed rental rate is fully serviced including all operating expenses, whether paid by the 
lessor or directly by the Government. GSA will conduct the procurement using prevailing market rental rates as a 
benchmark for the evaluation of competitive offers and as the basis for negotiating with offerors to ensure that lease 
award is made in the best interest of the Government.

PROSPECTUS-LEASE 
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY 
CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION 
WASHINGTON, DC 
PBS 
Prospectus Number: PDC-09-W A22 
CBP must yield delivery of space consistent with the delineated area defined by this 
prospectus. 
GSA will consider whether CBP' s continued housing needs should be satisfied in the 
existing location based on an analysis of other potential locations within the delineated 
area. If other potential locations are identified, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted to 
determine whether the Government can expect to recover the relocation and duplication 
costs of the real and personal property needed for CBP to accomplish its mission. 
Background 
CBP's mission is to safeguard America's borders, thereby protecting the public from 
dangerous persons and materials while enhancing the Nation's global economic 
competitiveness by enabling legitimate trade and travel. CBP aspires to be a global leader 
in promoting strong security and trade partnerships that foster a safe, secure, and 
prosperous America and global community. CBP will continue to leverage partnerships, 
technology, and an entrepreneurial spirit to continue maturing into a fully integrated 
Federal law enforcement agency that consistently and continuously improves mission 
effectiveness. CBP will serve as the premier law enforcement agency enhancing the 
Nation's safety, security, and prosperity through collaboration, innovation, and integration. 
Justification 
A significant presence by CBP's headquarters was originally planned to relocate to the 
St. Elizabeth's Campus that was master-planned to accommodate those DHS components 
directly involved in mission execution programmatic functions. Sporadic funding during 
the past several years created a need to adjust the overall planning for buildout and 
occupancy of St. Elizabeth's while at the same time to develop a housing strategy that 
includes consolidation of all CBP headquarters components. 
Approval of this prospectus will provide GSA with the authority to continue leasing space 
while DHS pursues a long-term strategy of placing more CBP employees within the St. 
Elizabeth's campus and the Ronald Reagan Building. Current leases will expire between 
2021 and 2022, but CBP requires continued housing to carry out its critical missions. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease Proposals 
and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the approved prospectus. 
GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set forth in the procurement 
and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or higher.

Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the 
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the 
required rentable area. 
Interim Leasing 
GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued housing 
of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the new lease. It is in the best interest of 
the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy. 
0MB Memorandum M-21-25 Implementations and Long-Term Space Requirements 
The requirements within this prospectus reflect the known space needs prior to its 
submission to Congress. Agencies continue to develop their return to physical workplaces 
strategies consistent with 0MB Memorandum M-21-25, incorporate lessons learned while 
working both in-person and under maximum telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and determine each agency's long-term space posture. Accordingly, the requirements 
outlined in this prospectus may change prior to award of a lease. In the event that a change 
results in a revised requirement that makes a material change and does not fit within the 
acceptable parameters of the congressional resolutions, GSA will submit an amended 
prospectus for consideration by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
and Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.

Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 Project Summary 
PBS 
PTN-CTC-CH21 
3 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes acquisition of a site and the design 
and construction of a new U.S. courthouse of approximately 186,000 gross square feet 
(GSF), including 39 inside parking spaces, in Chattanooga, TN. The courts will vacate 
their current space in the Joel W. Solomon Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse (FB-CT) 
and their leased space in the Old Post Office Custom House Building to consolidate into a 
new courthouse. 
The new courthouse will meet the 10-year space needs of the courts and court-related 
agencies, and the site will accommodate the expansion of the building to meet the 
anticipated 30-year needs of the courts. The judiciary's Courthouse Project Priorities List 
(approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States in September 2020) includes a 
courthouse project in Chattanooga, TN. 
FY 2021 Committee Approval Requested 
(Site, Design, Construction, Management & Inspection) ........................... $218,381,000 
FY 2021 Appropriation (Public Law 116-260, December 27, 2020) 
(Site, Design, Construction, Management & Inspection) ........................... $94,500,0001 
Overview of Proiect2 
The District Court and some related executive agencies currently occupy space in the 
existing Joel W. Solomon FB-CT, and the Bankruptcy Court and U.S. Trustees currently 
occupy the Old Post Office Custom House Building. This consolidation project will 
combine judicial space and operations from federally owned and leased locations. The 
new courthouse will provide seven courtrooms and nine chambers consistent with 
application of courtroom sharing policies and provision of no space for projected 
judgeships. 
1 Public Law 116-260 (FY 2021) funded $94,500,000 for site acquisition and construction for a courthouse 
in Chattanooga, TN. 
The estimated total project cost of $218,381,000 includes $22,500,000 for site 
acquisition, $17,168,000 for design, and $15,716,000 for management and inspection, all of which were 
funded in FY 2021; a portion of the necessary construction, $39,116,000, was also funded in FY 2021. The 
balance of the construction funding will be requested in a future fiscal year. 
2 The new courthouse building design will follow the 2007 United States Courts Design Guide (as partially 
revised in 2016).

GSA has tentative plans for the reuse of the Joel W. Solomon FB~CT upon completion of 
the new Chattanooga courthouse. The plan assumes that suitable tenants can be found to 
occupy the building, that renovation costs are reasonable compared to other alternatives, 
and that funding is available to implement the reuse strategy. Funding for reuse of the 
existing Joel W. Solomon FB-CTwill require a future prospectus-level project. If a project 
for future reuse is not cost effective, GSA will look at disposal options for the existing 
building.

The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes a repair and alteration project for 
the full modernization of the U.S. Post Office and Courthouse (POCT) located at 500 West 
Pike Street in Clarksburg, WV. In September 2020, the United States, acting by and 
through GSA, purchased the POCT from the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). The proposed 
project enables the U.S. District Court (USDC) to remain in-place, satisfying the court's 
long-term housing needs by renovating the historic courthouse and repurposing space that 
USPS vacated by converting vacant space into new court spaces, right-sizing the existing 
courtroom and associated support spaces, creating secure corridors, replacing major 
building systems, repairing the building envelope, correcting structural deficiencies, 
improving energy efficiency, and preserving historic building elements.

1972, a first-floor Annex addition was constructed, increasing the building to a total of 
78,629 square feet. The building came into the GSA inventory in FY 2020, when it was 
acquired by the United States from USPS. 
Tenant Agencies 
U.S. District Court (USDC), U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) 
Proposed Project 
The proposed project is an occupied comprehensive multi-phased renovation of the 
existing facility. The project includes: converting first-floor space vacated by USPS into 
additional courtroom, office and support space for USDC; addressing existing security 
deficiencies with separate restricted and secure circulation throughout the building for the 
public, judges and prisoners, thereby improving circulation so that the building works as a 
coherent whole; improving the layout of the existing USMS space on the first floor, and 
integrating all USMS spaces more effectively with the rest of the building; retaining, 
restoring and incorporating surviving historic spaces, such as the main lobby, the public 
corridors and the second-floor courtroom, into the building program. The project will also 
provide new window components, structural and seismic repairs, elevator expansion and 
modifications, and a comprehensive replacement of the mechanical, electrical, fire 
protection, and plumbing systems.

The POCT in Clarksburg came into the GSA inventory in 2020 after having been under 
the custody and control of USPS. Over the years, USPS's need for the facility diminished, 
and as a result, significant portions of the building are vacant. USPS was unable to make 
any meaningful reinvestment in the building, and due to years of deferred maintenance, 
many of the building systems are failing and beyond the end of their useful lives. These 
failing systems have created significant issues for USDC, which has a long-term need to 
be located in Clarksburg. 
As such, the building comes into GSA's inventory with 
significant reinvestment needs that cannot be addressed without this project. 
In addition to the operational and infrastructure needs at the courthouse, USDC has a near-
term need for a new courtroom and chambers to accommodate a senior judge. The current 
facility is served by a single undersized courtroom, which is shared by two district judges. 
Due to the lack of space, the magistrate judge has been relocated to another courthouse 
over an hour's drive away, significantly impacting the court's operations. Execution of 
this project will allow the return and colocation of the magistrate judge with the provision 
of a courtroom, chamber and support spaces. Execution of this project will also allow for 
the correction of circulation and security concerns. 
The existing HVAC system is over 47 years old, is increasingly prone to failure and 
consumes far more energy than a modern system. The control systems do not function 
properly, and the air handling units and duct systems-along with the chillers, cooling 
towers and pumps-are beyond their useful lives and need to be replaced.

Like the HVAC system, the majority of the electrical and lighting systems were installed 
in 1972, are energy inefficient and have surpassed their life expectancy. The plumbing 
system is also in need of replacement, as many of the fixtures, piping, valves, and 
appurtenances are failing. Major leaks have occurred at the facility over the past several 
years, resulting in the closure of restrooms, flooding of the basement and damage to 
occupant agency space. 
Since GSA assumed jurisdiction, custody and control of the 
property in September 2020, minor repairs have been completed; however, replacement is 
needed beyond the short term to prevent system failure and to enable the occupant agencies 
in the building to continue their operations without interruption. Currently, USMS holding 
cells on the second floor are not operational due to plumbing leaks. Similarly, there are 
partial closures of restrooms and janitorial closets throughout the facility. The basement 
drain lines have collapsed, and pumps are being used to prevent the flooding of the boiler 
room. 
Many valves throughout the system are not operational, and significant 
corrosion has been observed in both the plumbing and mechanical lines. If piping 
corrosion continues, the possibility of a pipe failure and shutdown of the property will 
become more likely. 
Similarly, the building envelope has active leaks, and over the years, the envelope has 
allowed a significant amount of water infiltration, causing moisture, mold and other indoor 
air quality issues. 
Summary of Energy, Water, Sustainability, and Climate Risk Compliance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards jbr 
the Public Buildings Service. 
GSA encourages (a) design opportunities to 
increase energy and water efficiency (including renewable energy and fossil fuel free 
measures), (b) adherence to sustainable design principles and ( c) minimizing climate risk 
liabilities above the minimum performance criteria in a manner that is life cycle cost-
effective.

Executive Summary 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes a lease extension of up to 3 years 
for approximately 375,260 rentable square feet (RSF) for the multiple agencies, currently 
located at 400 7th Street, SW in Washington, DC. Three agencies - the Federal Trade 
Commission (FTC), the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the National 
Endowment for the Arts (NEA) have occupied space in the building since 2014 under a 
lease that expires on February 29, 2024. 
Extension of the current lease will enable the agencies to provide continued housing for

and support promotes excellence in the humanities and the arts, respectively, conveying 
the lessons of history to all Americans and giving Americans the opportunity to participate 
in the arts and develop their creative capacities. 
The location at 400 Th Street, SW houses the support functions for all three agencies and 
is critical to their abilities to meet their missions. 
Justification 
The FTC, NEH and NEA are currently housed at Constitution Center located at 400 7th 
Street, SW, in a lease that expires February 29, 2024. The agencies require continued 
housing to carry out their missions until they are in a position to implement the 
Administration's M-21-25 policy as well as develop and implement long-term space 
strategies that comport with the Future of Work efforts and incorporate any necessary labor 
relation negotiations. A 3-year lease extension will provide the agencies with sufficient 
time to formulate their long-term plans and budget for move costs accordingly. GSA will 
attempt to negotiate a flexible lease term of three years with termination rights after the 
first year to provide flexibility for future plans. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and 
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the 
required rentable area. 
Interim Leasing 
GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued housing 
of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the extension It is in the best interest of 
the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy.

account for inflation. The proposed rental rate is fully serviced including all operating expenses, whether paid by the 
lessor or directly by the Government. GSA will conduct the procurement using prevailing market rental rates as a 
benchmark for the evaluation of competitive ofters and as the basis for negotiating with offerors to ensure that lease 
award is made in the best interest of the Government.

services to eligible military veterans at VA medical centers and outpatient clinics located 
throughout 
the 
country; 
several 
non-healthcare 
benefits 
including 
disability 
compensations, vocational rehabilitation, education assistance, home loans, and life 
insurance; and burial and memorial benefits to eligible veterans and family members at 
135 national cemeteries. 
GSA will consider whether VA' s continued housing needs should be satisfied in the 
existing location based on an analysis of other potential locations within the delineated 
area. If other potential locations are identified, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted to 
determine whether the Government can expect to recover the relocation and duplication 
costs of real and personal property needed for VA to accomplish its mission. 
Justification 
The VA tenants that occupy 1100 First Street NE include the National Cemetery 
Administration (NCA), Office of Information Technology (OIT), Electronic Health 
Records Management (EHRM), Veterans Health Administration, and the Office of General 
Counsel (OGC). 
The current leases at 1100 First Street NE expire on June 25, 2026. VA requires continued 
housing to carry out its mission. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease Proposals 
and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the approved prospectus. 
GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set forth in the procurement 
and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or higher. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and 
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the 
required rentable area.

the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy. 
0MB Memorandum M-21-25 Implementations and Long-Term Space Requirements 
The requirements within this prospectus reflect the known space needs prior to its 
submission to Congress. Agencies continue to develop their return to physical workplaces 
strategies consistent with 0MB Memorandum M-21-25, incorporate lessons learned while 
working both in-person and under maximum telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and determine each agency's long-term space posture. Accordingly, the requirements 
outlined in this prospectus may change prior to award of a lease. ln the event that a change 
results in a revised requirement that makes a material change and does not fit within the 
acceptable parameters of the congressional resolutions, GSA will submit an amended 
prospectus for consideration by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
and Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.

ministrator determines that the overall uti-
lization rate cannot be achieved, the Admin-
istrator shall provide an explanatory state-
ment to the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure of the House of Rep-
resentatives prior to exercising any lease au-
thority provided in this resolution. 
Provided that, except for interim leases as 
described above, the Administrator may not 
enter into any leases that are below pro-
spectus level for the purposes of meeting any 
of the requirements, or portions thereof, in-
cluded in the prospectus that would result in 
an overall utilization rate of 106 square feet 
or higher per person. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator shall include 
in the lease contract(s) a purchase option 
that can be exercised at the conclusion of 
the firm term of the lease. 
Provided further, that the General Services 
Administration shall not delegate to any

under this lease or any part thereof and that 
such provision provide that if this lease is 
found to have been made in violation of the 
foregoing prohibition or it is found that this 
prohibition has been violated during the 
term of the lease, the lease shall be void, ex-
cept that the foregoing limitation shall not 
apply if the lease is entered into with a pub-
licly-held corporation or publicly-held entity 
for the general benefit of such corporation or 
entity. 
Provided further, prior to entering into this

eral Services shall notify the occupant agen-
cy(ies) in writing, and consult with such oc-
cupant agency(ies) regarding security con-
cerns and necessary mitigation measures (if 
any) prior to award of the lease or approval 
of the novation agreement. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator of General 
Services shall require that the lease procure-
ment consider the availability of public 
transportation consistent with agency mis-
sion requirements and that the space to be 
leased be renovated for all cost-effective im-
provements, including renewable energy up-
grades, water efficiency improvements, and 
indoor air quality optimization, that reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.

FEMA houses its Disaster Operations Center (DOC) at 430 Market Street in Winchester, 
VA. This unique facility is the only DOC facility in the U.S. that procures, prepares, stores, 
and deploys technology, equipment, and supplies to all joint Field Offices established to 
support a disaster zone throughout the U.S. and U.S. territories. 
The DOC is comprised of both mission-critical and mission-support divisions, housing 15 
divisions in total. The mission-critical divisions are directly tied to the warehouse function, 
while the mission-support divisions are specifically building-support services. 
Justification 
FEMA's DOC is currently housed at 430 Market Street in a lease that expires April 1, 
2023. This requirement supports the FEMA disaster response mission and maintains 
separation from eastern FEMA metro area assets, while remaining close enough to support 
those assets. Further, it provides proximity to local FEMA resources, such as the Mount 
Weather Emergency Operations Center and regional transportation resources. 
FEMA recently consolidated personnel from a nearby FEMA controlled lease into the 
DOC, thereby increasing the building's efficiency and utilization rate (U/R), which is 
below its agency goals. Further efficiency and U/R improvements are expected to be 
realized over the term of this lease through program growth. This project will allow FEMA 
to evaluate its long-term housing requirements while meeting its requirement for continued 
housing to carry out its mission. 
GSA will consider whether FEMA's continued housing needs should be satisfied in the 
existing location based on an analysis of other potential locations within the delineated 
area. If other potential locations are identified, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted to 
determine whether the Government can expect to recover the relocation and duplication 
costs of real and personal property needed for FEMA to accomplish its mission. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease Proposals 
and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the approved prospectus. 
GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set forth in the procurement 
and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or higher.

PCT-CTC-HA21 
1 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes acquisition of a site and the design and 
construction of a new U.S. Courthouse of approximately 281,000 gross square feet (GSF), 
including 66 inside parking spaces in Hartford, CT. The courts will vacate their current space in 
the A.A. RibicoffFederal Building and U.S. Courthouse (FB-CT), and over time, consolidate the 
leased space into the Richard C. Lee U.S. Courthouse in New Haven, CT. The new courthouse 
will meet the IO-year space needs of the courts and court-related agencies, and the site will 
accommodate the expansion of the building to meet the anticipated 30-year needs of the courts. 
The Judiciary's Courthouse Project Priorities List (approved by the Judicial Conference of the 
United States in September 2020) includes a courthouse project in Hartford, CT.

Overview of Proiect2 
The U.S. District court and some related executive agencies currently occupy space in the existing 
RibicoffFB-CT in Hartford, CT. The new courthouse will provide 11 courtrooms and 18 chambers 
consistent with the application of courtroom sharing policies and the provision of no space for 
projected judgeships. Some replacements for current active judges who elect senior status in New 
Haven and Bridgeport will be housed in the new Hartford courthouse. The Court of Appeals, 
located in leased space in Hartford, will also relocate to the new courthouse. Federal agencies that 
are in leased space will remain in leased space.

Justification 
The existing Ribicoff FB-CT, constructed in 1963, does not meet the 2007 United States Courts 
Design Guide standards, has significant operational and building issues, lacks appropriate prisoner 
transport, and does not meet the square footage requirements for the U.S. Courts to expand in the 
future. The Judiciary requirements reflect the planned designation of Hartford as the new District 
of Connecticut headquarters upon project completion. 
3 Square footages are approximate. The project may contain a variance in gross square footage from that listed in this 
prospectus.

Summary of Energy, Water, Sustainability, and Climate Risk Compliance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for the Public 
Buildings Service. GSA encourages (a) design opportunities to increase energy and water 
efficiency (including renewable energy and fossil fuel free measures), (b) adherence to sustainable 
design principles and (c) minimizing climate risk liabilities above the minimum performance 
criteria in a manner that is life cycle cost-effective.

Future of Existing Federal Building 
PBS 
PCT-CTC-HA21 
I 
GSA has tentative plans for the re-use of the RibicoffFB-CT upon completion of the new Hartford 
courthouse. The plan assumes that suitable tenants can be found to occupy the building, that 
renovation costs are reasonable compared to other alternatives, and that funding is available to 
implement the re-use strategy. Funding for reuse of the existing Ribicoff FB-CT will require a 
future prospectus-level project. As the scope and budget are further refined, GSA will update the 
committee. If a re-use project is not cost-effective, GSA will look at disposal options for the 
existing building. 
Both the Richard C. Lee U.S. Courthouse in New Haven and the Brien McMahon U.S. Courthouse 
and Federal Building in Bridgeport will continue to be used to house court and related operations 
for the long term. 
It is likely that at some point in the future, local leased locations will be 
consolidated into one or both of these facilities.

Provided that, the Administrator of General 
Services and tenant agency(ies) agree to 
apply an overall utilization rate of 408 square 
feet or less per person, except that, if the Ad-
ministrator determines that the overall uti-
lization rate cannot be achieved, the Admin-
istrator shall provide an explanatory state-
ment to the Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure of the House of Rep-
resentatives prior to exercising any lease au-
thority provided in this resolution. 
Provided that, except for interim leases as 
described above, the Administrator may not 
enter into any leases that are below pro-
spectus level for the purposes of meeting any 
of the requirements, or portions thereof, in-
cluded in the prospectus that would result in 
an overall utilization rate of 408 square feet 
or higher per person. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator shall include 
in the lease contract(s) a purchase option 
that can be exercised at the conclusion of 
the firm term of the lease. 
Provided further, that the General Services 
Administration shall not delegate to any 
other agency the authority granted by this 
resolution. 
Provided further, that the Administrator 
shall require that the delineated area of the

provide an explanatory statement to the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure of the House of Representatives 
prior to exercising any lease authority pro-
vided in this resolution. 
Provided further, not later than 30 calendar

under this lease or any part thereof and that 
such provision provide that if this lease is 
found to have been made in violation of the 
foregoing prohibition or it is found that this 
prohibition has been violated during the 
term of the lease, the lease shall be void, ex-
cept that the foregoing limitation shall not 
apply if the lease is entered into with a pub-
licly-held corporation or publicly-held entity 
for the general benefit of such corporation or 
entity. 
Provided further, prior to entering into this 
lease or approving a novation agreement in-
volving a change of ownership under this 
lease, the Administrator of General Services

such an instance, the Administrator of Gen-
eral Services shall notify the occupant agen-
cy(ies) in writing, and consult with such oc-
cupant agency(ies) regarding security con-
cerns and necessary mitigation measures (if 
any) prior to award of the lease or approval 
of the novation agreement. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator of General 
Services shall require that the lease procure-
ment consider the availability of public 
transportation consistent with agency mis-
sion requirements and that the space to be 
leased be renovated for all cost-effective im-
provements, including renewable energy up-
grades, water efficiency improvements, and 
indoor air quality optimization, that reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.

Executive Summary 
PFL-01-J A22 
4 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes a lease of approximately 130,000 
rentable square feet (RSF) for the Federal Bureau oflnvestigations (FBI), currently located 
at 6061 Gate Parkway, Jacksonville, Florida. The FBI has occupied space in the building 
since 2009 under a lease that expires on February 19, 2024. 
GSA is proposing to lease space for the FBI in a method most beneficial to the government, 
as demonstrated in the results of a cost benefit analysis that may include: a reduction in the 
requirement size; relocation and duplication of real and personal property needed for the 
FBI to accomplish its mission; and physical relocation. 
The lease will provide continued housing for the FBI and will improve the office and 
overall space utilization rates from 112 to at least 109 and 449 to at least 408 usable square 
feet (USF) per person, respectively.

Background 
PBS 
PFL-01-J A22 
4 
The mission of the FBI is to protect and defend the United States against terrorist and 
foreign intelligence threats; to uphold and enforce the criminal laws of the United States; 
to provide leadership and criminal justice services to Federal, State, municipal, and 
international agencies and partners; and to perform these responsibilities in a manner that 
is responsive to the needs of the public and is faithful to the Constitution of the United 
States. 
The FBI has 56 field offices located in metropolitan areas throughout the United States. 
The field office locations carry out investigations, assess regional crime threats, and work 
with partners on cases and operations. The FBI Field Office in Jacksonville, Florida, 
covers 7 resident agencies and 40 counties in northern Florida including: Baker, Bradford, 
Clay, Columbia, Duval, Hamilton, Nassau, St. Johns, Suwannee, and Union Counties. 
Justification 
The FBI is currently housed at 6061 Gate Parkway, Jacksonville, FL, in a lease that expires 
on February 19, 2024. The FBI requires continued housing to ensure mission continuity. 
The FBI anticipates a continued need beyond the proposed term of this lease (20 years). 
As part of the procurement process, GSA will conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine 
whether the Government can expect to recover the costs of real and personal property 
needed, including a possible reduction in requirement size. 
Based on the minimum 
requirements provided by the FBI, if a new location is identified for the proposed lease, 
the Government could realize significant reduction in the overall space needed for the FBI 
as well as a sizeable improvement in the FBI' s space utilization. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease Proposals 
and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the approved prospectus. 
GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set forth in the procurement 
and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or higher. 
3This estimate is for fiscal year 2024 and may be escalated by 2 percent annually to the effective date of the lease to 
account for inflation. The proposed rental rate is fully serviced including all operating expenses, whether paid by the 
lessor or directly by the Government. New leases may contain an escalation clause to provide for annual changes in real 
estate taxes and operating costs.

Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and 
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the 
required rentable area. 
Interim Leasing 
GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued housing 
of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the new lease. It is in the best interest of 
the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy. 
0MB Memorandum M-21-25 Implementations and Long-Term Space Requirements 
The requirements within this prospectus reflect the known space needs prior to its 
submission to Congress. Agencies continue to develop their return to physical workplaces 
strategies consistent with 0MB Memorandum M-21-25, incorporate lessons learned while 
working both in-person and under maximum telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and determine each agency's long-term space posture. Accordingly, the requirements 
outlined in this prospectus may change prior to award of a lease. In the event that a change 
results in a revised requirement that makes a material change and does not fit within the 
acceptable parameters of the Congressional resolutions, GSA will submit an amended 
prospectus for consideration by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
and Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.

Proposed Proiect 
The proposed project replaces the deficient roofing system, including the flashing, and 
sealants with a new membrane roofing system coupled with high-efficiency insulation on 
the high-rise portion of the building. Upgrades to the building's permanent roof anchor/ 
fall arrest system will provide additional safeguards and eliminate life-safety deficiencies. 
Electrical upgrades will include replacement of the existing interior lighting and controls, 
incorporating occupancy and daylighting strategies throughout a newly replaced ceiling 
grid on all tenant floors. 
The conveying system, which includes elevator and escalator equipment, will be 
modernized to current technology, performance, and code standards. Replacement systems 
will incorporate non-proprietary, regenerative drives. Passenger cab interior panels will be 
replaced and include Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards-compliant 
features. 
Escalators will incorporate power standby technologies to reduce energy 
consumption during periods oflow or no passenger activity. 
The modernization of the HV AC system will include the replacement of existing air 
handling units and chillers with new high efficiency units using non-chlorofluorocarbon 
refrigerants. 
The existing variable air diffuser (V AD) system will be replaced and 
reconfigured with a highly efficient variable air volume system with reheat and a direct 
digital control system. The existing ductwork will be replaced or cleaned. Any new 
equipment will be fully compatible with and tied into the existing building automation 
system (BAS), in conjunction with a minor BAS expansion, as needed, to accommodate 
new equipment. Included is the replacement of all original perimeter heating piping and 
controls and the replacement of supply and return condensing water riser pipes from the 
mechanical room to the mechanical penthouse of the high-rise tower. The project will also 
retrofit waste condensate to provide additional hot water heat recovery for snowmelt or 
domestic hot water use.

The project will allow for roof replacement prior to full failure of the existing roofmg 
system in a manner that is minimally disruptive to the tenant agencies. If unfunded, 
recurring localized failures or full roof material failure risk damage to interior finishes, 
tenant property and mission, and historic building elements. Increased energy consumption 
due to deterioration of insulation is also a risk. Additionally, the project will incorporate 
permanent roof-mounted fall protection features for personnel to comply with life-safety 
standards. 
The current V AD system lacks control and responsiveness. Increased energy consumption, 
poor tenant comfort, and substandard indoor air quality are recurring problems throughout 
the building. Existing chillers have reached the end of their useful lives and require 
replacement. Upgrading the existing lighting and controls will result in decreased energy 
consumption, thereby reducing monthly utility costs. 
The existing elevators and escalator systems are over 30 years old and have exceeded their 
useful lives. 
Due to the high-traffic building conditions, existing elevator cabs and 
equipment are worn both visually and mechanically. The escalator systems are similarly 
beyond their intended lifespans. Performance levels continue to decrease annually, and 
emergency incidents regularly impact customers, including 49 elevator entrapments over a 
2-year period. Monthly preventive maintenance has become challenging due to the poor 
availability of propriety replacement parts. Interim repairs are underway to mitigate this 
life-safety and accessibility issue.

Project timing is critical to support the USAF backfill into the JFK. This tenant agency 
would improve the building's overall utilization and would be paired with other agency 
consolidations, reducing the Federal footprint and providing significant taxpayer savings. 
Summary of Energy, Water, Sustainability, and Climate Risk Compliance 
This project will be designed to conform to requirements of the Facilities Standards for 
the Public Buildings Service. GSA encourages design opportunities to increase energy and 
water efficiency (including renewable energy and fossil free measures), adherence to 
sustainable design principles, and minimizing climate risk liabilities above the minimum 
performance criteria in a manner that is life cycle cost-effective.

The USCIS mission is to administer the Nation's lawful immigration system, safeguarding 
its integrity and promise by efficiently and fairly adjudicating requests for immigration 
benefits while protecting Americans, securing the homeland, and honoring our values. 
USCIS oversees lawful immigration to the United States, providing services that include 
citizenship, immigration of family members, visas, verification of legal rights to work in 
the United States, humanitarian programs, adoptions, civic integration, and genealogy. 
The NRC oversees the storage, management, and integrity of 72.5 million immigration 
files and an additional 17.5 million files in circulation across its Service Centers and Field 
Offices, while supporting the largest Freedom of Information Act program in the Federal 
Government. 
GSA will consider whether USCIS-NRC' s continued housing needs should be satisfied in 
the existing location based on an analysis of other potential locations within the delineated 
area. If other potential locations are identified, a cost-benefit analysis will be conducted to 
determine whether the Government can expect to recover the relocation and duplication 
costs of real and personal property needed for USCIS-NRC to accomplish its mission. 
Justification 
The USCIS-NRC is currently housed at 150 NW Space Center Loop in Lee's Summit, MO, 
in a lease that expires October 14, 2024. The existing location handles a daily average of 
over 100,000 files. These files are received, shipped out, pulled for audits or other action, 
and shelved. 
USCIS is finalizing a long-term master plan to modernize NRC's current storage and 
retrieval system. USCIS-NRC requires continued housing to carry out its mission during 
the development of the master plan, and the 10-year term will provide adequate time for 
planning and execution of the long-term strategy. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease Proposals 
and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the approved prospectus. 
GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set forth in the procurement 
and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or higher.

Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and 
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the 
required rentable area. 
Interim Leasing 
GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued housing 
of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the new lease. It is in the best interest of 
the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy. 
0MB Memorandum M-21-25 Implementations and Long-Term Space Requirements 
The requirements within this prospectus reflect the known space needs prior to its 
submission to Congress. Agencies continue to develop their return to physical workplaces 
strategies consistent with 0MB Memorandum M-21-25, incorporate lessons learned while 
working both in-person and under maximum telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and determine each agency's long-term space posture. Accordingly, the requirements 
outlined in this prospectus may change prior to award of a lease. In the event that a change 
results in a revised requirement that makes a material change and does not fit within the 
acceptable parameters of the Congressional resolutions, GSA will submit an amended 
prospectus for consideration by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
and Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 
LOUISVILLE, KY 
Prospectus Number: 
Congressional District: 
PKY-0l-LO21

Executive Summary 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes a lease of a maximum of 121,000 
rentable square feet (RSF) for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), currently located 
at 12401 Sycamore Station Road in Louisville, Kentucky. The FBI has occupied space in 
the building since 2009 under a lease that expires on March 16, 2024. 
GSA is proposing to lease space for the FBI in a method most beneficial to the government, 
as demonstrated in the results of a cost-benefit analysis, that may include a possible 
reduction in requirement size, duplication ofreal and personal property needed for the FBI 
to accomplish its mission and physical relocation. 
A lease will provide continued housing for the FBI and will result in an improvement in 
the maximum office and overall space utilization rates to 117 and 462 usable square feet 
(USF) per person, respectively.

parking spaces identified in the prospectus. This may be accomplished as a lessor-furnished service, under an 
operating agreement with the lessor or as part of the Government's leasehold interest in the building(s). 
3 This estimate is for fiscal year FY2024 and may be escalated by 2 percent annually to the et1ective date of the lease to 
account for inflation. The proposed annual rental cost is fully serviced including all operating expenses, whether paid 
by the lessor or directly by the Government. 
New leases may contain an escalation clause to provide for annual 
changes in real estate taxes and operating costs.

Background 
PROSPECTUS-LEASE 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION 
LOUISVILLE, KY 
PBS 
Prospectus Number: 
PKY-01-LO21 
Congressional District: 
03 
The FBI' s mission is to protect and defend the United States against terrorist and foreign 
intelligence threats; to uphold and enforce the criminal laws of the United States; to provide 
leadership and criminal justice services to Federal, State, municipal, and international 
agencies and partners; and to perform these responsibilities in a manner that is responsive 
to the needs of the public and is faithful to the Constitution of the United States. 
The FBI has 56 field offices located in metropolitan areas throughout the United States. 
The field office locations carry out investigations, assess regional crime threats, and work 
with partners on cases and operations. The FBI field office in Louisville, Kentucky, covers 
seven resident agent offices as well as the counties of Bullitt, Hardin, Jefferson, LaRue, 
Marion, Meade, Nelson, Oldham, Shelby, Spencer, and Washington in Kentucky. The 
current location at 12401 Sycamore Station Road was a build-to-suit lease completed in 
2009 for the FBI as the sole tenant. 
Justification 
The FBI is currently housed at 12401 Sycamore Station Road in a lease that expires March 
16, 2024. The FBI requires continued housing to carry out its mission. This project will 
improve the agency's utilization rate while housing additional personnel and maintaining 
mission readiness. 
The FBI requires a facility that meets the increased security requirements of the 
Interagency Security Committee Criteria as well as those of support functions that conduct 
investigations to combat terrorism. Space is needed to accommodate increased personnel 
and program requirements for the Joint Terrorism Task Forces, CYBER Crimes 
investigations, Computer Analysis and Response Team evaluations, Evidence Response 
Team retrieval and analysis, Crisis Management Center for Command Post operations, 
Firearms Training System, Language Services, and the Evidence Control Center. 
As part of the procurement process, GSA will conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine 
whether the Government can expect to recover the costs of real and personal property 
needed, including a possible reduction in requirement size. 
Based on the minimum 
requirements provided by the FBI, if a new location is identified for the proposed lease, 
the Government could realize significant reduction in the overall space needed for FBI as 
well as a sizeable improvement in the FBI' s space utilization.

Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease Proposals 
and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the approved prospectus. 
GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set forth in the procurement 
and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or higher. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and 
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the 
required rentable area. 
Interim Leasing 
GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued housing 
of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the new lease. It is in the best interest of 
the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy. 
0MB Memorandum M-21-25 Implementations and Long-Term Space 
Requirements 
The requirements within this prospectus reflect the known space needs prior to its 
submission to Congress. Agencies continue to develop their return to physical workplaces 
strategies consistent with 0MB Memorandum M-21-25, incorporate lessons learned while 
working both in-person and under maximum telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and determine each agency's long-term space posture. Accordingly, the requirements 
outlined in this prospectus may change prior to award of a lease. In the event that a change 
results in a revised requirement that makes a material change and does not fit within the 
acceptable parameters of the Congressional resolutions, GSA will submit an amended 
prospectus for consideration by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
and Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.

Background 
The FBI's mission is to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution of the 
United States; protect and defend the United States against terrorist and foreign intelligence 
threats; to combat, uphold and enforce the criminal laws of the United States; to protect 
civil rights; and provide leadership and criminal justice services to Federal, State municipal 
and international agency partners. 
FBI has 56 field offices located in metropolitan areas throughout the United States. The 
field office locations carry out investigations, assess regional crime threats, and work with 
partners on cases and operations. The FBI field office in Omaha, Nebraska, covers eight 
resident agent offices as well as the counties of Burt, Cass, Colfax, Dodge, Douglas, 
Madison, Platte, Sarpy, Stanton, and Washington in Nebraska and counties of Fremont, 
Harrison, Mills, Montgomery, Page, Pottawattamie, and Shelby in Iowa. 
Justification 
The FBI is currently housed at 4411 S 121st Court in a lease that expires July 15, 2024. 
FBI requires continued housing to carry out its mission. 
FBI has a long-term need for space in the Omaha area to meet the agency's mission. FBI's 
case load continues to increase, and the proposed project will provide space for additional 
personnel thereby improving the office utilization. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease Proposals 
and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the approved prospectus. 
GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set forth in the procurement 
and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or higher. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and 
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the 
3 New leases may contain an escalation clause to provide for annual changes in real estate taxes and operating costs.

Interim Leasing 
GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued housing 
of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the new lease. It is in the best interest of 
the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy. 
0MB Memorandum M-21-25 Implementations and Long-Term Space 
Requirements 
The requirements within this prospectus reflect the known space needs prior to its 
submission to Congress. Agencies continue to develop their return to physical workplaces 
strategies consistent with 0MB Memorandum M-21-25, incorporate lessons learned while 
working both in-person and under maximum telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and determine each agency's long-term space posture. Accordingly, the requirements 
outlined in this prospectus may change prior to award of a lease. In the event that a change 
results in a revised requirement that makes a material change and does not fit within the 
acceptable parameters of the Congressional resolutions, GSA will submit an amended 
prospectus for consideration by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
and Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.

The proposed project will modernize the building's 36 passenger and 4 freight elevators, 
including replacement of the elevator communication systems, cab fmishes and interior 
lights, and Architectural Ban·iers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS)-related upgrades. 
The modernization includes all new components from the hoist motor, controllers, all 
wiring, all safety devices, switches, door equipment, cabs and panels, and hydraulic 
machinery. Ancillary systems and functions will be updated, where needed, to meet 
cunent codes and safety standards and to provide for the serviceability, operability and 
reliability of each elevator. Fire recall systems, emergency power, fire separation, fire 
sprinklers, accessibility, electrical. electrical panels, and elevator machinery room air 
conditioning, ventilation and lighting will also be addressed.

Justification 
$28,479,000 
$28,479,000 
The RFK Federal Building is historic, with Art Deco-style elevators that have not been 
folly modernized since the 1970s. The elevator system has exceeded its useful life and is 
difficult to maintain. Currently, DOJ has shut down eight elevators to use their parts to 
keep the others nmning. Of the remaining active elevators, the finishes, controls, and 
equipment are old, unreliable, historically inconect, and do not meet current codes. 
Because of the age of the current control system and car mechanical parts, it is becoming 
increasingly difficult to repair and find replacement parts. The operating equipment is 
outdated and well past its useful life expectancy. Problems are occuning with the door 
adjustments on the elevator car and hatch doors causing frequent entrapment of building 
occupants. The door clutches and adjustment arms are worn to the point where a total 
replacement is needed. Elevator lights need to be upgraded to meet ABAAS requirements. 
The lumens are too low in some cabs, thereby making it difficult or impossible for visually 
impaired riders to see call buttons, emergency phones or instmctions in the cabs.

space able to meet requirements in whole or in part. All offers must provide space 
consistent with the delineated area defined by this prospectus. 
Background 
NOAA's mission is science, service, and stewardship. NOAA has three goals: 1) to 
understand and predict changes in climate, weather, oceans, and coasts; 2) to share that 
knowledge and information with others; and 3) to conserve and manage coastal and marine 
ecosystems and resources. 
The leases in Riverdale, MD house NOAA's National Center for Weather and Climate 
Prediction (NCWCP) and a portion of NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data, 
and Information Service (NESDIS). The Weather Prediction Center is one of the nine 
National Centers for Environmental Prediction, which is part of the National Weather 
Service (NWS). The NCWCP exists to meet the real-time weather information needs of a 
growing group of users including NWS field offices, other governmental agencies, the 
media, the private sector, academic institutions, the international community, and the 
general public. It supports the NWS mission of protecting lives and property and 
enhancing the national economy. NCWCP's mission is to be a leader in the collaborative 
weather forecast process delivering responsive, accurate, and reliable national forecasts 
and analyses. 
The NESDIS's mission is to provide secure and timely access to global environmental data 
and information from satellites and other sources to promote and protect the Nation's 
security, environment, economy, and quality of life. 
The service operates a fleet of 
environmental satellites that provide critical observations of the Earth and space, and its 
data products support NOAA's mission and drive science throughout the environmental 
community. 
This facility operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and the location leverages NOAA's 
partnerships with nearby research institutes, centers of expertise, and the University of 
Maryland by fostering collaborative projects and research opportunities. 
Justification 
NOAA is currently housed at 5825 and 5830 University Research Court, Riverdale, MD, 
in two leases that expire on April 25, 2025. NOAA requires continued housing to carry 
out its mission.

Consolidating the two leases will help opt1m1ze NOAA's footprint, improve their 
utilization rate, and maintain the 24 hour a day, 7 day a week mission readiness 
requirement. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease Proposals 
and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the approved prospectus. 
GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set forth in the procurement 
and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or higher. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and 
the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the 
required rentable area. 
Interim Leasing 
GSA will execute such interim leasing actions as are necessary to ensure continued housing 
of the tenant agency prior to the effective date of the new lease. It is in the best interest of 
the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy. 
0MB Memorandum M-21-25 Implementations and Long-Term Space Requirements 
The requirements within this prospectus reflect the known space needs prior to its 
submission to Congress. Agencies continue to develop their return to physical workplaces 
strategies consistent with 0MB Memorandum M-21-25, incorporate lessons learned while 
working both in-person and under maximum telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
and determine each agency's long-term space posture. Accordingly, the requirements 
outlined in this prospectus may change prior to award of a lease. In the event that a change 
results in a revised requirement that makes a material change and does not fit within the 
acceptable parameters of the congressional resolutions, GSA will submit an amended 
prospectus for consideration by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
and Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.

Executive Summary 
The General SeIVices Administration (GSA) proposes a lease of approximately 610,000 
rentable square feet (RSF) for the Department of Health and Human Services-National 
Institutes of Health (NIH)-National Cancer Institute (NCI), currently located at 9609 
Medical Center Drive, Rockville, MD. NCI has occupied space in the building since 2013 
under a lease that expires on February 6, 2023. 
The lease will provide continued housing for NCI and will improve the office and overall 
space utilization rates from 147 to 135 and 202 to 187 per person, respectively.

1 The RSF/USF at the current location is approximately 1.13; however, to maximize competition, an RSF/USF ratio of 
1.20 is used for the estimated proposed maximum RSF as indicated in the housing plan. 
2 This estimate is for fiscal year 2023 and may be escalated by 2.0 percent annually to the effective date of the lease to 
account for inflation. The proposed rental rate is fully serviced including all operating expenses, whether paid by the 
lessor or directly by the Government. GSA will conduct the procurement using prevailing market rental rates as a 
benchmark for the evaluation of competitive offers and as the basis for negotiating with offerors to ensure that lease 
award is made in the best interest of the Government. 
3 New leases may contain an escalation clause to provide for annual changes in real estate taxes and operating costs.

Acquisition Strategy 
To maximize the flexibility and competition in acquiring space for the NCI, GSA may 
issue a single, multiple-award solicitation that will allow offerers to provide blocks of 
space able to meet requirements in whole or in part. All offers must provide space 
consistent with the delineated area defined by this prospectus. 
Background 
The National Cancer Institute leads, conducts, and supports cancer research across the 
Nation to advance scientific knowledge and help all people live longer, healthier lives. As 
the leader of the cancer research enterprise, collectively known as the National Cancer 
Program, and the largest funder of cancer research in the world, NCI manages a broad 
range of research, training, and information dissemination activities that reach across the 
entire country, meeting the needs of all demographics-rich and poor, urban and rural, and 
all racial and ethnic populations. Specifically, NCI focuses on two broad roles: cancer 
research, and the training and support of cancer researchers. 
Justification 
The purpose of this lease prospectus is to consolidate NCI's headquarters operations with 
two other leases (one delegated lease and one agency lease). The number of employees 
housed together will expand to 2,711. The current lease expires on February 6, 2023, and 
NCI requires continued housing to carry out its mission. 
Summary of Energy Compliance 
GSA will incorporate energy efficiency requirements into the Request for Lease Proposals 
and other documents related to the procurement of space based on the approved prospectus. 
GSA encourages offerors to exceed minimum requirements set forth in the procurement 
and to achieve an Energy Star performance rating of 75 or higher. 
Resolutions of Approval 
Resolutions adopted by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the 
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works approving this prospectus will 
constitute approval to make appropriations to lease space in a facility that will yield the 
required rentable area.

Prospectus Number: PMD-0778/l 822-MD22 
FY 2022 Proiect Summary 
The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes a repair and alteration project for 
4600 Silver Hill North and 4600 Silver Hill South at the Suitland Federal Center in 
Suitland, Maryland. The proposed project will upgrade building systems and renovate 
space to support the co-location of three agencies. This project will provide a more 
efficient layout that both reduces agency utilization and allows for the recapture and 
backfill of underutilized federally owned space. 
The space will be occupied by the 
Department of Labor-Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), currently located in approximately 
710,000 rentable square feet (RSF), or 508,000 usable square feet (USF), of leased space 
at the Postal Square Building, 2 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., in Washington, DC. BLS's 
almost SO-percent decrease in RSF and relocation to the Suitland Federal Center provide 
an annual lease cost avoidance of approximately $16,200,000 and an agency rent savings 
of potentially $18,000,000 compared to its current rent.

GSA currently leases space in the Postal Square Building for BLS. This lease expires on 
May 14, 2022. To allow for the proposed alterations and relocation to the Suitland Federal 
Center, GSA may need to extend the lease agreement for a limited amount of time. GSA 
will execute such interim actions, as necessary, to ensure continued housing of the tenant 
agency, and the term of the extension will coincide with the schedule of occupancy. It is 
in the best interest of the Government to avert the financial risk of holdover tenancy.

BLS' s current location in the Postal Square Building houses personnel who are responsible 
for carrying out the Bureau's mission of collecting, analyzing and disseminating essential 
economic information to support public and private decision-making. The current lease 
expires on May 14, 2022, and BLS requires continued housing to carry out its mission. 
Funding provided in FY 2020 and FY 2021 has allowed GSA, BLS and Census to initiate 
the space optimization of the North and South buildings at the Suitland Federal Center. 
Through system and core item upgrades, the additional funding will further facilitate the 
achievement of more efficient utilization rates and reduce rental payments made by BLS. 
Census will release an estimated 400,000 RSF to make room for the co-location of BLS, 
reducing Census's annual rent by an estimated $10,000,000. 
BLS will improve its 
utilization by downsizing its real estate footprint by almost half, from the current 710,000 
RSF to an estimated 355,000 RSF, a decrease of over 350,000 RSF. This co-1 ocati on will 
allow GSA to eliminate an estimated $16.2 million in annual lease costs otherwise 
attributed to housing BLS.

TRIBUTE TO YOUNG STAFF MEM-
BERS 
FOR 
THEIR 
CONTRIBU-
TIONS ON BEHALF OF THE PEO-
PLE 
OF 
THE 
18TH 
CONGRES-
SIONAL DISTRICT OF TEXAS AND 
THE UNITED STATES 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 29, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, in 
these tumultuous days of crisis and challenge, 
Members of Congress know well, perhaps bet-
ter than most, how blessed our Nation is to 
have in reserve such exceptional young men 
and women who will go on to become leaders 
in their local communities, states, and the na-
tion in the areas of business, education, law, 
government, philanthropy, the arts and culture, 
and the military. 
We know this because we see them and 
benefit from their contributions every day. 
Many of them work for us in our offices as jun-
ior staff members, congressional fellows, or in-
terns and they do amazing work for and on 
behalf of the constituents we are privileged to 
represent. 
Madam Speaker, I believe there is no higher 
calling than the call to serve a cause larger 
than ourselves. That is why I ran for public of-
fice. I was inspired to serve by President Ken-
nedy who said, ‘‘Ask not what your country 
can do for you, ask what you can do for your 
country,’’ and by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. who said: 
‘‘Everybody can be great because anybody 
can serve. . . . You only need a heart full of 
grace. A soul generated by love.’’ 
By this measure, there are several other 
great young men and women who served as 
volunteers this year in my offices. They brave 
the dangers of the pandemic that has wrought 
so much suffering and heartbreak across our 
nation. They cheerfully do their duty in the 
U.S. Capitol complex that just over one year 
ago was the site of an insurrection attack not 
seen since the War of 1812. These dedicated 
and public-spirited men and women may toil in 
obscurity but their contributions to the constitu-
ents we serve are deeply appreciated. That is 
why today I rise to pay tribute to five extraor-
dinary young persons for their service to my 
constituents in the 18th Congressional District 
of Texas and to the American people. They 
are: 
Alexander Nordahl, University of Houston; 
Shania Jackson, Texas Tech University; 
Laura Rincon-Bianchi, University of Hous-
ton; 
Jordan Webster, Howard University; and 
Ayana Ahuja, The Madeira School. 
Madam Speaker, the energy, intelligence, 
and idealism these wonderful young people 
brought to my office and those interning in the 
offices of my colleagues help keep our democ-
racy vibrant. The insights, skills, and knowl-
edge of the governmental process they gain 
from their experiences will last a lifetime and 
prove invaluable to them as they go about 
making their mark in this world. 
Because of persons like them the future of 
our country is bright, and its best days lie 
ahead. I wish them all well. 
Madam Speaker, I am grateful that such 
thoughtful committed young men and women 
can be found working in my office, those of 
my colleagues, and in every community in 
America. Their good works will keep America 
great, good, and forever young.

HOMETOWN HERO—RAYFIELD 
WRIGHT 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 29, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of North Texas leg-
end, Rayfield Wright, who passed away last 
week. 
Rayfield was a long-time player for the Dal-
las Cowboys, marking his legacy as a hall of 
famer both on and off the field. 
During his time with the Cowboys, Rayfield 
earned the iconic nickname ‘‘Big Cat’’ for his 
ability on his feet, despite his looming size. He 
helped lead the Cowboys in the 70’s, winning 
an impressive five NFC championships and 
two Super Bowls along the way. 
After thirteen seasons and an incredible 
200+ games, Rayfield was rightfully inducted 
into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. His fellow 
Cowboys legend, Roger Staubach put it sim-
ply, ‘‘he was absolutely the best.’’ 
But his story did not end there, in fact far 
from it. Rayfield went on to put the same love 
and energy that he put into football, into his 
community. 
Just last year, Rayfield put on a charity golf 
tournament outside Fort Worth to provide 
much needed relief to the community during 
the pandemic. Proceeds from the tournament 
went to a local food bank and first responders. 
I thank Rayfield for always putting North 
Texas first, and inspiring us on the field and 
in the community. DFW will always remember 
his legacy; may he rest in peace.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF RITA 
BROCK-PERINI 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 29, 2022 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to remember and celebrate the life of 
Rita Brock-Perini, who passed away in April. 
Rita was the first woman in her family to join 
the military, and she dedicated her life to serv-
ice and inspired many—including myself—to 
do more in support of our Nation’s veterans. 
Rita was born in Phoenix in 1938 as one of 
ten children. After graduating from St. Mary’s 
High School, she earned her nursing degree 
and spent ten years working as a nurse before 
becoming a captain in the Air Force Nursing 
Corps, serving during one of the most violent 
periods of the Vietnam war. As one of the 
more experienced nurses, she cared for not 
only the soldiers wounded in war, but for her 
fellow nurses as well. Rita left the Air Force in 
1971 to take a job with the American Red 
Cross, continuing her service to those in need. 
Even after retiring in 2003, Rita never lost 
her passion for service. She became Vice 
President of the Veterans Medical Leadership 
Council (VMLC), an organization dedicated to 
ensuring quality care for veterans in Maricopa 
County. At VMLC, Rita managed the Return-
ing Warriors program, which worked with the 
local VA to provide emergency services to vet-
erans. 
I am lucky to have been able to consider 
Rita a friend. She was one of the first people 
to welcome me to the American Legion when 
I moved to Phoenix as a young veteran, and 
I will never forget her kindness and support. 
My thoughts and prayers are with her family, 
friends, and our community. She will be great-
ly missed.

ASSET SEIZURE FOR UKRAINE 
RECONSTRUCTION ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 6930 the Asset Seizure for 
Ukraine Reconstruction Act, which authorizes 
the President to, subject to certain conditions, 
seize assets belonging to a foreign person 
whose wealth is derived in part through polit-
ical support for or corruption linked to Russian 
President Vladimir Putin. 
In the two years that follow this bill’s enact-
ment, the President may seize assets if Rus-
sia remains engaged in a conflict of territorial 
conquest in Ukraine; the President has im-
posed sanctions on the owner of the assets 
for reasons related to corruption, human rights 
violations, malign influence, or conflicts in 
Ukraine; and the assets are valued at over $5 
million. 
The seized assets may be liquidated, and 
the resulting funds may only be used for spec-
ified purposes, including the post-conflict re-
construction of Ukraine, humanitarian assist-
ance and refugee support for the Ukrainian 
people, weapons for Ukraine’s uniformed mili-
tary forces, and humanitarian and develop-
ment assistance for the Russian people. 
There is no question of whether the Russian 
Federation, under the direction of Vladimir 
Putin, has been defying the laws of war 
throughout their unprovoked, unjust, and un-
lawful invasion of Ukraine. 
In the three decades since gaining inde-
pendence, Ukraine has sought closer eco-
nomic, social, and political ties with the free 
market and democratic nations of the West.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E438 
April 29, 2022 
Since 2013, the Russian Federation has im-
posed a campaign of political, economic, and 
military aggression in Ukraine. 
Today the world is witnessing a manufac-
tured war, arbitrarily ordered by Vladimir Putin. 
President Putin and his associates must be 
held personally liable for the war crimes com-
mitted against the people of Ukraine. 
Russia claims it is not attacking civilians, yet 
thousands of people have been killed, mostly 
from explosive weapons with a wide impact 
area, including shelling from heavy artillery 
and multi-launch rocket systems, and missile 
and air strikes. 
Families are being separated by war, adults 
and children are being ruthlessly killed, and a 
rogue Russia is violently crushing political 
speech opposing the war from its own citi-
zens. 
As Russian ground forces advance in 
Ukraine, Ukrainians are sheltering from artil-
lery and cruise missiles in subways and bomb 
shelters. 
The western world must continue to march 
in unison against this senseless Russian inva-
sion of a sovereign nation. 
It is our duty to do all we can to stop these 
brutal attacks on democracy. Squeezing the 
bank 
accounts 
and 
assets 
of 
Russian 
oligarchs will eventually force them to take 
matter into their own hands and stop Putin. 
I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6930 
the Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction 
Act to help put an end to Putin’s evil invasion.

IN CELEBRATION OF THE 100TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
PRINCETON 
BAPTIST 
MEDICAL 
CENTER 
IN 
BIRMINGHAM, AL 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 29, 2022 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 100th anniversary of Prince-
ton Baptist Medical Center and Baptist Health 
System. 
Though the history of Princeton Baptist 
Medical Center begins in 1922, the framework 
of the hospital, dates back to 1906 with the 
establishment of Birmingham Infirmary by Dr. 
William Christopher Gewin. Specializing in 
compassionate care in a Christian environ-
ment, Birmingham Infirmary was a pioneering 
medical center in the city of Birmingham, serv-
ing as the city’s first training school for nurses. 
By 1922, the Birmingham Baptist Associa-
tion assumed ownership of Birmingham Infir-
mary, making it the first time any local Baptist 
association owned a hospital. As a faith-based 
hospital, Birmingham Baptist Hospital, now 
Princeton Baptist Medical Center, built its or-
ganization on the premise that it would provide 
service to patients regardless of their ability to 
pay. During their first day of operation, Prince-
ton served 39 patients, with 11 more admitted 
by the day’s end without any operating capital. 
Ten years later, in 1930, the Princeton Bap-
tist Medical Center leased a second location 
previously owned by one of the original med-
ical staff, Dr. Seale Harris, who originally built 
and began operating the residential hospital. 
After acquiring another facility, the Baptist 
Health System began rapidly expanding, un-
dergoing multiple major hospital expansions 
and renovations. As the hospital infrastructure 
started to grow, its network was not far be-
hind, expanding to meet the needs of its pa-
tients by adding new departments to expand 
critical services and conducting clinical re-
search to stay abreast with the latest medical 
advancements. 
During World War II, Princeton Baptist Med-
ical Center became the first hospital in the re-
gion to have a United States Cadet Nurse 
Corps unit hosting over 100 students. By the 
1960s, they continued building upon their es-
teemed reputation by performing pioneering 
brain surgery at Princeton Baptist Medical 
Center, becoming one of the first hospitals in 
the city to desegregate its wards, and intro-
ducing the use of automation in their labora-
tories. 
With growth as a cornerstone, during the 
1990s, additional hospitals joined Princeton 
Baptist to build one of the state’s largest and 
most comprehensive networks of acute care 
hospitals and a true community of care; a net-
work that was strengthened in 2015 through a 
partnership with Brookwood Medical Center to 
create the five-hospital system of Brookwood 
Baptist Health. 
Upholding its ‘‘high tech and high touch’’ 
reputation, Princeton Baptist Medical Center 
has stayed at the forefront of technology, staff-
ing the hospital with present-day pioneers 
bringing cutting-edge health care to the people 
of the north and central Alabama. 
From its humble beginnings in 1922, Prince-
ton Baptist Medical center has upheld its rich 
legacy of medical ministry by staying active in 
the community through education. Noted as a 
teaching hospital, Princeton Baptist Medical 
Center has several educational programs, be-
coming the first health care system in the 
United States to implement a pastoral edu-
cation program and student internship. Now 
Princeton continues to provide these trans-
formational opportunities by hosting multiple 
residency programs, creating the Ida V. 
Moffett School of Nursing at Samford Univer-
sity and the Princeton Baptist Achievers Pro-
gram, a mentoring/scholarship program for 
high school students interested in healthcare. 
Working to provide the most efficient, cost- 
effective, and patient-friendly care, Princeton 
Baptist Medical Center now has a medical 
staff of more than 230 physicians, an addi-
tional 1,700 employees, and 505-licensed hos-
pital 
beds. 
As 
the 
first 
hospital 
under 
Brookwood Baptist Health, Princeton Medical 
Center is a centerpiece to the state’s largest 
health care system providing innovative and 
compassionate care to all patients. 
On a personal note, my family and I have 
experienced Princeton Baptist Medical Cen-
ter’s compassionate care firsthand. Their doc-
tors, nurses, administrators, and other health 
care professionals provided excellent care 
while giving us the support and resources we 
needed to get well. They were God-sent, and 
the Sewell family is eternally grateful. 
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the 100th anniversary of Princeton 
Baptist Medical Center and its vital contribu-
tions to the medical profession and the health 
and well-being of the Birmingham community. 
ACKNOWLEDGING FAITH AND COM-
MUNITY EMPOWERMENT (FACE) 
AND THE SAIGU CAMPAIGN 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 29, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to acknowledge Faith and Commu-
nity Empowerment (FACE)’s efforts to unite 
Los Angeles on the eve of the 30th anniver-
sary of the Los Angeles Riots. 
As many of us remember, the Los Angeles 
Riots that occurred during the spring of 1992 
left 63 people killed, over 3,000 business de-
stroyed, and more than a billion dollars in 
property damage. The city’s Korean commu-
nity alone saw more than five hundred million 
dollars of property damage—leaving many to 
face the uncertainty of no longer being able to 
provide for themselves and their families. 
As the 30th anniversary approached, FACE 
worked alongside community organizations to 
launch the Serve Advocate Inspire Give Unite 
(SAIGU) campaign to promote peace, toler-
ance, and unity across Los Angeles. Begin-
ning tomorrow, events such as documentary 
screenings, art exhibitions, and interfaith pray-
er sessions will take place across the city. To-
gether, these events are designed to highlight 
the community’s desire to remember and heal 
from those traumatic events. This year’s 
events are meant to build bridges of under-
standing and combat the myths that drive 
wedges between the city’s diverse and vibrant 
ethnic communities. 
30 years later, this anniversary comes at a 
time of rising xenophobic rhetoric, particularly 
against the AAPI community. As the one of 
only four Korean Americans currently serving 
in Congress, I am incredibly thankful of the 
work that FACE and others have done to re-
ject hatred and promote diversity and under-
standing. I look forward to seeing the success 
of the SAIGU campaign and following FACE’s 
continuing good work.

PATENTS FOR HUMANITY ACT OF 
2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in support of H.R. 5796, the Patents for 
Humanity Act of 2021, which will codify into 
law an expedited process to obtain patents for 
inventors who use groundbreaking technology 
to meet humanitarian challenges. 
H.R. 5796 establishes a competitive process 
that awards certificates to be redeemed to ac-
celerate applications, appeals, and reexamina-
tions at the Patent and Trademark Office. 
The Obama administration established Pat-
ents for Humanity in 2012 as an awards pro-
gram initiative to encourage businesses to 
apply their patented technology to address 
global development challenges. 
Since 2012, the program has proven to 
achieve that by rewarding innovators for using 
technology to better the global community.

viding prescription eyeglasses to people who

lack access to vision care, the PfSPZ Malaria 
vaccine with the highest effectiveness rate for 
a Malaria vaccine, NEW generator recovering 
nutrients from wastewater, and NonSpec pro-
viding affordable and adjustable prosthetic 
limb systems. 
These inventions are just some of the many 
innovative solutions that Patents for Humanity 
fast-tracked in aiding world humanitarian 
issues. 
Innovation is a vital tool in bettering society, 
but often it comes slowly, with high costs and 
inefficient implementation. The pandemic has 
only highlighted how important it is to develop 
solutions quickly and effectively. 
Codifying Patents for Humanity will ensure 
that innovators can provide solutions to the 
less fortunate in a sustainable and efficient 
way through the Patent Office. 
Patents are essential to the United States’ 
economy as they encourage creative disrup-
tion and growth within the country. Patents 
need to remain accessible and innovation 
needs to be protected; especially when it 
comes to groundbreaking technology that can 
assist others on a humanitarian level. 
Companies should prioritize Corporate So-
cial Responsibility to align commercial inter-
ests with the global good. Patents for Human-
ity encourages corporate citizenship through 
rewarding 
humanitarian 
engagement 
and 
proves that reaching underserved markets is 
compatible with business. 
Congress needs to reward innovation and 
incentivize creativity to progress intellectually 
and scientifically in solving global development 
problems, which is why I urge my colleagues 
to vote in favor of H.R. 5796.

HOMETOWN HERO—MIKE E. 
SIMONDS 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 29, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mike E. Simonds, Senior 
Chief at Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office. We 
congratulate Senior Chief Simonds on his re-
tirement after dedicating forty-two years of 
service to the citizens of Tarrant County, in-
cluding twenty-one years with the Arlington 
Police Department. 
Senior Chief Simonds has served an instru-
mental role in our community and state 
through years patrolling our streets, keeping 
drugs out of our cities and ensuring murderers 
were put behind bars. His unwavering commit-
ment is unmatched, from assisting in the im-
plementation of the nationwide Amber Alert 
Program, to helping develop the number one 
Human Trafficking Unit in North Texas, to 
building a robust Narcotics Unit, to growing 
the largest Auto Theft Task Force in the state. 
Senior Chief Simonds served the last five 
years as the first Senior Chief for the Tarrant 
County Sheriff’s Office with honor and integ-
rity, bringing exceptional leadership to the 
agency. 
I thank Senior Chief Simonds for his leader-
ship and the lasting impact he has made with 
our law enforcement partners. He serves as a 
role model and mentor to future leaders main-
taining the highest of standards. Congratula-
tions to Senior Chief Simonds on his retire-
ment and lasting memory of a career of 
service.

HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 29, 2022 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, on April 
27, 2022, I regrettably missed a vote in the 
House of Representatives due to a meeting I 
had with a constituent. 
Had I been present, I would have voted 
AYE on Roll Call No. 127, H.R. 7314, the As-
sessing Xi’s Interference and Subversion Act. 
f 
ASSESSING XI’S INTERFERENCE 
AND SUBVERSION ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 7314, the Assessing 
Xi’s Interference and Subversion Act or AXIS 
Act. 
The AXIS Act requires the Department of 
State to report to Congress on how China’s 
government is directly or indirectly supporting 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
The report will include evidence of the Chi-
nese government helping Russian entities cir-
cumvent U.S. sanctions, inhibiting the U.S. 
government’s investigations, or assisting Rus-
sia with any technology, propaganda efforts, 
and financial arrangements. 
The bill notes that Chinese Communist 
Party General Secretary Xi Jinping met with 
Russian leader Putin on February 4, 2022, 
less than three weeks prior to Russia’s inva-
sion of Ukraine and the two released a joint 
statement outlining a strategic partnership with 
‘‘no limits’’ and no ‘‘forbidden’’ areas for co-
operation. 
Additionally, it notes that China abstained 
from UN votes condemning Russia’s invasion 
of Ukraine on February 25th and March 2nd; 
and that China has not publicly condemned 
Russia’s illegal and unprovoked invasion. 
The Chinese government has demonstrated 
its support of Russia and Putin through com-
pliancy. 
China opposed U.S. military support for 
Ukraine, and abstained when the UN General 
Assembly voted in favor of a resolution blam-
ing Russia for the humanitarian consequences 
of illegal aggression against Ukraine. 
Russian propaganda is spreading through 
China, subjecting the Chinese people to the 
delusion that the invasion of Ukraine is only a 
‘‘special military operation’’. 
Russia has claimed that their invasion is 
partly backed by Ukrainians attempting to free 
Ukraine from its Soviet Legacy. 
The Chinese Communist Party has tradition-
ally supported and encouraged Russia, as 
they are both rooted in communist ideology. 
When Xi and President Joe Biden spoke on 
March 18th, President Biden communicated 
that there would be ‘‘implications and con-
sequences if China provides material support 
to Russia as it conducts brutal attacks against 
Ukrainian cities and civilians.’’ 
As a result of China’s disinformation efforts 
related to Russia’s war against Ukraine, China 
must be held accountable for suppressing 
Russia’s war crimes, as well. 
Russian war crimes include the indiscrimi-
nate killing of countless civilians. In light of 
this, if China is found to be materially sup-
porting Russia in its war against Ukraine, 
there should be swift and rigorous con-
sequences for China. 
Specifically, this bill would include a discus-
sion of China’s support for Russia in terms of: 
Helping Russia or Russian entities evade 
U.S. sanctions or multilateral sanctions and 
export controls; 
Inhibiting 
U.S. 
export 
control 
end-use 
checks, including interviews and investigations 
in China; 
Providing Russia with any technology that 
supports Russian intelligence or military capa-
bilities, including certain classifications of 
semiconductors (EAR99); 
Establishing economic or financial agree-
ments that will have the effect of alleviating 
the impact of U.S. sanctions or multilateral 
sanctions; 
Furthering Russia’s disinformation and prop-
aganda efforts; 
Coordinating to hinder the efforts of multilat-
eral organizations, including the UN, to pro-
vide aid to the people or government of 
Ukraine, to condemn Russia’s war, to hold 
Russia accountable for the invasion and its 
prosecution of the war, or to hold those 
complicit accountable; and 
Providing 
any 
material, 
technical, 
or 
logistical support, including to the Russian 
military or intelligence agencies and state- 
owned or state-linked enterprises. 
We must ensure that, if China is aiding Rus-
sia’s unprovoked and unjustified war against 
Ukraine, then such actions do not go 
unpunished. 
This bill allows Congress to monitor the Chi-
nese government’s activity and assistance, 
and act accordingly. The report required by 
the bill would specific efforts relating to U.S. 
action and sanctions, recommending ways for 
our steps against Russia to be as effective as 
possible. 
This alliance between the Chinese Com-
munist Party and the Kremlin is a serious 
threat to the U.S. and our allies. 
The world should know how China is aiding 
and abetting Russia in evading the effects of 
international sanctions. 
I urge all members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 7314, the AXIS Act because as my col-
league Congressman GREGORY MEEKS said, 
‘‘if China is complicit in the bloodshed of the 
Ukrainian people, the world should know that 
too’’.

his 43-year career to public service, spending 
the last 11 years serving as SMART’s intrepid 
general manager. 
Mr. Mansourian was a terrorist officer in the 
Iranian Imperial Army before he escaped to 
the United States after the fall of the Shah. 
After obtaining degrees in civil engineering 
and political science from Sacramento State 
University, he settled in Marin County where 
he began his civil engineering and public serv-
ice work in 1979. After serving for 32 years, 
including 9 years as Marin County’s Public 
Works Director, Mr. Mansourian retired leaving 
behind an impressive legacy of accomplish-
ments for the county. His retirement, however, 
proved brief, as he was quicky recruited to be-
come SMART’s General Manager, a position 
he accepted in 2011. 
As 
SMART 
General 
Manager, 
Mr. 
Mansourian was tasked with turning 45 miles 
of repurposed rail track into a thriving rail line 
in the aftermath of the 2007 to 2008 financial 
crisis and the significant budget challenges it 
created. Applying his vast experience, skills 
and talents, he worked creatively to solve 
many engineering, construction, and funding 
challenges, coordinating with partner transpor-
tation agencies, elected officials, government 
agencies, community groups, and the public to 
meet project expectations. 
Mr. Mansourian’s ability to manage difficult 
circumstances and collaborate with inde-
pendent and often times competing jurisdic-
tions on a shoestring budget is masterful and 
a key reason regional passenger rail is a re-
ality for SMART riders today. Under his lead-
ership, SMART successfully operates this re-
gional rail line with 12 stops spanning North-
ern Sonoma County to San Francisco Bay and 
serving a peak of 700,000 riders. This success 
of SMART has also contributed to cleaner air 
for local residents as its riders have prevented 
8.1 million pounds of carbon dioxide (CO2) 
emissions from being released into the envi-
ronment. 
Madam Speaker, Farhad Mansourian exem-
plifies what it means to be a public servant. 
His dedication to regional transportation solu-
tions and improving accessibility and sustain-
ability for Marin and Sonoma Counties will 
benefit generations to come. Therefore, please 
join us in congratulating him on his decades of 
inspiring work and in wishing him a fulfilling 
and relaxing retirement.

waives certain requirements related to the 
President’s authority to lend or lease defense 
articles if the defense articles are intended for 
Ukraine’s government or the governments of 
other Eastern European countries affected by 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
For FY2022 and FY2023, an agreement to 
lend or lease defense articles under this bill 
will not be subject to certain requirements and 
provisions that typically apply to such lend- 
lease agreements, including a requirement 
that generally prohibits a loan or lease period 
from exceeding five years. 
S. 3522 will allow the President to establish 
expedited procedures to ensure the timely de-
livery of defense articles loaned or leased to 
Ukraine under this bill. 
There is no question that the Russian Fed-
eration, under the direction of Vladimir Putin 
has been defying the laws of war throughout 
their unprovoked, unjust, and unlawful full- 
scale invasion of Ukraine. 
In the three decades since gaining its inde-
pendence, Ukraine has sought closer eco-
nomic, social, and political ties with the free 
market and democratic nations of the West. 
Since 2013, Putin has directed a campaign 
of political, economic, and military aggression 
against Ukraine. 
In February 2014, the Russian military 
began the invasion of eastern regions in 
Ukraine, including the Crimean Peninsula. 
Their military equipped and supported sepa-
ratist insurgents in the Donbass region, where 
fighting has killed over 14,000 people. 
Today 
the 
world 
is 
witnessing 
the 
unprovoked aggression and invasion ordered 
by Vladimir Putin. 
Putin and his accomplices must be held per-
sonally liable for the war crimes committed 
against the people of Ukraine. 
Russia claims it is not attacking civilians. 
But that is a lie, as Russia has killed tens of 
thousands of Ukrainians, mostly from explo-
sive weapons over a wide impact area, shell-
ing from heavy artillery and multi-launch rocket 
systems, and missile and air strikes. 
Families are being separated by war, adults 
and children are being ruthlessly killed, and a 
rogue Russia is violently crushing political 
speech from its own citizens who oppose the 
war. 
Of all the victims of this irrational, immoral 
invasion, the most severe long-term effects 
are inflicted on Ukraine’s children. Hundreds 
were killed, and many more children have 
been severely injured. 
Many have been orphaned by Russian 
bombing of residences and gathering places, 
in addition to battlefield losses. Thousands 
have been traumatized by the fear and terror 
that missiles and bombs bring, with emotional 
and psychological wounds that are likely to 
last decades, if not for their entire lives. 
Ukrainian children who escaped the carnage 
are also suffering. According to the United Na-
tions and the UN High Commissioner for Refu-
gees, over 5.1 million Ukrainians have left 
Ukraine, about 40 percent are children, and 
over 2.9 million refugees from Ukraine have 
entered Poland since February 24, of whom 
[over] 90 percent are women and children. 
They emphasized that the number of unac-
companied children is ‘‘distressingly high,’’ and 
are largely going uncounted. Children who are 
orphaned or separated from their families are 
especially at risk of becoming victims of 
human trafficking and sexual exploitation and 
abuse. 
It is deplorable that children and their fami-
lies’ lives have been thrown into jeopardy by 
Putin’s war crimes. All children, no matter their 
country’s NATO status, deserve a stable, par-
ented household in a safe community. They 
should never be victims of war, witnesses to 
atrocities, nor orphaned by war’s toll, being left 
to navigate the remnants without their families. 
Yet, all this is the reality for Ukraine’s in- 
country and refugee children. They are scared 
and scarred, and a great number of them 
have no one to help them cope with the heart-
breaking detritus of war. 
Another tragedy stemming-from this war is 
the vulnerability of women and girls to the de-
plorable system of human trafficking. Sec-
retary General of the United Nations Antonio 
Guterres said, ‘‘For predators and human traf-
fickers, the war in Ukraine is not a tragedy,’’ 
‘‘It’s an opportunity—and women and children 
are the targets.’’ 
This is yet another reason this legislation 
must pass: to prevent women and girls from 
being subject to some of humanity’s worst in-
dividuals. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to 
support S. 3522 the Ukraine Democracy Lend- 
Lease Act to adequately support the Ukrainian 
forces against Russia unprovoked vicious at-
tack on democracy. 
The western world must continue to support 
Ukraine during their time of war. 
I look forward to the briefing by Mr. 
Reznikov on his latest defense needs and re-
quests.

Hero of the week, Rose Braziel, CEO and 
founder of Hope 4 Kids. 
Rose started Hope 4 Kids with the same 
values she has carried with her, her entire life: 
love, respect, and kindness. In doing so, she’s 
provided underprivileged children in North 
Texas with food, clothes, and an important 
sense of community. 
Rose’s goal is to not only ensure kids in her 
community are properly taken care of today, 
but to inspire them to be leaders tomorrow. By 
providing an environment for boys and girls to 
learn leadership skills, teamwork building, and 
the importance of volunteering, the next gen-
eration of Texas-24 is well-equipped to lead 
us for years to come. 
Rose’s journey to develop and inspire future 
leaders was far from easy. After two strokes 
and various doctors telling her she wouldn’t 
walk or talk again, Rose has displayed un-
matched resiliency and defied all odds to con-
tinue her incredible efforts. 
Her strength and dedication have helped 
countless students in need of a mentor and a 
friend. I thank Rose for always putting the next 
generation before herself and ensuring they 
are set up for success.

HONORING 
THE 
SERVICE 
OF 
WORLD WAR II VETERAN, JOHN 
DANIEL HARMON, SR. 
HON. JEFF DUNCAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 29, 2022 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor John Daniel Harmon, Sr., a 102-year- 
old World War II veteran from Saluda, South 
Carolina. 
Mr. Harmon was born in 1919 in Saluda 
County on a small farm. Growing up during 
the Great Depression, Mr. Harmon learned the 
value of community, hard work, and being re-
sourceful throughout his life. Mr. Harmon at-
tended Hickory Grove School and was in the 
first class to graduate from the Hollywood 
School in 1937. 
After finishing school, Mr. Harmon joined the 
Civilian Conservation Corps and worked sev-
eral jobs before joining the U.S. Army during 
WWII. He served a tour of duty with Company 
B, 363rd Medical Battalion, 63rd Infantry Divi-
sion as an ambulance driver. His division was 
among the first to cross the Siegfried Line. Mr. 
Harmon still remembers many of the battles 
he endured during his tour, and he is always 
willing to share his experiences of the Army. 
For his service, he received several recogni-
tions including the American Theater Ribbon, 
the European and Middle Eastern Campaign 
Medal with Two Battle Stars for Rhineland and 
Central Europe, the Combat Medical Badge, a 
Bronze Star, and the French Legion of Honor 
Medal. 
After the war, Mr. Harmon returned to his 
hometown of Saluda where he eventually re-
tired as a Superintendent with Eagle Construc-
tion Company. Mr. Harmon and his wife, 
Grace Gentry spent seventy years married 
and saw the growth of their family with five 
children, nine grandchildren, and eleven great- 
grandchildren with who Mr. Harmon has cele-
brated many birthdays and holidays. He con-
tinues to be an active member of his church, 
Bethany United Methodist Church. Mr. Har-
mon still leads a highly active life, and he has 
not lost his wit, knowledge, or cheerful out-
look. Mr. Harmon recently celebrated his 
102nd birthday, making him among the oldest 
surviving World War II veterans in South Caro-
lina. 
The United States is blessed to have the 
finest troops and veterans in the history of the 
world, where so many heroes like Mr. Harmon 
are willing to put on our country’s uniform in 
defense of our freedoms. I am confident that 
Mr. Harmon’s lifetime of service to his country 
and community will continue to inspire many. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to be able 
to serve the Third District of South Carolina 
and to honor those who have dedicated their 
lives to protecting America’s freedoms.

UKRAINE RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
SUPPORT ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in support of H.R. 496, the Ukraine Re-
ligious Freedom Support Act, which will op-
pose religious freedom violations in Ukraine by 
Russia. 
H.R. 496 the Ukraine Religious Freedom 
Support Act directs the President, when deter-
mining whether Russia is a country of par-
ticular concern for religious freedom under 
certain federal laws, to consider incidents oc-
curring in the parts of Ukraine controlled by 
Russia or Russia-affiliated non-state groups. 
Ukraine is a religiously rich country with 74 
percent of people identifying as Orthodox, 10 
percent Greek Catholic and the remainder 
identifying as Roman Catholic, Jewish and 
Protestant. 
Ukraine has accused Russia of targeting 
historic monuments and cultural heritage sites. 
Damaging and destroying at least 59 religious 
sites across the country since its invasion 
began. 
H.R. 496 will direct the president to consider 
incidents in the Russian controlled parts of 
Ukraine found by Congress. 
Ukrainian groups targeted by Russia include 
Muslim Crimean Tatars, the Orthodox Church, 
the Greek Catholic Church, Protestant Chris-
tians, and Jehovah’s Witnesses. 
Religious freedom violations against these 
groups consist of abductions, torture, impris-
onment, property confiscation, vandalism, and 
banning of peaceful religious gatherings. 
Russia is utilizing religious extremism to si-
lence and arrest Ukrainians, including closing 
religious institutions that don’t conform. Reli-
gious freedom violations have been key in 
Russia dismantling Ukrainian civil society. 
Congress’ findings state that international 
humanitarian law requires Russia to protect 
religious freedom in occupied territories. This 
includes illegal entities, such as Russia’s ille-
gal occupation of the Crimea Region. 
In opposing violations of religious freedom, 
it is imperative that we consider the extreme 
religious injustices and restrictions Russia 
placed on the territories they have invaded in 
Ukraine. 
Freedom to practice religion should be a 
protected right for every person, worldwide. 
This bill will ensure the President considers 
these severe violations in Ukraine by Russia 
when determinizing Russia’s threat to religious 
freedom. 
I urge all members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 496, the Ukraine Religious Support Act.

ACKNOWLEDGING 
THE 
HARD 
WORK AND INNOVATIVE THINK-
ING OF TEACHERS AND STAFF 
AT MARY E. ROBERTS ELEMEN-
TARY SCHOOL 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 29, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to acknowledge the hard work and 
innovative thinking of teachers and staff at 
Mary E. Roberts Elementary 
School 
of 
Moorestown, New Jersey for taking steps to 
reduce their food waste. 
Every year is the United States wastes 
more than 100 billion pounds of food, the 
equivalent of 130 billion meals. In New Jersey 
alone, one person on average throws away 
325 pounds of food each year. Across the 
country, over $408 billion dollars’ worth of food 
is being thrown away each year, the need for 
new and innovative ways to reduce food 
waste has never been higher. 
Knowing that their school had an important 
role to play in reducing and recycling food 
waste, teachers and paraprofessionals at Mary 
E. Roberts Elementary School took action. In 
2019, the school received funding through the 
Sustainable Jersey for Schools grant to pur-
chase equipment and hire instructors to ex-
plain to students how to sort their unopened 
and untouched food. These resources were in-
strumental in the launch of the ‘‘No Food Left 
Behind’’ program where left-over food and 
produce from the school’s garden is collected 
and donated to local food pantries and animal 
hospitals. 
The action taken by Mary E. Roberts Ele-
mentary School has inspired the community to 
proclaim yesterday, April 28, 2022, as Stop 
Food Waste Day and encourage others to 
learn about simple ways to minimize the im-
pact of food waste. 
Each of us believes that no one in the 
United States should go to bed hungry. The 
unfortunate reality is that, in New Jersey’s 
Third District alone, more than 55,000 people, 
including 12,000 children, experience hunger. 
Programs such as ‘‘No Food Left Behind’’ are 
not only raising awareness playing a key role 
to raise awareness on food waste. I applaud 
all the staff, students, and volunteers at Mary 
E. Roberts Elementary School for showing us 
how we can all improve our communities, and 
I look forward to seeing more schools across 
the country follow their lead.

whose inspiring story displays the type of 
community North Texas has to offer. 
Despite being born without the lower half of 
his left arm, Khen has always dreamed of fol-
lowing in his brother’s footsteps by playing in 
his school’s orchestra. As his teachers put it, 
‘‘he’s never let anything hold him back.’’ 
This dream was recently made possible by 
the ingenuity of several Nimitz High School 
engineering students, who took their lessons 
from class to tirelessly fashion a musical pros-
thetic for Khen. 
After months of work and his new prosthetic 
dawned, Khen miraculously played the violin 
for his peers, parents, and teachers at a re-
cent school board meeting. 
Khen’s dedication and passion for music 
proved that against all odds, anything is pos-
sible. 
I thank Khen for inspiring us to reach for our 
goals—no matter the obstacles we may face. 
I also thank the brilliant students who made 
his dream become a reality. His creativity and 
compassion for others is a wonderful reflection 
of the spirit of Texas-24.

TRANSATLANTIC 
TELECOMMUNI-
CATIONS SECURITY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 3344 the Transatlantic Tele-
communications Security Act to direct the De-
partment of State and other federal agencies 
to help Central and Eastern European coun-
tries improve the security of their tele-
communications networks. 
To support eligible projects, the State De-
partment shall provide diplomatic and political 
support and encourage international financial 
institutions to provide investment support. 
This bill will strengthen national security co-
operation by securing 5G development with 
our key allies and partners in Central and 
Eastern Europe. 
In recent years, the United States and our 
allies have defeated increased threats from 
China and Russia that seek to expand their 
spheres of influence and undermine demo-
cratic institutions. 
Recently, European countries have felt sig-
nificant pressure to use Huawei 5G equip-
ment, a state-linked Chinese information and 
communications technology company, giving 
China the ability to compromise allied critical 
telecommunications infrastructure. 
5G networks are crucial to artificial intel-
ligence platforms, which in the future will intro-
duce immense national security and domestic 
economic implications. 
Secure telecommunications are also critical 
for military interoperability with our European 
allies at a time when NATO coordination is 
needed now more than ever. 
Given these critical national security needs, 
the United States must provide our allies an 
alternative to Chinese financing and provide 
increased diplomatic support to ensure secure 
telecommunications lines. 
For this reason, I urge all my colleagues to 
support H.R. 3344 the Transatlantic Tele-
communications Security Act. 
HONORING MR. GORDON 
HARGROVE 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 29, 2022 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mr. Gordon Hargrove, a com-
munity advocate who has spent his career 
fighting to deliver basic services to the most 
vulnerable people in Worcester, Massachu-
setts. 
In 1957, while attending Worcester State 
College, Mr. Hargrove began working as part- 
time staff at the multi-service neighborhood 
center, the Friendly House. Over the course of 
65 years, Mr. Hargrove worked from his posi-
tion as a volunteer at the Friendly House to 
the role of Executive Director, in which he has 
served for 52 years. During this time, Mr. Har-
grove has used his passion and knowledge to 
fortify the Friendly House as an important 
service provider to Worcester’s immigrant and 
low-income communities. 
Mr. Hargrove played an integral role in se-
curing funding for the construction of the main 
Friendly House building, which allowed for col-
laborative projects with family shelters across 
Central Massachusetts. In the 70s, he helped 
coordinate providing services to children with 
behavioral issues and advocated for health in-
surance providers to fund mental health serv-
ices. Mr. Hargrove also spearheaded a pro-
gram to provide meals to elders—making the 
Friendly House the first shelter in Worcester to 
do so. Today, most community service sites 
offer elder meal programs, undoubtedly due to 
the work of the Friendly House and Mr. Har-
grove’s leadership. 
Madam Speaker, the impact of Mr. Har-
grove’s advocacy cannot be understated. 
Countless people have had food on their ta-
bles, roofs over their heads, and a job to go 
to everyday because of the services provided 
by the Friendly House and the community- 
based solutions Mr. Hargrove has cham-
pioned. There has never been a problem too 
big to take on or a family he didn’t try to help. 
For over half a century, Mr. Hargrove has led 
the Friendly House with nothing but compas-
sion and goodness in his heart. He has de-
voted his professional life to being of service 
to others and the community. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress and all the people whose 
lives were changed for the better because of 
Mr. Hargrove’s work, it is my great privilege to 
congratulate Mr. Gordon Hargrove on his re-
tirement, and to thank him for his tireless ef-
forts to create a more equitable world.

RECOGNIZING 
GUAM’S 
AUTISM 
COMMUNITY TOGETHER IN CELE-
BRATION OF APRIL 2022 AUTISM 
AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. MICHAEL F. Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 29, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Autism Awareness 
Month. During this month of April 2022, we 
take the time to recognize our autism commu-
nity while reflecting on the ways we can im-
prove our efforts to foster awareness, cultivate 
acceptance, and facilitate change for individ-
uals and families affected by autism. I would 
like to further commend Guam’s Autism Com-
munity Together (ACT) for their continued 
leadership in advancing these very priorities 
both over the past month and year-round. 
Autism Spectrum Disorder is a complex, life-
long developmental disability that can cause 
significant social, emotional, communication, 
and behavioral challenges. It is the fastest- 
growing developmental disability in the United 
States, with a prevalence that has risen from 
1 in 125 children in 2010 to 1 in 54 in 2020. 
This disorder affects more than 70 million peo-
ple worldwide, and in Guam, 273 students 
within the Guam Department of Education 
have autism. However, this number does not 
include hundreds of others on our island who 
are adults, students outside of the public 
school system, and those that may be 
undiagnosed. 
The entire world has shared in over two 
years of innumerable challenges imposed by 
COVID–19, but it is of the utmost importance 
that we do not let this hinder us from extend-
ing compassion and care to others. Groups 
like the autism community face a unique set of 
obstacles that have been exacerbated by the 
global pandemic, and it is critical that we re-
main steadfast in actively working to improve 
the quality of life for individuals with autism 
and their families. Over the years, we have 
made strides in increasing autism awareness, 
but much more lies ahead for us to accom-
plish. Part of this work includes a commitment 
to bridging the gap between mindful aware-
ness and meaningful action. With a collective 
effort to drive the movement forward by con-
necting the two, we can simultaneously break 
down stigmas and build a society which ac-
cepts and appreciates all people. Moreover, 
by supplementing awareness with more oppor-
tunities in education, employment, accessible 
housing, affordable health care, and com-
prehensive long-term services, we can ensure 
that people with autism have the tools to live 
fully in all areas of life. 
ACT has tirelessly advocated for these ob-
jectives since 2004, and this year, they have 
admirably brought the 2022 theme, ‘‘Every 
Piece Matters—Accept & Support Autism,’’ to 
life with various events and projects for the 
entire island community to participate in. 
Namely, they hosted an Autism Awareness 
Wave and Parade, their annual Autism Aware-
ness Fair, a Funtastic Park Day, a Family 
Duck Ride Adventure, Movie Day, Bowling 
Day, 2K/5K Sunset GLOW Run, and a Mass 
of Thanksgiving. They are also scheduled to 
host a Golf Tournament today and have main-
tained a vital platform for our local legislature 
and administration to recognize the autism 
community. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to reflect 
upon the importance of coming together as a 
community and supporting those who have 
been affected by Autism Spectrum Disorder. 
Moreover, I am humbled to serve in pursuit of 
a more inclusive society which fosters under-
standing and celebrates our differences. On 
behalf of the people of Guam, I thank Autism 
Community Together as well as other non- 
profit organizations, government agencies, 
service providers, support vendors, and com-
munity partners across the island who are 
committed to providing the information, re-
sources, programs, and services necessary for

PROTECTING 
SEMICONDUCTOR 
SUPPLY 
CHAIN 
MATERIALS 
FROM AUTHORITARIANS ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
speak in support of H.R. 7372, the Protecting 
Semiconductor Supply Chain Materials from 
Authoritarians. 
H.R. 7372 will require the President to es-
tablish a semiconductor supply chain working 
group and submit to Congress reports on po-
tential disruptions to the supply chain. 
We must always ensure that geopolitical dy-
namics do not impede or disrupt the United 
States’ semiconductor supply. 
Semiconductors were first developed in the 
United States for transmitter use. Since then, 
the industry has boomed with the creation of 
various types of Semiconductors that are used 
in everything from computers to cars, and 
from watches to washing machines. 
Large semiconductor companies such as 
Intel and Texas Instruments rely on certain 
minerals to maintain manufacturing demands. 
These threatened materials include palla-
dium, neon gas, helium, and C4F6, which are 
necessary for the operation of electronic de-
vices. 
Semiconductors are essential to the Amer-
ican economy and day to day American life. A 
semiconductor shortage is a threat to National 
Security. 
We need to plan ahead and anticipate the 
potential impact that Russia and other auto-
cratic, authoritarian regimes may have on 
these supplies. 
This bill will require the Secretary of State to 
submit a report analyzing Russia’s impact on 
supply chains and the global economy while 
also recommending potential steps to bolster 
semiconductor production and secure nec-
essary materials. 
Taiwan is the world’s largest supplier of 
semiconductors, so it is important to account 
for any geopolitical factors that might impact 
them. The bill requires these considerations in 
future reports as well as issues with health 
and natural disasters. 
Through this report, Congress can stay up-
dated for threats to the global supply chain for 
semiconductors and prepare for future geo-
political developments. 
I urge all members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 7372, the Protecting Semiconductor Sup-
ply Chain Materials from Authoritarians. 
IN HONOR OF THE EXTRAODINARY 
CAREER OF ART FRANKLIN, CBS

NEWS 
ANCHOR 
IN 
BIR-
MINGHAM, AL 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, April 29, 2022 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the leadership and extraordinary 
accomplishments of Art Franklin, who is step-
ping down from his position as co-lead anchor 
of the CBS 42 Evening News on April 29, 
2022. 
A native of Detroit, Art is a graduate of the 
University of Michigan. Upon completing his 
education, he began his broadcasting career 
at the WDZZ–FM 93 radio station in Flint, 
Michigan, before leaving to join the WILX–TV 
10, the NBC station in Lansing, Michigan. 
While at WlLX, Art worked as a Capital Re-
porter and Business Reporter becoming the 
first African American male in Lansing to regu-
larly anchor a broadcast newscast. 
Continuing to work within the NBC network, 
Art transitioned to WAVY–TV 10 in Norfolk, 
Virginia, where he served as the station’s mili-
tary affairs correspondent and anchor of the 
Bottom Line, the station’s public service pro-
gram. In addition to regularly reporting from 
the Pentagon, Art also began covering inter-
national assignments traveling to Saudi Ara-
bia, Jordan, Bahrain, Italy, Spain, France, Ger-
many, and the Caribbean. As a trailblazer in 
broadcast journalism, Art continued to make 
history upon moving to Birmingham in 1991, 
becoming Birmingham’s first primetime African 
American male anchor during his 12 years at 
WBRC–TV. Throughout his career, Art re-
ported on major world events such as the con-
flict in the Persian Gulf, the 9–11 terrorist at-
tacks on the World Trade Center in New York 
City, and the terrorist attack at the 1996 Olym-
pics in Atlanta. He also transitioned to political 
reporting, covering several United States 
presidents, including Ronald Reagan, Bill Clin-
ton, and Barack Obama. 
Leaving Birmingham in 2003, Art moved to 
Atlanta joining another NBC affiliate, WXIA 11 
Alive News, before becoming an anchor at 
WAGA–TV FOX5. Though he left television to 
start a Public Relations firm, Art’s passion and 
dedication to his craft brought him back to Bir-
mingham to launch the CBS 42 Morning News 
with Art Franklin. While at CBS 42, Art has 
served as a managing editor and as anchor of 
the 4:00 P.M., 5:00 P.M., 6:00 P.M., and 
10:00 P.M. newscast. 
For over three decades, Art has immersed 
himself in the world of journalism, serving in 
exclusive positions such as the producer of 
the National Association of Black Journalists 
Awards show, which aired on Black Entertain-
ment Television (BET) and guest journalism 
instructor at the Poynter Institute for Media 
Studies in St. Petersburg, Florida. 
Diversifying his career outside of journalism, 
Art has served as the C.E.O. of 285 Records, 
an Atlanta based independent record com-
pany; background actor for multiple award- 
winning television shows including How to Get 
Away with Murder and Greys Anatomy. He is 
also the author of the book Give It All You Got 
and the founder of the Art Franklin Collection, 
a clothing line of male clothing, accessories, 
and custom suits. As a vibrant member of his 
community, his civic affiliations include board 
member of the Jefferson County Family Re-
source Center and member of Omega Psi Phi 
Fraternity, Inc. 
Art has received over 100 community and 
journalism awards for his exemplary career 
and contributions to the journalism profession, 
including most notably, an Emmy Award for 
Outstanding Achievement for spotnews cov-
erage in Atlanta in 2005, and most recently an 
Edward R. Murrow Award for Excellence in In-
novation as anchor of CBS 42’s Coronavirus 
House Calls in 2021. Art is also the recipient 
of the Outstanding Achievement Television 
Programming Excellence Award in 1995, 
Scrips Howard Excellence in journalism Award 
in 1994, RTNDA Best Documentary in 1994, 
and Alabama Associated Press Award for the 
Best Documentary in 1994, and Best Reporter 
in 1995. Securing his place in history as one 
of the best news anchors of a generation, in 
2017, Art was named Alabama’s Best News 
Anchor by the Alabama Broadcasting Associa-
tion. In 2019, the National Academy of Tele-
vision Arts and Sciences Silver Circle recog-
nized him for over 25 years in the industry. 
On a personal note, Art has always been 
the consummate professional. His mere pres-
ence on air has been a source of great inspi-
ration for little black boys and girls in Ala-
bama. Art delivers the news with clarity and 
purpose which has made him my ‘‘go-to’’ an-
chor for the nightly news. We will miss him on 
CBS 42, but I know that Art will continue to 
make significant contributions to our commu-
nity. I congratulate Art, and extend best wish-
es in all of his future endeavors. 
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the extraordinary career of Art Frank-
lin and his exemplary contributions to broad-
cast journalism.

COUNTERING MALIGN RUSSIAN 
ACTIVITIES IN AFRICA ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 27, 2022 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 7311, the Countering 
Malign Russian Activities in Africa Act, which 
requires the Department of State to report to 
Congress a strategy and implementation plan 
outlining U.S. efforts to counter Russia’s ma-
lign influence and activities in Africa. 
This bill directs the Secretary of State to de-
velop and submit to Congress a strategy and 
implementation plan outlining United States ef-
forts to counter the malign influence and ac-
tivities of the Russian Federation and its prox-
ies in Africa. 
Russia has been aggressively pursuing its 
strategic objectives in Africa in recent years 
by: 
securing a foothold in the eastern Mediterra-
nean, 
gaining naval port access in the Red Sea, 
expanding natural resource extraction op-
portunities, 
displacing Western influence, 
and promoting alternatives to democracy as 
a regional norm. 
A report from the Tony Blair Institute for 
Global Change shows how Russia is reviving

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E444 
April 29, 2022 
Soviet-era ties with African states to extract 
resources from the region, and in exchange, 
become a security provider. 
Russia has a vested interest in the deploy-
ment of private military contractors (PMCs) in 
the region. 
Instead of bringing peace, Russia is thriving 
on instability in African states and among Afri-
ca’s leadership. 
Africa is home to some of the fast-growing 
economies in the world and is abundant in 
natural resources. 
With the U.S. and French military draw- 
down in Africa, Russia is looking to prove itself 
as an alternative. 
Its deployment to Mali in December 2021 
demonstrated the rapid support Moscow can 
offer struggling regimes, however Russia is 
also influencing from within. 
Since Putin’s embrace of the region in the 
last decade, political strategists have been 
sent to African governments, including those 
of the Central African Republic (CAR) and 
Madagascar, to counsel their leaders. 
The funding of pro-Russian television chan-
nels in Africa and electoral interference are 
other methods to sway sentiment among Afri-
cans. 
The growing tendency to request PMC sup-
port for mounting security challenges, as Rus-
sian influence increases among African soci-
eties, is a clear indicator of a deepening au-
thoritarian footprint on the continent. 
It seems that African countries are viewed 
by Russia cynically as vehicles for accrual of 
geostrategic advantage and exploitation rather 
than as partners for legitimate economic in-
vestment for trade or security assistance. 
The ‘‘partnerships’’ that Russia seeks in Af-
rica are not state based, but elite based. 
By helping these often illegitimate and un-
popular leaders to retain power, Russia is ce-
menting Africa’s indebtedness to Moscow. 
Russia’s engagements are inherently desta-
bilizing for the citizens of African countries, re-
sulting in stunted economic development, 
human rights abuses, disenfranchisement of 
African citizens, the perpetuation of illegitimate 
governments, and social polarization. 
African stability is not a priority for Russia, 
as it is largely pursued on a patron-client basis 
with compromised African leaders. 
Russia’s unofficial strategy runs counter to 
the interests of many African citizens. 
We must work more closely with African 
members of the UN Security Council so that 
shared interests of security and development 
are advanced at these international assem-
blies. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for 
H.R. 7311 because the United States can help 
Africa become less of a permissive environ-
ment for Russian imperialism. 
It is imperative that we try to help save Afri-
can stability, sovereignty, and democracy.
